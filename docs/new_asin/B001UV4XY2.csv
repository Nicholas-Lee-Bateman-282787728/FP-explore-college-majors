3811534,5,B001UV4XY2,"Another great BD by Sony that makes it a family event worth sitting together and exploring. The whole process takes about six hours to get through everything so probably a decent investment if you are sitting on the fence about cost.

The picture quality is flawless but admittedly you might have to set your color saturation/temp a little differently as the spectrum is very heavy towards the reds, oranges and purples (Up had a certain clarity definition for tons of colors, this is more a bright/soft saturation). The DTS sounded great and all of the channels got used extensively, reference the mayor's scene where he appears on each side of our main character several times in the lab - plus plenty of others. The supplements are both fun and informative and include:

* Splat Mode. Turning this option on allows you to watch the film while throwing varities of food onto the characters in the film. Both of my kids had fun doing this and lasted for a few scenes before they were ready for the next option.
* Food Fight game. This was actually enjoyable for me too - the kids each took turns and found themselves ready to achieve higher scores. Very similar to the old Centipede game as you try to shoot the food before it enters the machine, followed by a higher level where a horde of gummy bears descend toward your flying car.
* Commentary with the makers and Hader. The filmmakers are young and they really should stay behind the camera as their parts in the supplements were either corny or dry. But Hader adds a refreshing touch.
* Making of, 10:50 minutes. Almost a skipper as this one centers on the two makers showing their comic schtick in the kitchen, supplemented with some snippets about logistics, unfunny.
* Voices of, 11:50 minutes. Worth the watch and the best supplement for behind the scenes. Farris, Mr. T and Hader give some great interviews and insight.
* Extended Scenes, 2 @ 2:35 minutes. 1 in HD and 1 in lowdef. Added some cool info to the battle scene in the lab.
* Early Development scenes, 2 @ 5:39 minutes. The whole storyboard thing, skipper unless you are into it.
* Progression reels, 5 @ 7:51 minutes. Much more informative on the making of process/colorization. I would say watch this over the other making of - hands down.
* Cosgrove Sunshine Video. My daughter loves iCarly so we had to watch every option here. You can watch the video by itself or watch with a sing-along option, we did both. There is a brief making-of regarding the video which only had a couple brief interview snippets with Ms. Cosgrove but you know the story if you have a young daughter - we had to watch it twice.
* Make it Rain Food. A brief ad plug for helping the hungry.
* BD Live.

3811535,4,B001UV4XY2,"The following review is of the movie (and a review of the DVD and its features will follow after it has been released):

My husband and I took our almost 5-year-old to watch this at the dollar cinema this afternoon, and all three of us were entertained. My daughter seemed taken by the visual spectacle of the movie - with all the raining food, etc. I, on the other hand, loved the special effects, the vivid colors and fun animation, and the deeper messages of indulging in excesses. The movie itself is based (very loosely) on a well-known children's book of the same name. In the movie version, the story focuses on a small island in the Atlantic where the main industry is fishing and canning sardines. Here lives a young boy named Flint who loves to invent the quirkiest gadgets, including 'spray-on' shoes that will not come off! He becomes the butt of his clasmates' jokes, and the only ones who encourage him are his parents (well, mom more than dad). As Flint grows up (voiced by Bill Hader of SNL), he tries to come up with successful inventions to impress his quiet widowed dad, Tim (voiced by James Caan), who would prefer that Flint help him in his bait and tackle store. The island is also in serious danger of going broke with a failing sardine industry. When Flint finally invents something that actually works - a machine that can convert water into food, the greedy and gluttonous mayor (Bruce Campbell) sees this a chance to revitalize the island, hoping to turn it into a major tourist destination where tourists can gorge themselves on food falling out of the sky. There's also a 'love' interest for Flint in the form of science nerd turned weather girl Sam (Anna Faris) and Flint's little sidekick monkey Steve (Neil Patrick Harris).The demands placed on the machine however,get more excessive over time, with predictably disastrous consequences.

Young children will probably like all the vivid colors, and the visual spectacle of watching food rain down from the sky - cheeseburgers, hotdogs, ice cream everywhere. But, the effects are truly awe-inducing that even adults will delight in it - a spaghetti tornado, jumbo-sized food raining down on people, etc. The humor is appropriate for children without being too juvenile for adult tastes. I also liked the beautiful way the blossoming relationship between Flint and Sam was explored - there's a jello-inspired scene which is truly captivating. The relationship between Flint and his dad is also heartfelt without being overly sappy. There are some deeper messages here such as the dangers of excesses - with reference to food (the mayor's gluttony being a good example), how consumers can be easily manipulated ( bigger portions=better). On the whole - this is a wonderful, visually compelling movie with lovable characters and a unique plot.",1261094400,2,2820,4.909853249475891
3811536,4,B001UV4XY2,"Considering the price  of tickets going to the movies is becoming quite a reflexive act. But on the other hand when you have nieces you need to overlook those little tiny  monetary details. So lately I have been watching  a lot of those so called films for kids, and I have to say that they are much more interesting than many  considered ""serious"" film.
Take this one,  the story maybe sounds absurd, childish and too fantastic but this film has been made to be enjoyed by everybody , no matter the age.
Flint Loockwood lives in  the tiny island of Swallow Falls and his  biggest dream is to be the greatest scientist in the world making inventions which will help people. But his inventions are never fully understood by the villagers and he is considered a good for for nothing  among the villagers. Unfortunately crisis also  has reached Swallow Falls and with its once important sardine industry in decline the mayor has decided to rise the town  with some publicity and the always reliable thematic park.  One day our hero makes the definite machine, one  which can convert water into  food . And so it starts a story  which has everything: unethical poilticians, father-son relationships, catastrophes, romance and Manny ,by far my favourite.
It is funny all the time, although  it loses a little rythm at the last quarter.
I have not read the book in which the film is based so I cannot compare, but if it is half the fun I will be satisfied. One of those films you watch enjoying like a child and the kind you do not mind to spend 6 on it.",1260748800,6,1548,4.517985611510792
3811537,5,B001UV4XY2,The title is a little reaching- but really this was the first cartoon which perfectly married youth and adult humor with the animation that a cartoon format provides.  Your imagination will soar as this movie gives you a lot of warm fuzzy feelings in your brain.  Yes this has been a good experience- the review that is.  I have had a long day and felt like sharing my opinion with fellow Amazonians.,1259452800,4,400,4.527777777777778
3811538,5,B001UV4XY2,"I absolutely loved this movie. I took my kids to see it for the second time last night (to get out of the house!) and laughed even harder than the first time. You see things that you missed that will really crack you up. The expressions on the character's faces, the animation subtleties and the verbal and physical jokes are really genius. I found myself running to the computer to see when it will be out on DVD. I have a 4 y/o, 6 y/o and 14 y/o and they were all cracking up too; especially my older daughter. She caught the ""older"" jokes that the little ones didn't. Its great for everyone without the usual bathroom humor that goes with so many kids movies. (There is one part with the monkey in the ""snow"" but it was hilarious!) The whole movie was just plain entertaining and we will watch it many times when we have it at home. I can't wait!",1258243200,,849,4.246913580246914
3811539,5,B001UV4XY2,"""Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs"" is sunny with a clear opportunity for fun and entertainment. I saw it in 3D at an Imax theater, and the special effects were stunning in this animated film. A boy named Flint wants one thing out of life--it would be peaches and cream to be a famous scientist and inventor. When he's given a lab coat, he really goes bananas and invents some weird things. Later, grown up, how he acquired such an expensive and elaborate lab in his backyard is never explained. His widowed father (voice of James Caan) couldn't be nicer and more supportive. The dad's eyebrows are so thick and bushy we seldom see his eyes.
 They live on an island in the Atlantic (not far from the letter A in Atlantic on a map) where the chief occupation used to be catching and canning sardines. The sardines were canned under the ""Baby Brent"" brand, and Baby is now a big overgrown oaf who wears diapers for promos. When sardines go out of style, off the radar for people's tastes, the gluttonous and avaricious mayor wants to make the island into a tourist attraction as Sardineland with Baby as part of the promo campaign.
 Flint invents a machine that can seed the clouds and make all kinds of food rain down on the town. It starts with what looks like Big Macs. They are delicious and eagerly consumed by the residents, but they don't always come down neatly and splatter around like garbage. The kind of food varies as all sorts of goodies including rich desserts flop down. The amount of food and the size of the food proliferate so that a giant food dump held back by a dam has to be built.
 A TV weather girl, Sam Sparks, comes to the town to record the cascading food, and she and Flint fall for each other like two peas in a pod. The mayor, as he gets fatter, promotes the food drops as a tourist attraction, and cruise ships loaded with hungry sightseers crowd the island. Soon, though, the food flood becomes a problem. The town is in a stew when huge helpings of oversized spaghetti and meatballs descend from on high. Flint and Sam have to go up in the clouds to stop Flint's machine from producing the food glut.
 Indirectly the film could be an attack on overeating and bad eating habits. Also, it says, be careful what you wish for, because your wish may be granted. It's a very funny, exciting movie. Be on the look-out for a sequel. All ages will enjoy the food mayhem and have a feast with this one.",1254873600,16,2424,4.416107382550336
3811540,4,B001UV4XY2,"Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs (Phil Lord and Chris Miller, 2009)

There are some movies where you come out of the theater talking about the camerawork and the acting, discussing plot points, picking things apart, arguing whether it was really the seventy-eighth best movie you've ever seen. And there are some movies where you exit the theater and say ""Dude. That was AWESOME."" Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs is very much of the latter variety; no matter how silly and/or stupid the final half-hour may be (as the few critics who didn't like it have pointed out), it's still a blast.

Flint Lockwood (voice of Bill Hader, recently of Tropic Thunder) is a bumbling inventor who comes up with things that are kind of useful (""The Hair-Unbalder!"" is the movie's first big laugh), but generally stupid. He lives on a small island just off the coast, the entire economy of which is derived from the sardine industry. It collapses, we learn, when the rest of the world realizes that sardines taste horrible. Inspired, Flint turns his attention to devising a machine that can turn water into food (in order to give the islanders some respite from eating three meals a day of sardines). Meanwhile, his father (voice of James Caan) wants him to go into the family business (bait and tackle, naturally), the local cop (voice of, yes, Mr. T) has an eye and a half on Flint thanks to previous experiments, and the Mayor (voice of Bruce Campbell) has staked the island's meager savings on the construction of an amusement park, which he hopes will begin a tourism industry. A station from the mainland has sent an enthusiastic weather girl (voice of Anna Faris, recently of The House Bunny) to cover the story. Flint's machine looks promising, but needs more power than he can get at home, so he decides to take it down to the power station on the day of the unveiling. Mishaps occur, the machine ends up shooting into the atmosphere, and just as inventor and weather girl meet, cheeseburgers begin raining from the sky. Oh, yes, there will be tourism.

My favorite thing about Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs is that the obvious social-consciousness implications (without which, of course, one cannot make a kids' movie these days) aren't shoved into your face (unlike such recent movies as Cars and Wall-E). Yes, they're there, but they're played with the same humor as everything else. More to the point, Lord and Miller, adapting Judi and Ron Barrett's classic childrens' book, trust their audience, young as it is. They figure the kiddies will pick up on the ""overeating is bad, mmkay?"" subtext, and just give it to us in sight gags (none of which feel mean-spirited). Even the ""uncommunicative father"" stereotype, which normally grates on me so hard, didn't really bug me here, maybe because Flint's father is usually seen and not heard; they take the stereotype and make him into an almost silent-film character for most of the film's length, conveying emotion with facial expressions (which is pretty darned hard when... oh, you'll see) and body language. They obviously put a lot of thought into this, and a lot of right thought at that. Add in the voice talent (which I've barely touched on; you can add Benjamin Bratt, Lauren Graham, Al Roker, Neil Patrick Harris, and a couple of others you'll recognize in cameos) and some really appealing animation and you've got yourself a bang-up kids' movie. I haven't seen too many of this year's offerings in that vein, so I don't know how it stacks up against, well, Up, but I liked this one very, very much. ****",1254268800,106,3563,4.7808441558441555
3811541,4,B001UV4XY2,"I took my daughter and her friend both six year old first graders.  I think they really enjoyed the film, when they left  they were both talking and laughing about their favorite parts.  In reality I think they enjoyed it more than UP and Ponyo.  But both of those movies offer more for adults in this movie.  As a side note the really surprising break out of the movie was Mr T.  His voice acting was nothing short of exceptional.  Over the years I have built up a large amount of respect for Mr T as a really upstanding person and I'm glad to see him break out in this role.  I hope that he has a lot more voice over roles from this role because he really brought a lot of depth to the movie.",1253404800,,694,4.051470588235294
3811542,4,B001UV4XY2,"Very loosely based on the acclaimed children's book of the same name, Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs actually succeeds with the modernization and embellished plot. Perhaps diehard fans of the original material will nitpick the expanded mythos, but the film adaptation offers a hearty mix of humor that will appeal to nearly every age group. A wide range and variety of humor can be found within, from the childish and absurd to the clever and insightful; even self-referential mockery and fat jokes make an appearance. Beneath all the layers of food and fun exists a story of finding love and acceptance, though the impressive visuals and wild laughs leave little room for such morals. And between the man-eating roast chicken and the living gummy bears, one wouldn't expect it anyway.

Ever since he was a child, Flint Lockwood (Bill Hader) has dreamed of becoming a great scientist whose inventions would change the world. When he constructs a synthesizer that can change water into food his dream comes true, and as the sky rains down cheeseburgers, pizza, ice cream, and more, Flint finally achieves the adoration and respect he's always desired. But when the greedy town mayor demands an ever-increasing assortment of cuisine, the machine overloads, bringing down mountains of meatballs and cyclones of pasta. Now it's up to Flint, his pet monkey, and nerdy weather girl Sam Sparks (Anna Faris) to save the world from certain extinction by eatables.

The 3D effects being slapped onto almost every computer animated film to hit theaters rarely does anything to improve the imaginative visuals. While there are certainly opportunities for random objects to pierce the third dimension and tantalize the audience, ""Cloudy"" never flaunts the awesomeness of the gimmick. One of the most impressive moments involves a massive food avalanche (foodalanche) that looks amazing either way.

The incredibly obese mayor (Bruce Campbell) provides many of the most hilarious visual gags along with ""sentient"" food, the pessimistic dad unloads the downer realism and the deeper emotional revelations, the elderly and their stereotypical inadequacies with technology is mocked, we're lectured about embracing inner ugliness and supposedly unattractive intelligence, and picking up girls has never been easier than building an enormous, perfectly sculpted, fully furnished Jell-O mansion. Good to know.

Although it's based on the famous children's book, many of the beefed up ideas in the film are so ludicrous that they'd never normally work. But with a wildly creative, inventive approach to the environments, character designs and animation, Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs pulls it off. Full of eye-rolling puns, wacky inventions (including the always-necessary mouth funnels) and unbelievable solutions, it's a deliciously zany, adventurous treat.

I have seen A Bug's Life upwards of 20 times, wrote my college essay about Finding Nemo and was promptly waitlisted at every Ivy Leauge institution (not denied!), and have extensively researched all YahooAnswer responses to ""what's the relationship between Disney & Pixar.""

I can say without a doubt that Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs is the best animated movie of all time. It will meet and exceed all your expectations of plot complexity and subtle humor. Understanding this quiet interjection of ingenious comedy will absolutely reaffirm your opinion of yourself as a wildly perceptive audience member.

I watch this once a year. I love the unusual story and the weird and wonderful visuals. It's also very funny and everyone in the family can enjoy this movie together.

The main character feels sorry for himself a bit much, and everyone puts their own needs aside to bail him out. This happens even more in the sequel though, and when it does, I feel compelled to tell him to stop whining and make more giant, glorious food fall from the sky. I never get tired of how the film looks.",1469664000,,491,4.268817204301075

He was also excited to know a sequel is due out this summer.  Would recommend for 5 or 6 years and up, but too much going on for most younger viewers? Each child is different.

I didn't care for the storyline about a weather machine producing food out of water. The main characters are played by Anna Faris (Mom) and Bill Hader (Saturday Night Live). There are other notable voices but I didn't recognize them in their roles. Still the film is family fun and enjoyable for everyone.

The DVD features the film, a commercial to Feeding America organization, and plenty of previews for other films. I did enjoy Faris and Hader in their roles in the film as the weather woman and inventor. I still felt that the special visual effects and advanced animation overshadowed a weak storyline and lack of character development.",1439942400,,807,5.022388059701493

It's not just a kiddy flick (I don't think many 7 year olds will find 'fight the power' cat as funny as an older audience would). It's a good idea to watch it twice or three times or four times or five times because their are bits of dialogue and imagery that fly over one's head.

3813310,5,B001UV4XY2,"Yes, even fun little movies like this can be about the fight between good and evil.

Our young inventor friend, misunderstood by everyone, even his own father, is trying to do good by creating food to feed to people who do not have enough to eat, but he at least knows the rules that he must follow for the safety of all.

There are, of course, the masses who don't understand what is going on, but take advantage of every benefit that it gives them, and complain when things are not the way things should (in their opinion) be.different.

At the opposite end of the spectrum, we have the mayor who not only is not supporting anyone else in this endeavor, except when it makes him look good, but takes advantage of everything that will profit him, and ignoring all warnings, even the most important warnings that he ignored all the information about during lectures that he thought were not important enough for him to list to. (What he heard, blah blah blah blah science science science science...)

This was a very enjoyable movie, and I recommend it to everyone, even a senior citizen single like me. I've watched it at least twice, and will watch it again, I'm sure.

He likes the original, but wants to fast-forward through all of the less exciting parts.  There seems to be a lot less action and a lot more talking in this one compared to the second movie.  The second movie he will never fast-forward.  It keeps him interested for the duration of the movie which is saying a ton!

3814674,5,B001UV4XY2,"""Have you ever felt like you were a little bit different?""

It took nearly three years to bring 2009's ""Cloudy With A Chance Of Meatballs"" to the big screen - and after watching 86 minutes of its digitally realized anarchic genius - I can safely say it was money well spent. Not only is Columbia/Sony Animation Pictures baby a visually sumptuous watch - it's properly funny for its entire duration, genuinely touching when it needs to be and endlessly inventive in both character and dialogue. It also boasts something rarer than a conscience in the UKIP party - a moral centre that's not stylized schlock - but a story that's loaded with pressing observations about avarice in our increasingly chubby consumerist society. All this and it's effortless cool too. The audience was both smiling and applauding when the credits rolled in our cinema.

Flint Lockwood (voiced to perfection by Bill Hader) is a nerdy school kid - always inflicting his scatological inventions on his parents, his classmates and the good townsfolk of Swallow Falls - a tiny island situated on the map beneath the 'A' on Atlantic. Swallow Falls is the Sardine Capitol of the World - a town that lives on and off the shiny oily silver mites - and Flint's Dad (of Tim's Sardine Bait & Tackle Shop) is proud of it. Flint's father is hard working for sure but since Mom died 10 years back has become safe and unadventurous and prone to mumbling fish metaphors that don't make any sense (a stunning turn by James Caan).

Dad also lives in terror of his son creating yet another 'disaster' like his tin of Spray-On Shoes (to solve the epidemic of untied shoelaces) or his genetically mutated RatBirds (rats with wings that steal kids lunches), his Hair Un-Balder Potion (that produces a woolly mammoth of a man's skull instead of an even rug) or his Monkey Thought Translator Machine. But these are the least of the town's problems - because soon the world discovers that 'Sardines Are Super Gross' - and all life in Swallow Falls goes grey and into terminal decline...

Now grown up - Flint is in his homemade computer hub situated in the Water Tower above a Porta-Dump cubicle in the garden. With his official lab coat on (given to him by his Mom) and with his trusty pet monkey Steve by his side (spouting monosyllabic words through the thought translator) - Flint's working furiously on his ultimate invention - a device that will win back the town and make him beloved of everybody. It's a 'Flint Lockwood Diatonic Super Mutating Dynamic Food Replicator' - a device that will turn water into any food you want. ""Calibrating flavour patterns, radiation matrix secure, uploading cool machine voice..."" Flint enthuses as he slaps the keyboard again - his huge bug eyes bulging with madcap inventiveness as he gazes at his dietary lunar-lander.

Meanwhile - the fame-hungry Mayor of Swallow Falls (a fabulously sly voiceover by Bruce Campbell of The Evil Dead and Bubba Ho-Tep fame) tries to reignite interest in the town by opening a boring theme park called SARDINE LAND with Baby Brent as it's star attraction (a child who used to be on every Sardine tin but is now a dumb boor with a huge midriff). The scheming Mayor gingerly tells the gathered populace ""without consulting anyone, I've spent the entire town's budget on this thing..."" But again an over-enthusiastic Flint ruins everything. Needing 17,000 Mega gigajoules to get his machine to work - he plugs into the island's power grid and wrecks the whole stage show. To make matters worse - a cute and super-perky WNN Weather Channel Intern called Sam Sparks (great vocal work from Anna Faris) has come to town with Manny her pint-sized cameraman to report on the island's re-launch. But along with a humiliated Dad Tim - she watches the mayhem of yet another Flint 'disaster' - Swallow Falls loses its 'F' (along with everything else) and Flint's rocket-propelled food maker disappears upwards into the sky. A mortified Flint hides down by the Docks with his pet monkey Steve...

But then something magical happens - up in the atmosphere - the chugging device is sucking in clouds and starts to spit out slices of cheese and cucumber and then a bap - and the next thing you know it's raining fully-formed cheeseburgers on Swallow Falls. Now realizing that BIGGER IS BETTER - the Major wants Flint to run the machine three-times-a-day for 30 days until the cruise ships arrive and Swallow Falls conquers national TV as a culinary pig-out destination.

In the meantime Flint's new machine becomes food-request central for the locals - Eggs, Toast, Orange Juice, Bacon, Ice Cream, Fudge, Jelly Beans. Cue jokes about ""...poultry in motion..."" and ""...you may have seen a meteor shower, but you never seen a story meatier than this!"" And the gastronomic overload is kept in check by a 'DangeOMeter' in Flint's lab that will tell him if things are getting out of mutating hand. But of course they do. Greed begins to take over - and soon a spaghetti twister is sucking up the buildings and children and a 'Vegas All You Can Eat' food storm brought on by the hideously bloated Mayor threatens to engulf every major city in the world unless Flint can stop the gluttonous madness...

The voices of Mr. T as Earl the Town policeman and Andy Samberg as Baby Brent add hugely to the great fun set pieces - but it's Hollywood veteran James Caan with his furrowed eyebrows and croaky mumble who actually steals the show. His speech to his son Flint at the end of the film is both funny and emotional - a wonderfully written double whammy for a cartoon.

And the visuals are of course fabulous. Not only does the food look good enough to eat - there's over 50 different kinds portrayed with mouth-watering detail - a Nacho Cheese Hot Spring, A Marshmallow Warehouse, an Anti-Gas Tablet Shop, Mouth Funnels to catch the food as it falls from the sky. The massive pancake, butter knob and syrup that dollops on an entire house - is stunning to look at. A cherry lands on top of a leftovers food mountain and the damn holding it all back finally bursts...

The 'making of' featurettes show you how the scenes are built up and the painstaking details applied - how to make an olive crush a building - what does a banana look like when its rolling down a street - how a burger in a bap falls apart when it hits the ground - how do you capture the texture and colour of Flint and Sam romancing in a giant Jell-O Castle...

Directed by Phil Lord and Christopher Miller and adapted by Rob Greenberg from the Judi and Ron Barrett children's book of the same name - ""Cloudy With A Chance Of Meatballs"" was put onto BLU RAY in early 2010 as a 'Combi Pack' with the DVD (and in a snazzy card slipcase). A 'Cloudy 2' sequel appeared in cinemas September 2013 and the BLU RAY for that came out in February of this year.

""The world needs your originality Flint..."" his mother tells him. I agree.

In 2014 - you can pick it up the first movie for under a fiver in the UK. And I'd argue that this is one hydro-genetic mutated chow-down you should definitely find room for in your mental restaurant. Pass the Strawberry Ripple...",1401235200,,7279,4.667706708268331

3814805,5,B001UV4XY2,"I wasn't sure what to expect when I first rented this movie.  I was definitely not expecting to enjoy it as much as I did.  Bill (the voice of the protagonist) is a great voice actor and I love, love, LOVE the humor and the chemistry of all of those involved.  I think they did a great job adding an explanation to the unique weather patterns that wasn't included in the book.  Because the book was simple, it wasn't difficult to spot the same scenes in the movie.  This DVD also came with the directors' commentary, which I thoroughly enjoyed.  In my opinion, the commentary was more fun to watch than the movie because it was very informative and it gave me an even greater appreciation for the rest of the movie.

I found myself watching this movie over and over again with different groups of friends.  There were so many funny moments in the movie that were really well done.  So I bought it and am still very pleased.

Notes: I'd say this movie is great for all audiences, but do be aware that there is a scene at the beginning where the mayor of the town says, ""hell-hole.""  That's the only time there's an unpleasant word (if it matters to you).

Also note that if you are one who likes being surprised, do NOT read the summary on the back of the DVD case.  It pretty much tells you everything that you would see in the movie...like a big fat spoiler.  Seriously, don't read the back until after you watch the movie.

3815630,4,B001UV4XY2,"It's a cute movie: breezy, fun, unchallenging.  It opens with a lovely heartwarming scene of the hero as a cute little tyke, openly ridiculed and scorned by his classmates.  There's nothing like positive reinforcement.  He grows up to be an unappreciated inventor, a master of the impractical.  Through a fluke accident, he becomes a momentary hero/celebrity who mismanages his fame in the most alarming ways.  The message, you can buy your friends and gain popularity by giving into their whims/demands.  They'll love you until things go wrong, which they do.  There's more to life than fancy clouds that rain hamburgers.

The story is bizarre, cheerfully demented, and yes, funny.  They even managed to throw in an awkward romance while they were at it.  My favorite character was Steve, a talking monkey with priorities that didn't always align with his inventor sidekick Flint Lockwood.  I tend to think of this as Steve's movie.",1391644800,,933,5.072368421052632

Sadly, this movie just never did get as good as the trailer made it out to be. It was flat, so-so, and not very funny at all.

Many kid's movies are a joy to re-watch, but some get annoying pretty quickly, and Meatballs falls into the latter category.  It's not that it's a bad movie, it just doesn't have the charm and sophistication to be a family favorite.

It tells the story from the beginning, how the machine was invented, and went much more deeply into the characters. I had fun watching this with my daughter. I think I will make it a springtime regular, to watch when it is really raining outside. I used the opportunity to tell my daughter that tornadoes sometimes start as water spouts, and have been recorded to pick up frogs, fish, and such, dropping them inland and stunning locals.

I thought it would be like most animated films with some boring, trite story line with a half hazard attempt at some moral message that would fly over the heads of its target audience. I watched this movie for the first time when it aired on Showtime. The movie provoked a few chuckles.  I watched it again and again during it's stint on Showtime and I realized this movie got more hilarious the more I watched it.  I grew to love the strange brand of comedy and odd characters.  There were little jokes here and their that kept me watching.  Also who can pass up a movie that gives you a scene where there is a runway made of bacon?!  Even the credits made me laugh when they show what I assume to be London get the 'rainbow and sunshine' treatment.  The giant food is cleaned up, but the city is pretty much gray and dreary like it was before.  Not sure why they were picking on London, but it made me laugh. Lastly, great soundtrack!!

How does that even happen? I assume only 1 out of every 1000 blu ray discs is replaced with an in store DVD loop with a model showing off the great prices on LED TVs at Walmart.

3816848,5,B001UV4XY2,"because it was adapted from a much beloved children's book&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Cloudy-With-a-Chance-of-Meatballs/dp/0689707495/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs</a>&nbsp;but changed so much that many lovers of the book version flat out hated the movie version.  Well, as someone who usually prefers the original book to the movie adaptation, I can sympathize with their feelings, but in this particular case I think they are missing out on a wonder, a truly brilliant movie, even if it has hardly anything to do with the original besides the basic premise of raining food.

On a tiny (American owned?) island off the Atlantic coast of the USA in the one industry (sardine fishing and canning) town of Swallow Falls lives Flint Lockwood who as a boy covered the walls of his room with posters of great inventors and dreamed of emulating them, but his inventions never quite worked.  His earliest shown, created when he was a very young child, spray on shoes, while certainly solving the problem of untied shoelaces, have the downside of not coming off,...

ever (Flint is shown still wearing them as a grown man), but inspired by the belief shown in him by his died-too-young mother and the closure of the Baby Brent Sardine cannery, which leaves the citizens of Swallow Falls stuck with eating the sardines the rest of the world no longer wants, Flint is determined to invent something great,... eventually.

Unfortunately, his latest invention, for turning water into food, goes berserk during the opening of Sardine Land, the Mayor's desperate attempt to save the town through sardine tourism, and ends up wrecking it along with the budding career of the enthusiastic intern would-be weather girl Sam Sparks sent out to cover the event.  But as Flint is hiding from the wrath of everyone, a drop of mustard, a pickle, and a piece of cheese falling from the sky signal that Flint has finally invented something that works,...

sort of.  Flint enjoys his never experienced praise and feelings of success as he produces one amazing food related weather event after another, Sam Sparks reports it, Flint's father expresses pessimistic doubts, and the Mayor pursues his ambitions.  But at the height of Flint's success Something Goes Wrong, and in the end it is up to a small band of heroes to save the World from Foodmageddon.

What the preceding fails to convey is just how laugh out loud funny this is.  Joke-a-minute sight gags abound in what is nevertheless an intricately plotted Hero's Journey of a story.  In particular I was impressed by how carefully and how often ""pipes are laid"": little bits and incidents are briefly and casually shown that will pay off big time later.  Keep your eyes open; almost everything that happens early in the movie is referred back to later, despite the almost continuous jokes, a screenwriter's tour-de-force!  An exquisite score by Mark Mothersbaugh&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Cloudy-With-A-Chance-Of-Meatballs-Original-Motion-Picture-Soundtrack/dp/B002OEBT8W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Cloudy With A Chance Of Meatballs (Original Motion Picture Soundtrack)</a>&nbsp;compliments the unlike anything I've ever seen computer animation.

A couple of performances deserve special acclaim.  First, Mr. T is good sport enough to voice a character obviously intended as a parody of his entire career and to do it in the correct, ridiculously over the top manner.

Second, Bruce Campbell and the animators manage to turn the Mayor into a not so subtle parody of Bill Clinton, done in by uncontrolled appetites and all, though in this case he's shown lusting uncontrollably after food.  How they slipped this one by Hollywood's political gatekeepers is something of a mystery.

Note: A limited edition version was made including a so-called ""magic umbrella"" upon which the falling food pictures only show up when it gets wet.  Having purchased one at the time, I can tell you that the umbrella works exactly as described, but it looked so cheaply constructed that I put it away after a single test use.",1380153600,2,4163,5.414860681114551

3817038,4,B001UV4XY2,"This animated movie is really whacky but it has some good messages.  As giant hamburgers fall down from the sky, the film manages to warn us of the dangers of overindulgence and teaches us to accept ourselves (and others) for who we are.  I really like they way the young heroine in the story is encouraged by the young hero to be her smart, nerdy self rather than trying to be a hyper-feminine dolled-up airhead.  Also, some characters who have negative behavior at the beginning of the movie redeem themselves and I think that's good for kids to see.

3817041,3,B001UV4XY2,"This is an OK movie and my kids like it. It has its funny moments but they are honestly a little too few and far between.  And here are the things that I thought weren't so great about it:

- It's incredibly heavy-handed in its message, which is ""be true to yourself"" with a little bit of ""don't over-indulge"" mixed in.  Not a horrible message, but it is ridiculous how obvious it is in trying to influence kids that watch it.
- The characters are all over-used stereotypes you have seen a thousand times in other movies.
- There are many sections that are so cheesy I was thinking ""really, guys?"" as I watched them.  I don't want to be too specific due to possible spoilers, but there are some pretty cringe-worthy scenes.

At any rate, this movie is worth watching.  It entertained my boys and I.  But if you watch it you should keep in mind that it isn't even in the same league as, say, Up.",1368748800,,894,4.285714285714286

3817155,4,B001UV4XY2,"Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs is one of those dumb funny movies you can't help but like.  Even though the plot is weak, the idea is imaginative, and although I'm not in the target market of kids, I still enjoyed it as an adult.

Flint Lockwood is an inventor.  Always has been, ever since he was a little kid.  But the problem is, none of his inventions ever seem to work out.  On the day of a big reveal in his hometown, he decides to test out another invention.  This one, is supposed to turn water into food, a real treat considering his town mostly eats sardines.  But things go awry and his machine shoots up into the sky.  But then, strange things start happening, and it starts raining food, and his invention becomes a bigger success than even Flint could imagine.  But with great power comes great responsibility, and it doesn't seem as if Flint and his hometown can handle the wondrous invention.

Characters:
Bill Hader as Flint Lockwood.
Anna Faris as Sam Sparks
Neil Patrick Harris as Steve the Monkey
James Caan as Tim Lockwood
Bruce Campbell as Mayor Shelbourne
Andy Samberg as Brent McHale
Mr. T as Officer Earl Devereaux

I can't say that any of the cast was stellar.  Well except Neil Patrick Harris, he's always awesome.  And he plays a monkey, so it's not like he can screw that up.  But Hader, Faris, and all the others, there just wasn't any chemistry there.  They all were perky and upbeat, but since it's an animated film it made it even harder for them to seem like real people.  A lot of the characters, not counting the voicing, are simply unbelievable too.  While there's some good lessons learned (like express love for your children and make them feel appreciated) a lot of it was overly sappy.  And the love story, don't even get me started.

And there were some plot holes.  Like why I send a weather girl to film a story about a town unveiling something?  Although it served later on when the food weather came about.  But overall the story was extremely cute.  Who wouldn't love it to rain food once in awhile?  Although too much of something can make it bad, I really wouldn't mind it raining skittles or something at times.  That's just fun.  And really, the animation is why you would watch this movie.  It was spectacular, with the use of food raining from the sky and all the different types that came down.  Visually it was cheerful and a lot of fun and I can see why this would be a popular kids movie.  And everything in it was appropriate for kids too.  No cussing, nudity, etc. Although there is a guy in a diaper, but that has a story behind it too.

The music was ok.  Mostly upbeat and instrumental.  I really didn't pay that much attention to it as it was just background noise.  And that's all it was supposed to be.  This wasn't a sing-along or a musical.  So no complaints there.

A very cute movie and one you can forgive for its many flaws.  It's the type you can watch over and over again and probably still find some detail you missed before.

3817156,4,B001UV4XY2,"I fully condone that this is a very predictable, safe kid's movie. It has a lot of CORNy (GET IT?) jokes too. But, somehow, it still manages to be entertaining. I'm a big fan of Anna Faris and Bill Hader and am in full support of any project to lets Faris be anything other than a ditz (Lost in Translation gets a free pass). Bruce Campbell is great, as always. And from a character standpoint, it's reasonably touching.",1363219200,,420,4.397435897435898

3817251,4,B001UV4XY2,"I never read the ""Cloudy with a chance..."" book, so I was not really expecting anything at all. Well, I must say I was thoroughly impressed by this movie.

Although this was released about 4 years ago, we do expect the animations to be done well, and this movie did not deviate from that expectation. Everything was realistically done, from the movement of the charactors mouths when speaking to the lighting and shadow effects, to the overall movements of all the charactors. If you let your mind go a little, you could almost even forget that this was an animated movie.

One of the things that really stood out to me was how dual layed this film was. While it of course catered to the children in the audience, it also offered a lot for the adults. There were blatent laugh inducing moments for the children, but there were also those subtle moments that only adults would pick up on, and those moments were hillarious! The premise for the movie, although simple, was very well thought out and executed. So much so, I never really became bored or just plain ready to leave (qeue the attrocious animated movie ""9"").

Reflecting back on the actual movie, I really liked how various issues were brought to the fore and handled well, such as personal relationships between fathers and sons, how to deal with and eventually not be ashamed of being on the upper end of the IQ scale as well as other subjects. To tell you the truth, I believe the children really understood these points as well. It's not everyday an animated movie really has a few messages to bring home and they are actually absorbed by the audience and done well.

All and all, I think this was a very well done movie, one that children and adults can both enjoy, although on different levels.",1359504000,,1759,4.574603174603174

3817321,1,B001UV4XY2,"First, I have to say that the movie is cute and if you're looking for a fun family movie!

Second, JUST BUY THE DVD. Using Amazon Instant Video is a waste of time and money. First, you pay almost as much as you would for a DVD and you can AT BEST watch it on TWO devices. Why would I want to pay $10 for something I'll only be able to watch on my living room or on my PC? Until I can burn to DVD what I PAID for I will not be using this service any more. I am SO frustrated that I wasted $10 for this copy and STILL have to go buy the DVD so I can actually watch this movie as my family and I please.

Of course, I should have read the fine print, but I'm accustomed to trusting Amazon not be a shady company and screw me out of money, so much for that. Amazon needs to make it much more clear that purchasing is NOT REALLY purchasing, it's unlimited streaming and download for WATCHING ONLY on two devices.

Not to mention download speeds are not great. I'm sure that some of that is my internet connection, but I do have a good connection and don't want to consider how much more money I would have to spend to make the download time tolerable.

HOW TO TAME YOUR DRAGON---the son of a Viking chief is a misfit, living in a village harassed by dragons. The son, who is an inventor of sorts, brings down a dragon with a catapult, then befriends said dragon. Boy saves village.

PARANORMAN---the son of a fat man is able to see and speak with dead people. Other live people cannot do so, so they think that he's nuts. He lives in a Salem-style village where a witch was hanged centuries ago. The witch comes back to destroy village. Dead people give the boy clues to stop her. Boy saves village.

CLOUDY WITH A CHANCE OF MEATBALLS---the son of a shopkeeper is an inventor whose inventions cause havoc. He invents a machine that turns rain into any kind of food. The village becomes famous. Unscrupulous mayor wrecks machine, which goes totally out of control and starts to destroy village. Boy saves village.

The script is beyond great and Bill Hader has perfect comic pacing as the lead.

The underlying social commentary on how many Americans crave total junk as their diet is unsubtle but still it works. In a way the movie works on many levels so I'm sure with repeated viewings you'll get even more out of it.

Some of the 3D action pads out the length of the movie but it never seems done just for the sake of effect and adds to the story.  Color using the passive glasses is outstanding, depth, sharpness, and outlining of characters is clearer than the non-3D version.  Passive is the only way to go and is what is used in theaters--on no one gets sick from the effects.  The movie script is smart and funny with appropriate character reactions (and great voices especially Bill Haidar).  Very, very entertaining and highly recommended 3D or not.

It caught my attention and I just had to get it. Let's face it, all inventors are misunderstood and teased at  greatly when they were young. Although Flint's inventions just kept backfiring, he just kept on trying and kept at it. Amazingly his invention worked, and he just needed more power to make it go. Wow, I must say how amazing this invention of his works, it could end world hunger. And even with a movie like this of turning water into food, you never know as someday, somebody just might take it one step ahead, and make it into a reality. And they can say that they got inspired by the movie. I think that the sequel to this story is when Flint invents a machine to make it rain pickles. Yeah the whole town of chew and swallow covered in pickles, what fun is that, everyone eating nothing but pickles?! You figure with all the giant food, since it was made of water, then Flint could've changed it back into water. And just call this giant food frenzy a historical food event.

Depends on unoriginally ridiculous actions of the characters to keep the plot going.  I'm all for imagination and creativity but the story is so ridiculous it's hard to care for any of it.

3817459,3,B001UV4XY2,"Maybe it is because I have seen so many animated long feature films, but as an older adult, the story of ""Cloudy With A Chance of Meatballs"" dragged.  However, I was amazed at the creative and beautiful artwork of the animation, no matter how crazy the story.  (I am sure kids will love this with food falling from the sky - especially jelly beans and ice cream)  The story is about a nerd, an only child, who loves to invent things.  His name is Flint Lockwood (Bill Hader), and of course his mother has faith in him, but his father just wants him to work with him at his Sardine Shop.  His Rube Goldberg-like contraptions are fun and imaginative.  His weather machine turns rain into food, so a disaster ensues of too much food raining down on the tiny island they live on.  It has wisps of a disaster news story like the recent  Indonesian and Japanese Tsunamis.  However it is light and  full of wildly imaginative twists and turns. People get greedy and fat, the machine goes crazy with a spaghetti tornado!  Flint and his nerdy weather girl girlfriend save the day before the world is covered in meatballs.  An interesting thought in the time of food shortages here on earth!  Anyway, I thought the animation was as good as Pixar's and the beautiful colors and treatment of the jello rainfall were eye candy.

3817471,4,B001UV4XY2,"Bigger isn't always better. That's the lesson inventor Flint Lockwood and the townspeople learn the hard way. For years, Flint's inventions had been disastrous, but one day, Flint finally invents a winner -- a device that turns rain into food. Since the townspeople had been stuck eating only sardines, they're thrilled by the sudden variety of food available. However, growing demands for more food start overloading the system and so, what starts out as a great invention quickly turns disastrous, too.

Besides the ""bigger isn't better"" message, there's also an environmental message about our out-of-sight-out-of-mind mentality about disposing waste, though not delivered as heavy-handedly as Wall-E.
There's also the following 3 messages, too:
(1) meeting needs through shallow substitutes will prove unfulfilling,
(2) you'll be happiest being your authentic self and
(3) don't get addicted to fame because fame is fickle.

I loved these messages but also loved seeing how food gets transformed...from rooftops made out of ice cream to a tornado made out of spaghetti and meatballs.  The movie has it's funny moments, too, like Flint's ice cream snowball fight with unsuspecting victims and the lame chant kids use to taunt the newscaster.  Some of the humor was gross-out, though, like the dad kissing the son who just vomited and the monkey pulling out the heart of a gummi bear.  Personally, not a fan of gross-out humor.

The near ending has a kind of Indiana Jones sequence that, on one hand, is clever in it's use of food, but on the other hand, drags a bit too long.  Overall, though, I thought this movie was funny and clever, with a final message  that appearances can sometimes be deceiving.",1295049600,3,1706,5.089605734767025

Note that you must read the fine print on the back cover before it is pointed out that this is only for PSP. Shame on Columbia Pictures for marketing it this way.  Very misleading and dishonest marketing.

I can't return my copy, so I'm eBaying it to keep Columbia from getting someone else's money.  The only way I can get my money back.",1294444800,5,677,4.217054263565892
3817474,4,B001UV4XY2,"I'm never too keen on animated films. Especially the more recent ones. But Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs is laugh-out-loud hilarious.

At least for the first half of the movie.

Bill Hader is the voice of Flint, an inventor who wants to help feed his town anything but sardines. So he invents a machine that will cause it to rain any type of food he asks.

Anna Faris is the voice of Sam, a television reporter seeking her big break. She's on the site for when the gizmo begins and the sky begins raining food.

The townspeople are exited for the new choices and Flint is the new celebrity, but the only person he wants recognition from is his father, Tim (voiced by James Caan) who doesn't like technology and wants things to go back to the way things were.

As expected, things begin to go haywire and the food begins to mutate. It's up to Flint and Sam to fly up to the clouds and stop the food from falling.

As I said, the first half of the film is hilarious. Like the small jokes found in Horton Hears a Who, you'll need to be quick to catch some of the jokes behind the main action.

I laughed out loud 'till I cried during the snowball fight with the ice cream. Flint had never had a snowball fight so he starts to pelt as many people as he can with ice cream balls.

One important note- it's highly recommend to watch it more than once because the animation moves at an incredibly frantic pace.  It's really hard to keep up with everything taking place on screen.

From what I've gathered though, this is the type of film that should almost certainly be an instant highlight with the kids, and even adults will probably find a good amount of humor in it (much like adults used to love Earthworm Jim back in the mid 90's- it's so silly that EVERYONE finds it insanely funny).

The storyline is very simple- a man wants to change the weather so it rains food instead of rain.  He's apparently some kind of nerdy scientist, and he immediately connects with a female weather forecaster.  His main goal is to win over his fathers respect.

It's just *extremely* fun watching an animated film where food rains down from the sky in really colorful, creative and thoughtfully designed ways.  I can't imagine how much time and devotion it must have taken to make a film as zany as this!  Worth owning.",1293667200,,1226,4.665116279069768

'Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs' is at present one of the least expensive available -- and it's a lot of fun.  I'd seen it before in regular 2D and thought it was funny, but really in many respects it's just another animated 'message' film (""Gluttony is bad.  Being your true self is good.""), somewhat formulaic and all that.  They did put in some humorous pop culture references, and a few jokes only the older folks will get.

But really, if you want to show a visiting guest ""why both with 3D?"" -- put in this disc and blow their socks off.  The colors are sharp, the depth of field excellent, and there's enough 3D-specific action and features to really show off what a good 3D television system can do.

I should add there are a couple bonus features on there, sample scenes from Open Season and Monster House.  I think after the holidays there's a good chance we'll pick up the former.

3817534,5,B001UV4XY2,"While I can't say I've actually ever encountered Judi and Ron Barrett's 1978 children's book that inspired this film, I can attest to the fact that this CG-animated masterpiece hits all the right notes when it comes to competing in the arena established by companies like Pixar and DreamWorks.

Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs is set on the island of Swallow Falls, a small community with an economy fueled by the sardine industry.  In isolation from the outside world, the now economically depressed island struggles to stay afloat, and finds themselves relying on the only thing they have (sardines) to survive.

Inventor Flint Lockwood (Bill Hader), along with his talking monkey colleague Steve (voiced by Neil Patrick Harris) hope to change the sardine-based world around them with an invention unlike any the world has known: a nanotechnology converter capable of rearranging water molecules into any kind of food imaginable.

A first for poor Flint, this device actually seems to work.  The trouble is that when it accidentally gets rocketed into the stratosphere in the presence of former nerd turned news-reporter hottie Sam Sparks (voiced by Anna Faris), the very weather itself is suddenly quite unstable!

Before long everything from burger and hot dogs drizzle to pancake downpours and ice cream snowstorms begin to make their way from the rolling purple clouds. Flint goes from outcast to local hero in one fell swoop, but the fame pales in comparison to all he really seeks: the respect of his gruff tackle shop owning, unibrow sporting dad (James Caan).

The film works on just about every conceivable level: Fantastic visuals with unrivaled lighting effects mean the kiddies will be glued to the flat screen, an intelligent screenplay by Phil Lord and Christopher Miller that offers exceptional humor that even adults can enjoy, and a cast that never misses a beat (Bruce Campbell as Mayor Shelbourne, Mr. T as Officer Deveraux, and ""Baby"" Brent done by the infectious Andy Samberg), you come away with a project that gives absolutely nothing up to Pixar or DreamWorks.

Pacing is very brisk, even for a movie primarily targeted at children and wastes very little time setting things up.  Best of all it manages to do something all animated features aspire toward but few achieve: It establishes characters that are easy to care about!

Couple this to the fact that there are lessons scattered about on many levels that will reveal themselves as the viewer matures mentally and the lasting appeal of having this one in your collection becomes clear.

I was able to enjoy this one in a room full of individuals ranging from preschool age to retirement and just about all intervals in between and can attest to the fact that all involved were intensely connected and frequently laughed out loud at the various levels of humor contained within.

In all, this is a highly recommended animated feature that literally offers up something for nearly everyone.  Sony Imageworks has yet to establish a presence that threatens the big boys of the industry but Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs is certainly not to blame for that reality.  In fact, I could go as far as to say that it does an incredible job at narrowing the gap.",1283817600,,3237,4.948339483394834

3817578,5,B001UV4XY2,"Despite successfully cross breeding a rat and a bird, as well as creating a monkey thought translator, Flint Lockwood (voiced by Bill Hader) is thought of as a failed inventory and a social pariah in Swallow Falls, a town dependent upon and known solely for sardines.  When the rest of the world finds out that sardines are disgusting (what took them so long?), the town's economy begins to tank.  Seeing the town's impending doom, the gluttonous Mayor (voiced by Bruce Campbell) decides to bolster the economy and tourism with an amusement park based upon the town's rich sardine history.

Along with his monkey STEVE!, who conveys simple thought in one-sentence yelps, Flintlock sees this as his calling to save the town by creating a water-to-food machine that needs just a little more power.  Upon the park's grand opening, Flint evades the watchful eyes of his disapproving father (voiced by James Caan) and the hovering local cop (voiced by Mr. T) - both of whom have seem the dangerous results of inventions gone astray - to connect his contraption up to the local power station.  The resulting explosion sends the town into chaos, Flintlock into hiding, and the machine into the clouds.  Where it begins to rain down delicious burgers upon the unfortunate town and local weather girl Sam Sparks (voiced by Anna Faris) covers the phenomenon and gets her big break.  Everyone wins, right?  That is, until the Dangeometer on Flint's contraption crosses into the YELLOW! and food begins to over-mutate, turning every falling treat into a Man vs. Food challenge and eventually creating a spaghetti tornado.  Will the town survive the foodalanche?  It's up to Flint and Sam (and STEVE!) to peak through the clouds at the machine run amok.

It seems no children's movie is complete without the sermon nowadays.  And Cloudy is no different, providing easily relatable relationship dynamics, and lessons in overindulgence.  The difference is, this movie does it almost subliminally, coating the stomach with enough comedy to wash down the medicine.

This is a very spirited, quick-witted, and funny movie, with enough originality and inventiveness for me to give it my highest possible recommendation.  Great movie for the family.

3817579,4,B001UV4XY2,"With the prior success of Open Season and Surfs Up scoring them some points in theatres, Sony Pictures Animation followed up with a movie based on the children's story from the 1970s by Judi & Ron Barrett. This relatively short book was concieved into being a full-length motion picture by Chris Miller and Phil Lord, who created the cult MTV animated series, Clone High.

Set on a small island off the American east coast, Flint Lockwood is a tinkerer who has spent a good portion of his life coming up with invention-after-invention, all of which have failed, including his spray-on shoes which have never come off since he put tested them on himself as a kid. His father wants him to help around his tackle shop, but Flint tries one more take at achieving his dream of being a great inventor. He makes a machine that is supposed to transform water into any kind of desired food, but he ends up accidently sending it into the atmosphere which starts turning the moisture in the air into random food. Flint manages to set up a way of controlling the machine so that he can make it rain whatever food the townspeople want. The greedy mayor convinces him to help use this as a tourist attraction for the town, but Flint mainly wants to do this to impress Sam, the cute weather reporter from New York reporting on the falling food phenomenon. He even goes to the lengths of making an entire castle made of jello to win her over. Unfortunately, the machine goes haywire, and starts dropping giant entries all over the globe. Flint and Sam, along with their mistmatched crew, head off in Flint's jet car(which now has wings!)into the eye of the food-storm, and manage to stop the machine before the entire world is covered in takeout, even though everyone in the town has to escape on pizza-boats.

I'll was really impressed with the animation in this. What really bought it for me was the cartoonish look of the characters and the world they lived in, while keeping it very detailed and slightly realistic. The movie goes the extra step to ellaborate  from the original source material of how the small town started having it rain food. It pays homage to alot of disaster flicks, and this shows with the hilarious scenes of entire cities being ravaged by falling giant pancakes. There are some intensely funny moments in this, and I loved all the running gags with Flint's failed former experiments. It's a clever comedy for the whole family, and any film that has both Bruce Campbell and Mr. T in it is a solid win!",1280793600,,2513,4.617449664429531

In this one, even when the main characters are talking in the front, you can see some minor things ""moving""/""doing something"" in the back that intends to make you laugh. Mostly importantly, it makes you laugh by the actions, not by words, and therefore great for children and adults alike.

The whole ""four-eyes"" chant was really over the top.  Is this movie supposed to be the 1970s when girls had to act stupid and we taunted kids who need glasses?  Being visually impaired is a handicap, not a joke.  We don't chose to put on a pair of glasses just so we can look ""nerdy.""

The 3D effect is better on the 'Cloudy with a chance of meatballs' disk than the 'Aliens VS Monsters' disk.  Better left and right eye seperation, no noticable '3D is lost for a moment' points (the 'Aliens VS Monsters' disk has about 3 of these - they are minor, but there).

I first saw this movie in 3D at the theater, then watched it about 6 times on 2D on Blue-ray, and my wife begrudging watched it again with me because it was in 3D (she asked how many times was I going to buy this movie?).  The 3D at home for this movie was a superior experience then the 3D at the theater.  Honest - and I am using a LED-LCD 3D tv (those with Plasama 3D tv's will be even more impressed).

Here is the thing - if you have a house full of kids that would just break the 'over a hundred bucks each' 3D glasses, do the 2D blue-ray or only watch this 3D blue-ray in 2D mode when they are awake.  If you are a kid at heart (like me) the 3D is fun.  It will not make a bad movie good, but it can make a great movie (which 'Cloudy with a chance of meatballs' really is) even more fun.

I did not notice any ""ghosting"" as mentioned in other reviews in the Monster vs. Aline's movie which I have and did see a little.

I am so happy there was a new movie to watch with my TV setup, I wish the Big TV guys would stop matching the new movies with purchase of a new TV system, like Panasonic has done with Coraline & Ice Age 3.

I did not see this movie in theaters when it was out the for whoever disagrees about the new 3D technology must not own one. I was lucky to be able to upgrade because of a home robbery. This is a great new technology that I can now enjoy at home, as close as possible the the 3D movies in theaters today! I will be buying every new 3D movie that comes out or is on pre-order as soon as I can find out about it.

The only ""down side"" I can think of about this movie, is that the menu of the Blu-ray did not have the special 3D viewing or just normal 2D view with nothing special.

3817613,3,B001UV4XY2,"As a science fiction fan for many years I can honestly say I have never encountered a story concept that even comes close to this movie; ""Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs"" is a true original in my experience! I was not aware of the book, which the publisher says is suited for the 4-8 year old crowd (which may explain why the story had not appeared on my radar) and watched the movie with no preconceived notions.

The story tells us of a nerdy boy inventor named Flint who has dreams that he may someday make a difference; it just seems that his efforts to realize those dreams always meet with limited or no success. As the story unfolds we see the dreams taking on bigger dimensions until one day when something goes seriously wrong.

Living on an island ""under the A in Atlantic"" the boy and his community are dependent on sardines for their livelihood; when people discover sardines don't taste good the bottom falls out of the sardine market and their island is in big trouble. Under the leadership of their mayor, plans are made to create a new industry for the island.

The day for the big unveiling of the new project comes but is interrupted by one of Flint's experiments that changes everything; from that point on the challenge becomes what to do with the experiment in progress.

The movie is entertaining and will be appreciated by the 4-8 year old child, just as the publisher said; it will probably also be appreciated by those who can let their imaginations soar. My impression is, the younger you are the more you will like the movie, at least down to 4. Being decades older than that, I can say the movie was entertaining but I'll probably not ever watch it again.

If you have children or if your inner child is alive and well it should be worth at least one viewing. The children will probably want to watch it multiple times.",1277337600,,1849,4.491071428571429

3817675,2,B001UV4XY2,"Ever since it was released back in 1978, Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs has become a popular children's book. It's not only filled with beautiful artwork, but it also showcases some clever ways on how food of gigantic sizes can be dangerous. I remember reading the book repeatedly when I was a little kid, and I always found myself enjoying it. Judi and Ron Barrett have done a wonderful job with this one. Cut to thirty-one years later, and we have a film adaptation. Now, the small kids of today will no doubt admire it for what it is: a fast-paced, ADD-induced animated film filled with food and comedy. Unfortunately, however, those who have actually read the book when they were very young will probably find a part of their childhood obliterated. Sony Pictures has demoted the spirit of the children's book, and has made a horrible adaptation. It is more of a colossal dissatisfaction at least for me, because it could have been done properly. Now, I have to admit I might sound biased towards the film, considering that the original children's book played a part in my childhood. But the book had such a huge impact on me when I was a little kid that I simply cannot find the film enjoyable.

So what's wrong with this animated film? Well, there are four major problems with CWACOM. The first problem can be quite obvious: the horrid look of the film. In the original book, there is a sort of mysticism that surrounded the artwork, and it gave the actual story some capriciousness and charm. In the movie, it's all quirkiness and NO charm. There is nothing ethereal about the foods that fall from the sky. Nothing is visually stimulating. In fact, it seems like it's all just an excuse to showcase some of the same tedious CGI animation that we've seen many times before (only this one is slightly more mediocre). The second problem with CWACOM is the pacing. Now, the flow of the film is fine during the first half, but the second half is just torture. It's so fast and so ADD-inducing that it's almost tiresome. Kids with ADD would enjoy this; I'm not so sure about everyone else. Third, the characters are.....well.....uninteresting. They don't have any real personas: they lack charisma, wit, and most of all, uniqueness. But what's worst about these characters is that it's very hard to look at them. I don't know who designed these fictional individuals, but they certainly made them look grotesque and uncanny (especially Flint and Samantha). I know it's supposed to be a family film, but the characters look WAY too cartoonish for their own good. But I think the biggest problem with CWACOM is that it's really overproduced. I think you'll notice right away that many scenes involving food are bloated with wall-to-wall action sequences and non-stop comedic segments. There is so much going on, especially in the third act of the film, that it can give you a very nauseous feeling if you're not accustomed to watching giant-sized cheeseburgers and spaghetti flying everywhere, or pancakes and sandwiches destroying everything they land on.

To be honest, out of all the bad things to have come out of this, it's not really one of the worst animated films of all time. There were a few jokes that did make me laugh, and I did like the music by Mark Mothersbaugh. Unfortunately, it's still an animated atrocity. The basic premise of the children's book remains (food falling from the sky, etc.), but everything else does not. The animation is unpleasant to look at, the characters are unlikable, and all the food and the destruction are just too much to handle. Again, kids will probably love this one, but everyone else might be disappointed. I am. I did not have a fun time watching this movie. Compared to the book, it's a big letdown. The opportunity to create a great adaptation has been wasted.

Almost all the characters are odd. The writer must have had quite a loner life when he was growing up. But all comes together. Storyline with all its oddity comes together to give you a satisfying experience. Very enjoyable movie for the whole family.,1269561600,,417,4.573333333333333

3817680,5,B001UV4XY2,"I have watched this movie over and over and it's one of those I think will become a classic one day. I find this movie fits my sense of humor perfectly and is one of the few out there that will make me literally laugh out loud no matter how many times I've watched it. I'm 25 years old married with no children and I will not be bored of this movie for a while. The movie is not realistic by any means and I think it allows you to kind of sit back and enjoy the crazy plot that unfolds without saying to yourself ""yeah right"" or ""no way, that is too far fetched"". the characters are well developed, the actors who play them are well known and did a great job with voice-overs. The best I can describe the humor is kind of slap-stick/children's/ren-and-stimpy/less-vulgar version of Family Guy. It's a movie your kids can watch but you can tell most of the jokes are directed towards adults without the kids noticing. I don't care what other reviewers say about this movie. I say it deserves much more credit and attention than it has gotten. If you are considering renting I'd say just buy it! This movie is well worth the purchase due to the fact you can watch it over and over again and pick up on small details and funny background things you missed the first few times. If you don't want to buy then at least rent it. But don't let this one go under the radar. Definately a great buy for the whole family! hope you enjoy!",1269475200,,1425,4.242647058823529

I never read the book, so I can't say anything about how faithful it is to the book. As its own movie, it's very well done. It's really funny, sweet, and highly quotable. Another plus is that it's even better with repeat viewings (and with our kids, there have been many). For this set specifically, I'm very happy that with so many kids movies, they're selling the combo DVD/Blu-ray. The Blu-ray quality is excellent, but it's a great help to have the DVD as well, as our main TV still has just the DVD player.

It was funny, and it made me feel like a kid again. It brings you into this imaginary world where anything could happen. Never would you really be able to swim in Jello, or eat pancakes from the sky. It takes all the things you would daydream about as a kid and lets you see them for about an hour and a half. The characters are funny, the story has a nice subtle message and it was very pleasing to the eye. If you have kids, you should get this movie for family night.

Looks like it would be a fun little movie- the animation looked great, decent sound, etc..  UNTIL it got to about the 19 minute mark, then it started freezing, stuttering, spitting, and then froze up totally!  I tried EVERYTHING to get it past that point.  Fast forwarding, skipping ahead, going to the scene selection, etc.  I cannot access ANYTHING past the 19 minute mark!  I even let the thing sit the next day, thinking maybe the buffer could get past that point, no luck.  After about 5 minutes of sitting, it goes back to the menu.

I very recently updated the firmware on the Blu Ray player.

I've had numerous problems with Sony DVD's and Blue Ray disks in the past.  They write these movies so that they mainly work with Sony products!!

Also, a big reason for so many SONY problems is that they write the movies to be VERY copy-protected.  To the point of stupidity!!  I know this because I have a friend whom is an industry insider.

I have 3 DVD players in our home, and 1 Blu Ray player, and this has been an on-going problem.  Our Sony DVD player is usually in our basement study, and I typically have to go down and fetch it if we want to watch a SONY dvd in our living room!  Our other DVD players are a Panasonic and a Toshiba.  These players are nice, newer, higher end players, and they NEVER have any problems playing any other disks!  But if I put a SONY disk in there, I know there are going to be problems!

Now the older SONY disks are usually okay, but any movie released in the last couple of years, big problems.

Back to the Blu Ray- our Oppo player never has any other problems with any other movies at all.  We watch 5 blu ray movies a week minimum, and only ever have problems with SONY Blu Rays!

And I can certainly say that we will NOT be purchasing a SONY Play Station 3 just so that we can watch the SONY movies!

Based on these experiences, we made a decision a long time ago that we do not buy SONY products.

Terrible form, SONY.",1266451200,2,2013,4.25065963060686

3817721,5,B001UV4XY2,"2009 was really a great year for movies, with blockbusters in many genres being released almost every month.  For kids, the end of the year brought this animated masterpiece; probably Sony's best animated film.  Though based of a book, it is still a very original movie for cartoons.  The story is simple enough, a geeky  nerd growing up on an island builds device that converts atmospheric moisture into food to go.  Of course, like any good cartoon, the machine goes awry and our protagonists must team up to save their home.  The animation is good, but not meant to be jaw-droppping realism.  The soundtrack is good, and the dialogue is snappy.  Probably the best part is the humor; everything from the predatory rotisserie chickens to the father's eyebrows are all original humor.  I guess when you make a movie about food, you have to cross out the jokes about pies in the face as they would be to cliche.
Overall, a wonderful movie, and my bet for best cartoon of 2009; yes even better than Pixar's Up.",1266105600,,1008,4.649717514124294

 Cloudy is without a doubt a movie for the whole family to watch together. I really liked how Flint finally invented something that everyone thought was awesome. But with something awesome comes consequences..which ended up being the not so good kind.

3817749,4,B001UV4XY2,"Based on Judi Barrett's 1978 children's book of the same name, CLOUDY WITH A CHANCE OF MEATBALLS hits the right spot for kids and adults alike. It is whimsical almost to the point of such old cartoons as The Road Runner and Popeye. Which I found to be a refreshing break from the more in-your-face animated features that try to stuff political/social commentary down our gullets (see WALL-E and HAPPY FEET as two that did this to an extreme degree). Now I'm not saying that we shouldn't try and educate little Johnny and Jane, but we should, sometimes, give their minds a break and allow them a moment of sheer entertainment. And CWaCoMB does that.

Take one part kid scientist-wannabe and add to the mix an intelligent weather forecaster and a father who wants his son to join the family business, and you get spaghetti tornadoes, cheeseburger hailstorms, and Jello castles. Yep. That's the type of whimsy I'm talking about.

Bill Hader (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Tropic-Thunder/dp/B001H5X7KC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Tropic Thunder</a>) stars as the voice for Flint Lockwood, the crazy kid scientist who's creations seem to go wrong more often than not. But his one creation, a machine that mutates water into food, is a resounding success. That is, until something goes terribly wrong. But before it does, Flint meets up with sexy newscaster Sam Sparks (Anna Faris,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/My-Super-Ex-Girlfriend/dp/B000J4QW8Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">My Super Ex-Girlfriend</a>), who caught a break and is on the scene in Flint's sardine stricken town when his new machine launches itself into the stratosphere and starts making it rain food. Sam is very excited by this astronomical development. But on Flint's other side is his father, Tim (James Caan), who only wants his son to stop these ridiculous experiments and get into the family bait and tackle business.

As Flint's machine begins raining down watermelons instead of water, the people of Flint's town become enamored with their new whiz kid and the world's interest in their little corner of the globe.

I felt the animation (while excellent) was aimed at a younger audience with its bright colors and simplified lines (the book is more subdued). I found it interesting, though, how the elements of the book were integrated into a clever story. The characters' actions were often over-the-top, but I loved the dialog.  I thought the choice of voices excellent and those voices along with the many quick references (that must have gone over most kids' heads) were what made the movie for me. I could find many less amusing ways to fill a couple of hours.",1264982400,,675,4.65546218487395
3817751,5,B001UV4XY2,"Flint Lockwood (Bill Hader) is an inventor. Well, he wants to be an inventor, but everything he invents starts off appearing to work before going strangely or horribly awry. The town he lives in of Swallow Falls has been eating nothing but sardines for years, so Flint turns his attention to creating an invention that turns water into food. When the invention works, Flint goes from being a bumbling nerd to one of the most important people in town as his machine rains down food on Swallow Falls three times a day. But when his invention gains a mind of it's own, Flint has to stop it before it tries to destroy the world.

Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs was a best selling children's book written in 1978 by Judi Barrett. And in a year that saw it's fair share of children's books turned to movies (Fantastic Mr. Fox, Where the Wild Things Are, Inkheart, Coraline, Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince, etc.) it only seemed right that this book would see it's day come in the theater this year as well. Of course, when turning a beloved children's book into a movie you typically wouldn't expect the studios to turn to a pair of largely untested writers/ directors with the adaptation. But that's what they did when they picked Phil Lord and Chris Miller (How I Met Your Mother, Clone High, etc.) to direct the movie. Having written and directed for TV they didn't really seem like they would be the top choice to take on a project of this magnitude.

But in the end they were the perfect auteurs to take on this project. Part of what really sets this movie apart from a lot of animated movies that come out nowadays is the ridiculousness of the proceedings. Where most animated movies these days tries to base some of their world in reality, Cloudy seems to take more of it's queues from the slapstick of Looney Tunes and other cartoons that came before it. Of course it also helps that this movie also has a voice cast of comedic actors (Bill Hader, Andy Samberg, Will Forte, Neill Patrick Harris, Anna Faris), actors that have become parodies of themselves and are willing to play off the parody (Mr. T, Al Roker), and just plain great actors (James Caan, Benjamin Bratt, Bruce Campbell) to help this movie get over the top without actually being too over the top to keep your interest. At no point does this movie feel like it's veering perilously close to going over the edge, and with a somewhat sentimental ending, it stays just silly enough to keep from being mired in a sugar overload. Visually, like a lot of computer animated features that have come out this year, the movie looks like it could be claymation or another form of stop motion animation, giving it that extra dimension of realism (although I didn't see it in 3D, you could see the effects of the 3D on the 2D version of the movie.

I highly recommend this movie. As an animated feature it's refreshing to see an animated feature that has humanity, while also having a certain playfulness that seems to be lost on a lot of movies these days. Give it a try, I know I'm going to end up buying it.

Stamping the front of the case with ""DIGITAL COPY"" and tagging 'psp Digital Copy' in the middle of 6 paragraphs of text on the back of the case certainly seems to be deceptive to me.  Now I am stuck with a USELESS DIGITAL COPY!  We do not own any PSPs and Sony's blatant attempt to leverage what is after all a pretty good kids' movie to boost a lagging hardware platform is quite disappointing.  Sony would have been much better off including a PSP copy as an optional format along with the standard windows media or itunes formats.  Since Sony only seems to listen when masses of users complain I am rating this movie 1 star and warning everyone I come across about this so-called 'Digital Copy' - more like 'PS3/PSP Copy'.

3817795,1,B001UV4XY2,"First off, this review is for the Blu-ray/DVD/Digital Copy only.  The movie itself has already been reviewed.

I do not normally spend this much for a movie, even on Blu-ray, but my daughter loves this movie... So we bought it tonight.  I am very disappointed with Sony and I believe that many more people need to mark this as 1 star until Sony fixes the situation (especially since Sony's own site points to Amazon for the purchase of this movie on Blu-ray.)  My review will therefore be in 3 parts: Blu-ray, DVD and Digital Copy.

Blu-ray: The best part of this disc is the BD (Blu-ray Disc) and the picture and audio are perfect.  Also, this disc played flawlessly in my player.  So I give the BD 5 Stars.

DVD: Nice copy of the movie taking the maximum space for a DVD so it converts nicely to any other format for iPhone, iPod, etc but that is why we purchase a triple format package, so we don't have to convert... So I give the DVD 5 Stars.

Which leads me to the next section and the reason for the overall 1 Star rating:

Digital Copy:  What a joke!  This only works on a Playstation 3 from the BD and only works with the PSP.  So 99% of all users that purchase the disc for a digital copy to run on their Mac/PC/iPhone/iPod are just left in the cold.  Nice going Sony!  This is absolutely unacceptable!  One could say that Sony's Digital Copy amounts to false advertising and bring a class action law suit against Sony (again). Since Sony only seems to respond with people get ticked off at them, I think more people need to rate this 1 star until Sony offers a free download of the movie in a format that actually works or remove the words Digital Copy from all future titles!",1263340800,13,1687,4.32484076433121
3817796,4,B001UV4XY2,"I always approach animated kid's fare with an odd combination trepidation and hopeful desire. Too often, what should be an amusing tidbit for children turns out to be a flaccid vehicle for a ""star"" (I'm thinking Bee Movie) or an inexcusable political commentary (like Wall-E or Happy Feet.) But happily, I was completely delighted with CLOUDY WITH A CHANCE OF MEATBALLS.

The list of voice actors for CLOUDY WITH A CHANCE OF MEATBALLS is impressive, reading like a list of SNL alums and more. My favorite, OF COURSE, was Mister T, whose character sported an inverse Mohawk. But the voice actors had a lot to work with here. The script for CLOUDY WITH A CHANCE OF MEATBALLS is creative and clever, as are many of the sight-gags. The animation and the 3-D are both respectable and the 3-D is not abused (or necessary, really.) Visually, what struck me even more than the food falling from the sky was the colors. I know that sounds odd, but even the Columbia logo at the start was exceptionally rich. And once the food machine kicks in, that richness is spread across the town.

The writers really did a great job of turning a cute little kids book into a cute little movie. The only thing keeping me form awarding it 5 stars is that it does quite rise to the level of Cars or Up. Even so, this is a movie I will undoubtedly see many times.  In fact, my four and a half year old is so enamored of this movie, that we have already had repeated viewings.  CLOUDY WITH A CHANCE OF MEATBALLS is her new favorite, and I have to admit, I am not yet minding the repeat performances.",1263340800,3,1573,4.432525951557094

Really Sony, how much effort is there in presenting the story in a way that actually educates - in some very small way. For example, water always will be water & hydrogen & oxygen - that's it. There's no nitrogen, no genetic material. Anyway, it takes ""work"" for a studio to create a fantasy story that has a magical and, perhaps, believable quality to it.

3817799,5,B001UV4XY2,"This is a hilarious story told on several levels and appealing to the whole family. It references various movies and advertisements from the last 40 or so years which keep you spotting things, is slyly humourous, and is wonderfully animated. My 6 and 7 year girls loved it, and so did I. Fact everyone does that I know. It has messages about everything, from bullying, to wasting food, to envirconmental issues - but all told with such good humour that they make you laugh too.

Story of a young mad inventor (he invented spray on shoes, you just can't get them off again) and a ex-nerd weather reporter) and small island whose sole industry is sardine fishing and canning, until the world realises that actually sardines are really yucky.

He invents a machine that can turn water into food - while subversively hooking the machine up to the towns power generator he inadvertently rockets it into the sky where it causes a cheeseburger storm. He realises that he can harness the energy by beaming messages to it via sattelite - now the town gets all its food rained down on it - and all the waste is scooped up and thrown into a town dump concealed behind a damn on the outskirts of town where they don't have to see it.

Of course things go wrong, there is a mad mayor, and everyone wanting their choice of food raining down and as the machine goes out of control it is up to an intrepid group to fly into the sky in a modified car (the difference between this flying car and the one he tried to make before, is this one has wings!) But the machine has got a life of its own (queue 2001 a space odyssey) and it looks like teh Death star (star wars). Even the food has gone bad - that is, the food which has been created tries to attack them - the attack of the roasted chickens was both wildly funny and mildly disquieting.

However, all works out ok in the end.

There are so many bits and pieces in this movie that add colour and perspective to it and pad it out into a truly great movie. The inventors best buddy is a Monkey called Steve and he has a thought analyser which expresses what he is thinking. Usually the words ""Steve"" or ""Lick""  or something equally banal. The town's previous star was 'baby Brent' who appeared on all the packs of Sardines in a coppertone style add. Now a grossly overweight man with a mullet haircut, he still strips off wearing a nappy for openings etc - only his body fat judders when he does.

I really loved the small animations which made the characters so expressive. The father doesn't really change expression - yet the animators have relied on really tiny alterations of body language to show what he is thinking. Quite wonderfully done.

I could go on about the cleverness, the colour, the texture of this, the rapid dialogue both at the forefront and in the background. But take my word for it, this movie is GREAT - and you will enjoy it immensely. i am off to buy the book next.",1263168000,4,2928,4.38929889298893

3817801,5,B001UV4XY2,"Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs is just a hilarious movie. I've watched this movie several times, and each time I watch it, there is something new and funny that I notice.

CWACOM is about an aspiring inventor, Flint Lockwood (Bill Hader), and his attempts to live up to the legacies of the greatest inventors in history. Flint is a grown-up child whose eccentric behavior is only bested by his enthusiasm to create the greatest invention mankind has ever known.

So far, his inventions have only been notorious for ending in disaster -- either personally (the spray-on shoes he applied in class, only to find out they would not come off), or for the entire town (the ratbirds that escaped and bred at an alarming rate).

His pursuit of this legacy is stymied by Earl Deveraux (Mr. T), a local cop who has his eye on Flint, and is half-superhero; and his Father, Tim (James Caan), a Sardine Bait & Tackle shop owner who is losing faith in his son's ability to invent anything meaningful, and wants him to work in the tackle shop. Tim is a very strong character, one of the funniest, and he does it without trying (he delivers some of the funniest ""lines"" in the movie without uttering a word.)

For his latest invention, Flint is working on the ""Flint Lockwood Diatonic Super Mutating Dynamic Food Replicator,"" or FLDSMDFR for short (pronounced FLI-dis-m'duh-fur). Once the FLDSMDFR works, water will go in the top, and the food of your choice will come out at the bottom. Flint just needs a little more power, and the town will no longer be stuck eating the sardines that the world recently declared to be ""super gross.""

Cloudy does not have a single dull moment. If you blink, you might miss one of the most hilarous parts of the movie, but there are so many of those instances that it's hard to say when that would be. It's chock-full of sight gags, wacky sound effects, stupidly great jokes & puns, and Flint Lockwood's nerdy attempts to impress weathergirl Sam Sparks (Anna Faris) with his intelligence, humor, or his claim to have an allergy in common with her.

The animation can only be described as Ren & Stimpy meets Warner Brothers, meets Muppets. You also have the hilarious Looney Tunes-esque sound effects, intentionally ""lame"" humor, ironic use of disaster movie cliche's (weather anchor Patrick (Al Roker) even observes that the storm is ""following an unusual pattern of hitting all of the worlds major landmarks first, and then spreading across the rest of the globe,"") and an awesome soundtrack by Devo's Mark Mothersbaugh to give it the 80's retro-futuristic tone.

3817846,4,B001UV4XY2,"In 2009, the animated film ""Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs"" was released in theaters.  Adapted from the popular book from 1978 by Judi Barrett and illustrations by Ron Barrett, CWACoM took three years to develop and feature animation by Sony Pictures Animation.

The film adaptation and direction is by Phil Lord and Christopher Miller (both are executive producers of the popular CBS sitcom ""How I Met Your Mother"" and also the MTV animated series ""Clone High"").  Music is by Mark Mothersbaugh (""Fanboys"", ""Mama's Boy"", ""Lords of Dogtown"") and the film is produced by Pam Marsden (producer of ""Dinosaur"" and ""Mickey's Twice Upon a Christmas"").

""Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs"" received positive reviews from critics and debuted at #1 in the box office, raking in $180+ million worldwide.  Now the film gets its first Blu-ray release and includes the Blu-ray, the DVD and a digital copy (a code is provided to download a digital copy from the PlayStation Network) for those who own a Sony PSP or Playstation 3 System.

AUDIO & VIDEO:

""Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs"" is featured in 1080p High Definition and I know that Pixar and DreamWorks animation gets a lot of attention for their animated work but Sony Pictures Animation has done a remarkable job with this film.

The picture quality on HD is absolutely vibrant and colorful.  Water and liquid effects look absolutely terrific and realistic while the detail of the town Swallow Falls during its normal appearance of a seaside town to a town filled with food and sporting different scenery.

In fact, things look absolutely amazing during the second half as we see solid animation being utilized throughout the film.  From the outdoor mayhem to the overall details of the various foods (especially when larger) causing destruction around the town area, it looks absolutely great. Awesome picture quality for this Blu-ray release.

As for the accompanying DVD, the DVD is featured in 169 Full Screen (1:78:1) and also anamorphic widescreen (2:35:1).

As for audio, the Blu-ray is featured in English and French 5.1 DTS-HD MA and Spanish 5.1.  Dialogue is clear and understandable through the front and center channel, music definitely sets the mood as it plays from the front channels but good use of special effects such as the clouds rumbling, the sound of thunder, flying vehicles flying through the clouds through the surround channels.  Good use of LFE for nice low rumbles coming from the subwoofer.

Fans of the film will enjoy the immersive soundtrack from this film as there is very good use of the various channels throughout the film, especially during the film's latter half.

The accompanying DVD is presented in English, French and Spanish 5.1 Dolby Digital.

Subtitles are featured in English, English SDH, French and Spanish.

JUDGMENT CALL:

""Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs"" is an enjoyable family film.  The children will love it and even the adults.  The film is well-written and Sony Pictures Animation really went all out in making sure this film looks visually appealing.  Artistically, the animation and artistic backgrounds are just spectacular.

As mentioned before, there is so much positive press for Pixar films and also DreamWorks animated films but Sony really pulled off an awesome 3D animated film with ""Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs"".  Definitely a unique presentation in terms of characters but it's just the overall look of the film with its vibrant colors and look that gives a fresh feel for this film.

And on HD, the film looks and sounds incredible.  There are a good number of interactive special features and with the Blu-ray coming with the DVD and a digital copy of the film, that's another plus as well.

It's important to note that ""Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs"" is not just visual and audio  eye candy, the film features a solid performance by the voice talent and most of all, a solid screenplay that remains faithful to the popular book.  A lot of humor (safe for children) and for the most part, a fantastic family film that both children and adults will enjoy.

This is possibly the best animated film not made by Disney/Pixar and if anything, Sony Pictures Animation did a wonderful job and I'm definitely looking forward to seeing what film they will be animating next because what they did for ""Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs"" looks magnificent.

Overall, this is a solid Blu-ray release that is just worth having in your collection and a release that is great for the entire family.  Highly recommended!

NOTE: It was announced by Sony during CES that in conjunction with the release of their 3D hardware, they will be releasing ""Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs"" in 3D Blu-ray later in 2010.",1262822400,25,7392,4.99510603588907
3817847,2,B001UV4XY2,Absolutely nowhere did the information for this movie on Amazon state that the digital copy was for PSP via PS3 only.  I never would have pre-ordered this movie if I had known that.  There is a sticker on the cardboard outer cover that states this but the picture on the web shows the case cover that doesn't have the sticker.  Very deceptive.  From now on I will wait for the movie to come out and read reviews to ensure I can use the digital copy where I please.,1262822400,5,464,4.238636363636363
3817848,3,B001UV4XY2,"First, I loved the movie. My complaint is not with the film but with the so called digital copy that is indicated as included on the cover.  The ""Digital Copy"" included with this blu-ray can only be used on a Sony PSP when installed via a Sony PS3.  I often preorder these family movies because I want to have the digital copy for my son to watch on my laptop or iPod. Had I known that this digital copy would not work like every other digital copy I've purchased; I would not have paid retail. I will certainly be thinking twice before purchasing another Sony blu-ray with a ""Digital Copy.""",1262736000,140,591,4.363636363636363
3817849,5,B001UV4XY2,"I enjoyed this movie, I really didn't know what to expect walking in, but I liked it. I read my daughter the book it was based on the night before we went, and nothing was out of place (except for the era), it was just a different perspective. I consider this a genuine nerd flick, not because it's nerdy, but because it portrays nerds with all their shortfalls in a positive light.

I love all of the retro technology references that only someone old enough could appreciate. These references just completely pass by someone who didn't recognize them and not seem out of place.

I stuck around for part of the credits, I KNEW that was Mr. T's voice I heard, and I just had to confirm it. Indeed it was Mr. T in all of his glory, he made a great cop.

/Just an addition beyond the original review. This movies now at the $1.50 theater near me. I watched it again, and I think I actually enjoyed it more by watching it again.

I can't emphasize enough how much this movie portrays the main character Flint Lockwood as a genuine realistic geek/nerd/dork, the whole 9 yard, but they actually portray it positively. Usually those types are secondary characters in movies and often a source of comic relief, and considering the nature of the movie everyone is comic relief, but it's still positive. This just makes my day.

//Here's an even later edit, I added another 1/2 star now that I've bought it on DVD. The more I watch this the more I like it. I watched it with some guys from work - all over the age of 30, some in their 40's and 50's, we all laughed and everybody loved it. I work at at NASA so the people I watched it with qualified as technical people, many as full blown geeks.

The humor was very intelligent - only Kevin Smith rivals this movies ability to make proper use of a running gags.

The use of animal humor was awesome - you could tell what the rat-birds had to say even though they didn't speak.

This fits on the shelf between Monty Python and Kevin Smith where adults are concerned, and next to Shrek where kids are concerned.",1262649600,,2049,4.359580052493438
3817850,2,B001UV4XY2,"Very good movie, liked it in the theater.  I wanted to post this right away, though.  Buyer Beware, digital copy works only on PS3 to download to PSP.  I'm very disappointed.  This is in fine print on the back of the case.  Deceptive on Sony's part.  Really reduces value of Blu ray in my book.",1262649600,90,294,4.254545454545455
3817851,4,B001UV4XY2,"All his life, Flint Lockwood (voiced by Bill Hader) has wanted to be an inventor.  But his inventions have been one disaster after another.  Still, he never gives up, hoping one day to be liked by people in general and loved by his father (James Caan).

Flint lives in the town of Swallow Falls on a little island in the middle of the ocean.  The town is suffering a severe depression since the sardine cannery in town has shut down.  In fact, the residents are now forced to eat the smelly fish.  So Flint decides to make a machine that will turn water into food.

The bad news is the machine gets away from him.  The good news is that it works.  Soon, the residents are enjoying a wide variety of food every day.  But can Flint keep his machine under control?

I would have written this movie off as too childish if it weren't for my roommate, who really wanted to see it.  But I'm glad he talked me into it since it was entertaining.  There were some great laughs, not only at the absurd situations but also at some great sight gags.  In fact, the creative spirit of the original book is certainly evident with some of the gags.

Since it is based on a picture book, they really did have to stretch the story, and a couple of times it showed.  But for the most part, the story moved forward at a steady pace.

The themes of the move are the familiar be true to yourself and love your family.  At times, they were a tad preachy, but for the most part they were an integral part of the story.  They were certainly predictable, and I had most of the character arcs figured out within the first few minutes.

The climax stretches on for a while.  When it finds the characters trying to stop ever bigger problems, that's a good thing.  However, they also shoe horn in some of the character moments, which feel awkward in the middle of the action and ultimately slow things down.

This movie isn't destined for any best of lists, but it is funny.  Kids, the target audience, will love it.  And adults willing to admit that kids' movies can be good will enjoy it at least once.",1262649600,,2073,4.308290155440415
8345201,2,B001UV4XY2,"My kids were not very impressed with this movie. They LOVE the original book, and we were excited to rent the movie for them when it came out. However, the movie seems only very loosely based on the book which was a big disappointment to us. It also is geared towards an older age group than the book is.",1528416000,,304,4.169491525423729
