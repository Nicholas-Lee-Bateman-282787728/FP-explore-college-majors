8036218,5,B000560MBG,"More Precious than Gold: The Mormon Battalion

This video is surprisingly very interesting and well done.  It does not focus so much on the ""longest infantry march in US history,"" but on what the battalion members did after they were released in California (see the other video on the Mormon Battalion that I list below for more information on the actual march).

The presentation starts out with the Mormons in the Midwest during their terrible eviction and subsequent quartering at Council Bluffs, a stopping point on the way to No-Man's Land (Utah).  After repeated appeals for protection to the federal government had been rebuffed, the Mormons were surprised when several federal agents showed up on June 26, 1846 to ask for volunteers for the war against Mexico.  Nearly 500, wanting to prove their loyalty to the US, left their families and enlisted.  They then made the march to Santa Fe, where they reprovisioned and blazed a trail to San Diego. This is where the video really picks up.  After the men were discharged, they went their various ways.  Some immediately headed east to find their families and others north, to San Francisco, where they met up with a group of Mormons who sailed around South America to reach the West (see the video ""Forgotten Voyage"" for more info on the sea voyage).  Their impact on the early history of California was news to me, but is very interesting.  They had a hand in the gold strike at Sutter's Mill and, as they wanted to reunite with their families somewhere to the east, blazed a trail which thousands would use to reach the gold fields.  The going was hard, sometimes a mile a day, but they were ingenious in solving the problem of large rocks and boulders that obstructed their way.  Check out the video!

The video lasts about 15-20 minutes, which is enough, but there is a lot packed into those 15 minutes.  I picked up my copy at a Deseret Bookstore for $5; and it's well worth that price. Highly recommended for anyone interested in Mormon, western or California history.

8036219,5,B000560MBG,"Even in the face of constant attacks and persecution, most of the Mormon Battalion left behind their families to help the nation that had largely turned its back on their own plight - because it was the right thing to do. This great video provides insight into some of their lives, and the great contributions they made to the development of the west.",1103414400,,351,4.587301587301587
