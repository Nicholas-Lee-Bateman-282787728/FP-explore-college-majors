2204769,4,B000784XBW,"When I was growing up, I used to watch Jackie ""Moms"" Mabley on the variety and talk shows of the day (Mike Douglas, Merv Griffin, Ed Sullivan, Hollywood Palace, et al).  I'm glad I never saw her raunchy X-rated nightclub act, though.  In fairness, though, most comedians, with the possible exception of Bill Cosby, are much more X-rated in person than on network TV, and that included the late Bob Hope, whose double entendres could make your hair stand on end, as I heard from people who did see him in person.  The late Rodney Dangerfield was the same way.  If Moms Mabley were on HBO today, she could be just as vulgar as she wanted to be, and no one would blink an eye.

I saw this movie some years ago on a local PBS affiliate.  I taped it off the air and recently decided to buy the DVD.  While the film gets off to a slow start, the pace picks up after the first 40 minutes, with performances by, among others, dancers Stump and Stumpy, The Berry Brothers, and ""Crip"" Heard, singer-pianist Uma Mae Carlisle, bandleader Lucky Millinder, singers ""Bull Moose"" Jackson and Anistine Allen, and Moms herself, who not only performs one of her classic monologues, but also surprises everyone with her tap-dancing ability.

The picture and sound quality are pretty good, considering that this was a low-budget ""race movie"" made for the segregated black audiences of the day.

If you can get through the first 40 minutes, which are a little boring, the performances in the rest of the movie are quite good.",1360540800,6,1503,4.599250936329588
2204770,1,B000784XBW,I came in on the last parts of Moms and knew her as very funny.  She as I remember was on one of the L.Ps that we were not suppose to listen to.  Now that Im older I now know that it wasn't moms but Rudy Ray More.,1358726400,,213,3.4166666666666665
2204771,5,B000784XBW,Its was a back in the day good  History movie. Forgot Moms was a in the movies. I just thought she was a comedian. Jobabe,1358121600,,121,3.84
2204772,1,B000784XBW,"Skip to the last couple of chapters where the talent is displayed.  That's the only thing worth watching.  (The rating reads ""I hate it."")  That language is too strong.  I just didn't like it.",1355702400,,192,4.5588235294117645
2204773,4,B000784XBW,"It was pretty funny. Moms Mabley is a GREAT ACTRESS! Even though it's in Black&White, the content/message is what reaches you.",1345507200,2,126,5.0476190476190474
2204774,5,B000784XBW,"This movie is entertaining.  This is my first time watching this movie and I am really enjoying it because it is clean, peaceful and the actors seem to enjoy performing.  I would love it if it were in color and some scenes cut a portion of the heads off but otherwise its fine.",1323993600,4,277,4.2075471698113205
2204775,1,B000784XBW,"this was a waste of $ ,not at all satisfied with this purchase. wish I could return it or get credit. I recommend NOT buying this item.",1299542400,2,135,4.037037037037037
2204776,4,B000784XBW,"Usually, the old ""Colored Movies"" as they were called in the 1920s to the 1940s, are high in historical value, but low on entertainment.

This film is one of the best of the genre and will leave you feeling mighty good-if you give it a chance.

This is a first cousin to another Black film called ""Killer Diller"" (also on DVD) which was essentially a filmed vaudeville show with a threadbare plot that didn't take itself too seriously. This is made by the same people, and also stars the Queen of Black Comedy-Jackie Moms Mabley, Dusty ""Open the Door Richard"" Fletcher, and the Lucky Millinder Orchestra.

The film starts of with a very stupid intro about Dusty Fletcher sneaking into Moms' boardinghouse with a man in a monkey suit. But don't stop the DVD here or you'll really miss some good stuff! We then get into the ""story"" of Moms trying to save her boardinghouse of vaudeville performers from an evil landlord. Sounds corny? Yes, but Moms' magnetic personality and genuine bond with the other performers makes it work. How to save the house with all this talent? Well DUH....(fill in the blanks, folks).

The talent assembled is outstanding! Johnny Lee (Calhoun from Amos & Andy) is aboard as a stuttering repo man. ""Crip"" Heard, a dancer with only one leg and one arm who occasionally appeared at the Apollo Theater with Moms Mabley at the time, astounds and inspires. The Berry Brothers do some comical dancing, as does the superb Stump and Stumpy (who were said to have inspired Dean and Jerry and also appear uncredited in ""Stormy Weather). Lewis and White turn what would have been a hackneyed vaudeville jokebook routine (with a gag about a horse on drugs that would have never made it into a mainstream ""white"" movie at the time) into a thing to behold, with their inspired delivery and jaw-dropping dance routine. Moms herself goes into her famous monologue act and makes us smile with some added dancing.

The Lucky Milliner band does some beautiful songs and even does some precursors to Rock and roll. Bullmoose Jackson sings ""I Love You Yes I Do"" 14 years before James Brown did it on Live at the Apollo Vol. 1.

By the time it's over, you're almost worn from the great (but largely forgotten and underrated for reasons we all know) talent, but smiling in knowing that in spite of the picture quality and cornball ""plot,"" you've been treated to 90 minutes of some wonderful entertainment that DVD's have rescued from the dustbins of history. Play this and it's companion piece ""Killer Diller"" while in your favorite chair with a nice cold glass after work or on a lazy afternoon, and enjoy!",1192665600,66,2610,4.712719298245614
2204777,4,B000784XBW,This is an old black and white movie for Moms Mabley afficianados.  It's a fun movie with lots of old stuff in it that is long gone but should not be forgotten.  I heartily recommend it.,1176163200,23,186,4.138888888888889
