3157326,3,B0016K31ZE,"The '07 release `Mama's Boy' delivers another fine, though surprisingly reserved performance by Joh Heder as Jeffrey, the insecure, hypochondriac, stay-at-home 29 year old who finds his world threatened when his Mother (Diane Keaton) decides to re-enter the dating scene. When new boyfriend Mert (Jeff Daniels), a life-affirming motivational speaker moves in Jeffrey's world begins to fall apart. Will he accept the newcomer into the family home with open arms or perceive him as a challenger and usurper of his Mother's affection?

There's not a lot of surprises here but it's still an entertaining watch with a soundtrack infused with `The Smiths' and `Morrissey' that work perfectly with the on-screen action. Anna Faris is also quite good as Nora, a Courtney Love(ish) songstress who falls for the hapless Mama's boy caus Jeffery to re-evaluate his sheltered existence even further.

If you're a big Jon Heder fan you'll definitely wan to had this one to your DVD collection, but thoroughly enjoyable even if you're not.

My Rating: -3 1/2 Stars-.",1213401600,10,1051,5.207100591715976

It's too bad, because this really is a pretty good movie, but unfortunately, the movie plays out with the same little formula and by the numbers movie making plot path that we've seen hundreds/thousands of times.

Jon Heder plays 29-year old Jeffrey Manus, a well... (see title) Mama's Boy. When Mom decides it's time to start dating again, it puts a wrinkle in Jeffrey's otherwise comfortable pampered homelife. Then of course when the dating becomes serious, Jeffrey's life is turned upside down.

There really is no way to give away spoilers because we've seen these movies playout thousands of times. Sure, maybe it's a different premise, but the plot points are so much on point, you could put a stop watch to them. Boy runs into problem, boy plots to defeat problem, boy messes things up, boy realizes the airs in his ways, boy corrects problem in about 5 minutes of film time and rides off into the sunset.

It's not a bust out funny film, although I did a couple of times, and it's not a bad film. Anna Faris was cute. Jeff Daniels was funny. Jon Heder was well cast. Diane Keaton was solid as usual. Yet, unfortunately for all of them, Mama's Boy will be forgotten because it didn't have the guts to tell a story as unique as the characters they portrayed.",1212883200,7,1274,4.574561403508772

They both go into a ""war"" with each other to win the moms love.  A very funny prank war too.  While this goes on a very free spirited hippy like girl falls for the son.  She however see's the war and mom love as WAY TOO much.  A young guy has to grow up fast or lose everyone including his mom.

8262859,1,B0016K31ZE,"You look at the cast and the premise of this movie and think, this should be good and at the very least you can expect a few hearty laughs.  But it never fulfills that promise.  In fact, it's not good for any laughs.  You may send a thank you note because I've saved an hour and a half of your life by sitting through the ENTIRE movie against my better judgment by about 30 minutes into it

Heder is horribly cast here.  His nerdy dry approach does not fit and the script, though seemingly written with him in mind, does him no favors.  Diane Keaton, try as she may, has absolutely nothing to work with in her part as the mother of a 29 year-old son who still lives at home.  The script is THAT bad.  I wonder why she said yes to the role.  Jeff Daniels gives it his best as the sudden romantic interest of Keaton's character, but a really poor script can make any actor look bad and this production had a really bad script.  Plus the production just moves SO slowly and banks on cheap funny moments.  Spoiler:  They NEVER happen.  The holder of funny moments is completely bankrupt in this one.

This is a movie you tell your worst enemy at work to rent over the weekend.  And then you come back Monday and snicker because you wasted a solid hour and a half of their free time.

If you're looking to fall asleep to a movie that will not hold your interest, Mama's Boy is the right show for you.  Looking for a film worth watching?  Look somewhere else.

I can only think that the feeble attempts at good reviews I've seen are prompted by the money behind the film, hoping that they can squeeze a few more bucks out of the big names and the hope for a movie worth watching.  Don't fall for it.",1437436800,,1693,4.198757763975156
