Truly ahead of it's time in content and ingenuity. The underwater sequences  alone are worth the price! Excellent supporting cast,especially Adolfo Celi  as Largo and Luciana Paluzzi as Fiona.

699853,5,6303651488,"One of my favorite all-time Bond films.  It's pretty amusing to watch Thunderball and Never Say Never Again, back to back.  Anyway, the old films look excellent on Blu Ray format.  I would probably buy one of the boxed sets, if you don't already have some of the other Bond movies on Blu Ray format.  It would be less expensive and you would save space by purchasing an all inclusive package. But, if you are just buying individual titles in order to fill the gaps and upgrade your collection, I would wait until around the holidays where these single re-issues are likely to be on sale and you can snatch up several titles for cheap.",1506384000,,634,4.48695652173913

699917,5,6303651488,"Bond, James Bond is alive and well, over  50 years after this film was done up for us as preteens.  He has grown from the iconic Male chauvinist to the evensteven partner and sometimes even the lady's victim...ouch.

Thunderball - this film's undersea battle is still rated among the top ones of all time - but I liked the ""moments""  -
 remembering how everyone on campus had a mink glove or access to one, after this film - fun memory.

And how many of the ""gimmicks"" were brand new at the time - the amazing jet pack flying suit is still a topic of conversation and excitement for those who now chase the hoverboard;  and then neat ""discipline"" gimmick for  the embezzling Spectre agent #9 - and Domino's brother's lookalike surgery,  and the bombs and their robbery, and the famous "" Do you mind if my partner rests here for a moment - she'd ""Just DEAD"" when the villainess is shot by her own men aiming for Bond - and then Domino's  "" I killed him - I'm glad I killed him""  line when she gets Largo .  A perfectly perfect take from  "" you killed him - I'm  glad you killed him""  quoted from Melanie  in Gone with the Wind , to Scarlett, when  she shoots the home invading soldier as he tries to harm her - ""right between the eyes"" as her paw would have taught her.

Yes - we are amused.",1506124800,,1290,4.217213114754099

699919,5,6303651488,"Another excellent James Bond film looking at men of international crime.  A very realistic villain emerges here in this fourth James Bond film.

 Bond's crime nemesis Emilio Largo has a seaside home in Nassau out of which he runs a nuclear weapons theft operation.  His small crew are able to conceal the warheads easily,  and almost escaped detection if it weren't for Bond's excellent tracking instinct and bravery.

True to the 007 film franchise formula,  this movie has all the gizmos and equipment that 1950's and  60's Westerners were convinced would be in high demand such as hydrofoils and jetpacks and that sort of thing.  Unfortunately the jetpack has fallen into disfavor as a mainstream idea.  Though a lot of the tech in Thunderball has  fallen into disfavor, still it was very cool nonetheless to journey back through the era before I was born and see how people embraced the future.

In summary,  this 007 movie follows on the heels of other excellent ones that set the bar very high. Also, the underwater photography and ensuing action sequences are really excellent,  which adds immensely to the enjoyment of the move.  I would consider watching this again after a short time just for the shocking diving action sequences the end of the film alone. However,  there are other aspects of this movie that kept my attention as well,  such as the feeling that Ian Fleming's work inspires us not to underestimate the deviousness and creativity of criminal minds.  Though we sent a man to the moon, and are optimists by nature,  the plot stays grounded in the reality that Bond almost doesn't prevail at several junctures against a nuclear madman.  To Fleming, Broccoli,  and Saltzman's credit, they seem to convey an important subtlety well: though the MI6 team thought failure was unimaginable,  it also doesn't mean mission accomplishment was guaranteed, or failure is impossible.",1504224000,,1894,4.984025559105431

699922,5,6303651488,"Of the first four Bond films this one is a powerhouse from the get-go.  Even the pre-credit section gets you going with the music, the art, the visuals.  Thunderball really put it all together for this franchise. It was, and still is, literally a thunderball of a production.  Everyone is included in this and everyone shows up and delivers.  There is a real serial moving story here from beginning to middle to end.  From the Bell Rocket Belt, to more of the Aston Martin, to the gadgets and sheer style.  Who can forget ""Huit pour la banque. Pass the shoe.""  Bond has been his best in the casinos.  It is a real education.

This franchise has always been big on Fords, too, and used the hot car(s) of the time such as the Mustang.  Part of the ""special relationship"" we have had with our British cousins.

I did not see any AMPAS marks on the jewel box, but there is no way this should not have won an OSCAR in some category -- especially a whiz-bang technical category.

This surpasses the third very impressive installment, ""Goldfinger,"" and is probably one of the best ever of the Bond Franchise.",1503100800,,1101,4.505050505050505

700028,4,6303651488,"Thunderball is one of the best of the James Bond movies. Although it was filmed in the 1965, the technology and action scenes still look good 50 years later (I bought the DVD in 2017). In this film James Bond is played by Sean Connery, who I think did the best portrayal of Bond. The plot revolves around the stealing of nuclear bombs by Spectre, the nefarious group that opposes Bond in several other of the films. The underwater fight sequences are spectacular  even recent films have trouble topping them. The Bond girl in this movie is played by actress Claudine Auger; excellent casting. A classic Bond film throughout; much better than many of the other Bond films. I think Thunderball and Goldfinger are among the best two Bond films made.",1495152000,3,746,4.694656488549619

the sound balancing is totally whack. Public areas/festivals are excruciatingly loud, but conversations are barely perceptible. I like movies loud, but this was ridiculous. I couldn't hear some of the conversations but then had to cut volume in half to endure the festival scenes.

Side note: If you have a fear of shark attack while in an inland pool . . . you may have acquired it from thunderball!",1492128000,,430,4.876712328767123

Claudine Auger (former Miss France 1958) is the beautiful girl, Celi is the evil villain.  Connery really has Bond down well at this point in his career and he acts it!  Although almost NO Bond movie could be ""real"" this is about a close to feasible as any Bond movie gets.

700033,5,6303651488,"The fourth of the Connery Bonds.  No gender confused political correctness here!  This was 1965 when the cars were as big as ocean liners, the women were hot as heck with cleavage to spare, the men weren't fantasizing about wearing dresses (ahem bruce jenner) and nobody was worried about offending anyone's ultrasensitive sociopolitical feelings.  Martine Beswick played Paula one of Bond's associates, looked great in a bikini.  Luciana Paluzzi plays Fiona one of spectres female assassins and Bond's nemesis.  Claudine Auger as Domino, Largo's girlfriend also looks good in a bikini.  What am I saying, has there ever been a Bond movie where the women looked bad in a bikini???  Adolfo Celi played Largo, spectre's number 2 guy in the organization in charge of stealing a couple of nukes from a NATO training flight which Spectre was going to use to extort money out of the British government or have two randomly picked cities incinerated. This was Connery's fourth turn as Bond and probably the turning point for him with the franchise.  By this time his portrayal of Bond was honed to perfection and the franchise was a well oiled money making machine but his relationship with producers Harry Saltzman and Cubbi Broccoli was starting to unravel and he was becoming disenchanted with the role.  I think they were trying to match Goldfinger's level of gadgetry with all the underwater scenes but it didn't quite cut it.  He would appear again in 1967's You Only Live Twice where he quits the series.  The Connery era of the series is my favorite because I think he perfectly exemplified the sixties with his look, mannerisms and how he conducted himself as Bond.  Bond to me is a product of the cold war and belongs in the sixties, the farther away we get from the sixties the less believable the character of Bond becomes.  Connery reprised his Thunderball role in a 1983 remake of the film titled Never Say Never Again.  Hard core Bond fans don't consider this a true Bond film though because it wasn't made by Eon Productions.",1489449600,,2034,4.824207492795389

700129,5,6303651488,"Thunderball (1965) could've easily have been something like Goldfinger, just to play it safe after the critical acclaim of that film. However, Thunderball boldly goes off on its own, and takes things a step further with some very different concepts and settings. In this film, there are several underwater sequences that to me are very interesting, and actually pretty tense and suspenseful, contrary to what some people say. Some people think the underwater sequences slow the film down; I beg to differ, as I think they're completely relevant and necessary to the plot and suspense of the film. I think that Thunderball is a very well-crafted and very cerebral offering in the James Bond franchise, and especially right after Goldfinger. Sharks, beautiful women, good plot, and unusual settings make Thunderball one of the better Bond films; I like to think of it as having a little bit of everything from the first three films, while standing on its own as a very unique film. Sean Connery is stellar as usual, as is the villain. The special features are very good, too. Thunderball comes highly recommended in the James Bond canon.",1483315200,,1135,4.978947368421053

Your ""Goofs"" for Scene 30 Starts at 1:08.01 where it's stated that ""the speedometer is from a GM vehicle not a Ford."" is incorrect. It is a Ford speedometer from a 1965 Mustang Coupe. In 1965 the Mustang used the same dash and speedometer as the Ford Falcon. It was not until the 1966 model year that the Ford Mustang had its own dash with a round speedometer. Now I have to check out every goof to make sure it's not just another case of someone not knowing their cars or other historic references that are actually correct. Even though I knew the speedometer was correct for the car, it still only took 15 seconds to Google the images and information. For all I know the Mustang might have been what's termed as a 1964 1/2 Mustang or a late prototype since Thunderball was released in 1965.",1478908800,,886,4.469135802469136

700936,5,6303651488,"The film is different from the recent Bond films, but they are from a different era and cannot be compared.  Sean Connery is absolutely charming and charismatic.  Daniel Craig is equally perfect for the modern 007 roles.

I love 60's cinema, the 70's less so, and the 80's just kinda stunk.  It's film's like this that make me love the 60's.  There are certain special effects that are available for modern film that weren't around then.  There is a scene where Bond is escaping with a rocket backpack and you can actually see the supporting cables.  This does not take away from the movie.

I won't give away any plot points, but Sean Connery is what really makes this movie special.  I admit to Daniel Craig being my favorite 007 agent, but Connery comes in as a close second.  If you can tear  yourself away from modern effects and try to appreciate this film (and the others) for what they are, I think you will be pleasantly surprised.",1477958400,,940,4.535714285714286
700937,5,6303651488,"Old, very old, James Bond fan here. By the time Thunderball rolled around, John Barry's queues had improved along with the quality of the film's production. While the scripts still did not reflect Fleming's stories that well, they were clever and witty enough to be entertaining. Bond in the casino wearing a tux has come to typify what we expect of the bon vivant. Then there are his double entendre - well, he got the point - that now are just something to wince at, if you'll excuse my phrasing. Between John Barry's score, Ken Adams' sets, and Maurice Binder's now famous title opening (first fully nude woman in a feature film) plus Connery at his Bond best, you have - in my mind at least - the best Bond of them all. Spectre's scene in the opening is so deliciously evil that Mike Meyers parodied the scene in Austin Powers. Now that's a compliment.",1477526400,,856,4.529032258064516

The movie stays pretty close to Flemmings source material which is a major positive as I think Thunderball is one of his best books.

701356,5,6303651488,"THUNDERBALL is a very nostalgic and endearing classic James Bond Film. This film somehow sums up that feeling of nostalgia and endearment for the way it engulfed audiences, myself included, into the wonderful world of James Bond. Sean Connery did it with such effortless and natural charm and aplomb like no other. He's a tough and resourceful blunt instrument with a level of intelligence and sophistication still impressive to this day. The world of THUNDERBALL is elegant where the villains live an opulent style of life that is a veneer for their sinister plans that threaten the free world. In a bit of irony James Bond lives in that same world and he is up to the challenge to foil whatever mayhem they concoct.

After a one-film hiatus SPECTRE returns. So too has Sean Connery, as he was finally groomed to perfection as the definitive screen incarnation of James Bond in GOLDFINGER. Terence Young is also back as director. However, he seems to have been influenced over the fine-tuning that Guy Hamilton brought to the main character and overall tone of GOLDFINGER. Due to that film's success Young seems to be floundering here just a bit, being diverted from his vision of the character that he helped bring to the screen. Young is 180 degrees from being the auteur he envisioned himself to be. The film seems loosely constructed and leisurely acted. Adolfo Celi as Emilio Largo looks the part, but he never seems a real threat to Bond. In fact, Largo seems to lose every encounter with Bond whether it be at the gambling tables or engaging in idle banter on the merits of women vs. guns. Bond outdoes him in skeet shooting without even looking at the target. Bond shows signs of becoming a bit of a clich&eacute; with amusing bravado and a definite tongue in cheek.

What makes the film very memorable is John Barry's rich score and Lamar Boren's beautiful and colorful underwater photography and production designer Ken Adams distinctive set designs. They all went hand in hand. I also thought the villains' plot to hijack a Vulcan jet was extremely well filmed and executed. This film has a very British feel to as it should have. Going back to John Barry's impressive and complex score for THUNDERBALL, it is here that he truly puts his inimitable stamp on the entire musical sound for the series. During that period THUNDERBALL was followed by his scores for YOU ONLY LIVE TWICE, ON HER MAJESTY'S SECRET SERVICE and the lighter sounding, yet lavish DIAMONDS ARE FOREVER. The scores for these four James Bond films, are richly textured, meticulously scored for each required scene and are emotionally charged. Ken Adam set the look of the James Bond series with his futuristic set designs beginning with DR. NO and continued with GOLDFINGER. These were highly visual hallmarks of unique craftsmanship.  Immediately following THUNDERBALL came his crowning achievement in YOU ONLY LIVE TWICE.

Sean Connery as James Bond became a cultural icon with THUNDERBALL and gained international superstar status. THUNDERBALL was more than just a film; it was an event. For me, Sean Connery is the inimitable screen version of James Bond.",1461196800,,3139,4.905838041431262

702884,4,6303651488,"Originally my favorite Bond movie when I was a kid.  The underwater battle is still spectacular and looks amazing even today.  But upon watching the rest of the Sean Connery Bond movies as an adult , I agree with a lot of other reviewers that this installment seems a little lacking.  It has all the Bond elements and even a deadly female assassin but I would not say it was as good as Goldfinger, Dr. NO, or From Russia With Love.  It is about on par with Diamonds Are Forever and You Only Live Twice.

That is not to say Thunderball is not an exciting Bond movie it definitely is.  The beginning has a great opening.  The middle of the film seems to lag a little bit.  What I did like about the movie is the scene where M addresses all 9 of the 00 agents and scolds Mr. Bond ""Now that we are all here"" classic I love it.

Domino is a beautiful Bond girl but I don't know if I would rate her higher than any of the other Bond beauties from the Connery era.  I think it would be great to know which actress Sean thought was the best looking and easiest to work with.  We also get to see more of #1 Blofeld as he addresses the other members of Spectre.  I am still waiting for a Bond movie to place future villains in that room that we will see in other movies later on.  I think that would have been a spectacular idea to see #5 or #3 as the lead villain in the next couple of Bond movies.  Alas it did not playout like that but it would have been a great idea.",1453248000,2,1461,4.010380622837371

703055,4,6303651488,"We just recently decided to delve into the Sean Connery James Bond films. We went into Thunderball appreciating that it was a landmark film in terms of cinematography for the time; it's the only film I've seen that outdoes 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea in terms of underwater choreography. We also knew that Thunderball wasn't on any top ten Bond films lists so we didn't expect too much from it, aside from entertainment. It certainly delivered in that department and we were swept away in an undersea adventure that was tastefully and masterfully executed. I particularly enjoyed that Domino had a bit more complexity than the standard Bond girl. It's not one of the best of the Connery era but it's certainly a great entry and far, far better than the campy nightmares that the Roger Moore films became. Even though many people site Goldfinger as the best Bond film of all time, I actually enjoyed this one a bit more.",1442188800,,920,4.720496894409938
703056,3,6303651488,"This film is where I really started to understand that the James Bond 007 franchise was never going to end.

Even as a kid, when I saw the first Roger Moore James Bond film ""Live and Let Die"" I knew then, that James Bond was going to be a part of my life, for the rest of my life.

This great film was even made into a remake with Sean Connery as James Bond, called ""Never Say Never Again"" in which I love watching both of side by side because this way you get a chance to see how technology incorporates itself into what is modern day art in the theater.

I'm not too crazy about today's current James Bond franchise, but at least up to Pierce Brosnan's ""Die Another Day"" I will cherish every film from then and back.

Daniel Craig isn't quite representing the James Bond I grew up with. But that's OK. I'm happy to end my 007 film library now.",1440633600,,845,4.134146341463414

703290,5,6303651488,"THUNDERBALL is a very Nostalgic and Endearing early Bond Film. This film somehow sums up a feeling of nostalgia and endearment for the way it engulfed audiences, myself included, into the wonderful world of James Bond. Sean Connery did it with such effortless and natural charm and aplomb like no other. He's a tough and resourceful blunt instrument with a level of intelligence sophistication still impressive to this day. The world of THUNDERBALL is elegant where the villains live an opulent style of life which is a veneer for their sinister plans. In a bit of irony James Bond lives in that same world and he is up to the challenge to foil whatever mayhem they concoct.

After a one-film hiatus SPECTRE returns. So has Sean Connery as he was finally groomed to perfection as the definitive screen incarnation of James Bond in GOLDFINGER. Terence Young is also back as director. However, he seems to have been influenced over the fine-tuning that Guy Hamilton brought to the main character and overall tone of GOLDFINGER. Due to that film's success Young seems to be floundering here being diverted from his vision of the character that he helped bring to the screen. Young is 180 degrees from being the auteur he envisioned himself to be. The film seems loosely constructed and leisurely acted. Adolfo Celi as Emilio Largo looks the part but he never seems a real threat to Bond. In fact he seems to lose every encounter with Bond whether it be at the gambling tables or engaging in idle banter on the merits of women vs. guns. Bond outdoes him in skeet shooting without even looking at the target.

What makes the film very memorable is John Barry's rich score and Lamar Boren's beautiful and colorful underwater photography. The two went hand in hand. I also thought the villains' plot to hijack a Vulcan jet was extremely well filmed and executed. This film has a very British feel to as it should have. Going back to John Barry's impressive and complex score for THUNDERBALL, it is here that he truly puts his inimitable stamp on the entire sound for the series during that period that were followed by his scores for YOU ONLY LIVE TWICE, ON HER MAJESTY'S SECRET SERVICE and the lighter sounding, yet lavish DIAMONDS ARE FOREVER. The scores for these four James Bond films, are richly textured, meticulously scored for each required scene and are emotionally charged.",1424736000,,2376,4.7926829268292686

703292,5,6303651488,This is one of the best 007 features ever.  Sean Connery IS James Bond!,1424217600,,71,4.071428571428571
703293,5,6303651488,"While it gets off to a slow start - the preposterous jet pack escape from a French castle is followed by a dull Bond-recuperates-in-a-boring-spa-and-stumbles-across-a-SPECTE-plot that is pretty silly - but the action heats up as soon as a British bomber is hijacked and sunk into the Caribbean, launching an unprecedented amount of underwater screen time in an action film (and a blazing final underwater battle that goes on for nearly 10 minutes with NO DIALOGUE AT ALL!!). And while Adolfo Celi is not the greatest Bond villain ever as Largo, we do get a cool conference of all-SPECTRE, a stunning Bond girl in Claudine Auger, and a boffin' Tom Jones title song!! Misogyny is high, with Bond throwing the villainess Fionia Volpe in front of a bullet (he did something similar in the pre-title sequence in Goldfinger!), but no rapey scenes (and one of the underwater love scenes is surprisingly discreet!!). Nearly all of the film is worth re-watching, which is definitely what I did. The real stand-out of the film is the 24 minutes of underwater shooting! Five-minute missile recovery scene, three more minutes underwater when Bond meets Domino, two-minute underwater when Bond scopes out the Disco Volante, one minute of ""underwater love"", four more minutes underwater for the Bond-dodge, then the amazing final underwater battle from 1:54:00 to 2:03:00. There's also great dialogue: ""Do you mind if my friend sits this one out? She's just dead."" ""You've given me much pleasure, Domino..."" ""Jettison cocoon."" ""I'm glad I killed him."" ""You're glad? ...who's he?"" Then there's also a lobster audience, blood in water and sharks, and the corny ""When arrows meet"" balloon.

The film comes with all of the usual Bond bonus features under their usual menus and sub-menus. ""Declassified"" has a few documentaries: ""The Incredible World of James Bond - Original 1965 NBC Television Special"" (51:00) is a clip-reel of classic scenes from the four Bond films up till then, tied together with narration, but also with some bonus scenes, such as snippets of the marketing for the film (""You too can be a secret agent at modest cost and small risk"" if you wear 007 slacks)."" There's also a visit to Glencoe, Scotland, where the young James Bond grew up, lost his parents, whereupon we learn that he was sent to Eton by an unwed aunt, but from which he was soon expelled ""for showing precocious interest in a certain girl"", then getting into his World War II career, his career in the secret service, living in a flat in Chelsea that seemed anonymous. ""Q"" is referred to here as Majour Boothroyd, and Bond's critics are quoted calling him ""the Peter Pan of the bordello."" An on-location with Thunderball finally gets started at 28:00. ""Girls are selected to please both Bond and the audience."" Lady stunt school. Ken Adams sketches. ""An artist with the imagination of a 20th-century Edgar Allen Poe"" who had a budget of $500,000 for gimmicks and stunts. They took two weeks to shoot the final punch-out with Largo in the out-of-control hydrofoil at the end. There's a fight scene montage, an airport surveillance montage, the tarantula scene from Dr No, and some shots from Fleming's own Goldeneye cottage. Another documentary is called ""A Child's Guide to Blowing Up a Motor Car - 1965 Ford Promotional Film"" (15:00), this is a nutty piece of strangeness that also shows great behind-the-scenes footage of the motorcycle rocket attack on the burning car, with an ""uncle"" talking to a young Bond fan ""Chris"" about the trip to the set of Thunderball, starting off with a gadget workshop and a cool, creative credits montage. Racy comments in intro - ""Those girls are James Bond's... chums. I keep pictures of them with me so that I don't need the heater."" Stuntman driver Bob Simmons and all production people. ""There goes the chap girl baddy."" The kid lights his uncle's cigarette!! Stuntman shown putting on padding and protection. Explosive wiring, and reclusive soundmen. ""The nice all-powerful Mr Salzman,."" Blows up uncle's car at end!! ""On Location With Ken Adam"": Location scouting in France, Caribbean, picking the shark pool at an American couple's gorgeous mansion at a point along the coast of the Bahamas. There were shark wranglers to get them into the shots, and shark stench. Considered using the US hydrofoil Denison, and got a giant catamaran, built part of Vulcan bomber for some shots. Includes charming, candid poolside shots of the crew and production staff. Sean was his most relaxed with director Terence Young on this film. ""Black Peal"" schooner in some shots. Sullivan villa found by air surveillance. Anita Ekberg's husband played CIA man Felix, and she was around - we have cool footage of her in a bikini shaking her thing. Stars stayed in bungalows on Love Beach. Lounged on schooner, had lots of laughs on set. ""Bill Suitor: The Rocket Man Movies"" (3:50) talks to the man who crewed the rocket pack in his US Army times, when he was 19, it was a real device developed by the US military. Tubes burned red hot at 1,300 degrees Fahrenheit, but featured on film for only 0:21. Original close-up of Sean Connery was done without a helmet (like in the merchandising and promotional materials), but they had to re-shoot it for continuity as the stuntman wouldn't do it without a helmet. An ""exotic locations"" short piece is narrated by Maud Adams again, but there's nothing special here.

Of less interest is all the marketing material that is gathered here, although it starts with a prize - the ""Thunderball Boat Show Promo"" (2:45), which shows an alternate underwater battle. Also very good is ""Selling Bonds - Original 1965 TV commercials"" shows the 007 Raincoat, 007 Slacks, and Action Pack Toys. Dramatic narration of ""these are the slacks they styled for Bond!!"" ""Theatrical archives"" include snippet called ""Get The Point"" (3:00), ""What an operator"" and ""Two Biggest Bonds"". TV Broadcasts include ""Strikes Like Thunderball"", ""Look up, look down, look out!"",""Two for Two Bonds"", ""Bond Sale"", ""Thunderball and From Russia With Love Double Bill"" (3:24, all of varying length, with the last one only 0:10). There's a collection of Radio Communications: ""The Biggeest Bond Of All"", ""See Sean Connery In Thunderball"", ""Here Comes Thunderball"", ""Look Up, Look Down, Look Out"", ""James Bond Does It Everywhere"", ""Sean Connery in Thunderball"", ""Here Comes The Biggest Bond Of All"", ""One Motion Picture"", ""Thunderball and You Only Live Twice"", ""Sean Connery Is James Bond."" (5:00). Talk about a marketing blitz!! Then there's also the extensive image gallery, with each section prefaced by an title card that includes interesting facts about the topic: ""Portraits"" (25), ""The Aston Martin"" (2), ""Chateau D'Anet"" (8), ""Pinder's Shop"" (5), ""Searching for the Vulcan"" (3), ""Romance beneath the waves"" (14 - although some of them are non-romantic pics of people like Adolfo Celi), ""Underwater Action"" (25), ""The Final Fight (2), ""The Pinewood Tank"" (3), ""Thunderball around the world"" (23), ""Merchandising"" (40).

Interestingly, the BluRay version of this contains two commentary tracks. I was particularly interested in learning more about the extensive underwater shooting, which was handles by Rico Browning. The intensively-scripted commentary includes many voices, including Terrence Young, who talks about how he got involved as a Bond director. Initially, he suggested to Cubby and Harry that they film Thunderball, From Russia With Love and Dr No, and ironically those became his Bond films, but in the reverse order. They wanted to make Thunderball first, but in hindsight it's good that they didn't because they would have needed to shoot it on a small budget (Dr No cost $1 million, From Russia With Love $2 million, Thunderball $9 milllion), Young notes that he likes From Russia With Love the most, but Thunderball was the most successful. Ken Adams speaks, noting that he was born in Berlin. There's discussion about the Thunderball manuscript lawsuit, which dragged on and on and on (eventually leading to a Thunderball copy, Never Say Never Again, with Connery returning for the role). Interesting to hear about the differences between the book and the final screenplay, and who added ideas, like that of Domino's brother. Interestingly, the undersea battle only represented a page in the screenplay - everything had to be made up on the spot by the underwater filming director. There were also interesting gimmicks, like the hydrofoil, Bond's underwater rocket, the mouth breather, and the ship that split into two. They blew up the underwater Vulcan set, it's become a new coral reef. Details about shark wrangling. There's an interesting anecdote about the high level conference and the meeting of double-ohs - including one female agent!! There was originally an idea to pack the conference with famous spy actors, but it proved too difficult to handle logistically - too bad!! Nassau was a playground for the rich, the Beatles had just done Help! there. Scuba diving was also a new sport at the time, and this film featured it substantially. John Barry talks about recording Tom Jones, and how he almost passed out when singing that last note. Almost used Dionne Warwick's ""Kiss Kiss Bang Bang"" for the soundtrack, but that was nixed at the last minute. Used 15 sharks for some scenes, caught them and roped them around and hoped for the best.

There was another commentary by the editor and the screenwriter (and ""others""), but I didn't bother with this one.",1423180800,,9486,5.047831632653061

703634,5,6303651488,"When people look back on old Sean Connery films, Thuderball frequently goes unwatched. At the time of it's release (although being the most profitable 007 film ever released), it received criticism for a hastily-written repetitive soundtrack and a long, winding, underwater climax that is rather unrealistic, doesn't have a particularly dramatic moment, and isn't set to music.

Why then, you might ask, do I give this a 5 star review? Aside from these few faults, I think Thunderball delivering a compelling plot, great settings (Largo's ""Disco Volante"" hydrofoil), seductive girls, and a great look at Connery's character. This is also the film that introduced SPECTRE, a recurring element for years to come, and now returning again in the 2015 namesake film. Personally, I love the soundtrack, specifically John Barry's deliciosuly seductive and cool seaside ""Cafe Martinique"" track.

All in all, Thunderball is a superb entry to the 007 franchise, definitely worth watching for viewers exploring the 60's-era films. Although the underwater fight scene can get a bit lengthy, this film is a delight to watch with the lights off and some freshly baked cookies, from the opening fight and jetpack scene right until the floating ending that is so frequently seen in other Bonds thereafter. And I think those opening credits are the best seen during Connery's time (despite lacking the voice of Shirley Bassey).

In my personal opinion, this is the finest of them all: it finds the perfect balance of the key 007 elements, twisting them into a great plot, setting, and crafting an intriguing tale that's thoroughly enjoyable while bringing Connery to his fullest place as a character in the entire series.",1397865600,,1704,5.189090909090909

703637,4,6303651488,"Thunderball, the fourth James Bond film is a bit frustrating. There is a lot to like about this movie; Connery is in fine form, Largo (Adolfo Celi) is a great villain, Fiona Volpe (Luciana Paluzzi) is a great henchwoman, John Barry's score is outstanding, the plot, involving stolen nuclear warheads, is interesting, and there are great individual scenes, such as Bond using a jetpack, Bond escaping from sharks and the underwater showdown between SPECTRE agents and  the United States Coast Guard. The problem, however,lies with the pacing and editing. The underwater scenes are repetitive  and seem to go on forever and the pacing of the movie is slow. If director Terrance Young had cut the fat a little, Thunderball could have been a great film. As it stands, Thunderball is still very good and there's a lot to like.",1391904000,,821,4.899280575539568

POSITIVES: Sean Connery as classic Bond - funny, tough, to the point. The girls are hot. The wit is on and the title song by Tom Jones is remarkable.

Now for the NEGATIVE (singular) cause it's really just one. This movie is too damn long! lol It's 20 minutes longer than its predecessor. Goldfinger was highly successful but sometimes more is not better. 20 extra minutes, most of that being in the underwater scenes.

The stuff I love - the humor, the jetpack scene, the ending etc.- makes this worth having at a reasonable price or as backup in the collection anyway. Get it. :-)",1390867200,,666,4.533333333333333

703792,5,6303651488,"There is only one 007, and that is the Scottish actor, Sean Connery. Seeing this one again over the summer was wild and wooly. Yes, they made movies a bit differently in the early 60's, but that's ok. With 'Thunderball' you get what you paid for. Relentless action, supercool locations(Bermuda/Virgin Islands) and ultra sexy 'Bond Girls'. Alot of the action scenes toward the end are all underwater. Connery has fun with this installment, as the series was still new at the time. Who can forget the 'shark scene'? This is first class entertainment, and far from 'politically correct.'
Everyone who is cool in the film smokes and drinks, as well. Connery appeared in a total of 7 Bond movies. This one was so good, they re-made it in 1983 and called it ""Never Say Never Again""!  True Bond fans will rank this one high on their list. So sit back, crack open a cold one and watch the remastered version on your flatscreen.

703795,5,6303651488,"THUNDERBALL is a very Nostalgic and Endearing early Bond Film. This film somehow sums up a feeling of nostalgia and endearment for the way it engulfed audiences, myself included, into the wonderful world of James Bond. Sean Connery did it with such effortless and natural charm and aplomb like no other. He's a tough and resourceful blunt instrument with a level of intelligence sophistication still impressive to this day. The world of THUNDERBALL is elegant where the villains live an opulent style of life which is a veneer for their sinister plans. In a bit of irony James Bond lives in that same world and he is up to the challenge to foil whatever mayhem they concoct.

After a one-film hiatus SPECTRE returns. So has Sean Connery as he was finally groomed to perfection as the definitive screen incarnation of James Bond in GOLDFINGER. Terence Young is also back as director. However, he seems to have been influenced over the fine-tuning that Guy Hamilton brought to the main character and overall tone of GOLDFINGER. Due to that film's success Young seems to be floundering here being diverted from his vision of the character that he helped bring to the screen. Young is 180 degrees from being the auteur he envisioned himself to be. The film seems loosely constructed and leisurely acted. Adolfo Celi as Emilio Largo looks the part but he never seems a real threat to Bond. In fact he seems to lose every encounter with Bond whether it be at the gambling tables or engaging in idle banter on the merits of women vs. guns. Bond outdoes him in skeet shooting without even looking at the target.

What makes the film very memorable is John Barry's rich score and Lamar Boren's beautiful and colorful underwater photography. The two went hand in hand. I also thought the villains' plot to hijack a Vulcan jet was extremely well filmed and executed. This film has a very British feel to as it should have. Going back to John Barry's impressive and complex score for THUNDERBALL, it is here that he truly puts his inimitable stamp on the entire sound for the series during that period that were followed by his scores for YOU ONLY LIVE TWICE, ON HER MAJESTY'S SECRET SERVICE and the lighter sounding, yet lavish DIAMONDS ARE FOREVER. The scores for these four James Bond films, are richly textured, meticulously scored for each required scene and are emotionally charged.",1383004800,,2376,4.7926829268292686

703798,5,6303651488,"This is one of the best James Bond films ever. It's not boring, it's not the same action you see in other 007 movies; it's different. I guess that's why it's not the usual 007 movies that you see so much after Connery left. The reason why I really liked this one is because of the action which is packed in this thrill ride. I can't recommend this movie to all, but for those who love spy movies you can't miss this one.

703920,5,6303651488,Thunderball is one of the better James Bond movies in the set of Bond.  I have heard the rumours about the underwater fight scene being edited but in my personal viewpoint still an amazing fight scene and very well filmed for the movie.  The movie plotline was actual very believeable about stealing a weapon and holding it for a money trade off in exchange for where the weapon is located.  I also would like to add that I thought Sean Connery was in one of his best phsyical shapes as James Bond base on the fight scenes and action stunts unless they used a stunt man.  I thought every actor did a great job with what they had to work with and the added benifit of the dance scene and all that music going on very impressive turn out.  I look forward to many more James Bond movies and writing up much more reviews of them to come as I watch them.

703925,4,6303651488,"Once one gets past the plot contrivance of a spy that introduces himself by his real name, the rest is easy.

This is the third in the series for Connery.
There are fleeting mentions of 007s prior exploits.

The bad guys are really bad.
The good dies - may or may not be - really good. So many die so fast - it's hard to tell.
Most if not all of James' girl friends die.
Usually, the supreme villain and one uber henchman has to die.

The gadgets are neat, the plot is preposterous, the hero's survive-ability incredible.
Even in it's day, it was difficult to tell whether it was a Spy-Thriller or a Comedy.

Lots of under water shots.
Who knew that radiation could be detected with a watch?
or,
That 5 minutes worth of air could be crammed into a cigar tube?
Also,
Sharks prefer bad guys?
And, in the days before PETA, sharks were harmed in the shooting of this film.

BTW, right about now, one realizes that the CIA Felix character is never going to be played by the same actor twice.

Connery is still having fun.
The acting is limited by the script.
The special effects, sets, stunts were state of the art for the day.

This film continued the practice of great opening action sequence, a 'larger-than-life' villain in Largo/ AKA No. 2 (Adolfo Celi), a collection of vicious henchmen and woman - Count Lippe, Fiona, Vargas and Janni (played by Guy Doleman, Luciana Paluzzi, Philip Locke and Michael Brennan), an elaborate plot and a beautiful leading lady (Claudine Auger who plays Domino)  Bob Simmons, the main Bond stuntman opens the film as the villainous aCol. Jacques Bouvar AKA SPECTRE No. 6 who is dispatched by Bond.  The scape by jetpack sets the stage for the great action film that follows.  Largo and SPECTRE have downed a UN Vulcan fighter and stolen two nuclear warheads and hidden them in the Caribbean.  Bond must intervene before the UN pays a ransom to SPECTRE.  Along the way, Bond romances, fights on land and underwater, and finally squares off on a hydrofoil.  The one change here is that the villain is not killed by Bond - someone else (Domino)does that that favor.  The cast of British actors (Bernard Lee, Desmond Llewelyn and Lois Maxwell) return as the MI-6 crew with Rik Van Nutter playing Felix Leiter in this film.  The hi-lights of this film include the incredible underwater photography and action sequences, the villainous and voluptuous Fiona, the Vulcan crash and cover-up, and the incredible fight on the hydro-foil, the Disco Volante.  There are two quintessential Bond scenes: SPECTRE's HQ and MI-6' briefing room which are a treat for all Bond fans.  This loud, action-filled and very entertaining Bond film raised the level that future Bond films would have to meet.  This one is great!",1376006400,3,1770,5.041237113402062

It was a total pain! --- And I'm betting it's the way the movie was made, NOT because we watched it on Amazon, because we watch a lot of movies and TV shows on Amazon and don't have this issue.

Maybe we were too distracted by the volume issue, but this movie seemed a little bit hard to follow.

Even when he is recuperating from his previous assignment, he is at work, noting the first clues about the hijacking of a Vulcan bomber carrying two nuclear bombs.

704572,4,6303651488,"Thunderball(1965) is one of my personal favorite James Bond movies. This 007 film has taken criticism for its pacing problems. There are many characters in the story left undeveloped. Also, most of the film feels like we're watching Bond enjoying a vacation in a tropical climate. 007 has to stop SPECTRE from blowing up Florida with nuclear missiles. SPECTRE also wants millions of dollars in ransom money. Austin Powers movies have poked fun of this cliche. This plot was recycled in the John Woo shoot-em-up Broken Arrow(1996). Sean Connery played James Bond for the fourth time. Italian-Brazilian actor Adolfo Celi played SPECTRE baddie Emilio Largo. Luciana Paluzzi was quite good as sexy, cat-like SPECTRE agent Fiona Volpe. This was the last Bond film directed by Terence Young. Young also directed Dr. No(1962) and From Russia With Love(1963). In the ""Young"" Bond films, the violence is stronger. In the Guy Hamilton Bond films such as Goldfinger(1964) and Diamonds Are Forever(1971), the violence is more cartoonish. French actress Claudine Auger is quite good as Bond's ally Domino. The music score by the late John Barry is good. The original theme song was ""Kiss Kiss Bang Bang"". At the last minute, it was changed to ""Thunderball"" sung by Tom Jones. Albert R. Broccoli and Harry Saltzman produced Thunderball with Kevin McClory. For complex legal reasons, McClory had the filmmaking rights to Thunderball. McClory remade Thunderball in 1983 as Never Say Never Again.
Thunderball shows Bond flying with a ""hover jet pack"". There's a climactic fight on the Disco Volante. The film is also packed with sexy women. Thunderball is a solid entry in the James Bond film series.",1363564800,,1683,5.123636363636364

704574,5,6303651488,"Thunderball feels like the first three early bond films somehow rolled perfectly, cohesively, and successfully into one new original and spectacular film. The movie overall seems balanced with its drama, action, story, and other elements. So it feels like the ultimate Bond movie (Peter Hunt's 'On Her Majesy's Secret Service' is the perfect and excellent closer of the early Bond films).

The intricate and well-developed plot, involving the heist of the two atomic bombs, seems very believable. The cinematography is highly exceptional - there was nothing like the great underwater battle sequences ever done before. The incredible set designs by Ken Adams were marvelously ultra-modern and still look new. And of course, Peter Hunt by this time had perfected the 'jump-cut' editing on this 4th of the great early James Bond films.

Also, a big tip-of-the-hat to director Terence Young, who was more than partially responsible for the savvy and sophistication of the Bond character.",1363305600,,984,5.341935483870968

704576,5,6303651488,"For me, this was the first and best of all the Bond films.  Yes today it is very dated, but there is still film magic there.  It starts with the cinematics and best opening scores of all the bond films, the theme song by Tom Jones.  Every Bond film after this used this style of cinematics for the opening theme and credits. It is a landmark for the Bond films.

There is a scene in Thunderball where Bond has to wait for Largo and his men to suite up in scuba to pick up the Nukes from the underwater hiding place. The location where they suite up is on the beach at the Atlantis hotel in the Bahamas.  I was not aware of this.  However, during a visit to the hotel while it was still under construction, I got a tour of the grounds.  At the sea entrance to the Atlantis Lagoon is the seawall and bridge where the scene was filmed.  I was as giddy as a schoolboy when I discovered the location, and I immediately recognized what I looking at.  I returned to the Atlantis hotel as a guest a few years ago, and the seawall and bridge was still there.  If you are ever at the Atlantis hotel on Paradise Island, I urge you to visit this location.

Interesting, forward -thinking, touch: Bond does not characteristically ""deliver"" to the lust interest/double-agent - he says, h*ll, I had an off-night.

Particularly the final underwater fight scene that went on WAY too long...we ultimately collapsed laughing at it for being so ludicrous. And with a production budget such as this, WHY was Bond forced to wear a shorty (ORANGE) scuba suit with no legs attached? An odd thing to focus on, but when your hero dons the orange scuba suit (which covers his nethers like a codpiece) but continues to wear a pair of white shorts underneath it, it appears his boxers are sticking out as he swims. How no one on the production crew noticed this is beyond me...at last it gave us something to laugh at during the never-ending fight scene. I feel like a heretic saying this, but 'Thunderball' could've been better. Connery might have been aware of this fact too, as this was reportly his last Bond film.

Colonel Jacques Bouvar is followed by Bond and Bond succeeds in killing him and escaping using a jetpack and then his car.  Bond is injured because he was hit multiple times in the back with a fireplace poker.  When he returns to London he is sent to a clinic to work on his health.

SPECTRE is having a conference meeting with all of their top leaders discussing their contributions of money to the organizations.  Number One kills number Nine for embezzling money from the organization.  Number 2 discusses his plans to extort 100 million British Pounds using his secret NATO plan.

While at the clinic Bond sees something strange going on as one of the patients, Count Lippe, has a Tong symbol tattooed on him.  Bond breaks into his room and looks for evidence of who he is.  While in the room a highly bandaged man from next door comes into the room but doesn't see Bond.  Later, Lippe tries to kill Bond while he is on a spinal stretching machine by turning it onto full setting.  He is saved by the beautiful nurse and he blackmails her into the steam room as she thinks she may have caused the machine to get out of control.

This movie features many beautiful Bond girls and a twisted plot to blackmail the government of England out of 100 million British pounds.

I wasn't sure I was going to like it, since I have been 99% disappointed with my compulsive DVD buys from Walmart bins. However, I am thrilled with this purchase to say the least.  The DVD is really really really clear, and MGM is taking strides in James Bond DVD excellence (GREAT JOB MGM!), the story is exciting to say the least--and very action-packed and fun.  You get so much more than you expected--60's sophistication (the 60's was in many ways more glamorous and sophisticated than today), fabulous 60's cars including European models, gorgeous girls in 60's make-up & fashion, sophisticated European ways.

In this movie, Bond travels from Europe to Nassau on an exciting adventure.  The movie is so much more than just a FIRST-RATE James Bond movie which it is! You should see this film several times to really soak it all in--the cars, the beautiful women, a young Sean Connery as James Bond, the subtle humor, suspense, classy places, classy 60's cars, classy 60's make-up, the best of the 60's fashion, the best technology of the times (you will be astonished!), AND NO CEL PHONES-WHEEEEEEE!--The one-&-only classic ring of a ""real"" telephone!

704950,3,6303651488,"As far as a follow up to a classic film like Goldfinger, Thunderball delivers on many levels.  The world threatening scheme is bigger and more menacing than it had been. We really get the impression that the fate of the world is at risk.  We are also sent to a vast tropical paradise in the Bahamas, complete with sunshine, snorkeling for exotic fish, and sipping a cocktail under a palm tree on a warm carribean night.  I don't think any other Bond film ever gave us such a breezy vacation feel as Thunderball.

 Then there is the man himself, Bond, James Bond smoothly played by Sean Connery, bedding a hospital nurse here, an enemy agent there, taking off on a jet back, descending in the crystal blue waters from a helicopter, brawling a guy on a speeding motor boat.  What doesn't he do in this movie?  Sean Connery oozes so much confidence in this performance, you begin to feel like he doesn't even have to try.

There is plenty of high speed action to behold, such as the impressive underwater battle scenes (which are enjoyable and suspensful to watch if you ask me) Largo is also a pretty despisable main villain. Lastly there are sharks, albeit not with lasers, but there in there and that's still pretty cool...

So it sounds like I think this is film is pretty good, right?  Well, yes and no.  My reasons above may be everything some fans are looking for--action, chicks, martinis, cars, and great locations.  For me, this is not enough--and I am a huge fan of this series.  While the plot starts out interesting in the beginning, it just devolves into the lazy, let's turn this into one big chase movive.  In this case, it's Bond tracking down Largo and attempting to board his Disco Volente ship. While this works great for a video game it starts to get boring in an over 2 hour long film.

My other big complaint is the casting of the lead Bond girl.  First of all, Claudine Auger, while French and hot, has absolutely no acting ability and dimension to her character whatsoever.  I don't care about her character and I don't know much about who she is either.  It seemed like the producers were trying to put in another Honey Ryder (Dr. NO), what with the collecting sea creatures and all...But Honey Ryder, while played pretty dumb-faced by that actress, at least had some back story and reason for being where she was.  On top of this, Bond has zero chemistry with this character, so any romance in this is completely unconvincing.  My other problem with this, is that the other ""Bond Girl"" Fiona Volpe, in this movie is MUCH more interesting and much sassier. Why is she not the main Bond girl and worse, *Spoiler alert* why is she killed off so early in this movie?  Her relationship with Bond as being an agent on the other side, made their romance all the more intriguing.

While this movie has all the great Bond ingredients, and probably some of the best in the series--Sean Connery as Bond in the Bahamas (really, what more do you need), it falls short on two fundamental areas that make a film good: interesting plot AND and an interesting supporting lead character.  You need a plot that keeps you following the movie AND you need an interesting supporting lead to interact with the protagonist to make the plot interesting!  I don't care how many chase scenes, sex scenes, drink scenes, kill scenes, or shark scenes you have, if the two foundational indredients are not there, then well...you don't have a cake...or a movie.

I don't think Thunderball is quite that bad; I find it quite enjoyable in fact.  It just is missing some important elements that would make this a classic 007 film.  For that, yes this film is over-rated, but certainly one worth checking out.",1273190400,2,3697,4.596036585365853
704951,3,6303651488,"A Ball Of Thunder...

The porno industry would have been in uproar had Balls Of Thunder been the actual title. 1965 and for the fourth year in a row another Bond film hits the screens, again directed by Terence Young, the original Bond director. The Bond franchise had turned into a phenomenon, thanks to Goldfinger, making this one of the most eagerly anticipated movies of the year.

It starts in a small way with Thunderball that Bond starts to transcend it's own boundaries of story and earthiness becoming more fantasy than spy thriller, living up the expectations of being a bigger and bolder movie than it's predecessor and to stand out against the number of imitator spy films popping up, in doing so it loses a little of it's soul.  Terence Young's direction at least steers this adventure with the right look and feel maintained from the first few films. But it does suffer story and character wise trying to top previous entries.

The bigger budget is obvious, there are more gadgets, girls and exotic locations than before and Sean Connery is still in his element with a nice enhancing hairpiece as his was starting to thin down by this picture and whose wouldn't when being pursued by paparazzi twenty four seven? Bond is ever more the womaniser, drinker and quipper although perhaps notable predicting the future this is the first film where we don't see the character smoke on screen. The simple blockbuster plot groundwork is cemented for the series in this film. SPECTRE return with their most audacious plot, hijacking two atomic bombs and holding the world to a billion dollar diamond ransom or two Western cities will be destroyed. A similar plot would crop up again in future Bond pictures, even to Thunderball itself being remade as 80's Connery Bond `Never Say Never Again'. Good to see this is where the storyline originated.

Italian actor Adolfo Celi plays the brutish, silver haired, eye patch wearing Number two of Spectre, Emilio Largo surrounded by a bevy of assassins a standout of which is Luciana Paluzzi playing Bond femme fatale, Fiona Vulpe, one of four woman Bond beds down as he lurches from one action set piece to another.

Bond is numerically getting closer to Number 1, who is still frustratingly shown as a cat patting silhouette dishing out orders and frying the minions who have failed him, shades of Dr. Evil in years to come. However the simple plot is made up for with the rocket like pace for a film made in '65. Though it does drag a bit with the amount of underwater sequences the jet fighter hijacking being the most obvious. As far as the underwater photography goes though, the cinematographer, Lamar Boren, strikes gold with the clarity of these aquatic shots choreographed by Ricou Browning especially with Bond's underwater searches of Largo's yacht and the brutal underwater fight scene between the good guys and Spectre which benefits a lot from the crystal clear remastering and transfer to DVD.

This Bond entry leaves no room for subtle brush strokes as he tracks down the dead pilot's sister from a Health farm in England to the Bahamas. `Domino' or Dominique is played by Claudine Auger, a former Miss France who is a passable Bond girl and it's here through no fault of hers Bond girls really begin to become bland in character. Bond and Largo play a game of cat and mouse totally lacking the finesse of encounters with previous Bond villains. Q makes his first appearance in the field to give out some gimmicky gadgets and Rick Van Nutter plays the third version of Felix Leiter. There's little doubt of the film's outcome about the only drama being when Bond suffers a minor bullet wound during a mid movie chase scene.

More drama was happening leading to the film's production, including the plagiarism court case surrounding the novel and screenplay initiated by Kevin McCLory against creator Ian Fleming which led to the former being given an on screen Producer credit. But despite this and the increasingly strained relationship between Connery and the press as fame overtook him, the film won an Academy Award for visual effects and adjusted for the 2010 box office is still the most financially successful Bond entry ever made.

But as the pre credits sequence complete with massive fistfight and rocket pack shows the franchise was starting to head into the realms of absolute spy fantasy rather than spy thriller. However the DVD release covers the Thunderball phenomenon in a documentary and its impact on the way action films were heading and how the spy culture was creating many imitators on both film and television from films such as In Like Flint and The Ipcress File to Get Smart, The Avengers and the Man From U.N.C.L.E.

Not only is this the cleanest looking remaster of 60's Bond's it's also the first that got the 5.1 surround sound treatment in it's first release, not that the powerful Tom Jones opening song needs that. Titbit - this is the first film to feature Connery in the famed gun barrel opening sequence, previously it was stuntman Bob Simmons in his hat.",1262822400,,5054,4.8189158016147635

704953,4,6303651488,"I wanted to watch the original early films of Bond, beginning with Dr. No. It's great to see Sean Connery evolve from film to film to become, I feel, the best Bond there ever was. I'm progressing in order from Dr. No, to From Russia with love, Goldfinger, Thunderball, You only live twice, Diamonds are forever, and the later semi-Bond ""Never say Never again"". I know many fans of Bond dislike the last film Connery did, but perhaps they were expecting too much from a then, pretty weathered, franchise. I still have to watch the final two Connery films and am not expecting too much from ""Diamonds"" and even less from ""Never"". But that doesn't take away from the talent and artistry of Sean Connery and I'm more into those last films to simply watch how he slowly bows out of the James Bond role forever. It's sad film history to watch sometimes, but I'd rather watch these first Bond films again and again than to tolerate the works of Roger Moore and the others. Daniel Craig is a fresh approach to the role, but he lacks the warmth and humor that Connery brought to the role. I'd love to see one final film where Sean Connery has taken over the position of ""M"" and guides newer agents along, making them the best they could be. Sort of like an episode of ""NCIS"", I know, but it would be entertaining to see, none-the-less.",1260576000,,1326,4.460905349794238
705042,5,6303651488,"Thunderball

This is the fourth film in a series that offers the best action / adventure plots. The James Bond movies surfaced a world of espionage, gadgets, secret weapons, beautiful women and amazing cars. As with the first three, the success of Sean Connery continued to enchant audiences the world over, creating an image so powerful that still to today, it is debated that he offered the best Bond character.

By now, we were riveted on the Bond films from the very start. The introduction was becoming one of the best parts of the movie, offering gorgeous female silhouettes as Bond walked across stage demonstrating his marksmanship.

For those of us who are fans of Tom Jones, this became the best film for the theme song is performed by him. Back in 1965, Tom Jones offered great appeal as the star with a powerful voice who wore tight pants, billowing shirts with wide collars and who was considered a sex symbol by admirers.

The song written by Don Black was a tremendous hit and the lyrics reaffirmed our perception of James Bond as the Secret Service Agent who ran while others walked, acted while others talked, wanted it all... so he stroke like Thunderball! Yes, for us Bond knew the meaning of success, calling him the winner who takes all, breaking any heart without regret while his fight goes on and on because he thinks the fight is worth it all!

The movie starts with James Bond at a funeral of SPECTRE agent No. 6. Bond follows his widow and we are soon shocked to find out that it is a man disguised as the widow, who in actuality is No. 6, Jacques Bouvar attempting to cover his identity to get away with killing two British agents.

Thunderball brings us a Bond on a mission to find two NATO nuclear bombs that were taken away by members of SPECTRE. The nuclear bombs are on a plane and SPECTRE has hired a man who has an operation to look identical to the real pilot, who is killed and replaced by the impersonator. The plane is on a training flight but the impersonator pilot gasses the rest of the crew then flying the plane to the Bahamas where he submerges the plane to be camouflaged to prevent detection.

The pilot had been engaged and promised a certain payment for his services but he reconsiders and asks for a lot more because of the pain and suffering he has undergone to look, speak, and act like the original pilot. Because of his attempt to extort more from the organization, it is now his turn to get killed by Emilio Largo, superbly played by Adolfo Celi, who is none other than Agent #2 at SPECTRE [Special Executive for Counter Intelligence, Terrorism, Revenge and Extortion].

Largo and his men take possession of the atomic bombs under water and these scenes are magnificent for they offer something audiences the world over had not yet seen, underwater opening hatches, scuba divers and underwater weapons, machinery and tools that inspired many to take on new hobbies and see an underworld filled with possibilities.

Bond is sent to the Bahamas where he partners with Largo's mistress, Domino, beautifully played by Claudine Anger, who is the original pilot's sister and wants revenge for her brother's death.

When Bond and Largo finally meet, they sense in each other a dangerous enemy and the fun begins for these two initiate a psychological game to draw each other out.

Another SPECTRE agent, Fiona Volve, played by Luciana Paluzzi, is after Bond. The magic and fun of the Bahamas is introduced as Bond tries to escape from Volpe and we become part of the famous street parade known as Junkanoo or local carnival celebration. During Junkanoo, thousands of men and women unite under the banner of differing groups to produce beautiful costumes, music and dance, so it becomes easy for Bond to mingle in the crowd but because he was shot and is bleeding, the blood hounds after him are able to closely follow.

Bond and Felix Leiter, this time played by Rik Van Nutter continue to search for the plane by helicopter because Bond needs to understand if the weapons are still on board or if they have been taken and after days of searching the waters they find the Vulcan and Bond finds the crew corpses and the pilot's. Bond takes the personal items belonging to the impersonating pilot to later give these to Domino to let her know of her brother's death.

Much action ensues and the underwater battle between Bond, a unit of the United States Coast Guard and Largo's men is simply filming at its best. As usual, Bond saves the day and like Thunderball we are now forever fans of Bond, James Bond! Thunderball is and shall remain one of the best Bond films, don't miss it!",1249603200,3,4629,4.637362637362638
705043,4,6303651488,"As much as I loved this film, I must say this movie was not the best Connery Bond. It's an excellent movie no doubt, I much prefer You Only Live Twice, but this is still great.

This one takes place in the hot Nassau in the Bahamas. Two warheads have been stolen from by SPECTRE Agent Dominic Largo. Bond heads to the Bahamas to solve this. While on the way, he meets the sexy Domino, and finds out that he may be the only one to take the world out of its hostage state which leads to a spectacular showdown on the Disco Volante.

Thunderball is a great movie and maybe one of the best (but not the best). The only thing that makes this a 4 star only is that it's quite slow, and at 130 minutes (there's a typo on the back saying 125), the movie feels longer than it really is due to the fact that there's not a lot of plot twists.

Overall I loved it, but it's not the best Connery one IMO. Still reccomended, and the two-disc ultimate edition is excellent as well.",1239667200,,966,4.1005291005291005
705044,5,6303651488,"The fourth film in this infamous series of espionage features Sean Connery returning to the role that brought him international fame.  Of course it would be insane to imagine anyone else in this role at this point in time for the fledgling series that would go on to be the longest running series in the history of cinema.

The film begins with Bond still stuck in the ongoing war between himself and the conning SPECTRE organization and has acquired special attention from their mysterious faceless, cat-stroking mastermind who has now decided that James Bond, Agent 007, must be taken out of the picture before he further meddles with the affairs of SPECTRE.  But who in their right mind would want to take on the British super-agent?  SPECTRE's Number 2, Emilio Largo seems up to the task shortly after the death of Number 6 at the hands of 007 in the beginning of the film.

Largo's plan centers on the hijacking of two nuclear warheads which would cause enough fuss to attract any super-spy to the area, and he intends on it.  Of course, why bother with a fully equipped agent if you can take Bond out when he's still recovering after his previous mission?  Well, it turns out that even in relaxation James Bond isn't entirely defenseless and manages to leave the Spa unharmed...of course he doesn't leave without some invaluable information regarding Largo's plan.

Off to the Bahamas goes Bond, where he finally lets his womanizing go too far, nearly leading to his death, but once again he sweet talks, and dances his way out of danger (Literally!).  Of course an Agent's job doesn't only center on sex and alcohol.  It's actually serious business, as he discovers Largo's fortified estate (complete with a pool of sharks) and yacht are the center of this nuclear weapon plot.  So you'd think this sounds easy enough for our dear agent 007, right?  Wrong.  You forget that Number between one and five in the SPECTRE organization is going to have a countless number of faceless henchmen ripe for the killing (So many hired hands...What do they pay all these scuba troopers?).

The entire thing leads up to one of the most interesting, violent fight sequences in the entire Bond franchise as a giant underwater battle erupts between SPECTRE and a group of Scuba commandos (joined of course by  Bond) as they attempt to prevent Largo from detonating the bombs off the coast of Miami.  Excitement and bloodshed erupts and the title of ""Most Violent Connery Bond Film"" is one by the end.

Sean Connery as usual proves that he IS James Bond and delivers his lines perfectly.  At this point Connery obviously has the character down to near perfection.  He can fight, shoot, smoke, gamble, drive nice cars, and seduce women and make it come across as convincing.  This is definitive proof that he was born for this role and that the series wouldn't have gone very far without his leaving such a great impact upon his initial run as the character.

Adolfo Auger also makes for a good villain.  Cold, heartless, and delivers his lines with the vicious nature of a shark.  He is a driven villain, seeming to only desire to further impress his superior in SPECTRE, yet he never stoops to the rank of simple henchmen.  So he works for himself, but also to impress his leader, but at the same time it feels he tries to detach himself as far away from the central SPECTRE organization as possible.  Maybe he intends to prove himself and break away and form his own organization?  He obviously has the money and resources to do so (unless ALL of that comes from SPECTRE).

This was my father's favorite Bond film growing up and I agree that it is a classic that is a worthwhile movie, though the one complaint I have is that it has several slow parts that seem to drag endlessly, but these are rare.

Also, the remastered picture quality on the latest DVDs is great, and if you don't already own the 007 editions from earlier this decade I'd highly recommend the Ultimate Edition of Thunderball, because it has quite a few extra features for you Bond fans (but not so many that it entirely outweighs the 007 edition; so if you have that release there is no need to buy again).",1238544000,,4168,4.657103825136612
705045,4,6303651488,"Sean Connery stars as James Bond once again in Thunderball (1965). Although not as entertaining the previous films, it is still a great film!

When a NATO plane carrying two atomic bombs crashes and sinks near the Bahamas, SPECTRE steals the bombs and threatens to blow up a major city in the UK or the USA unless they are paid ransom. The plan is carried out by Blofeld's  number 2 henchman Emilio Largo (Adolfo Celi). Bond is sent to Nassau to investigate Domino Derval (Claudine Auger), the sister of a murdered NATO pilot and is also Largo's mistress. Bond also runs into the red-headed SPECTRE assassin Fiona Volpe (Luciana Paluzzi). Bond must find the bombs and stop Largo's plan before it's too late.

The film is fun to watch, with a excellent pre-credit sequence and several underwater fight scenes. Thunderball is not as exciting as previous films, but it has its moments. Bond's gadgets include a jet pack, pocket-sized scuba tank, underwater camera that doubles as a geiger counter, and Homing pill. The Aston Martin DB5 also appears briefly in the opening scene.

705123,5,6303651488,"After the success of Goldfinger, considerable resources were used to produce the next James Bond film, Thunderball.  I was in the 8th grade when the film was released in 1965 and there was tremendous cultural excitment arouind the film with magazines like GQ and Esquire promoting the film with flashy articles.

Now seeing the film 43 years later I remember just what a good film Thunderball really is. Sean Connery will always be the perfect James Bond. In comparison to the thin fellows that played Bond in later films, Connery is a thick, muscular, masculine, hunk of muscle.  This makes the fight scenes more realistic and less choreographed. He is paired with the villian Emilio Largo, played by Adolfo Celi, one of the few villians that is as smart, muscular, athletic, and talented as Bond. This makes for a more balanced struggle which engages the viewer a bit more than Bond's struggles with the obese Goldfinger or the anemic Dr. No.

We also have the pleasure of James Bond meeting his match in the character of a female assassin, played perfectly by Luciana Paluzzi. She is extremely strong and athletic, beautiful and cunning. There is a wonderful scene where after making love she confronts Bond with her contempt, informing him that she is one girl who won't be transformed from evil to good through the love making of James Bond. The scene in which they dance in the Kiss Kiss club while assassins surround the dance floor and John Barry's score is at its best in reflecting island beat, is a total winner.

The plot is a bit more complex in Thunderball with the villian Largo having multiple back up plans which Bond must uncover and then foil.
Claudine Auger is incredibly beautiful as Domino, Largo's mistress who turns on her evil master through the influence of Bond.

Thunderball is the finest of the Bond films where Sean Connery plays James Bond. It has held up to scrutiny after 43 years.",1228608000,3,1914,4.767371601208459

705126,5,6303651488,"Taking into account inflation, THUNDERBALL is, by far, the biggest grosser in the series.  In 2008 dollars the film would have grossed nearly a billion dollars.  It has some slow moments but by and large it is a large scale world shaking epic.  The threat of nuclear blackmail has a sense of urgency that the remake, NEVER SAY NEVER AGAIN, never achieves.  Connery gives his most relaxed performance as Bond, Adolfo Celli is meancing as Largo, Claudine Auger stunning as Domino and Luciana Paluzzi as Fiona Vupli, a deadly liason for Bond.  Remembered for the underwater battle the film is based on Fleming's novel which inturn was based on a screenplay by himself, Jack Whittingham and Kevin McClory -- the basis for a major lawsuit that has reverberated over the decades and resulting in NSNA in 1983 (releasing the same year as Roger Moore's outing OCTOPUSSY -- which made more money) as well as an unsuccessful attempt by Sony and McClory to launch an independent Bond series in the late 1990's.  MGM/UA won the battle and the dust on this whole affair has probably settled for good with the passing of McClory earlier this year. An interesting side note: like FROM RUSSIA WITH LOVE, Connery never utters the line ""My name is Bond, James Bond."" Among the special features (which pretty much uses the same from the previous edition)is the 1965 NBC special ""The Incredible World of James Bond"".

705127,4,6303651488,"Here it is, Thunderball, the biggest 60's bond of them all. Sean Connery returns once again to play secret agent James Bond 007. This time around S.P.E.C.T.R.E has plans to steal nuclear missiles and take the world ransom; if they don't pay up...well let just say we haven't heard this before. Also we get to see a little more of Blofeld. Unfortunately in the subsequent films he doesn't look as menacing or as threatening as he does in this one and in From Russia With Love.

Thunderball is a mixed bag; while the movie is overall excellent, it lacks in a fashion some of the spark from the 3 previous films. Don't get me wrong thunderball is awesome, it has one of the best underwater sequences ever; the underwater fight sequence alone is amazing, it honestly proves it was beyond its time.

So..What is wrong with thunderball, well as I said it's missing a tiny little thing from the previous 3 films. what I mean by that is that it kinda feels different in the sence that they wanted a biger bond movie, and they managed well. Though eventually the franchise would suffer later from trying to make it bigger and better. But aside from that this is an essential bond film. definitely on the top 5.

It's difficult to believe that this movie is almost 45 years old (counting from the year of this review)!!!

(Sir) Sean Connery made six EON production (or ""official"") movies with him starring as James Bond.  They were: Dr. No (1962); From Russia with Love (1963);  Goldfinger (1964); Thunderball (1965); You Only Live Twice (1967); and Diamonds are Forever (1971).

As can be seen from the above list, ""Thunderball"" is the fourth spy film of the British Bond series.  As well it is the fourth to star Connery as the fictional MI6 agent Commander James Bond (code number: 007).

This movie is based on the 1961 novel of the same name as the movie by Ian Fleming (1908 to 1964).

Briefly, 007's mission (code name: Thunderball) is to find two NATO nuclear bombs stolen by SPECTRE (SPecial Executive for Counter-intelligence, Terrorism, Revenge, and Extortion) who holds the world in ransom for not destroying with these bombs a major city in either England or the U.S.  The search leads Bond to the Bahamas, where he encounters Emilio Largo (Adolfo Celi), the card-playing, eye-patch wearing SPECTRE #2 and a beautiful but deadly SPECTRE operative named Fiona Volpe (Luciana Paluzzi).  Backed by the CIA and Largo's mistress Domino (Claudine Auger), Bond's search culminates into an underwater battle with Largo's henchmen.

The title song is belted out by singer (Sir) Tom Jones.

This movie has all the Bond ingredients: gadgets, witty dialogue with ""Bondisms"" (Bond's one-liners), incredible background music, beautiful Bond girls, a memorable villain, and plenty of action.  Also in the cast is  Miss Moneypenny, M, Q, and Felix.  Gorgeous background scenery accompanies most scenes.  (This movie was made on location in Paris, the Bahamas, and London, England.)

Sean Connery brings his characteristic savoir faire to the movie and he holds it together.  A. Celi as Largo is an unforgettable foil to Connery's Bond.  Kudos must go to Luciana Paluzzi for playing a memorable villainess.  (In fact, so memorable that she had trouble getting acting jobs after the movie's release.)

The underwater scenes are spectacular.  Some say they are too long but this is untrue.  They just feel long because they're underwater where the action seems to be in slow motion.

It seems to me that the entire movie was carefully constructed.  For instance, the voices of A. Celi as Largo and C. Auger as Domino are actually dubbed but it's difficult to tell this.

Here's an example of witty dialogue with a Bondism:

While visiting Largo's lair, he and Bond go to so some skeet shooting (using a rifle).  Largo hits a moving skeet while carefully aiming.

Bond: ""Perhaps you can call [a skeet] for me.""
Largo: ""Of course.  Pull!""
Bond: ""It seems terribly difficult.""
(He hits  a moving skeet seemingly not aiming and with his rifle at hip level.)
Bond: ""No it isn't, is it?""

When first released, this movie earned about one hundred and forty-one million dollars worldwide.  That's about nine-hundred and sixty-five million in today's dollars making it the highest grossing Bond film so far.  It won a Academy Award for Best Effects (visual).

The DVD (the one released in Feb., 2007) is flawless in picture and sound quality.  This movie has been digitally restored and I'm sure the picture is just as good (if not better!!) than when it was released almost 45 years ago.  There is also superior sound.  There are two extras in the form of audio commentaries.

Finally, here is some information to consider.  This DVD is actually the first disc of the two disc ""Ultimate Edition.""  Bond fanatics might want to purchase this two disc Ultimate Edition since the second disc has ""the best collection of special features ever assembled for Bond.""  (Unfortunately, the Ultimate Edition is no longer available but can be purchased second-hand.)

In conclusion, to date this is the highest grossing Bond movie and some say the best one.  I leave you with some more witty dialogue from this movie:

This dialogue occurs right before the example dialogue given above where Bond and Largo are about to do some skeet shooting.  Largo is carrying a rifle for skeet shooting:

Bond: ""That [rifle] looks more fitting for a women.""
Largo: ""Do you know much about [rifles and] guns, Mr. Bond?""
Bond: ""No. I know a little about women.""

705130,5,6303651488,"Sean Connery's fourth outing as James Bond, 1965's ""Thunderball"", finds him and the franchise in high gear in a spy extravaganza filmed on location in and around beautiful Nassau, the Bahamas. The underwater film sequences were pioneering at the time and hold up pretty well today.

As the movie opens, Bond is at a health spa in England, recovering from one of his recent adventures. He can't help getting involved in another. The clues he picks up at the spa will lead him to a SPECTRE plot to steal a British bomber with two nuclear bombs aboard, stash the bomber in the ocean, and sell the devices to the highest bidder. Bond ends up in the Bahamas, where his investigation leads him to SPECTRE agent Largo (played with haughty menace by Adolfo Celi) and his beautiful mistress Domino (Claudine Auger). The movie manages not one but thrilling climaxes, a huge underwater fight between British and American frogmen and Largo's SPECTRE henchmen, and a second, one on one fight to the death between Bond and Largo.

Luciana Paluzzi is an added bonus as a gorgeous but deadly red-headed SPECTRE agent who dogs Bond's footsteps. Their meeting in his bathtub features one of the more priceless tongue-in-cheek Bond dialogues.  This movie is very highly recommended as one of the best of the original Bond movies, featuring Sean Connery at his wise-cracking best as the prototypical Bond.",1205107200,,1385,4.910256410256411
705131,5,6303651488,"Top rate Bond film, completely forgotten by many. As I've mentioned before, Connery is absolutely no match for a 2007 Matt Damon (Jason Bourne), but in 1965 he had  no peer. As usual in these films, the plot is both simple and outrageous. An organized international banditry group wants to extort 1 million pounds from NATO countries. They steal a bomber with 2 armed nuclear warheads as ransom. Bond arrives both casually and late at headquarters, having nearly been already killed and having had his mandatory sexual encounters with two gorgeous underground types.(If you ever see Shirley Booth or Rose Marie in one of these films, they've accidentally wandered onto the wrong set). With time running out, again and again the enemy has a chance to put Mr. Bond away for good, but fails to do so, thus lengthening the film, but also enabling a wild, realistic finale,accompanied by beautiful photography and a stirring musical score. Do not let alleged inferior Bond films fool you; this production can stand tall against the best of the others.",1203292800,7,1046,4.943181818181818
705212,4,6303651488,"`Here comes the biggest Bond of them all!' screamed the ads. But while this is still the high water mark of the series at the box-office - selling more tickets than any other Bond, inflation-adjusted to today's prices its box-office take would exceed a billion dollars - it's also pretty much the clunkiest Bond in its determination to throw everything and the kitchen sink into the mix.

Opening with an excellently choreographed but very badly over-edited fight sequence, the formula is fully established here: the megalomaniacal villain, the ruthless disposal of underlings, perverted villain (""Vargas does not drink, does not smoke, does not make love. What do you do, Vargas?""), the obligatory three women for Bond to dally with and the archetypal Maurice Binder title sequence replacing Robert Brownjohn's earlier efforts (here an underwater ballet of men with harpoons pursuing silhouetted naked girls). It does tend to drag in places, but is still markedly superior to the majority of Roger Moore's efforts.

Much has been made over the years of the film's convoluted legal history. Fleming's novel was an unauthorised adaptation of a screenplay he co-wrote with Kevin McClory and Jack Whittingham in an earlier, unsuccessful attempt to launch the series. After much wrangling, McClory was awarded the screen rights and formed an uneasy alliance with Broccoli and Saltzman to co-produce the film, a move that was have legal consequences beyond remake Never Say Never Again and lead to decades of law suits.

The new cook in the broth leads to a rather more schoolboyish Bond, but the film does take a few enjoyable swipes at him, such as Lucianna Paluzzi's villainess taunting his sexual arrogance - ""I forgot your ego, Mr. Bond. James Bond, the one where he has to make love to a woman, and she starts to hear heavenly choirs singing. She repents, and turns to the side of right and virtue..."" The saddest sight is Earl Cameron, the black actor who distinguished such 50's British films as Sapphire and Flame in the Streets reduced to the role of messenger boy, though at least he fares better than Quarrel in Dr No. If the role of Felix Leiter was intended to paper over gaps in the narrative, Cameron's Pinder is there only to drop Bond off at the next setpiece.

Although it appears there is no definitive version of the film - there are various cuts in circulation because of the rush to get the film ready for its premiere, while the `James Bond will return in On Her Majesty's Secret Service' caption seems lost forever - this is as close to it as we're likely to see, though a featurette does handily point out the differences between various versions. Handily one of the audio commentaries also offers the chance to hear the original Dionne Warwick title song Mr Kiss Kiss Bang Bang, possibly the best song ever written for a Bond film (""He's smooth and he's sharp/And like a shark he looks for trouble/That's why the zero's double/Mr Kiss Kiss Bang Bang"") only to get ditched for the Tom Jones song built around the title for promotional reasons. There's also a 48-minute TV special The Incredible World of James Bond, a radio spot advertising a beauty contest to find girls for OHMSS (planned as the next Bond film), production designer Ken Adams' home movie footage, the famous documentary A Child's Guide to Blowing Up a Motor Car and more besides on a well-packed two-disc set.",1202860800,,3399,4.865284974093265

The basic plot is simple but good: Largo, working for Spectre, steals atomic missiles and demands a ransom. Unfortunately, ""Thunderball"" is considerably longer than the previous movies, but there's less plot. The script is dull and the direction lifeless. Most of the budget seems to have been spent on the underwater sequences. But they're not well made, only chaotic and go on for way too long. They become the anticlimax of a movie that had already lost my interest. ""Thunderball"" is one of the few Bond movies that manages to bore me. Not recommended.",1201219200,4,800,5.965217391304348
705214,5,6303651488,"One of the great things about the hobby of cinema is the ability  to re-evaluate films throughout the course of one's lifetime, and note how time and experience can alter our perceptions.

I went with my parents to see Thunderball at age 11, when it premiered in `65, and remember feeling that this highly touted entry to the series didn't live up to my enjoyment of the previous three 007 pictures--particularly Goldfinger.  Now, having viewed the re-mastered Thunderball DVD, I'm grateful I refrained from watching Thunderball for over thirty years, as my appreciation for this film has increased tenfold, and I could've killed the experience through over exposure.

True, the film is unusually long and slow-paced, but rather than feeling bored, I luxuriated in every scene, but this wouldn't hold true if any of Connery's successors had been cast in Thunderball instead of him.

His screen presence and ability to suspend our disbelief are the magic of his star-power.  My only real complaint, in terms of pacing, was the climactic underwater battle, as it would've been twice as exciting if it had been at least half as long.  I always enjoyed the soundtrack, and it's wonderful hearing Barry's score along with the designated action & drama once again.",1196467200,7,1258,5.019230769230769
705215,4,6303651488,"Following up on arguably the most perfect Bond film ever made, ""Goldfinger"", Thunderball still keeps the series very strong and eventful.  Thunderball is another fabulous Sean Connery classic Bond film, that can almost satisfy everyone with a little bit of everyhting in the mix.  A superb villain, great locations, lots of interesting characters, cool gadgets, and a fun story are some of the great things that make up this movie.

With a viewing length of a little over 2 hours, I must admit that Thunderball was a bit slower moving than some of the earlier Bond films.  As mentioned by many people, its the underwater scenes that feel quite draggy, and honestly it feels like everything slows down, ironically, since things tend to move slower in water.  The climax of the film takes place underwater too, and unfortunately, is also begging to end at some point or another.  But on the other hand, I thought the underwater shots were well done, and look quite clear in the new digitally remastered edition.

A few other things that bothered me in the film was the obvious poor editing, especially throughout the action sequences and when the film was sped up to give us the illusion that Largo's boat was going very fast.  I guess that's 1960's work for you, but the earlier Bond films seem to have smoother action scenes.  But these are just picky little things, and for the most part, I was pleased with the rest of the film.

As always with the Connery films, the story held together well and was very entertaining and well written.  The large variety of charcaters helped hold the interest, and scenes with the villain ""Emilio Largo"" were definetly the highlights, commanding the respect as one of the better of the Bond villains.  Unlike Goldfinger, Largo is a SPECTRE agent (also known as #2), and we do have the pleasure of hearing (but not yet seeing - wait till the next movie) Blofeld in the movie on a few occasions.  The plot is centered around SPECTRE attempting to gain power by aquiring some atomic weapons to threaten for large sums of money.  Simple plot, but like I said, it is still well done.

Fans of Bond action might be a little dissapointed with Thunderball, and what action there is, try not to focus on the editing, for that can make it even worse.  For fans of everyhting else Bond, this is a definite keeper.  Overall, Thunderball is still one of the better Bond films by far, and still displays Connery at his strongest.

705217,4,6303651488,"This is the fourth of the Connery Bonds so far. It was released in 1965,hyped to the hilt and once again proved to be box office gold for its' producers Saltzman and Broccoli.
The movie begins with its' usual(by now) prologue. This has Bond attending the funeral of one deceased Colonel Bouvar. After the funeral the grieving widow returns home and James is there to greet her and offer his condolences. He slugs her and she flies backwards over a table. Seems the Colonel is still alive and kicking,disguised as his wife. The fight continues until Bond finally disposes of the Colonel once and for all.
The opening music starts and it is sung by Tom Jones. Jones' masculine,bluesy and no holds barred rendition fits nicely into the Bond cannon of music. Almost a male counterpoint to the previous Bassey sung theme song.
This time around,as usual,the man with the white cat pulling all the strings and Bonds'arch enemy Ernst Blofeld is trying to create a nuclear holocaust. And he/SPECTRE is demanding a hefty ransom of some $280,000,000 from NATO.He places an operative aboard a British Vulcan jet carrying two nuclear bombs who highjacks the plane and lands it into the sea off the Bahamas.
Bond gets his briefing by ""M"" and NATO and is off. He visits a health spa where at one point is strapped onto an expanding and contracting table that's supposed to be good for the back. But someone lurks nearby,Bond hears a male voice and the switch is set up to the maximum speed. Bond has nearly had it when his masseuse re-enters and turns the device off. Bond has a good idea who it might be and when he discovers his assailant sitting in a steam box,he turns the tables by locking the doors and turning the heat up to the max. James nonchalantly walks off.
The man Blofeld has entrusted his dastardly scheme to is one Emilio Fargo(Adolfo Celi)in Nassau. His lovely assistant Domino(Claudine Auger) would become Bonds' femme fatale in this film and the one he would eventually turn to his side with his usual persuasive ""techniques"".Fargo has retrieved the bombs by now and has them firmly ensconced in a cave in the area of the bomber which is far underwater and well camoflaged. The world has just six days to pay the ransom(the drop off area just off Burma) or Blofeld will initiate undescribable destruction on the world.
Bond quickly finds Largo's home. He does some scouting and a little sabotage along the way. One scene has James using a jet-pack to escape the clutches of Largos' henchman. Largo also has a fondness for pet sharks...in his pool. Bond would later return and inadvertently get caught in the pool with only one way out,the way the sharks go IN.It's dicey but he eventually makes it out. As the time grows very short and the NATO leaders are about to give in Bond goes back to Largos'place in time to blend himself in with his diving team. He has already discovered the whereabouts of the lost plane but now he aims to find the bombs. He accompanies them to the underwater cave where the bombs are being stored. James is shortly found out and is locked in while Largo and crew carry the bombs off. Bond searches and finally finds his way out of the chamber only to end up at the bottom of a very large but dry sinkhole. Due to a homing pellet he had smartly swallowed before leaving with Largo and company he is soon airlifted out of the hole and back into action.
Bond goes back after the bombs but this time he brings help with him. There is a long and huge underwater struggle between the good guys and bad. Largo flees to a waiting boat and speeds off,with James aboard. Does he manage to overcome Largo? Will the bombs be retrieved in time? Or will the world be forced to pay Dr. Blofeld and the evil SPECTRE?These questions and many more are answered in the final exciting moments of the film.
This film has everything from ""Q's"" new gadgets,new technology like the Vulcan bomber and the jet-pack and thrown into everything some of the most spectacular underwater sequences ever filmed. And with this new DVDs' remastering the colours give the film just that much greater an impact when you view it.
Also in this film and an aspect I have failed to mention but is present to a greater or lesser degree in all of the Connery Bonds I will review is the fabulous stuntwork. These pictures had some of the greatest stuntmen in the business at the time working on them. Pros all and if memory serves Connery had as great a rapport with all his stunt people,as he did with his co-stars. Thunderball especially drives the stunt work home as some of the sequences are second to none. Underwater sequences always require greater care than most because there just that many more things that can go wrong. And the crew did have a few close calls with those sharks. They were very real.
All in all ""Thunderball"" is another enjoyable entry in the Connery/Bond line of pictures. All the usual marks of these films were here in abundance from the suave,sophisticated star himself to the usual gadgetry,to Monneypenny to his arch-nemesis Dr. Blofeld and SPECTRE.And we have yet to see exactly who this mystery cat lover is through most of these films. A great audience hook in and of itself. Due to the lovely remastering,this DVD brings this movie home like never before. Why don't you bring a copy home for yourself?",1189987200,,5328,4.621308016877637
705218,4,6303651488,"It is hardly possible to imagine an actor inject so much charisma into a role as Connery does here as Bond in Thunderball.  Truth be told, it is really the glue that holds a movie together that otherwise might look rather frayed round the edges, despite the spectacularly tasty ingredients on display.
So what is it about?  SPECTRE, Bond's arch enemies, have hatched a plan to seize two nuclear warheads from the British by capturing a Vulcan bomber on a training mission.  Then, of course, a diabolical megalomaniac asks for 100 million dollars while stroking his cat.  All the double-0's are brought in to get put on the case - but Bond has a lead - and of course it involves seducing a beautiful woman, in an exotic location (in this case, the ex-Miss France Claudine Auger, in Nassau, Bahamas).  Can Bond seduce her in time to find the bombs before they are used?
As a general rule, the better the Bond villain, the better the Bond movie - and so it proves in this case.  Adolfo Celi plays the villain efficiently enough, without being truly inspired.  He comes across as a well paid hired hand, rather than an egomaniacal adversary.  The villainess, on the other hand, the sexy redhead played by Luciana Paluzzi, comes across as a much more sophisticated foil for Bond's charms and wit, with a genuine sense of menace.
Another plus for the movie is the photography.  On every level it is superior to its predecessors - filmed for the first time in widescreen, Ken Adams outlandish sets have room to breathe for the first time, and the groundbreaking underwater photography is surprisingly (forgive me) fluid and clear.  In fact, the underwater scenes are the true draw of the movie, adding a new dimension to Bond's skills - however, they also prove to be the movies drawback, as they are drawn out far too long in the climactic underwater battle.  The movie is going swimmingly though (apologies again..) until the very final scene on board the yacht which jettisons its cocoon to become a hydrofoil.  This has been so ludicrously speeded up for dramatic effect, as to do exactly the opposite, and spoil the moment.
The Ultimate Edition has the usual improved picture, and sound.  The sound in particular has been given better depth without anything too tricksy and obvious with surround effects.  For extras, as usual the Special Edition extras are all here, including the superb documentary charting the troubled history of the production.  In addition, there is an abundance of archive material which will interest the die-hards...vintage promotional featurettes and an NBC hour long special on Bond up to this point.  An interesting addition is some home movie footage from the set designer Ken Adams talking about the location shooting, and the fun that went on behind the cameras.
So to summarise, with a bit of trimming and more careful use of speeded up action scenes, this could have been a 5 star classic, as it is, it is still a very respectable and enjoyable 4 star entry into the Bond franchise, with Connery at his peak.  This edition is certainly the way to see it.",1187481600,,3086,4.7706766917293235
705219,5,6303651488,"While many rank GOLDFINGER as the best Bond ever, THUNDERBALL has always been my favorite.  To me it had all the Bond ingredients (gadgets, lots of sharks, the Aston Martin, scuba diving, gorgeous babes & plenty of action) as well as a cohesive plot.  Spectre remains one of the most formidable villains in Bond history, even after all these years.

The underwater brawl between the Spectre divers and the Navy(?) divers remains a classic climactic scene in all of the Bond movies.  I'm just guessing that they were Navy (SEALS?) as usually Army guys are not trained in scuba operations.

Connery's final Bond movie, NEVER SAY NEVER AGAIN, was more-or-less a remake of THUNDERBALL.  There were a few variations here & there, but the basic plotline & many of the elements remained the same.  This goes to show just how enduring THUNDERBALL was to the Connery Bond movies.",1181606400,4,870,4.837837837837838
705220,3,6303651488,"Bad guys steal a couple of nukes from the French. Bond has to find them. So much for the plot.

The most striking thing about this film is how badly it has aged. For one thing, parody has taken its toll. When Mike Myers's mined the 007 films for his ""Austen Powers"" series, Thunderball made for a most generous lode. From evil genius Emilio Largo's pet cat (turned hairless for Powers) to the shark-filled swimming pool (just add lasers) to the death-dealing chairs (substitute flames for electricity and voila!) the movie is already a parody of itself. Add to this Bond's brutal sexism -- the scene in which he forces an uninterested female doctor to kiss him is truly retch-inducing - and you have a real embarrassment. I recently watched this on a school trip with a bunch of teens and felt, in spite of the PG rating, that this film was a much more problematic movie than the R-rated ""Blood Diamonds.""

Whateverr. Enjoy the film for its anachronistic war of the sexes and for the quite silly (to modern eyes) evil twists. Also, watch for bizarre plot holes. In one scene, Bond is dallying with one of his lady loves. A bad guy sneaks up off camera. Bond quickly pulls out a spear gun and skewers the poor man to a tree. Then he and the lady just walk off, leaving the corpse to...whom exactly? And the poor drowned devils who died when their plane sank in the Caribbean? In spite of the prevalent sharks, they are quite well-preserved when Bond finds them a week later. Cheers!",1177372800,,1481,4.522388059701493

705305,5,6303651488,"In the wake of the enormous success of GOLDFINGER, THUNDERBALL became one of the most anticipated films in cinema history.  ""Bondmania"" was at a fever pitch in the 1960s and that lended a certain air of confidence to the cast and crew.  By Bond's fourth adventure, everyone was assured of success and everything was done on the largest scale possible.  THUNDERBALL is often regarded, along with GOLDFINGER, as one of the better Bond films.  It contains all of the elements of a good Bond flick at a time when Bond was not tired or clichd.  Bond's fourth adventure finds him taking to the sea, culminating in some of the most spectacular underwater fight footage ever recorded.  And with Terence Young once again taking the director's chair after his temporary hiatus, the audience and the film is in good hands.

After the opening ""gun barrel"" sequence, re-shot for the first time in widescreen format with Sean Connery playing the part, we are greeted with the opening pre-credits ""teaser.""  Audiences loved GOLDFINGER's teaser and the producers knew that they would have to arise to the occasion. We find Bond in France discreetly attending the funeral of Colonel Jacques Bouvar, SPECTRE's Number Six, who we learn is personally responsible for the death of two of Bond's colleagues.  Thanks to Bond's sharp eyes, he determines that the Colonel has faked his own death and Bond makes it a priority to finish the job personally.  After a brutal fight sequence, Bond strangles Bouvar and escapes using a jet pack.  The Bell Rocket Belt used was a functioning jet pack, capable of a flight time of twenty one seconds.  The scene is spectacular, all the more so because of the real jet pack.  Bond makes his way to his waiting Aston Martin DB5 (first seen in GOLDFINGER) and prevents his enemies from reaching him with the use of rear-firing water canons--a new feature of the DB5.  The water rushes over the screen and seamlessly morphs into the opening credits.  Maurice Binder serves up a great title sequence featuring the naked silhouettes of female swimmers being chased by armed scuba divers.  The colors are rich and vibrant and maintain the visual themes of the previous title sequences.  Tom Jones belts out the title track, containing some awkward lyrics about our protagonist.  I suppose it's hard to work Thunderball into song lyrics, leaving us only with ""He strikes...like Thunderball.""

The plot of the film is, once again, larger than life and would end up being a frequently copied and parodied theme.  SPECTRE, this time represented by one-eyed Number Two, Monsieur Emilio Largo (Adolfo Celi), has managed to penetrate NATO forces and hijack two nuclear missiles.  SPECTRE threatens to destroy two cities if NATO does not agree to cough up 280 million.  It is described as SPECTRE's most ambitious project to date.  Blofeld makes his second appearance, though once again we cannot see his face, in a secret French lair.  The set is wonderful, containing a long table with all of SPECTRE's top officials present.  Here we meet Numbers Seven, Ten, Five (obviously, they have replaced the previous Number Five of FROM RUSSIA WITH LOVE), Nine, and Eleven.  We also get a sense of the range of SPECTRE's activities (blackmail, assassination, crime consultation, and narcotics) and also the brutal efficiency of Number One, who kills Number Nine on suspicion of embezzlement.  It is a sign to all those present of what the consequences of failure are.  Number Two must not fail in his NATO plans!

The first part of the film is filled with wonderful espionage as we learn how SPECTRE has penetrated NATO security.  The actual hijacking of the missiles is spectacular.  After SPECTRE has transmitted its demands to Britain, MI6 is called into action to find those missiles at all costs.  All of the 00 agents are called in on this one and sent to different parts of the world to try and discover the hiding place before it is too late.  Bond asks to be reassigned to Nassau because he believes he has a lead on the case, stemming from his experiences early on in the film.  Of course, his instincts are correct and soon Bond finds himself playing a game of cat and mouse with Emilio Largo, who is all to aware of who Bond is and what he intends to do.  What follows is a terrific storyline in which Bond inches his way closer to Largo's operation to discover the villain's secrets, with all of the destruction, love-making, and mayhem that entails.

Many have complained that THUNDERBALL is too long (at 130 minutes) and that the last half hour of the film is incredibly slow.  Shot entirely underwater, the last bit of the film can seem long due to the slow movement of underwater action.  But I do not think its pace suffers at all.  I can remember seeing the film on television and thinking that it was a bit dull.  But with the enhanced sound of the score pushing the beautifully restored images of the Ultimate Edition, I believe these sequences shine.  They truly look spectacular and it is certainly the most ambitious underwater fight sequence I've ever seen.  A seemingly endless supply of divers swim from all angles, launching an equally endless supply of harpoons at each other.  The underwater images are surprisingly clear and we can honestly say that we haven't seen anything quite like it before (or since).  Bond breaks new ground here and I think the action is as suspenseful as ever.  In fact, the lack of sound underwater (besides the score) can actually increase the tension of the moment, in a manner reminiscent of 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY, produced three years later).

Connery, once again, is impeccable as Bond.  Reunited with director Terence Young, whom many say is the real inspiration for Bond's class and sophistication, Connery plays the role with a renewed sense of vigor and style.  I particularly enjoyed the increasing chemistry between Q (Desmond Llewelyn) and Connery.  If they were slightly antagonistic in GOLDFINGER, they are thoroughly annoyed with each other here.  Q is back with a host of new gadgets suited to the underwater nature of the film: a homing device pill that Bond can swallow, a watch that doubles as a Geiger counter, a waterproof camera that doubles as a Geiger counter, a mini signal flare, and a small rebreather (capable of giving Bond an extra few minutes of air underwater in a pinch).  Bond is fitted with these devices in the field and, naturally, they all get put to use before the film is out.

The Bond girls in THUNDERBALL are some of the most beautiful Bond girls of all.  Former Miss France, Claudine Auger, plays the main role of Domino Derval, an absolutely stunning beauty who proves to be both elegant and athletic.  Her beauty and grace remind me of Audrey Hepburn.  She is everything a Bond girl can hope to be.  Opposite her is the film's female protagonist, femme fatale Fiona Volpe (Luciana Paluzzi), a deadly girl who seduces Bond (or is it Bond who seduces her?).  Unfortunately, their play is not long lived, for the girl capable of stopping traffic with her beauty is also capable of stopping bullets--particularly when Bond throws her deliberately into their path!  Also of Bond girl note is Bond's assistant, Paula Caplan, played by Martine Beswick.  Bond fans will remember her as first appearing in FROM RUSSIA WITH LOVE as Zora the gypsy dancer.

Our villain Emilio Largo (Adolfo Celi), for my tastes, is a bit bland.  Perhaps it is because he seems merely SPECTRE's pawn, but Largo seems to lack the necessary evil of his predecessors.  Of course, he is evil.  But he is out for blackmail money and doesn't seem personally invested in the affair other than to generate profit for SPECTRE.  Besides his personal shark pool and his excellent taste for women, there really isn't much going for him.  Indeed, Bond's immediate threats in this film seem to revolve around the dangers of being underwater--hand grenades used as depth charges, killer sharks, and an army of henchmen armed with powerful harpoons--rather than from menacing villains and uniquely skilled henchmen.  Whatever the case, THUNDERBALL still manages to be a roaring success and the action is still quite good.  It won't be the last time that the evil villains are left a little underdeveloped.

All in all, I believe THUNDERBALL is one of the best of the Bond series.  Connery is fantastic in his role, Terence Young's directing is superb, the women are some of the most beautiful we have seen yet, and the action breaks new ground in special effects.  Make sure that you get the 2-disc Ultimate Edition set.  The Ultimate Edition, like all of these releases, is absolutely wonderful.  The DTS sound is amazing and really bring the action and John Barry's terrific score to life.  The picture is amazing and blows the old television and DVD releases out of the water (I had to say it).  Plus, it is packed with extras, including a ""Making of"" documentary, a documentary about the ""Thunderball Phenomenon"" created by the film, and a 45 minute television production released at the time exploring ""The World of James Bond.""  I highly recommend it to any Bond fan or anyone interested in classic action pictures.  THUNDERBALL holds up well to the test of time.",1174003200,37,9223,4.834183673469388

705309,5,6303651488,"This movie was the next in the Bond series after ""Goldfinger."" This movie builds upon the tradition of the previous movie, giving you more of everything. More gadgets, more action, a more involved plot, an even more nefarious villain, and more women.

The plot is simple. S.P.E.C.T.R.E.'s #2 man leads a rather complex scheme to steal two nuclear bombs carried by a British Vulcan bomber. All the double-Os are mobilized to find who stole the bombs and to get them back to prevent having to pay the $100 million ransom, a rather princely sum in 1965. Thanks to a fortuitous meeting with Count Lippe (Guy Doleman) at a spa, James Bond believes he may have a lead on where the bombs went. You might guess it is not Canada, where M wants to send him.

Up until the bombs are captured by Emilio Largo (Adolfo Celi), this movie is a classic spy movie with minimal gadgets (except right at the very beginning, where Bond gets to escape from a villa with a rocket pack and then zooms off in his Aston-Martin DB-5, which is a fun car in any era with machine guns, ejection seat, and numerous other goodies no spy should be without) and lots of spy movie action. Once Largo takes the bombs, the tech gets higher as does the action.

There is lots of maneuvering in the Bahamas while looking for the bombs until an underwater fight that has to be the best hand-to-hand underwater fight ever filmed, and foreshadows the battle in space in ""Moonraker."" Of course, Largo has a getaway plan, which involves a hydrofoil, very state-of-the-art in 1965.

There are a number of other fun technical devices that appear throughout the movie, but it is more interesting to find them yourself than have me tell you about them.

The title song was sung by Tom Jones, who in 1965 was near the peak of his popularity, with a large number of hit songs and his own tv show. Tom Jones was perhaps the first well-known pop star to sing a Bond title song, but he would not be the last.

The Ultimate Edition has the cleanest and most complete picture of any release of ""Thunderball.""  If you are a first time buyer, or looking to upgrade from VHS or the first DVD release, this version is the best available.

The Ultimate Edition also has features unavailable in the previous Special Edition version.  Among the interesting featurettes is ""A Child's Guide to Blowing Up a Motor Car,"" a 1965 Ford promotional film, ""On Location with Ken Adam,"" ""Bill Suitor:  The Rocket Man Movies,"" ""The Secret History of Thunderball"" and more.  It seems to me that this edition of ""Thunderball"" has many extras not available in the Special Edition that I found enjoyable.

This movie is another of the best of Bond movies. James Bond gets to do some tongue-in-cheek, but again it is very natural and fitting with his super-spy image. There are really bad people. So bad that you would be happy to exterminate them yourself. There are some very lovely and strong women. In fact, one of the opposition is a very strong woman who takes care of Count Lippe in a dramatic way, and then makes an escape that is just as dramatic.

This movie is classic in many ways, and enjoyable time after time. I highly recommend it as a spy film, a Bond film, and a classic 60's film. Somewhat dated, but enjoyably so, it is one of the best of a genre and an era.

It continued with the Bond theme that started in Dr. No but swayed away in Goldfinger when Bond abandoned Sector for the sake of a one villain rather than an organization. Movie well done, exciting and an excellent Sean Connery Performance.",1173312000,,300,5.02
705389,5,6303651488,"I give all the Connery films 5 stars, but that's a topic for another discussion.

What I wanted to do was to offer some clarification on all these ""new"" versions.  (Maybe this is already common knowledge, but here goes anyway.)  I recently bought the new ""widescreen"" version of Thunderball, and also the 2-disc Ultimate version of You Only Live Twice, (which only seems to be for sale by Amazon Marketplace sellers).

The 2-disc single-movie offerings by Amazon Marketplace sellers are from the new ""Ultimate"" box sets that the sellers are breaking up and selling off as individual movies.  These each come in a slim case with 2 discs (1 for the movie, and 1 for the special features).

The ""widescreen"" versions (of which only Goldfinger, Thunderball, The Spy Who Loved Me, For Your Eyes Only, License to Kill, and Goldeneye are currently available) come in a regular-size case, and the disc is the same as disc #1 from the Ultimate sets (in other words, you get the restored movie, but no special features except an optional commentary track). My Thunderball DVD came with an insert that pictured all 20 DVDs, and indicated that the rest will be coming soon.

The cover artwork is almost identical for these 2 versions.  For easy identification, on the 1-disc regular-case DVDs, the bottom panel gray/black montage has the white words ""James Bond"" along with a crest, while the 2-disc movies taken from the Ultimate box sets have that plus the words ""Ultimate Edition"" in gold.

A few days ago, I saw a review of either the widescreen Thunderball or Goldfinger DVD where the reviewer complained that there were no special features included.  That's because all the features (except optional in-movie commentary) are packed on the 2nd disc (which is only in the Ultimate package).

So, if you just want specific movies, without having to buy a whole box set, you can save yourself some money by choosing these ""widescreen"" versions which Amazon is selling for $10-12 (as long as you don't need the special features).  Otherwise, you'll need to pony up $20+ per movie to the Marketplace sellers.",1173139200,4,2096,4.889830508474576

Quick-paced, a multi-cast and villainous, it's very entertaining and becomes a staple for the Bond series. The editing is great, except for an awkward carnival chase scene.

705392,4,6303651488,"I was somewhat reluctant to buy this particular version of ""Thunderball"" when I noticed that the specifications on the rear sleeve of the DVD packaging listed the running time at 125 minutes. As most James Bond enthusiasts are probably aware, the original running time of this film is 130 minutes (one of the longer Bond movies.) I was reasonably concerned. Was I about to purchase an incomplete version? I decided to take a chance and get it, as it is one of the more enjoyable entries in the Bond series. When I checked the actual run time on the display on my DVD player, my worries were laid to rest. The film is fully complete at 130 minutes and not 125 minutes as the packaging indicates. The packaging is wrong. Now, in regards to the movie itself: This newly digitally remastered version (released on Feb. 6, 2007) is incredibly stunning. The picture quality is absolutely gorgeous and the clarity is amazing. This film looks like it was shot last week instead of 42 years ago. The sound options include Dolby Digital 5.1 and DTS Surround, and naturally it sounds fantastic. As far as picture and sound quality, this is impeccable. It just doesn't get much better. When originally released in 1965, this fourth entry in the James Bond series suffered from comparison to its two admittedly superior predecessors, ""From Russia with Love"" and ""Goldfinger"". However, time has proved it to be one of the stronger and more watchable movies in the Bond library and vastly superior to the remaining Sean Connery outings that followed, ""You Only Live Twice"" -which I still happen to enjoy- and the lackluster ""Diamonds Are Forever"". With Connery in top form as 007 and assured direction by Terence Young, ""Thunderball"" is a solid effort that no true Bond fan should be without. I give it 4 out of 5 stars. As with the other Bond re-releases, this newly remastered 'ultimate edition' has undergone a painstaking frame by frame restoration and looks and sounds superb.

705395,3,6303651488,"Thunderball is a very good Bond film, perhaps a bit overlong, but none the less, it was trying to out do the success and the excess of Goldfinger.  This most recent version has undergone a great visual and audio restoration, looking and sounding better than it ever has before.

This DVD features AC-3 5.1 surround sound, plus DTS, and original mono tracks. It also has a running audio commentary track. ... but that's all, no other features or extras, not even the original theatrical trailer.

And this is a major dissapointment, as it is marketed and packaged to lend the impression that this is the single version of the ultimate edition found in the box set.

It's hard to understand why MGM decided to market this, and the other single Bond titles (Goldfinger, License to kill, The spy who loved me, For your eyes only, and Goldeneye) this way.

 But it seems to be a greedy ploy, on their behalf, cheat the fans out of the special features, in order to pump up sales of the ultimate edition box sets, and later when enough complaints have deminished sales of these single disc editions, re-issue them again, as 2 disc edition, with the special features at a higher price.

Seems to me that MGM has taken an old page out of the Universal pictures marketing book, remember when they would release a full screen, widescreen, 5.1, and DTS version of just about every major title they put out, instead of taking care of all of that with 1 edition with dual layering?

my recommendation is either spring for the ultimate edition sets, or wait for the next generation of the single editions, that will no doubt have the special features restored.

The 3 star review is for the lack of what SHOULD have been included, and not for the great job that was done by the restoration crew.

So please don't be taken in by the misinformation Amazon is currently showing for this, and the other single Bond titles.",1170720000,3,1904,4.606508875739645

The film does get a little slow in the middle, but if the viewer can hang in there, it comes roaring back to a satisfying conclusion.  As always, Sean Connery is THE James Bond, and he is excellent in this film.  He pulls off the role with just the right combination of realism and humor; the part where he makes it with the film's female villain ""for King and Country"" is absolutely hilarious.

705506,3,6303651488,"A NATO Vulcan Bomber carrying two atomic bombs had crashed in the Caribbean... To make a serious situation even more critical, SPECTRE then informed the British government that it had hijacked the plane's cargo... Unless a ransom of 100 million was paid in seven days, a major city in England or the US would be destroyed...

M16 called in all its top agents, but only one had a lead: James Bond... With four days to go, 007 flew to the Bahamas, where a femme fatale, a beautiful avenger, and a big game predator fish collector, a tough Italian mafia type posing as a millionaire adventurer in Nassau, called Emilio Largo awaited him... Largo (Adolpho Celi) is actually the ruthless one-eyed SPECTRE No. 2, who can easily turn from charmer to killer when SPECTRE business is at stake...

Fiona Volpe's introduction while wearing a sheer neglig&eacute;e in Derbal's (Paul Stassino) bedroom was definitely an early highlight of ""Thunderball."" Luciana Paluzzi is a very sexy ruthless villain... Definitely one of the better female characters in the series...

Bond appears to be a bit cavalier at times--spending far too much time bedding one conquest after another--when duty calls, he responds quickly and decisively... After three films, the 007 character has been established... Now, it's time for Bond to have a little fun--as shown in the scene where he consumes Conch Chowder, Beluga Caviar and Dom Perignon '55, or the scene in the French chteau where he kills SPECTRE's agent and takes time to throw flowers on the body or the scene in Shrublands where he discovers the body of a NATO aerial observer and steals a bit of fruit as he leaves... Touches like these set ""Thunderball"" apart from other Bond movies...

With ingenious gadgets provided by Q, wonderful underwater sequences, great special visual effects (rewarded with an Oscar), nice music score, and exotic scenery, the film remains as a lavish tropical paradise where sandy beaches, coral reefs and bikinis prevailed... The viewer suddenly gets a tremendous sense of the tropics, of carefree vacations, cool tropical drinks, and moonlights romance...",1168732800,3,2117,5.0922190201729105
705507,5,6303651488,"This film somehow sums up a feeling of nostalgia and endearment for the way it engulfed audiences, myself included, into the wonderful world of James Bond. Sean Connery did it with such effortless and natural charm and aplomb like no other. He's a tough and resourceful blunt instrument with a level of intelligence sophistication still impressive to this day. The world of THUNDERBALL is elegant where the villains live an opulent style of life which is a veneer for their sinister plans. In a bit of irony James Bond lives in that same world and he is up to the challenge to foil whatever mayhem they concoct.

After a one-film hiatus SPECTRE returns. So has Sean Connery as he was finally groomed to perfection as the definitive screen incarnation of James Bond in GOLDFINGER. Terence Young is also back as director. However, he seems to have been influenced over the fine-tuning that Guy Hamilton brought to the main character and overall tone of GOLDFINGER. Due to that film's success Young seems to be floundering here being diverted from his vision of the character that he helped bring to the screen. Young is 180 degrees from being the auteur he envisioned himself to be.

The film seems loosely constructed and leisurely acted. Adolfo Celi as Emilio Largo looks the part but he never seems a real threat to Bond. In fact he seems to lose every encounter with Bond whether it be at the gambling tables or engaging in idle banter on the merits of women vs. guns. Bond outdoes him in skeet shooting without even looking at the target.

What makes the film very memorable is John Barry's rich score and Lamar Boren's beautiful and colorful underwater photography. The two went hand in hand. I also thought the villains' plot to hijack a Vulcan jet was extremely well filmed and executed. This film has a very British feel to as it should have.

This film has always been a favourite with diving and snorkeling enthusiasts. I met a very young couple this summer at the beach club. I happened to mention James Bond. These two half my age immediately said, ""Thunderball!"" Do you like ""Thunderball?"" I replied, ""Absolutely. And by the way I see you are drinking Red Stripe Beer. Did you know that when Bond tosses Quarrel into those corrugated cartons in DR. NO those are cases of Red Stripe Beer?"" And so I met some new Bond fans.",1164067200,2,2333,4.682926829268292
705508,4,6303651488,"I'm not sure how it's never happened, but I've never seen a James Bond film. I didn't see any of them. I've heard of them of course, but finally while walking in a local library...I stumbled on this one and figured why not. Well, for my first James Bond experience I was pretty satisfied. It's a decent spy film, with some good action scenes and Sean Connery's burning charisma.

The film is very entertaining (enough for 5 stars), but I'm giving it four stars for two reasons. (A) The film is too long. It's only 2 hours and 12 minutes, but there are times it seems to be much longer. The film has a lot of action sequences, but it still kind of drifts off into being dull at times. (B) There's a scene at the end where Bond is forced to jump off a boat with a woman and a man. They all get off the boat and a plane drops a small raft down to them. Bond and the girl get on it, but the man has disappeared. A little odd. But, anyway. The movie opens nicely with James Bond getting in a fight and escaping on a jet pack. If you have a spy movie, it has to open with a bang. Anyway, the plot revolves around an organization called SPECTRE hijacking a NATO plane with two atomic warheads; James Bond is, of course, sent to retrieve them. Bond travels to a tropical island called Nassau, gets cozy with a few women, and then meets Emilio Largo (Adolfo Celi) a high ranking agent of SPECTRE. He also meets his bond girl Domino (Claudine Auger), who happens to be with Emilio. Of course, in the film, Bond survives numerous murder attempts and even is forced to swim in a shark-filled pool at one time. The movie is pretty over-the-top (you can see some moments here that inspired the Austin Powers films); It's heavy on sexual innuendo (and no, I'm not complaining); The Bond girls are pretty hot. For an action movie it's pretty good. It has it's flaws, but you'll be entertained for the most part. Besides, if you're familar with the James Bond series you should know what you're in for anyway.

  Blofeld (Anthony Dawson/ voice of Eric Pohlmann), the evil man with the white cat, is still after James Bond (Sean Connery).  With the help of Largo (Adolfo Celi), they have sent Count Lippe (Guy Doleman) to do Bond in.  They rigged a spine-stretching machine that almost kills him, but after some ""physical therapy"" from Pat Fearing (Molly Peters), Bond is back into tip-top shape.
  With Plan A foiled, now the Russians will send out Angelo (Paul Stassino), who is a dead-ringer for Commander Francois Derval.  They kill Derval and replace him with Angelo. Bond already found Derval dead at the Shrublands spa, so now he is in search of Derval's sister, Domino (Claudine Auger).

Everything was awesome-the pre-title sequence, the theme song (I LOVED the theme song,great job Tom Jones), most especially, the underwater fight scene. That battle sequence was incredible, the best I have seen in the Sean Connery era. I wonder how they did that!

Now, regarding the leading lady-in my opinion, the REAL leading lady was Luciana Paluzzi and her wonderful interpretation of villainess Fiona Volpe (Luciana did the right thing in picking that role. That role was a whole lot better than Domino's). Her character was the real star of the film in my opinion. As beautiful as Claudine Auger is, I didn't see much of her at all throughout the movie. I didn't see much character development, I really didn't see much of anything. I was rather disappointed in Auger's portrayal as a result. Too bad there wasn't a Fiona Volpe spin-off series.

705512,3,6303651488,"Thunderball may have nice locations and pretty seaside scenery but there's a shocking lack in set pieces or excitement.

The evil SPECTRE organisation nicks a warplane and lands it in the ocean. Within minutes they've spirited away the nuclear warheads and are demanding a ransom or they'll blow up a major city. Sounds like Broken Arrow huh? Well the British Government are none too happy about this so they send -007 after them. Bond has been 'relaxing' at some sort of health farm where the culprits just so happened to be doing evil deeds so he's already way ahead of the game.

Off he goes to the Bahamas (how come super-villains never have lairs in Liverpool or Coventry?) to track the missing plane down and, with any luck, get the warheads back. But not before he scuba dives about a zillion times, goes to the casino and shags loads of women. Isn't he on a time limit here?

His gadgets are not THAT fancy, the action not THAT impressive but maybe I'm guilty of double standards here. I've always thought that the latest Bond movies were guilty of being nothing but spectacle and loads of SFX. They don't feel real and are increasingly being pushed into sci-fi rather than super-spy. So if you've had enough of the xXx style Die Another Day, something Thunderball will balance it out.

But there are better Bonds than this, though it does have some nice widescreen photography (the first Bond film to be shot in Panavision) and the constant sunny seaside locations will make you want to go on holiday immediately.

The DVD is in 2.35:1 anamorphic widescreen with a not bad remastered Dolby 5.1 sound design. There are quite a few extras too.",1143676800,2,1650,4.675862068965517
705513,5,6303651488,"Far and away my favorite Bond movie of all. Many people complain that it's a slow film, but it still boasts some great action sequences (underwater fighting is inevitably going to be at a slower pace than on the ground). John Barry's score reaches its pinnacle here, especially in the underwater scenes where there's obviously no dialogue. Add on to that, one of my favorite Bond girls, the sexy Domino, and Blofeld's rogue-ish Number 2, Emilio Largo, one of the best villains (by the way, this is the first appearence, both in the film and in the book, of Bond's nemesis Blofeld).

One of the biggest factors in making Thunderball my favorite Bond movie is the beautiful locale: The Bahamas. Bond goes tropical! Can't get any better.

This is Connery's last Bond movie where he seems to still be having fun in the roll (he was obviously getting tired of it by You Only Live Twice), and the film sparkles for it. The interplay between Bond and villainess Volpe is especially entertaining.

Arguably the last true classic Bond movie in a row (You Only Live Twice is very good though, and On Her Majesty's Secret Service is vastly underrated), Thunderball feels like perhaps the ultimate Bond movie of them all. Nobody does it better.

I recommend seeking it out.",1140480000,6,1261,4.744292237442922
705514,5,6303651488,"In my opinion, Thunderball is the best James Bond film.  Others might not think so, but it is definetly one of the best.

Thunderball has everything a Bond movie should have.  Action, adventure, sophisticated humor, suspense, cool gadgets, a GREAT vilain, Baccarat, and of course, beautiful women.  This film has the most beautiful women of any Bond movie.

The setting of the movie adds to the greatnes of the film.  The movie takes place in the Bahamas, where there is plenty of sun, sand, ocean, and, obviously, BEAUTIFUL WOMEN!!  It gives off the same vibe as Dr. No in Jamaica.

The plot is good too.  SPECTRE is planning to hold the world at ransom by threatening to nuke anybody that doesn't pay up a large amount of money.  SPECTRE no. 2,AKA Emilio Largo,is the agent in charge if this operation.  The whole plot unfolds nicely and it keeps you entertained throughout the whole movie.

705587,5,6303651488,"I noted that this is the only Bond film of the entire series that, to date, has not received a single 1-star review here on Amazon.  That's pretty dang good!

Director Terrence Young had introduced us to Bond in DR. NO and FROM RUSSIA WITH LOVE.  Guy Hamilton then took us down the GOLDFINGER road, and while his attention to action made that the first SMASH Bond film, he also seemed to lose alot of the more down-to-earth flavor that made the first two Bonds so much better.

But, Terrence Young returned for his final Bond film, and somehow managed to provide the perfect mesh of the realistic Bond from the first two films, and the more action-oriented Bond of GOLDFINGER.  The result is a very happy marriage indeed - it's just too bad there were very few legitimate children born of it!

THUNDERBALL contains all the great locales, villains, and Bond coolness that we love, without getting into the ridiculous, gadget-filled territory of the later films.  It introduces us to our first true Bond femme fatale, and also gives us the first really interesting Bond girl in Claudine Auger's Domino character.

The music in the movie by John Barry is very nice, high-lighting the slower pace of much of the film.  This movie is longer than the previous three by almost 20 minutes, and it is a nice extra cushion to really build the tension.  In fact, Bond is largely absent from the first 45 minutes of the movie, and we finally see more of the villians plans - what they are and how they are being accomplished - in almost meticulous detail.  Somehow, this makes the threat more real.  Speaking of the threat, the plot being about terrorists stealing nukes and demanding ransom to prevent blowing up an undesignated city, is as fresh as today's headlines!

The only real gripe that can be levied at the film is that Connery does indeed seem a little less interested in the role than he had been.  I think he's still mostly on track here, but he's missing the total devotion that he showed in the first three films.

That aside, THUNDERBALL is simply the best Bond - offering everything that makes Bond great, and eliminating all the over-the-top sillieness that made the later films so excruciating to sit through!",1125964800,43,2216,4.660668380462725
705588,5,6303651488,I became a Bond fan when I first saw this movie played on ABC in the early 90s as a Sunday night feature.  This bond film is one of my all time favorites and Connery at his best.,1124409600,2,178,3.6842105263157894
705589,5,6303651488,"Yes, out of the whole lot of them, THIS is the one I choose as my favorite (followed very closely by MOONRAKER as second).  For starters, it has the most compelling and intruiging political plot of all of them, even more now that we live in the age of terror.  It's classic Connery with that classic 60's environment that made the first batch of films so memorable.  The underwater fighting sequence is by far the most exciting as compared to later scenes in THE SPY WHO LOVED ME and LICENSE TO KILL.

How disappointing it was to see this poorly remade in 1983 as NEVER SAY NEVER AGAIN.  But even the filmakers knew THUNDERBALL was the best story to choose from out of all the Bonds.",1122508800,5,683,4.388888888888889
705590,5,6303651488,"Long considered one of the worst Sean Connery Bond films by purists, Thunderball, remains the most lush exotic James Bond movie ever committed to film.

The evil conglomerate-- Specter, wants to hold the world hostage after they steal two high-yield nuclear bombs hidden somewhere in Nassau-- and now we're treated to one of the most insidiously entertaining films ever made.

The villains (Largo and Blofeld) are palpable, Sean Connery has never been better...The dialogue is corny yet sharp and the submariner battle finale has yet to be topped.

John Barry's score rivals that of anything John Williams has written.

George Lucas has called this film one of his favorites and I can see why.",1116547200,6,693,5.052631578947368
705591,5,6303651488,"Thunderball was released in 1965, at the height of Bond-mania from the blockbuster smash that was Goldfinger. If Goldfinger was the first film to bring all the classic Bond elements together, then Thunderball is the first time where these elements are truly refined and meshing together. It's all in the little touches, such as how Connery is now in the gun-barrel and the transition to the teaser is smoother, how the budget is now big enough to support all the epic action that Goldfinger sometimes faltered on, and how the whole film is presented in glorious panavision widescreen. It's not hard to see why this film is still a record-holder when you adjust for box-office inflation.

The plot, surprisingly, is probably my least favourite aspect of the movie. This isn't to say that it's bad, but only that a leaner screenplay could've been written. The world's in danger, yet you get no real sense of urgency from Bond, who goes about business like usual. The underwater scenes, for all their superb imagery and cinematography, are long, drawn out, and get tedious (especially when John Barry's score isn't there to boost things). I'm sure they were jaw droppers in 1965 when this kind of filming was still innovative, but today it's fairly common (though no less beautiful). Still, everything else is there. Connery puts in a great performance - he looks a little weary from all the Bond-mania, but the passion is still there, unlike his later entries. And the Bond girls are jaw-dropping beautiful - I'm usually not a sucker for the older Bond girls, but Claudine Auger definitely makes my top 5 list, and I'd have an even bigger crush on her if this film wasn't now 40 years old (though I'm sure she's still got that elegant charm).

MGM's given us a great disc to enjoy Thunderball with. I wish the picture had been restored, as it contains a little too much dirt and grain, but the audio got a good 5.1 mix, and the supplements are very extensive. Of particular interest are the two documentaries and one of the audio commentaries that plays the alternate ""Kiss Kiss Bang Bang"" song over the titles. There's a rumour that MGM will release all the Bond movies again in remastered hi-def versions to coincide with the next Bond film, and Thunderball is definitely one of the ones I'm willing to buy again. Bond Mania at its best indeed.",1109721600,8,2344,4.742647058823529

Dr Bloefeld makes his debut as the evil leader of spector.  Sadly thanks to Austin Powers the impact of Dr Evil is too much of a distraction...

 Luciana Paluzzi  as the Woman Killer to me, is the most stunning and sexy of the women in the Bond films. But one of the problems in the film is, Sean Connery. He clearly is bored and would rather be somewhere else, it really shows, also he has gained some noticeable weight. He's a far cry from the lean, mean 007 of Dr. No and From Russia With Love which were only a few years before. The villian, I can't even recall his name, is nothing, and the underwater stuff, god, it just goes on forever!!! Particularly when they are off-loading the bombs from the plane to his ship, jeez, that scene just drags on and on. It should have been a quick 'cut to' and it is done, get it over with!! Bond is not on screen for quite some time.

The Musical Score by John Barry is superb, I have the old LP and listen to it often. The music builds beautifully in the scene where Bond is being chased during that night parade, and he finally sits at a little Tiki bar, thinking he has gotten away, then,  Luciana Paluzzi ( omiously appears at his side-----then she is killed mistakely by her own people as she and Bond dance. And Bond, drops her off at a nearby young couple's table and says, ""she's just dead."" That is the best scene in the whole film to me.  And the music builds it beautifully.

 I used to think 'Thunderball' was the worst Connery Bond film, but I'd have to say I've grown to like this film a little bit more over the years, and by far the worst Connery Bond film is the dreadful 'You Only Live Twice.""",1101513600,,1653,4.212025316455696

It is as well written as any Bond film and until the end there is no major flaws in it at all.

The end of the movie though can cause a little bit of impatience due to an exsevilly long underwater battle that after a few minutes get really repetitive and a little dul. But once Bond is out of the water it picks up agian. Just watch for one mistake the movie makers had at the end of the movie. Three good guys jump out of the boat and a second later one of them disapears.

705671,5,6303651488,"Advertised as ""The Biggest Bond of All"" when released in time for Christmas 1965 (one year after ""Goldfinger""), ""Thunderball"" lived up to its tagline by dominating the box-office throughout the holiday season and into the early months of 1966, quickly claiming a position on the list of the all-time top 10 box-office champs, an impressive feat indeed at a time when the chart was still overcrowded with ""roadshow"" attractions like ""Gone With the Wind"" and ""The Ten Commandments"" that had the benefit of several reissues. When inflation is taken into account, this fourth 007 adventure remains the most successful chapter in the series. It also remains one of the best.
More than its three predecessors, ""Thunderball"" finds the 007 formula smoothly blended and firmly in place. Exotic locales, extravagent special-effects, and women, women, and more women, all beautiful and a few scantily dressed, combined with witty, mildly risque dialogue, opening credits designed by Maurice Binder that were worth the price of admission on their own, and a John Barry score that was exciting yet somehow haunting enough to make you think that this was all pretty serious stuff.
The title song, performed by Tom Jones, may sound like ""Goldfinger"" sung sideways, and the emphasis on underwater battles sometimes slow things down, but this is the definitive James Bond film with Sean Connery's best performance in the series.

What was stunning was that the underwater photography was so enthralling that, that words were not necessary.  This lack of dialog was so totally unique in an action film.  But the hit show ""sea Hunt"" was successful doing the same thing.  This plot was done again, re-written slightly in Never Say Never Again.",1055894400,,474,4.595238095238095
705674,5,6303651488,"I found this movie to be essentially perfect Bond. By Thunderball, the producers had made the Bond Formula.
One of the ingredients in this formula was the Pre-Credits Sequence. In Thunderball, it was one of the best. A perfect blend of action (the fight) and gadgets (Rocket Pack).
Then, we fly in to the first Maurice Binder titles. It complements perfectly with the music and the underwater theme. Then we are treated to 2 hours of perfection.
The plot has some great action without going way over the top and becoming cartoonish like some of the more recent bonds. It starts when SPECTRE has a plan to hijack a warplane carrying two atomic bombs and hold NATO for ransom. Bond is assigned to Nassau and quickly gets drawn into the world of SPECTRE. With the help of Domino, a beautiful girl whose brother was killed as a result of SPECTRE's misdoings, Bond gets the villain cornered on a boat... You'll have to see it to find out!
 The girls, for one, Claudine Auger as Domino Derval was perfectly cast. She had the essence of a Bond Beauty, and she was very memorable. But the best girl was Luciana Palluzzi as Fiona Volpe. This sexy and dangerous Redhead is my favourite Bond girl. I loved the scene in the hotel when Bond is captured. She was imitatated in the next Bond, You Only Live Twice, but was never matched.
One of the great Bond villains, Adolfo Celi as Emilio Largo, better known as Number Two. He was threatening and cool, a great combination.
The locales were nothing short of stunning. From Shrublands to France, from Florida to Nassau, this Bond delivers! And Sean Connery at his best. Even he says this was his best performance! And I agree. The action is perfectly balanced in this movie, allowing strong character and plot development.
This is the best Bond.",1055808000,4,1781,4.636075949367089
705675,5,6303651488,"After a rousing success the previous year with Goldfinger, the folks at Eon Productions had their work cut out for them, attempting to carry the momentum the Bond series further.  1965's Thunderball was a terrific movie to push the ante and in my opinion, it was Thunderball that cemented the Bond franchise into a ""dynasty"", so to speak.  Following from the Goldfinger formula, Thunderball was loaded with a plot of epic proportions, more gadgets, more action sequences, more engaging villains and of course, more voluptuous women.  Probably what makes Goldfinger a rank higher than Thunderball is that in all aspects of the film (gadgets, villains, women) aren't as memorable and captivating as Goldfinger.  And not to mention, the movie tends to drag on a bit more and hence, the longer duration (2 hr. 10 min. compared to Goldfinger's 1 hr. 53 min.).
The storyline is pretty straightforward.  007 is recovering at a spa resort as SPECTRE is planning a wild scheme while he's at it.  An agent of SPECTRE, Count Lippe keeps tabs on Bond and even attempts to kill him so that our hero doesn't figure out what SPECTRE is concocting.  SPECTRE is successful in gassing a test pilot, Francois Derval, otherwise nicknamed Thunderball, and replacing him with a SPECTRE agent, who is known as Angelo, a frontman who has been under the knife extensively to be Derval in every way.  Angelo takes Derval's slot in a test flight of a British bomber plane, the Vulcan, which carries two atomic bombs.  As expected, Angelo hijacks the Vulcan into Bahaman waters, where Number Two, A.K.A. Largo (Adolfo Celi) retrieves the bombs and holds the U.S. and the U.K. at ransom.  All double agents including Bond are called up on the task and when Bond reveals that he had seen Derval's corpse at the spa, he intuitively believes the bombs are elsewhere, perhaps in Nassau.  It is there where Bond encounters the lovely Domino (Claudine Auger, who in my opinion is the best-looking Bond girl in the Connery era), who turns out to be Largo's mistress and the sister of Thunderball.  With her help, Bond works from within to bring down Largo and his cronies, which leads into a climactic underwater fight off Miami between U.S. Coast Guard divers and SPECTRE.
Thunderball is a very entertaining film although there are some scenes that tend to drag (i.e. the underwater scenes) and even some of the drama is sucked out of the enormous underwater battle.  The characters are solid, but again they don't offer as much intrigue as the cast of Goldfinger did.  Largo is a suitable villain, ruthless but not as convincing as Goldfinger, although throwing people to the sharks does sound very maniacal. Largo's henchmen, Yanni and Vargas are a little way too stoic, but they serve their purpose. Fiona Volpe is a reckless, fun-loving villainess that likes to floor a 64 1/2 Mustang, in the likeness of Pussy Galore, but she's more of the one you'd love to hate.  Despite her good looks and stunning body, Domino lacked the impact that the three previous Bond girls had before her.
However, despite the minor flaws in the film, Connery establishes Bond's status of a superhero and he plays it with an arrogant swagger about himself, as if he were invincible but he maintains that aura of mystery as well.  It is his prime peformance that makes Thunderball nothing short of a non-stop action classic Bond flick and to this very day, it stands as one of the very best in the series.",1054166400,3,3451,4.804054054054054

Thunderball is good, don't get me wrong, but Dr. No is really outdated, and that movie is still considered one of the best bonds ever.

705766,4,6303651488,"The first Bond screenplay, THUNDERBALL, while still a favourite of many, is somewhat of a disappointment following the classics DR. NO and FROM RUSSIA WITH LOVE and the archetypal Bond film GOLDFINGER.  The strength of the movie lies mainly in Connery's performance of Bond, which rescues the character somewhat from the script, and in its underwater scenes which dominate the action portion of the movie.  The underwater filming was revolutionary for 1965, winning an Oscar, but is unlikely to wow modern viewers, with the exception of one scene; an excellently-choreographed pitched underwater battle.  Lacking comedy, the dramatic urgency of the film isn't maintained either, partly because the tongue-in-cheek ride of GOLDFINGER instead stumbles here as we are introduced to a series of bland villains and undeveloped minor heroic characters.  Rik Van Nutter's Felix Leiter is perhaps the most uninteresting rendition of the character ever.  He doesn't foil Bond, he simply disappears, just as Claudine Auger's Bond girl Domino Derval wanders through the film, the first of a long list of forgettable leading conquests to come.
THUNDERBALL introduces us to Bond as superhero.  He's not yet perfectly competent in every regard, but he performs a number of impossible stunts and heals inhumanly fast.  The more-realistic portrayals of the quick-witted spy of the first films is fading fast.  What isn't fading is the constant dubbing and editing problems that plague the early films, although the special effects here are the best yet.  THUNDERBALL also introduces us to a Bond that actively and obviously disrespects the women around him, at one point literally blackmailing an irrelevant-to-the-plot woman into his arms (Mollie Peters' Pat Fearing), a seduction which we are to believe she is later enthusiastic about.
The DVD menu has returned to the irritating style of interface from DR. NO, which will make you want to quickly skip through to the film or to the many special features.  Unlike the earlier ""Special Editions"", the music soundtrack is mixed surprisingly loud as compared to the dialogue tracks, which may inspire some annoying fiddling with the volume in the middle of watching the movie.
THUNDERBALL relies heavily on Sean Connery's screen presence, and sfx tricks that have aged less gracefully than he has.  That said, it's a ride that has been entertaining viewers for almost four decades now, and a fine classic Bond episode.",1044835200,,2452,5.277634961439588

The acting is excellent in this film, and the villain is more intimidating than Goldfinger. This is without a doubt Bond at his best, so don't miss it!",1041206400,2,669,4.87719298245614
705768,5,6303651488,"This movie was the next in the Bond series after Goldfinger. This movie builds upon the tradition of the previous movie, giving you more of everything. More gadgets, more action, more involved plot, an even more nefarious villain, and more women.
The plot is simple. S.P.E.C.T.R.E.s #2 man leads a rather complex scheme to steal two nuclear bombs carried by a British Vulcan bomber. All the double-Os are mobilized to find who stole the bombs and to get them back to prevent having to pay the $100 million ransom, a rather princely sum in 1965. Thanks to a fortuitous meeting with Count Lippe (Guy Doleman) at a spa, James Bond believes he may have a lead on where the bombs went. You might guess it is not Canada, where M wanted to send him.
Up until the bombs are captured by Emilio Largo (Adolfo Celi), this movie is a classic spy movie with minimal gadgets (except right at the very beginning, where Bond gets to escape from a villa with a rocket pack and then zooms off in his Aston-Martin DB-5, which is a fun car in any era with machine guns, ejection seat, and numerous other goodies no spy should be without) and lots of spy movie action. Once Largo takes the bombs, the tech gets higher as does the action.
There is lots of maneuvering in the Bahamas while looking for the bombs until an underwater fight that has to be the best hand-to-hand underwater fight ever filmed, and foreshadows the battle in space in ""Moonraker"". Of course, Largo has a getaway plan, which involves a hydrofoil, very state-of-the-art in 1965.
There are a number of other fun technical devices that appear throughout the movie, but it is more interesting to find them yourself than have me tell you about them.
The title song was sung by Tom Jones, who in 1965 was near the peak of his popularity, with a large number of hit songs and his own tv show. Tom Jones was perhaps the first well-known pop star to sing a Bond title song, but he would not be the last.
This movie is another of the best of Bond movies. James Bond gets to do some tongue-in-cheek, but again it is very natural and fitting with his super-spy image. There are really bad, bad people. So bad that you would be happy to exterminate them yourself. There are some very lovely and strong women. In fact, one of the opposition is a very strong woman who takes care of Count Lippe in a dramatic way, and then makes an escape that is just as dramatic.
This movie is classic in many ways, and enjoyable time after time. I highly recommend it as a spy film, a Bond film, and a classic 60s film. Somewhat dated, but enjoyably so, it is one of the best of a genre and an era.",1037923200,9,2621,4.40618556701031

Set in the Bahamas, THUNDERBALL is one of the most visually impressive of all the Bond films. The underwater scenes are spectacular, especially the climatic battle at the end.
The plot of the movie revolves around a NATO plane that disappears in the Atlantic. All part of a plan of the sinister SPECTRE organization, the plane was hijacked so that the aircraft's two nuclear bombs could be stolen and used to blackmail NATO governments. After discovering an important clue while on vacation at a resort, Bond is called into action and goes to the Bahamas to find the bombs and win a bathing beauty.
THUNDERBALL has all the elements of a great Bond movie: blockbuster action, awesome real life spy gadgets, several beautiful Bond babes, and a worthy villian (Largo). Not only that, but the best James Bond, Sean Connery stars.

Some fans tend to believe that this is one of the weaker Connery outings as James Bond.  In a sense it is true, the film just couldn't get any bigger than the colossol ""Goldfinger"" so in a way it is met as a slight disappointment after the 1964 007 adventure.
None the less Thunderball is one of the series most memorable with Tom Jones belting out the classic opening theme.  The movie has classic Bond villians, neat gadgets and great settings.  Emilio Largo, Fiona Volpe and Vargas are some of the best Bond villians ever!
The acting is very good in this film.  Connery plays Bond wonderfully as usual.  Adolfo Celi is notorious as the ruthless Emilio Largo.  Philip Locke plays the strong silient type with the menacing Vargas.  Lucianna Paluzzi plays the evil (but beautiful) Fiona Volpe.  Claudine Auger plays a touching role as the innocent Domino Derval.  Rik Van Nutter plays Felix Leiter and proves to be one of the best but stil Jack Lord is better.  Martine Beswick plays the small role of Paula and Bernard Lee returns as M and Lois Maxwell as Moneypenny.
Thunderball's lot is pretty formulaic.  SPECTRE highjacks some nuclear warheads and holds the world hostage for a hefty ransom.  Bond is sent to the bahamas to investigate and find the missing nuclear warheads.
In conclusion Thunderball is an underrated 007 outing.  The plot is fairly solid and the acting is very good.  The villians are classic and the sets are wonderful.  Bottom line: get this DVD!  It is classic essential Bond!  Highly recommended!",1012953600,3,1620,4.807971014492754

There are some memorable moments in this film like the opening jet pack sequence,gunfight at Largo's house during a blackout and the final underwater battle.

Yes it is definately one of the best movies in the Bond saga.  ( The thought of the remake, Never Say Never Again, ohh lets not even remember how bad it was..).
Ok, unforunately by this point the Connery had started to lose his hair and it shows, but it doesn't detract from the fact that Connery is, was and will always be James Bond.  He carries the role so effortlessly that whoever is the "" new "" James Bond, they are always measured by Connery and quite rightly so..
But, to the movie.  Connery returns again to the screen to save the world from the terrorist organisation of SPECTRE.  The opening sequence, the the rocket pack at the chateau in France and the marvelous fight sequence between Bond and the Colonel set the tone and the pace for this fantastic movie.  Tom Jones wails out the wonderful theme song amazingly well, although when Jones sings it now it's afew keys lower.
Not to spoil the plot, but once more our fantastic hero is called in once more to find two atomic weapons, stolen by SPECTRE, before they are detonated in a major city if a ransom is not paid.  The plot takes Bond to the Bahamas where he meets Domino Durval ( played by the gorgeous Claudine Anger ) and the architect of the SPECTRE scheme, Emile Largo.
The only minus point I have for the movie is that with the large amount of underwater action it is hard to mantain a high leveled action movie pace at times and it shows.  However, such small concessions considering the scale of the picture.
The DVD features are marvelous, as we are becoming use to with the MGM Releases of the James Bond movies.  Documentaries, trailers and the marvelous Dolby Digital 5.1 soundtrack!  That alone makes it worth the purchase if you have the system to appreciate it.
On the whole no movie collection should be without Thunderball.  Even if it was a stand alone movie, outside of the Bond collection, the story, action and the delivery make it worth owning at the least.

705916,5,6303651488,"This was the first Bond film I ever saw (on ABC in the late 70's) and has always been my favorite. Recently, I purchased a James BondAnniversary CD which has a radio ad promoting this film's release andbest describes my thoughts. It goes something like,""DR.NO.....BIG!.....FROM RUSSIA WITHLOVE.....BIGGER!.....GOLDFINGER....EVEN BIGGER!....AND NOW COMES THEBIGGEST BOND OF ALL!......THUNDERBALL!""

What I think is afabulous testament to ""Thunderball"" is the fact that younever really hear people say bad things about it. Sure, there arepeople who don't like it, preferring one of the other 19 (andcounting) films. But, overall, the film is liked by most and reveredby even more. Even here at Amazon there are no bad reviews or peoplesaying ""Don't buy this!"".

I won't go over the film's plotas it is covered very well elsewhere, but as many other reviewer'shave said, the action sequences, underwater filmography, music, andacting were what makes this the finest in the series. I read a storythat Adolfo Celi after being casted as Emilio Largo told his agent hehad never read one of the Fleming novel's or seen either of the firsttwo films. Celi bought a copy of ""Thunderball"" the book, atthe airport duty free store on his way to begin filming the movie andliterally (by several accounts) got off the plane foaming at the mouthto play the part.

Also of note: we hear John Barry's theme calledsimply ""007"", it is not the bass line which we normallyassociate with Bond, but it has more of a ""newsroom"" or""teletype"" sound to it. We first hear it when Bond is at theairport on his way to look for the missiles in the Caribbean. Thistheme is heard in part or whole, in all subsequent films. Finally,let's not forget it took every available ""00"" agent to trackdown Largo, as we see in the large conference hall scene to which Bondis late and M quips, ""Now that we are all here....let's getstarted.""

In closing, if I had to own one Bond film, this wouldbe it. Many people seem to feel Goldfinger is the best and I thinkeveryone is entitled to his opinion however, Thunderball thoroughlyheightened the world's interest in Bond.

705976,5,6303651488,"Thunderball is in the water, which is a metaphor about sex, and this is the sexiest of the Bond films. Its a film about becoming one with the elements and a woman, more than an action picture, per say...the film makers want you to FEEL like you are in the Bahamas going underwater, attending the Mardi Gras and making love to the series two hottest women, which it succeeds in doing. If you really were participating in an actual James Bond-type adventure there would be long hours of detective work, swimming around, driving/flying around that movies generally can't spend time depicting in real time. So in a way its an audience mood film, great for a date.
There are 3 action sequences worthy of special note; the jet pack escape, the ParaScuba infantry assault into the water and the Fulton STAR ""SkyHook"" recovery when Bond/Domino are ""snatched"" by a rescue B-17 bomber..these are real things and not make-believe devices like employed in the later remake; ""Never Say Never Again"". Read Ian Fleming's Thunderball and compare which picture captures his essence better.
At the film's end you realize that this is an end of an era, a mood that will never be likely to be seen again, and the later on Connery Bond films don't seem to quite capture the care-free, watery magic the Claudine Auger/Bond chemistry creates, though ""You only Live twice"" does create a nice Eastern reflective mood to events.

705977,5,6303651488,"Explosive action, stunning locales, a tight plot and Sean Connery's most convincing turn as the world's favorite spy make Thunderball one of the  finest-- if not the finest -- entries in the James Bond film series. Add to  that a DVD package chock full of dynamic extras such as ""behind the  scenes"" documentaries and two highly informative audio commentaries  and you've got yourself a must own movie.
The most visually stunning of  all Bond films, Thunderball's  sheer cinematic beauty comes glistening  through on the remastered DVD print. The light, tropical hues of The  Bahamas radiate like never before and the vast scope of the dazzling  underwater scenes are fully appreciated on the widescreen transfer. Having  personally viewed this Bond classic at least 200 times on standard video, I  felt as though I was seeing it for the first time via widescreen DVD.
The  plot involves Emilio Largo(Adolfo Celi) as sinister SPECTRE baddie #2 who  threatens to nuke Miami unless paid a hefty ransom by the British  government and NATO. Of course, Bond has just four days in which to save  the world -- four days filled with such distractions as an array of willing  women, killer sharks, and exploding cars and boats!
Celi is absolutely  captivating as Largo,the eye-patched criminal mastermind. Deliberate and  understated, Largo catches on to Bond, and his intent, early on. The  ensuing cat and mouse chase begins cordially before turning deadly. The  pursuit of Bond through the Junkanoo Parade in the streets of Nausau is  positively nerve-wracking. Ditto a pair of horrific scenes in Largo's  swimming pool which convieniently doubles as a deadly shark tank.
Italian  actress Luciana Paluzzi nearly steals the show as Fiona Volpe a femme  fatale killer who yearns for Bond in more than one way. Paluzzi lights up  the screen, oozing equal parts temptation and evil.
Former Miss France,  Claudine Auger turns in a fine performance as Bond's main love interest  Domino. The fact the Domino just happens to be Largo's mistress doesn't  stop our favorite super-spy from pursuing her.
Rik Van Nutter's  portrayal of CIA operative Felix Leiter is perhaps the series' finest. Of  course, Moneypenny, Q and M all flawlessly reprise their respective  roles.
A perfect blend of From Russia with Love's suspense and  Goldfinger's fun-filled explosiveness, Thunderball is undoubtedly one of  the best Bond films. MGM did a great job on the DVD, thus making  Thunderball a necessary addition to every Bond fan's collection.",966729600,12,2517,5.133333333333334

705980,5,6303651488,"""Thunderball"" is the fourth entry of the James Bond series and in terms of box office was the most successful Bond film of the 1960's. Coming fresh off the heels the very successful ""Goldfinger"",  producers Cubby Broccoli and Harry Saltzman, armed with their largest  budget to date, set out to produce a blockbuster film, filmed for the first  time in a widescreen format. The advertising blitz for Thunderball helped  produce an air of great anticipation among the moviegoing public.  Thunderball did not disappoint them.
Ironically, Thunderball was  originally intended to be the story of the first James Bond film but  problems negotiating with Keven McCrory, who owned the film rights to  Thunderball, force the producers to use ""Dr. No"" instead. It is  perhaps it was all for the best that things turned out the way they did.  With Sean Connery back again as James Bond and Terence Young returning the  director's chair after skipping ""Goldfinger"" as well as writer  Richard Maibalm, Thunderball was able to capture James Bond at his peak.  The cast of supporting character also returned with Bernard Lee as  ""M"", Lois Maxwell as Miss MoneyPenny, and Desmond Llewelyn as  ""Q"". The character of CIA agent Felix Leiter also returned though  played by yet a different actor, Rik Van Nutter.
In Thunderball, that  evil organization SPECTRE is back and this time, it is playing for the  highest stakes. Its number two agent, Emilio Largo (played by Aldolfo Celi)  plans to steal two atomic bombs from NATO and hold Britain hostage for 100  million pounds sterling. Aided by the beautiful but lethal Fiona Volpe  (played by Luciana Paluzzi), Largo succeeds in obtaining the bombs. James  Bond, following a hunch, succeeds in meeting Largo in the Bahamas through  his mistress, the lovely Domino (played by Claudine Auger). Can Bond locate  the bombs before time runs out?
The large budget for Thunderball allowed  the production team to stage and film James Bond's latest adventure in the  most lavish manner. The use of widescreen cameras made many of the scenes  filmed at Pinewood Studios, M's conference room for example, appear larger  than life. Thunderball also pioneered a number of underwater photography  techniques, which paid off when filming the underwater battle royale. In  fact, Thunderball is best seen in its widescreen format as the standard TV  format shows less than half the frame.
But just as important as the  production values were the performances and the chemistry of the cast.  Aldolfo Celi's portrayal of Largo is superb and the banter between Connery  and Luciana Paluzzi is both suspenseful and amusing. There is plenty of  action, too starting with the fight in the opening sequence, to the  underwater battle, and the hydrofoil racing out of control.
Thunderball  is considered by many Bond fans, including this one, as Sean Connery's tour  de force as the sauve secret agent. Though Connery starred in two more Bond  films for Broccoli and Saltzman, these films never seem to click with  audiences as well as this one did when it was released in 1965. If one had  to choose only one Bond film of the 1960's keep in one's film collection,  Thunderball would be an excellent choice.",964224000,4,3214,5.009469696969697

From the film's amazing underwater  photography, to Bond's cool encounter with the villain (Adolfo Celi) in a  casino, ""Thunderball"" has an epic feel unlike many films.  It's  no surprise that ""Austin Powers"" borrowed more from this movie  than any other in the Bond series.  The film is very well crafted in terms  of its glamour and suspense, and provides many memorable moments.  John  Barry's score is also one of his best.  The film's true highlight however,  is Luciana Paluzzi as the villainous Fiona Volpe.  With her exotic beauty  and sinister sexuality, she is the prototypical femme fatale, and a direct  inspiration for Famke Jannsen's character in 1995's ""GoldenEye.""  The film's only flaw is that some of the underwater sequences tend to slow  the pace at times.  But then again, this was the first movie ever to  explore underwater photography in such a way, so it scores big for its  innovativeness alone.

706047,4,6303651488,"After the phenomenal success of Goldfinger, odds were high that the next 007 mission would let most fans down.

Director Terence Young again sits in the director's chair as he had done for the first two Bond flicks.  Young's  creative prowess is harnessed by underwater director Ricou Browning who shoots some of the most compelling underwater footage ever.  This is no  small task either, as most movies shot in or around water have been  besieged by technical or logistical issues (Titanic, Waterworld, Jaws).

The opening sequence conveys that Goldfinger, has indeed, paved the way for  more outlandish gadgets and fights. The gadgets are back (watch Geiger  counter, pocket-size airtank and more); the women are back (a cute trainer  Patricia, a gorgeous assassin named Fiona and the sultry Domino) played by  Molly Peters, Luciana Paluzzi and Claudine Auger, respectively; CIA agent  Felix Leiter is back (now played by Rik Van Nutter); and back are popular Bond mainstays M, Q and Moneypenny.

Bond's one-liners are delivered in  macho Connery-style, like after spearing one of Largo's henchmen: ""I think he got the point."" Emilio Largo is a good villain, but doesn't quite elicit the type of emotion that Auric Goldfinger could; and certainly, Fiona is no Oddjob, although she's a lot better to look at.

The action is excellent (check out chapters 31-32), but I think that maybe ten minutes of the film could have been cut. Special effects supervisor John Stears won an Academy Award for his work on Thunderball in 1965, but it is definitely dated when compared to today's digitized effects.  The ending, for instance, will look too fake for younger fans spoiled by newer effects-laden productions.

There is no question that Thunderball is more produced, polished, and generally, bigger than Goldfinger.  But in this case, bigger is not necessarily better.  However, Thunderball is a worthy successor to Goldfinger and marks the last really good Bond flick that Connery appears in.

This is the first 007 movie (chronologically) to be remixed in 5.1 and it is decidedly superior to the three previously released mono offerings. The anamorphic widescreen (1.66:1 ratio) transfer doesn't seem as crisp or defined in Thunderball as it does in all previously released DVD's.  All nitpicking aside, the movie does look  pretty good and there are really no major faults that take away from the film content.

The great action scenes(especially the ones underwater), the superb performances, the well written plot, and the fantastic score by John Barry all combine to make this a five star  outing. Sean Connery turns in another fine performance as 007 and Adolfo  Celi as Largo shows how to play a truly ruthless villian without crossing  the line into camp.  This entry also features great Bond girls(both good  and bad) played by the beautiful  Claudine Auger and Luciana Paluzzi. I  recommend this fully packed DVD edition to any Bond fan.

She wins my vote as theeeeeee most attractive of the Bond girls.  Largo was  also a better than average villain.  What Thunderball lacks is an  interesting henchman for the villain like Oddjob in Goldfinger or Jaws in  The Spy Who Loved Me and Moonraker.  There aren't many interesting gadgets  either.  Otherwise the film is faithful to the Bond formula and is worth  seeing.",944870400,,516,4.895348837209302
706133,4,6303651488,"If you are a die hard Bond fan, as I've been for many years, you'll be very pleased by the DVD rendering of the original film (haven't seen this so intact or clean for many years)!  The transfer is nearly flawless, with  very rich Technicolor, very true to the original release. Spying eyes will  notice an unusually low contrast cut in the opening (post teaser) credits  by Maurice Binder, which are not so totally sillouetted. This film was  widely recieved in the US and Europe during the 60's (very much a product  of the Cold War), and I suppose not as flowing from a narrative perspective  as ""Goldfinger"" or ""From Russia With Love"", however, is  none the less important (it fueled the Bond Franchise). The DVD version has  wonderful production values as well as valuable historical info from some  of the actors and production crew. It is one of the best in my opinion...  just the right balance of action, intrigue, sensuality and political  timeliness (Nuclear hijacking, etc...). Amazingly, it still holds up after  nearly 35 years. MTV Generation, don't bother, you may be bored.",943920000,3,1090,4.827027027027027
706134,4,6303651488,"THUNDERBALL (1965) the fourth of the James Bond 007 series is among the best of the films. As a follow-up to the phenomenally successful and definitive GOLDFINGER, THUNDERBALL is just a shade less satisfying. In  terms of tone and composition the two films are of an era in the James Bond  mythology.
Sean Connery returns as the inimitable British Secret Agent,  this time set against SPECTRE Agent Number Two, Largo (Adolfo Celi).  SPECTRE has stolen an atomic bomb and is holding the world hostage.
Largo is a worthy adversary. Strongly-built, silver-haired, wearing an  eyepatch, and more physically intimidating than Gert Frobe's plump  Goldfinger, Celi's Largo lacks the faintly tongue-in-cheek air which  animated Goldfinger's behavior.  In fact, the entire film lacks the  decidedly humorous undertone of GOLDFINGER.  The villains are more vicious,  and Connery's Bond, his wit more honed than ever, is playing for keeps.
The theme song (with Tom Jones singing), plot and story are at least on  a par with the predecessor film; however, the action, based in the  Caribbean, takes place largely around, and under, water, and the film drags  deplorably during most of the underwater sequences despite the fact that  one of these is the climactic fight scene. The change in tempo between land  and undersea action is jarring and detracts from the movie in a manner that  its innate excellence in other respects cannot compensate.
Of course,  Bond successfully seduces just about every woman on the set (except for  Miss Moneypenny, the Penelope of the series).  While he is able to win an  ally in Domino (Claudine Auger), he is less successful with others, though  as he admits, after all, it is ""all for King and Country."" What a  sense of selfless sacrifice the man has!
THUNDERBALL was later remade as  NEVER SAY NEVER AGAIN in which Connery, still trim, fit, and feisty (but  with toupee) returned to the James Bond role after more than a decade's  hiatus. The remake is great to watch as a counterpoint to the original.
While THUNDERBALL is not as much fun as GOLDFINGER, if all subsequent  Bond films could have been as good as THUNDERBALL, even Timothy Dalton  would have been a tolerable 007.  Let's give this one FOUR AND A HALF  STARS.",941587200,35,2250,4.954423592493297
706135,4,6303651488,"I found the villain uninteresting and the women not that great, but some of those trusty old gadgets and great underwater sequences make up for some of the slower parts of the movie.  For sure!",940723200,,193,4.514285714285714
706136,5,6303651488,"They went all out on this movie in '65. Connery looks great. Great action. Largo-the best villain. Good dubbing. Has there ever been better underwater action ssequences before?  A big score by the one and only John Barry.  Play it loud.  Hopefully this DVD will look as good as the special edition  version laser disc. That thing has everything!  Commentary,  different themes, documentaries,etc. And it looks beautiful!  The best  photography of any Bond film.  Rated #2 on my Bond list. It's just fun!",937699200,,503,4.963855421686747
7852522,5,6303651488,"Unlike a majority of other Bond movies, my first full viewing of this was very recent. Damn. I was expecting the lack of personal nostalgia to put me to sleep, but damn. This is easily one of the top three best in the whole series and undoubtedly the best of Sean Connery.
Villain - Emilio Largo. By far the best, most competent, believable villain yet. Also the first villain to have pet sharks. Emilio's plot is to steal a couple of atomic bombs for SPECTRE, then hide and safeguard them underwater. In exchange for a sum of money, a major coastal city can be spared from nuclear annihilation. Simple and insidious! And on the plus side, he had numerous fun exchanges with Bond before the climax.
Bond Girls - Domino Derval and Fiona Volpe. Domino is pretty, innocent, and a bit fragile. For most of the movie, she's doing her own thing and I can respect that. As for Volpe...Bond has never before faced such a badass femme fatale. She wears the mark of a professional from her first scene to her last. She even makes Bond uncomfortable on several occasions. Very, very rare.
Action and Sets - At the time (1965), underwater filming was becoming quite popular--mainly due to the work of Jacques Cousteau. Here, they go all out with those resources, making the climactic battle one of the best in the whole series. Some discredit the movie for having too many scenes underwater, but hey...it's kinda the theme of the movie.
Context - Compared to the previous three, this one doesn't really do much in terms of changing up the formula. Rather, it take things a step further: opening scene is fast paced and a bit goofy, villain-focused scenes are exceptionally well done, Bond is put through a series of memorable life or death trials, and so on. Everything is simple.
Ageing - Minor spoiler, but there's a part where Bond forces himself on a woman and later convinces her to have sex with him through particularly abhorrent means. This hung over me throughout the movie--until Volpe shows up in his hotel room and, in a classic reversal, seduces and traps him. Of course, he escapes, but after suffering through Pussy Galore in the previous movie, this was much needed.",1524960000,,2170,4.683246073298429

7852531,4,6303651488,"Coming off the huge success of Goldfinger, the fourth Bond film had the unenviable task of following it a year later with high expectations.  Based upon the eighth Bond novel by Ian Fleming which was itself a novelization of a unfilmed screenplay, Thunderball  was a mixture quality action sequences and slow pacing that created just a bit of a let down from the franchises previous installment.

After killing a high ranking SPECTRE operative, James Bond is recuperating at sanitarium where he unknowingly interactions with SPECTRE agents that are beginning the organizations latest project of stealing two atomic bombs and ransoming NATO.  After the successful theft of the bombs, Bond is called to London for an emergency 00 conference and after looking at the dossier, convinces M to send him to Nassau.  Soon after his arrival, Bond meets SPECTREs Number Two Emilio Largo who masterminded the operation and arouses Bonds suspicions.  Bond joined by Felix Leiter and MI6 agents in the Bahamas begins searching for the missing NATO plane while also playing a cat-and-mouse game with Largo and various SPECTRE agents.  Upon finding the missing plane and confirming Largo has them, Bond along with U.S. Coast Guard divers battle SPECTRE off the shore of Miami to secure one bomb.  Then infiltrating Largos ship, Bond is able to stop the mans attempt to get away with the last bomb.

While Thunderball was the most financially successful Bond film until Live and Let Die, comparing it to earlier films and looking at it critically there were significant issues that affected the overall presentation.  The first and most importantly was the pacing at the beginning of the film, especially when Bond was in the sanitarium.  The slow beginning could have been tightened in numerous ways while not losing important plot developments.  The second were the numerous underwater sequences, save the battle off Miami, which simply took too much time each without equal story development.  Connerys performances was once again top notch, Adolfo Celis Emilio Largo was an impressive villain, and Luciana Paluzzis femme fatale Fiona Volpe were stand out performances throughout the film.  But the highlight and most memorable part of the film was the climatic underwater battle, which was skillfully choreographed.

Thunderball, while not close to mediocre, doesnt not compare to its predecessor.  While unfortunately dragged down by a slow beginning, the great acting and a fantastic climactic battle makes this a solidly good film.",1513468800,,2522,5.236318407960199
