5455463,5,B00AMSNEGM,"These are both excellent movies. I highly recommend buying these double features. "" Troy"" is outstanding. An extremely well made movie that I watch over and over again. Brad Pitt is excellent. I have even gone to visit where Ancient Troy was in Turkey. I was thrilled to see the TROJAN HORSE. It was a copy of the original that you could walk up into.

5455467,5,B00AMSNEGM,"I had never seen either of these movies. Troy seemed a bit sophmoric and silly at times and I never forgot I was watching actors. I only watched it once. It should never have been placed with Gladiator which, to me, is a very good movie. Russel Crowe brought Maximus to life; an amazing character who will break your heart. All the actors were great in the movie. The story is flawed, and does not stuck to historical fact, but if you relax and enjoy it as it is, you will be highly entertained.",1505520000,,495,4.276595744680851

5455566,5,B00AMSNEGM,"I'm definitely very biased on this one.  These are my two favorite movies, so to find them both in such a cheap bundle is awesome.  Gladiator is  one of the great all time classic movies.  Russell Crow's acting in this film is by far his best.  He puts in a ton of passion and the result brings the film to life.
If you are wondering whats special about the sapphire addition, its the blurays equivalent of the diamond edition since, you know, the disk is blue and sapphires are blue... Lame but true. haha.
Troy is also a great ancient war time movie.  It features the Greek hero's Achilles, Ajax, Menelaus, Hector, Agamemnon, and Odysseus.  The acting is all around great and it brings the great epic of the battle of Troy to life brilliantly.",1444176000,4,745,4.474074074074074

I used to watch all of the '50's and '60's gladiator movies.  This one was a bit different from what I remembered.  But, now, it is up there with the other gladiator movies.  Troy was done well.  It is also worth watching and owning.  Most of the movie is somewhat history accurate except maybe the actual people interaction.  But, it is good movie entertainment.",1424649600,,534,4.3232323232323235

I played both the movies and the picture and sound quality are excellent-exactly what you'd expect from a blu-ray.

5455766,5,B00AMSNEGM,"I loved Gladiator, and so the extended version on Blu-ray is greater than the Director's cut. I loved Brad Pitt as Achilles - he was magnificent in the role. This was a great buy; 2 for the price of 1.",1392595200,,201,4.05
5455767,5,B00AMSNEGM,"This was one of the better BluRay purchases I have made. If you like Russell Crowe and Brad Pitt, and don't already have these films in your collection, this BluRay is definitely worth the purchase price. The video and audio are clean, high quality transfers, which you would expect since these are both relatively new films. WARNING: Both films employ extremely graphic violence and gore in the combat scenes, which are definitely not appropriate for kids, and some nudity (in Troy). I would call this a ""hard"" R rating, although considering the violence of a lot of the video games out there that pre-teen kids are playing, maybe it's a lost cause to try and protect them against extreme violence in movies.

SPOILER WARNING: Skip the next paragraph if you don't want any clues at all about the films.

Personally, I liked Gladiator best of the two films. Russel Crowe and the supporting cast give stellar performances, and even the ""villain"" in this film, Emperor Commodus, can be seen with some sympathy as a spoiled brat who never grew up, and by way of the patricide he committed, found himself way over his head in a job that he was incompetent to perform.  Troy is also a very good (if loosely based) film adaptation of Homer's Iliad. King Agammemnon of Mycenae is the ""villain"" in this film, and the actor did a great job of portraying him as a megalomaniac. Priam and his older son Hector are the ""good guys"", but that leaves Achillies, played by Brad Pitt, in a grey area somewhere in the middle - probably intentionally - and his overall attitude is so depressing and negative through most of the film that it's hard to ""like"" him at all, at least until the last half hour of the film. Okay, no more spoilers.

SUMMARY: A double feature film, with excellent storytelling by the cast and director. Both films are extremely violent in the combat scenes, with (in my opinion) too much explicit blood and graphic swordplay.  The story could have been told just as well with the gore toned down somewhat. RECOMMENDED for adults only, these movies are rated ""R"" and they mean it.",1391558400,3,2085,4.670299727520436
