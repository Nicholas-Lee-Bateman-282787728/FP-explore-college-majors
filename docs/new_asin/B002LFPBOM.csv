3945943,4,B002LFPBOM,"After reading a great deal of positive reviews for this film, I added it my Blockbuster queue as soon as it had a release date. I had high hopes for the film, and it lived up to them. The special effects were cool, the action was good, the story was intriguing, and the soundtrack was very fitting. It's a good flick. Check it out.",1258070400,3,331,4.1875
3945944,1,B002LFPBOM,"I read these amazing reviews and rented this movie so I felt compelled to write a counterpoint despite not having finished watching the film (I do not intend to either).  This film is not...good.  The director is ambitious and has some interesting ideas however he does not have any budget, actors or a decent script.  Some of the character ideas and sets were pretty cool however they are drowned out by the wretched acting and ham-fisted dialog.  I'm not sure what the plot was because 10 minutes into the film I didn't care what the plot was, every-time one of the cardboard cutout characters spoke it hurt my brain, I lasted 25 mins then I shut it off. This is the kinda fair that a devoted Sy-fy channel watcher might suffer through but the less enthusiastic should avoid this film at all costs.",1257984000,15,800,4.573426573426573
3945945,5,B002LFPBOM,"I saw Ink at a film festival in Annapolis, MD. I was unprepared for both the power and the originality of this independent film.  It is the story of a young girl who lives in a dark dangerous world where different forces having fantastic powers try to influence dreams for good or for evil. The girl is being raised by dysfunctional parents and is put into danger by a creature nicknamed, ""Ink"". The effects are fantastic for a film made without the benefit of traditional industry funding. The suspense and fully realized characters are the equal of any ""Hollywood"" film and it was the best film I have seen in years.

Ink is filled with unique, original characters and you will fall in love with the character of the little girl.  I literally could not take my eyes off the screen due to the fact that I really cared about what was going to happen to these people. This is a film I guarantee you will never forget. Don't miss it!

I hope the success of Ink propels Jamin and Kiowa Winans to make many more remarkable films.",1257724800,151,1025,4.4361702127659575
3945946,1,B002LFPBOM,"This is a rewrite of my original review. I received several angry responses from people who were upset that I attacked the fact that there were so many shills writing in to boost the sales/rentals of the film as opposed to addressing the film itself. They were correct, so here it goes.

This movie simply is not that good. Not on any level. the acting is lousy accept for the little girl and the ""story teller."" the whole thing needed to be shot on film as opposed to video. Whatever moods were trying to be created just did not come across. The wardrobe stunk, and I do not know where all the ""powerful images"" were that some of the reviewers spoke of. There was nothing powerful in anything I saw. The characters with the screens over their faces along with the glowing eye beings were supposed to evoke (I guess) some nightmarish, horror image, but I found it only strange for strange sake.

The story was written in strokes that were way too broad. It needed much more detail everywhere. Take the ""good guys."" You have this band of people who first fail to protect the little girl, then have to go and rescue her. Who are they? They have no names and we don't get to know them, so when they get into their various scrapes, there's no emotional dimension to involve the audience. Then there's the pathfinder. There was some attempt to create a character here but nowhere near enough was done to flesh him out. The tape over his eyes was merely strange and didn't add anything to his character. He was, though, in the one and only good scene in the entire movie where he orchestrates a cause and effect ballet which puts ""Ink"" in the hospital.

The music score was OK with one piece that stuck out as being better than the rest but I'm grasping at straws here. The editing was uneven at best and poor in most parts. If you put this up against the film ""Franklyn"", which is not that dissimilar, you would find Franklyn excels at every level. Maybe putting an ""ST"" in front of this title would have suited it better.",1257638400,24,2017,4.431266846361186

3945948,5,B002LFPBOM,"I read in Joblo that this was ""absolutely one of the best movies of 2009"" and I am always on the lookout for good fantasy so I had to see it.  Th trailers were great and the reviews were great, but none of them capture how good this movie is.  I watched it hoping for a good scifi flick, and ended up with tears in my eyes.  It's brilliantly edited, visually incomparable, and well acted.  It's the kind of movie you will watch multiple times and continue to uncover new elements of the story.  Yet it's still amazing on the first viewing.  Get this movie and be prepared to be confused AND entertained!  Hahah.  DEFINITELY, one of the best moves of 2009.

It's an impressively good film from every angle: the story is very unique but wonderfully thought out and construed, the acting does not have any weak points ""He was sooo yooouuung!!"" lol, the costuming and sets were beautiful, the music was quintessentially important to get the feel of the film down and they nailed it completely and profoundly.  I really could go on.  This is everything good that can come from a small artistic film, which the greater entity of Hollywood will always have lacking.  It is not a canned rerererereremade idea or film, it is a piece of art, masterfully crafted by many artists working in beautiful synchrony.

This movie is amazing from start to finish. Have to watch it 2-3 times to get (not everything) everything out of it. This is not a one dimensional movie. The first time I watched it I was holding my infant son who had fallen asleep breastfeeding. Such a powerful scene at the end I was just holding him and crying.

I absolutely loved the way the plot delved deeply into the concept of fate all while showing the battle of good versus evil that wages on right in the midst of the choices people make.

I have watched it more times than I can count and EVERY single time I watch it I find my self balling my eyes out from a strong combination of emotions that this movie stimulates within me. As most say, the movie starts out slow, seemingly pointless, and tacky. I feel it was a mix of budget limits and trying to get all the characters introduced.

In any event, this is an unusual movie, the sound effects with a good headphones are startling,  Costumes and visuals are original thinking, lighting is almost a character of its own, sound already mentioned, directing is either non-existent or extraordinary -the characters completely carry their parts- and the editing stitched disparate scenes into a kind of Frankenfilm sutured with noise, flashes of light and disorientation.

This film is a complete waste of time. Art itself is a completely foreign concept to the writers and directors of this film. The acting was horribly lame and stilted, forced, and I strongly suspected that the casting director used the roster of producers to select roles.

There was one single [obvious] exception, the little girl kidnapped by the bogeyman kitted out like a sniper sans rifle: She was a good pretender, while her ""colleagues"" STANK.",1487548800,,813,5.067164179104478

The best analogy I can give this film is if ""Pan's Labyrinth"" reverberated with you then you will like this film. Keep in mind that this film used no big budget Hollywood tricks. Most of the effects are pulled off using lighting, exposure, and photographic after effects but it works. Mr. Winans, the director, uses some absolutely stunning edits. The movie and it's mood just flows. One reviewer said this is not a film to watch out of the corner of your eye with interruptions. I couldn't agree more. This is a late night film with the lights off so you can just let it wash over you and understand who the characters are and what they do. Myself, I was immersed in the first ten minutes. I won't spoil it but it is such a pleasant feeling when the seemingly disparate parts of the movie all of a sudden jumble into place. By the way, the music was great at setting the mood as well.

Ink is a graduation level from that realm.  Everything important- heart- decision- rough moments- loss- has been taken to a new place where CHOICE becomes applicable.
I've never seen anyone explain the outer workings of reality quite as well or as beautifully as the Winans do with this film.  And if you love this one as much as you SHOULD, check out ""The Frame"", their next film- gets even more alchemically personal with two wonderful might-be lovers chasing each other down through different realities.
Few are bold enough to explore what they do, and to my last breath I will try and tell everyone who talks of the moments or dynamics inherent in their films completely UP.  Worthy of more than that, in the long run this couple made films worthy of our attempts to LIVE OUT THESE IDEAS, concepts, and ideals.

It's a touch predictable, but it's hardly a major flaw and what they managed to do with their FX, Set, Costume & Prop Design on a limited budget is very impressive. It's also got surprisingly good fight choreography. And, for anyone concerned about it, the action while intense, is mostly cartoony/comic bookish (and not Netflix comic bookish which can actually be very violent) so I'd say it's family friendly too.

On the other hand, it feels like there's an over reliance on gimmicks like the slightly out of focus/hazy filming. But my biggest gripe is that frankly I find the dialogue weakly written.

3946191,4,B002LFPBOM,"Honest review: A wonderful idea, a good story and poignant fairy-tale regarding the dangers of giving in to weakness and the evils of neglect and shame.  Plays on old archetypes of angels and demonic influences and how that impacts the lives of those around us.  In short, I was enraptured by the tale and wound up very moved by it.

The film overall, however, is produced at a somewhat amateur level. I think the filtering is meant to create an illusion of another world (and maybe that's why it's marketed like Sin City), but the noir effect is overused. A better choice would have been to use it transitionally I think.

Some of the cinematography is executed brilliantly and sometimes too experimentally, whereas it seems done for its sake alone and not to further the story.  But when it's shot right, it's powerful.  I would have like to have seen more color introduced, especially symbolically. For example, the weapons used, the recorder and other devices. Ah well.

Soundtrack is very good unlike most amateur productions and kept me involved even at slower points. With that said, make no mistake - some of these poor reviews (particularly about this film being slow), are from heathens who probably prefer a brainless action flick compared to what this truly is; a modern, epic fairy tale with a cerebrally emotional and artistic flair.  If that's the kind of film you like, you will look past the flaws and find, as I did, a very moving tale.",1474588800,6,1454,4.742063492063492

I have watched thousands of movies this movie was slow and boring there obviously were no good special effects the acting and script are poor at best I made it may be 20 minutes through and realize there was no way that this movie would be worth watching I don't understand how anyone could rate this at 5 stars I think a Power Rangers movie which are horrible in my opinion would rate higher.

But what I don't get is why? Just to dupe people like myself into watching only as much of it as we can stand before shutting it off, ruining our evening when we could have gone on to something better? Well, here is yet another one star review in an attempt to correct the lie and injustice that is this films rating. No doubt this truth will be offset by 5 or 10 more lies. May be if the people who made this film, and spent so much time defending it with faulty reviews, spent time actually learning how to make a decent movie, my evening wouldn't be wasted.

It shows such a beautiful message. Also the way the presence of the angels or demons is announced is very accurate. With a little bit of perception, in life as well as in this film, you can tell right away who is who. The angels come in a flash of light and the legion of Evil comes in an overlapping, distorted vibration. But never be deceived if a demon tries to disguise itself as an angel, Lucifer was once the most powerful archangel.",1472342400,,616,4.228813559322034

3946249,5,B002LFPBOM,"Ink is one of the best low-budget movies I've seen in some time. But you really have to hang in with it to the very end to really appreciate it. For me, the reasons are two: first, the main character is presented right up front as a despicable person. He seems to have no redeeming qualities. I was so turned off by him that I almost stopped watching the movie. Then, two, there is the Storyteller character, Liev, who seems to come out of nowhere early in the movie. I have seen low-budget movies bring in characters like this, then the character seems to not have much to do after awhile. Not in this movie.

For a low-budget movie, the story, writing, acting, cinematography, and special effects,were first-rate. I thought Jessica Duffy as Liev, the Storyteller, was especially good. But I repeat--you have to hang in to the very end to appreciate this excellent movie.",1470182400,,872,4.625806451612903

There is the fight between good and evil (of course). There are also a few different levels of reality that come together. It raised several interesting questions on the nature of beings external to our reality (See Walter Wink's work on Powers). That being said. It is not a religious movie in any way. There is also no gratuitous sex or gore; however, there is some unnecessary offensive language which may limit the audience. It could have easily been made without these terms.

3946334,5,B002LFPBOM,"Im SO glad I didn't listen to the naysayers on here giving this movie poor reviews!  What a fantastic little independent!  I can also tell by some of the positive reviewers that even they didn't quite get what the movie was about.  I love the whole premise of almost dying or going into a coma and fighting forces of good and evil.  It reminds me of a Dean Koontz book I recently read.  As other reviewers said, the fight scenes were awesome, not violent, the supernaturals looked awesome and that idea that people exist in an alternate universe protecting us from evil gets me every time. This movie has been in my movies list forever and I always chose to watch something else.  People readily criticize what they don't or cant understand.  Movies with substinance that require thinking and intelligence.  Reminds me of Labrynth.  Either you liked it or hated it.  Well I loved this fantastic little find on Amazon prime.  And for those reviewers that think that because a movie has so many positive reviews its a conspiracy......get a life and maybe go learn something.  This movie has rave reviews outside of Amazon so give it a shot.  Oh, and to clear up what this movie is actually about......from IMDB ""A mysterious creature, known as Ink, steals a child's soul in hopes of using it as a bargaining chip to join the Incubi - the group of supernatural beings responsible for creating nightmares.""",1467331200,,1402,4.69672131147541

3946341,3,B002LFPBOM,"This film, geeze. Ugh. I gave it three stars because the fight scenes were very well choreographed and the story was really great, but maaaan is it a slow mover. The director of this film (Jamin Winans) also directed a film called ""Frame"". In both films I found myself scrolling to the end of the timeline thinking, ""For heavens sake, how long is this going to take?"" It's not that the premise of the film is bad, or the story is lacking or the acting is unendurable - the direction is just SLOW! I'm talking about ten or fifteen minutes worth of walking around, camera focused on the feet and face of the actors or the set, or all three. This film could have a good 30 minutes cut from it and you would still come away with the idea of exactly what the film is about. The viewer finds themselves mumbling, ""Alright already, we get it, move on! For the love of film, move on!"" Yes, it is that slow.
It's a pretty good film, the story is great, the actors are pretty good, and a lot of thought went into making this. I really hope the director gets over this hump of super slow-ness, maybe it will be the trademark of this particular director, I hope not because the originality of the two films I have seen directed are really noteworthy.",1466899200,4,1238,4.317596566523605

But it also gets extremely slow and repetitive somewhere in the middle, enough so that I tuned out and didn't bother watching the ending - both times. Yes, I've seen it twice now and still have no idea how it ends.

If I were trapped in a theater, it probably would have held my interest. But streaming at home, not a chance. The fact that I still gave it four stars says a lot about its originality. I do hope that the Winans get better at pacing and building to a climax in their future endeavors because I would love to see more of what their imaginations dream up.",1466726400,,670,4.1937984496124034

This is my fav movie now cause of the story every actor dose their part well even the little girl on the right on the cover.

I couldn't help but think what this movie would of be heralded as if the budget had been of the obscene Hollywood variety. You need to make sense of where it is going before you get drawn into what is going on. If you don't, and turn out to early, you'll be missing a great piece of ambitious storytelling.  Don't expect it to be flawless in presentation because the budget is very small. The dialogue, especially later in the movie, will draw you in as the exchanges start to attach some emotional significance to what is transpiring on the screen. By the end, this piece of fantasy film making delivers a very human message about saving one's self from the brink of self-destruction.

3946508,5,B002LFPBOM,"Instantly, one of my favorite movies.  I just watched it on Amazon Prime and will now plan on owning it.  This movie is not for everyone though.  If you've had a fairly easy life overall, and are a hard critic on movies, you might not get the full effect of it, and might not enjoy it.  However, if you're someone who has been through either some hard times in life (things such as the loss of loved ones, broken family, poverty), and/or struggled deeply with your own self worth/inner demons, you'll probably find things in this movie you can relate to on multiple levels.  Or if you're someone who can simply appreciate a unique story presented in an artful fashion, you'll probably like it too.

It was a low budget film, but with the amount of effort and story line they put into it, you quickly forget (also has stirring orchestrated music as its soundtrack to grab you even more).  And just to emphasize, even though it was low budget, if you've seen other low budget films, when watching this one you will see how much work they really put into making it, and it made me appreciate it even more afterwards.  I have to say afterwards because the story and music were so gripping, for me, I forgot it was low budget until after it was done while reading the credits.  If you decide to watch it, give it at least the full first half hour, and then you'll know if you want to continue or not.

I now want to see the others movies this crew has made; if any.  Very well done.  I could easily watch this movie a few times a year, every year.",1461888000,,1542,4.315972222222222

Apparently, there is a great deal of kung Fu fighting and professional wrestler moves that the angels and dark forces wield against one another to either prevent or allow us to make decisions. I enjoyed the surreal nature of the story, but thought that it was somewhat overdone. I wanted to say, ""I get it already, move on!"" All in all, just ""ok"", but I think it could have been much better with a more clever presentation of the struggles between good and evil than over choreographed fight scenes.

In life, it's very easy to lose track of what is important. I think Johns statement that his co-workers and subordinates where his family now really hit home for me.  Who are you? Who do you want to be? Realize what choices you are making in life and who you are becoming.

I would recommend this flick to anyone over 16 with an open-mind for fiction.  The plot is fairly deep, revealed in suspenseful mixed chapters, and doesn't disappoint at the end.  The only negative comment I would make is regarding the use of the ""F-"" bomb.  It starts the film off in an acceptably abrupt manner, but seems a little over-used through the rest of the movie.  ""Ink"" is still a five-star action-adventure, brain-twister, tear-jerker tale for mentally mature audiences.",1458432000,,815,4.992592592592593

It was good enough that I would have been proud of it if it had been my work, but lacking the polish and consistency that one expects from professional filmmakers.

It was hard to maintain the ""willing suspension of disbelief"" needed for amount of fantasy and allegory. There was substance here well beyond some of the drivel that passes for fantasy on the small screen and I kept wishing for higher production values, to support the ideas being presented. This would have been a phenomenal effort, if it was simply better supported by the technology and special effects resources of an  AMC, SyFy or FXX.

3946938,5,B002LFPBOM,"I normally shy away from dark films with disturbing images - but I thought I'd give this one a try - in part because of the high ratings, in part because of the father/daughter relationship.

Yes - this movie was dark and disturbing at times, as well as beautiful and sad and encouraging. It exemplifies how someone can believe the lie of the world's metric of success, only to realize they are working for the enemy who told them that lie.

With elements of the angelic and demonic, the afterlife, evil vs good, lie vs truth, this movie convicts the viewer about where they place their priorities in life - as humans we can so easily get caught up in our selfishness.  Often, it takes a crisis to help us realize what is truly important: love, true beauty, truth, family, healthy relationships.

As a follower of Jesus Christ, this story was a good reminder that there is a spiritual realm we cannot see, and there are angels and demons warring against one another.  The enemy is Satan, the father of lies - and his demons- who will try to deceive us with promises of success, (false) beauty, pride.

I hope that you take the time to watch this movie, disturbing at times, but eye-opening and moving.  Allow the story to help you reflect on your own life, and the choices you make.  Jesus is God, He loves you, and He wants you repent like the main character in this story, and choose Him - choose life and love.",1455494400,,1413,4.449612403100775

The production values are not at a top end budget but the coloration and use of simple symbols make it more of an art statement than a scify movie. I liked the fact that not everything was laid out in a simple chronological order and the random pieces of life made it a greater movie.,1454198400,,429,4.0588235294117645

The story could be told much faster, and the plot could unfold in a much simpler way, but if you decide to spend time with this film, realize the joy is in the journey the film wonders through.

However people are linked to others some of whom are important and loved in our lives.  Those relationships come at a cost. Our emotional downfall can harm ourselves and through those human ties our friends and love ones.  Although we sometimes feel can have the freedom to do whatever we want in our lives, that is an illusion when you are in relationships as the ripples of our lives are felt in those relationship with others.  What better way to show facilitate a way to convey this knowledge then through the medium of dreams.  Where worlds can be constructed to act out these psychic forces in our lives with the freedom that can't be illustrated in the real time world. The stage and props in the dream world are built from our fears, hopes, dreams, and interpretations of our lives and all the people in the dream are built from us. This was a humanistics story about love lost and love regained through redemption through an act of reclaiming of the self.  In particular those parts that we find alienating, the shadow parts that must be accepted and brought into who we are so that we are whole. I think this movie does this concept well. It is well acted, scripted well, complex enough to tell the story without being overdone. In some ways if you realize that its is done like a Grimm's Fairy Tale for adults with child like fantasies.

too bad the story telling does not anchor in/explore/amplify/modify any themes or mythology that I know of / can decipher other than _family is tight_
Film maker is saying: I am going to write everything, create a whole new banal mythology, and you are not going to be given a single clue (other than ominous music.  great.)

and.  I am going to do it all in _dream universe_ so you know, all the whole movie, that absolutely nothing I say should be taken seriously.

This movie has elements of the following film genres. Science fiction, fantasy, mystery, action and suspense. Note: I'm sure I've missed several or many of the other genres that it could belong to as well. The fashion in how they meshed these disparate elements into one coherent movie is masterful in my opinion.

I mentioned at the start of this review that the movie was ""intellectually and emotionally perplexing."" You will probably be confused for a fair amount of time. I'm guessing I was almost 3/4's of the way through the movie before things started making sense. Your mileage may vary, but I think it will be close to mine. So, confusion is normal for this film and the best advice is to go with the flow. The emotional confusion is due to the fact that there are parts in the move where you feel like crying. There are parts in the movie that make you feel rage. There are parts that make you feel almost exalted. And then they make you feel foreboding. All in the space of 5 minutes or so.

I can't think of a movie I've watched in the past that has had anything near the impact this one has. It really is THAT good!!!

That's like watching The Usual Suspects half way and saying the main villain sucks because he gets no screen time. Lot's if not most good films need to be watched all the way through to be understood.

As to the movie itself. This was a really great movie and especially for its budget. I gave it 5 stars because I think its better to go high than low since I am recommending this but my true score would be more like 4.5 stars. I have to take a half star off because if not for the extreme language at at times  (lots of F bombs) this could be a movie to be seen by a much wider audience. While I wouldn't call this a family film it is a fantasy movie that has all the elements to be appreciated by a very wide age group. That being said for those who do get to watch this it's awesome. The description says 'It's a Wonderful Life meets Sin City"" I think it's more like What Dreams May Come meets The Matrix. I could only imagine this being produced by the The Wachowskis instead of the Winans. I'd keep the director but with that budget and name behind this (for more advanced effects) Ink could have easily been the next big blockbuster.. though I'm sure some fans will hate that comment but even without a multi-million dollar effects budget Ink pulls off feelings and wonder that many blockbusters lack.",1451260800,2,1448,4.261818181818182

The imdb rating was unusually high for a movie without an immediately recognizable name attached. In other words I had no real understanding of the movie prior to watching it.

The movie starts slow, the characters speak in stilted phrases, the little girl and her father have an ambiguous exchange, and the images appear to have been treated to instagram filters...then an action scene with terrible shaky camera work. At this point I usually stop the video to save my sanity. The dialogue was on the cusp of negligible and poorly acted. BUT somehow  every scene had a glimmer of something worth watching.

That ""something worth watching "" got me more than 2/3 of the movie, and at this point I was rewarded with a well thought out revelation. All of these stilted characters and phrases were needed to get to this one point in the movie. At this point I realized how well orchestrated this movie really was.

Also, after watching the credits roll I think most of local Denver, CO filmmaking community was involved or thanked in this movie. There were dozens of locations and setups -- for an indie this was very impressive.",1451001600,7,1166,4.729064039408867

It's hard to find a story, layered with powerful yet simple visuals, that's as imaginative and powerful as Ink. A few scenes have familiar elements from other films, but the Winans have masterfully adapted those ideas and enhanced them, almost executing their depiction more truthfully than that from which they, perhaps, borrowed.

But I had to break my ""Hollywood"" movie expectations and just let my mind make of what it would.
It really tugged on my emotions (I am a dad and I juggle with these same issues in my head). Any movie that can tug on my emotions the way this movie did, well... it is the reason I watch movies... I want to think and feel (while not being spoon fed on the reasons).
Simply put... if you can put those reasons aside that I got hung up on initially and you watch movies for the same reason I state, you will LOVE this movie. It is probably in my top 5.
As I wrote to a youtuber who asked about the shoddy budget, etc. after they watched the trailer... sometimes a great dish comes out of a kitchen that appears unkempt.",1449878400,,1330,4.06083650190114

The story started a bit slow for me.  I recognized the building of several stories and had no trouble letting them run; no trouble keeping track of them, even before I knew what they meant...  Eventually there was a section of the film where the foley and audio was interesting enough to grab my attention.  From this point on, it was clear that the stories were to converge...  ...and pretty much, until just before the reveal, I hadn't quite guessed how the plots would converge...

In the end, how the film used the video effects to indicate how the story was being told, used the audio effects to build tension early in the film to stress key moments, hid the reveal, and had an amazingly sweet story buried in some thought provoking possibilities for interpreting the world...  ...all surprised me and completely drawn into the film. (after maybe 20 or 30 minutes of patience at first...).  As I am not a film buff, i cannot speak much to the acting.  For most characters, I really enjoyed their portrayal.

Great acting, good camera work, especially for a low budget movie. This is definitely a work of art, and when you've finished you will be left to reflect on your own life and values.

I only write this review to balance the reviews out some.  If you are educated, an avid movie watcher, and have fairy well read, then I don't think you will be in awe as some of the other reviewers.

Having said that, it is an interesting take on good and evil and the fight for one's soul.  The ending does have a nice twist between the storyteller and Ink.  Like the Matrix, there are philosophies and implied religious overtones without usinng historical or biblical references and it is left to the viewer to make certain connections on their own.  The story revolves around a short time period or snapshot of the life of the stories main characters with flashbacks and foreshadowing to expand the story through the storyteller and the main characters memories.

I probably will not watch this again.  Once is enough and that ought to tell you what you need to know about it's value as an entertaining movie.  It is worth watching free on the Prime membership.  I'm glaad I did not have to pay extra to view it.

It's okay and a little inspirational, but not a movie that sends you into your head thinking about your life and the choices you make for more than an hour after watching it.  It is not scary and not very suspenseful.  I would put it between okay and good.",1448236800,2,1529,4.372340425531915

3947592,2,B002LFPBOM,"Item arrived fine and on time. However, I don't think it's worth getting this item on blue ray. Everything in the movie is meant to be blurry to make up for the low budget special effects and to create a dream like effect. (Think Sin City, but filmed with a very nice home camera.)  It's still grainy in many scenes, and I don't think you want to be able to see the finer details of some of the costume make up anyway (there were times I thought one of the actor's fake noses might fall off, and it was very distracting to the story line).  The movie style is definitely different from your main stream stuff.  I love indie films, but I honestly think all the 5 star review are from very artsy type of people or those interested in making films.

The tone of the movie is dark with a fantasy feel. I was hoping for something along the lines of The Labyrinth or a Tim Burton movie, but this was not it. This movie almost reminded me of live action anime/manga. Costumes were along the lines of what you'd see an average person whip up for a cosplay convention or wear to hang out at Hot Topic in the mall.  Dialogue was even limited at times. There were a lot of fight scenes, which I feel were too unbelievable and actually detracted from the movie's quality. Punches and tosses were way too choreographed and very unconvincing.  The minor bits of blood, cuts, and bruises were unrealistic and strategically placed on the actors faces to maintain their good looks. No swelling, no trickled blood, no ruined make up, no messy hair.  Just a few strategically placed cuts and a lot of skinny, overaccesorized people posing in cool fighting stances.  I just felt the fight scenes were excessive for the story and we're poorly performed in many ways.  It was like the focus was pulled away from the story line for the moment to amp up how bad-ass these actors were supposed to be.

Overall, I would only recommend this movie to someone who is really into dark, fighting style anime and who is curious to see what it would look like in live action. I could instantly tell this movie was shot with a VERY low budget, and I was really disappointed in the quality of the blueray, which prompted me to Google the movie to figure out why it had such great reviews. I spent more effort reading about the director and producer's (husband and wife duo) disbelief that no one in Hollywood would pick up on this movie or show it in theaters and their efforts to self-promote and sell it than I did watching it. Honestly, it's a great movie considering what little money this couple had to work with it.  But I'm not into the film industry or fighting big Hollywood. I just wanted entertainment. The underlying message of the movie was beautiful. The main characters (dad and daughter) were good actors.  But this movie was just not that impressive to me, and I think the trailer led me to believe it was going to be something with more substance and quality.  I would hesitate before buying this one. Maybe get a used version of the regular dvd if you can't fight back your curiosity. That way you won't be as disappointed as me that you dished out extra money for a brand new blueray edition you'll never watch again.",1447200000,3,3202,4.452991452991453

3947603,5,B002LFPBOM,"I can honestly say that this is one of, if not *the*, best pieces of cinematography that I have ever seen.

I believe that not one of the writers, directors, editors and actors were below the level of genius and I say that with no exaggeration whatsoever.  The editing gave a sense of the surreal and macabre that still seemed utterly believable.  Each and every actor conveyed their part as if they *were* their part.

The story lines were intricately woven and yet easily discerned.

The script was delivered with the newer and fashionable stuttered scene approach that succeeded where others have failed, not making one feel distracted or disoriented but instead feeling as if it were utterly correct for the story that was told.  Despite being so surreal the story, acting, editing and progress made complete sense.

Normally the technique of stutter jumping from present to past and point of view to point of view is veryincredibly distracting but here the director and editor made it so incredibly smooth that it seemed perfectly natural.

The protagonists and antagonists were astonishingly well portrayed with the battle between good and evil, hope and despair presented with astonishing clarity due to the editing.

The concept that hope triumphs over despair and good over evil is a welcome sign that all has not been lost to the typical dark screen writing that pervades so much of our cinematic content these days.

Yes, this movie moved me to make one of the more in depth reviews I have ever written. Despite its very dark presentation, this is a movie of an amazing journey of discovery and self sacrifice.

3947634,5,B002LFPBOM,"Everyone's entitled to their own opinion, therefore I disregard the negative reviews. Some people need a more linear, step-by-step story line, some people don't get a deeper story, or one that calls forth the emotions. Some need more ""pizzazz"" and CGI and fires and explosions to hold their interest. This is not ""Ink"". As for the person who said the positive reviews must be fake, consider the source.

I've seen this move a dozen times and it never fails to grab my interest. I associate with a few independent filmmakers and my personal opinion to them is ""this should be required viewing for any independent filmmaker"". This is what independent movie making is all about.

This is not a child's movie in any sense of the word. I would say it's more along the lines of young adult and older. It can go deep sometimes, but you don't stay ""under"" for long. There is time to come up for a breath. While it does have a certain teenager charm, it doesn't pull punches with language or strong emotional scenes. It also doesn't rely on nudity or ""shock"" value to carry the story. The characters are bold and stand out on their own. Each character is well-developed. There is no doubt about who's who.

Made on a small budget compared to the multi-million dollar movies, the actors are three-dimensional. never flat, not cliche, and believable.

Violence. There are plenty of fight scenes, a touch of blood, but no gore. The choreography is well done and not over-the-top. Then there is a bit of comic relief to offset the darkness, but again this isn't slapstick or frat-boy humor. It's more like a little sweet to offset the bitter, just to keep it palatable.

There is a definite ""spiritual"" essence to the movie but no specific religious slant.

There was at least six months pre-production, makeup tests, combative training and choreography. The credits list a massive cast including extras. Most of the scenes are set in established locations; this budget didn't allow for massive sound stage constructions and it doesn't need it. There is no doubt the work behind the work was extreme.

Finally, there is the storyline itself. It is superbly written. It is self-explanatory and if one pays attention the story rounds out quite clearly (no spoilers, no not one).

Over all I highly recommend ""Ink"", not for the whole family, but for serious students of movie making, viewers looking for more than the Hollywood hype, and anyone who can appreciate the work that goes into making independent movies.",1444694400,,2498,4.820093457943925

I don't believe that there is a genre this fits neatly into.  I am just impressed by this because it was not picked up by any studio for distribution but made its way through Jamin and Kiowa Winans' own studio, Double Edge Films, and through peer-to-peer sharing became well enough known to win awards at Cannes and to appear here.

The story, direction, cinematography, cast, and effects are so well done that it is hard to believe it was not made by the big studios.  I'm happy that there are still indies out there making art and not another serialized action movie (""Terminator 20 - IMAX 5D""?).  This is unique and thought provoking and I'm wondering where Jamin draws his inspiration from.

Lastly, if you watch the credits roll by, you will notice whole families are included in the cast and crew, so you know this was a communal effort and the makers give credit to everyone and to the cities that supported them in the filming of this amazing project.",1441411200,,1177,4.634615384615385

Ink is a very well made film that I just didn't connect with.  I can't say more without giving spoilers, but I'll try to keep it relatively vague..

spoilers:
I thought of the movie as three acts.  The first third of the movie was very tough to get through because of the style of filming.  It was clear that the story was being told out of sequence and I hate it when they do that.  But you do gotta pay attention to the details or you may miss the point.  I liked the second act of Ink a lot because it was science fiction and it was a bit like the Adjustment Bureau or some Twilight Zone episode.  I thought maybe they'd go into some detail about the technology they were using.  I mean, are these spirits or are they aliens?  Why would spirits need tech?  Or why would aliens give a rat's a-- about people and their problems?  And why the witch doctor drums to open portals?!?  By the third act, I realized those questions wouldn't be answered.  It was like a David Cronenberg film in the sense that there's no real reason for the bizarre machines other than some obscure symbolism that only the super-smart seem to appreciate.  So I wasn't too disappointed by the ending because I knew the kind of resolution the film was going for.  I gave it 5 stars not because I loved it, but because I'm judging it as an artistic film and it was one of the best I've seen.  But I'm certainly no authority on art so 5 stars might be too high.  It's kinda the coward's way out, isn't it?  If you don't totally understand something you give it 5 stars and call it genius.  But all the 'important' pieces kinda fit together in the end, so I feel justified in giving this such a high rating.",1440115200,2,1776,4.229166666666667

Not everyone is as smart and genius level as the girl in THE BAD SEED, who later in life gave the most intelligent interview I have ever read, and understood every aspect of her character.

3947693,3,B002LFPBOM,"This is an independent film by Jamin Winans. This is one of two films I've seen by this director and both are in the same vein of dark fantasy. Much of this film is symbolic and time doesn't pass in a linear way all the time. In fact, its greatest weakness seems to be a by-product of this technique. Namely, the movie is about a half hour too long and suffers from redundant flashback and dream scenes, as well as not being edited economically to begin with. Toward the end of the film, I was saying to myself, ""Ok, ok, I get it already..."" and was past ready for things to ultimately sort themselves out. The basic elements of the film revolve around a good v evil struggle, complete with (what amounts to) good and bad angels who affect/inspire the sleeping dreams of we humans. There is a renegade evil being (incubus) who creates a snafu with the whole process and it must be stopped to save the life of a little girl. Winans is extremely competent with the visuals as well as effects here and creates a convincing alternate reality. I enjoy indie films like this that involve non-conventional film making techniques and storytelling, but this one gets to be self indulgent after a point. Winans' subsequent film, Frame, is a bit tighter, albeit equally strange. If you're looking for something decidedly out of the ordinary and have about 2 hours to spend, I'd recommend this. However, if you want to choose between Ink and Frame, I'd recommend Frame.",1437264000,,1457,4.607692307692307

3947696,5,B002LFPBOM,"Ok where to start this movie is about the relationship in which we see ourselves... And sometimes we see ourselves in a way that the rest of the world doesn't see us. This story is about a fathers love of his daughter but honestly not knowing who he himself is. It was an indie film created and funded without help from Big studios and I have to say they missed out they should have jumped at the chance to fund and produce this movie. By far one the most amazing and thoughtful pieces of art that makes you think and cry by the end. A highly recommended movie.

Edit:  This movie is one of my top movies and while I understand it is not for everyone because it is not a big budget movie and the filming is dark and gritty... It is movie that makes you think and consider the results of the choices that you make in life especially in regards to work and family and finding the all important balance.

I have watched it twice now and I find that it brings me to and emotional peak each time. It touches on so many points that we so often do not think of as we go through our lives on a daily basis. it recognizes that everything has a reaction and the counter reaction. it makes you realize did your actions have consequences, and it makes you wonder - What if?

Ink is one of those films that grabs you and drags you into its reality and makes you realize that maybe that's your reality Too.

I suspect I will watch this film many more times and rather than tiring of it I will find that each time I watch it something new tweaks me, something new grabs me, just something new makes me think.

I won't go over the storyline, hundred of other reviews have already done that. I'll just go with criticisms and compliments.

The good dream warriors--if that's what you'd call them, are the biggest problem. This is a grown-up movie with serious themes that are handled deftly, with care, and with great sincerity. But the good guys (dream warriors?) seem to skew to a teenage demographic. And that glaring disconnect between such a mature movie riddled with characters you'd expect to find in a teen vampire movie took me out of the experience quite a few times. On the other hand, the bad guys were excellent bad guys. Really weird and creepy--and very well done.

The lighting schemes throughout were dreary. Not that dreary is bad in a movie like this, but it was dreary to the point where it dulled the sharper edges of the film. Hopefully that makes sense. I guess that the brights should have been brighter.

Overall, this is a really good movie. It's a tad artsy but far from inaccessible as some of the more brutal reviews have branded it. And for all the garbage that you have to sift through to find a good flick, this is a good find. See it.",1431302400,,1330,4.579831932773109

The first few minutes seem promising enough, even creative; a visual montage with very little dialogue. But as soon as the characters start speaking, the inept script reveals a basic superficiality & ruins the suspension of disbelief. The story thread unravels & you lose interest because digital FX & choppy editing only take you so far.

Writer / Director Jamin Winans may just give you nightmares with his strange story of Ink, a character who looks like he stepped right out of Brueghel the Elder's Seven Deadly Sins (1558). The plot concerns the eternal fight between good guys (who give us good dreams and encouragement) and the bad guys (who give us nightmares and despair) and a little girl caught in the middle. Mix this with excellent cinematography, production design, editing, effects, surprisingly exciting fight scenes and a strong cast led by Christopher Soren Kelly and 10 year old Quinn Hunchar and you have a rare gem!

I don't understand the love for this movie. This movie makes no sense at all. How many different 'places' were there? There was reality. OK, I got that. Then there was the dream world, where everybody has about 15 guardian angels and one 'bad guy' trying to kill you? Then there was some sort of weird passage through the dream world to some other 'place'.  But the 'bad guy' has not quite attained the peak of 'SUPER bad guy' as of yet. So he kidnaps his own daughter? To bring to the REAL 'bad guys' to stake his claim among the bonafide badass crew? Were these 'bad guys' with the screens in front of their faces supposed to represent something? And he doesn't even know it's his own daughter? Because he is actually a time traveler that blew his brains out, was then resurrected in a dream world, but doesn't remember? I love strange, esoteric movies that make me think, but when you slap together four different levels of surreal absurdity into a two hour movie, it's just not gonna make any sense. I feel like I just went to Taco Bell and ate about 3 triple cheese, deep-fried, spicy beef quesarittos and chased them with 2 gallons of vodka.

3947749,1,B002LFPBOM,"Tom B. in Virginia - As a male, sci-fi / fantasy fan of many decades... this movie is a disappointment to me.  I liked the imagery and consider the cinematography, lighting and sound to be first rate.  Jamin Winans (male) is both writer and director but Ink is so strongly estrogen-driven that you might be inclined to conclude that Winans was channeling an indignant feminist or a young mother who was angry at her former husband.

Jessica Duffy's performance was torturous for me to endure.  She plays her part as a smug mother-warrior who expresses both compassion and hostility (at her male competitor) in almost the same breath.  Talk about contradictory motivations!  Her character is portrayed as so superior to this man that she is even willing to sacrifice herself for the 'greater good.'  Hallelujah!  Women are great!  Let's all genuflect.

The 'greater good' is achieved by shaking (literally) good sense into a prideful man in order to help him get his priorities straight and to put his love for his only child above all else.  Okay, that's an altruistic foundation for a plot but the undercurrent, incited by the mother-warrior's smugness, is that men cannot achieve such a goal without the help of women because men are selfish, single-minded, don't know what is important in life AND men can't help but make women suffer.  The latter is further enforced by the fact that the bad guys are just that... all guys!  Give me a break!

The film's other warriors (for the 'good side') range from being conflicted to clueless.  One of them argrily expresses her negative beliefs, albeit unfounded, about one of her team members.  This display of projection, born from ignorance, muddles earlier implications that these warriors are near-divine.  Consequently, a higher purpose becomes secondary as they morph into something akin to a pugnacious band of cohorts, just out of a kendo class, looking for guys in black dress to beat up.

I had to stop and start my viewing of Ink four times (watching other movies in-between) in order to get through it.  I would have given up about a third of the way through but I was hoping something would happen to redeem this movie (no luck).

Maybe Winans should chum-it-up with Alex Proyas (Dark City, The Crow) and get some pointers on how to make a really good sci-fi / fantasy movie.  Nevertheless, Ink is an indie film and I give Winans an 'A' for effort and hope to see other movies from him in the future with less gender-bias.

I believe Ink is more likely to appeal to girls and women, in general, and to those boys and men who are more strongly influenced by imagery than by substance.  Imaginative imagery in movies is great but, in my view, in order to rise above the fray such imagery has to be accompanied by at least one complex and believable character (only one character, Chris Kelly's, is given any depth at all) and with all characters being driven by understandable and non-contradictory motives.",1428192000,,2962,4.78740157480315

3947768,2,B002LFPBOM,"I watched this movie after a recommendation of a faith based blog praising its message and warning about sitting the first 20 min after which the movie would get interesting. So I sitted the first 30 min and then could barely watch it without fast forwarding a few times. Reading the favorable and unfavorable comments my idea is that this is a type of movie that may touch you in a good way for its positive message and its mythology of hope fighters against despair warriors and its double plot (fantasy/real world) where there is a protagonist in each realm that needs some redemption. And it helps that both protagonists find motivation in a cute girl... BUT ... for other people like me if the story doesn't capture you, the effects won't do it either. So I am writing this for people that either didn't like the movie after watching it and could use a sanity check (reviews with low stars are full of snark directed towards the fans of the movie that may discredit their opinion) or skeptic viewers that may want another perspective on the movie. Certainly you have to praise the nice message of the movie and for some people that may make the movie worthwhile, but the movie for me is tiresome to watch as the way to introduce the story can be painfully slow (blame twitter for my short attention span, hehe) and then it doesn't get better. Also the movie is full of corny scenes that may had been captivating for me when I was 15 years old. Then as others have pointed out, you get some information about the dad (and how he got stranded from her daughter) in bursts so you may understand the origin of his sadness and then some super-sugary scenes on how he met his wife. At the end you can piece together a lot of the backstory of the characters (in both realities) using those snippets of info, but still the main story can be a snoozefest (or at least it was for me). So at the end, for me the movie has an amateurish feel (in scripting, acting, dialogue, and filming) and it can be boring to watch, but if you are in a deep need for a hope story you may like it. Definitely not an overachieving movie for the budget as others suggest, I camp with those that remark with snark that the movie has a film-student seal on it. Maybe I'll watch it again with a friend to make jokes about it :-) this movie has potential as something that is so bad that may be so good.",1425427200,,2375,4.351351351351352

3947772,5,B002LFPBOM,"Written, directed, and scored by Jamin Winans; the singular vision and focus shine through and through in this epic story.  It's the little details like every scene lit in green represents the dark side, gold represents the light, and hyperwhite neutrality.  Repetition for effect (which I'm a huge fan of) is shown both in key lines of dialogue and pivotal scenes revisited from another perspective.  Another example of attention to detail is the ""pathfinder"" character, who often counts to 4 to measure the beat of the world; now apply that concept to the movie.  Continually count to four and you realize that an absurd number of cut scenes happen on the 4th beat. (pure genius!!!!!!!)  This movie expertly tells two intertwined stories with liberal use of ""Tarantino"" style timeline editing.  The acting, score (such sweet audio bliss), and visual art style are all top notch and create an interesting universe I would very much like to see more of.  Did I mention this movie was made on a 250K budget?  There are very creative special effects (think fight scenes) and costumes that will make you forget your watching a ""low"" budget film.

Everything here is old, and you've seen it before...but the presentation here is what makes this film great.  The writing gives the most important characters room to grow and live while letting secondary characters shape the story around them.  The story is simple and has been told a million times before, yet here it is provided in a new light with a different take on it.

If your interested in a story about characters who you can sink your teeth into, this one has it.  If your looking for an effects extravaganza with action and adventure, this ain't for you.  The effects are fairly sparse but used to good effect.  The action is there, but it exists solely to drive the story forward.  The fighting isn't beautifully choreographed kung fu sequences, its quick, dirty and jumpy.  Its not filmed to show an artistic and surreal combat but simply because combat was useful to drive the story at that point.

Also, it seems that all the audio and video were separate and then combined poorly, maybe that's just an issue here on amazon but I'm fairly certain it's just bad production and editing. Also for all the fight scenes in the movie, you'd think they'd have done more work for them. Don't worry what the movie was supposed to be, worry about what it is.

3947795,3,B002LFPBOM,"INK is a film I heard about while watching a review for another film, THE FRAME, and so I watched it based on the reviewer's admiration for it. Now having seen it, I must say that it is visually creative and unique, but it also suffers from iffy acting and a predictable story. The basic plot is that a wandering soul, or Drifter, captures the soul of a young girl in hopes that he will be accepted into a cabal of nightmare creators known as Incubi. Meanwhile her father, who is having problems of his own, has to find a way to reconnect with and save her. One thing that really recommends this movie is the mythology that it sets up which is unlike anything I've ever seen before. There are two different realms, the real world and the dream world, and in the dream world there are several different kinds of beings. There are Storytellers who give people dreams, Incubi who give people nightmares, Pathfinders who are able to affect the course of people's lives, and Drifters who are the wandering souls of people who have died. None of this is really explained in depth, but is shown first and then explained a little bit later in case you missed it. If there is one problem, it's that the narrative is a bit exposition-heavy in parts, but never for very long. My favorite part of the film was the visual style, though. There was an ethereal, chiaroscuro-esque filter that lent the film a dreamlike quality. They were also creative with the visual effects and editing which provided a disorienting effect as you try to figure out what's going on. Still, some of the editing wasn't that great, especially in some fight scenes between the Storytellers and Incubi. It was in those scenes that the film's low budget really came to the fore. However, the biggest drawback to this film is the acting. It was downright weird at times and felt a little hammy/stage-like, so much so that it kind of took me out of the story. Overall, the end result was a bit of a mixed bag. On one hand, you have the strong visual style, but then you also have the (at times) weak and obvious writing coupled with some sub-par acting. Still, if this film is any indication its director is one to look out for, and for what it's worth this was an interesting watch.",1421193600,,2243,4.486552567237164

It also has some very intense and emotional moments that I can totally see influencing the flashbacks you see in ""The Grey"". It is sold here as a cross between ""Its a Wonderful Life"" and ""SIN CITY"", but I would also drop in ""Dark City"",  ""Pan's Labyrinth"" and ""Inception"".

You have to get past the fact that there isn't anyone well known acting in this movie and you can tell some of the lines come off as forcibly delivered. As such, I will give special mention to Jessica Duffy as the Storyteller for a great performance and Chris Kelly as John. Also worth a mention is the bumbling Pathfinder, who brings a bit of humor to this very heartwarming journey of one man to find what is really important in life. This is exactly what you get when slimy Hollywood doesn't get their disgusting hands on a good story and it manages to becomes a movie anyway. Very, very refreshing.

it's great that all the filmmakers's film school classmates and hip indie film festers have given this such great arm pump reviews; really, i like that ""go team!"" spirit ... even though the raves are not, uh, specific about what's actually so *great* about this movie.

3947892,5,B002LFPBOM,"I can completely understand the negative reviews and the people who do not like this movie.  It is easy to see why.  Being an independent film, it does not have the production value, crisp effects or polished acting that one would expect out of a blockbuster movie.  However, the story is derived from somewhere dark and wonderful with mysterious characters and a unique flow.  It does not over explain things as the viewer is left to pick things up or assume as the story starts its flow.  Filled with a unique perspective of the two-sides-of-the-same-coin mentality, INK rushes at you with a sense of wonder and awe from the initial scenes.  If you give it a grain of salt for some of the repetitive nature (the tic-toc line used far too often, for example) and alow some grace for a few of the lines that really do not work, you will be left feeling fulfilled by the end of the movie.",1372723200,,887,4.478260869565218

This is one of those fake movies so it seemed the overall message of the movie was WEAK and lame to me.  I ended up doing other things and letting the movie play out.  The movie would also be VERY confusing if you didn't read something about it.

The good thing about the movie is the visuals and creativity.  There's lot's of it and it is good to just see creativity though at times it makes NO sense.",1372032000,,756,4.326241134751773

3947895,2,B002LFPBOM,"A commendable work on a small budget.  There is some noticeable visual talent here.  I'd give it 1.5 stars if I could, and tell any one who is in film school that it might be worth checking out for some low budget creativity.

Acting is generally pretty bad.  With a small budget, I'm happy to forgive some rough takes.  But, there are a few too many in this movie.  I'd say about 50% of the lines are delivered with a big enough hitch to fall flat.

Maybe most painful is the written dialogue, some of the writing is pretty hacky.  Attempts to make the business situations seem like anything that would induce an ounce of stress on the father character are good for a laugh.

Frankly, a number of the 5-star reviews here have signals of paid review stuffing.  Many accounts only have 1 review submitted, many others only have a handful of reviews all submitted on the same day, many also have a very high proportion of five star reviews given across their reviews.  Open up the profiles of 5-10 of the reviews that say it is the ""best movie ever"" and I don't think you'll have any problem spotting suspicious patterns.",1368921600,2,1119,4.463054187192118

When a dark-robbed figure kidnaps the soul of a young girl, it is up to the Storytellers to awaken her father from his selfish stupor in order to free her from evil's grasp! INK is a mind-blowing visual masterpiece created on a micro-budget, which offers a unique fantasy world of found objects that rivals the ones found in MIRRORMASK or CITY OF LOST CHILDREN at only a fraction of the cost. Director Jamin Winans transforms the mundane into the imaginative through the use of creative camera work, practical effects, and a unique story structure as he weaves together his modern fairy tale. Winans enhances the emotional impact of the images on screen with his own original score. The combined results produce a touching character drama that will shatter all expectations and strike a deep emotional chord with the audience.

It was a bit hard ""getting into"" at the beginning but the rest of the film was really well done, and I like the concept of a reality on one level is being played out while on a different level, there is a battle between light and dark for a man's soul. And, how the father is heading down on a path where he is meeting his own and others' destruction and these light beings (Storytellers) are working to save his daughter and he would become the one to save her by going to her instead of giving into his ""vanity and pride.""

The fact that the ""flow"" was interrupted by the Pathfinder in order to get the father hit by the truck (so that he would be in the hospital where his daughter who's in coma) is interesting and what seems to be a ""divine intervention"" since the father was going down spirally.

Its pretty sad when some one can make a film this great for $300,000 and Twilight cost $110 million that's something to think about?

  The cinematography is amazing the story line is complex and the acting is emotional in a lot of scenes. If you are not a person that likes challenging films this one will not be for you. I look for movies like this and on blu-ray this movie is worth every penny. I hope that that ""Jamin Winans"" gets a solid distribution deal he deserves it greatly. We need more film makers like him in this industry..for sure! Just think he financed this himself because no studio would produce it now that's something to think about ? But yet Expendables 2 got a theatrical release ? That says a lot about American cinema and what they will put out there. His next Film "" The Frame"" is coming soon can't wait to see it.

3947918,5,B002LFPBOM,"I really enjoyed and was surprised by this film. And if this makes sense to anyone, it ""stayed with me"" -- in the way that beautiful art or music sometimes does. And I don't mean in the way a pop song will stay stuck in your head for a while. I mean art that leaves an impression in your mind, such that you keep thinking about it for days, weeks, months, even years. The movie was so memorable that years later, I now and then still imagine scenes from the movie playing out it our own reality (and when I saw the film The Grey, I recognized one of the main songs as being from Ink).

Sure this movie isn't perfect, but it is beautiful and it stays with you. I highly recommend it.

A few disclaimers if you didn't know already - yes, it is an independent film and was done on a smaller budget so the production value is not like that of a sci-fi fantasy blockbuster, but the visuals are still really well done. Also, if you're looking for a family-friendly film, I'd say this is OK to see with older kids, though there is some strong language in the beginning of the film.",1356480000,,1074,4.183574879227053

NO SPOILERS WITHIN!

""Ink"" is a creative juggernaut.  I mean it...I was floored by how this film did such a great job at what so many multi-million dollar movies fail to do: use every iota of their power to move their audiences.

No million dollar cast, no amazing special effects (and for a fantasy movie at that!), no ad campaign whatsoever, and still I sat there stunned by how well this minor little project from an independent film company (Double Edge Films) worked.

""Ink"" is a movie that I don't want to tell you too much about, but I will give you the barest of bones: while there are gentle spirits who slip into our bedrooms at night to give us pleasant dreams, a lovely child has an ugly beast slip into her room to steal her away.  For reasons as yet unknown, perhaps even to the spirits themselves, the spirits decide to save this girl, and the movie depicts this struggle.  I should also say that, while a child is central to the work, it is not a work necessarily FOR children.

I am sure I have done this movie a disservice to describe its plot in such generalities, but I think the greater disservice would be to rob you of the pleasure at peeling away the layers of this clever, brilliant work.  I was certainly puzzled often as this film moved along its path, and as with many mysterious, ""intellectual"" movies I wondered if I would get it, and if the film would be worth the effort.  Believe me, YOU will, and IT will.  In spades.

(Incidentally, I placed the word ""intellectual"" in quotes in the paragraph above because, while I think it is an intellectual film, I don't want you to think it is one of those heady films for nerds.  I think A LOT of people would like this movie.)

And while this is indeed a largely metaphoric work, you don't have to be an English major to follow it.  I do feel I need (and want) to see it again, as there are layers of this onion that I will have a more enhanced enjoyment of on my next viewing.  But I think the beauty of ""Ink"" is in -- after breathing ""Wow!"" at the end of your first viewing -- getting together and talking about it with someone.  It's really a bright, bright piece of film making.

And to get back to those effects: without cheapening anything, director, writer and co-producer Jamin Winans (who did the editing AND music as well!) deserves much credit for getting inexpensive techniques to do so much.  This is no ""Our Town"" where the people lie on the floor to depict graves or climb a step stool to go upstairs.  But with simply ""Pop!""-ing people into or out of a shot (a technique available to cinematographers since Chaplin), or using lighting, or costumes, or even putting a distorting pane of glass in front of glass in front of some characters' faces, you'll right away feel you're in a whole different level of the world.  It really works, and absolutely doesn't come off as cheap.

As with the rest of the film, the actors are first rate.  I've often wondered why we always dote on placing the same elite group of actors in all the films we see, and this is good evidence for not following that route.  Chris Kelly, Jessica Duffy, Jeremy Make...these are names we should be hearing about much more than we are.  They are terrific in their roles and I was surprised to find that none of them have yet been in any major film.  They, like everything else in this fine movie, work wonderfully.

If you like smart cinema that works on a variety of levels, you'll love ""Ink.""  See it, and spread the word around.",1337817600,,3495,4.4034267912772584

They fondly remind me of something that might have come from a Twilight Zone or The Outer Limits.  It isn't a ""boring"" film either, well paced with a few action scenes in the vein of The Matrix.

One of the most heart-felt and redemptive stories I've seen in some time. Occasionally, the low budget does show, but what they were able to accomplish on their shoestring budget is actually quite amazing. To be honest, I almost turned it off after the first 30 minutes or so. It takes a little while to get going and for the audience to get a sense of the direction it's heading. A few of the earlier scenes are a little jarring and occasionally cheesy, too. But about half way through the movie there is a scene that stands apart as one of the very best scenes ever put on film. A scene which changes the trajectory of the whole movie and begins to weave the threads together. The climactic scene of the film is another one that just blew me away. I was literally watching it through tears. You'll know these two scenes when you see them. So I implore you to persevere through the first half of the movie as it gets a whole lot better. And the first half of the film is a lot better on subsequent viewings when you know in advance where it's headed. The cinematography is great, most of the performances (especially the main character) are great, the soundtrack is excellent.

3947934,3,B002LFPBOM,"<strong>Ink</strong> (Jamin Winans, 2009)

There is a sense, from the very opening sequence, of pure, absolute wrongness about <em>Ink</em>, the second feature from director Jamin Winans (<em>11:59</em>). It sounds, from the various descriptions one finds around the web, like a family film, though not necessarily a children's film (the closest analogue I had in my head, before I started watching, was <em>Paperhouse</em>). But then you get to that opening sequence, where John (Chris Kelly, returning from <em>11:59</em>) comes storming out of an office building, throws himself into his car, and begins cursing a blue streak at the top of his lungs while driving off at high speed in midtown traffic, and okay, this is not a film for kids at all, eh? And yet, the basic premise of the film is still right in that young-adult-fantasy niche: Emma (terminally cute Quinn Hunchar in her first screen appearance), John's estranged eight-year-old daughter, has her soul stolen by Ink, a demon who inahbits a parallel universe. But I'm getting well ahead of myself.

Plot: There is a universe parallel to ours, but whose denizens interact with us constantly. On one side we have the Storytellers, who come into our world at night, often dressed in the height of eighties fashion, and bring us dreams. On the other side are the Incubi, who wear a lot of pleather and very cool visors, and who are responsible for bringing us nightmares. Ink (short, of course, for Incubus) is a wannabe-dark soul who is trying to find a perfect gift to bring the leader of the Incubi in order to get himself a promotion (and cooler threads). He chooses the soul of Emma (Hunchar) and abducts it; in our world, she goes into a coma and no one can figure out why. Her grandparents, who wrested custody of her from John after their daughter died (we find out how somewhat later in the film), try to reach out to John, who started out selling junk bonds in a boiler room and is now a multi-millionaire executive, to come and be with his daughter. He throws the bitter words they told him during the court battle (specifically, ""you no longer have a daughter"") back in his face and escorts them out of the office while on the verge of a deal that could allow him to retire in this thirties. But beneath the quotidian veneer, the storytellers and the incubi are fighting for control of Emma's soul, and Allel (<em>Skills Like This</em>' Jennifer Batter), Emma's storyteller, ropes in a couple of her pals, Sarah (<em>Hidden Lives</em>' Shelby Malone) and Gabe (<em>The New Republic</em>'s Eme Ikuwakor), and hires a pathfinder, Jacob (<em>Suburban</em>'s Jeremy Make), to see if there are any...alternative options for getting Emma's soul from Ink before he can turn it over. But other forces are at work here, as well: Liev (<em>The Inner Room</em>'s Jessica Duffy), who is either the leader of the storytellers or just a legendarily powerful one (that point is never made clear), has also taken an interest in this fight, and moves to protect Emma in her own way as well. Meanwhile, the Incubi are amassing their defenses, including sending one of their own (Troy Garner in his first feature appearance) to shadow John 24/7, a move made only in the most extreme circumstances...

The best thing about <em>Ink</em>, by far, is the care that went into the worldbuilding here. Winans, who also wrote the screenplay, obviously put tremendous thought into the storytellers, the incubi, and how their world interacts with ours. Just based on the ease of the flow there, Winans probably came up with hundreds of little details that never made it into the story, but colored his perceptions of how these worlds interact. That's a must with worldbuilding, and every author worth his salt knows it, but it's rare to find in movies. It really adds to the atmosphere here.

The worst thing about it is that the fragmenting of the movie's timeline is handled badly. I don't know whether I'm just watching more movies that do this nowadays or whether it's becoming more common for filmmakers to try and pull off these sorts of time stunts in the post-<em>Memento</em> world, but very few people seem to be able to do them right, even in movies I otherwise adore. The most common question by far on the IMDB board for this movie is ""what the hell happened in the last scene?"", and I admit, I jaunted over there after I finished watching the movie to see if my interpretation of what I'd just seen was right. (According to the prevailing wisdom, it wasn't, and I get the arguments made for the prevailing wisdom--but I still think my alternate explanation of the end makes as much sense given the clues sprinkled throughout the movie.)

Sitting in the middle is that overweening sense of wrongness I alluded to right at the very beginning of this review. The whole childlike-sense-of-wonder thing is really, really cool, and I appreciate that Winans was--I assume--trying to bring that into a more adult-themed movie. The problem is, it's not an adult-themed movie, is a kid- (or young-adult)-themed movie that attempts to prove its ""adultness"" solely through the use of what is euphemistically termed as ""adult language"" in the MPAA's system. Looked at as a YA fantasy, it's complex, inviting, and at times probably inappropriate (again, because of the language). Looked at as an adult fantasy film, it's somewhat less. It tries to have its feet in two different worlds, much the way its supernatural characters do, but the film itself is far less adept at bridging them. Still, it's worth watching, and there is a gem hidden under these rags. You can see a good deal of it at times as you watch this movie. ***",1329264000,13,5671,4.836251287332646

There is room for criticism, mostly due to the low budget stripping down wardrobes, make up.  The visual effects are clever and well orchestrated even if they draw thin.

Yes, the quality of filming is low, and it lacks any recognizable star power, but these things actually endear the movie to its audience.  We are able to connect with the characters in a fuller way.
The thoroughness of the mythology this film establishes in such a short span of time is impressive.  It takes an experience many of us share, our vivid dreams, and skews it beautifully into a great supernatural conflict.
The characters are engrossing and original (especially the character of the blind Jacob), and anyone who can watch this film without falling for the extreme child-cuteness levels Quinn Hunchar probably needs the lesson of this tale more than they know.
Don't be fooled, this is definitely a morality tale - it's meant to teach a lesson.  But it does it in such an open way without sacrificing the element of story that the audience comes away without feeling preached at.

I have no problem with less structured films. That's the beauty of independent stuff. But this film had a very thin plot and terrible actors. It paid no attention to character development -- at all. The best acting came from a very young girl - and I'm sure I'm being generous to her because of her age and cuteness.

The cinematography is horrendous. It looks like it was filmed with a webcam. The director looks like he tossed in elements just to make the film underground.

Mixing them all together would seem like trying to mix oil, water, and sand, but instead we get an esthetic, personal approach to independent film that only Ink can bring. With ethereal lighting, a more-than-decent script, and authentic acting, Ink dazzles the eye with dream-like cinematography, touches the heart with endearing characters, and provokes the soul with themes of redemption from shame and wretchedness fashioned for an audience who appreciates art in film as well as entertainment.

When the world falls asleep, the forces of good and evil wage war against each other. The stakes; human souls. The battlefield; their dreams. As the two sides travel around giving out their dreams and nightmares, a mysterious drifter known as Ink abducts the soul of a young girl in hopes to barter her for a place in the Incubi, the assembly of evil responsible for the nightmares. Meanwhile, in the natural world a businessman's family life takes a downward spiral at the death of his wife, requiring a miracle in a most unexpected form to reunite him with his daughter and in-laws.

From the beginning of the film, the viewer gets thrown into a dual plot line of interpersonal conflict with little to no exposition of how the fantasy world operates. This is a plus for viewers who enjoy thinking and putting things together. Be advised, this is not a movie to watch if you're looking for mindless entertainment. The film assumes an intelligent audience.

With the film's low budget, Ink does not have the fancy CGI or special effects of Hollywood, so one could critique the simplicity of the good and evil beings and their worlds. But what lacks in special effects is made up for in creativity as the camera shots are more about the quality of the story rather than quality of the action. Parents, use discretion for younger audiences. Although there is absolutely no sexual content, drug use, or bloody violence, Ink is rated R for language. There are also elements that may frighten children, such as some nightmare sequences and the appearance of the Incubi who give out the nightmares.

The title of the movie refers to its central antagonist, a man-like creature that moves back and forth between many worlds, one of which is our dreams.  The story itself is a blend of tragedy, drama, action, and suspense, all centered around the conquest of love over greed, selflessness over selfishness, and redemption.

If you're every wondering how seriously to take a reviews just check the other reviews an individual has written and sometimes you'll see a pattern that might help you make up your mind if a film is for you.

This wasn't so much a movie in my mind as just a really well told story.  It reminded me of the Firefly series with regard to the quality of acting and dialog.  The actors are really comfortable in their characters, which is what makes any story real.  This isn't something I would let my kids see, at least not until they were in their early teens.  This isn't for kids, it's a story that parents should watch, or anyone who may be a parent soon.  Life gets strangely tougher and tougher the older we get, and it's easy to lose our way in the perceived complexities.  This story is about a father who loses his way after dealing with tragedies and unhappiness in his life, and how the kernels of goodness in him help him to come back from edge of true destruction.  Yes, the language is realistic for people going through tough times, and yes there is some fighting (actually underplayed I though for how well those scenes were choreographed), but the interactions between the Storyteller, the little girl, and Ink are what make the story.

I'm an former straight-leg infantry soldier (for those of you who know what that means) who grew up in the deserts of Nevada, I have an awesome wife, two young children, and a busy work life.

Somehow, though, none of the reviewers mentioned all of the cursing. The first words uttered as the movie starts are a bunch of F-bombs yelled by a driver. I guess that was somebody's ""creative"" idea to get the viewer's attention. We didn't want to turn it off right away, and thought maybe it was just an unusual part. But we soon found out that the swearing is a constant for this film.
The next time that actor was on, a few minutes later, he was dropping F-bombs again--several in just a few sentences. And the ""hero"" is introduced just as tastelessly. We watched about 20 minutes or less of this movie and shut it off. I don't expect to change anybody's views on cursing, or convince them that it detracts from a story. But I do want to warn those who are thinking of viewing this movie and don't want profanity-laced discourse.
This actually looked like a good movie idea, and we didn't care that the film is not high-quality. But the gratuitous cursing totally ruins any other good efforts, as far as this reviewer is concerned.",1314230400,6,1175,4.547169811320755

Surface plot is simple. Good vs Evil. Monster abducts little girl. Her father must save her, but father has problems of his own. It's told in a beautiful artistic fashion, moving back and forth in time, somehow bringing everything together at the end.

Words can't describe how deep and beautiful this movie is. I think it's a work of artistic genius. If you have any doubts I urge you to see it. Rent it on net flicks if you want, but give the movie a chance.",1314144000,2,699,4.410852713178294

There is a very short section where you might start to doubt your decision to watch this movie, but it is fleeting and suddenly you are rolling again into this virtual world of dreams and nightmares, dashed hopes and lost souls. This movie did not get the attention it deserves and truly got lost in the world of mega bucks Hollywood thrillers. Made on a shoestring budget by independent filmmakers and actors, it is STUNNING both visually and story-wise. Really wish it had gotten more publicity, but I can only say it it well worth your time to watch it. The child actor in this movie is mesmerizing to watch. The storyline itself is a trip into the realm of genius. I know I sound over-enthusiastic, but we just watched it this weekend on the strong recommendation of my daughter. My husband and I are not young-uns, but we were totally taken by this whole concept and found it thrilling and edge of seat exciting. It's a combination of the worlds of Tim Burton, del Toro and any great action film with hand-to-hand combat for someone's soul!

3947961,4,B002LFPBOM,"Whilst the indie movie trend has gotten bigger and trendier over the past couple decades, low budget movies tend to stick with Dramas, Comedies and Romances. Without big budgets, you can't compete with James Cameron and Michael Bay movies head-on with a fraction of the production values.

There is always a major risk factor in making an indie movie with heavy special effects. When competing with Industrial Light and Magic and 9-digit budgets, it is difficult to make fantastic or sci-fi effects that the average moviegoer can take seriously. In this, Ink is ambitious, and mostly succeeds. Although the color filter and bloom effect are cranked to extreme in several scenes, there are many unique and interesting effects in this movie that are fun to watch.

There are several characters who are played woodenly by actors, and the focus of the movie isn't always clear (for about two thirds of the movie, it is difficult to discern who the actual protagonist is), but with a few clever plot twists and bends in the trail, Ink ends on an enlightening note and is a perfect example of how a low-budget indie movie can tackle the sci-fi and fantasy genres with a little love and dedication.

Overall, without spoiling any of the plot, I recommend this movie to anyone who appreciates a film in which its makers' limited funding didn't stop them from crafting their dream project.",1311811200,2,1380,4.863829787234042

It's a good effort, and I imagine that the director will go places with a bigger budget and a better editor, but as a fantasy film it cribs more ideas than it develops, and I just found the characters to be more tedious than compelling.",1310947200,2,598,4.6761904761904765

3947966,4,B002LFPBOM,"Ink is a very strange movie that is enjoyable just for that fact.  It centers around a little girl (Emma) who is stolen from her bed (whilst sleeping) and left comatose despite the best efforts of protectors - Story Tellers - who spend the nights keeping sleepers safe.

Her father (John) is at once uncomfortable with his role as a parent and attempting very hard to be there for his daughter.  It is almost painful to watch the way he interacts with his daughter, coworkers, and himself.  The way that he handles his life is perhaps so painful because it shows the darker natures of our own being.  He is not a terrible man, nor is he a good man, and his progression throughout the film is inspiring.  Even the way he copes with his pain is difficult and hard to comprehend.

Our young heroine / captive is delightfully imaginative and elegantly strange.  Unlike most little girls who spend their lives playing with dolls in the tea party variety she is a dedicated tomboy, and endearing for it.  She seems to understand with the coy intuitiveness of a child precisely how to interact with those around her.

The Story Tellers dedicated to our perfection and peace during the time of sleeping are both strangely detached and overly loving.  They exemplify the roles of protectors very well, trying to remain above situations and still maintain a compassion for those they protect.

Ink is a frightening fellow because of his entire desire to belong which is echoed by the other characters in the film.  His desperation is palpable throughout the movie.  Without revealing plot, the twist of the ending - or rather its resolution - is both heartening and touching.

The dream sequences of the movie, in fact, the entire movie is incredibly interestingly filmed.  It is both pleasant and delightfully odd.  The effects of the cameas are both heightening to the overall eery and always dreamlike qualities of the film and distracting.  The film cuts around a lot as we learn about Jacob, John, Emma, and the other characters.  While some of the images and presentations of characters can be grating they are acceptable because we are in a dream world for almost the entire movie.  It makes sense when we stop to examine the odd way our own dreams present themselves.

While it isn't perfectly filmed and is clearly a lower budget production, Ink has a very different take on a common storyline: redemption and family.  It's well worth watching, and it's one of those movies you can come back to again in the future which makes it very shelf worthy.",1306627200,,2547,4.727891156462585
3947967,1,B002LFPBOM,"(...some recommendations of what might be nice to watch instead are at the end of my review.  If you're looking for a kid's movie, be sure to check the rating, not all the ones I listed are PG - Sprited Away is a fantastic choice if you are looking for something to watch with your kid and IS everything this movie and its 5-star reviews promise and fail to deliver on.)

Warning - There are many sub-professional aspects to this film.  If you have an academic interest in this film as a film-maker, film student, film teacher, great, but as an actual movie a consumer is thinking of purchasing or renting, think twice.

If you are looking for a sort of magical journey kind of movie, your money would be much better spent going with something made by Jean-Pierre Jeunet or Guillermo Del Toro.  (Hellboy 2, probably Del Toro's most mainstream movie, is STILL more artistic than Ink...  and probably has far less total minutes taken up by fight scenes than Ink.  Ink has a LOT of time spent on choreographed fight scenes.)  Or if you haven't seen it yet, watch The Fisher King.  For about the same price as renting Ink, you could get a well-written, well-shot, well-acted version of what was attempted with the Ink character.  Kids and grownups would get an infinitely more wondrous journey watching Hayao Miyazaki's Spirited Away.  Or heck, The Labyrinth or The Neverending Story.

The film comes off as if it were a first draft.  Just the way it was shot is on an amateur level - I don't mean the camera is bouncing around like Blair Witch or Cloverfield, I mean a lot of the time, the director doesn't seem to be thinking seriously about very basic things like where he is placing the actors or the camera to make the scene look interesting on a basic level.  The dialogue is oftentimes badly written - the most obvious thing to say is what gets said.  The plotline is predictable.

Overall, it looks like someone had a bag of interesting tricks they knew they could use, some decent overall concepts, and tried to flesh that into a full length film.  There was one scene in particular that was actually really interesting and it is well-enough done that anyone watching the film will recognize which scene I am referring to... but a 5 minute scene can't justify a 140+ minute movie.  (... also there is a scene using almost EXACTLY the same concept in Jean-Pierre Jeunet's movie Delicatessen, not sure if that's a case of great minds think alike or heavy influence)

It's obvious a lot of effort must have gone into Ink, even just from the number of locations and people involved.  From that perspective... one is really tempted to start reviewing it as a student or amateur effort and cut it some slack, but this is a film being sold on amazon, not something your favorite nephew made in AV class that you will sit down and indulge for his sake.  If you are looking for an evening's entertainment, you can do much, much better - in fact, you get a better chance of seeing a movie fitting this movie's description if you search elsewhere.

3947973,1,B002LFPBOM,"...how so many people could stomach this tripe.

Independent does not mean good. This film had some of the worst dialogue and plot tropes than I've ever seen -- far worse than any Hollywood blockbuster. It's as if someone gave a major budget to a film school student who'd only ever seen ""The Neverending Story"" and ""The Grudge,"" who then tripped acid to a compilation of corny endings from 80's buddy cop movies interspersed with an Intro to Adobe After Effects course on loop, and created this movie on the comedown. Or perhaps the director is part of an arthouse consortium with good liberal reasons to plaster a shape wipe or a snow effect over every transition and a wash-out filter over every scene.

Seeing how many people love this movie is just like being in art school with that student and watching his crap movie get made and then cram on cute poon. This hurts the tummy almost more than watching the thing.

The acting is awful and the dialogue style stolen from Jonas Brothers slash fiction, which in tandem produce stunningly unwatchable scenes. As for the plot: it's original, but utterly confused, hookless, and melbetoast. Oozing through everything is a dense, American cheese. And what about the cinematography/special effects, you ask? They're just okay.

Bottom line: overly serious and unaware of the tropes of its genre, this movie attempts to float on the originality of its plot and crashes straight into hell. Not recommended unless you've seen less than five movies and are just trying to get your experience up.",1303344000,8,1539,4.862595419847328
3947974,3,B002LFPBOM,"First, I DID like this movie overall. When reading reviews and comparrisons to Dark City and Donnie Darko, I had to pick this up. Those comparrisons are way wrong. This is in no way like those movies. Meaning, it is not on thier level but is still a good obscure movie for fans of this genre.
Our story of the girl being in a coma and the plot that some beings bring us our good dreams and some bring us bad dreams was very original and I loved that part.
What made me drop my review a bit was the lack in continuity. There is a scene where a woman is in the room with the child next to her bed. She cannot be seen or touched and makes sure not to touch the girl's hair when reaching for her BUT she sits on the bed which effects the movement or interaction with the girl. Holes like this just bugged me.
One more example is when Ink is actually saving the girl but she tries to yell for help, she reaches for a woman (flat palmed) as though she was going to push her and not grab her or poke her. In real life, she would have grabbed or poked the woman. Not put her arm out like she already knew she couldn't interact with the woman.
As I said, it is a good obscure plot, well made for the most part and very original. Worth the watch but it is not on the level of the movies it is compared to.

Basically, this film stole my heart, but it in a jar, and forgot to put air-holes in it.

I was entranced, emotionally invested, and, even though I'd figured out who Ink was by the middle, I sat through to the end with fat tears rolling down my face.

This film was clever and beautifully done for such a low budget. I'll take a good story over special effects any day.

3947978,4,B002LFPBOM,"This movie sat on my shelf for quite a while before I was willing to actually watch it.  From reading the cover, and looking at the images, it really didn't appeal to me.  I find many indie movies to be pretentious and self serving, so unless I hear from someone that I need to watch one, I skip over them.

Ink was a pleasant surprise.  It's low budget was glaring within the first few minutes.  Still the production team made due with what was available.  Sets, costumes, nothing showed signs of big budgets, yet the overall aesthetics of the film were quite beautiful.  You won't find any award winning acting here, but it is done well enough to be believable and compelling.  The characters lacked depth, yet there was an empathy towards them that kept you rooting or booing for them.

The story while not uniquely unique, is different enough from the mass produced dribble that we've grown accustomed to.  On the surface, it's the time told tale of good versus evil, but underneath is a look at our inner demons, and how our choices impact those around us told in fantasy with monstrous villains, science fiction heroes, and a world just foreign enough to keep you off balance.  All through the story you're wondering is this a dream, or is it meant to be real.

I don't know if it's because of my current situation in life, or if the film was just more powerful than I expected, but it left me emotionally drained after watching it.  It touched on subjects that were close to my heart, and pulled at my emotions in ways I haven't felt in quite a while.

So if you can overlook a low budget indie title, and forgive it's minor short comings, there is a wonderful story that will tug at your heart.",1297987200,,1702,4.466019417475728

After watching it on Hulu, I decided I HAD to watch it in Blu-ray, and when i did the colors and sounds were even more stunning.

3947993,4,B002LFPBOM,"This movie starts out near its ending and then rewinds to its beginning and then goes beyond its ending and wraps around back to its ending. Sounds confusing? Maybe, but it is cleverly done so that you are kept wandering what is really happening. But isn't this what dreams are made of? It seems while you are watching this movie that your sub-conscious leaps out to contradict your own natural understanding.

What the writer of this film attempts to capture is the interface between the natural and the metaphysical/spiritual realms. The fight scenes demonstrate this marvellously well. Furniture and fixtures are broken as the warring factions of the metaphysical realm fight ... but then they reconstruct themselves to reflect their unaffected status in the natural realm.

The characters are extremely unique, the one that really stands out is the path-finder. Althought he is blind his level of perception is astounding and he is able to capture the rhythm of the universe, in order to unite father and daughter, he has to find the right element that will break the flow.

This film has some excellent special effects and reveals the nature of good and evil in the metaphysical realm. The film also deals with deep truths, such as faith and belief, and even forgiveness of one's own self.

3947994,5,B002LFPBOM,"Not being able to sleep one night, I wandered to the tv and browsed my netflix recommendations.  ""Ink"" had been long recommended to me so I picked that, expecting to fall asleep---hoping to fall asleep.  But the very opposite happened, and I sat up long into the night crying my eyes out, and standing up after it was over feeling like a better person.  This film is remarkably creative, fantastically told and executed.  It puts most big budget Hollywood blockbusters to shame.  I thought ""Avatar"" was the best movie I had seen (visually).  ""Ink"" proves that no matter how good your movie looks, it is ultimately the story that makes all the difference.

This film isn't for the faint of heart.  If you're someone who enjoys sci-fi, fantasy, alternative movies to the typical flicks---yea, you'd dig this.  But it probably would be lost on your mind if you're not a deep thinker, don't get much out of the arts, and only watch movies for entertainment value.",1287014400,2,959,4.728915662650603
3947995,5,B002LFPBOM,"Seriously.  It might not have the special effect of any big Hollywood blockbuster, but it's not a story that needs it either.

This may or may not be your kind of movie.  ""Snakes on a plane"" wasn't really my kind of movie either, doesn't mean I'm going to discourage others from trying it out.  Everything in ""ink"" was superb, from the story to the directing to the acting.

So my one suggestion is watch it.  Definitely watch it for yourself, and decide if this film is for you or not.  But seriously watch it all the way through.  Everything comes together at the end, everything is explained.  So watch it entirely before shutting it off and ranting about how confusing it was so you shut it off.  Everything comes together.

""Ink"" is one of the most original, well thought out stories I've ever seen in a film.  However, this is a film you can't turn your brain off for, so if you don't like a movie that stimulates your mind along with everything else, then pass it up.  Honestly after reading most of the one star reviews, I'm pretty certain that's what the issue was.  They wanted a film they didn't have to pay attention to to get or enjoy.

Yes, sometimes you want a film you don't have to think about.  A no-brainer plot that you can just mindlessly enjoy.  This isn't that.  This film is brilliant, and original and simply amazing.  But you do need to actively watch it or you'll miss its splendor.

As for those that commented only the cast and crew are the ones giving this a five star review, that's not true. I wasn't a part of this film.  Hell, check the credits and compare it to my name if you don't believe me.  I didn't work on this film.

But I do have Netflix.  I didn't know anything about this film, but noticed it and it caught my attention so I put it in my instant streaming queue.  Not knowing much about it, I ignored it for a while, in favor of the number of big studio films I hadn't had a chance to see in theaters.  After a few months I finally decided to try this one out, and coming into it not knowing a thing about this film, I would probably have been most set up to be confused by it, if this film was at all confusing.  It's not.

Just watch it.",1285372800,,2185,4.237864077669903
3947996,4,B002LFPBOM,"I am not going to waste your time repeating all the four and five start reviews for Ink, but I'd like to make a a few addtional comments.

Ink has eye dazzling special effects but Ink is not just eye candy (albiet sometimes dark eye candy). The excellent story and the films ending is greater than the sum of the whole of all the eye popping effects - and this is what a sci-fi, fantasy or spiritual film should be - and which films most are not.

A few folks complained that there are some ""lesser experienced"" actors in Ink - but I feel this is OK in that it enhanced the naivete or innocence that was a large part of many of the characters personalities. The entire cast deserves top marks for their performances.

I also liked that Ink has a spiritual message concerning the soul, the possiblity for redemption, that someone may be looking out for us and that God exists.  Spoiler: (I believe that this is what the film was saying, because the Path-Finder (or one of the angels) speaks of God in one short scene). But - and this is important - Ink never preaches or bludgeon you with its perspectives.  In any case the final message leaves the audience with a feeling of genuine hope - a rarity with the multitude of dark nihilistc endings that we come to expect these days.

Ink displays top film-making skills in story telling, ingenuity, editing, photography, imagination, and a whole gamet of movie making techniques. The film makers also made one of the best possible uses of a very limited budget that I have ever seen. They certainly got the biggest bang for their buck!

According to Ink's director - Ink was made for $250,000 - that is truly amazing - and with the quality of the final product - easily pushes the film into 4 and 5 star category.  You will understand what I mean when you see the picture.

If you want to know more about Ink you can read all the other four and five start reviews.  Better yet - see it for yourself.

My only caveat - Ink deserves a rich 5.1 surround and not the simple two channel that is on the disks. Something to look forward too someday? Let's hope so.",1284940800,3,2103,4.380462724935732
3947997,4,B002LFPBOM,"I honestly liked the movie a lot. It might have to do with the fact that I'm a father to a little girl and this movie is about a father and his daughter. Was the design a little cheesey? yeah but if you have an open mind and accept the fact that this is a fantasy, it becomes acceptable. It had a very nice, somewhat emotional ending. I just miight pick up the Blu ray.",1284508800,2,369,3.933333333333333
3947998,3,B002LFPBOM,"The main concept is refreshingly new; the attempt to provide evocative scenes admirable, but the execution of this film was what was so very disappointing. Had it been animated or handled by a more experienced director (or a team of artists like those who did Coraline) it could have been truly amazing, but it suffers from a lack of imagination in certain key areas and this has nothing to do with its purportedly low budget: dialogue, direction, acting, costume are not given enough thought or attention. The decision to make the main character for e.g. look like a sad version of Cyrano de Bergerac was laughable, as was misguided the decision to make the ass-kicking defenders of dreams out of a weird mix of 80s punk rock types and renaissance fair devotees. Genres and styles uneasily rub against one another while the actors are often at a loss for words and the director struggles to make the whole cohere. Yes, there are beautiful moments and beautiful words (uttered basically by one character) but these unfortunately fail to effectively build toward what should have been (at least for me) a less predictable conclusion.  If you are one who generally appreciates the fantasy genre or films that strive to break the mold, you may well like this film, but personally I liked it only for what it allowed me to glimpse it could have been.",1283558400,4,1346,4.776824034334764

Most of the time, so much attention is paid to special effects and making everything so stylized that things like plot and story are little more than afterthoughts.  However, every now and again, a movie is made that does it right.  Ink beautifully captures the dream-world surreality while staying true to a well thought out story.  It is poignant without being preachy.  It is a fairy tale on acid.  I think everyone who enjoys a movie that requires you to think about it will love Ink.",1282694400,2,546,4.75531914893617
3948000,5,B002LFPBOM,"I watched Ink on a whim, a recommendation from Netflix I assumed I'd shut off in fifteen minutes. Instead, I found myself pulled into a beautiful, hypnotic world of dreams, longing and redemption: the world of ""Ink"".

The story follows Ink, a scarred, spectral ""Drifter"" who steals a young girl into a dream-like astral plane, leaving her body in a coma close to death.  He seeks to trade her for a transformation into one of the shadowy ""Incubi"", false-faced beings whose shadows bring horrific nightmares. Pursuing him are a group of beings called ""Storytellers"", whose touch brings peaceful dreaming and who seem to oppose the Incubi on general principle. Back in the real world, meanwhile, the girl's father, John, struggles to choose between his Incubus-touched ambitions and his love for his daughter and his family. Weaving amongst it all is Liev, a lone Storyteller seeking to free the girl from her captor--and Ink from his self-imposed torment.

What makes ""Ink"" most powerful, however, is the hypnotic beauty of its world. Soft-edged, golden dreams and the nightmarish, static-edged realm of the Incubi are woven with equal skill around the gray clarity of reality. It's a world where dreams are real and hope is possible,  even if the light of it may flicker and dim under the threat of despair and shadow. Even the action scenes are glorious, using of combat not as filler, but as a means to illustrate the running conflict between hope and despair. With little more than lighting effects and shifts in color, ""Ink"" deftly blurs the line between fantasy and reality, until all that matters is the intertwined struggle of Ink, his pursuers, and the obsessively driven John. When all the threads are finally pulled together and the ending is revealed, the result is nearly transcendent.

Defiant and brilliant, mystical and shadowed, ""Ink"" creates one of the most unique fantasy worlds I've had the pleasure of watching in quite some time. Less bleak than ""Dark City"", but more dreamlike than ""Inception"", ""Ink"" is highly recommended for all movie lovers--especially those with a taste for the works of Neil Gaiman or Terry Gilliam.",1282176000,4,2143,5.025352112676057

There wasn't time to ponder anyone's character since the shot will not be on screen long enough for a total mental process to occur. So we only had a vague idea of character and purpose. It just moved to fast, and we stopped caring about it and lost interest besides becoming increasingly more irritated.

3948007,3,B002LFPBOM,"Technically I should give this film two stars, the dialogue and most of the acting is mediocre at best, but I feel Jessica Duffy did well as the storyteller. The reason this has such a high score is because I felt the concept of this movie was really awesome, and the ability to turn a simple story of a father's redemption into something epic and still intimate is quite a feat, so the grander rating is for the concept and writing of the story. The dp and the editor of the film have proven themselves able, but need to master filming fights. I understand the use of quick cuts from time to time to add urgency and fury to a battle but when it's used every time there is a fight it loses it's potency and causes the audience to wonder if the actors just couldn't pull off a believable fight. My advice: don't change shots simply to add variety. Like everything else make sure it adds to what's going on. I'm not talking about the 'fantasy' scenes. There are numerous moments at the beginning of the film when people are just talking and within a span of 10 seconds we get like 7 different shots. But good job!",1279929600,,1111,4.320574162679426

3948010,5,B002LFPBOM,"There are many better reviews on here, but I wanted to make sure I added my praise.  This was simply the best movie I've seen in years. I watched it on a whim and have never been more pleasantly surprised. There is a visual style, a care and concern for the effects and the story that goes far beyond the budget and makes this movie 'work'. The budget is small, but for the most part you can't tell.  The movie reminds me of elements of Labyrinth, the Matrix, and Pan's Labyrinth, the Sci Fi channel's remake of Alice in Wonderland, even many Anime I've seen, but the closest comparison I could think of is Neil Gaiman, though I'm not really an expert in his works.
  The story is fresh, but it may remind you of things you've seen before.  The world is new, and there are many meanings to roles, responsibilities, objects, etc. that you get the feeling you don't fully understand. However not everything is spoonfed to you - it's left to you to 'explore' and 'understand' the logistics and metaphysics of this other world yourself - something I love, but people used to the traditional hand-holding of Hollywood may not appreciate.

I think fans of strong female roles in action films will like this, and I was thoroughly impressed with the acting of the young girl - she pulls of a HARD role with a lot of believability.  The bad guys are creepy and sinister in a completely new way that (as others have said) does remind me a bit of the Strangers in Dark City, but are their own creation.

Overall, I think this is definitely worth a watch - I would say that if you like any of the other movies I've listed, you will probably at least appreciate this movie, if not enjoy it immensely.",1278633600,,1687,4.419354838709677

3948012,5,B002LFPBOM,"Every night, people are visited by the dream-bringing Storytellers and the nightmare-producing Incubi. And caught between them is Ink.

That's the concept behind ""Ink,"" a surreal, eerily-filmed movie clothed in haunting questions about life, death, dreams, nightmares, good and evil. Jamin Winans' second full-length movie has a pretty weird vibe -- think Neil Gaiman directing ""It's a Wonderful Life"" -- but it ends up being a dizzying, beautiful journey through a strange other world.

A creature named Ink appears in the bedroom of a girl named Emma, and kidnaps both her and a Storyteller named Liev. Ink  hopes to become an Incubus, and Emma is his one chance. Emma falls into a deep coma, and her father John refuses to go see her because his in-laws snatched custody of her away because of his alcohol and drug problems.

In the meantime, the Storytellers set out to rescue Emma and Liev from Ink, and must get some help from a blind Pathfinder who can change reality as he wishes. And as Ink drags his prisoners to Drifters who hold a code he must claim, Liev begins to sow seeds of doubt about what he is doing -- and his true nature and horrendous past come to light.

""Ink"" is the sort of movie that people like to hold up as an example of independent cinema -- unique, groundbreaking and cool. It's filmed in that luminous grey-toned style that ""Sin City"" was, and Winans fills it with a sense of neo-urban surrealism -- the goth Storyteller, trash-filled warehouses, electric-tape on Jacob's eyes, and tattered pockets with weird Drifters dwelling in them.

Winans both directed and wrote this movie, and both show a lot of care. His story jumbles time, space and dimensions, playing tricks with your mind; and he crams it with slightly off-kilter scenes that  are brilliantly simple (Jacob finding ""links"" on an urban street). And he has a knack for horror -- the Incubi are depicted as terrifyingly, artificially cheerful screens in front of faces. You don't SEE their true faces, but you know it's horrific.

But he also shows that he can pluck at your heartstrings in rare style, particularly as we find out what Ink did to become the tattered, crowlike figure we see. The latter parts of the movie are a haunting, painful celebration of love's power, without any sappy platitudes.

Well, it would be giving away too much too much to say who/what Ink is. So I'll just say that Christopher Soren Kelly is brilliant at conveying Ink's tortured emotions from inside a shell of rags and a beak-nose. Jessica Duffy comes across as artificial when talking to Emma, but does a decent job otherwise; Jennifer Batter is simply brilliant as a warm-hearted goth Storyteller who is determined to save Emma. And Jeremy Make is just FREAKING BRILLIANT as the delightfully eccentric, infuriating Jacob.

""Ink"" is a near-seamless blend of horror, action and fantasy -- and while Jamin Winans does brilliant things with film, he's also an excellent storyteller. Just not the butt-kicking kind.",1278028800,3,2993,4.874015748031496

3948014,5,B002LFPBOM,"Wow.  This film is so far beyond its paygrade, so different from anything I've ever seen I am struggling with words to describe it.  Like another reviewer I almost ejected the DVD a few minutes in.  Fortunately I caught a glimpse of something familiar in a mundane street scene and realized it was filmed on location in Denver (my old hometown stomping grounds) so I gave it a chance.  My reward?  A new all time movie favorite.

Basically this is a fantasy film about redemption revolving around dreamscapes, life's choices, love, shame and reclamation.  The initial scene is startling... the back-story line unfolds with an ordinary suburban street as backdrop, slides into dream and continues as a parallel tale unfolds in the main characters' real lives and dreamlife (or is it the after-life?  Hmm).  It's so quirky, the timing is flawless and the plot so full of twists it will keep you guessing.  Sorry folks I want you to be as clueless about its content as I was when I watched it.  You will get no help from me!  Just watch and be amazed.  Two thumbs way up especially for the filmmakers' vision (and their attention to detail in their presentation of) the storytellers, pathfinder, and incubus characters.

As each scene unfolded I found myself wondering ""who ARE these geniuses?  Is this really an indy film?""  By the closing credits I was touched to the core.  And after learning more about the creators and production in the bonus material I was absolutely slack-jawed with awe.  Everything about this film is unique.  Everything from the concept to the screenplay to the costuming, casting, lighting and music was of the highest quality.  My respect for the Winans knows no bounds.  In a way I feel sorry for them - how can they possibly outdo this one?  The quality they achieved on a $250,000 budget exceeds 90% of the garbage coming out of Hollyweird.

I watched it again tonight, this time with my husband. I gave him a bit of an overview before he watched it just so he wouldn't be as confused as I was at the beginning. He enjoyed it as much as I did.

I was glad to find a movie that is a little more cerebral than the standard scifi/fantasy fare that is offered these days. I liked the themes of guilt/shame/pride and ultimately redemption.

3948016,5,B002LFPBOM,"I heard about Ink via Netflix, and after watching it (the Blu-Ray edition), I must say - I was very impressed.

The story is about a battle over the life of a little girl - in dream-land and in real-life.  Will she be taken, or will she live?  A universe filled with dream-land warriors seeks to battle for her fate in the real world.  Storytellers, Pathfinders, and Incubi.  Hospital visits and business deals.

The film is rather rough around the edges - the acting isn't top notch with no-names, it feels like it was shot on home video cameras.  It reminded me of lower-budget professional films:  Fireproof, the Left Behind series, stuff you'd see on SyFy on a Sunday afternoon, etc.  It's indie - take it for what you will.

However, I was able to ignore the above for one simple reason:  the material was better.  The SFX are great, the visuals are haunting, the story is moving.  It does have an amateur feel - but I actually didn't find this a distraction.  In a sense, it made the film more real... how many people do you really know who act or behave in the fashion popular actors do in Hollywood films?

3948018,4,B002LFPBOM,"I was pleasantly suprised by this film, so much so, in fact, that I felt compelled to write my first Amazon review in what's probably been years(and no...I'm not in any way related to the film makers). Since others have already discussed the plot, I won't rehash it here. I'll just talk about what I liked and my experience watching the film.

Knowing that it was an indie film with a tiny budget, I wasn't expecting much. But it got good reviews, so I thought I'd give it a whirl. When the movie began, it was about as I expected. Some wooden acting and a bit of a hum-ho, predictable script (thus, 4 stars rather than 5). However, once things got rolling, this movie really pulled me in, and I even shed a tear or two towards the end. While not perfect, I think as a whole the film was very entertaining, and even thought provoking in parts.

I was really impressed by the visual aspects of the film, and even more so when I watched the short ""making of"" in the special features. I couldn't believe how creative they were with using everyday materials. I also thought that the lack of super-high-end computer effects (which are so predictably present in just about every movie these days) was actually a good thing. The directors had to focus on the story and enhance the story with visuals, rather than cover up the lack of a story with fancy CGI.

I also enjoyed the fact that the directors didn't shove the background mythology in your face (like where the storytellers and incubi come from, why they do what they do, where live live, etc etc). They gave you enough to make it interesting, but withheld enough to let you formulate your own ideas and ponder the film after watching it.

If you like sci-fi/fantasy or fairytells, I would recomend this film. Don't go into it expecting ""the best film ever."" But if you keep an open mind and can get past a little wooden acting and focus on the story, you should be as pleasantly suprised as I was.",1274832000,,1949,4.450980392156863
3948019,5,B002LFPBOM,"I watched it glued to the screen. Its a great movie. Its not predictable at all and the actors a really good for unknowns (or fairly unknowns). They even have some ""steam punk"" usage, actually quite a bit, and the special effects are reasonable and not the main point of the movie. It actually has a story line and a plot, something missing in most of the new releases we are getting out of hollywood these days that are weak in that department. I would recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys fantasy/sci-fi/drama type movies. It is a bit of a tear jerker in the end, so let me warn you, it does grab your heart, holds it, and then squeezes for sympathy and compassion.",1271635200,,672,4.384

3948021,5,B002LFPBOM,"I absolutely loved this gem of a film and had no idea what the heck it was when I rented it from Blockbuster. I don't pirate movies, so I didn't hear of it that way, I just picked it up on a whim because I liked the synopsis and was curious to see why it was compared to other great surreal flicks such as Dark City, Pan's Labyrinth, Matrix and Donnie Darko. Well, it really isn't anything like those other films other than having a parallel dream world as part of the plot and it is exceptional in its own right. I am shocked it was made for only $250,000, what efficient filmmaking! There are skin flicks on Cinemax which cost that much to make. The style and artistic direction really made this film look higher budget than it is and the exceptional acting by Chris Kelly and Quinn Hunchar gave life to the main characters.  The car accident was very well done. I also love tales of redemption.

Not every movie is for everyone, but this one really tugged at my heart while spoiling my eyes with visual flare.  What the movie lacks in special effects and CGI they make up for with a stylistic saturation of colors, similar to what you would see in a music video.  This helps the film focus on what matters the most, story and pacing.  I will be adding this to my collection while keeping an eye on talented writer/director, Jamin Winans.",1270425600,,1340,4.365461847389558

3948024,5,B002LFPBOM,"""Ink"" shows why we need indie movies, and just how high a standard they can reach. This movie defies easy description: there's a family drama centered on a ruthless workaholic, but layered together with a fantastical faceoff between unexplained agents of positive and negative dreamworlds. And, despite a total lack of explanation for anything, the two clearly tell the same story. Visuals (no I won't give any spoilers) have impact despite simplicity - I don't know the name for the dark force in this flick, but they make The Strangers from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dark-City/dp/0780622553/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dark City</a>&nbsp;look positively jovial. Effects are simple but effective, like the windows and furniture that shatter and reform as the otherworld combatants throw each other around. Even things like color and contrast demarcate different dimensions of this complex world, helping to orient a visitor like me to what's where and when. Editing has a jagged, nervous quality that some might find jarring - it seemed to me just to echo the uncertain qualities of every reality involved. On top of it all, they got a child actor, a very cute girl who looks to be eight or so, with more range and presence than a few headliners I can name.

No big studio would have put a buck behind this complex, intelligent, and dark fantasy. No one snappy catchphrase sums it all up, no one comparison orients anyone trying to imagine it. And it certainly isn't for viewers who need full explanations and clear direction - you're picked up and thrown into a story with huge unspoken history and rules only guessed as you go along. But, if you follow the most brilliant innovations in cinematic story-telling, this has to be on your list.

3948028,4,B002LFPBOM,"Particularly interesting about this DVD was the special feature showing all the effort that went into making ""Ink"". The director made a great effort to make this film within his budget and wound up producing a very visually stunning film filled with interesting characters and scenery.

The main story is a fantasy about a young girl and her father interacting with creatures that inhabit a dream-like world. One set of beings are responsible for dreams while others generate nightmares. The story takes off when the girl's ""soul"" is snatched up by the character named ""Ink"", for some nefarious purpose. This action causes a related series of events revolving around the estranged father and the girl, the battle between the dream and nightmare people and the father's sense of guilt, regret, loss and redemption.

Despite the small budget, Ink is a remarkable film that is visually appealing with a great ending. I especially liked the way the ""cause and effect"" theme was explored in this film. Its good to see that this was not another quickie horror/sex comedy/slasher flick - which is usually the kind of small budget film that I see stocked at the local video store.

The fact that it was shot on a shoestring with no commercial studio backing was just plain heroic.

It's not Raiders or Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings. OK? It's an Indie picture made on a limited budget and it absolutely Rocks! with innovative and artful cinematic elements. Have I figured it out completely? No, I admit, not completely. But that's part of its beauty. It's cryptic and it plays with you through time and space. It's not a sci-fi, and it's not a pure fantasy. Thematically it's a movie about the battles we fight within ourselves every day.

When I popped in the DVD I thought it might be an interesting little supernatural sci-fi type fare that would be pretty standard but entertaining. But it definitely blew me out of the water in terms of the depth of the story and the characters. The father in particular is compelling and it's tragic to see him struggle with the events of his life.

I highly recommend checking out this flick. After it's release it became one of the most torrented films which is largely the reason it has experienced the success it has.

3948043,4,B002LFPBOM,"I figured out the plot of this film very early, but still enjoyed it. It is a morality tale, but with the amount of Narcissism in the world, I'm for anything that asks people to look at themselves. It is basically a story of a father's relationship to his daughter. The plot is complicated by people from other dimensions who control the dreams humans have and inspire them to good or evil. It is the old God versus the Devil scenario, but with a more psychological focus and hot new age warriors who battle strange entities.

The ""evil"" entities who represent the sin of ""pride"" are black clad figures whose faces are projected eerily onto glass plates suspended in front of their real faces. ""Ink"" is a dark side ""wanna be"" character who is trying to earn his place with the group by delivering a child to them. To me one of the biggest flaws in this film is the rather laughable fake nose and obvious rubber mask worn by Ink. It made a very scary figure look like a homeless, former reveler in a poorly done Italian Carnival mask.

The simple plot is augmented by a few ""new age"" ideas, such as those of the blind character ""Pathfinder"" who can orchestrate links between seemingly unrelated things in order to create major events. The special effects work but are not worth your Blu-ray dollar because of how they are done. They consist of grainy film clips, film tinting, overexposure and creative editing work. None of these look better when augmented with a sharper image.",1263081600,,1478,4.59469696969697
3948044,5,B002LFPBOM,"I am glad I bought this film sight unseen, having only heard some good things in the alt. press.  'Ink' is not a major film, it didn't have a major release, or advertising.  It was made by a couple in Colorado who wanted to make it.  They raised the money to do the project themselves.  Their friends helped. They made their own costumes, made their own music.  The actors are mostly unknown, and up and coming.

I don't want to give away the plot hook, suffice it to say that Ink is a modern fairytale about fatherhood, told as a battle between forces of light and darkness, with the key players being a girl in a coma, and her estranged father. The supporting characters are the Storytellers, beatific beings who give people good dreams, and the Incubus, dark beings who give people nightmares. And then there is the enigmatic Ink, who carries Emma into the dreamrealm, to sacrifice her to the Incubus to insure his transformation into one of them.  The how and the why is where the real drama of this film lies, and it's ultimate revelation is one the most emotionally profound moments of redemption in any film I saw of 2009. It brought me to tears. Finding it in such a small film is quite special.

I did find there was a confusing bit of character development in the film that felt like a cheat, but on repeat viewings realized the film uses a non-linear narrative device. The title of this review is the clue.

A word on the transfer: this film is quite beautiful in hi-def.  Now, there are alot of overblown contrasts, image softening and color treatments, some heavy digital noise in the darkest segments, but detail is usually very sharp, if not striking.  I found all of the photography choices quite clever, and lend to a strong nostalgic feel. The sound mix is very clear at low volume, except for the dialogue gets a little quiet near the climax.  The music by director Jamin Winans is magisterial, and perfectly lends to the action and emotion of the story.

He's grief-stricken over his wife's death, he's estranged from his daughter, and a major deal for his business is at risk of falling through. The story is also about two factions of warring spirits. The Storytellers, in balance with their emotions, bring pleasant dreams to humanity, guiding people towards their potential. The Incubi, on the other hand, have cut themselves off from their emotions, hiding behind a facade of vanity and pride, living in a hell of their own creation. They bring nightmares to humanity, drawing the vulnerable in to share their fate.

The movie is an excellent piece of independent cinema. The fantastic elements are interesting and fit well with the visual style of the movie, the story starts off enigmatic but fits together in the end, the visual effects do a wonderful job of conveying the blending of dream and reality, and the cinematography is stunning.

At first I was a bit put off by the low budget camera work and obvious raw acting by some of the cast.  I thought it was going to be another cheesy direct-to-DVD snooze fest.  However, as the film went on it grew on me.  At the end I was hooked.  Ink left me with the same feeling that other visually-striking films such as The Fall, Dark City, and Equilibrium did.  I wanted to watch it again, and it stuck with me days after I'd seen it.

After researching the film and the writer/director/producer/composer/etc. Jamin Winans, I was thoroughly impressed with what he had created.  This is an extremely talented man who made a very impressive film about the internal struggles many of us experience every day.

Did everything work in this film?  Not at all.  But the overall story was thought-provoking and lasting.  Not every performance was nailed but the leads were very impressive.  I especially thought Chris Kelly did an outstanding job of showing a range of emotions and really captured the essence of a man at the end of his rope.

All in all, I think Winans got everything he possibly could have with the resources around him.  I have a feeling this is just the beginning of a solid career for him.  Support independent film and check this one out.  It may not be a global masterpiece, but it beats most of the big-budget films I've seen in a while.",1262822400,2,1470,4.503787878787879

Intriguing at times, but sorry ending. Too many loose ties, but I loved music score, the cheap effects (were well done), the fact that it mostly tried to be original and the little girl Emma was cute.

What was the purpose of the storyteller .. I missed something there? That Ink was the girls father .. good, but the connection between the father being with the girl in a coma and the girl in the 'dream' and both having to save her at the same time, even though time operates differently .. very tenuous. Why was the girl so important to everyone? How come all the fantasy figures had superhuman fighting powers? And so on.

I went into it without any preconceived notions since I'd never even heard of the film before, much less read any reviews. Let me just say that those giving this film 1-2 stars are way off their mark. Say what you want about cinematography and production values (this is a low budget film) the movie is convincingly beautiful and at times spectacular. There are moments where it has rough edges (for example the 2nd ""drifter"" is very much overdone) but cumulatively this is a very enjoyable film. The story is a bit hard to follow at times and occasionally the acting runs a little thin, but that is overcome by believable central characters and a few very interesting and well done scenes. I absolutely loved the 'butterfly effect' montage in the middle of the film, as well as the film's concluding sequence. The central love story was very well done and convincing--a love story that actually showed some characterization instead of just sexuality as shorthand for love.

The best part of the film? The score. Flat out the best score I've heard in quite a long time. Ambient, downbeat, symphonic; it elevates the film a whole star in my opinion and takes what would simply be a 'good' movie and makes it into a memorable one. There is so much tripe pushed out by Hollywood these days that it's nice to see a lower budget film put them in their place. This is a wonderful little film, and if you enjoy science fiction or fantasy, you'd be remiss to skip it.

When a movie manages to scare you, wow you, excite you and bring you to tears then there's definitely great story telling happening.  Please check out ""Trailer #1"" online, you should know where to look.  Words sometimes can't do it justice.  I still get chills even watching the trailer.  I'd classify this movie as a fantasy/drama/sci-fi but as you may have read already, there really is nothing like this movie, and that's another strong point.  So many movies these days are so big-budget and CGI-based that all you are left with is hollow, flash in the pan entertainment.  Certainly the low budget for this independent film is obvious, but with a clever use of some simple effects, lighting and unique costumes & sets - you are still blown away due to the creativity and powerful story.

I also have never noticed such an incredible use of sound effects in a movie before.  Most note worthy is the metal cigarette lighter flick sound when the beings appear in our world.  Amazing choice.  I don't just hit 5 stars because I like a movie.  Ink deserves every one.  Please do not miss out on such an amazing piece of work, a true art form in itself rooted deep with emotions we can relate to.",1262563200,,1256,4.504424778761062
3948050,5,B002LFPBOM,I found this movie on Netflix on Demand and had never heard of it and had no idea what it was about other than the short synopsis of the movie provided to me. This movie is a low budget movie but I found the story so moving and beautiful. I think a lot of people will miss out on this movie due to not being able to focus on the story and be absorbed into it but for those who are able they will leave knowing they have just seen something very special. This movie will be one of my personal favorites.,1262476800,,502,3.9313725490196076
3948051,4,B002LFPBOM,"Shot high contrast in a hazy, diffusion filter (probably post-production effects) this film effectively evokes the dream state, which is its subject matter. Not as brilliant as a David Lynch dream sequence, yet not caricaturized. It has a ""Dark City"" feel to it but less existential and, for lack of a better word, more dreamy.

The plot fails to capture until maybe half way through, but ultimately satisfies despite some cliches and awkwardly misplaced dialogue.

For my taste - and the reason I bestow 4 and not 3 stars -  the cinematography saves the film. The birch forest shots are truly breathtaking. Also memorable is the sequence orchestrating the protagonist's car crash. Good stuff there.

The soundtrack compliments the subject matter and style nicely and offers a few memorable high points. It's something I might buy if available.

Overall a 3 star movie for most people I suppose. I bumped to 4 based on my own bias for beautiful shots and pleasing soundtrack.",1262390400,11,975,4.957055214723926

3948053,5,B002LFPBOM,"Stumbled across this gem on Netflix and just happened to watch it one day.  It was fabulous.  It's imaginative, mesmerizing, and mend-bending.  A truly great science fiction/fantasy film.  Packed with well-choreographed action scenes, but also deeply moving and intelligent.  Reminds of me of the Matrix a bit, only more emotionally deep.  The story involves a battle between unseen forces of good and evil that seem to battle for individual souls while people sleep and dream.  This cosmic battle is juxtaposed against the battle one workaholic and alcoholic man wages in his own soul.  Highly recommended.",1262217600,,607,5.315789473684211
3948054,5,B002LFPBOM,"I stumbled accross this film online without any prior knowledge of this film. As I watched, it became obvious that it must be a low budget Indie film. BUT, I am another reviewer that has to say it's probably the best new release I've watched in the last five years.

I have to say right off that I believe it's going to be something you either love or hate. In no way would this fit into the generic class of movies dribbling out of hollywood to attract all classes of viewers. Reading through the reviews, both positive and negative, I notice that several of the 1 or 2 star reviews still have positive remarks about this film, but like I say, you will either love it or hate it and it just didn't click with them.

If you have a desire for unique, thought provoking, films that drive your inner voice to cheer or feel for the characters, then I highly recommend you give this one a try. Few movies today accomplish the emotional response that this one did for me. Most big budget films are all eye candy visual stimulation lacking any emotional attachment to the characters nor do they have thought provoking storylines.

Pros:
Minimal dialoge: I for one appreciate a visual story without endless dribble from the actors that make standard movies understandable without even having to WATCH the movie and this film accomplishes it completely. You must pay attention to this one and appreciate the nuances of the visuals to create your own understanding as it progresses. All of it comes together at the finale.

Special effects: I felt the special effects to be top notch for such a low budget film. As I watched I assumed it was probably made in the 10s or 20s of millions, not the 250,000 I discovered after the fact. Incredible !!!

Acting: With minimal dialoge, the acting becomes a visual function. The look on the brunette's face during the chain reaction seen is exactly as mine must have been as I watched in amazement. I found that all of the main characters were very convincing with there facial cues. The little girl ""Emma"" seemed as if she were a pro.

Music: Perfect fit. Nothing that would live on forever, but high quality.

Cinamatography: Angles, lighting, scenes - top notch. As good or better than big budget movies.

Cons:

The nose,,, mission accomlished. I think it had to be intentional, as I now I realize how much it drew my attention to the Ink character.

Simplistic sets: Typical urban streets, nothing flashy. Although I do not necessarily view this as something that was a drawback. Only that it was the first thing that tipped me off that it must have been a low budget film.",1262131200,2,2609,4.591397849462366
3948055,5,B002LFPBOM,I saw this movie at StarFest in Denver. It is one of the best genre movies I've seen. Completely original and thought-provoking. Add this to your collection of movies that you'll love to watch over and over.,1262044800,,207,4.621621621621622

This movie is not for everyone.  If you like mainstream cinema you probably won't like this.  On the other hand if you abhor mainstream cinema, if you cringe at one-liners and overplayed, under-dressed actresses, if you watch movies because of their directors and their writers instead of their actors then perhaps you will like this.  There is no way to describe what it is about because it loses too much in the telling.  Simply put, this film was one of the most interesting, most creative, most poignant pieces that I have witnessed in the last 10 years.  Waking Life, the Matrix, Being John Malkovich... the film ranks among these cult beauties.  And yet it's like nothing you have ever seen.

3948058,5,B002LFPBOM,"This is only the second review of anything I have ever experienced or purchased.  Working nights, I need my sleep, but this film made me forgo some.  I started reading some reviews from others, but felt it would taint my opinion.  Browsing the video store shelves, this caught my eye only after my third circuit around (needed to use my coupon before it expired).  The plot appealed (good/evil), darkness, innocents... The jacket with the recommendations (by who?) gave me pause, but what the hey.
  The prologue, a bit dry, but it sets the scene. Then, wow, instantly arresting.  The understated soundtrack was hauntingly appropriate; the sometimes monochromatic look, intermixed with amazing landscape shots, kept me mesmerized.  I get extremely nauseated by hand-held camera footage but I didn't realize until post-reflection how much there was (or little...I'm not sure--there's better stuff to comment on).  Yes, the dialogue felt a little stilted and the father comes across stereotypical, but I went with it.  And was rewarded.  Immensely.
  The editing is superb and is a large part of what makes this film FEEL the way it feels.  You know I like the soundtrack.  The camera does justice to all it frames, sometimes achingly so (especially...mmmm...Jessica Duffy).  The characters are ""in your face"" easy to hate or like (obviously not a film that makes you continually question your values as you watch).  Sit back, or lean forward, and let the film tell its story.  And later, as it did to me, it flits in the edges of your memory, finally compelling one to KNOW, to learn more, to wish it didn't end, and finally to share. Enjoy.",1261785600,,1640,4.945054945054945
3948059,4,B002LFPBOM,"I started to watch this film, then turned it off, disappointed at the poor video-like quality, stilted dialoge and acting.  Then, with nothing else to watch I resumed.  I became interested, then enthralled.
The director said that he used a lot of 'cheap tricks' for the effects, and that much of the impact of the scenes comes from post-production work.  For instance, some of the costumes wouldn't even pass for bad Halloween costumes.  Yet the final product is often very effective.  That was part of the enjoyment for me, being able to see the limited means put to such creative use.
The movie makes and works within its own fantasy world of multiple levels of reality and kinds of beings, much of which is symbolic of ideas from Christain theology and mythology: good and evil beings fighting over humans, Divine Providence, redemption through suffering and humility...",1261785600,,873,4.9520547945205475
3948060,2,B002LFPBOM,"All the 4-5 star reviews, just like on Netflix, are by the people involved directly with the movie and friends/family.  In general, the movie is on par with a made-for-TV SYFY Channel produced movie, and we know how good those movies are... [insert sarcasm].

Yes, it's an indie movie with a limited budget.  I could care what the budget of the movie is -- all I want to see is a good movie and if it costs $15k, $15MM, or $150MM to do it then whatever, it's a means to the end.  That being said, this movie feels very amateur.  The plot, dialogue, and acting are weak with somewhat annoying characters.  The good: the special effects and lighting are good (for the budget) in many areas (ex. the bad dream guys); the fight sequences are fairly good as well, but a little too much ""shaky-cam"" and choppy/chaotic editing.

All in all, while not trying to be mean to the filmmaker, I would rather have those 2 hours of my life back as the movie wasn't very good, and not even close to what some of the ""reviews"" were saying.  The way they're giving these false reviews is going to have a backlash effect with people, like myself, feeling ripped-off and leaving honest reviews about the movie's short-comings.",1261785600,10,1206,4.525345622119816
3948061,5,B002LFPBOM,"I bought Ink on one single recommendation from a stranger on a forum here on Amazon. I've never been so pleasantly surprised by a blind movie purchase in my life!
Ink is an independent film, not with an enormous budget, but it doesn't stop it from being an incredible film with gorgeous visuals. You can see how much work went into every single second of this film. This movie stands out among everything else I've seen in a long time. Absolutely unique. The acting was fantastic, especially the acting from the young girl Quinn Hunchar, playing the character Emma. The ideas were original, the characters interesting, and the plot was engaging. And the ending... prepare for one hell of an ending. And some of you will need to keep some tissues close... A description on the back of the package compares the movie to Brazil, Donnie Darko, The Matrix, Dark City, and Pan's Labyrinth. I would definitely group it in with those films, although it is not a ripoff of any of those films at all.
Quick synopsis: there is another world, a dream world where two sides are fighting to control our dreams. Some our bringing us pleasant dreams, and others, the incubi, are bringing us nightmares. A battle ensues over the soul of a little girl named Emma, trapped in their world while in a coma... and the deciding factor falls on two men: John in the waking world, Emma's father, and Ink, a rogue warrior in the dream world, fighting to rid himself of his scars and shame.
This movie is absolutely incredible, please do yourself a favor and check it out.",1261008000,327,1545,4.621818181818182
3948062,2,B002LFPBOM,"...but really, this wasn't much of a movie.  Silly, unlikeable comic-book characters (no, not ""graphic novel,"" but more like a hasty '80s knock-off of some dimly-remembered '50s meme); rote chopsocky ""fights"" that go on and on with lots of grunts and people being hurled around and smashed against things without suffering any damage; endless ""we need another 30 seconds of filler"" passages of captive girls being led or dragged on meaningless treks.  When it was over, I thought well, maybe reading too many good adventure/horror/graphic novels has made me jaded and it really wasn't that bad, so I turned to my friend Ruth who had also sat through it and said ""So, what did you think?""  She hemmed and hawed a bit so I said ""Well, how would you rate it?""  She asked ""On what scale?"" and I replied ""One to five, where five is something you just can't wait to watch again, and one is something you can only barely refrain from killing me because I suggested it.""  ""That helps,"" she said.  ""Minus three.""  And I have to go with that.  If you're twelve years old or under, you may enjoy it.  If you're an adult with reasonable expectations from a movie, chances are your experience will be somewhat different.  (Note that the glowing blurbs, er, 'reviews' quoted on the box are from ""Ain't It Cool News"" and ""Film School Rejects"", and that the line ""INK has been compared to cult classics BRAZIL, DONNY DARKO, THE MATRIX, DARK CITY and PAN'S LABYRINTH"" doesn't quote sources, nor does it even venture so far as to say whether or not the comparisons were favorable or derogatory.)",1260662400,12,1577,4.701818181818182

One of the most interesting and moving movies I have seen in a long time. I hate using the term brilliant because it's vastly overused however I think this one case where it's hard to describe it in any other way. The acting is decent for such a low budget movie, the story is incredibly original, the cinematography is excellent and the visual effects rival anything that a big budget Hollywood movie can provide. It's a movie that makes you think and keeps you guessing until the end. it's a movie with action, adventure, dark fantasy, horror, drama and sci-fi all rolled into one amazing cinematic experience.

The music in the movie is what kept it all together for me though, sort of transient house music or something. It seems slow at first (or confusing), but does pick up after about the first 20 mins. The director really leaves a lot of the connections to be made by the viewer, which I liked, we don't need everything spelled out for us ALL the time in the movies.

3948069,4,B002LFPBOM,"The rare film where both the visual effects and the actors' performances are inspired, ""Ink"" creates a richly textured fantasy world populated with a mixture of evocatively real and deliciously bizarre characters. Despite the somewhat flimsy premise of an afterlife where the dead influence the living through dreams - good guys, good dreams; bad guys, bad dreams - the storyline is otherwise original and compelling.  Ink, the title character, a tortured and scarred monstrosity, in an act of desperation, tears a child's spirit from her sleeping body as an offering to a clutch of ingeniously imagined incubi in exchange for promised oblivion. Arrayed against this plan is a crew of disparate spirits, loosely lead by the lovely and enigmatic Storyteller (Jessica Duffy). The captured child, Emma, is not your average victim; she is a self-possessed and resourceful little girl who controls her fears and never truly surrenders to her captor. The young actress who plays Emma, Quinn Hunchar, is talented beyond her years and somehow manages to be little-girlishly charming without being cloying cute. The actor who plays Emma's father, Chris Kelly, does a superb job of portraying all the depth and subtlety of a success-poisoned lost soul tormented by insecurity and guilt.

That's what I always hope for, but seldom find. Ink has taken a rare place as one of my all-time favorite movies.

The only reason viewers may even object to this characterization is that, for all its complaints about Christianity, our culture has already been so Christianized that we think the values we cheer in this movie are ""normal"" or ""universal.""

A fantastical and moving look at spiritual warfare, idolatry and what's important in life. There's even a Christ-figure for good measure. I'm not saying that's the moviemakers' intent, but I am saying that's what they produced :D despite some ""language."" I'm serious, I would recommend showing this to any 13+ Sunday School class for intense discusssion.

P.S. You don't have to be a Christian to enjoy this movie. It's got interesting visuals, interesting ideas, and is generally done well. But some of the parallels are too strong to ignore. However, don't worry that you or your little ones will somehow be ""converted"" by it. As I said, the themes in it are now pretty much part of our culture.",1258329600,6,1024,4.84
3948077,4,B002LFPBOM,"I give this 4 stars out of 5 only for the initial, admittedly slow beginning. But once it picks up, this is an amazing movie.

Without being too spoilerish, there are so many layers going on here that, while completely entwined to the viewer, are thus kept almost entirely separate from the characters involved in the story. Each thread could almost work on its own as a whole story (up until the end where it all fits together), but running parallel as they do they artfully reverberate off each other, making an extremely rich narrative.

Another thing I loved about this movie is how in most cases, not *everything* is explained. Certainly, there are necessary pieces of exposition, but in most cases they are expressed necessarily in simple terms a child can understand (you'll see what I mean), allowing for a broad interpretation and allowing the audience to fill-in the blanks of this ""universe"" as they see fit; showing not telling.

As a side comment: I commented to my friend that this story and its character archetypes could easily be translated into the core book for a role-playing game. Fellow gamers who see this might agree with me.

Yes, the acting in some cases isn't as polished as a mainline production, but the main characters are portrayed very strongly and memorably. The visuals, editing, and overall production of the film is above par for many independent productions of this type, and (imo) many big-budget Hollywood films.

3948079,4,B002LFPBOM,"Ink (2009) is a climax of audio and visual stimulation that takes you on a journey of the subconsciousness. The dark and light forces fight over the soul in a thrilling and thought provoking metaphysical world that is linked to the physical one. This science fiction fantasy is packed with action between mesmerizing sequences of relaxation and happiness that offset the dark and uneasy world of the Incubi.

The Incubi give nightmares while the Storytellers offer dreams of hope. These two groups battle for Emma (Quinn Hunchar) in this alternate realm, where time runs differently, as she lays in a coma in the real world after Ink took her essence to prove his worthiness to become an Incubi. Her only hope is for the Storytellers to change the path of her father, John (Chris Kelly). A series of events changed John from a loving and caring person to a deeply hurt and broken man. With the quest to change John underway another Storyteller, Liev (Jessica Duffy), attempts to adjust Ink's thinking to not continue following the path he is on.

8 out of 10 - A strait forward and simple tale this is not; it is open to some interpretation making the film difficult to follow at times. It does come together more as the film advances, but in the end it may take some nonlinear thinking to understand. Still, this is a very interesting and mind blowing film that intrigues your senses and perception. The acting was fitting for the film, but could be considered a little flat. Jamin Winans, Kiowa K. Winans, and Jeff Pointer created this unique and intriguing story.

3948081,5,B002LFPBOM,"Though this movie is wonderful, if you order it here and now, even if you are to choose 2 day shipping and pay for that option, you will not see your movie until late november/early december. so don't even bother. and when you call to say that you don't think you should be charged for the promised earlier shipping date, you will be transferred to an individual in another country who can barely speak english. very frustrating. so although i give the movie five stars,  give amazon's service negative stars.",1258243200,2,509,4.655555555555556
3948082,5,B002LFPBOM,"This film blends everything that is perfect about the scifi/fantasy genre. Everything about this film is so unique and beatiful- from the captivating story and cinematography to the film score. It's hard to believe this movie started out with no budget.

The film is about two forces agianst each other, as typical with many movies, good vs evil, the forces of light vs the incubi respectively. The forces of light give the world good dreams, while the incubi give nightmares. One day a girl is kidnapped by a mysterious evil named Ink, and the forces of light must go after her, as her father wallows away in depression.

Every frame in this movie is astounding on a visual level. The best part is really the color scheme and overtones. The colors of the movie represent all the different emotions the characters experience. Sepia represents peacefulness/happiness, darkness is dark blue/green, etc... The performances are strong, and the action is mind blowing. The dark look and tone of this film is something very special. Chris Kelly is wonderful as the father in this film. There's an extra on the dvd where he's interviewing the actress who plays the little girl which is very touching.

The only flaw with this film is there is one scene where the dialogue makes me cringe, specifically between one of the heroes and the pathfinder. But luckily it's only 1 minute of the film.

This movie is not for everyone. It's for the crowd that enjoy a lot of style and weird pacing. It has a good story, and it will definitely go over well with a mix between the Donnie Darko/Dark City crowd. This is one of my favorite films. In my opinion it's a lot better than Donnie Darko, which is another movie I enjoy, but feel it lacks a good twist. This movie is not so about a twist, but telling a compelling story which keeps the movie goer interested. It suceeds on this level. Some may find there are surprising momemts though.

*A quick thing to note is that I found out about this from the Franklyn page on amazon. This movie is much better than that one, but I still enjoy that one. Apparently this has been downloaded 400000 times in the past few days.",1258156800,2,2151,4.605744125326371
3948083,5,B002LFPBOM,"I really enjoyed this movie for many reasons. First, it has a story that makes you think and ask questions about life and reality. I honestly did not notice that it was an independent film. The direction was amazing and the film techniques used are visually stunning. The actors did an impressive job as well. I rarely post reviews but I was horrified to see a couple people writing bad reviews. Anyone who appreciates art films and likes movies that make you think, you will love this film. I highly recommend seeing it and will watch it several more times myself.",1258156800,3,565,4.603960396039604
8372745,1,B002LFPBOM,Got to watch for 'free' with my Amazon Prime and still one of the worst movies I've ever seen.  Too many cringe-worthy moments.  Audience too ham-fistedly told what to think about the characters.  I could tell where this was headed from the opening scenes.  I felt embarrassed for the actors; poor folk must've really needed the money bad.  The whole neo-fantasy drama playing out within a modern metropolitan backdrop is so played out!  What a pile!,1528502400,,450,4.855263157894737
8372746,5,B002LFPBOM,"This is a must-see film if you like anime, or The Crow, or Jacob's Ladder, to splatter across several genres.  A wonderful, new mythos is the backdrop for a charming story of struggle for redemption.",1528329600,,199,4.685714285714286
8372747,5,B002LFPBOM,"I'm a guy who likes Payback, the Crow, Braveheart, Nightbreed, the Empire Strikes Back, Jacob's Ladder the Outlaw Josey Wales as some of my other top favourites. Somehow, this low budget film of unknown actors became my favourite film of all time. I'm a white male who will openly confess my Christianity to the world and I don't see the ""liberal bias"" the naysayers are prescribing to this movie. I don't understand why this movie challenges their masculinity and makes them think it's part of some agenda. They are completely missing the point of the movie if they're focusing on a few small details to fit their own mindset. It's a great story of redemption and I'm sorry that some people got offended that the first three words are F-bombs. Yeah, the main character is facing a lot of inner demons and has some rough things happen in his life. Some are self-imposed mistakes that imperfect human beings can make and the other being the kind of tragic events that can sink the best of people. It's a movie about redemption and fighting your own darkness. There are very few movies that can make me cry and I'm talking the Brian's Song type movies that will make the toughest of men get a little misty eyed and the ending of this movie has had tears streaming down my face. I've only seen the main actor in two other movies and he's always given a good performance, but I just relate to this character more than I'd like to admit. I first watched a movie on Amazon Prime, but I quickly bought it on Blu-ray to show my support for this kind of filmmaking. I've seen the director's other movie the Frame and this director has made me a fan out of just two films. Don't just take the word of the negative reviews and actually watch it with an open mind to make your own decisions. The guy writing this review is someone who loves the Evil Dead series and watches everything from Jean-Claude Van Damme movies to Jean-Pierre Juenet artsy type films. Just watch it and make your own decision. I watch it almost once a month.",1527897600,,2020,4.491847826086956
8372748,5,B002LFPBOM,"This is what film should be.  Visually stunning, mysterious, character driven amalgamation of genres to a complex cohesive conclussion. Blown away!  Should definately of heard of the director by now but for some reason not.  Hope he can make another wonderful story for us to enjoy.  Would love another wonderous adventure!",1527465600,,323,5.2745098039215685
8372749,5,B002LFPBOM,"Ink is a fantastic movie, period!  The writing, directing, acting...everything is very well done.  The tension and emotion it captures is great.  As others have said, this isn't a background movie, it's a dim the lights and get lost in the story, which is very powerful :)",1526342400,,272,4.74468085106383
8372750,5,B002LFPBOM,"This was an incredible, unexpected recommended buy from Amazon. It popped up while I was browsing other movies and I almost never impulse buy, especially on the internet, but it sounded interesting and it remains to this day one of the most treasured purchases I've ever made. It's a one-of-a-kind, imaginative little indie project with highly-effective visuals and smart story-telling that I show off to friends and recommend all the time with the most immediate, common consensus being that they've never seen anything like it and they're so glad they got to experience it.",1526256000,,575,5.127659574468085
8372751,5,B002LFPBOM,"No matter how many times I watch this movie, it still brings a tear to my eye.  Ink acknowledging ""I am ruined, why can't you see that"" and what happens afterwards, I can't believe many people (men and women) don't have similar moments in their lives like that, and can only pray for the redemption offered through the storyteller.",1526169600,,331,4.610169491525424
8372752,5,B002LFPBOM,"Probably my all time favorite movie.  Very cerebral.  Beautiful in so many ways - morally uplifting, emotionally impacting, thought provoking.",1521763200,,142,6.05
8372753,3,B002LFPBOM,"Entertaining, though a bit ackward in parts - plays like a ""first effort"" by this director",1520640000,,90,4.6875
8372754,4,B002LFPBOM,Different. Critic is still out for this one.,1519171200,,44,4.625
