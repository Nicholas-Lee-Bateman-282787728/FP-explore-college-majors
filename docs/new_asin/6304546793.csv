896170,3,6304546793,"A good film. Very good acting of the whole cast and very good cinematography, the white houses and the black dresses, etc., but a little too much overblown and overwritten. The ""message"" is sometimes not very subtle (the ""carabineri"" putting his hand over the map of Sicily an shaking his head, the nightmares of Sandrelli, etc.). Besides, there is no Mastroianni.",1231459200,4,364,4.983606557377049
896171,5,6304546793,"Black comedy skewers Sicilian mores with a sharp cinematic knife, making ""Seduced"" by turns funny and tragic. Agnese, the central object of all the fuss, is maltreated throughout, but the beautiful Sandrelli strikes the right balance so that our sympathies for her don't overwhelm the film's broadly humorous tone. Though the ferret-like Puglisi is tailor-made for the unsympathetic role of Peppino, this is truly Urzi's film. His volcanic Don Vincenzo serves as comic center-piece and driving force behind the whole tumultuous affair. An unbridled satiric masterpiece from director Germi.",1182988800,6,589,5.629213483146067
896172,5,6304546793,"This movie is hilarious and entertaining as can be! I loved ""Divorce Italian Style"" by Pietro Germi so I took the risk of buying ""Seduced and Abandoned"" from Criterion without ever seeing it. In my opinion I actually enjoyed it more than Divorce Italian Style! I won't repeat the plot again but the movie definitly brings you into their family. Once your sucked in it turns into a hilarious nail biter taking unexpected turns and twists. Very memorable movie I highly recommend purchasing for repeated viewings!",1160956800,15,511,4.953488372093023
896173,3,6304546793,"This is a worthwhile movie for those interested in Sicilian culture.  It shows the absurdity and barbarism of their social habits, or at least the way it was years ago.  It's hard to sympathize with those backward morals.  It reminds in a way of Divorce, Italian Style, and other movies made on the subject.  It is an interesting movie.",1004918400,4,336,4.6440677966101696

896248,5,6304546793,"""Seduced and Abandoned"" was Pietro Germi, the intensely hard-working and intelligent director (and  actor) who basically created the genre of ""Commedia all'Italiana"" which extended from Italian neo-Realism to depict problems with the morals and mores of Italian politics and society through the guise of a black and sometimes grotesque tragi-comedy.  He began with great success with 1962's ""Divorce Italian Style"" which had the great presence of Marcello Mastroianni, but Germi follow-up, 1964's ""Seduced and Abandoned"" had an even better performance in Saro Urzi who plays the patriarchal head of the family at a a time when ""Family and Honor"" meant everything to him, and daughter ""Agnesse"" played by Stefania Sandrelli, who is seduced and abandoned by her sister's fiance for one night, opening up new insight into Italy's antiquated laws once again about how men, and especially then, how women were looked upon to behave about sex and marriage, etc.  Everything about ""Seduced and Abandoned"" is exemplary of excellence, problems with ""Divorce, Italian Style"" made better, so that, ""Seduced and Abandoned"" may be the lesser known, but all around the better, more satisfying motion picture.  The original story is by Pietro Germi and Luciano Vincenzoni with brilliant cinematography by Aiace Parolin and costume design by Carlo Egidi.  The entire cast is brilliant, even down the expertly picked faces by Germi in the scenes employing extras, purposely done by Germi to depict similarly grotesque renderings of famous paintings he admired.  Urzi won many awards and nominations for his role, and Germi stuck by the less known actor than some suggestions for casting the producers had saying if Urzi could not play the part, he would not make the film.  It is a magnificent performance, and so integral to the story, that some of Urzi prizes were for supporting actor.  In addition to Sandrelli as the jilted girl, Aldo Puglisi is ""Peppino"""" the scoundrel, Lando Buzzanca as ""Antonio"" the older brother, Paola Biggio as ""Mathilde"" the sister whose fiance strays from her and Oreste Palella as Police Chief Polenza who is constantly humorously trying to imagine Italy without Sicily in relation to it any longer because of the way the people behaved.  This Criterion Collection presentation is excellent, with numerous extras including interviews, screen tests, trailer, booklet, etc.  This black-and-white film in Italian with English subtitles shows that good effort into a follow-up can pay off when one uses their intelligence and creativity imaginatively.",1376697600,3,2562,5.350746268656716
896249,5,6304546793,I have seen this film twice now.  Hysterical satire.  Great performances.  I am looking forward to watching other Germi films,1358208000,,125,5.15
896250,5,6304546793,"Having been smitten by the Italian Invasion--films starring the Diva/Goddesses, from Magnani, Loren, Viti, Sandrelli,  Cardinale, (and consequently married into a big Sicilian-Amerigagni tribe) I'm hardly ""objective"", but I think this, and ""
Big Deal on Madonna Street"" are a couple of the most brilliant farces ever concocted as films. I can't think of many other films that reveal a peoples' wonderful capacity to laugh, so insightfully, at their ""foibles"". See them, and see what I mean.",1351555200,,490,5.363636363636363
896251,4,6304546793,"A delightfully satirical film! Germi explores an antiquated law that eradicates rape if the parties marry. Peppino doesn't want to marry Agnese because she is no longer virginal: ""The man has the right to ask; the woman has a duty to refuse."" But, why would Agnese want to marry her seducer? Chaos ensues in defense of family and honor.",1280707200,,336,4.711864406779661
896252,5,6304546793,"An adolescent girl (Stefania Sandrelli) is seduced and impregnated by the wormy fiancee (Aldo Puglisi) of her sister (Paolo Biggio).  When her father, a minor Sicilian aristocrat (Saro Urzi) demands that said fiancee marry her, he refuses to marry ""damaged goods.""  Thus begins an epic battle of wills that pretty much ruins the lives of everyone involved.  It's a comedy . . .

And what a comedy--not just the brilliant script, which director Pietro Germi co-wrote with the great comedy-writing team of Age and Scarpelli and Luciano Vincenzoni, but the explosively funny performances he gets from his cast, most importantly Sandrelli as the tough-as-nails heroine, Puglisi as the fiancee from hell, and Urzi as her ghastly but well-meaning father.  They are beautifully supported by Lando Buzzanca as Sandrelli's galoot of a brother and Leopoldo Trieste as the impoverished major aristocrat that Dad tries to set up as the new fiancee for the older sister.  You will laugh constantly, but the laughs will mostly come out of the wrong side of your mouth, and the final scenes are both completely logical and quietly devastating.  And you'll still be laughing.  The story that Germi was telling, as in his previous masterpiece, DIVORCE ITALIAN STYLE, is grim indeed, and needed to be told.  But rather than self-righteous polemics, we get withering, bases-clearing satire.  Which proved to be the perfect approach.",1278633600,8,1413,5.185022026431718
896253,5,6304546793,"This is a great movie. It is very funny and extremely tragic at the same time. Both features don't contradict, but support each other.",1236816000,2,134,4.625
896254,4,6304546793,"The challenge of ""Seduced and Abandoned"" is met at the very beginning.  Everything happens because the leading young lady is is seduced by her sister's fiancee.  Since she is not yet 16, this really should not be funny but, if you accept what has happened then you will be able to enjoy what happens throughout the rest of the movie.  ""Seduced and Abandoned"" is many things; a comedy of errors, a satire on Sicilian society, the double-standard between the sexes, and more.  This really IS a funny movie and it excels in humor because of the sterotyped characters that range from the bombastic father to the timid brother and everything in between.  The ending IS a bit odd but I guess that's in keeping with the beginning.  I enjoyed watching ""Seduced and Abandoned"".",1233446400,2,768,4.7368421052631575
7873778,5,6304546793,"This is a not a comedy, although, it is presented as one. This is an way of life for a village and a people.  It is more tragic than it is humorous.  It is about the values of a family.  Each member of the family brings honor or disgrace to a family.  Honor and disgrace is determined by the norms of a given culture and the group in that culture. This is the tale of family living in a culture whose norms are determined by the group.  What someone outside of the culture sees as humorous, those who live and share the values of that culture will find the outcome tragic.  In this film, when you remove the mask of comedy, you begin to see and wear the mask of tragedy.  To find this film to be a comedy is a real tragedy.",1470787200,2,723,4.013986013986014
7873779,3,6304546793,"I saw this when it was first released and never laughed so hard or so much watching a movie.
I was so excited to find it again. Either it has become dated, or my taste has changed drastically.
I still enjoyed it, and had a few laughs, but it fizzled a few times, and I found myself frequently checking to see how much more time 'til it was over.
Despite all that, the performances were all right on, and the characters well drawn.
Worth a watch, no matter.",1470787200,,456,4.193181818181818

7873786,4,6304546793,"""Seduced and Abandoned"" is a bitter and dark, yet comedic look at Italian Post World War II society. The performances are excellent and there are some very funny moments. A woman's virginity is taken and hijinks ensue as the family tries desperately to keep its honor. While I don't find this to be Germi's finest hour, it's still worth viewing and an interesting look at International cultures.",1432252800,,395,4.91044776119403
