But this version doesn't play in US players, and yet, the description clearly said it would work. SO disappointing. I was looking forward to sharing it with my daughter and her friends. Would be an awesome discussion starter.
And its just really well acted/written/produced too.",1421107200,,384,4.833333333333333
8601420,5,B009Q6CBGU,"Very funny and insightful.  It is cringeworthy but that is to be expected.  We all went through the agonies of puberty, although perhaps not quite as promiscuously as this bunch.  But it definitely highlights the consequences of peer pressure and wanting to fit in at any cost.  Useful at any age but especially useful now as my daughter hits age 13!",1370649600,,350,4.688524590163935
