8160412,5,B000L9WN00,This is a another  most entertaining  story by  Agatha  Christie,1445904000,,64,5.1
8160413,3,B000L9WN00,"The movie I own is part of the Poirot Collection of 28 disks which was produced for Europe and needs DVD players adapted for the PAL system.

While most of the characters of the novel are present, too many changes were incorporated.  It is a mystery (sorry for the pun) to me how people who want to make a film of a novel because they like it then go ahead and change it almost beyond recognition.

What bothered me more was the fact that in the bonus feature ""Behind the Scenes"" one of the writers admitted to having taken a lot of ""liabilities"" with the original.  This was a person who gets paid for writing, and he does not know that what they had taken were ""liberties,"" not liabilities. How can you expect a good movie written by such people?

If you buy the movie in a US version, you may not get this so-called bonus feature and won't know what I am talking about.",1370736000,,872,4.260606060606061

Agatha Christie mysteries have become classics and only her last work wasn't great. This movie is part of series of films involving the Belgian
detective. He has always seemed kind of greasy to me?
Here wealthy Americans are mingling with the international crowd on a French train, and murder erupts and ignites the scene.",1234656000,,591,7.0
