3597776,5,B001G7Q186,"If you're a fan of the Planet of the Apes movie series, you will be very pleased at the blu-ray transition.  This campy delight really pops with blu-ray.  I watched it on a 58 inch plasma, and it lost very little crispness.  I was too young to see it first run at theaters, but I'll bet this experience rivals that one.  In fact, it's so clear, you'll no doubt see things you never saw when watching it on standard TV.  I never noticed the masks on some of the ""extra"" apes were much less detailed.  Some had black orbs where their star counterparts had eyes.  No doubt a budget issue back then.

If you've never seen the original Planet of the Apes movie, but only the more recent remake, you will probably chuckle at this one.  But the rendering of the city buildings is brilliant, it seems to take a chapter straight out of the Flintstones, and bring it to life.  Owning the blu-ray is a bit like owning a piece of history, since it's been the forerunner to so many science fiction stories.  Though the movie drips with tongue-in-cheek sillyness, Charlton Heston still belts out a memorable performance, with his incredulous stares and absolute distain for the apes.  This film is a cult classic, and blu-ray does it proud.  Two thumbs up!",1230076800,7,1242,4.515695067264574
3597777,5,B001G7Q186,"I was very impressed at the quality of this transfer.  Very sharp, with close ups of Charlton Heston and other characters.  Not sure if they used the transfer to make the ape costumes look more genuine.  If not, then kudos to the makeup men who did the ape costume because in HD transfer you really cannot tell these are masks and not actual living creatures.

Loved this purchase!",1229904000,,381,4.5588235294117645
3597778,5,B001G7Q186,"I may be a bit biased, having authored the MAKING OF book on the APES series ,PLANET OF THE APES REVISITED, however that doesn't alter the facts. This is THE best presentation of PLANET OF THE APES ever done for home video---in fact all the APES blu-ray masterings are superior to their dvd counterparts. This is one of the most classic films ever, especialy in the sci-fi genre, and on virtually every level, it holds up extraordinarily well and has a fresh atmosphere even 40 years after it's release. I would say the APES blu-ray set is worth entering the format if you are enough of an APES afficianado. They look amazing.",1229817600,9,626,4.598214285714286
3597779,5,B001G7Q186,"Movie-wise, it's still a classic and always will be.  The new Blu-ray is beatuiful--the film looks like it was shot yesterday, not 40 years ago!  My greatest fear was that the hi-def picture would make the the make-up look phony, but it still looks convincing even in the unforgiving detail of high definition.",1229385600,6,310,4.830188679245283
3597780,4,B001G7Q186,"A very good blu-ray version, equal to the past sdvd gift box version. Far superior to the the remake and worth the look. The opening is still tops in my estimation. Rare to see such a great use of Panavision  that today's films certainly lack.",1229385600,,243,4.4
3597781,3,B001G7Q186,"Of course the movie is one of my favorites.  This is strictly about the BD transfer, which is mediocre.  Very grainy and not overly sharp in detail.  Colors are somewhat washed out.  Some of this may have been the director's choice.  But it detracts from the blu-ray in the sense that it is not loads better than the DVD.

For those that haven't seen the movie, shame on you.  The movie is a classic; just the transfer I am not enthralled with.",1229212800,5,444,4.341463414634147
3597782,3,B001G7Q186,"This is a review of the quality of the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Planet-of-the-Apes-Blu-ray/dp/B001G7Q186/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Planet of the Apes [Blu-ray</a>. The video looks good for a film as aged as this, but is not even close to stunning. The high def transfer in some cases actually serves to accentuate problems you might not have noticed otherwise. I saw more than a few soft scenes where they looked unfocused. Grain was never too obtrusive, but the colors were uneven through a good portion of the film. Some scenes were rich and vivid, and others washed out. My biggest problem is the sound. They present the sound here as a DTS 5.1 mix, and a mono mix. I chose DTS and was sorely dissapointed. My subwoofer never kicked on. That means that there was never an instance when there was a frequency lower than about 85hz. This made for a very shallow sounding mix. Adding to that, the surround speakers never seemed to register anything, and you've got what sounded to me like a mono mix anyway. All of the sound seemed to come from my center channel. To me, digitally remastering a film soundtrack at this level means accentuating the lower registries by adding lower frequencies, and placing atmospheric and musical elements in the surround channels. If you don't plan on doing that, what's the use of calling it a DTS 5.1 mix? Anyway, this is by far the best transfer I've ever seen of the film, but don't be looking for anything more than a slightly better than average transfer, and a glorified mono track.",1226448000,86,1574,5.0344827586206895

3597784,5,B001G7Q186,"I remember seeing this when it when it opened in 1968 as I was just 16. The ending was completely unexpected! Most of the audence gasped in shock then sat in silence from the ending scene.

The movie is based on the book written by Pierre Boulle in 1963 of the same name. The book differs considerably from any of the movies. I read the book sometime while I was at Indiana State University  - either the fall of 1970 or spring of 1971. I found the book better in some ways and worse in others. The movie script was partially written By Rod Serling of Twilight Zone fame which help explain the big twisted ending!

Picture was superb and sound was great. Price was very low and the movie arrived very quickly in perfect shape. Acting is pretty good and direction (IMHO) was also very good.

This movie is simply a classic - one that almost everyone should see once!

I would rate this a very, very high 9.5 to 9.75 - just short of a perfect movie!!

VERY HIGHLY RECOMMENED!!!",1410652800,9,975,4.329670329670329

3597787,5,B001G7Q186,"As with most franchise movies, the first one is the best. Planet of the Apes with Charlton Heston is fantastic. Throw in Linda Harrison as the doe eyed mute cheesecake called Nova, and it's magic. The blue ray disc comes with lots of extras and is super clear and crisp. Especially the wide angle landscape shots when our astronaut team crash lands. But let's get back to Nova. Despite the makeup and wardrobe dept. attempt to give the impression that she hasn't bathed in a month, she's still a knockout. Best of the ape movies.",1402444800,,529,4.578947368421052

3597789,5,B001G7Q186,"This is one of the ""must see"" movies of all time...if you have somehow missed it til now, don't let anyone reveal the ending before you watch it.  Appeals to men and women, and children old enough to think.  Good quality blu-ray.",1395878400,,229,4.428571428571429
3597790,3,B001G7Q186,"The overall picture quality is just OK. I'm comparing this to the Blu Rays I've just seen of older Heston films: 'The Ten Commandments' & 'Ben-Hur'. There's a weird computer animated Lawgiver at the beginning of the disc introducing the film, which makes it seem like it's for a kid's movie. (The actor voicing this was trying to imitate John Huston from 'Battle for the Planet of the Apes', and sounds a bit like Richard Nixon in places, instead.) There's a game you can play as the movie runs, which is ideal for viewers with ADD, and a strange newsreel-type short about astronauts Taylor, Dodge, Landon and Stewart and their mission. The AMC documentary on the Apes series is very lo-rez. There is an interesting behind-the-scenes home-movie feature shot by actor Roddy McDowall showing him in the process of being made up as Cornelius, as well as off-camera footage of actors, crew, and sets that's worth looking at, and short interviews with scientists about the real science behind the film. Also included is a featurette on the merchandising campaign (toys, games, comic books, etc) from the early 70's. I'm not blown away by this presentation. That being said, this is still one of my favorite movies, and it holds up really well, due to a great script and solid acting.",1387843200,,1278,4.8136363636363635
3597791,5,B001G7Q186,Nice to finally have this classic movie on Blu-ray. As all blurays the added picture quality is the reason to buy this one.,1382140800,,123,4.391304347826087

3597794,5,B001G7Q186,"By modern standards, the acting is stiff, especially Heston. The make-up and effects can be laughable. The spaceship interior and crash scene is lacking.  But the story is pure gold.  An intelligent and provocative film, ""The Planet Of The Apes"" spends much more time with cerebral thrills than straightout action, which I believe is why it still packs a punch more than 50 years later.  Philosophy, religion, science and technology war with human drama in this film like no other.  I have to rate it 6 out of 5 stars.",1362009600,,518,4.722222222222222
3597795,5,B001G7Q186,"Great storyline and plot.  The wardrobe, make up, costumes, and sets are very good for a movie made back in the 60s. The cast of actors is great! This is a classic movie to own, and its quality entertainment for the family. Movies like this make you stop and think about the future of mankind on a serious level.  The sound quality is very good, with beautiful cinematography. Buy it on Blue Ray. Thanks.",1356566400,,404,4.445945945945946

3597797,5,B001G7Q186,"Planet of the Apes is BEAUTIFUL on Blu-ray! The picture quality is really gorgeous and it is hard to imagine any standard DVD version coming close. Sound is likewise excellent.

Now we come to the incredible amount of extras.

First up is a commentary consisting of Kim Hunter, Roddy McDowall, Natalie Trundy, and John Chambers. Regretfully, this is disappointing because it happens so seldom during the film that it could have been eliminated altogether. Incredibly long gaps without a word.

There is also a commentary by composer Jerry Goldsmith, and he is heard over many scenes. Plus, there is a text commentary by an author of a book about the Planet of the Apes, but it is sparse throughout the film.

Among the other features are several shorts, including a makeup test scene with Edward G. Robinson as Dr. Zaius and Charlton Heston, with James Brolin as Cornelius and Linda Harrison as Zira (she would later play Nova in the first two films). There are about a dozen shorts, about half in high definition.

The highlight of the extras is an excellent documentary, in standard defnition, hosted by Roddy McDowall entitled ""Behind the Planet of the Apes,"" which runs just over 2 hours and covers all the films, the TV series, and the cartoon. The Tim Burton-directed Planet of the Apes came out some time after this special, so there is no mention of it.

All this material, including the wonderful high definition movie is on one Blu-ray disc, and is a definite buy for the classic film fan.",1356307200,2,1499,4.768339768339768
3597798,4,B001G7Q186,"I absolutely loved this film, but the mastering was not up to snuff. The so-called ""lawgiver"" version is nothing more than bad CGI clip at the start of the movie. Skip it.",1355961600,,171,4.375
3597799,2,B001G7Q186,"Franklin J. Schaffner has directed some of the most magnificent looking movies ever (Patton, Papillion, Islands in the Stream, etc) and I was excited to see the Blu-ray treatment given to arguably his most famous film Planet of the Apes.  Sadly, this one misses the boat.
The colors are faded and not dynamic in the least and, to be honest, it looks less than I would expect from a standard DVD release.
To make matters worse, I know there are loads of features and additional Planet of the Apes material out there and this disc has none of it save for some decent commentary from some of the stars.
Wait until a better treatment comes out.",1353628800,,640,4.517241379310345
3597800,5,B001G7Q186,The original movie is the best and having it in Blu-Ray makes it even nicer; it looks and sounds brand new!,1353283200,,107,4.142857142857143

3597802,5,B001G7Q186,"Four United States astronauts travel to a strange planet where highly intelligent humanoid apes with the power of speech rule the world. The apes are physically the sizes of various different types of humans, they speak English, and with the exception of one ape, they all have North-American accents.

As far as their technology goes, they have no electricity and they use horses as means of transportation. The main metropolis is called ""Ape City"" and looks like an 1880's U.S. Wild Western town.

All the human beings on the planet are unintelligent and primitive Caucasian savages who live out in the wild, can't talk and wear animal-skinned clothing like how cavemen on earth use to dress. Additionally, they are hunted and killed for sport by gorillas, while others are captured and are then placed in cages at laboratories so they can be studied by chimpanzees.

What I find appealing about this film is that it's a highly entertaining satire of human behavior.

What lead me into watching it is that I had watched and enjoyed a trailer for another movie - ""Rise of the Planet of the Apes"". I knew it was rebooting the ""Planet of the Apes"" series, and I was looking forward to watching the film, but I also decided that it was time to watch the original ""Planet of the Apes"" because I had only heard of it, but had never watched it.

So I viewed ""Planet of the Apes"" last summer, knowing little about it beforehand. I thought the original ""Planet of the Apes"" was amazing. One of the greatest motion pictures ever made and it has become one of my favorite films.",1327881600,4,1569,4.649819494584838

3597804,5,B001G7Q186,"This is a great movie, but I am not going to go into that. Instead, I want to give you a little bit about the Blu-ray quality. It is a nice clean conversion - I didn't see any noise, but I don't know if it is a direct copy from a master or if they cleaned it up at all. The colors are probably as good as you will get for a 1968 film. I thought the black levels were pretty good and solid. It's a good transfer, but not as good as 2001: A Space Odyssey, which to me, is a standard for the era as far as Blu-ray transfers goes.

The audio is disappointing because they claim 5.1 surround sound and I didn't notice any surround effect at all. They fell short on this aspect. 20th Century Fox should have taken the time and put some effort into remastering the sound mix.

Overall, you will not be disappointed in getting the Blu-ray version.",1324857600,5,839,4.078787878787879

3597807,4,B001G7Q186,"Although rarely if ever mentioned whenever sci-fi classics are discussed, ""Planet of the Apes"" deserves a place on the same pedestal as Classic Trek, Forbidden Planet and even Kubrick's 2001 as an original and very thought-provoking story that also serves as a great social satire for the times i.e. U.S. in the late 60s.  This blu-ray version certainly does not let the great content down as the picture quality although not perfect still looks very good in 1080p despite the fact that there are a few poorly preserved frames here and there throughout the film.  The sound quality though in DTS HD MA 5.1 surround is very good albeit the mostly front heavy nature of the original source means we don't get to fully appreciate this audio option.  The special features are good but not great but overall this is the best version of this great film that is currently out there.

Being a big fan of Rod Serling and his Twilight Zone series I could see the Serling influence in the screenplay which he co-wrote; certainly the surprise ending is truly Twilight Zonish in nature not to mention the satirical references to prevailing social issues of the time which is another Zone trademark.  This is a great film but the many follow-up sequels are not and they fall far short of the brilliance that this the original film achieves.

No sci-fi film buff should be without this film in their video library and this blu-ray release is currently the best version of the film that is out there.  Get this but ignore the sequels.

Now after that radical statement I know different media calls for different handling of the story. And most movies do not live up to the book. However some exceed the book. Surprise this is the ""don't live up to the book"" one. If you thought that the movie was insightful, surprising and shocking the first time you saw it. Then you defiantly have lower expectations than the reader does. Especially with such a botched ending; the ending changed the whole purpose and mystery of the story.

I did like the idea of having a movie where the woman was not talking all the time. (Just kidding) And the makeup for the simians was excellent. I suppose if you haven't read the book that this would be a pleasant time passer.
