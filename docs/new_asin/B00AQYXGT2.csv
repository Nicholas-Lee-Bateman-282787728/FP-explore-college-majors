5474095,3,B00AQYXGT2,"Star at the top of her career, sliding to obscurity, trying to get back on top, sliding further down, struggling to rise at the expense of herself and others.  Does she make it?  I guess that depends on how you view making it.  I thought the actors put some decent performances out there, but, oh my gosh, it was looong.  Not sure if the story warranted a 2 hr 25 min scope.  I will say I was invested enough to watch till the end.",1388448000,,431,4.083333333333333

5474097,5,B00AQYXGT2,"This film is based on true story of heroines (actresses) inside the film industry which audiences don't know. Should watch this film to know about how heroines are treated and how bollywood works by politics inside behind the curtains. Must watch this one, its fun movie...",1365638400,,273,4.956521739130435
5474098,3,B00AQYXGT2,"Bhandarkar films are collages and vignettes about particular topics that are carefully pieced together skillfully as highs and lows in a cinematic show. The Bhandarkar method carefully displayed the life of bar dancers ( Chandni Bar) to a depressing but still magical effect and not so great but still good in Page 3 and Corporate.
In Heroine, Bhandarkar pieces life of a starlet at the crossroads of her career. She is still at the top but the baggage of broken home, bad relationships and emerging competition has begun to catch up with her. She crazy in love with a married guy ( Arjun Rampal) who is afraid to commit and insists on secrecy about their affair. Problems snowball and life becomes messier for bipolar heroine. She clings to stardom and even dabbles with feminine love ala Shahana Goswami, falls in love with a cricketer, so many things happen but the movie does not pack a punch.
Kareena Kapoor is beautiful and performs with style. She has the desperation that is needed as well in many key scenes. Divya Dutta is sneaky and amazing. Ranvir Shorey as the maverick director was over the top and over acted... The Shahana Goswami track was the most well acted.
Heroine is another watchable fare from Bhandarkar, it is not as good as his earlier films but still passes as decent entertainment. 3 stars . 1/16/2013",1358899200,3,1329,4.757575757575758

5474142,2,B00AQYXGT2,Ordinary portrayal of the struggles and choices for an actress...the screenplay has a dark undertone throughout without painting a balanced view,1429315200,,144,5.904761904761905

5474148,4,B00AQYXGT2,"Movie was a bit blend. I kept on looking for something more. I was hoping she'd snap some sense into herself. Kareena Kapoor was very convincing in her acting. I for one felt really bad for her. However, ""Fashion"" was better. At least, the character in that movie managed to rise back to the top without losing her soul completely. She didn't let the industry beat her down, as for Mahi, let her new fame send her crashing down to a point where she found no satisfaction in reaching the top. Rather than feel the fame, she felt remorse and shame. I gave this movie three stars -3 for Kareena's performance and 1 for the movie.",1420329600,,626,4.405172413793103

5474161,4,B00AQYXGT2,Main reason behind my rating is the performance of Kareena Kapoor. She is good as usual. The movie is OK.. basically like Fashion but about actors instead of models. I also loved Shahana Goswami in her brief role. She is such a warm actor.,1415664000,,239,4.454545454545454

5474164,2,B00AQYXGT2,Poor film with very predictable story line. Expected more out of the director with such a reputation. The two stars are for Kareena's performance.,1413244800,,146,5.125
5474165,2,B00AQYXGT2,"The movie is just ok; Kareena did good role as usual but with the poor story and over reach of media make movie baseless. If i was a director, I could make the outcome very different.",1411171200,,183,4.111111111111111
5474166,5,B00AQYXGT2,Good movie if you like the lead actor Kareena - nothing spectacular or extraordinary - typical masala Bollywood film.,1410393600,,117,5.2105263157894735

5474192,2,B00AQYXGT2,"A poor script and with it some overacting ruined the movie for me. Madhur Bhandarkar, guess lost it in this one. His 'Fashion' was far more superlative.",1403568000,,152,4.666666666666667

5474195,4,B00AQYXGT2,"If you want to see Kareena Kapoor do some real acting, this is the movie for you.

5474197,5,B00AQYXGT2,"I never heard of this movie and I truly believe that this movie ranks among Kareena Kapoor's top 3. She was real, deeply in character, and she maintained the excitement and appeal of the story. The chemistry between Kareena and Arjun was electric, intoxicating. I could watch this type of movie repeatedly. Love it!!",1397088000,,316,4.87037037037037

8556715,2,B00AQYXGT2,The thing that bothers me most about this movie is the ending. The narrator says she found happiness....but she looks miserable and lonely.

8556720,4,B00AQYXGT2,"This is one of those rare Hindi films that hits too close to reality and cuts so close to the bone that it couldn't be truly successful. It is a savage indictment of the Indian film industry and the cost of ego. I was amazed at the depth Kareena Kapoor brought to the role. It isn't a movie you want to watch for entertainment, but when you want reality to slap you in the face. Highly recommended!",1463356800,,398,4.181818181818182
