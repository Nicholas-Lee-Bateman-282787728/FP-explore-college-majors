As a movie it does not get better than this. I first saw it at the Chicago International Film Festival and my husband and I both immediately fell in love with it and we needed it on DVD so we could watch it again and again. It has one of the best messages about love and relationships I've ever seen.

This will forever be one of my favorite movies of all time.

Bottom line: I would recommend this movie and this seller to anyone and I do often.",1473811200,,710,3.9859154929577465
