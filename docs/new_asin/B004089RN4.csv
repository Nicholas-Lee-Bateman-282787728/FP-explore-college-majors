Love the characters in this film: The Giant, The Prince and Princess, Mr. Dinklepuss, Nellie the golden-egg laying goose and Polly the housekeeper.

A timeless piece of literature for all to enjoy! Just imagine what five little beans can do???? The best version Ive ever seen of this film is from Remember When Classic Movies- if you're considering purchasing a copy. Enjoy..",1474934400,,507,5.035714285714286
8412231,5,B004089RN4,"I must agree with other reviewers here, this is the best print available of this minor A&C film. DigiCom TV looks like they used an original print for their transfer, and it's in pristine condition.
Please be aware that this is the original 1952 release that runs 78 minutes, not the 82 minute Pre-View version that is more commonly available. This version is also a DVD-R.

So until Warner Archive releases this film, which they probably will never do, this is the version to get. I am purchasing the Allied Artists version that was released on March 16, 2016, so I will review that print as well.",1471046400,,598,4.588785046728972
8412232,5,B004089RN4,"Fantastic restoration of a classic! Beautiful audio and video quality!

Everyone is familiar with the fable, ""Jack and the Beanstalk"", and Abbott and Costello make this an extraordinary funny and entertaining watch! Lots of animated scenes and light, peppy musical score. Loads of comical action. A real must-see family program for adults and children alike. You'll really enjoy this classic, and it will brighten your mood and have you laughing out loud!!!!",1380412800,,458,5.361111111111111
8412233,5,B004089RN4,"This review is for the DigiCom TV release of A & C's ""Jack and the Beanstalk.""

This is a beautiful looking print.  Whenever I've seen this movie on TV the color is always so washed out.  Not one of A & C's better efforts but still fun to watch and definitely worth buying if you're an A & C completist.  Now if they'd only come out with a good print of ""... Meet Captain Kidd.""",1292025600,,378,4.0
