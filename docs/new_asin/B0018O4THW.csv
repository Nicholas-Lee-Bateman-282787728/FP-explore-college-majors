8270171,1,B0018O4THW,"Just streamed this movie for free, and although it cost me nothing in a monetary sense, I can never get back the last 90 minutes of my life.
Terribly acted all around, weak, done-to-death plot and no scares at all.
Just plain bad.
I thought this might be a fun way to kill some time.
It wasn't.
Don't waste yours.",1353715200,,313,4.233333333333333
8270172,1,B0018O4THW,"Chronicles of an exorcism looks lame and fake. This blonde girl is too much sexy.  One of two priest wears blue jean.  That is not proper to wear blue jean.  The two priests with a protestant pastor do not mixed to fight against satan.  Because a pastor does not know nothing about Catholicism. They are fake and lame actors.  So, do not buy it.  This movie sucks!!!",1331424000,,366,4.388059701492537
8270173,2,B0018O4THW,I had received it damaged and had it returned for another DVD.  When that arrived the DVD had a few flaws in it and I had it returned again.,1214784000,,140,3.8275862068965516
8270174,3,B0018O4THW,"I am a huge Mathew Ashford fan from his work on ""Days of our Lives"" and I also love exorcism movies, so ordering this seemed like a no-brainer for me.  I started watching this with a group of friends, and because of the slow pace and documentary style of the film, we ended up turning it off and just telling ghost stories for the rest of the night. It's the kind of movie that not everyone could appreciate (like indie films, documentarys, etc). Once home, I popped it in the DVD and finished watching it alone.  One thing I liked about this movie was that it had a very believable plot and although some of the girl's acting was amateurish in range, the other actors gave quite good performances.  The lack of suspense building music made this movie seem very foreign to the senses as a ""horror"" movie... you were left to your own imagination and intelligence to foreshadow and build suspense.  The ending was especially interesting... I don't want to spoil it for you... so let me just say, I'm still scratching my head a bit.  All in all, a good scary movie considering the plethora of really bad movies being made these days.  Give it a look!",1213920000,,1147,4.464114832535885
