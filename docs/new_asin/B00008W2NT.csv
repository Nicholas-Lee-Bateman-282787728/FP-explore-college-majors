1862782,1,B00008W2NT,"This is, by all appearances, an original copy.  But I cannot get 3-D effects on any computer, TV, or projection screen.  It is a 2-sided DVD, with 3-D on one side and regular on the other.  But nothing I did helped.  I was quite disappointed since I purchased it to show to students and had actually acquired a classroom set of 3-D glasses.  They had been looking forward to it.  But it was a bust.",1200528000,4,398,4.24
1862783,3,B00008W2NT,"Very good 3-D, mediocre movie.  The 3-D works very well, but most is computer-generated instead of real video.  It is a great addition to you HQFS 3-D collection.",1176249600,,162,4.75
1862784,4,B00008W2NT,"Sure this DVD is about environmental issues (reason for 4 stars), global warming, ect. but the special effects are spectacular! You have anything from a giant octopus popin' out of the screen at you, to monkeys throwing fruit through your tv screen! It is true most of the action is CGI, though there are a few live feeds. Overall, beyond the plot, its a fun 40 mins. Great for the whole family, kids will get a kick out it, gee my Father actually liked it, go figure!

P.S.

Most of the bonus features are in 3d, as well as, trailers for other DVDs like Haunted Castle, Alien Adventure(if you want a sneek peak before buying!)",1144800000,14,627,4.443478260869565
1862785,3,B00008W2NT,"....but it's yet another IMAX CGI animated 3D outing (the field-sequential shutter-glasses type of 3D).  Walter Cronkite (yep, he's still alive) narrates this excuse to explore computer-generated 3-D eco-systems (ocean, rain forest, etc.).  Strictly for those into the ""underground"" field-sequential 3D cult.",1128384000,2,308,6.309523809523809
1862786,1,B00008W2NT,I know it said it needs special glasses to watch it but it doesn't say what kind or the fact that you have to buy special expensive out dated equipment. This will not work on your 3d tv  .,1397779200,,188,3.8205128205128207
1862787,1,B00008W2NT,"Did not like it at all. I feel like wasted my money on this product. The quality was horrible, did want to return because then it cost me another $4. Make no sense.",1384992000,,164,4.0
1862788,1,B00008W2NT,"This video did NOT work for me. My Blu-Ray 3D player supports side-by-side and top/bottom technologies. This will not play in 3D no matter what I do. It was once on my Comcast lineup and it worked fine. For some reason the disc does not play on my player. I guess that's what the 3D ""Large Format"" means.",1375574400,,304,4.258620689655173
1862789,5,B00008W2NT,This is a DVD with both a regular version & a 3-D version in a format just like what you see in Theatres Today. As Tonight's Jurassic Park in 3-D was!!! I have other IMAX films but my two favorites are Encounters in the third dimension with ELVIRA & L5 - A City in Space. L5 is about the technoligy we presently have to do this endeavor!!! Sadly they have not released in 3-D yet?,1365465600,,380,4.08
1862790,1,B00008W2NT,"I received it, placed it in my PS3, played it and it doesnt work in any 3D format.  Any other 3D media is automatically recognized by my PS3 and PN64E8000 Samsung.  It is not like I am running this on some obscure system or outdated software!!!  If it only plays on obscure equipment why not say somewhere does not work with traditional 3D equipment???  I don't understand how Amazon lets them do it, the transportation cost they end up paying to take it back is more than the DVD?!?!",1350864000,,484,4.404494382022472
1862791,1,B00008W2NT,I COULDN'T 3D THIS DISC.  I CALLED SAMSUNG AND COMCAST SUPPORT AND WAS TOLD THAT THE DISC WAS NO GOOD. ALL MY OTHER DVDS AND BLU RAY 3D'S ARE FINE.,1348617600,,147,3.9
1862792,1,B00008W2NT,"I have a brand new Toshiba 3D tv. I can watch Blu Ray 3D, Comcast on demand 3D movies, Side by Side or Top-Bottom with no problems, but this DVD did not work. It looked like a mess on the screen. Too bad because I wanted a copy because Comcast was showing this on their free on demand movie channel and the 3D was amazing. The Movie was not good, but the 3D had scenes where Walter Cronkite seems to pop out of the screen. You do not see many pop outs with todays movies in 3D. I'll keep searching.",1313884800,,498,3.99
1862793,1,B00008W2NT,"A word of caution to prospective buyers. This disk is not in the  ""field sequential"" format. I have a Sony XBR52HX909 set with the requisite player and glasses and the image produced by the disk is a quivering mess (not in 3d). Significantly the packaging does not display the official 3D logo now used on proper field sequential disks. Exactly what format it may be is unclear - apparently it is not anaglyphic either.
In any case I have seen this program in 3D as a TV telecast and truthfully it has very weak content. If the 3D worked it would serve as a demo and not much more.",1285286400,4,581,4.330275229357798
1862794,1,B00008W2NT,This is NOT a 3D movie. I saw this movie at the Imaginarium and it was GREAT! The effects popped right into you. But this DVD does NOT work! It does not come with 3D glasses and I have half a dozen different types of 3D glasses and none of them show any 3D effect. The reviewers that rate this high should also mention what kind of glasses they were using.,1283299200,,356,4.028169014084507
1862795,3,B00008W2NT,"I received this dvd along with my x3d tvbox converter kit.  The 3d is amazing.  In order to get the 3D to work, you need specialized equipment (I have a box for my CRT TV) with glasses that 'shutters' so your eyes see the different images.  Otherwise, you are stuck watching the 2d side.  Other than that, the movie is terrible.  It was originally written as a 'theme park attraction' for IMAX Theaters.  It's focus is on the green house effect, overfishing and the deforestation of rain forests.  There are very little facts on any issue.  It talks about 2 minutes on a subject then goes to a 5 minute short computer animated clip with the helpless animals, only to get pwnd by mankind.  The purpose of the movie is to 'spark public interest into finding more information' on these man-made catastrophes.  If you want a movie to test out your 3d equipment, this movie was made for you.  If you want to find out anything useful or new about the environment, don't waste your time on it.  I give this 3 stars because of the 3d, only.",1270425600,,1032,4.430851063829787

7987258,5,B00008W2NT,I give it 5 stars for 3d demo only. When the snake comes out the screen; you're sold on the 3d. I haven't seen anything yet to compare. I'm buying it strictly to show to those curious about my 3d TV's,1424476800,,200,3.902439024390244

7987260,2,B00008W2NT,Would not work in my 3D DVD player but I did see this documentary when it was offered free on Netflix or Hulu and it was an awesome documentary with great 3D effects for such an old video.,1406246400,,188,3.973684210526316

7987262,1,B00008W2NT,"It really is that boring. This is suppose to be what they show in the amusement park somewhere in Europe. If this is the video they are showing it is not going to make their point and it is certainly not going to get people motivated to want to make changes. I wouldnt have finished watching it if I had been able to get up or could have found the remote control. I stopped watching it early into the video and it was just back ground noise I didn't even pay attention to. I decided to read a book rather than keep watching this film.
I recommend you don't buy this video, it isn't even worth a .01 or the 3.99 you will pay to have it shipped  in my opinion. I don't even recommend you borrowing it from a friend or from the library and certainly don't pay to rent it. Your kids won't even sit through this one.",1399248000,,811,4.06875
