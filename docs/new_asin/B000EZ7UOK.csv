8115999,4,B000EZ7UOK,"Doesn't matter what you think of certain movies as a whole, some scenes are simply unforgettable. The smoking scene in Dead Again: who can forget it? With this one it's a scene involving a routine domestic chore: ironing. And no, the iron is not being used as a weapon. Beyond that, this was indeed a pretty good, quite unsensationalistic movie, the least realistic point being of course that the prostitutes, particularly the star, tend to be gorgeous. Based on a memoir. (The English movie title doesn't fit the mood of the movie. The memoir's English translation was more suitably understated as The Life, but that title has since been appropriated by a considerably inferior quasi-documentary on prostitution.)",1302134400,2,714,5.111111111111111
