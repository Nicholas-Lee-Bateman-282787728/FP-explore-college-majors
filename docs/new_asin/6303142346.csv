570822,3,6303142346,"The HD remake of this movie is very washed out at times. That is, the colors are still brilliant, and the lines are sharp, but they left out a lot of the darkness contrast in favor of showing more details in the shadows. In scenes like that where the Beast is supposed to ""come into the light,"" we weren't MEANT to clearly see his features until he makes that grand appearance. If you're just looking for an updated copy of the movie to share with the family, this is certainly an improvement over watching the VHS copy, but from a cinematic experience, I'm not overly impressed with some of the stylistic choices.",1523318400,,614,4.491071428571429

We all know this was the only Disney Animated Classic movie to be nominated for best picture, and watching it again (in 3D) really reminded me why. Gorgeous hand draw 2D animation is a lost art i n this day and age, and here you get to see it at it's best. The packaging is very nice, even the Blu-ray discs look neat!

571149,5,6303142346,"I feel like anything that has been said about this has already been said by both the general audience and movie critics alike so I don't think I have anything new to add beyond that, yeah, this is definitely one of my favorite films of all time and I hope it will always be a classic.

It did pretty much everything great: music, animation, pacing, writing, characters, and I'm just going to end up listing every job cuz it is just that great.

I know by today's standards people are expecting some super deep things (which is fine, cuz I enjoy that too), but I think a lot of people forget that a  simplistic film is just as amazing as a very in-deph film(just like how a deep film can easily be a mess or not actually be that deep at all). And I think it's good to appreciate the different level of depths in film so long as we don't ignore the quality of everything else; and thus, I truly think this Beauty and the Beast will be remembered for a long, long time due to level of both effort and skill that was put into it.",1519084800,,1025,4.166666666666667

572227,5,6303142346,"I bought this for my sister's birthday. It's not only her favorite version but it's our's, as well.
Beast looks like a legitimate Beast rather than a short goat like in the live action. Robby Benson's voice is perfect to portray the Beast.
Jodi Benson as 'Belle' has such a beautiful singing voice and has a sweet innocence about her. No offense, but Emma is too tomboyish and she can't sing without extreme auto tuning.
Le Fou is a bumbling, secondary character who only looks up to Gaston. He is devious and mean hearted.
The moral of this cartoon is to never judge a book by its cover.
Beast was conceited and mean at first, dismissing an old beggar woman based simply on her looks.
So, the beggar woman revealed her true beauty and turned the Beast into what he was really like on the inside: a monster.
Belle's patience and her heart eventually softens the Beast's cruel and impatient attitude. And just in time, too.
And, Belle discovers who the real monster was: Gaston. His evil deeds eventually cost him his life in the end.
True love conquers all. As it usually does in these types of movies.
What the cartoon version accomplished in 80+ minutes, the I've action couldn't do in over 2 hours.
Get the cartoon. It's actually worth it.

(And, please don't reply if you're only going to bash me for my opinion because I didn't like the live action like you did. I can't be made to like something just to soothe ruffled feathers.)
I won't respond to trolling and I will block you. Thanks.",1504915200,,1493,4.529629629629629

573297,5,6303142346,"Beauty and the Beast is an animated classic that, along with other great works composed by Alan Menken, made it really popular for strong musical numbers and animation to combine for children's films. This influenced my entire generation as we were growing up, and the remakes (props again to Alan Menken and the 2017 Disney team) only increase the number of people who are likely to watch this beautifully told story about a man who had everything and lost it because he could not appreciate inner beauty finding love with a woman who is only appreciated for her outer beauty and not accepted for who she is on the inside or what she wants out of life. This tale as old as time unites romance with wonderful music and storytelling that teaches children that beauty isn't as important as how you treat others, and I'm so glad that another generation gets to experience it.
The special features on the Amazon Instant Video include some wonderful behind the scenes footage of the original voice actors as they performed, as well as three interview sections: the background of how Disney himself was interested but never got around to telling this story in his time, a segment from Paige O'Hara about being the voice of Belle and how it changed her life, and (most exciting for me) a segment where some of Disney's top composers sit together and talk about the music of Beauty and the Beast and how it was created and how animation affects the music--Kristen Anderson-Lopez and Robert Lopez from Frozen, Lin Manuel Miranda from Moana and Hamilton, Stephen Schwartz of Wicked and Hunchback of Notre Dame (as well as many others), and OF COURSE Disney Legend and music genius, Alan Menken who worked with the late great Howard Ashman to create the music of Beauty and the Beast (as well as The Little Mermaid and nearly every other fabulous Disney musical).
But, I digress.
Beauty and the Beast is a timeless classic that everyone should enjoy, and it is a must see for every child (and adult).",1499299200,,1989,4.718390804597701

573868,5,6303142346,"First things first, I am not a huge fan of animated movies. I have to push myself to watch them with my 5 year old, and yes sometimes I do end up liking them, but most times I can barely tolerate them, though I do it anyway, because my son wants company.

Having said that, this particular animated movie is a class apart. Okay there is a slight possibility that I am biased, because this story/movie represents my childhood, so it has nostalgic value.

But even outside of that, this was also the first ever animated movie to get an Oscar nomination for Best Picture. So you see, I wasn't really exaggerating when I said it was a class apart.

Also, there are many things that I love about the underlying story - the subtle yet powerful message of  true beauty lies within, the cast of characters  the lovely spirited Belle, who was light years ahead of her time, the complex, yet vulnerable Beast, and the adorable supporting cast, which were basically a wide assortment of walking talking household items (the Princes servants transformed under the curse).

Also the songs! I cant believe that I am this obsessed over the songs of a childrens movie. I loved many of them, from Something There to Be Our Guest, but the title track is hands down my favorite. In fact I dare you to not fall under the spell of Tale as Old as Time.

I am completely obsessed, so much so that I have taken to random crooning of Tale as Old as Time, Song as Old as Rhyme  Beauty & The Beast all around the house as I go about my daily chores. My 5 year old gives me the oddest look when he witnesses these random musical episodes, but then follows it up with a wide grin. I don't think I want to know what he thinks of the whole situation.

574941,5,6303142346,"I just resaw this after seeing the 2017 live-action movie.  This movie is easy to like for people of any age and either gender.  I think of it as Disney's last traditional style animated movie--not its last movie to be traditionally animated, but its last movie to have the characteristics of animated movies of Walt's time.  There are references to The Legend of Sleepy Hollow (1949) with Belle's father and his horse getting lost in the dark woods and Gaston's behavior strongly resembling Brom Bones.  The voice of Cogsworth sounds a lot like those voices from Walt Disney's time, and the humorous gags are so visually and conceptually like the way it was done in Walt's time.

Each song has creative ideas which move the story forward and often add humor.  I wonder if it was a conscious decision for Alan Menken to make the opening song ""Bonjour"" resemble an opera song with Belle singing to herself, Gaston singing to himself, and the chorus joining in.  ""Be Our Guest"", the castle hospitality song, is very powerful because it brightens the mood, and the visual look of the room itself, after she's in despair, much like ""Friend Like Me"" would do in Aladdin.  The song entitled ""Beauty and the Beast"" is very meaningfully done also.  The melodies are very memorable and singable, and the humorous gags during the songs and the lyrics of the songs are clever.  (So is a silly joke ""If it ain't baroque, don't fix it."")  There's a reference to the swimming pool choreography of Esther Williams's Million Dollar Mermaid in ""Be Our Guest"", and a lot of other things adults would notice but kids (including me formerly) would not.

The visual imagination is really remarkable also, because even though the village is only about an hour's journey from the castle, you feel like there are two separate worlds.  The castle is a cross between a palace and a cathedral, but somehow it leaves you wanting to see more and more parts of it, especially because it's so exaggeratedly large:  200 or more people who work at this castle which doesn't need to be maintained, waiting as animated objects for 10 years, with a library probably 50 or more feet tall with tens of thousands of books, in an indefinitely defined era sometime between the printing press's invention and the 1700s!  Nobody in the village knows about this castle, which is only about an hour away through the woods, when only 10 years ago, it was as grandiose as the Palace of Versailles!  And there's a funny inconsistency in that he stays a beast forever if he hasn't found true love by age 21, and it's been 10 years since that curse was inflicted on him, but the opening picture shows an adult prince receiving the curse.  The prologue, with narration (the narrator sounds like Liam Neeson kind of) and church-art-style stained glass images, is also really powerful.  And I love how these Disney movies always have to have really close calls toward the end:  AS THE LAST PEDAL FALLS, the dying beast is resurrected into a beautiful prince because she expresses her love to him.

The movie is visually and musically powerful, even though the characterization is not believable:  The beast transforms too quickly into a nice person when he had been willing to imprison Belle's father forever, and Belle is super-smart and doesn't have to do housework while her dad is an impractical inventor.  Gaston and his flunky LeFou are very unrealistic also.  There aren't any normal characters really, not even Belle, though she comes the closest along with Mrs. Potts.  But somehow it still works well and keeps you emotionally connected to the dilemma and wowed by the positive ending.  Having memorable characters at the castle of Cogsworth (turned into a clock), Lumiere (turned into a candlestick), and Mrs. Potts (turned into a teapot) is a boon to the movie.  There's no formula for making a movie work so well.  It just had creative passion and the creators studied a lot of the work of Walt Disney's era and put together an amazing movie.  It's a really awesome achievement!",1491782400,,4038,4.779538904899136

576082,5,6303142346,"I've been a real animation junky all my life, though I spent many years unsatisfied as the medium itself seemed to in decline, no thanks to Hanna Barbera's mimimalized style popularized weekly cartoon shows like Yogi Bear, Flintstones, the Jetsons and even Scooby Doo -- and Japanese Anime made cartoons look like cheap Cartoons. But starting in 1988 with ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit and the release of this exquisite 'Beauty' in 1991, Disney triumphantly reclaimed animation as the true artistic and dramatic medium.

I saw the openings of both films in New York with a group of fellow tech and film theater folks and had the experience of seeing my colleagues jaws drop in awe in the opening moments of both films. These were people who dedicated to creating visual magic and I would have thought that nothing could astonish them, but when the viewer's eye was drawn through the enchanted forest to the Beast's castle, my friends and I were totally enchanted and stayed that way from beginning to end.

The animation is gorgeous throughout, the orchestral score lush and the songs lovely. And, like the magnificent films of Disney's former animation glory days, the voices -- by a cast of wonderful actors Page O'Hara, Bobby Benson, Richard White, Jerry Orbach, David Ogden Stiers and Angela Lansbury -- are wonderful. And one thing that Disney's stable of animators does so well -- bringing the actual characters of the actors into the animation -- is nothing short of magical.

I saw it in this theater several times and then waited -- very impatiently -- for its release on video (cassette at that time). Over the years I have updated my copy from tape, to disk to Blue-Ray and digital each time marveled anew at the wonder of this beautiful film.

I worried for a time that Disney might see this as a 'one and done' for animation of this quality, but thankfully Disney -- and the movie going public - can't get enough of terrific animation and computer animation has taken the medium to ever more magical heights.

And it's rather ironic that in the last few years, Disney and others have combined the skills of animation to create 'live action'' version of beloved classics -- like 'Cinderella' a couple years ago and the soon to be released 'Beauty'. I'm probably among millions waiting anxiously for the release of the new film, but know that the animated version will lose none of its appeal.",1486684800,,2399,4.785024154589372

578337,5,6303142346,"This movie blows me away. There is something captivating, magical, and precious that other movies don't have. Maybe it's that  Belle cares about someone because of who he is inside. Maybe it's the influence of tragedy and showing you the value of life. (Cinderella being locked up in an attic is nothing compared to this.)  I can't name it, but I'll always love this. It's my favorite  fairy tale.  The quality on the DVD was good, too, in case you're wondering.

Although the movie is wonderful, and the quality on the DVD is perfect, the digital copy on your phone, tablet, or computer isn't. If you want to try watching it that way, don't click on the first option, ""Watch now."" When I tried that, it would glitch every three seconds. However, if you scroll down, seeing all the other things you can watch (25 fun facts, the making of Lumiere, ""Belle"" song, etc.), you will see different movie editions you can watch, like sing-along. If you choose theatrical edition, the movie will play fine. Again, just don't try the option at the top.",1482883200,,1042,4.641304347826087

578978,5,6303142346,How can a Disney movie be bad,1481760000,,29,3.2857142857142856
578979,3,6303142346,"My favorite parts of the movie are the songs ""Belle,"" the reprise, the song, ""Something There,"" the way Belle sacrifices herself for her dad, and the ending. I also always crack up at the ""Come to dinner"" argument. Other than that, I'm not crazy about the movie. I don't like the animation style - it often looks sloppy and misshapen. I prefer neater, angular styles like in Pocahontas and Sleeping Beauty. I don't really care for the songs other than the ones I've mentioned. Tale as Old as Time is decent, but I don't like it as much as Belle. From the moment Gaston starts harassing Belle, the movie continues to alternate between making me uncomfortable and boring me. I don't know why it bores me, it just kind of does. Belle herself is a nice enough young woman, but other than the way she sacrifices herself for her father, she comes off as self absorbed and uninvolved with others because of her bookwormish introversion. She complains that no one understands her because they don't share her love of reading or her desire for adventure. As a kid who used to isolate myself from people because they weren't interested in my storywriting before I grew out of it, I think she'd have had a better shot at making friends if she had tried to meet people halfway. Why not try to share in the interests of the others? She gives off an air of feeling she doesn't really need to reach out to others; after coming to the Beast's castle, she just kind of sits on a pedestal and waits for others to bring good things to her, knowing she doesnt need to make the effort to reach out to others because she's too good. Also, there's nothing wrong with a movie about a wicked and nasty person who reforms himself for love, but becoming a good person shouldn't have to mean becoming an emasculated, bumbling softie who gets laughed at by his love interest, cant even competently feed a bird or keep himself from collapsing in snow, and is ready to lie down, mope and give up when his love leaves.",1481760000,,1986,4.488950276243094

580577,5,6303142346,"Its been 25 years since this wonderful Disney Animated film found its way to viewers and forever captured their hearts. Since then, there have been dozens of other animated classics, but none leave the impression that Beauty and the Beast does. With its humor, spectacular animation, character design, story and adventures, this story is truly one of, if not, the best that Disney Studios has ever made.

Beauty and the Beast has many different genres, the main one being romance. Along with that is a sense of adventure and excitement. The film also has its share of exciting scenes that keep you on the edge of your seat almost the entire time, even if you saw it many times before.

It begins when Belle (Paige OHara), a young girl in a village, has to rescue her father from a big and scary Beast living in a dark castle. Belle then has to stay in the castle for the rest of her life to free her father. It turns out that the Beast is, in fact a prince, under a dark and magical curse. This curse makes him a horrible Beast and the only way to break it is to find a girl that will fall in love with him. The Beast and Belle start bonding and falling in love.

Beauty and the Beast is an extraordinary masterpiece for many of the reasons I mentioned, but what impresses me the most is the animation. Despite its now 25 years old and way before the first computer animation, there are scenes in the film where it incorporates 3D like effects and looks almost exactly like todays computer animation. To think that it was actually drawn by hand is spectacular and astonishing. On top of that, the voice over work is simply phenomenal, from singing to talking, each emotion and role is played ideally. Speaking of music, the songs in this animated classic are fantastically done from the beat to the lyrics, to the actual voiceover artists singing the songs, to very well-orchestrated scenes.

The DVD also comes with several very cool bonus features. The most exciting to me is the sneak peak of the 2017 live action version of Beauty and the Beast with Emma Watson and Dan Stevens. It shows the cast reading lines, some special effects and even several sets. If that is not enough to spark viewers curiosity, there are also many facts about Beauty and the Beast as well as some footage of the actual recording booths where the original cast recorded their lines. I also enjoyed the part when it talks about how Walt Disney never really got to do this story, even though he wanted to, and thus in 1991, his creative team did it to honor his wishes.

My favorite scene is when Belle goes down to eat dinner in the castle for the first time. In this castle, all the servants are magically turned into utilities. Just to name a few, there are talking clocks, teapots, knives, a stove, wardrobes, candles and more. They all do a big musical number with the classic song, Be my Guest, which sounds spectacular and the animated musical number has many parts that are just hysterical.

Despite some violent scenes, it is still perfect for kids. I recommend it for ages 5 to 18. Younger kids may find the Beast scary or may not enjoy the more intense scenes. I give Beauty and the Beast 5 out of 5 stars for absolutely phenomenal animation, an exciting and detailed story, beautiful songs and emotional voiceover work. Heres to another 25 years with a new generation!\

580727,5,6303142346,"**Beauty and the Beast (Five Disc Combo: Blu-ray 3D / Blu-ray / DVD / Digital Copy)**

Disney is not reproducing 3D copies of Beauty and the Beast at this point in time. Despite the re-release of the classic animation, preceding the release of the live-action film this next year, there is not a 3D option  Some have argued against the color transfer quality of the Blu-Ray combo-pack release, and that the 3D version pack provides a better transfer. This is difficult to say, but most agree that the 3D version of this film may or may not be for everyone.

I was fortunate, the pre-owned copy I had purchased had not utilized its Digital Copy.  Its important to understand how Disney Movies Anywhere is now working: while some of the titles may/may not have expired, I have not yet experienced an expired redemption code, only feedback messages of code has already been redeemed.  Previously, ""Digital Copy"" allowed disc owners to download a copy of their films onto their tablet devices and laptops; these copies still work, but are often Standard Definition versions.  Today, Disney honors those owning a Digital Copy redemption code (accessible through registered accounts), through providing an additional Digital HD streaming copy aligned with their current Disney Movies Anywhere network. Disney is actually pretty stingy on everything else, so it's nice to know they do this.

Those with a Disney movies Anywhere Account can link their Amazon, VUDU, and iTunes accounts. Thereafter, any movie registered through one of these accounts is automatically linked on all other accounts, including Disney Movies Anywhere (DMA). For Beauty and The Beast, we registered our Digital Copy (no longer offered as an option on new Disney movies), long after the film had been placed back into the vault, and long after any 'expiration date'; instantly the film was viewable on our Amazon account, as well as DMA, iTunes, and VUDU accounts.  In the event that you purchase a Digital Copy Disney film, it is extremely important that you reconcile your DMA and various other streaming accounts.

It remains to be seen how Disney will look to address existing Digital HD access as streaming sources improve in bitcontent quality. Will they finally offer an upgrading price, or will they merely offer a new option for UHD, at an additional $20? This is hard to say.  (VUDU can facilitate disc-to-digital upgrades for its Ultraviolet partnered films).  For my family, we love our B&TB copy, I appreciate having the 3D no longer offered. The digital streaming version looks tremendous on Amazon, but this should be the same version offered to any account owning a digital streaming copy. Note: at currently I am having issues playing any Disney-affiliated movie on VUDU in their HDX format on my laptop; VUDU states I own this upgraded viewing option, but this issues persist.",1477353600,,2863,5.031712473572939

581277,5,6303142346,"I am a big fan of Disney movies not necessarily Disney cause I think they are a money hungry company that doesn't do their customers right, but anyway.  Beauty and the Beast while I don't consider it in my top 5, is still a good movie.  I hate the vault and I don't care about special features(I just want the movie), so the only reason I bought it was I didn't own it yet, so I can't comment on if the special features are worth buying it just to own the Signature Edition if you already own it(I wouldn't though).  When Disney starts supplying fans with what they request and quit teasing them with partial releases(like DuckTales, Gummi Bears, etc.) maybe I would consider rewarding them by buying in to their money grabbing Vault scheme.",1476230400,,741,4.474074074074074

581350,5,6303142346,"A classic!  This is a movie good for all ages and has a great message.  The story for those who don't know it:

Belle is an ""unusual girl"" according to her whole town.  This is because she lives in a time where women don't typically read or have their own thoughts.  Her dad is an inventor and ends up lost in the woods and finds a castle where he is impressed by the owner.  The castle is owned by what used to be a prince, but was turned into a beast.  The prince was a jerk and ticked off an enchantress and she turned him into a beast.  He needed to have a kiss from a ""true love"" in so many years or he would be a beast forever.  Well let's just say the daughter of the inventor, Belle, goes looking for her dad and meets the beast...I won't spoil it.

A great movie and great quality.  I'm not a huge musical fan but the songs are so catchy!",1476144000,,847,3.9526627218934913

 While watching this with my 3 year old I forgot a a few parts that were a little scary. Like when Belle's Dad stumbles upon the castle and the Beasts gets really angry and imprisons him.  Also when the Beast yells at Belle and fights the wolves to save Belle were a little scary for her.  But all in all she loves this and asks to watch it everyday multiple times a day.

This comes with both the DVD and the Blue Ray disc.  There is also a code to get a digital copy which I think is great because now she can watch it on her tablet when we go on long car rides.",1475971200,,775,4.019607843137255

581859,5,6303142346,"Kind of funny, I never saw this movie until last night with my predilection towards all things animated. It was worth the wait. Disney had not put out anything of this quality since the 40s. And they haven't done so since. Magical is a word that gets tossed around frequently when talking Disney, Here the adjective is not spurious in the least. Artwork and animation Old Walt would have been proud of. A witty and sweet screenplay that never gets sappy. Great selection of songs and music to warm even the most frozen of hearts. And a voice acting cast and performance completely beyond reproach. Truly this is a masterwork of the artform. This Blu-ray edition was watched upscaled on my 4k TV, and the result was fabulously detailed and vibrant. The sound quality of the 5.1 soundtrack was flawless. If you don't already own this I would highly suggest you take care of that transgression immediately.",1475366400,,903,4.75796178343949

581940,5,6303142346,"Beauty and the Beast has been, by far, my most favorite of the classic Disney Princess films.  It has everything you could ever want: a beautifully developed romance, thrills and suspense, action, a rather well developed setting, and a beautiful environment.  And need I say the music still stands as awesome?  All in all, nothing needs to be said as most of us know that the movie itself is simply beautiful and stunning.  Wouldn't have lasted this long if it wasn't.  But what of the package itself?

CONTENT ISSUES:
Well, in case some folks don't remember, there's really nothing offensive in this film and is all around safe for all ages.  The only thing that is remotely possibly offensive is that Gaston's fangirls show a little cleavage since they have slightly lower bustlines in their dresses.

The PACKAGE:
The inclusions are definitely worthy of a 25th Anniversary release.  You've got 3 versions of the film (original theatrical, special edition, and sing-along).  That alone is awesome.  But what I especially loved was the mini-documentaries and interviews with the voice actors, composers, a look at Disney's fairytale inspirations and library.  Actually seeing the recording session videos was an especially revealing treat, too!  What's more, when you connect this film to the ""Disney Movies Anywhere"" app/network (via digital code included in the package), you can unlock even more features.

Blu-ray Transfer:
Some folks have been noting some artifacts.  In my case, I did not notice anything, but that may be because I was watching it on a flat screen with lowered ""sharpness"".  But the issue seems not so much that the Blu-rays were badly transferred, but that our viewing technology is much sharper and less forgiving about old animation mistakes than older tech.  Colors are certainly more vivid, but higher definition also lends itself to revealing more imperfections when watching media that was not originally produced with HD in mind (this was way back in 1991...before we even had dvds).  So, if you are graphically sensitive, I would recommend turning down the sharpness (or even just watch the DVD version that's included).  However, again, I didn't notice much to disappoint me at all.",1475193600,,2216,5.105555555555555

581945,5,6303142346,"This is a favorite of my wife and daughter.

I still remember watching this when it first came out with my wife and her parents. It was very good and we all loved it. So watching this again last night was a nice trip down memory lane for me.

I doubt if the picture was as good as it was last night on our 4K 75 inch LCD when it first came out - it certainly could not have been much better. Colors were very rich, true and vibrant. Images were razor sharp and crystal clear - almost 3D. Sound was great - both sound and picture seemed to be improved from our old DVD (we watched the Blu-Ray version).

The extras were ok - nothing to set you heart on fire but still nice to have.

I not going to talk about the story as almost everyone has seen this at least once.

Price was very good at $22.96 (included S&H) which was 3 cents lower than the Target etc that are close to me.

So in summary a great movie with great picture and sound at a very competitive price - I would rate this a very high 9.50 to 10 out of 10 - yeas it truly is that good!",1475193600,,1046,3.887323943661972

582009,5,6303142346,"A copy of this title was provided for review purposes.

There is indeed something magical about the animated films of the Walt Disney Studios. From their very first outing with SNOW WHITE AND THE SEVEN DWARVES it was apparent. People talk about capturing lightning in a bottle but it was Disney who captured lightning in an inkwell. And while the studio now focuses almost solely on computer animation it was the hand drawn craftsmen of the past that were able to create an art form that remains stunning to this day.

It seems only natural that the Disney Studios, a group that was almost always ahead of the curve, would eventually change over to computer animation. While this is great on a technological level it is sad on another, the loss of an art form. Still, theyve left behind so many movies to enjoy that it will never be completely lost. And this week the film that first combined the two styles is released in a 25th anniversary package, BEAUTY AND THE BEAST.

Taken from the classic childrens story the plot is fairly simple. The film begins with the tale of a young prince cursed for his selfishness by an enchantress and turned into a beast until he can find true love. It revolves around a young girl whose father is an inventor. A carefree young woman, Belle loves to read and is considered odd by most people in her small town. At the same time she catches the eye of Gaston, the good looking and conceited hunter in town.

Belles father heads off to show his new invention nearby but on the way home loses his way and his horse and wagon. Chased by wolves he takes refuge at a nearby castle, invited in by the magical items in the house led by Lumiere, a candlestick, and Cogsworth, a clock. But the master of the house, the Beast, does not take kindly to strangers and throws him in his dungeon.

When the horse returns home Belle jumps aboard and has it take her to her father. Begging the Beast to allow her father to leave, she agrees to remain in his place forever. Thus begins a courtship between the two that begins in the worst way possible with the Beast, having spent his years alone, not knowing how to react to this young woman. As he learns how to behave, with the help of the magical items in the castle, he also learns to love Belle.

Back home Gaston, humiliated when Belle turned down his proposal, plots to force Belle into marrying him. He gets his chance to blackmail her when she returns home after leaving the Beast behind to rescue her father who was hoping to rescue her. While the townspeople think her father was loony and creating the Beast in his mind, Belle proves the Beast exist. This incurs the wrath of Gaston who leads the townspeople in an effort to destroy the Beast. Can love survive and bloom in this story?

The movie works on so many levels. The best of these is the fact that it takes a story many grew up with, a childrens tale of love and devotion, and stick to it rather than surround it with politically correct concepts. Many of todays films seem intent of making message pictures rather than entertaining ones. In doing so something is lost. BEAUTY AND THE BEAST was one of the last films from Disney that didn't attempt to do so and because of that I find it to be one of the last of their great animated films. It is story for the sake of story rather than an attempt to influence.

It also works as one of the great animated pieces in recent times, even if it is 25 years old. Can it really be that old? As I said earlier the movie was a combination of the classic hand drawn style of animation and computer generated animation. The ballroom scene heavily used the new animation style and because of it Disney Studios invested more into the new technology. When you watch something like FROZEN or ZOOTOPIA today its because of this movie.

The creativity on display here is enormous. The use of various items in the Beasts castle as characters may not have been done here for the first time but it is some of the most entertaining. Everything from an armoire to a chipped teacup named Chip is brought to life and believably so. Images of brooms and mops from Disneys FANTASIA come to mind in certain scenes and thats a good thing.

Lastly there is the music here. With music by Alan Menken and words by Howard Ashman each and every song in the film is one that will find its way into your head and remain there for some time. Belle and Gaston capture the essence of each of the characters, helping round out who they are. Be Our Guest captures the fun seen in many of the classic Disney animated films. And the title track is a tremendous love song that remains popular to this day. That this film was the first to be adapted for the stage only makes sense.

The extras found in this package are the standard fare these days with nothing really standing out but it is the movie itself that makes this one worth adding to your collection. In addition to the blu-ray of the film a standard DVD version and digital version are included making it well worth the price. This is not a movie that will collect dust but rather one that can be enjoyed on occasion and definitely will be pulled out when the kids stop by. A treasure that is a must have for all.",1475107200,,5221,4.4

Nothing looks faded, or over-processed. No sharpening or compression artifacts to speak of. The animation is crisp, not soft at all. It's right on par with the Lion King blu-ray, and it's hard to believe this movie was made in 1991. Even the 3D effects have aged very well, and look great. Truly a must-have, this movie is not only an amazing showcase of the blu-ray format, but is the culmination of Disney perfecting their form, and the results are spectacular.",1474848000,,723,4.746031746031746

The animation is hand-drawn and from 1991 when Disney was in the midst of their ""Grrrl Power"" phase, so it was a return to the fables and fairy tales of the past. Compared to ""Princess and the Frog"" the animation is decidedly second-rate. The one thing that really bothers me about this Blu ray is the colors: they have clearly goosed it from the original and there is a super-abundance of ORANGE! Orange is everywhere! Even Pierre the horse is orange (among other colors as well). Aside from the title song all the other songs are deeply forgettable. But in saying all that for anyone who enjoys a heartwarming Disney movie, this has to be a part of your collection.

I was such a fan of this movie, I bought the laser disk of WIP when it first came out. It was a very interesting presentation that I still enjoy watching. (I want to get rid of the laser disc player, because video quality is so much better now) I bought this new set, after being convinced, while not on physical disk, it was available in digital form. I was wrong -- the WIP version they include in their digital extras is a tiny PIP inside a regular view of the original presentation.

As far as the bonus features go, they are above average and include an interview with Paige O'hara who plays the voice of Belle, it features a sneak peak at the live action version (nothing that hasn't been seen before), there is a 25 fun facts to the movie (which is pretty cool). Like did you know the Beast can be seen in Aladdin? (there's more). It's a really fun tie in to the other movies to get kids looking for things in other movies. My favorite is the interview/chat with Steven Schwartz and Alan Menken, it is an interesting added addition to the bonus features. It does take up most of the bonus content but it is awesome. Some studio footage is shown during the various extra features. Bottom line, I only bought this because I wanted the digital version of it. Why 4 stars?

I love the characters and the actors who voiced them were perfectly cast (particularly Bell and Gaston). If you've never seen this movie before, you owe it to yourself to give it a go.

Just as a side note, if you have little kids, there are a few moments in the early sections of this movie that scared me as a 2 year old, so just bear that in mind.",1469318400,,594,4.076923076923077
582670,5,6303142346,"Of course the movie is awesome - that's why I bought it. But the clarity of this disc is super nice as well! If you're looking for a cheaper option than the ones offered on Amazon in Blu-ray, this is a great pick in my opinion. At around $30, this older Diamond Edition is much cheaper than the Platinum Edition (which for some reason is $140+ on Amazon?!?) I bought the disc ""Used - Like New"" and received it in the original plastic packaging. The disc is great quality, with vibrant colors and crisp lines in the animation. As an added perk, this version also offers the option of watching the movie with all the finalized scenes and songs that were not included in the theatrical release (which if you're like me and have only seen the VHS version, is a pretty cool surprise!) But you can watch the original, theatrical VHS version if you so choose.

**A short heads up though: Even though this version is sweet and has a lot of great perks and the seller is fantastic, Disney has just released the 25th Anniversary edition of Beauty and the Beast - it's available on Amazon in Blu-Ray really cheap right now!

582721,5,6303142346,"Beauty and the Beast tells the story about a spoiled prince disregarding the plight of common people which results in an enchantment transforming him into a beastly creature.  Only by bestowing love to another person and then receiving love in return, will allow the prince to be transformed back to his human form.  When a young woman named Belle is led to the beast's castle during her search for her missing father, an opportunity is presented to break the spell and find love.

This film is slightly based on the French fairy tale written by Gabrielle-Suzanne Barbot de Villeneuve.  Since the movie only partially adapts her story, many events from the French tale are left out.  Notably: fairies are absent, Belle's dreams of a handsome prince are not depicted, Belle's dysfunctional family members are omitted, criticisms about the pursuit of wealth is eradicated, and the Beast's familial background encompassing a war and an evil fairy are not presented in Disney's film.  If someone wishes to learn about these captivating events from Gabrielle-Suzanne Barbot de Villeneuve's tale of Beauty and the Beast, one will need to read the fairy tale.  Despite the preceding alterations to Gabrielle-Suzanne Barbot de Villeneuve's story, Disney's Beauty and the Beast is a very good movie and it is a film that should never have been remade.

Several reasons cause Disneys Beauty and the Beast to be a five star film.  The movie has beautiful artwork that is of a superior qualitythe art does not look like sketches, and frames are not reused as what occurred in Disneys original The Jungle Book film.  In a unique move, the villain looks good with very handsome features instead of Disneys typical depiction of a sinister appearance.  Furthermore, the good prince looks bad with incredibly brutish features instead of Disneys usual presentation of a beautiful man.  Those two unique factors regarding the good and bad characters are a welcomed novelty which causes viewers to think more critically about the characters.
The music for the film is wonderful.  The songs and score are well arranged and filled with ear catching melodies.  Therefore, the soundtrack is one many people may want to acquire and listen to.
Moreover, this Disney film makes another rare move in its story telling regarding the actions of its female heroine.  Belle is presented to be the true hero of the story because she saves the prince in numerous ways that is hardly ever shown in other Disney films---Belle doesnt have to be rescued since she in fact does the rescuing.---Belle also does not succumb to a state of depression when her actions yield unwanted results as what often transpires in other Disney films.  Belle experiences longing to pursue her goals and finds the means to achieve them.  Such depiction of a female heroine is rare in a Disney film and therefore, Disneys Beauty and the Beast is a tantalizing pleasure.

  Thusly, this film is classic.  So much so, that even the romantic comedy film, that is also a bit raunchy, Shes Out of My League has its male characters lovingly refer to Disneys Beauty and Beast.  Belles depiction as a heroine is iconic, and one that is rightfully grouped with other important heroines such as: Natty Gann from the film The Journey of Natty Gann, Dorothy Gale from the film Return to Oz, Trinity from the film The Matrix, Jupiter Jones from the film Jupiter Ascending, Sarah Connor from the TV series Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles, and Batgirl as well as Wonder Woman from the DC New 52 comic books.  All those heroines are ideal heroic women, and Belle as depicted in the 1991 Disney film belongs to that family of heroines.

Hence, it is pathetic to remake this Disney film.  Emma Watson, along with the other main cast, are the worst choices for a remake.  Emma Watson isn't even French, and she doesnt even look like Belle from the original Disney movie.  Belle should be played by actress Adele Exarchopoulos.  Furthermore, Luke Evans who also is not French, is too old and weathered looking to play Gaston.  Gaston is supposed to be handsome in a pretty way, not a rugged way.  Therefore, Gaston should be actor Gaspard Ulliel.  And the prince in his human form should be actor Fuad Ait Aaatou---actual French people who resemble the art found Disneys original Beauty and the Beast.
---Unfortunately, the mediocre remake does not follow suit. Duly, to paraphrase the character of LeFou from Disneys original Beauty and the Beast, ""Oh Well, I Guess [live action is] Not Going to Work After All"".",1468713600,,4543,4.907068062827225

I was super dissapointed when I saw that it was in the ""Disney Vault"" and not available for purchase or rent, and when I saw this ""UK import"" business I was extremely skeptical, especially after seeing some bad reviews of the disc not working on certain players and such. But, I was aching to watch this movie after my recent trip to Disney World where I met Belle. I caved and purchased the movie and I am so glad I did! This blue ray worked great on my Xbox One and the picture was incredible. The blue ray offered the extended and theatrical versions of the movie and some bonus features. It played great. The only reason I'm thinking these imports might not work on a player is if it is really old, or there's just a user error and someone is trying to play it on their plain DVD player or what have you. The only downside to purchasing one of these is that I am sure that it doesn't hold the long term value of a US released version, but if the movie itself is more important to you, I would definitely recommend.

584445,5,6303142346,"Beauty and the Beast is a wondrous product of classic animation combined
with CGI.  It played in theaters for 48 weeks, grossing $144.8 million and
earning a Best Picture Oscar nomination.  It is the only film to date that has
claimed such an honor.  The making of the film took 4 longs years with more
than 600 animators.  The end is result is clearly one of the most ""magical""
animated pictures of our time.

Beauty and The Beast was the second film to use the Computer Animation
Production System (CAPS) developed by Pixar.  This resulted in animation
that was trulygroundbreaking for its time,  providing sweeping camera movements
against three-dimensional backgrounds.

The story is about a selfish prince (voiced by Robby Benson), who lives
in an enchanted castle.  After turning away an old beggar woman, the
prince is transformed into a beast.  Given only an enchanted rose, he
is told that if he can learn to love another, and earn the same in return
by the time the last petal falls, the spell would be broken.

The story is also about a girl named Belle (voice by Paige O'Hara),
who is widely adored by the people in her small town, particularly that
of an arrogant Gaston (voiced by Richard White) who wishes to make
her his wife.  One day, upon searching for her missing father, Belle
arrives at the castle where she finds him imprisoned for trespassing.
Belle strikes a bargain with the Beast:  if he releases her father, she
will stay with him.

To prevent the film from becoming overly dark, the film introduces
us to the film's most lovable characters, the castle staff, who have
also fallen under an evil spell.  They include Mrs. Potts (Angela
Lansbury), Lumiere (Jerry Orbach), Cogsworth (David Ogden Stiers)
and Chip (Bradley Pierce) who urge the young Belle to ""Be our
Guest,"" in one of the film's most memorable songs.

Speaking of which, Beauty and the Beast features what could
be perhaps be the most spectacular score written for any Disney
film with music written by Alan Menken and lyrics by Howard Ashman
(who passed away shortly before the movie opened in 1991). The
film's title song won the Academy Award for the Best Original category.

What more can be said about this film's transfer than being
absolutely magnificent?  Here is a flawless presentation with images
that are breathtakingly striking and a color palette that is remarkably
vibrant.  The painted backgrounds look absolutely stunning here. Of
course, all of this beauty would not be possible if not for the high
definition clarity that only the Blu-ray format could provide.

Having just witnessed the wonderful job the stenographers did with
the 3D conversion of The Lion King, I went into this film with high
expectations.  My only concern was that it was announced in January
of 2010 that the 3D theatrical release of Beauty and The Beast would
be indefinitely postponed after the studio spent millions on the conversion.

Upon just completing viewing this new 3D release, I can confidently say that
I don't see any technical issues with the conversion.  In fact, like
The Lion King, I find that Beauty and The Beast benefits greatly from
the enhancements it has been given.  Take for instance the film's
opening musical number where Belle is greeted ""Bonjour!"" by the townspeople.
The best way to describe the appearance of this scene would be if one
opened a pop-up book and discovered its perimeter lined with cut-outs
of villagers with a horse and carriage sitting squarely in the middle. The
scene is very effective in establishing depth, though the deepness
between foreground and background seems more subdued than animated
films that are specifically formulated for the format.  The animators who
worked on this project starting in 2007 simulated the 3D environment by
giving various characters, props and effects the impression of volume.  In
seemingly more ways than The Lion King, the animators had a lot of
props to play with.  Take for instance the scene where Belle's father is
lost in the woods.  The animators put emphasis on having the characters
placed behind eerie tree branches and wind-swept leaves that take the
forefront of action giving a real sense of foreboding danger. To give you
an idea of how character sizing is used , one needs only to look at the
scene where Cogsworth is giving Belle a tour of the castle.  As the tiny
clock walks down a long hallway lined with suits of armor, you really get
nice sense of deep depth.  I can just imagine how the castle became
a virtual playground for the animation team who put emphasis in bringing
the goth statues and hanging chandeliers to the forefront.  Falling snow
and rain also do well here, taking on a life of their own as the action plays
out beneath it.  Even a more subdued effect featuring a sprinkling salt
shaker in the musical number, ""Be Our Guest,"" is quite effective.  The
infamous ballroom dance scene is enhanced with the 3D process as the
chandelier becomes a more prominent centerpiece as the camera swoops
down the staircase.  Even the long glass ballroom windows with their star-filled
sky backdrop looks more lifelike then ever before.  Don't expect anything to
leap or poke out from the screen.  There wasn't any moment that anything
extended beyond the borders of the display

The only minor problems that exist here, hardly worth mentioning,
is a bit of noticeable aliasing in the quick movements of the animation.
I think I only noticed it briefly here and there.  Ghosting is essentially
nonexistent -- only really saw it in Lumiere's character during the ""Be
Our Guest"" number, outlining his candle figure.

The Blu-ray's 7.1 DTS-HD Master Audio mix (downcoverted to 5.1 on
my system) is the perfect compliment to the film's pristine video.  With
clear dialogue firmly fixed across the center channels and the rears bringing
up the film's score and effects, the mix becomes an engulfing experience
for the viewer.  As one would hope, LFE support is immense here, particularly
during the beast's roar or the rain and thunder that underscore the film's final
climatic battle scene.

Beauty and The Beast arrives as a 4-disc set with Blu-ray 3D, Blu-ray 2D,
DVD and Digital Copy housed in lenticular packaging.  The 2D Blu-ray
boasts three versions of the film (original theatrical, special extended and
original storyboard version).  There are deleted scenes, an alternate opening,
featurettes on the digital restoration as well as Broadway Beginnings (to name
just a few).

Beauty and The Beast remains a captivating, enchanting tale
with the some of the most memorable music and lovable
characters ever brought to the animated screen. I'll say the same
thing about this conversion as I did for The Lion King....it looks
like a labor of love from the animators that worked so diligently on it.
I actually prefer the 3D on Beauty of The Beast more for the fact
that there are so many more props to work with.

There are those that just won't tolerate a 2D film that has been
re-imagined for 3D.  I can't blame people for feeling that way when
in the past, studios have done a rather sloppy job in the the
conversion process.  It's very clear that in the case of Disney,
real thought and care was put into the project. It's just astounding
to see a piece of artwork like this brought to new life by the depth
that 3D provides.  It's an effort truly deserving of the stamp
Disney puts on it.

No hesitation recommending Beauty and The Beast on 3D Blu-ray.",1453075200,,7452,4.8383280757097795

So, I was really happy to see this UK import blu-ray version. While DVDs can't play other region DVDs, there aren't regions to blu-rays, so I knew that she could watch the disc without a problem.

585010,5,6303142346,"3D Quality:
Beauty and The Beast is a quality 3D film right from the start. The opening view of the forest gave me a sensation comparable to that that I've felt opening up a pop-up book as a kid. It was beautiful and I couldn't take my eyes off. The depth and dimension is fully realized and it's evident right from the very start that you're in for a real treat. The rest of the film isn't a let down either. There's so much to take in. The intricate details throughout every scene, the expansiveness of the castle, the contrasting size of the rather cramped tavern/pub, the separate space characters and objects alike now take up. They've even given the rain proper depth (something The Lion King's 3D release seemed to miss). They've managed to transform a rather two-dimensional animated film into a three-dimensional playground. If you're looking for a 3D release that takes you to another world, you've surely found it here with Beauty and the Beast 3D.

I caught no instances of crosstalk/ghosting on my system using active shutter glasses. Nothing ruining the quality of the image.

Pop-outs:
This is not the film where you're going to have images popping out of the screen consistently. There are little to no pop-outs here and this comes as expected. It is a re-release after all. Anything that popped out was rather minimal and not very noticeable. The rain scene during the final fight is the best moment for pop-outs with rain seeming to extend outward.

Overall Picture Quality:
Beauty and the Beast was a beautiful looking animated film even on VHS, but it's never looked any better on Blu-ray and 3D Blu-ray. This rather aged film is showing none of those years. It looks as if it was released just recently. It's gorgeous in HD.

Overall - Is it worth it's now premium price?
At the time of this review, this 3D release is no longer available in stores and prices have risen to about double the original cost. I purchased this at about $60 used and I do believe it was worth the money for me.

Is it any better than the many 3D films you can get at less than half this price? This really depends on you. For me, it was the classic 2D animation style being turned into a 3D world that did it for me. It's different from the norm. There's something special about seeing the image come to life like this.
If you're not completely into the film itself, I would say you're best off skipping this. If you enjoy the film, go for it!

Beauty and the Beast 3D is no cheap buy anymore, but that was not enough to stop me from entirely enjoying this purchase. With gorgeous visuals and a beautifully realized 3D world, you're going to want to relive the magic all over again. 5/5!",1439424000,,2686,4.527835051546392

Film looks and sound amazing on bluray.
At the $20.00 price it is a bargain compared to the 3 disc Diamond Edition.
Plays with absolutely no problems, I live in the USA.
Also, both versions of the movie are on this single disc,
the original theatrical release and the special edition, which includes the scene and song, "" Still Human "".
The only reason I gave it 4 stars was that the ending credits were not in High Definition .
They did not even have a decent DVD appearance to them.
I just cant figure why they were not done in HD along with the rest of the film.
Anyway, the accompanying Beauty and the Beast song duet still sounds great, even if the the visual ending credits look poor.",1439251200,,743,4.314285714285714

585333,3,6303142346,"Even when I was a child I sensed something was wrong with this movie.  I'm not a kid anymore, and I know the original story now.

In the original version Bell's father was a successful merchant. He'd been returning from a business trip when he encountered the Beast's home.  Bell has several sisters, all who care about nothing but clothes, parties, and boys.  Bell was a sweet natured and inexperienced girl. The beast was cursed by an evil sorceress. When human he'd been strong, noble, and a good ruler.  The original story was a coming of age story, where Bell learns to love the Beast.

In this movie the prince was an arrogant and heartless man.  He was punished by a beautiful enchantress.  Also the prince's servant's shared his curse, they suffered for his crimes.  Bell's father was a tiny, weak, and crazy man.  He wasn't a merchant but an inventor, creating useless inventions.  Bell was an only child, and already knew what she wanted

Bell's whole state of mind was about escaping the small town she saw as a trap.  Gaston wasn't in the original version.  He was added to show marriage as a trap.  To have Bell shocked and outraged over the concept of being his wife.  To show the other girls in the town as silly and stupid for wanting to be his.  Gaston also has several scenes with other guys, showing them all as crude, plotting, and disgusting.

The Beast's scenes where quite few. Most of the story was about Bell and the servants, Bell and her father, Bell and Gestan. The Beast slowly becomes exactly what Bell was looking for, at the end he physically becomes her perfect match. This movie wasn't really Beauty and the Beast, it mainly just Beauty.

The animation and songs were spectacular, but PC destroyed the story.",1434844800,,1742,4.615635179153094

There are thousands on Amazon already (that I promptly ignore anyway in favor of movie review sites). Instead I'm reviewing the disk. Yes, this is a UK Blu-ray. However, when you receive it you'll see it is a region free disk. Blu-ray's are divided into 3 geographical regions. A, B, and C. The US is in A whereas the UK is in B. However, there is a little icon on the back that looks like three hexagons with an A, B, and C in them. This means the disk will play in any region of the world. I am in the US and I had no problems with playing the disk in my Blu-ray player.

I also read people saying they received counterfeit discs. Well, I can't say what others received, but I received what appears to be a genuine Disney Blu-ray. The case, jacket, and disc itself all appeared high quality and original. As far as languages go, yes the disc includes many languages but the first one in the list was English. I don't really mind that it also has a Hindi audio track as long as English is on there.

585881,2,6303142346,"I got the 2-disc DVD of Beauty and the Beast, because it was a lot cheaper than getting the blu-ray at the time. I started watching it on my HDTV using my blu-ray player... The quality was so bad I literally stopped watching it and watched Aladdin on DVD instead!! For whatever reason, the mastering of the 2-disc Beauty and the Beast DVD is extremely poor. It's very grainy and looks to me to be about the same quality as VHS. I have at least 20 Disney movies on DVD, and found that they all are much higher quality than this release of Beauty and the Beast, which is a 2010 release... so I don't know why it would be worse than the others. The Aladdin release is 2004, so you would think that would be worse.

The point of this is simply to say if you like high quality picture, PLEASE OPT TO GET THIS MOVIE ON BLU-RAY. The blu-ray release is superb!! Shame on Disney for making such a poor quality DVD.",1425168000,,905,4.2011494252873565

I know this was based on a French story, but it's not a story I like. It does have a happy ending, however, but first there are a lot of troubles the two main characters have to go through; they almost don't make it. I found this story to be very dark and the Gaston character is one whom you love to hate, particularly near the end. People think this movie is so great but hate ""The Black Cauldron,"" when in reality, I was far more concerned about this particular movie; there's a lot more darkness here in the characters of the Beast and Gaston than in the characters of the other movie.

It helps to illuminate the mercenary nature of everyone needing the Beast to be human again (so that they too can return to normal).  It wasn't an altruistic motive, it was a human one.

FILM FACT Part Four: Beauty and the Beast was the second film, after The Rescuers Down Under, produced using CAPS [Computer Animation Production System], a digital scanning, ink, paint, and compositing system of software and hardware developed for Disney by PIXAR. In addition, CAPS allowed easier combination of hand-drawn art with computer-generated imagery, which before had to be plotted to animation paper and then Xeroxed and painted traditionally. This technique was put to significant use during the ""Beauty and the Beast"" waltz sequence, in which Belle and the Beast to dance through a computer-generated ballroom as the camera dollies around them in simulated 3D space. The filmmakers had originally decided against the use of computers in favour of traditional animation, but later, when the technology had improved, decided it could be used for the one scene in the ballroom. The success of the ballroom sequence helped convince studio executives to further invest in computer animation.

Andrew's Blu-ray Review: There is something about 'Beauty and the Beast' that resonates deep inside. It transcends children's animation and becomes something much more. When I think 'Beauty and the Beast' I immediately think of Disney. It's a connection without question that has become synonymous.

'Beauty and the Beast' is full of excitement, an enthralling story, and some of the most memorable musical numbers to ever grace the big screen. There isn't a song on 'Beauty and the Beast' that can possibly be ignored. Each one demands your attention as they shower you with nostalgic memories of Disney's hand drawn animation heyday.

Because he refused to give refuge to a haggard-looking woman, a young prince has been cursed, transformed into a hideous beast, and his entire staff of servants changed into living inanimate objects, like clocks and candlesticks. Like many of these stories go, the curse can only be broken by true love.

Belle is a beautiful young girl who lives in the neighbouring town. She loves reading, breaks into song on a moment's notice, and lives with her kooky father Maurice. Belle is a curious creature, and has her head on straight when it comes to life. The town macho, Gaston, has his eye on her. Gaston boasts about how many eggs he eats every day and how accurate his spitting is, because he is a real man's man. Only a manly man would use antlers in all of his decorating. Gaston is sure that Belle is going to marry him, who wouldn't want to marry him? He's the finest male specimen around.

Belle's father Maurice is an inventor, and on his way to a fair to show off his new invention he gets lost and finds himself at the steps of a strange castle and it's interesting that this castle has been there for some time, and the townspeople are only now realising it. Maurice is imprisoned by the beast. Once Belle realises he's missing, she goes out looking for him, finds the castle, and trades herself for her father's life. We know what must happen from here. Belle must embark on the seemingly impossible quest of loving a beast. But compared to Gaston, the beast is a catch.

In a day and age when computer animation is all the rage, it's amazing to revisit 'Beauty and the Beast' and see just how beautiful hand drawn animation can be. The animation here is some of the most colourful and lively in all of Disney's long line of animated features. The music, created by Howard Ashman and Alan Menken which is the same duo that worked together on 'The Little Mermaid,' which in some cases has not only stayed in our minds ever since this animation film was released. But to this day, ""Be Our Guest"" still pops up in my head continually, as it has now gone into the annuls of popular musical song culture.

Nowadays, with the Ten Best Picture slots at the Oscars, it's much easier for animated films to find their way into the awards picture. Back when 'Beauty and the Beast' was made, it was unthinkable that a children's animated feature could be nominated for Best Picture. 'Beauty and the Beast' is a classic fairy tale, and with Disney's touch, it has become one of the most memorable and influential animated features of all time.

3D Blu-ray Video Quality  For this 3D release, 'Beauty and the Beast' is presented in a stunning encoded 1080p image transfer in the 1.78:1 aspect ratio. Painstakingly converted, this is an absolutely stunning experience that opens the film up in new and exciting ways. To be perfectly honest, I am a huge supporter of 3D, but always sceptical about conversions of already existing 2D films, so I went into this release with some pretty strong reservations. With that in mind, for those who admit that they feel this 3D Blu-ray disc might have a sceptical stance, well dont, as overall, the 3D video image is simply outstanding and totally gorgeous and is wonderfully bold and rich colours light up the screen from the moment the film starts, and it does not let up until the credits role at the end of the animation film. Detail is exceptional, showing off the intricately designed characters and locations, from cosy towns and spooky woods to Baroque castles and lush countryside's, revealing every stroke of the animators' hard work. Of course the real focus of this release is the 3D effect. So, how does it look? Well, with the exception of a few minor snags here and there, it's quite stunning, essentially offering a pristine window into a beautiful storybook world. Depth is also fantastic, separating the various planes of the frame into distinct layers that still work organically together. While there certainly is a pop-up book quality to the presentation, and in this case that's not a bad thing, the 3D effect gives a slight curvature to the 2D characters and objects, making them feel a little more spatially rounded than completely flat. Wide shots tend to look the most striking, offering an immense perception of distance between foreground objects and background locations. Swirling leaves, soaring birds, and flying bats all provide some nice pop-out moments that extend slightly outward from the screen. Various forms of precipitation are particularly impressive, and a few shots that start indoors and then slowly track out into the falling snow feature a great amount of immersion. Even comparatively subtle moments, like a scene where Belle holds a flower and blows the petals away, causing them to dance inward and outward around the screen, are a treat to behold. All of the major set-pieces, including the playful ""Be our Guest"" performance, and the beloved title track sequence set in an extravagant ballroom, utilise just the right amount of subtlety and you definitely get those ""wow"" moments. Of course nothing really compares to the climax, which features the townspeople storming the Beast's castle and with a constant flow of rain drenching the foreground and splashes of lightning electrifying the frame, the moody atmosphere is taken to an entirely new level thanks to the 3D effect. All of the visuals swell with the rousing music in a way that simply couldn't happen in 2D Blu-ray version alone. While this is a wonderful transfer, there are some very minor issues. There are a couple of instances in which the converted effects feel slightly unnatural or where proportions of distance between different parts of characters or objects feels a little off. Also, in some rare instances where there is a lot of detail, activity, and motion all at once, the image can get a little jumbled and a bit disorienting. Ghosting is also present, but it is negligible and mostly occurs when there is a dark object in the foreground, plus various statues in the Beast's castle, for example. All of these issues are really very minor and I thought I had better point out these minor flaws; however, it does not detract from what is otherwise a beautiful flawless 3D conversion.

Blu-ray Audio Quality  Disney went back to the source with original sound mixer Terry Porter, who was nominated for Best Sound in 1999, and created an all-new 7.1 mix. After creating a 7.1 mix for the originally mono-track 'Snow White' and making it sound superb, I had no reservations that Disney would be able to take 'Beauty and the Beast' and remix it to perfection. In short, they have. I can't think of a Disney's film library that could benefit more from a 7.1 mix than 'Beauty and the Beast.' There's so much going on, and the musical numbers alone demand a mix that can support their sheer size and spectacle. Dialogue is spread throughout the front part of the sound field, even finding its way into the side speakers for some stellar directionality that caused me to turn my head more than once. The Beast's voice is full of life, and the sub gets a heavy workout during his numerous yells and roars. Frankly, it's so deep and resonant; it's what you also experience with the film 'Jurassic Park' and its awesome T-Rex. The rear of the sound field is almost just as busy as the front. There isn't a time where the rears aren't at the least engaged. The musical numbers bring the surround sound to life as the characters sing and dance, engulfing you in this stunning Disney 3D Blu-ray. The Sound effects are pristine, pans sound perfect. This is one of the best high definition sound presentations of the year, if not the best. Everything from the crystal clear dialogue and song lyrics to the chaotic cacophony of sounds that accompany the great battle scene at the end are perfectly remixed to give us the most wondrous sound design 'Beauty and the Beast' has ever enjoyed on home video.

Blu-ray Special Features and Extras:

Beauty and the Beast: 3D Version [1080p] [85:00]

Beauty and the Beast: Special Extended Version [1080p] [92:00] The biggest, and most notable change to the animation film here is the addition of the originally cut musical number called ""Human Again."" It has been seamlessly inserted into the film.

Beauty and the Beast: Original Theatrical Release [1080p] [85:00] This is being included in the special features, because there are a few versions of the film you can watch. This is how the animation film was originally appeared in cinemas when it was first released.

Beauty and the Beast: Original Theatrical Release [with Story reel Picture-in-Picture] Fans can view the theatrical cut alongside the filmmakers' original story reel, an incredibly early version of the film that features rough animation, hand-drawn storyboards and other preproduction artwork.

Audio Commentary [Special Edition Only] Commentary with Producer Don Hahn and co-directors Kirk Wise and Gary Trousdale: They all discuss the Special Extended Edition of `Beauty and the Beast' and waste little time in doing so. The trio dissect the story and characters, the animation techniques utilised throughout the film, its place in Disney history, the dialogue and songs, casting and the voice recording sessions, the challenges they faced during its long and complex production and much, much more. It's a thoroughly engaging and informative track that should not be missed. It's one of the better audio commentaries out there. Never does it feel dry or mundane. These guys get down to business and discuss everything you could hope to be discussed about the animation film.

Special Feature: Sing-Along Track: The Special Extended cut even offers a text-based ""Sing-Along Mode"" for anyone interested in belting out a Disney tune or two in the privacy of their own home.

Special Feature: Broadway Beginnings: Backstage Disney [Diamond Edition] [1994] [1080p] [13:00] This TV Special has a string of name-that-face celebrities, production team members and stage actors wax poetic about the Broadway adaptation of the film. And the contributors we hear from to this TV Special are Alan Irwin Menken, Tim Miles Rice, Howard Elliott Ashman, Linda Irene Woolverton, Michael Dammann Eisner, Terrence Matt Mann, Anna Menken, Aiden Meren, Janis Menken, Nora Menken, Evan Marden, Helena Marden, Evelina Marden, Ariana Marden, Liana Marden, Matilda Ashman, Emma Meren, Eva Ashman and Audrey Bella Lavine.

Special Feature: Family Play: Looking for yet another way to watch Beauty and the Beast'? In a fit of overkill, the wizards at Disney have also devised a ""Fast Play Mode"" that allows users to customise and automate their viewing experience based on time and specific interests. It's rather extraneous, but I'm sure someone will enjoy it. Don't like it? Move along then, there's plenty of other content on tap.

Special Feature: Music and More: Music Video ""Beauty and the Beast"" performed by Jordin Sparks [1080p] [3:26] You get to see the singer Jordin Sparks, combined with selections from the Disney animation. Bet you thought that there wouldn't be another music video tacked on, but there is!

Special Feature: Composing A Classic: A Musical Conversation with Alan Menken, Don Hahn and Richard Kraft [1080p] [20:00] Composer  Alan Menken, music agent and Disney historian Richard Kraft, and producer Don Hahn chat at length about the film's rousing songs and musical score, as well as the art of furthering a story through music.

Deleted Scene: Alternate Story Opening for `Beauty and the Beast' [1080p] [28:00] Former Walt Disney Studios chairman Peter Schneider introduces a sprawling alternate opening and pieced together from a studio story reel created before the official voice actors were cast, and story supervisor Roger Allers does the same for a deleted scene and composed of storyboards, involving Belle's exploration of the Beast's library.

Sneak Previews: Cars 2 3D [Blu-ray]; Lady and the Tramp [Diamond Edition] [Blu-ray]; Cinderella [Diamond Edition] [Blu-ray]; Disney Nature: Chimpanzee [Blu-ray] and Disney's Secret of the Wings [Blu-ray].

Finally, Disney has done it again. The Blu-ray edition of `Beauty and the Beast' was already amazing; but this 3D Blu-ray release of `Beauty and the Beast' is nothing short of astonishing. This 3D version gives viewers an impressive new way to experience this stunning animation film that actually enhances the original content through some wonderfully immersive 3D effects. Like its 2010 predecessor, it stands as both a must-have release and a solid contender for the studio's best Blu-ray release of the year. Yes, even though it's arguably a mere re-issue of sorts. Fans will be treated to three full versions of the classic animated film, two reference-level video transfers, an immersive 3D experience, a monstrous 7.1 DTS-HD Master Audio surround track, and hours upon hours of special features including a Picture-in-Picture Story reel presentation, a filmmakers audio commentary, a three-hour branching documentary and much, much more. Without hesitation or clarification, `Beauty and the Beast' in 3D earns my unabashed highest ultimate praise. Very Highly Recommended!

586430,5,6303142346,"Beauty And The Beast is one of my personal favorite Disney animated films. Its timeless theme about love and kindness appeals not only to children but to adults likewise.

The story centers around a prince who is transformed into a Beast and a young woman named Belle whom he imprisons in his castle. Belle is a girl who is dissatisfied with life in a small provincial French town, constantly trying to fend off the misplaced ""affections"" of conceited Gaston. A wrong turn taken by Maurice, Belle's father, causes the two to meet. To become a prince again, the Beast must love Belle and win her love in return, or he will remain a Beast forever. A wrong turn taken by Maurice, Belle's father, causes the two to meet.

Narrated by Mia Farrow, who also supplies all the character voices, this half-hour animated version of Beauty and the Beast was originally a component of ""Stories to Remember"", an internationally syndicated package of children's story adaptations. Aside from that,it features great music such as the ""Beauty and the Beast"" theme performed by C&eacute;line Dion and Peabo Bryson,""Be Our Guest"",""Beauty and The Beast (tale as old as time)"",""Belle"" and ""Something There"".Overall,this isn't merely the best of the fairy tale features but it's very close to being the best Disney movie of them all.",1416960000,,1311,4.954545454545454

Price was a little steep and is getting steeper as Disney loves making only a limited amount of their releases. It is human nature, especially these days, to take advantage of others. All in all a great remastered Disney classic. It's up to you how bad you want it as the price for a new version is rising to outrageous. I myself found this at a still readonable price that I was willing to spend. It came nicely packaged in a protective, bubbled envelope package and got to me intact with even the outside sleeve still in great condition.

586995,5,6303142346,"I've put off buying Disney movies for a long time now since it seems almost every few years - we reinvent home media and everything is re-released on the new format - but seeing as how most media is going digital today; there is a good chance Blu-Ray is the final frontier of physical media movies.

While Disney is no stranger to quality home releases the Diamond Edition series has blown me away so far. Blu-ray/DVD combo packs with Digital access from anywhere on the Disney website or mobile app? Everything you could want in one box.

The movie itself? Obvious classic, I couldn't recommend it enough so we won't even talk about that.
Focusing on this release though, the special features on this aren't super extensive but they are probably the most we've ever received in a release of Beauty and the Beast - and a must own for Disney fans of all ages.

The packaging is wonderful - I love the collections Disney puts out because they are so consistent in quality and design - each and every one of the diamond edition packages look amazing next to one another on my shelf and I feel like not enough companies put long-term thought into stuff like that.",1408320000,,1159,4.535885167464115

I especially loved how the Beast started to mature through the film and begin to care for Belle, unlike Gaston, the pig-headed monster taught us all that just because a guy is good-looking and talented in every way possible doesn't mean he's the guy to get the girl, he's more like the spoiled creep who pushes people around! There's a lesson to be learned in true love, and this movie taught it perfectly!

The movie itself plays OK on my computer but put it in the Blu ray and low and behold the picture is like a home-burned disc. The picture size is tiny (squished into the upper left hand corner) and very poor quality (maybe 480i?).

587560,2,6303142346,"Grainy picture with plenty of distortion even in slow moving and still scenes (particularly around lines and edges). Far worse than any other Disney DVD I own, but not as bad as the pitiful Land Before Time DVD transfer. I have a nice Samsung 1080p TV and a new Sony Blu-ray player which does a fine enough job upsampling DVDs, so it's not my setup that's the problem. Hard to believe Disney did such a hack job on one of the best movies they've ever made -- maybe they were already looking ahead to the future Blu-ray release? Hopefully they used better machinery for that...

And no, not everyone is going to notice or care, just like not everyone would notice or care about the difference between a 128kbps MP3 and the original CD. Clearly the bulk of these reviews demonstrate that. But for those that do, heed the warning that you'll probably be disappointed in the video quality here.",1392422400,,890,4.5625

587562,4,6303142346,"Although ""Beauty and the Beast"" is and has been my absolute favourite film since I first saw it and I have watched it by now more than twenty times and in four different languages (I already knew I would adore it after I had seen a few screenshots and heard the soundtrack), I cannot deny that it contains some inconsistencies and inadvertences which I thought a new edition could at least have moderated a bit.

For instance I immediately fell in love with the song ""Human Again"" when I heard it on the CD recording of the stage edition; but for some reason it never seems to get full credit. When I saw the play in Vienna nobody danced to this beautiful waltz melody, which I found missed a wonderful opportunity; in this edition's version there is more than enough dancing during the musical number, but the pictures and gags implemented are not quite as original as the rest, less classical and more ""childlike"" - the animation not so detailed, the colours more faded and the whole scene seems to address itself more to the children than to all viewers. The gags are for the most part silly, that the whole scene is set in spring when only shortly before the whole castle was deep in snow is illogical, and that the castle already has its ""rosy"" look, as if the spell had already been broken does not make sense either. (I would add that I never quite liked its ""rosy"" look at the end of the film - I found the idea somewhat cheap instead of romantic.)

More than that, the stage musical included a few very important dialogues which had been deleted from the film but which give a lot of depth to Belle's and the Beast's relationship, e.g. when she realizes and tells him that they are quite similar to one another despite everything because she is an outsider, too; this new edition would have been a good opportunity to implement them, but again, it was missed.
As I said, a pity! But nevertheless it is still an enchanting film and not one of the many films, Disney or other, which I have watched in the meantime has managed to even get the slightest chance to replace it as my favourite.",1391904000,,2096,4.455729166666667

587625,5,6303142346,You know the gist of the story and even how it ends more or less so the question really is is it worth the ride and this film answers with a resounding yes. Despite the cliche Disney animated musical elements we have to remember this was one of the first of the new musicals for them and they really do a great job storytelling and animating it. The 3D really makes it come alive. The sketch rough cut version is also well worth taking a look at. Highly recommend this film. Especially in 3D.,1391385600,,492,4.24468085106383

587630,5,6303142346,"Out of all the Disney princesses, Belle is the one I identify with the most while Cinderella may come as a close second. I love her. She loves books just like me and we both try to find the goodness in someone. I'm pretty sure the Beast had gotten on her nerves on few occasions. Lord knows I could really feel that. The story is not like the other princess stories where there's always love at first sight or evil villains with superpowers. It's quite different. And not all princes appeared to be very ""charming"". I don't think a villain necessarily has to have any special powers to be more effective. I think it's pretty cliche and redundant to have every villain made to be that way, but as long as there is a special motive behind it that makes them what they are in character. I think the story doesn't have to apply to just someone who tries to look inside their heart rather than their ugly exterior, but it can also applies to falling for someone who has an ugly past or has a mean streak and you are trying to see past all those things. The more I look into this story, the more I see it that way. I tend to favor movies like Beauty and the Beast and The Hunchback of Notre Dame that have a more insightful approach rather than a superficial appeal. Everything about this movie is so iconic, heartwarming, and magical. From the iconic dancing scene with Belle and the Beast to the music, the movie just wins my heart by default. Beauty and the Beast theme is one of my all time, top favorite Disney songs. The song really gets to me each time. It really gives me tingles. No other Disney princess film...before and after will ever top Beauty and The Beast!!!",1390348800,,1669,4.352564102564102

Filled with memorable songs, characters and beautiful animation. One of their most musical animated films The Beast comes to Blu Ray with one of the best transfers of any of their animated films. While not one of my personal favorites, it is a fantastic entry in Disney's impressive film cannon. The transfer to Blu Ray looks gorgeous with deep blacks and mind blowing color. A few minor quibbles, one the aspect ratio (while close) isn't quite correct, but it doesn't hurt the film, there may be some color hues that are questionable, though I'm not going to even try to remember what this film looked like over 20 years ago. Regardless of these tiny concerns the film looks amazing and is just a sight to behold.

The sound track is also bold and a huge improvement over previous editions. Plus we get three versions of the film itself. The extras are plentiful with lots of interesting goodies to keep you busy for a while. If you don't own the film, then the Blu Ray is the way to go.",1388620800,,1122,4.61

Of all the Disney Princesses, Belle is my favorite because she is brave, and strong, and she didn't need someone to save her. Belle was okay with who she was and didn't want to fit in, and I think her personality is inspiring to women across the world. She is also kind, and compassionate, who else could love a beast and give up her freedom to save her father?

587977,4,6303142346,"I was so excited to see this wonderful film now in stunning 3D.
I recently bought a Sony 3D tv only to find that my current blu ray player had to be changed to a 3d blu ray player in order to watch 3d movies.
Being in the UK the multi region 3D disc and bluray discs work fine.  However as the UK is in a different region the DVD disc is not playable unless you happen to have a multiregion player.
All in all buying from the USA is a bit expensive as I had to pay international postage and 16.00GBP  customs duty in addition to the original price.
I love this film and it is currently unavailable in 3D yet highly sought after in the UK so the extra cost was worth it.  Getting a parcel all the way from America is somehow even more exciting.  It took around 2 weeks to arrive,
3D is amazing but 3D Disney films are out of this world!

The Blu-ray/DVD combo gives you the flexibility to use it on different machines, even if currently you only have one. The best part about it is that you can choose between watching the extended edition and the original theatrical edition. The difference is mainly in the inclusion of a song called ""Human Again.""

588228,5,6303142346,"Beauty And The Beast is a Disney animated film from 1991. It is known as one of the best animated films of all time, and it is one of the only animated films to be nominated for the ''Best Picture'' Oscar.

The film is about a beautiful young woman named Belle who lives in France. She loves to read, and the townspeople find her beautiful, but strange. Her father is an inventor, and when he manages to make his new machine work, he sets off to a fair, only to get lost and become attacked by wolves. He comes across a big castle where a beast lives. The beast confronts him, and keeps him prisoner.

While this is happening, a cruel man in the town named Gaston wants Belle to marry him, only for him to get refused and humiliated in public. When Belle finds out her father is in trouble, she sets off to find him. When she reaches the castle, she begs the beast to free him, but the beast only will if she promises to stay in the castle forever. She gives him her word, and he lets her father go back to the village.

Beast is a hothead and a bully, but he is also really shy and sad. We learn that he was transformed into a beast by an enchantress, and he must learn to love someone before his 21st birthday, otherwise he will remain a beast forever.

This is a really amazing movie. The animation is beautiful, dark, and scary. When I was a kid, I actually had nightmares because of some scenes from the film. It's a really good and mature film, and the songs are extremely catchy and really funny. A superb animated film.",1373932800,,1527,4.219178082191781

588508,5,6303142346,"Beauty and the Beast was released in theaters on November 13, 1991. Beauty and the Beast mainly tell the story of a Prince who became a hideous beast because he scorned an old peasant who becomes a beautiful enchantress. The enchantress realizes that the Prince selfish, coldhearted and unkind and put a spell on the castle and the residents who live their as well. Several years have past and Belle enters his life when he takes her father captive. Belle agrees to live in the castle as the Beast prisoner in exchange for the release of her father. Over several months there grow to like each other and that is where I am going to end so I don't give away the rest of the story. Unlike other reviews I have written I have given the time length on each one; this DVD is the exception to the rule. This DVD comes with three different versions of Beauty and the Beast: Work In Progress which was released at the New York Film Festival in September of 1991, Original Theatrical Release, and the Special Edition which has the song Human Again in it. My biggest beef with this 2 Disc DVD collection is Disc 2. There is so much repetitive and overlap it is way bother a second disc. The Pencil Version of Human again is play four times. When you get to Mrs. Potts section of the DVD where you The Making of Beauty and the Beast is just and edited version of Origins of Beauty and the Beast in Cogsworth & Lumiere's Library section. Whoever put Disc 2 together must not have had it all there. The movie (all three) Beauty and the Beast is great for the whole family and gets and AAAAA+++++.

This product has a 2nd blu-ray disk just for bonus material.  One of the titles was ""Composing a Classic.""  It is a remarkable and heart-felt tribute to Howard Ashman by Alan Menken.

588587,5,6303142346,"I grew up watching Beauty and the Beast and know the story by heart. I love the story. I love the characters. And I love how the movie is just so damn good after over 20 years of it's release date. Honestly, what's not to like or love about this movie.

As for the blu-ray, the color saturation is sharper and more crisp, but it's still the same film. You have the option to watch the theatrical version (which I prefer, personally) or the extended edition that's about roughly 10 extra minutes of new scenes. The extended edition is... okay. In that version, there was a new musical scene added called ""I Can't Wait to be Human Again"". I remember seeing that in I-MAX theaters in Charleston back when I was in 7th grade. I understood the directors and other crew members of the film wanted to add that scene long ago when the movie was in production, but couldn't. Don't know why, but I still feel like the original version still holds up. I felt like the theatrical version was so perfect in its own way it didn't need anything. If added anything it would have ruined the film overall. This is my opinion, obviously, but for those who love the extended version that's fine. I just like this original piece just as it is. There's tons of new video commentaries about the making of the film, which I'm deeply fascinated to know more about the animators, directors, etc...

I also have to add this to my comment. My biggest and highest praised criticism I give to this film is the musical score of Beauty and the Beast. Alan Menken is incredibly gifted for making original musical pieces for most of the '90's disney films, like The Little Mermaid, Aladdin, The Hunchback of Notre Dame, Pochahontas, and most recently Tangled. His gift in music writing and orchestration delivers an atmostphere that brings the kid in a lot of us. Whichever movie you like that had Menken's score done to it, Beauty and the Beast not only had a great score, but also some of the most memorable, and delivering songs still adored by audiences today.

It's a great movie with great songs. What can I say except I love Beauty and the Beast and it'll forever be a movie that I'll cherish and treasure years to come.",1367452800,,2193,4.505025125628141

588623,5,6303142346,"A lot of reviewers said they weren't happy with the appearance of the film as far as colors - I didn't see anything wrong with it. It is just as I remember from watching it when I was a little girl. I had no problems with the functionality of playing the dvd and was happy with my purchase. It was definitely the real deal - not a bootlegged copy as some experienced. I am guessing that those who received a bootleg copy may have purchased it from a different seller rather than Amazon. Mine even came with the Disney Movie Rewards code, which worked fine when I entered it online. Overall a great deal, considering most Disney movies that are ""in the vault"" are significantly overpriced!",1367020800,,688,4.468253968253968

I grew up with ALL sorts of Disney flicks, including The Little Mermaid, Aladdin, etc.  Even THIS piece of forever great classic nostalgia.  The special features are just amazing, the story hits all bulls eyes, and everything else is just done incredibly.  If you grew up with this film and/or you have kids, then THIS is a great Disney film for kids and adults of ALL ages.  It's a tale as old as time, and song as old as rhyme  Beauty and the Beast: The best Disney fairytale out of all their works, in my opinion.

I bought the previous version of Beauty and the Beast on DVD.  It was very good, although it didn't have a Spanish soundtrack.  I actually prefer watching these movies in Spanish, because these were the versions that played on the movie theaters when I was little.  This version might have a slightly better image, I'm not sure, but I can choose a Spanish soundtrack now.  Since I am pretending BluRay does not exist (I don't want to buy all my movies again), I will stick with this version for a while.",1364860800,,660,4.504201680672269

I think Belle is the best character that they ever made . She's smart, beautiful (both inner and outer), compassionate and she loves books and adventure . In this movie, everybody in the village think that Belle is ""strange"" all because she always like to read and daydream but they still think she's beautiful.

- 1 Star for the Special Features Layout

The special features are laid out in a very unusual format.  Some of the special features are on the main disc with the film and the rest are on a second disc.  But there doesnt appear to be any logical explanation for why it is divided in that way.  You click on a special feature documentary and it tells you to put the other disc in.  I had to switch it back and forth several times to get though all of the special features.  Sometimes the very same menu branch was split.  There is a guide in the case that is supposed to map out the special features on both discs, but I didn't find it all that helpful.

The special features themselves are very nice, but it would have been much better if all of them (with the exception of commentaries, etc.) were on one disc.",1360108800,,990,4.212765957446808

As a teenager today, I must say I love this movie.  I appreciate that Disney gave time for Belle and the Beast to bond, as it bothered me that many of the Disney princesses would fall in love right from the start, even without knowing anything about the prince.  This movie is heartfelt, and very touching and wonderful for almost any age.  I think some little children might find some scenes (the wolves, for instance) a tad bit frightening (as I know I used to).  I am certainly saving this DVD for my children.  The songs are wonderful and the art in the movies are absolutely stunning.

589511,4,6303142346,"Even though this movie is not one of my top personal favorites, I do see why a lot of people love it. The love story is deep, emotional, and just, you know, Disney. I really enjoy Belle, she's just so beautiful. Yes yes, I know, the message is not to judge people by beauty, but she's also beautiful on the inside. She's strong-willed, independent, and does not let people drag her down. The Beast is also an enjoyable character for this love story. The villain, Gaston, matches the movie's style and message. He's handsome yet arrogant. His plot and henchman make him similar to my favorite Disney Villain, Ratigan from ""The Great Mouse Detective"" which I've seen a lot of similarites to. The music is just right for the film, the score AND the songs. The side characters are very memorable; Mrs. Potts the teapot who knows exactly right from wrong, her cute teacup son, and of course Lumiere and Cogsworth. I'm not sure if this movie was also meant to be a comedy, but Lumiere and Cogsworth's time on the screen together is the funniest of this movie. Overall, I understand it's definetly one of Disney's greatest films for good reasons.

However, I did not like it as a kid. I thought it was the 2nd scariest Disney movie in my life, behind Aladdin. The prologue was creepy, and the Beast losing his temper scared me, especially when he yells at Belle to get out of the West Wing. That scene scared me the most. And besides, kind of like Little Mermaid, I thought it was too much of a girl's movie with the fairy tale, prince and princess, true love and all that stuff. I just felt more attached to animal- ish Disney films, such as ""Lady and the Tramp"" and ""The Great Mouse Detective"", where there were no ""stereotypic themes"".

However, despite ""Beauty and the Beast"" not having the same impact on me the way it impacted everyone else, I am fairly respecting it nowadays, to watch occasionally. Still not one of my top favorites, but definitely worth watching once in a while.",1351296000,,1981,4.561797752808989

When she wasn't feeling well one Saturday my husband and I finally caved and ordered her the movie (until then she had only read the book).  We watched it with her the following Tuesday and she was elated!  A few parts were a bit too much for a three year old (some of the scenes with Gaston, the Beast), but she watched most of it without getting scared, which is saying a lot as she is a VERY nervous movie-watcher.

589570,5,6303142346,"Beauty and the Beast is another one of my favorite Disney movies.  Of course most of the Disney movies from the early nineties timeframe are some of my favorites.  I much prefer them over the Pixar creations we get now (although some of those are good as well).  There's just something about that classic animation.

Belle is a bit of a strange girl in her town.  For one, she likes to read.  For another, she's not completely enamored with Gaston, the local huntsmen who's prowess at hunting is only small compared to his overinflated ego.  But Belle is happy with her father, the inventor.  In fact, when her father gets lost on the way to a fair and ends up the prisoner of a beast in an enchanted castle, Belle loves him so much she offers herself in exchange.  She despises the beast at first, but then grows to know his true character as she stays at the castle.

The voice actors for this movie were very good.  Belle is young sounding but adventurous, the Beast is somewhat scary and can be smoother and all the servants have their own sound as well.  Which, when you think about it, is actually quite clever considering they were household items and shouldn't have had an appropriate ""sound"" to their voice at all.  So that was kind of neat how they brought out the character in regular items through the use of voice.  Even Gaston had that arrogant way about him.  I will say that I wish Belle was a bit stronger of a character.  Sure she stands up to people, but all her dreams of escaping from the area are kind of thrown away when she agrees to become a prisoner at the castle.  I guess I wanted to see her get out in the world.

The plot is a classic one though and Disney did a good job of recreating it through this movie.  The addition of the enchanted castle was a nice touch with all of the different servants doing their job as best they could.  The animation is standard, but I like that about the Disney films.  They didn't need anything fancy to tell a good story.  Although the animation involving the chandelier in the ballroom was exceptionally done, and is one of my favorite parts of the movie.  Pretty impressive for the early nineties.

Like most Disney movies, the music in this one was exceptional.  ""Tale as Old as Time"" and a good deal of the other songs are ones that stay with you.  You just can't forget the lyrics to them.  And like most Disney movies, you of course can't help but sing along.  I have some mixed feelings about the first song ""Belle"", at times I liked it because it told a story, and at other times I found it just odd.  And then there's the ""Be Our Guest"" which is just a great number because of the amount of life and fun that's put into the song.

A lovely movie that's great for the whole family.  It takes a classic tale and makes it relatable to a large group of people, of all ages.

589615,5,6303142346,"After twenty-years, this timeless Disney classic is still a beautiful film to watch and the special features on the two-disc DVD set make it even better.  Just like Bambi, I really enjoy watching the behind the scenes documentaries and learning about the creative process that goes on with the masters of Walt Disney magic: from the collaboration of a gifted writer and team of animators, to the award winning voice talents of legendary actors like Angela Lansbury, along with the innocent and soothing voices of Paige O'Hara who plays Belle and Robby Benson, best known for his voice over work on the animated TV series The Legend of Prince Valiant whom of course lends his talents to the heart and soul of the Beast.  One of my favorite behind the scenes segments on the DVD was ""Composing a Classic"" which involves a meeting with the film's composer Alan Menken taking a memorable look back at the process of creating a fitting musical score for the film while working alongside executive producer, the late Howard Ashman, whom was intensely involved in monitoring songs among other aspects of the project.  Sadly, Howard Ashman passed away just shy of the film's groundbreaking release, Beauty and the Beast would forever be remembered as his last film.
 The special edition DVD also has an alternate beginning that was originally scrapped early during pre production.  Looking at it now in comparison to the finished product, I can see why the folks at Disney decided to go against the writer's original film plot and redo everything from scratch.  All kidding aside, it was the best decision they could have made at that time.  Watching the movie on DVD with digitally re-mastered picture and sound adds to the magical experience.  I can remember seeing it for the first time with my twin brother and my Dad in the theatre when I was a kid.  Even now after so many years, it's still an absolute joy to watch.  Beauty and the Beast is a wonderful story that people of all ages will enjoy.  The film brings to light an important message about love and acceptance.  There are those few moments in life where people have to realize that it's okay to let someone into your heart even if they're completely different from the rest of us.",1340668800,,2237,4.751937984496124

589695,5,6303142346,"The best of the recent (OK, relatively recent) Disney animated fairy tales. We have returned to the fully shaded, detailed art work, and only the insufferable Gaston is angular in style. This is full of the little touches that make Disney stories so fine for both children and adults, like jokes that mean one thing to the kid and quite another to the adult. Cute characters like Chip (a chipped tea cup) who are also clever and resourceful, and an enchanted prince who, when finally the spell is broken, is truly handsome.

Belle is bored with her Provencal little town where nothing changes, reads books of romantic fantasies, and longs for more than ""this provincial life."" But she loves her father, an eccentric inventor who is generally thought crazy, but who actually makes things that work. While he goes off to the science fair to exhibit his latest device, Belle is pestered by the most egotistical, arrogant, idiotic muscle-head in the village: Gaston, who considers Belle the only girl in town who is worthy of his greatness. He refers to her as lucky that he has decided to make her his wife. Belle strongly disagrees.

Meanwhile, Papa is set upon by wolves, his horse runs away in fear, and he seeks refuge in an isolated castle that just happens to be enchanted. The prince was turned into a beast because he was rude to a witch (let that be a warning to you all, fellahs), and his entire staff was turned into household objects. Not inanimate objects, mind you, but ones that retain their basic personalities while becoming wood and metal and porcelain. My favorite is Lumiere, the maitre d, a candelabra with a very smooth style and an illuminating personality.

Belle comes looking for her father, and offers herself as a hostage in exchange for him. Lumiere, Cogsworth (a clock) and Mrs. Potts (the tea pot, of course) try to get Beast to control his temper and be nice to the girl, hoping that she will fall in love with him and break the spell. It has a time limit: a magic rose is wilting, and someone must love him before the last petal falls.

Of course it all works, but exactly how it all comes about is marvelous. Look for some pretty biting social satire in the march of the villagers up to the Beast's castle to kill him. You may find yourself remembering a few lines from ""Hotel California."" I did.

Yes, of course share this with your kids and grandkids. It's a lovely story, and worth watching over and over to catch further nuances.",1336608000,,2464,4.616438356164384

Fine - but in the Diamond (20th Anniversary) Edition couldn't they have said and ""now his voice is used on everything...the menu's...etc.  I mean, come'on - he actually performed ""Be Our Guest"" at the Oscars.

589886,3,6303142346,"I missed the recent re-release of ""The Lion King"" in 3-D. So, I made a concerted effort to catch ""Beauty and the Beast"" for it's 3-D re-release. Although both films are great, I like ""Beauty and the Beast"" more, so I made a greater effort.

In the late 80s, a new management team at Disney helped lead the venerable studio to a renaissance of animated films. An almost bankrupt institution, Disney found enormous financial and creative success with ""The Little Mermaid"", leading a string of popular animated films. ""Beauty and the Beast"", originally released in 1991, became the first, and so far only, animated film to be nominated for an Oscar for Best Film.

The film is a magical blend of terrific storytelling, beautiful animation, wonderful music and great voice acting. Watching the film again, I found my foot unconsciously waving in the air during ""Be Our Guest"". The film is a classic

A vain prince refuses to provide shelter and air to a haggard old woman on a stormy night. She reveals herself to be a beautiful witch and places a curse on the prince, his castle and everything inside. The prince is turned into a beast and his staff become the household objects they used in their daily chores. Beast (Robby Benson) must find true love by his 21st birthday in order to lift the spell.

Belle (Paige O'Hara) is not like the other girls in her small French village. And this is exactly why the muscle bound Gaston (Richard White) wants her so badly. Belle's father, a scatterbrained inventor, gets lost in the woods and becomes the prisoner of the Beast. When Belle realizes this, she offers herself in exchange and what begins as a tormented relationship slowly begins to evolve.

Miss Potts (Angela Lansbury), Cogswoth (David Ogden-Stiers) and Lumiere (Jerry Orbach), the Beast's household staff watch with hopeful eyes.

From the opening frames, as the camera moves in on Beast's castle, the 3-D is beautiful, bringing the landscapes to life, giving them new beauty. In fact, the 3-D works best on the landscapes.

The process is more problematic for the characters. As you watch Belle or Beast move around, it almost seems like the focus of the 3-D effect is moving, as though the filmmakers added a bubble and moved it around to create the effect.

This actually began to make my eyes water and get tired very quickly. Pretty soon, I stopped trying to pay attention to the 3-D, to give my eyes some relief, and tried to enjoy the movie. It was difficult, but not impossible.

Because ""Beauty and the Beast"", and so many of the other films being re-released soon were not originally made in 3-D, it seems they will experience a similar fate. The process will work sometimes, but not consistently.

So, the question becomes ""Is it worth paying $15 plus to see a film in theaters that is already available on DVD?"" This depends on the film. I feel my money was well spent.

But next time, I'll go to a 2-D screening so I can experience the classic on the big screen again.",1327536000,,2986,4.690248565965583
589887,5,6303142346,"***This review may contain spoilers.***

Disney's ""Beauty and the Beast"" (hereafter B&B) is an uncontested masterpiece (and anyone who dares contest its greatness is, in my opinion, a brainless, heartless fool). Every criterion by which we judge movies (cinematography, score, characterization, plot, etc.) is flawless.  B&B is a supreme illustration of what I like to call ""The Hamlet Syndrome"", where a work has been analyzed so frequently and so favorably, one despairs of finding something new to say about it.  What I wish to concentrate upon is certainly not new either, but I believe is the central theme of B&B - true happiness and love can only come from overcoming selfishness and thinking of others.

The Prince was a beast long before the crone placed him under her monstrous spell (why she placed the Prince's entourage and household servants under a similar spell seems a bit unclear to me; perhaps their unquestioning devotion to him deserved punishment as well).  The Prince's handsome demeanor hid a haughty selfish soul. In any event, only if the Beast exchanges and receives true love will the spell be dissolved, AND before a rose (the traditional symbol of love) loses all its petals.

This task will not be easy.  The Beast wrathfully imprisons the inventor Maurice merely for seeking shelter without permission in his rococo, gloomy castle.  He reveals a trace of mercy when he agrees to free Maurice provided his beautiful bibliophile daughter Belle agrees to take his place.  Belle (the name means beauty) consents UNCONDITIONALLY, which makes her unselfish choice more noble and sets a good example for the Beast.  Subsequent events do not go smoothly, of course, as Belle is repelled, not so much by the Beast's appearance as by his domineering, crass, uncouth manner.  At length, Belle has had enough and flees into the wintry wilderness, where she is set upon by a ravenous pack of wolves.  The Beast arrives in time to save Belle but is grievously wounded in the attempt.  Belle nurses him back to health and thanks him for saving his life.  The Beast has performed a self-serving act, to be sure, but he is certainly becoming less selfish than before.  His prospects improve.

Little by little, friendship grows between Belle and the Beast.  He becomes more caring, solicitous, and gentlemanly.  The friendship culminates in their spectacular waltz in the central hall rotunda.  Could this be it?  Ah, but Belle asks to view the Beast's magic mirror, which can show the viewer anyone they wish to see.  The mirror shows her father Maurice on his sickbed.  She implores the Beast to let her see him.  Sorrowfully, but gallantly, the Beast agrees.  Feeling that she might not return, the Beast gives her the mirror so that she can always see and remember him whenever she wishes.  This is the Beast third act of mercy, and his best act because he sacrifices his own happiness for that of another.

Bell nurses her father back to health.  Unfortunately, Maurice has informed the townsfolk about the Beast, and Gaston, the dashing but boastful and unsuccessful suitor for Belle's affections, becomes dangerously jealous.  Lividly eager to locate the Beast's whereabouts, he finds out by wresting the mirror away from Belle, and organizes the townsfolk for an assault on the Beast's castle.  Belle races back to the castle to warn the Beast, but is too late.  Gaston finds the Beast, who is too despondent to fight back.  Gaston is about to deliver the coup de grace, but the Beast sees that Belle has come back to him.  He seizes Gaston and is about to fling him from the battlements, but his newly-awaken better nature spares Gaston's life - a fourth selfless gesture.  Treacherous ingrate Gaston stabs him in the side but the villain loses his balance and falls anyway.

The Beast is dying, but Belle tearfully declares her true love for him, before the last petal falls.  The Beast gloriously transforms into his human self.  Belle, who knows better than to be fooled by superficial appearance, peers into the Prince's eyes, the traditional window to the soul.  They are the same as the Beast's, and they eventually have a triumphant wedding.

The end credits of B&B state that the Beast finds his soul.  As the movie incrementally demonstrates, he did so by following the Christian tenet - to find your soul, you must lose your soul in service towards the greater good of helping others.",1327536000,,4418,4.910931174089069

If you love this movie as much as I do I would definitely buy this version even if I didn't have all of the technology to watch it.

589904,2,6303142346,"I tried, but my measurement with the Disney animation films yardstick began with the superior Sleeping Beauty, of which this does not compare. Noisy, brash, contemptible, and saddled with a hero who is repulsive. Plus there are positively no characters I care for, and belle looks typical until she enters the ""enchanted castle"" for a much needed makeover. I never cared for the beast, or his situation, one he was cursed with not because he was a victim, but because he deserved it in the first place. When Belle finally announces her love for the beast, I ask myself why. Why, indeed, if not just to give this film a much needed happy ending on cue from the running time since the beginning of the film, because there is no other explanation for her sudden burst of romance after his long bouts of yelling, eating like a pig, and nasty behavior. The hero does not find favor in my eyes, and love doesn't hand out it's hand to every tom, dick, and harry just because they are cast in the right position.

For me the 3D only makes an almost perfect movie even better.  The 3D adds obvious dimension to an already ""3D"" story and animation.  Is it needed?  Absolutely not!

The storyline is a classic.  Who doesn't love a strong woman who stands up for her family, rejects the bully, and sees the good in someone that most of us would avoid?  The supporting characters make the movie even more lovable, and the songs will be sung for generations to come.

The picture quality has obviously been improved with the new release which makes it all the more enjoyable.  As a Beauty and the Beast afficionado, I spent hours with the special features.

There are about 45 out of screen effects that extend about 10% of the way, from the screen to the viewer and another 17 around 25%. Most are short duration with the exception of rain drops/streaks falling up to 25% for an extended period. Almost no flaws in the 3D made it pleasant to watch, BUT...

THE BIG BUT:  Simplistic shading of most objects and characters, create an effect, where even though the scenes have a 3D layering, individual objects usually look like flat cardboard cutouts standing at different depths.

Children should dismiss the flat objects in a depth-field and love this film but adult viewers have come to expect more from 3D.

MY 3D RATING = GOOD (poor, fair, good, very good, excellent)

Note: As far as the percentages go, everyone's eyes are different. What I see at 25% you may see at 15% or 35%. To fully realize how far something is out of the screen for you, pause on an effect and direct a partner with an extended finger to the tip of what you are seeing. You may be surprised.

Are we just supposed to forget that 8 minutes of music and animation were added to the overall experience in 2D?  Or is Disney hoping to release yet another disc in a year or two incorporating the scene into the 3D format?

590198,4,6303142346,"I just finished Beauty and the Beast in 3D and it brought me back to my childhood. As far as the 3d conversion process I think overall they did a good job. Originally the movie was hand drawn and some Computer Animation. Some of the 3D look was represented in appearance by that different animation style and took a little away from crisp completely computer animated 3D we have become use to. There was some ghosting involved from what I could tell but most of the time it was not that distracting. Even with a good amount of the background looking reminiscent of old school Disney animation I grew up fondly enjoying, it was made to look like it was in 3d but sometimes I do not always think it worked out spotless.

Do not let some those negatives sway you too much, they did have fantastic backgrounds that added depth to what was one 2D, and made the castle look much bigger then I remember it was. As she walked through the streets in the beginning of the movie the rooftops were given dimension making the town seem a little more real. What were once just beautiful backdrops of the castle the added dimension brought out the size and scope of west-wing, library, and the great hall making them feel bigger, and a more warming or dreary place.

What can be said for the Ballroom but wow. it was a masterpiece then, and it was equally as stunning now. Being how the Beauty and the Beast waltz scene was fully done in computer animation int he past, it really was able to shine with the added 3d process added.

Overall I enjoyed the movie in 3d and brought a new depth to an already beautiful story. If this was going to be one of the harder 3D conversions Disney was doing, I can not wait to see Aladdin, or Little Mermaid. Finding Nemo will be amazing, along with monster's inc. Looking forward to them.

Score wise has to be a high 3  to a low 4 due to the limitations it was under because of the old animation styling, but it still came out pretty well.

(though Little Mermaid will be along the same limitations B&B was under due to most of it was not computer animated either, but still looking forward to seeing Mermaid as well)",1318291200,,2141,4.366834170854271

It's great. I was excited by all the various rave reviews of the picture on Blu-Ray sites, but then confused when I saw some people complaining on the Amazon review page. I turned the movie on earlier and I know what they're complaining about with the ""white halos."" I found the solution for this to be actually very, very simple. Just turn down the sharpness slightly. And that's it. You lose the halos while retaining the fantastic quality & crispness of every line in the picture. As for complaints about the clarity revealing the minor animation flaws, I just don't see anyone with that complaint being an animation fanatic. Imperfection is perfection.

The features are great, particularly the interactive documentary if you're interested in the behind-the-scenes of what was essentially the rise of the Disney Renaissance.

Like ""The Little Mermaid"" before it, ""Beauty and the Beast"" is a beautiful and morally important fable. From Belle's perspective, it tells us that you can't always judge someone on first meeting them...no matter how gruff they might appear. The Beast learns that love will only come to you when you treat others as you'd have them treat you. And don't forget all those fantastic songs!

590253,5,6303142346,"Everyone has a favorite Disney film. You know, the one you saw at one point in your life and stuck with you forever. Not to mention that there so many classics to choose from. For me that film is Beauty and the Beast. I start with that because if while reading this, I wax poetic about how this is the best of the Disney films and a work of genius while the reader is thinking ""Well, its not Fantasia (or insert your favorite here) but its not bad."" Please understand that the film is very close to my heart so it is hard for me to be objective.

The first and only hand animated film to be nominated for a best picture Academy Award, Beauty and the Beast is a major departure from the classic Disney formula, at least where the Disney Princesses are concerned. Belle is not your run of the mill damsel in distress, waiting to be saved by Prince Charming. While the setting of the film seems from a long time ago, this is a firmly modern main character, especially for a woman. Everything is turned on its head. Belle reads and thinks (a bad thing according to the villain in the film) and in her notion of marriage the relationship should be emotionally and intellectually stimulating. Not to mention equality. Not 20 minutes into the film our heroine makes a very hard act of self sacrifice to save her father (as opposed to fathers helping their daughters in other films, if they are there at all) and not long after that gets in trouble for her curiosity rather than her beauty (which is usually what gets princesses into trouble).

Her relationship with the Beast doesn't exactly ""click"" from the get go. They argue and fight (some of the best moments in the film)and while Beast does save her life at one point. It is Belle who saves him in the end, again turning a stereotype on its head. Of course, you can't get away with all these changes in tradition without something ""Disney"" to anchor the film and all this drama. The Fantasy element is very much present. Every secondary character that lives in the Beast's castle is some sort of stationary object. And you can't talk about a film like this and not mention the score and music that goes with it. The songs are all memorable in the best Disney tradition but the score, in my opinion, is one of the best ever by Disney. It perfectly complements the darkness of film. (Who would ever think you could use darkness and Disney in the same anything.)

Disney has so far done an outstanding job releasing its back catalog into Blu-Ray. The transfers so far have been pretty much perfect and this film is no exception. The colors look amazing and the detail is so remarkable that if you look closely you can see the pencil strokes in the drawn characters beneath the ink. It is that good. The only thing missing from this release is a digital copy. I'm having a hard time understanding the logic behind Disney's combo packs. Some include the digital copy, some don't. A little bit of consistency (preferably in the ""included digital copy"" department) would be greatly appreciated.

In closing, this is a must have release if you are a fan of Disney films. It is an incredible film. The transfer is awesome. The bonus features are plentiful. Despite lacking the digital copy, I highly recommend this release.",1313712000,,3263,4.534804753820034

I for one will boycott ALL such Disney 3D titles over $30 and hope that they get the message and reduce them down to less than the cost of new 3D movies like Tangled, et al, and more in line with similar products from other studios.

The only 2D animated 3D film I'm purchasing is in The Lion King Trilogy Boxset, and even then that's not the reason I'm purchasing it (the original is a classic film and the second one in my favourite, and I haven't seen the 3rd one [named 1 1/2 in the US]).

I don't quite understand it to be honest, I love 3D (despite my shallow pockets holding very little money) but any 3D release I make sure to get, if I enjoyed it in the cinema or know it'll be my kind of film (like I enjoy the Saw films and didn't see the last one in cinemas, but I will still, at somepoint, buy the 3D Blu-Ray).

I would like 3D to become a mainstay of cinema, however it is a gimmick and needs to be used well and to great effect, not to slap an extra few bucks onto the price tag.

If the other discs are exactly the same as the previous release then you may as well get this because it is a top-notch release, but if you already have the original Diamond Edition don't bother with this unless you're set up with 3D and don't mind to double-dip for a 2D animated movie, which I'm sure makes up about 0.000005% of the entire globe's population.

Now they're re-releasing it in 3D?  That kind of sucks considering that I'm planning on buying a 3D tv in about a month.  Now it looks like I might have to re-buy this movie.  I hate when studios keep releasing newer versions of their movies.  We, as fans, can't wait forever to buy one of the versions, but we hate to run out and buy the first one knowing that there might be a better version released soon after (this 3D version for example).  So what are we to do?  If they were going to release a 3D version of this film on blu-ray, I wish they would've just waited one more year and only released this one.

The extended edition includes a new song ""When We're Human Again"".  This song is a great addition to the movie.  It doesn't add any substantial substance to the plot, but it's a great fun number that doesn't throw the plot off so it's a nice addition.  I was a little susprised to see it in the film, but it was definitely a good surprise.  It dives into the secondary characters a bit more and the lives in the castle so it adds another layer to the story that has gone unseen until now.

As an arts student learning maya, I loved the animated and storyboard feature.  The feature screen is located in the upper left portion of the screen so it's not distracting if you want to focus on the regular film.  The images vary between the storyboard, animated drawings, and regular film (as it fills in the gaps when needed).  I noticed that the colors in the blu-ray version are much brighter than what I was used to from the VHS version, and I think this can be seen in the storyboard version as the colors seem to be darker in that version.

The interviews with the cast of the Broadway version are also really interesting.  I like the fact that they had commentary for many different Beauties.

But Disney still seems to get a pass from everyone on one point--none of these versions is the uncut theatrical print. The Gaston song has been trimmed--at the end of the reprise, as part of the song, LaFou spells out Gaston's name and makes a mistake, causing Gaston to clobber him. This sequence was in when it was first released to theaters (and really was funny), but it has been edited out of every home video version, and sadly this one is no exception. Why? Is this some politically correct thing where they are worried about offending people who make spelling mistakes?

590632,5,6303142346,"In this Oscar season for Toy Story 3, it is well to remember that Beauty and the Beast (as is repeatedly mentioned in the extra features) was the first animated film to be nominated for Best Picture (and it won the Golden Globe for musical/comedy).  It was well deserving!  There are no weaknesses in this movie: The songs are the best in any Disney film (and who'dve thunk, considering the two most important songs are sung by Angela Lansbury and Jerry Orbach....), the voice acting is great, the animation is astonishing (especially for its time).  Sure there are occasional weird, off-model moments, but not nearly as in Little Mermaid (and you get the feeling they may even be deliberate, e.g. when Gaston is flexing in the pub).  Certainly, this is the best pre-Pixar Disney film for animation, and although I have a soft spot in my heart for Ariel, Mulan, Aurora, et al., Belle is clearly the greatest of the Disney Princesses - plucky, great voice, brave, and looks better in a ballroom than even Cinderella in her Fairy-Godmother-enhanced dress.  Granted, Cinderella had to stand next to Prince Charming, whereas Belle's comparison is the ""horrible, hideous Beast!""

The story, in short (spoiler alert! - but as in most musicals, the plot is not really the point) - Belle's father (Maurice) seeks shelter from a wolf attack in a strange castle, inhabited by enchanted objects - Lumiere the candlestick, Cogsworth the clock, Mrs. Potts the teapot, etc.  The castle had been enchanted because the master of the castle, now an enormous, angry beast, was unkind and treated a disguised enchantress badly.  Belle finds Maurice in the castle, sick and dying in the dungeon, and trades her life for her father's.  Through the help of the servants (the enchanted objects), Beast and Belle learn to live together and even to enjoy each others' company.  Meanwhile, Gaston, the local narcisistic bully has decided he will do anything to marry Belle (""In town there's only she/Who is beautiful as me/So I'm making plans to woo and marry Belle"").  Ultimately Gaston and the Beast do battle, and Belle's love redeems the Beast and breaks the enchantment.

Thus, on the surface, this is a standard Disney adventure, good vs. evil, seen in everything before it from Snow White to The Little Mermaid.  However, there are a few key points that make this film rise above all the others.  First is the quality of the songs, and their integration in the plot.  They are catchy tunes but also efficient storytellers, especially the ""Something There"" montage that shows Beast and Belle turning from a state of mutual dislike to one of friendship.  There is also a clear redemption story parallelling the good-vs.-evil story, which is rare in Disney films (only Ratatouille, the Lion King, and Cars have such an integration of a redemption story, and of those only Lion King can compete with Beauty and the Beast for sheer emotional effectiveness).  The third key is Belle herself - she is a true hero and makes her own happy ending.  Let us compare her to the other classic Disney Princesses: Aurora is never given the opportunity for heroism and is simply rescued by Prince Philip, Cinderella suffers much but has given up to dispair when the Fairy Godmother finally appears to rescue her, Ariel selfishly and foolishly jeopardizes her own life and her father's kingdom, etc.  Snow White does bravely pull herself together and rescues herself when cast out by the Queen, but she then naively allows herself to get poisoned (and again a Prince needs to rescue her).  Only Mulan shows a degree of moral fortitude similar to Belle when she, too, saves her incapacitated father's life by taking his place (but, as pointed out in another Amazon review, who remembers any of the songs in Mulan?).

So, given that you simply MUST buy this film, the question becomes Blu-ray or DVD-only?  (in these Diamond editions, the Blu-ray also comes with the DVD)  I'm not sure which of these extras are included in the DVD-only version, but the full suite of Blu-ray extras are impressive (second only to the greatest Blu-ray I've ever seen, which is Snow White).  There are many many extras detailing the making of the film (and of the spin-off Broadway musical).  Of particular interest to me is the degree to which this is actually Howard Ashman's film.  Sure, he is listed as Executive Producer, but that could mean anything.  In this case, it appears he exterted the kind of control that, say, George Lucas did in Return of the Jedi.  He even ruthlessly cut one of his own songs when it wasn't working and replaced it with ""Something More"".  The excised song - ""Human Again"" - is seamlessly re-integrated into this Blu-ray (you can watch the ""Original Theatrical Version"" or the ""Extended Version"" which includes the new song).  It's fully animated and (since it was recorded before it was cut) contains the original voice actors' singing.  There is the original 20-minute ""treatment"" that was shown to Katzenberger and the other Disney executives (which led to a change in the creative leadership of the film)  Finally, like in Snow White, several extra animated shorts from Walt Disney himself are included - two Silly Symphonies and four Laugh-o-Gram fairytales (including a 7-minute Cinderella).  Unfortunately, it is difficult to find some of these special features as they are buried under multiple menus of non-intuitive location.  Even more frustrating (indeed, almost enraging) are the Blu-ray technical issues that have plagued every Disney Blu-ray yet produced: there is no ""resume play"" feature - if you stop half-way through you can't re-start from where you stopped, you even have to watch the anti-piracy warnings again.  You cannot even fast-search through the special features!  Are you telling me that my $30 Walmart DVD player has these features but my $400 Sony-built PS3 does not?  Even my old VCR  from 1980 could fast-search....  Exactly when will Blu-ray technology manage to be able to do the same technical things that were common 30 years ago?",1297555200,,6045,4.9357707509881426

590637,5,6303142346,"Well, what can I say?  I loved this movie/musical from the first time I saw it in the Theatres.  Based on the Brothers Grimm fairy tale, this animated musical that later became a Broadway Stage hit, is a true classic.  The music was written by the team of Howard Ashman and Alan Menken, who also did Little Mermaid, and Little Shop of Horrors.  Howard Ashman died shortly after this film was released.  This movie is about a young maiden named Belle who loves to read and eventually has to rescue her father from an enchanted castle where an evil prince has been transformed to a beast, and the subjects have been transformed into clocks, candlesticks and other objects.  And if the spell can only be broken if he can fall in love before his 21st year.

What I love about this movie, I think is the romance, Jerry Orbach's charisma as the Lumiere, and of course Paige O'Hara's golden voice.  For several years I still had my VHS copy from childhood, but no VCR to play it on anymore.  And for Christmas my Aunt gave it to me for when I have children.  I'm not married yet, but eventually.  I just can't get enough of it.  It brings back so many memories.  I also love ""BE Our Guest.""  Jerry Orbach does a great version of it.  I will alway remember how heartbroken I was when Mr. Orbach died of colon cancer.  Goodness, what a horrible loss!  Also, the scene when the Beast releases Belle to go see her sick father makes me cry every time I watch it.

Dreamworks now rivals Disney when it comes to animated comedies; think Shrek, Over the Hedge and How to Train Your Dragon.  But for animated musicals, nobody can even challenge Disney.  And this classic take on the fairy tale is a good example why.  Clocking in at just under 1.5 hours, this movie is part romance, part drama, part comedy, and all music.  The scores are wonderful, spread out throughout the movie, and appropriately placed such that they do not distract from dialogue or action.  As for this product, the video quality is perfect.  It was also nice to see both the original film, and the intended, longer version with extra music.  All in all, a great movie.",1294444800,,763,4.7272727272727275

590773,4,6303142346,"`Beauty and the Beast' is one of those films that has stood the test of time and it still feels as well made and delightful as when it was first released. Now it is re-released in blu-ray splendour you can relive it's magic again and again.

Belle lives in a French village and loves nothing more than a good book and when the local Casanova Gaston (who is odious and vain) tries to take her hand in marriage she can think of nothing worse. Her father stumbles across a deserted castle inhabited by a gruesome beast, who is really a prince under a spell, and when Belle goes to rescue him she ends up being held prisoner herself. Over time Belle and the beast develop a love for one another and when Gaston comes to kill the beast the story is brought to a head.

Of course there is slightly more to the story than that, but that is the rough outline and gives an idea of what you can expect here. The animation is very well done in this film, as it's Oscar will attest to, and the backgrounds are rendered with a level of detail Disney films have lacked in recent years. The use of light is very good as well, especially in the castle where the shadows and pools of light are very well done.

This has decent enough music and isn't too twee and the voiceover work is also very good. I especially enjoyed Angela Lansbury as the teapot and thought she matched the character perfectly.

This has become a classic in the Disney stable for a reason and if you haven't watched this yet you should be pleased with the story and animation on offer. This has plenty of extras, most of which are aimed at kids, but the commentaries and `making of' featurette are of special interest to adults and give a deeper insight into the film. Overall this is a great package with excellent remastering and is another wonderful film to add to your Disney collection.

I have only watched the Blu-ray version so far but I am very impressed with how this movie looks in all its 1080P splender.  If you like Beauty and the Beast and want to see it in HD, it is definitely worth it.

The only complaint I have is that I had to return the first one I received.  For the first time ever, I received a bad disc.  When it would get to about the 10th chapter it would start skipping chapters.  I inspected the disc and cleaned it even though there were no apparent dirty spots.  I even power cycled my PS3 and played it and it would consistently start skipping chapters in the same spot.

590806,5,6303142346,"I'll admit it now, I am a sucker for Disney animated classics, and this is coming from a 26 year old male who refues to watch live musicals. Take it from me, Beauty and the Beast is one of Disney's best movies. The story is fantastic and well told, with the plot moving along at a good pace. It is also an emotional tale of love and redemption, and it is a moving story. The songs (except for one, which I will get to in a moment) are fun and catchy, and you will find yourself humming at least one of them long after the movie is over. The only downside is the added musical number, as it is not of typical Disney quality and really does nothing for the story. You will most likely notice it immediatly. Other than that, there are no complaints with the movie.

Technically, the Blu-Ray restoration is amazing. The sound is wonderful, and, as with previous Disney Blu-Ray releases, the visial transfer is stunning. It feels very much like watching for the first time.

All in all, if you enjoy Disney movies, musicals, or animation in general, you will love this movie. If those things aren't your cup of tea, the movie is still well worth the price of admission.",1294185600,,1164,4.3842592592592595

590811,5,6303142346,"I have loved this movie since it was first released. How could I not love a heroine that was so devoted to books and loves to read as much as I do? And a REAL hero is the beast, who gives her an enormous library.

The music is just lovely, and in my opinion this is one of the best song set in all of the Disney musicals. I can easily see why this went to Broadway - the songs were that quality. The story is simple yet heart warming, and the value of not judging someone solely by their looks is one sorely needed in today's society. The message is a valuable one, and the love story that goes along with it has meaning as well. We see all types of love in this story - which makes it a true love story and not just a romance. There is the selfless love that Belle has for her father - taking his place. There is the parental love of her father - going back for her, and worrying for her. There is the self-love of Gaston, who loves his image above all else. It's not just that he loves himself - his image is what he wishes to protect and what drives his urge to ""win"" when he makes that final, fatal attack on the beast which results in his plummeting to his death. That strong imagery of him falling from grace physically as well as socially is appropriate. Finally, there is the true love that Belle has for the Beast - loving him for who he is and not how he looks, loving him for how he treats her and not just the castle he has. The Beast echoes that same true love when he is willing to let her go when he realizes she must be with her family, and trusting she might return. The old saying goes, ""If you love something, set it free. If it comes back to you, it is meant to be. If it doesn't, it never was."" This is exemplified in the Beast's actions at that critical moment.

I had loved this movie for years, and I owned the soundtrack long before I had children. I now have a four year old daughter, and this is her favorite movie. We watch it many times over, and yet I never tire of the story nor the songs. It is a timeless classic, and the Blu-Ray version brings it to life in a crisp, clear, colorful form that my entrances my daughter every time.",1293840000,,2163,4.027906976744186

It has my favorite Disney heroine ever, the independent strong willed Belle, along with the complex Beast and a host of great supporting characters, some of the best songs ever in an animated musical (or maybe in any musical period), and is wildly entertaining, enchanting, and emotionally riveting from beginning to end. It's a classic romance tale beautiful, epic, and without a major flaw I can see.

Well the blu-ray transition is another homerun from Disney. It is unbelievably good. It's an enhancement which respects the original masterpiece and gives a whole new life to both previous fans and first time viewers with picture and sound quality unlike few blu-rays I have seen before. There are a lot of great extras including deleted scenes and a brand new documentary that lets you choose what path you want to take, quite unlike anything I've seen before.

They even went as far as changing the color of Belle's eyes. She was one of the the few princess figures from traditional Disney who had brown hair and brown eyes, but now she has hazel eyes. It is a small thing, but part of what made the film so great was the mundane beauty of Belle. Disney transformed the original film into something aimed even more so at little girls and has reinforced the culturally false ideals that beauty cannot be mundane.

590930,4,6303142346,"My memory of Beauty and Beast are from several viewings of the 70 mm release at the Academy Theater on New York City.  The image of my memory was solid, luminous and almost three dimensional.  The sound had depth and an impressive frequency range.  One was immersed in the film; one was carried into Bell's world.  The Blu-Ray edition does not duplicate that experience.  However it is excellent with good color rendition and a very solid sound stage.  I compared this Blu - Ray edition side by side with the Platinum Special Edition.  I synced  two DVDs to within a few frames of each other and was able to rapidly switch back and forth between two the DVD players using an HDMI switch.  On my 53 inch Sony SXRD I found the following: the color on the Blu - Ray disk was more intense and there was some better definition in background objects compared to the Platinum Special Edition in which the colors looked pale and to a degree washed out.  Sound was also better on the Blu - Ray disk - fuller with better channel separation.  If you already have earlier editions of this film and you are not obsessed with it then the Blu - Ray disk does not add that much.  However, if you are buying this film for the first time or have a VHS version the Blu - Ray will give you a significantly improved experience compared to the earlier DVD releases.",1292025600,,1343,4.392712550607287
590931,5,6303142346,"One word that instantly springs to mind when I think of the Disney's `Beauty and the Beast' is EPIC.  Yes, this film has stood the test of time (if 20 years can really be regarded as a serious `test') and has proven to be one of, if not THE, most beloved Disney film currently in circulation.  It was, up until last year, the only animated film to receive a Best Picture Oscar nomination (`Up' finally joined the elite group, and I have a feeling `Toy Story 3' will rightfully join them this year) and it's easy to see why, for frame for frame, song for song, emotion for emotion; `Beauty and the Beast' is a notch above the rest.

Not only one of the greatest animated films ever made (my money is still on `The Grave of the Fireflies' as the actual `best') but `Beauty and the Beast' has the added bonus of being one of the greatest musicals ever put to film.  Each song beautifully illuminates the films central core and adds depth and meaning and affection to every frame.

I mean, there are very few films where I will stoop to singing along, and this is one of the few.

The fact that this film reduces me to a gigantic ball of weepy goo is not really important, but it must be said that the emotional resonance within `Beauty and the Beast' is another reason why this particular film is such an important and substantially memorable addition to the Disney canon.  The tale told, that of a spoiled Prince banished by an enchantress to live his days as a horrid beast until he learns to love and can be loved in return, is one that sticks with the audience and really invests itself.  The layers of depth here are beautifully examined, albeit in a sing-song and rather kid friendly manor, so that even adults can walk away feeling something in their hearts (which is precisely why this garnered that Best Picture nomination).  The repartee between The Beast and Belle is actually believable and adds a layer of reality to the proceedings.  You can see the heart of the film worn on its sleeve.

""Isn't this amazing!""

Alas, my love for the rich animation, the boisterous musical numbers (`Be Our Guest' is one of the best Disney songs, ever), the impassioned performances (they may merely be voice actors, but the emotional relevance is there in every syllable) and the soulful understanding of the material goes unmatched, really.

In my eyes, this film should have EASILY taken the Oscar that year.  Sure, `The Silence of the Lambs' was a great film, but it is no where near as beloved as moving as this classic Disney experience!",1291852800,,2537,4.535087719298246

  But...there are some drawbacks to this edition. I own the Platinum Edition of this film, and after reading the back of the Diamond Edition, I found there were only a few differences.
  First off, the aspect ratio is NOT 2.35! They have cropped this film to 1.78! The original aspect ratio, as it was seen in the theatre, was 1.85, which the Platinum sports. It might not seem like a lot, but Disney's new fling is with cutting and cropping films to make it ""perfect"" for those with widescreen televisions. I have no problem with seeing black bars at the bottom of my widescreen tv, because at least I know that I'm getting what I hope is the full picture.
  Most of the special features as exactly the same as the Platinum. I can't tell you what the picture looks like, but I've heard the rumors that the DVD copy of the Diamond Edition is actually much better than the bluray. Once upon a time, when films were not made in high definition digital, there was something called film, which would wear after a time, and not all mistakes could be magically undone.
  I will say though, the new music video for the love song is much better than Platinum's. Jordin Spark's rendition is much more beautiful, with a hint of mystery and discovery, not to mention the music video itself is quite beautiful. Jump 5's version hinted a little more at friends getting together and singing favourite Disney songs, and rather lacked at the emotional lyrics penned by Howard Ashman.
  So, the Platinum Edition triumphs over the Diamond DVD copy, and the Diamond DVD copy towers over the cringe-worthy bluray.",1291593600,,1761,4.597444089456869

It's simply a captivating motion picture: from the striking opening shot of a castle deep in the woods, you are riveted to the screen until the closing shot of a stained glass. The songs are some of the best by Disney, particularly ""Belle"" and ""Something There"" (I don't like the newly-added ""Human Again""). The musical score is fittingly haunting and rich, most effective in the prologue, the west wing and the transformation sequences. While Alan Menken's best songs are probably those in ""Mermaid"", the score here is arguably his best.

Now, on to this release. Ever since it's 2002 DVD debut, there has been quite a controversy over the restoration the film has gone through. And indeed, anyone even slightly familiar with the original release, easily noticed the difference in colors. Whereas the early 90's version boasted a gothic and dark picture, the 2002 DVD showed a flat and cheap-looking picture with bright and off colors (for example, ""olive green"" turned to neon green). I don't know what the directors were trying to achieve by doing that, maybe experience their classic in a Saturday Morning cartoon style? So imagine how eager Disneyphiles were for the new release, firmly believing they'll nail it this time and that the Diamond Edition would look more like the 1991 film than the 2002 one.

So after seeing the new transfer, I can say it's better than the previous release, but still disappointing as it looks nothing like the original. Again, Belle's hair is light brown instead of dark, the ballroom is too yellowish, even the stars in the ballroom sequence don't sparkle as they do in the original. These flaws may look minor to casual viewers but it's irritating to fans of the film.

So even though it is a brilliant film, I was disappointed to some degree by its restoration and I wish the directors would finally take notice. As for me, I'm keeping my 1992 VHS tape to enjoy what was ORIGINALLY ""Beauty and the Beast"".",1291593600,,2140,4.762803234501348

I watched this on vhs almost every weekend growing up. Im now a preschool teacher. My 2 yr olds always ask to watch ""Beast"" on movie day so we roll out the vcr cart. So of course I was extremely excited abouut a re release but the animation is just OFF.The colors are definitely not right. I don't know the technical name for the change but it seemed like some scenes were from the original while others were animated cheaply and cartoonish. I think Ill just buy a dvd alone version. Anyway who is familiar with this movie would notice the artwork is different in a bad way.",1291334400,,703,4.214814814814815

I saw this movie on my first date and I remember thinking I can't believe I'm watching a cartoon but I loved it. And it continues to be great today while some other Disney blockbusters have sort of gone by the wayside. It's the music- you don't have to know the movie to be familiar with the wonderful songs that came out of this. Some of the early CGI seems a little hokey now but it's a terrific adapation of the fairy tale. A few pretty intense scenes early on with the beast and when he's attacked later that may be a bit much for the smaller guys.",1291334400,,757,5.415254237288136

I loved every minute of watching it again as an adult rather than a child...and since I am 29 years old, it had been a very long time since I had seen it.  What I do not like is the whole Disney idea of being ""in the vault.""  I think all movies should be available because children are being born all the time and when movies are in the vault, a whole generation of children could miss out on great movies, like Beauty and the Beast.

The colors have been drastically altered from their original versions, and it's really horrible. They made the colors so over-saturated that I had to dim my screen by half- and they still were too bright.

The reds are no longer the rich rusts they were- but rather a glaring fire-engine red. I got out my old VHS tape, and the colors are so much better than this. I don't know who was in charge of remastering the colors of this glorious film, but they were so heavy handed that they really ruined some scenes visually. 'Belle's Song' (the opening where they all sing bonjour!) was impossible to look at in some instances because of how bright the reds were.

It's a shame that they did this to such a great film.",1290902400,,826,4.456953642384106

591023,5,6303142346,"I won't even begin to talk about the plot, because it's a ""tale old as time"" (yeah I had to say it). I will however talk about how great the picture quality is on Blu-ray.  I could only describe it as a ""moving painting"" and a rather bright and vivid painting at that.  The audio is equally as good as the video which is really saying a lot.

There are 3 versions of the film included on the BD and DVD, as well as a ton of bonus material.  The bonus material includes a lot of featurettes on the plot, music, etc. and some games for children.

Bottom line this is the best version of the movie ever released, and a must purchase before it goes back into the Disney Vault.  Can't wait to see how great The Lion King turns out on Blu-Ray next year!",1290297600,,747,4.082191780821918

591076,5,6303142346,"I was delighted to hear that this terrific film was coming to Blu-Ray. I had missed out on the DVD version in the past before the film was put back in ""the vault."" Although I suspect anyone reading this review already is aware that this is a great movie I can't resist putting in my two cents that this is Disney at its best. I always thought Belle served as a wonderful role model for kids with her love of books and learning - it somehow makes her more three-dimentional than some of the other princesses. The story in this film has a nicer arc and just flows better with all the characters growing and developing (well, maybe not Mr. Antlers-In-All-My-Decorating). I must admit that the lack of a major parental figure dying also is quite appealing as that seems to happen so often in Disney films. Anyway, this is a terrific story well told and back in the day I was very much hoping it would be awarded Best Picture.

What you are probably reading this for, however, is an assessment of the picture quality / sound quality on the blu-ray and I can tell you it is superb. I was impressed with the detail visible in the animations, it was like seeing the movie in the theatre. Sound is also excellent. My kids (5 and 7) both had only seen part of the movie on a dim-looking laserdisc (yes, I'm one of the few who still has a working laserdisc player in my home) - and this presentation really got their attention. We also watched the interviews with the cast of the Broadway show and that was a fun feature. We haven't ventured to the second 'special features' disc yet. The inclusion of a DVD is a nice touch as it will see service in our car soon.

Overall, this is an excellent presentation of what IMHO is Disney's finest work.",1289433600,,1734,4.365325077399381

I've decided to update the whole collection on DVD as they became available (we don't even own a VCR anymore), so I purchased this as soon as it was on sale. Got to watch it with my (now 21-year-old) son just 3 weeks ago and we both found it even more enchanting than we remembered it; the color is spectacular and the blue-ray really does make a huge difference--everything has an almost-3d effect that added immensely to our experience. What a special, timeless story this is; the characters come to life and are even more charming than ever; it's a triumph of human spirit and the power of love to see real beauty within.  The extra interviews with the composer really gave insight into the creative process of the film, and gives a beautiful tribute to its late lyricist (the real force behind the whole production), Howard Ashman.  Worth every penny, and a delight to treasure for years to come (maybe--if I'm lucky--I'll get to watch it with my grandchildren one day!).",1289088000,,1110,4.624365482233503

Disney's recent release of BEAUTY AND THE BEAST on BD looks so good that it has the appearance of 3D. As I watched this blu-ray, the colors seemed to jump out and have a three dimensional space. The sound is flawless. Even though B&TB isn't my favorite Disney film, I find myself amazed at this BD version. I only hope that their Fantasia set coming soon will be just as good.

I'm not sure about the complaints- it does include a DVD version as well as a Blu Ray disk, so it could be that perhaps people put in the DVD thinking it was a Blu Ray- which there is a difference in quality of course. Unconverted the DVD does not look TOO bad, but not as great as the Blu Ray. As for the bootlegs, I'm not sure... this is the quality thing!!!

When he mentioned it to me recently, I searched at Amazon to see if I could find it for him, and there it was. It's a classic for children who love fairy tales.

591185,5,6303142346,"The story of ""Beauty and the Beast"" was born as a fairy tale back in the 1740's by Madame Gabrielle-Suzanne Barbot de Villeneuve and then revised in 1757 by French novelist Jeanne Marie Le Prince de Beaumont received its animated adaptation courtesy of Walt Disney  in 1991.

The film is directed by Gary Trousdale and Kirk Wise (both worked on ""The Hunchback of Notre Dame"" and ""Atlantis: The Lost Empire"") and the screenplay adaptation by Linda Woolverton (""The Lion King"", ""Mulan"" , ""Arctic Tale"" and ""Alice in Wonderland"").

""Beauty and the Beast"" is the 30th film in the Walt Disney Animated Classics line and is considered one of the greatest Disney animated films of all time.  The film was an amazing success as the film which cost $25 million to make had made over $377 million dollars worldwide and the film was also the first animated film to be nominated for an Academy Award for Best Picture (note: The second was 2009's ""Up"") and was successful in blending traditional animation with CG.

And now the popular animated film receives its first release on Disney Blu-ray and receives a ""Diamond Edition"" release.  In this release, we get more special features than its previous 2002 DVD release but also three different versions of the film which includes a special extended edition, the original theatrical release and the original theatrical release with storyreel picture in picture (watching the film with the original storyboards in picture in picture format).

VIDEO:

Everything about ""Beauty and Beast"" screams gorgeous, vibrant and magnificent with the release of ""Beauty and the Beast: Diamond Edition"".  In my 2002 DVD review, I talked about how beautiful the animation was and how well-painted the backgrounds were but after watching this on Blu-ray, I'm going to focus on how vibrant the colors are, how well-defined the lines are, how  detailed the backgrounds to the simplest of objects such as wood, leaves and objects are.  How every character and object and its shadowing are well-done.

""Beauty and the Beast: Diamond Edition"" is presented in 1080p High Definition (1:78:1).  From the daylight scenes that showcase the amber oranges to the winter scenes that show the whites and blues, to the night-time and more ominous and darker scenes, blacks are nice and deep but yet you can still see detail where shadows are present on objects.  You can see the stains on the roof of the background and can easily make out the different color bricks on the chimneys, the pattern of wood on the home and well.  And of course, the animation and how free flowing the characters are, especially in the dance scene.  For a film that was created in 1991, you can't tell this animated film is nearly 20-years-old.  This film still looks incredible and it looks wonderful in HD.  I detected no banding, edge enhancement, haloing, combing or compression artifacting.

This is the definitive version to own of this title yet and if you have a Blu-ray player and love Disney animated classics, picture quality-wise, this is a title that simply is a must-own.

As for the included DVD, the DVD is presented in 1:78:1 aspect ration-enhanced for 169 televisions.

AUDIO & SUBTITLES:

""Beauty and the Beast: Diamond Edition"" is not only fantastic in picture quality, the film is absolutely fantastic via lossless as well.  Presented in English 7.1 DTS-HD Master Audio (48 kHz. 24-bit) as well as 5.1 DEHT French and Spanish language tracks, ""Beauty and the Beast"" does not disappoint.

If anything, I wished that everything Disney releases were in English 7.1 DTS-HD Master Audio and fortunately, the animated classics have received this attention.  Audio literally envelops the soundscape with immersive audio coming from the front and center channels, the surround channels, the rear surround channels.  Dialogue and music is crisp and clear, the slight sounds of leaves, horse galloping, the leaves rustling, the Beast growling, the sound of flame flickering, pots and tea cups clinkering, these are all well-done.  And it doesn't stop there, there is also LFE present as well.

But if anything, one thing that ""Beauty and the Beast"" is known for is its music.  Alan Menkin's music for the film is wonderful.  You will find yourself singing to songs such as ""Beauty and the Beast"", ""Be Our Guest"" and ""Belle"" and the truth is, the music captivated many people in 1991, so much that it won an Academy Award for ""Best Music, Original Score"" and ""Best Music, Original Song"" and also won two Golden Globe Awards as well for its score and for ""Best Original Song - Beauty and the Beast"".

As for subtitles, ""Beauty and the Beast: Diamond Edition"" is presented in English SDH, English ESL, French and Spanish.

As for the included DVD, the DVD is presented in 5.1DEHT English and Spanish Language Tracks with English SDH and Spanish subtitles.

JUDGMENT CALL:

My opinion of ""Beauty and the Beast"" has not changed since my DVD review for the title back in 2002.  The animation, the painted backgrounds, the music, the characters, the movement... everything about the film is a pleasant reminder of the classic Disney films that I have loved and ""Beauty and the Beast"" is a film I still love.

Similar to the ""Snow White"" Blu-ray release, how can ""Beauty and the Beast: Diamond Edition"" improve upon the original 2002 release?  Easy...by adding a ton of special features and three different versions of the film.  This is what I love about Disney, they know what their customers want and what they expect and that is simply getting quality releases each time but raising the bar higher and higher of what a release should be.  And for Disney, there classic animated films are expected to be fantastic releases and fans expect nothing lower.

I expected something incredible and to tell you the truth, I was pretty much expecting better picture quality in HD and lossless audio quality with the same special features and maybe a new audio commentary and possibly a retrospective featurette, but Disney has surpassed my expectations by giving us way more than what we would have expected for this film and I'm impressed and also very grateful.

The film has everything you want.  Great characters, adventure, drama, action, memorable music and more!  And 20-years later, ""Beauty and the Beast"" looks and sounds phenomenal on Blu-ray.

Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment have once again achieved perfection and if you are a Disney fan, a ""Beauty and the Beast"" fan and pretty much any person or fan who respects the quality of the Walt Disney animated classics on HD thus far, ""Beauty and the Beast: Diamond Edition"" receives my highest recommendation!",1287619200,,11516,4.9519832985386225

591189,5,6303142346,"The only animated movie to receive a Best Picture Oscar nomination, and it deserved it.

Magic from the opening prologue to the final credit, ""Beauty and the Beast"" is the last real classic to come from the Disney crew before John Lasseter came along. This was one of the few movies I happily paid to see twice in the cinema, and sitting in a sparsely-populated Friday night audience (I was living in Barbados at the time, and it was hardly the most artistic place on Earth... it was a crying shame that there was hardly anyone there while ""Home Alone 2"" went through the roof) the second time, the magic remained.

You all know the story, so apart from pointing out the movie's one flaw (the prince's spell had to be broken before he turned 21 or he would remain a beast forever; so if it was cast ten years before the events of the movie, wouldn't that mean he was 11 when the spell was cast...?), let's look at how well the movie works. You have a monster who's more human than the movie's medallion-man villain; you have a heroine who's PC but engaging with it; you have a supporting cast of magic utensils who wisely never upstage the couple at the centre of this love story (and despite the Disney animated trappings, it IS a love story); and you have a captivating story, beautifully told.

The movie's also got wonderful design of its French setting and characters, with the ballroom scene a standout (the tiny but appreciative audience were impressed by the sight of the Beast and Belle in their evening wear - the only time I've ever seen cartoon characters get wolf-whistled in a cinema); and Alan Menken's score is his finest work for the Mouse, with matchless lyrics from the late and much lamented Howard Ashman - how many musicals can you name where ALL the songs are brilliant? But ultimately it's the movie's very real heart that makes it a keeper; the cliche ""You'll laugh, you'll cry"" is all too true in this case. A lot of movies called 'classic' don't deserve that appellation, but this one does.

And now it's finally arrived on bluray and looks better than I remember when I first saw it everyone who loves and treasures this movie should buy this before it goes back into the vault.",1287360000,,2206,4.535175879396985
591190,5,6303142346,"Beauty and the Beast is my favorite Disney film and one of my all time favorite films. Disney really did an excellent job with this film. With great animation, a great story with humor and heart, a timeless message, fantastic songs and score and an outstanding array of characters, this film became an instant masterpiece and no Disney film (and many others) has ever topped it. Beauty and the Beast is a film for all ages and although it's only 19 years old, it will be an eternal classic for years to come. This new Diamond Edition makes Beauty and the Beast better than ever.

Beauty and the Beast comes to Blu-Ray looking fantastic. I think no traditional-animated film has looked better. It looks brand-new with no dirt, no edge enhancement, no grain and no artifacts to be found in the print. You will be surpriused with the rich color palette that the film has and the huge amount of detail of the drawings. This Blu-Ray transfer does justice to the animators work in te film. The sound is equally impressive with a 7.1 HD sound that will rock your house. Dialogue is clear, the songs sound beautiful and the score is magnificent. This film presentation is absolutely like the movie itself. Simply astounding.

As with the previous platinum DVD release, you have three versions of the film to choose: the theatrical 1991 version, the extended 2002 version (which is the version I prefer because Human Again is a fantastic number) and the Work in Progress version. Aside from the three presentations, you have a lot of bonus material (and I mean a lot!!).

In disc one you have an audio-commentary, a conversation with legend compososer Alan Menken and a feature that's called Broadway Beginnings which features different stage actors that have been part of the Beauty and the Beast musical on Broadway. Rounding up Disc one is an alternate opening and a deleted scene (which are a little long but great to see).

If you are still thirsty for more (and you should be), in Disc Two you'll find the inmmersive documentary Beyond Beauty. Just like the Hyperion Studios documentary in Snow White, this feaure covers everything that concerns the making of the film. You need a lot of your time to see everything here but is pelnty of fun and very informative. You also have some games and the Classic DVD Bonus Features ported from the Platinum DVD.

A DVD copy is also offered. It also has the three versions of the film plus the audiocommentary and looks great for SD (better than the platinum) but it's a far cry from the quality of the Blu-Ray.

Beauty and the Beast is a fantastic film and a must-own for everyone. This Diamond Edition is a no-brainer purchase or upgrade and you should buy it. An excellent edition for an Exellent film. Completely recommended.

Note: You should know that this Diamond Edition as the Diamond for Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, comes in two presentations: one in a Blu-Ray case and the other in a DVD case. However, both editions have the same content: Two BDs and 1 DVD. If you want the 2-Disc DVD-only edition you'll have to wait until Nov. 23. The DVD-only edition won't have the same amount of bonus features as the BD.

I was in awe of the beauty of the restoration. If your blu-ray player is set up right, with HDMI cables and an HDTV, there is no reason this edition should not look absolutely stunning. The picture quality is perfect, the colors are vibrant, yet natural, and it's hard to pay attention to the film when the beauty of the restoration is immaculate! But, by the time the family had finished the film, we knew we had a great time.

No matter what version you watch this in, you are bound to have a great movie time as a family. But watching it on blu-ray was beyond my greatest expectations. It made a remarkable story even more beautiful, which I always thought impossible.

The coloring wasn't bad and neither was the sound, its simply that it seems like the artistry of the original movie isn't in the new release. Luckily the DVD version looks good on a LCD tv but still not on a plasma.

When playing ""Beyond Beauty - The Untold Story"", the sound just continuously disappear throughout the whole section! This is so annoying. I have to pause the playback and hit play again, so the sound would come back. At first I thought it was a glitch on my PS3. But after replaying this section again (after rebooting PS3), the sound just disappear at the same spots again and again. Especially in the special section about Howard Ashman, the playback just simply stuck and crashed my PS3. I'm also surprise that the fast/back forward key operation doesn't work while playing the bonus clip. My PS3 has the latest firmware and there's not a single scratch on the disc. I don't think playback on PS3 is a problem here. I mean.. PS3 is a bluray player on steroid, if it can't handle a normal bluray I'd suspect that others with the standalone bluray player should have the same issue.

Anybody has the same problem? or I just got a lemon?",1286755200,,1036,4.56989247311828
591210,5,6303142346,The new Diamond edition is beautiful. You can tell they remastered it with sound and quality..I'm a disney fan so I give 5 stars. But it was worth the wait.,1286755200,,156,4.233333333333333
591211,3,6303142346,"We all know that ""Beauty & the Beast"" is a ""5 star"" movie. It's too bad this transfer is not. This is exactly the reason Amazon needs a two-rating system. One for the movie & the other for the actual product. Nobody is getting their movie reviews from Amazon, believe me. What we need to know is if the DVD or Blu-ray is good.

So, let me start by pointing out the good. You get all 3 versions of the movie. The sound is excellent. Very level, deep when it need to be & the music sounds clear & full. Colors in the movie are bright, while the darks are perfect, with no sign of artifacts in them.

Now we get to the bad stuff. Let's face it, when we're buying any kind of video product, the picture is the most important thing. If the picture stinks, the whole think stinks. And although the picture on this Blu-ray doesn't stink, it's not perfect. Far from perfect in fact.

Let's start with the first problem, the lines. In hand-drawn animation, the lines are everything. If they are not constant & clear, the characters lose some of their realism. The lines in Beauty & the Beast are very thin, which is great for details. However, digital media is just not able to handle thin lines correctly. Several times pieces of a line will disappear into the color behind it. Most noticeably on Cogworth's face. His clock face will come through & ""bloom"" over most of the lines on his face, losing most of the detail. But the main problem with the lines in this transfer are the white ""halos"" around them. It seems like they used edge enhancements on the characters. But I'm not 100% sure this is what they did, as this halo never appears on any of the backgrounds. All I know is that at certain times, characters will have these halos surrounding their lines. The Beast takes the brunt of this & looks terrible in every shot. Just check out the sharp ends of his fur to see what I mean. Gaston also suffers from this, especially his face. What I did notice is that for the first half of the film, the lines seem to have been drawn with a dark brown color. Later on, the lines are black & this halo problem lessens. So I'm thinking that the problem is the digital media of Blu-Ray, even though it's high-def is not able to handle the dark brown lines against any brown-based back (flesh, brown fur, tan). When I saw this film at an IMAX theater, I did notice some of the same problems with the lines. So maybe the problem isn't even the transfer, but the actual film itself. Maybe the transfer is just so high-detail it's showing the film's flaws. In any case, these line problems can be distracting at times & I found myself noticing them & focusing on them, rather than the movie itself. Which is not a good thing.

Other video problems include graininess within certain colors, especially yellows or gold, like Lumiere. There is also an annoying strobe like problem, when the action seems to be going fast. This was most noticeable when Maurice is escaping the wolves.

To finish up, we all know the movie is great. Unfortunately, this film just doesn't look as good as let's say Pinocchio or Snow White. Which is kind of amazing, considering those movies are 50+ years older than this one.",1286668800,,3187,4.431740614334471
591212,3,6303142346,"I love this film.  Saw it so many times in the theater that I'm surprised my wife of then six years didn't dump me.  As many have said, the colors are beautiful; there is depth to the multi-layered scenery; the sound is great.  However, I'm having an issue with the picture quality on the animation.  When there is a long shot, everything is fine, but when there is a close-up of any character it seems there is a amall white ""outline"" around any ink-line within the character's figure.

591214,5,6303142346,"I grew up on Beauty and the Beast... I've seen it at least a half dozen times. But when I sat down and popped this into my Blu-ray player the other night, it felt like the first time. I honestly sat there and thought, ""I've never seen this movie before."" Mainly because, I never had. At times, the characters of Belle, Gaston, the Beast, and Maurice felt like real, breathing individuals. And the hand-drawn backgrounds... Oh my, my, my. Every single leaf, nuanced roof tile, and stone bridge is startlingly clear and rendered in the highest quality imaginable. The soundtrack explodes with vibrancy and rattles the walls with clanging dishes and flatware in ""Be Our Guest."" The by-now legendary ballroom sequence during the title song almost brought me to tears just from the sheer beauty of the image before my eyes! And who ever knew Belle blushed in the film?! I've never once noticed that. Buy this today! This very minute! It is the highlight of my Blu-ray collection and I cannot wait to see the stellar Lion King on Blu-ray next fall!

591236,4,6303142346,"I'm hard pressed to think of an animated film that's as concrete and moving as Beauty and the Beast. It has such incredible magic over it. Audiences felt it, and still do. I first saw it at the age of 5. I am now 24, and Beauty and the Beast has lost none of that zest. That's a hallmark that only the best movies manage.

A spoiled prince is cursed to live as a beast until he can earn the love of a girl. His chances look slim until fate brings Belle into his life. A clever girl for whom country life is but too tame and predictable, she agrees to be the Beast's prisoner if he will let her father, a prisoner in his dungeon, released. The road of the two to each other's heart is rocky to say the least, what with the Beast's temper and Belle's sometimes reckless curiosity. But rocky starts have a way of leading to good things. Unfortunately, pig-headed brute Gaston has other plans and is not hesitant to exploit Belle's father to do it.

The animation in this movie is incredible. There's a sense of life and, dare I say it, realism that draws out the incredible beauty this medium can produce. The Beast is particularly amazing. Visually, Beauty and the Beast is a triumph. Take the ball room scene, with its sweeping camera shots and the chandelier, with our heroes dancing underneath on a marble floor with gigantic windows.

The score, by Alan Menken, is excellent as well. Three of the songs were nominated for Oscars. One of them, the enigmatic title track, won a statue, as well as the score itself. ""Beauty and the Beast"", beautifully sung by Angela Lansbury, gives me goosebumps to this day (as indeed does the whole ballroom scene). It even works without the symbolism in the lyrics that you come to detect when you become an adult.

There is a certain epic quality around Beauty and the Beast. It is a film without any notable dud elements. All you're left with after the movie ends is a sense of great appreciation for this film existing. Beauty and the Beast is a masterpiece that still thrills and charms the socks off anyone fortunate enough to discover it today, young or old. That's a rarity.

Great as the movie is, the picture restoration done here is a complete joke. The colours are all washed-out and ugly. Just look at the Beast's fur; it's nowhere near the shade of brown it should be, but much lighter. It's as if someone put a filter over the whole movie and washed it out, which greatly harms the movie's visuals. For the quality of the movie and the extras, I have to detract a star from that. There's a difference between enhancement and ruining.",1286496000,,2583,4.463983050847458

HD is how this film was meant to be seen. The colors are richers, the image crisper and the sound is phenomenal. I already owned the Platinum Edition DVD but am so glad I upgraded.

From the second it started, I was blown away by the picture quality. I think that animated movies are the best looking blu-ray's, and this is one of the best.

591240,5,6303142346,"5 rating for the FILM ONLY NOT THE PACKAGE

I am a DVD person  Have been for 10 years now

My review below from the 2002 DVD Platinum Edition
IF YOU ARE A DVD PERSON LIKE ME GET THIS VERSION IF YOU CAN FIND IT.

Disney should be ashamed of themselves that they think everyone is going Blu Ray
Machines & discs WAY MORE EXPENSIVE.

Here the regular DVD has the 3 versions of the film (like the 2002 DVD did) & NO EXTRAS.
All the extras I want to see are on the blu ray
In 2010 Disney did the same thing they did in 2009 with the Diamond edition of Snow White  Blu ray pack in October & WE DO NOT CARE ABOUT OUR CUSTOMERS regular DVD package Tuesday before Thanksgiving.

I hope that Disney LOST A LOT OF SALES BECAUSE OF THIS.  I KNOW I AM NOT HAPPY

ON THE FILM
A true classic & beloved film!!
Excellent story, characters &music.
The first animated film to be nominated for the Academy Award for Best Picture.
Like many other Disney films, it was such a shame the category of Best Animated Film was not done for this year.
Never get tired of watching the film.
I do enjoy the DVD version of the film. I always enjoy making of &behind the scenes segments.",1286323200,,1154,4.093333333333334
591241,5,6303142346,"Even considering this is a hand drawn/painted animation in the age of CG animation, the blu-ray release of Beauty and the Beast is INCREDIBLE.  WOW!

591242,5,6303142346,"Hi. Me and my sister absolutely loved this movie since 2008. When I got this DVD Combo Pack, I felt quite excited and thirsty.(Again, the DVD combo: DVD in front of 2 Blu-Ray discs and different box.) I watched it on Blu-Ray and it was so darn great. Has the best restoration and roaring sound. If you have a blu-ray player, get it. If you don't, get it if you ARE trying to get a BR player or wait till Nov. 23 for the 2-Disc DVD.

591243,1,6303142346,"ok, we all know the story and its a good one, however, we are here to rate the quality of the blu ray dvd not the movie.  I had the unfortunate displeasure of watching the remastered blu ray version.  All the colors of the original movie, extended version or not, looked washed out.  Normal skin color was so exaggerated that it looked pink and horrible, there was no detail at all.  All the characters looked washed out, no definition to their faces.  It was a nightmare.  My husband did not notice at first so I waited till the end of the movie and put in the dvd version, non blu ray, that is also included in the diamond edition and then he noticed.  He said ""Man, its like night and day, what a difference, its a much better picture on the regular dvd than blu ray"".  I also have the 2 dvd platinum edition bought many years ago and that also looks better than the blu ray.  the only reason this getting one star in my opinion is because it DOES include a regular dvd version (by the way the dvd version also has 3 different versions of the movie on it) with all its beautiful detail art work and correct coloration.  if it did not have the dvd I would rate the blu ray as a negative 2.  don't waste your money like I did on this edition.  You would regret it.",1286236800,,1265,4.160493827160494
591244,1,6303142346,"Did you hear that, everyone? Disney just opened their vault again! We better run out and buy, buy, buy before it's too late!!! I'm stunned Disney's tried and true marketing ploy continues to snag consumers (sheep) into making such impulsive decisions. Then again, ""go out and buy this combo pack which includes a disc you don't need"" would go over like a lead balloon, and we certainly don't want to put a crimp in Disney's bottom line.

The review is supposed to be about the movie, right? Yes and no. The movie is top notch, the product Disney is cramming down the consumer's throats is not. It's all a means to keep the price of the DVD just below the $25.00 mark. I don't own a Blu-Ray player, so the Blu-Ray disc is of no use to me. If you own a Blu-Ray player, why would you want the regular DVD especially since it reportedly has less features? I'm being forced into buying a $24.99 product of which only a portion is usable by me, and vice versa for Blu-Ray owners.

We've got to wake up and stop treating Disney as the sacred cow it thinks it is and realize their marketing department is a bunch of bull. I want to own this movie, I really do - but not on Disney's terms. If Disney decides to show its consumers some respect and release the DVD and Blu-Ray separately, then I'll buy their product.",1286236800,,1306,4.348360655737705
591268,5,6303142346,"Disney's Beauty and the Beast has become the quintessential animated musical, chock full of moments that have become iconic -- even to the point of parody -- since its smash debut in 1991. It was the ultimate connection of consummate talents, some who were already legendary and many of which who have become industry giants.

This is the first time in seven years that Beauty and the Beast has been issued on home video, this time in a DVD/Blu-Ray combo that kindly for DVD owners, still offers the superb audio commentary by producer Don Hahn, composer Alan Menken and directors Kirk Wise and Gary Trousdale and three versions of the film, as they appeared on the Platinum Edition.

Once again, this Diamond Edition offers yet another reason to get a Blu-Ray Player if you want to see how great the digital restoration is in all its glory. (As far as I can tell, you can't buy the DVD without getting the Blu-ray discs as well.) If you want to see some new features such as an Alternate Opening, a Deleted Scene, new games, new documentary features and a new music video. You might want to hang onto your Platinum DVD because there are a few features, including some games, that do not appear on the new edition.

Beauty and the Beast is one of those Disney classics that transcends its release date, the age of its audience and the tinge of its lesser imitators. Somehow it all works, and as the artists say themselves, even they didn't know whether it would all work but somehow it did. That's the fascinating, elusive nature of great artistry.",1286236800,,1548,4.621818181818182

If you have any appreciation for the art of animation you'll be watching this movie with your jaw dropped open the whole time.  I never would have guessed how much vivid color and sound quality was lost in the standard definition releases, but it was huge.

Belle offers to become the Beast's prisoner if he releases her father. (The Beast was cursed years ago by an enchantress. Unless someone falls in love with him as a beast, he will remain that way forever) I love how he starts out as seeming like a monster, but he turns out nice and he protects her from wolves and a hunter named Gaston.

It's such a beautiful story. Disney doesn't make these anymore. A story of a friendship, love and that beauty comes from inside. The Beast who was so ""ugly"" had this big heart and was kind when Gaston, who was such a handsome fella that all the girls loved him, was so evil.

The songs are fantastic. Tale as old as time is one of the most beautiful songs ever.

591428,1,6303142346,"This review isn't guaging the quality of the movie it's (It's my favorite Disney film as a matter of fact) this is about the apparantly large amount of bootlegs that seem to be going around for this movie. This will probably sound like a broken record to those who have read the other reviews, but I want to caution you to use descretion when making your purchase. Upon excitedly recieving this item in the mail earlier today, I noticed that something seemed off about the packaging. I tested it with my DVD player, and found that the first disk didn't work properly (but did work for others. I instantly suspected bootlegging, and I went online in order to confirm my suspicians. Indeed, my copy fit all of the specifications of a bootlegged copy.

For your conveniance, heres a list of common features in bootleg copies of this film:

-Fuzzy or indistinguished art on cover, insert, and discs with unusally washed or light coloring (as if it were cheaply printed off). All artwork should be clean and crisp (as is to be expected from Disney)

-Discs only selectivly play, may work for some players, may not for others.

-Actual content on DVD's has similar qualities to packaging, with washed or overly light coloring and fuzzy picture.

-Movie may frequently skip or glitch.

-Inner ring of the discs underside (the side without the design) reads ""Beaut and the Beast SPECIALEDITION disc 1"" or ""2"" (Intentionally mispelled as printed on the disc). Disney has explicitly stated that they do not print the DVD's name in this location, and only have a barcode. This is the best way of confirming the legality of the product.

I have sent a message to the seller complaining about this, but I doubt I will get a reply. One thing I would advise though is to extensivly check the seller before buying, esspecially how many positive service reviews they have. Looking at this persons account I see he only has 4 positive reviews of four reviews. That should have been a bit a of a giveaway, but I didn't pay attention. I'm lucky though, I only payed $20 for this, some people got ripped off for as much as $50. Overall, very disappointed, and pretty miffed.

591443,5,6303142346,"SPOILERS FOLLOW

The Walt Disney Company's 1991 animated film ""Beauty and the Beast"" is remarkable for the way it balances the demands of the classic story with its own stated aims of providing family-friendly entertainment.  This film has very little in common with the classic Jean Cocteau film of 1946, but in certain key scenes it also does not disregard the mature angles of the tale.

With the voice talents of Paige O'Hara, Robby Benson and Angela Lansbury, it opens its story in an ideal French village following a short prologue detailing the origins of the Beast.  In the village, the heroine Belle is a bit of an odd duck, always reading books and avoiding the advances of Gaston, the local brawny sportsman who rudely courts her.  She is much more interested in looking after her father, the eccentric inventor Maurice.  When Maurice gets sidetracked on his way to a tradeshow, his and Belle's lives will change forever.

The differentiating factor which marks this adaptation as Disney's own is its supreme narrative balance.  While it is very clear the Beast can be dangerous, he is much more tormented than evil.  By contrast, Gaston, who is beautiful in the eyes of the village, is a vain, soulless greedy man.

With excellent songs like ""Poor Provincial Town,"" ""Be Our Guest,"" and the stirringly romantic title song, Walt Disney's ""Beauty and the Beast"" will continue to be applauded for a long time.",1273622400,,1417,4.891213389121339

That being said Beauty and the Beast is the only movie with a set strong-willed princess (Mulan & Pocohantas & Enchanted ladies excluded).

591486,3,6303142346,"This DVD film looks great on the screen...

The packaging looks like it was created by a blind robot.  The print of the inserts is amateurish.  As if the originals were printed on a color copier.

MISSPELLINGS!  It's as if they used OCR (optical Character Recognition) to obtain the text and didn't bother to do the first spell check.  There are things in the main TITLES of the sections that make absolutely NO SENSE.  Like, ""Be Our Guest To An Al HTS!""  and ""Bonus Feature Highlig L-New DVD Experience!"" and ""Disc 1: Navigntional overview"".

These are but a tiny sampling of the mess that is the DVD insert.  Apostrophes that are commas, double-spacing that shouldn't be, words where the letters are all re-arranged, etc.

I'm starting to think that either I've been sold a bootleg or Disney's stamp ""Made in USA"" on the back isn't exactly true.

When you pay $30 for a DVD that was purchased online with no overhead, you think you might get better quality and some attention to detail.  After all, this was supposed to be a ""Platinum Edition""!  Disney's best?",1270080000,,1062,4.6702702702702705

591492,1,6303142346,"The one star is for bootlegs, not for the genuine article, which rates a five in my book.  I've seen quite a few complaints about bootlegged copies in this thread, and thought I'd throw in my two cents on the subject.  People interested in buying this item need to know that Amazon and Ebay are awash in bootlegged copies of this and other popular DVD and CD audio titles.  It's very difficult, if not impossible, for huge online sellers like Amazon and Ebay to police such activities, so it's largely up to us fans to hold the sellers' feet to the fire.  Do not buy from ANY vendor who will not guarantee, in writing, that his or her product is a 100% authentic Disney media product.  There are undoubtedly some vendors who are so brazen that they will make this guarantee even though they know it's totally false.  I received a counterfeit copy of this DVD set from an Ebay vendor, and the people who sell this trash depend on their buyers not being able to tell the difference.  Some people don't care, but for those of you who do, look for the following:

The authentic US release of this particular DVD set came inside an immaculately printed cardboard sleeve.  I believe the DVD case inside the sleeve was then encased in shrink-wrap plastic, with Disney or Buena Vista security markings printed on the wrapper.  The DVD case inside the wrapping also had separate adhesive seals on it, that had to be broken/removed in order to open the case.

Look carefully at the printing on the outer case liner.  It should be sharp and clear, with no fuzzy edges or wavy type, especially around the proof of purchase and UPC code blocks on the reverse side.  If you see any such indications of second-generation printing, it's a counterfeit.

The original DVD set included several items of printed material, placed inside the case with the disks.  If your set doesn't include this material, it's a knockoff.  If the printing on the material has the same indicia of second-generation printing as that seen on the outer case liner, it's a knockoff.

Look carefully at the disks themselves ... the printing on the face of the disks should also be immaculate.  The colors and lines where they intersect should be bright and distinct, not blotchy.  The copyright and trademark information printed around the outer edge of the disk should be fine, but very legible, and not bleeding into the underlying colors, with no misspellings or weird gaps in the type.

The playing surface of the disks should be glossy and spotless, with no nicks, marks or smudges of any kind.  If the title of the movie appears on the inner ring of the playing surface (e.g., ""Beauty and the Beast, Disc 1""), it's a knockoff.  Disney never puts such verbal markings on its authentic discs ... only code numbers.  Disc titles are laser etched into knockoff discs so that the little scumbags who are assembling the counterfeit products by hand in China and Taiwan (or wherever the counterfeits are being mass-produced) can easily identify what disks they're putting into the package.

Hope this helps, and please ... don't knowingly support people who traffic in pirated copies of copyrighted materials.  Think of the millions and millions of dollars, and incalculable number of labor hours invested by the lawful owners of products like this.  Don't help someone deprive them of the financial rewards that are rightfully theirs for the massive risk they take in bringing brilliant creative work like this to the world.

In short, demand the authentic product, and then proudly ENJOY IT!",1267488000,,3549,4.7848932676518885

This story, a classic, retells how a bold, bookworm beauty managed to tame the cruel heart of a prince enchanted into a beast. Colorful animation sequences and wonderful songs bring the story to life on the screen. The backgrounds are stunning, each hand painted with oils and each holding that special detail only a brush can capture. All of the characters are fun to follow, especially the blond triplets that adore Gaston, and even Gaston's sidekick is a riot that takes a bit away from the serious tone of the tale.

591621,5,6303142346,"For me, ""Beauty and the Beast"" is the best Disney film, and it is my favorite.  ""Wall-E"" is right up there for me, but for simple animation, it will always be ""Beauty and the Beast.""  I love how Disney has taken some of the most simple stories and made them so palpable for both children and adults.  Such life-lessons include, dealing with the loss of a parent, learning to be yourself, and the most profound of all, for me: seeing the beauty of yourself and others from the inside.

While these may seem like simple morality tales, I venture that most people would find such obstacles extremely challenging.  This is one reason why Disney films, such as this one, can easily be viewed over and over again, because like reading a good spiritual book, the lessons are always applicable.

The movie sets the tone from the start, with David Ogden Stiers as the narrator, using that great voice of his, to give us the prologue of the story; that a young prince has been transformed into a beast due to his lack of love and insight.

Beauty and the Beast has one of the best heroines, in my opinion, in Disney animation.  Belle (brilliantly voiced by Paige O'Hara) is a simple girl from a small town.  She goes against the norm for the other young women of the town, because she loves to read, and she is not afraid to speak her mind.  These are several personality traits that frequently frustrate the town's handsome suitor, Gaston; a person who all of the other young women find absolutely appealing, but for Belle, Gaston is the antithesis of the qualities she looks for in a man.  Belle is pure-hearted, and she is looking for someone who shares the same qualities.  She isn't necessarily picky.  She simply knows what she wants, and strangely enough, she finds him in the most unlikely of guises.

*You'll note that one of interesting ways that the animators make Belle stand out, is that she is the only person in town wearing blue.

The Beast is a man consumed with anger and self-loathment.  He can't even stand to look at how he used to be, as we see him rip a portrait of himself to pieces.  The first meeting between Belle and the Beast is not a happy one at all.  The Beast is unable to see his own cruelty (perhaps because this is how he has always been, and he doesn't know how to be any different) as he drags Belle's father away from her, not even thinking about her feelings at all.

Belle is able to soften the Beast, as she is able to keep up with him and his own sense of logic, which is beautifully demonstrated as the two argue back and forth after the wolf attack.  Ironically, it often takes someone else to show us what others see.  I find it interesting that the Beast's only link to the outside world is a mirror, since the mirror is his greatest asset to remind him to look within himself.  In many ways, Belle is the Beast's true mirror.  She finally begins to see something hidden beneath the anger and despair, and she helps him to see what she already sees.

The dance sequence across the ballroom floor is probably my favorite scene.  The attention to detail by the animation department is incredible...from shadows to reflections, to the embroidery of the marble pillars, and the detail of the tapestries.  This is also the climactic scene in which is becomes apparent that both Belle and the Beast love each other.  Both the animation and lighting are at their pinnacle peak during this sequence.  There is such attention to detail.  I love the way Belle is continuously moving a strand of hair from her face.

Beast demonstrates his love for Belle in the purest and noblest of ways: he lets her go.  We have all heard about how if you truly someone, you must let it go.  Love is to be given, and the Beast, despite his feelings, lets Belle go to find and be with her ill father.

There is a host of terrific characters in this film.  Gaston epitomizes the conceited, manly man who thinks of no one but himself.  I like Gaston's character because he isn't the ""evil prototype"" that we've seen in the past.  He's simply a man whose ego is larger than life, and he will never risk losing out to anyone, let alone a hairy Beast!

Jerry Orbach is terrific as Lumiere, and provides one of the best songs in the film, ""Be Our Guest"" in which every item in the kitchen is involved in an elaborate musical and dance number, with little reminders of the follies done during the 20s and 30s.

Angela Lansbury is perfectly cast as the teapot, Mrs. Potts, playing the proverbial, wise housekeeper.

Overall, the film has true charm, and anyone of any age will enjoy it.  Beauty and the Beast is a timeless classic, and the only animated film to ever be nominated for Best Picture.  The film was even converted into a Broadway show that was an instant hit.

Beauty and the Beast teaches us to leave our prejudicial judgments at the door.  It is often challenging to look within ourselves and others to see the true beauty that lies within each one of us.  Aside from being an exquisite romantic film, Beauty and the Beast serves as a reminder that there is beauty in everyone.  Are we brave enough to find it within?",1255305600,,5135,4.474193548387097

591623,1,6303142346,"The only animated movie to receive a Best Picture Oscar nomination, and it deserved it.  Magic from the opening prologue to the final credit, ""Beauty and the Beast"" is the last real classic to come from the Disney crew before John Lasseter came along. This was one of the few movies I happily paid to see twice in the cinema, and sitting in a sparsely-populated Friday night audience (I was living in Barbados at the time, and it was hardly the most artistic place on Earth... it was a crying shame that there was hardly anyone there while ""Home Alone 2"" went through the roof) the second time, the magic remained.  You all know the story, so apart from pointing out the movie's one flaw (the prince's spell had to be broken before he turned 21 or he would remain a beast forever; so if it was cast ten years before the events of the movie, wouldn't that mean he was 11 when the spell was cast...?), let's look at how well the movie works. You have a monster who's more human than the movie's medallion-man villain; you have a heroine who's PC but engaging with it; you have a supporting cast of magic utensils who wisely never upstage the couple at the centre of this love story (and despite the Disney animated trappings, it IS a love story); and you have a captivating story, beautifully told.  The movie's also got wonderful design of its French setting and characters, with the ballroom scene a standout (the tiny but appreciative audience were impressed by the sight of the Beast and Belle in their evening wear - the only time I've ever seen cartoon characters get wolf-whistled in a cinema); and Alan Menken's score is his finest work for the Mouse, with matchless lyrics from the late and much lamented Howard Ashman - how many musicals can you name where ALL the songs are brilliant? But ultimately it's the movie's very real heart that makes it a keeper; the cliche ""You'll laugh, you'll cry"" is all too true in this case. A lot of movies called 'classic' don't deserve that appellation, but this one does.  I'll be slaughtered by anime fans, but what the hell... one ""Beauty and the Beast"" is worth a thousand ""Akira""s. And ""Shrek""s. And, I'm willing to bet, ""Treasure Planet""s. This is a truly adult animated feature that's also one for the entire family. Forget ""The Silence of the Lambs"" - this is the real best picture of 1991.",1254355200,,2343,4.558194774346793

591709,5,6303142346,"Not only is this my favourite Disney feature film ever but it is also one of my top-10 favourite ever films.  It never fails to touch me whenever I watch it and it never gets old for me; especially now that this version has included a whole new previously excluded segment, ""Human Again"", and after watching it I can't imagine why they didn't include it in the first place as for me it actually improves the overall film by letting us have a glimpse at how Beauty and the Beast's relationship blossomed over time and I especially liked the scene where Beauty helps the Beast to learn how to read again.  Of course the musical number is also another brilliant Ashman/Mencken composition as well.

No matter what your feelings of Disney you cannot accuse them of non-quality output and so you get an excellent value proposition that fully utilises the scope and capabilities of the standard dvd format medium.  We get 3 versions of the movie here and I enjoyed watching each one for various reasons: the special edition for the ""new"" footage, the original version to remind me of what I first saw at the cinema and the work-in-progress version to educate me on how such animation is put together.  The second special features disc has hours of material from documentaries to interviews and even games if you are inclined to play them.

As for the main content i.e. the movie itself, the sound quality is excellent and so is the picture quality.  Ashman and Mencken's music and especially the lyrics are so good that they alone are responsible for at least 70% of what makes this film work so well.  I remember I actually bought the cassette tape of the soundtrack years ago and I wore out the tape just listening to the brilliant music.  Also the excellent voice talents that were perfectly cast and especially Angela Lansbury who ironically acted so well as one of my most despised film villains in ""The Manchurian Candidate"" and has now become my favourite character as the kind Mrs Potts here.  In fact, one of the more touching scenes for me and also one of my favourites is the part where romance first starts to blossom for Beauty and the Beast and she is singing ""Beauty and the Beast"" in the famous one-take sequence.  Having recorded a number of times before on other people's cds as a guitarist I can tell you just how hard it is to do anything on a first take and so I only have great admiration for Lansbury in being able to do this.  It's a timeless rendition and a version that ages well and will continue to do so and I'm left feeling that the 90s dated sounding Peabo Bryson/Celine Dion version of the tune at the end is a poor sounding imitation that certainly doesn't touch me as much as Lansbury's version does.

This dvd is already so good that I really can't think of anything to complain about or to suggest improvements on except perhaps that I'd like to see a Blu-ray version come out soon.

592027,5,6303142346,"*****WARNING!****** There maybe spoilers in this review for those who haven't seen the movie yet!*******

Beauty And The Beast happens to be my all time favorite Disney animated movie. I saw it in the theater at least 4 times when it was first released in 1991 and I must have watched it a dozen or so times since then. There are several reasons why Beauty And The Beast is my favorite Disney movie. For one, Belle is a heroine that many young women today can definitely relate to. Her love of reading, the fact that a man being handsome alone doesn't impress her (Gaston) and her curiousity about things makes her personality very realistic and endearing.

Another reason why Beauty And The Beast is my favorite is the music. I've never enjoyed the music in a Disney movie as much as I have this one. The clever and sometimes touching lyrics draw you in and make one caught up in the story. Songs such as ""Belle"", ""Gaston"", ""Something There""  ""Be Our Guest"" and of course the title track add so much to the overall story and give the viewer a deeper understanding of the characters.

Yet another reason is the animation. True, there are many Disney movies where the animation is dazzling, however, I'm just so drawn to (no pun intended) the animation in this movie. The scene that impresses me the most is the one where Belle and The Beast dance while Mrs. Potts sings the title song. The combination of tradiditional and computer animation has the end result being such a stunning and beautiful scene. Probably from an artistic point of view (not to mention an emotional point of view), my favorite scene from the movie.

Finally, lets not forget the story itself. I think the meaning of it is beautiful. It's about looking at the person's inside and finding the true beauty of someone's soul, which is Belle's POV.  I think we all forget sometimes about that, and this movie is a lovely reminder of that. Another lesson is how people can change, can learn and grow, which is the Beast's POV. It also demonstrates how love conquers all things, even when you think all hope is lost (the last petal of the rose falling after Belle tells the Beast that she loves him). That is a profound message.",1231113600,,2195,4.586734693877551
592028,5,6303142346,IT WAS EXACLTLY WHAT SHE WANTED FOR MY PRESENT . SHE WAS A HUGE FAN BUT THE DVD WAS IN THE VAULT AND I COULDNT FIND IT. PERFECT COPY WITH ALL THE ORIGINAL INSERTS. DVD CAME TO MY PLACE WITH NO INCIDENT OR DELAY,1230508800,,210,3.7954545454545454
592029,5,6303142346,Disney took this story and made a great film with it. I can watch this movie over and over and not get tired of it. Great music in it also.,1230336000,,139,3.6666666666666665
592030,5,6303142346,"I generally can get cranky when I consider buying a new video for my granddaughter and yet again realize that the sanitized and perfect little princess/fairy tale type animated films that Disney puts out are nevertheless the best that's out there.

You have to admit that the Disney studio knows how to tell a story, probably better than anyone in this genre, even though not all have been the home run that B&B is.

This is an old, old tale, told in many countries & cultures. I have read most of them, and ironically, all the old tales tend to get wound up in details that tend to distract one from the story line. But Disney knows what can be left out, how to create believable (if stock) characters, develop tension in the story as well as take artistic license where it adds drama and moves the story along.

And of all of Disney animated movies, Beauty and the Beast is my absolute favorite. Belle seems nearly flesh and blood; smart, curious and headstrong. She knows what she wants and learns to look in the right place. The Beast is wonderful as are the rest.

Oh! And the music is the BEST that Disney has ever offered.

Unfortunately, I was extremely disappointed with the quality of the DVD. I'm not sure if it's a bootleg copy or if it's just because my vendor shipped the Canadian version (the DVD box was white), but other people have complained about Disney shoehorning too much stuff onto the DVD.

The quality of the images is inconsistent. In some places, it looks chunky and lo res. Belle's Papa's eye color keeps changing.
But worst of all, my 6-month-old DVD player keeps putting a blue bar across the top of the screen with a little movie projector icon every time there's a difference between the regular and work-in-progress edition.

I'm ready to give the DVD to Goodwill and wait for the next version to come out. Buy Sleeping Beauty, Cinderella or Snow White and wait it out.",1225238400,,917,4.545454545454546

When watching, if you want to watch your favorite classic version without the crappy new song 'human again' you have to go and select the original theatrical version from the main menu.
It is horrible mostly when you are showing this movie to one of your younger cousins or siblings who haven't seen the mvie yet, and you want them to get the good experience, with all the songs you love. Not the okay experience with MOST of the songs you loved but that one near the end which was not nearly as good as the others.

There's no need to repeat all the other reviewers' remarks - I can only say I got into this thanks to my children, and I will be enjoying it for the rest of my life (along with a number of other Disney classics like Dumbo, Lady and the Tramp and Jungle Book).  The characterizations, voice and animated, of all the characters is beyond description.  This is the last Disney animated feature I've seen where I appreciated the computer-assisted animation (the ballroom scene is unbelievable).  I consider Disney's output to have reached its absolute climax with this film - it's been all downhill since.

It's not a huge deal because you can change the DVD setting to play the original feature film but I feel the original should have been the default option.  Second thing that bothered me about the DVD is that some of the AUDIO WAS CUT OUT from the opening song!  Maybe it's just my DVD but I noticed two gaps in audio (since I know all the words).  The first gap is after the two old ladies say ""that girl is strange, no question"" and the second break in audio is after she goes to the bookstore.  The lyric ""Look there she goes that girl is so peculiar, I wonder if she's feeling well"" is cut out.

Aside from that, the movie is great for all ages.  The cut out audio makes me wish I hadn't gotten rid of my VHS version.",1204675200,,1063,4.171568627450981

592225,4,6303142346,"Beauty and the Beast (Platinum Edition) is a two disc set; the first disc contains several versions of the film and some bonus features, while the second disc is comprised entirely of bonus features.

The menu for the first disc is in a street sign motif (the street sign is designed to be like one from the little village where Belle and her father lived). From here, you can choose to play the movie (which will automatically default to the Special Edition version), setup (choose the spoken language and whether or not you want English for the hearing impaired captions), scene selection (the scene selection was done in a storybook setting, and there are 22 scene selections in all), see the bonus material, see an intro for a game that appears on disc two, and see ""sneek peaks"" of upcoming Disney releases (there are a total of seven ""sneak peeks"").

If you go into the bonus features, you can choose to see the Special Edition version of the film (with or without audio commentary), the original theatrical film, the ""work in progress"" version of the film that was shown at the New York Film Festival in 1991, or you can see the film with a ""Sing-Along"" track to sing along with the songs in the film. The only thing different about the Special Edition is that a song originally cut from the film (""Human Again"") is put back in; personally, I thought the new sequence helped to enhance the story. You get to see the enchanted objects excited about becoming human again, and you also get to see Belle and the beast getting even closer than you did in the original film. The ""work in progress"" version was interesting to watch, in order to see some of the animatics and storyboards for the sections of the film that were not completed in time for the festival; however, this is not a version of the film that I would watch very often. The audio commentary for the Special Edition was amusing and entertaining, and you learned a lot about what went on behind the scenes.

Also included in the bonus material is ""Maurice's Invention Workshop Game,"" where a player helps Chip finish building Maurice's machine to get a code to open the castle door for the ""Break the Spell"" game on disc two. In order to play this game, the viewer needs to answer questions about the film by choosing one of the objects on the side of the screen that answers the question; the interface for this is to choose the answer by using the arrow keys on the player's remote. I thought the interface was a little cumbersome, and, overall the questions were rather simple (I assume this was done in order to make it easier for young kids to play the game).

The second disc's menu has a stained glass window motif. There are four stained glass windows: Cogsworth and Lumiere, Chip, Mrs. Potts, and the rose (which is an entrance to the forbidden ""west wing""). The first time you click on the rose window, the beast growls about that being the west wing, and that it is forbidden to go there. If you click on it a second time, it takes you to the ""Break the Spell"" game. You use the code you got from the game on disc one and enter the castle. You and Chip see in the magic mirror that the glass case has blown off the rose during the storm. You must follow Chip and complete tasks on the way. For each mistake you make, one petal falls off the rose. When five petals have fallen, the game is over, and no one becomes human again. I can't say much about the actual game itself, because I never made it past the first task (trying to avoid hitting candles on the dining table).

If you choose Cogsworth and Lumiere's window, you get a lot of the background information about the film and musical (documentary-type pieces, artwork, etc.). Included here are ""Origins of Beauty and the Beast,"" development (which includes an early presentation reel), story (which includes an alternate version of ""Be Our Guest"" and the deleted song ""Human Again"" with storyboards), music (which includes an alternate score for the beast's transformation and the deleted song ""Human Again"" with storyboards), production design (including galleries for concept art, design and layouts, and backgrounds), animation (including animation tests, roughs, clean ups, and a pencil version of the beast's transformation), tricks of the trade (including a camera move test), release and reaction (including awards, Howard Ashman: In Memoriam, two theatrical trailers and four TV spots, original release and large format publicity galleries, and the music video for Celine Dion and Peabo Bryson's version of the theme song), and the Broadway musical (musical publicity gallery and costume design gallery).

If you choose Chip's window, you get ""Disney's Animation Magic"" (a documentary hosted by the young stars of ""Even Stevens,"" which is designed to show kids how animation is done), the video for Jump 5's version of the theme song, and ""Chip's Musical Challenge Game."" In the game, the player watches what objects are chosen for making the music, then the player must choose the items in the exact same order; again, this game utilizes the arrow buttons on the remote. This game was definitely intended for kids; as an adult, I found it to be rather tedious.

If you choose Mrs. Potts' window, you get some documentaries, the music video for Celine Dion and Peabo Bryson's version of the theme song (which opens with Celine Dion talking about the song, and closes with an ad for soundtracks featuring Beauty and the Beast music), and ""Mrs. Potts' Personality Profile Game"" (after choosing your gender, Mrs. Potts asks you multiple choice questions; from your answers, she determines which Beauty and the Beast character you are most like). The main documentary, ""Tales as Old as Time: The Making of Beauty and the Beast,"" runs about 28 minutes long, is bookended by an opening and a closing by Celine Dion, and includes interviews with a number of people involved with the film. The other ""documentaries"" are ""The Story Behind the Story,"" where celebrity hosts reveal the stories behind seven other Disney films; this includes an introduction hosted by Celine Dion. Personally, I wonder why ""The Story Behind the Story"" section was included, since it has nothing to do with Beauty and the Beast (and the DVD already has quite a few extras on it).

The magic mirror, which is also part of the interface of disc two, shows everything available.

Despite the few faults I think the Beauty and the Beast (Platinum Edition) has, I feel that this DVD is a must-have for any DVD library.",1195084800,,6527,4.748677248677248
592226,5,6303142346,"I know this can be considered a book review but please humor me.  I just finished reading a beautiful book by Robin McKinley entitled ""Beauty - a retelling of the story of Beauty and the Beast.""  It is a wonderful book and I highly recommend it. The imagery is so imaginative and vivid, I could swear I'd read it before. Then I realized that, though I hadn't read this book before, I had seen it. Disney's beautiful version of Beauty and the Beast uses much of the imagery McKinley utilizes in her book. I'm not saying that the stories are by any means identical. For example McKinley's story is quite a bit different than Disney's tale in that Beauty has two sisters (who aren't ugly or wicked) who figure prominently in the story. It is the imagery that is similar. The candles and lamps that light themselves, a magical teapot, a magical and self-serving feast that dances across a very long dining table, a huge and friendly Clydesdale-like horse, a walking footstool, a magic rose that signals the end of the beast's chance at love, a magical wardrobe in Beauty's room, birds that eat from her hand, the beast's inability to manage silverware when eating, a stained glass window that describes the downfall of a privileged young man, a mirror-like table through which Beauty can view her family's activities, and much more - right up to the bells, chimes, fireworks and wind that accompany the Beast's metamorphosis. Also, Disney's Beast is a nearly identical physical match for the Beast described by McKinley. The similarities were so uncanny that I popped in my old VHS copy of Disney's movie to view the credits. So much of Disney's animated imagery is lifted directly from McKinley's novel - which was written in 1978 - that I could not believe McKinley's name did not appear in the story credits! How unfair! I wonder if McKinley consulted a lawyer. Be that as it may, if you love this movie, you will love reading this book.",1191974400,,1936,4.6911764705882355
592277,5,6303142346,"This story is a lot more appealing now that it's out on DVD. It looks and sounds super. The colors are bold, bright and just plain gorgeous. The sound separation is excellent. If you have a nice surround system, you'll be pleasantly surprised with this.

The story is nothing extraordinary but decent with a lot of subtle humor mixed in with it, mainly with the talking objects in the castle. Little ""teacup"" is the cutest of the characters. The songs, with the exception of the title tune and a Busby Berkeley-type number, are nothing to write home about.

Still, when you look at the whole picture, this is a solid movie and probably one of the Disney's all-time best animated movies.",1189987200,,686,4.661157024793388
592278,5,6303142346,"There a lot of Disney films based off of fairy tales; Snow White, Cinderella, Sleeping Beauty, Aladdin, and The Little Mermaid to name a few.  While, Cinderella and Snow White remain favorites to this day, Beauty and the Beast is probably the only one that is consistently funny, has good songs, and a great cast of characters.

  If one has not seen ""Beauty and the Beast"", the basic story goes: Belle is a bookish woman who doesn't fit in, but as her name suggest, her beauty is unparalleled.  Her father is an eccentric inventor and is trying to become a famous inventor.  When he stumbles across the Beast's castle, he is on the way to an inventor's contest, and then he is imprisoned by the Beats who is incapable of love.  This is a very touching film because the Beast is a man who has never learned to love, and Belle has a hard time loving someone who would imprison her or her father, but eventually as time goes by, she begins to see that he is not as bad as he seemed.  It gives wonderful message that you cannot always judge someone based upon their looks, and sometimes you just need to really know a person before you can decide whether or not they are worth knowing - despite first impressions.

  Admittedly I had not watched ""Beauty and the Beast"" since it came out, until recently, and I had forgotten that it is more than a children's film.  The story is very predictable, but is filled with so much fabulous music, characters with actual depth, and beautiful animation it overshadows the story.  This movie has the perennial heroine that all the other Fairy Tale Disney movies have.  Yet, this is the only Disney movie that gets the female lead right.  She's smart, sassy (not bratty), beautiful, and can take care of herself.  She doesn't desire the best looking man which is why Gaston holds no interest for her.  She is the kind of woman that I would feel comfortable letting my kids watch in a movie.

  The only caution I would give, is that there is mild sexual innuendo most of it is from ""Lumiere"" (A character reminiscent of Honore Lachaille in 'Gigi') the candlestick. :)  However, it is mild, and not blatant or bad enough to deter you from letting your children watch it.  It is after all based in France, you have to expect a little bit of that.

  Overall, this is one of Disney's crowning achievements, and should be in any one's movie collection!

592280,5,6303142346,"This is the film which set the high bar of standards for all other animated films to try to meet. After Disney's success with 1989's ""The Little Mermaid"", the studio was quickly on the road to recovery after a dismal record of not-so-great productions (anyone remember ""The Black Cauldron""?). Then came the masterpiece: ""Beauty and the Beast"", a handsomely detailed film that's satisfying on all levels of story, animation and music.
How good is it? It's the only animated film (so far) to have received an Oscar nomination for Best Picture, so you know that this film lives up to all the hype surrounding it.
This quaint period story begins with Belle, a young woman in a close-minded French town whose people label her ""odd"" and ""loony"" for spending her time reading books. Constantly pursued by a swaggering, loutish, narcisstic brute named Gaston to marry him, Belle finds shelter within the pages of her books, expanding her knowledge and imagination. But her life changes forever when her eccentric inventor-father stumbles upon a dark castle while lost in the woods. There, he encounters the hideous, frightening Beast, who imprisons him for trespassing. Belle agrees to remain as a ""guest"" at the castle in exchange for her father's freedom. As the narrator tells us at the beginning of the film, the Beast was once a handsome prince whose uncaring vanity forced a sorceress to place a powerful curse upon him and his castle, which can only be broken by true love. And there begins the heart of the story, as Belle attempts to reveal the ""beauty"" within the Beast and forge love & understanding between them (which, of course, turns out to be not-so-easy!).
Robby Benson & Mary Kay Bergman voice the title characters (who would've guessed such a soft-spoken actor as Benson would possess such a powerful lower register?). The supporting cast includes a wide assortment of talking, dancing & singing household items (the Prince's servants transformed under the curse), brought to life by such wonderfully diverse voice talents as Angela Lansbury (Miss Potts), the late Jerry Orbach (Lumiere), and David Odgen Stiers (Cogsworth).
The songwriting team of Ashman & Menken compose a musical score for a Disney film that's the most memorable ever. I dare you not to tap your foot while hearing such tunes as ""Be Our Guest"" or fall under the spell of the title song.
And the film helped launch Disney into sort of a ""renaissance"" period as they followed with one great film after another: ""Aladdin"", ""The Lion King"", ""Pocahontas"", ""The Hunchback of Notre Dame"", ""Hercules"", ""Mulan"" and ""Tarzan"".
Sometimes haunting, sometimes frightening, and often joyous in its imagery & storytelling, ""Beauty and the Beast"" is Disney at its peak of perfection. No Disney collection would be complete without it!",1187827200,,2798,5.032327586206897
592281,5,6303142346,"""Beauty and the Beast"" is one of the treasures of the Disney catalog.

Anyone who wants to see where great Broadway musicals were being written in the 90s should look at this film. The songs by Alan Mencken and Howard Ashman are masterful.

The classic story is beautifully realised by directors Gary Trousdale and Kirk Wise. Beautifully sung and voice-acted by the talented cast. You would have to be hard of heart to not be moved by the finale.

Coming after ""The Little Mermaid"", the success of this ""traditional"" animated film inspired the resurgence of the previously moribund animation genre in the 90s, which has continued through until today.",1186012800,,650,4.944954128440367

  You see, I'm 19 now, almost 20 and this is one movie I've always cherished since childhood. When the narration begins about the Prince,goes to the title, and on, the movie hooks me into a realm of fantasy and romance.

  While I'm not too big on romance stories in book form, Disney does it right in this film. A raging, yet sorrow-filled beast who secretly falls in love with a strong-willed woman. First off, they don't like each other, but the relationship blossoms and grows up to where they fight for each other- this is true love in its purest form.

  I admit with pride, that I cry at certain scenes, mostly the Transformation scene at the end of the film. The music is lively, the acting is superb, and the memories that remain in my heart  are fond.

  Parents, please, please, PLEASE show this film to your children- I firmly believe that they, like myself and many others will fall in love with this film, and many other Disney classics.

It's a close call, but this one is possibly the best of the four with 'Aladdin' featuring the madcap voice of Robin Williams a close second.

`Beauty and the Beast' scores high marks in every category; storyline, character development, animation and cinematography, sound and music that says with you long after the final credits roll by. The only possible negative I can come up with about the release of this particular version is the inclusion of the song `To be Human Again.' It is rather redundant and definitely not equal to the caliber of the rest of the soundtrack.

Our heroine is, of course, the lovely Belle, who gives her freedom up so that her father can be released from Beast's castle.  Beast's servants, especially Lumiere, Cogsworth, and Mrs. Potts, devise a plan for Belle to fall in love with Beast in order to break the curse that all of them suffer from.  Of course, much like in ""Frankenstein,"" that which is misunderstood is considered a monster and Belle's arrogant would-be suitor, Gaston, sets out to free his damsel-in-distress.

The voice cast is wonderful.  It includes Robby Benson (Beast), Angela Lansbury (Mrs. Potts), Jerry Orbach (my favorite, Lumiere), David Ogden Steirs (Cogsworth/Narrator), and Paige O'Hara as Belle.  Richard White portrays the selfish oaf, Gaston, and does a wonderful job.

The music is top notch.  Composed by Alan Menken and given lyrics by Howard Ashman, the songs are some of the best and most memorable in Disney's catalogue.  From ""Be Our Guest"" to ""Gaston,"" they are all winners here.

The animation is classic and contemporary at the same time.

The DVD is nice.  It comes complete with the original and special editions of the film and a plethora of wonderful documentaries on the making of the film, it's music, and many other things as well.

You would be wise to add this masterpiece to your collection.  I highly recommend it.",1170806400,,1807,4.786407766990291

592324,5,6303142346,"I'm a Disney nut anyway but this film along with The Lion King and The Little Mermaid are there greatest masterpieces! The score is breathtaking,the songs a mixture of fun(Belle,Be Our Guest,etc.),malice(The Mob Song),and grand emotion (Beauty and the Beast).This wonderful score quality has disappeared in recent years at Disney and sadly will probably never be seen again. But then,this type of movie,the Disney Musical,will probably never be seen again. Along with the spectacular score is the exquisite animation. This so-called ""outdated""style,the 2-D style,is infinitely superior to the cold,unimaginative,3-D style that is now the rage. With the exception of the Pixar films and the first shrek,these movies are generally atrocious. They have none of the warmth and astounding emotional quality that this film posseses in abundance. Also,the voices in this film are perfect,and being a M*A*S*H fan,I get quite a kick out of hearing David Ogden Stiers as Cogsworth,the stuffy clock. This movie is a true classic from start to finish,and with this spectacular 2-Disc Platinum Edition DVD,the film can be viewed in all it's glory. The extras are perfect and should not be missed. Also,the picture is restored to crystal clear perfection,and there is a new song incorporated to complete the experience! Get this along with the special edition soundtrack.

592767,5,6303142346,"Beauty and the Beast may well be the very best animated film Disney ever produced.  The characterizations of the leads are great as we have the sweet book loving Belle and the the flawed but totally redeemable ""Beast"".  Gaston and Belle's father are also well drawn and memorable as are the comic relief bearing ""enchanted"" servants at the castle.  There's something for everyone as the story is so romantic it leaves a lot of grown up ladies sighing, the bad guys are not too scary for the little ones and for the rest it is just a great tale.  Plus Beauty and the Beast has some of the best songs ever written for a Disney production.  No wonder the Broadway musical has  been such a hit as well.",1160697600,,698,4.4140625
592768,5,6303142346,"I must've been about 10 when I first saw the Lion King and I was practically floored. Those catchy-for-their-own-good songs, the animation(well, me now talking) and that wildebeast stampede. The other one is Beauty and the Beast which for the life of me I can't remember seeing when I was young yet loved every minute of it. Revisiting it now I still love it and on one hand seeing it as a landmark in Disney's catalogue but also one in a series of films that marked a brief creative comeback.

Belle is a beautiful bookworm girl living in a small village. Nose deep in books while having a kooky inventor for a father, many find her odd. However, she does attract the attention of seriously full of himself Gaston, a hunter who can probably single-handedly take women back a few hundred years. Meanwhile, in a distant castle, a Beast lurks; transformed because of a spell unless he gets true love before a magical rose loses its last petal. Eventually these 2 will meet but can they fall in love?

After a decidedly less than perfect 80's period, the Little Mermaid brought the House of Mouse back and showed they can still pull it off. Then came this which was extremely successful and even garnered a Best Picture nod, the only animated film to do so. Also it's one of the few it seems that seems entirely built on a love story and character development. Unlike Ariel who instantly fell in love just by looking at the guy, Belle in fact hates him then grows to love him. This focus allows the film a different atmosphere than others.

The one problem, a really minor nitpick, is that the songs aren't as fantastic. Yes we have Be Our Guest or the hilarious Gaston but I'm not the biggest fan of There May Be Something...and Angela Lansbury's rendition of the title track ruins what's a great cinematic moment. I do have a particular liking for the opening track Belle though. Where the film also excels is the animation. Certain scenes aren't as eye-popping but the opening title has a beautiful background, Belle is a gorgeous design and Beast is a great animated character.

Thanks to Disney, the film has been put back into the Vault so you can't find it now unless you're willing to drain your paycheck on Ebay. If you can even find it, it's definately worth a recommendation.",1160438400,,2283,4.588235294117647
592769,5,6303142346,"2010 Update: Buy this now! If you wait you may end up writing a review that mirrors the following review that I wrote below in 2006....

It's so wonderful to live in a time when Disney's strange behavior of taking their classics off the market can be circumvented by great Internet marketers like Amazon. I was able to buy this 5 Star Disney Princess classic just last week for my young princess through one of Amazon's third-party sellers. And without that opportunity, my little princess may have outgrown Beauty and the Beast by the time Disney released it again.

Let me just say that my little one was absolutely captivated by Beauty and the Beast, and to think that she would be deprived by Disney itself from seeing it at her perfect age is criminal.

There are plenty of other reviews here to discuss the movie's contents, so I won't go on about that. I will say that you should take advantage of purchasing Beauty and the Beast now via one of this site's resellers if you have a little princess that might not appreciate it as much when Disney decides that it's time.

And indeed, you will enjoy Beauty and the Beast as thoroughly as your young one.

Side Note on Resellers: Beware of exorbitant reseller prices; renting may be a better option if available. Also beware of REGION 2 resales; Region 2 DVDs will not play in most US DVD players. Look for Region 1 US Amazon resellers.",1156204800,,1390,4.544

Firstly because the story is very well and the romantic story beetwen Belle and the Beast is the best I've ever seen. Sometimes I think where can be a woman like Belle? where can I find her??? She is pretty, intelligent, brave, affectionanated, a good friend and of course she is very kind.

Another thing that I would like to stand out is that songs are really good as well in English as in Spanish.

Well I cann't explain how much I like this movie. THE BEST.",1155254400,,619,4.318965517241379

now i get to the music. WOW!!! this is a fantastic score, possibly one of the greatest musical scores of all time. the intensity and passion of every song is unbelievable for any movie, let alone a disney film. the songs themselves have a wonderful broadway feel and are all catchy and unique. again they are all powerful and fun.

Although i'm just a little biased, this movie deserved to win the oscar for best motion picture, and i don't know why it didnt. as i said, this is a great film in the disney cannon and on it's own. this is truely the best of the best!",1153958400,,1063,4.5025906735751295

592774,5,6303142346,"It's become a bit of a cliche term when referring to Disney films, but I truly and honestly believe that this film is a timeless, spellbinding and magical classic. ""Beauty and the Beast"" was just one film in a string of masterpieces that Disney produced in 6 or so years. ""The Little Mermaid,"" started, followed by this film, then ""Aladdin,"" and the ""The Lion King."" It's much like what Pixar is experiencing now with THEIR beautiful films, from Toy Story to their latest Cars. However, as much as I love Pixar's films (and believe me when I say I'm a BIG fan of them) they simply don't have the sheer electricity that Disney animation have... or USED to have. It makes me slightly sad, now that computer animation has become the primary way of animation, that the next generation will never be able to FULLY grasp the delight of these particular Disney films, and let's not forget ""Snow White,"" ""Cinderella,"" ""Peter Pan,""... need I go on? My point is, Disney had such a great thing going with these masterpieces... then they just stopped. And THAT is why it's slightly sad.

Despite this, it IS so wonderful to know that these Disney films ARE still so joyfully remembered. ""Beauty and the Beast"" is certainly no exception. With everything from beautiful, colourful animation, a delightful set of characters and simply amazing music and songs, this film replenishes our imagination with the wonders and hopes of any great love story.

Belle is an intelligent young woman living in her modest French town when a twist of fate draws her to an enchanted and somewhat haunted castle in the woods. What she discovers is an array of talking objects, from candlesticks to feather dusters of whom are servents to the master of the castle - a great beast. As sour first impressions fade, Belle and the beast form a close bond. Unbeknown to Belle, the beast is in fact a prince, burdened by a spell that requires the kiss of love to break it. The story is about looking past outer appearences and loving the person underneath the skin.

Despite the universal and important theme, true to Disney form, this film is not preachy, but subtly conveys these ideas through the beautiful characters and music combined. The music, as I mentioned before is simply outstanding. A deeply moving and powerful score, teamed with charming songs gives this film its timeless aura, which still hasn't faded fifteen years on.

You can obviously tell by now that I am a Disney fan through and through. These films, particularly this one, have been a part of my childhood, my education, and my shaping as a person. Words really cannot describe the joy these films give me time and time again, and I can quite garantee that many people, young and old feel the same way. These aren't just films, their building blocks that build the soul.",1150156800,,2807,4.734151329243354

592827,5,6303142346,"""Beauty and the Beast"" is an excellent animation movie that is a timeless classic. The movie is a marvellous plot, beautiful music and remarkable art cinematography.

My two young daughters are enchanted by Belle, who they see as a role model. She is exceptionally brave, very intelligent, unselfish and pretty and cannot be pushed around by anyone. She refused to marry the most eligible man in the village because of his despicable character and she falls in love with the beast because of its beauty within, not outside appearance. (The beast risks his life to rescue Belle from a pack of wild animals and he frees her so that she can be re-united with her sick father.)

This is a moving film that has won an Oscar. It teaches a great lesson to children that it is a person's heart that matters, not what they own, their status in society or other outward appearances. This is exquisite entertainment for the whole family. Every kid should see this movie.",1147046400,,959,4.7023809523809526
592828,5,6303142346,"This certainly is not the first time Disney has taken a known Fairy tale or fable and put a little ""Disney"" twist on it and turned it into a feature movie, but this has to be the best adaptation of a fair tale Disney has ever done.

The story is known by all, but Disney adds such a great twist to it, that it will seem to the person watching like a fresh story they had never heard before.  When Belle goes to the castle of the Beast she finds that the whole castle is enchanted, with living inanimate objects (like candlesticks, clocks, and such).  The story, plot, is so good that it rivals any movie EVER made animated or live action.

Another hi-point to this movie is the music.  The songs by Mrs. Potts, Lumiere, Belle, and Gaston are fun, and you'll probably be humming the music longer after the movie is over.

This is the first time that Beauty and the Beast has made it onto DVD in the Platinum Edition, and it is well deserved.  One thing that makes this movie edition so good is the bonus features found in all the platinum editions from Disney.

This movie truly is a classic even though it's less than twenty years old.

Being a fairy tale enthusiast, I don't mind the changes they made. In the original tale, the villains are her family, who try to keep her from going back to the dying beast. Conceited and rude Gaston was a perfect foil against the endearing and kind Beast. The objects were given a much bigger role, but the characterization was solid and the story fit them in very well. Oh, and for a previous poster who mentioned the Disney happy ending-the original fairy tale has her arriving before he dies and telling him she loves him, thus setting him free and giving them a happily ever after. The Disney version is amazingly accurate to the story, also seeing as it was originally a French fairy tale, and I've always felt it was a more than adequate translation of one of the best fairy tales and love stories ever written.",1135382400,,976,4.4581005586592175
592831,5,6303142346,"Best Disney film ever made, and this will not change.  In my opinion this is when Disney was at its peak.  I'm typically viewed as anything but romantic, but this really hits the emotional chords I tell you.  People are always stunned to see it's one of my favorite movies, with me being a pretty macho type usually.  I must admit, it nearly bring out the tears, so give it a try on some tough guys you know!  It is perfect in every way, I could not recommend something more strongly.  It has the songs, the comedy, romance, action, drama, strong and memorable characters, you name it.  The female lead is strong too, really a great persona.  Of all the Disney heroines, my favorite one, nobody else can even come close.  The theme song is unbeatable, beautifully done by Celine Dion and some other fellow.  Her best song too, ha why not add that accolade as well.

It's great for winter time, as that is when the movie takes place (in France too, nice and classy+accents if you excuse the politics--which aren't present in the movie, I didn't mean to imply that).  Well I don't know anyone who hasn't seen this movie, but if you are one of those then you are missing out big time.  See it, have your kids see it, friends, relatives, dates, and anybody else you can persuade, or coerce!

592832,4,6303142346,"As Beauty and the Beast is my all-time favorite movie, it hurts me to have to take away a star from this review. However, I have a few problems that keep me from giving it a full 5 stars.

By now, we all know the story of this beautiful film. We know the songs by heart, and it doesn't need to be mentioned that this is still the only animated movie to recieve an Academy Award nomination for Best Picture. However, this DVD offers THREE versions - the ""original theatrical version"" which is the ""Special Edition"" but without the Human Again song that's in the ""Special Edition"" and a new version of the Work-In-Progress edition, previously available only on laserdisc and VHS in the deluxe box set Disney released in 1992. If you get a chance, please watch the Work-In-Progress edition.

This DVD also includes a plethora of bonus features for kids and adults alike. Games for the kids, and serious behind-the-scenes materials, trailers, TV spots, galleries, etc. for the adults.

However, I have some gripes about the transfer - namely edge enhancement. Cramming three versions of the movie onto one disc was a bad idea. In my opinion, the Work-In-Progress edition should have been on disc two. Also, I'm not too happy with how the film has been lightened up. The film was intended to have dark, muted colors. However, despite these flaws, the movie still retains all the beauty and charm I fell in love with nearly 15 years ago. And I love the newly added song, Human Again. Now, the original theatrical version feels empty to me.

I'm also not too happy with how the bonus features sometimes appear in more than one spot, such as the Celine Dion music video appearing in two spots and having two versions of the making-of docu...one substantially longer, having more material, etc. It makes it look as if Disney padded this disc so it'd look like there were more bonuses than there are.

However, I can't NOT recommend this DVD, but that's only because I'm absolutely biased. Unfortunately, it is now out of print, and copies tend to be expensive on eBay and Amazon Marketplace. However, it's definitely worth it, especially if you can get it used for a good price, and if a disc doesn't work, call 1-800-72-DISNEY, and for a fee of about $7, you can have the discs replaced through Disney's Disc Replacement Program.

In conclusion, please don't hesitate to get this if you're willing to pay a good amount of money for it or if you're willing to risk buying it used. It's a gorgeous movie, and the bonus features are good. Despite my few gripes, it's worth the price.",1129075200,,2572,4.654185022026431

592924,5,6303142346,"Disney Animated Studios outdid themselves making this movie.  Once again truly another classic worth adding to your collection.  In my quest to ""re-experience"" everything from my younger years, I decided to watch every Disney movie I could get my hands on.  Beauty and the Beast truly stands the test of time along with the other animated classics that Disney has made.  A wonderful blend of hand-drawing and compuer animation made for one of the best animated pictures ever to be conceived from the folks at Disney.

The great thing about a movie like this is a depiction of a strong character.  In this case, Belle is quite a strong character indeed; specifically sacrificing her own life to save her father from the clutches of the Beast.  Disney does a good job of creating coming-of-age stories.  The evolution of the Beast is a good example of this.  Although the Beast looks the same throughout most of the movie, he truly evolves as a character thanks to the warm and loving nature of Belle's character.  Today's society can easily learn morals coming from this movie, specifically the fact that true beauty lies within.

Without a doubt the movie itself deserves 5 stars without question.  Memorable music is also what makes the movie as great as it is.  Alan Menken is a pure genious (sorry, I can't remember the other music geniouses who contributed to the making of Beauty and the Beasts' musical score).

Overall this is an excellent movie that's worth putting in anybody's collection.  The special features are a great bonus and you will gain much info on the creation of this great movie.",1127433600,,1603,4.82051282051282

592929,5,6303142346,"The only animated feature to be nominated for ""Best Picture"", this film was the peak of Disney's artistic musical animations. Right after the success of ""The Little Mermaid"" Disney went ahead with ""Beauty & the Beast"" (Walt Disney wanted to do the film for years and sadly didn't live to see it realized). But today it is great to remember Disney during its artistic Renaissance (From ""The Little Mermaid to ""The Lion King""). ""Beauty and the Beast"" has not only great musical numbers, and beautiful backgrounds, but also great characters and an emotionally appealing story. While I think the only realistic character (in terms of motivation and emotion) was the Beast, I found that Belle was a well-realized heroine who in a twist saves the hero with her emotional strength and kindness. The timelessness of the story was well brought out in the title song that played during one of the most romantic scenes ever in animation. This is a film that shows the importance of looking for the beauty within. It also celebrates the life-changing effects that friendship and love can bring. A Masterpiece.",1124150400,,1097,4.935135135135135
592930,5,6303142346,"""Beauty and the Beast"" is a fanomenal film, loved by both adults and children. You may find yourself wonder how can a movie (especially an animated one) get so many positive reviews, as B&B has. Name at least two titles this critically acclaimed! You can't think of any? No wonder, ""Beauty and The Beast"" was the first animated feature to be nominated to the Academy Award for the Best Picture. Everything about the movie is just perfect - Alan Menken's breathtaking music, the animators' solid work, stunning backgrounds and, what's the most notable, the wonderful voice actors. The leading duo Belle and the Beast, was voiced by the wonderful Paige O'Hara and Robby Benson. Thanks to Paige, Belle has the most adorable and enchanting voice of all the Disney heroines, and Robby makes the Beast a multi-dimensional character, either scary and majestic or sensitive and caring. All the side-kicks are also highly entertaining and original.

What more can I say? Don't hestitate for a second and get this amazing masterpiece now. ""Beauty and The Beast"" is the one of the finest movies ever made!!!",1123804800,,1096,4.956521739130435

This is what the Studio did best, a classic fairy tale, well planned animation, top notch musical numbers and characters that actually mean something. I guess they lost their touch after Mulan.  I liked Atlantis, but it was a far cry from Beauty and the Beast.

592932,5,6303142346,"Beauty and the Beast is the story of Belle, a girl living in a small French village who dreams of adventure. She is considered strange in her town because she is always reading, and sees the handsomest man in town, Gaston, not as a dreamy potential fiance, but as the rude, conceited man he really is. Belle's father stumbles upon the enchanted castle of the Beast, which will remain under a spell until the Beast, formerly a handsome prince, learns to love, which must happen by his twenty-first birthday. Belle comes to rescue her father, and agrees to take his place as the Beast's prisoner. Although the Beast seems harsh and bad-tempered at first, Belle and the Beast learn to love each other, to the displeasure of Gaston, who finds out about Belle's friendship with the Beast, and had planned on marrying Belle himself.

This is an amazing movie, definitely my favorite of all of the Disney movies, and it could be my all-time favorite movie, too. The characters are so lively and full of personality. The Beast's servants, who have been turned into objects under the spell, add a lot to the movie. The musical numbers are fantastic - the humorous ""Gaston,"" the flashy ""Be Our Guest,"" and, of course, the breathtakingly beautiful ballroom scene, where Belle and the Beast dance to ""Beauty and the Beast."" This is a great movie for people of any age, and a must-see for people who have enjoyed other Disney movies.",1122249600,,1420,4.725806451612903

592984,5,6303142346,"The Little Mermaid saw Disney back on from, but Beauty and the Beast cemented the studio's reputation as a major driving force in revolutionary animation. The film would go on to be nominated for the Academy Award for Best Film. A pity that the recent new category of 'Best animated film' wasn't around back in 1991, Beauty and the Beast would have been a shoe in. Regardless, this is a landmark film that deserves all the praise that critics give it, and it is also my No. 1 favorite animated movie. The style is particularly intriguing, playing more like live action rather than the cartoony antics of 70s Disney. Intentional no doubt, and it works to a high standard. The voice work is notably impressive, especially in the new song created for the DVD `Human Again'. It is indeed a rare thing to experience a perfect movie, especially in the era of heartless 3D rubbish like Shark Tale and Madagascar. Again Alan Menkin and Howard Ashman's influence in story and songwriting is to the fore, and the fantastically detailed animation is a treat to the eye. So much love and care has been put into this movie, and unlike previous offerings, Beast has a perfect blend of catchy songs, unforgettable characters and surprisingly emotionally driven drama.

592986,5,6303142346,"Beauty and the Beast has been regarded as one of the best animated features of all times. Without going too far, we can assure it's one of the ten best and now we can have it on a Special Edition DVD, restored with remastered sound.

For those who don't know the story: Belle is a beautiful girl living with her father (an inventor) in a XVIII France town. She's a fan of books, and has captured the attention of the town most coveted bachelor, Gaston, but is not willing to become a simple housewife. When her father is being kept in a horrible Beast's castle, Belle decides to save him taking his place as the Beast's prisoner. The Beast is actually a spoiled prince under a spell. Once in the castle, belle makes a few friends (servers under the spell too) and learns that true beauty lies inside people.

Wonderful music numbers, a perfect story which balances comedy and drama and exquisite animation makes Beauty and the Beast a true cinematic gift for everyone, regardless of age.

Beauty and the Beast is a wonderful experience to relive; capable of giving us so many emotions as no other picture of its time has accomplished (the exception could be The Lion King). The only animated feature to receive a Best Picture Nomination, it has an endless charm.",1118793600,,1262,4.6
592987,5,6303142346,"Nominated for six Academy Awards including Best Picture, Beauty And The Beast is one of Disney's greatest animated achievements. Its massive success reinvigorated the Disney animation juggernaut which had lay dormant for decades, launching the release of smashing blockbusters such as Aladdin, The Lion King, and Finding Nemo. Taking home two Oscars for Best Music (Original Score and Original Song), the film launched a trend in Disney animation by blending musical numbers (with cartoon choreography), an aspect that would become a staple of film after film for the remainder of the decade. In short, Beauty And The Beast is a landmark production just as remarkable today as when it was first released...

Following the Disney tradition of transposing well-known fairy tales from the pages of a book to the sparkle of the big screen, Beauty And The Beast follows the life of Belle (Paige O'Hara), a beautiful bookworm maiden who captivates her town's most eligible bachelor, Gaston (Richard White). Dissatisfied with life in her small French villa, Belle grows especially tired of the conceited and self-absorbed Gaston (who is unable to fathom the idea that Belle does not welcome his affections).

Meanwhile, The Beast lives in solitude in a long-ago abandoned castle, having had a spell cast upon him because of his inability to love. The spell turned the handsome prince into an ugly beast, and it turned all of his servants into dinnerware, candlesticks, and other inanimate objects. When Belle's father, Maurice (Rex Everhart) makes a wrong turn, he inadvertently unites the lives of Belle and The Beast. After spending much time with Belle, the bitter and hardened Beast begins to soften. He and Belle fall in love, but Gaston and his fellow village marauders arrive at the castle walls and demand the return of Belle, threatening to kill The Beast...

The highlight of Beauty And The Beast is the musical number ""Be Our Guest,"" which featured an entire dining hall filled with dancing teacups, plates, and eating utensils. The sequence forged the way for similar scenes in Aladdin (with ""A Whole New World"") and The Lion King (with ""Hakuna Matata""). Directors Gary Trousdale and Kirk Wise not only create a perfect transition from song to story, but they also manage to introduce innumerable humorous lines into musical sequences, especially with the early song bandied about by the rival for Belle's hand, Gaston.

One of the top films of all-time (from any genre, not just animation), Beauty And The Beast remains one of Disney's most heralded creations. It tells the classic love story of the beast with a good heart and does so with vivid characters, a world-class musical score, and animated visual images that would make Walt proud. Critically acclaimed and extremely successful at the box office, Beauty And The Beast is a true blockbuster in the traditional sense of the word. An awe-inspiring film that launched a new generation of animated Disney masterpieces, Beauty And The Beast is the quintessential must-see film...

593083,5,6303142346,"Everyone has that special movie about which it is impossible to be objective. This is that movie for me. I saw it first when my son was seven and he brought it home when a schoolmate loaned it to him. It instantly became a favorite in our house. My son, my daughter, and I have a special bond that this film signifies to this day. From the moment Belle sings, ""I want much more than this provincial life,"" you know you are going to have an experience that goes beyond the ordinary, and you get one that goes beyond your wildest dreams. This film goes into superlatives that leave you breathless.

It is hard to list all the summa cum laudes in this film. Disney broke new ground in this film by using a UNIX workstation for the ballroom scene that enabled a three-dimensional representation of the dance sequence, showing Belle and the Beast dancing through the ballroom under the chandelier. The movie features the voices of Paige O'Hara (Belle), Robby Benson (Beast), Jerry Orbach (Lumire), David Ogden Stiers), Mrs. Potts (Angela Lansbury), Chip (Bradley Pierce), and Wardrobe (Joanne Worley). Alan Menken's musical score is outstanding; the title song won the 1991 Best Song Oscar. The combination of a winning score, superb animation, and an unusually magical depth that the cast manages to create -- the viewer will be too spellbound while watching it to be able to say what it is that captivates so totally -- makes this film one that is not to be missed by young and old alike.

The story is a traditional tale of a prince turned into a beast by a spell cast by an enchantress. The spell can be broken only if, by the end of his 21st birthday, he falls in love with someone who will also love him. An enchanted rose blooms as a symbol of the spell, and the last petal will fall at the end of the spell.

The beauty is a beautiful woman, Belle, in a small French village, who is very intelligent and reads voraciously. She spends much of her time dreaming of living in the worlds she reads about in the books, any place other than the provincial village life she knows. She lives with her father, Maurice, a rather eccentric inventor, and both of them seem to be regarded as odd and unconventional types by the village residents. Gaston, a handsome but arrogant hunter, hopes to marry Belle for no other reason than to be able to say that he has married the most beautiful woman in the village; it is a matter of ego more than feeling, because he admits to no real feeling for anyone other than himself.

Maurice heads out for a fair but goes astray from the path and ends up at a castle. The castle turns out to be enchanted, and the ornaments at the castle turn out to be lifelike beings who welcome him. Cogsworth, the pompous clock, Lumire, the romantic candlelabra, Mrs. Potts, the motherly teapot, and Chip, the boyish teacup, all welcome him. All is well until the master, the surly, growling Beast, enters the room, shouting that Maurice is not welcome and takes him prisoner. At a later time in the film, when Belle comes looking for her father, Belle begs the Beast to let her take her father's place, so she becomes the Beast's prisoner.

The clash of the high-spirited Belle and the ill-tempered Beast is inevitable, for when the Beast loses his temper with Belle and frightens her, she tries to flee him. Wolves try to attack her, and the Beast comes to her rescue. Somehow the incident draws them together, and the resistance slowly causes the two to start to relate to one another. Before long, the two have become very close. The Beast allows Belle to look into his enchanted mirror, and she sees her father is quite ill. When the Beast sees how distressed Belle is, he releases her.

When Belle goes back to her father, she realizes that her feelings for the Beast have changed. As she and Maurice discover, Gaston, in an attempt to intimidate Belle into marrying him, have plotted to put Maurice into an insane asylum. When Gaston discovers that Belle has developed affections for the Beast, he leads the townspeople on a lynch to destroy the Beast.

As the lynch mob approaches the castle, all the objects in the castle prepare for the onslaught. Furniture, kitchen utensils, decorations, virtually every object in the castle, turn on the townspeople, and defeat them in the battle. They rejoice in their victory in the end.

The only persons left in the battle are Gaston and the Beast. The Beast is so depressed because he has lost Belle that he does not resist and lets Gaston assault him. Suddenly Belle appears, and the Beast rises up against Gaston, throwing him from the castle roof. The Beast is in Belle's arms, dying, as Belle tells him that she loves him. Suddenly, in those last moments, the last petal of the rose falls and the spell is broken. The Beast is transformed into a man. The objects again become human, and the movie ends happily.

Somehow at all the right moments in the film, the songs come in to give the story a push forward. Whether it is the opening song that introduces Belle and explains why she can never be content with the life in her little viilage, the song of the conceited Gaston that tells why he can think of nobody in the world except himself, the song that signals the turning point in the relationship between Belle and the Beast, or the title song itself, the music graces the film in the most miraculous way. The film went on to become a Broadway hit as well, and one of the songs from the Broadway play, ""Human Again,"" that was not in the original movie was added in later versions.

Too often when the words ""entertainment for the whole family"" are used, the words mean ""boring and awful."" Many adults also think of animated films as too juvenile to be good. Such prejudices should be cast aside when viewing this film; it is pure pleasure from start to finish.",1108684800,,5835,4.553860819828408

593086,4,6303142346,"If memory serves me right, I first saw this film in a theater back in May 1992. Although it was great I didn't officially get the video until this very DVD issue in 2004. I was ashamed of myself for not getting the original video release right away back in 1992.

The film itself is an unusual one for the average fairy tale. Typically, when one hears a fairy tale like 'Snow White,' 'Cinderella,' 'Sleeping Beauty,' or 'The Little Mermaid,' all of which the Walt Disney Company turned into splendid animated blockbuster hits, he/she can expect a type of 'love-at-first-sight' consequence; they see and like each other immediately. But in this one, the meeting is so much different: Belle, the leading character, doesn't know who she'll be in love with. She just wants 'adventure in the great wide somewhere' and not to be married to Gaston, the so-called 'Don Juan' of her French village whom everyone favors over Belle. But is Belle interested in him? I don't think so! Gaston is wicked on the inside, but he'll stop at nothing to get Belle for his wife.

But when Belle searches for her father, she does escape Gaston's clutches but at the same time becomes the Beast's prisoner. And at first she is afraid of the Beast, who had been a self-centered Prince once before. Eventually they get to know and love each other because the Beast wants to be 'Human Again' and have a kind heart, and Belle, with her outer and inner beauty, is the one who gives this kind of love to him and his servants. And in the end, a spiritual transformation seems to take place much similar to that in 'Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.'

It should be noted that an old peddler woman turned the bratty Prince into a Beast and his servants into objects who haven't been used for ten years because he didn't take the hag's 'inner beauty' seriously. THIS is the most important part of the whole film: 'True beauty comes from within.' That's so true: you don't hear that in a lot of films or even WITNESS it.

You'll love this new version's bonuses. Not only is the song 'Human Again,' which was used in the Broadway production of B&TB, worth noting for its cheerful melody and fabulous PIXAR-type design (it was thrown in as 'an all-new musical sequence'), but there is so much to enjoy that I can't explain it in full.

My only complaint is that the Walt Disney Company seems to have this ridiculous policy of 'release something on video/DVD and then throw it into the vault after three months.' That was where this release went: into the vault. Hard to believe such a wonderful studio could do such a 'limited edition' thing to its beloved hits. They're only released once every few years. To people who'd like to see the films, they either have to search long and hard for or wait to see these films on TV, if ever at all. Later.",1106265600,,2809,4.5325443786982245

The fight between good and evil is not the prevailing story as in most Disney movies, but the beauty within.  It has such a moving, thought provoking theme, that  adults can enjoy it just as much as children.  Great, great movie",1105574400,,397,4.3108108108108105
593088,5,6303142346,"As everyone says, this is a good movie. Why is it so good? It is because our heroine, Belle, is good. Not selfish, not lying, simply good. Each of her actions show selflessness and bravery: when she goes out to rescue her father, and when she takes his place in the castle. And a particular moment that I adore: Belle has run away from the Beast because he has scared her; he rescues her and fights off the wolves, then collapses in the snow. And Belle, seeing what he has done for her, does what is right: she loads him onto her horse and takes him back to the castle, even though her intention was to leave.

The Beast, too, is good in many of his actions as well. He goes after Belle and rescues her, risking his life. He lets her go to save her father, when he is at the point of breaking the spell.

And then there are the shared moments, as the two of them fall slowly in love: the yelling through her bedroom door; her tending him in front of the fireplace after he saved her life; the snowball fight, when Belle begins to realize her feelings and woners what she is doing because he is, after all, a Beast; learning to eat together; dancing; and then, at the end, when he is so grateful that she came back. And then when she thinks she has lost him and puts her hands over her mouth in alarm...

Besides the sterling character of the characters, there are other reasons this movie was nominated for Best Picture. The opening scene at the village is like being brought into an opera, with Belle, the villagers, and Gaston all singing beautifully as they describe what they want out of life. And what book lover does not sympathize with Belle, as she effuses over a story to be greeted with polite indifference?

It takes a classic fairy tale and makes it a whole new story. The musical numbers such as: Beauty and The Beast, Be Our Guest, Belle, & much more will make you feel like your at a Broadway Musical, which in addition it's no wonder it did very well on Broadway itself. The voices are extremely talented and make you take a loving interest in the characters even the villains. Everyone knows this story already; however, everyone needs to see and experience this Disney classic. It's again my favorite among them all.

The DVD is truly amazing of course. My favorites include: Beauty and the Beast music video with an introduction from my favorite singer Celine Dion, all of the games which the kids will enjoy, & the behind the scene's. The most enjoyable was the new addition to the movie Human Again which was put on the cutting room floor in the original theatrical version.

593090,5,6303142346,"Beauty and the Beast is not your typical fairytale love story. Rather, it is a substantially more complex story that deals with issues of prejudice, xenophobia and equality. To some extent this is one of the main reasons for its phenomenal success over the years and why it truly deserves the title ""story as old as time"". It not only manages to appeal to children, effectively teaching them some important life morals, but it also manages to touch a deeper level with adults, highlighting issues that as a society we would prefer to pretend do not exist. The main characters portrayed here of Belle (Paige O'Hara), the Beast (Robby Benson) and Gaston (Richard White) are quite complex when compared to the fairytale characters one typically encounters; and in many respects they are even the polar opposites. Belle for instance, is immediately distinguished from the other villagers as being ""quite odd"" due to her interest in reading and adventure. Likewise as the story unfolds, Gaston progressively shifts from being the epitome of man to becoming the monster as the Beast slowly becomes more human.

This presentation is also perfectly suitable for children and several amusing characters are available to provide comic relief throughout the feature. These include such wonderful characters as Lumiere (Jerry Orbach) the French candlestick, Cogsworth (David Ogden Stiers) the pompous clock, Mrs. Potts (Angela Lansbury) the very personable teapot and Chip (Bradley Pierce) the little boy as a teacup. In addition there are several others including Belle's father Maurice (Rex Everhart), her horse Philippe (Hal Smith) and the ever-lovable ottoman dog (Frank Welker). These are wonderful characters that never overly distract from the main story, as so many useless animated characters have a tendency to do in other animated features.

In closing, this adaptation of the ageless story of Beauty and the Beast is a magnificent effort, by a magnificent team, and it definitely deserves the fine reputation it has as one of the best animated films of all time. The presentation on DVD is also amongst the very best available and is certainly worth adding to any collection!",1103155200,,2175,5.193732193732194

593155,5,6303142346,"Beauty and the Beast is THE best disney. Well it's surely in the top 3. The only way to make this film better is to re-release it and jam pack it with amazing features. I think that Diseny has done a great job with this.

The story centers around Belle, the 'crazy inventors' daughter and an outcast in in small french town. She then meets the beast who was transformed beause of his shallowness, and needs to fall in love and win love in return in order to become human again. Unlike any other classic Disney film, this is not love at first sight, and after techincally kidnapping Belle the two become friends. The rest of the story ends with them falling in love despite Gaston's attempts to keep them apart and win Belle as his 'trophy wife'. One of the things I like about this film is that its the most magical film, the spells and enchanted castle help childen to love this film even more. Its a musical at its finest and has many Oscar and Golden Globe nominated songs.

The dvd is of course way better quality than the Vhs, but is way more than just different quality. It is restored so that it can be seen in it's original quality, the way it shoud be. The songs are better, so is the colour and the overall proudct. It also features a new sequence, fully restored and animated. I really liked 'Human again' and am really glad that it's on the Dvd. The other special features are various triva, games and making's of, but the real novelty is to have it on the 2-disc special edition. Having only brought a Dvd player 4 months ago, this was the first I brought, and it is now out of print as Disney only keeps the special editions circulating for about 3-4 months. The others (for refrence) are; Snow White, Sleeping Beauty, Aladdin, The Lion King and very shortly Pocahontas and Mulan.

If you like disney and fairytales, then this is your sort of thing. This would appeal to anyone as this film has so many levels. Its a must see no matter who you are.",1100736000,,1962,4.355191256830601

593157,5,6303142346,"We all know the tale of Belle (the Beauty) and her beastly prince. Boys and girls alike grew up begging to hear the story at bed time, over and over and over...

Of all the fairy tales out there ""Beauty & the Beast"" is the favorite of most kids, especially the girls. I am no exception. I was already in my twenties when I found out that the Disney Studio was creating this, my favorite tale, in animated magic as only Disney can do! It was torture to wait for the movie to hit the theater. I took my little boy to see it on opening weekend. I was as enthralled with the magic as he was.

Today, I still feel this way about the movie. Of course I purchased the VHS on the day it was released to the public. However, getting this tale in DVD was a ""no brainer"". DVD lasts so much longer than VHS and is not quite so fragile or wear out so quickly. On birthdays and special occassions, this would be a wonderful gift!

And let us not forget that unlike the VHS, this DVD set has so many extras! The movie may be 90 mins to two hours long, but the extras are even longer! You get behind the scene glances and see the wonder of how it was created. I had no idea that there was so much involved! Animation gets no better than this.

593158,5,6303142346,"Walt Disney's classic tale is finally on DVD!! It features, of course, the original edition of the movie, PLUS the Special Edition (featuring an original, never before seen musical sequence) and the Work In Progress Edition, a Disney first. The best parts of the film are:when the Enchanted Objects sing ""Be Our Guest"" (one of three Oscar-nominated songs, the other two being ""Belle"" and of course, ""Beauty And The Beast"" [which won Best Song, beating out the other two, but ALL the songs in this movie are excellent]) and when Belle and The Beast are dancing in the ballroom as Mrs. Potts (voiced by a spectacular and talented Angela Lansbury) sings the title song. The bonus features on Disc 2 are equally enchanting as the movie itself.

Paige O'Hara is WONDERFUL as the voice of Belle, Robby Benson is equally good as the voice of The Beast, arrogant and loving as the film progresses, Angela Lansbury is PERFECT as the voice of Mrs. Potts, Jerry Orbach is hilarious as the voice of Lumiere, the French candelabra, David Odgen Stiers (voice of the villainous Ratcliff in ""Pocahontas"" and ""Pocahontas II: Journey To A New World, opposite Irene Berard, reprising her role from the first movie and Billy Zane as John Rolfe) is just as comical in his fights with Lumiere.

593159,5,6303142346,"Disney's musical, animated version of the old fairy tale is truly a thing of beauty. As the story opens, a handsome but proud prince shuns an old woman, thus starting the magic spell that turns him into a hideous Beast.  In the nearby village, the heroine, Belle, is considered quite odd because she likes to read books. She is pursued by Gaston, the town bully, but she'll have nothing to do with the lout. When Belle's eccentric father becomes a prisoner in the Beast's castle, she agrees to take his place. Gradually, she and the Beast fall in love, and as the magic spell that held him is broken, he becomes the handsome prince again, changed by the power of love.

The outstanding soundtrack is full of clever, romantic, and fun-to-sing tunes that stay with you. Angela Landsbury plays Mrs. Potts, the enchanted tea pot, bringing warmth and class to the film. This is the stuff little girls' dreams are made of.",1096070400,,916,4.648148148148148

593161,5,6303142346,"This is definitely one of Disney's great feature films.  You all know the story, I'm sure, so I won't bore you with the details.  It's amazing how human the characters really seemed.  They were all wonderfully drawn by the animators and voiced by the actors; I think my favorite scene has to be during the song ""There's Something There,"" when Belle and the Beast begin to realize they have feelings for each other.  Just watch the body language and looks on their faces; you really feel what they're feeling -- and these are cartoons!!!

Right from the opening scene we know we're in for something special, when the camera pans down from a crowded street scene onto Belle.  Things only get better from there, as there's nary a dull spot to be found in the story.  The musical numbers are some of the best from a Disney feature, especially ""Belle,"" ""Gaston,"" ""Be Our Guest,"" ""There's Something There,"" -- oh, who am I kidding?  They're all fantastic.

As for the special features, brace yourself, there's a ton of them.  The main disc houses not one, not two, but three different versions of the film!  We have the theatrical version, a special edition version which adds a new song from the Broadway show, ""Human Again,"" and finally a work-in-progress version, which was shown at the New York Film Festival in September 1991, three months before its final release.  There's an audio commentary by the directors, a sing-along track, and part one of a two-part game (the second part is on disc two).

Disc two is divided into four areas: The first area is called The Secret West Wing, and it houses the second part of said game.  The second area is called Chip's Fun And Games, and is aimed at the little kiddies in the audience.  There's a little featurette on Disney animation, a create-your-own-song game, and a video for a horrendous pop version of ""Beauty And The Beast"" by some group called Jump 5.

The third area is called Cogsworth & Lumiere's library, which is basically an hour-long making of special which details the origins, development, story, music, characters, production design, animation, visual effects, marketing, and awards of the film, and finally talks about the Broadway musical.  The final area is called Mrs Potts' Engaging Treats, and is for the average film watcher.  It has a half-hour making of special which is just a truncated version of the one in C&L's library.  There's also a little feature called ""Story Behind The Story,"" which talks about the differences between the original stories and film versions of seven Disney films.  We end off with a cool personality profile game, in which you find out which BEAUTY AND THE BEAST character you're most like (apparently I'm most like Belle), and finally, the Celine Dion-Peabo Bryson version of the title song (which isn't nearly as good as Angela Lansbury's version in the movie).  All in all, a near perfect DVD.

The film:  5 stars.

The extras:  5 stars.",1091836800,,2939,4.795228628230617
593162,5,6303142346,"It is quite rare for any animated film to be treated with the same respect as any other honored non-animated one.  In BEAUTY AND THE BEAST, directors Kirk Wise and Gary Trousdale take the time-worn fairy tale of the outwardly loathsome beast who impossibly enough allows his inner nobility to shine forth sufficiently to cause the beauty to fall in love with him.  Robby Benson is the voice of the Beast and Paige O'Hara is Beauty.  Even for those readers familiar with the spoken tale or the revamped music video with Meatloaf as the Beast cannot help but allow themselves to be entranced with the seamless melding of sight to sound.  The plot is simplicity itself with the Beast as the archetypal symbol of the rebirth of nobility long hidden by the evil spell of an unnamed wizard.  There is nothing childish in the unfolding of the tale of Belle the Beauty who chooses to sacrifice herself in marriage to save the life of her doddering inventor father. Enter the Beast who is initially presented as the roaring brute that his tormenting wizard clearly intended him to be.  Yet, as Belle ministers to his psychic wounds of self-loathing and his physical wounds incurred in defending her against a pack of wolves, the viewer can see a competing spell at work, one that is older than time itself--the power of love that the film's many songs allude to and function as as subtext that imbues it with timeless energy.  There is, of course, some needed plot complications of unwanted attention heaped on Belle by the handsome but warped Gaston, who plots to snare Belle in marriage as firmly as he would stalk a reindeer for its antlers.  As Gaston leads the villagers in an assault on the Beast's manor, one is reminded in reverse of the cliched villagers pounding at the walls of Doctor Frankenstein's castle, but in this case the attack in presented in comic tones that keep the real world of harm at bay.
BEAUTY AND THE BEAST has no down moments, with each fresh plot advancement heralded by stunningly effective animation and song.  This film was a deserved nominee for Best Picture in 1991, and with repeated viewings, one may rest assured that the alternately gloomy and resplendent halls of the Beast will eternally resonate with the same cachet that gives Tara, Oz, or Rick's Cafe a ticket that allows the bearer to see just how awesome the human spirit can be.",1087430400,,2368,4.700483091787439

As was always the case, the music is beautiful, the story is sound, the writing is clever, and the animation is simply astounding.
This Platinum Edition features a new song that was not in the original theatrical release, a funny little number called ""Human Again.""  I was fairy trepidatious going into this film, worrying that the added scene was going to kind of ruin it for me, but lo and behold, Disney pulled it off beautifully!  That is something I did not expect.  The transition was seamless, you would never have guessed, if you didn't already know, that this scene was not in the original.
And, for those who are total purists and don't care to see the added song, they also give you the option of watching the original without anything extra.
They ALSO put in an option to watch the ""Work-In-Progress"" -- which shows the movie in its entirety, moving back and forth from sketches to midway to finished product.  It's quite interesting to see the transitions!
And of course, on top of all that, they have the making-of, and the special documentay features, which are worth watching if you, like myself, are fascinated by the makings of movies of any kind.  I never cease to be amazed at how a traditional cartoon is put together, it's phenomenal!

While the animation is almost as good as ever (though the faces are a little too sharp), I think Disney just tried to make a ""film"" here. At the end of it, while I could applaud the slick animation and technology, I could not realize any sort of that ""bubbling happiness"" that I expect from Disney. The music is good (though nowhere near Snowwhite and Sleeping beauty). What I miss most is the lack of sufficient *characters*. For example, in Snowwhite, every animal was given a part - the tortoise, the squirrels, the rats, the birds, the deers, the fly etc. Here, the focus is only on the lead characters.

593298,5,6303142346,"When I look at the Disney corporation the last 15 years I have to sit and think. Would Walt Disney be happy with what has been done with what he started. Sometimes I think he'd cry in shame except for when I see a movie like Beauty and the Beast and say to myself no, Walt would have loved this.
Disney has always been the standard for animated movies. Beauty and the Beast is the only to ever get a nomination for ""Best Picture"" by the academy awards and Disney has called it one of top three best they've ever done. Those are some pretty good credentials.
Beauty and the Beast tells the story of the beauty bookworm Belle. She has moved to a new town in France and doesn't fit it to well. Her father is a crack pot inventor is looked to be a madman from the local town folk. On a way to the fair to show off his newest invention Marious gets lost and ends up at a castle. It is at that castle he is imprisoned by a Beast. Belle who has complete compassionate love for her father finds him and takes his place. It's there that she teaches the Beast to love. Back in town though one of the towns men is angry. The conceited and wicked hearted Gaston wants Belle for himself and no one else, and he'll stop at nothing to get her.
There are so many reasons this movie is great. It has some of the most loveable characters ever. Belle and the Beast are both fantastic. In the castle all the workers were imprisoned into different animate objects. There's Cogsworth the Clock and Lemuix the Candlestick. There is Mrs. Potts the Teapot and many other loveable characters that leave you feeling good inside.
The music is fantastic. It did win the best score and best song Oscars. ""Beauty and the Beast"" is an awesome song sung by award winning artists Celine Dion and Peabo Bryson. Other notable songs are ""Gaston,"" ""Be Our Guest,"" and Many Many more. I'd watch the movie just to see the music.
Beauty and the Beast is one of the best movies you will ever see. It's easily up there with the Wizard of Oz as the best family movie ever made. If you don't have this DVD you can't seriously have a DVD collection. It's one of the best of all time and will be forever. So be there guest and sit down for a ride you'll never regret.",1067817600,,2220,4.238207547169812
593299,5,6303142346,"The legendary story of the Beauty and the Beast never looked better than on this lovely Disney animated feature. In a time (1991, after the Little Mermaid) when the classic Disney appeal had long passed (Cinderella, Sleeping Beauty, etc.), the entertainment powerhouse for all ages came back with a film that resurrected the fairy tale story concept, giving it a much deserved technical make-up with animation that was up to the best of its time, in fact setting new standards for the genre. As an example, take the scene where Beauty and the Beast are in a dance hall and the virtual camera does a pan from the top of the room to the height of the characters: it has more depth (physical depth, I mean) than most if not all animated features I've seen.
As for music, it's tough to run into a contemporary animated flic with so many musical pieces so perfectly integrated into the story, and actually aiding it in a way that leaves you humming the songs for days at a time, after seeing the movie. The least that can be said about the role of music in the story is that the title song that won it an Oscar in 1991 is just a bit of what the music does for the movie: it moves you, makes you smile, and takes you in a thousand different directions.
As for a story and their characters, this movie has them all:
-The classic ""villain"" concept was beginning to evolve into more of a character getting in the way, but almost in a funny way, such as the case of Gaston in this movie. This concept would later become the norm in most Disney movies with soft ""villains"" that are not such, and at times with no villains at all.
-Hilarious big and small characters in disguise of teapots, chandeliers (Lumiere is my personal favorite, hands down!) and all sorts of furniture pieces.
-A Beast that can scare you with his initial anger or win your heart with the tenderness it exudes as his character evolves in the movie.
-Finally, a Beauty (Belle) that can be paired with some of the most beautiful animated characters, portraying a woman ahead of her time, wanting to read and travel in a stagnant peasant environment that would not relate to her 'crazy' dreams of exploration, much less coming from a woman whose place -in their minds- was ""back at home,"" raising kids, caring after her husband, etc.
All in all Beauty and the Beast is a storytelling, musical and animation accomplishment of sorts. It totally deserves all the praise.",1066608000,,2426,4.541095890410959
593300,5,6303142346,"The first time I watched this, it scared me...the beast scared me. And so I really didn't feel like watching the rest. However...
The second time I watched it...it still scared me, but it was a much more pleasing movie. I paid the story more attention and realized a lot of misconceptions I previously had about this movie (e.g. - Maurice got the beast in trouble, Gaston was badly done, prince is ugly, etc.). There was much chemistry between Belle and the Beast. There were very entertaining scenes where the Beast tries to please Belle by acting like a gentleman...you can almost feel the changes in him after Belle nurses his wounds after he saves her from the wolves.
I can't rave about it more. It would have been the perfect tale if they hadn't made the Gaston sequences so long, as I really disliked him (this might be the pt. since we are supposed to hate the villains) and I really wish they would make a sequel to it instead of doing short pieces that belong in the middle.
And the songs...what can I say?? They're skillfully made and put-together. Paige O'Hara's voice is a delight. All the songs were entertaining, the tunes were catchy. And it all melded into the story perfectly.

When her father heads out to a fair, he gets lots, and Belle finds him in an enchanted castle.  The objects are thrilled, because if she and their master, the Beast, fall in love, they will all be freed from the enchantment.  But will Belle be able to see past the outward appearance?  And what about the handsome bore back home who wants to marry Belle?

I feel in love with this movie the first time I saw it, and that love has only grown over the years.  The story is the right mix of fun and uncertainty.  Gaston was a wonderful addition to the mix because his story was the part I was most uncertain about the first time around.  The artwork on the film catches your eye from the first shot of the castle, and doesn't let go.  Beside the incredible background shots are wonderful drawings of the characters.  I especially love the boyish excitement they manage to give the Beast in several scenes.  Finally, there's the music.  Every song adds to the story and is memorable in its own right.

This DVD is perfect for any fan of this movie.  Disc 1 includes three versions of the film.  The first is the ""in progress"" version shown to the New York film festival 6 weeks before the premier of the movie in 1991.  While it's fun to have, I won't be watching it regularly.  The second version is the original release.  And finally comes the special edition, with the added scene and ""Human Again.""  Ironically, this is probably my least favorite of the songs added to the Broadway version, but it does advance the story.  And, there's always the option of watching the original version.  Obviously, the version that you are supposed to watch is the special edition, as the audio commentary and sing along bonus features only work with this option.  All three come in Dolby 5.1 sound, which sounds great.

The second disc features hours of bonus material.  Most of it focuses on the making of this movie.  Everything is covered, from original idea through characters and the Broadway version and special edition.  Galleries show character designs over the course of the project.  Also featured is the original treatments for ""Human Again"" and ""Be Our Guest.""  Celebrity voices give background on the original story and Disney versions of classic tales.  And there's a fun documentary as the stars of ""Even Stevens"" take a backstage look at all the work that goes into making a feature animated film.

This is the first annimated film to be nominated for an Oscar for Best Picture.  Watching the film, the reason is clear.  This is something the entire family can enjoy.  Don't miss your opportunity to catch this classic film.",1062633600,,2746,4.605371900826446

The problem with this scene begins with the fact that it is not needed, add to that the color in the animation is different from that of the rest of the film and it just seems so completely out of place. To me the added scene seems uncomfortable. The bottom line is that it is a great movie, but the added scene brings it from a 5 to a 3 star rating!!!",1058659200,,587,4.068965517241379

What I like about the DVD was that it lets me experience the movie three ways. The first is the Special Edition which, if you're like me and never saw the original, makes you wonder whats so special about it. Enter the second option, the original movie! The last option, the replay of the Special Edition with narration throughout by the actual animators, was the most satisfying to me. These are two very engaging guys whose play-by-play of the production processes and the decisions they had to make allowed me to see the movie with a new appreciation of the work involved without runing the films magic. I thoroughly enjoyed this presentation, although I wished that they could have captioned the narration.
By the way, the closed captioning, as done by my TV set, was reasonably well done with few mistakes. Tip: if you have CC turned on, turn OFF the subtitles on your DVD player, else you get captions on top of captions. Messy.
As far as the movie itself, well. The story is everything, and its a wonderful story. The animation, keeping in mind that this was originally done before the age of Pixar, I found the backdrops absolutely stunning, especially the ballroom scenes. The colors were bright and vibrant even when seen on my 20 JVC TV. Of course, there isn't the nearly three-dimensional quality of, say, a Snow White, but at least the characters didn't appear to have the stilted Clutch Cargo movements typically seen in animation produced in Korea. I could tell the animators knew a little something about human anatomy.
There are really good special effects scenes. Realistic rain scenes and lightning. Being a lover of stage production, the songs were tailor-made for Broadway and I understand  that it became one after the 1991 release.
Paige OHara has a wonderful voice, and Im going to seek out more of her recordings. She makes you forget that Belle is an animated character. Robbie Bensons Beast is so convincing, I wish they could have used him to be the adult Simba in The Lion King rather than Matthew Broderick. David Ogden Stiers, from M*A*S*H*, is Cogsworth the clock and also narrates the beginning and end stained glass pieces. JoAnn Worley from the old Laugh-In show was the armoire cabinet. I was impressed by the use of top-drawer, albeit relatively unknown talent.
In all, I found Beauty and the Beast a very well done movie. I wouldnt mind buying it. The Special Editions new scenes helped the story make more sense. The only thing I didn't enjoy was the hit song at the end of the movie, but I had that same reaction to the end of The Lion King as well.",1058054400,,2807,4.670707070707071

She ends up at this castle in the middle of the forest where she meets a prince who is actually this monstrous beast who had been transformed into this creature by a fairy princess long ago for being heartless.  Belle bargains herself for her father's release, and the story between Belle and the Beast begins to unfold.
Other characters in the movie include Chip and his mother Mrs. Potts (voiced by Angela Lansbury), Lumiere (voiced by Jerry Orbach...from Law and Order!), Cogsworth, and Gaston.  Typical to the Disney movie, it pits the good versus the bad in a somewhat more lighthearted way with great songs that everyone sings along with.
This new edition of the DVD I honestly don't think is much better than the original.  They have lots of added goodies yes, but the famous new scene added into the movie with the new song ""To Be Human Again"" while a cute song, just doesn't seem to fit in with the rest of the movie after you've become accustomed to the original.

The new musical number included in the special edition is a fun one, and to see simple artwork throughout the unfinished version is a fun watch. The tons of supplemental material is too much to actually review. But it shows that Disney cares.
 The film was the first animated picture to be nominated for Best Picture, and rightfully so.

Not by a long shot.
Part of the reason I was displeased with the DVD is how junked up it is with ""Special Features"".  Regular readers of my reviews (Thank you, Ladies!) will note that I am opposed to the inclusion of such supplementary material.  If the movie can't stand on it's own, then what good is it?

The songs in this movie will never be regarded as standards the way many older Disney film songs have.

And who would have thought that Robby Benson would deliver so effective a performance as the voice of the Beast?  His castle full of animated furnishings (I wish they'd given more space to his valet, a hatrack, and the master cook, a stove) is splendidly imagined and animated, and, as always, there are animals--Belle's father's big draft horse and a pack of sinister wolves.  The one disappointment this movie has for me is its ""villain""--Gaston may be arrogant, loutish, chauvinistic, and even cruel, but he doesn't seem evil enough to deserve the fate that befalls him.  Still, the movie has immense charm and definitely deserves the accolades heaped upon it when it was first released.

This Disney Platinum DVD is a 2 Disc set.
Disc 1 features 3 versions of ""Beauty & The Beast"", and it is all done via a High-Definition Transfer using Digital Technology. The first version is what the DVD packaging is promoting and that is the Special Edition version. This features some minor animation changes which you probably won't notice and an additional musical sequence called ""Human Again"". This song was used in the Broadway version of ""Beauty & The Beast"" and proved very popular. And so composer Alan Menken re-worked the song for the Special Edition, and the Disney animators brought it to life in animation. It is all done seamlessly to blend in with the original version as if it was meant to be there in the first place. The second version on this DVD is the Original Theatrical Edition. The third version is the Work In Progress Edition and for true afficianados this is a real find, and here is why- When Beauty & The Beast was first shown to an audience it wasn't quite finished. Some of the animation was incomplete and so parts were in pencil test form. However, despite that being the case, audiences were still moved by ""Beauty & The Beast"". Now with this version you can see many of the rare pencil tests that made up the movie.
Disc 1 also has an Audio Commentary from the filmmakers and a sing along track. In other words, you can watch the whole film, and when the songs are performed the lyrics appear on screen. Also on this Disc 1 is the first part of a game called
Maurice's Invention Workshop Game whcih continues on Disc 2.
And so onto Disc 2. Here we have a preety pointless Disney's Enchanted Environments. Here you can watch moving pictures of things like a fireplace. Great huh? Anyhoo there is also a Character Profile Game, Chip's Musical Challenge Game, the continuance of the game from Disc 1, ""Beauty And The Beast"" Music Video By Jump 5 and theatrical trailers.
There are also various documentaries which you can visit at different locations on the DVD. The problem here is that you will realize that certain apparently different directions will lead to the same place. In other words you could go one way and find various short documentaries, whereas if you went another way you might find those same small documentaries, just edited together as one big documentary. It's a bit of a cheat really, and greatly affects my opinion of this DVD. Anyway, the headed small documentaries include The Story Behind The Story; The Broadway Musical; Disney's Animation Magic; The Story-Bringing The Story To The Screen; Early Presentation Reel; The Music-Alternate Score: The Transformation, Alternate Version: ""Be Our Guest,"" Deleted Song: ""Human Again,"" Beauty And The Beast Music Video, Original Demo Recordings With Introduction By Alan Menken.
There are also lots of animation galleries, animation tests and much more.
Disney have managed to fit a lot onto this DVD set, but the big disppoinment is thinking there were more documentaries than there were. Still, the movie is simply the best animated feature, and worth a proud place among your DVD collection. Oh and also, take a look at the thin side of the DVD packaging and you find the letter I. This is because this is the beginning of a 3 part collection. II is ""Beauty & The Beast: The Enchanted Christmas"", and III is ""Beauty & The Beast: Belle's Magical World"".",1048636800,,3584,4.736

593598,4,6303142346,"BEAUTY AND THE BEAST

(USA - 1991)

Aspect ratio: 1.85:1
Theatrical soundtrack: 6-track Dolby Stereo

To save her father from a fate worse than death, an unfulfilled country girl (voiced by Broadway star Paige O'Hara) agrees to be imprisoned inside an enchanted castle where the furniture is made up of living, breathing characters and the master of the house (Robby Benson) has been condemned by a witch to live in the form of a monstrous Beast. Only love can lift the curse...

Sheer cinematic joy! Produced in the wake of Disney's smash-hit THE LITTLE MERMAID (1989) and helmed by debut animation directors Gary Trousdale and Kirk Wise, BEAUTY AND THE BEAST combines animated spectacle with vivid characterizations and exuberant musical numbers in a confection which ranks alongside the very finest classics of Disney's 'golden age'.

Returning to the European folk tales which had inspired many of their earlier animated features (SNOW WHITE AND THE SEVEN DWARFS, PINOCCHIO, etc.), scenarist Linda Woolverton leavens the essential romantic core of the film with exciting set-pieces and well-judged comic relief, and there are several stand-out sequences, designed and executed with breathtaking flair: A terrifying battle between the Beast and a pack of wolves, the spectacular and life-affirming 'Be Our Guest' number (voiced with remarkable dexterity by Jerry Orbach and Angela Lansbury), and the climactic assault on the castle, all of which are guaranteed to impress audiences young and old. Sadly, the film is dedicated to the memory of co-songwriter Howard Ashman, who passed away shortly before the movie opened in 1991.

PS. A musical number cut from the narrative was restored for a subsequent IMAX version, and the entire film will be reworked in 3-D for its 2010 re-release.

PSS. The movie was subsequently adapted - to great acclaim - for the Broadway stage, only to be sullied by an unnecessary TV series and a number of video-only sequels. Stick with the original.",1048204800,,1983,5.197492163009405
593599,4,6303142346,"In 1991 Disney's ""Beauty & The Beast"" became the only film in the history of the Academy Awards to be nominated in the Best Picture catagory.  And although it didn't win (Silence of the Lambs did), the ripple effect that this landmark had on the Disney legacy was felt for nearly a decade afterward.  The story is based on the classic fairytale but given the ""Disney touch"" with talking furniture and magical moments that really owe more to a Broadway show than the Brothers Grimm.
Alan Menken and Howard Ashman were the creative team that penned the Oscar winning score.  But when the film originally premiered one of their best songs ""Human Again"" was left on the cutting room floor, an artistic liberty that has been rectified with this DVD release.
You get not one, not two, but three distinct versions of this film on DVD.  All are presented in anamorphic widescreen.  The special edition includes the restoration of the Ashman/Menken song previously mentioned as well as an all new, newly enhanced IMAX hi-def print that really makes the film sparkle beyond anything seen in theaters.  The original theatrical cut is also included as well as ""Beauty & The Beast: Work In Progress"" a wonderful version of the film, shown at a New York critic's preview that includes pencil tests of the film's art work, released before a final version of the finished film was completed.  Disc two of this enchanted Platinum Edition is chocked full of extra features that are too many to be believed.  Some seem rather silly - the dance mix of Beauty & The Beast music video falls into this catagory.
About the transfer: The opening scene with its stained glass windows is heavy on edge enhancement and pixelization.  However, once these few moments are over, so are both of these distractions.  Overall, the visual quality of either the theatrical cut or special edition is outstanding.  The 5.1 mix is beautifully presented.  On disc two, the menus and some of the documentary footage also suffer from aliasing and shimmering details but nothing that one can't overlook for the sake of getting through the rough spots.

593600,5,6303142346,"On DVD, the Platinum Special Edition of Disney's ""Beauty and the Beast"" is a refreshing and aesthetic experience. The DVD comes loaded with special features- theatrical trailers, three versions of the film, soundtrack, Broadway musical and interactive games. Beauty and the Beast was released in 1991. It was Disney's most enduring classic, and one of the first to use computer generated effects which would pave the way for later films. The romantic, quasi Gothic tale revolves around a haughty prince, transformed into a hideous Beast, who must love a woman and earn her love in return. ""But who could ever learn to love a beast ?."" That would be Belle, the book-smart, beautiful, courageous and vibrant young heroine and one of the few Disney heroines who is not vain, vapid and helpless. Belle's father becomes imprisoned in the Beast's dungeon and Belle offers to take his place. During her stay in the Beast's castle, she becomes acquianted with the enchanted host of objects and furniture- Lumiere, the candelabra who speaks  French like Maurice Chevalier, Cogsworth the uptight British clock, Mrs. Potts (Angela Lansbury) as the warm, motherly teapot an Chip the rambunctious tea cup. Belle saves the Beast with her love- and he is transformed into a handsome, human prince.
The villain in the film is Gaston, a ruggedly handsome, but self-centered and vainglorious hunter. Gaston is determined to make Belle his trophy wife, but his machinations (including locking up her inventor father, Maurice, in an insane asylum). The special effects are computer enhanced- particularily striking is the ballroom scene. Beauty and the Beast is full of memorable and catchy songs by Alan Menken and Tim Rice- ""Beauty and the Beast"", ""Be Our Guest"" ""Belle"", ""Gaston"" ""Something There"" ""Kill the Beast"" and the never before heard song ""Human again"". There is no wonder why the movie was made into a popular and successful Broadway musical.",1046995200,,1934,5.13968253968254

593602,5,6303142346,"Of all of the Disney films created in the past quarter century, Beauty and the Beast would have to be my favorite. The story revolves around the romance between Belle, a beautiful bookworm who was thought of as odd in her provincial French village, and a self-centered Prince-turned-Beast who could only be lifted from his spell by learning to love another and earn her love in return. Along the way, there are dozens of wonderful characters including the Beast's lovable servants-turned household objects and Belle's brutish suitor Gaston who will do anything to make her his wife. The film's score and music and both beautiful and deserving of the Academy Awards they won. The film is truly a classic, so it's surprising that it can be improved for this Special Edition DVD. Three versions of the film including the fascinating Work in Progress edition and 10th anniversary edition with a wonderful new sequence added into the film. Along with the film, the DVD also includes behind the scenes documentaries, galleries of art used in the film, alternate versions of ""Be Our Guest"" and the Transformation scenes, a couple of wonderful music videos including a new version of the title song by pop group Jump5, and a number of games among other extras. This DVD is truly a must-own for Disney fans and a wonderful addition to any DVD collection.",1045699200,,1345,4.877729257641922
593603,5,6303142346,"Once in a while, a movie comes along that captures everything moviemaking is about: enthralling stories, beautiful characters and a aura about it that makes throughly unforgettable.  ""Beauty and the Beast"" is one of those movies.  Based on the European folktale, the movie revolves around Belle, a beautiful but with a suttle eccentricity to her society of the day.  A village where the same thing happens everyday.  But when her father, a struggling inventor, goes missing on a trip to an invention festival, she goes looking for him, and finds him being held prisoner in an ominous castle.  No humans inhabit the dark abode, but those that were once human.  Objects like candlesticks and clocks are living, inhabited by the men and women that once lived in the castle.  Long before Belle found their home, a wandering witch disguised as an old beggar women  asked the master of the castle for shelter from the bitter winter, but he turned her away.  The witch then turned the master into a terrifying beast, and every man, woman and child into everyday objects, until the Master learns to soften his heart and learn to love, and have that person he proclaims love to love him in return.  If the Beast finds that person, the spell on the castle would be lifted.  If not, all those in the caslte are doomed to and eternity as objects and the master is forever a Beast.  Everyone in the castle hopes that Belle is the one to lift the spell.
The movie not only delivers the best in the fundamentals of movies, but features stunning animation by being one of the first animated movies to utilize computers with traditional animation.  The ballroom scenes are utterly breathtaking, as is the balconies and buttresses of castles exterior.  And the vocal performances are flawless.  Paige O'Hara is as subtle as her Belle, and Jerry Orbach is surprisingly witty as the fast-talking candlestick Lumiere.  And for Disney villians, the obsessive Gaston is one of the more human, and more compelling.  Not to mention the songs are a delight.  You can't stop singing ""Be our Guest"" can you?  Go ahead, sing the first verse while you watch one of the best movies (not just animated) ever",1045353600,,2175,4.767379679144385

593677,5,6303142346,"I would've been about 5 when I first saw this movie and was unable to make up my mind about it until, nearly 10 years later, I was given the chance to see it again, so I took that chance.
What I saw was a beautiful, artistic and flawless animated film with well-written and surprisingly complex and different characters (which is something I normally don't see in Disney).
THE MAIN CHARACTERS:
BELLE:
Belle has definately become my favourite female Disney character as she differs so much from the typical Disney heroine. She is intelligent, slightly eccentric, and instead of sitting around, dreaming about her dream guy, she chooses to look at what is below the surface and to bring happiness into the lives of others with no selfish motives.
THE BEAST:
Definately the most complex character of them all, the Beast's persona is many differing shades of grey, and his conflicted feelings and emotions are portryed perfectly through his body language and beautifully expressive eyes that you could just fall into. And through Belle's gentle but unwavering kindness, he learns not only to love again, but also that your heart and personality will always outshine your physical appearance.
GASTON:
The most handsome and arrogant man in Belle's village, Gaston soon proves that he is also a complex character. While he starts off as a rather stupid-yet-amusing muscle-head who cannot take 'no' for an answer, his character soon begins to reveal that while he is stupid, he makes up for it by being cunning,
manipulative and posessive. Soon, he becomes the 'ultimate evil' in the story when he realizes that Belle has fallen in love with the Beast and will never want to be with him...Basically, it becomes a case of Gaston being read to destroy anything and anybody that gets in the way of what he wants...
The other characters, such as Mrs. Potts, Lumiere, Cogworth and Belle's eccentric-but-caring Father, Maurice, are also surprisingly well-developed, considering they are not main characters. Not only do they add spots of comic relief to prevent the movie from being too dark, they are all also VITAL to the story as they help lead it along. Without them, the story would be much emptier and alot shorter.
And finally, we come to the music. I normally hate when the characters break into song in the middle of a movie, but the songs all fit into the movie perfectly without giving it a ""dragged-out"" feel. They, like the minor characters, keep the movie going and help inject even more feeling into what is already a masterpiece.
Overall, this was, and will always be THE best Disney film ever created, and, just like the tagline, the most beautiful love story ever told. I would recommend this to absolutely ANYBODY!!!",1043193600,,2721,4.879049676025918
593678,5,6303142346,"Easily one of Disney's new classics and one of the most fun as well. BEAUTY AND THE BEAST has been brought back in a new 2 Disc set that has the original movie with the new song ""Human Again"" and also a lot of fun extras.
This is one of my all time favorite Disney movies and this is a great one for the kids and the whole family. The storty starts with a young Prince who was very selfish. One night a poor old woman came to his castle and asked for shelter from the rain and she offered him a single rose in return. The Prince turned her away and the old woman's appearance melted away to reveal a beautiful enchantress. To show him that he had to learn how to love inner beauty, she turned into a hideous Beast. Now he must learn to love and have someone love him in teturn or he would remain a Beast for the rest of his life.
This is really a favorite of mine because it's seriously very good all around. The music and musical numbers are very fun and entertaining and the new song ""Human Again"" is also very fun as well. The story is very good and the characters are fun as well. I don't think anyone could not enjoy this movie.
This gets a big thumbs up, 5 stars of fun! Check out BEAUTY AND THE BEST PLATINUM and if you're looking for other great Disney classics, check out DUMBO, SLEEPING BEAUTY, SNOW WHITE and even some of the new Disney/Pixar movies like MONSTERS INC, TOY STORY and TOY STORY 2 and A BUG'S LIFE.",1043193600,,1423,4.122302158273381
593679,5,6303142346,"This is one of the hallmark videos in Disney history.  It takes the motif of the damsel in distress and gives it a twist.  As is typical, she is far away from home, in a dark castle & imprisoned by a monster.
However, the tale does not find its nucleus in her imprisonment, but in her being set free.  The monster sets about to coerce her to love him naturally for what he is, rather than forcing her to find favour with him.  This is perhaps one of the most poignant of all Disney's fairy-tale messages, both for our children as well as the overgrown children (AKA: adults).
As is usually the case, the animation is fantastic.  Disney takes us into the fantasy world of make-believe and makes it almost believable.  I liked the songs on this film more than most Disney films, too.
All in all, this makes for a big-time addition to the family-friendly section of your DVD collection.  The beauty of life and the beast of existing;  this one covers it all.",1042588800,,955,4.417142857142857
593680,1,6303142346,"When I bought Disney's Beauty and the Beast ""Special Platinum Edition"" I was expecting just that, a high quality film with added extras not contained on the original.  Instead, what I found myself with was a tampered work of art, a disgraced former masterpiece.  The entire movie looks like it has had it's color stripped from it and repainted with bargain bin paints.  No longer are there rich colors, sharp contrasts, and beautiful sceney, but now the film looks worse than it's straight to video sequel. The cover looks great, that's what the film used to look like, but the actual DVD is no where near that good looking.  Some of the animation looks like it has had some of its detail removed and when I was watching it seemed like some of the frame rate was reduced because of the sluggish movement of the characters mouths when speaking.  It is a completely different movie and I have since returned my copy and stuck with my original release.  Some of the games and extra features are interesting and entertaining, but that's really like saying a TV show was awful, but there was a funny commercial here and there.  I wish Disney would stop messing around with their work and just leave it the way we all saw it and loved it in the theaters.  Walt would have never let something like this leave the studio if he were still running it, and that's the bottom line.",1042502400,,1369,4.536585365853658

593683,5,6303142346,"The 1990's was a great decade for animation. We had old classics like Fantasia, Pinnochio, Snow White and Jungle Book brought back to the theatre with the addition of Toy Story 1 and 2, Aladdin, Anastasia, The Iron Giant and The Lion King (and the late 1980's helped put animated films back on the market with American Tale, Who Framed Roger Rabbit and The Little Mermaid). I think one movie that set the standards for quality in animation in the 1990's was Beauty and the Beast.

The music (composed by Alan Menken, with songs like ""Be Our Guest""), the voices (Paige O'Hara, Angela Landsbury and others), the story and the animation bring it to life. The movie also brings home the old adage that you can't judge a book by its cover. The extra features are nice, too (I'll get to them later). I have to admit I was a bit skeptical about the ""Human Again"" sequence, but I think it flows wonderfully with the rest of the film (basically, it's a song the prince's subjects sing in hopes of being human again).

It all starts out when a spoiled and selfish prince is punished for his bad attitude, along with the rest of the castle. He's transformed into a beast, since he acted no better than a beast. His only hope is an enchanted rose, which will wilt on his 21st birthday and the ability to love and be loved before the last petal falls (but he's given up hope on that happening). Meanwhile not too far from the castle, a beautiful, introverted bookworm named Belle (played by Paige O'Hara) is the talk of the village. The pompous Gaston has a big crush on her but alas, the feeling is unrequited. Her father Maurice is a slightly eccentric but lovable inventor. He accidentally stumbles upon the castle and is taken prisoner by the grumpy Beast. Belle comes to save her father and takes her father's place as prisoner. Though his quick temper turns her off, Belle is eventually able to see his true nature and the Beast makes a new friend.

For those of you who prefer the original the way it was shown in 1991, this is also available on this edition. There are interviews with many of the different cast members, animators and other people behind the scenes. Also, a spoken commentary throughout the film is available. I haven't really bothered with the extra games (those are probably more geared for kids anyways).

To wrap this up, you have until January 31, 2003 to add this classic to your collection. Otherwise, you'll have to wait another 10 years for its release or pay big bucks at auctions for it!",1042070400,,2510,4.54646017699115
593714,5,6303142346,"Regarded by many as the greatest animated film of all time, Disney's classic ""Beauty And The Beast"" is a majestic and exhilarating movie experience.  It's a film so amazing, so spectacular, it received six Academy Award nominations, including Best Picture - an historic first for an animated feature film.
This ""tale as old as time"" follows the story of Belle, a bright young woman with a vivid mind, who longs for ""something more than the provincial life"" than she experiences in her small hometown village in France.  Because of her ambition and her longing for exploration and adventure, she is misunderstood by the other townsfolk.  And also, due to her being the most beautiful girl in town, she has attracted the attention of the handsome, yet unkind, selfish, arrogant, and vain Gaston, the local hearth-throb.
One day, after yet again spurning the affections of Gaston, an unusual set of circumstances finds Belle imprisoned in the castle of a (seemingly) fearsome beast.  With the help of the castle's delightful staff, a teapot named Mrs Potts, her teacup son Chip, a candelabra named Lumiere, and a clock named Cogsworth, romance blossoms between these two unlikely friends and Belle soon sees beyond the beast's ugly appearance to the gentle and kind soul that he possesses and learns the most important lesson of all - that true beauty lies within the heart and the soul and not the skin.  Indeed, that is a lesson that the viewer learns as well.
Embraced, beloved, and celebrated by moviegoers worldwide when it was released theatrically in the early 1990's, ""Beauty And The Beast"" will enchant you, delight you, and captivate both young and old viewers alike with it's Oscar winning music (Best Score and Best Original Song), awesome animation, and a cast of the most lovable and memorable Disney characters the screen has ever seen (except of course, for those seven little men!)",1042070400,,1895,4.984177215189874
593715,5,6303142346,"I originally didn't want to see this movie in when it was in the theater;  I thought I was too ""grown up"" for it (I was 18 when it came out), and waited for it to come to video to see it.  I saw it at a friend's house and from the first frame, I had a tear in my eye, so I knew I was in for something good.  Boy, did I underestimate this movie.  I loved it!  It did a wonderful job of explaining what the story was all about--a prince turned into a hideous beast by an enchantress ""who had seen that there was no love in his heart"".  The bottom line in this movie is to learn not to be tricked by appearances.  True beauty lies within.
The DVD release was a real treat for me as I had worn out 2 copies of this tape!  Not only are both versions (theatrical version and the IMAX version) on the disc, but it was really cool to see it as a ""work-in-progress"".  I also loved seeing the Celine Dion/Peabo Bryson video in the end.  Even though I am not a fan of either of them, I really love this song.
If you have never seen a Disney movie (and I don't think that there's anyone young or old who hasn't!), don't just rent this one, BUY IT!  You'll be glad you did!",1041811200,,1160,3.893617021276596
593716,5,6303142346,"I`ll be honest with you here - I went out and bought this DVD because I remember loving the film at the cinema in Britain a decade ago (well, I was around nine years old then, cut me some slack), and I wanted to re-aquaint myself with it.
So how does this film hold up? Was it a sane purchase, or has nostalgia messed up my brain, exposing this reviewer as a sad and lonely individual? Read on to find out....
You probably all know the story backwards, but I`m going to tell you anyway. Set in and around a quaint little village in France in the 18th Century, we follow the adventures of Belle (Paige O`Hara) a bright and beautiful young girl who finds escape from her everyday life - and the advances of a boorish, somewhat foppish suitor named Gaston - by reading books. Meanwhile, off in a castle, a cruel prince is turned into a tormented beast by an enchantress, also transforming his servants into household objects. In order to remove the curse, the Beast (Robby Benson) must discover a true love who will return his affection before the last petal falls from an enchanted rose. With the help of the castle`s enchanted staff, Belle sees beneath the Beast`s exterior and discovers the heart and soul of a human prince.
Beauty And The Beast came in the middle of a Disney renaissance (starting off with 1989`s The Little Mermaid). To this day, BATB remains the only animated movie in the history of the Academy to be nominated for an Oscar for Best Picture - something the likes of Shrek (2001) and the Toy Story films couldn`t match.
Disc 1 houses 3 versions of the movie (Original 1991 Theatrical release, Special Edition and rarely seen ""Work In Progress""). I started with the 1991 release as thats` the one I remember.
The film looks brilliant, with a High Definition, anamorphic 1.85:1 transfer meaning I could pick out little details I`d never noticed before - and an excellent Dolby Digital 5.1 track too, the best I`ve heard this film sound. I`m no expert but I don`t think DD sound was invented back in 1991...
This is just simply a lovely, charming film - even though its` a story which has been told and spoofed countless times (most recently in Shrek in 2001). I also felt for the characters (its` rare when an animated film does that) especially the Beast`s ""death"" scene - that is emotional.
The animation is excellent - the famous ballroom dancing scene (because of its` use of computers) was groundbreaking at the time.
The songs are great - giving the film an almost Broadway/West End like feel, as if it was meant to be performed on stage, from the operetta like opener Belle, to comedy character song Gaston (funny!) to the superb Busby Berkely like, showstopping Be Our Guest (this song even inspired a ""Simpsons"" parody - See My Vest).
Be Our Guest in particular is a testament to the composing genius of Alan Menken and the late Howard Ashman, as it sounds like a classic musical song like you`ve heard before, yet it is also very fresh at the same time. 3 songs - Belle, Be Our Guest and the title song Beauty And The Beast - sung by Angela Lansbury in the film and Celine Dion and Paebo Bryson over the end credits, were Oscar nominated. The title song ended up with the gong.
Marvellous.
In the Special Edition version, listen out for an extra song called Human Again.
Disc 2 is full of extras - Making Ofs, Trailers, TV spots, Conceptual Art... the list goes on. I haven`t been through all of these yet but they`re very well presented indeed - if you have patience check out the Break The Spell game in The West Wing (navigate falling objects with complex button presses, and match character`s shadows to their human equivalents).
Some people may sneer at Disney for their curious paractices concerning Asian cinema, but the fact remains they have made some classic animated features - see this as a reminder of what Disney was capable of before ""traditional"" animated films fell out of fashion - and prepare to smile with joy, sniffle, and go ""awwww"" all over again.",1041811200,,3998,4.593006993006993

This was first shown in New York in 1992 in front of critics who gave it a standing ovation.

I'm amazed by the restoration job done on the theatrical cut; the colors are very vibrant. The film was restored, remastered and remixed in 5.1 and it was given a high definition transfer, but the upgrades never stick out (in ways they do, for example, on the Star Wars Special Editions). Now you have DVD quality with surround sound and three different versions of the film, all with their own unique style with commentary. If you want to buy this and you have a DVD player, I strongly urge you to buy the DVD instead of the VHS tape; it's in widescreen, and it's just much sharper.

593798,5,6303142346,"BEAUTY AND THE BEAST, the only animated film to be nominated for a Best Picture Academy Award, is a magical film about Belle, ""a beauty but a funny girl"" who loves books and wonders ""there must be more than this provincial life!"" Belle wants ADVENTURE! She is a marvelous protagonist because so many can relate to her. Yes, Belle is a dreamer but also has a strong, courageous heart to make her dreams come true. She is inspiring because she maintains a balance of her desires for a better life by finding  some joy in every day, no matter what the circumstances are.
One day, through an unexpected turn of events, she finds herself locked in a dungeon for the sake and love of her elderly father.  I like how she thinks of him before herself.  That is love.  Only when the Beast, a cruel and hideous monster who once was a prince, (and still is but must find a way to bring out the good in his heart for all to see to break the spell) sends her father away and she doesn't get to say goodbye, does she realize the permanence of her decision.  She has lost ""her father, her freedom and her dreams in one day."" However, dreams have a way of never dying.  As long as they are alive in our hearts there is always Hope.  I love the way throughout this movie this theme of hope and patience is repeated over and over.
BEAUTY AND THE BEAST has it all--fantastic characters (I love them all, even the bad ones, but must say, besides Belle and the Beast, I love Lumiere the best) and the voices, lively entertainment, a beautiful soundtrack (along with a new song ""Human Again"",) a new full sequence of ""Be Our Guest"" (well done!) and the rainbow of emotions conveyed: longing, fear, anger, sadness, smiles, laughter, loyalty, looking on the bright side, being courageous and having hope and patience. Also, I love to witness the contrast between the good and bad characters in Disney movies. What a great character study, always! But the transition of the Beast into a true prince at heart, is my favorite to watch; all it took was the right person to help him see the Beauty IN the Beast!
I deeply appreciate BEAUTY AND THE BEAST and movies like it which are wonderful reminders of so many valuable lessons:

1.) Don't judge a person solely by their outward appearance but by their heart. The inner person of the heart--that is who one really is. The heart can not be hidden, it WILL be revealed, but we must have patience to wait for this.
2.) Trust your heart and listen to it--Always.
3.) With patience and love, your dreams can come true.
4.) Never stop believing in yourself first. Because then no matter how things turn out, you are strong and proud of yourself.
5.) Remember that showing kindness and compassion to others is the key to inner peace and true happiness. Life isn't about receiving but about giving--of ourselves.
I applaud Disney on this excellent movie about following your heart even when it is difficult, because with enough heart and patience, everything in your life can turn around. 10/10 stars.  Thank you, Amazon. Red roses for everyone involved in this awesome, inspiring movie that won the Golden Globe for Best Picture.

I'd review B&B for you, but you already know what it's about! There are 3 versions of the movie on this DVD -- the original, the extended (that played in IMAX theaters last year) and the Animator's Roughs that was shown in 1992 at an Expo.  They're all 3 great!  The extended just includes one scene extra, ""Home Again"" which is a big song and dance production.  If you like those in Disney (your kids will) movies, watch this version.  Otherwise you're not missing much by watching the regular version.  The Rough version was just fascinating to watch, and I'm so glad they included it.
On top of the movie, there's a ton of DVD extras, especially for the kids. There's 4 games and a sing along, and they are extremely cute! My niece and nephew both love them to the point that I'm sick of seeing Chip!
The second disk of extras seemed to me primarily alot of animation 'behind the scenes' extras, which pleased me. Animated films seem to always be a bit mysterious, and this sheds alot of light on the process while making it interesting as well.
This was the best DVD purchase I've made in a long time. It's also extremely hard to find in most video stores and retailers, so I suggest you buy it here at Amazon.  Disney is going to stop making this DVD in January 2003 (next month) so I urge you to buy it while you can! You won't regret it.",1039219200,,1559,4.392361111111111

It was very funny and had an amazing love story. I have to admit that Beauty and the Beast turned me into a huge Disney fan again.
I was so happy when Beauty and the Beast was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Picture. Ever since then, no other animated film has been given such an honor.",1039046400,,461,3.967741935483871

After much whining, groaning, and anticipation, I was taken to the theatre on its opening day. I can't remember ever being as enthralled before or since! I saw it 7 time sin theatre, and have watched the video dozens more times. This DVD has recaptured that magic so a whole new generation of children can enjoy it.  The DVD has three versions of the film all of which are a joy to watch. I was so happy that they included the original film version, and not just the new version. Theres somethign comfortable in familiarity. there is also a work on progress which is just fascinating. It really helps one understand the whole process. There are alos hours of bonus feautures, most of which I haven't had time to even watch yet. there is also a game that has entertained my younger siblings for hours on end.

There is something magical about the original film--it is truly the most beautiful cartoon ever--but I also love the addition of ""Human Again,"" a fav tune from the Broadway soundtrack.
The quality is fantastic, the extra features are great.  The ""tale as old as time"" looks and sounds better than it ever did on VHS.  A must for any Disney fan.",1039046400,,521,4.7032967032967035

593805,1,6303142346,"I'm giving this edition a 1 star rating because Disney messed up the video quality. By including 3 versions of the film onto a single disc, the result is high video compression. The low quality is noticable on larger tv screens. As a friend of mine said before, this should've been a 3 disc set w/ 1 version on each disc. Wait til it's reissued if you want a high quality dvd.",1038873600,,376,4.236111111111111
593806,4,6303142346,"I can see why this movie made it so big when it hit the box office in 1990. It is a good family movie that is entertaining for parents and children. Most of the characters were interesting, especially the Beast, Gaston,and LaFlour(SP?). The plot is handled well and flows well. Most of the songs are memerable as well.
I can see why this brought Disney back of their slump of the 1980's. It brought back the traditional Disney story book Romance that we found in Snow White, Cinderella, and Sleeping Beauty. The animation, story, and character finally all came together.
The reason why I gave it 4 stars is that I noticed that the Beast and Belle seem to be off model in a few scenes, if only for a little while. It is most obviouse in the little dinner scene when the Beast tries to eat with a spoon. It just looks like the posture and the body and facial proportions are awkward to me for some reason. I know this is picky, and some may not even notice, care, or even think that its drawn funny. I just thought some scenes could have been looked at with a more carefull Disney eye.
On the DVD commentary they say that they didn't have much time to make the movie so I guess that is a good enough excuse.
Other than the above picky comments the DVD is great. At least on my TV set the color and picture is good. The sound seems to be good too. It has an entertaining and informative commentary and 3 versions of the film. The Original Version is probably the one I like the most since the story flows better with out the ""Special Edition"" scene thrown in. A cool little thing that Disney wouldn't normally do is throw in the complete ""work in progress"" version which shows the interesting rough pencil tests of the unfinished movie. The second disc has some nice art galleries and pretty interesting making-of features. Of course Disney had to throw in some useless games for the kiddies; which I haven't even looked into yet. All in all its a real good DVD, although not as good as the Snow White DVD.",1038787200,,2003,4.358288770053476
593867,4,6303142346,"This is possibly one of the best Disney cartoon musicals ever made, and the last of its kind to merit any value at all. If not because of the plot and usual Disney stunt crutches, then it is the the music and old-style animation that make this cartoon real. The singing voices are amazing, and help transform the film from mere cartoon to a bona fide musical. The French setting especially allows for glorious accents and can-can song and dance numbers.
It's good enough to allow me to ignore the usual Disney cliches, although I cringe trying to imagine this on Broadway, or worse, on ice.",1038700800,,590,4.5754716981132075

593869,5,6303142346,"When I saw ""Beauty and the Beast"" in the theater, I had a rare and magical experience:  I felt like a child again watching an enchanting Disney movie.  In fact, ""Beauty and the Beast"" seemed even better than the Disney classics like ""Cinderella"" and ""Sleeping Beauty"" that were such a wonderful part of my childhood.  The animation is absolutely gorgeous--particularly the waltz scene, which feels incredibly three-dimensional.  The songs are beautiful, singable instant classics.
Despite the animated characters, I felt like I was watching an old musical.  The movie opens with a scene reminiscent of ""The Sound of Music,"" with our heroine, Belle, singing on a hilltop about wanting more out of life.  The ""Be Our Guest"" scene, featuring a Lumiere (the Maurice Chevalier-inspired singing candlestick), dancing dishes and champagne corks popping like fireworks, reminded me of the Busby Berkely musical extravaganzas of the '30s.
A big appeal for me is that Belle is a much different heroine than the Disney princesses of my childhood.  Belle isn't looking for a man to rescue her from her life of drudgery.  She loves to read and longs for a more interesting life.  She already has the ""town catch,"" Gaston, wanting to court her, but she's having none of it.
Belle's escape from ""her provincial life"" begins when her father, a kooky inventor, doesn't return from his travels.  (He has sought shelter from a snow storm in a spooky enchanted castle and is being held prisoner by the Beast.)  Belle tracks down her father and, out of concern for his ailing health, takes his place in captivity.  The Beast, who has been placed under a spell, wonders if Belle might be ""the one""--the young woman whose love will return him to his original human form.
The enchanted furniture, candlestick, clock and dishes added lots of fun characters to the traditional story.  Cogsworth, a stuffy clock, and Lumiere, the match-making candlestick are a great comic duo.  Cogsworth's romantic advice to Beast about wooing Belle is especially funny:  Give her ""flowers, chocolates, promises you don't intend to keep.""
Gaston, meanwhile, wants to woo and wed Belle himself.  He sings about his he-man attributes in one of the funniest ode to a redneck that I've ever heard:  ""I use antlers in all of my decorating,"" Gaston sings about himself.
When Gaston realizes that Belle loves the Beast instead of him, he stirs up an angry mob to head to the castle.  In another twist on the traditional fairy tale ending, Belle ultimately rescues the Beast--not the other way around.
""Beauty and the Beast"" is a delightful classic whether you are a child or a grownup who knows how to feel like a child at times.",1038268800,,2680,4.9309576837416484
593870,4,6303142346,"My three year old was on a ""Beast"" kick for about two weeks.  He had to watch it everyday.  He knew all the parts.  I think that is a sign of a good movie.  He is the target audience and he enjoys it.  My wife likes it too, so I think it meets it's mark.  The sound quality is great and the picture is good.  There are some computer games and a game you can play from your DVD player.  I think that means it has something for everyone.",1038268800,,435,3.808988764044944
593871,5,6303142346,"What can I say that others have not?  After it was nominated, Michael Medvid and others thought that it should have won for BEST PICTURE at the Academy Awards.  Instead the Academy gave the honor to SILENCE OF THE LAMBS.  Never were there two films as diametrically opposed.  BEAUTY AND THE BEAST was family fare with charming music, skillful animation, and a happy ending.  Hannibal the Cannibal, on the other hand, gave us a lurid R-rated tale with gross violence, nudity, and the partial triumph of evil.  The word leaked out that while the Disney production was the better film, the Academy felt compelled to give the award to a film with live-action human actors.
Disney was unprepared for the subsequent backlash against their film from celebrities in the acting field.  Not mentioned on the DVD was the fact that the subsequent Broadway production was, in large part, an attempt at appeasement to the acting community that publicly lamented the use of cartoons over live actors in the musical.
We all know the story.  An inhospitable young man is punished by an enchantress by being transformed into a hairy monster.  His servants are changed into various household items.  They are reduced from persons into things or objects-- always the price of inhospitality.  The Beast has until his 21st birthday to find someone to love who will love him in return.  If he does not, the last petal on a mystical rose will fall and he will remain a monster forever.  When all seems lost, a beautiful girl comes into his life who softens his heart of stone.  A rival suitor will try to kill him, but her love for him will win the day.
The story has always been a wonderful metaphor, a parable so to speak.  Without love, we are all monsters.  With love, life is given its meaning and we are changed.

Love does not found on appearance, but love is found within, that is what Beauty and the Beast all about.

It comes with 2 discs.  Disc one (main disc).  Disc two (Supplemental Features)

When Disc 1 is inserted, it automatically plays the sneek peeks:
- Jungle Book 2
- The Lion King (Imax version)
- Beauty and the Beast (Enchanted Christmas Special Edition)
- Lilo & Stich (Beauty and the Beast) &

After that, an eye popping and jaw dropping of 3D rendered intro bringing you to the interactive DVD menu:

The film features 3 version:

Special Edition
Original Theatrical Edition
Work-In-Progress Edition

Special Edition: Figuring a never-seen-before musical footage known as ""Human Again"".  This song was taken out from normal edition because it causes timing error that sadly the song as to take out.  At January 1st 2002,  This special edition was shown on Imax Theatre as well as other giant screen theatres.  It was shown in Singapore Science Center from January 2002 to June 2002 as well.  Since there are no giant screen theatre in Malaysia, My girlfriend and I went to Singapore, purposely to catch this wonderful show.  It comes with 3 audio channel:
- English
- French &
- Audio Commentary

Since the story is on France background, French is definately can not be excluded.  Audio Commentary is another interesting audio, the director commented every moments in the film with interesting stories happened during production.

It also comes with 2 subtitles:
-  Sing-along track
-  English

The Sing-along track is sub-title only on musical sequences.

Work-In-Progress Edition:  It is shown in 1991 New York Film Festival.  You can see many of the sketches, pencil drawing, concept arts are playing on this version.

Disc 1 also features a small interactive game called ""Break The Spell"".  A kiddie game, nothing much worth to mention here.

Disc 2 features a lot of information and fun staffs.  I can't list them one by one, it is just too many of it.  However, I would like to highlight the main interesting ones on Disc 2.
-  The Making of Beauty and the Beast
-  The Story Behind The Story (hosted by Celine Dion)
-  MTV of Beauty and the Beast
  o Sung by Celine Dion & Peabo Bryson
  o Pop version, sung by Jump 5 (not too bad actually)

It comes with a nice full coloured booklet covering:
-  Introduction by the Producer Don Hahn
-  Sitemaps of Disc 1 and Disc 2.  Typically sitemaps of Disc 2, due to the huge contents, the middle page is folded in.  When you flip open the middle page, it reviews a panoramic containing the full sitemap of the Disc 2.
-  Features of the DVDs

A must-have for a DVD collectors especially you are a Disney animation fans and Beauty and the Beast fans.",1038182400,,3017,4.609433962264151
593873,5,6303142346,"This movie is a must-have for any Disney fan. Origianlly released in the early 1990's, this was one of the first movies to actually use computer generated environments, although all the characters were still hand drawn. The movie captures the classic fairy tale, where the Beast must make someone fall in love with him despite his appearance.
Overall, the movie is spectacular. There are 3 different versions included in this set: the Original Theatrical Release, Special Edition, and Commentary. The Special Edition version includes a couple of scenes that were originally cut from the Theatrical Release, and have since been remastered.
My only complaint: I'm not sure why each version was included as a whole, instead of having the ""Special Edition"" version play the original release plus a couple of extra scenes. Same with the commentary: they could have just included the commentary as a separate audio track instead of re-recording the whole movie over again. I get the feeling that Disney included each as a separate ""recording"" (as you can see by watching the track numbers on your DVD player as you play each version) to fill up a whole disk with this somewhat short movie, and to justify having a second disk for other ""extras"". Overall, though, the movie is worth it.",1038096000,,1279,4.981308411214953
593874,5,6303142346,"This is one of the best children's movies ever. I think that the story is exciting enough to keep kids of all ages interested. At the same time, it is not too scary and is ultimately uplifting. The music is captivating. The animation is seamless. Every kid should have this in their collection!",1038009600,,294,4.566037735849057
594605,4,6303142346,"This film was one of the first in a series of what I call the ""New Disneys"". Beginning with ""The Little Mermaid"", the New Disneys were made to be more accessible to grown-up viewers. The New Disneys are designed with more than kids in mind, taking into account that parents are bringing the kids to the theater and have to sit through whatever the kids are watching. Another factor the New Disneys consider is the changing moral and social tastes of the public (Heaven forbid we ever have an Eminem-inspired rapper Mickey!).
One manifestation of a New Disney is a sexier character design than previously seen in the Classic Disneys. Here we see three buxom blondes mooning over the arrogant bad-boy, Gaston. Beauty herself is drawn in a somewhat full-figured, realistic style. The key, of course, is to add these kind of elements seamlessly. Too little, the effect will not work. Too much, and the audience will notice and react negatively (these are supposed to be kids' movies, after all).
New Disneys are also more politically correct, which can be grating when they push it to the Nth degree.
In this film, we have an interesting story that, in the best/worst Disney traditions, does not always follow the original source material faithfully. However, the animation and songs (Be Our Guest), more than make up for any deficiencies in the lack of fairy tale accuracy. We are even treated to some experimental computer animation, most notably in the famous ballroom dance sequence.
A great cast offers up good voice characterizations, too. It sure is nice to know that Jo Anne Worley is still working!
While ""The Lion King"" is (so far) the high water mark of the New Disneys, ""Beauty & the Beast"" is still an excellent work. The extras offered on the Platinum Edition are absolutely stellar, and any fan of this animated feature will be enthralled for hours just going through the bonus material.",1037836800,,1898,4.843076923076923

The one thing that bothers me is that somewhere in the high-definition digital transfer, the original richness and vibrancy was lost.  The colors in this DVD edition seem to be muted and rather lackluster compared to my original VHS copy.  If you've seen the original, you'll know what I mean.

594683,5,6303142346,"Having a toddler, we didn't have the chance to see this film in a theater so we were very pleased to receive a complementary copy from Disney, and have watched the film many times in the past week. The movie a real Disney classic in the sense that it appeals to children and adults. The introduction tells the story of a selfish prince who, being uncharitable and unkind to an old woman, is turned into a beast while his castle and servants are enchanted. They can only be returned to their natural state if the prince falls in love, and is loved in return, before the last petal drops off an enchanted rose. The animation and Menken-Ashman songs are some of Disney's best. The film deserved its Oscar nomination, and you can see why it became a successful Broadway musical.
You could spend days looking through all the dvd material. If you've seen the special editions of Snow White or Monsters, Inc. you'll know what to expect. There are two discs: the first contains three versions of the film -- the original theatrical release, the IMAX theater edition with the new song 'Human Again', and a fascinating ""work-in-progress"" version that alternates between pencilled, cartooned and fully animated representations. Disc Two contains many dvd extras. There are games, trivia quizzes, featurettes about the making of the film as well as the musical on Broadway, two music videos, and excellent features showing the behind-the-scenes doings of cast, voice work and art. Our favorite extras were Mrs. Potts' Personality Profile Game, where you answer several questions and are told which character you most resemble, and ""The Story Behind the Story"" where celebrities recount the origins of many Disney tales, including The Hunchback of Notre Dame, Jungle Book, Mulan, Cinderella, Sleeping Beauty, and Beauty & the Beast. I really enjoy seeing the layouts and designs, and how the animations are drawn and developed. The trivia games are lots of fun, and IMHO they work better than the games requiring navigation with the remote.
Packaging and foldout look very nice and, with so many options, are extremely helpful for finding the features you're interested in. We are very happy with this excellent family film and the many extra features included.",1036627200,,2248,4.997333333333334

I wouldn't have thought the animation could be improved from the original, but it has!  It blows the mind to see this quality.  Not to mention that the storyline and musical score have always been superb as well.

Essentially this film shows the true meaning of what is the most and perhaps the only real important thing in everybody's life. Althought it seems to be a children movie, there is a lot to be learned from the adult viewer as well. As far as video quality goes, the picture is sharper, brighter and cleaner than the original tape but the colors tend to be less vivid and toward the brown/red spectrum. The picture in the original vhs edition is not as sharp but it has more depth and better color fidelity which gives it a more filmlike appearance. The audio quality of the new version is disappointing. The overall soundtrack is less bright and not as loud as the original version. Overall I am keeping both versions, the new one for the extra footage and the old one for better quality sound and somewhat better video. This comparisons are based on vhs vs. vhs version of the movie.",1036454400,,955,4.494252873563219
594687,5,6303142346,"When ""Beauty and the Beast"" came out in theaters over 10 yrs ago, I thought this movie was the best animation feature that Disney had released, and since that time none have come close.
So when Disney released this film classic on DVD, I had to buy it, even though I already own the VHS version.
Boy! I am very happy with my purchase, the additional scene goes very good with the flow of the original version, and it is hard to tell that a scene was added.
For those who haven't seen the Broadway production might wonder where on earth did they come up with this?  The music was original, but I guess for time, they(producers/director) decided to scrap it.  However, it was incorporated in to the Broadway production.
The DVD version is fabulous, the animation is much clearer and the music crisp.  One of the many bonuses of having DVD is the menu options...they even have a sing-along option!",1036454400,,894,4.540372670807454
594688,5,6303142346,"Let's face it:
  Atlantis, Mulan, Hunchback, etc. With the exception of the Lion King and maybe Aladdin, Disney has been a ruthless money grubbing machine who doesn't turn out movies worth a 7 dollar ticket, and would make Walt himself stop from spinning in his grave and wonder what the hell are they attaching his name to.
  However there was a time when things were different. The words 'Once upon a time' were always concluded with  'Happily ever after' And everything didn't have to have a sequel. Beauty and the Beast was the high point of that renaissance.
  Classic characters and wonderful music composition make this the best movie disney has ever put out. Perfectly adapted from classic literature and put into big screen form, this movie was the only animated feature ever nominated for best picture; and well worth nominating.
  Its release on DVD is both a blessing and a curse with Disney holding off on its main titles in order to strike up huge demand. The DVD itself does the movie justice by allowing you to pick the version of the movie you want to see. The one you fell in love with years ago, or the one they obviously tried to make even more money off of earlier in the year at IMAX. (that should tell you which one I watch.)
  This is one of my favorite movies ever. Partially because of how I first saw it, but its perfect for everyone old and young.",1036368000,,1375,4.504032258064516
594689,5,6303142346,"It seems that Disney loves to bring a wonderful movie out and then take it back and revamp it and bring it out again just to see if they can make it better.  Well, with Beauty and the Beast they have done just that.  When this film was first released in 1991 was a instint classic to the crowd of young and old.  Then as time expired and technology grew and DVD players arrived.  Disney decided to take Beauty and the Beast of the market and recreate it a little and re-release it.
  This timeless classic about a beast that lives in a castle where he has been living ever since he was cast under a spell by a old women and a young women named Annabelle who is the girl of any guy's wildest dream collide together.  Annabell runs into the forest in the late evening and is hunted down by wild dogs who try to hurt her and yet the beast comes and helps her out and takes her to his castle.  The beast who has no behavior qualities to him has help from the servants who are suffering under the same spell as the beast and were turned into different types of either china or piece of furniture.  As the story progrosses...Anabelles father finds out that she is in the castle and wants to save her.  The father knows of only one person who will help him and that is this guy who is in love with Annabelle and yet knows that she doesn't like him.  The story moves on to the point that there is a romance growing between Annabelle and the Beast and yet the Beast needs to find true love before the spell ends or else he will end up a beast for good.  Watch this funny, romantic, and cute animated movie together as a family and relive a classic over and over again. It is worth watching.

594690,3,6303142346,"I was eight years old when Beauty and the Beast first came out, and I must say, I prefer the old video version to this new DVD. I watched the DVD the other night while I was babysitting. There's a song in it called ""Human Again"" that wasn't in the first release. I could see why they cut it. Except for the kind of touching little scene with Belle and the Beast reading, that corny song was unnecessary. Also, I dunno if this was due to the TV or not, but the colors seemed too rich, too bright (i tried adjusting the TV, but the colors still didn't look right). I remember the colors being much softer, not so intense. The DVD version of the movie looked too much like a TV cartoon rather than feature film animation. I did like the sound, though. Unless you're a huge fan of the movie and want to see the extras included in the DVD, I suggest searching for the old release of the video (that is in good condition) in a used video store.",1036281600,,938,4.15934065934066
594691,5,6303142346,"This is my favorite Disney film and I'm so pleased to own it on dvd. Made during Disney's ""rebirth"" in the late 80's and early nineties, this film was released to both critical and popular acclaim. After receiving 6 Oscar nominations and winning for best song, the film continued to be a favorite among many. Last year, Disney re-released the film on IMAX, a visual treat and now they are giving us three editions in this edition! This dvd is filled with lots of goodies, including games, commentaries, videos as well as the special edition shown in IMAX, the original edition and the ""work in progress"" that was shown at the New York film festival before the premiere of the film. The story of Belle, a young woman who dreams of adventure in her life is beautifully animated and filled with great songs that stay with you long after you've seen the film. All the characters are lots of fun and the film pretty well embodies all you could ask in a film---romance, adventure, musical numbers, and a good villain! This is a guaranteed good time for little ones and those of us adults who love a great animated film. A great gift for a friend, a little one, or yourself! This is a great two dvd set.

I just thought: ""oh what the heck, I'll buy it even though I already have the VHS version"".  But boy, was in for a great surprise!!  I loved the original version that came out in 1991, and I still love it today even though I'm a bit older, but this DVD takes the cake!  This DVD is magnificent.  You can really tell that Disney spent a lot of time, effort, and $MONEY$ into making this DVD.  Don't let the fact that it's a ""cartoon"" fool you.  THis DVD comes jam packed with behind the scene footage, directors comments, games, music videos, etc.  I'm telling you, there is SOO much on this DVD!!  I'm still discovering new things on it!  Some of the great features on this DVD is the afore-mentioned directors comments in the background that you can switch over to, if you want.  Also, this DVD movie can be viewed in it's entirety in French! Since I'm trying to work on my french, I found this feature especially wonderful.
I don't want to give away any more surprises, but TRUST me, this DVD makes a GREAT gift for the young and the old!  I would DEFINITELY buy it or order it if you haven't already.",1036195200,,1244,4.310344827586207
594733,5,6303142346,"Let me start by saying that I have seen ""Beauty And The Beast"" more times than any other film. It was by far my favorite when I was a little kid. I was six years old, and getting the VHS for Christmas in 1992 was one of the best presents I have ever received. I was so enthralled by this movie. The animation, the songs, and most of all the story enraptured me. And I had so much ""Beauty And The Beast"" merchandise, it's insane. Pizza Hut dolls, a Beast stuffed animal, a board game, and Velcro shoes with Belle and The Beast on them. Yes, they were technically for girls, but I didn't understand that. (I was 6 years old.) They were ""Beauty And The Beast"" shoes, and I wanted them! Anyway, I have a long 18 year history with ""Beauty And The Beast,"" and it may just be my all-time favorite film. I have absolutely no criticism for this film. In my eyes, it's perfect. When I got the Platinum Edition DVD in 2002, I realized what a truly great film ""Beauty And The Beast"" is. The animation in the ballroom sequence is groundbreaking, Alan Menken's score is fantastic, and Howard Ashman's lyrics are brilliant. Take the song ""Belle,"" for example. You learn all about Belle, her relation to the townspeople, the town itself, and Gaston's desire to marry Belle. ""Be Our Guest,"" ""Something There,"" and ""Beauty And The Beast"" are musical and lyrical works of art.

The voice talent is incredible. Paige O'Hara (Belle), Robby Benson (Beast), Jerry Orbach (Lumiere), Angela Lansbury (Mrs. Potts), David Ogden Stiers (Cogsworth), and Richard White (Gaston) are all perfectly cast. Paige O'Hara brings a wonderful intelligence to Belle, and Robby Benson is superb at vocalizing the Beast's inner torment. In fact, I have an autographed picture from the film signed by Paige O'Hara and Robby Benson that I got as a gift from Walt Disney World that I just cherish The animation is also wondrous to behold. There is something about hand-drawn animation that computer animation can't quite match, in my opinion. The characters in ""Beauty And The Beast"" feel so alive. The film is perfect. It was perfect in 1992 when I was 6 years old, and it's perfect now. (100/5) (Yes, I love the film that much.)

Blu-Ray Review:

Picture Quality: The film is presented in a 1.78:1 aspect ratio. To put it simply, the picture quality is flawless. The colors are wondrous, and  the image is razor sharp. This is by far superior to the 2002 Platinum Edition DVD version which looked more pastelish. The darker more bold colors from the original release have been restored, and it's perfection. (5/5)

Sound: The DTS-HDMA 7.1 track is positively thunderous. The music fills the soundstage wonderfully. Also, when the Beast roars, it is LOUD. The 2002 DVD Dolby Digital 5.1 mix was pretty lifeless, but the Blu-Ray track has so much life to it. Perfection. (5/5)

Extras: There are tons of extras here. First, there are three different versions  of the film. There's the original theatrical version (which I prefer, since it's the verison I fell in love with 18 years ago), the 2002 Special Edition which integrated the song ""Human Again"" into the movie, and a PIP version of the Work In Progress Version which was shown at the New York Film Festival in 1991. There are deleted scenes, art galleries, original trailers and TV spots, and kid games which I have no interest in. Then comes the amazing ""Beyond Beauty"" documentary. This is an interactive documentary which allows you to branch off to different subjects of interest throughout. In all, the documentary runs about 2 and a half hours. This is one of the best and most interesting  documentaries on filmmaking I have ever seen. It's informative, but also highly entertaining. (5/5)

Overall: (5/5) The movie and Blu-Ray are both perfection. Buy it!",1036108800,,3776,4.752671755725191
594734,5,6303142346,"Just when we thought nothing could top last year's deluxe edition of SNOW WHITE AND THE SEVEN DWARFS, Disney have outdone themselves.  This sparkling new 2-disc of BEAUTY AND THE BEAST has been well worth the wait, and features an impressive print.
The first disc features three (count 'em) three versions of the film; the original theatrical release, the new IMAX version (featuring the restored ""Human Again"" musical sequence) and the work-in-progress version that was shown to standing ovations at the New York Film Festival in 1991.
The story is well-known by now; A selfish Prince has been put under a dreadful curse after angering an Enchantress disguised as an old crone.  The Enchantress changes the selfish Prince into a Beast for until he learns how to love and be loved in return .Belle (voiced by Broadway veteran Paige O'Hara) is the odd girl in her small French provincial town.  She is unwittingly being romanced by the boorish, self-absorbed Gaston (Richard White), when her father gets lost in the woods on his way to the invention fair.  Discovering that he has been held a captive by an evil Beast (Robby Benson), she offers herself in his place.  Slowly but surely, Belle and the Beast fall in love, and the enchanted objects (Mrs Potts, Cogsworth, Lumiere, Wardrobe and Chip) hope that the spell will soon be broken...
Other stand-outs in the voice cast are Angela Lansbury (Mrs Potts), David Ogden Stiers (Cogsworth), Jerry Orbach (Lumiere) and JoAnne Worley (Wardrobe).
The now-classic score by Alan Menken and the late Howard Ashman includes  three Oscar-nominated songs (""Belle"", ""Be Our Guest"" and ""Beauty and the Beast"") as well as ""Gaston"", ""Something There"" and ""The Mob Song"".
Extra features are plentiful and include making-of featurettes, extensive galleries and interviews as well as info and footage on the Broadway musical ""Beauty and the Beast"" which opened in 1994.  There are some galleries of posters and stills from the show.  However, most posters only feature later Belles's like Andrea McArdle and Toni Braxton.  I would have liked more stills of Susan Egan and Deborah Gibson.
There is also the ""Break the Spell"" game which actually starts on Disc 1 but comes over onto Disc 2.
BEAUTY AND THE BEAST is a true Disney classic that everyone should have in their collection.",1035936000,,2314,5.005208333333333
594735,5,6303142346,"""Beauty and the Beast"" has rarely been retold in a manner that breaks the mold and gives the leads dimension. But Disney's production of the classic fairy tale, one of the last truly great Disney movies, was an outstanding feature that attracted the attention of adults and kids alike. And now the movie has been rereleased with a second DVD and some deleted material that viewers have never seen before.
Bookish Belle (Paige O'Hara) is something of an oddity in her village -- viewed as a dreamy weirdo by the villagers, and viewed with possessive intent by the arrogant hunk Gaston (Richard White). Belle is, unsurprisingly, completely uninterested in Gaston -- something that makes him even more determined to marry her. But Belle's life changes when her inventor father Maurice (Rex Everhart) becomes lost in a sinister forest on his way to a fair. He finds shelter in a giant, seemingly abandoned castle -- only to be dragged off to a cell by an enormous, shadowy figure.

Belle finds her way to the castle, and locates Maurice. But the enormous, savage Beast that rules the castle will only release Maurice if Belle agrees to stay in the castle -- forever. (We learn at the beginning that a spell of true love will turn the Beast back into a human being -- but the time limit is approaching) Belle agrees, and Maurice is sent back to the village. He frantically tries to gain help from the other villagers, but they laugh and dismiss him as crazy.

At the castle, which is populated by intelligent furniture such as lovesick candlelabra Lumiere (Jerry Orbach), teapot Mrs. Potts (Angela Lansbury), and fretful clock Cogsworth (David Ogden Stiers), Belle is growing to love the Beast, and the Beast is becoming more gentle. But Gaston's jealousy and the village's fear threatens Belle and the Beast both...

The additions to this DVD make it worth buying even if you already have a copy. A musical sequence never before seen has been picked up from the cutting-room floor and pasted back where it originally was: ""Human Again,"" a charming upbeat song and dance number (if what the animate object characters do can be called ""dancing"") that will rank up with ""Be Our Guest"" and ""Belle"" as a favorite. Moreover, the film has been digitally remastered, giving it a fresh, bright look -- most noticeable during the dance scene.

The second DVD contains plenty of good stuff. In the ""Mrs. Potts"" section there is a personality checker, where viewers can see who they most resemble; also intriguing interviews with several Disney voice-actors, including Celine Dion, James Earl Jones, Paige O'Hara, Angela Lansbury and more. Behind everyone's favorite clock-and-candle duo is a virtual gallery; behind Chip is some behind-the-scenes revelations about how the movie was made and a cute music game. Music videos (Celine Dion-haters better steer clear) and a very difficult ""Spell Adventure Game,"" that may challenge even die-hard fans who thought they could do it all. And for more insights into the movie, there is an ""audio commentary"" that can be switched on as the film plays. Be sure to check out the extras on the first disc, as the hardest game on the second hinges on information in the first.

Qualitywise, the film is outstandingly charming. There's romance, presented in a charmingly realistic manner; humor, ranging from the Beast's new hairstyle (""You look so... so..."" ""Stupid."") to Cogsworth's hysterical blathering. Character development is at its best here: Belle is a gal with a brain and her own mind, who isn't afraid to dream while keeping her feet on the ground when she needs to. The Beast initially will get no sympathy, but his gradual transformation from a blustering bully to a vulnerable sweetie. Gaston will elicit nothing but scorn; bumbling but good-hearted Maurice will charm viewers. And the ""animate objects"" are equally entertaining, bickering and conspiring and frantically trying to pair Belle and the Beast so that they can be ""Human Again.""

This ""tale as old as time"" is perhaps even more entrancing than before, seen at a more-than-full length with plenty of extras. A delightful story and a great movie.",1035849600,,4142,4.961095100864553
594736,5,6303142346,"BEAUTY & THE BEAST is truly a classic film. The story is timeless, yet relevant (recognizing love & inner beauty, and learning to love unconditionally with ""no strings attached""). The musical score is superb, and as this special edition DVD describes, it's launched an excellent Broadway musical. The characters are adorable and interesting, and the villains are despicable.  When Belle falls in love with the Beast, it's fun to see how they help each other grow -- Belle gains courage as the Beast gains compassion.
This platinum edition DVD continues Disney's recent trend of including everything you could ever ask for along with the film, which in this case is truly amazing. There are three versions of the movie included on this 2 disc set; one is the original theatrical release, another is the version which was first shown at the 1991 New York Film Festival (the work-in-progress edition), and the third is the amazing special edition which includes an all-new yet perfectly integrated ""Human Again"" scene.  There are also several games and activities for children on this disc, including a really fun one in which you answer questions and are matched up with which character you are most similar to. I also loved the musical game with Chip, which is good fun even for small children (it just involves matching musical notes). Grown-ups will love the Broadway musical featurette, the video with Celine Dion & Peabo Bryson, and all kinds of great ""making of"" shorts and documentaries which are simply too numerous to mention here!
I was very pleased to see a special section of seven Disney stories which describes the ""story behind the story"" of things like Cinderella and the Lion King.  I really love seeing the historical summary of these ancient tales, which also include a fresh and fun film summary of the story that children enjoy, too!
I highly recommend this DVD to any fan of musicals, Disney animation movies, or children at heart. It's truly a tale as old as time, which warms the heart and brightens one's day!

594737,4,6303142346,"A very well done DVD for a Disney movie that's just not one of my favourites. Much appreciated, though.",1035849600,,103,4.473684210526316
594738,4,6303142346,"There are a lot of good things to say about this wonderful movie, but the songs have to be at the top of any list.  Almost every song is among Disney's very best.  The only exception, ""Human Again"", is one that was re-inserted for this edition, having been cut for theatrical release -- it's not a bad song; it's just not up to the amazing standard of the others.  The arrangements are operatic in their complexity and the lyrics are flawless: by turns witty, moving and engaging.  ""Be Our Guest"" has got to be most dazzling single performance in a Disney picture; the title song won an Oscar; and ""Gaston"" would have been the best song in almost any other movie.
The story is one of the good old fairy tales, going back beyond Perrault to the 16th century and probably before.  Belle's father is trapped in an enchanted castle by a monstrous beast, who is really a handsome prince cursed by a good sorceress because of his evil temper.  Belle offers herself in her father's place, and you can guess the rest.  The story is well-done; the cast is uniformly excellent, though Angela Lansbury stands out with a terrific characterization of Mrs. Potts, the teapot.  The reproduction is beautiful.
There is also a set of extra features on the second DVD.  My seven-year-old daughter went through the ""Mrs. Potts' Personality Test"" in a few minutes and was delighted to discover she resembles Belle more than she does Mrs. Potts or the maid.  She also enjoyed a musical memory game with Chip, the teacup.  There's another game, though, which was a bit of a failure -- ""Maurice's Invention Workshop Game"".  You have to get a code from a game on disk 1, which isn't that hard to do, though it took a bit of fiddling around.  Then we got into the game and got up to a point where we had to dodge candlesticks, and found that no matter what we did, we bumped into a candlestick and lost.

594741,5,6303142346,"It's by no accident that ""Beauty and the Beast"" became the 2nd Installment in the new Walt Disney Pictures PLATINUM EDITION series.  After all, Snow White was the 1st PLATINUM EDITION DVD set giving us the background information about this full length TECHNICOLOR Animation film released in 1938 receiving worldwide recognition and immortalizing Walt Disney's animation.  Walt Disney & Company received honorary Oscars (presented by Shirley Temple). The songs from this classic movie are still sung by us all.  This animation feature changed Disney and our lives forever.
Now we have ""BEAUTY and the BEAST - PLATINUM EDITION a 2 DVD set with extensive background information.  What is truly amazing about this movie is;  it has the best story ever,  it was converted into a successful Broadway play which has over 3000 performances and is still running,  the music & songs are or more widely known than ""Snow Whites""!,  it was the first animation picture to ever be nominated for a ""BEST PICTURE - OSCAR"".
Some interesting facts about ""Beauty & the Beast"".  After the success of Snow White, Walt Disney bought the film rights to ""Beauty and the Beast"".  He felt this story was a perfect encore feature.  Unfortunately, Disney & his staff could not deliver believable interpretation on this French Classic Tale in the 1930's.  Again in the 1950's Disney attempted to bring ""Beauty and the Beast"" to the screen with no success.
The 1980's came and the new Disney Studios with the success of the ""Little Mermaid"" assembled the most talented cast, animators, scriptwriters & company to give us maestro Disneys vision to the screen!!
BEAUTY and the BEAST is the 1st animation feature ever to produce two equal characters who find each other through the most unusual circumstances.  This feature is the best paced, acted, animated and emotional ride since ""SNOW WHITE""!!
Summary - The story is amazing, the characters enchanting, the music extraordinary.  Belle our leading lady must free her captured father Maurice from the Beast castle.  She bargains with the him and agrees to exchange positons with her father & remain a prisoner forever.  She learns that the Beast has been cursed by an enchantress because of his mean & selfishness.  The Beast has one hope and that is to find true love before the enchanted rose loses all of its petals or remain a Beast forever.  The rose has begun to die & the petals have begun to shed.
This movie is the best Disney Entertainment.  The entire family will enjoy this because the story effects all of our emotions.  The music is so delightful, the cast is outstanding and the Disney Creators have brought the essence of Walts vision to life once again.  Don't miss this Special Edition classic with the animation sequence & song ""Human Again"" meticulously reproduced & added to the film.  Enjoy!",1035590400,,2832,4.94291754756871
594811,5,6303142346,"""Beauty and the Beast is Disney's greatest film.  It gets to the heart of human essence.  We need to see past the outside and see other people's insides.  C. S. Lewis wrote a novel called ""Till We Have Faces.""  When we see other people's faces, we begin to love them.  The key is seeing past the beast and seeing the image of God engraven on other's countenances.  That is the pure love of Christ!
This film has everything that you want in a tale: a good heroine, an antagonist that becomes the protagonist, hilarious buffoons, and a villain you can really hate.  This movie outstrips ""The Little Mermaid,"" and I hope it lasts forever.",1035504000,,635,4.517543859649122
594812,5,6303142346,"Like the sumptuous DVD of ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarves"", Disney has produced another gloriously packaged keepsake for its Academy Award-nominated film ""Beauty and the Beast"".
The DVD has enough contents to keep the viewer busy for days!  There are three versions of the movie here!  The ""work in progress"" version (all line drawings, black and white, and rough) is a little hard to watch after a while, but very interesting, nonetheless.
The menues are adorable and Disneyesque.  I find the disks to be very easy to navigate.  Although, on disk 2 the voices tell you not to choose the ""rose window"" -- that leads to the west wing of the castle and is forbidden!!  Of course, the first thing I wanted to do was click on the rose window.  So there is a sense of fun on the disk.
I found the documentaries to be especially informative.  The art of animation is explained.  The use of computers is shown.  The process of developing the story is fascinating: A powdered wig fop was the original villain.  ""Be My Guest"" was sung to Belle's father, not Belle.  There are lots of these stories. There are galleries that show the film's early artwork and the ""Dangerous Liaisons"" look that the artists were going for.
The movie itself is very entertaining.  I'm a huge admirer of the opening musical number (""this small provential town..."") - it sets the mood and tone for the film so wonderfully.
""Beauty and the Beast"" proved that Disney can sometimes achieve greatness with the animated film like Uncle Walt used to in the old days.  It's right up there with ""Lion King"" as one of the best films in the new Michael Eisner/Disney regime.",1035504000,,1635,4.655052264808362
594813,1,6303142346,"This movie is less than par, in fact not even sub par.  Leave it to disney to ruin a timeless classic such as this story.

594814,5,6303142346,"Ah, I can remember seeing this the first time in a dark, cold theater with my mom and grandma. I remember masquerading as Belle two years later for Halloween. I remember all the hours I spent singing along to a cassette I recorded from the film.
Good times.
Everyone knows the story of Beauty and the Beast. Belle is a beautiful French girl with the big dreams and caring nature. Sought by the macho egotist Gaston, Belle is heralded as one of the most gorgeous women in the town. But does this effect Belle? Of course not. Belle is sweet, caring, and as intelligent as they come. Could Gaston, who looks through her book one day and declares ""But there aren't any pictures!"" ever be an appropriate match for sensitive Belle?
As animated characters go, one must admit she's an inspiration.
Belle's father, Maurice, is the slightly odd town inventor. He is on his way to the fair to show off his newest creation, a wood-chopping machine, when he is dragged off to beast's castle.
When Belle shows up looking for Beast, it's obvious her stay isn't going to be conventional. There are talking teapots, candlesticks, and even clocks!
After agreeing to take her father's place as Beast's prisoner, the viewer is hooked. The beauty of the film is that it's most certainly not a conventional animated love story. Beast isn't much of a gem in comparison to Cinderella's prince, after all.
The design is incredibly pleasing. The splendor of the old, spooky, almost completely abandoned castle only adds to the intrigue that is Beauty and the Beast. From armoires jumping around choosing your wardrobe all the way up to the deteriorating fabrics and floors that make up Beast's chambers.
It's eye candy, no doubt. The DVD format is slightly less visually appealing because of 'enhancements' made to the film with computer technology. Colors are less true in places.
Despite all of the above, what makes the film timeless is the soundtrack. From the opening song through ""Beauty and the Beast,"" right up until the closing number, the instrumentals are outstanding and the songs are outstanding. They have bearing outside the film, away from Beast's gloomy world.
The DVD is an exceptional bet for the B&B enthusiast. It includes a 'personality' test (Ah, I'm officially Belle!), hours of bonus footage, celebrity commentary, the original music video with Celine Dion and a few interactive games. (Two or three, I believe)
They wrote ""Human Again"" into the film. For those of you who've seen the Broadway version, you'll of course know how clever this song is. I was quite disappointed with the animated rendition, however. The animation is choppy, uncreative, and perhaps even cliched. I'll admit I liked hearing it sung by the original film cast, but I wasn't impressed with their attempt to squeeze it into the film. It's worth hearing once or twice, but it's not as good as I'd hoped.
Of course, they included the original version Theatrical Release in here for me, so I can't complain.
I would VERY HIGHLY recommend buying this. It's a 90s film essential for all ages. Your kids will love it and I have a feeling you'll enjoy it more than you'll let on.",1035417600,,3146,4.817005545286507

I would not recommend this as a DVD buy.,1035417600,,358,4.725806451612903

594817,4,6303142346,"The wait is finally over. Disney has finally released Beauty and the Beast on DVD, and they appear as if they've outdone themselves. We not only get a restored version of the film, but 3(!) different versions, including the work-in-progress and the IMAX re-release all in glorious widescreen. However, everything is not quite what it seems.
Let's start with the presentation of the film itself. They've done a fabulous restoration as the film has never looked cleaner or brighter. The new song patched into the special edition is quite catchy and is good for variety's sake. It's wonderful to have the inclusion of the work-in-progress version, and it really displays the film's artistry. What's disappointing is that all 3 versions are on the same disc, and the quality suffers from it. The compression used has essentially created low-resolution images that often display ""jaggies"" throughout, which can be distracting. Also, the aspect ratio is different than on the original laserdisc release, effectively cropping off the top and bottom of the film so that we actually see less than what we saw in the theater. Is it any different than making the film full-screen and losing the left and right edges? Interestingly enough, the work-in-progress differs from the laserdisc release in that the title card has been replaced with the final card, a production credit has been removed from the intro, and some of the edits and transitions are rougher. The disc claims that this version is ""as shown"" at the 1991 New York Film Festival, but somehow I doubt it. It's a shame that this version wasn't put on the 2nd disc as a supplement, leaving the other two versions with a better visual quality.
Nonetheless, disc 2 contains a ton of great supplemental features. Most of the good stuff documents the genesis of the film up to the Special Edition theatrical release in one form or another. Some of the other items (games, music videos) are kind of lame and are worth viewing only once. There is a very challenging ""West Wing"" game (NOT about Martin Sheen and company), but that took only a couple of times to master and the payoff is lousy. An awful lot of work for basically nothing, but my 4 year-old loves it.
Still, this is the only DVD release being offered and you can't go wrong with it, despite my complaints. It's just too bad that in Disney's haste to cram as much stuff on this set as possible, they've damaged the release. 'Twas beauty that killed this ""Beast."" Knocked down 1 star due to the low-resolution transfers.",1035158400,,2527,4.824884792626728
594818,5,6303142346,"""Beauty and the Beast"" is one of those rare films (animated or live action) that never seems dated despite the fact that it was released just a decade ago. The premise of the whole film is timeless and can always be told over and over to impressionable viewers. The message that you should not judge a person by his or her appearance is an excellent message, especially today when people are being scrutinized simply because they are of a particular ethic group and/or religion. I think ""Beauty and the Beast"" succeeded in achieving that goal that you should not judge a person by his or her appearance and that beauty is only skin deep.
As a film, ""Beauty and the Beast"" is my personal favorite Disney film and all around film of all time. This movie isn't just for kids but for everyone of all ages. I loved the animation when the movie first came out in the movie theaters, and I still love it in the special edition format. Although I really didn't notice a terribly huge difference in the remastering in the quality of the film, I didn't care. The movie still manages to engage me for all 90 minutes. I did notice though that in the introduction just as the narrator was explaining how the prince became the Beast, I swore I never saw that shot of the stained glass window with the prince just standing there. I also noticed during the introduction that the rose was brighter than in the original format. I may be just imagining things though. I must admit that I was a bit suspicious of the inclusion of ""Almost Human"" but now that I have seen it. I just adore that segment. It was one of the funnier moments in the movie. I thought it flowed real well with the rest of the movie.
""Beauty and the Beast"" is one of the rare movies that I can never tire of watching. It is my personal favorite Disney movie (next to ""The Lion King"" and both ""Toy Story"" movies), and one of my all time favorite movies. Although it has been just over ten years since it was first released in the theaters, the movie still sounds fresh as ever.",1034985600,,2029,4.384615384615385

No, it is not the ne plus ultra of animated film as some insist, nor is it as good as the classic French live action version that it borrows from so liberally. For what it is, though, a sentimental, Broadway-style romantic musical comedy, it can't be beat. Good fun for the whole family, even if you don't have kids.
A new musical number available on the DVD does nothing to advance the plot, but is nevertheless a charming addition to the the film. A ""Work In Progress"" version provides fascinating insight into the animation process.",1034985600,,661,4.516666666666667

Ten years later, the masterpiece was shown in large screen/IMAX format; however, not everyone lives within close proximity to one.  The DVD is pristine in quality.  The movie has never looked better.  The work-in-progress version was fascinating to see as it was seen at the New York film festival of '91.  And the Special Edition adds so much without taking anything away from the original.  The extras are extraordinary.  The games are fun for everyone.  The behind the scenes features add detail to the pains taken in making both editons.  The inclusion of the Celine Dion/Peabo Bryson video is a nice touch.  However, did we really need a new teeny-bopper version of the title song?  My only complaint is that more could have been done with the Broadway stage production material.  Was it not possible for Mr. Eisner and the other big shots to include actual scenes from the show instead of only snap shots?

594917,5,6303142346,"Some thoughts on the Blu-ray (which I've just watched on a 60"" plasma)...

There have been Horrible Arguments here about ""Pinocchio"", as to which (if any) of the various transfers most-accurately reflects the way the film originally looked 70 years ago -- or for that matter, whether one would /want/ a video transfer that looked like the original. (There are valid arguments in favor of ""improvements"".) Oddly, this version of ""Beauty and the Beast"" unquestionably ""looks different"" from the way it looked in the theater, or previous DVD versions.

As is typical of many video transfers, there's a notable drop in contrast, which (combined with the high resolution) in this case makes subtleties of coloration and shading more-apparent. It also reduces the seeming ""crudity"" of some of the art and animation (""B&B"" is far from the best-drawn or best-animated Disney feature), especially in the beast's rendition.

One is also aware of changes in /lighting/. In the very opening, as Belle enters the village, we're aware that this is the ""magic hour"" of early morning (which gradually wears off as the sequence proceeds). I don't remember this from either the theatrical version or the DVD.

In short... For those reading this in 2060... The Blu-ray /does not/ look exactly like the theatrical version. It is significantly ""better"", and probably closer to what the artists intended.

This transfer is at 16:9, rather than the 1.85:1 of the previous DVD. This is an ""overscan"" of less than 7%, which isn't too bad. I would recommend viewing the film using your set's Dot-by-Dot setting.

I haven't yet watched all the supplemental material, but the feature about the making of the film is excellent.

This is such a handsome transfer that I have no hesitation recommending it, especially if you have a 50"" or larger display.

----------
There's no point in discussing the film itself, which made the People magazine list of 100 Greatest Films (winning over the Cocteau version after what was apparently a near-violent office fracas), other than to say it beats the Cocteau to a bloody pulp in every category (other than B&W cinematography!), and it's the only G-rated film with a song about homophobia. (It's interesting that the auteurs of both films were gay.)

Serious movie viewers will be a bit surprised at the changes. Disney has widened the format from 1.66 to 1.85 by selective cropping. Although this provides enhanced vertical resolution on monitors with variable vertical scan, some of the scenes become a bit claustrophobic.

ALL THREE versions have been reformatted to 1.85. This means the ""original theatrical version"" is _not_ the original. If you have the CAV LV, don't toss it.

The color rendition (as in the case of the platinum ""Snow White"") is noticeably different. In some cases it comes closer to the artist's intentions (eg, Belle's blue dress versus the earth tones of the town), while in others it's more garish.

The supplemental material is not up to that provided with ""Snow White."" Too much of it is typical ""Disney gush.""

Nevertheless... I've been going to the movies for over 50 years, and this is still one of the very best films I've seen. It demonstrated that a Disney film could treat its subject matter in a serious fashion, yet still be ""entertaining"" -- something that Disney himself was unable (or, more likely, didn't want) to achieve.

I don't mind telling you that watching this movie on October 8th brought me to tears, with all the emotion I felt in 1991 coming back like a wave.  The special features are very interesting (unlike some DVD's that you never even watch the special features).  I never knew so much went into an animated film.  It was particularly fun to watch the Disney Exec's talk about their feelings when the film was so widely accepted and praised. Do yourself and your kids a favor, and buy this DVD!!

594993,5,6303142346,"Since this is my 100th review I've written since I started doing this a couple years ago, I decided to choose to review a movie very near and dear to me. With the rerelease of ""Beauty and the Beast"" on DVD, it seems fitting and appropriate that this is the one I choose!
So many years ago, when Beauty and the Beast first was released, I hesitated going. After all, how could Disney possibly top its tremendous achievement with ""The Little Mermaid"". I ended up having to go, for the entire school where I was teaching at the time went. From the opening scene that takes us through the forest to the stained glass windows, I was totally awed.
If you don't know the story (who doesn't?), Belle is an intelligent, beautiful girl smart enough to know that what society deems her life to be isn't right for her. She yearns for something more out there, something she's only read about in her books.. She heroically saves her father from an unjust prison sentence by taking his place in the Beast's delapidated castle. There, through her honesty of heart, she sees through his gruff exterior, into his honest heart. The rest, as they say, is history.
Everything about this film worked back then, and it works just as magically now. The animation is crisp and daring. The songs simply spin powerfully and gently at the same time. The characters are real and realized, from the enchanted objects in the castle to the buffoon-turned-evil guy Gaston. The infamous ballroom scene, which 10 years so stunned me, still today stuns me, not for its techinical merit (after all, we've been exposed to Pixar's incredible work) but for its honesty and high emotional punch.
The DVD offers many treats for ""Beauty and the Beast"" fans. On disk A, they've offered three different versions of the movie: ""Special Edition"", ""Original Release"", and a ""Work in Progress"" version that mixed some animated parts with sketches and drawings. I particulary enjoyed the commentary done by the producers and song writer Alan Menken during the ""Special Edition"". Disk B comes with several interviews on making the movies, as well as games for the kids. It seems that Disney has struggled with making their DVD's worthy of the medium, but with this release, they've finally started to learn what they can do with it!
This is my third most favorite movie of all time. Perhaps it was the animation. Perhaps it was the music. Or perhaps it was being able to relate to the longing of a girl who wanted so much more for herself. Or even perhaps, it was the longing of the Beast, who only wanted something that he at first couldn't do himself; for someone to look beyond his appearance to see the beauty within. Perhaps they all work together, perfectly, in ""Beauty and the Beast"".",1034467200,,2741,4.700623700623701
594994,5,6303142346,"The wait was worth it for 'Beauty and the Beast' to make it's way to DVD. This has got to be the DVD with the best bonus features EVER! You start out with a highly in-depth look at the making of the film and the history of the story all hosted by the delightful Celine Dion. Celine also hosts a HIGHLY entertaining segment called ""The Story Behind The Story."" In this segment actors Angela Lansbury, Robby Benson, Jodi Benson, Ming-Na, James Earl Jones, Paige O'Hara and David Ogden Stiers relive the Disney versions and original stories of 'The Hunchback of Note Dame,' 'The Jungle Book,' 'Mulan,' 'The Lion King,' 'Cinderella, 'Sleeping Beauty' and 'Pocahontas.' The DVD also features the music video to the highly successful song ""Beauty and the Beast"" performed by Celine Dion and Peabo Bryson. For some unknown reason, Disney felt it necessary to include a newer version of the song performed by Jump 5. It's a crime that Disney wasted these talentless youngster's time to record a version of the song that in no way fits into the magic of this film. Celine and Peabo already recorded the song beautifully. Why did Disney hire people who can't sing a note to record the same song? The film itself has been fully resorted and the picture and sound quality has never been better. It even includes a new musical number ""Human Again"" which I could really do without. Many people like the song but I think it's poorly written and even more poorly performed. But it doesn't take anything away from this being one of the greatest films ever made. I'm really happy with what Disney has come up with this time. This ""Special Edition"" actually is special. I can only hope Disney continues with these ""Special Editions"" and bring us 'Aladdin,' 'The Little Mermaid,' and all the other Disney classics.

594996,5,6303142346,"The biggest flaw in this story ... is that it makes a 45-year-old man cry like a child every time I watch it.  My opinions on Disney movies vary -- some are good, some are almost unwatchable -- but ""Beauty and the Beast"" is the best work the studio has ever done.
Why do I love this movie so much?  I think it's the music.  In some musicals (animated or live), as soon as a song begins, the story comes to a grinding halt.  (Can anyone remember one tune from ""Mulan""?)  But in this film, the music by Ashman and Menken advances the story marvellously.  Animation and voice acting combine in a near-flawless performance, and the use of computer animation in the ballroom dance sequence was ground-breaking in its time.
As for the added features, the added song ""Human Again"" is a wonderful fun number.  I can understand why it was left out of the original version, but its inclusion really doesn't detract from the story (it's another big production number like ""Be Our Guest"", not really essential to the plot, but helps us get to know the supporting characters).
The ""making of"" features are fairly interesting; the on-disk games I can take or leave.  But the film itself is still the gem, worth the purchase price all by itself; the standard by which all other Disney movies are measured.",1034294400,,1290,4.578260869565217

It does not fit it as well as Disney would like you to believe. The animation for certain things is different (see through curtains, loads of animated nonsense, etc which are not present in such a strong way in the rest of the film). The animation is somewhat different, and ""characters"" added don't seem to fit in-- their faces are somewhat goofy/generic. 4/5 for the rest of everything else, but no 5/5.

594998,5,6303142346,"While this DVD falls short of the amazement that is last year's DVD release of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, my review will not concentrate on that. Also, this has something over Snow White: there are three presentations of the film. I will go over these and some of my favorite features in this review.
First, the three versions: Special Edition, Original Theatrical Release, and Work In Progress Edition.
The first version is the Special Edition, which was restored and remastered and re-shot with enhanced animation for IMAX and large-screen theaters with the ""Human Again"" sequence added in as well.
The second version is the original theatrical version. You know, the same film we've seen for the last 11 years. Perfect for those who think the Special Edition sucks.
The third, and possibly, my favorite version is the Work In Progress Edition. This was shown in October 1991 @ the New York Film Festival because they had requested a showing, yet the film was unfinished. There's a lot of scenes that are mostly or ALL in pencil animation, some parts are put together with storyboards, some with a mix of fully inked and painted animation, storyboard sketches, and/or rough/cleaned up pencil animation. It's really cool, you get to see some of the work involved in the creative process of the film. My only fault is that they added the finished score to it and replaced the colored scenes in the actual film with ones from the restored version. The score was not finished at the time, as is told in the ""A High-Profile Review"" featurette on Disc 2. I would have really liked to see it the way it was shown, dull colors, incomplete score, and all. But it's still satisfying.
Some of my favorite features on Disc 2 include the virtual galleries, which I was glad to see as those were my favorite features from the Snow White DVD. I also enjoyed all the trailers and TV spots and promotional galleries as well. Mrs. Potts Personality Test is a winner for all ages. *I got Lumiere.* I also enjoyed seeing the camera tests, Early Presentation Reel, the alternate version of Be Our Guest sung to Maurice instead of Belle, (And let's thank God they decided to go with Belle.) and the demo of Human Again set to storyboard sketches.
All in all, it may fall just a bit short of Snow White's amazement, but BATB still has a uniqueness of its own. It's still my favorite Disney movie of all time, and I love it now more than when I first saw it 10 years ago, as I now have a finer appreciation of the animated picture, everything that goes into it, the styles each film has, and the deeper meaning of the story. This DVD is a MUST have for any DVD collection, if only for the 3 versions of the film. I suggest you view all 3. Even if you HAVE the 1992 video release with the original theatrical version, I still suggest you see it in its newly restored glory, the Special Edition, also restored with the Human Again sequence, and the Work In Progress version for serious film buffs who like to see what kind of work goes into making a film.",1034294400,,3037,4.543795620437956
594999,5,6303142346,"You got me at the first song. Along with Aladdin, Beauty and The Beast stands as the pinnacle of Disney animation in the later part of the 20th century. Certainly Disney has produced many great and cherished films, but Beauty And The Beast managed to jump the animation ghetto and win respect from audiences and critics alike. Is it the best? It doesn't really matter what matters is that B&B can hold its own (and then some) with other Disney and other animation masterpieces.
The songs are rich, vibrant and as alive as the characters. In fact, they come alive in song much as the characters did during the golden age of the Hollywood musical. The animation is flawless and the story well constructed and without the artiface of other Disney films. As much as I like The Lion King (and I do like it alot!), B&B isn't as calculated as that film nor as topical as Aladdin (which is both a strong and weak point for that classic film--one of my Disney favs). I was never much of a fan of early Disney (although I recognize the value of those films) as I was raised on Warner Brother cartoons. Beauty And The Beast manages to meld the slapstick style of the Warner cartoons (much like Aladdin) with the storytelling wizardry of Disney.
The casting is perfect. I'm not much of a Robby Benson fan (I've always found him to be an annoying performer in films--too aware of himself and his ""talent"" to ever be lost in a role). In B&B Benson shines managing to lose himself in the role of the dark and brooding Beast. The female lead is just as captivating and powerful (I can't recall her name).
The DVD comes packed with extras some essential and some dispensable. The three different versions of B&B included aren't essential expect for collectors but it is fun to compare and contrast them. The added song and sequence isn't essential to the action (it's really more of a marketing ploy although it does add a freshness for those who've seen the film upteen times). Ashman's lyrics and Menken's music are witty and literate as well as fun to sing so this ""new"" song is a welcome addition.
A powerful mixture of pathos, drama, comedy and song Beauty And The Beast marked a new highwater mark for the Mouse Factory. It wasn't just churned out like many of the later animation features were at Disney.",1034208000,,2294,4.556900726392252

From the moment the DVD is ran on your DVD player, viewers are immediately brought back to their childhood days. The familiar Magic Kingdom wipes down in a fashion we have long become accustomed to. A commercial for Disney World was even snuck into Disc 2. While I am usually not a fan of commercials on DVDs, I found that this one in particular was appropriately included to remind us that Disney World is not just another tourist attraction, but a part of our generation.
But what makes this DVD so great? Is it the option of watching 3 different versions of the movie? Is it the bountiful option of games? It is actually a culmination of these. But the one thing that will mark this DVD as the milestone DVD of Disney movies to come is that it illustrates Disney in the past, present, and future on both discs.
On disc 1, viewers can watch the transformation of not only the Beast, but of the movie as well. Viewers can watch the movie in a pre-production format, the original theatrical release, and the featured Special Edition. On Disc 2, Disney goes down their familiar road of including previews for upcoming movies in addition to a wide selection of features for Beauty and the Beast. What will longed be remembered and viewed by owners of this DVD is the look back at past Disney classics such as Cinderella, the Lion King, and Pocahontas. The feature hosted by Celine Dion takes an in-depth look at the roots of Disney classics. This is a welcome treat by Disney to its customers that have been longing to own a look at history.
With the Lion King hitting IMAX theatres this winter, it is interesting to see where Disney will go with their DVD lineup. Indeed, this Special Edition will long be seen as a milestone in the Disney Home DVD lineup. It brings back the magic of classic animation unmatched by its CGI counterparts. A tale as old as time, so goes the magic of Disney and its classic animation movies.",1034035200,,2454,4.527027027027027

The Special Edition release on DVD is incredible.  It is a 2-disc set, and comes with a CD-ROM as well.  The box advertises a ""2-disc Experiential DVD.""  I don't know what experiential is, but the special features are awesome.  You can enter the Beast's castle, play games, and do all kinds of fun Disney stuff--sure to keep the kids entertained for hours.  There is also a very entertaining new song.

An Enchanting tale, catchy songs, magnificent scenes, and a whole line of lovable timeless characters. Also one of Disney's biggest box-office hits, Beauty and the Beast is loved by both children and adults. Just like ""Snow white and the 7 dwarfs"" it deserves to be in all-time great lists and just like ""The Lion King"" it deserves to be a top 10 Box-Office Hit! Thing is this feature is even better on Imax. Imagine a 3-D (almost Monsters Inc. type) Beauty and the Beast film. The whole saga is made to fall in love with. If you don't enjoy the story, you'll enjoy the songs at least. If you hate the songs you'll love the characters- and so on! It's like the classical Disney cartoons- funny but moving. It's sad but at the same time suspenseful. Beauty and the Beast is definitely one of my all-time favourite films. Boy can the singers sing! And the OST LP? Boy-just listen to Celine Dion's serene voice in the title track! Words fail me (in the good way). It's timeless- it's a perfect masterpiece. If you loved the Lion King, you'll love this. It's a treat to watch it again on the big screen! Even with all the computerized animated features collecting big bucks at the Box-office- Beauty and the Beast stands high above all others.
  The story revolves around a cold-hearted prince who refuses to help a fairy disguised as an old woman. As a result the fairy turns the prince into an ugly beast lost forever in his 'magical' castle where the rose petals count the days until he finally dies unless someone can fall in love with him as a beast. Then the story starts with Belle- a sweet lovable character that loves to read and sing. The film introduces all the characters as they show Belle's father arriving at the Beast's castle for help and Belle going on a 'mission' to save her dear old daddy. This isn't a spoiler so I won't tell you the rest! In short the main question is, can Belle actually fall in love in the ruthless Beast?
  It's worth the purchase because it's a magnificent musical, a spectacular show, it has comedic characters, and it's overall a fantastic feature!",1033171200,,2227,4.546134663341646
595076,5,6303142346,"This is the second best animated motion picture ever, second only the other Disney classic, Fantasia.  This is perfect for everyone who loves romance, adventure, excitement, drama comedy and just having a good time watching a movie.
The animation is beautiful, but then again, every Disney movie is.  The colors are vibrant and you just can't take your eyes off of the screen.
The voices are perfect.  Close your eyes and listen to Gaston and you can't help but imagine a big hairy hunter with a bad attitude and a chest the size of a football field.  Paige O'Hara is the only person I would ever want to hear as Belle.  She has a beautiful voice, so innocent yet so daring when she needs to be.  She has the most glorious singing voice.  Jerry Orbach and Angela Lansbury are cast so perfectly.  I mean, I can't think of any other word but perfect for the voice casting in this movie.  I would love to go into more detail, but I can't think of anything beside perfect.  Chip is called Chip and he has a chip taken out of his cup.  How much better can you get?
The music, oh, the music is glorious.  It begins with a song and you're hooked.  It is a sweeping chorus number, both great music and lyrics.  The movie is a book and each song highlights a chapter.  Robbie Benson, whew, what a voice.  ""Be Our Guest"" is a rousing crowd pleaser that'll have you tapping your toes and hitting the rewind button to listen to it again and again so you can learn the words for the next time you sing along.  Broadway staple Angela Lansbury shines when she sings ""Beauty And The Beast,"" far better than Celine Dion and that other guys version.
This movie teaches you how love conquers all and that if it's worth doing for love, then it's worth doing at all.  Don't give up on your dreams, but then the Beast lets Belle leave.  But he coes it because he loves her and he knows what she has to do.  Then she comes back because she loves him and they live happily ever after.
This is the best animated movie since Fantasia and every animated movie that follows is going to have a big shadow to crawl out of.  It was more than worthy of its Academy Award nomination and I'm not ashamed to say that it could have very well benn, and probably should have been, the upset winner of the year.  Alas, it wasn't.  But to no avail.  It's on Broadway and it has a glorious and long overdue deluxe edition coming out on DVD and you can take it to the bank, I'm buying this on the first day of release.
Buy this movie.  Let your kids watch it.  Watch it yourself.  Watch it with your kids.  This is a classic story and is told as beautifully as ever before.

595078,5,6303142346,"Beauty and the Beast is the best Disney film in awhile. In my opinion Disney is the best American animators but since this movie(with the exception of the Lion King of course)there has been a wave of horrid Disney movies(such as Lilo and Stich).  But this movie is really good.  It's simply mezmorizing.  It's beautiful and has the best music in a disney film.  It's dazzling and cute, beautiful and sad.  The story of the film is: A young girl named Belle, who thinks she knows everything she wants, goes on a magical adventure.  The prologue of the movie is, a greedy prince many years ago lived in a beautiful castle.  One day an old lady knocked on her door and asked if she could stay in the castle one day for the rose.  The prince turned it down and the old lady transformed herself into a beautiful women, transformed the prince into a beast, and said ""you must love someone and earn there love back before the pedals of the rose fall off, then the spell would be broken.  Now back to Belle, Her father got lost in the woods.  Belle went to find him and she saw a castle.  When she went in there she eventually met her father and mada an exchange.  She said if she would let her father free, she would stay there, thus begins the movie.
  The effects are wonderful.  Especially in this remastered version.  The animation is just plain and simpley BEAUTIFUL.  The music like I said is top notch, and this new version will have a brand new sog, Human again.  But fom the mesmorizing song Tale as old as time, well that song is not only beautiful but it has meanig and values like a nother poster said. Tale as old as time it means since Adam and Eve men have ruled our society.  Song as old as rhyme Barely even Friends then somebody bendss unexpectedly: that means love needs the two to make changes.  And finally Tale as old as time song as old as rhyme beauty and the beast.

Before this film's release, I was convinced that nothing could hold a candle to Disney's version of ""Sleeping Beauty."" And his production team virtually abandoned fairy stories from 1960 on, concentrating on a much more slapstick, comic avenue of films. But this movie mirrors everything that was in style with his classic fairy tales-- from a musical score as sophisticated as anything on the Broadway stage, to a stunning adaptation of the book (which enhances the will and affection of the heroine 100%), to graceful, genteel, and just plain beautiful animation. I remember being in the theater and hearing the ""oohs"" at the scene of Belle and the Beast in formal dress, as they dance to the title song (seen from the wonderful chandelier crane shot).

It was because I understood more and I truly believe that this is the best Disney Classic movie of all times (nominated for six Academy Awards).
We follow the tale of Belle, who lives in a quiet village in a normal life. But one day she goes looking for her lost father, an inventor on his way to a fair with his invention, and she finds herself in a large castle with a mysterious beast. She finds out that her father had wandered his way into the castle and she exchanges her freedom to free her father. Soon, we see the beast's love for her and romance sparkle between them as time passes, with a little help of the castle servants, who have become enchanted into house hold items. The beast was a prince who's cruelty and selfishness doomed him to become a beast until he can learn to love and earn the love back, but before a magical rose stored in his bedroom start to wilt and if it does totally, he would be doomed to be a beast for all time. But if succeeds the spell would be broken.
The characters are extremly well-thought of and they keep the movie alive. We have the bad guys, one by the name of Caston, the town buff and handsome who initially likes Belle, but his personality is cruel and selfish. We have his idiotic side-kick, LaFoo as well. All this is the normal type of characters he would see nowadays in a Disney cartoon.

This movie was incredible not only in the way that it captured a classic love story known throughout all ages and presented it in a way that appeals to the masses, but it also combined incredible animation techniques of simple pencil animation and state-of-the-art computer animation (which is shown in the infamous ballroom scene).
I feel that this film opened many doors in animation with the animation, the presentation of the story, and the music that moves and supplements the picture.

But then, one winter's night, an old beggar woman came to the castle and offered him a single rose in return for shelter from the bitter cold. Repulsed by her haggard appearance, the prince sneered at the gift and turned the old woman away, but she warned him not to be deceived by appearances, for beauty is found within. And when he dismissed her again, the old woman's ugliness melted away to reveal a beautiful enchantress. The prince tried to apologize, but it was too late, for she had seen that there was no love in his heart, and as punishment, she transformed him into a hideous beast, and placed a powerful spell on the castle, and all who lived there. Ashamed of his monstrous form, the beast concealed himself inside his castle, with a magic mirror as his only window to the outside world. The rose she had offered was truly an enchanted rose, which would bloom until his twenty-first year. If he could learn to love another, and earn her love in return by the time the last petal fell, then the spell would be broken. If not, he would be doomed to remain a beast for all time. As the years passed, he fell into despair, and lost all hope, for who could ever learn to love a beast..........
Disney's Beauty and The Beast is one of the best classics that Disney released in the 90's. It is the only animated movie in history to be nominated for an Oscar for Best Picture. It tells the story of Belle, the most beautiful girl in town, dreaming of something more. Belle loves her father, more than anything else in the world. When he gets in trouble, Belle goes to save him and trades her freedom to the Beast in exchange for her father's release, and in here starts the romantic relationship between Belle and The Beast. But Gaston, who has been thinking of marrying Belle has other plans for her...
It's wonderful to hear that Disney is releasing Beauty and the Beast as their second movie from their platinum edition series. The Dvd features countless hours of Bonus features, as that of the previously released "" Snow White and The Seven Dwarfs "" , including 3 Enchanted Versions Of Film, Special Edition, Original Theatrical Edition, Work In Progress Edition, Audio Commentary, Sing-Along Track, Character Galleries, The Broadway Musical, Trailers & TV Spots and much much more!!! The movie itself contains a never-before-seen musical sequence, which is worth buying for!
All in all, this dvd will be a wonderful addition to anyone's collection and if you don't have it, you're missing something.",1022284800,,2680,4.668076109936575
595227,5,6303142346,"Disney's animated version of the classic tale, ""Beauty and the Beast,"" is every bit as enchanting as the ""tale as old as time"" that it tells, making its way into our hearts as well as motion picture history. Being the first film nominated for an Academy Award for Best Picture, as well as six nominations altogether, Disney proves that it has what it takes to make an animated feature enjoyable for adults and children. I remember watching the film as a small child, and now, as an adult, is hasn't lost its luster, and everything is just as I enjoyed it before.
Through brilliant animation and song, as well as some terrific voice talents, the story of unexpected love comes to new and exciting life. Small-town girl Belle is forced to head into the woods once her father turns up missing, bringing her to a gloomy, secluded castle where she finds him and his captor, a vicious-looking beast. Of course, the beginning of the movie explains the beast's origins: he was once a selfish prince who, after turning out an old beggar woman, was transformed, given an enchanted rose, and told ""if he could learn to love another, and earn their love in return by the time the last petal fell, then the spell would be broken. If not, he would be doomed to remain a beast for all time.""
This begins their rocky-turned-romantic relationship, as they begin to warm to one another. Meanwhile, the town brute, Gaston, has plans of his own, involving some sinister maneuvers involving Belle's father in hopes that she will agree to marry him.
Many have hailed this as the best of Disney's films, and they wouldn't be wrong in saying so, either. It's easy to see why the movie has become such a success: there are elements at work in this film, just as in every other Disney film, only they seem to have taken on a small degree of maturity with this film's creation.
The animation is some of the best and most believable I've seen for an animated film in a long time. Most of the scenes involving solely characters is the same as most of Disney's works, but there are scenes of pure life-like reality that have a special flare to them. The ballroom scene is one such scene: the camera angles sweep across a room filled with high-arched glass windows and a chandelier which looks as real as the words you're reading on this page. Some nice effects go into the creation of the castle as well, especially in the end once everything returns to normal.
The is one of the most moving Disney soundtracks to come along since that of ""Cinderella"" and ""Pinocchio."" It is clear that composers were striving to capture the feeling and influence of their previous score for ""The Little Mermaid,"" and they truly succeed in doing so. The songs are delightful and will have kids and adults alike smiling and singing along. The score is the perfect underlining for scenes of romance as well as tension and suspense. In case you were wondering, three of the originally written songs were nominated for Academy Awards; that should say something.
This is one of Disney's most ambitious and successful projects, ranking alongside such cinematic achievements as the successes of ""Citizen Kane"" and ""Gone With The Wind."" Winner of the Golden Globe Award for Best Picture, as well as its Oscar nominations, ""Beauty and the Beast"" is a hallmark of a time when movies were something that everyone, young and old alike, could enjoy on the same levels.
Be my guest, and see this movie.",1018915200,,3441,4.670510708401977
595228,5,6303142346,"""Beauty and the Beast"" is truly one of the Disney studios finest moments.  As we all know, it is the only animated film nominated for a Best Picture Oscar more than ten years before the animated feature received its own category.  And now this classic finally comes to DVD.  It looks as though Disney is doing the right thing, packing this two disc set with extras and three (count them, three) versions of the film.  The original theatrical release will be on disc one as well as the recent IMAX re-release and the early rough cut of the film.  The IMAX release contains the added ""Human Again"" sequence that was animated especially for the tenth anniversary re-release of the film.  While the song was recorded when the film was originally in production, the animation was never completed.  The new sequence was animated especially for the re-release almost ten years after the original film was completed.  Disney spent an unprecedented amount of money restoring this film, cleaning up scenes and character heads that didn't translate well to the enormous IMAX format.  Other than the obvious musical sequence, the changes are pretty transparent.  Fans of the film might recognize some of the subtle, almost transparent alterations but most will go unnoticed.  The rough cut of the film is a nice addition.  This was the version of the film that was shown to test audiences months before the final film was released.  At the time, such a sneak peek was unheard of and somewhat pioneering.  The initial reaction to the film was more than positive from children and film critics alike.  This same rough cut was also released in the VHS Special Edition when the film originally debuted on video.  The rough cut does show some nice insights into the process of animating.  It alternates between black and white sketches, clean line drawings, painted stills and finished animation.  The jumps are a little jarring at first.  It's more for obsessive fans and students of animation than the average movie watcher.  But I applaud Disney for releasing it with this special edition.  The rest of the extras on disc two are more of the same stuff Disney has been doing to beef up their DVD releases.  The sing-alongs, akward and slow ""games"", and their usual run of the mill Making of series are included.  At times, these bits and piece offer an interesting glimpse into the Disney process but more often than not they simply review the same ""process of animation"" reel that they did back when Walt was still around.  Hopefully, Disney will soon tire of these same old fillers and develop something truly pioneering for the DVD format.  The same savy they showed with the Snow White DVD, an impressive archive of the films history, should be spread out to their other classics as they become available on the DVD market.  Part of me thinks they're holding back so they have something else to add when they start releasing second generations of these DVDs as they did with Peter Pan earlier this year.  Either way, this Beauty and the Beast edition is well worth the purchase even if the extras are not.  Let's keep our fingers crossed for Aladdin and The Lion King.",1018569600,,3158,4.787430683918669

Belle has to be the most courageous Disney heroine out there. It's not until the Beast saves her from the wolves does Belle begin to start a friendship with him. And, she doesn't realize her love for the Beast until the end of the film. So, how could she possibly love the Beast to change him? The Beast changing himself in order for Belle to love him is more accurate. If I had a daughter, I would be proud if she patterened her life after Belle. She's a devoted and loving daughter to her father, she loves to read, she is independant, strong, brave and intelligent.

595318,5,6303142346,"Widely regarded as a modern-day classic, Beauty and the Beast boasts action, danger, romance comedy, and fantastic musical numbers. It's also the only ""cartoon"" to be nominated for the best-picture Oscar.
The film takes place in an animated France (and when aren't the
French animated?) and opens with the introduction of ""Belle"", the beauty who loves reading so much that she fails to notice most everything around her, including the advances of boorish stud, Gaston.
One day, Belle's father, a crackpot inventor, ventures out into a strange forest and encounters a cursed castle. When he is taken prisoner by the castle's beastly inhabitant, Belle must come to his rescue.
First and foremost, Beauty and the Beast proves that not all cartoons are for kids. In many ways, the characters in Beauty and the Beast are more real than other films with flesh and blood actors. In fact, most actors would kill for roles like these.
My personal favorite of the film's many great characters is Gaston, the best Disney villain of all time, a conceited buffoon and deadly enemy. Gaston's theme song is one of the funniest scenes from any film -- probably ever. ""No one's slick as Gaston/No one's quick as Gaston/No one's neck is incredibly thick as Gaston,"" sing the boozers at the local watering hole to Gaston, who proudly displays his antler collection and chest hair.
Where other films pander to select audiences, Beauty and the Beast truly has something for everyone.",1011916800,,1462,4.9714285714285715

This DVD [is] a Platinum Edition like the ""Snow White And The Seven Dwarfs"" DVD ...and you must pick that one up as well. It is a must just like this DVD ... The DVD will have tons and tons of bonus features like Snow White. Behind the sense, deleted parts in the movie, a game to play, interviews with the voices behind the characters, and much more...I really love this movie so much! It is for kids, teens, and adults (Like Me.) ...Disney has added an addition sequence to this film. This is the only Disney movie where the original animators went back into every scene to make it crisp and clear and added an additional scene. You can see the Movie in three different versions on ONE DVD! ... This will be going down in Walt Disney history! ENJOY!",1006387200,,997,4.394594594594595
595320,5,6303142346,"Jeez I hate to waste my opportunity to review this movie right now but the purpose of these reviews is to be helpful. The most helpful thing I can happily contribute is Disney is releasing Beauty and the Beast on DVD next year and plans to release each subsequent film on a one per year basis. That means Aladdin probably won't be available for two years and Lion King for three. Its very frustrating to have to wait this long for these titles and hopefully public pressure will encourage them to accelerate the pace of the release.  As far as the new Beauty and the Beast disc goes I believe you can expect to see some of the following supplements. Addition of the deleted song ""Be Human Again"" sung by the enchanted objects in the house after Belle arrives and they begin to have hope the curse will be broken...(This will not be added to the film itself) Pencil animated version of 'Be Our Guest"" where the song is sung to Maurice instead of Belle. Belle was swapped in to make the story flow better. Television promotional featurette for the film with interviews with Angela Lansbury Paige O'Hara and other cast members as well as animators Glenn Keane Will Finn and others. I suspect there will be a commentary, concept sketches and storyboard images.  I am one of the few people to have seen this but I would love it if they would include as a hidden easter egg a joke animation from ""Gaston.""  When Gaston sings....and every last inch of me's covered with hair"" he pulls open his shirt and instead of the hairy chest is a pair of flouncy bosoms in a bra with tassels. I wouldn't count on that one.  Depending if they want to release a two disc version at the same or different price you might also get Beauty and the Beast the Work in Progress reel.  Which is another full version of the film in an unfinished state shown in a limited pre-screening. Inserted throughout the film where it was not yet completed are either rough, cleanup pencil or storyboard sketches to fill in the gaps. Its a fascinating way to see the animation process in its various stages.  As the disc is not finalized yet I can not say for one hundred percent sure what will be included. If it is like the new Snow White DVD there could be a heck of a lot more. I would not expect to see the DVD until next Summer at the very earliest and probably not 'til winter. I know many of you are wondering when? when? when? so I am sacrificing my opportunity to review one of my favorite films to let you know.",1002585600,,2482,4.3847826086956525
595321,5,6303142346,"Disney's animated version of the classic tale, ""Beauty and the Beast,"" is every bit as enchanting as the ""tale as old as time"" that it tells, making its way into our hearts as well as motion picture history. Being the first film nominated for an Academy Award for Best Picture, as well as six nominations altogether, Disney proves that it has what it takes to make an animated feature enjoyable for adults and children. I remember watching the film as a small child, and now, as an adult, is hasn't lost its luster, and everything is just as I enjoyed it before.
Through brilliant animation and song, as well as some terrific voice talents, the story of unexpected love comes to new and exciting life. Small-town girl Belle is forced to head into the woods once her father turns up missing, bringing her to a gloomy, secluded castle where she finds him and his captor, a vicious-looking beast. Of course, the beginning of the movie explains the beast's origins: he was once a selfish prince who, after turning out an old beggar woman, was transformed, given an enchanted rose, and told ""if he could learn to love another, and earn their love in return by the time the last petal fell, then the spell would be broken. If not, he would be doomed to remain a beast for all time.""
This begins their rocky-turned-romantic relationship, as they begin to warm to one another. Meanwhile, the town brute, Gaston, has plans of his own, involving some sinister maneuvers involving Belle's father in hopes that she will agree to marry him.
Many have hailed this as the best of Disney's films, and they wouldn't be wrong in saying so, either. It's easy to see why the movie has become such a success: there are elements at work in this film, just as in every other Disney film, only they seem to have taken on a small degree of maturity with this film's creation.
The animation is some of the best and most believable I've seen for an animated film in a long time. Most of the scenes involving solely characters is the same as most of Disney's works, but there are scenes of pure life-like reality that have a special flare to them. The ballroom scene is one such scene: the camera angles sweep across a room filled with high-arched glass windows and a chandelier which looks as real as the words you're reading on this page. Some nice effects go into the creation of the castle as well, especially in the end once everything returns to normal.
The is one of the most moving Disney soundtracks to come along since that of ""Cinderella"" and ""Pinocchio."" It is clear that composers were striving to capture the feeling and influence of their previous score for ""The Little Mermaid,"" and they truly succeed in doing so. The songs are delightful and will have kids and adults alike smiling and singing along. The score is the perfect underlining for scenes of romance as well as tension and suspense. In case you were wondering, three of the originally written songs were nominated for Academy Awards; that should say something.
This is one of Disney's most ambitious and successful projects, ranking alongside such cinematic achievements as the successes of ""Citizen Kane"" and ""Gone With The Wind."" Winner of the Golden Globe Award for Best Picture, as well as its Oscar nominations, ""Beauty and the Beast"" is a hallmark of a time when movies were something that everyone, young and old alike, could enjoy on the same levels. This is the best picture of 1991.",989280000,,3442,4.672158154859967

What a wonderful, beautiful, romantic film, punctuated by great  animation, and knock-em-dead musical numbers. No wonder this was the first  animated film nominated for a Best Picture Oscar!
Not many animated films  qualify as date movies, but this one is a date flick extraordinaire.
If  ""Beauty and the Beast"" has a flaw, it's that it can be quite  violent for children. It includes a rather violent fistfight to the death,  a knifing, and quite a bit of gunplay to boot. Thankfully, it's easy to see  the scary stuff coming, so you can have your kids turn away before they see  something they shouldn't.

595438,5,6303142346,"In the late 1980's, the Disney animated feature came back with the  wonderful ""The Little Mermaid"". It was followed by ""Beauty  and the Beast"", an even better film. I think that no animated Disney  film that has been released since then is on par with this one.
For many  people, animated movies are still kid movies. Disney proved that this is  false. The characters in ""Beauty and the Beast"" are  three-dimensional (with the exception of the comic relief Lefou) and the  picture is very often immensely dramatic. The songs, which became more and  more wearing in the following pictures, fit wonderfully in ""Beauty and  the Beast"" and the images, like the enchanted castle, are  striking.
I cannot think of many films of the 1990's that reach (or even  come close) to ""Beauty and the Beast's"" sense of wonder and  magic. This is truly a film that Disney will long be proud of and that has  earned the term ""classic"" that the sudio automatically aplies to  all its films.",958608000,,971,4.7023809523809526

It begins with a prologue magically  told through the use of stain-glassed windows.  The main plot involves an  odd, but beautiful small-town girl (Belle) who wants to escape her drab  existence, to only find her wish come true by being imprisoned by the Beast  in a nearby enchanted castle.  However, the most intriguing character is  the boastful and arrogant Gaston, who is willing to do anything to gain  what he cannot have -- Belle.

I've always been a fan of the animated works of Disney, and what they have  accomplished in this movie, is just great. Nicely animated, blended in with  some really nice computer generated scenery. The story itself is a real  good ""old"" one. The nonchalant prince blows away an old lady at  the castle gate. And that was a big mistake. Because what the prince didn't  know, was that this old woman was a vicious witch. After being treated the  way she was, she puts a curse on the prince, and his castle, making him  into a beast, and all of his staff into furniture and other household  items. And this curse has a set time limit. If the prince is unable to find  the love of his life, he risks being trapped inside the body of the beast  for the rest of his life.
