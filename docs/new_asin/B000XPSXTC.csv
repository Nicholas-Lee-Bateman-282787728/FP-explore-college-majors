8229125,5,B000XPSXTC,"Upon watching this film I was immediately moved by how open and honest these young women were in regards to sharing their emotions, intimate stories, worries and joys.  Having been a teenage girl myself I remember experiencing many of these same feelings but never wanting to talk about them.  This film serves as a powerful reminder of just how important it is to create an open and ongoing dialogue with our children.  I look forward to watching it with my own daughter as she approaches the teenage years.",1206576000,,508,4.75
8229126,5,B000XPSXTC,"I watched this film with my 14 year old daughter, and it was sobering for us both to look into the lives of girls who are dealing with some very difficult issues.  While the girls were faced with some particularly challenging issues, in general they were navigating emotions, insecurities and developmental landmarks that are universal for all young women. We both loved how beautifully this documentary was created.  The still photographs mixed with voices in the background were especially engaging.  We enjoyed getting to know the girls, and watching them grow strong and we were both moved to tears by the songs and poem at the end.  I highly recommend this film and congratulate filmmaker Brijetta Hall on the her ability to elicit such open and honest reflections on life from her subjects, and her artistry in introducing them to us.",1203206400,3,840,4.9361702127659575
8229127,5,B000XPSXTC,"Lifting the veil on those most turbulent years, In My Room probes the stories of three young women in their mid-teens.  Each is distinct, each different, but they're all travelling that road to adulthood and thus have much in common.  This is a beautiful, lyrical film which never imposes a voice on its subjects.  We come to know and love these girls for the strong individuals they are, and for the compelling stories they tell.  Not to be missed.",1201046400,,449,4.6455696202531644
8229128,5,B000XPSXTC,"Having been a female teenager myself 20 years ago, I was transported instantly back to that time in my life; feeling the hurricane of emotions that challenged me and made me who I am today.  What an incredible magnifying glass over the years from 13 to 16 this film hands the viewer.  Being allowed to see these three young women as they tell us their stories in raw, intimate detail is a view which the filmaker and her team managed to capture with sublime tenderness.  I am a mother of a two-year old and I am sharing this dvd with all of my friends who are parents.  By reminding us what it was like to be on the precipice of adulthood, it serves as a tangible tool for helping our little ones through each of thier developmental stages and thier struggles to become the best we can allow them to be at every step.
  I applaud the young women in the film for thier courage and I need to add that I learned some about myself from each of them. Ana said ""you are all my sisters. You girl,chick, mommy, slut, bitch, whore, princess, diva. . . you are all my sisters.""  How proud I am to be part of that sisterhood, as we are all part of this sisterhood; struggles and wisdom alike.",1201046400,,1181,4.245535714285714
8229129,5,B000XPSXTC,"this poignant and probing documentary provides a unique look into the lives of three average american adolescents. it is fascinating to be reminded of the seemingly unimportant issues--as viewed from an adult perspective--that dominate the lives of teenagers. ms hall has produced a remarkably focused insite into the hopes, aspirations and at times despair of girls transitioning through the most difficult stage of human development. i doubt she could have achieved such honesty and openness from boys of the same age. i highly recommend this documentary to parents, educators and anyone else who is in close contact with girls coming of age. but most of all i recommend this work to all girls of similar age if no other reason then to know that they are not alone.",1200355200,2,767,5.0
8229130,5,B000XPSXTC,"This film is a remarkably honest and compelling journey into the minds and lives of teenage girls.  It'll stay with you forever. It's beautiful, poignant and memorable.  Anyone who has, knows or is a teenage girl should see this film.",1193356800,4,234,4.825
8229131,5,B000XPSXTC,"In a culture that would rather photograph adolescent girls than listen to them, In My Room is refreshing and revelatory.  Against the backdrop of Brijetta Hall's quiet artistry, three voices emerge with startling authenticity, giving a rare view into the interior lives of girls. This film should be mandatory viewing for all high school teachers - and, while I'm at it, parents, too.

8229132,5,B000XPSXTC,"Focusing intently, and poetically, on three very different adolescent girls, In My Room is a poignant and intensely personal portrayal of the challenges and triumphs of growing up female in suburban America.  The filmmaker, Brijetta Hall, asked these teenagers to talk about their experiences of home, school, peers, and coming of age while situated in their own bedrooms.  Hall's rendering of their reflections is respectful, revealing, disconcerting, and honestly exhilarating, because the girls present themselves as motivated, intelligent, confused, imperfect, complex, changing, and thus genuinely ""real.""  If you are ready to listen to, learn from, and understand some teenage girls, see this film.
