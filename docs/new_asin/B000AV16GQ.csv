8079875,5,B000AV16GQ,"When, OH WHEN, will this long lost 1967 French film from director Claude Lelouch have a region 1 dvd
release with the original French dialogue with ENGLISH subtitles, and in the proper widescreen format?
I have waited and wondered for this longer than I can remember.  I have the gorgeous soundtrack by
legendary French composer Francis Lai (who did several movie scores for Lelouch, including the smash
hit ""A Man And A Woman"") in both vinyl and cd formats.  I even had a friend download and fabricate a
dvd copy for me after I got tired of waiting for it to be officially released, which STILL hasn't occurred
yet. Starring Yves Montand as a married journalist,(who can't keep his zipper closed very long), Annie
Girardot, and an absolutely RAVISHING young Candice Bergen as a visiting fashion model in Paris who
falls hard for Montand's charming character.  For me, the thing that makes this film SO stunning is the
way the fabulous music by Lai is matched with the frequent silent scenes of the 3 main characters &
their dramatic & romantic roles. Lelouch is an absolute MASTER at this - ""A Man And A Woman"" is but
another classic example of his brilliant style that uses sweeping images and scenes tied with beautiful
music.  Warner Brothers Archive Collection recently released ""A Man And A Woman: 20 Years Later"" on
dvd (with English subtitles also directed by Lelouch, but, for me, it's not as good as the original movie)
after being available only on VHS many years ago. Hopefully, the same thing will happen with ""Live For
Life"" soon (the original ""A Man And A Woman"" was finally released on region 1 dvd with English subtitles
several years ago after only being available in a HORRIBLE English dubbed VHS version). ""Live For Life""
IS available in several European dvd PAL formats, but with NO English subtitles. This classic film needs
a proper region 1 release for its many fans who want this.  Candice Bergen & the music ALONE is worth
it --  it's a French cinematic masterpiece that was nominated for Best Foreign Language Film. Bravo to
director Claude Lelouch & composer Francis Lai for ""Live For Life"" - a hauntingly beautiful time capsule
from a long-gone era (the same can be said for ""A Man And A Woman"", which, incredibly, was made by
Lelouch when he was ONLY 29 years old - ""Live for Life"" came out one year later). Sophisticated work
and art from two masters of the genre - Lelouch and Lai. They don't make them like this anymore.

Update: I located a French PAL region 2 dvd copy of ""Live For Life"" on
AmazonFrance a few months back - still no English subtitles, but there is
a great documentary (in English!) on the making of ""Live for Life"" in the
special features section, along with several other items, including an in-
terview with LeLouch (in French). Again, since it's a PAL region 2 import
dvd, you will need an all-region dvd player to watch it.  I've had one for
many years now, and it works great. I obtained the dvd from an online
French dealer called MovieShow for around $40 - worth every cent.

P.S.  Watch for the scene towards the end when Candice Bergen rides a
white horse in a New York City park by herself.  I've NEVER seen a horse
do THAT in ANY major motion picture release!",1301011200,7,3222,4.605584642233857
