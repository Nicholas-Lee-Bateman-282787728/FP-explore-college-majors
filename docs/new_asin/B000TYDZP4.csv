2911236,5,B000TYDZP4,Excellent video and excellent service.  Some of the best flying you'll ever see with wonderful shots from aircraft to aircraft.  A must have if you're an aviation fan.,1258588800,,167,4.928571428571429
2911237,5,B000TYDZP4,"i was flight instructing in the 70's when i first saw a 16mm print of this movie at one of our periodic hangar parties. i was hooked. i bought a vhs copy as soon as it became available in the early 80's and virtually wore it out over the years. it finally became unplayable and i could not find another one. i had searched for a possible dvd copy for a few years and now it's here.

regarding harley hall, i was at the air show in cleveland a couple of weeks ago. as my wife and i got off the hotel van and approached the front gate at burke lakefront airport, i saw 2 f-4's guarding the entrance, one painted in thunderbird colors and one in the blues. i started telling my wife the story of ""threshold"" and how blue angel number 1, harley hall, returned to the fleet after the movie was shot and became one of the last naval aviators shot down and lost forever in the vietnam war. as i got closer to the blue angel sentry overlooking the gate i glanced up and saw harley hall's name under the canopy. i am 55 years old now, have been a major airline pilot for over 30 years--and was overcome with emotion i haven't felt in years. the thunderbirds, the blues, harley hall, and the rest of the men and women watching over us are the best of what we are as americans. may god bless them all.",1252800000,10,1290,4.139442231075697
2911238,3,B000TYDZP4,"Just received this DVD from ThresholdBlu.....com, is there no menu on this DVD?
I put it in player and it just started playing. I understand it is from an older VHS version. Picture quality is only average but the narration is great.",1246492800,2,233,4.571428571428571
2911239,5,B000TYDZP4,Very glad to see that Threshold has been transferred to DVD.  Enjoyed it thoroughly after all these years.  This is a wonderful DVD for those in the Blue Angels and their training.,1238630400,,180,4.59375
2911240,5,B000TYDZP4,"This was  my favorite aviation documentary for decades, kept my full length VHS pristine since I bought it all those years ago.  Ordered this as soon as I saw it was available, I'm anxiously waiting for the DVD to arrive.  Only question I have, at one point in Amazon's description it says this is Region Free, and elsewhere it says Region 1.  Which is right?

It might finally have been surpassed, check out Speed and Angels, also available from Amazon:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Speed-and-Angels-w-game/dp/B001B187CU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Speed and Angels (w/game)</a>.  Still, if you love aviation and/or the Blue Angels, you Really MUST get this!

UPDATE:  this movie is as good as I remember.  However, there has been no remastering done.  I's the straight movie, no special fetures, not even chapters.  The video quality is about what you'd expect from a decent VHS tape.  Probably the people who made it possible to be on DVD knew that it would not be a giant seller and worked with the budget they had.  Still, this movie is DEFINITELY worth the money!  If you like the Blue Angels you Need to get this while it's available.

Amazon no longer sells this directly, but one of the sellers they list is actually the producer of the DVD itself, and appears to be a relative of the person who originally made the documentary.  Highly Recommended!",1223856000,4,1403,5.168888888888889
2911241,5,B000TYDZP4,"I watched this video over and over on VHS when I was young, but I had not seen the movie in years, I got my copy in the mail yesterday, and I've watched it twice already. Simply perfect! Tons of awesome flying, great narration, and while the soundtrack is straight out of the 70's, I enjoyed the music. Like one of the other reviewers said, it doesn't get much better then watching the Blue Angels flying F-4's.

Added note: The Boss (Blue Angel 1) Harley Hall was shot down over Vietnam after he left the Blue Angels, and ended up being the one of the last pilots to be shot down in that conflict. More information is here: [...]",1219708800,3,630,4.294117647058823
2911242,5,B000TYDZP4,"I am overjoyed to see this film finally make it to DVD. I have copies of it from its first release in Beta through the short lived 60 minute version NavAir Films had out years ago. I knew most of those guys and the stories they could tell. The Phantom was the last of the fast heavy iron birds designed in the 50's that proved you could do anything if you had a big enough engine. The old school aerodynamic design had more than a few coffin corners that guaranteed very creative departures from controlled flight in the blink of an eye to those who did not respect her limits and this film  showed the best of the best pilots making precision flying look easy in this bird. Until the invention of high speed camera mounts for IMAX, this was always the best film I had ever seen to give non flyers the chance of knowing what it was like to strap on a high performance jet and go blasting around the sky. I do miss the days when Uncle Sugar let me play with the best toys in the world.",1205625600,5,984,4.151832460732984
2911243,5,B000TYDZP4,"As a former Phantom Driver I must say that this is some of the best footage you'll see.  My VHS version is just about worn out.  The music and the style are very 70's and a little corny but you can't beat the visuals.  While any aviation enthusiast will enjoy it, only someone who's flown it will really appreciate it.  Two flight glove clad thumbs up!",1204934400,3,352,4.287878787878788
2911244,5,B000TYDZP4,"Outstanding quality (considering the age of the orginal print).  If you have seen Threshold, you know you MUST buy this.  If you like aviation, you will love this movie.  The Blue Angels flying F-4s.  It just does not get any better than that....",1189036800,7,246,4.651162790697675
2911285,5,B000TYDZP4,Thank you for this fabulous video. There was parts in this movie that brought back memories of how to be a fantastic pilot.,1390694400,,123,4.391304347826087
2911286,5,B000TYDZP4,"I received the VHS for my 17th birthday back in 1977 along with the first VHS player for our family. I was a young pilot earning his ratings with dreams of being an airline pilot someday. Im now 51 and a senior Captain and Check Airman with a major US Carrier but when I was hired at age 23, was I ever shocked to learn that the person who would give my first checkride was non other than Steve Shoemaker (Solo Pilot of Blue Angel #6 in Threshold).

Needless to say I was delighted to find this on DVD as my old VHS tape is pretty much worn out.",1385251200,,545,4.0
2911287,5,B000TYDZP4,"we ride in honor of Harley H. Hall,,,he was the last tailhook to get shot down over vietnam,,,to this day we don't where Harley is,,,he was the # 1 plane for some years with the blue angels,,,,,,the dvd is so cool,,,this is a must have,,,",1379462400,,238,4.311111111111111
2911288,5,B000TYDZP4,"This was a video I watched growing-up and just bought the DVD, it is not very often in life that something is better than you remember, but this DVD qualifies.  The F-4 Phantom and the Blue Angels were an amazing combination and the movie is very well done, great commentary, nice - easy listening 1970s music to match - highly recommended !",1352419200,,341,4.5
2911289,5,B000TYDZP4,"This is the single, best, most touching movie ever made on the Blue Angels, or on any flight demonstration team for that matter. Paul Marlow and David Gardner are film visionaries who produced a film way ahead of its time - external air-to-air footage, real time inflight cockpit radio transmissions, video coverage of the Blue Angel pilots in their cockpits as they performed high G maneuvers, including the legendary Blue Angels Boss Harley Hall and Blue Angels Skip Umstead, Ernie Christensen, Jim Maslowski, Burner Beardsley,  Bill Switzer, JD Davis and Kevin O'Mara- it can never get any better. Here in this movie you will see the devotion of the Blue Angels crews as they maintained their aircraft. I have seen this film hundreds of times literally and each time I learn something new from it. It compelled me so much that I had to write a book on the entire F-4 Phantom Blue Angels era called ""Phantoms and Angels."" I spent a whole year interviewing the officers and enlisted crews for my book and this movie was my source of inspiration.  Now if a film is so moving it induces you to spend one whole year writing a book, that is a film like no other!  Buy this DVD and you will not regret it!",1320796800,3,1201,4.576744186046511
2911290,5,B000TYDZP4,"I was slightly reluctant to pay the advertised price for this DVD, but having seen it, I'm glad that I did. When I first saw the Blue Angels, they were in F-11F Tigers, in the mid-1960's; these were attractive aerobatic mounts, and though I was quite young, I certainly enjoyed the performance. I later saw them in two shows, I believe, while they had the F-4J Phantom; THESE WERE THEIR ULTIMATE MOUNTS!! When four, or all six F-4's kicked-in full afterburner, in a steep climb, or loop, you not only saw them, and heard them, YOU FELT THEM (your ridcage vibrated), lending an added dimension unique to the Phantom. The F-18 Hornets which they've now had for awhile are quite good, and vastly better than the A-4 Skyhawks the team was disgraced with during the 1970's, when their F-4's were stupidly confiscated, but the F-18 can't equal, let alone overshadow, the F-4J Phantom. If they'd been given F-14 Tomcats, THAT might have done it, but these have been unwisely retired, prematurely. Remember that part of the intent behind creation of both the Thunderbirds and Blue Angels was to showcase not only the skills of highly-trained pilots, but frontline fighters of the respective services, as well. That idea suffered badly when the Blues were demoted to the A-4, and the Thunderbirds to the T-38. This feature is priceless, in my opinion, as it preserves an important insight into the chapter of history when they had the F-4 Phantom. Also worthwhile are scenes showing the team marching out to their aircraft, prior to a performance, something most of us NEVER SEE. Credit is also given to those who work long, hard hours to maintain the team's aircraft, another aspect most of us are unaware of. Perhaps the only thing missing is mention of the fact that the C-130 which is the Blue Angels' support aircraft (known as ""Fat Albert""), is crewed by Marines, not Navy personnel. Since the Marines do not have their own precision flying demonstration team, this is important. You also get some insight into the considerable amount of time, effort, and study which goes into team performances. All things considered, I'd highly recommend this DVD to anyone with any real interest in the Blue Angels, and/or the F-4 Phantom...",1310169600,5,2225,4.8578947368421055
2911291,5,B000TYDZP4,"Overall, I guess the best word I can use to describe my feeling about this DVD is 'disappointed'.  I'm giving it 5 stars, but that's in spite of the execution of this DVD release and based on the strength of the movie itself.

To start with, the film itself is phenomenal.  This has been a favorite of mine for many years, and was inspirational to me as a kid for my pursuit of flying fighters for the military.  Although it suffers from a cheesy 70s soundtrack and narration that is tough to take seriously (I'm always waiting for Leslie Nielsen to add ""And don't call me Shirley"" at any given time), the photography is outstanding and the overall narrative storyline is excellent.  Absolutely one of the best documentaries ever made about flying.

I own a VHS copy of the movie purchased after having watched a high-generation bootleg copy that I obtained from somewhere in the mid 80s.  With the advent of DVDs and the proliferation of widescreen and HDTV, I have long wished that a DVD of Threshold would be released.  Although the DVD was apparently released for sale in 2004, I just found out about it in 2008 (and am adding this review in 2011!).  It is being distributed by David Marlow, the son of the film's director Paul Marlow.

I was VERY eager to add this to my collection, but was disappointed with the IMHO below average execution of the DVD.

First, the movie itself.  It is a standard 4:3 aspect ratio presentation (a.k.a. ""full screen"").  Though it would be GREAT in this era of 16:9 tvs to have a widescreen version, it appears the original film is in the 4:3 format as it's presented on the DVD.  On the website that sells the DVD ([...]) there is a gallery that appears to show scans of single-frame stills from the movie (you can see the black spots in the corners).  So, guess we're out of luck there.

The film transfer itself is, unfortunately, just average.  Most significantly, there are dust, specks, scratches, etc all over the print used.  In 1989 or so the movie was re-released on VHS, with the claim that it had been ""remastered"" or something, so I guess I was hoping that the film print used for the DVD transfer would be nice and clean.  Who knows where the master print is or what the quality is after 30+ years in the can, but it would have been nice to have a DVD transfer from the master that was carefully digitized, color-corrected, etc.  Certainly there are major theatrical releases from 1974 that look very good in their DVD transfer, so there's no reason why there couldn't be a good quality print somewhere.

I did not see any significant digital artifacts in the transfer itself.  The picture looks a little fuzzy on my 40"" LCD; my gut instinct was to say that the DVD was a result of a VHS-to-DVD transfer (with predictable loss of resolution/fidelity), but upon reflection the original film may look this way, too.

For the DVD itself, it has only the movie and no extras.  In fact, it doesn't even have a menu -- you pop in the DVD and it immediately starts playing the movie.  My biggest criticism is that there have been some tweaks to the soundtrack.  Steve Shoemaker's comment after the dirty loop, ""That was very interesting boss, I just got down to 40 knots on the top of that son of a bitch"" has had the ""bitch"" part bleeped out with what sounds like some fake radio feedback (which definitely wasn't there on the VHS edition).  There is some heavy breathing during the shots of the pilots' faces while they're performing maneuvers that I also don't recall from the previous release, which certainly isn't ""original"" based on the fact that they're wearing boom mics on the helmet.

Regardless, my disappointment here should not deter anyone from buying this DVD.  This is a superb film that every aviator should have in their collection.",1297468800,7,3795,4.589020771513353
2911292,5,B000TYDZP4,"This film contains some of the most impressive in-flight footage you will ever see, past or present.  Excellent insight into the team of the era through interviews and radio comm chatter.  I am a life-long Blue Angel fan and I've been attending their airshows for over 20 years, but that means I've only ever see them fly the Hornets.  This film gives me a window into the Blues from before my time and I realize I missed a helluva lot.  I have a large collection of airshow videos, including ""View from the Cockpit"" (a shortened version of ""Threshold"") and this one is a real gem.  I'm so glad to find it here on DVD.  If you know enough to find this page, then you shouldn't hesistate at all to buy this film.

**Note: Despite the ""G"" rating, there is, I'd say, an appropriate amount of language used by the pilots.  Also, there is a brief clip of an on-screen mishap that resulted in the death of Lt. Larry Watters.",1282694400,2,918,4.390532544378698
2911293,4,B000TYDZP4,"This has always been one of the ""classic"" aviation films and it is nice to finally have it on DVD.  The story, narration, interviews and cinematography are all excellent.  (Leslie Nielsen is the narrator).  It was filmed during the 1971 airshow season and covers all the bases.  That being said, the video is quite poor.  The picture is very grainy and the colors are not at all vivid or crisp.  It appears that it is simply a straight transfer from a VHS tape.  Too bad the effort was not made to make an HD transfer from an original 16mm film copy...",1282348800,,552,4.405940594059406
2911294,5,B000TYDZP4,"A superb video of the Blue Angels in action. A bit dated by now, made near the end of the Viet Nam war, but still head and shoulders above the others of its kind. Highly recommended.",1265846400,,182,4.083333333333333
8211409,5,B000TYDZP4,One of the best aviation documentaries I have ever seen,1483315200,,55,4.6
8211410,5,B000TYDZP4,"Yes. The video filmed during their air demonstrations in the 1970's met my expectations and beyond.
One of their shows was filmed in my home town, the city of Quito in Ecuador. It is very exciting to see the Blue Angels doing their maneuvers above our city in those old days.",1482192000,,275,4.411764705882353
8211411,5,B000TYDZP4,Great stuff - brings back memories of when they flew REAL airplanes...!!,1482105600,,72,5.083333333333333
8211412,5,B000TYDZP4,"I saw the original theatrical release of the film and it's one of the very best documentaries on the Blues ever made! A ""must"" for Blue Angels fans!",1452556800,,148,4.321428571428571
8211413,3,B000TYDZP4,The picture shows a book but we didn't get one.  The DVD was enjoyed.,1438214400,,69,3.9285714285714284
8211414,5,B000TYDZP4,"One of the finest videos ever made on this subject.  While it is aviation oriented, I have used the tape version as a management, supervisory training aid for years.  The lessons contained in here about teamwork, motivation, trust, etc. pertain to many things in life but, since I'm a long time F-4 fan, this is just outstanding.",1430006400,,329,4.754385964912281
8211415,5,B000TYDZP4,"This is still the finest aviation film I've every found. When you put 6 Phantoms together 3 inches wingtip to canopy, you've set a pucker factor standard that can never be topped.",1428019200,,179,4.625
8211416,5,B000TYDZP4,"My VHS tape finally gave up the ghost....this DVD IS AWESOME!!!
Just wish it was formatted in wide screen instead of standard.....
I love the soundtrack, 60/70's music...awesome to see and hear the F-4's and their pilots stories....",1426809600,,232,5.131578947368421
8211417,5,B000TYDZP4,"I bought this in the 80s on VHS and wanted to try a DVD version.
This is one of the best aviation documentaries ever put on film.
The Angles are flying the F4 phantom which became a legion
in its own time. This is the first video that shows extensive inside
cockpit views of a high performance, combat jet. Some people
say they don't like the 70s back ground rock music but I think
it matches the time period and the movie perfectly, and like
a lot of movies of this time period its professionally done. If
your into aviation history this is a must for your collection.",1405728000,,569,4.277777777777778
8211418,5,B000TYDZP4,"Back when the Blue Angels flew Phantoms. Incredible in-cockpit footage. Love the music! This film rules. I was going to take a star off because this film really needs to be restored and re-released, but I won't. I love this film. You will too.",1393113600,,243,4.545454545454546
