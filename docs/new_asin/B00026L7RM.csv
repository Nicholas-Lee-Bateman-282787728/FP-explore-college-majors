2063519,5,B00026L7RM,This is the best movie I have ever seen in my wife. I'm 35 and I watch it with my parents every Saturday night. I have two children but they won't watch it with me. They don't know what they are missing!!!!! It has so many good characters. As you can tell my favoirte is the wump.......tee hee hee. I have been thrown out of restaurants for singing the songs too loudly but I don't care. When I die my only wish is to be burried with my sillyville tape. It's a great magical movie for people of all ages. It's entertaining as well,1083974400,14,530,4.105769230769231

Creepiness aside, this is an awesome show. The colors, the catchy songs, the bizarre people and all the weirdness. It's just so unusual and fantastical. I love the magic magnifying glass.
There is, of course, a moral to the story, and it is that of tolerance which I think has, in itself, a second layer-agenda. But I still love the movie for the catchy songs and colorful fun.
I paid full price for this item. All opinions are my own.",1460764800,,652,4.396694214876033

2063746,5,B00026L7RM,"This, along with WeeSing Together, are my FAVORITE movies in the WeeSing colection!  My daughter will sit through the entire movie and watch it on repeat.  She sings, dances, and acts out the entire movie!  She loves this as much as mommy did when she was younger and I LOVE being able to share this experience with her.  The songs are fun, the acting is impecable (for a kids show, they really seem believable in their makebelieve world) and I LOVE the message of equality the story sends out.  For many you will see a theme of racial equality because it's all about the people that only like their own color (red, blue, green, yellow, etc) coming together to appreciate and love each other.  But it's also just about acceptance of others.  Not judging people based on their looks.  Having an open heart to get to know someone different because it's our differences that make us beautiful.  It's one of the BEST social-justice movies I've ever seen and it's a kid's film!  I love this movie and the message it sends and will let my daughter watch it for as long as she likes!  I'm going to get another one soon because I'd like to have one at home and one at grandma's house so she can have her favorite movies at either place and not have to worry about packing it in the bag each trip.",1428278400,3,1288,4.3924050632911396

It's a 'good' VHS picture (whatever that means).  Others have said that there isn't enough singing compared to other WeeSing movies:  I played this at work (video store), and there was almost nothing but singing.  Listening to the songs brought was extremely joyful.

Yes, it is a corny film, and yes, the acting isn't good, but this is a movie for younger kids.  I know when I was a kid, I didn't think anything about the acting:  It was just a fun film to watch, and it still is!",1411603200,,634,4.305084745762712

Both of my children are in love with the songs and dances from this movie and are singing along all the time. I find myself singing along a lot too actually so it isn't annoying to watch over and over either.

I like the message in it as well. It teaches kids that you shouldn't judge people based on their appearance and in the case of the movie literally their color. It was brilliantly done by showing how wrong it is to dislike someone based on their ""color"" but didn't shove it at you or make it the complete front focus.

2063922,5,B00026L7RM,"""Wee Sing in Sillyville"" has to be, without a doubt, the best singing DVD you would ever purchase for your pre-schooler! There are so many entertaining songs and, what is more, it teaches a very valuable lesson: that no matter what color you are (literally), you can still be friends with the other color. More people should listen to that. Think about what Dr. Martin Lurther King Jr. had to say and do in his ""I have a dream"" speech! Imagine someone not liking you just because they are wearing red and you are wearing yellow. That is the situation we face in ""Wee Sing in Sillyville.""

So, here is what happens. The show starts off with these two children coloring a coloring book of Sillyville (little do they know that they are actually coloring Sillywhim, our title character). Barney, their dog is playing with them too. Then they break into a song called ""Do your ears hang low?"" because of Barney's ears. Then as they are playing, Sillywhim magically transports Barney into her coloring book, a.k.a. Sillyville. The children, known as Laurie and Scott (brother and sister), are looking for Barney but cannot find him. Finally, they find him in the coloring book and Sillywhim transports them into Sillyville (the coloring book).

So, now we are in Sillyville. Sillyville is like The Emerald City from ""The Wizard of Oz"" in that everything, and I mean everything, is colorful. The two children meet the Yellow Spurtlegurgles (from behind a tree) first and hear them sing a song. After that, they meet Sillywhim who explains all about how they got into Sillyville, who the Spurtlegurgles are and how no colors want to talk to any other color. Now, it must be noted that Sillywhim is dressed all in the color of white. She notices that Laurie and Scott are too colorful to meet any other colors, so she makes the children invisible.

Now the children go on to meet the Blue Twilrypops, who are singing yet another song by Sillyville's main area. They finish that song then they sing another song with Sillywhim. After that, Sillywhim tries to get them follow along with them to their next stop, but they say no because their next stop is too green.

So, on we go to to the pond where Laurie and Scott, still invisible, meet the Green Jinglehimers. They sing one song and then they hear the croaking of the frogs that live in the pond. Of course, since the frogs are green, the Jinglehimers go to watch the frogs sing. There are three frogs and they sing two songs. After that is over, Sillywhim ask the Jinglehimers and the frogs if they want to continue on with her to her next stop, but they say no because it is too red. Oh well.

So, Laurie and Scott, still invisible, arrive at the Red Bettiebotties house. It is a family home with a Mom, a Dad, a Brother, a Sister, and a little baby. The house lights up when the Bettiebotties sing (and that is why this is my favorite part of the whole movie). The first song is sung by the whole family (except the baby). The second and final song is sung by the Brother and the Sister only, but they do a wonderful job. After that is finished, Sillywhim asks them if they want to go with her to visit Posha, but the Father says that purple Posha wears might be too much for the baby, so they stay home and say bye bye to Sillywhim.

On they way to Posha's house, they step on an acorn in the grass who sings a song about him being a nut. Sillywhim reminds Laurie and Scott that ""That's Sillyville for you, anything could happen,"" and they continue on to Posha's house.

Now Posha is extremely, and I do mean extremely nice. She is so nice, if she was a candy bar, I could get a cavity just looking at her! So, Laurie and Scott did not need to be invisible with her. She loved colors and she had them all in her house. She was like a grandmother of Sillyville. There were 4 or 5 songs sung in that house alone, but don't worry, they are short and sweet. Sillywhim is asking Posha if she knows of any way to reunite the colors and Posha shakes her head saying that she bumped into a Yellow Spurtlegurgle the other day and he/she would not even say hi to her (because she was wearing purple probably).

So, they leave Posha's house and know Sillywhim, Laurie and Scott are tring to think up how to reunite the colors. Everywhere they go, nobody is around. They say things like, ""What if we...no that wouldn't work"" and ""There's always...no"".

Finally, like lightning out of the clouds, Sillywhim has an idea while they are standing by where the Blue Twilrypops had been singing earlier (nobody is there at the moment). She is about to dash off to do whatever it is her idea is when she hurts her ankle badly, real badly. She cannot even stand up anymore. Scott yells for help. First Posha arrives and then everyone else, literally. Posha wraps Sillywhims ankle in cloths that are given to her from everyone around, which are all different colors. Once the cloths are on Sillywhim, the other colors notice how beautiful they look together and how beautiful THEY AS A GROUP around Sillywhim look together. All of that brings Sillywhims colors back (remember that Sillywhim was wearing only white?) Now, Sillywhim has a rainbow outfit on and the cloths have disappeared. She introduces Laurie and Scott to everyone (except Posha, who already met them) and they sing ""Let us stand together,"" which is probably the best song in the whole film.

After that, Laurie, Scott, and even Barney return back home. Was it all a dream? They look down at the coloring book...

2063940,4,B00026L7RM,"If you are looking for a video to put on for the little ones so you can get things done, then this is the one to get.

My mother first got this for my younger sisters in the mid '90's, and though I was already a teenager by then, I noticed that, unlike most young children's entertainment, this one didn't make me want to vomit.  She dug the video out a few years back, as she has taken on babysitting, and it has been a favorite for each of the kids she has watched.

Though the acting is what you'd expect (pretty poor, especially the younger actors), the message is a good one; it's a lesson on diversity through use of characters not talking to other characters who wore different colors), and it's told through a series of songs that, while still aimed at kids, are, at times, amusing, and occasionally even catchy (even if you just hear the show from another room, you will find the songs randomly popping into your head later).  It is a good length, 45 mins; not too short to be unintelligible and not so long as to bore the kids.  Age range would probably be from 1-5 years of age.

Basically, it's the story of two kids, Scott and Laurie, and their dog Barney, who get sucked into their coloring book and meet Sillywhim, a bizarre lady wearing all white.  They meet several groups of characters who all wear the same color, and are all friendly enough and quick to engage in song, yet steadfastly refuse to even meet with or talk to any other characters who wear different colors.  The only exception is the purple-wearing Sasha, who shares Sillywhim's desire to unite all the colors.  It's a simple story and it's simply resolved, but that's to be expected from this kind of video.  I highly recommend if you have little ones.",1298937600,3,1736,4.430817610062893

2063972,4,B00026L7RM,"I owned this video as a child, and was excited to find it on DVD for my two year old daughter.  We've watched it quite a few times and it doesn't get old for her.  The main character, Silly Whim, can get on an adult's nerves, but her charisma and goofy energy seem appealing to a young child.  My daughter especially loves all the songs in the video, which come from the Wee Sing Silly Songs collections, and I actually find them kind of catchy too!  The plot of the video is simple and easy for a child to follow; there's trouble in Sillyville as members of different tribes (all characterized by a certain color) won't speak to anyone of any other color.  Silly Whim, the only person that is mutually accepted, enlists the help of two children, Laurie and Scott, to help her make peace in Sillyville and bring everyone together.  These three characters visit each color group one at a time, hear the silly songs each group has to sing, and encourage a meeting with a different color group.  When these attempts fail, the three main characters struggle to come up with a new plan.  As they are brain-storming, Silly Whim takes a fall and is hurt, bringing characters of every color rushing to her aid, and in the process reconciling with each other.  This video has a nice message of tolerance, which is all too important for children to learn, and has a lot of silly fun for children to enjoy along the way.",1235692800,2,1409,4.45136186770428

The underlying message in this movie is that, like a box of crayons, all colors must learn to live together and get along.  A perfect message for children to learn in a not so perfect world.  A lot of fun to watch, and plenty of chances for older children to sing and dance along to. The bright colors, music, and action will entertain the younger children, 9 months to 18 months, just don't expect them to sit through the whole movie.  Preschools love to interact with the movie and can generally make it through the entire viewing time, 1 hour, as long as they can participate.

Fast forward to present day when a young man remembered these fun-filled times of relationship building and was determined to find this video that oft brought smiles to a pudgy boy's face.

Imagine my delight when I received my order from Amazon and popped in the 60 minute program (now on DVD!); expectations could not be any higher. My brother and I tried to fake enthusiam similar to Family Feud contestants clapping for an answer that everybody knows is going to get 'x'ed', but alas-who were we kidding. The songs are entirely too long, the acting is horrible, inanimate objects have creepy faces painted on them (man, those smiling rocks give me goosebumps), the introductory scene is much too long, I could go on and on.

The only things keeping me from giving this thing one star is 1) my pride and 2) the ""I'm a nut"" song. We have fond memories of our childhood for a reason; this is a prime example of technology digging up and representing the worst of our society.",1153958400,4,1192,4.53953488372093

I took it to my first babysitting job and the kids absolutely loved it, now i'm buying it for my friend's kids. I never knew there were other Wee Sing tapes, but Sillyville was what i grew up with... we watched it like everyday, i can still sing all the songs right along w/ it..",1145404800,,397,3.975

When its on, my 16-year old granddaughters will come out of their room and start singing to the songs.  Its been out a long time and will seem corny to older folks, but the songs are very entertaining to kids.",1138838400,4,325,4.295081967213115
2064017,5,B00026L7RM,"I was forced to watch this video many times in elementary school-it was my class' personal favorite. Basically, it's a racial tolerance story for children. And don't even try to say that it's not. Two children travel to a land inside a coloring book called Sillyville, where the different ""colors"" don't get along. The red hate the blue, the blue hate the green, the green hate the yellow. The only color that had any kind of tolerence at all was the purple woman, and I suspect that was because she lived alone in a house with 5 fuzz balls and a marionette puppet of a bird. Had there been 5 or 6 purple people like there were of the other colors, and they would have hated the other colors just as much. But anyway, at the center of all of this is Sillywhim, the ""star"" of the coloring book. She acts a sort of a tour guide for the two children, protecting them from possible hostility based on the clothes they wear (or, to be more specific, the colors of the clothes they wear) and showing them the general misfortune in Sillyville. Her black and white outfit, she tells them, used to be many different colors, but became very plain and boring when the colors stopped working together. As they go through Sillyville, each color group is given a song or two. The blue people sing about a yodeling ostrich, the red sing about a sick baby, the yellow sing about fish, chips, and vinigar, and the green sing about playing leapfrog. The colors are, of course, reuinited at the end to help Sillywhim when she twists her ankle. They may hate each other, but their love for Sillywhim helps them overcome it and work together. Now tell me that isn't a racial tolerance story in disguise. But it's a pretty good one.",1134345600,2,1710,4.466453674121405

And now my 3 year old son as well as my 20 month daughter are enjoying it just as much as my oldest did. Kids loving watching kids and they love music and dancing. This video is filled with just that. If your kids love being silly, this is a great video to add to your collection.",1128297600,3,392,3.9125

Great songs and a fun storyline...I enjoy watching it as much as they do!  The message is pretty powerful, too.  Acceptance and friendship are among the many virtues addresses in this DVD.

2064021,3,B00026L7RM,"I got from my sister-in-law Wee Sing Rock Candy Mountain, Wee Sing Kingdom, & Wee Sing Train all on VHS that her kids loved when they were small. After my 18 month old also seemed to fall in love with these tapes I decided to add to our Wee sing collection. I read a few reviews before buying Wee Sing in Sillyville which all seemed like good reviews. However personaly I am disappointed in this one - it just doesn't have the same effect as the others. I think the songs aren't as catchy & original and our son also seems to like the characters better when they are in big ""puppet"" type costumes instead of alot of the ones here are dressed up people.",1127088000,,652,4.224

This is the one video that all of our family continued to remember.  There is an awesome message for children about getting along.  Lots of dancing and singing.  I bought this video recently for my friend's 3 yr old.  She watched it 3 times the first day and is singing the songs.  I would recommend this to everyone.  Wait til' you meet Sillywhim.

PS we bought a new copy for our family also - you are never to old for a little dancing and singing...",1125360000,,576,4.117117117117117

2064026,5,B00026L7RM,"This DVD was recommended on one of the websites for children with apraxia and other speech delays.  I bought it for my 3 year old son, who has apraxia, and he loves it.  The songs are catchy and use a wide variety of consonant and vowel sounds.  My son loves to sing along with the characters. It has helped to reinforce some of the things he is learning in his speech therapy.

Even if you child does not have speech delay issues, it is still enjoyable.  The actors act childlike but do not speak down to children.  The costumes and sets are very colorful and of good quality.",1115337600,27,577,4.296296296296297

My 2 year old can recite whole pieces of it by heart and they love to sing along to the songs.  This DVD is AWESOME but it is not even the best of the Wee Sing series, they really do a great job on each one--my kids have several. All the Wee Sing productions are live action with wonderful performers,  with brightly colored costumes and sets, and the storylines move right along with wonderfully choreograped songs and dancing.  No long drawn out dialogue and nothing over their heads, just solid neverending eye and ear candy for the toddler set.  Just delightful to watch.",1098835200,11,680,4.322834645669292
