8555200,4,B00AO7HMQO,I bought this only for the In Hell movie.  It is not available anywhere else in Region 1.  Van Dam struggles in prison and then he reaches a point where he unleashes all his demons upon his rivals.,1436745600,4,197,4.157894736842105
8555201,5,B00AO7HMQO,"I was looking for a few action movies to buy my husband, and I couldn't beat 4 films for $8. (He still loves Dolph and Van Damme from Universal Soldier, I hear about it all the time). He was happy with the set, I was happy with the price - win win for me!",1362355200,5,255,3.740740740740741
8555202,2,B00AO7HMQO,"This really isn't a very good set of movies starring these four action icons and ""Expendables 2"" alumni. ""Blitz"" starring Jason Statham is perhaps the best film here, a modest British made police drama. Stallone can be seen in the grizzly and ludicrous ""Eye See You"", from the director of ""I Know What You Did Last Summer"" it remained unreleased for several years, but is at least the only theatrical movie in this collection. Van Damme's ""In Hell"" is by far, the worst movie in here, a dull and unpleasant prison film with minimal action. Dolph Lundgren stars in the very cheap looking ""Direct Contact"", a direct-to-DVD movie that is just sad in comparison to his better films made a decade or two earlier. In the end, it is cool that these four stars are given there due in a box set collection, it's just unfortunate that these uninspired movies were the ones chosen.
