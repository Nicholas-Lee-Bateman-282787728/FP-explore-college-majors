7902276,4,B0000031E5,"A reporter tries to balance his loyalty to friends with his personal integrity in this drama. Martin (Timothy Hutton) is a newspaperman from Detroit who has just published a book on organized crime. Doc (Joe Pantoliano), his close friend, has low-level connections to the Mob, and helped him get much of the information. While working on a story, Martin meets Sara (Michelle Burke), an exotic dancer with a complex story. He and Sara find themselves attracted to one another, and a romance grows between them, but Sara is angered when Martin uses deeply personal details of her story in one of his columns. After Martin promises Sara he'll never again betray her confidence, Doc approaches him with an offer -- a movie studio has expressed an interest in Martin's book, and Doc is having a cash-flow problem that's put him in debt to Mob loan sharks. Why not make Doc the producer on the movie so he can make some quick money and pay off the thugs? While Martin weighs the wisdom of this course of action, a studio chief tells Martin he's interested in his recent column about the stripper; if he can integrate the story into his book, they're certain to make a deal. The Last Word also stars Richard Dreyfuss, Chazz Palminteri, Cybill Shepherd, and Roma Downey. ...The Last Word ( Cosa Nostra: The Last Word )",1329436800,,1310,4.7
7902277,5,B0000031E5,"I truly think that Joe Pantoliano is one of the best support-actors in our days. Nowadays there are too many boring an stupid comedian actors and supposed ""new talents"".
Joe gives off a special male sexuality like few could do in a film. It's very complicated the sort of roles he has to develop, because there is no a ""hero"" compensation in none of them.",1047945600,,355,4.476923076923077
7902278,5,B0000031E5,"Mesmerizing, Haunting, & Touching are words to describe this movie. The characters, well acted and their stories get under one's skin. A must see.",1012694400,,146,5.125
7902279,4,B0000031E5,"Although, I willingly admit, the beginning of this movie begins with some very weak dialogue, by the end of the movie, you begin to realize it's all a joke.
Quick synopis:  Timothy Hutton is a newspaper writer--writing columns about ""scenes from everyday life.""  He publishes a book based on these columns, which his friend ""doc"" sends to a contact in hollywood.  Meanwhile, Hutton's Character finds out that his true life stories got a guy killed by the local mob, and his wife leaves him.  Hutton also meets a stripper who captivates him.  From there we move to hollywood where Hutton needs to write a script with the edge his columns have, however, the studio wants his later work, including his article about the stripper, but she says he cannot.  The tension builds.
The movie ends up being made, and that is where you see it make fun of itself and its hollywood dialogue.  Very entertaining.  But there's also some serious stuff at that point as well--more details of the strippers past and her own personal testimony and wisdon gleened from her experiences.
The juxtaposition of music and action in the movie is extremely well done.  All together, a very good movie, even if the dialogue makes one want to cringe at times, at least it rights itself by the end.",984960000,3,1267,4.722727272727273
7902280,4,B0000031E5,"It wasn't until the end credits when I saw that writer/director Tony Spiridakis' film was based on a play that I could fathom the reason for his Clifford Odets-ian blather which passes as dialogue. Spiridakis was fortunate to be able to direct his own material - he manages to make a contribution to the genre of wacked auteur classics which teeters between genius and lunacy. These kind of films have their own fascination and Spiridakis' is just as strangely compelling. I can imagine anybody else wanting to excise these pungently lyrical encounters and pare down the treatment to it's plot points, but perhaps there is no way to do this, since it's hard to genre-place the material. It begins in Detroit as a mafioso thriller of sorts with Chaz Palminteri threatening Timothy Hutton as a the writer of a column ""Scenes From Everyday Life"". Hutton has collected his writing into a book which has Palminteri in threatening mode, since Hutton exposes the underworld low life, which has ""consequences"". The title of Hutton's column and book scream irony and the notion of writer as a mythological figure, a modern day Cassandra, is perhaps a little too much of an ego trip for Spiridakis. Things become more surreal when Hollywood calls and options Hutton's book, with the proviso that he includes the latter material he has published on a stripper named Caprice. Caprice is aptly named, a ""class act"" who strips wearing hideous clown orange glow lipstick and a peroxide wig to the sounds of classical music. (In the real world this kind of stripper would be fired after her first set). Naturally she and Hutton become an item and with Hutton's childhood friend, Joe Pantoliano, relocate to L.A. The L.A. scenes are said to show Hollywood's darker side, though they are most memorable for the star cameos Spiridakis features. Richard Dreyfuss, Tony Goldwyn, Cybill Shepherd, and Jimmy Smits make brief appearances (Smits gets 7 words) which is proof that either Spiridakis' dialogue can cast a wide spell or that he pays well. Palminteri only got one scene as well. Spiridakis presenst all this with a straight face, with the occasional Toni Childs croaker on the soundtrack, intercutting between Caprice painting and Hutton having sex with someone else, split second flashbacks to Caprice's tragic past (which includes a Golden Boy violin), and an amusing opening with the entrance of a long-stemmed flower box thought to be a machine gun at Hutton's book launch. His screenplay features endlessly quotable thearical flourishes though my favourites are a line to Caprice - ""It's not easy to love the way you do and still be alive"", and how Hutton is required to produce a screenplay ""with teeth"". Hutton performs his duets with Michelle Burke as Caprice in hushed reverential tones, as opposed to the yelling that takes place between him and Pantoliano. Panoliano probably comes off the best, since he tends to rush through his lines. There is an interesting parallel between the two men and the leads in Sweet Smell of Success, with Pantoliano like Tony Curtis' Sidney Falco. Burke however comes off the worst. It doesn't help that she resembles Holly Hunter, but having none of Hunter's ability, and she gets Spiridakis'worst excesses, like a montage of silent screams. Movies about Hollywood are always a little odd, just from the fact that it doubles the illusion, but this is one of the oddest.",984787200,2,3400,4.977152899824253
