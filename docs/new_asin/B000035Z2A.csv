1258359,5,B000035Z2A,"Finally! At long last comes this particular WHO adventure that shows how just Leela came on board with the Doctor. Really though, that's just a part of what is a pretty compelling sci-fi story that would have worked even if  it wasn't a Dr. Who tale. When the Doctor crosses her path, Leela is a  member of a tribe on an alien world, but is just as much of an outcast from  her people as the Doctor is. Finally, we have a female  ""companion"" that doesn't require constant rescuing...in fact, she  actually pulls the Doctor out of danger more than once in this adventure.  Strong, intelligent, and attractive, Leela makes a charming picture of the  internal human struggle between knowledge and superstition. Tom Baker  shines as the Doctor.",951955200,2,740,4.7265625
1258360,5,B000035Z2A,"Without a doubt this is one of the best adventures from the Tom Baker, or any, era.  The fourth Doctor was really hitting his stride in this one, and it is a true classic.  The Doctor proves his long-running theory that if  you travel though time and the universe long enough, you will eventually  run into yourself.  In its original serial form, this adventure featured  one of the best and most surprising end-of-episode cliffhangers in the  history of the series.  The Doctor's interaction with the primative tribe  he encounters is priceless; and the sarcasm, wit, and one-liners that the  Doctor's fourth incarnation is known for flows freely.  The  ""lush"" jungle sets, and production values in general, are good by  Dr. Who standards.  As if all of this weren't enough, the Doctor gets a  sexy new travel companion in this one, Leela, who scampers around half  naked most of the time, but who contrasts beautifully as the enlightened  savage to the Doctor's quirky intellectual.  The only bad thing about this  Who adventure is that it took so long to finally come out in video.",946166400,63,1084,4.825136612021858

1258364,5,B000035Z2A,"This is my favorite story of them all.  The two reasons I love this more than the rest are watching the Doctor dealing with being called evil (not something you see in any other episode) and watching him deal with a dedicated killer like Leela.  I know Tom Baker always objected to the Leela character because she was a killer but watching him trying to reform her was always a laugh for me.

1258365,4,B000035Z2A,"Leela gets her start right here in this story. Jameson shines in the role and carries the day as the much needed shot of energy in the show. Baker seems to enjoy the new companion and his acting and energy will be at some of it's best during her tenure.
The episode itself is good.not a classic but good fun all the way.
Solid extras and the premiere of Leela make this a worthy addition to any Doctor Who collection.",1410739200,,417,4.225
1258366,4,B000035Z2A,"The story of its own merits is actually pretty average. The Doctor encounters a barbaric tribe serving what it thinks is a war god. The plot is often silly and the characters paper thin, with villains who have discovered the most exalted from of worship-touching your toes.

What makes this serial more than average is the introduction of Louise Jameson as Leela, a ruthless warrior who, though ignorant of technology, is very bright. She was definitely a departure from many past female companions: she could take care of herself. And she does so quite brutally in this first adventure. Overall, this is a solid story that does a great job presenting a truly memorable companion.",1409270400,,680,4.913043478260869
1258367,5,B000035Z2A,Tom Baker as the 4th Doctor in the amazing 50 year long BBC series. If your new to Dr Who check out a classic like this episode. You will instantly be hooked on Tom Baker and his style of acting the part of The Doctor. This episode see the barbarian Leela join the Doctor as his companion and learn that science is better than superstition.,1408665600,,340,4.246153846153846
1258368,5,B000035Z2A,"This is another of my all time favorite Doctor Who episodes.  This is the introduction of the Doctor's companion Leela, an exiled hunter from her tribe.  Unlike most companions who run screaming from danger, Leela often runs toward it brandishing a hunter's knife.  On of the best things about Leela is that they don't play up the ignorant savage.  Leela, even though she is unfamiliar with scientific concepts, often is able to pick them up quickly on a rudimentary level, usually to the surprise of the Doctor.",1406332800,,512,4.850574712643678
1258369,5,B000035Z2A,I think Tom Baker is one of the best Doctors but that is just by me he is my favorite Doctor Who.,1394841600,,97,3.4545454545454546
1258370,5,B000035Z2A,"An excellent story and key episode in the Doctor Who mythos because it's the beginning for Leela. She wasn't around very long but she made a huge impact and was (next to Sarah Jane) arguably the 4th Doctor's best companion. Certainly a contrast to every other companion The Doctor has ever had. Leela was very unique, with all the companions The Doctor has had from past, present or future all were entirely civilized and modern like Amy and Rory or futuristic like Zoe Harriot. Only really Jamie and Leela were ever the 'savages' but they were never stupid and always charming.
Leela remains one of the most popular assistants to The Doctor ever and she even has a Futurama character named after her!
She wasn't just for 'the dads' as they keep insisting with her near nakedness although I'm sure Louise Jameson in leather loincloths would appeal to any straight male. But Louise is a great actress and her curiosity and determinedness and ferocity, much the same as Jamie's with the 2nd Doctor is what has endeared her so much to fans.
The contrast between The Doctor being so much purely intellect and reason and scientific paired with an almost entirely physical character... This is a wonderful debut story for a companion and a very unique story. Again, not having seen it in years I was struck by how much it drew me in and how great an idea, rarely explored is the notion that consistent time travel may have ill effects on a society come to haunt The Doctor himself.
Of course I love all The Doctors but as with many Tom Baker was my introduction to the world of Doctor Who way back in the late 70's. And Leela was my first companion. Although Sarah Jane will always be No. 1 for me, Leela is dear to the heart and comes in a close 2nd. The first episode I ever saw was The Talons of Weng-Chiang but I caught The Face of Evil not long around on a rebroadcast and seeing this DVD and the good quality of it and also the good quality of the episode. It was smart to produce this entirely in studio. Some stories just beg to be shot on location and some as with this and Planet of Evil and Brain of Morbius work best all in studio. There's so much I can say about this and it has wonderful Special Features. I'll say one thing even though collecting classic Dr. Who's takes a mighty bite out of your pocket book at least they pack most of these stories with tons of features that make it worth it. My fav Leela stories are: The Face of Evil, The Talons of Weng-Chiang, The Horror of Fang Rock, the Robots of Death and The Sun Makers. To me those represent the best of the Leela years. I know that Horror of Fang Rock isn't the most popular of Tom Baker stories but if you look at it as a ghost or horror story it's really great. It's a total character study the same way that Alien is and has that 'ten little Indians' aspect to it, whose going to get it next kind of thing... I think The Horror of Fang Rock, The Face of Evil and Robots of Death are my top 3 Leela stories overall simply due to good characterization, great storytelling and great acting. The Horror of Fang Rock could be produced as a play with one set which is I think why I like it so much. The Face of Evil is classic science-fiction at it's best and rivals even the best of any era of any season of Star Trek. And the fact that The Doctor has to go it alone, and befriends Leela rather than being accompanied by an 'away team' gives the story much more power. This story is all The Doctor's fault and it's his responsibility to set things right... and REALLY shows off his character as a person rather than a busy body Time-Lord who flits in and out and sticks his nose into other people's business which is what the majority of his stories are like. With this he accepts that it's his fault and then goes right into trying to figure out and rectify the situation.
And lastly my fav Leela episode has to be The Robots of Death, I think Face of Evil is on a near parallel with that but overall Robots is such classic science fiction and done with class that I cannot believe any true Whovian who does not have that in their collection...",1393459200,,4114,4.316537467700258
1258371,4,B000035Z2A,"Saw this particular story decades ago and wanted to see it again, and as I had already bought Genesis of the Daleks and was impressed with how well, for me anyway, the story and the characters played out, bought as it was next on my list. This particular teleplay containing all four episodes, there is a good but small selection of extras. The extras are always a plus point for me as they give part of the creative process you also see some of the constraints with which the production team had to deal with.

Tom Baker is on top form here and delivers the goods so to speak. This story was also distinct as this was the debut of Louise Jameson with her Janis thorns, as the Doctor's new companion Leela. David Garfield plays the tribes shaman, Neeva and his character is very memorable. In fact there was pretty good acting all the way round. The framework and dressing for the jungle was quite realistic and there was good attention to detail. In fact the way the space vehicle debris and spacesuit relics are used as they are interlaced in what appears to be a Bronze Age village, gives the audience that something terrible has happened in the past. I wasn't overly impressed with the interiors of the spaceship and they looked very dated  more like dressed up empty corridors for run-through sequences. Lastly I will never look at Mount Rushmore in the same way again  as I am sure Tom Bakers face will be imprinted there.",1390867200,,1428,4.5271317829457365
1258372,5,B000035Z2A,"Excellent episode of Tom Bakers Doctor. First appearance of Leela, always a favorite Companion.
Tom Baker is my favorite Doctor and always a joy to watch, as much as I like watching the new doctors Tom will always be #1
As tehy say your first Doctor is always your favorite",1390003200,,273,4.48
1258373,5,B000035Z2A,I bought this episode because I had watched it the first time around in the 70s when I was a grad student in England and Dr. Who was new to me.  I thought the show was great science fiction on a low budget and low tech set.  But the writing was great.  Tom Baker is my Doctor Who and remains the best of the Drs.,1388448000,,312,3.769230769230769
1258374,5,B000035Z2A,"This story dealt with some pretty hefty themes for tea-time ""light entertainment"", such as the nature of religion and belief, the value of developing the mind versus that of developing the body, and for the first time since the William Hartnell story, ""Ark In Space"", it shone light, indirectly, on the unintended long-term consequences of the Doctor's actions.

This story holds a special place for me, being my introduction to Doctor Who when it first aired on PBS in the United States in 1979.  Yes, I had somehow missed the preceding stories, but after watching this one I was permanently hooked.

Notable Doctor quotes abound, such as the Doctor's observations on power and stupidity, and of course this story introduced one of my favorite companions, Leela, played by Louise Jameson.  The episode three cliffhanger is still one of my favorite Doctor Who cliffhangers.

This DVD also has some nice extras, representing an examination of a hugely popular television show approaching the zenith of its power.  So, cracking good story, and a number of nice things for the serious fan.  Enjoy...",1387324800,,1096,5.055555555555555
1258375,4,B000035Z2A,"Interesting premise and better pacing than a lot of early Doctor Who.  The acting is better than average, Baker playing his role with a bit more subtlety than usual and Louise Jameson his spunky sidekick.  Also better than usual special effects and costumes (relative to the period, of course.)  Worth adding to the collection for Who fan.",1381190400,,339,4.912280701754386
1258376,5,B000035Z2A,Tom Baker and Louise Jameson were just as I remembered them. The humor is a bit campy of course and Tom's charm comes through making this a delight for my eclectic collection.,1370390400,,175,4.5
1258377,5,B000035Z2A,"A favorite 4th Doctor story where Doctor 4, on his own, encounters a moment from his past on a distant planet, long ago colonized by a marooned astronaut team from Earth. Introduces the companion, Leela, and is full of fun and adventure.",1365033600,,237,4.666666666666667
1258378,5,B000035Z2A,"I love Tom Baker, he is soo funny, even if you don't know the series, you should watch this one, then you will be hooked. Just like I was.",1359676800,,138,3.793103448275862
1258379,5,B000035Z2A,"I had heard about Doctor Who & had been meaning to try it for a long time, but never really got around to it until my aunt started collecting the ones with Leela in them.  Naturally she started with this one so I watched it with her.  And I am eternally grateful to her for getting it.

This is a good entry point for those wishing to try Doctor Who.  True, the special effects aren't very special, but it still looks much better than the old Land of the Lost show if you ask me.  And in the end, it's the story that matters, & this does not disappoint.  This sums up what Classic Who is all about.  Interesting storylines, good acting and great dialogue (Doctor: ""You know, the very powerful and the very stupid have one thing in common. They don't alters their views to fit the facts, they alter the facts to fit the views, which can be uncomfortable if you happen to be one of the facts that needs altering."").

As I said in my Pyramid of Mars review, Tom Baker will always be my favorite Doctor.  And in all the Doctor Who episodes I have seen & will see, I don't think I'll ever see a better companion than Leela.  Despite being created just to draw older males to watch the show, she's not just eye candy.  She is a very competent warrior who helped the Doctor take down some of his enemies.  I've already seen about half of her episodes & will be sad to see her leave.

So, for anyone looking to try the old Doctor Who show & see what all the fuss is about, this is not a bad place to start.",1357948800,,1498,4.124137931034483
1258380,4,B000035Z2A,"I was thinking of the ""seveteem"" and ""tech"" and remembering how they derived from the same humanity.  Lessons always in Dr Who episodes from the 80s, and this one is a classic.  Get past the extreme low budget special effects and listen to the tale.",1357776000,,249,4.511111111111111

1258382,5,B000035Z2A,Boughr this as a gift for my husband who is a huge Tom Baker fan.  We both loved watching this dvd .  A good choice for any Tom Baker fan.,1354579200,,138,3.566666666666667
1258383,5,B000035Z2A,"ok I'm only doing one review for all the Tom Baker Doctor Who discs that I've bought (which is all 7 seasons except for ""the Terror of the Zygons"". all of these discs that I've bought have been awesome! not only that they come with subtitles so my deaf self has no problems catching every nuance of every story. if you are a Doctor Who freak like me than these are definatally worth it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",1348185600,,400,4.418918918918919
1258384,5,B000035Z2A,"I just like DR, Who with Tom Baker the story is great, clean, and action. and the ladies that work with him are also great. For me he is the best Doctor Who",1337904000,,156,3.757575757575758
1258385,3,B000035Z2A,"""The Face of Evil"" did two things Doctor Who had never done before: It introduced a woman as the Doctor's new companion who was so tough she screamed only once during her entire tenure (when a giant sewer rat grabs her legs in ""The Talons of Weng-Chiang,"" and who wouldn't?), and the story looked at what might happen if the Doctor returned to a planet where his intervention had almost destroyed a civilization rather than rescued it.

I've always had mixed feelings about Leela. Unlike most male (and perhaps many  female) fans, I never considered Louise Jameson's character a ""sex symbol"" nor a particularly good match for the Fourth Doctor in terms of personal chemistry. At the same time, Leela accompanies the Doctor on some of my favorite adventures: ""The Robots of Death,"" ""The Talons of Weng-Chiang"" and ""Horror of Fang Rock."" What I liked about Leela was not the way she filled out a skimpy leather costume but how she stood up to oppression and superstition and social convention while exhibiting a raw physical courage that surpassed that of any other companion of the classic era. Producer Philip Hinchcliffe and script editor Robert Holmes may have been looking for an Eliza Doolittle; what they got was a Natalie Bumppo.

We first meet Leela as she goes on trial for blasphemy against Xoanon, a god that her tribe, the Sevateem, worships and looks to for guidance in its war with the Tesh, a rival tribe that relies on advanced technology and psychic powers vs. the Sevateem's knives and crossbows. Leela is banished to the jungle, where she meets the Doctor, who resembles the ""Evil One"" whom the Sevateem fear and speaks with the same voice as Xoanon, their god. In Part One's cliffhanger, Leela leads the Doctor to a mountain where his face has been carved like a U.S. president on Mount Rushmore (viewers and critics often remark on this scene, but the monument still looks like a high-school art project). Suddenly, the Doctor remembers visiting the planet previously and helping the crew of a crashed spaceship repair its damaged onboard computer. The Sevateem and the Tesh, he deduces, must be descendants of that crew.

For all its ambition in depicting a civilization whose god is a supercomputer gone mad, ""The Face of Evil"" suffers from gaping holes in its logic and story elements that simply make no sense. Who, for instance, carved the face in the mountain and why does it resemble the Fourth Doctor if he visited the planet so long ago he hardly remembers it? The Sevateem are too technologically primitive, and why would the Tesh, so determined to repel the Sevateem, include an unguarded secret passage through the Doctor's mouth that allows outsiders to penetrate their complex?

The Doctor later explains that Xoanon (the ship's  computer) went mad because he made the mistake of programming his own personality into it, but how would that work exactly and where did the computer's other personalities come from? To further confuse matters, the Doctor says the computer has evolved into a living organism. Even if one concedes the possibility of an inanimate computer evolving into a living being, that isn't how evolution works. Single organisms don't ""evolve""; species evolve over millions of years of slight genetic variations favored or rejected by natural selection.

""The Face of Evil"" would rate only two stars if it weren't for the menu of Special Features included on this disc. The making-of documentary is smartly produced, even if I disagree with the show's producers that the costume and set designs for this story have held up well with time (they're awful!). The interviews with Louise Jameson and a review of the Fourth Doctor's press coverage, narrated by Wendy Padbury (""Zoe""), are also worth watching.",1335052800,2,3754,4.949206349206349
1258386,5,B000035Z2A,"From the Tom Baker era Doctor Who entitled ""The Face of Evil"" the Doctor has left Gallefry knowing that his foes the Master is out there somewhere in time and space.  So he does the only sensable thing and lands on an unkown planet.  However once on the planet he has the feeling he's been here before.  Then again for a time lord that like the Doctor that could be anywhere and anytime.  So he deicees to investiagte his surroundings.
  Meanwhile a savage tribe is holding a council to determine the fate of a young warrior woman named Leela.  She has spoke out against thier reloogius laws and wishes to defy the will of thier god Xoanon.  The only thing that will appease the god is a trial by feat of strength.  KNowing she will not live through it her father takes her place.  The chieftan knowing full well what this means gives Leela's father the trial only to see him die.  In anger Leela leaves and the chieftan banishes her as well.  With nowhere to go Leela ventures deep into the forbidden jungles to find answers that may help her find answers.
  The Doctor while trying to figure out if he's been here stumbles across Leela and her first reaction when seeing him is to flee.  For among her people he is ""The Evil One"".  the Doctor trying to make sense of this asks her to take him to where her people live.  He has to figure out why his very appearcne is realted to evil.
  ALong the way the Doctor discovers that the primative tribe Leela belongs has in thier posession advanced technology that none of them know how to use. Thier shaman seems to hear the voice of thier god Xoanon and demands that the Doctor be sacrificed and the warriors will finally be able to free there god.
  Can the Doctor make sense of what is going on? Can he discover if Xoanon is real or will he die as a sacrifice to a god he may have helped to create?  Tune in to see in ""The Face of Evil"".",1334707200,,1886,4.268361581920904
1258387,5,B000035Z2A,"Judging from its practically non-existent reputation among fans, ""The Face of Evil"" is one of the most underrated Doctor Who serials of all time. Perhaps it lacks popular appeal because it's a fairly literate science fiction story, in contrast to typical Doctor Who, which focuses more on horror and fantasy elements. To put it another way, ""Face"" is not as creepy or entertaining as the more gothic serials made around the same time; but if you're in the mood for literary sci-fi, this is very rewarding stuff.

Perhaps due to its lack of popularity, it took forever for ""Face"" to come out on DVD. But, as compensation for this, the DVD package is quite nice. The picture quality is good, given the age and origin of the material. And the special features are awesome. They include: a stylishly presented making-of documentary; an excellent interview with actress Louise ""Leela"" Jameson, who comes across as a warm and thoughtful person; a featurette on press coverage of Tom Baker's era (including some amusing inaccuracies - did those silly journalists even watch the show?); and an oddly mesmerizing 1970s commercial for Doctor Who action figures (which are also strikingly inaccurate). Compared to other single-disc Doctor Who DVD packages, this one is far above average.

The DVD does have a few shortcomings, however. A pet peeve of mine is that the ""making of"" features on Doctor Who DVDs focus almost exclusively on production, and too rarely delve into the writing and *themes* in these serials. A particularly striking aspect of ""Face"" is its quite obvious and bold attacks on religion, which are - predictably enough! - not really discussed in the making-of documentary. The only insight we get on this aspect of the serial comes from a few e-mail comments by writer Chris Boucher, which are read out loud by the guy who moderates the DVD commentary. Obviously, it would've been preferable to have Boucher himself present on the commentary, so he could discuss his ideas at greater length.

But I'm complaining too much. Reading aloud Boucher's e-mail comments, though strange, at least gives him a presence on the DVD. And in other respects, the DVD is very cool. Quite rightly, the special features place a lot of emphasis on Jameson, who made her debut in this serial as Leela -- arguably the Doctor's toughest, best-acted, and most attractive companion. So even though we don't get much Tom Baker or Chris Boucher on this DVD, we do at least see a lot of Leela. And that's never a bad thing. :-)",1333584000,11,2511,4.889671361502347
1258388,5,B000035Z2A,"I've wondered for some time now why the first story to feature popular companion Leela (Louise Jameson) was the last such story to receive a DVD release from the BBC. No matter now, though, because ""The Face of Evil"" is finally available, and it was well worth the wait. Sandwiched between the groundbreaking ""The Deadly Assassin"" and the brilliant ""Robots of Death"" (also by ""Face"" scribe Chris Boucher), this story of a computer gone mad thanks to the intervention of the Doctor himself often gets overlooked by fans looking back at the series' Golden Age of the mid-1970s. That's unfortunate, since the clever plot and noteworthy performances make it one of the most enjoyable outings of the period. Jameson, in particular, acquits herself nicely in her debut story, and the dynamic between her feral savage and Tom Baker's Time Lord is still unlike any other Doctor-companion relationship in the show's 49-year history. The reveal of the titular face is one of the all-time great cliffhanger moments. In all, a must have for fans of this series!",1333497600,,1049,4.965909090909091
1258389,4,B000035Z2A,"I am not going to summarize this story, because many other reviewers and websites have already done this.  Instead, I prefer to focus on the contents of the release itself, good or bad.

For starters, I can say that 2|entertain has finally taken a tiny steep beyond their previously lackadaisical releases.  The extra features for this release are a bit better than most of what they have put out in the past year or two.  Not a whole lot better, mind you, but still, I personally found this to be an improvement from several past releases.

Putting that aside, I was miffed by their guests for the commentary track.  One actor, who played a very minor role in episode one and was killed off, was a commentator, while the then producer, Philip Hinchcliffe, was only included in episodes 2-4.  Now really?  Why the HELL didn't they just have Philip in all four parts and eliminate the other commentator whose name and character I can't even remember?  The biggest shame is that Tom Baker wasn't in on the commentary.  But knowing how 2|entertain loves to get as much money as they can from loyal fans, he'll probably be on the re-release.

Lastly, does anyone have any insight as to how long Toby Hadoke has a contract with 2|entertain?  Because at this point, the only thing I'm looking forward to when it comes to commentaries, is NOT having this cellophane sack of vinegar and water delegate them.  In my humble opinion, commentaries were much better off when the people who were directly a part of the show participated, as opposed to bringing in an outsider who had his Doctor Who scarf eaten by moths.

My bottom line is, since the story itself is pretty good, and that this is the beginning of Leela's storyline, and that the extras involving Louise Jameson are better than others have been, I feel that this a MUST HAVE for every fan of the classic series.  And hopefully new and younger fans will appreciate this as well.

I hope that this review was helpful to you, and please tell me your opinion(s) on my review so that I can hopefully improve upon my future reviews.  Thank you for taking the time to read this and consider my opinion.",1331942400,,2147,4.593175853018373

""Face of Evil"" is the 4th show of of the 14th season, aired in 1977. The script is wonderful, imbued by scriptwriter Chris Boucher with psychological insights as well as tons of humor. The Doctor starts without a companion, having said goodbye to Sarah Jane Smith. The producers told Boucher to think of ""someone"" to use as a temporary sidekick while they figured out in which direction they wanted to go. Boucher has said that he wanted a truly brave woman, one with courage and pride, and he came up with Leela.

In viewer polls, Sarah Jane Smith is usually voted the best companion, but Leela is not far behind. Louise Jameson is a classically trained actress, and her portrayal of Leela is deceptively simple. The producers and the viewing public were smitten, and Leela became the permanent next companion.

My husband, who usually won't watch the old Dr. Who's with me, is happy to sit in on episodes with Leela. When I mentioned this one day, my teenage son responded, ""Well, YEAH, Mom!""  OK, so maybe it is more Leela's dress than her spunk that endears her to some fans!  This makes me chuckle, and reminds me of a letter the show's producers received after ""The Talons of Weng-Chiang"" was aired. The gentleman writer asked when Leela was going to be back in her leathers. Leela spent most of the Talons episode in proper Victorian attire, obviously not to everybody's liking.

Highly recommended Dr. Who episode. Other reviewers have already covered the clever plot, whose depths remind me of another classic, the movie ""Forbidden Planet"". I'll end with one of my favorite comedic lines. On meeting him for the first time, the horrified Leela accuses the Doctor of being The Evil One. The Doctor responds, ""Well, nobody's perfect, but that's overstating it a little.""

1258391,5,B000035Z2A,I highly recommend this video. I highly recommend any of the Doctor Who videos portraying the 4th Doctor.( Tom Baker plays),1238630400,,123,4.904761904761905
1258392,5,B000035Z2A,"Okay, I am waiting for this on DVD technically, but this episode is great.  I really enjoyed mystery solving element of this story. That makes this one of the most engaging episodes of Doctor Who I have ever viewed.",1158710400,,215,4.512820512820513
1258393,4,B000035Z2A,"When Leela, a young huntress of the Sevateem tribe first encounters the Doctor, she calls him ""the evil one"" to which the Doctor disarmingly says, ""Well, nobody's perfect, but that's overstating it a little.  Would you like a jelly baby?""
So begins his association with one of his most memorable companions, she of the chamois leather outfit, leaving her arms and legs bare, but don't mess with her, as she knows how to use a knife and Janis thorns, weapons that paralyze, then kill.
Leela has been banished from the Sevateem for saying that their god Xoanon, doesn't exist.  However, that's not all going on with the tribe.  There's a power struggle going between Neeva, the shaman who claims personal contact with Xoanon, and Calib, whose belief is tenuous, but wants nothing more than to have Neeva exposed as a fraud and charlatan.  The Sevateem want to liberate Xoanon from the Tesh, their sworn enemies who live beyond the wall in a mountain, however, the Evil One's invisible energy creatures prevent anything from happening.
The Doctor and Leela go to the mountain, where he says, ""I must have made quite an impression,"" for he sees his own face carved on the mountainside like Mount Rushmore.  Trouble is, he can't remember when he first came to the planet.  Also, the voice of Xoanon is his own!  But does Xoanon have all his marbles?  At one point, it says ""At last us... you, me, us, we... at last I shall be free of us!""  When the Doctor asks Xoanon who he is, Xoanon asks back ""Don't I know?""
Paradise comes from the Avestan (ancient Persian) word meaning ""walled-in enclosure.""  In that vein, Leela says of Xoanon, ""he dwells within the black wall wherein lies paradise.""  This draws on the theme of an ideal place made safe from evil by a wall.
Many praiseworthy lines come in from the Doctor.  ""Answers are easy.  It's asking the right questions which is hard."" and ""The very powerful and the very stupid have one thing in common.  They don't alter their views to fit the facts.  They alter the facts to fit their views.""  And in an exchange regarding faith and logic, Neeva says ""We start getting proof and we stop believing.""  Tomas replies, ""With proof, you don't have to believe.""
Louise Jameson's debut as Leela is impressive here and throughout the other eight stories she comes out in.  Despite the Doctor telling her off for killing people, even in self-defense, it has to be said that she saves the Doctor's life that way in this story and in those to come.  After all, she's using her huntress's instinct.  I'd have her as my minder anyday.
Of the supporting actors, David Garfield (Neeva) stands out.  His attempts to exorcise the Doctor, whom he thinks is the Evil One, is one of the kitschy moments of the series.  And his battle hat is indeed fetching, as it's a cricket glove with some odds and ends attached.
The original title The Day God Went Mad is more apropos, as the Doctor has to deal with an omniscient computer with schizophrenia.  However, it was changed to The Face To Evil to ward off any potential religious objections.  The ideas are creative, but the production values, such as the Sevateem's forest and a spaceship's corridors aren't much to shout home about, and only a few characters (Leela, Neeva, Tomas) stand out.",1075766400,8,3267,4.6812609457092815
1258394,5,B000035Z2A,"This story is another in the darker period of Doctor Who. Having jettisoned the increasingly Andy Pandy jump-suited Sarah Jane Smith before an apparently final battle with the Master, the Doctor foregoes his Presidency to return to roaming around the Galaxy.
The plot has been laid out by several reviewers before me and I will not travel that well trodden road any further. Suffice to say that the character of Leela clearly is intended to attract an older audience but at the same time, the darker stories required a much stronger character than the Sarah Jane Smith types in order for the plots to work. Leela is certainly that, a savage killer, brought up to kill or be killed, she is uneducated but not stupid. She has an instinct which saves them more than once and is yet very protective of the Doctor.
Part of the charm of this character was that she served as a role model for many other female actresses in British drama as an independent person, capable of holding her own with men.
The story is the first to acknowledge that time travel can have unintended future consequences which alters the future in a way never thought of. The two tribes are also symbolic of the way our modern society has developed into an environmental side as opposed to a scientific, technological side. The monster, not by accident, is the same as the monster in that classic sci-fi movie, whose name escapes me, but which is created through the scienytist's id when using alien machinery.
A very impressive story to have on video.",1025395200,11,1520,4.696629213483146
1258395,5,B000035Z2A,"Dr. Who arrives on an unnamed planet in the middle of a bloody war between to completely different tribes - one physical, courageous and strong-the other, mental, psychic and controlled- fighting to possess God.
God, in this case, is an intelligent computer that Dr. Who unknowingly made schizophrenic during an earlier visit to the planet. The God's madness started the war and it's up to Dr. Who to stop the war and avert the computer's self-destruction.
Thrown into the mix is the Dr.'s new assistant Leela.
A good episode of the series. Tom Baker is in high form, playing his role with relish while also playing to the camera. Leela, Louise Jameson, offers an interesting contrast-barbaric, emotional, quick to attack- to the Dr.'s way.
The show was written during the time of Von Danaaken's books-the Chariots of the Gods, et al., which hinted that earth had been visited by aliens in pre/early history, with devastating consequences. THe show reflects contemporary ideas and hints that our religions could have been based on similar visits.
An interesting premise.",1018224000,2,1070,5.0852272727272725
1258396,4,B000035Z2A,"Coming right on the heels of THE DEADLY ASSASSIN, THE FACE OF EVIL shifts the series away from its earlier, ""cozy"" format, and in a pretty permanent sort of way.  I often wondered why so few episodes dealt with the consequences of the Doctor's meddling in the affairs of other civilizations --this one takes the form of the Doctor confronting the spectacle of his own face carved into the side of a mountain on the scale of Mount Rushmore.
Originally titled ""The Day that God Went Mad,"" this serial takes us into an unnamed planet in the distant future, where two tribal factions are locked in an eternal (and ultimately futile) struggle, even though neither side has ever seen its enemy.  The inherent danger offered by organized religion is taken to task in a way few episodes before (or since) were up to challenging: as usual, the local God has a perfectly logical, scientific explanation, but there's no explaining this to his devoted followers, particularly the quick-thinking high priest.
The episode is of course noteworthy because it introduces Leela, as portrayed by Louise Jameson, who remains one of the most popular companions of one of the most popular Doctors.  Tom Baker carries off another brilliant performance, cheerfully spouting nonsense even as crossbows and poison darts are pointed in his direction.  The episode also has the advantage of being part of Season Thirteen, which is definitely Tom Baker's high point as the Doctor.  There is stark contrast between the aggressively savage Sevateem and the quietly fanatical Tesh, and it is this contrast which leads the Doctor to the story's climax: the local God is a divided personality and must be made whole --and the Doctor himself is the original cause of the problem!  Besides Ms. Jameson, my favorite character in this serial is Neeva (David Garfield), the High Priest who starts out as Xoanon's most devoted and vocal follower, but who proves to be quite the jaded cynic when all is said and done.  Worth your time if you're a Tom Baker fan, but can be safely left off your Top Ten Greatest Doctor Who Stories Ever list.",1017792000,21,2099,4.862745098039215
1258397,5,B000035Z2A,"This is Dr. Who at its best, in my opinion.  The story is strong and intricate; the science is integral to the plot's resolution; the one liners from Baker are witty, instead of just kind of funny, as can occasionally happen; surprisingly quotable truisms from The Doctor about human nature are periodically inserted, without being too didactic; and the energy is high - the story doesn't mire down as it can in some episodes.
This probably won't end up as your favorite episode, but it may end up as one of those Dr. Whos that will always get the comment out of you: ""Oh, I like that one!""",1015545600,,590,4.462962962962963
1258398,3,B000035Z2A,"Chris Boucher's flair for the one-liner was evident in every script he penned for the series, and The Face of Evil is no exception.  The Doctor's  utterances after being threatened by members of Leela's tribe are  hysterical, as is Tom Baker's ""jelly-baby"" routine (something  inserted by Baker himself, if I'm not mistaken).  The Face of Evil features  an interesting premise, and the tribal dynamics of the Sevateem are  convincingly explored.  Louise Jameson's debut as Leela is very good,  unfortuneately she is never as strong a character in later adventures as  she is here (except for perhaps ""Horror of Fang Rock).  All-in-all, an  average though enjoyable story.",966988800,5,671,5.226415094339623
1258399,5,B000035Z2A,"This is classic Dr Who.  The Doctor arrives in the uncharted jungles of an  alien world and finds the survivors of a doomed space expedition, who have  reverted to savagery, and an effigy of his own face carved into a mountain.  The first story to feature Leela, who is at her best here, this is  gripping sci-fi/fantasy from start to finish.  There are strong  performances from all the cast, the Horda are a genuinely chilling creation  and the scenes in the forest, in which the Doctor and his companions are  stalked by an unseen beast, really are behind-the-sofa moments.  Add to  that some nice little touches of humour and a clever, well-thought-out  storyline and you have four episodes of unmissable adventure.",965001600,2,719,4.851239669421488
1258400,5,B000035Z2A,"Boy, Robert Hodson, Jr.(the previous reviewer) really likes Leela! And so he should. Louise Jameson's performance only solidifies her character and the memory of this adventure. ""Face.."" is also the best sequel to  an untelevised adventure.  Sometimes this story gets a little lost between  adventures, but never seems lose its viewers. The cast give wonderful  performances, which isn't surprising, since Chris Boucher's script is  filled with memorable line after line(just like ""The Robots of  Death""). The design and execution are over par for Who. There are one  or two little goofs, like how do the Doctor and Leela climb to the mouth of  the idle, some pedestrian gun play, and apart from a computer voice, where  are all the Tesh women? Apart from that, ""Face..."" is  unforgettable, thoroughly enjoyable even with repeated viewings.",952992000,3,840,5.2481203007518795

7916725,4,B000035Z2A,"A very fun and interesting story for Doctor Who.

Tom Baker gets to play a somewhat dual role here, the Doctor of course and a dictatorial computerized alter ego whose physical embodiment is known as The Evil One.
In his first scene he emerges from the Tardis companionless, looks into the camera and addresses the viewer making all of us his companion for a moment!
There are some more clever bits here including an intimidating use of Jelly Babies but the real value of this story is the introduction of Louise Jameson as the character Leela.
Her performance is very good but not her best in the series.
The other characters are fairly mediocre. Not absolute bores, they just don't bring much to this story which looks and feels like a typical Star Trek episode to me. Not a bad thing.
Great concept overall with the Doctor Himself and his effort to correct a past mistake as the main focus.
Well executed but a noticeable distance from the classic masterpieces.

Video and Audio quality are excellent overall for this release.

There are six worthwhile extras, all well done.
There seem to be no hidden Easter Eggs.

Essential for fans of the Leela era!",1493683200,,1156,4.679802955665025
