3162677,5,B0016PWWUY,My daughter is learning how to spell and read words just from watching Word world. It is one of her favorite shows. Can't wait to give her more dvds for x-mas.,1226793600,,159,4.161290322580645
3162678,5,B0016PWWUY,"My son is 1 1/2 years old and he adores this show (and so do I actually).  This is the best kid's television show that I've seen so far.  Each character (dog, ant, duck, pig, sheep, etc) is made up of the letters that spell it.  Each show is about 15 minutes long - just the perfect length to keep the smaller kids engaged.  My son loves the ""Build a Word"" portion that they do in each episode.  We are in the beginning stages of talking now, and this is definitely another conversation piece for that.  For the older kids it probably helps with spelling.  What a great show!  I definitely recommend! (another good one is Welcome to Word World)",1226448000,,644,4.308333333333334
3162679,5,B0016PWWUY,My son (3) Loves this movie! I Highly recommend it!! I was hoping it would teach him not to be afraid of Halloween but it didn't lol. He still loves it though :-),1225584000,,162,3.9393939393939394
3162680,4,B0016PWWUY,My 2 1/2yr old son loves this Dvd.  He is starting to repeat how to spell all of these words.  It's so..cute!,1222732800,,109,3.909090909090909
3162681,3,B0016PWWUY,"WordWorld is great, and the DVDs for my two-year-old are awesome. She says ""Woof"" when she wants to watch this DVD because Dog is so cute, and she spells along with the animated Build-A-Word sequences. The content is top-notch!

What I do have a very big problem with is the ""Hopla"" trailers that run automatically at the end of the WordWorld disks. It's pretty sneaky to piggy back another series for toddlers at the end of a series this good. It's just an unwelcome commercial, which I shouldn't have to deal with since I *bought* the DVD. I definitely DO NOT want my daughter to watch the inane Hopla series and would never buy it. Unfortunately, the jingle is permanently stuck in my head after hearing the first few seconds three or four times in the background before I could stop the DVD.",1219881600,9,795,4.559440559440559
3162682,5,B0016PWWUY,"This DVD is awesome.  The great literacy lessons continue...and these are some of the cutest WW episodes we've ever seen.  My kids love them, especially the ""monster maker"" music video at the end- so fun!

3162701,4,B0016PWWUY,"Good show for kids, my son is 3.5 and likes these.  I'm glad there are options out there that teach kids something.  I don't like letting him watch a lot of tv but he has actually learned a lot from shows like this.",1424908800,,215,3.9767441860465116
3162702,5,B0016PWWUY,Lots of fun!  Good for sounding out and spelling,1421020800,,48,4.333333333333333
3162703,5,B0016PWWUY,"My daughter loves WordWorld and I cannot get over how quickly she picks up on the sounds and spellings after watching these episodes. The ""building"" of words by putting the letters together provides a great way to memorize the words.  The characters are adorable and the working of the sounds and word families into the storyline is so natural and  creative all at once. The only thing that can bother me (and I am probably being too picky) is when the characters face the reverse direction and the spelling looks flipped (this isn't often & hasn't seemed to affect her learning of the words).",1417824000,,593,4.6923076923076925

3162715,5,B0016PWWUY,Seasonal WordWorld episodes are an added extra to a delightful children's series! I highly recommend the entire WordWorld Adventure series to anyone who wants to delight their children and grandchildren.,1409011200,,203,5.8
3162716,5,B0016PWWUY,I have run a childcare center for the past 23 years and WorldWorld is by far one of the best programs that has ever been made for children. It's adorable to watch and it is a wonderful teaching tool as well. Kids love it!!!!,1409011200,,224,4.113636363636363
3162717,5,B0016PWWUY,"My grandson Edwin (just 6 and starting school in Georgia [USA] today, 8-4-14), had wanted this DVD for a long time, so yesterday we sat down and watched it.  He is into Words by all means and did well on the spelling test I gave him after viewing this DVD two times.  It seemed to us that it did not last long enough, not long enough to curb the hunger for more.  It was well worth it!",1407110400,,385,3.9740259740259742

3162719,3,B0016PWWUY,"My 2 year old son is a huge fan of Word World and so Grandma bought this for him for a Halloween gift.  It has 2 episodes on it.  In the Halloween episode, Pig ends up with a sheet over his head and sleep walks, so he's like a ghost.  My son is actually unsure of it.  He will watch, but runs behind the couch from time to time.  We have many Word World DVDs, and this is one that I don't grab frequently.",1395964800,,405,3.7738095238095237
3162720,1,B0016PWWUY,There was a dvd in the case but not the right dvd. Granddaughter was disappointed and so was I. Wouldn't recommend this.,1395014400,,120,4.5
3162721,3,B0016PWWUY,Shows a couple of  Halloween episodes. Just wish the DVD was a little longer. Episodes did not seem to last very long.,1390435200,,118,4.363636363636363
3162722,4,B0016PWWUY,Really like all of the Word World DVDs. This was a hit with my son and his cousins. Great deal at under $6. The only downfall is that I don't think the DVDs last long enough. Would like to see more content on them.,1385942400,,214,3.8863636363636362
3162725,4,B0016PWWUY,"My kids love WordWorld and, unfortunately, our local PBS station recently stopped carrying it.  I went online to find some DVD's and decided on this one to start (I purchased this shortly before Halloween).

The kids loved it and, believe me, we watched it almost constantly.  However, keep in mind that this is just 2 episodes of WordWorld...it is nothing different from what would have been shown on TV.

But, hey, it kept my kids entertained while I made dinner and that's a win in my book.",1383955200,3,493,4.632183908045977
3162726,5,B0016PWWUY,"My son loves the word world DVD's and he loves the way the spell out words and he is learning quickly.  I play one dvd every day for a week while he eats breakfast and then switch to a different Word World dvd the next week.  Funny, he can actually read the words home depot from learning from the Word World dvd's.",1375315200,,315,4.064516129032258
3162727,5,B0016PWWUY,I ordered this for my 3 and 6  year olds. they love word world . we cannot hardly catch it on tv so I have ordered many dvds. great for the little ones,1370476800,,151,3.5757575757575757
3162728,4,B0016PWWUY,He has autism and likes this cd a lot. He watches it several times a week.  I will probably buy more of the series.,1369785600,,115,3.7916666666666665
3162729,5,B0016PWWUY,Have let others borrow it and they have been happy with it; slowly working my way through the episodes I bought.,1364515200,,112,4.380952380952381
3162730,4,B0016PWWUY,This was his FAVORITE.  We bought two because the first disc got scratched.  The second got scratched too and we had to throw both away.  We are probably not careful enough with the discs.,1363651200,,188,4.470588235294118
3162731,4,B0016PWWUY,"My son LOVES these, but it seems like the disc scratches easily because we had to throw away 4 of them.  We probably let him handle them too much.  Not a problem with other discs, but be careful with these.",1363651200,,206,4.125
3162732,5,B0016PWWUY,Bought for my grandchildren when they were ages 2 and 3 and and they are now 4 and 5 and they still love them.,1359158400,,110,3.625
3162733,5,B0016PWWUY,"My little girl has been watching wordworld since she was 11 months and enjoys it very much! She is 14 months now and she laughs, dances and trys to say words from the dvds. I would recommend wordworld to any child as it sounds out words and encourages children to interact. I have about 8 dvds and she loves them all.

I was one of those moms that my child would not watch tv, but when you are a working mom, these dvds come in handy while you are doing your house work. They are also getting an education at the same time.

Love, Love, Love WordWorld!!! Will continue to order them and will continue to order from this seller!",1358208000,,627,4.216666666666667

3162746,5,B0016PWWUY,"If you haven't seen Word World before, you are in for a real treat. The letters actually shape the words, so it helps prereaders to understand in a concrete way that letters form words. Additionally, this visual helps emerging readers to develop sight word recognition.  Kooky Spooky Halloween has two episodes. Both are fun to watch and I enjoy watching them with my kids.

I received this DVD to review. The opinions stated are 100% mine.",1349654400,,440,4.776315789473684

3162749,4,B0016PWWUY,I actually purchased this movie at a local toy store and I was sad when I found it for a lesser price here on amazon. I enjoyed the movie and my two year old is entertained by it. I am just disappointed that there isn't that many episodes within this disc. That is the most frustrating part. You only get two episodes instead of the normal four or five depending on the video you purchase. Still it is hard for us to find holiday videos that our daughter is into and this one she actually enjoys. So I still recommend purchasing it.,1317168000,,532,4.2254901960784315

3162775,5,B0016PWWUY,I bought this for my 4 year old son because we love Word World so much. It didn't disappoint! There's a new character in one episode and the others are the interesting and educational fun we've come to expect.,1271980800,,209,4.384615384615385

3162779,4,B0016PWWUY,"I really adore this entire series, which we discovered on public TV while visiting the United States with our kids.  Most of my previous ""nostalgia"" purchases (eg, Sesame Street) sadly tended to enchant me more than the kids, but this one seems to be more in tune with the groove of the modern toddler and as a parent I see that it has been a good support for vocabulary and spelling. Also, I love the Klezmer-inspired theme music.  When the disc is over and you have that playing in the background for ten minutes until you can get around to turning off the darn thing, this is an important criteria.",1257465600,5,601,4.454545454545454
3162780,4,B0016PWWUY,"This DVD contains two episodes of Word World that are seperated with a song about making a monster.  Both episodes are great; and I love that they both are Halloween episodes.  Most DVD's like this have one Halloween and then just a second episode that might vaguely take place in the fall.  Both of these are actual Halloween episodes.

However, on the DVD, when you hit ""Play"" the first episode plays, then the song, then the second episode, then commercials for other DVD's start to play.  The commercials seem, if you're not playing close attention, like kids' songs.  But they are actually commercials for other DVD's.  I don't like that I have to spring up the moment the second show is over if I don't want my child exposed to countless advertisements.  That's the reason I didn't give it five stars.

The episodes, though, are great and I would recommend this to a friend.",1255564800,3,880,4.662337662337662
3162781,5,B0016PWWUY,"""WordWorld: Castles in the Sea"" features four stories from the PBSKids program ""WordWorld."" The stories are """"Castles in the Sea,"" ""The Dancing Duck Bonanza,"" ""A Star is Born"" and ""Tick Tock Space Clock."" These stories are fine examples of the program, showing Duck and Shark learning to believe in themselves, how anyone can solve problems with some imagination and smart thinking and how to be a good friend to others. Along the way, they teach literacy and a love of words with fun music and songs and excellent humor.

Special Features:

- ""Ride the Slide"" Music Video and Scene
- Song selection for all of the songs from the stories featured on the DVD
- Message to parents from a co-creator of ""WordWorld""
- Trailers for other programming released by NCircle Entertainment
- ""A Star is Born"" Behind-the-Scenes-- plays the story with a storyboard reel running alongside it. Let's be honest-- I'm not sure how much anyone in the show's target audience is going to care about this, but for animation fans, this is a real treat.

All stories are presented in widescreen and closed-captioned (special features not captioned), 5.1 surround sound or 2.0 surround sound available.

Great DVD release on the whole. My only gripe is that the creators of the DVD for some reason were averse to including the closing credits for the program. What's that all about? Note-- this DVD is currently being offered as a part of a two-pack in many retail stores. The second disc includes a sampler of various programs released on DVD by NCircle Entertainment, including ""Will & Dewitt,"" ""Hooray for Huckle"" and ""Tiny Planets."" Or if you don't want it from the store you can also find it here at Amazon--&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/WordWorld-Castles-in-the-Sea-Front-Row-Fun/dp/B0026UV72C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">WordWorld: Castles in the Sea/Front Row Fun</a>",1251244800,6,1896,5.352348993288591

WordWorld has: catchy little tunes; creatures with normal, likeable personalities; and no value judgments, thank you PBS.  The Backyardigans seem to have run out of steam, but WordWorld is great.  We don't watch much tv, so we bought the DVDs.",1235865600,,455,4.8441558441558445

Each character (dog, ant, duck, pig, sheep, etc) is made up of the letters that spell it.  Each show is about 15 minutes long - just the perfect length to keep the smaller kids engaged.  My son loves the ""Build a Word"" portion that they do in each episode.  We are in the beginning stages of talking now, and this is definitely another conversation piece for that.  For the older kids it probably helps with spelling.  What a great show!  I definitely recommend! (another good one is Welcome to Word World)",1226448000,,644,4.308333333333334

What I do have a very big problem with is the ""Hopla"" trailers that run automatically at the end of the WordWorld disks. It's pretty sneaky to piggy back another series for toddlers at the end of a series this good. It's just an unwelcome commercial, which I shouldn't have to deal with since I *bought* the DVD. I definitely DO NOT want my daughter to watch the inane Hopla series and would never buy it. Unfortunately, the jingle is permanently stuck in my head after hearing the first few seconds three or four times in the background before I could stop the DVD.",1219881600,9,795,4.559440559440559

The ""building"" of words by putting the letters together provides a great way to memorize the words.  The characters are adorable and the working of the sounds and word families into the storyline is so natural and  creative all at once. The only thing that can bother me (and I am probably being too picky) is when the characters face the reverse direction and the spelling looks flipped (this isn't often & hasn't seemed to affect her learning of the words).",1417824000,,593,4.6923076923076925

I was one of those moms that my child would not watch tv, but when you are a working mom, these dvds come in handy while you are doing your house work. They are also getting an education at the same time.

3397272,5,B0016PWWUY,I bought this for my 4 year old son because we love Word World so much. It didn't disappoint! There's a new character in one episode and the others are the interesting and educational fun we've come to expect.,1271980800,,209,4.384615384615385

3397276,4,B0016PWWUY,"I really adore this entire series, which we discovered on public TV while visiting the United States with our kids.  Most of my previous ""nostalgia"" purchases (eg, Sesame Street) sadly tended to enchant me more than the kids, but this one seems to be more in tune with the groove of the modern toddler and as a parent I see that it has been a good support for vocabulary and spelling. Also, I love the Klezmer-inspired theme music.  When the disc is over and you have that playing in the background for ten minutes until you can get around to turning off the darn thing, this is an important criteria.",1257465600,5,601,4.454545454545454
3397277,4,B0016PWWUY,"This DVD contains two episodes of Word World that are seperated with a song about making a monster.  Both episodes are great; and I love that they both are Halloween episodes.  Most DVD's like this have one Halloween and then just a second episode that might vaguely take place in the fall.  Both of these are actual Halloween episodes.

However, on the DVD, when you hit ""Play"" the first episode plays, then the song, then the second episode, then commercials for other DVD's start to play.  The commercials seem, if you're not playing close attention, like kids' songs.  But they are actually commercials for other DVD's.  I don't like that I have to spring up the moment the second show is over if I don't want my child exposed to countless advertisements.  That's the reason I didn't give it five stars.

The episodes, though, are great and I would recommend this to a friend.",1255564800,3,880,4.662337662337662
3397278,5,B0016PWWUY,"""WordWorld: Castles in the Sea"" features four stories from the PBSKids program ""WordWorld."" The stories are """"Castles in the Sea,"" ""The Dancing Duck Bonanza,"" ""A Star is Born"" and ""Tick Tock Space Clock."" These stories are fine examples of the program, showing Duck and Shark learning to believe in themselves, how anyone can solve problems with some imagination and smart thinking and how to be a good friend to others. Along the way, they teach literacy and a love of words with fun music and songs and excellent humor.

Special Features:

- ""Ride the Slide"" Music Video and Scene
- Song selection for all of the songs from the stories featured on the DVD
- Message to parents from a co-creator of ""WordWorld""
- Trailers for other programming released by NCircle Entertainment
- ""A Star is Born"" Behind-the-Scenes-- plays the story with a storyboard reel running alongside it. Let's be honest-- I'm not sure how much anyone in the show's target audience is going to care about this, but for animation fans, this is a real treat.

All stories are presented in widescreen and closed-captioned (special features not captioned), 5.1 surround sound or 2.0 surround sound available.

Great DVD release on the whole. My only gripe is that the creators of the DVD for some reason were averse to including the closing credits for the program. What's that all about? Note-- this DVD is currently being offered as a part of a two-pack in many retail stores. The second disc includes a sampler of various programs released on DVD by NCircle Entertainment, including ""Will & Dewitt,"" ""Hooray for Huckle"" and ""Tiny Planets."" Or if you don't want it from the store you can also find it here at Amazon--&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/WordWorld-Castles-in-the-Sea-Front-Row-Fun/dp/B0026UV72C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">WordWorld: Castles in the Sea/Front Row Fun</a>",1251244800,6,1896,5.352348993288591

WordWorld has: catchy little tunes; creatures with normal, likeable personalities; and no value judgments, thank you PBS.  The Backyardigans seem to have run out of steam, but WordWorld is great.  We don't watch much tv, so we bought the DVDs.",1235865600,,455,4.8441558441558445
