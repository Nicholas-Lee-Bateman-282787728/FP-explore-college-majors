6290679,5,B00ISDJUYI,This is one of the best super hero shows ever. I would say it's on par with BTAS as far as overall production quality & writing goes. This show appeals to all ages and is a good entry point into the GL universe. I ony had a passing interest in GL berfore this show but now I'm hooked! That really speaks to how well put together this show is.,1393977600,12,342,3.971014492753623
6290680,5,B00ISDJUYI,"Preview 3/5/2014:
Warner rocks!  What a deal, the entire series, almost 10 hours. I bet they will have some great extra features. I can't even imagine how amazing this will look on Blu-ray!  The stories and character development was great.  It is really difficult to pull off the Seven Dwarf scenario in animation and they did it here. No one thought you would care so much about animated characters until Disney proved it with Snow White in 39.

Updated detailed review 3/22/2014:
Great taste, less filling ... in the extras.
This is my personal favorite series produced by Bruce Timm after watching Batman: TAS, Batman Beyond, Justice League and Young Justice. The characters are complex, the stories are varied and the dialog is witty with some good laughs. Warner kept up their standards by choosing great actors to really make each character unique. It may be hard to believe but this series bests Justice League for the depth and strength of the female characters. Green Lantern should have been a prime time series but was chosen by Cartoon Network to air in the morning. It is ""not rated"" but I would give it at least a PG since it has such intense action and adult themes.

Video:
Here is what you get. 1080P Stunning picture quality with a 3D feel to it and without the annoying aliasing that other animated features have. I thought it looked great on Cartoon Network in HD but that doesn't even compare to this. The colors are sharp and bright. The blacks are solid, deep and well defined.

Audio:
DTS-Master Stereo at 48 kHz. I guess the series wasn't produced in 5.1 so switch your receiver to Neo Cinema or Dolby Pro Logic II and enjoy. The audio is dynamic and when the surround encoder is activated you get dialog only from the center channel with surprisingly good balance and effects in the L, R, Sub and surround speakers. It sounded better than a lot of discreet mixes I've heard.

Extras:
No commentary and documentaries but ... no previews either! Each disc goes directly to a menu screen. The series is presented on 2 Blu-ray discs at almost 5 hours each. You can choose to play all or individual episodes with or without subtitles. Each episode starts with the series opening sequence, a brief ""previously on"" segment, chapters at commercial breaks and ends with credits. If you select the pop up menu it will highlight the name of the episode you are watching.

Summary:
I look at it this way: Warner Bros gave us a 9 1/2 hour Green Lantern story, presented in amazing CG animation, with adult themes and unique characters that you really get to care about; all for less than $25. Highly recommended ... so enjoy!",1393977600,30,2638,4.670258620689655

6290682,5,B00ISDJUYI,Excellent series was almost brought to tears great story telling. I never write a review but I had to Bruce timm is a genius and I am petitioning for a season 2 and 3 this series ended too soon. Sad sad sad. A must own!!!!!!!,1490572800,2,225,4.022222222222222
6290683,5,B00ISDJUYI,"As my other reviews show I'm a nerd and Green Lantern is my favorite hero. This show was great and had promise even though it was far from perfect it didn't deserve to get cancelled due to poor toy sales from 2011's movie. The CG is a little dated at this point, but for it's production time and budget it was great. The story was well handled, considering the restraints that they were put under. My fianc is not a GL fan but she watched the entire series and loved it (with her favorite of the spectrum being Larfleeze's Orange), my younger daughter also enjoyed it. I think the series would have been a success given a chance as only a couple episodes were less than good and everyone that actually watched a few episodes enjoyed it. The lack of special features included was no surprise and the menu layouts were simple.",1489190400,5,824,4.427631578947368
6290684,5,B00ISDJUYI,"Fun... well written... a thoughtful and engaging story. The design and animation are excellent.

6290687,5,B00ISDJUYI,"It took me some time to to acclimate to the computer animation, but the story line is solid.  Bruce TImm understands how to tell superhero story and manages to cram an amazing amount of Green Lantern lore into the single season series.

6290688,5,B00ISDJUYI,"loved this series, yes the animation is not up to the best by todays standards, but the story lines are interesting, and as they say in the anime, ""History is written by the victors"", which is not a concept that comes up often in these type of animation.

6290694,5,B00ISDJUYI,"I don't usually take the time to write out reviews or thoughts on my amazon purchases but I truly felt like it was needed with this wonderful and amazing series! I bought this on a whim thinking I may enjoy it, having grown up watching some other DC Hero animated series such as Batman The Animated Series, Batman Beyond and Justice League. I was slightly hesitant as I knew very little about the Green Lantern mythos and was worried that I would need to have that knowledge to enjoy the show. I was also worried that the show may be immature for someone in their 20s. I HAVE NEVER BEEN MORE WRONG. This show is amazing and I had to pace myself when watching so that I wouldn't binge watch too hard. Now that I have finished them, I am so disappointed that this show went off the air and if I could get one wish it would be for more episodes! I highly encourage any and all people to purchase this so that they too can enjoy this wonderful television show.",1467072000,2,956,4.258241758241758

6290699,3,B00ISDJUYI,"Green Lantern: The Animated Series is a two-disc collection of 26 episodes from the Cartoon Network series. The Green Lantern Corps patrols the galaxy, fighting evil. In the farthest reaches of deep space where few Lanterns patrol, a new evil is rising  the Red Lanterns. Hal Jordan and fellow Green Lantern Kilowog defy The Guardians of the Universe and board a new experimental spacecraft, the Interceptor, and race to the Guardian Frontier to confront the evil Red Lanterns. But a menace lurks beyond the Red Lantern invasion and Hal, Kilowog, and fellow Green Lanterns Tomar-Re and Aya discover an even greater evil that threatens to extinguish all life.

The Green Lantern (2011), a disappointing live-action theatrical feature starring Ryan Reynolds, tanked at the box office, but this series had better luck, even though it lasted only one season.  The story line is strong, and the characters are developed interestingly. Im not a fan of limited animation, but the art work does capture the colorful characters, both good and bad. Though Hal is the primary character, lots of attention is spent on Kilowog, Razer, Aya, and Atrocitus, with interactions among them well written.

DCs Green Lantern never achieved the superstar status of its Superman or Batman, but this series finally pays proper homage to a distinctive and often under-appreciated superhero. DC competitor Marvel has dominated the feature-film market but DC has had greater success with its animated series.

There are no bonus features on the Blu-ray release.",1455321600,2,1534,5.219512195121951

6290705,5,B00ISDJUYI,"My first experience with this series was catching the occasional episode on free-to-air TV, and it honestly struck me as kind of stupid. But tempted by the art design, I sat and watched the series consistently and got hooked.

Off in the Frontier Zone, someone is killing Green Lanterns. Hal Jordan, Earth's Green Lantern, and his colleague Kilowog discover the Red Lantern threat and are tasked by the Guardians of Oa with gathering intelligence. On their ship the Interceptor, run by an AI (dubbed ""Aya"" by Hal), they start their return to Oa, meetings friends and foes along the way. But the Guardians have not told them everything ...

I love the art design and music for this series, but it's the characters that kept me watching. Hal, the maverick pilot who is always ready to accept people and give them a chance; Kilowog, gruff and by-the-book, but noble at heart; Aya, a genuine personality who develops a mind of her own; and Razer, a Red Lantern who makes the journey from despair to hope. The voice actors are well cast and genuinely good, able to make moments of drama or comic relief equally believable.

The story arc for each half of the series is broken up by some standalone stories, but many elements that seemed to be over and done with are brought together in later episodes. While the overarching plot is gripping, some of the episodes along the way are less strong as you might expect in a series. There are quite a few clichs and plot holes, it's true, but for me they are well and truly outweighed by the strengths of this series. One thing that particularly struck me with the scriptwriting was the adult approach taken. Strong emotions are in play here, sometimes justified, sometimes not; and while there are times when the characters make good decisions, at others times they don't. It's refreshing, and realistic, too, to see characters struggling with situations where there are no easy answers. You don't have to be a Green Lantern fan to enjoy this, as the scriptwriters did a good job of making the core concepts of the Guardians-Green Lanterns easy to pick up.

If there is a message from this series, it is that hope is never wasted; anger has its value; and love and friendship matter most of all. I'm not a Green Lantern follower, so I can't say whether this is a good addition to the history/concept or not. What I can say is that I love this particular version and I am genuinely gutted that no more episodes will be made.

The DVDs are the bare minimum - just the episodes, no extras. Fine by me, others may be disappointed.",1448064000,,2565,4.616228070175438
6290706,5,B00ISDJUYI,"Great, Why don't the producers wake up and make more shows?",1447113600,,59,4.454545454545454
6290707,5,B00ISDJUYI,"AMAZING story telling as it truly explores the Green Lantern Universe.
Warner Brothers really dropped the ball by dropping this series.  It's sad that not everything is about making happy fans or great story telling.  Don't know what WB was expecting from this one that they didn't get that caused them to cancel it.  Heard it even had very good ratings.  But looking at their new animated movies, maybe this one was too smart.  (Seriously, the new stuff is dribble.)",1444521600,2,467,4.7875

6290711,5,B00ISDJUYI,Nice deal!,1441065600,,10,4.5
6290712,5,B00ISDJUYI,"First, let me say that I am not at all a Green Lantern fan.  Ive never read the comics, and the character has never appealed to me before.  I am, however, a huge fan of Bruce Timm and the DCAU (DC Animated Universe).  Batman: The Animated Series, Batman Beyond, and Justice League/Unlimited are my favorite animated shows of all time.  BTAS, in particular, had a huge influence on me as I started watching it at a very early age as a child in the 90s.

When I first heard about Green Lantern: The Animated Series, I wasn't interested at all.  Then when I heard that Bruce Timm was the executive producer, I thought it might be worth a try.  I forgot about the series for a time, until I stumbled upon it again on Amazon.  They had the complete series on Blu-ray.  I read a couple reviews, and on a whim I decided to purchase it.  The price was excellent for getting the complete series on Blu-ray, but I was really just taking a chance because I had never viewed an episode or talked to anyone who had.  That was possibly the best Blu-ray purchase I have ever made!

This series is fantastic.  I went into it pretty skeptical and not at all a Green Lantern fan.  All I really knew about GL was from what Id seen on JL/JLU.  The writing and dialogue is very sharp, the plot is solid, the characters are fleshed out and well developed, the music is epic, the voice cast is incredible, and everything is really top notch!  The cg animation and the designs are beautiful!  I wasn't sure if I would really like the cg, but it really grows on you and I have really come to appreciate it.

All this to say, if you haven't seen this yet, please give it a shot.  Im not certain but it seems like this show is underappreciated and I have no idea why.  Maybe people simply don't know about it.  If you like any of Bruce Timms previous work, you will LOVE this show.  Its maturity level and overall tone is right up there with the greats like BTAS, BB, and JL/JLU.  This is seriously, one of the best animated series of all time!",1440633600,2,2017,4.263852242744063

6290716,5,B00ISDJUYI,"I loved it! I watched it when it was on netflix originally. Eventually got this on blu-ray. Fun for all ages from 6 and above. Great on green lantern. It didn't get canceled because it wasn't a good show, it got canceled because toys weren't selling well (most stores still had toys from the not so good green lantern movie which made stores not to buy new toys until they are out of the movie toys). It is fun, adventure, something for adults as well. Great space drama, I say its fun for both girls and boys.

What you get by buying this? Literally it only has just the episodes and an option for subtitles. There isn't commentary which is unfortunate. But you get all the episodes on 2 disc. first disc covers the red lantern saga, and second disc covers the manhunters and anti monitor. hope this convinces you to buy it.",1433116800,,825,4.392156862745098

I then heard a few good things from it and then it was placed on Netflix, so I gave it a watch and don't regret it. Bruce Timm's fingerprints are all over it. The stories are well told and capture you in each episode. The characters are well fleshed out, and the voice actors fit them nicely, and what surprised me the most was the CG. It suited the series perfectly to the point that I couldn't imagine it without it. So I had to purchase the blu-ray immediately, the extras are good as well.

6290743,5,B00ISDJUYI,"First and foremost, this series is so much better than the live action Green Lantern it's laughable and everybody involved in the making of that film should sit down and take some notes at how you really do a production and set of characters right!  I'm not meaning to harp on the live-action version of GL but I just finished watching GLTAS and I was totally blown away!  It seems like anything Bruce Tim is involved with turns out amazing and with the serious lack of anything remotely interesting on TV and with so many disappointing ""blockbusters"" rolling out every day, it's really refreshing to be able to sit down and watch a series that is engaging on so many levels.  The last episode really leaves you wanting more...it's like a great book, you never want it to end but alas the series has ended and it seems it's ended permanently.  I REALLY hope that is not the case but this explains why I am totally confused and frustrated!  Why in the world would they only make one season of GLTAS?  I mean was it ratings, was it production costs...I don't think it's fair to the fans of the characters or the series to just stop!  I think people reading this review would agree they would love to see additional seasons made...as long as you keep the same people on the project to maintain the same quality.  At any rate, I hope my rant there doesn't turn readers off so let me reiterate, if you are a fan of animation, great story telling and wonderful voice actors then this is a must have for you!

6290744,5,B00ISDJUYI,It is too bad this show only had one season. It was a great quality show. I love most of what DC does. Too bad the WB does not have as much respect as they should for these properties. The Blu-ray was excellent quality.,1402099200,,219,4.0
6290745,5,B00ISDJUYI,"Very pleasantly surprised at this series due to the quality of production and numerous episodes.  Several of these episodes together would have easily constituted a movie.  I was hooked after just the first and had to watch all of them ASAP.  I hope there's a good continuation with more complex development, new characters (or better yet, meshing with the rest of the DC universe), and if possible somehow, elevated action levels.  But that last will be hard to do, considering how they pulled out a lot of stops already in this great series.",1401926400,,543,4.806451612903226
6290746,5,B00ISDJUYI,"If you loved Batman the animated series, you need this series in your life.

Produced by Bruce Timm (Batman:TAS), Giancarlo Volpe (Avatar:TLA) and Jim Krieg (Ben10), they gave us an engaging story that not only managed to introduce us to the Green Lantern mythos, but a full-fledged and fleshed out cast that audiences were eager to follow throughout the depths of space. I've been a fan of DC's animated series since I was a tiny elementary student, and I was/am utterly enamored with this show as an adult.

The thing that really stands out about this series for me is that the character relationships were so strong, and while Hal Jordan is undoubtedly the lead, the series does not ignore the rest of the crew and develops them all with excellent story pacing. Additionally, big support characters (Carol Ferris, Saint Walker, Ghia'ta, Sayd, Ganthet, etc) are given spotlight and contribute greatly to the overall story, shaping and guiding the development of newcomer characters like Aya (the advanced A.I and navigator of the GL crew's ship) and Razer (a Red Lantern seeking redemption).

In the 26 episode run, the show managed to cover a great plethora of themes and moral lessons with intelligent, and fairly enlightened respect while still being clear enough for children to understand--something greatly missed in a lot of today's children's programming.

It is so wholly unfair the the failure of toy sales from the live action film, not in anyway associated with this feature, helped to doom this excellently crafted story. I can only hope that the network executives and appropriate higher ups revisit this show and give it the extended run it truly deserves.

On a final note, while I and many others will agree that this show was ended before its time, it does not mean that the story itself suffers from an abrupt/jarring ending. While it will definitely leave you wanting more, the series does come full circle to give a satisfying and hopeful conclusion.

Treat yo' self--give this series a watch and then show your support!",1401840000,2,2043,4.941690962099125

But this series was absolutely amazing! well written, the graphics were great and Hal Jordan was not as annoying as DC has decided to make him in every other series. he's actually likable. Like I said, Hal, Guy, and Kyle do nothing for me...More the John Steward type myself, but the stories were fantastic. Razor, Kilowog and Aya were great stories themselves. I absolutely loved it on bluray. My kids get the dvd now!",1401580800,,520,4.788888888888889

If you love Green Lantern or hate him this series shows even the biggest hater that Green Lantern is one of the best comic book characters to ever exist. You might call me a fan boy. I am. You will be too after you finish this season of the show. The movie was not anywhere near this good. If they were to re do the movie they could learn a lesson from this series.

6290749,4,B00ISDJUYI,"First off, the animation for this series is really good. Almost like a theatrical feature more than a cartoon series. The episodes move along at a good pace and look amazing. I think the stories could have been stronger if they followed the original comics more closely, with some stories set on Earth instead of space or other planets. That's the reason for 4 stars instead of 5.",1400457600,,380,4.602941176470588

I am a big Green Lantern fan and waited thirty years for a cartoon series.  And the work that Bruce Timm did on this series made it well worth the wait.  My only disappointment is that they did not carry on with the second season, which was supposed to have been an adaption of the Sinestro Corp War.
Truly my favorite of the episodes released would have to be ""Love is a Battlefield.""  The battle between Carol Ferris and Atrocitus is totally awesome.  And the episode gives the viewer a strong insight into the feelings that Hal Jordan and Ferris have for each other.
One other item I can say about the Green Lantern series is that it really did get better as it went along.  And the continuous introduction of characters made the series even more interesting, such as Guy Gardner, Tomar Re, Ch'p, Sinestro, the Anti Monitor, the Steam Lantern, Saint Walker, Brother Warth, and Larfleeze.
This is a series I cannot recommend enough to both Green Lantern and Bruce Timm animation fans. Truly amazing.",1400457600,,1167,4.6911764705882355

It may have only got one season before it's untimely cancellation, but it did more in that season than a lot of shows have in 7. There's no fillery episodes and the the pacing is well timed. A must for any Green Lantern fan. A must for any comic book fan. Heck it's even a good, easily understood show for non comic lovers.

It showed them the beauty of real emotion. It showed them the hardships that can come from life along with the greatness of it.

I would like to thank Giancarlo Volpe and all of those who worked on this series. It is and will go down as some of the greatest story telling in the history of animation. Do not stop creating greatness. Keep bringing the beauty of life and imagination to all of your future projects. Don't give into cooperate thinking. Strive to be better; no matter what you work on.

However, as soon as I actually took the time to watch the show, I was won over easily and totally enthralled.

The characters are a lot of fun and the stories are always engaging. Perfect for any kid who loves super heroes or anyone who just loves great storytelling. It's a shame no more stories will be told in this universe. The writers and animators did an amazing job bringing it and these characters to life.

It's a shame that it was canceled, but every cartoon fan owes it to themselves to watch this series.

They manage to evoke so much pathos for the characters without the show ever losing its sense of adventure and fun.

I caved and bought the separate volumes on DVD a few short months ago, but I can't wait till i have a few spare bucks to upgrade to Blu-Ray. The show was stunning broadcast in HD and I'm sure it will only look better on disc.

And that is such a shame.

So when I saw that the entire series was available on Blu-ray, I jumped at the chance to add it to my collection.  I'm giving this purchase 3-stars instead of 4 or 5, because this is a very basic edition.  Be aware if you are thinking about buying this edition of the series release that it is simply the episodes...no extra or deleted scenes, no episode commentaries, no actor, producer or director interviews...no bells nor whistles.  This is just basic episodes.

I'm not sure if I would purchase a more ""complete"" edition of this Bruce Timm gem if it were released, but I know I wanted this series as part of my collection.  Something so basic may not be everyone's cup of tea, but if you love this show and have been hoping for a complete release of the series...this is it.",1397260800,10,1045,4.350515463917525
6290775,5,B00ISDJUYI,"When this series was announced, I was skeptical at first.  The character of Green Lantern has had a bumpy road in adaptations, and the quality has had its ups and downs.  That, coupled with the fact that the series used CGI animation instead of 2D made me doubt its quality.  Then again, Bruce Timm was producing, so I decided to give it a chance when I could.  It took a while, for different reasons, but I got to see a couple of episodes, and I was instantly hooked.  I purchased the Blu Ray and watched the entire thing in a few days (I had to stop myself to watch it all in one go), and I'm ashamed I ever doubted it.

The Blu Ray contains the entire first and (sadly) only season of the show, for 26 episodes total.  The series is divided into two discs, which separates both major story arcs within the season, 13 episodes each.  The series doesn't follow the continuity of any of the previous iterations of Green Lantern, neither in the Superman/Justice League cartoons, nor the two animated movies, nor the unfairly maligned (but far inferior to this series) live-action film.

There's no origin story in this series, so I'll offer a brief synopsis.  The Green Lantern corps are an intergalactic peace-keeping force, comprised of members of different species throughout the universe, led by a race of ancient aliens called the Guardians of the Universe.  Their only weapon is a power ring capable of creating constructs of hard light, allowing each Green Lantern member to materialize out of pure energy any object they can imagine, making imagination almost the only limit to their power.  The ring's energy comes from a lantern (hence the name), and they must be recharged periodically.  The energy that stems from the lantern comes from willpower, which is harnessed and stored inside the Central Power Battery in the planet Oa, home of the Guardians.

Hal Jordan is an aircraft test pilot on planet Earth, who is unexpectedly summoned to the crash site of an alien spaceship.  Jordan was summoned by the alien pilot's power ring.  The pilot, a Green Lantern named Abin Sur, was mortally wounded and, as procedure requires, he sent his ring to find a suitable successor, someone with powerful will, and the ability to overcome fear.  Jordan is then given the ring, and he becomes the Green Lantern of sector 2814, a portion of space which includes the Solar System.

As the series starts, Jordan has been already a member of the Green Lanterns for a while, and he's summoned to planet Oa in order to respond for some ""less than orthodox"" behavior (quite normal from him), and sees himself inmersed into a plot to assasinate the Green Lanterns.  When the Guardians forbid him to investigate, he steals a powerful spaceship which allows him to travel much faster than by himself and he's joined in the trip by his mentor, friend and fan-favorite Kilowog, and the spaceship superintelligent AI, whom Hal dubs ""Aya"", and seems more than just a machine.

In his travel, he discovers the Green Lanterns are the target of a powerful hidden organization called the Red Lanters.  They also have power rings, but these are powered by rage.  The Red Lanterns are led by the evil Atrocitus, who wants revenge against the Guardians because he claims they destroyed his homeworld (I know, I know... Sinestro, Atrocitus... the Guardians should really name-check whose jimmies they rustle).  One of the Red Lanterns, though, one named Razer, is not really an evil man, but Atrocitus' speechs fuel his rage due to a great loss in the past, so he fights our heroes.  Later, when the Red Lanterns show their true colors, Razer reluctantly joins the Green Lanters in their quest.

The first story arc of the series deals with stopping the Red Lanterns, the second one with stopping the Anti Monitor, a threat to all existence who controls an army of relentless robots called the Manhunters, robots created by the Guardians but decomissioned when a failure in their programming led them to kill all living beings instead of protecting them.  The show does a good job of ending the first arc in a way that's both open and closed enough that each story arc could be considered its own season, but both are still heavily connected.

On to the show's qualities.  The visuals are simply spectacular, specially with the quality of the Blu Ray release.  The animations are extremely well done, the visual style and art direction are fantastic, the action scenes are impressive and there are moments that are so visually striking that you'll swear you're watching a movie with an enormous budget.  The storylines and characters are extremely well crafted, as the series does a fantastic job of drawing from the extensive and rich universe of the comics while adding their own original ideas, characters and twists.  The series does not shy from emotion, which is important in a universe in which emotions grant so amazing powers.

The voice acting is also top notch.  You'll be drawn into these characters, and the great voice acting helps a lot to believe in this universe, as the voices give life to the characters who are constantly growing throughout the series.  The series gets better with each episode.  The more you familiarize with the universe and its characters, the more daring the series becomes, taking risks that pay off while respecting the source material, for which the writers clearly have a great amount of love.

In short, there's nothing not to like about the series.  The Blu Ray release has a couple of small details, though.  The first one is that there are zero extras.  You'll get only the episodes, and that's it, not even a trailer.  The other one is that the language options are limited to English.  English audio and English subtitles, which, by the way, are not perfect, as sometimes they will have some very noticeable mistakes.

The language thing is very unfortunate, because this series would benefit extremely from more exposure.  Heck, I'd buy ten copies if it had spanish subtitles, because then my non-english speaking friends might be able to watch it.  And this is really a shame, because it's a fantastic series, and it's practically a crime that it only got one season.  The finale has good closure, it's left open but it doesn't end in a cliffhanger, yet it could have been so much more.  There are many more stories to tell in this universe, and it's a terribly missed opportunity that the series was canceled.

What else can I say?  Buy this series.  Buy several copies and distribute them among your peers.  Teach them English if you have to.  More people need to see this and, hopefully, one day it might continue.  That will be the brightest day.",1397088000,6,6679,4.7785527462946815

6290777,4,B00ISDJUYI,"Warner Archive brings ""Green Lantern: The Animated Series"" to Blu-ray in a two-disc set. Another of DC Comics' Cartoon Network properties to get canceled before it even ramped up, the collection includes all 26 episodes. Its death was contributed to poor toy sales from the live-action movie, although I don't really know why that should've affected a completely separate television show. Fans of the Emerald Knight can now celebrate knowing they can watch it any time they want in the comfort of their own home.

""Green Lantern: The Animated Series"" follows Hal Jordan as he assists the other Corps. members in keeping the Universe safe from the Red Lanterns and other cosmic adversaries. The rebellious Lantern teams up with fellow member Kilowog and take off into space to face danger head-on instead of waiting for it to strike. They're aided in their missions by the artificial intelligence and heart of their spacecraft, Aya.

The episodes are presented in a 1080p High-Definition 16x9 (1.78:1) video format and DTS-HD 2.0 sound. The video is clean and the colors are vibrant. The audio brings the CGI animation to life through bombastic sound effects, clear dialogue, and an admirable musical score.

Consumers will no doubt be disappointed in the lack of any special features for ""Green Lantern: The Animated Series."" I would imagine Warner didn't want to sink any more money into something that was already over with. It's a shame we didn't get any ""Making of"" featurettes or interviews with the voice cast or production crew.

""Green Lantern: The Animated Series"" is a perfect example of an entertaining show dragged off the air way too soon. In the world of television, if there's not enough demand from audiences it doesn't matter how exceptional the program is. It's all about who's watching each week. If you never took the time to check out this series, now is a perfect opportunity.",1396483200,2,1898,4.996835443037975
6290778,5,B00ISDJUYI,"As a life long Green Lantern fan this is in my opinion the best representation of the character outside of the comics. In fact I think it's my favorite comic book inspired series, movie or television, ever.

This blu-ray release includes all twenty six episodes on two multi-layer disks with the Red Lantern arc on disk one and the Anti-Monitor arc on the second. The two-part ""Beware My Power"" episode is included as two episodes rather than including it as one double-sized episode that was aired as a special preview on the Cartoon Network some months before the show began it's regular airing. There are no special features or audio commentaries which is not surprising as there were none on the DVD editions and Warner Archive is not known for adding new material to what is essentially and archival release.  I would have loved to have seen inclusion of the original test footage that was shown at the 2010 New York Comic Con but alas that's not to be.

While Warner Brothers didn't add any new material they at least updated the menu a bit from the ugly menu system that they used on the DVD's.  The option is there to watch the entire disk in one sitting or you can access any given episode individually. One thing I was glad to find was the lack of advertising on either disk - not one trailer to be found, not even for the show itself!

Visually the blu-rays are stunning and look much better than either the DVD release or the digital HD downloads that are available from Amazon or a handful of other venues that offer them. The colors are brighter, the blacks are blacker and the animation is sharper, almost coming across as 3D. This version of the series really demonstrates what CGI brings to the table, but whether or not you'll notice the difference will likely depend on the equipment you have. Generally speaking the smaller the screen the less you'll notice the difference between DVD up-scaling on a Blu-ray player versus an actual Blu-ray disk. On my son's 32 inch set it looked a little better, but on the 55 inch set in our family room their was a considerable improvement. I actually noticed some details and subtleties that I hadn't noticed before.

Audibly the DVD's Dolby Digital audio has been replaced with DTS Master Stereo which won't matter much to a television's built in speaker, but for a surround sound system or soundbar the upgrade elevates the gorgeous Frederik Wiedmann score to new levels.

Considering that the DVD's will likely run you same amount money it's a great value and it's quite frankly the best version of the series that we're likely to ever see. Despite already owning the series twice over I have no regrets in showing Warner Brothers how much I appreciate the show by buying it a third time. Green Lantern: The Animated Series is an amazing show and in my completely biased opinion it's the best DC animated series to be released so far. Bruce Timm, Giancarlo Volpe and Jim Krieg produced something spectacular in these 26 episodes that stands as a complete story which leaves fans satisfied with what they've been given but sad that the voyage of the Interceptor was cut short way too soon.",1396137600,2,3149,4.663063063063063
6290779,5,B00ISDJUYI,"First of all, I know almost nothing about Green Lanterns except the little knowledge I knew about John Stewart from watching Justice League and Justice League Unlimited on Saturday mornings as a kid. The movie with Ryan Reynolds (seriously?!) really put me off from watching this series, and I just want to kiss all the people that pushed me into watching this because I never could have been even more wrong in my entire life. I fell in love with the show, the characters, the scenery, and the animation. I'm really picky about 3D animation and usually dislike it but this is GORGEOUSLY DONE. Each of the characters move in an unique way and have excellent facial expressions to get their emotions across to the point where words aren't needed. It's a ""show, not tell"" type of television that recent children's TV shows have been lacking. I have never been so upset that this show was cancelled from Cartoon Network, deprived of a second season. Regardless of its short life, it's a good series to show to kids and adults alike, full of lessons (nothing too preachy I promise) that I remember from my childhood Saturday mornings. I still hold hope that this series will be picked up for the second chance it deserves. That all being said, I don't own a Blu-ray player, but I will buy one just because I own this, and because I want to see it all over again in high definition.",1395792000,3,1377,4.578947368421052
6290780,5,B00ISDJUYI,"This is another great animation that was canceled before its time just because it didn't sell enough toys. It didn't matter that lots of people loved it. All it mattered is that it didn't sell as many toys as expected. How long until the rest of the world understands what Japan has figured out long ago: Cartoons, ARE NOT ONLY for kids anymore. Animation is simply another way of telling a story, it doesn't dictate if it's adult of kid oriented. Here's a tip: resurrect shows like this and the new Thundercats (which suffered the same fate), air them on prime time, get some sponsors and make your money just like the other shows do. Seriously, have you checked most of the teen oriented ""adult"" shows lately? These animations wipe the floor with most of them.",1395705600,2,762,4.610294117647059
6290781,5,B00ISDJUYI,"But, I had to give this show the five star rating it deserves. I'll admit, I was skeptical when I first started watching, but any and all uneasiness was put to rest by the end of the first episode and I enjoyed every minute of the series several times over on TV, on DVD(yes, I also bought those), and now on the Blu-ray quality that it's beautiful characters deserve.",1395705600,2,368,4.3478260869565215
6290782,5,B00ISDJUYI,"I've been reading Green Lantern since the early 1980s and let me tell you, these 26 episodes are everything that I could have ever dreamed of in a Green Lantern cartoon. It's a massive epic story involving Hal Jordan, The Red Lanterns, Larfleeze, The Star Saphires, Guy Gardner, The Anti-Monitor, Kilowog, Tomar-Re, and even Ch'p! (Although I notice they don't call Ch'p by name. Is there a rights issue?) And somehow they subsume the plots of Crisis on Infinite Earths and Zero Hour while they're at it!

I had no idea this was such an amazing show when it was on the air, and it is a tragedy that it's been cancelled. But we have this perfect run of 26 episodes. There's not a weak one. It's the greatest GL epic ever in any format!

I notice a strong Star Wars influence, especially the stronger elements from the prequel trilogy. It's what we've been saying all along the GLC concept was begging for.

They even make a John Stewart/ Jon Stewart joke! ""The fake news guy?""

This completely makes up for that sub-par Green Lantern movie.",1395619200,36,1039,4.56989247311828
6290783,5,B00ISDJUYI,"To say I was ecstatic to learn that this stellar series was receiving a Blu-ray release is a gross understatement.

One of the best superhero shows since the Justice League series, Green Lantern: The Animated Series [GLTAS] is an epic adventure. With seamless writing, profound characters, excellent voice acting, beautiful animation, and a memorable soundtrack, GLTAS is on the level of Avatar: The Last Airbender.

The Blu-ray does absolute justice to the quality of the show. High definition visuals and sounds combine to create the best audience experience. Everything is clear and pristine (unlike the DVD releases). This release is English-only with English subtitles, and there is an option for episode selection. Other than that, the Blu-ray is pretty sparse in terms of special features. Personally, I would love to see any and all behind-the-scenes extras added, but I am happy enough to have a HD release of this amazing show!",1395360000,13,937,5.198675496688741
6290784,5,B00ISDJUYI,"I want to make one point very clear:

I loathe Hal Jordan as a character in every incarnation I have ever read or seen him in.

Except this one.

This series took a character that I truly do not like and turned him into one that I found myself enjoying a lot. But Hal is just one piece of this gorgeous puzzle. What makes this series truly wonderful is the ensemble. Razer, Aya, Kilowog, are the heart of this show. And it is such a shame that just as they were about to embark on an epic quest and become stronger, the series was cut short.

This show exceeded every expectation I had for it, tenfold.

Get the blu-rays here while they're hot, Fanterns! Let WB know that this was something we wanted and is profitable.",1395360000,10,719,4.257352941176471
6290785,5,B00ISDJUYI,"Both Green Lantern the Animated Series and Beware the Batman needed these Blu-Rays! The 3D rendered animation just looks so much better and crisp in HD. Whereas there is no extra behind the scenes content, it doesn't matter because this double disc packs 24 amazing episodes into one set.

GLTAS is just an sci-fi, emotional, action-packed thrill ride taking the viewer on a crazy ride! I loved this series so much, and hope fora season 2 or even DTV.",1395360000,3,451,4.708860759493671
6290786,5,B00ISDJUYI,"This is one of the best animated series ever made (regardless of whether you're a Green Lantern fan), and it was produced in HD. I have no idea why it took so long for the show to hit Blu-ray, but I'm glad it's finally here!

Sure, I already bought the DVD's... but in this case, I'm willing to repurchase.",1394841600,10,306,4.186440677966102
6290787,5,B00ISDJUYI,"Bruce Timm (DCAU) and Giancarlo Volpe (Avatar: The Last Airbender) team up produce one of the greatest shows that Timm has ever worked on (just behind Batman: The Animated Series and Justice League).  I was wary of this show at first because it was CGI'd but this show is fantastic.  It's a shame it got canceled so early, but at least it appears to be getting a worthwhile release.",1394668800,28,382,4.521739130434782
6290788,5,B00ISDJUYI,"""Green Lantern: The Animated Series"" (GLTAS) finally gets what it's been so greatly deserving for awhile now: a Blu-Ray release! I love this show so much, and now I'll be able to enjoy it in amazing Blu-Ray quality! Thank you Warner Archive Collection for making this happen. I only wish I could give it more than 5 stars, but this rating will have to do (now all we need are more seasons of this great show and everyone will be even happier)! :D",1394496000,14,446,4.385542168674699
6290789,5,B00ISDJUYI,"I don't post many reviews, but I am SO excited about this I had to speak up.

I originally started watching GL:TAS because the maker of the original ""Batman: The Animated Series"", Bruce Timm, was an executive producer.  What I saw BLEW ME AWAY!!  In this current age of ultra-frenetic, barely digestible, uber-specialized animated shows, this one harkens back almost immediately to the well-arced classics.  There are two main plots to this collection, and I don't want to give anything away, but both are exciting, hilarious, and often heart-wrenching.  I was hooked after the first episode.  It weaves in classic characters as well as introduces fully formed new characters.  It also has a visual style that is simple, clean, and almost iconic - very much like Batman or even the Superman animated series.

It also is one of those shows that didn't get the respect or fair chance it deserved (I'm looking at you, Cartoon Network/DC Nation!)  While I'm glad it even GOT a DVD release, this Blu-Ray is going to preserve a truly beautiful, intelligent show in its proper, hi-def glory.  Good work, Warner Home Archive!",1394064000,68,1117,4.925133689839572

8645005,5,B00ISDJUYI,"I have always been a fan of the Green Lantern, and the Lanterns are incredible, though to some degree underrated.  This series came out at a time when a lot of good shows got canned; Tron: Uprising, Young Justice, Wolverine & the X-Men, just to name a few.  Apparently all of these shows,despite excellent plots, suffered from a lack of toy sales, but I digress.  This series starts you off with the discovery of the Red Lanterns, as the Green Lanterns are unaware of their existence.  Their discovery and ultimate plot take our heroes on an adventure that literally spans the galaxy.

Season two introduces new villains, and digs deeper into the origins of another Corps in the spectrum.  This series is simply amazing.  If you are a DC fan, and yet still a GL fan, this series is for you.  Although it only made it two seasons, the story is well written, the characters are spot on, and the action is worthwhile!!",1517270400,,915,4.570552147239264
