8351296,3,B0025X4PHO,"In The Silent Code, Kane Richmond stars as Northwest Mounted Police Corporal Jerry Hale who is transferred to an outlying district where he meets up with an old girlfriend, Helen Brent (Blanche Mehaffey).  Helen's father, Nathan Brent, is away prospecting for gold and has left the management of a trading post to his unscrupulous partner Peter Barkley.  When Barkley finds out that Nathan Brent has struck gold he sets out to steal it before Brent gets back to the trading post.  In his attempt, however, Barkley shoots Nathan Brent, and then manages to pin the murder on Corporal Hale.  Now Hale must find a way to prove his innocence. This is a very short film with a run time of about 45 minutes.

In Man's Best Friend, Jed Strong has to put up with an abusive father who can't stand the boy's German shepherd, Lightning (Lightnin to Jed). Lightning sires a brood of pups and spends his time protecting them from Jed's father who tries to destroy them.  Meanwhile a bear has been roaming the area and picking off piglets from the family farm.  Jed's father accuses Lightning of steeling the piglets and sets out to kill the dog. The run time for this film is about 58 minutes.

Both films were made in 1935 and have suffered from the effects of time.  There is a background hiss and parts are quite faded.  They are watchable, however and the puppies in the second feature are cute.",1243814400,,1386,4.597560975609756
