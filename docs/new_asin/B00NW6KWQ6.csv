6682993,2,B00NW6KWQ6,"Not what I was hoping for in a Sam smith dvd. I am aware it is titled about the making of Sam smith, but I didn't expect cheesy documentary music/narrative and random cuts of multiple radio interviews... That's pretty much all it was. Good info, but maybe as a special feature on a concert DVD. Not good enough on its own.",1419379200,7,322,4.295081967213115

8680721,4,B00NW6KWQ6,"Sam Smith...You're incredible! Your Story is amazing, I just wish the Film had more of your music or your singing in it. It got a bit boring just hearing the same old interviews, but at least your smile and your laugh kept me entertained. I'll be looking forward to another DVD that will be more properly established with better quality and much more of your beautiful voice singing and or with your live performances. :)",1424476800,,421,4.626666666666667
8680722,2,B00NW6KWQ6,"I love Sam Smith, but all of this was  basically  interviews that ive seen/you could see in YouTube..",1422835200,4,101,4.555555555555555
8680723,4,B00NW6KWQ6,I love Sam Smith.  Some nice interviews with him and you get the chance to see a little bit about the person inside.  But no music of his whatsoever was included.  I would have enjoyed some clips of some of his performances.  If there had been I would have given 5 stars.  He is an amazing performer.  Would see him over and over if I could.,1422748800,3,341,4.090909090909091
