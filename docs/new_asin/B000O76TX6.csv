8183285,4,B000O76TX6,"I love New Zealand, I love coming-of-age movies, and I'm approximately the same age as the main characters (that is, I went thru adolescence in the '70s), so it's inevitable that I liked this movie-- you might remove a star from my rating for each of the above points you disagree with. This is an interesting, highly original film with some beautiful cinematography and fine performances by the principal actors, particularly Andrew Paterson. That said, it's an imperfect film with several glaring weaknesses-- a plot that tends to jump around and leaves some major issues unresolved, some clunky dialog, and (especially) a dreadful soundtrack that wrecks several otherwise-good scenes. The outer space fantasy sequences also didn't quite work for me, but YMMV. Still definitely worth a look if you like this kind of thing.",1437523200,,824,5.156716417910448
8183286,4,B000O76TX6,This film was just ok to me. Probably would get better reviews from a younger audience. That said the storyline was very good. The coming of age also quite realistic. Challenges facing kids and confusion about sexuality very much portrayed honestly. Stories about abused kids turning bad is very sad but too many times a very strong reality. Acting by the young people in this film was actually quite good!,1364774400,,406,4.814285714285714
8183287,4,B000O76TX6,"Stewart Main's production is a coming-of-age story that bears little resemblance to other typical and predictable movies. 12 year-old Billy idly watches a TV show with his best friend, a rather tomboyish girl who excels at boys sports and acts a bit manly. Inspired by what he sees on TV, Billy wears a fake ponytail and pretends to be Lana, the heroine of the sci-fi series while Lou, the girl, poses as the male hero. They subvert traditional gender affiliated roles as part of a game, but they are also aware of a certain otherness, a certain counterpart that can exist only in private.

The figure of the double, largely described in fantastic literature, is usually developed when the main character fails to recognize his own-self, and starts experiencing a feeling of alienation. The double can adopt several forms, as for instance the form of the exact replica of the character, like in Dostoyevsky's ""The double"", or on the contrary, it can become the form of an absence of reflection in the mirror image, a horrifying 'presence' as in Maupassant's ""Le Horla"". Clearly Billy and his friend Lou find an ideal refugee in the form of fictional characters that supply that which they are lacking; Billy is a boy that wishes to be a girl, and Lou is a girl that wishes to be a boy.

In this scenario, two other characters will help develop the dynamic of the double. First of all is Roy, the new kid in the school, who soon becomes attracted to Billy. A most revealing moment takes place when Roy is picked on by kids that held him to the ground, as a consequence of all this roughhousing, the young boy exhibits an erection that soon makes the other lads lose interest in him. This moment is defined by the emergence of sexual excitation in Roy's penis, an irruption of the drive of the real in his body; such pulsations also exist in Billy who stays behind and accepts Roy's invitation to touch his ""stiffy"".

Do they experiment joy only through phallic exploration? The phallus has no image, the absence of representation in the visual field ""signifies that in everything that is imaginary localization, the phallus appears in the form of a lack"". As the days go by, Billy is not acquitted of guilt, but nonetheless he decides to join his friend Roy in a shack, wherein they mutually masturbate. But why does Billy seem uncomfortable after these sessions? Perhaps because if the phallus 'is characterized by a lack', then any image would only 'mask' that lack, evoking something which is absent, and in principle one can define that absence as something that pertains to our bodily existence in so far as what is missing in the virtual image is our real existence itself. In the same way Billy can never truly be Lana, from the TV show, he cannot envision his acts with Roy except in the darkness and secrecy of the shack. But what part of our anatomy permits the distinction between oneself and one's own image, including the multitude of others with whom we tend to identify? It is this distinction that seems to get distorted and somewhat effaced in the phenomenon of the double.

The second important character in the story is Jamie, a guy in his twenties. As soon as he enters into the scene, Billy seems to forget all about Roy. He now starts daydreaming about this guy, this strange adult that could eventually pay some attention to him. But before Billy can get closer to Jamie, he must first decide if he should adopt the male or the female position, which is basically the same decision Lou has to make. As the relationship with Roy deteriorates, new problems will arise. The double, again, could signal the coming of ominous events.",1318032000,,3650,4.6806853582554515
8183288,4,B000O76TX6,"This is a coming out story of sexual awakenings and learning set in New Zealand during the long hot summer of 1975. Billy is 12 years old and is best friends with his tomboy female cousin. She is assertive, macho and good at rugby - all the things Billy is not, despite the fact that his Dad was `nearly an All Black.'

Roy then arrives from Dunedin (which for trivia fans is named after Edinburgh!) and is immediately targeted as an outcast ""The Freak"". But he sees in Billy a kindred spirit and attempts to build a friendship. It seems to be going slowly in the right direction and then Jamie turns up to help out as the 'new hand'on Billy's Dad's farm. Jamie is hotter than Satan's Bar B Q fork and as such Billy who is still trying to work out what a `poofter' really is, immediately feels attracted. Jealousy lies, upset and all the tribulations of growing up ensue. Needless to say I do not wish to spoil the plot. This is a nice little film from NZ and has won three awards, but it is more about sexual awakenings and growing up, but posts itself more as a gay comedy and it really isn't.

It also has some day dream asides into Billys alternate Universe where he appears to be some sort of inter galagtic hair fettishist, but that never really gets developed, if you want sci-fi humourous asides then I strongly recommend the shamefully ignored 'Gentlemen Broncos'Gentlemen Broncos [DVD]

This is a 12 cert as it `contains moderate sexual behaviour'. That said I did enjoy this and always want to encourage independent film makers in all their efforts, hence the 4 stars. It is no where near as good as the book, which is sadly often the case with films, so I can undersatnd the negative reviews, but I found it quite entertaining.",1302566400,3,1739,4.462264150943396
8183289,1,B000O76TX6,"I really had high hopes for this movie. A clever cast, gorgeous cinematography, and great attention to period detail. Where it failed me was the main character, Billy. Likable enough at first, he revealed himself to be just as unsympathetic and cruel as any of the other bullies in the film!

This film would have been ""fabulous"" were it not for the callous way the character ""Roy"" was betrayed and simply thrown under the bus.

Look at the plot from another view: A sensitive, talented and parentally abused gay teen (Roy) falls in love with a bullied, overweight and very feminine farm boy (Billy) and is summarily rejected because it's ""weird"" that he'd love a bullied, overweight and very feminine farm boy. Roy is simply dismissed without sympathy and we never learn what happens to him. Shoddy work, I must say.

I had a lot of hope for this film, and was very disappointed. So much could have happened, but the filmmaker chose the path of least resistance. The title should have been ""50 Ways of Being a Big Fat Gay Jerk.""",1302048000,,1029,4.642857142857143
8183290,3,B000O76TX6,"Shot in and around the central Otago communities of Omakau, Ophir and Alexandra, this coming-of-age film centers on overweight 12-year old

Billy who is not interested in being a farmer and doesn't care for Rugby. His escape is the fantasy world of the TV show, Adventures in Space where he dreams about playing the heroine Lana. Of course all this doesn't make him the most popular with his school mates, but his tomboy cousin Lou buffers those problems. Into his life comes two new boys, Roy and Jamie that are destined to provide the catalyses in changing Billy's life. Recommended.",1170288000,,585,4.85
