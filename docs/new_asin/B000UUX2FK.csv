8635679,5,B000UUX2FK,"I love watching Galaxy Angel. Personally, I think that this season, AA, is one of the best in the entire history of the show. It has adventure, comedy, excitement, and is sure to make anyone laugh. The story takes place in the future and is about a group of five girls who defend the universe with their smarts, beauty, and Emblem Frame space crafts. And along the way, they encounter Lost Technology that gets them into trouble in every episode. Hilarious and one of the best anime that I know!",1368662400,,495,4.511111111111111
