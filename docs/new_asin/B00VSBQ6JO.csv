7101331,5,B00VSBQ6JO,"Just to be clear for all who see this: This is the English version released in the West by Aniplex. The extreme similarity to the Japanese cover can throw you off, but if you look carefully you can see the title in English on this cover- The japanese version does not have this.

You can find in depth reviews of the movie elsewhere; Chances are, if you're here, you at least know what this is; The next part of the series Puella Magi Madoka Magica, that takes place after the original Anime TV Series.. There are a few extras on the disk (Commercials and the like), and a few commentary things I didn't bother looking at, but nothing amazing. That being said, the quality of the animation is great, the English Dub is actually very good (While I haven't listened to the whole thing, the scenes I have seen are very well done on the part of the VA's).

Price wise it is a bit up there for what you get, but that is unfortunately par for the course with Aniplex.",1439942400,8,961,4.303867403314917
7101332,4,B00VSBQ6JO,"If you liked the TV series then you don't want to miss this movie.  But there are plenty of places on the web/print media that can tell you more and in a more interesting manner than I ever can, so I just want to leave a few words about the actual product.

As usual you get a deluxe package from Aniplex, but slightly different.  The box case is more like plastic and has all this glitter that doesn't come out in the photos provided... very funky indeed.

The box set comes packaged in a higher grade thick plastic wrap than usual, and it can be taken off without breaking it since its folded and held at the back by a piece of sticky tape.  If you are one who doesn't care for it then rip it apart any way you like, however if you wanna keep it as pristine as you can then don't undo the sticky tape since its a bit of a bastard and will ruin the plastic wrapping when you try to undo it.  I recommend you use a hobby knife and cut the tape under the fold.  You'll know what I mean when you see it.  Another option is to cut a slip along the side where the discs come out.

The set comes with a very nice booklet.  However, don't read the introduction before watching the movie as it spoils the first 40 minutes.  There are only a few pages of art gallery, and the rest of the booklet contains these arty/poetic descriptions of characters in the nightmare/witches world.

The on-disc extras as usual are pretty poor.  You get the usual textless credits and trailers; there are nine 12 trailers in total however there are only basically 2 different ones.  You get nine versions of one and three of the other.  The only interesting extra is the Collaboration Manner Videos (Monogatari Series x Madoka)...... Now what the hell is that you may ask?  Well, it's five mini cartoons lasting around 2 minutes each which have 'cartoony' characters from the Monogatari series telling the audience what not to do (smoking, talking etc) during the presentation of the film.  These were obviously show at the theatre before the movie started and are amusing.  That's all I'm afraid.

So, is this set to you worth the high price?  Only you can answer that question and no one else.",1432425600,2,2170,4.3775
7101333,5,B00VSBQ6JO,"Madoka Magica the Movie: Rebellion is the direct sequel to the TV series, or the two recap movies.  It picks up at some unspecified time (presumably fairly shortly) after Madokas transformation into her ultimate form, where she changed the fate of all magical girls, became The Law of Cycles, and disappeared from the world, forgotten by everyone but Homura.  So why is she in this movie?  Why is Sayaka present?  Why does Kyouko go to school with the rest of the girls?  Why cant Kyubey talk?  And where are the wraiths that I expected the girls to be fighting?

The movie expects you to pick up on all these things which aren't quite right.  It starts off basically re-playing the events of the first episode of the series, but with lots of differences, which quickly add up to everybody is way too happy!  Homura eventually realizes this, and starts searching for answers.  Shes fairly certain everyone is supposed to be miserable, and shes going to fix things.  Sayaka even blatantly confronts her about the inevitable outcome of her quest to set the world right, but Homura just won't listen.

It starts out a bit slow in the first act, builds momentum in the second, and crashes head long into psychedelic hallucinatory overdose in the third.  Rebellion is a wild ride, and I thoroughly enjoyed it.

Lets break it down:

Animation:  9.5  You can really tell the budget for this show was much higher than the series.  The animation is head and shoulders above the series.  Everything is so detailed, crisp, and beautiful.  The series used the witch labyrinths to showcase some outstanding and heavily symbolic imagery.  It was one of the aspects which made the original stand out.  We get more of that here, and perhaps a bit too much.  Akiyuki Shinbo has gone completely ballistic with the symbolism and imagery, to the point of sensory overload.  If you are like me and want to try to take it in to the maximum extent, you will find yourself pausing, rewinding, etc., trying to figure out what you have just seen, and what it all means.  This overdose of imagery is really the only negative I can find with the art of this movie.  Its definitely an eye-popping extravaganza.

Where the original series story was told with 80% actions/dialogue and 20% visual symbolism and metaphor, you get a complete reversal here.  Rebellions story is told, perhaps as much as 80% in visual symbolism and metaphor, and only 20% through character dialogue and action.  Get ready to watch this again, cause there aint no way you are going to take all this in on just one viewing.  If you have ever seen the Beatles Yellow Submarine movie, with all its bizarre, and highly symbolic imagery, you are in for a similar ride, but I feel like Akiyuki Shinbo has taken the legacy of Yellow Submarine and, standing on the shoulders of giants, he has achieved his masterpiece.

Sound:  9.5  Yuki Kajiura has knocked it out of the park once again.  This soundtrack is very original and memorable.  Clara Dolls, Mada Dameyo, Flame of Despair, etc.  Some songs here will definitely get stuck in your head, and you won't mind it at all!  Still, I cant give it a 10 since I do like the music from the original series better.  Take a movie that, visually, would be amazing with no music at all, and add music that I would listen to without any movie to associate it with, and what do you get?  Pure cinematic magic.

Also, I just got my pre-ordered copy of the English dub (collector's edition) today (Ive watched it subtitled at least three times previously) and I have to say I am extremely pleased.  Maybe its just me, but Madoka doesnt sound as much like Squid Girl as she used to (Christine Cabanos voiced both characters).  Actually I felt like Cabanos did a great job as Madoka, and the entire cast did a fantastic job reprising their roles.  The translation was extremely faithful, with a few exceptions, all of which I felt were improvements (let me explain before you take up arms).  Subtle changes were made during the pivotal scene where Homura and Madoka are in a field of flowers, talking around the issue of Madokas decision to become the Law of Cycles.  Many fans completely missed the fact that this conversation fully justified (in her mind) Homuras actions at the end of the movie, and the dub does a much better job of conveying that idea.  Also, Kyubey is used exclusively as an exposition fountain near the end of the movie, explaining to the audience what has been going on behind the scenes.  This explanation seemed to flow nicely and was easier to follow. The glaring exception to all this is the Cake Song.  I wish they hadn't had to translate it.  The English dub of the cake song just didn't have the same feel.

Story:  9.0  Its very hard not to compare this to the original series Perhaps impossible.  Still, while it may be fair to compare the music or the animation to the original, Rebellion lacks the running time to compete in the story area, but wow, what they did in the two hours they were given is still outstanding.  Some have criticized the story for taking too long to get going, but I absolutely enjoyed the feeling of suspense during the first act; a feeling that only a Madoka Magica show can produce.  To paraphrase another reviewer (http://kotaku.com/the-new-modoka-magica-movie-is-the-sequel-you-never-kne-1453844468#), its fantastic that watching five girls having fun and eating cake can inspire a feeling that something is horribly wrong!  Its also a fun ride following Homura as she realizes the world is not as it should be and searches for the reason why.  And the ending!  You will either hate it or love it.  I haven't found anyone yet who wasn't totally polarized by the ending.  Im firmly in the Homura did nothing wrong! camp.  After all, when the series ended, she was the only magical girl whose wish had not been granted, and after everything she went through, she earned that ending.  Bought and paid for.  And before you say that her actions overrode, or disrespected Madokas wish, remember that Madokas wish overrode Homuras.  Turnabout is fair play.  When you sell your soul for something, and you don't get it, its time to go to extremes.  At least in my opinion.

Characters:  7.0  One drawback of having to fit everything into a two hour run time is that you get a lot less character development.  This is Homuras movie, and she is the main character, and the focus of any and all development.  It works well if, like me, Homura is your favorite character, but if you are looking to see more of any other character, you may be a little disappointed.  Still, Homuras journey from meek to powerful, from stable to demented is a ride worth the ticket price.

Overall: 8.7  Not as epic as the original series, but how could it have been?  It has been said that the series did not need a sequel.  When a show has such a solid ending as Madoka Magica, adding new content is usually a recipe for disaster.  Everyone hopes that the unnecessary sequel will be more than just a bid to make more money off a successful name.  This new chapter of the Madoka Magica story is definitely not resting on its laurels.  Every time I watch it I get something new out of it.  Its not that I like magical girl anime, which I usually dont, its that I love good story telling, and I have never seen better.

I got the limited (collector's) edition, which came with a small art book, soundtrack CD, two postcards, Blu-ray and DVD.  The book does provide a lot of interesting info, especially detailed descriptions of the Clara Dolls.  I wouldnt recommend the collector's edition for the average viewer, as $70 (when I got it, I see the price is up a bit now) is pretty steep for what you get (Its Aniplex, so expensive is the norm.)  But for me, it was worth it, since I am actually a collector and will eventually get all this stuff signed by the cast.  Still, the visuals are incredible, so Blu-ray is the way to go, collector's edition or not.",1430265600,10,7967,4.626695217701641
8711043,1,B00VSBQ6JO,"This is a review on the movie itself. Ok so where on earth should I start. I liked everything until half way through the movie where Homura was starting to act like the most annoying person and the ending made no sense what so ever. This my friends became a move on making more money and for fans to wait an excruciating long time until another one comes out. I'll tell you why. So you would think after everything that happened Homura would be a whole other different person and she was in the beginning of this film but later she becomes a lone wolf so to speak. Which is fine but then she got more fussy and annoying that it made me wonder where did this version of Homura come in. The version of Homura was I'll admit a little annoying but she became so much better. Yet now they bring in one that is more annoying.

Also another point I want to bring up is the ending. First if you haven't seen this movie I apologize I'm about to bring up a spoiler. Homura going insane then becoming the devil by stealing Madoka's powers is sooo stupid. It makes no sense why Homura would do that you would think she would be happy and would've let Madoka do her thing then live happily ever after. That happened in the manga but not in the movie why because money maker people and look how long it's taking them to develop a movie. Also like I said this ending and how it came about made no sense and really pissed me off. Homura stealing Madoka's power? WHAT?!?????!!!!!! How in the world did that happen? Last I checked you couldn't steal powers from a god or goddess. Yes somehow Homura stole Madoka's powers who is by definition a goddess. Makes sense? Not to me no. I waited to see if they would make a come back but I waited 5 years and still nothing. Also I give up on this series if you all see this review please don't watch this movie just stick with the other movies unless if you want to experience the same pain I went through.",1518307200,,1931,4.233062330623306

8711048,1,B00VSBQ6JO,"This is a review of the movie, not the BluRay.
I love Madoka Magica.  In just 12 episodes, the series creators crafted a beautiful story with a solid emotional core that carried it to a gripping, moving, and ultimately satisfying end.  This movie, Rebellion, does its very best to undermine and destroy that emotional core, completely altering key character motivations that drove the original story.  It feels like bad fan-fiction written by someone who only read the Wikipedia synopsis of the series.  The plot is driven by several major twists that not only contradict established character traits and motivations from the original series, but which also make no sense in the context of Rebellion's own story up til that point.

Madoka Magica is a solid, self-contained story that doesn't need a sequel.  If it left you wanting more, cling to that feeling.  That melancholy longing is so much more satisfying than the 'more' that this movie offers.",1465344000,4,951,5.019108280254777
