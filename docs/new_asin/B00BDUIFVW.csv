8566771,4,B00BDUIFVW,"Death Penalty.com  and Death Penatly.com A New Beginning , are two twisted films that explore the possibility of getting  revenge through anonymous means.

The first story involves Ryuta, the manager of the Honey Bee  call girl service. During the film, he works for an overbearing boss who pretty much treats him like dirt. As far as his boss is concerned, Ryuta is a low-life  loser, who's main purpose is to accept calls from customers and then send out the Honey Bee girls on jobs. Ryuta carries out his duties, but in reality, he hates his job and his boss. He has little choice though since he has huge gambling debts which must be paid off. He eventually ends up on a website called deathpenalty.com where he gets more than he bargained for. The film takes some interesting twists and turns until it reaches the end, I won't spoil it for you.

The second film seems to be of lower production value in general.  In it, the main character is a female game tester named Mio. She's actually part of a test group for a internet video game called, you guessed it, DeathPenatly.com. During the film she and several other debuggers, as they're called, try to work out the kinks and problems in the game before it goes online. Like the first film, twists and turns occur creating some tense moments. Things sort themselves out in the end, and we get more information on how the game got started in the first place.

Overall these were pretty disturbing films in the sense that you can be targeted anonymously by anyone who may have a beef against you. That being said, Ryuta wasn't a character that you feel much sympathy for. Although he was the protagonist, he was a flawed individual and he lived in a seedy world. The horror aspect, if any, would be  the unsettling nature of the game.  I viewed the film more like a crime story with horror aspects thrown in. But deathpenatly.com was probably the better of the two films overall. The story was better, as was the production value. And there were definitely several  plot twists to keep you guessing.

The second film, while not as developed as the first, still had some interesting elements added to it. For one, the characters weren't as shady as the characters  in the first film. And Mio turns out to be a fairly decent heroine in the end. She  grew on me after awhile. There's also another character named Kana, who brings the story together and sheds some interesting light on the creation of the game.

The tech aspects of the films include a Japanese soundtrack only with English subtitles along with a few trailers of other films. No other features appear.

Overall I'm giving this double feature compilation a 4, although I'd say it's more like a 3 1/2. The first film created several tense moments while still peaking my interest with mystery thrown in. The second film was weaker in general, but still maintained the soundtrack level of the first.  It also added more likeable characters in my opinion. They were characters I could actually root for, in some cases. A good rental, if not a purchase, for people who enjoy J-Horror films that don't rely on ghosts or the supernatural. It might make you afraid of what people are doing on the internet though.  Especially when it comes to you. Better not offend anyone out of the blue, if you get my meaning.",1383264000,3,3319,4.625212947189097
8566772,4,B00BDUIFVW,Death Penalty.com and Death Penalty.com A New Beginning are two of the most intriguing horror movies that I how seen come out of Japan yet. This DVD is definitely worth your money.,1368230400,2,180,4.65625
