7934348,5,B000059YSC,"Given that I was a dancer for 15 years, my muscles had the elasticity required for this level; this workout is perfect indeed for a person who has been trained in the Italian and Russian techniques as I have, and could be ideal for every person who is willing to put in the hard work necessary... all you've got to make certain is that you have had an adequate warm-up prior to getting to the challeging portions of it (do not skip the first, seemingly easy exercises). Even for an ex-dancer, this workout offers a great stretching and superior upper-body workout session, and, combined with a cardio workout twice a week is ideal for those who want leaner and longer muscles. In addition, the above is perfect for a person with injuries.  Speaking from experience, and since I have been an instructor myself and know anatomy and physiology, I have edited the exercises to meet my individual needs (I have torn cartilage on both knees, and extensive muscle/tendon/nerve damage to my right ac shoulder joint).
Last, but not least, Stott is also pleasing in terms of music/superior instructor-movement and technique, proper sequencing to avoid injuries, etc.  It would be a great tape for instructors of Pilates, as well as for somebody who is interested in working out privately and at home.",1257120000,,1290,4.832579185520362
7934349,4,B000059YSC,"Wow, what a workout.  It's all the basic pilates exercises, but w/ a twist.  It's very challenging & you will definitely work up a sweat.  I usually skip the very beginning until when she starts the hundred.  It really pushes you so by the end, I usually screaming at her.",1197417600,2,272,4.38
7934350,5,B000059YSC,"I highly recommend this tape to anyone who wants to do pilates.  Initialy I was skeptical because the first few minutes of warmup is very boring, but she soon moves on to more challenging exercises, especially a lot of variations of V-sits.  Also, initially I was reluctant about the length of the video (~50 minutes), but since she moves from one move to the next, the time passed quickly and she doesn't waste time sitting around.

Stott is very clear about cueing the moves, including when to inhale/exhale.  She demonstrates very good form, with good lines/angles, always in control of the moves, and fluid motions (i.e. no jerking or flinging).

I would recommend this to anyone who is looking for a challenging Pilates routine (or non-pilates people who want to cross train).",1160870400,4,781,4.886363636363637
7934351,5,B000059YSC,"I have little more to add that hasn't already been stated quite eloquently in prior reviews.  This is a truly superb and challenging video.  My wife and I have noticed exceptional toning and definition, as a result of this particular regimen.  Our only hope is that Moira will come out with another similarly advanced version.  If you're seeking relatively quick and superior results, then this video should certainly meet your expectations.",1104710400,12,441,5.169014084507042
7934352,5,B000059YSC,"This is a good workout, I liked the fact that the pace is moderate comparing to other advanced pilates workouts (especially the classical pilates technique), which give you more time to concentrate in your moves. The warm up in the beginning is a little bit boring, but never mind .",1076889600,10,282,4.66
7934353,5,B000059YSC,"I have been doing pilates for several months now and this is exactly the workout I have been looking for.  Although, I must admit that I do skip the first 10 minutes of warming up and start at the pilates one-hundred.  It is challenging and I enjoy the variety of exercises on this tape.",1065830400,11,287,4.296296296296297
7934354,5,B000059YSC,"This tape is without doubt the best advanced pilates tape you'll find.  Moira is inspiring, and reminds you exactly when to breathe throughout the most difficult exercises (she doesn't seem to be having any trouble herself...).  Definitely get the intermediate video, which is also fabulous, if you don't have prior experience with Pilates.  She moves fairly quickly through pretty tough stuff.  Otherwise, you will get the most bang for your buck out of this tape.",1046822400,14,465,5.16
