8534986,2,B00934A360,The original film is not great to begin with but this VHS dupe is a pretty poor copy. To make matters worse the copy of the original movie poster with great art by Neal Adams used on the cover is a badly retouched version. I think the VHS release is even better than this. Probably til they come out with a better resolution dvd you would be better off just getting the original VHS tape.,1355616000,5,388,4.1866666666666665
