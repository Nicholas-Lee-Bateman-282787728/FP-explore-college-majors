8432760,2,B004KDYR7U,"these are a not very compelling pair of movies about a not very compelling group of people doing not very compelling things on what should have been a wonderous journey. They spend an inordinate amount of time waiting for the ice to freeze. when it finally does, they rush outside and spend a goodly portion of screen time playing a not very compelling game of ball hockey. i think a weddel seal was off to the side. in between all their sitting around saying ponderously not very interesting things about climate change and when is the ice breaker is coming because that is their last chance to escape, each of these movies features most of the film time on the boat and each other.

this is the one Antarctica movie you'll wish ran short. Attenborough they are not.

at the end, you will feel sad. not because it's over, but because they spend so much time preaching in the boat that it's all people's fault without even giving enough shots of penguins to make it even marginally worthwhile.
