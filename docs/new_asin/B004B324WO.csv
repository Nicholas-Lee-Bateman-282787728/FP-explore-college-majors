8421313,5,B004B324WO,Very funny romantic comedy.  Sally Hawkins is a great actress.  Her best performance yet was in Persuasion for Masterpiece Theatre.  The actor playing the groom of the other girl was adorable playing a neurotic but funny bridegroom. Must have comedy.,1369180800,,250,5.2
8421314,3,B004B324WO,"This is an Irish movie. It has some slapstick in it which made me laugh. It is a romantic comedy. I enjoyed it for the most part, but found it uneven. I don't like revealing story-lines which in this case could take away from the watching. Made for a fun evening.",1362614400,,263,4.176470588235294
8421315,4,B004B324WO,"Got this movie as a gift, it was really funny. My husband got it for me because i starred as an extra in it but my part was cut out but i still had a lot of fun in it. I would recommend it to my friends and family and anyone who likes a good laugh.",1343174400,2,248,3.4464285714285716
8421316,4,B004B324WO,"Romantic comedy, physical humor, oddball characters and crazy situations make for a fun go at English/Irish humor.

The movie starts with a two, formal weddings with all the goofball players, relatives, side storylines occuring, simultaneously,  at a beachside resort, but what exacting is going on with those weddings and with whom, is yet to be determined.  Like a Shakespeare play, all is not what it appears.

The main characters portrayed by Sally Hawkins(Jane Eyre, Persuasion) and Tom Riley(Lost in Austen) are the bride and groom to be- but not to each other.  They soon become quite entangled, especially against his best wishes, with each other by accident, by numerous, hilarious encounters, and perhaps by a growing attraction.

We love both these actors: Sally Hawkins has wonderful, natural comedic skills.  In the extras, she describes this movie as 1950's Cary Grant screwball comedy- full of pratfalls, embarrassing set-ups, and a touch of romance.  She has the most expressive face and makes great use of it, and the hero has one of the best 'put upon, confused' looks you'll see anywhere.

If you liked, ""What's Up Doc?"", you'll love this European milder version.",1317859200,4,1182,5.146596858638744
8421317,4,B004B324WO,"This is a delightful Irish comedy set in the Dublin - Bray areas. The actors and the people they portray are authentic. The movie depicts all that could go wrong with a wedding reception and beyond, leaving no stone unturned as to ""what could go wrong now"". In the mist of total chaos, the film maintains a charming dialogue among bystanders. Also the movie highlites that you can find true love in some of the oddest circumstances. Well worth the viewing!!!!",1300838400,6,459,4.679012345679013
