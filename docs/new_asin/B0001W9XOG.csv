8016814,5,B0001W9XOG,"A poignant, powerfully made movie about a elderly street poet in New York City. Deeply eccentric but also filled with wisdom from his difficult life experiences, he brings meaning to his own life and the lives of those he touches by sharing his poetry with Central Park passerbys. I recommend this film highly; you will be truly moved and inspired by it!",1116633600,,354,4.725806451612903
