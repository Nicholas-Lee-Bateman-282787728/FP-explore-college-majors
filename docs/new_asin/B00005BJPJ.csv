7937656,4,B00005BJPJ,"This series was pretty average in the first 2 volumes. This DVD has 3 episodes on it. The 1st 2 being ok, the 3rd being great. I won't spoil it, but there is a plot twist in this volume that shakes the foundation of the series to it's very core. In episode 1, Meifon Li and Ksoei journey alone into enemy territory to fight against a Tao Master. In episode 2, Valeria is approached by a man from her past. Her allegiance to Angel Links is put to the test. In episode 3, Meifon Li's ""Uncle"" hires her to guard him. In a battle with Gordon's troops, she learns a very disturbing secret about herself and her past.

This DVD was really good at the end. I was feeling a bit disappointed with this series up until now. For the most part, it was pretty average. It think that the final volume is set up to be great. The bad thing is, the series is almost over. It's too little to late. But I'm still glad I watched it.",1359244800,,912,4.094972067039106
