8757922,2,B01E77673A,"A kids Saturday morning show produced by Roy Rogers production company. Don't set your expectations too high. To make it worse, the video quality is very bad. If you can't find it anywhere else, it's fun to have.",1472688000,,212,4.605263157894737
8757923,5,B01E77673A,"Excellent DVD. While ""Witch Bear"" is available on several DVD/Box sets, this is the first time I've seen the other three episodes on this DVD. Good transfer, considering the rarity of the show. Definitely good for a family-oriented evening of classic TV.",1472428800,,254,5.071428571428571
