7872257,5,6304463278,"I was new to Amazon - so missed the first time around to do this - ooops
I  e-mailed Mr. Jackson directly though - to say ""Thank You"".

It was a nice surprise to find this item - as it's been a while since it's been out.
It was another surprise to get this within a day or so of ordering it! WOW - what service.
It was in ""Brand New"" condition - still in un-opened plastic. My copy played perfectly.
The second copy I ordered was a Christmas gift - which was also in perfect condition and played fine. Was very much enjoyed.

Glad to have the chance to add my comment - finally.

Thank you.",1393545600,,590,4.017094017094017
7872258,5,6304463278,"When i was young, I used to watch Rescue 911 all the time and repeatedly get nightmares, but as I grew older and more fascinated by emergency management, I was looking for a copy of the show to be able to watch again--and since the main series is nowhere to be found in it's entirety, I thoroughly enjoyed watching this VHS.",1356134400,,324,4.327868852459017
7872259,2,6304463278,It was not the TV Series I wanted.  It had rescues alright.  But William Schatner was not narrating it and the Rescue format was different.  I was not happy with this product.,1348272000,6,175,4.40625
7872260,3,6304463278,"This is an interesting video, but without the personality and narration of William Shatner, the stories lacked the excitement and drama of the TV show Rescue 911. The best story on the entire video was the last one about the Charles Stuart case. This one story was well done and fascinating. The story took place in the United States while the others rescues took place in: New Zealand, Russia, Austria, and Belgium. All of these were slow-moving and protracted. Although I enjoyed watching the stories, I would not buy the video if I had it to do over again. I thought I was getting the TV shows, but this is a remake Of Rescue 911 footage.",1259884800,8,641,4.5344827586206895
7872261,5,6304463278,"A spectacular conflagration in New Zealand, where a tanker truck engulfed in flames traps a 12-year-old girl; a car in Belgium with 4 passengers, hanging only by a trailer hitch from a tall bridge; an Austrian skier who fell through the snow to a subterranean glacial river...

These are some of the captivating situations featured.  Watching the successful rescue operations unfold, one can't help but admire humanity's selfless propensity to save its most helpless victims.

The final segment captures an odd twist: a high profile Boston murder defined futility.  One of the critically injured, who was saved after immense efforts, turned out to be a prime suspect, and he later took his own life.  Perhaps there is no greater danger than a man's own guilt.",1138665600,3,759,5.04
