8193452,5,B000PUAIDO,"My kids LOVE this series of movies. They are ages 5 and 2. I thought they wouldn't be as big of a hit with them as they have been since they are not animated, but I was wrong! The content is right on point with the scripture stories and my kids have really learned from them. They are cheesy and have lots of singing and dancing, but that is what my kids love the most. They try and copy their dance moves and the songs are so catchy that it isn't just my kids that I hear singing them throughout the day. Wish they would make more of them!",1481414400,,540,3.963302752293578
