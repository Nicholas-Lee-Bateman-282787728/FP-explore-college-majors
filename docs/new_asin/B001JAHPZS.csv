8312210,2,B001JAHPZS,"This would be pretty cool if they actually released this. This is the first season of the Seventh Doctor. It's not very good, but if they released more complete seasons that are better that would be awesome. Overall I would give this season 2 stars. The stories included are:

Time and the Rani - 3 stars
Paradise Towers - 2 stars
Delta and the Bannermen - 1 star
Dragonfire - 3.5 stars

The average is 2.375, hence the rating.
