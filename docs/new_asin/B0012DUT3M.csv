3087015,5,B0012DUT3M,"Let me start off with saying that I have never seen an Uwe Boll picture before entering the theater last Friday night.  I have heard that there are many people in two very fervent camps about his pictures and aptitude.  I am not one of them.

Action is a genre and it takes the archetypes of a particular community and builds characters around them.  Because we file in for the visuals in these films, the script requirements are terrifically simple and rooted in the most extreme of polarities.  Action is one of the leanest genres as it distances the archetype from the character very little so we can recognize, at first glance, the side this character stands on.  In other words - the bad guys are dark and scary, the good guys are noble and wear white.  In this case, they're farmers who speak poetically of the days of old whilst harvesting with their blond and cherubic son.  It is cardboard and that is what it needs to be.

I was totally unprepared for In The Name Of The King: A Dungeon Siege Tale.  I went for the bizarrely assembled cast, though I expected the film to be painful and plodding.  To my surprise I found the extension of a time old, cheap-o Hollywood lineage.  ITNOTK:ADST is a direct heir to schlock films like Cobra Woman and all of those insipid, plaster biblical epics. It casts its spell with overtly simplistic dialogue and a soundtrack which lambasts you into emotional compliance.  But so thrilling is its emotive force, that I could barely breath outside of those gasps the film demanded of me.  It is aligned to cause no confusions - the good are majestic and the bad, either dark and void, or in Ray Liotta's case, palpably so in floor-length leather.

Those gasps, it is fair to mention, did not emit from any of the graphic sequences.  The film looks to have been made for pennies - down to the wan film stock.  No, this is a textbook study in emotional ebb and flow.  What Leni Riefenstahl would have crafted, were she not so artful.  From the opening moments of Statham's Thoreauvian sonnets while tending the land, to Ray Liotta's perfected baddie-hamming, this picture is a cornerstone of the dunderheaded.  Matthew Lillard and Lele Sobeieski duel, for God's sake!  Sure, it is a direct rip on the Lord of the Rings pictures, but it's liberation from creativity allows the story elements free reign to indulge to their furthest potential.  I find it hard to believe I'll have a more fulfilling experience in theaters for a number of months.",1200355200,6,2483,4.621004566210046
3087016,1,B0012DUT3M,"This is a multi-starred film and most of them are minus stars but Burt Reynolds toupee gets 5 stars.  If he actually had hair this is what it would look like.  But Reynolds only gets one star for his death scene which was the talkiest I have ever seen and displayed some of the worst acting and direction I have seen in any movie since the 1950's sci-fi thrillers.  Ray Liotta is a fine actor but he is terrible in this film.  While evil can be dressed in beauty he is overdressed and unconvincingly evil.  He can't sneer, frown, grimace, or provide any convincing evidence that he is actually bad -- he can't even make love convincingly -- so he gets one charity star.  The lead actor -- Stratham aka Farmer -- actually showed a voice inflection which was his demonstration of his acting skill which was otherwise non-existent.  His male pattern baldness was realistic so he gets two stars for realism but only one star for acting or non-acting as the case may be.  The mud-people -- aka the Krug -- were ridiculous.  They would have been better off using zombies rather these creatures left over from Lord of the Rings. Fortunately you never got a close look at these monsters because they would have been so ridiculous they would not have been believable -- wait -- let me think -- they WEREN'T believable.  The dialog (aka screen play) was idiotic and bordered on campy -- starting with the name of the main character -- ""Farmer""  I almost laughed out loud when that was announced.  Of course his fighting skills were supernatural which I guess were necessary to offset his acting ability.  The battle scenes were so poorly photgraphed and had so many jump cuts that it caused vertigo and really didn't give you any feel for the actual battle.  The female character Muriella was very politically correct and given some very politically correct lines and then wasted.  Rather than give her the role of Joan of Arc - they simply dressed her up in armor and that was her contribution to the plot.  The female tree sprites -- or whatever they were -- were peace loving anti-war females who had some of the most politically correct, anti-war lines in the movie and that seemed to be the only reason they were included.  The irony of them tossing aside their pacifism to battle the Krug was not noted so their only purpose was to deliver their anti-war philosophies and then go to war -- sort of the war to end all wars -- they were pointless distractions outside of providing the screenwriter the opportunity to articulate his philosophy.

The only actor that actually contributed to this film was John Rhys-Davis but his part was too little too late to provide any coherence to this mess. Burt Reynolds -- why was he in this film?  He seemed to have mailed in his performance because to call it wooden would be a courtesy.  Partly it was the dialog he was given which was idiotic, his motivations were missing, and he pranced around without actually providing any regal presence and his death scene was the worst I have ever seen in any movie EVER!!  The director of this film should be drummed from the academy and sued for malpractice along with the screenwriter.  So plot one star, personal hygiene minus one star (no one ever bathed or shaved),acting one star, wardrobe one star, direction minus a star, screenplay minus two stars.  This film was not screened for critical review and after seeing it I know why -- AVOID THIS FILM.",1200096000,13,3434,4.6118421052631575
3087017,2,B0012DUT3M,"""In the Name of the King: A Dungeon Siege Tale"" is Uwe Boll's most ambitious film, which is probably why it's also one of his worst. Here's a story that wants to be an epic fantasy but completely skimps on the epic part--the remaining fantasy is occasionally enjoyable at best. The battle sequences are small-scale and oddly claustrophobic, the characters are broadly drawn, and the dialogue is some of the dopiest I've ever heard. I suppose it would have been too much to expect something more, given that this is a film adaptation of a video game. But that really isn't saying much, since Boll's filmography consists largely of video game adaptations, and almost none of them have been decent. I exempt his previous film, ""Bloodrayne,"" simply because it was just mindless enough for the entertainment to sink in. I concede that ""In the Name of the King"" has moments of entertainment, but since most of the film is about as unintentionally campy as a B science fiction film from the 1950s, that's not much of a compliment.

Most of the problems stem from the casting choices: virtually every actor seemed like a square peg in a story full of round holes. Let's begin with the first billed actor, Jason Statham. He plays Farmer, so named because he feels that a man is defined by what he does; much like the archetypal heroes of fantasy plots, Farmer begins as a humble, land-toiling family man, only to eventually discover that his destiny calls for greater things. And yes, he's reluctant to take part in it, since the only life he knows is planting and harvesting crops. But a personal tragedy pushes him into the need for vengeance, a need that will only be met if he joins the King's army to fight the kingdom's enemies. Statham could have been right for this role had he not relied on his macho action-picture persona--Farmer is not too far removed from Frank Martin of the ""Transporter"" films, with his over the top fighting skills and a voice that's as soft and monotone as Steven Segal's.

Next, let's focus on Ray Liotta. He plays a wicked magus called Gallian, and as you might expect, he's gone mad with power and wants complete control of the kingdom. I don't know if I've ever seen an actor more out of place in a film; Liotta has played some evil characters before, but his bland American accent and under-whelming resolve proves that he just can't play evil in a fantasy film. Gallian has a pseudo-love affair with a strong-willed young woman named Muriella (Leelee Sobieski), who doesn't seem to realize that their relationship is a threat to the kingdom. She also doesn't seem to realize that the chemistry between them is nonexistent, despite the fact that he's teaching her to harness her own magical powers. She has powers, by the way, because her father is another magus. His name is Merick (John Rhys-Davies), and he's a good man who's dedicated to the King. He also takes a special interest in Farmer, since he believes him to be a man of great importance.

And then there's Burt Reynolds as King Konreid. As is the case with Liotta, Reynolds is hopelessly miscast, completely lacking any regal or noble onscreen presence. He seemed more like an afterthought, really, which is bad when you consider the prominence of his role. Bloodthirsty creatures called krugs are attacking Konreid's kingdom in droves (and it should come as no surprise they're under the direct control of Gallian); if he wants to stop them, he'll need a strong army and a little help from Farmer, who has an uncanny ability to survive a battle without wearing any armor. Both Farmer and Konreid fail to realize how important they are to each other, which is why Merick is on hand to explain it to them.

Matthew Lillard is the only actor in this film to manage his role accordingly. He plays Konreid's nephew, Duke Fallow, an arrogant, scheming young man who secretly schemes with Gallian. Unlike the other actors, whose straightforward roles leave much to be desired, Lillard goes in the right direction by thoroughly hamming it up. ""In the Name of the King"" would have been much better had it been as over the top as Lillard's performance. But to attempt a serious ""Lord of the Rings"" style fantasy at this scale is laughable, and not in a good way, either.

There are also a number of ill-fitting side characters: Farmer's wife, Solana (Claire Forlani), one of many taken prisoner by the krugs; Farmer's surrogate father, Norick (Ron Pearlman), who tries for comedy relief but gets only the occasional chuckle; Elora (Kristanna Loken), a member of a forest-dwelling, war-hating tribe that swings around on rogue vines. This is about as diverse and interesting as the characterizations get.

The most entertaining part of the film occurs within the final ten minutes: at their final confrontation, Gallian attempts to subdue Farmer with a cyclone of flying books. Not only was it impressive to look at, it was also a delightfully pompous display of power on the part of a sorcerer. I also enjoyed a number of shots showing Gallian surrounded by swirling fog; standing there, he can see through the eyes of a supernatural creature. But there isn't much else to go on, here, which is sad considering how big it wanted to be. I'm sure that ""In the Name of the King: A Dungeon Siege Tale"" will someday be regarded as a milestone of camp, an accidental cult classic screened at midnight movie theaters to the delight of select audiences. But I wouldn't hold my breath, if I were you.",1200009600,19,5475,4.7397691500524655

3087128,5,B0012DUT3M,"Look, everyone. This is a great movie. By that, I mean that it is a great failure of a movie. In fact, it is arguable the greatest failure of a movie EVER. And this is precisely where its charm lies.
You cannot watch this movie and take it seriously. It is a movie that must be watched with friends, preferably a mix of the boisterous kind (for laughter and jokes), and the cinematically literate kind (so they can explain to you how truly epic a fail this movie really is)  and torn apart while watching. If you watch it by yourself, like several low reviewers, you WILL NOT enjoy it. It is one of those movies that is so bad that it is good. In my opinion, it is on par with ""The Room,"" but it is far less boring and without any of those ""oh-dear-God-I've-been-scarred-for-life"" scenes. But enough apologetics. Let me give you a proper preview: What happens when you base a movie very, very loosely on a video game that no one's heard of? In the Name of the King. What happens when you give a director who has nothing over 11% on Rotten Tomatoes a 60 million dollar budget? In the Name of the King. What happens when he spends the budget on big name, but over the hill actors and skimps on costume design? In the Name of the King. What happens when all the big name actors figure out that the movie is a hopeless cause and instead decide to use it to make fun of their careers? In the Name of the King. What happens when the movie was planned to be cut into two movies, but instead compressed into one? In the Name of the King. What happens when the plot attempts to incorporate as many fantasy cliches in one movie as possible? In the Name of the King. What happens when they run out of time to fit anymore fantasy cliches in one movie? A sequel. Actually two sequels, if that can be believed. Yes, this might be Uwe Boll's greatest masterpiece ever. Also, Jason Statham does his typical B action movie roll well.",1409961600,,1916,4.292817679558011

I have said it before and I will say it again, I am an Uwe Boll fan. Yes it is true and you read that right I am a fan of this mans films. From Postal onward I have really liked them all so I decided to go back and revisit his first ones. Well not really his first ones but from House of the Dead and on, in doing so I actually started with his biggest budgeted one In the Name of the King: A Dungeon Siege Tale. The film was made for 60 million and made two to three million back its opening weekend or something like that.

Farmer is just what his name says he is, a farmer. He is living a normal happy life until the Krugs who are a group of nasty looking creatures attack his village and not kidnap his wife but kill his son. They are controlled by the evil sorcerer Gallian who is looking to take control of the entire kingdom. So farmer and few friends go forth to avenge his son and rescue his daughter.

Now when this film was first released it was trashed by almost everyone. Of course naturally I felt the need to defend it because I thought people were being unfair just because of his last film House of the Dead. So now after re-watching it I must say that maybe people could have been right about some things. Firstly the film doesnt look as bad as people say in fact I thought it was great B level stuff that looked a little better than B level stuff. So as far as the sets, costumes and even the creatures are concerned they are all fun. Which brings us to everything else, and we will start with the script.

Yes this is based on a game but you would think the writing would be better with something to base the story off of. But even with a good story I have to admit that the writing is a little subpar to downright awful at times. But then it hits me that that might be another reason I like it, bad B level dialogue and the acting to go with it. Yes the acting here for the most part is awful and it is surprising when looking at the cast. We will go as they come to me and first up is the lead Jason Statham who is very good here because he is playing an action role he is very good at playing. Next up is Ron Perlman who may be the best in the film and that makes perfect sense to me as he is a great actor.

So far so good and up next is Kristanna Loken who makes a good cameo in a very B Hercules TV Series style moment of the film. John Rhys-Davis seems to be just there but still comes off well and the same can be said for Brian J. White. This brings us to the final three starting with Burt Reynolds who people have straight hated on in this film. I myself thought he was fun in this role plus he is Burt Reynolds, I believe a man like that as king. Next up is the guy who seemed like he just said before shooting I am hamming it up and have fun with this one Matthew Lillard. This dude was so fun and over the top with his hamming I could not help but laugh when he was onscreen, loved it.

This brings us to the one and only Ray Liotta. Going back and seeing him in this now makes me wonder why I didn't notice it the first time around. I really must have but put it out of my mind because I have never seen him this bad. I don't know if he did it on purpose or the direction was wrong or he directed himself and did his way but it was bad. It is one of those things that would have guaranteed this film would have been a classic episode of MST3K. His performance may be the reason to see this film and I really mean that.

The DVD has the shorter cut and some behind the scenes from what I remember but I watched the Blu-Ray with the extended cut. This version also comes with the director commentary of one Uwe Boll. In this commentary you can tell he was excited about this film and it makes you want to root for him, that is until it becomes a commentary less commentary. There are a few times when he answers his phone while doing the track, why was it even on in the first place? One of the times leads to interesting news on one of his next films Farcry. Then there is a moment when he gets up and leaves the room to go get cake & coffee. There is no commentary for a while until he returns with his food and such and explains why he got it. I don't remember this ever happening when it was just one person doing the track.

So over all I completely get why most people hate this film and consider it one of the all time worst. For me though a lot of those reasons are the same things that save the film for me. Sure I will probably never watch this until the need for an Uwe Boll or video game movie fest happens upon my mind but still. Over all I think this is one of those flicks that is bad but also for some good because it is bad.",1400716800,,4699,3.9233997901364113

In the end, it kind of evened out.  I can't say Jason saved it from Uwe, Jason was just Jason.  I think Uwe is starting to get a little better, or at least getting better people around him.

Burt Reynolds as the king was kind of amusing.  It reminded me of my childhood: 9 to 5, and Best Little Whorehouse In Texas, etc.  Only he is the king.

Overall, it wasn't as terrible as the director's name implies.",1399334400,,586,3.9913793103448274
3087139,1,B0012DUT3M,"I usually like fantasy films, even those which are bad - but this thing was too much even for me. Below, more of my impressions. This review in principle doesn't contain SPOILERS.

The story is supposedly about a farmer, who is simply named Farmer (Jason Statham), who lives with his wife (Claire Forlani) and son in a kind of medieval kingdom called Ehb, ruled by aging king Konreid (Burt Reynolds). Then one day the kingdom of Ehb is attacked by the army of a certain Gallian (Ray Liotta), a warlock exiled from the country long time ago. This will of course gravely affect everybody in Ehb, including Farmer and his family. I will say no more about the story.

The story is quite simple and we heard, read and saw it many times - but still, when they are well told, even the oldest and most known stories can be greatly enjoyed. Sadly, in this film, it is absolutely NOT the case. All characters are pale, the acting is wooden, dialogs are without interest, there is no humour, every next scene can be anticipated half an hour earlier, there is nothing original or surprising, action scenes are just a painful repetition of the main hero destroying everything in his path, bad guys are just sword fodder and the main villain is a sad, pathetic joke. All this makes this film so horribly BORING that it was an ordeal to watch it.

The director Uwe Boll got a big budget - 60 millions USD! - and wasted every cent of it, as we don't see anything worth that kind of money on the screen. He also managed to muster some good actors (Jason Statham, Burt Reynolds, Ray Liotta, Ron Perlman, Claire Forlani, John Rhys-Davies) and three pretty girls (Leelee Sobieski, Kristanna Loken, Tania Saulnier) - and was completely unable to use them!  In fact most of them seem just to wander aimlessly or simply stay there asking themselves ""what am I supposed to do know?"" when in the same time thinking ""What the flip did I get myself into?"".

This film is so horribly bad, that it simply has no redeeming qualities. AT ALL! This is a turkey of such epic proportions that if at least it was edible it could solve the problem of hunger in the world - but it is impossible to digest and deserves only to be regurgitated with extreme prejudice, for all parties involved...

Another time the main characters were sitting around the table discussing what to do while they were eating and were drinking from crystal clear perfectly formed wine glasses which they did not have back then. The fight scenes were all the same just a boring slaughter with little tactical sense and the ninjas seemed out of place compared to the costumes and fighting style of the rest of the army.

3087157,4,B0012DUT3M,"I like this movie. I know a lot of people hated on Bowlls saying this was the worst movie ever made but I couldn't disagree more. Sure its no LOTR with a gillion dollar budget, however for a movie based on a video game I think he did a great job. Id say its one of the best dungeon genre video game movies ever made, and compare it to the original Dungeon & Dragons movies this movie blows them away. It has a great cast, Ron Perlman, everything he does is instantly a classic and I was shocked his character gets killed but that's life.  Statham does a great job as well as all of the cast. Statham has become one of my all time favorite action movie actors. I read reviews and people are so overly critical of this movie, its like they work for a competing movie company or are so snobbish in their intelligence they can't find joy in anything. The movie relies more on action and sets and less on overly priced special effects. There is a good amount of special effects but its no GREEN screen movie, which I find Hollywood has relied too much on GREEN SCREEN technology. the special effects are used sparingly and at the right times.  There are people in great well made costumes, I like sets with real buildings, I find it makes the actor get into character and everyone in this movie does it well. Mathew Lillard plays a great P.O.S traitorous bastard. John Rhys-Davies just has to walk on the set and smile to be good. Some people hated on Liotta, normally I would agree cause I got so burned out watching all his mob movies, so it was refreshing to see him play an evil person that didn't talk with a jersey accent. Brian White was excellent, and did well in his training for this movie. His sword fights were flawless. Then there is Burt Reynolds, and I have to say I liked his roll as king and he dies well an with honor. I loved his elite guards with their ninja assassin moves. I know some people commented on how stupid it was, but obviously they have never played the games or these type of games. There were assassins in games as well a our own history. Anyways, Sobiesky though her part is small, is as always smoking hot and could have shown more cleavage but you know at least Kristanna Loken made up for that. Statham was a lucky man to me locking lips with her. When she learns her son is dead you could see the muscles in her face reacting like a real mother would. Very believable and what I liked is that Bowlls didn't focus on the emotion, he showed it and moved on further into he story. You don't need to see ten minutes of someone sobbing over a child, and in this type of movie you don't want some chick flick tear jerker, you want action and believability. I have not see a lot Bowll's other works but for what its worth this was a great movie an I enjoyed it thoroughly.",1376697600,2,2800,4.261278195488722
3087158,4,B0012DUT3M,"And Ray Liotta as the evil wizard??  And...*gasp*...is that Matthew Lillard??

And Uwe Bill directed this?  What sorcery is this?

Those were the things going through my head as I watched In the Name of the King: A Dungeon Siege Tale (hereafter dubbed ITNOTKADST.)  Somehow, as I grabbed the DVD from the bargain shelf at my used video store, three facts blew right by me; one, Uwe Boll directed it; two, it is based off of a video game; and three, everybody hated it.

Now, I'm no fan of Boll, as isn't most of the world, and movies based off of video games generally suck bad.  That is a deal breaker for me, as I am a heavy gamer.  But as I sat there, watching the labyrinthine plot unfurl itself like an arthritic contortionist, something snuck up on me that I didn't expect.  I was having a damn good time.

Yes, the editing was bad.  I've seen worse, but thats no excuse, really.  To understand the plot is to pay closer attention than most people are willing to, and I don't blame them.  Jason Statham is a farmer whose boy is murdered and his wife abducted by the evil Krug (basically orcs) thus pulling him into a confrontation he doesn't want.  On top of those woes, the King (Reynolds) is being plotted against by his wicked nephew (Lillard) and his Mage (John Rhys-Davies) senses the growing evil, while Davies' daughter, a mage herself, is wooed by Liotta, thus endangering the kingdom...

And so on and so on and so on, as John Cleese once said.  The fact is this: nobody remembers Conan the Barbarian and Red Sonja and The Beastmaster and Krull because they were GOOD.  They weren't.  They stunk.  People remember them because they were FUN.

And with ITNOTKADST, I was having a blast.  I like how the village sets don't look too cheesy, and how the King's army had yeoman soldiers in it.  I like how in the battles, you actually see two hundred extras dressed as knights and Krugs and get to watch them slug it out in the mud and pouring rain.  I like the fact that these battles are fairly frequent.  I like that most of the actors take their roles seriously, even Reynolds.  I like how Boll lets the landscapes do most of the talking for him, allowing the mountain crags and rolling fjords to frame his shots as the heroes trudge on their quest (a trick he learned, no doubt, from Pete Jackson.)

The thing with this movie is, it seems that Boll was reigned in for most of the time, and the creative process was spread among more hands than just his.  This may be the only movie he's ever done that comes close to being good, but as they say, even a broken clock is right twice a day.  I've seen far worse movies than this.",1376438400,,2641,4.389690721649485

As I watched this DVD, wincing often and wondering how a fortune could have been thrown away to achieve such rotten results, the story and some of the characters wormed a way into my mind and heart until I found myself ignoring most of what was unraveling before my eyes and concentrating upon my own thoughts about what was really taking place and what might have been.

Given that I borrowed my copy from the public library and you may buy a used copy on Amazon.com beginning at $0.01(with postage costing not much more than a bottle of good beer), if you have half an imagination, and if you enjoy looking at those gorgeous rural areas of what-is-it New Zealand, then by all means obtain a copy of ""In The Name Of The King.""

Maybe watch it with the sound turned off, if nothing else works for you. Remember books? That's right... those rectangular little clumps of white paper printed with black ink and not usually having more than an illustration or two and perhaps a snazzy and colorful dust jacket? Remember how you could read a book and via the power of your own mind enlivening the words of the author, you could be transported to some magical or wondrous place and sometimes you wouldn't be able to put the book down until you'd finished reading every page? Remember how those words and your imagination could work together to built moving pictures in your head and remember how some of the pictures you built were even better than most of what you see today as video? Think about it!

If your imagination can do all that with a few words printed on paper, just imagine what your imagination can accomplish with this piece of eye-candy, which includes a passably good (though  for-the-most-part aborted by its director)story line! Yeah, turn the volume off while you watch ""In The Name Of The King. That's the ticket. Pay attention and daydream about what you see taking place.

I was instantly struck by how many well known & talented actors appeared in this film.
And as I watched it, being home sick from work & couldn't sleep, I wondered what had gotten into these people for appearing in this film.
I really don't think that video games are the best set up for making a movie.
And this one is an ultimate fail.
Horrible.
But on the bright side of things, it is very bland with the violence, no blood or gore or cussing.
So little kids can watch this.
And since they won't care about a plot, well, there ya go.
Honestly, anyone giving this a good rating has rocks in their heads.
It's hard to follow, a lot of things do not make sense bcs hardly anything is explained very well. Heck, I didn't even figure out that Leelee Sobieski was the good mage's daughter until I read a review afterwords here. I kept thinking she might be the king's daughter. It was confusing, & I'm a quick study usually.
Maybe the cold meds were messing with my head, but this movie seriously sucked.

The enemies have a certain Power Ranger quality to them. They're too plastic to be taken seriously, like mutated mutant ninja turtles. Throw this against the wild casting, and there lies the greatest imbalance. Throw in bizarre visuals (cheap and silly and random), some terrible acting/scripting, and a decidedly childish sense of choreography/filmatography (was the director specifically trying to use every angle and camera trick possible and as quickly as possible and including removing cohesive flow?). And WHAT is up with the never ending imposition of the soundtrack, trying to squeeze epic out of the mundane? The film just reeks.

I was 20 minutes in when I decided to accept the film for the ""done-over-the-weekend quality"", and have what little fun is to be had by seeing such a crazy collection of actors--some bound to be favorites from other films.

I knew I was in poor hands when I heard the the cheesy dialogue and some poorly choreographed fights. Why did I keep watching it? So I could tell my gamer friends in detail how much it sucked that's why. Baa haaa haaa haaa.

Jason Statham is a farmer named Farmer who has a wife and child. A darkness falls upon the land and evil things come with it and things go bad. Oh, he finds out he's the missing heir to the kingdom. Wow, that's like never been done before. Wow!

Cheesy acting continues with lines that feel off and action scenes which are sometime laughable. If this had been intended as a ""B"" movie it would have been better.

One thing that is strangely interesting enough are the huge number of known people who showed in this mediocre film: John Rhys Davies, Ron Perlman, Ray Liotta, Leelee Sobieski, Claire Forlani and Burt Reynolds. I suspect the project had promised in the beginning or German director Uwe Bolle got them interested.

Nominated for five Razzie Awards. I'm sure there are worse films but this is at best a campy film for gamers. Otherwise, AVOID!

The budget was $60M and not surprisingly it only made a tad over $13M. Don't expect a sequel and consider yourself blessed. There is a God! Ha! Oh, wait, there was a sequel and then a third. What happened? Must have been enough of a market in direct to DVD?

3087202,4,B0012DUT3M,"In the name of the King-Dungeon Siege(released Jan/08)stars Jason Statham as Camden Konreid/Farmer,Claire Forlani as Solana,his wife,a thinner looking John Rhys-Davies as Merick,the magus,Ron Perlman as Norrick,Ray Liotta as Gallian the evil magus,and Burt Reynolds as King Konreid. Set in Medieval times,this is a nice mix of swords and sorcery. It is not Lord of the Rings,by any means,though the director Uwe Bol(the European equivalent of Orson Welles-always trying to make a Citizen Kane) seems to want it to have that kind of scope. It is a tad overly long and the plot has a tendency to meander,but the cinematography and the lush musical background make up for alot of deficiencies. And,hey,Burt Reynolds;it was nice to see Burt back on the screen in a credible role.
The plot involves action man Statham as Farmer;that is his name,as he entered the village he now inhabits as an orphan after a great battle years before,and was adopted by family after family. He lives a quiet existence now with his beautiful wife and his son. However there is trouble in this seemingly peaceful land,as the kings cousin Duke Fallow(Matthew Lillard),wants to rule instead of his uncle Burt. Unbeknownst to everyone he has enlisted an evil magus in the form of Ray Liotta,who has also finagled his way into the heart of the kings daughter Muriella(Leelee Sobieski).
Ray sends his army of Krugs(a cross between an ape and an Orc)to slowly start taking over Burts kingdom by force. One day the Krugs reach the nearby village of his wife's parents,where his wife and son are staying. He sees the smoke and runs to help,along with Ron Perlman,his friend and mentor. They arrive in time to battle with the Krugs and their leader,all of whom are controlled by Liotta. However with the battle over his wife has been taken and his son killed.
The King arrives seeking volunteers for his army but Statham is bitter,asking where the Kings army was when it was needed...and walks away. Statham,Perlman and his wifes brother leave to rescue his wife. Traveling through a forest they meet up with its tree people who have no use for outsiders and ask them to leave. Meanwhile the kings daughter has fallen out of her feelings for Liotta who,rebuffed, becomes ever more angry. He poisons the food of the King and his ally Fallow. As Fallow lay begging for the antidote from Liotta,who had previously asked Liotta to speed his agenda up,Liotta asks him if he sped things for him enough,now. He gives the Duke the cure but says that now he owes his life to him. The King however is not so lucky and is slowly dying.
Battles ebb and flow and Perlman and his wife's brother get captured. The Duke now has control of 2/3 of the kings army and joins with the Krugs/Liotta to lay siege to the kingdom. Statham is brought before the King and it is found out he is the Kings real son. As he passes away the crown passes to Statham. The Duke hears the news of the deceased King,and declares himself the new king before Statham shows up and stops his show. The Duke's army re-defects back to the new King and the still outnumbered army,with the help of the forest dwellers,battles the onslaught of the evil army of Krugs.
Statham leaves the battle to join Rhys-Davies,the good magi and the kings daughter in laying siege to Liotta's castle fortress. Rhys-Davies goes ahead and battles the evil Liotta until he is fatally felled. The Kings daughter arrives just before he passes,and she receives all of his powers. Statham though is in a jam as Liotta has him on the ropes. As Liotta taunts Statham as to what kind of revenge he is after(a kings,a fathers?),Stathams wife,who was a hostage of Liotta's,comes from behind and says""you forgot a mothers revenge"",fatally wounding him. The film ends as Statham is reunited with his lady love,and peace finally reigns over the kingdom.
It is quite the involved plot and I was only able to do the highlights here,but you kind of get the feel of what it is about. Boll tries,as I mentioned,to have a film on a grand scale,and for the most part he succeeds. The look and music really add to the whole dynamic of the film. The editing could have been tighter and the plot is quite intricate and as a result he has alot of loose ends to tie up. Remember Scotty's axiom:The more complicated it gets,the easier it is to stuff up the plumbing! For instance there is a sub,sub,sub plot involving the tree people of the forest which easily could have been eliminated. That said,all the actors here,and what a stellar cast it is,do a marvelous job. Statham is proving he can act and do action as well,and I'm glad to see the direction his career has taken so far. It is funny seeing Ray Liotta in such a role,but he comes through in style. And Matthew Lillard sure had a great time in his over the top portrayal of the Duke.
Technically speaking the film is in its original w/s a/r of 1:78:1 and is clear and crisp. There are no extras.
All in all,despite bad BO returns and other reviews,I liked this film. Sure it is a bit on the long side,with quite the intricate plot,but Boll reaches for an epic feel here(much like Lord of the Rings,but no where near as good)and I think,not achieving everything he set out to do,does accomplish a good portion of it. The best things:the solid acting,the cinematography and the musical score. 3 1/2-4 stars. Recommended.",1348876800,,5358,4.695005313496281

It also has a good cast.  What could go wrong.  Answer: EVERYTHING

This has absolutely no similarity with the game except there is a town named EB.  This is a travesty and they should have been sued by the game makers.  There's nothing wrong with the beginning of the film, but after that everything is further and further downhill and it's too bad.  This cast could have done well with a good story and script.

3087207,1,B0012DUT3M,"An adopted kid in the village of Ehb grows up to become a man named Farmer (Jason Statham, ""Transporter""), whose wife and son leave to sell some crops. Some guys called Krugs decide this is the best time to invade and try to destroy this village, thankfully Farmer's friend Norrick (Ron Perlman, ""Hellboy"") helps him against these invaders then they go to the nearby village to get Farmer's wife (Claire Forlani, ""Meet Joe Black"") and son, but the son is killed and the wife captured by a wizard (Ray Liotta, ""Goodfellas"").

So what else would follow but a pursuit by Farmer and Norrick to get the wife and for Farmer to get his revenge for the death of his son. Sadly I have made this movie sound way, way, way more interesting than it could ever hope to be, thanks mainly to director Uwe Boll (""House of the Dead, ""BloodRayne"" & ""Alone in the Dark"") who should never, never have been allowed to make movies, theatrical or even straight to dvd releases. The amount of ineptness in film making here is astounding, I can't begin to describe how truly terrible this whole experience is.

What blows my mind even more is how this hack was able to get such an ensemble cast for this horrid movie. I mean Jason Statham, Ron Perlman, Claire Forlani, Leelee Sobieski (""Joy Ride""), John Rhys-Davies, (The ""Lord of the Rings"" Trilogy), Ray Liotta, Matthew Lillard (""Scooby-Doo"") and Burt Reynolds (""Smokey & The Bandit"") among others. What did Uwe have on all these people to sell them on this bad, bad flick?

People have called Ed Wood one of if not the worst director of all time, I would beg to differ as his films weren't really any good but you could see at least Ed cared about his work. When it comes to Uwe it's pretty obvious he has the mind of an idiotic teenager who was given a bunch of money, a camera crew and went nuts.

3087208,3,B0012DUT3M,"I had never even heard of this film prior to running across it in my random ""costume drama perusal"" on Netflix, but I decided on a whim to rent it and it turned out better than I anticipated. It is obviously a B-movie with a decent budget and moderate to decent actors (with a few bad ones thrown in for good measure), but it's also a surprisingly good story with a fabulous climax. All in all, it's worth seeing if you are into the fantasy genre, but nowhere near the caliber of Tolkien or Lewis.

Many years ago, a child was found wandering in the wood and given into the keeping of the small nearby town. No one and everyone raised him. Believing that people become what they are called, he chose the name of Farmer (Jason Statham) for himself. Now a reasonably successful man of the trade, he is happily married to the beautiful Solana (Claire Forlani) and has a strapping little boy who just wants to grow up to be like his father. Sending his wife and son to town to trade and also visit her parents, Farmer continues in his toil at home, not realizing that the kingdom is being threatened by an invading army of Krugs, an animal-race pressing against their borders. They are the minions of the dark mage Gallian (Ray Liotta), who has managed to expand his magical powers in order to drain those of Muriella (Leelee Sobieski), the daughter of the official mage of the court. Having tempted her into a forbidden relationship, he seeks to overthrow her father without her knowledge, and is in league with the king's evil nephew (Matthew Lillard). The Duke has grown impatient in waiting for the throne and desires to have it now.

Standing between him and success is Muriella's father Merick (John Rhys-Davies), but not even he can halt the invasion of the Krugs... and when his son is slain in battle by one of them, Farmer must take up arms to defeat them and rescue his wife from a fate worse than death. The result is a reasonably good story that might have been better executed, but it is better than anticipated considering it is based off of a fantasy video game. I really liked the premise, the introduction of the mages, and especially Elora (Kristanna Loken), the queen of the woodland women, who sweep in on vines and save the day when they are needed. The plot is rather contrived and unoriginal but could be forgiven in the sense that for the most part, the pacing is enjoyable. However, it does tend to lag in the second half, in which we waver between Krugs on the battlefield and the magical duels of the mages in the castle. The latter is far more exciting than the former, and I actually fast-forwarded almost all the Krug battles just to get to the good stuff.

Some of the actors are very good and others are terrible. I liked Liotta's character very much, he was a decent villain and his menace toward the women around him was very strong and threatening, but somehow the actor seems to ham most of his lines. He is putting far too much work into his performance and this lessens its impact considerably. I was pleased to see Sobieski again, after her tremendous appearance as Joan of Arc, and she is very good in the role. I actually cheered when she turned up in a suit of armor. Forlani and Statham have good chemistry together, and the ending is an uplifting but bittersweet one, as not all survive the ultimate battle. The special effects are very good and some of them, such as the sequence in which the mages have a sword duel without using their hands, are especially memorable. The costuming is also quite pretty, but there were a couple of times when I was confused as to who people were. The twist midway through was obvious from the beginning. It is never a film that will compete with some of the epic fantasies of our time, but I did not regret viewing it, even if it was over-long in places. If you are a fan of the genre,  you will enjoy it. Best of all, it's appropriate for young teenagers as well.

It was probably right around the 45-minute mark, but I couldn't stand to see the baddies from Power Rangers revived to fight a bad LOTR knockoff battle with Statham.

3087210,1,B0012DUT3M,"There are only two things that you need to know about this movie.
1. It is a Uwe Boll film. Uwe Boll is universally recognized as one of the worst hacks in film history having created such great hits as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/House-of-the-Dead/dp/B0000YEE6C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">House of the Dead</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bloodrayne/dp/B000EQ5V8G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bloodrayne</a>, and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Alone-in-the-Dark/dp/B0007XBM5W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Alone in the Dark</a>. He buys the rights to recognizable games and then makes a movie which is really a generic combination of the best scenes from other movies thrown randomly together. Although his films rarely even make their money back he took advantage of a German tax loophole (since closed) which allowed you to get tax credits for your film whether it makes a profit or not.

2. The clever goblin strategy is to light themselves on fire and then catapult themselves at the enemy.

If either of those things sound attractive to you then this is a movie to check out. I love the sheer irrationality and unintentional humor of a good Boll film. This film represents his largest-scale production since the film he's choosing to rip off is the Lord of the Rings, complete with an irrelevant Helm's Deep raining fight sequence ripoff that has nothing to do with any of the main characters and doesn't affect the plot in any way. His villain is the grossly miscast Ray Liotta who has gone down a long way since Goodfellas. His every scene is comic gold since he is actually trying to overact and failing.

3087223,2,B0012DUT3M,"An evil wizard wants to rule the Kingdom of Ehb (and perhaps all Aranna) with the half beast Krugs that he managed to control with his magic.

In this fantasy world based on the award winning game Dungeon Siege, the blood defines the destiny and capabilities of everyone, be it a mage or a ruler. Obviously I won't advance much of the story; that would be an ugly spoiler.

This is a classic tale of good against evil with underdeveloped characters considering the stars that interpret them (including Jason Statham, Burt Reynolds, Ray liotta, John Rhys-Davies, Ron Perlman, Leelee Sobieski, etc.).

Some positive considerations:

- A nice fantasy tale, if you're a fan of this genre you will not be too disapointed (although this is no Lord of the Rings, Willow or Conan the Barbarian! Don't watch this movie with high expectations and you'll get a fun evening, otherwise you will be writing some tough reviews here later on...)

- Jason Statham fighting skills - impressive. Farmer is the strong silent type character really appropriate for Statham;

- John Rhys-Davies - a very respectable wizard lord, nice interpretation;

- The magic scenes are well designed (including the wizard duel and the mage control of his minions);

- The wood dryads (wow).

Some negative considerations:

- The large battles could be infinitely better;

- The plot is extremely simple and sometimes very silly - SPOILER ALERT - so, you are the heir to the throne and the last of the lineage, great, then you go (almost) alone into the evil ultra powerful wizards lair and face him in battle...great plan - END OF SPOILER

- The script is weak.

Some weird considerations:

- Ray Liotta is THE weirdest evil Wizard in the history of cinema.

The DVD extras are quite reasonable, including the ""Making off"", behind the scenes, and additional footage. In those extras you can see that the cast really had a great time filming this movie. Three stars for the extras.",1285632000,,1945,4.816265060240964
3087224,2,B0012DUT3M,"People say Uwe Boll movies are terrible. What is truly remarkable about some of Uwe Boll movies is, however, that he somehow managed to attract decent players for his project. There are so many ""bad"" films out there - ""Plan 9 from Outer Space"" or ""Manos: The Hands of Fate,"" for example - but few of them actually have a name star like Jason Statham.

Besides the Transporter"" star, Boll's fantasy action flick ""In the Name of the King: A Dungeon Siege Tale"" stars John Rhys-Davies, Claire Forlani, Matthew Lillard, Ray Liotta, Kristanna Loken, Ron Perlman, Burt Reynolds and Leelee Sobieski. Not exactly all-star cast, but still not bad. Sadly the director's trademark inability to create a coherent narrative (out of decent actors and photography) has not changed.

""In the Name of the King: A Dungeon Siege Tale,"" inspired by a computer roll-playing game, starts with a revenge story of a father named Farmer (Jason Statham), set in a medieval Europe-like kingdom of Ehb. With his friend Norick (Ron Pearlman) and brother-in-law Bastian (Will Sanderson), Farmer sets out in search of his beloved wife Solana (Claire Forlani) kidnapped by evil creatures Krugs. I almost thought that Uwe Boll finally learned what storytelling means. I mean, almost.

Of course, I was mistaken. ""In the Name of the King"" is a typical Uwe Boll action film. It goes on and on, like your boss's long, boring speech. It jumps from one topic to another, not knowing where it should go. Marginally interesting action sequences (choreography itself is OK) are frequently interrupted by scenes from subplots. He doesn't bother to explain basic things about the fantasy world we are watching.

Still, the film is not without entertainment value if you have a taste for films which are so bad that they start to look kind of good. The film's highlights include ninja-like warriors somersaulting in the forest, and monsters or ""Krugs"" that look like humans wearing common gorilla suits. These ""monsters"" fly in the air using a catapult (and they are on fire), and there are some ridiculous dialogues and bad acting from the cast. If you like ""so bad, so good"" type of movies, this is the one for you.",1285200000,,2173,4.896739130434782

Miscasting seems to be a recurring Boll habit of his.  He could've gotten Malcolm McDowell, Kenneth Branagh, and Johnathan Rhys Meyers (not to confuse Rhys-DAVIES who's already in this movie) to effectively play the characters that Burt, Ray and Matthew played in; he probably tried to, but then the actors realized who will direct this movie and hightailed their bums back to Great Britain.  He keeps making these ridiculous casting choices for many of his films, and these three actors can't get into the medieval-fantasy mindset for this film.  One cannot just pick-and-mix actors just to fill in the slots, there has to be a believable balance within the ensemble (something Richard Kelly didn't understand when he made ""Southland Tales"").  ""Alone in the Dark"" even had a nicely-balanced cast: it had two C-list actors and a C-list actress playing the lead roles; they're a perfectly average selection.

""In the Name of the King"" follow the same vain revenge structure as ""Bloodrayne"".  The main character lost someone he/she cared for by some evil dude who just happened to be in the way, and he/she is off with a blade in their hand to slain their nemesis in a ridiculous stylistic fashion. The main character here is named Farmer (Jason Statham), and the nemesis is a wizard played by Ray Liotta, who didn't bother to give his character a fake accent.  Farmer meets some new people along the way, rescuing people including his wife who was captured, fighting ghoulies and eventually learned about his hidden lineage that will help conquer his foes.  The story was pretty steady for the first-half of the film, but then it went speeding down the last-half.  The mages were rarely useful outside distractions, the military army were pushed to the side for the last act for no clear reason, and the movie just ended after the bad guy was defeated.  There's a director's cut available on blu-ray that's 40 minutes longer, but not seeing that version myself, I can't say if this is the ""Kingdom of Heaven"" of director's cut or is it just Boll adding more violence and Kristina Lokke screen time.

To be honest, I don't harbor any spite for this movie, and I can't see to feel the same for Boll's last two films (""Alone in the Dark"" and ""Bloodrayne"").  What most people don't seem to notice is that Uwe Boll's improving himself since his first film.  It's not a huge improvement, in fact the improvements are very small, but at least he's making progress.  He toned down the camera crazy in ""Alone"", and he manage to make the locations look nice in ""Bloodrayne"".  ""In the Name of the King"" is certainly his least stinkiest so far.  Jason Statham isn't fit for a king, but he and Ron Perlman were fit for machismo action at certain moments.  The backgrounds were beautiful whenever they're not an apparent green-screen effect (which is most of the time), and the film does have that one creative action scene where the monster lit himself on fire and catapulted himself towards its enemies, walking towards them along the way; that's a new kind of kamikaze approach right there.  I doubt there's hope for the director who beats up critics, but he's trying; small development is better than no development.",1281484800,,3476,5.064912280701755

Maybe I've just seen a lot more crappy movies than the people who gave this one star, but the whole time I was watching it I was looking for why everyone thought it was so bad. It's a low budget fantasy movie. It's got the acting and dialogue on par with Willow or Conan the Destroyer (not the Barbarian, that was a great movie) and it's got slightly better special effects than most of the other low budget fantasy flicks. Jason Stathan plays Jason Statham, in a fantasy movie, and if you want to see Jason Stathom in a fantasy movie, you will be satisfied. I personally enjoy watching Jason Statham double-flying-jump-kick people regardless of the setting, as he is the ultimate macho hero guy. This movie is cheesy, and the direction is terrible, but it's not a horrible movie. The actors are all fun to watch, and if you can find humor in the fact that the director threw Ninjas into the middle of a medieval battle scene, literally out of nowhere (they just come flying out of the trees and fight for a minute and then are never shown again)then you should be able to enjoy this movie.

3087231,3,B0012DUT3M,"I've seen Uwe's other works and he must be crapping out money or has Kevin Reynolds as an investor(ala, Costner for Waterworld,Postman,etc..) because he is able to come out with not so great movies that are epically long, but has great actors in them.

Alone in the Dark? Don't get me started, that movie had nothing to do with what the franchise was about.

However, This movie actually wasn't really all that bad. Yea, the fight scenes could have gone on for an additions 80 min. or so. /sarcasm. But to be honest, it was not a bad film to just sit and watch.

And believe it or not, this script has followed the Game that it represents a lot more closely than his other movies. So I guess that is something.

Did This movie have a lot of reference to LOTR? You bet it did. But so did the story line/feel/atmosphere of the Original Game Dungeon Siege. Just a few things changed here and there.

SPOILERS(if you care)

Some of the things that stood out for me were:
Good:
-The story was cliche but, so are a lot of stories in Hollywood.

-Great location. Props were good. Great scenery and decent special effects. Much better then some of the indie films that you see. And really the directing was pretty decent for as big of a project as this was.

-The Actors did as good as they could. And the Krugs were no more ridicules then the ground creatures from the movie ""The Time Machine"".

-I liked the fact that he(Uwe) didn't try to make it one big blood bath. The kids got to see it and enjoyed it.

Not so good:
-Ray Liota? No, he's a great actor. But his ""Bad Guy"" performance was kind of stiff. I think they should have gotten Tim Curry to be the bad guy. Way better.

-Tried to cram and do WAY to much story wise. Instead of just taking some of the story and making it a movie, It seems as if they(production) looked at the script and said ""It's all good, so it must all stay!!!"" As this movie is long. And if he(Uwe)wanted it to be long. He could have made it a mini-series or had a sequel done with it instead of cramming.

-Different accents, yet related? Didn't get that..

-Yes, the Ninja thing I didn't get. At first I thought they were the women of the forest in their respective armor. But I'm not so sure. Not a lot of detail on that.

-There was just a lot going on and a lot of characters to keep track of. Farmers band that fought with him in the first war, are pretty much absent from the 2nd half of the movie. For obvious story reasons, but it felt like(or was presented as)they were going to be the posse for the whole movie....but I guess not.

-Fight scenes way too long. nuff said.

-Music...This might have been out of his hands, but there were times when it was decent. But sometimes it was way to loud and didn't fit the mood, especially during some of the many fighting scenes.

-The Ending.....what the hell? Money run out? Couldn't do a follow up to the final fight scene. ""I want to tell you, that I love you.""....Then.....credits role? huh? What happens afterward. What characters were still alive? What happened to Matt Lillard's character? I mean, surly just a quick followup/closing should have been in order. And I think, it's because of this quick no closure ending, is what cheapens the movie even more. I mean, would it kill them to add just a scene that says. ""Thank you for watching till the end of this movie, here is what happened to the characters."" type of thing. It is what they call in the movie business a ""Conclusion"".

Well, these are my opinions. Others will disagree. But, it wasn't horrible, the pay and script must have been halfway good on paper for these higher actors to be in it. In the end, it all depends on how it gets edited though. And in that respect the movie speaks for itself.

Again, not horrible. And not a bloodbath, so you can sit with your kids and watch it. The Blu-Ray looks pretty darn good though. Is it LOTR? No, but it's a movie that you can watch and not take seriously and have fun with.",1272240000,4,3968,4.32345013477089

The only reason you have to buy this Canadian-exclusive release is for the special features. The 165-minute director's cut promised by director Uwe Boll is available on DVD only in overseas countries and on the Blu-ray release of the movie; this edition contains the exact same cut of the movie as the regular release. The special features aren't anything worth paying extra for, so I suggest you only buy this here if you can get it cheap. On the second disc, you get 1) an 18-minute making-of featurette (not featured on the regular release), 2) 16 minutes of deleted scenes and extended footage (these are already on the regular release), 3) free digital download of the movie, 4) a downloadable demo of the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dungeon-Siege-2/dp/B0009PQCSU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dungeon Siege 2</a>&nbsp;PC game, 5) previews and trailers, and 6) an unnecessary and unexceptional photo gallery.

Unless you want the movie on your mp3 player for potentially less than demanded by online sites, the only noteworthy addition is the making-of clip, which is only moderately insightful as to how the movie was made but still good for a few laughs. It's basically Boll and the performers telling you how great the movie is going to be: Brian ""Tarish"" White claims that people were actually competing for the opportunity to work on the flick, Ray ""Gallian"" Liotta says that he couldn't relate to his character at all and therefore had to rely entirely on actual acting ability, Jason ""Farmer"" Statham proudly claims that he did his own stunts (not entirely true), and Boll reiterates that you're foolish to expect a movie adaptation to actually follow the game it's based on (but Claire ""Solana"" Forlani is confident that gamers will still like the movie because of the Krug and fighting). To his credit, Boll lauds his actors, speaks highly of action choreographer Tony Ching's contributions, and explains his reasoning behind the claustrophobically-shot battles.

I don't imagine there's too many of them, but for actual fans of the movie, this ""special"" edition is a bit of a rip-off, seeing as they'll still need to buy another version of the movie to get the full nine yards out it. Nevertheless, in a pinch, for those who haven't seen the movie at all and are open to potential disappointment, I suggest you buy this version if you can find it cheap and don't live in Europe or own a Blu-ray player, since it's still marginally more satisfying than the standard release.",1271289600,3,2788,5.08296943231441

Toss in copy-cat LOTR visuals, less-than-magical special effects, and Boll's heavy-handed, pedestrian direction, and you are left with a film that probably shouldn't have been made.

Trying to list positive aspects of this film is difficult, but one does stand out; nobody fights better on film than Jason Statham. Whether tossing a lethal boomerang, gracefully wielding a sword, or relying on his fists and boundless energy, Statham becomes electrifying when he goes into battle, no matter the era. His action scenes single-handedly keeps this film from rating just one star, or even lower, as it is truly that bad!

I think I'm being kind in giving this film 2 stars. I like Jason Statham, he has a charisma about him. But this movie was so hard to get through; I wasn't even able to pay total attention to it. Luckily the plot is so thin (like thread) that you don't really have to pay full attention to it to know what's going on. Statham is a farmer named Farmer who's trying to get back his kidnapped family from the evil forces of Ray Liota. There's also an evil nephew (Matthew Lillard) trying to take over the throan of his king (Burt Reynolds, whom I adore but his so not in the right element here). I like a lot of the cast featured here: Jason Statham, Ron Perlman, Ray Liota, John Rhys-Davies, Burt Reynolds, Matthew Lillard, and Claire Forlani. But 99% of this cast were not meant to be in a midevil and/or fantasy film. The actors do what they can with the material, but it just isn't enough. Matthew Lillard makes it fun by playing his role over the top and hammy. Frankly, everyone should've played it that way instead of a serious fantasy film. True other Statham films like The Transporter were thin in plot, but the action made up for it in my opinion. The action here just isn't all that exciting, it's more by the book than anything else. I feel this movie could've been better with a different cast and better writer. I give kudos to the production design of the film (it does look rather nice) and director Uwe Boll for being able to fund his own projects (not to meantion get big name actors). This is the first Boll film I've seen, so I have no other basis for comparison; this is just a review of the film itself and not of the director's work.",1238630400,,1814,4.227665706051873
3087244,3,B0012DUT3M,"There were two movies that came out in 2008 which probably rank among the worst in history, this one and Punisher: War Zone.

This movie sucks.  You can pretty much ignore what every character says and just insert something you know from Lord of the Rings or Willow.  You'll be close enough that it won't matter.  Better yet, just watch it in German.  It is after all the director's native language.  As for the plot, again, just make up your own details from what you've read and seen.  You can see the formula revealed without much effort.

""But you gave it three stars, dip****!!""

Yes, and here's why.  This film is a monument to bad filmmaking, a milestone that may never be surpassed.  It's a clash of opposites though because it is an incredibly expensive, slick production.  I would call it one of the most well-made bad movies ever.  So much effort and expense went into casting, action sequences, choreography and special effects that it should have been good, but Boll made it awful, so awful that I had to keep watching to see how much more awful it was going to get.  Here's a quick breakdown:

Farmer's name is Farmer and he's hero Jason Statham (possibly the only good casting choice).

Farmer's friend is Ron Perlman who for some reason isn't cast as creepy bad guy.

Creepy bad guy is Ray Liotta, which doesn't make sense because he's got in Irish blood in him so he could never be a made man (It's Ray freaking Liotta in a freaking Fantasy movie, what can you say to that!?).

The role of Gandalf will be played by Gimli, son of Gloin.

The role of Arwen/Eowyn will be played by Leelee Sobieski, who is young, pretty and maybe talented, but honestly, the fact that she is in it at all should tell you it's a bad movie.  She may consider finding a new agent.

It's a fantasy movie and Burt Reynolds is in it.  Why?  Because they could, I guess.

Burt Reynolds's toadie is Matthew Lillard, which should be another tip-off that it will be a bad movie.

So the hero decides to be a hero, fights some nondescript bad guys, rallies more people to fight nondescript bad guys, then it all comes to a head and they all fight the one descript (well, if nondescript is a word...) Ray Liotta (Ray Liotta?? Seriously??).  Lots of fighting and dialogue reminiscent of Star Wars prequel trilogy (low blow, I realize that) ensue along the way.

In two words, it's heroicly bad.  If you are a real movie buff, you HAVE to see this movie just to see how bad it is.  It's as if you're watching bad film history unfold before your eyes.  That is the only reason I give it a positive rating, because for better or for worse (mostly worse), it's worth seeing.",1238630400,16,2655,4.448132780082988

In spite of the great supporting actors such as LeeLee Sobieski and Ray Liota, this film is boring.  LeeLee Sobieski dressed in armor is just another reincarnation of her Joan of Ark performance.

I mean, with Jason Statham (thankfully without a toup&eacute;e), John Rhys-Davies (""no one tosses a dwarf), and Ron Perlman (""Hellboy"") in the cast, you would think this would be a top notch film, right? Don't count on it. I'll even give you the fact that Burt Reynolds plays the King. Good old Burt couldn't even save this one. I think the budget was spent on the cast and special effects so there was little left for a script, let alone to hire a decent director. The special effects are pretty incredible. The battle scenes are well choreographed and the music isn't half bad but then you find scenes like the one with Kristanna Loken as Elora, a vine swinging tough chick who declares that men are not welcome in her forest and has the screen presence of a stick. Ray Liotta gets the biggest laughs as he tries desperately to be the insane baddie. I just couldn't take him seriously and I am not sure he could, either. Maybe he needed the money? To my surprise the saving grace of this whole fiasco is Matthew Lillard (""Scream"") who shines as the sniveling, traitorous, Duke Fallow.

3087252,1,B0012DUT3M,"Where do I start, if there was a negative commentary for this movie as you watched it, you'd see every mistake Uwe Boll made besides agreeing to this script in the first place.  I'd like to apologize to the actors who must have some sense, but like us all need to make money, even if they're selling their skills to the Hitler of directors. If I was looking through the directors eyes I would gouge them first & then ask someone else to do this that way it at least had a chance.
  First I'll comment on Ehb, the name itsself sounds ridiculous but we must press on.  Ehb is an empire kind of like Rome with the luxury of having a castle, a small village named Stonebridge, Sedgewich forest & a nameless field where the battles take place. Rome wasn't built in one day but Eb sure was.  Don't be fooled, Ehb also has diverse citizens, which is cool, ninjas (yeah... weird, feminist tree huggers & religion. The movie switches back & forth from Monotheism to Polytheism... told you it was unique.  With its winning LOTR landscape, Amazonian forest the ""empire"" of Eb is surely a creation only the insane could think of.
  My next comment is on the actors, there are so many here so who shall I start with?  Why not the lead character Jason Statham who plays Farmer?  Statham is a man who makes up his name because he believes that if you call yourself something that's what you'll be. I think its too late to call Uwe Boll a genious director don't you?  Well, anyways the other characters are Hellboy whose's Statham's dumb father like figure who aids him in his quest. Ray Liotta's the bad magus, Leelee Sobieski is the underachieving daughter who is also a magus who sells her goodies to Ray Liotta, Gimli from LOTR plays a good magus & Leelee's father, Burt Reynolds plays the King of Ehb who has alot of similarities to Marcus Ariliues from the Gladiator & there's Shaggy from Scooby Doo plays the king's evil nephew.  The acting style in this movie was the worst part. When loved one's died there was no emotion, for example when Statham's son gets hacked by a Krug & he has to bury him & still remains strong.  And when Leelee's father died, (Gimli)she just stands there with a blank stare. I did more crying than anything, I wonder why?
  When you add Ehb plus the actors you still get a really long movie that doesn't seem to end. No wonder everybody's comments are so long.  Our next topic are the missions which I will do my best to sum & give the most eye raising parts.  First, we'll begin with Statham who is a Farmer named Farmer who takes on a one man search for his wife. Throughout the movie he mentions several times that he's just a ""simple farmer"" who fights with a machete, runs on the shoulders of Krugs & uses his the skills he had in the Transporter movies.  All he needed was a sweet Audi & a black suit & in the empire of Ehb anything can happen. With the remarkable fighting skills he required from growing cabbages he also is the long lost son of Burt Reynolds, making him the heir of Ehb. When father & son share a special saying they truly realize that they are family even though Burt said that to Statham when he was only 3 years old.
  Next on the chopping block is good old Burt, who is plays the simple king of Ehb & learns that his nephew, (Shaggy) wants to kill him & take over his kingdom.  The worst part about Burt's character is when he finds out that Statham is his son, he doesn't express himself in an excited way, but in reality he is. If you still decide to watch it, you'll know why.
  Leelee's character plays the last female of the Maji race, no... they didn't have a dying race called Maji in LOTR, they had elves, big difference. Leelee is in love with Liotta who steals her powers & places them in his favor so he can overthrow the King.  After she comes into her destiny we'll call it, she rides off to join the battle & gets chased by Liotta's Krug like Arwen in LOTR.  She never fights, or does anything really, she's just dressed in armor because it looks better in battle, I guess.
  Next is Ray Liotta's character called Gallian who is the mastermind behind the Krugs & is the king of the Krugs. His Krugs whole mission is to take the people of Ehb to this dungeon, hence the name where they work constantly.  If you want to picture this dungeon think about LOTR when Saruman had the Urk Hai digging under the ground around him. When his Krugs reign terror on the good people of Ehb Liotta is also present.  He's the Krug on the horse & he watches the battle scene in a strange realm,kind of like how Frodo saw Sauron whenever he put the ring on. This way Liotta can watch but never be killed.  The worst part about Liotta's character is in the end when he fights like his 4th battle scene with Statham. He uses books to fight Statham along with the force like abilities from the Matrix movies.
  With all that being said there's still more, including poor dialogue & words taken out of different time periods & other's just thrown in for fun.  Words like melodramatic, arrogant,mindless enterprise were used randomly. I told you that anything can happen in Ehb. Along with misplaced words the movie somehow has to end & what else could help it besides a big rope?  Literally, it helped end the movie & I can see the director & his crew trying to figure it all out now. Their sitting around the script & someone, anyone shouts out, ""how about a rope,"" and the rest is history.
  Sometime between the first scene & the point of suicide the movie ends with Statham reuniting with his wife.  Will the world of Ehb be restored?  Will Farmer change his name to King so he can be a king? Will he take on his role as the leader of Ehb altoghether?  If he does it isn't in this movie & hopefully not in another one, because I don't think I'd be able to watch it. After Statham says his loving words to his wife the movie ends with Lord of the Dance music meets rock band. And so ends the terror, so ends the tale of Uwe Boll's movie.  If he dares write another let's stick that in the dungeon right next to the Krugs.",1230422400,,6065,4.318623124448367
3087253,1,B0012DUT3M,"I'll keep this one short and sweet for you, I had to fast forward to the end after about an hour of this abysmal crud. That's all you need to know, but if you want details, read on.

With that said, this is truly a testament to Uwe Boll's complete lack of talent. The cast was decent, everyone on board may have been a second tier actor, but they all have numerous credits to their names. I've seen every single cast member give a decent performance in one movie or another, yet somehow they all managed to be absolutely horrible, laughably bad. It is rare to find acting this bad in a movie that was actually released to theaters.

The storyline was cliche and nothing new, but it would have been entertaining if it actually made sense. Not once did they stop to explain where the heck this kingdom was, who the heck anyone in the story was, why there were bad guys working for the king, why the hell anyone would want to love Ray Liotta, and most importantly why do we really care about anyone in this movie. There was just way too much information trying to be crammed into this movie and these random subplots just added to the confusion. Ninjas, amazon women, 5 second love affairs with old men???

Please, learn how to frame a shot and edit!!!! The people making this film simply do not know what they are doing. Every scene was either awkwardly framed or shot way too close to the actors. And the editing further worsened the situation, with random cuts at completely inappropriate times. I could honestly give a camera to a bunch of high school kids who would shoot and edit something that looked better than this.

And lastly, don't get me started on how Jason Stattham manages to stay in peasant clothes throughout the entire duration of the movie. He saves his town and heads off to save his wife, still in peasant clothes. He enlists as a soldier and fights a major battle, still in peasant clothes. He becomes a king and fights another major battle, still in peasant clothes. Seriously, what does it take to get him out of peasant clothes, you've got a bloody king fighting in rags while everyone else is wearing armor!!!!

But during a search for another movie it came up and I decided to spend a whole $2.98 for the DVD from someone who was selling through Amazon.  Boy had I been wrong, and had the reviews been so wrong on this one.  I buy a lot of Fantasy movies, most of them in fact, and this is one of the best I have seen!

1)  The Farmer turns out to be a top notch martial artists, wrestler, and sword fighter.  When and Where did he acquire the knowledge and skills to both learn farming and combat skills?  I mean his fighting was above par by any standard.

2)  The tree sprits are feminists tree huggers.  While they shoo away the males from their forests, they drop their high morals and ethics at the mere beck and call from a female.

3)  At the final battle, the outnumbered human army literally has the high ground on a muddy hill yet they charge down the hill ruining the biggest advantage that they've got.

4)  Ninja's!?!?

5)  So many different accents all around it's hard to believe they all come from the same region.

3087260,3,B0012DUT3M,"About thirty minutes in, my wife turned to me and asked this question:

""Who directed this and how did they get the money?""

Realizing the context of this remark, she is not a film buff and often cares very little about the art of film, who directs, who scored it and so on. Maybe she likes an actor every now and then, but it's not often. Her favourite film is Brotherhood of The Wolf.

My answer was this:

""Uwe Boll. No one seems to know where he gets any the money to make any of his movies.""

""Ewe? You got that right,"" she stated, rolling her eyes.

I think his films may qualify as 'self-published' as he may be printing up the cash needed for these projects in his basement and propelling them forward on his own coin.

Too many jokes can be made about the man's first name and the apparent writing and overall quality of his films. It almost seems like a sport or a hobby for some to denigrate and chase down Ewe Boll movies and write one-star reviews. It seems almost unanimous that if anyone should be chased away from the art of film-making it should be Uwe. Some have even said that he should make a movie with Casper Van Dien and Jan Michael Vincent if he really wanted to do something corny and awful. He might even win an Oscar if he did.

In watching this train wreck, I thought several times to turn it off, but I also began to realize just how close to the edge a lot of these films from this genre border on being awful from the casting alone -- let alone the editing. These are probably the two biggest problems with this flick.

It wasn't bad seeing Jason Statham playing a farmer, named Farmer. Why not? It's actually not that anachronistic of a thing. Someone who might've been a blacksmith back then would've been called
'Blacksmith'. No biggie. Seeing 'The Bandit' / Burt Reynolds as the King was interesting but maybe a mistake. Ray Liotta was the only real draw to this movie and preformed rather well as an evil sorcerer. But watching it progress, reminded me of an article I recently read on CNN where they stated that Peter Jackson (of Lord of The Rings fame) courted Sean Connery with 15% of the World-Wide gross from his franchise to play Gandolf. Connery turned it down, and $400 million in the process. I think those films would've been received vastly different in the scenario with Connery as Gandolf. It might have even ruined it. Connery is quite a presence, but Ian McKellen immortalized himself as Gandolf.

Nobody in this picture immortalizes themselves at all. Leelee Sobieksi proves once again that she just looks weird, acts weird and talks weird. John Rhys-Davis should lay off the Hair Club for Men and retire. Ron Perlman was sadly and drastically underused and Matthew Lillard looks as though he was picked out of the food-court at the Glendale Gallaria Mall.

But good ol' Uwe is cranking out four more flicks scheduled to be released 2009 and 2010. He's definitely here to stay.",1224979200,,2929,4.507547169811321
3087261,2,B0012DUT3M,"Ok first of all for those of you that do not know the fantasy genre this movie is not a bad copy of Lord of the Rings. That is like saying that every detective movie that have a though guy private eye in a long shapeless coat is a rip off of whatever movie in that category is most known. This movie present a very, very typical, stereotype fantasy story. It is uninventive yes but it is not plagiarizing.

And that is about as much good as can be said about this movie. There is really to much wrong with it to put a finger on anything, the lines sounds stupid, the special effects is goofy, the story line is so predictable you will know the story 15 minutes into this travesty of a movie. The characters are paper thin, the battle scenes, witch there are allot of, just drag on and on and is badly choreographed. This movie really do not have anything good with it.

The story, is the typical fantasy scenario, the evil, dimwitted relative of the old but wise king have allied himself with a evil mage to seize power, a nobody, a common farmer is dragged into this to save the damsel in distress and he just so happens to be the king's long lost son and the only one that can save the kingdom. The evil mage have an army of monsters that have to be over come yadda yadda yadda you can guess at the rest. There is not even a hint of originality in this.

If you are a huge fantasy fan like me, you might want to see this movie if for no other reason that there are such a limited number of classical fantasy, with that I mean the type of fantasy story that happens in a world that is pre industrial revolution where magic is real and so on, movies to choose from, so we are rather starved in that regard. And becouse the better such movies do, the more chance it is there will be more and better fantasy movies in the future.

This movie do not deserve the two stars I gave it. It get two stars simply becouse it belong to a niche that is sorely limited in it's selection so that it's fans will take whatever we get. If you are not a huge fan of fantasy movies however do not waste your money, then this travesty of a movie most likely will not appeal to you in the least, for trust me, it is really, really bad.",1224547200,,2214,4.106235565819861

The only thing redeeming in this whole film was that I didn't waste $10 on it. Instead I wasted only $3. I came into this expecting to see a medieval fantasy and was left with utter crap.

I really like Jason Statham and he tries hard with this crap script. The dialogue was just so god awful I was left feeling I could have done better. The action scenes weren't bad, but it's not like we haven't seen it before.

Leelee was extra, the king was extra, Matthew Lillard's character...stupid. If his character was supposed to be funny I'm stil waiting for the first joke to start. He was just awful. I'm more than willing to say it was the crap script because he can normally make me chuckle. Not in this one.

Not to mention the scenes flipped from one to another and you're left wondering why.

And don't get me started on Ray Liotta. Good actor, but here it's like you're hoping he just did this because he was bored and wanted to do a crap film. Not convincing at all.

Overall this movie is crap. The more I think about the more pissed off I become that I spent even $3 to see this. I mean if you still want to watch it then wait until it comes on TV. Then make sure you have nothing else to do, are bored out of your skull and high. Then watch it. You'll still probably hate it.

After sitting through his previous features, I doubted that Uwe Boll was capable of making anything that even resembled a good movie, but apparently I was wrong. Through a $60 million budget, an all-star cast, and a really weird script, ""In the Name of the King"" is without a doubt the most solid picture that our favorite director has made in recent memory. But then again, being a Boll film, this means little: if judged against anything other than his own films, ""King"" looks sloppy, mediocre, and faces stiff charges of blatantly copying from Peter Jackson's ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy. Rest assured, it's a bad movie; the question simply is ""how bad?"" Care to find out? Well, get ready for a long review...

The story: in the kingdom of Ehb, the power-hungry mage Galian (Ray Liotta,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Hannibal/dp/B00003CXSP/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Hannibal</a>) has turned his power against the elderly King Konreid (Burt Reynolds,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Boogie-Nights/dp/B000PAAJZ6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Boogie Nights</a>). Aided by the king's treacherous nephew Duke Fallow (Matthew Lillard,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Scooby-Doo/dp/B002YU4QT0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Scooby-Doo</a>), Galian prepares to overthrow the kingdom. All that stands in his way are the efforts of the king's loyal magus (John Rhys-Davis, ""The Lord of the Rings"") and a simple farmer (Jason Statham,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Transporter/dp/B00008AOVL/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Transporter</a>) seeking revenge for the death of his family.

Because it needs naming, here's the rest of the cast: in addition to the aforementioned, there's Ron Perlman (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Hellboy/dp/B001AK3S4Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Hellboy</a>) as Farmer's surrogate father, Leelee Sobieski (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Joan-of-Arc/dp/B00005QCVQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Joan of Arc</a>) as the magus' daughter and Galian's lust interest, Claire Forlani (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Meet-Joe-Black/dp/0783233477/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Meet Joe Black</a>) as Farmer's wife, Brian White (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/D-O-A-Dead-or-Alive/dp/B000I0RNXY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">D.O.A. - Dead or Alive</a>) as the commander of the king's armies, and  Kristanna Loken (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Terminator-3-Rise-of-the-Machines/dp/B001TK80C0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines</a>) as the leader of a mystical tree-dwelling folk. Without a doubt, this is one of the most unique casts that have ever been assembled in a single film, and I have no doubt that even years from now, fans will still be discussing just how Boll got all of these folks together. With that said, the acting really is a mixed bag. Rhys-Davis is the best performer in the movie, opposite of Liotta, who performs as though Anthony Hopkins is still feeding him his own brain. With the exception of Brian White (who puts the most effort of anybody into his role but still kinda stinks), everyone else falls into a grey category, having highs and lows but not really standing out yet occasionally blundering into unwatchable depths of overacting.

What made this movie so surprising to me is how much Boll has managed to improve his formula. Gone are the flashbacks, the gratuitous nudity, the shock violence, and general mindlessness that perpetuated throughout his earlier attempts. What we have here is a focused story that has definite heroes, villains, and changes in tone. But while the plot is more alert than usual, it's still considerably scatterbrained: the story jumps from place to place as though it were necessary that the viewer know exactly what is going on in every other location while an otherwise isolated event is taking place. This causes not only for disorientation, but also cuts the mood of any scene in half since the event being transitioned to is usually of the completely opposite temperament (e.g. Tarish and Muriella spar harmlessly while Farmer's family comes under attack). Also, even though I enjoyed the simple labeling of good and evil in characters, their intentions were always way too obvious for my liking: you KNOW that Fallow is a bad guy from the moment he shows up on the screen. What's worse, this transparency lets the viewer know what's going to happen sometimes an hour before it does: you KNOW that Muriella will come to come to odds with Galian the moment the film opens and you see the two of them kissing as though their mouths were full of novocain.

Where technical aspects are concerned, the most notable improvement is that Boll has learned how to actually shoot a movie: the cinematography looks decent, and with the aid of choreographer Siu-Tung Ching (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/House-of-Flying-Daggers/dp/B0007Q6VXC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">House of Flying Daggers</a>), the action has never looked better. Alas, these are only superficial pluses, too: the camerawork is basic, and even if you can get over the thought of kung fu in a medieval environment, the fights are edited so erratically that it's difficult to follow the action, especially in the event of a big battle scene where there are dozens of characters on the screen. These ""epic"" battles are also a weak point: they should serve as highlights of the film, but end up only slowing everything down. Boll is completely clueless as to how to shoot a fight of such proportions, for instead of pulling the camera back to show off scale, he brings the camera in real close, marginalizing any awe that such a scene should instill and making it look oddly claustrophobic.

As an afterthought, the graphics are fairly nice: Galian's portal through which he controls the Krug is cool, as is the disapparating effect the magi use, and the final battle between Galian and Farmer is a triumph of the computer.

What bothers me the most about ""King"", however, is the very blatant ripping off of material from ""Lord of the Rings"". The list really doesn't stand in favor of any contradictory opinion: the Krug are orc wannabes, the armored riders will remind anybody of the Nazgul, the woodland people are two pointed ears away from elves, Galian's domain is Mordor by any other name, and the final battle is filmed in the dark and in the rain - just like the battle of Helm's Deep. Smaller scenes like Tarish and Muriella sparring (like Aragorn meeting Eowyn) and Muriella donning armor to fight (like Eowyn) stand as a backdrop to large plot devices like Farmer, Norick (Perlman), and Bastian (Will Sanderson: Legolas Clone) banding together a'la the Fellowship, as well as the revelation (SPOILER ALERT!) that Farmer is the king's son and heir...just like Aragorn was. Then again, Boll frequently compared his movie to ""LotR"" before it was released, so I'm not really surprised.

On one hand, we've got some definite improvement coming out of the House of Boll, yet on the other, we've got a movie that has promised to keep the director away from other big budget projects for a long time. While I like the movie more than I should, there's enough nonsense here to decree ""In the Name of the King"" a certified rotten tomato...and that's before you witness Solana's laughable crying scene, arrows that magically change direction between shots, the longest deathbed sequence ever, and the incredibly soppy and dopey dialogue (e.g. ""My girlish stupidity has damaged him!""). Essentially, Uwe Boll tried to squeeze all three of the ""Lord of the Rings"" films into a two-hour movie and didn't even do a good job of pretending that they were his own ideas. I haven't touched on whether or not the film remains true to its video game roots, but that's a moot point: Boll wasn't attempting to make an adaptation - he was trying his hand at being a director of ""epic movies"" like Peter Jackson or Ridley Scott. Time will tell whether he can surprise me again by actually redeeming himself, but at his snail's pace, I probably won't even like movies like this anymore by the time his first good one is released.",1222905600,3,8504,5.765127388535032

The script is really very badly written, and the acting just as bad. The transition between scenes is also amateurish. This movie was a waste of really good talent.",1221955200,,477,4.623529411764705

3087269,1,B0012DUT3M,"Once upon a time, a brilliant and talented cult director made a spectacular fantasy epic, full of love, monsters, epic battles and noble kings. It became a cinematic classic.

This is not that movie.

But that doesn't stop Uwe Boll from inflicting another ghastly video-game adaptation on the innocent viewing public, after scrabbling for high-fantasy shreds straight from the wastepaper basket of Peter Jackson. It's not quite his worst work, but it's still a horrendous, vomitous, hilariously wretched experience that inspires pain, tears of laughter, and perhaps a drinking game or two.

A farmer wittily named Farmer (Jason Statham) is living in agricultural bliss with his wife (Claire Forlani) and son. But then a bunch of krugs (low-budget orcs) attack -- kid dies, wife is kidnapped. Naturally Farmer vows bloody gruesome revenge, and teams up with his brother-in-law and neighbor (Ron Perlman, who deserves better than this) to help get said revenge.

But of course, this is no isolated incident -- the unspeakable windbag King Konreid (Burt Reynolds) and his hired wizard Merick (John Rhys-Davies) are opposing the malevolent wizard (Ray Liotta) and his vast army of faceless krugs. But naturally it falls to our humble butt-kicking Farmer to somehow defeat the evil wizard and save the day. And yes, the climax will involve killer books.

It's damning ""In the Dane of the King: A Dungeon Siege Tale"" with faint praise to say that this is among Uwe Boll's better efforts. After all, this is not only the director who showed his cinematic ability by literally pummeling his critics -- this is the director who has produced some of the dreckiest, most ghastly films ever to make it into distribution (rather than direct-to-DVD).

As a fantasy experience, ""In the Name of the King"" is dull, drab and shlocky. The settings are pretty but overcast, the ""fantasy"" moments are intensely cheesy (swinging on leafy ropes!), and the fight scenes are well-choreographed but full of wild anachronisms -- including kung-fu. Seriously. Despite a relatively big budget, ""In the Name of the King"" feels like a bunch of dudes went to a Renaissance Faire and decided to stage their own fantasy film. After a few beers.

Granted, none of that inherently marks it as an Uwe Boll film. That is reserved for random ninja that show up (you can hear Boll thinking, ""Eff Jackson! It's my fantasy movie, so I can have what I want -- and I want NINJAS!""), humble farmers who fight like Jet Li, maudlin dramatic moments, and truly ghastly dialogue. When it isn't stilted (""Those who you fight... we will help you fight them"") it's hilariously pompous (""Wisdom is our hammer"").

At the same time, Boll is shamelessly aping Jackson's ""Lord of the Rings."" No, not just the sets and makeup, although many of these are shamelessly (and less realistically) cribbed. He attempts the same sweeping cinematography and score, but inserted at random and without any kind of dramatic payoff. By the finale, we've also been assaulted by airy elfin sprites who desperately need a smackdown from Legolas' long-knives.

As for the characters, you can find them in any rotten half-baked ""high fantasy"" novel -- aging king, treacherous noble, good wizard, bad wizard, and valiant peasants. The actors appear to be painfully aware of this fact.

To make matters worse, Statham is playing the same role he's basically played in dozens of other movies -- the stone-faced man of action out to kick some butt. It feels like someone cut-and-pasted the dude from ""Transporter"" right into this movie. Reynolds creakily sleepwalks through his rotten speeches, and Liotta has apparently decided to embrace the sheer silliness and run with it. As for Kristanna Loken... well, she played Bloodrayne. Nuff zed about her acting ability.

The only cast members who manage to bring any kind of dignity to their roles are Perlman and Rhys-Davies. Rhys-Davies actually works quite well as a kindly old wizard, while Perlman brings more presence and power to the screen than Statham does.

With that in mind, turning out a ""Director's Cut"" is a little like sprucing up the label of a strychnine bottle, and making a blu-ray is like using a magnifying glass on a decaying log. So of course they're turning one out -- a 162-minute director's cut with forty five extra minutes of Boll's work. Somehow I doubt that given the horrific quality of those first 120 minutes, that those cut minutes will improve matters -- the theatrical version was already too long for its ghastly flimsy storyline.

You can guess what kind of movie ""In the Name of the King - A Dungeon Siege Tale"" will be just by its title, but it dips into new levels of ghastly cheeze that few fantasy movies have managed to. A milestone in fantasy cinema -- the worst of its kind thus far.",1220313600,37,4797,4.929368029739777

I didn't even get through it. I stopped it just before LeeLee Sobieski walked out of the castle with her armour on...

For one, the acting was HORRIBLE. And whose idea was it to cast Burt Reynolds as a king? Or who in their right mind would ever put Ray Liotta in a film? He is a terrible actor!! Jason Statham was the only reason I wanted to see this film, but even he was a major disappointment!

Also, what was with the accents?! None of the characters spoke with a constant accent, which would have established that these people were from the same land. The King had an American accent. The nephew, I believe, played by Matthew Lillard -who I very much enjoy, aside from this film- spoke with an English accent that he had a very hard time pulling off and some other guy spoke with some other foreign accent...my list goes on and on.

Everyone was pretty lousy, but Ray Liotta and Burt Reynolds take the cake. These guys didn't mesh with the movie at all and really felt tacked on because of their acting status from previous films.  Second issue has to be the very poor fight choreography throughout the entire film.  The only reason I even picked this up was because Jason Statham is the lead role and he's excellent in all his other films. The fighting in this is the worst ever, and is definitely not going to improve his career as a martial arts action star.  My last issue is with the overall story, can you say snooze fest ?

3087279,2,B0012DUT3M,"Yes, this one is really, really bad.  Uwe Boll has developed something of a garbage can reputation in recent years, and turkeys like this aren't going to get him out of the dog house with many fans.

The plot:  an evil sorcerer has raised a bestial army and is working with a traitor in the King's court to conquer the land.  But when he steps on the innocent family of a farmer named...well, Farmer...he makes an enemy more dangerous than anybody could have foreseen.  Can Farmer and some newfound allies (the King's wizard, his somewhat precocious daughter, a clan of female tree sprites) put an end to the evil uprising before all is lost?

It sounds generally Tolkien-esque, but please don't even go there.  This might have made a good movie if certain things had been handled properly, but poor writing, direction, and questionable casting doom this picture from the get-go.

Mind you, I don't uniformly hate all of Uwe Boll's pictures.  Boll has his faults, but he can also sometimes capture some very unique shots that bring a fresh perspective to movie action and suspense.  Alas, IN THE NAME OF THE KING deserves all the negative reviews it got.  There are so many things gone wrong in this movie I'm not sure where to even start.  The dialogue is often laughable, sometimes painful.  The action is usually poorly choreographed so that what should be exciting is instead simply boring.  There are a few asides concerning war and its cruelty but certainly never anything thought-provoking, just trite.  And the aforementioned cast...just look at all the great actors in this one: Jason Statham as Farmer, Ray Liotta, Leelee Sobieski, John Rhys-Davies, Ron Perlman, Kristianna Loken, Matthew Lillard, Brian J. White, Burt Reynolds...but it's all for naught.  Whether it's just the poor script or the director's inability to motivate his actors or both, the fact is most of the performances are way below par.  Statham is the star, and certainly an adept action performer, but his character is too stupid to stand a chance.  His fight scenes are way over the top, even by the standards of fantasy/action.  How does a farmer learn what amounts to medieval kung-fu out in the sticks?  He never wears armor, carries pedestrian weapons, and has no formal training in combat whatsoever--and yet he's a worldbeater.  Ray Liotta is usually a can't-miss prospect as anybody's bad guy, but he comes off as a poor caricature of himself in this one with some of the film's very worst lines.

There are a few plusses, though not many.  The set design and special effects are of good quality, so that at least everything looks nice and suitably medieval.  The music is pretty good and helps set the right tone.  Every now and then there's a neat stunt or action scene, and the magical climax is visually impressive.  That's about it.

I have seen worse movies, and I can't say I regret renting IN THE NAME OF THE KING because it's one of the film's that's so bad it's kind of fun.

3087282,3,B0012DUT3M,"In the Name of the King: A Dungeon Siege Tale (Uwe Boll, 2007)

Why do I keep watching Uwe Boll movies? Well, in this case, it was kind of a gimme; Dungeon Siege is one of my favorite games from the last decade. I couldn't not see this, even if I was fully aware Boll was going to make a mishmash out of it. But, to my surprise, In the Name of the King, while being only loosely (at best) based on the game, doesn't suck.

Okay, let me qualify that; it doesn't suck nearly as badly as all of Uwe Boll's other videogame-themed extravaganzas. You can't compare it to, say, a Kieslowski film, but if you go in with the attitude that you can, you should be well aware that you're bound to be disappointed. It's also only very loosely based on the original game (the starting scenario will look kind of familiar, and the krug are there, of course, but man, that trip to Stonebridge was quick, and it only deviates farther from there), so if you're looking for the big battle at the end, sorry. But taken on its own merits, and compared only to Uwe Boll's other movies, this one is Oscar-quality. Of course, if you broaden your horizons a bit and compare it to, say, the back catalogue of Harry Reems, it starts to take on those Uwe Boll dimensions again, but still.

In any case, the action centers on Farmer (The Italian Job's Jason Statham), who is, of course, a farmer. His life is simple, at least until the krug invade stonebridge, led by some sort of shadow warriors. Farmer's wife and kid are in Stonebridge, of course, so Farmer, accompanied by his old friend Norick (Ron Perlman), heads off to the city to beat the stuffing out of some krug and rescue his loved ones. That doesn't go terribly well, but Farmer's fighting prowess does attract the attention of King Konried (Burt Reynolds) and the king's closest advisor, Merick (John Rhys-Davies). Much of the rest of the film consists of either Farmer fighting krug or Merick trying to wrangle Konried and Farmer into a meeting so he can drop the Big Plot Twist on them.

Now, the names I've already mentioned should have informed you that this is not your typical Uwe Boll joint, and when I add in Leelee Sobieski as Merick's daughter, Ray Liotta as a renegade mage, Claire Forlani as Farmer's wife, Matthew Lillard as the king's power-hungry wastrel nephew, and a handful of other instantly recognizable actors (even Kristianna Loken, who almost had her career destroyed with her last involvement in a Boll picture, is back), you'll start to get an idea of the big picture here. Boll does, of course, retain his knack of getting the worst performances out of his actors that he can-- it's hard to believe Ray Liotta is the same guy who was in GoodFellas, or Leelee Sobieski the same woman who played Joan of Arc-- but still, comparatively, it's not outright awful. Despite some wooden delivery, for example, Burt Reynolds' performance is head and shoulders over the of John Malkovich in Eragon in a similar role. And Statham gets a chance to do what he does best-- say few words and beat things up. John Rhys-Davies is always a pleasure, however lowbrow, to see on a screen, as is Perlman, and even Loken manages to redeeem herself somewhat (truth be told, I always did blame Boll for how awful Bloodrayne was; Loken just got caught in the crossfire).

Don't get me wrong, it's still a bad movie in almost every respect, but it's certainly the best thing Uwe Boll has ever done. I wonder if he's actually learning from the huge, unbearable mistakes he made with some of his previous movies. Could he actually be improving as a director?

3087287,1,B0012DUT3M,"Once upon a time, a brilliant and talented cult director made a spectacular fantasy epic, full of love, monsters, epic battles and noble kings. It became a cinematic classic.

This is not that movie.

But that doesn't stop Uwe Boll from inflicting another ghastly video-game adaptation on the innocent viewing public, after scrabbling for high-fantasy shreds straight from the wastepaper basket of Peter Jackson. It's not quite his worst work, but it's still a horrendous, vomitous, hilariously wretched experience that inspires pain, tears of laughter, and perhaps a drinking game or two.

A farmer wittily named Farmer (Jason Statham) is living in agricultural bliss with his wife (Claire Forlani) and son. But then a bunch of krugs (low-budget orcs) attack -- kid dies, wife is kidnapped. Naturally Farmer vows bloody gruesome revenge, and teams up with his brother-in-law and neighbor (Ron Perlman, who deserves better than this) to help get said revenge.

But of course, this is no isolated incident -- the unspeakable windbag King Konreid (Burt Reynolds) and his hired wizard Merick (John Rhys-Davies) are opposing the malevolent wizard (Ray Liotta) and his vast army of faceless krugs. But naturally it falls to our humble butt-kicking Farmer to somehow defeat the evil wizard and save the day. And yes, the climax will involve killer books.

It's damning ""In the Dane of the King: A Dungeon Siege Tale"" with faint praise to say that this is among Uwe Boll's better efforts. After all, this is not only the director who showed his cinematic ability by literally pummeling his critics -- this is the director who has produced some of the dreckiest, most ghastly films ever to make it into distribution (rather than direct-to-DVD).

As a fantasy experience, ""In the Name of the King"" is dull, drab and shlocky. The settings are pretty but overcast, the ""fantasy"" moments are intensely cheesy (swinging on leafy ropes!), and the fight scenes are well-choreographed but full of wild anachronisms -- including kung-fu. Seriously. Despite a relatively big budget, ""In the Name of the King"" feels like a bunch of dudes went to a Renaissance Faire and decided to stage their own fantasy film. After a few beers.

Granted, none of that inherently marks it as an Uwe Boll film. That is reserved for random ninja that show up (you can hear Boll thinking, ""Eff Jackson! It's my fantasy movie, so I can have what I want -- and I want NINJAS!""), humble farmers who fight like Jet Li, maudlin dramatic moments, and truly ghastly dialogue. When it isn't stilted (""Those who you fight... we will help you fight them"") it's hilariously pompous (""Wisdom is our hammer"").

At the same time, Boll is shamelessly aping Jackson's ""Lord of the Rings."" No, not just the sets and makeup, although many of these are shamelessly (and less realistically) cribbed. He attempts the same sweeping cinematography and score, but inserted at random and without any kind of dramatic payoff. By the finale, we've also been assaulted by airy elfin sprites who desperately need a smackdown from Legolas' long-knives.

As for the characters, you can find them in any rotten half-baked ""high fantasy"" novel -- aging king, treacherous noble, good wizard, bad wizard, and valiant peasants. The actors appear to be painfully aware of this fact.

To make matters worse, Statham is playing the same role he's basically played in dozens of other movies -- the stone-faced man of action out to kick some butt. It feels like someone cut-and-pasted the dude from ""Transporter"" right into this movie. Reynolds creakily sleepwalks through his rotten speeches, and Liotta has apparently decided to embrace the sheer silliness and run with it. As for Kristanna Loken... well, she played Bloodrayne. Nuff zed about her acting ability.

The only cast members who manage to bring any kind of dignity to their roles are Perlman and Rhys-Davies. Rhys-Davies actually works quite well as a kindly old wizard, while Perlman brings more presence and power to the screen than Statham does.

You can guess what kind of movie ""In the Name of the King - A Dungeon Siege Tale"" will be just by its title, but it dips into new levels of ghastly cheeze that few fantasy movies have managed to. Think ""Eragon"" for grown-ups, but with worse CGI.",1210896000,,4280,4.9789915966386555
3087288,2,B0012DUT3M,"This movie was a pure waste of time - the story lacks originality as its basic premise of good fighting evil seems to be a rehash of other famous fantasy classics like LOTR. Director Uwe Boll who also gave us movies like BloodRayne seems bent on insulting viewer's sensibilities by producing fantasy movies that lack originality.

The basic premise here - Jason Statham (The Transporter) plays Farmer, a simple laborer who gets embroiled in an epic battle of good versus evil when Duke Fallow (Matthew Lillard) conspires with a magician named Gallian (Ray Liotta) to overthrow King Konreid (Burt Reynolds). There are other familiar names in the cast -Leelee Sobieski, John Rhys-Davies, Ron Perlman, Claire Forlani, Kristanna Loken, Brian J. White , all of whom add little to pique one's interest in the movie.

The acting on the whole is pretty average, and the Krugs look like they are a poor imitation of the Orcs from LOTR.

Ray Liotta may look scary and intimidating, but his ability to ACT the part of the villian leaves much to be desired. John Rhys-Davies (shaking my head), I just want to pinch his cheeks as I would a confused grandfather.

While I can understand and even agree with some of the criticisms posted, I can't believe the hammering this film received. Now, I'm a fantasy fan... meaning, I am used to, and don't object to, fantasy. I go looking for it and it's here in this movie. I thought this movie scored well in many ways. Sure, it's over-the-top... it's fantasy! I want evil wizards, unarmored heroes, total evil vs. total good, all the things that don't exist except in fantasy. Here are a few of the things I liked about this movie:
1) Jason Statham... normally one of my least favorite actors, more watchable than usual in this heroic role.
2) Burt Reynolds... fun to see him again and his king wasn't so bad.
3) Ray Liotta... over-the-top, just as an evil wizard should be.
4) Claire Forlani, more beautiful than ever, does an great job as the brave wife and mother... worth destroying a kingdom for, anyday.
5) Leelee Sobieski... an excellent job, would have liked to see her part even bigger but it seems we have a deeply cut version here in the states. I'll be looking for the uncut version.
6) John Rhys-Davies... does his usual fine job, considering what he has to work with.
7) Not to go too long, many of the supporting performances were worthy and well done. I had no trouble watching this movie and found many touches that lent it a unique personality. The reviewers that panned it were unfair, IMO, and many of the criticisms of the director were unfounded. This movie was not boring. Of course, it was predictable, it's fantasy! We do want a happy ending, no? I liked the fast pacing, the skipping from scene to scene, the occasional humor, the special effects, and overall, the entire movie. A good job by all!

Substitute Jason Statham (Farmer) for Viggo Mortensen (Strider), John Rys-Davies (Merick) for Ian McKellen (Gandalf) and an army of Krugs instead of Orcs and you're good to go.

The movie started very nicely. At first, I thought Uwe made it this time because the setting was great, the scenery and the characters were flawless, you can almost feel the fresh breeze.  When the Krug attacked I didn't mind the ridiculous costume the stuntmen were wearing, they were only footsoldiers, they do the same thing in every movie.  Thanks to Mr. Statham, we enjoy the farmers struggle to save his family.  Right after the scene where farmer meets the king, everything goes wrong.

It also features a reluctant warrior hero by the name of Farmer (Jason Statham) who is forced to give up his pacifist ways after the dastardly Krug - and the sorcerer who telepathically controls them - kill his son and kidnap his wife.

""In the Name of the King"" may seem novel and exciting to anyone who hasn't already immersed himself in the glories of the ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy, but for the rest of us, the film is little more than an awkward mix of sentimentality and low comedy, punctuated by endless uber-violent battle sequences.  Moreover, the acting styles range wildly in caliber and tone.  Ray Liotta and Matthew Lillard are all flamboyant mannerisms and hambone line-readings as the evil sorcerer and the king's callow nephew, respectively, while Statham treats the whole thing with a gravity and seriousness worthy of a ""Becket.""  Similarly, as the magus to the king, John Rhys-Davies delivers his lines as if he were giving a command performance in a Royal Shakespeare Company production of ""Hamlet.""  At least Burt Reynolds, who exercises some restraint in his performance, avoids unduly embarrassing himself as the king.

3087306,2,B0012DUT3M,"I'll start right out by saying that, though I've done my fair share of IMDB research, I've never actually sat through a complete showing of a Uwe Boll movie before. Of course, Dungeon Siege being the only game I've ever played that has been given the dubious honor of Herr-Boll's treatment, I had to give this bloated flick the once over. Join me on my own ""epic"" quest to understand exactly what happened to the last few hours of my life.

==SOURCE MATERIAL==
Dungeon Siege is practically a beat-em-up game that masquerades as an RPG. (For definitions on these acronyms, look elsewhere.) The game is undeniably fun in the same vein that Diablo was fun because you killed evil monsters and got better loot to kill more evil monsters. The game featured vast, colorful landscapes, interesting creatures, and (watch out!) some very unique DUNGEONS to explore with your character and his/her motley crew of NPC helpers. The basic story of the game was that the Kingdom of Ehb is under (watch out!) SIEGE by Orc-like Krug for some unknown reason and you, a simple farmer, are caught up in the fight when the ravenous hordes kill/kidnap your family.

==THE CAST==
As you can infer from the paragraph above, this game is not something that comes pre-loaded with all the character backstory, history, and setting needed to conduct a swords-and-sorcery epic. Still, Uwe Boll has managed to create a Kingdom of sorts that in some ways hearkens back to the original look and feel of the Dungeon Siege game. The opening town of Stonebridge, for instance, kind of reminds me of the actual opening village from the computer game. Unfortunately the opening sequences feature Ray Liotta groping Leelee Sobieski against cuts of CGI castle exteriors with lighting and lens flares stolen directly from Minas Tirith composites.

But I digress ...

The story in this movie follows the basic plot of the game. Our main character is a stoic farmer named Farmer played by Jason Statham. He goes by the name Farmer because he is a farmer. There is a fleeting reference made to the fact that he believes men ""become what they do ..."" or something like that. Thankfully it seems the Farmer is the only man in the Kingdom of Ehb that follows this rationale. (It would really suck to have a legion of 1000 soldiers all named Soldier.) The Farmer lives with his wife Solanna (Played by the fawnish Claire Forlani) and their son whose name is of no consequence.

His neighbor is a talkative, boorish old man played by Ron Perlman. His character is named Norick and he has known Farmer for a very long time. Apparently Norick had ""adopted"" Farmer when he was just a boy. Norick talks about wanting to enlist in the King's army because he finds the simple joys of tending the crops somewhat boring.

Speaking of the King, he's played by Burt ""The Bandit"" Reynolds who apparently thinks he's in simultaneously a western or a daytime soap opera. The King is served by Merick, his court Magus played by John Rhys-Davies who adds some much needed style to this picture. (There are also an assortment of useless guards and generals that add nothing to the overall movie.)

Opposing the good people of Ehb are the evil sorcerer Gallian, played by Ray Liotta, who, under any other circumstance probably could have made this role work. I get the feeling he walked onto the set and told Uwe Boll he was going to play a sexually frustrated frat boy with magical, swirling cloud powers and the director said ""Action!""  Gallian commands the vicious Krug in his bid to take over the Kingdom and employs the King's zany nephew Fallow in his scheme. Fallow is played by Matthew Lillard who acts drunk all the time and probably was. Out of all the cast members, he seems to have the most fun. Merick's daughter (played by Leelee Sobieski) also shows up sometimes.

Here in this list of actors and actresses lies the fundamental question: How did Uwe Boll enlist so many talented people to work on his project? It's common knowledge that his movies are all ... questionable. People like Statham, Rhys-Davies, Perlman, and even Burt Reynolds can't be that hard up for cash. I know there are contracts to fill, but still! My personal assumption is that these people simply wanted the experience of working with Uwe Boll just to see what it was really like. So many of them are stone-faced and uninterested in what's going on that it actually sort of engages the audience in a macabre way. The suspension of reality in this movie becomes the suspension of your OWN reality. You actually begin to believe you're on the set with these actors, suffering through it alongside them.

For all it's worth, Jason Statham sticks to his guns and delivers a fairly good performance in a role that demands no more from him than a few good sword fights. Ron Perlman generally looks like he's only slightly amused by his surroundings. Burt Reynolds and Ray Liotta are both hilariously out of place making their performances even more grotesquely enjoyable. About the only thing that fits is John Rhys-Davies as the kindly Magus who sometimes has a useful thing to add to a conversation, albeit through poorly written dialogs.

==THE MOVIE==
This is a film that begs, borrows, cheats, and steals from every other great fantasy epic up to and including the Lord of the Rings. From this series it gleans camera shots, atmospheric lighting, production designs, and generally mimicks everything that made LOTR good, or at least memorable. The fight scenes against the Krug  are going to immediately call forth memories the Fellowship's battles and of Helm's Deep. King Konried's castle halls seem to be designed by the dwarves of Moria.

Speaking of dwarves ...

In the Dungeon Siege game there were dwarven mines to explore along with your standard crypts and dungeons. There were also goblin hideouts with ingenious ""steampunk"" inventions like clockwork centurions and magic-powered flamethrower crossbows! Boll nixes all of these quirks and eccentricities for a world that basically resembles medieval Wales with the addition of forest nymphs. I hasten to mention that there is only one true dungeon setting in the whole of this ""Dungeon Siege Tale"" and it serves as little more than a place for Gallian to threaten the impish Duke Fallow.

Back on topic ...

The movie suffers from several mishaps covering the fields of writing, editing, and general direction. I've included my top ten favorite examples from a list I kept throughout my showing of this movie.

1. Ron Perlman is a very large man best suited for heavy melee combat who is given a pick-axe to fight with along with a bow and arrow setup.

1.5. The main character is a farmer named Farmer.

2. There is a confrontation between Merick and Norick early in the movie where the former purposely gets in the latter's way and moves to question him. There is a buildup of suspense that should lead to a scuffle or at least a shouting match between these two men but leads to ... nothing. The scene cuts to Farmer looking pissed off by himself.

3. Most battle scenes suffer from disorienting jump cuts. I anticipate an argument that this ""technique"" creates a real sense of chaos and confusion when in actuality it just makes people dizzy.

4. Norick and Bastian (Will Sanderson's useless character) fall off a crude rope bridge toward a river below them. There is a cut to Farmer running down a hill to help them and then a cut back to the aforementioned pair IN the river. Where's the splash?

5. King Konried speaks to the survivors of Stonebridge after the Krug attack at the beginning of the movie and asks for volunteers to join the army and help them fight back. Farmer tongue-lashes the King by saying the King's armies should have protected his family when the Krug attacked, but were instead guarding the castle. The problem is pretty much left at that and not addressed afterward.

6. The movie's first main army-on-army clash takes place in a heavily wooded forest with horrible visibility and overall fighting conditions which is bordered by ... a large open field.

7. There are numerous references to God as well as ""gods.""
- Early on Farmer says ""People say God watches over the innocent.""
- At the beginning of the movie Merick witnesses the buildup of Gallian's army and says, ""May the gods save us.""
-Later on Merick quips the classic ""God save the king!""
In short, the movie is inconsistent and all over the ballpark with which culture it's trying to emulate / poke fun at.

8. At one point there are Ninjas.

9. Fencing with broadswords.

10. Several sections of Manos-grade dialog mar the otherwise sturdy performances of Davies and even Matthew Lillard. Shameless theft of fantasy conventions overall.

There are frequent moral quips made by characters including one-liners about virtue, liberty, darkness, honor, vengeance, and seaweed. Unfortunately none if it is cohesive and there are no volumes of written fiction to fall back on for explanation. There is very little backstory given and as far as we know the Kingdom of Ehb comprises about 1000 people. Establishing shots of large cities and surrounding villages might help that slight little nag.

At the end of the movie I made an astonishing discovery: Uwe Boll killed almost every big name actor he had in the movie. Ron Perlman died fairly early in the second act. Burt Reynolds died in battle. John Rhys-Davies died fairly close to the end of the film. Ray Liotta died at the very end. I think it might actually have been his intention to anger audiences at killing off these characters. It's a gigantic ego trip to be able to say, ""I killed (all of the above) in my movie!"" It's also exceptionally cheap.

On the movie as a whole I can only say this: There is a plot, setting, and characters. The pacing could be better and the writing borders on inept, but at least it follows your general movie-making formula so I guess that's something. Hiring a competent editor (or possibly shooting more coverage) might have vastly improved this hastily chopped buffet of sap.

==EXTRAS==
The ""behind the scenes"" featurette is basically four separate clips filmed on a camcorder of actors standing around reading the script or hanging on wires in the middle of doing ""stunts."" There are a few shots of Uwe ""The Man, The Myth, The Legend"" Boll strutting around pretending to direct, but other than that it's a sorry excuse for a special feature. I was really hoping for a commentary track.

There are supposedly extended and deleted scenes also available, but I couldn't bring myself to watch them.

==THE FINAL WORD==
I can't say I could do better, because I don't know the first thing about shooting, directing, editing, or producing a movie. I'm tempted to believe that this romp is the result of one man's obsessive nature. I have no doubt Uwe Boll truly loves movies and what he does. The problem is some people really like doing what they do, but they're still not good at it. It's like the old joke: What do you call a guy who graduates last in his class in medical school?

Doctor.

Still, this movie could be stripped down and rebuilt as a B-grade fantasy slash fest by a graduate film school student and fare better on the critic's scoreboard than any Hollywood-budgeted Uwe Boll kindergarten nightmare project ever would. Boll is on record saying that he is the only ""true genius"" making movies these days. One can only speculate if he's joking or if escalating commitment in his argument against his myriad of critics has seriously made him that delusional. He may also simply operate on a higher plane of existence than the rest of the world.

If Boll were smarter he would stop trying to market his video game knock-offs as true cinema and start selling them as ""Bad Uwe Boll Movies"" for their sheer, pathetic entertainment value. Charging $20 for this DVD, even at Wal-Mart is a criminal enterprise. There is about $6 worth of entertainment in this box and at least a week's worth of use using the DVD as a coaster for your beer while you watch a real film.",1208822400,,12037,4.75911708253359
3087307,3,B0012DUT3M,"Bravo Amanda, you sum up pretty much my own thoughts with a twist of humour. Mind you I gave it a higher score because I guess I enjoyed the movie a little bit more, although I was expecting more with such an impressive cast. Even though I was starting to be very disappointed in Jason Statham's movie roles lately, I truthfully loved him in this one.

I agree that the Ninja dudes do not fit well in this type of movie, and quite frankly, I don't really know why they were even there.

There were other flaws, but in conclusion, I believe it was entertaining and a slightly below-average fantasy movie.",1208736000,,603,4.423423423423423

I was so excited to see he was in another film, and of a slightly different genre.  This movie was lacking something, in a major way.  The screen play was laughable, it sounded like lines my six year would make up.

I'm not going to beat a dead horse, but wait for this one to show up on TV.  There won't be anything to cut out, and you'll have some much-needed commercial time to get away for a couple minutes.

In fact, this movie should probably have gone straight-to-SciFi, so Joel McHale could use it for material on The Soup.

I gave it three stars because though it was no LoTR epic, it wasn't the complete trash others have described it as.  You just have to set your expectations before watching it.  Then manage your expectations and resist the temptation to fast forward just to get through it faster.

This is not as bad as ""Blood Rayne"". Which does not say much but....

The story was very reasonable - old dying king, crappy heirs to the throne, one of whom is trying to usurpe the throne for himself, a strong female character who actually knows how to fight (and when to say no), a nice supporting role for Ron Pearlman.

3087315,2,B0012DUT3M,"The master of error himself, director Uwe Boll strikes again with another video game adaptation, this time around taking on the popular PC series Dungeon Siege with In the Name of the King: A Dungeon Siege Tale.  Jason Statham stars as a farmer named Farmer (seriously) who takes the fight to the evil Gallian (Ray Liotta) after his wife (Claire Forlani) and child are kidnapped.  Along the way are some pretty bad and monotonous action sequences, as well as a surprisingly decent sounding cast that includes Burt Reynolds, Ron ""Hellboy"" Perlman, John Rhys-Davies, Leelee Sobieski, Kristanna Loken, and Matthew Lillard.  What is even more surprising is that In the Name of the King isn't the terrible waste of film that we've come to expect from Uwe Boll, and is by far his best effort yet.  That really isn't saying a whole lot in the long run, but the fact that the film as a whole isn't laughably bad (although there are a good amount of laughable moments, particularly with an overacting and uninterested performance by Liotta) is a nice bonus in itself.  Statham is actually good as the vengeance seeking Farmer, with his rugged and magnetic personality being the main highlight.  All in all, In the Name of the King: A Dungeon Siege Tale is not the ungodly terrible flick from Uwe Boll that you may be expecting, which in itself is a small miracle.",1207785600,14,1354,4.740425531914894

Some of the actors are no good, there is no background into anyone and then when you finally get to the end, you find the movie does not have an ending, it just stops. You are left wondering what happened to half the people. The extended edition may help this but I am doubting it. The script jumps all over, the film making is bad (the colors change totally from one shot to the next, some shots are grainy or fuzzy like shot with a home video camera), the bad guy in the movie is not believable because he looks like Wayne Newton. The movie goes on forever but some parts seem rushed, I could keep going on...",1207526400,4,673,4.224806201550388
3087317,1,B0012DUT3M,"I was initially unfamiliar with Uwe Boll and his 'work', so I half expected a mildly entertaining LoTR rip-off(though I am not a particular fan of those movies either).  That being said, from the first 5 minutes this movie goes from bad to worse.  My friends and I laughed when we saw how horrible the Krugs looked(sort of like a walking mudpile).  We laughed when the farmer (cleverly named Farmer) began to kill them by the dozens with his oddly out of place swordsmanship.  By the third scene we could barely contain ourselves, and the whole affair began to look like an episode of Mystery Science Theatre 3000.

The whole movie reeks of poorly thought out, badly directed, and haphazardly constructed middle school drama class nightmare.  The dialog is so atrocious that the 'saddest' scenes has us all crying...with laughter!  Of particular note is the performance of Matthew Lillard, as the snarky, feminine nephew of the king.  His frequent cowardly remarks and child-like temper tantrums almost qualify this movie as a comedy.

Aside from his and the other actor's lousy dialog, the movie is further dragged down by the lack of continuity in the plot.  It seems that Uwe Boll might have ADHD as the storyline constantly cuts from one set of characters to another in such a rapid fashion that makes you strain to stay focused on what the heck is going on.  This might all be okay, since an action movie can always compensate with good graphics and compelling fight scenes.  In the Name of The King has neither of these.  The fights are so random and strangely put together, that we started wondering if all of the extras had even auditioned for the same movie.  Repetitive sequences, Krugs lighting themselves on fire, and of course the army of ninjas all contribute to battles that seem to be pulled directly from the mind of an 11 year old boy daydreaming in school.

Although I love a good B-Movie to poke fun at, making one that is 2 1/2 hours long is just cruel (unfortunately, the DVD release is suppose to be about 1 hour longer).  I can't recommend buying this movie (as you will probably return it when the dying king begins to talk of seaweed), but if you feel like watching a silly, cheesy movie I highly recommend renting this one.",1207440000,2,2250,4.6725888324873095

3087320,2,B0012DUT3M,"This movie is so unbelievably bad that I have to break it down into parts for this review.

Overview:

Based on a video game, it comes over as The Lord of the Rings lite, complete with Orc-like Krugs, John Rhys Davies, and a guy with a Legolas hairstyle.  Bad guy Gallian (Ray Liotta) swirls around in clouds of smoke, and does his business through the eyes, ears and lips of really big Krugs who ride horses.

The only redeeming parts are the fight scenes with Statham, and even the battle scenes get monotonous after a while.  And speaking of the battle scenes, we get the infantry and the archers and so on, but why do we have ninjas and Amazonian tree women in the mix-up? (Mind you, Kristanna Loken of the L-Word looks really good wrapped in leaves)

Leelee Sobieski is underutilized as the daughter of Rhys Davies character Merick, but comes into her own at the end, while Matthew Lillard does his Scooby Doo thing mainly for comic relief.

Short Attention Span Summary (SASS)

1. A farmer named Farmer farms his land with his family
2. Marauding Krugs under the command of Gallian attack
3. See Farmer fight
4. Fight Farmer, fight
5. Farmer fights in vain, but lives to fight again
6. The King wants Farmer in his army, but Farmer wants to be a one-man show
7. No man is an island
8. Farmer signs up, but has problems with the armor, which doesn't suit his image
9. Battle scenes
10. Change of leadership occurs
11. Grand finale with bad guy proves that books have power
12. Women totally rock

Characters:

Jason Statham's role

There once was a farmer named Farmer
Who was rugged, but really no charmer
When the Krugs came for battle
He killed them like cattle
Without ever wearing his armor

Ray Liotta's role

There once was a power drunk mage
Who totally failed to engage
He is so badly cast
It will leave you aghast
 As he stinks up his time on the stage

John Rhys Davies' role

Though this ain't The Lord of the Rings
We're glad for the class that he brings
And though he's on his own
There's a Legolas clone
To help the return of the kings

Burt Reynolds' role

We're more than a little bit hurt
To see what's become of old Burt
More tired than mean
He's a creaky machine
Out of gas, and now fully inert

Conclusion:

This movie's no more than a joke
Filled with nothing but mirrors and smoke
With ninjas and magic
The plotline is tragic
And it's NOT Uwe Boll's master stroke.

The female-tree characters are obviously imitation of the tree charactes in Lord of the Ring.

3321512,5,B0012DUT3M,"Let me start off with saying that I have never seen an Uwe Boll picture before entering the theater last Friday night.  I have heard that there are many people in two very fervent camps about his pictures and aptitude.  I am not one of them.

Action is a genre and it takes the archetypes of a particular community and builds characters around them.  Because we file in for the visuals in these films, the script requirements are terrifically simple and rooted in the most extreme of polarities.  Action is one of the leanest genres as it distances the archetype from the character very little so we can recognize, at first glance, the side this character stands on.  In other words - the bad guys are dark and scary, the good guys are noble and wear white.  In this case, they're farmers who speak poetically of the days of old whilst harvesting with their blond and cherubic son.  It is cardboard and that is what it needs to be.

I was totally unprepared for In The Name Of The King: A Dungeon Siege Tale.  I went for the bizarrely assembled cast, though I expected the film to be painful and plodding.  To my surprise I found the extension of a time old, cheap-o Hollywood lineage.  ITNOTK:ADST is a direct heir to schlock films like Cobra Woman and all of those insipid, plaster biblical epics. It casts its spell with overtly simplistic dialogue and a soundtrack which lambasts you into emotional compliance.  But so thrilling is its emotive force, that I could barely breath outside of those gasps the film demanded of me.  It is aligned to cause no confusions - the good are majestic and the bad, either dark and void, or in Ray Liotta's case, palpably so in floor-length leather.

Those gasps, it is fair to mention, did not emit from any of the graphic sequences.  The film looks to have been made for pennies - down to the wan film stock.  No, this is a textbook study in emotional ebb and flow.  What Leni Riefenstahl would have crafted, were she not so artful.  From the opening moments of Statham's Thoreauvian sonnets while tending the land, to Ray Liotta's perfected baddie-hamming, this picture is a cornerstone of the dunderheaded.  Matthew Lillard and Lele Sobeieski duel, for God's sake!  Sure, it is a direct rip on the Lord of the Rings pictures, but it's liberation from creativity allows the story elements free reign to indulge to their furthest potential.  I find it hard to believe I'll have a more fulfilling experience in theaters for a number of months.",1200355200,6,2483,4.621004566210046
3321513,1,B0012DUT3M,"This is a multi-starred film and most of them are minus stars but Burt Reynolds toupee gets 5 stars.  If he actually had hair this is what it would look like.  But Reynolds only gets one star for his death scene which was the talkiest I have ever seen and displayed some of the worst acting and direction I have seen in any movie since the 1950's sci-fi thrillers.  Ray Liotta is a fine actor but he is terrible in this film.  While evil can be dressed in beauty he is overdressed and unconvincingly evil.  He can't sneer, frown, grimace, or provide any convincing evidence that he is actually bad -- he can't even make love convincingly -- so he gets one charity star.  The lead actor -- Stratham aka Farmer -- actually showed a voice inflection which was his demonstration of his acting skill which was otherwise non-existent.  His male pattern baldness was realistic so he gets two stars for realism but only one star for acting or non-acting as the case may be.  The mud-people -- aka the Krug -- were ridiculous.  They would have been better off using zombies rather these creatures left over from Lord of the Rings. Fortunately you never got a close look at these monsters because they would have been so ridiculous they would not have been believable -- wait -- let me think -- they WEREN'T believable.  The dialog (aka screen play) was idiotic and bordered on campy -- starting with the name of the main character -- ""Farmer""  I almost laughed out loud when that was announced.  Of course his fighting skills were supernatural which I guess were necessary to offset his acting ability.  The battle scenes were so poorly photgraphed and had so many jump cuts that it caused vertigo and really didn't give you any feel for the actual battle.  The female character Muriella was very politically correct and given some very politically correct lines and then wasted.  Rather than give her the role of Joan of Arc - they simply dressed her up in armor and that was her contribution to the plot.  The female tree sprites -- or whatever they were -- were peace loving anti-war females who had some of the most politically correct, anti-war lines in the movie and that seemed to be the only reason they were included.  The irony of them tossing aside their pacifism to battle the Krug was not noted so their only purpose was to deliver their anti-war philosophies and then go to war -- sort of the war to end all wars -- they were pointless distractions outside of providing the screenwriter the opportunity to articulate his philosophy.

The only actor that actually contributed to this film was John Rhys-Davis but his part was too little too late to provide any coherence to this mess. Burt Reynolds -- why was he in this film?  He seemed to have mailed in his performance because to call it wooden would be a courtesy.  Partly it was the dialog he was given which was idiotic, his motivations were missing, and he pranced around without actually providing any regal presence and his death scene was the worst I have ever seen in any movie EVER!!  The director of this film should be drummed from the academy and sued for malpractice along with the screenwriter.  So plot one star, personal hygiene minus one star (no one ever bathed or shaved),acting one star, wardrobe one star, direction minus a star, screenplay minus two stars.  This film was not screened for critical review and after seeing it I know why -- AVOID THIS FILM.",1200096000,13,3434,4.6118421052631575
3321514,2,B0012DUT3M,"""In the Name of the King: A Dungeon Siege Tale"" is Uwe Boll's most ambitious film, which is probably why it's also one of his worst. Here's a story that wants to be an epic fantasy but completely skimps on the epic part--the remaining fantasy is occasionally enjoyable at best. The battle sequences are small-scale and oddly claustrophobic, the characters are broadly drawn, and the dialogue is some of the dopiest I've ever heard. I suppose it would have been too much to expect something more, given that this is a film adaptation of a video game. But that really isn't saying much, since Boll's filmography consists largely of video game adaptations, and almost none of them have been decent. I exempt his previous film, ""Bloodrayne,"" simply because it was just mindless enough for the entertainment to sink in. I concede that ""In the Name of the King"" has moments of entertainment, but since most of the film is about as unintentionally campy as a B science fiction film from the 1950s, that's not much of a compliment.

Most of the problems stem from the casting choices: virtually every actor seemed like a square peg in a story full of round holes. Let's begin with the first billed actor, Jason Statham. He plays Farmer, so named because he feels that a man is defined by what he does; much like the archetypal heroes of fantasy plots, Farmer begins as a humble, land-toiling family man, only to eventually discover that his destiny calls for greater things. And yes, he's reluctant to take part in it, since the only life he knows is planting and harvesting crops. But a personal tragedy pushes him into the need for vengeance, a need that will only be met if he joins the King's army to fight the kingdom's enemies. Statham could have been right for this role had he not relied on his macho action-picture persona--Farmer is not too far removed from Frank Martin of the ""Transporter"" films, with his over the top fighting skills and a voice that's as soft and monotone as Steven Segal's.

Next, let's focus on Ray Liotta. He plays a wicked magus called Gallian, and as you might expect, he's gone mad with power and wants complete control of the kingdom. I don't know if I've ever seen an actor more out of place in a film; Liotta has played some evil characters before, but his bland American accent and under-whelming resolve proves that he just can't play evil in a fantasy film. Gallian has a pseudo-love affair with a strong-willed young woman named Muriella (Leelee Sobieski), who doesn't seem to realize that their relationship is a threat to the kingdom. She also doesn't seem to realize that the chemistry between them is nonexistent, despite the fact that he's teaching her to harness her own magical powers. She has powers, by the way, because her father is another magus. His name is Merick (John Rhys-Davies), and he's a good man who's dedicated to the King. He also takes a special interest in Farmer, since he believes him to be a man of great importance.

And then there's Burt Reynolds as King Konreid. As is the case with Liotta, Reynolds is hopelessly miscast, completely lacking any regal or noble onscreen presence. He seemed more like an afterthought, really, which is bad when you consider the prominence of his role. Bloodthirsty creatures called krugs are attacking Konreid's kingdom in droves (and it should come as no surprise they're under the direct control of Gallian); if he wants to stop them, he'll need a strong army and a little help from Farmer, who has an uncanny ability to survive a battle without wearing any armor. Both Farmer and Konreid fail to realize how important they are to each other, which is why Merick is on hand to explain it to them.

Matthew Lillard is the only actor in this film to manage his role accordingly. He plays Konreid's nephew, Duke Fallow, an arrogant, scheming young man who secretly schemes with Gallian. Unlike the other actors, whose straightforward roles leave much to be desired, Lillard goes in the right direction by thoroughly hamming it up. ""In the Name of the King"" would have been much better had it been as over the top as Lillard's performance. But to attempt a serious ""Lord of the Rings"" style fantasy at this scale is laughable, and not in a good way, either.

There are also a number of ill-fitting side characters: Farmer's wife, Solana (Claire Forlani), one of many taken prisoner by the krugs; Farmer's surrogate father, Norick (Ron Pearlman), who tries for comedy relief but gets only the occasional chuckle; Elora (Kristanna Loken), a member of a forest-dwelling, war-hating tribe that swings around on rogue vines. This is about as diverse and interesting as the characterizations get.

The most entertaining part of the film occurs within the final ten minutes: at their final confrontation, Gallian attempts to subdue Farmer with a cyclone of flying books. Not only was it impressive to look at, it was also a delightfully pompous display of power on the part of a sorcerer. I also enjoyed a number of shots showing Gallian surrounded by swirling fog; standing there, he can see through the eyes of a supernatural creature. But there isn't much else to go on, here, which is sad considering how big it wanted to be. I'm sure that ""In the Name of the King: A Dungeon Siege Tale"" will someday be regarded as a milestone of camp, an accidental cult classic screened at midnight movie theaters to the delight of select audiences.

You cannot watch this movie and take it seriously. It is a movie that must be watched with friends, preferably a mix of the boisterous kind (for laughter and jokes), and the cinematically literate kind (so they can explain to you how truly epic a fail this movie really is)  and torn apart while watching. If you watch it by yourself, like several low reviewers, you WILL NOT enjoy it. It is one of those movies that is so bad that it is good. In my opinion, it is on par with ""The Room,"" but it is far less boring and without any of those ""oh-dear-God-I've-been-scarred-for-life"" scenes. But enough apologetics. Let me give you a proper preview: What happens when you base a movie very, very loosely on a video game that no one's heard of? In the Name of the King. What happens when you give a director who has nothing over 11% on Rotten Tomatoes a 60 million dollar budget? In the Name of the King. What happens when he spends the budget on big name, but over the hill actors and skimps on costume design? In the Name of the King. What happens when all the big name actors figure out that the movie is a hopeless cause and instead decide to use it to make fun of their careers? In the Name of the King. What happens when the movie was planned to be cut into two movies, but instead compressed into one? In the Name of the King. What happens when the plot attempts to incorporate as many fantasy cliches in one movie as possible? In the Name of the King. What happens when they run out of time to fit anymore fantasy cliches in one movie? A sequel. Actually two sequels, if that can be believed. Yes, this might be Uwe Boll's greatest masterpiece ever. Also, Jason Statham does his typical B action movie roll well.",1409961600,,1916,4.292817679558011

3321633,3,B0012DUT3M,"IN THE NAME OF THE KING

I have said it before and I will say it again, I am an Uwe Boll fan. Yes it is true and you read that right I am a fan of this mans films. From Postal onward I have really liked them all so I decided to go back and revisit his first ones. Well not really his first ones but from House of the Dead and on, in doing so I actually started with his biggest budgeted one In the Name of the King: A Dungeon Siege Tale. The film was made for 60 million and made two to three million back its opening weekend or something like that.

Farmer is just what his name says he is, a farmer. He is living a normal happy life until the Krugs who are a group of nasty looking creatures attack his village and not kidnap his wife but kill his son. They are controlled by the evil sorcerer Gallian who is looking to take control of the entire kingdom. So farmer and few friends go forth to avenge his son and rescue his daughter.

Now when this film was first released it was trashed by almost everyone. Of course naturally I felt the need to defend it because I thought people were being unfair just because of his last film House of the Dead. So now after re-watching it I must say that maybe people could have been right about some things. Firstly the film doesnt look as bad as people say in fact I thought it was great B level stuff that looked a little better than B level stuff. So as far as the sets, costumes and even the creatures are concerned they are all fun. Which brings us to everything else, and we will start with the script.

Yes this is based on a game but you would think the writing would be better with something to base the story off of. But even with a good story I have to admit that the writing is a little subpar to downright awful at times. But then it hits me that that might be another reason I like it, bad B level dialogue and the acting to go with it. Yes the acting here for the most part is awful and it is surprising when looking at the cast. We will go as they come to me and first up is the lead Jason Statham who is very good here because he is playing an action role he is very good at playing. Next up is Ron Perlman who may be the best in the film and that makes perfect sense to me as he is a great actor.

So far so good and up next is Kristanna Loken who makes a good cameo in a very B Hercules TV Series style moment of the film. John Rhys-Davis seems to be just there but still comes off well and the same can be said for Brian J. White. This brings us to the final three starting with Burt Reynolds who people have straight hated on in this film. I myself thought he was fun in this role plus he is Burt Reynolds, I believe a man like that as king. Next up is the guy who seemed like he just said before shooting I am hamming it up and have fun with this one Matthew Lillard. This dude was so fun and over the top with his hamming I could not help but laugh when he was onscreen, loved it.

This brings us to the one and only Ray Liotta. Going back and seeing him in this now makes me wonder why I didn't notice it the first time around. I really must have but put it out of my mind because I have never seen him this bad. I don't know if he did it on purpose or the direction was wrong or he directed himself and did his way but it was bad. It is one of those things that would have guaranteed this film would have been a classic episode of MST3K. His performance may be the reason to see this film and I really mean that.

The DVD has the shorter cut and some behind the scenes from what I remember but I watched the Blu-Ray with the extended cut. This version also comes with the director commentary of one Uwe Boll. In this commentary you can tell he was excited about this film and it makes you want to root for him, that is until it becomes a commentary less commentary. There are a few times when he answers his phone while doing the track, why was it even on in the first place? One of the times leads to interesting news on one of his next films Farcry. Then there is a moment when he gets up and leaves the room to go get cake & coffee. There is no commentary for a while until he returns with his food and such and explains why he got it. I don't remember this ever happening when it was just one person doing the track.

So over all I completely get why most people hate this film and consider it one of the all time worst. For me though a lot of those reasons are the same things that save the film for me. Sure I will probably never watch this until the need for an Uwe Boll or video game movie fest happens upon my mind but still. Over all I think this is one of those flicks that is bad but also for some good because it is bad.",1400716800,,4699,3.9233997901364113

3321635,3,B0012DUT3M,"I saw Jason Statham was in it, and I was excited because this was going to be a great movie.

Then I saw Uwe Boll directed it, and I was sad because this movie was going to suck.

In the end, it kind of evened out.  I can't say Jason saved it from Uwe, Jason was just Jason.  I think Uwe is starting to get a little better, or at least getting better people around him.

Burt Reynolds as the king was kind of amusing.  It reminded me of my childhood: 9 to 5, and Best Little Whorehouse In Texas, etc.  Only he is the king.

Overall, it wasn't as terrible as the director's name implies.",1399334400,,586,3.9913793103448274
3321636,1,B0012DUT3M,"I usually like fantasy films, even those which are bad - but this thing was too much even for me. Below, more of my impressions. This review in principle doesn't contain SPOILERS.

The story is supposedly about a farmer, who is simply named Farmer (Jason Statham), who lives with his wife (Claire Forlani) and son in a kind of medieval kingdom called Ehb, ruled by aging king Konreid (Burt Reynolds). Then one day the kingdom of Ehb is attacked by the army of a certain Gallian (Ray Liotta), a warlock exiled from the country long time ago. This will of course gravely affect everybody in Ehb, including Farmer and his family. I will say no more about the story.

The story is quite simple and we heard, read and saw it many times - but still, when they are well told, even the oldest and most known stories can be greatly enjoyed. Sadly, in this film, it is absolutely NOT the case. All characters are pale, the acting is wooden, dialogs are without interest, there is no humour, every next scene can be anticipated half an hour earlier, there is nothing original or surprising, action scenes are just a painful repetition of the main hero destroying everything in his path, bad guys are just sword fodder and the main villain is a sad, pathetic joke. All this makes this film so horribly BORING that it was an ordeal to watch it.

The director Uwe Boll got a big budget - 60 millions USD! - and wasted every cent of it, as we don't see anything worth that kind of money on the screen.

Another time the main characters were sitting around the table discussing what to do while they were eating and were drinking from crystal clear perfectly formed wine glasses which they did not have back then. The fight scenes were all the same just a boring slaughter with little tactical sense and the ninjas seemed out of place compared to the costumes and fighting style of the rest of the army.

3321654,4,B0012DUT3M,"I like this movie. I know a lot of people hated on Bowlls saying this was the worst movie ever made but I couldn't disagree more. Sure its no LOTR with a gillion dollar budget, however for a movie based on a video game I think he did a great job. Id say its one of the best dungeon genre video game movies ever made, and compare it to the original Dungeon & Dragons movies this movie blows them away. It has a great cast, Ron Perlman, everything he does is instantly a classic and I was shocked his character gets killed but that's life.  Statham does a great job as well as all of the cast. Statham has become one of my all time favorite action movie actors. I read reviews and people are so overly critical of this movie, its like they work for a competing movie company or are so snobbish in their intelligence they can't find joy in anything. The movie relies more on action and sets and less on overly priced special effects. There is a good amount of special effects but its no GREEN screen movie, which I find Hollywood has relied too much on GREEN SCREEN technology. the special effects are used sparingly and at the right times.  There are people in great well made costumes, I like sets with real buildings, I find it makes the actor get into character and everyone in this movie does it well. Mathew Lillard plays a great P.O.S traitorous bastard. John Rhys-Davies just has to walk on the set and smile to be good. Some people hated on Liotta, normally I would agree cause I got so burned out watching all his mob movies, so it was refreshing to see him play an evil person that didn't talk with a jersey accent. Brian White was excellent, and did well in his training for this movie. His sword fights were flawless. Then there is Burt Reynolds, and I have to say I liked his roll as king and he dies well an with honor. I loved his elite guards with their ninja assassin moves. I know some people commented on how stupid it was, but obviously they have never played the games or these type of games. There were assassins in games as well a our own history. Anyways, Sobiesky though her part is small, is as always smoking hot and could have shown more cleavage but you know at least Kristanna Loken made up for that. Statham was a lucky man to me locking lips with her. When she learns her son is dead you could see the muscles in her face reacting like a real mother would. Very believable and what I liked is that Bowlls didn't focus on the emotion, he showed it and moved on further into he story. You don't need to see ten minutes of someone sobbing over a child, and in this type of movie you don't want some chick flick tear jerker, you want action and believability. I have not see a lot Bowll's other works but for what its worth this was a great movie an I enjoyed it thoroughly.",1376697600,2,2800,4.261278195488722
3321655,4,B0012DUT3M,"And Ray Liotta as the evil wizard??  And...*gasp*...is that Matthew Lillard??

And Uwe Bill directed this?  What sorcery is this?

Those were the things going through my head as I watched In the Name of the King: A Dungeon Siege Tale (hereafter dubbed ITNOTKADST.)  Somehow, as I grabbed the DVD from the bargain shelf at my used video store, three facts blew right by me; one, Uwe Boll directed it; two, it is based off of a video game; and three, everybody hated it.

Now, I'm no fan of Boll, as isn't most of the world, and movies based off of video games generally suck bad.  That is a deal breaker for me, as I am a heavy gamer.  But as I sat there, watching the labyrinthine plot unfurl itself like an arthritic contortionist, something snuck up on me that I didn't expect.  I was having a damn good time.

Yes, the editing was bad.  I've seen worse, but thats no excuse, really.  To understand the plot is to pay closer attention than most people are willing to, and I don't blame them.  Jason Statham is a farmer whose boy is murdered and his wife abducted by the evil Krug (basically orcs) thus pulling him into a confrontation he doesn't want.  On top of those woes, the King (Reynolds) is being plotted against by his wicked nephew (Lillard) and his Mage (John Rhys-Davies) senses the growing evil, while Davies' daughter, a mage herself, is wooed by Liotta, thus endangering the kingdom...

And so on and so on and so on, as John Cleese once said.  The fact is this: nobody remembers Conan the Barbarian and Red Sonja and The Beastmaster and Krull because they were GOOD.  They weren't.  They stunk.  People remember them because they were FUN.

And with ITNOTKADST, I was having a blast.  I like how the village sets don't look too cheesy, and how the King's army had yeoman soldiers in it.  I like how in the battles, you actually see two hundred extras dressed as knights and Krugs and get to watch them slug it out in the mud and pouring rain.  I like the fact that these battles are fairly frequent.  I like that most of the actors take their roles seriously, even Reynolds.  I like how Boll lets the landscapes do most of the talking for him, allowing the mountain crags and rolling fjords to frame his shots as the heroes trudge on their quest (a trick he learned, no doubt, from Pete Jackson.)

The thing with this movie is, it seems that Boll was reigned in for most of the time, and the creative process was spread among more hands than just his.  This may be the only movie he's ever done that comes close to being good, but as they say, even a broken clock is right twice a day.  I've seen far worse movies than this.",1376438400,,2641,4.389690721649485

As I watched this DVD, wincing often and wondering how a fortune could have been thrown away to achieve such rotten results, the story and some of the characters wormed a way into my mind and heart until I found myself ignoring most of what was unraveling before my eyes and concentrating upon my own thoughts about what was really taking place and what might have been.

Given that I borrowed my copy from the public library and you may buy a used copy on Amazon.com beginning at $0.01(with postage costing not much more than a bottle of good beer), if you have half an imagination, and if you enjoy looking at those gorgeous rural areas of what-is-it New Zealand, then by all means obtain a copy of ""In The Name Of The King.""

Maybe watch it with the sound turned off, if nothing else works for you. Remember books? That's right... those rectangular little clumps of white paper printed with black ink and not usually having more than an illustration or two and perhaps a snazzy and colorful dust jacket? Remember how you could read a book and via the power of your own mind enlivening the words of the author, you could be transported to some magical or wondrous place and sometimes you wouldn't be able to put the book down until you'd finished reading every page? Remember how those words and your imagination could work together to built moving pictures in your head and remember how some of the pictures you built were even better than most of what you see today as video? Think about it!

If your imagination can do all that with a few words printed on paper, just imagine what your imagination can accomplish with this piece of eye-candy, which includes a passably good (though  for-the-most-part aborted by its director)story line! Yeah, turn the volume off while you watch ""In The Name Of The King. That's the ticket. Pay attention and daydream about what you see taking place. It probably wouldn't hurt to put on some good music in the background. It wouldn't have to be heavy metal. Use your imagination and enjoy! And by the way: were't the original movies made without any sound and if you wait long enough, doesn't everything come back into style again?",1365292800,,2498,4.614864864864865

I really don't think that video games are the best set up for making a movie.

Horrible.

Throw this against the wild casting, and there lies the greatest imbalance. Throw in bizarre visuals (cheap and silly and random), some terrible acting/scripting, and a decidedly childish sense of choreography/filmatography (was the director specifically trying to use every angle and camera trick possible and as quickly as possible and including removing cohesive flow?). And WHAT is up with the never ending imposition of the soundtrack, trying to squeeze epic out of the mundane? The film just reeks.

I was 20 minutes in when I decided to accept the film for the ""done-over-the-weekend quality"", and have what little fun is to be had by seeing such a crazy collection of actors--some bound to be favorites from other films.

Jason Statham is a farmer named Farmer who has a wife and child. A darkness falls upon the land and evil things come with it and things go bad. Oh, he finds out he's the missing heir to the kingdom. Wow, that's like never been done before. Wow!

Cheesy acting continues with lines that feel off and action scenes which are sometime laughable. If this had been intended as a ""B"" movie it would have been better.

One thing that is strangely interesting enough are the huge number of known people who showed in this mediocre film: John Rhys Davies, Ron Perlman, Ray Liotta, Leelee Sobieski, Claire Forlani and Burt Reynolds. I suspect the project had promised in the beginning or German director Uwe Bolle got them interested.

Nominated for five Razzie Awards. I'm sure there are worse films but this is at best a campy film for gamers. Otherwise, AVOID!

And,hey,Burt Reynolds;it was nice to see Burt back on the screen in a credible role.
The plot involves action man Statham as Farmer;that is his name,as he entered the village he now inhabits as an orphan after a great battle years before,and was adopted by family after family. He lives a quiet existence now with his beautiful wife and his son. However there is trouble in this seemingly peaceful land,as the kings cousin Duke Fallow(Matthew Lillard),wants to rule instead of his uncle Burt. Unbeknownst to everyone he has enlisted an evil magus in the form of Ray Liotta,who has also finagled his way into the heart of the kings daughter Muriella(Leelee Sobieski).
Ray sends his army of Krugs(a cross between an ape and an Orc)to slowly start taking over Burts kingdom by force. One day the Krugs reach the nearby village of his wife's parents,where his wife and son are staying. He sees the smoke and runs to help,along with Ron Perlman,his friend and mentor. They arrive in time to battle with the Krugs and their leader,all of whom are controlled by Liotta. However with the battle over his wife has been taken and his son killed.
The King arrives seeking volunteers for his army but Statham is bitter,asking where the Kings army was when it was needed...and walks away. Statham,Perlman and his wifes brother leave to rescue his wife. Traveling through a forest they meet up with its tree people who have no use for outsiders and ask them to leave. Meanwhile the kings daughter has fallen out of her feelings for Liotta who,rebuffed, becomes ever more angry. He poisons the food of the King and his ally Fallow. As Fallow lay begging for the antidote from Liotta,who had previously asked Liotta to speed his agenda up,Liotta asks him if he sped things for him enough,now. He gives the Duke the cure but says that now he owes his life to him. The King however is not so lucky and is slowly dying.
Battles ebb and flow and Perlman and his wife's brother get captured. The Duke now has control of 2/3 of the kings army and joins with the Krugs/Liotta to lay siege to the kingdom. Statham is brought before the King and it is found out he is the Kings real son. As he passes away the crown passes to Statham. The Duke hears the news of the deceased King,and declares himself the new king before Statham shows up and stops his show. The Duke's army re-defects back to the new King and the still outnumbered army,with the help of the forest dwellers,battles the onslaught of the evil army of Krugs.
Statham leaves the battle to join Rhys-Davies,the good magi and the kings daughter in laying siege to Liotta's castle fortress. Rhys-Davies goes ahead and battles the evil Liotta until he is fatally felled. The Kings daughter arrives just before he passes,and she receives all of his powers. Statham though is in a jam as Liotta has him on the ropes. As Liotta taunts Statham as to what kind of revenge he is after(a kings,a fathers?),Stathams wife,who was a hostage of Liotta's,comes from behind and says""you forgot a mothers revenge"",fatally wounding him. The film ends as Statham is reunited with his lady love,and peace finally reigns over the kingdom.
It is quite the involved plot and I was only able to do the highlights here,but you kind of get the feel of what it is about. Boll tries,as I mentioned,to have a film on a grand scale,and for the most part he succeeds. The look and music really add to the whole dynamic of the film. The editing could have been tighter and the plot is quite intricate and as a result he has alot of loose ends to tie up. Remember Scotty's axiom:The more complicated it gets,the easier it is to stuff up the plumbing! For instance there is a sub,sub,sub plot involving the tree people of the forest which easily could have been eliminated. That said,all the actors here,and what a stellar cast it is,do a marvelous job. Statham is proving he can act and do action as well,and I'm glad to see the direction his career has taken so far. It is funny seeing Ray Liotta in such a role,but he comes through in style. And Matthew Lillard sure had a great time in his over the top portrayal of the Duke.
Technically speaking the film is in its original w/s a/r of 1:78:1 and is clear and crisp. There are no extras.
All in all,despite bad BO returns and other reviews,I liked this film. Sure it is a bit on the long side,with quite the intricate plot,but Boll reaches for an epic feel here(much like Lord of the Rings,but no where near as good)and I think,not achieving everything he set out to do,does accomplish a good portion of it. The best things:the solid acting,the cinematography and the musical score. 3 1/2-4 stars. Recommended.",1348876800,,5358,4.695005313496281

It also has a good cast.  What could go wrong.  Answer: EVERYTHING

This has absolutely no similarity with the game except there is a town named EB.  This is a travesty and they should have been sued by the game makers.  There's nothing wrong with the beginning of the film, but after that everything is further and further downhill and it's too bad.  This cast could have done well with a good story and script.  You even have have Burt Reynolds as the King before his whole face looked like a plastic halloween mask.

3321704,1,B0012DUT3M,"An adopted kid in the village of Ehb grows up to become a man named Farmer (Jason Statham, ""Transporter""), whose wife and son leave to sell some crops. Some guys called Krugs decide this is the best time to invade and try to destroy this village, thankfully Farmer's friend Norrick (Ron Perlman, ""Hellboy"") helps him against these invaders then they go to the nearby village to get Farmer's wife (Claire Forlani, ""Meet Joe Black"") and son, but the son is killed and the wife captured by a wizard (Ray Liotta, ""Goodfellas"").

So what else would follow but a pursuit by Farmer and Norrick to get the wife and for Farmer to get his revenge for the death of his son. Sadly I have made this movie sound way, way, way more interesting than it could ever hope to be, thanks mainly to director Uwe Boll (""House of the Dead, ""BloodRayne"" & ""Alone in the Dark"") who should never, never have been allowed to make movies, theatrical or even straight to dvd releases. The amount of ineptness in film making here is astounding, I can't begin to describe how truly terrible this whole experience is.

What blows my mind even more is how this hack was able to get such an ensemble cast for this horrid movie. I mean Jason Statham, Ron Perlman, Claire Forlani, Leelee Sobieski (""Joy Ride""), John Rhys-Davies, (The ""Lord of the Rings"" Trilogy), Ray Liotta, Matthew Lillard (""Scooby-Doo"") and Burt Reynolds (""Smokey & The Bandit"") among others. What did Uwe have on all these people to sell them on this bad, bad flick?

People have called Ed Wood one of if not the worst director of all time, I would beg to differ as his films weren't really any good but you could see at least Ed cared about his work. When it comes to Uwe it's pretty obvious he has the mind of an idiotic teenager who was given a bunch of money, a camera crew and went nuts.

Its easily one of the most painful pieces of trash I've ever had to sit through, from the bad pacing, bad editing, worse dialogue, boring battle scenes to the cliches up the you know what. 1/2 out of 4 stars.",1343520000,,2036,4.450402144772118
3321705,3,B0012DUT3M,"I had never even heard of this film prior to running across it in my random ""costume drama perusal"" on Netflix, but I decided on a whim to rent it and it turned out better than I anticipated. It is obviously a B-movie with a decent budget and moderate to decent actors (with a few bad ones thrown in for good measure), but it's also a surprisingly good story with a fabulous climax. All in all, it's worth seeing if you are into the fantasy genre, but nowhere near the caliber of Tolkien or Lewis.

Many years ago, a child was found wandering in the wood and given into the keeping of the small nearby town. No one and everyone raised him. Believing that people become what they are called, he chose the name of Farmer (Jason Statham) for himself. Now a reasonably successful man of the trade, he is happily married to the beautiful Solana (Claire Forlani) and has a strapping little boy who just wants to grow up to be like his father. Sending his wife and son to town to trade and also visit her parents, Farmer continues in his toil at home, not realizing that the kingdom is being threatened by an invading army of Krugs, an animal-race pressing against their borders. They are the minions of the dark mage Gallian (Ray Liotta), who has managed to expand his magical powers in order to drain those of Muriella (Leelee Sobieski), the daughter of the official mage of the court. Having tempted her into a forbidden relationship, he seeks to overthrow her father without her knowledge, and is in league with the king's evil nephew (Matthew Lillard). The Duke has grown impatient in waiting for the throne and desires to have it now.

Standing between him and success is Muriella's father Merick (John Rhys-Davies), but not even he can halt the invasion of the Krugs... and when his son is slain in battle by one of them, Farmer must take up arms to defeat them and rescue his wife from a fate worse than death. The result is a reasonably good story that might have been better executed, but it is better than anticipated considering it is based off of a fantasy video game. I really liked the premise, the introduction of the mages, and especially Elora (Kristanna Loken), the queen of the woodland women, who sweep in on vines and save the day when they are needed. The plot is rather contrived and unoriginal but could be forgiven in the sense that for the most part, the pacing is enjoyable. However, it does tend to lag in the second half, in which we waver between Krugs on the battlefield and the magical duels of the mages in the castle. The latter is far more exciting than the former, and I actually fast-forwarded almost all the Krug battles just to get to the good stuff.

Some of the actors are very good and others are terrible. I liked Liotta's character very much, he was a decent villain and his menace toward the women around him was very strong and threatening, but somehow the actor seems to ham most of his lines. He is putting far too much work into his performance and this lessens its impact considerably. I was pleased to see Sobieski again, after her tremendous appearance as Joan of Arc, and she is very good in the role. I actually cheered when she turned up in a suit of armor. Forlani and Statham have good chemistry together, and the ending is an uplifting but bittersweet one, as not all survive the ultimate battle. The special effects are very good and some of them, such as the sequence in which the mages have a sword duel without using their hands, are especially memorable. The costuming is also quite pretty, but there were a couple of times when I was confused as to who people were. The twist midway through was obvious from the beginning. It is never a film that will compete with some of the epic fantasies of our time, but I did not regret viewing it, even if it was over-long in places. If you are a fan of the genre,  you will enjoy it. Best of all, it's appropriate for young teenagers as well.

It was probably right around the 45-minute mark, but I couldn't stand to see the baddies from Power Rangers revived to fight a bad LOTR knockoff battle with Statham.

3321707,1,B0012DUT3M,"There are only two things that you need to know about this movie.
1. It is a Uwe Boll film. Uwe Boll is universally recognized as one of the worst hacks in film history having created such great hits as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/House-of-the-Dead/dp/B0000YEE6C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">House of the Dead</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bloodrayne/dp/B000EQ5V8G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bloodrayne</a>, and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Alone-in-the-Dark/dp/B0007XBM5W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Alone in the Dark</a>. He buys the rights to recognizable games and then makes a movie which is really a generic combination of the best scenes from other movies thrown randomly together. Although his films rarely even make their money back he took advantage of a German tax loophole (since closed) which allowed you to get tax credits for your film whether it makes a profit or not.

2. The clever goblin strategy is to light themselves on fire and then catapult themselves at the enemy.

If either of those things sound attractive to you then this is a movie to check out. I love the sheer irrationality and unintentional humor of a good Boll film. This film represents his largest-scale production since the film he's choosing to rip off is the Lord of the Rings, complete with an irrelevant Helm's Deep raining fight sequence ripoff that has nothing to do with any of the main characters and doesn't affect the plot in any way. His villain is the grossly miscast Ray Liotta who has gone down a long way since Goodfellas. His every scene is comic gold since he is actually trying to overact and failing. So check out this film if that's your thing. If you only like films that have such overrated features as 'quality', 'originality' or 'plot' then check out some other film.",1326067200,,1913,5.853046594982079

3321720,2,B0012DUT3M,"An evil wizard wants to rule the Kingdom of Ehb (and perhaps all Aranna) with the half beast Krugs that he managed to control with his magic.

In this fantasy world based on the award winning game Dungeon Siege, the blood defines the destiny and capabilities of everyone, be it a mage or a ruler. Obviously I won't advance much of the story; that would be an ugly spoiler.

This is a classic tale of good against evil with underdeveloped characters considering the stars that interpret them (including Jason Statham, Burt Reynolds, Ray liotta, John Rhys-Davies, Ron Perlman, Leelee Sobieski, etc.).

Some positive considerations:

- A nice fantasy tale, if you're a fan of this genre you will not be too disapointed (although this is no Lord of the Rings, Willow or Conan the Barbarian! Don't watch this movie with high expectations and you'll get a fun evening, otherwise you will be writing some tough reviews here later on...)

- Jason Statham fighting skills - impressive. Farmer is the strong silent type character really appropriate for Statham;

- John Rhys-Davies - a very respectable wizard lord, nice interpretation;

- The magic scenes are well designed (including the wizard duel and the mage control of his minions);

- The wood dryads (wow).

Some negative considerations:

- The large battles could be infinitely better;

- The plot is extremely simple and sometimes very silly - SPOILER ALERT - so, you are the heir to the throne and the last of the lineage, great, then you go (almost) alone into the evil ultra powerful wizards lair and face him in battle...great plan - END OF SPOILER

- The script is weak.

Some weird considerations:

- Ray Liotta is THE weirdest evil Wizard in the history of cinema.

The DVD extras are quite reasonable, including the ""Making off"", behind the scenes, and additional footage. In those extras you can see that the cast really had a great time filming this movie. Three stars for the extras.",1285632000,,1945,4.816265060240964
3321721,2,B0012DUT3M,"People say Uwe Boll movies are terrible. What is truly remarkable about some of Uwe Boll movies is, however, that he somehow managed to attract decent players for his project. There are so many ""bad"" films out there - ""Plan 9 from Outer Space"" or ""Manos: The Hands of Fate,"" for example - but few of them actually have a name star like Jason Statham.

Besides the Transporter"" star, Boll's fantasy action flick ""In the Name of the King: A Dungeon Siege Tale"" stars John Rhys-Davies, Claire Forlani, Matthew Lillard, Ray Liotta, Kristanna Loken, Ron Perlman, Burt Reynolds and Leelee Sobieski. Not exactly all-star cast, but still not bad. Sadly the director's trademark inability to create a coherent narrative (out of decent actors and photography) has not changed.

""In the Name of the King: A Dungeon Siege Tale,"" inspired by a computer roll-playing game, starts with a revenge story of a father named Farmer (Jason Statham), set in a medieval Europe-like kingdom of Ehb. With his friend Norick (Ron Pearlman) and brother-in-law Bastian (Will Sanderson), Farmer sets out in search of his beloved wife Solana (Claire Forlani) kidnapped by evil creatures Krugs. I almost thought that Uwe Boll finally learned what storytelling means. I mean, almost.

Of course, I was mistaken. ""In the Name of the King"" is a typical Uwe Boll action film. It goes on and on, like your boss's long, boring speech. It jumps from one topic to another, not knowing where it should go. Marginally interesting action sequences (choreography itself is OK) are frequently interrupted by scenes from subplots. He doesn't bother to explain basic things about the fantasy world we are watching.

Still, the film is not without entertainment value if you have a taste for films which are so bad that they start to look kind of good. The film's highlights include ninja-like warriors somersaulting in the forest, and monsters or ""Krugs"" that look like humans wearing common gorilla suits. These ""monsters"" fly in the air using a catapult (and they are on fire), and there are some ridiculous dialogues and bad acting from the cast.

Miscasting seems to be a recurring Boll habit of his.  He could've gotten Malcolm McDowell, Kenneth Branagh, and Johnathan Rhys Meyers (not to confuse Rhys-DAVIES who's already in this movie) to effectively play the characters that Burt, Ray and Matthew played in; he probably tried to, but then the actors realized who will direct this movie and hightailed their bums back to Great Britain.  He keeps making these ridiculous casting choices for many of his films, and these three actors can't get into the medieval-fantasy mindset for this film.  One cannot just pick-and-mix actors just to fill in the slots, there has to be a believable balance within the ensemble (something Richard Kelly didn't understand when he made ""Southland Tales"").  ""Alone in the Dark"" even had a nicely-balanced cast: it had two C-list actors and a C-list actress playing the lead roles; they're a perfectly average selection.

""In the Name of the King"" follow the same vain revenge structure as ""Bloodrayne"".  The main character lost someone he/she cared for by some evil dude who just happened to be in the way, and he/she is off with a blade in their hand to slain their nemesis in a ridiculous stylistic fashion. The main character here is named Farmer (Jason Statham), and the nemesis is a wizard played by Ray Liotta, who didn't bother to give his character a fake accent.  Farmer meets some new people along the way, rescuing people including his wife who was captured, fighting ghoulies and eventually learned about his hidden lineage that will help conquer his foes.  The story was pretty steady for the first-half of the film, but then it went speeding down the last-half.  The mages were rarely useful outside distractions, the military army were pushed to the side for the last act for no clear reason, and the movie just ended after the bad guy was defeated.  There's a director's cut available on blu-ray that's 40 minutes longer, but not seeing that version myself, I can't say if this is the ""Kingdom of Heaven"" of director's cut or is it just Boll adding more violence and Kristina Lokke screen time.

To be honest, I don't harbor any spite for this movie, and I can't see to feel the same for Boll's last two films (""Alone in the Dark"" and ""Bloodrayne"").  What most people don't seem to notice is that Uwe Boll's improving himself since his first film.  It's not a huge improvement, in fact the improvements are very small, but at least he's making progress.  He toned down the camera crazy in ""Alone"", and he manage to make the locations look nice in ""Bloodrayne"".  ""In the Name of the King"" is certainly his least stinkiest so far.  Jason Statham isn't fit for a king, but he and Ron Perlman were fit for machismo action at certain moments.  The backgrounds were beautiful whenever they're not an apparent green-screen effect (which is most of the time), and the film does have that one creative action scene where the monster lit himself on fire and catapulted himself towards its enemies, walking towards them along the way; that's a new kind of kamikaze approach right there.

3321726,1,B0012DUT3M,This is a low budget B movie. It consisted of stupid looking alien bad guys and a very poor plot. Two friends of mine borrowed it and could only watch about a third of it.,1273449600,,171,3.914285714285714
3321727,4,B0012DUT3M,"Yeah, Boll is a horrible director. Yeah, there's a lot of LOTR ripoffs to point out. No, it's not a 1 star movie. 1 Star? really? Maybe I've just seen a lot more crappy movies than the people who gave this one star, but the whole time I was watching it I was looking for why everyone thought it was so bad. It's a low budget fantasy movie. It's got the acting and dialogue on par with Willow or Conan the Destroyer (not the Barbarian, that was a great movie) and it's got slightly better special effects than most of the other low budget fantasy flicks. Jason Stathan plays Jason Statham, in a fantasy movie, and if you want to see Jason Stathom in a fantasy movie, you will be satisfied. I personally enjoy watching Jason Statham double-flying-jump-kick people regardless of the setting, as he is the ultimate macho hero guy. This movie is cheesy, and the direction is terrible, but it's not a horrible movie. The actors are all fun to watch, and if you can find humor in the fact that the director threw Ninjas into the middle of a medieval battle scene, literally out of nowhere (they just come flying out of the trees and fight for a minute and then are never shown again)then you should be able to enjoy this movie. Anyone expecting LOTR 4 or Avatar, or the greatest movie ever made is being completely ridiculous anyway, and has no business harping on a movie that they expected to be something it was never ever meant to be. No, I don't think this is a four star movie, but it's entertaining at the least, and I felt I had to add a star to offset all the undeservingly bad reviews.",1272240000,4,1588,4.368243243243243
3321728,3,B0012DUT3M,"I've seen Uwe's other works and he must be crapping out money or has Kevin Reynolds as an investor(ala, Costner for Waterworld,Postman,etc..) because he is able to come out with not so great movies that are epically long, but has great actors in them.

Alone in the Dark? Don't get me started, that movie had nothing to do with what the franchise was about.

However, This movie actually wasn't really all that bad. Yea, the fight scenes could have gone on for an additions 80 min. or so. /sarcasm. But to be honest, it was not a bad film to just sit and watch.

And believe it or not, this script has followed the Game that it represents a lot more closely than his other movies. So I guess that is something.

Did This movie have a lot of reference to LOTR? You bet it did. But so did the story line/feel/atmosphere of the Original Game Dungeon Siege. Just a few things changed here and there.

SPOILERS(if you care)

Some of the things that stood out for me were:
Good:
-The story was cliche but, so are a lot of stories in Hollywood.

-Great location. Props were good. Great scenery and decent special effects. Much better then some of the indie films that you see. And really the directing was pretty decent for as big of a project as this was.

-The Actors did as good as they could. And the Krugs were no more ridicules then the ground creatures from the movie ""The Time Machine"".

-I liked the fact that he(Uwe) didn't try to make it one big blood bath. The kids got to see it and enjoyed it.

Not so good:
-Ray Liota? No, he's a great actor. But his ""Bad Guy"" performance was kind of stiff. I think they should have gotten Tim Curry to be the bad guy. Way better.

-Tried to cram and do WAY to much story wise. Instead of just taking some of the story and making it a movie, It seems as if they(production) looked at the script and said ""It's all good, so it must all stay!!!"" As this movie is long. And if he(Uwe)wanted it to be long. He could have made it a mini-series or had a sequel done with it instead of cramming.

-Different accents, yet related? Didn't get that..

-Yes, the Ninja thing I didn't get. At first I thought they were the women of the forest in their respective armor. But I'm not so sure. Not a lot of detail on that.

-There was just a lot going on and a lot of characters to keep track of. Farmers band that fought with him in the first war, are pretty much absent from the 2nd half of the movie. For obvious story reasons, but it felt like(or was presented as)they were going to be the posse for the whole movie....but I guess not.

-Fight scenes way too long. nuff said.

-Music...This might have been out of his hands, but there were times when it was decent. But sometimes it was way to loud and didn't fit the mood, especially during some of the many fighting scenes.

-The Ending.....what the hell? Money run out? Couldn't do a follow up to the final fight scene. ""I want to tell you, that I love you.""....Then.....credits role? huh? What happens afterward. What characters were still alive? What happened to Matt Lillard's character? I mean, surly just a quick followup/closing should have been in order. And I think, it's because of this quick no closure ending, is what cheapens the movie even more. I mean, would it kill them to add just a scene that says. ""Thank you for watching till the end of this movie, here is what happened to the characters."" type of thing. It is what they call in the movie business a ""Conclusion"".

Well, these are my opinions. Others will disagree. But, it wasn't horrible, the pay and script must have been halfway good on paper for these higher actors to be in it. In the end, it all depends on how it gets edited though. And in that respect the movie speaks for itself.

Again, not horrible. And not a bloodbath, so you can sit with your kids and watch it. The Blu-Ray looks pretty darn good though. Is it LOTR? No, but it's a movie that you can watch and not take seriously and have fun with.",1272240000,4,3968,4.32345013477089

3321730,2,B0012DUT3M,"If you're looking for a review about the movie itself, go to the standard release page; this is merely a critique on the two-disc special edition...which, I'm sorry to say, is not special enough to save the movie if you didn't like it in the first place.

The only reason you have to buy this Canadian-exclusive release is for the special features. The 165-minute director's cut promised by director Uwe Boll is available on DVD only in overseas countries and on the Blu-ray release of the movie; this edition contains the exact same cut of the movie as the regular release. The special features aren't anything worth paying extra for, so I suggest you only buy this here if you can get it cheap. On the second disc, you get 1) an 18-minute making-of featurette (not featured on the regular release), 2) 16 minutes of deleted scenes and extended footage (these are already on the regular release), 3) free digital download of the movie, 4) a downloadable demo of the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dungeon-Siege-2/dp/B0009PQCSU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dungeon Siege 2</a>&nbsp;PC game, 5) previews and trailers, and 6) an unnecessary and unexceptional photo gallery.

Unless you want the movie on your mp3 player for potentially less than demanded by online sites, the only noteworthy addition is the making-of clip, which is only moderately insightful as to how the movie was made but still good for a few laughs. It's basically Boll and the performers telling you how great the movie is going to be: Brian ""Tarish"" White claims that people were actually competing for the opportunity to work on the flick, Ray ""Gallian"" Liotta says that he couldn't relate to his character at all and therefore had to rely entirely on actual acting ability, Jason ""Farmer"" Statham proudly claims that he did his own stunts (not entirely true), and Boll reiterates that you're foolish to expect a movie adaptation to actually follow the game it's based on (but Claire ""Solana"" Forlani is confident that gamers will still like the movie because of the Krug and fighting). To his credit, Boll lauds his actors, speaks highly of action choreographer Tony Ching's contributions, and explains his reasoning behind the claustrophobically-shot battles.

I don't imagine there's too many of them, but for actual fans of the movie, this ""special"" edition is a bit of a rip-off, seeing as they'll still need to buy another version of the movie to get the full nine yards out it. Nevertheless, in a pinch, for those who haven't seen the movie at all and are open to potential disappointment, I suggest you buy this version if you can find it cheap and don't live in Europe or own a Blu-ray player, since it's still marginally more satisfying than the standard release.",1271289600,3,2788,5.08296943231441

The script is pretty bad, and the plot makes little sense. Those aren't deal-breakers for a lightweight sword and sorcery film. But, as said by several others, Burt Reynolds and Ray Liotta are horrendously mis-cast and are huge distractions. Liotta especially is so bad that i cringed with every line.

That's exactly what we did. I knew from the terrible trailer to this movie that it would be a barely held together mess from the great Uwe Boll. So when the DVD hit we rented it for the sole purpose of having a good laugh and making fun of pretty much everything about it. From Ray Liotta's dreadfully painful performance (is he out of money?) to Burt Reynolds mumbling dialogue he seems embarrassed to recite, random ninjas and Amazons (yay for Kristanna Loken) and by far my favorite: Matthew Lillard's ""I am your king!!!"" line. I'm cracking up just thinking about how awful it is lol. I think I may have tried to give it credit for the locations and set design but I really can't remember if I just made that up out of pity. At least Jason Statham seemed to try and of course has flashy fight moves. Although that could be some residual Italian Job coolness seeping into my opinion....oh well guess I'll never know! In conclusion, if you want a good laugh at some quite terrible film making then gather your like minded pals, crack open some brews and laugh away. If however you are looking for a real film experience...you shan't find it here my friend, go watch the LOTR Trilogy instead and say to yourself ""oh Gimli what were you thinking trying to class up that Dungeon Siege movie?""",1260144000,,1605,4.407407407407407
3321737,2,B0012DUT3M,"""In the Name of the King - A Dungeon Siege Tale"", director Uwe Boll's off-kilter ""Lord of the Rings"" knock-off, throws a very impressive array of acting talent into a rather low-budget fantasy, and succeeds in making them all look pretty silly. In some cases, the genre doesn't suit their film personas (Jason Statham, Ray Liotta, and Burt Reynolds); in others, poorly-written roles defeat any opportunity to shine (Leelee Sobieski, Ron Perlman, Kristanna Loken, and John Rhys-Davies); under-exposure negates a sympathetic performance from Claire Forlani, and as for Matthew Lillard...well, his simpering, whimpering comic 'supporting villain' is simply awful. Toss in copy-cat LOTR visuals, less-than-magical special effects, and Boll's heavy-handed, pedestrian direction, and you are left with a film that probably shouldn't have been made.

Trying to list positive aspects of this film is difficult, but one does stand out; nobody fights better on film than Jason Statham. Whether tossing a lethal boomerang, gracefully wielding a sword, or relying on his fists and boundless energy, Statham becomes electrifying when he goes into battle, no matter the era. His action scenes single-handedly keeps this film from rating just one star, or even lower, as it is truly that bad!

5 - I really liked/loved it
4 - I liked it
3 - Could've been better/worth a look
2 - Just didn't live up to the potential
1 - Simply awful

I think I'm being kind in giving this film 2 stars. I like Jason Statham, he has a charisma about him. But this movie was so hard to get through; I wasn't even able to pay total attention to it. Luckily the plot is so thin (like thread) that you don't really have to pay full attention to it to know what's going on. Statham is a farmer named Farmer who's trying to get back his kidnapped family from the evil forces of Ray Liota. There's also an evil nephew (Matthew Lillard) trying to take over the throan of his king (Burt Reynolds, whom I adore but his so not in the right element here). I like a lot of the cast featured here: Jason Statham, Ron Perlman, Ray Liota, John Rhys-Davies, Burt Reynolds, Matthew Lillard, and Claire Forlani. But 99% of this cast were not meant to be in a midevil and/or fantasy film. The actors do what they can with the material, but it just isn't enough. Matthew Lillard makes it fun by playing his role over the top and hammy. Frankly, everyone should've played it that way instead of a serious fantasy film. True other Statham films like The Transporter were thin in plot, but the action made up for it in my opinion. The action here just isn't all that exciting, it's more by the book than anything else. I feel this movie could've been better with a different cast and better writer. I give kudos to the production design of the film (it does look rather nice) and director Uwe Boll for being able to fund his own projects (not to meantion get big name actors). This is the first Boll film I've seen, so I have no other basis for comparison; this is just a review of the film itself and not of the director's work.",1238630400,,1814,4.227665706051873
3321741,3,B0012DUT3M,"There were two movies that came out in 2008 which probably rank among the worst in history, this one and Punisher: War Zone.

This movie sucks.  You can pretty much ignore what every character says and just insert something you know from Lord of the Rings or Willow.  You'll be close enough that it won't matter.  Better yet, just watch it in German.  It is after all the director's native language.  As for the plot, again, just make up your own details from what you've read and seen.  You can see the formula revealed without much effort.

""But you gave it three stars, dip****!!""

Yes, and here's why.  This film is a monument to bad filmmaking, a milestone that may never be surpassed.  It's a clash of opposites though because it is an incredibly expensive, slick production.  I would call it one of the most well-made bad movies ever.  So much effort and expense went into casting, action sequences, choreography and special effects that it should have been good, but Boll made it awful, so awful that I had to keep watching to see how much more awful it was going to get.  Here's a quick breakdown:

Farmer's name is Farmer and he's hero Jason Statham (possibly the only good casting choice).

Farmer's friend is Ron Perlman who for some reason isn't cast as creepy bad guy.

Creepy bad guy is Ray Liotta, which doesn't make sense because he's got in Irish blood in him so he could never be a made man (It's Ray freaking Liotta in a freaking Fantasy movie, what can you say to that!?).

The role of Gandalf will be played by Gimli, son of Gloin.

The role of Arwen/Eowyn will be played by Leelee Sobieski, who is young, pretty and maybe talented, but honestly, the fact that she is in it at all should tell you it's a bad movie.  She may consider finding a new agent.

It's a fantasy movie and Burt Reynolds is in it.  Why?  Because they could, I guess.

Burt Reynolds's toadie is Matthew Lillard, which should be another tip-off that it will be a bad movie.

So the hero decides to be a hero, fights some nondescript bad guys, rallies more people to fight nondescript bad guys, then it all comes to a head and they all fight the one descript (well, if nondescript is a word...) Ray Liotta (Ray Liotta?? Seriously??).  Lots of fighting and dialogue reminiscent of Star Wars prequel trilogy (low blow, I realize that) ensue along the way.

In two words, it's heroicly bad.  If you are a real movie buff, you HAVE to see this movie just to see how bad it is.  It's as if you're watching bad film history unfold before your eyes.  That is the only reason I give it a positive rating, because for better or for worse (mostly worse), it's worth seeing.",1238630400,16,2655,4.448132780082988

Don't count on it. I'll even give you the fact that Burt Reynolds plays the King. Good old Burt couldn't even save this one. I think the budget was spent on the cast and special effects so there was little left for a script, let alone to hire a decent director. The special effects are pretty incredible. The battle scenes are well choreographed and the music isn't half bad but then you find scenes like the one with Kristanna Loken as Elora, a vine swinging tough chick who declares that men are not welcome in her forest and has the screen presence of a stick. Ray Liotta gets the biggest laughs as he tries desperately to be the insane baddie. I just couldn't take him seriously and I am not sure he could, either. Maybe he needed the money?

3321749,1,B0012DUT3M,"Where do I start, if there was a negative commentary for this movie as you watched it, you'd see every mistake Uwe Boll made besides agreeing to this script in the first place.  I'd like to apologize to the actors who must have some sense, but like us all need to make money, even if they're selling their skills to the Hitler of directors. If I was looking through the directors eyes I would gouge them first & then ask someone else to do this that way it at least had a chance.
  First I'll comment on Ehb, the name itsself sounds ridiculous but we must press on.  Ehb is an empire kind of like Rome with the luxury of having a castle, a small village named Stonebridge, Sedgewich forest & a nameless field where the battles take place. Rome wasn't built in one day but Eb sure was.  Don't be fooled, Ehb also has diverse citizens, which is cool, ninjas (yeah... weird, feminist tree huggers & religion. The movie switches back & forth from Monotheism to Polytheism... told you it was unique.  With its winning LOTR landscape, Amazonian forest the ""empire"" of Eb is surely a creation only the insane could think of.
  My next comment is on the actors, there are so many here so who shall I start with?  Why not the lead character Jason Statham who plays Farmer?  Statham is a man who makes up his name because he believes that if you call yourself something that's what you'll be. I think its too late to call Uwe Boll a genious director don't you?  Well, anyways the other characters are Hellboy whose's Statham's dumb father like figure who aids him in his quest. Ray Liotta's the bad magus, Leelee Sobieski is the underachieving daughter who is also a magus who sells her goodies to Ray Liotta, Gimli from LOTR plays a good magus & Leelee's father, Burt Reynolds plays the King of Ehb who has alot of similarities to Marcus Ariliues from the Gladiator & there's Shaggy from Scooby Doo plays the king's evil nephew.  The acting style in this movie was the worst part. When loved one's died there was no emotion, for example when Statham's son gets hacked by a Krug & he has to bury him & still remains strong.  And when Leelee's father died, (Gimli)she just stands there with a blank stare. I did more crying than anything, I wonder why?
  When you add Ehb plus the actors you still get a really long movie that doesn't seem to end. No wonder everybody's comments are so long.  Our next topic are the missions which I will do my best to sum & give the most eye raising parts.  First, we'll begin with Statham who is a Farmer named Farmer who takes on a one man search for his wife. Throughout the movie he mentions several times that he's just a ""simple farmer"" who fights with a machete, runs on the shoulders of Krugs & uses his the skills he had in the Transporter movies.  All he needed was a sweet Audi & a black suit & in the empire of Ehb anything can happen. With the remarkable fighting skills he required from growing cabbages he also is the long lost son of Burt Reynolds, making him the heir of Ehb. When father & son share a special saying they truly realize that they are family even though Burt said that to Statham when he was only 3 years old.
  Next on the chopping block is good old Burt, who is plays the simple king of Ehb & learns that his nephew, (Shaggy) wants to kill him & take over his kingdom.  The worst part about Burt's character is when he finds out that Statham is his son, he doesn't express himself in an excited way, but in reality he is. If you still decide to watch it, you'll know why.
  Leelee's character plays the last female of the Maji race, no... they didn't have a dying race called Maji in LOTR, they had elves, big difference. Leelee is in love with Liotta who steals her powers & places them in his favor so he can overthrow the King.  After she comes into her destiny we'll call it, she rides off to join the battle & gets chased by Liotta's Krug like Arwen in LOTR.  She never fights, or does anything really, she's just dressed in armor because it looks better in battle, I guess.
  Next is Ray Liotta's character called Gallian who is the mastermind behind the Krugs & is the king of the Krugs. His Krugs whole mission is to take the people of Ehb to this dungeon, hence the name where they work constantly.  If you want to picture this dungeon think about LOTR when Saruman had the Urk Hai digging under the ground around him. When his Krugs reign terror on the good people of Ehb Liotta is also present.  He's the Krug on the horse & he watches the battle scene in a strange realm,kind of like how Frodo saw Sauron whenever he put the ring on. This way Liotta can watch but never be killed.  The worst part about Liotta's character is in the end when he fights like his 4th battle scene with Statham. He uses books to fight Statham along with the force like abilities from the Matrix movies.
  With all that being said there's still more, including poor dialogue & words taken out of different time periods & other's just thrown in for fun.  Words like melodramatic, arrogant,mindless enterprise were used randomly. I told you that anything can happen in Ehb. Along with misplaced words the movie somehow has to end & what else could help it besides a big rope?  Literally, it helped end the movie & I can see the director & his crew trying to figure it all out now. Their sitting around the script & someone, anyone shouts out, ""how about a rope,"" and the rest is history.
  Sometime between the first scene & the point of suicide the movie ends with Statham reuniting with his wife.  Will the world of Ehb be restored?  Will Farmer change his name to King so he can be a king? Will he take on his role as the leader of Ehb altoghether?  If he does it isn't in this movie & hopefully not in another one, because I don't think I'd be able to watch it. After Statham says his loving words to his wife the movie ends with Lord of the Dance music meets rock band. And so ends the terror, so ends the tale of Uwe Boll's movie.  If he dares write another let's stick that in the dungeon right next to the Krugs.",1230422400,,6065,4.318623124448367

With that said, this is truly a testament to Uwe Boll's complete lack of talent. The cast was decent, everyone on board may have been a second tier actor, but they all have numerous credits to their names. I've seen every single cast member give a decent performance in one movie or another, yet somehow they all managed to be absolutely horrible, laughably bad. It is rare to find acting this bad in a movie that was actually released to theaters.

The storyline was cliche and nothing new, but it would have been entertaining if it actually made sense. Not once did they stop to explain where the heck this kingdom was, who the heck anyone in the story was, why there were bad guys working for the king, why the hell anyone would want to love Ray Liotta, and most importantly why do we really care about anyone in this movie. There was just way too much information trying to be crammed into this movie and these random subplots just added to the confusion. Ninjas, amazon women, 5 second love affairs with old men???

Please, learn how to frame a shot and edit!!!! The people making this film simply do not know what they are doing. Every scene was either awkwardly framed or shot way too close to the actors. And the editing further worsened the situation, with random cuts at completely inappropriate times. I could honestly give a camera to a bunch of high school kids who would shoot and edit something that looked better than this.

And lastly, don't get me started on how Jason Stattham manages to stay in peasant clothes throughout the entire duration of the movie. He saves his town and heads off to save his wife, still in peasant clothes. He enlists as a soldier and fights a major battle, still in peasant clothes. He becomes a king and fights another major battle, still in peasant clothes. Seriously, what does it take to get him out of peasant clothes, you've got a bloody king fighting in rags while everyone else is wearing armor!!!!

1)  The Farmer turns out to be a top notch martial artists, wrestler, and sword fighter.  When and Where did he acquire the knowledge and skills to both learn farming and combat skills?  I mean his fighting was above par by any standard.

2)  The tree sprits are feminists tree huggers.  While they shoo away the males from their forests, they drop their high morals and ethics at the mere beck and call from a female.

3)  At the final battle, the outnumbered human army literally has the high ground on a muddy hill yet they charge down the hill ruining the biggest advantage that they've got.

4)  Ninja's!?!?

5)  So many different accents all around it's hard to believe they all come from the same region.

3321757,3,B0012DUT3M,"About thirty minutes in, my wife turned to me and asked this question:

""Who directed this and how did they get the money?""

Realizing the context of this remark, she is not a film buff and often cares very little about the art of film, who directs, who scored it and so on. Maybe she likes an actor every now and then, but it's not often. Her favourite film is Brotherhood of The Wolf.

My answer was this:

""Uwe Boll. No one seems to know where he gets any the money to make any of his movies.""

""Ewe? You got that right,"" she stated, rolling her eyes.

I think his films may qualify as 'self-published' as he may be printing up the cash needed for these projects in his basement and propelling them forward on his own coin.

Too many jokes can be made about the man's first name and the apparent writing and overall quality of his films. It almost seems like a sport or a hobby for some to denigrate and chase down Ewe Boll movies and write one-star reviews. It seems almost unanimous that if anyone should be chased away from the art of film-making it should be Uwe. Some have even said that he should make a movie with Casper Van Dien and Jan Michael Vincent if he really wanted to do something corny and awful. He might even win an Oscar if he did.

In watching this train wreck, I thought several times to turn it off, but I also began to realize just how close to the edge a lot of these films from this genre border on being awful from the casting alone -- let alone the editing. These are probably the two biggest problems with this flick.

It wasn't bad seeing Jason Statham playing a farmer, named Farmer. Why not? It's actually not that anachronistic of a thing. Someone who might've been a blacksmith back then would've been called
'Blacksmith'. No biggie. Seeing 'The Bandit' / Burt Reynolds as the King was interesting but maybe a mistake. Ray Liotta was the only real draw to this movie and preformed rather well as an evil sorcerer. But watching it progress, reminded me of an article I recently read on CNN where they stated that Peter Jackson (of Lord of The Rings fame) courted Sean Connery with 15% of the World-Wide gross from his franchise to play Gandolf. Connery turned it down, and $400 million in the process. I think those films would've been received vastly different in the scenario with Connery as Gandolf. It might have even ruined it. Connery is quite a presence, but Ian McKellen immortalized himself as Gandolf.

Nobody in this picture immortalizes themselves at all. Leelee Sobieksi proves once again that she just looks weird, acts weird and talks weird. John Rhys-Davis should lay off the Hair Club for Men and retire. Ron Perlman was sadly and drastically underused and Matthew Lillard looks as though he was picked out of the food-court at the Glendale Gallaria Mall.

But good ol' Uwe is cranking out four more flicks scheduled to be released 2009 and 2010. He's definitely here to stay.",1224979200,,2929,4.507547169811321
3321758,2,B0012DUT3M,"Ok first of all for those of you that do not know the fantasy genre this movie is not a bad copy of Lord of the Rings. That is like saying that every detective movie that have a though guy private eye in a long shapeless coat is a rip off of whatever movie in that category is most known. This movie present a very, very typical, stereotype fantasy story. It is uninventive yes but it is not plagiarizing.

And that is about as much good as can be said about this movie. There is really to much wrong with it to put a finger on anything, the lines sounds stupid, the special effects is goofy, the story line is so predictable you will know the story 15 minutes into this travesty of a movie. The characters are paper thin, the battle scenes, witch there are allot of, just drag on and on and is badly choreographed. This movie really do not have anything good with it.

The story, is the typical fantasy scenario, the evil, dimwitted relative of the old but wise king have allied himself with a evil mage to seize power, a nobody, a common farmer is dragged into this to save the damsel in distress and he just so happens to be the king's long lost son and the only one that can save the kingdom. The evil mage have an army of monsters that have to be over come yadda yadda yadda you can guess at the rest. There is not even a hint of originality in this.

If you are a huge fantasy fan like me, you might want to see this movie if for no other reason that there are such a limited number of classical fantasy, with that I mean the type of fantasy story that happens in a world that is pre industrial revolution where magic is real and so on, movies to choose from, so we are rather starved in that regard. And becouse the better such movies do, the more chance it is there will be more and better fantasy movies in the future.

This movie do not deserve the two stars I gave it. It get two stars simply becouse it belong to a niche that is sorely limited in it's selection so that it's fans will take whatever we get. If you are not a huge fan of fantasy movies however do not waste your money, then this travesty of a movie most likely will not appeal to you in the least, for trust me, it is really, really bad.",1224547200,,2214,4.106235565819861

I really like Jason Statham and he tries hard with this crap script. The dialogue was just so god awful I was left feeling I could have done better. The action scenes weren't bad, but it's not like we haven't seen it before.

Leelee was extra, the king was extra, Matthew Lillard's character...stupid. If his character was supposed to be funny I'm stil waiting for the first joke to start. He was just awful. I'm more than willing to say it was the crap script because he can normally make me chuckle. Not in this one.

Not to mention the scenes flipped from one to another and you're left wondering why.

And don't get me started on Ray Liotta. Good actor, but here it's like you're hoping he just did this because he was bored and wanted to do a crap film. Not convincing at all.

Overall this movie is crap. The more I think about the more pissed off I become that I spent even $3 to see this. I mean if you still want to watch it then wait until it comes on TV. Then make sure you have nothing else to do, are bored out of your skull and high. Then watch it. You'll still probably hate it.

3321762,2,B0012DUT3M,"I'll admit it - I'm impressed. After sitting through his previous features, I doubted that Uwe Boll was capable of making anything that even resembled a good movie, but apparently I was wrong. Through a $60 million budget, an all-star cast, and a really weird script, ""In the Name of the King"" is without a doubt the most solid picture that our favorite director has made in recent memory. But then again, being a Boll film, this means little: if judged against anything other than his own films, ""King"" looks sloppy, mediocre, and faces stiff charges of blatantly copying from Peter Jackson's ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy. Rest assured, it's a bad movie; the question simply is ""how bad?"" Care to find out? Well, get ready for a long review...

The story: in the kingdom of Ehb, the power-hungry mage Galian (Ray Liotta,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Hannibal/dp/B00003CXSP/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Hannibal</a>) has turned his power against the elderly King Konreid (Burt Reynolds,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Boogie-Nights/dp/B000PAAJZ6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Boogie Nights</a>). Aided by the king's treacherous nephew Duke Fallow (Matthew Lillard,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Scooby-Doo/dp/B002YU4QT0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Scooby-Doo</a>), Galian prepares to overthrow the kingdom. All that stands in his way are the efforts of the king's loyal magus (John Rhys-Davis, ""The Lord of the Rings"") and a simple farmer (Jason Statham,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Transporter/dp/B00008AOVL/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Transporter</a>) seeking revenge for the death of his family.

Because it needs naming, here's the rest of the cast: in addition to the aforementioned, there's Ron Perlman (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Hellboy/dp/B001AK3S4Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Hellboy</a>) as Farmer's surrogate father, Leelee Sobieski (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Joan-of-Arc/dp/B00005QCVQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Joan of Arc</a>) as the magus' daughter and Galian's lust interest, Claire Forlani (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Meet-Joe-Black/dp/0783233477/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Meet Joe Black</a>) as Farmer's wife, Brian White (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/D-O-A-Dead-or-Alive/dp/B000I0RNXY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">D.O.A. - Dead or Alive</a>) as the commander of the king's armies, and  Kristanna Loken (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Terminator-3-Rise-of-the-Machines/dp/B001TK80C0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines</a>) as the leader of a mystical tree-dwelling folk. Without a doubt, this is one of the most unique casts that have ever been assembled in a single film, and I have no doubt that even years from now, fans will still be discussing just how Boll got all of these folks together. With that said, the acting really is a mixed bag. Rhys-Davis is the best performer in the movie, opposite of Liotta, who performs as though Anthony Hopkins is still feeding him his own brain. With the exception of Brian White (who puts the most effort of anybody into his role but still kinda stinks), everyone else falls into a grey category, having highs and lows but not really standing out yet occasionally blundering into unwatchable depths of overacting.

What made this movie so surprising to me is how much Boll has managed to improve his formula. Gone are the flashbacks, the gratuitous nudity, the shock violence, and general mindlessness that perpetuated throughout his earlier attempts. What we have here is a focused story that has definite heroes, villains, and changes in tone. But while the plot is more alert than usual, it's still considerably scatterbrained: the story jumps from place to place as though it were necessary that the viewer know exactly what is going on in every other location while an otherwise isolated event is taking place. This causes not only for disorientation, but also cuts the mood of any scene in half since the event being transitioned to is usually of the completely opposite temperament (e.g. Tarish and Muriella spar harmlessly while Farmer's family comes under attack). Also, even though I enjoyed the simple labeling of good and evil in characters, their intentions were always way too obvious for my liking: you KNOW that Fallow is a bad guy from the moment he shows up on the screen. What's worse, this transparency lets the viewer know what's going to happen sometimes an hour before it does: you KNOW that Muriella will come to come to odds with Galian the moment the film opens and you see the two of them kissing as though their mouths were full of novocain.

Where technical aspects are concerned, the most notable improvement is that Boll has learned how to actually shoot a movie: the cinematography looks decent, and with the aid of choreographer Siu-Tung Ching (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/House-of-Flying-Daggers/dp/B0007Q6VXC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">House of Flying Daggers</a>), the action has never looked better. Alas, these are only superficial pluses, too: the camerawork is basic, and even if you can get over the thought of kung fu in a medieval environment, the fights are edited so erratically that it's difficult to follow the action, especially in the event of a big battle scene where there are dozens of characters on the screen. These ""epic"" battles are also a weak point: they should serve as highlights of the film, but end up only slowing everything down. Boll is completely clueless as to how to shoot a fight of such proportions, for instead of pulling the camera back to show off scale, he brings the camera in real close, marginalizing any awe that such a scene should instill and making it look oddly claustrophobic.

As an afterthought, the graphics are fairly nice: Galian's portal through which he controls the Krug is cool, as is the disapparating effect the magi use, and the final battle between Galian and Farmer is a triumph of the computer.

What bothers me the most about ""King"", however, is the very blatant ripping off of material from ""Lord of the Rings"". The list really doesn't stand in favor of any contradictory opinion: the Krug are orc wannabes, the armored riders will remind anybody of the Nazgul, the woodland people are two pointed ears away from elves, Galian's domain is Mordor by any other name, and the final battle is filmed in the dark and in the rain - just like the battle of Helm's Deep. Smaller scenes like Tarish and Muriella sparring (like Aragorn meeting Eowyn) and Muriella donning armor to fight (like Eowyn) stand as a backdrop to large plot devices like Farmer, Norick (Perlman), and Bastian (Will Sanderson: Legolas Clone) banding together a'la the Fellowship, as well as the revelation (SPOILER ALERT!) that Farmer is the king's son and heir...just like Aragorn was. Then again, Boll frequently compared his movie to ""LotR"" before it was released, so I'm not really surprised.

On one hand, we've got some definite improvement coming out of the House of Boll, yet on the other, we've got a movie that has promised to keep the director away from other big budget projects for a long time. While I like the movie more than I should, there's enough nonsense here to decree ""In the Name of the King"" a certified rotten tomato...and that's before you witness Solana's laughable crying scene, arrows that magically change direction between shots, the longest deathbed sequence ever, and the incredibly soppy and dopey dialogue (e.g. ""My girlish stupidity has damaged him!""). Essentially, Uwe Boll tried to squeeze all three of the ""Lord of the Rings"" films into a two-hour movie and didn't even do a good job of pretending that they were his own ideas. I haven't touched on whether or not the film remains true to its video game roots, but that's a moot point: Boll wasn't attempting to make an adaptation - he was trying his hand at being a director of ""epic movies"" like Peter Jackson or Ridley Scott. Time will tell whether he can surprise me again by actually redeeming himself, but at his snail's pace, I probably won't even like movies like this anymore by the time his first good one is released.",1222905600,3,8504,5.765127388535032

3321766,1,B0012DUT3M,"Once upon a time, a brilliant and talented cult director made a spectacular fantasy epic, full of love, monsters, epic battles and noble kings. It became a cinematic classic.

This is not that movie.

But that doesn't stop Uwe Boll from inflicting another ghastly video-game adaptation on the innocent viewing public, after scrabbling for high-fantasy shreds straight from the wastepaper basket of Peter Jackson. It's not quite his worst work, but it's still a horrendous, vomitous, hilariously wretched experience that inspires pain, tears of laughter, and perhaps a drinking game or two.

A farmer wittily named Farmer (Jason Statham) is living in agricultural bliss with his wife (Claire Forlani) and son. But then a bunch of krugs (low-budget orcs) attack -- kid dies, wife is kidnapped. Naturally Farmer vows bloody gruesome revenge, and teams up with his brother-in-law and neighbor (Ron Perlman, who deserves better than this) to help get said revenge.

But of course, this is no isolated incident -- the unspeakable windbag King Konreid (Burt Reynolds) and his hired wizard Merick (John Rhys-Davies) are opposing the malevolent wizard (Ray Liotta) and his vast army of faceless krugs. But naturally it falls to our humble butt-kicking Farmer to somehow defeat the evil wizard and save the day. And yes, the climax will involve killer books.

It's damning ""In the Dane of the King: A Dungeon Siege Tale"" with faint praise to say that this is among Uwe Boll's better efforts. After all, this is not only the director who showed his cinematic ability by literally pummeling his critics -- this is the director who has produced some of the dreckiest, most ghastly films ever to make it into distribution (rather than direct-to-DVD).

As a fantasy experience, ""In the Name of the King"" is dull, drab and shlocky. The settings are pretty but overcast, the ""fantasy"" moments are intensely cheesy (swinging on leafy ropes!), and the fight scenes are well-choreographed but full of wild anachronisms -- including kung-fu. Seriously. Despite a relatively big budget, ""In the Name of the King"" feels like a bunch of dudes went to a Renaissance Faire and decided to stage their own fantasy film. After a few beers.

Granted, none of that inherently marks it as an Uwe Boll film. That is reserved for random ninja that show up (you can hear Boll thinking, ""Eff Jackson! It's my fantasy movie, so I can have what I want -- and I want NINJAS!""), humble farmers who fight like Jet Li, maudlin dramatic moments, and truly ghastly dialogue. When it isn't stilted (""Those who you fight... we will help you fight them"") it's hilariously pompous (""Wisdom is our hammer"").

At the same time, Boll is shamelessly aping Jackson's ""Lord of the Rings."" No, not just the sets and makeup, although many of these are shamelessly (and less realistically) cribbed. He attempts the same sweeping cinematography and score, but inserted at random and without any kind of dramatic payoff. By the finale, we've also been assaulted by airy elfin sprites who desperately need a smackdown from Legolas' long-knives.

As for the characters, you can find them in any rotten half-baked ""high fantasy"" novel -- aging king, treacherous noble, good wizard, bad wizard, and valiant peasants. The actors appear to be painfully aware of this fact.

To make matters worse, Statham is playing the same role he's basically played in dozens of other movies -- the stone-faced man of action out to kick some butt. It feels like someone cut-and-pasted the dude from ""Transporter"" right into this movie. Reynolds creakily sleepwalks through his rotten speeches, and Liotta has apparently decided to embrace the sheer silliness and run with it. As for Kristanna Loken... well, she played Bloodrayne. Nuff zed about her acting ability.

The only cast members who manage to bring any kind of dignity to their roles are Perlman and Rhys-Davies. Rhys-Davies actually works quite well as a kindly old wizard, while Perlman brings more presence and power to the screen than Statham does.

With that in mind, turning out a ""Director's Cut"" is a little like sprucing up the label of a strychnine bottle, and making a blu-ray is like using a magnifying glass on a decaying log. So of course they're turning one out -- a 162-minute director's cut with forty five extra minutes of Boll's work. Somehow I doubt that given the horrific quality of those first 120 minutes, that those cut minutes will improve matters -- the theatrical version was already too long for its ghastly flimsy storyline.

You can guess what kind of movie ""In the Name of the King - A Dungeon Siege Tale"" will be just by its title, but it dips into new levels of ghastly cheeze that few fantasy movies have managed to. A milestone in fantasy cinema -- the worst of its kind thus far.",1220313600,37,4797,4.929368029739777

I didn't even get through it. I stopped it just before LeeLee Sobieski walked out of the castle with her armour on...

For one, the acting was HORRIBLE. And whose idea was it to cast Burt Reynolds as a king? Or who in their right mind would ever put Ray Liotta in a film? He is a terrible actor!! Jason Statham was the only reason I wanted to see this film, but even he was a major disappointment!

Also, what was with the accents?! None of the characters spoke with a constant accent, which would have established that these people were from the same land. The King had an American accent. The nephew, I believe, played by Matthew Lillard -who I very much enjoy, aside from this film- spoke with an English accent that he had a very hard time pulling off and some other guy spoke with some other foreign accent...my list goes on and on.

Everyone was pretty lousy, but Ray Liotta and Burt Reynolds take the cake. These guys didn't mesh with the movie at all and really felt tacked on because of their acting status from previous films.  Second issue has to be the very poor fight choreography throughout the entire film.  The only reason I even picked this up was because Jason Statham is the lead role and he's excellent in all his other films. The fighting in this is the worst ever, and is definitely not going to improve his career as a martial arts action star.  My last issue is with the overall story, can you say snooze fest ?

3321776,2,B0012DUT3M,"Yes, this one is really, really bad.  Uwe Boll has developed something of a garbage can reputation in recent years, and turkeys like this aren't going to get him out of the dog house with many fans.

The plot:  an evil sorcerer has raised a bestial army and is working with a traitor in the King's court to conquer the land.  But when he steps on the innocent family of a farmer named...well, Farmer...he makes an enemy more dangerous than anybody could have foreseen.  Can Farmer and some newfound allies (the King's wizard, his somewhat precocious daughter, a clan of female tree sprites) put an end to the evil uprising before all is lost?

It sounds generally Tolkien-esque, but please don't even go there.  This might have made a good movie if certain things had been handled properly, but poor writing, direction, and questionable casting doom this picture from the get-go.

Mind you, I don't uniformly hate all of Uwe Boll's pictures.  Boll has his faults, but he can also sometimes capture some very unique shots that bring a fresh perspective to movie action and suspense.  Alas, IN THE NAME OF THE KING deserves all the negative reviews it got.  There are so many things gone wrong in this movie I'm not sure where to even start.  The dialogue is often laughable, sometimes painful.  The action is usually poorly choreographed so that what should be exciting is instead simply boring.  There are a few asides concerning war and its cruelty but certainly never anything thought-provoking, just trite.  And the aforementioned cast...just look at all the great actors in this one: Jason Statham as Farmer, Ray Liotta, Leelee Sobieski, John Rhys-Davies, Ron Perlman, Kristianna Loken, Matthew Lillard, Brian J. White, Burt Reynolds...but it's all for naught.  Whether it's just the poor script or the director's inability to motivate his actors or both, the fact is most of the performances are way below par.  Statham is the star, and certainly an adept action performer, but his character is too stupid to stand a chance.  His fight scenes are way over the top, even by the standards of fantasy/action.  How does a farmer learn what amounts to medieval kung-fu out in the sticks?  He never wears armor, carries pedestrian weapons, and has no formal training in combat whatsoever--and yet he's a worldbeater.  Ray Liotta is usually a can't-miss prospect as anybody's bad guy, but he comes off as a poor caricature of himself in this one with some of the film's very worst lines.

There are a few plusses, though not many.  The set design and special effects are of good quality, so that at least everything looks nice and suitably medieval.  The music is pretty good and helps set the right tone.  Every now and then there's a neat stunt or action scene, and the magical climax is visually impressive.  That's about it.

I have seen worse movies, and I can't say I regret renting IN THE NAME OF THE KING because it's one of the film's that's so bad it's kind of fun.  The thing is, with a fairly large budget and so many talented performers involved, this should have been a really good movie.  Well, maybe...but it's not.",1212710400,2,3129,4.763940520446097

3321779,3,B0012DUT3M,"In the Name of the King: A Dungeon Siege Tale (Uwe Boll, 2007)

Why do I keep watching Uwe Boll movies? Well, in this case, it was kind of a gimme; Dungeon Siege is one of my favorite games from the last decade. I couldn't not see this, even if I was fully aware Boll was going to make a mishmash out of it. But, to my surprise, In the Name of the King, while being only loosely (at best) based on the game, doesn't suck.

Okay, let me qualify that; it doesn't suck nearly as badly as all of Uwe Boll's other videogame-themed extravaganzas. You can't compare it to, say, a Kieslowski film, but if you go in with the attitude that you can, you should be well aware that you're bound to be disappointed. It's also only very loosely based on the original game (the starting scenario will look kind of familiar, and the krug are there, of course, but man, that trip to Stonebridge was quick, and it only deviates farther from there), so if you're looking for the big battle at the end, sorry. But taken on its own merits, and compared only to Uwe Boll's other movies, this one is Oscar-quality. Of course, if you broaden your horizons a bit and compare it to, say, the back catalogue of Harry Reems, it starts to take on those Uwe Boll dimensions again, but still.

In any case, the action centers on Farmer (The Italian Job's Jason Statham), who is, of course, a farmer. His life is simple, at least until the krug invade stonebridge, led by some sort of shadow warriors. Farmer's wife and kid are in Stonebridge, of course, so Farmer, accompanied by his old friend Norick (Ron Perlman), heads off to the city to beat the stuffing out of some krug and rescue his loved ones. That doesn't go terribly well, but Farmer's fighting prowess does attract the attention of King Konried (Burt Reynolds) and the king's closest advisor, Merick (John Rhys-Davies). Much of the rest of the film consists of either Farmer fighting krug or Merick trying to wrangle Konried and Farmer into a meeting so he can drop the Big Plot Twist on them.

Now, the names I've already mentioned should have informed you that this is not your typical Uwe Boll joint, and when I add in Leelee Sobieski as Merick's daughter, Ray Liotta as a renegade mage, Claire Forlani as Farmer's wife, Matthew Lillard as the king's power-hungry wastrel nephew, and a handful of other instantly recognizable actors (even Kristianna Loken, who almost had her career destroyed with her last involvement in a Boll picture, is back), you'll start to get an idea of the big picture here. Boll does, of course, retain his knack of getting the worst performances out of his actors that he can-- it's hard to believe Ray Liotta is the same guy who was in GoodFellas, or Leelee Sobieski the same woman who played Joan of Arc-- but still, comparatively, it's not outright awful. Despite some wooden delivery, for example, Burt Reynolds' performance is head and shoulders over the of John Malkovich in Eragon in a similar role. And Statham gets a chance to do what he does best-- say few words and beat things up. John Rhys-Davies is always a pleasure, however lowbrow, to see on a screen, as is Perlman, and even Loken manages to redeeem herself somewhat (truth be told, I always did blame Boll for how awful Bloodrayne was; Loken just got caught in the crossfire).

Don't get me wrong, it's still a bad movie in almost every respect, but it's certainly the best thing Uwe Boll has ever done. I wonder if he's actually learning from the huge, unbearable mistakes he made with some of his previous movies. Could he actually be improving as a director?

3321784,1,B0012DUT3M,"Once upon a time, a brilliant and talented cult director made a spectacular fantasy epic, full of love, monsters, epic battles and noble kings. It became a cinematic classic.

This is not that movie.

But that doesn't stop Uwe Boll from inflicting another ghastly video-game adaptation on the innocent viewing public, after scrabbling for high-fantasy shreds straight from the wastepaper basket of Peter Jackson. It's not quite his worst work, but it's still a horrendous, vomitous, hilariously wretched experience that inspires pain, tears of laughter, and perhaps a drinking game or two.

A farmer wittily named Farmer (Jason Statham) is living in agricultural bliss with his wife (Claire Forlani) and son. But then a bunch of krugs (low-budget orcs) attack -- kid dies, wife is kidnapped. Naturally Farmer vows bloody gruesome revenge, and teams up with his brother-in-law and neighbor (Ron Perlman, who deserves better than this) to help get said revenge.

But of course, this is no isolated incident -- the unspeakable windbag King Konreid (Burt Reynolds) and his hired wizard Merick (John Rhys-Davies) are opposing the malevolent wizard (Ray Liotta) and his vast army of faceless krugs. But naturally it falls to our humble butt-kicking Farmer to somehow defeat the evil wizard and save the day. And yes, the climax will involve killer books.

It's damning ""In the Dane of the King: A Dungeon Siege Tale"" with faint praise to say that this is among Uwe Boll's better efforts. After all, this is not only the director who showed his cinematic ability by literally pummeling his critics -- this is the director who has produced some of the dreckiest, most ghastly films ever to make it into distribution (rather than direct-to-DVD).

As a fantasy experience, ""In the Name of the King"" is dull, drab and shlocky. The settings are pretty but overcast, the ""fantasy"" moments are intensely cheesy (swinging on leafy ropes!), and the fight scenes are well-choreographed but full of wild anachronisms -- including kung-fu. Seriously. Despite a relatively big budget, ""In the Name of the King"" feels like a bunch of dudes went to a Renaissance Faire and decided to stage their own fantasy film. After a few beers.

Granted, none of that inherently marks it as an Uwe Boll film. That is reserved for random ninja that show up (you can hear Boll thinking, ""Eff Jackson! It's my fantasy movie, so I can have what I want -- and I want NINJAS!""), humble farmers who fight like Jet Li, maudlin dramatic moments, and truly ghastly dialogue. When it isn't stilted (""Those who you fight... we will help you fight them"") it's hilariously pompous (""Wisdom is our hammer"").

At the same time, Boll is shamelessly aping Jackson's ""Lord of the Rings."" No, not just the sets and makeup, although many of these are shamelessly (and less realistically) cribbed. He attempts the same sweeping cinematography and score, but inserted at random and without any kind of dramatic payoff. By the finale, we've also been assaulted by airy elfin sprites who desperately need a smackdown from Legolas' long-knives.

As for the characters, you can find them in any rotten half-baked ""high fantasy"" novel -- aging king, treacherous noble, good wizard, bad wizard, and valiant peasants. The actors appear to be painfully aware of this fact.

To make matters worse, Statham is playing the same role he's basically played in dozens of other movies -- the stone-faced man of action out to kick some butt.

Director Uwe Boll who also gave us movies like BloodRayne seems bent on insulting viewer's sensibilities by producing fantasy movies that lack originality.

The basic premise here - Jason Statham (The Transporter) plays Farmer, a simple laborer who gets embroiled in an epic battle of good versus evil when Duke Fallow (Matthew Lillard) conspires with a magician named Gallian (Ray Liotta) to overthrow King Konreid (Burt Reynolds). There are other familiar names in the cast -Leelee Sobieski, John Rhys-Davies, Ron Perlman, Claire Forlani, Kristanna Loken, Brian J.

All in all this movie stinks and it stinks bad.  If I could find my way to the producer and slap them in the face I would.

3321794,1,B0012DUT3M,"I am a huge fan of Jason Statham (""Crank"" notwithstanding).  But 15 minutes into the plot had my sides aching from laughter at the absurity of the characters and storyline. Why any of the actors choose to become involved in this movie is a mystery.  I firmly believe that none actually READ the script prior to signing a contract.  This movie was pitifully, make that PAINFULLY, ridiculous in its attempt to combine a Lord of the Rings / Chronicles of Narnia essence and wrap it in a new package.

The characters are stilted and the plot uneven.  The entire oddity looks like it was filmed and spliced together by an epileptic with ADD.

Ray Liotta may look scary and intimidating, but his ability to ACT the part of the villian leaves much to be desired. John Rhys-Davies (shaking my head), I just want to pinch his cheeks as I would a confused grandfather.  Leelee Sobieski never has really been one with the ability to chose the correct script, but she makes a passable effort as some sort of wizard/warrioress-in-training.  Burt Reynolds - dear heavens, the gods of mockery and ridicule certainly were smiling on him during the filming of this.  Matthew Lilliard provided his usual overbearing, buffoon-like persona.  His few attempts at creating a warrior-facade definitely made me giggle.

3321796,5,B0012DUT3M,"Wow, I just watched this movie last night and logged on to post a complimentary review. I'm tempted to ask, did you people see the same movie? While I can understand and even agree with some of the criticisms posted, I can't believe the hammering this film received. Now, I'm a fantasy fan... meaning, I am used to, and don't object to, fantasy. I go looking for it and it's here in this movie. I thought this movie scored well in many ways. Sure, it's over-the-top... it's fantasy! I want evil wizards, unarmored heroes, total evil vs. total good, all the things that don't exist except in fantasy. Here are a few of the things I liked about this movie:
1) Jason Statham... normally one of my least favorite actors, more watchable than usual in this heroic role.
2) Burt Reynolds... fun to see him again and his king wasn't so bad.
3) Ray Liotta... over-the-top, just as an evil wizard should be.
4) Claire Forlani, more beautiful than ever, does an great job as the brave wife and mother... worth destroying a kingdom for, anyday.
5) Leelee Sobieski... an excellent job, would have liked to see her part even bigger but it seems we have a deeply cut version here in the states. I'll be looking for the uncut version.
6) John Rhys-Davies... does his usual fine job, considering what he has to work with.
7) Not to go too long, many of the supporting performances were worthy and well done. I had no trouble watching this movie and found many touches that lent it a unique personality. The reviewers that panned it were unfair, IMO, and many of the criticisms of the director were unfounded. This movie was not boring. Of course, it was predictable, it's fantasy! We do want a happy ending, no? I liked the fast pacing, the skipping from scene to scene, the occasional humor, the special effects, and overall, the entire movie. A good job by all!

With that said, there's no need whatsoever to provide a synopsis of the '08 film `In the Name of the King', just change a few key names and you have all you need to know. Substitute Jason Statham (Farmer) for Viggo Mortensen (Strider), John Rys-Davies (Merick) for Ian McKellen (Gandalf) and an army of Krugs instead of Orcs and you're good to go. Just don't be too disappointed about the absence of hobbits.

3321798,2,B0012DUT3M,"First thing first, do not buy this movie, second rent it only if you were remotely involved with the game or was a fan.  Otherwise prepare to watch a cheap rip-off of Lords of the Rings.

The movie started very nicely. At first, I thought Uwe made it this time because the setting was great, the scenery and the characters were flawless, you can almost feel the fresh breeze.  When the Krug attacked I didn't mind the ridiculous costume the stuntmen were wearing, they were only footsoldiers, they do the same thing in every movie.  Thanks to Mr. Statham, we enjoy the farmers struggle to save his family.  Right after the scene where farmer meets the king, everything goes wrong.

I played game, I wasn't a huge fan but it was a nice game.  Movie did start good, very much like the game.  The story, although not very original, seemed like a good one but awful screenwriting and terrible directing ruined the experience.  Scene after scene the movie looked more disjointed.  For example, right in the middle of a conversation, bam,  the scene changes and now you are in the middle of another conversation, bam, then another totaly unrelated scene comes up. The movie goes on like this till the end.

I don't know how on earth Uwe managed to cast so many great names in this movie but I must say it was a great loss of talent.  I hope someone else does another Tale of Dungeon Siege, because it's worth it.  We want magical weapons and more creatures.  Oh, and please NO UWE!

3321799,2,B0012DUT3M,"Based on a popular video game, ""In the Name of the King: A Dungeon Siege Tale"" is merely the latest in a long line of sword-and-sorcery epics set in an enchanted Medieval world populated by evil wizards, a race of mutant warriors (here called the Krug) and characters with names like Gallian, Norrick and Bastian.  It also features a reluctant warrior hero by the name of Farmer (Jason Statham) who is forced to give up his pacifist ways after the dastardly Krug - and the sorcerer who telepathically controls them - kill his son and kidnap his wife.

""In the Name of the King"" may seem novel and exciting to anyone who hasn't already immersed himself in the glories of the ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy, but for the rest of us, the film is little more than an awkward mix of sentimentality and low comedy, punctuated by endless uber-violent battle sequences.  Moreover, the acting styles range wildly in caliber and tone.  Ray Liotta and Matthew Lillard are all flamboyant mannerisms and hambone line-readings as the evil sorcerer and the king's callow nephew, respectively, while Statham treats the whole thing with a gravity and seriousness worthy of a ""Becket.""  Similarly, as the magus to the king, John Rhys-Davies delivers his lines as if he were giving a command performance in a Royal Shakespeare Company production of ""Hamlet.""  At least Burt Reynolds, who exercises some restraint in his performance, avoids unduly embarrassing himself as the king.

There's no denying that the look of the film is often jaw-dropping and spectacular, filled with mist-shrouded landscapes and vistas of computer-generated armies stretching as far as the eye can see, but that is just about the only compliment one can pay to the movie.",1208908800,,1726,4.931034482758621

3321803,2,B0012DUT3M,"I'll start right out by saying that, though I've done my fair share of IMDB research, I've never actually sat through a complete showing of a Uwe Boll movie before. Of course, Dungeon Siege being the only game I've ever played that has been given the dubious honor of Herr-Boll's treatment, I had to give this bloated flick the once over. Join me on my own ""epic"" quest to understand exactly what happened to the last few hours of my life.

==SOURCE MATERIAL==
Dungeon Siege is practically a beat-em-up game that masquerades as an RPG. (For definitions on these acronyms, look elsewhere.) The game is undeniably fun in the same vein that Diablo was fun because you killed evil monsters and got better loot to kill more evil monsters. The game featured vast, colorful landscapes, interesting creatures, and (watch out!) some very unique DUNGEONS to explore with your character and his/her motley crew of NPC helpers. The basic story of the game was that the Kingdom of Ehb is under (watch out!) SIEGE by Orc-like Krug for some unknown reason and you, a simple farmer, are caught up in the fight when the ravenous hordes kill/kidnap your family.

==THE CAST==
As you can infer from the paragraph above, this game is not something that comes pre-loaded with all the character backstory, history, and setting needed to conduct a swords-and-sorcery epic. Still, Uwe Boll has managed to create a Kingdom of sorts that in some ways hearkens back to the original look and feel of the Dungeon Siege game. The opening town of Stonebridge, for instance, kind of reminds me of the actual opening village from the computer game. Unfortunately the opening sequences feature Ray Liotta groping Leelee Sobieski against cuts of CGI castle exteriors with lighting and lens flares stolen directly from Minas Tirith composites.

But I digress ...

The story in this movie follows the basic plot of the game. Our main character is a stoic farmer named Farmer played by Jason Statham. He goes by the name Farmer because he is a farmer. There is a fleeting reference made to the fact that he believes men ""become what they do ..."" or something like that. Thankfully it seems the Farmer is the only man in the Kingdom of Ehb that follows this rationale. (It would really suck to have a legion of 1000 soldiers all named Soldier.) The Farmer lives with his wife Solanna (Played by the fawnish Claire Forlani) and their son whose name is of no consequence.

His neighbor is a talkative, boorish old man played by Ron Perlman. His character is named Norick and he has known Farmer for a very long time. Apparently Norick had ""adopted"" Farmer when he was just a boy. Norick talks about wanting to enlist in the King's army because he finds the simple joys of tending the crops somewhat boring.

Speaking of the King, he's played by Burt ""The Bandit"" Reynolds who apparently thinks he's in simultaneously a western or a daytime soap opera. The King is served by Merick, his court Magus played by John Rhys-Davies who adds some much needed style to this picture. (There are also an assortment of useless guards and generals that add nothing to the overall movie.)

Opposing the good people of Ehb are the evil sorcerer Gallian, played by Ray Liotta, who, under any other circumstance probably could have made this role work. I get the feeling he walked onto the set and told Uwe Boll he was going to play a sexually frustrated frat boy with magical, swirling cloud powers and the director said ""Action!""  Gallian commands the vicious Krug in his bid to take over the Kingdom and employs the King's zany nephew Fallow in his scheme. Fallow is played by Matthew Lillard who acts drunk all the time and probably was. Out of all the cast members, he seems to have the most fun. Merick's daughter (played by Leelee Sobieski) also shows up sometimes.

Here in this list of actors and actresses lies the fundamental question: How did Uwe Boll enlist so many talented people to work on his project? It's common knowledge that his movies are all ... questionable. People like Statham, Rhys-Davies, Perlman, and even Burt Reynolds can't be that hard up for cash. I know there are contracts to fill, but still! My personal assumption is that these people simply wanted the experience of working with Uwe Boll just to see what it was really like. So many of them are stone-faced and uninterested in what's going on that it actually sort of engages the audience in a macabre way. The suspension of reality in this movie becomes the suspension of your OWN reality. You actually begin to believe you're on the set with these actors, suffering through it alongside them.

For all it's worth, Jason Statham sticks to his guns and delivers a fairly good performance in a role that demands no more from him than a few good sword fights. Ron Perlman generally looks like he's only slightly amused by his surroundings. Burt Reynolds and Ray Liotta are both hilariously out of place making their performances even more grotesquely enjoyable. About the only thing that fits is John Rhys-Davies as the kindly Magus who sometimes has a useful thing to add to a conversation, albeit through poorly written dialogs.

==THE MOVIE==
This is a film that begs, borrows, cheats, and steals from every other great fantasy epic up to and including the Lord of the Rings. From this series it gleans camera shots, atmospheric lighting, production designs, and generally mimicks everything that made LOTR good, or at least memorable. The fight scenes against the Krug  are going to immediately call forth memories the Fellowship's battles and of Helm's Deep. King Konried's castle halls seem to be designed by the dwarves of Moria.

Speaking of dwarves ...

In the Dungeon Siege game there were dwarven mines to explore along with your standard crypts and dungeons. There were also goblin hideouts with ingenious ""steampunk"" inventions like clockwork centurions and magic-powered flamethrower crossbows! Boll nixes all of these quirks and eccentricities for a world that basically resembles medieval Wales with the addition of forest nymphs. I hasten to mention that there is only one true dungeon setting in the whole of this ""Dungeon Siege Tale"" and it serves as little more than a place for Gallian to threaten the impish Duke Fallow.

Back on topic ...

The movie suffers from several mishaps covering the fields of writing, editing, and general direction. I've included my top ten favorite examples from a list I kept throughout my showing of this movie.

1. Ron Perlman is a very large man best suited for heavy melee combat who is given a pick-axe to fight with along with a bow and arrow setup.

1.5. The main character is a farmer named Farmer.

2. There is a confrontation between Merick and Norick early in the movie where the former purposely gets in the latter's way and moves to question him. There is a buildup of suspense that should lead to a scuffle or at least a shouting match between these two men but leads to ... nothing. The scene cuts to Farmer looking pissed off by himself.

3. Most battle scenes suffer from disorienting jump cuts. I anticipate an argument that this ""technique"" creates a real sense of chaos and confusion when in actuality it just makes people dizzy.

4. Norick and Bastian (Will Sanderson's useless character) fall off a crude rope bridge toward a river below them. There is a cut to Farmer running down a hill to help them and then a cut back to the aforementioned pair IN the river. Where's the splash?

5. King Konried speaks to the survivors of Stonebridge after the Krug attack at the beginning of the movie and asks for volunteers to join the army and help them fight back. Farmer tongue-lashes the King by saying the King's armies should have protected his family when the Krug attacked, but were instead guarding the castle. The problem is pretty much left at that and not addressed afterward.

6. The movie's first main army-on-army clash takes place in a heavily wooded forest with horrible visibility and overall fighting conditions which is bordered by ... a large open field.

7. There are numerous references to God as well as ""gods.""
- Early on Farmer says ""People say God watches over the innocent.""
- At the beginning of the movie Merick witnesses the buildup of Gallian's army and says, ""May the gods save us.""
-Later on Merick quips the classic ""God save the king!""
In short, the movie is inconsistent and all over the ballpark with which culture it's trying to emulate / poke fun at.

8. At one point there are Ninjas.

9. Fencing with broadswords.

10. Several sections of Manos-grade dialog mar the otherwise sturdy performances of Davies and even Matthew Lillard. Shameless theft of fantasy conventions overall.

There are frequent moral quips made by characters including one-liners about virtue, liberty, darkness, honor, vengeance, and seaweed. Unfortunately none if it is cohesive and there are no volumes of written fiction to fall back on for explanation. There is very little backstory given and as far as we know the Kingdom of Ehb comprises about 1000 people. Establishing shots of large cities and surrounding villages might help that slight little nag.

At the end of the movie I made an astonishing discovery: Uwe Boll killed almost every big name actor he had in the movie. Ron Perlman died fairly early in the second act. Burt Reynolds died in battle. John Rhys-Davies died fairly close to the end of the film. Ray Liotta died at the very end. I think it might actually have been his intention to anger audiences at killing off these characters. It's a gigantic ego trip to be able to say, ""I killed (all of the above) in my movie!"" It's also exceptionally cheap.

On the movie as a whole I can only say this: There is a plot, setting, and characters. The pacing could be better and the writing borders on inept, but at least it follows your general movie-making formula so I guess that's something. Hiring a competent editor (or possibly shooting more coverage) might have vastly improved this hastily chopped buffet of sap.

==EXTRAS==
The ""behind the scenes"" featurette is basically four separate clips filmed on a camcorder of actors standing around reading the script or hanging on wires in the middle of doing ""stunts."" There are a few shots of Uwe ""The Man, The Myth, The Legend"" Boll strutting around pretending to direct, but other than that it's a sorry excuse for a special feature. I was really hoping for a commentary track.

There are supposedly extended and deleted scenes also available, but I couldn't bring myself to watch them.

==THE FINAL WORD==
I can't say I could do better, because I don't know the first thing about shooting, directing, editing, or producing a movie. I'm tempted to believe that this romp is the result of one man's obsessive nature. I have no doubt Uwe Boll truly loves movies and what he does. The problem is some people really like doing what they do, but they're still not good at it. It's like the old joke: What do you call a guy who graduates last in his class in medical school?

Doctor.

Still, this movie could be stripped down and rebuilt as a B-grade fantasy slash fest by a graduate film school student and fare better on the critic's scoreboard than any Hollywood-budgeted Uwe Boll kindergarten nightmare project ever would. Boll is on record saying that he is the only ""true genius"" making movies these days. One can only speculate if he's joking or if escalating commitment in his argument against his myriad of critics has seriously made him that delusional. He may also simply operate on a higher plane of existence than the rest of the world.

If Boll were smarter he would stop trying to market his video game knock-offs as true cinema and start selling them as ""Bad Uwe Boll Movies"" for their sheer, pathetic entertainment value. Charging $20 for this DVD, even at Wal-Mart is a criminal enterprise. There is about $6 worth of entertainment in this box and at least a week's worth of use using the DVD as a coaster for your beer while you watch a real film.",1208822400,,12037,4.75911708253359
3321804,3,B0012DUT3M,"Bravo Amanda, you sum up pretty much my own thoughts with a twist of humour. Mind you I gave it a higher score because I guess I enjoyed the movie a little bit more, although I was expecting more with such an impressive cast. Even though I was starting to be very disappointed in Jason Statham's movie roles lately, I truthfully loved him in this one.

I agree that the Ninja dudes do not fit well in this type of movie, and quite frankly, I don't really know why they were even there.

There were other flaws, but in conclusion, I believe it was entertaining and a slightly below-average fantasy movie.",1208736000,,603,4.423423423423423

The screen play was laughable, it sounded like lines my six year would make up.

3321806,3,B0012DUT3M,"I really enjoy the fantasy genre, both in literature, games and movies.  This movie, however, hardly justifies what theaters would charge to see it.  I'm not going to beat a dead horse, but wait for this one to show up on TV.  There won't be anything to cut out, and you'll have some much-needed commercial time to get away for a couple minutes.

In fact, this movie should probably have gone straight-to-SciFi, so Joel McHale could use it for material on The Soup.

I gave it three stars because though it was no LoTR epic, it wasn't the complete trash others have described it as.  You just have to set your expectations before watching it.  Then manage your expectations and resist the temptation to fast forward just to get through it faster.

This is not as bad as ""Blood Rayne"". Which does not say much but....

3321812,2,B0012DUT3M,"The master of error himself, director Uwe Boll strikes again with another video game adaptation, this time around taking on the popular PC series Dungeon Siege with In the Name of the King: A Dungeon Siege Tale.  Jason Statham stars as a farmer named Farmer (seriously) who takes the fight to the evil Gallian (Ray Liotta) after his wife (Claire Forlani) and child are kidnapped.  Along the way are some pretty bad and monotonous action sequences, as well as a surprisingly decent sounding cast that includes Burt Reynolds, Ron ""Hellboy"" Perlman, John Rhys-Davies, Leelee Sobieski, Kristanna Loken, and Matthew Lillard.  What is even more surprising is that In the Name of the King isn't the terrible waste of film that we've come to expect from Uwe Boll, and is by far his best effort yet.  That really isn't saying a whole lot in the long run, but the fact that the film as a whole isn't laughably bad (although there are a good amount of laughable moments, particularly with an overacting and uninterested performance by Liotta) is a nice bonus in itself.  Statham is actually good as the vengeance seeking Farmer, with his rugged and magnetic personality being the main highlight.  All in all, In the Name of the King: A Dungeon Siege Tale is not the ungodly terrible flick from Uwe Boll that you may be expecting, which in itself is a small miracle.",1207785600,14,1354,4.740425531914894

The script jumps all over, the film making is bad (the colors change totally from one shot to the next, some shots are grainy or fuzzy like shot with a home video camera), the bad guy in the movie is not believable because he looks like Wayne Newton.

3321814,1,B0012DUT3M,"I was initially unfamiliar with Uwe Boll and his 'work', so I half expected a mildly entertaining LoTR rip-off(though I am not a particular fan of those movies either).  That being said, from the first 5 minutes this movie goes from bad to worse.  My friends and I laughed when we saw how horrible the Krugs looked(sort of like a walking mudpile).  We laughed when the farmer (cleverly named Farmer) began to kill them by the dozens with his oddly out of place swordsmanship.  By the third scene we could barely contain ourselves, and the whole affair began to look like an episode of Mystery Science Theatre 3000.

The whole movie reeks of poorly thought out, badly directed, and haphazardly constructed middle school drama class nightmare.  The dialog is so atrocious that the 'saddest' scenes has us all crying...with laughter!  Of particular note is the performance of Matthew Lillard, as the snarky, feminine nephew of the king.  His frequent cowardly remarks and child-like temper tantrums almost qualify this movie as a comedy.

Aside from his and the other actor's lousy dialog, the movie is further dragged down by the lack of continuity in the plot.  It seems that Uwe Boll might have ADHD as the storyline constantly cuts from one set of characters to another in such a rapid fashion that makes you strain to stay focused on what the heck is going on.  This might all be okay, since an action movie can always compensate with good graphics and compelling fight scenes.  In the Name of The King has neither of these.  The fights are so random and strangely put together, that we started wondering if all of the extras had even auditioned for the same movie.  Repetitive sequences, Krugs lighting themselves on fire, and of course the army of ninjas all contribute to battles that seem to be pulled directly from the mind of an 11 year old boy daydreaming in school.

Although I love a good B-Movie to poke fun at, making one that is 2 1/2 hours long is just cruel (unfortunately, the DVD release is suppose to be about 1 hour longer).  I can't recommend buying this movie (as you will probably return it when the dying king begins to talk of seaweed), but if you feel like watching a silly, cheesy movie I highly recommend renting this one.",1207440000,2,2250,4.6725888324873095

3321816,1,B0012DUT3M,"Now you would have to a true optimist to think a Uwe Boll movie based on a video game would be worth watching. And if you were said optimist you would have been sadly let down after watching this sad excuse for a movie. If you manage to sit through the entire movie you are one tough hombre, or blind. Ten minutes in and I was ready to poke my eyes out with my soda straw.

There are some good actors signed up for this movie, which might throw some people. But you can be certain minutes into it that they are just there for a paycheck. The story is cliche and boring, and being it is based on the video game Dungeon Siege that is not surprising. While it might be adequate for a video game based on killing things and taking their treasure to have a barely there story, it doesn't work on the big screen.

If you haven't seen the movie you are a better person for it and it is my solemn responsibility to warn you not to pay actual money for this DVD, or even play money. If you are certain that you want to see it just wait until it finds its way into the 99 cent bin at the local super store. But don't say I didn't warn you.",1203897600,18,1129,3.9911504424778763
3321817,2,B0012DUT3M,"This movie is so unbelievably bad that I have to break it down into parts for this review.

Overview:

Based on a video game, it comes over as The Lord of the Rings lite, complete with Orc-like Krugs, John Rhys Davies, and a guy with a Legolas hairstyle.  Bad guy Gallian (Ray Liotta) swirls around in clouds of smoke, and does his business through the eyes, ears and lips of really big Krugs who ride horses.

The only redeeming parts are the fight scenes with Statham, and even the battle scenes get monotonous after a while.  And speaking of the battle scenes, we get the infantry and the archers and so on, but why do we have ninjas and Amazonian tree women in the mix-up? (Mind you, Kristanna Loken of the L-Word looks really good wrapped in leaves)

Leelee Sobieski is underutilized as the daughter of Rhys Davies character Merick, but comes into her own at the end, while Matthew Lillard does his Scooby Doo thing mainly for comic relief.

Short Attention Span Summary (SASS)

7. No man is an island
8. Farmer signs up, but has problems with the armor, which doesn't suit his image
9. Battle scenes
10. Change of leadership occurs
11. Grand finale with bad guy proves that books have power
12. Women totally rock

Characters:

Jason Statham's role

There once was a farmer named Farmer
Who was rugged, but really no charmer
When the Krugs came for battle
He killed them like cattle
Without ever wearing his armor

Ray Liotta's role

There once was a power drunk mage
Who totally failed to engage
He is so badly cast
It will leave you aghast
 As he stinks up his time on the stage

John Rhys Davies' role

Though this ain't The Lord of the Rings
We're glad for the class that he brings
And though he's on his own
There's a Legolas clone
To help the return of the kings

Burt Reynolds' role

We're more than a little bit hurt
To see what's become of old Burt
More tired than mean
He's a creaky machine
Out of gas, and now fully inert

Conclusion:

This movie's no more than a joke
Filled with nothing but mirrors and smoke
With ninjas and magic
The plotline is tragic
And it's NOT Uwe Boll's master stroke.

3321818,1,B0012DUT3M,"All I really want to know is, who keeps letting Uwe Boll make movies?  I watched Bloodrayne, and he made that seem like Hamlet compared to this latest stinker.

I would say just avoid anything that ever has this director attached to it.  Somehow he managed to get a few big name actors involved with this one so that more unsuspecting people would be tricked into watching it.",1202169600,2,376,4.5
3321819,3,B0012DUT3M,"It's not bad if you think you're watching a PG-13 movie. That means the fighting scenes can't be bloody and exciting as a real action movie. Yes, it copies quite a few things from Lord of the Ring. For example, The mud-people -- aka the Krug -- look very much like the Orcs. The female-tree characters are obviously imitation of the tree charactes in Lord of the Ring.

However, the magic fighting scene between Ray Liotta and John Rhys-Davis looks original to me.

In the NAME of FUN, this film is worth watching once.",1201305600,3,519,4.51063829787234

8245447,3,B0012DUT3M,"I had heard quite a bit about this movie before seeing it on home video, most of it bad. The film's director Uwe Boll has achieved cult-like status in Hollywood for his horrible editing skills. After having seen many of his other movies I would say that reputation is well-deserved. However, In the Name of the King happens to be an exception to his usual, forgettable movies, IMHO.

First of all, unlike most of his films, this one actually had a real budget of over $60 million. That's no chump change, even in Hollywood. It was enough money to have bought the services of several excellent actors, some not-so-horrible CGI effects and a screenplay that at least sounded as if the writer was a native speaker of the English language. Granted, some of the lines in the movie are pretty stupid, but they at least make some kind of grammatical sense, which is not usually the case in most of Boll's movies.

The movie plot is based upon a video game, which seems to be the case with many of Uwe Boll's movies. Personally, I don't really like video games, especially ones based on a flakey sci-fi premise. So, getting me to enjoy this film was an uphill battle to begin with. I can't say as the screenplay was that good. On the other hand, the casting was absolutely ridiculous. I can definitely buy Statham in the main role, which he does a pretty good job with. Burt Reynolds as the king was just a stupid idea though as was Liotta's role. Most of the cast did a pretty good job with what they had to work with though.

 I honestly did not find the direction in this film all that bad. There were definitely a lot of corners cut in the editing process, but nothing to be a deal breaker insofar as its entertainment value. At least Boll's direction is somewhat original, unlike most of the crappy commercial films that land on home video these days. The effects are quite a bit over-the-top at times, but what can you expect when you are watching a fantasy film with mythical creatures, magic and mystical powers? I've seen a hell of a lot worse in the Sharnado franchise, and I still enjoy those films.

At worst, this is a pretty harmless but at least watchable 90 minute fantasy flick. At best, well, it is one of Uwe Boll's least worst movies. If Boll had released this with no credit attributed to himself and no one knew who the director was, this film would never receive the horrible reviews that you will see of this movie on IMDB. I think that a lot of the bad reviews are just trolling Uwe Boll because he is one of the most hated directors in Hollywood. Honestly, this movie is not horrible and is just entertaining enough to sit through.",1524960000,,2649,4.453608247422681
