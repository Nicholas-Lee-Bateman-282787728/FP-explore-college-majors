8116347,2,B000F1IO5M,"Although I like the stories, the audio on it was horrible.  Seasons 1 & 2 were great, but seasons 3-10 sounded very bad.  While the characters were talking, there was loud music in the backround.  It's hard to tell what they're saying.  I had to turn up the volume, but after awhile the music just gets annoying.  I love Chespirito and this DVD would have been great if it wasn't for that.  That's why I don't recommend this DVD.  Just get Seasons 1 & 2.",1263427200,,454,4.270588235294118
