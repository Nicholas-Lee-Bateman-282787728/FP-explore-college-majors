166018,5,0800129016,"The Whole Town's Talking is a delightfully sassy comedy directed by John Ford - yes, John Ford! Mild-mannered accountant Arthur Ferguson Jones has the misfortune to possess the exact same visage as vicious bank robber, Killer Mannion. After being mistaken for the criminal, the DA gives Arthur a letter of identification so he can avoid similar trouble. His boss convinces Jones to begin ghost-writing the ""autobiography"" of Mannion, and his coworker, Wilhelmina Clark, acts as his agent to assure he gets paid for his efforts. The articles make Jones a local celebrity, but also brings him to the attention of the bank robber, who decides to take advantage of his look-alike. Naturally the mistaken identities cause much confusion, not only among the police, but also with reporters, friends and relatives, and even among Mannion's gang. This film affords Robinson the rare opportunity to not only play comedy, but to parody his gangster stereotype. Although he excels throughout with both characterizations, my favorite bit is when the drunken Jones finally makes a pass at his secret crush, Wilhelmina, behavior which finally gets her to see him in a whole new light. Arthur charms as the spunky heroine, and she shares a perfect sense of comedic timing with Robinson. They sparkle, shine, and sizzle! As for the superb supporting cast, watch out for Donald Meek and Etienne Girardot who very nearly steal the film as the ditzy dingbats. The entire film is taut and springy, bouncing all over the place like a tiny, high powered Super Ball. Zing! Zang! Zoom! John Ford is an amazing director, possibly the best of Old Hollywood, and this delightful comedy gets lost in the plethora of wonderful films he made. But give this film a chance, and you just may find yourself, as I did, wishing both Ford and Robinson had dabbled more frequently in the comedy genre.",1329350400,5,1863,4.9743589743589745
166019,5,0800129016,"Here Robinson plays the role of a mild-mannered bookkeeper, that of a body double in the person of a murderous gangster on the run - Killer Mannion, and he also effectively plays two other roles - that of the bookkeeper pretending to be the gangster, and the gangster pretending to be the bookkeeper. This could get very confusing, especially in the case of the latter two roles, but as the viewer you will be pretty sure you know who you're looking at by the circumstances. However, you'll still be bowled over by the subtlety of Robinson's performance - I know I was.

Jean Arthur plays Jones' (Robinson's) would-be girlfriend. She works in the same place as Jones, but longs for more than a hum-drum existence. When Jones tells her his hopes and dreams of being a writer and traveling to exotic places, she encourages him, and seems to see what he could be even if Jones doesn't quite see it yet. Arthur has what amounts to one of the funniest scenes in the movie, and there are many candidates. When the police first pick up and arrest Jones, believing him to be Mannion, they pick up Arthur too, thinking that she is his ""gun moll"". She has some fun with this and starts using gangster slang and mannerisms and confessing that Mannion committed every crime that the police ask her about.

One of my favorite supporting players of the 30's shows up here too - Ed Brophy, who was an assistant director over at MGM until Buster Keaton put him into a small but important role in ""The Cameraman"" in 1928. Once sound came in Brophy was perfect for playing supporting Runyonesque parts. Here Brophy plays an associate of Killer Mannion who is picked up by the police and makes a deal, promising to put the finger on Mannion. In return the police have to keep him safe in jail until Mannion is picked up. Brophy's character is brave whenever he thinks Manion has been captured and a blubbering coward whenever he realizes Mannion is still free.

Highly recommended as a great screwball comedy that shows the versatility of not only Edward G. Robinson, but of director John Ford.",1269648000,3,2075,4.617886178861789
166020,4,0800129016,"I saw this in a revival/fundraiser for the Jersey City Lowes, and I have to say it was fun.  Actually, Edward G. Robinson plays two roles, and the tough gangster plays second fiddle to the mild mannered clerk he plays.  And I also think the sets or building used for his office may have been used later on in the film ""Double Indemnity"", which he also played a large part in.",1152835200,4,375,4.267605633802817
166021,4,0800129016,"There was a time when Edward G. Robinson was one of the most imitated personalities of the cinema.  His ""nyah, nyah, nyah"",(his way of saying ""I'm not listening to you"", acting very sure of himself and behaving quite devilish, being quite the peer of James Cagney and Humphrey Bogart.  Most people who know John Ford's work as the man most responsible of making John Wayne a superstar, directing Henry Fonda in some masterpieces and being quite the dramatic director.  Here, though, he handles a script by Jo Swerling and Robert Riskin and practically plays it with just as much humor as Frank Capra or Howard Hawks.  Robinson is given two parts: that a mild bank clerk who is mistaken as the public enemy, no good killer, also played by Robinson.  There's absolutely no sublety in the way he's rousted, with multiple guns pointed at him, that would be enough to spook anybody.  I believe this is one of Jean Arthur's first co-starring roles and she's just great.  Wallace Ford and Donald Meek add their comedic talents to this.  My only real disappointment and I've read the scene where bad Robinson captures the love ones of the good Robinson didn't pass the 30's censors is still missing.  This omission causes the ending to get wrapped up rather too quickly.  Otherwise, if you're a fan of the thirties, Robinson or Ford, I really think you'd enjoyed this one.",991612800,20,1364,4.741525423728813

166068,5,0800129016,"Edward G. Robinson was a very good actor, that went unnoticed by me until I viewed this movie. His sense of timing and degree of becoming the character, is a work of dedication and method. More than a mere studio extra, he went the extra mile to insinuate emotion and feeling into the part he plays, and convinces the audience that he is the bumbling, backwards, introverted, and shy clerk, but also, the ruthless gangster who is his exact double. The fact that the film  is a comedy, makes it that much more remarkable.",1428019200,3,520,4.531914893617022
166069,4,0800129016,The movie was entertaining enough. If your sensitive to all morals then there is part where he stole a picture of his love intrest. And when found out she didn't seem to mind to much. There is violence towards the end. No blood or bodies shown after being shot. I really commend actors and actresses who play dual rolls. I liked the movie.,1427673600,,339,4.396825396825397

7792815,1,0800129016,"Soooo disappointing. I expected The Whole Town's Talking to be way better than what it was. It seemed like when something finally happens, the movie's almost over. I really had my hopes set high for this 1. When it was over, it was over. I didn't feel a thing. It wasn't Yay that was a great movie or even I'm so glad that's over, I just felt numb. When I 1st heard about The Whole Town's Talking which was a long time ago, I knew I just had to see it. After all this time I finally had a chance to watch it. I knew what time it was coming on & did everything I could to make sure I didn't miss it, only to be disappointed. I nodded off 3-4 times but kept myself awake. After watching this movie I should've just let myself fall asleep. Skip The Whole Town's talking & go see Larceny, Inc. It's WAY better & I promise, you won't be disappointed (Man, writing this review has been a struggle)",1472342400,,891,4.097142857142857

7792818,2,0800129016,"I have an extensive collection of John Ford films and could never find this for purchase. So rented The Whole Town's Talking on Amazon streaming.

Very little to recommend here. Though the print is pristine, the film is flat. Too much ""down time"", unnecessary long takes of events that don't merit them. Perhaps a question of editing. Could have used Capra's snappier pace for this contemporary comedy of a mistaken identity.

Edward G. Robinson does a nice turn as a mild mannered clerk played against his gangster doppelganger but Jean Arthur is lost as Robinson's extremely unlikely love interest. No chemistry, no combustion. Ford too seems lost with this material, probably going through the motions while a project he cared more about was in the works. This is non-essential Ford, don't bother if you are looking for any of his signature strengths. He is best using past events/period pieces/small town/exotic locales for evocation, clearly contemporary urban comedy eludes him.",1463184000,,984,5.182389937106918
