8548998,5,B00AA9QJ1U,"I love this opera so much that I now have all four DVDs.  This is by far the best.  I first noticed that the sound was so much better than the others.  All the singers are better, even though they all are unfamiliar to me.  The sets I would call semi realistic, rather than the more unusual of the other DVDs.  If you must have only one Jenufa, don't miss this one ..",1389398400,6,367,3.9726027397260273
8548999,5,B00AA9QJ1U,"Although we were already spoiled for choice with Jenufa, here is a new one from Malm, beautifully sung and staged with a sure hand.  I'm not sure I understand the setting of the last scene, but the final gesture of reconciliation is realized with splendid subtlety.  The singing is uniformly fine, with the Kostelnicka perhaps taking the top honors.  She refuses to chew the scenery, and this keeps her characterization human.  At the end of her scene in Act I she has a smile of self-satisfaction.  At first I thought this was inappropriate, but on reflection it rings true.  She has not only succeeded in separating Jenufa and Steva (so she thinks, not knowing about the pregnancy, but probably certain that Steva cannot stay sober for a year), but she also gets her own back on his father, her deceased husband, through Steva.  She communicates this in one very telling moment.  The Jenufa and Laca realize all the emotional implications of their parts.  They grow in stature before our eyes as the opera progresses.  Steva is especially unlikeable (appropriately so).  Even Grandmother Burjya sings strongly, and the rest of the cast was very fine as well.

I did feel that the orchestral part is ""beautiful"" rather than ""dramatic""; I miss some of Janacek's rough edges.  Despite this, no musical point is lost, and the conductor supports the singers very strongly.  I would be hard-pressed to take a single choice from the available DVD/Blu-Ray versions; fortunately, I have them all for comparison.  This one will surely satisfy most listeners, as it hangs together well dramatically as well as vocally.",1376179200,9,1609,4.951492537313433
8549000,5,B00AA9QJ1U,"This production is very, very fine. Erika Sunnegardh has one of her dream roles here. (She is soon to be singing Turandot in Stockholm and  Fidelio at the Edinburgh Festival. And lots of Toscas in Germany.) The three main female roles and the two male ones are very very well done. And the production in all its simplicity is very effective. Bravo, Malmo Opera! And thank you Arthaus for publishing it!",1373241600,5,402,4.661971830985915
8549001,5,B00AA9QJ1U,"It's a great and powerful opera and I would say this version from Malmo is the best on DVD, I have all four of them.  The singing is uniformly good, the period setting 1930s/40s is effective, good balance between close-up and whole stage views.  It's a shame that Amazon would put all the reviews from other productions under this new version.",1361664000,11,343,4.60655737704918
