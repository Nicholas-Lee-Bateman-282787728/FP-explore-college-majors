8599356,1,B001D7WFA2,"Amazon's product details for Polarvision Gallery shows a run time of 150 minutes. There may be 150 minutes of audio as is shown on the back of the DVD case, but the DVD consists of about 4 minutes of video in continuous loop with 5 different sound tracks options.

When I first played this DVD I thought that the menus were poorly designed and that I was not pressing the right buttons, but on loading the DVD into my computer and playing all the individual VOB files it is shocking that there is nothing more on this disk than the same 4 minute loop with different music tracks, some previews of other DVDs and a ""bonus"" sequence.

The video itself is poor quality as one might shoot with a consumer grade video camera at the zoo or on a cruise ship. The music selections are annoying and inappropriate.

Clearly this product is intentionlly designed as a rip-off, and I will certainly not buy any other product from Bfs Entertainment, American Home Treasures, or Brainworks Entertainment. Amazon should refuse to carry any of the products of these companies.

I give this DVD a rating of 1 star because it is both entertaining and somewhat satisfying watching it being ground up in a shredder into pretty rainbow colored flakes.",1250899200,,1230,4.654377880184332
