8227243,5,B000X7S9RQ,"A stranger wanders on to a rich farmers ranch, discovers he has a lot of cash, convinces the farmers daughter to steal her fathers cash, and elope to the city with him. In the city, the strangers girlfriend is enraged to see him with another woman. When the stranger discovers the farmers daughter is to inherit millions from an uncle, he hurries to marry her before she realizes hes after her money. Conflicts galore within this threesome. This film is the premier example of a feature comedy of the period. Pure humor with no dialogue cards that I recall. Chaplin is a genius at this type of film, and Normand and Dressler give stand out performances. This film is very slapstickyits hard to imagine anything they didn't bump into, fall over, or get hit with. [I estimate 200 falls, and that may be conservative.] The film may be too slapsticky for contemporary tastes, but its great fun if you give it a chance. I highly recommend this movie and any Chaplin film, for that matter.",1524355200,,983,4.622857142857143

8227245,4,B000X7S9RQ,"This was the beginning of the Chaplin's ""Little Tramp"" character.  He and Marie Dressler are hilarious together and their chemistry is amazing.  Dressler was already in her 40's when she played the innocent girl that Chaplin tries to marry for her money.  While the plot is not very sophisticated, Chaplin and Dressler are amazing in their physical comedy and mugging for the camera.  Both actors went on to much more significant roles and talkies which makes this even more interesting from a historical perspective.  Interesting to see a glimpse of 1914.",1467072000,,556,5.065934065934066
8227246,5,B000X7S9RQ,"I have never before seen a film with the great Marie Dressler in it; thanks to Grapevine Video, I've not only seen TWO, but Dressler at the very beginning of her movie career. Already a big star on stage, producer Mack Sennett (who met the irrepressible Dressler backstage in his youth) repaid Dressler's kindness by giving her a plum role in what was touted as the first feature-length comedy, ""Tillie's Punctured Romance"" (1914). Charlie Chaplin, who was brand new to Keystone Studios, gets top billing, with his name & face looming largely in other DVD packages of this film (which are numerous). Grapevine was wise in showing Dressler solely on the DVD case, for she's the title character, and rightly deserves her due. It opens with city slicker Chaplin (sans his Little Tramp character) running into (quite literally) Dressler's naive country girl, who introduces him to her father. Immediately, Chaplin schemes to ""get the girl in order to get the money"" when he eyes the family stash. And so, he woos Dressler & whisks her away to the big city, where they both have some wild cavorting..and Chaplin hooks up with his ""real"" girlfriend (Mabel Normand, a delicately beautiful contrast to Dressler's big-boned frumpy gal), who's just as much an opportunist as Chaplin. Dressler can't pay a restaurant bill (guess who has her money?), and gets thrown in jail. Later, she takes a waitressing job to repay the money lost; Chaplin & Normand inconveniently show up at the restaurant, riling up Dressler. Chaplin discovers her uncle has died & left a fortune; he wastes no time dragging her to the nearest justice of the peace & getting hitched. Now living in high society, it's not long before Dressler sees Chaplin's & Normand's duplicity, and she goes berserk, firing a gun wildly. The film climaxes on a pier, with Chaplin getting his ""just desserts"" for his bad behavior, and Dressler & Normand comfort each other. It's easy to see why this became such a hit back then, as it just never lets up on the slapstick (hey, it was made by Sennett; what else would you expect?). What it lacks in subtlety, it makes up in sheer energy, as you can never accuse it of being dull. And while Chaplin uses every movement & expression to his advantage--the same with Normand, to a lesser degree--Dressler really chews the scenery as this not-so-delicate flower shoves, slaps & kicks. Even the Keystone Kops appear at the end, along with cameos from Charley Chase, Edgar Kennedy, Chester Conklin, Ford Sterling, etc.
""Tillie Wakes Up"" (1917) is practically a stand-alone film which has very little in common with the original. Dressler's friend Frances Marion wrote this script which relies more on situation comedy & pathos than genuine slapstick. Dressler's ""Tillie"" is neglected by her husband, and extremely unhappy (a close-up shows her literally crying into her coffee!). She takes the advice of a news article about ""finding a Romeo to make your spouse take notice & rekindle love lost"". Coinciding with Johnny Hines, who's also unhappy in his own marriage, the two decide to go off on an innocent lark, and spend the day at an amusement park. Once there, the film veers into some amusing moments as the two ""heartbroken souls"" react to the crazy rides (Marie showing her expressive face, in particular). The two other spouses finally come to their senses, and are reunited with Dressler & Hines, just as Dressler winks to Hines on the fade-out.
While Dressler's best work would really come a decade later (she was one of THE top box-office stars from 1930 until when she died in 1934) with such films as ""Min and Bill"" and ""Dinner at Eight"". But it's interesting to see  Miss Dressler in these earlier efforts. As an actress, she was certainly a force to be reckoned with!",1348012800,8,3769,4.85248447204969
8227247,1,B000X7S9RQ,"I'd like to second what the other reviewer said. I saw this film back in 2008 on TCM during a day dedicated to Marie Dressler films. The print looked very clear compared to what I had seen of this film just a year earlier. The motion was very smooth and there were hardly any jumping frames. I bought this DVD on the chance that the film had been properly restored. Perhaps it has, but not by this company.

If you get a chance to see it on TCM please do. Marie Dressler is great as the plain daughter of a well-off man who is tricked by a con-man (Charles Chaplin) into believing that he cares for her. He gets her to run away with him on the belief that they will be married, and also gets her to take a wad of cash from dad's stack of money. Once away from home he takes the money and runs away - back to his real girlfriend. Dressler shows off all of the comical expressions that made her a box office favorite in her 60's, and even without the power of speech that she had with the advent of talking pictures she steals the film from Chaplin. The film is thus highly recommended, but this product is not. Unfortunately, the best copy available of this film out there is still the Image Entertainment version of the DVD which is now over ten years old.",1257033600,6,1256,4.190082644628099
8227248,1,B000X7S9RQ,"I am so sorry I bought this. A total disappointment if you're looking for a watchable version of this comic landmark. It has been duped so many times that some darker scenes are almost blacked out entirely, and the rest isn't much improvement. The Image version is much much better. Unfortunately, according to Amazon, it has been discontinued, but you can get it in instant play from Netflix.",1243987200,7,393,4.794117647058823
8227249,1,B000X7S9RQ,"I saw Tillie's Punctured Romance, the first full-length silent comedy, on TCM recently and was hoping that this DVD would look as good or better. Especially since it appears to be the only DVD of it available.

Forget it!

Worse looking than a six-hour VHS, the video was choppy and blurry. I had  to stop viewing after five minutes because it was totally unenjoyable.

I knew that I was taking a chance on this but since the price was cheap it was still worth the gamble. Unfortunately, I lost.",1242777600,7,495,4.52808988764045
