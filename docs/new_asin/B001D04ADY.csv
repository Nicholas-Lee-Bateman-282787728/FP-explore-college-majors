8290622,5,B001D04ADY,"I bought a 10-movie Maverick Entertainment set from the $5 bin at Walmart called Dark Disposition.  13 Hours in a Warehouse is the first movie of this set.  For an American-made B-movie, this film resembles some of the better Japanese horror films.  Spooky, moody, scary.  Not that much blood and gore.  The ghost movements are well done, and, as I said, move much like ghosts or ghouls in Japanese horror.

I already feel I have gotten my money's worth and I have nine more movies to watch.",1447977600,,491,4.586206896551724

8290624,4,B001D04ADY,"I don't know why the film producers chose a lame soundtrack for the film while using a great one during the credit roll. The soundtrack as well as the quality of the low budget production gave it that super VHS feel. Now having said that, I did find the film enjoyable even if the twist (if you can call it that) was so obvious.

A gang of art thieves hold up in a warehouse awaiting the fence who will arrive in the morning. They also have an unplanned person (Meisha Johnson) with them who they have to tie up. The rat infested warehouse, we are told, was once used to make porno films. The number 32369 appears written on the wall and is the movie's other mystery. The guys opt to stay up all night drinking and listening to music...but then there is a loud noise...

There is some good interaction dialouge including a philosophical discussion on the genius of Robin Williams. Acting was acceptable. Decent ghost story with build-up.

F-bombs, no sex, nudity (male butt) sex talk.",1332374400,,984,4.51685393258427
8290625,1,B001D04ADY,Suprisingly this film moves  at a good pace and the acting is  pretty good as well. Okay it is a ghost story - even that's okay. The real problem is the set. Here we have a warehouse that was abandoned  more than 20 years ago yet the former manager's office  looks  untouched  in all those years. Only a few cobwebs ; litle dust; the  electricity  still  works ( who paid the bills?); the lights / fridge/ VCR/ tv all are in perfect working order after such a long time. Surely the family would have removed them. Even the safe was  left behind-surely  someone would have been curious as to  what was in it.  Whoever gave this  film  5 stars must have been connected  to the making of the  film- a common practice on this site.,1291593600,2,727,4.266666666666667

8290627,3,B001D04ADY,"Professional thieves who resemble the ensemble cast from Jackass (minus the midget) hole up in an abandoned warehouse while awaiting a buyer for their stolen artwork.  During the 13 hour wait, they discover and discuss the fact that the warehouse used to be a porn set; they debate the comedic talents of Robin Williams (he's not funny - never has been), one psycho discusses a technique that can debilitate a human into a rag-doll, and another proclaims to be the king of dead rat hockey.

While espousing their views to one another, an apparition - reminiscent of J-Horror ghosts - visits their only hostage.  The ghost tells her that she is safe, and whispers the numbers ""32369"" - the same number spray painted on the wall.  Soon enough the simple criminals must struggle to survive against static-covered ghosts that want no survivors.  Much like Lost, the numbers may be a clue to survival, but will the criminals find out in time to save their own lives?

The ghosts, gore, and screams are above average; a few are even downright creepy.  And while the majority of the movie feels like a&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Reservoir-Dogs/dp/6304490100/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Reservoir Dogs</a>&nbsp;ripoff - a portion is also directly from the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/8MM/dp/B000BBOUW2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">8MM</a>&nbsp;script - it's easy to overlook.  Most of the characters are believable and fairly well acted.  One guy reminded me of Brad Pitt's performance in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/12-Monkeys/dp/B000HT3Q14/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">12 Monkeys</a>, and another a poor man's Jason Statham.  The strength of this movie, however, is the dialogue.  Witty one-liners, pop culture references, f-bombs, and clever conversation rules the day.  In fact, the interaction between the characters is good for a few laughs amidst the terror.  The one major downside to the movie is the roller-coaster audio ride, at times an incoherent whisper and at others similar to the sound of a jackhammer waking someone up from a deep sleep.

The locale, plot, and horror are sure to keep a viewer's attention, and the remake of the night-vision scene from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Silence-of-the-Lambs/dp/6305073333/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Silence of the Lambs</a>&nbsp;is superb.  It's low-budget, but worth it for horror fans.",1230422400,,2533,6.259365994236311
8290628,1,B001D04ADY,"Rarely do I stop watching a movie in the middle, but I had to with this one.  Poor audio, poor acting, poor writing, and poor directing in general were the undoing of this film.

If the previews on the DVD don't tip you off, the opening titles should....the logo looks......cheap.  And the first shot appears CG.

The idea of the film isn't all bad, but the execution is where it all falls apart.  A skilled production team could have pulled it off but it just didn't happen with these guys.  It gets 1 star for at least not looking like it was shot on DV tape.",1229212800,,561,4.245283018867925
