8272155,5,B001968ZL0,"""Real Life"" is a dry, witty, brilliant continuous joke of a film by Albert Brooks, and constitutes one of his early gems as an independent film writer, director and star.  Real Life is very enjoyable, and not to be missed.  I give it all 5 of the stars I awarded this double feature.  ""My First Mister"" was simply awful.  I could not bear to watch more than the first 20 minutes, an arbitrary point in time at which I allow myself to bail out of a film with no redeeming artistic value.  Life is too short to watch films that stink throughout the first 20 minutes.",1503792000,,564,4.283018867924528
