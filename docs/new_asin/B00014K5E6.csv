8006290,2,B00014K5E6,"I rather like Judy Lee (Ling Chia) and was very impressed by how the movie started. She was learning the 'Crane' style and did fantastically well with it . I thought that she might continue through the film showing the same style and I'd watch the lovely Judy Lee using 'Crane' with superb showmanship. But the movie then sorta changed directions and shifted gears and there was a strong male lead and the story seemed different but still, it was alright as there was a strong 'chemistry' between Ling Chia and the male lead and it was still alright although the combat scenes no longer featured Judy Lee and 'Crane' and that was a disappointment. The young man marries Judy Lee but she won't bed him unless he defeats her in a Kung Fu fight which he can't do so he sleeps outside. And then comes the disagreeable (sick) part. There is a comic character that follows the young man around and in the morning, the comic character walks outside and pees (with the camera doing a close-up of a flow of something) and he's actually peeing on the young man who then pushes the comic character into a water-filled barrel. And this ruined the film for me. I'm just not into body-fluid humor and I don't need a closeup of some guy peeing on another guy. (I think the late George Carlin referred to this as something like 'scataholic' humor and I don't like it.) The rest of the film is a minor bloodbath and you can have my copy if you want it.",1385337600,,1435,4.418867924528302
8006291,2,B00014K5E6,"When I first saw that CRANE FIGHTER, one of Judy Lee's best films, was finally available on DVD and in widescreen I was very excited.  When I opened the box after it arrived, I became more and more DISAPPOINTED.  First, this is the second of three DVDs I've ordered from amazon.com (both VIDEOASIA DVDs if that's who's to blame) that have arrived sliding around loosely inside the DVD case.  After opening all THREE (!) of the security enclosed tape strips found along the sides of each box, and having the package art tear off along with the tape (AGGGHHH!), I then picked up the loose CRANE FIGHTER disc to find scratches all over it (amazon.com PLEASE tell whoever you need to that the packagers of these DVDs need to do a better job!).  Luckilly both the discs I've received from amazon.com that were scratched played without skipping, but they now have no resale value.  And I just might want to sell CRANE FIGHTER, but I doubt anyone would want it anyway.  As I pressed play I immediatley saw that the VIDEO ASIA DVD of CRANE FIGHTER is NOT WIDESCREEN as the box label indicates.  It is instead a transfer of an old VHS copy complete with lines and glitches of tape wear and tear, dull color, and blurry images (it's a copy of a copy of a copy at the very least).  Also VIDEO ASIA DVDs, while sometimes providing neat interviews with stars on their DVDs, sometimes seem to run at slower speeds than the original prints.  CRANE FIGHTER and INVINCIBLE ARMOR both look like something's wrong with the running speed of the film.  The fight scenes especially (the best parts!) look like some silent film transfers look today.  They have an unnatural speed of motion, almost like a strobe-like effect on a dance floor.  I was SO DISAPPOINTED to find this out.  It completely ruined my enjoyment of the films.  If you are able to rent VIDEOASIA DVDs at your local rental stores, I recommend doing so before wasting your money since the quality of individual titles varies and the labels on individual DVDs are not always to be believed.  I hope VIDEOASIA will treat its DVDs and it's customers with more respect in the future.  Sorry, to break this news to you kung fu movie fans about this version of CRANE FIGHTER, but save your money for a better version in the future if you can.",1090800000,7,2282,4.556372549019608
