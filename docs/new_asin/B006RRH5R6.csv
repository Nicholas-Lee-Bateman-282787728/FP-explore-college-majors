8503632,3,B006RRH5R6,"I HAVE THIS RETRO-HORROR GEM FROM THE EARLY 70'S AND FEEL IT DESERVES A RESSURECTION! WHERE ELSE CAN YOU FIND A LADY IN DISTRESS, CREEPY CASTLE, A MAD DOCTOR, A WOLFMAN TURNED PART TIME MR.HYDE? HEY, IN THIS DAY AND AGE, BETTER TO HAVE 2 JOBS! IT IS VERY EUROPEAN AND VERY FUNNY IN PARTS. SO IF MONSTERS FROM THE GOTHIC GOLDEN AGE IS WHAT YOU'RE AFTER...YOU FOUND THE RIGHT CASTLE.",1344988800,,381,4.380281690140845
8503633,1,B006RRH5R6,"Stay away from this God-awful release!! I don't know where all these ""legit"" DVD releasing companies are popping up from but sometimes you're better off going to one of the more highly regarded ""bootleg"" vendors for uncut and original language versions of these classic films. Or just get yourself a multi-region player and buy the original PAL discs. This sucker has cuts right from the very beginning. I have a bootleg from the PAL disc (out of print) that has a much longer opening scene (and is in original Spanish w/English subtitles). This Apprehensive Films release is not even widescreen. It's FULL FRAME! C'mon guys! Really? If there's a widescreen version that was made available to the Euro market, why couldn't you license that one? You're giving fans a nasty, chopped up public domain version and have the nerve to make it seem so important that we grab a copy because it's limited to ONLY 500 COPIES! You should have limited it to only 5 copies. One for each of your buddies/fellow employees. STAY AWAY FROM THIS RELEASE!!",1336867200,9,1036,4.825842696629214
8503634,1,B006RRH5R6,The colors were very washed out and there were many scenes missing. Very disappointed.....thought this was a special edition with only 500 copies made (DVD-rs).,1328400000,14,160,5.44
