8194053,5,B0009Q0FHS,"Billy has had a hard time, mother and girlfriend murdered, sister kidnapped and another girlfriend not allowed to see him any more because there is some dire Ninja killings going on in her police chief father's jurisdiction. Gordon is the top Ninja and Larry is the head criminal. Billy has an Australian accent and Lyn sounds like she's from South Carolina. The splicing in of the Ninja story and the Philipino film is really badly done. The print quality in some places is atrocious and very dark in places.
The Ivan the Red angry cockerny Ninja story is stupid and his fights last about 30 seconds and are rubbish. The final fight with Gordon is total rubbish. This footage looks like it was filmed in the countryside of Wales.
The only stolen music I recognized was Hawkwind's In Search of Space and there seemed to be a Tangerine Dream track which I didn't recognize during the incredibly dull boatyard scene at the end. There also seemed to be some goth track used. Better music than Ninja Dragon ( where Dragon wasn't even a Ninja).
Billy the newly graduated Ninja doesn't use much martial arts but favours machineguns.
As usual with the genius Godfrey Ho a lot of the plot is confusing and the ending is total rubbish. Larry does something at the end but somehow it was bad boy Ivan who did it - he travelled from Wales to the Philippines.
If you have a sense of humour get this, the 4 film 2 disc ""Martial Arts"" is available for a penny and has the most important film never to have won 15 Oscars...Ninja Terminator which is beyond reality.
I have ordered 7 Godfrey Ho films which cost 13 including postage which I am really looking forward to.
""Gordon 's a great Ninja"" iiiiieeeeeeeee!!!!!!!!!!",1400889600,,1704,4.608552631578948
