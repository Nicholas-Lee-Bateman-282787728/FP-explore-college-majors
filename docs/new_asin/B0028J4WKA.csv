Seasun recommends to learn a combo at a time. Her cueing is excellent, but it moves fast. However, once you get it, it's awesome fun. The music is vocal up-to-date hit music to motivate you through the rough spots. Also has a nice core workout.",1241395200,5,404,4.328947368421052

8356298,5,B0028J4WKA,"This is definitely not for a beginner, it doesn't deserve the one star from reviewers who don't know what they're getting into! This is one of the best step dvds ever made in my opinion. She DOES cue well, it's just very very fast and some of it is just going to have to be learned over time, and she even explains during the workout that the reason for that is replay value. The music is GREAT, real up to date music instead of that blah elevator music a lot of workouts have. Her movements are perfectly with the beat of the music as well. She is not too chatty and keeps you motivated. There are three shorter workout options which is great because I only do 30 minutes a day. I do this one often, and it serves it's purpose of never being boring and always being fun!",1409702400,2,771,4.181208053691275

8356300,5,B0028J4WKA,"Seauson is very fast and at times confusing.  Her cueing is sometimes late, which adds to the confusion.  It hard to follow her when she is facing you.",1392681600,,151,4.357142857142857
8356301,5,B0028J4WKA,"I must warn you.  I have never had a dance class in my life.  The most complicated workouts I've ever done were Kathy Smith and Denise Austin.  I began stepping about 8 months ago.  I started with Tonya Larson's step pump.  Very simple and fun.  I moved on to her CIA.  After about 4 months of finally getting her moves down, I thought it couldn't get any more complex.  Boy was I wrong.  I have done this workout about 20 times and am just now getting the hang of it.  I no longer look like I'm flailing about and have just about worked up to all of Seasun's complex moves.  I actually look forward to cardio day and have passed my workout plateau.  It is very mentally challenging and I don't mind figuring it out.  I appreciate the fact that she doesn't break it all down, because that would make the video boring after a while.  I would prefer a workout segment that breaks down the steps.  Now I just need to find some better shoes.",1353974400,,937,4.244318181818182
8356302,3,B0028J4WKA,"this dvd is fun and set to contemporary music, but i still have not been able to learn the whole routine after 6 months.  it takes me one whole work out to learn a new step.  i don't think this would be the case if seausun simply cued regularly.  if i ever learn the routine i think it will be a fun and challenging work out.",1342569600,,325,3.893939393939394
8356303,2,B0028J4WKA,"I'm working overseas so I'm kind of stuck with the fitness DVD's I came out with. That explains why I'm still working out with this DVD--it's taken me about 2 months of one and off use before I can 'mostly' do all the steps. Yes. I have other videos that have a seperate section where steps are explained. Not this one! Just try to pick it up she says! And this is fast-paced, complex choreography too. The music is good, so once you learn it, it's fun. It just takes a while to learn it. Be warned.",1322092800,,499,4.154639175257732
8356304,5,B0028J4WKA,"This DVD is definitely for the advanced stepper and it will take time to learn. I tried this DVD 5 or 6 times before I mastered all of the moves. The music in this DVD is top 40 hits, which is really nice for a change. I'm used to workout DVDs having dance music with no words. The DVD consists of a warm-up, 4 step sections, and a cool-down/stretch. The cueing is spot on. One dancer sticks with the basic moves, and everyone else follows Seasun through the advanced moves. I highly recommend this DVD for the advanced stepper with some patience to learn the moves.",1300233600,,566,4.349056603773585
8356305,5,B0028J4WKA,Not for the beginner. Must be patient and willing to take the time to figure out the moves.,1287360000,2,91,4.111111111111111
8356306,5,B0028J4WKA,"This is a terrific workout that is geared towards advanced steppers.  Its challenging to learn, but once you learn the routine its great fun!  Seasun cues her step combos beautifully.  There are great partial step combos if you don't have time for the entire workout.  Great fun, great workout.  Looking to buy more dvds by Seasun Zieger.",1259798400,4,338,4.859649122807017
