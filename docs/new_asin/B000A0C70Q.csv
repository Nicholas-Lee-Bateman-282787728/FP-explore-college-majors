8070988,4,B000A0C70Q,"The product is nicely done and thorough, we bought it for our church. My comment is regarding the price. It was our responsibility to double check this, but we ""assumed"" that for $176 we would be getting a set containing multiple DVDs. That was incorrect, instead we got a single DVD.  We later discovered that this item is commonly available for $29.99 plus shipping at several other websites.",1354579200,,394,4.794117647058823

Jesus The New Way consists of 6 half-hour programs, written and presented by the New Testament scholar Tom Wright (N. T. Wright). It was originally produced in 1998. Wright frequently appears onscreen speaking directly to the camera; otherwise he narrates over selected scenes from films about Jesus. Particular use is made of the excellent film simply called Jesus, starring Brian Deacon (1979). The six presentations are entitled: Getting the Kingdom Started, Startling Surprises, Longing for a King, Why Did Jesus Die?, Who Was Jesus?, and The New Claim. Printable materials intended to aid group study are included in the DVD.

The series is intended as an introduction to the mission and message of Jesus in its historical context. Overall, it succeeds quite well and could be used as part of a curriculum for adults or mature youths in Christian churches. Some supplementary help will be needed, however, in two of the later presentations. In these Wright quite naturally emphasizes his own contributions and insights as a New Testament scholar, but here these special insights crowd out traditional but still valid affirmations:

In WHY DID JESUS DIE? Wright shows how Jesus intended to die in order to be a kind of lightening-rod for God's wrath so that others may be forgiven. This is fascinating, but leaves out other facets of the significance of the cross. Many scripture passages are used, but strangely Mark 10:45 (and parallels) is not.

In WHO WAS JESUS? Wright affirms that Jesus was human, but instead of a direct affirmation that Jesus was also divine, he shifts the question from an ontological one (about Christ's being and person) to one speaking of his activity and mission. Here Wright shows us how Jesus was deliberately enacting the story of God in his own person. The effect is enriching and powerful, but when one remembers the original question (Who was Jesus?), it is hard to shake the feeling that Wright is being unnecessarily coy about Jesus' divinity.

In sum, this is a warm and provocative introduction to Jesus by a renowned New Testament scholar, for which we can be grateful. Its specific deficiencies can be overcome by reminding ourselves of the broader New Testament affirmations about the cross and about the triune nature of God (i.e. by a more explicit Trinitarian theology). In the final segment, Wright vigorously affirms the actual, historical reality of the resurrection of Jesus from the dead, and suggests some of the implications of this extraordinary event.",1191024000,17,2783,5.462790697674419
