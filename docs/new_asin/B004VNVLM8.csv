8443702,5,B004VNVLM8,"A compelling collection from African directors, including three women. Two are favorites: Wanuri Kahiu's ""Pumizi,"" offering a beautifully imagined futuristic tale of environmental devastation alongside the importance of hope. And ""The Tunnel"" speaks of Mugabe's ordered massacre in Zimbabwe from the mouth of a precocious child. Important work that all should see.",1505088000,,364,6.019230769230769
