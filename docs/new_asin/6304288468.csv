830300,5,6304288468,"The Munsters' Revenge is, as reunion movies go, an excellent outing. The stars look remarkably unchanged (in spite of the 15 year interval)and their typical performances in character leave you feeling they've never really been away - especially with a script which is very reminiscent of the original series and is quite strong in its humour. What a great idea to release this on DVD and let's hope that this encourages the release of more Universal product reunion movies on DVD such as The Return of Ironside, The Rockford Files, etc. Well worth the money.",999216000,16,558,4.88421052631579
830301,2,6304288468,"We all know the score where these efforts are concerned -- reunions are always disappointing, parading before the viewer a selection of older, less graceful performers, puncturing any rose-tinted vestiges of nostalgia that  one may have.  Yet, in spite of this, I forever find myself seemingly  hypnotically drawn to such efforts, usually with some morbid exercise in  critical vivisection in mind...
...and it was with those sentiments  that I approached ""The Munsters' Revenge"", which predictably  falls foul of most of the pitfalls of the reunion phenomenon, though  emerges as a quaint oddity which is better than most flicks of its sort.  Undoubtedly it benefits greatly from the fact that stars Fred Gwynne and Al  Lewis seem to have barely aged, managing to slip into their old routines  with ease.  The producers wisely devote the lion's share of the action to  their double act, relegating an awkward and heavier Yvonne De Carlo to a  few token scenes.
As if to underline the fundamental absurdity of  attempting to recreate the past, it is the script which unwittingly seems  to prove that the age of the Munsters had gone forever.  The show's naive,  quaint charm is lost amidst the cynicism of the 1980s, with its shades of  racism, violence and lost innocence glaring through sadly too often.  The  comic aside where Herman gathers a mound of guns and hands them over to  persuing police officers, puppy dog ineptitude intact, is a silent triumph  for a comedy which is not so much misbegotten as anachronistic.
Not  necessarily a bad film, but instead one which simply came too late.",936576000,4,1597,4.965909090909091
830405,5,6304288468,"I've always loved The Munsters.....this is one of the best (however, I was disappointed that the original ""Eddie"" wasn't in it.  It was an extra special treat, as there was an appearance by the late Sid Caesar!!!!  Great DVD!",1396224000,,225,4.743589743589744
830406,2,6304288468,"Although it was entertaining to see Fred Gwynne and Al Lewis portray Herman and Grampa for a final hurrah, this movie had terrible writing, which is typical of the reunion movies of the time. Unfortunately the producers of these films seemed only interested in getting an original cast together. Once they had the cast, THEN they wrote a story around it. The result was nearly always a disappointing mess. ""Munsters Revenge"" was no exception. Many critics felt that Butch Patrick and Pat Priest should have been cast as Eddie and Marilyn. I agree. Since their roles were minor anyway, it would have been great to see them again. It's a wonder why they bothered to get Yvonne DeCarlo since she had an extremely minor role. And the GREAT Sid Caesar was reduced to another terrible waste of talent. The writers had no respect for the performers but also it seems to me that the aging performers were simply out to make a buck in this movie without any worries about the terrible script.
I understand that Fred Gwynne asked for an ""astronomical sum"" to reprise his role as Herman. I'd really like to know exactly what that sum was, just out of curiosity. How much did NBC pay him to reprise his role? Considering how poorly this movie was made, it's a wonder how they got by with spending any serious sum of money to produce it.
This movie was not a completely dismal failure, although close to it. I did enjoy seeing Fred and Al together. But, as with all these reunions, if they spent just a fraction of the time writing a good story as they spent reuniting the cast, it could have been a great finale for the cast. Instead, it was just plain terrible. This film was easily worse than ANY poor episode of the original series. Unfortunately, the only reunion movie I ever saw that not only brought together an original cast but was also a decent story was the Andy Griffith show reunion. Oh, well. As bad as it is, I suppose I have to say that it's better than no reunion at all. It certainly is better than the 1980s remake of the show.",1256774400,,2034,4.485175202156334
830407,3,6304288468,"This is the last time the Munsters were seen together, and in a very bad NBC 'Made for TV' movie at that (shame on you NBC!!).

In a Nut Shell...

Munsters are honored in a wax museum, but the evil owner of the wax museum decides to incorporate robotics into the wax figures of the Munsters and the rest of the exhibits and have them perform criminal activity. And when the police go looking they arrest the real versions.

The make-up is nowhere as good as the 1960's ""Munster Go Home"" movie, but if you are Munster fan like myself, you need to have this in your collection.",1180483200,,575,4.305555555555555
830408,4,6304288468,"This Munster movie is nearly as good as ""Munsters Go Home!"".  There are quite a number of hilarious scenes in this film that make it a timeless work of comedy.  This movie is funny!

The film begins with the Munster family checking out the local wax museum, where Herman tells his wife Lilly - ""Dear, you can get some good decorating ideas for our house"".  When they see their replicas, they like them.  But Lilly laments - ""Everybody's here except poor Marilyn"".  Herman remarks ""You can't blame them, they don't want to scare away the customers"".

A series of small robberies are later blamed on the Munsters, because the robbers look just like them.  The cops arrest Herman and Grandpa.  They later escape.  Driving in a car, Grandpa tells Herman that somebody that looks just like them is doing these crimes.  Herman says nobody is as handsome as he, except his reflection and his likeness at the wax museum.  Grandpa shouts ""Herman, you got it"".  Herman replys ""Got what""?  Grandpa explains that their answers are likely to be found at the wax museum.

They go to the wax museum and learn about the crime ring that has produced wax models that are also robots, and those robots are doing the crimes.  Kinda like Marvin Bush blowing up the Twin Towers and blaming it on alleged Arabs - the baddies are having their robots do crimes and the Munsters are getting the blame.

The bad guys are planning a big robbery of an ancient Egyptian mummy's coffin.  The Munsters foil the crime with a little help from Marilyn and her new beau - the police detective, and alot of help from The Phantom of the Opera.  A good ending to a good movie.",1151798400,5,1637,4.544520547945205

830410,5,6304288468,"At first, I was disappointed that Marilyn and Eddie were to be played by different actors, but I guess it was inevitable as they had aged too much to stay ""in character"". I was also put off by the sharp colored makeup (the series was in BW), but these are minor quibbles.

Herman and Grandpa have such amazing chemistry here. In the series, I never sensed the warmth between these two as I do here.

A special treat is comedy great Sid Caesar (Your Show of Shows). He plays Dustin Diablo, an evil genius from ANCIENT EGYPT!

I won't give away too much plot, but it is basically a ""mistaken identity"" comedy, as Herman and Grandpa are framed by Diablo and arrested while Diablo's ""men"" are free carry out their elaborate heist.

If you love ""Phantom of the Opera"", he's in here too!",1124236800,8,781,4.440559440559441
830411,5,6304288468,"When I wrote my letter I was going strictly on memory.  When I watch the repeats of ""The Munsters"" on Cable TV I never notice that were very many episodes except the first 37.  So, I am sorry I was wrong because I must have seen the second season when I was 11 years old and forgotten it.  Jonny Quest I know for a fact only lasted one season.

When it comes to the movies, there appears to be a lot of movies release on DVD that I simply didn't know about.  I also found out that ""The Munsters' Revenge"" 1981 also star the original cast.  So, thank you for pointing this out to me.  Now, I have found a movie I never seen before.",1095292800,4,630,3.992
830412,3,6304288468,"This had all the makings of a huge disaster. We had already born witness to the huge travesty that was The Addams Family Halloween reunion special four years earlier in 1977, so there weren't high expectations for this one. While the film is by no means a classic or what one would of hoped, it isn't all that bad at all. It's quite enjoyable and very watchable and makes you just about forget The Addams Family mistake. Well, almost. By now, we all know the story already. The Munsters was an ABC show that ran for only two seasons(1964-1966)and consisted of 70 episodes. There was the man of the house, Herman Munster(Fred Gwynne), his wife Lily(Yvonne DeCarlo), her father Grandpa(Al Lewis), son Eddie(Butch Patrick), and beautiful niece Marilyn(Originally Beverly Owen, then Pat Priest). They resided at 1313 Mockinbird Lane. This 1981 reunion brings back the 3 main players, Gwynne, DeCarlo, and Lewis, while newcomers played Eddie and Marilyn. Comedy legend Sid Caesar plays a crook who has his wax dummies at the wax museum come to life and pull off robberies. Two such wax dummies are dead ringers for Herman and Grandpa. Naturally, our favorite gruesome twosome are charged with the robberies and it's up to Herman and Grandpa to clear their names and stop the madman. The depiction of Herman and Grandpa as a slapsticky comedy team is fun. What is really special about this goodhearted reunion is that the 3 main actors are all in fine form. It was as tho not a day had passed since their final episode in 1966. Gwynne, who was 54 at the time, was as usual, perfection. He knows Herman inside and out and there is not a single difference in his look or performance as Herman. He was fantastic and never got the credit he deserved. Al Lewis is Grandpa and like Gwynne, it was as if nothing had changed. There was definitley noticeability in age with DeCarlo however. Still, she was Lily. There was nothing to write home about the new actors who played Marilyn and Eddie. Obviously the original actors would of been too old to play these roles now. Points also go to the set of the famous Munster abode. It is pretty much the way it was on the series. It was nice to see the house, what we saw of it, in color. The first Munster movie, ""Munster, Go Home!"" in 1966, was nice, but I liked and enjoyed this one better. Like I said before, it could of easily of been a horrible disaster, but with the fantastically in top form Gwynne and Lewis, the house, and the endearing charm of the film and the series' legacy, it wasn't all that bad. Now, how about a big screen update?.",1081468800,29,2580,4.5625
830413,3,6304288468,"For those of us who are lifelong fans of ""The Munsters,"" this made-for-TV reunion, while weak in storyline, at least continues the life of the original series sadly cut short after only two seasons.  Fred Gwynne and Al Lewis look mostly unchanged and the pair have lost none of their camraderie, and even a noticeably older Yvonne DeCarlo holds up well.  Kudos also go to the set designers, who seem to have assembled as many of the original props as could be found for the interior set of the Munster home which fans know so well.  [Note, however, that exterior shots of the house are taken from ""Munster, Go Home!,"" with ""England or Bust"" painted on the family car.  By the time ""The Munsters' Revenge"" was produced, the original house facade at Universal had gone through several unfortunate alterations and must have been too costly to restore and re-dress.]  Call this one ""for fans only.""",1077494400,23,894,4.741935483870968

I thought it was back then but I still liked it and now I love it. It's not as good as the TV show or the original Movie Munster Go Home but it has
the main characters who are always great and nobody could replace them. The story is actually good and funny enough to keep fans of the
show and kids laughing thru out even though has some really dumb moments and bad acting by some of the other cast members. Sid Ceaser
is great and the always great Howard Morris [Ernest T. Bass] from Andy Griffith show. I can say this show how bad TV was starting to get
back then with remakes and no originality even after they cancelled it years earlier! The problem is it's obvious it was made in 80's and

7866896,5,6304288468,"If you loved ""The Munsters"" TV show, you'll enjoy this TV reunion movie.  The basic premise of the story and the nature of the comedy is the same as the series, and the classic ""Munster"" actors slip back into their roles as if not a day had passed in the 15 years since they last played the roles, though Al Lewis's Grandpa is a little less frenetic.

Like several episodes (and the ""Munster Go Home"" movie), this one has the family tangling with crooks--which seemed like the kind of plot device required to carry an entire movie.

That said, there are some disappointments:

* Although three actreses had previously played Marilyn Munster, none of them is brought back and yet another actress takes on the role.  She does fine (it's not a challenging part to play), but it's a little disappoining nonetheless

* Butch Patrick--though alive and well at the time--was not brought back as Eddie, and instead a 12 year-old actor takes his place, apparently suggesting that the writers wanted to pretend that the Munsters is (and always was) set in the 1980s.  It's hardly more than a cameo, but it would have been nice to see Butch again instead.

* Worst of all: the addition to the cast of ""Cousin Phantom of the Opera"" (Yes, that's actually what they called him).  For fans, that was a real clinker.  All of the Munsters--including one-time cameo family members like the Wolfman and the Creature of the Black Lagoon--had common, ordinary first names that did not seem to fit the monster personnas.  The Frankenstein monster is ""Herman,"" Dracula is ""Grandpa,"" etc.  This new Phantom of the Opera character really should have been named Cousin Irving or Cousin Sid something.  But instead he has no name at all.  He is Cousin Phantom of the Opera.

But I still give it five stars.  Maybe because it's nostalgic comfort food, and the pluses far outweigh the minuses",1416441600,,1863,4.7213622291021675
