1662498,5,B00005TPNB,We bought these nearly two years ago and she still loves them. We like them for the calm stories that don't wind her up.,1243209600,,120,4.041666666666667
1662499,1,B00005TPNB,"This is not our favorite of the Kipper videos, and if you are a parent that tries hard to screen out today's violent and nightmare-causing kid's shows, you would be angry at the content of this particular video.

The episode in which Kipper finds a lamp (British for Flashlight, I guess) and Kipper goes to buddy Tiger's house and they discover the secret staircase which leads up endlessly and then finally to the top where they meet the ugly fire-breathing dragon that tries to breath fire at them was shockingly scary for my 3 yr old son and shocking for me as a parent.  My son had nightmares about dragons for weeks after watching this and to this day will cautiously ask to see this video (because he likes the other episodes) and then wants me to be on stand-by, ready to skip over the ""scaaary-dragon"" episode.  Needless to say, this video has just disappeared from our video collection.

What a complete contradiction to the other cute, gentle, adorable Kipper videos.  As a parent that tries so hard to keep tabs on today's frightening, violent, abusive, foul kid's shows, I had established a fool-hearty level of trust in Kipper since we own so many of their other great light-hearted videos.  It re-affirmed for me the importance of always scrutinizing even the most innocent appearing shows.

If you are looking for more sweet, innocent, captivating, and fun Kipper videos, I would highly recommend Fun in the Sun, Pools Parks & Picnics, Playtime, and Let it Snow over this one.  A couple episodes on the latter-mentioned videos do  utter the word ""stupid"", which I am not altogether pleased with, but we skip those and/or we have a talk about ""naughty words"" to deal with that.  At least none of the videos I mentioned score sleepless nights for our family.",1209168000,20,1771,4.739413680781759

Understandable for kids
Low stress plot
Grammatically correct in general
Limited number of characters
Character Development
Voice actors

Pig and Arnold are also brilliant characters.  As simple as the show seems, there is a lot going on to watch.  And lastly, my 10, 20, and 30 minute power nap regimen fits well with the show's format...

1662611,5,B00005TPNB,"Kipper in general is marketed towards very young children, which I am not. I thoroughly enjoyed Kipper when I was part of the target demographic, back when Kipper was just a book series. I came across this movie last night and it was a good watch because of the nostalgia and because for the most part, the stories are cute and lack conflict. Unlike most of the material marketed at my demographic, nobody who makes this is trying to tell an emotionally gripping story to tug at my heart strings, or load everything up with heavy symbolism. This is simplistic and happy, exactly the kind of thing I need right now.

This particular movie has a pretty good ""Just say No"" moment too, if you think that your kid could end up frightened, fast forward through anything involving a 'bicycle lamp' and 'stripping wallpaper'. Those will let you know that the bit with the dragon that other reviewers pointed out is coming. I was able to handle that moment by virtue of being old enough to know that Kipper is, sadly, not real.",1397952000,3,1018,4.562841530054645

Yes, there is that scary dragon one, which my son gets scared of, too. However, my son really relates to Kipper and his friends. He reenacts the scenarios in his spare time and even the scary stories seem to help him deal with his own fears. He will pretend, kind of relive the story in such a way that I think he is processing his fear and how to respond to it. Kipper is the best there is. No other video character comes close.

1662637,3,B00005TPNB,"We really like Kipper! My son is three and has been watching since he was two. He enjoys the characters and the stories. We, his parents, enjoy that Kipper involves simple stories and graphics that are gentle to our son's developing mind (we are very conservative with ""screen time,"" and this may sound overly protective and crazy to some parents, but we like to err on the side of caution when it comes to media) It's my first time reviewing a Kipper video, and I've chosen this particular one because it is different from all the others we have seen.

IMPORTANT PART: As another reviewer mentioned, there is a somewhat scary sequence where Kipper and friends end up in space (on a roller coaster?), where they encounter a dragon of some sort. This scares my son enough that he calls for me to keep him company if I am busy doing something else around the house. Granted, he hasn't been exposed to much else in movies or TV, so this probably won't bother most other children who have - but I just wanted to put it out there in case there are other sensitive little ones who want to watch this one. It's right around the middle of this (Imagine That!) collection of episodes.",1375747200,,1175,4.490654205607477

1662651,5,B00005TPNB,I like this because I use my kindle in a preschool class it is wonderful to have several short videos linked together.  Attention spans of little ones is very very short at times.,1361923200,,179,4.424242424242424
1662652,5,B00005TPNB,My grand daughters can't seem to get enough of it. Everytime they are over it is either Angelina or Kipper. The stories are nice an short to hold their attention.,1361664000,,162,4.433333333333334
1662653,5,B00005TPNB,Like I said I bought this for my oldest niece and now it can be passed down to my youngest niece.,1353974400,,97,3.6666666666666665
1662654,5,B00005TPNB,"Kipper: Imagine That is a childrens story about a dog that goes on a wild journey and meets up with some scary creatures such as a dragon.  I realize that some kids might find the dragon scary- it actually scares me, haha.  Overall, this how a childrens story SHOULD be told- it's cute, adorable, funny and even suspenseful in a few spots (but not *too* suspenseful as to distract and make your kids cry).  Not picking up an adorable story like this for your kids is an absolute crime.  Do so today!  Oh, and if there's more to this adorable and loveable puppy, pick up those stories too.  Kipper is just awesome!",1334361600,,613,4.428571428571429
1662655,5,B00005TPNB,"Have purchased a number of the ""Kipper"" children's books and
found them fun to watch - even tho' I am an adult. Martin Clunes' velvety, gentle voice is easy to listen to as he plays Kipper.",1303776000,,189,4.277777777777778
1662656,4,B00005TPNB,"My kids have loved Kipper for several years, and had this on video at one point. However, in this day and age, a DVD has become more practical. So the younger kids used Christmas money to buy this. Compared to most ""kids shows"" these days, I can tolerate Kipper pretty well. It's a cute enough show.",1297036800,,299,4.357142857142857
1662657,5,B00005TPNB,"my daughters are 3, 7 & 10... believe it or not, they ALL just LOVE any kipper dvd/video!!  the stories/adventures are so sweet and i just love the bit of english accent going on! (my 3 yr old often copies how kipper & tiger speak!).  i highly recommend this dvd.  my daughters reach for it weekly.",1294704000,5,298,4.285714285714286
1662658,5,B00005TPNB,"We lost this particular DVD and I had to order it again.  We have a lot of the Kipper DVDs and the kids love them.  They're nice and soothing.  Actually, of all the DVDs we have, Kipper is probably one of the few you could let the kids relax to before bed.  Kipper, along with the Berenstein Bears and a few Veggie Tales is basically my childrens' favorite cartoons.",1272326400,,366,4.260869565217392
