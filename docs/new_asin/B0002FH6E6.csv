8027812,2,B0002FH6E6,"Good Times Home Video made it's mark in the mid 80's by releasing hundreds of public domain movies on VHS for the then unheard of price of $10. At the time the major movie studios were just beginning to create their own home video companies to release their movies while small independent home video companies were busy releasing foreign, independent, public domain, and television movies all around the $95 range. These were also the years when the rights to ""It's A Wonderful Life"" were in limbo and assumed in public domain. Many television stations ran the film on Christmas Eve believing they were doing it for free. From this the once forgotten movie built a following and home video companies were all quick to release their own copies. Good Times was no different, but by cutting corners on production by releasing the movie in a cardboard sleeve instead of a case ( unheard of at the time as the other companies released videos inside large boxes or plastic cases ) and transferred their movies at the LP ( long play ) speed onto T-60 tapes ( the others transferred movies at the SP speed on T-120's) and of course by releasing public domain movies they did not have to pay royalties on, they were able to cut the price down to $10. Suddenly the average person could afford to buy a home video and Good Times outsold all other companies releasing ""It's A Wonderful Life"".

Soon Good Times was doing business releasing other public domain movies such as John Wayne in ""Angel And The Badman"" and Lon Chaney in ""Phantom Of The Opera"". By the end of the 80's Good Times had scrapped the bottom of the barrel of Public Domain movies with named stars and began releasing movies who's public domain status was questionable. Such was the release of a long out of circulation John Wayne movie ""McLintock!"". The movie itself was planned for a future release by it's legal owners who had other classic movies they were releasing first. The last time ""McLintock!"" was seen was in a 1965 television broadcast. Since the edited for television version was copyrighted to the network that ran it and that copyright was not renewed, Good Times claimed that the television version was public domain even though the theatrical version was still copyrighted. Therefore Good Times had released the movie under good faith and were immune from prosecution of video piracy. By the time the true owners of ""McLintock"" were able to file a cease and desist order Good Times had already manufactured and shipped millions of copies.  Good Times would continue to mine for gold with questionable copyrighted material for the next few years ( and they were not alone in this practice. Other independent home video companies were doing the same )until eventually by the 90's the company had built itself up enough to pay for and release copyrighted movies, mostly fare like martial arts movies, but occasionally major recent Hollywood movies like ""Nobody's Fool"". Not bad for a company that started as a few VCRs linked together in someone's garage.

""Classic Moments with Laurel & Hardy"" came out about the time Good Times was releasing questionable copyrighted material. They had already released other L&H films ""Utopia"" and ""Flying Deuces"" which were in the public domain as well as ""Pick A Star"" and the short ""Be Big"" which was in the questionable category. They used Laurel & Hardy again when they got a copy of ""Stolen Jools"", an all star benefit short from the 1930's used to raise money to research lung disease. Many stars contributed brief cameos including Laurel & Hardy. ""Stolen Jools"" was originally released on a tape called ""Funniest Men in Comedy"" along with two other public domain (?) shorts, one by Bing Crosby and one by Bob Hope ( although on the tape for less than a minute Laurel & Hardy were prominently displayed on the box ). This was later released as a double feature with an episode of ""The Jack Benny Comedy Hour"" also in the public domain. Another tape called ""Golden Television Classics: Laurel & Hardy On Parade"" featured two shorts that were released to television in the 50's that were edited from the movie ""Bonnie Scotland"" ( also questionable as MGM/UA video had the copyrights to ""Bonnie Scotland"" ). Eventually Good Times was getting copies of short movies and coming attractions that were way too short to release on their own, but together would make a good compilation tape. Opening with footage from Stolen Jools, it cuts to the scene from ""Lucky Dog"" where L&H worked on screen for the first time. From there we cut to the isolated L&H scenes in ""Pick A Star"", followed by a theater trailer for one of the many L&H compilation movies that came out in the 60's, followed by the silent newsreel footage of their 1932 visit to England, Followed by half of the short ""Be Big"", followed by the shark/suicide scene from ""Flying Deuces"", followed by the L&H scene from ""Tree In A Test Tube"", followed by the ship interview where Hardy announces they are filming ""A-Toll K"", followed by a clip from ""A-Toll K"" ( identified as ""Utopia"" ), Followed by coming attractions for ""Air Raid Wardens"", Followed by an abridged version of ""This Is Your Life: Laurel & Hardy"", Followed by home movies of L&H in their final years.

At the time this was released much of the L&H films were not available. ""Nostalgia Merchant"" who was releasing their shorts and some features had just gone bankrupt and their videos had disappeared from the shelves. MGM/UA was offering ""Bonnie Scotland"" at the price range of $95. It would be a few years before the company Video Treasures began releasing more L&H movies and MGM?UA began to release all the L&H movies they had the rights to. For anyone who just got a VCR and was eager to begin their L&H library, this tape was practically all that was available. Therefore it was good for it's time. But today where people expect DVD quality prints instead of the bootleg sources Good Times usually got their movies from, and expect tidbits like this to be included as bonus material or special features or Easter eggs on DVDs rather than the main feature. Today there is no real reason to get this tape unless you are a collector who wants to own a copy of every L&H video ever released.",1187308800,,6225,4.734562211981567
