7943411,5,B00005KHL9,"Wonderfully acted. That's what I love about these British productions. Great supporting cast,i.e., major actors who are not afraid to take second billing in order to tackle meaty roles - James Fox as Angus Meikle, Bernard Hepton and Barbara Leigh-Hunt as Nigel Havers' parents, just to name a few.  The details are just right, even down to Marjorie's utilitarian undergarments while shopping for a dinner gown! We saw the relatively comfortable country life lived by the Flemings contrasted with the bombed out streets of London.  The story doesn't end happily ever after; you have to imagine what would come next.  But all in all, I loved this series.",1180310400,,652,5.018518518518518
7943412,5,B00005KHL9,"I was happily surprised by this series.  The short synopsis given makes it sound very depressing.  It was not.  Acting was brilliant, low key and believable.  This was a very uplifting series.  When it ended, I just wanted to see the whole thing over again.  That rarely happens to me. Money very well spent.",1162252800,,308,4.611111111111111
7943413,5,B00005KHL9,"""A Perfect Hero"" is a spectacularly accurate and vivid portrayal of the lives of many of the men who fought and died during the Battle of Britain.  Specifically, the series captures in the character of young pilot officer Hugh Fleming the cavalier and flamboyant attitude towards life, love and the war that many Spitfire and Hurricane pilots had at that time in the war.  It is only after the experience of being shot down in flames during a brief engagement with the Luftwaffe during the Battle of Britain, with the event leaving him badly & painfully burned and horribly disfigured, that Hugh Fleming figuratively and literally rises from the ashes to become not only a man of character, compassion, wisdom and vision but also ""A Perfect Hero"" in the eyes of his King, his country, his family and the woman who truly loves him.

But there is more here than the courage of one fighter pilot who has been written off by his lowly fiancee', his unit and his friends.  There is the extraordinary courage of those in the medical profession, who at the time of the Battle and throughout WWII, were the leading pioneers in the treatment wounds caused by horrific burns.  They, to, went beyond treatment and sought to repair not only the shattered bodies of those persons terribly burned and crippled by fire, but lead the way in physical and psychological therapy, which enabled many ""Heros"", both men and women, to rebuild and repair their shattered lives.

Many people today are unaware of just how dangerous it was to be a Spitfire pilot.  Although the Spitfire's designer (Mitchell) was a revolutionary aeronautical genius, the Spitfire was not without flaws.  Chiefly, the fuel tank was located right in front of the cockpit, and a well placed hit from enemy aircraft or ground fire could render the Spitfire as nothing more than an inferno.

""A Perfect Hero"" is a must see for anyone who is interested not only in the depictions and stories of heroic comebacks, but also for those who are inspired by the courage of man to fulfill his potential regardless of any setback.  It is, quite literally, the most inspirational portrayal of man at his worst and at his best every portrayed in an event (the Battle of Britain), whose outcome saved all of mankind.",1149206400,14,2256,4.776349614395887
7943414,2,B00005KHL9,"This is a story about a womanizer named of Hugh Fleming, who is supposedly sort of middle class and hangs with a rich crowd at Cambridge.  He urges them to join the RAF prior to the war to be pilots.  He is very good.  He is very good at everything, much to the jealousy of his friends.  His girl, Bunty, is a good time party girl.  Hugh is never faithful.  He cheats constantly.  Anyway, the DVD is an interesting story about Hugh, his love of a good time, love of his handsome looks, and how he loses his looks and his recovery.  He meets up with Maggie, a middle class girl from school he had an affair with.  She is his physical therapist.  I liked Hugh's family, the scenes with his Dad and sister Susan were very good.  You had to like his plastic surgeon, too.  However, sometimes Hugh's antics/acting were childish like his friend TIm. Also, it made no real sense for Maggie to stay with Hugh considering his obsession with Bunty.  After Bunty goes off and marries another, he keeps her photo up! But the biggest issue is that the stories ending is incomplete. After watching 6 episodes, the viewer should at least find out how it ends!!!  It looks like Hugh will fly again but does he survive the war?  Shame on the director to cheat the viewer of an ending.  I honestly can not recommend this DVD since it is a huge waste of time to sit through all the episodes and not even know what happens to Hugh.",1120089600,9,1411,4.307984790874524
7943415,5,B00005KHL9,"Like ""Piece of Cake"" and ""Danger UXB"", this is another British production that stays with you long after you've seen it.  I saw it years ago on PBS and ordered it for the library I work at.  I'm now in the process of viewing it again and enjoying it just as much the second time.  All three are excellent and highly recommended.",1064707200,9,328,4.258064516129032
7943416,5,B00005KHL9,"A Perfect Hero is the story of an RAF pilot who makes the mistake of not wearing his mask his plane catches on fire during aerial combat.  In many aircraft of this period, the fuel tank was right in front of the pilot making fire a constant threat.
The pilot somehow survives and ends up in the care of a plastic surgeon who attempts to repair the worst aspects of what the fire left for him to work with.  While he is under treatment, the perfect hero is shown to be less than perfect.  His relations with women are a key point that stay with him from his university days through the end of the program.
The cast is excellent as are the settings.  The make-up is tremendously effective not just for the principle actor but for all the other wounded pilots under treatment with him.  It is highly realistic.
The emotional content of those wounded is also brought to the forefront.  Some pilots feel that a destroyed face is all that they are required to give and can't wait to leave the service.  Others want to go back up and try again.
Civilian war work is shown.  It shows that no one was wasted in wartime Great Britain.  If you couldn't fight you could somehow suppport the war effort, it just remained for the labor exchange to find you the right place.
I recommend this series to all those with an interest in military history and the impact of war on all people, because there is more to A Perfect Hero than heroism.",1011139200,15,1424,4.363636363636363
7943417,5,B00005KHL9,"We saw this series when it was broadcast on PBS and absolutely loved it.  The characters are fantastically written and acted; the writing is superb and the theme song ""Bells of Hell"" is wonderful--for sometime we even had it playing on our answering machine.  This video set is definitely worth purchasing.",994982400,9,306,4.980392156862745
