5368804,3,B009UHHEP8,"Bob Hoskins is one of my favorite actors. He's an ugly little fellow that has overcome his physical shortcomings to become one of the most accomplished thespians of this generation. This quaint little story happens in a small cockney bar, and almost every scene is shot there or at the horse track, giving the movie a panoramic feel. The horses are gorgeous and the race track scenes are exciting. There is just enough family comradery and feelings of unity and friendship that some scenes may require a hanky run.",1442275200,,514,4.786516853932584
