8334513,4,B001PSUM0Y,"[This review goes for collection 1 and 2]

These are the bare facts and I try to tell them in obscure detail (relating to the story itself) so that you can judge for yourself if this is something that would deter you from viewing the anime without spoiling or taking any of the mystery away from the story itself.

(We just finished watching this so my memory is fresh.)

***Nudity: There is no nudity - however, there are two female (possibly three) spirits who have large busts and are not really wearing any clothes. They don't have human skin tones though and this ""nudity"" is not detailed meaning they are no more detailed than a Barbie doll. At least one of them does have a line-for-her-behind, but she is fish-like and... it's just... kind of there.

***There is no innuendo, sexual references, or sensual fan-service.
There is one part that may imply something in the series where a man is seen carrying an unconscious girl away and he says ""I never had any interest in her heart or mind."" but that is it - nothing more is said or seen.
One time a woman puts a man's face into her chest, but nothing more. Both are fully clothed and the woman is wearing a high up neckline and she says something like 'I will take care of everything' (referring to her job).

***Violence: There is rarely any blood (when a spirit is killed there is no blood).

[Nudity, sexual references, and innuendo are my big concerns, so I don't provide many details violence-wise as that is not something I  equally take as much note of and I might forget some of those parts - unless, of course, it is REALLY violent - which this is not. Also, providing in-depth details for violence would also be quite likely to spoil the unknown or suspense of parts in a story and might lead you to predict future events prematurely... Well, OK, that can go for the others too, I guess, but I think those important to know in advance when deciding what I am or am NOT interested in getting.]

**Personal Opinion of the Series**
I had fun watching this over again (this time with my sister). It kept us interested through the whole series (even though I had already seen it a while ago) and we didn't feel like it was being dragged on. The ending was fine too.
I wouldn't categorize it with my 'favorites' - BUT - I did enjoy watching it and am glad that I bought it.

*Note on the DVD case: The discs are stacked on top of one another and that caused mine to arrive with some light scratches, but thankfully that does not affect the play of the DVDS or at least not in a big way. (A couple of times the DVD player seemed to make some noticeable pitch type sounds though, so maybe that's why). I take extremely excellent care of my things, so its a little frustrating that it came new - with scratches.",1456185600,,2770,4.384015594541911
