6033591,4,B00FW6B8X0,It's very interesting but not the great movie.  Still recommend it to others.  It is not much of nudity as I can recall of.,1440633600,,123,4.083333333333333
6033592,5,B00FW6B8X0,"Do spoilers follow? Yes indeed!

The plot was so twisty, the villain so malicious that I found myself hanging on every word. I loved Eliza Bennett as Kayleigh, the baddy, a brilliant sociopath whose arrogance is her greatest strength and weakness. But Daisy Lowe as former model Pippa was for me the main attraction, a wounded beauty, terminally ashamed of the scars that adorn her body, shut in, but with a heart full of love. These movies often revolve around the moment when a good person loses his or her inhibitions and commit to a violent agenda. Pippa is fascinating because no matter what the crisis, she finds herself incapable to bring direct physical harm to anyone.
We're so fortunate to live in a day when so many great horror-y thrillers are being served up to us. Yay for everyone who made this great movie!!!

P.S. I've noticed that a lot of the popular critics here include a ""Parental Guidance"" paragraph at the end of their reviews. Good idea! I'm going to try it out!

6033594,1,B00FW6B8X0,Please don't waste your time or money on this one. So disappointing! Slow beginning middle and ending. Poor acting and no plot.,1395532800,,127,4.818181818181818
6033595,4,B00FW6B8X0,"Pippa (Daisy Lowe) was a twin model. After a car accident which disfigured her and caused her to use a cane, she has become a recluse in her apartment, not leaving it for four years. Following a robbery gone bad, Kayleigh (Eliza Bennett) forces her way into Pippa's apartment  and takes her prisoner/hostage...although for the dysfunctional Pippa, she can't walk outside her door without having a crippling anxiety attack. The two women bond in an unusual way as Kayleigh freely travels the world while Pippa never leaves her world. Things get really sour when a third person shows up at the apartment (Alfie Allen).

This is a home break-in film with a slight twist. I thought the directing and acting was spot on even though the dialog failed to reach its potential. It was all filmed in one location with minimal amount of actors which shows that good films can come from small budgets with a decent script and actors who can deliver lines.

The film has been nominated for several film festival awards and even won a couple.

6033730,4,B00FW6B8X0,"Ignore the blurb, ignore the poster, and the title. Also ignore the reviews by people who did not. Character study of opposite personalities, or opposite personality disorders, in conflict. How does a ""socially gifted"" but disillusioned and now damaged former fashion model/recluse come into contact with an outgoing art-thieving sociopath? She collects a lot of valuable art. But the point is, how does this meeting of the unbalanced minds unfold? Interestingly, not absolutely engrossingly, but interestingly. Acting good, convincing. Actors well cast for their roles. The character of the model is somewhat bungled in my opinion -- it could have been less ambiguous -- or so I imagine. A background of interesting art (as mentioned, the link between the two) was a good idea for a film shot entirely in one appartment.",1459900800,2,821,5.2272727272727275

I only was able to get to 25 minutes in, and could not bear to watch another utterly boring minute.  I can't believe I even waited that long, but kept hoping it would pick up. VERY slow, and boring. Horrible horrible acting also. If the acting had been good, or even sub-par, I might've stuck with it, but the acting......I really can't even call it acting.  It was disturbingly awful.  I think it really needed some background music....it would have helped, but it still was a snoozer.",1478304000,,659,4.466666666666667
