8283922,3,B001BNUQ54,"There is so much to be said about Edgar Cayce; it's odd that in this hour-long special dedicated to him, he's not even mentioned until the 20-minute mark. The information given is interesting, but a full third of the production time is squandered discussing various other predictors of future events. The show is called ""the other Nostradamus,"" so one would expect some discussion to be dedicated to Nostradamus, and it is, but that discussion mostly serves to highlight how different Cayce was from Nostradamus. Cayce spoke from an unconscious state and matter of factly diagnosed illnesses and spoke of past and future events; Nostradamus read the stars as an astrologer and mathematician and predicted future events, he claimed, in cryptic short poems. Cayce seemed to be able to tap into the past, discussing Atlantis and ancient Egypt, and Nostradamus seemed primarily concerned with cautioning about future calamities a la the book of Revelation. So, again, my impression from this is that Cayce was indeed a wonder with inexplicable qualities of prophecy, but he was more of his own Edgar Cayce than he was another Nostradamus.",1444435200,,1134,5.135135135135135
