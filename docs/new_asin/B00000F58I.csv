7906832,5,B00000F58I,"Do not confuse this with ""Superliners"" from around '98, which included mostly interviews with John Maxtone-Graham. I taped an okay copy of that one from cable, and ordered this to see if it was the same, which it isn't.  This video is something only the avid enthusiast might consider buying as it is quite dated. But it's historical value warrants 5 stars, and is worth owning for any good ocean liner video library.  It is a classic presentation from 1980 when no one thought another ocean liner would ever be built, and cruise ships don't count as ocean liners.  I'm happy to own a copy.

QE2 is presented in this programme on a transatlantic crossing when she still had her white funnel.  Included is some brief footage of Queen Mary's final crossing with Captain Treasure Jones, the launching of S.S. France, and some history of many of the greats. It seems that one has to grab for every snippet of film ever made from ocean liners when one can get it, because no one will put out a DVD of all of the footage in existence from all of the historic liners in some order.  That would be a gem as it's difficult to remember which programme I remember seeing a particular scene.",1285372800,,1179,4.511737089201878
