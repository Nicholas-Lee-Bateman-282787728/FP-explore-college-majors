8079318,5,B000ARXFNC,"Where to begin - this DVD packs more historic facts in 90 minutes than any English history movie you've ever watched sitting in a college class.  If you ever wondered about the history of minced meat pies, Christmas cards, the transition of deciduous to pine trees as the Christmas Tree, how lights, ornaments and garland were introduced to Christmas trees, the ancestory of Queen Victoria, her husband and why Christmas as we know it today was so tied to her, the 12 days of Christmas, Christmas Carols, Oliver Cromwell's near removal of Christmas tradition in the 1600's, the use of Mistletoe - and it's berries, Holly, Christmas Crackers, the origins of Boxing Day - much earlier than Victorian England - and again - Cromwell's banning of this tradition, Father Christmas & St. Nicholas - a duel historic account, Nativity scenes, Charles Dickens, etc... - this may well be the documentary you wish to watch, and even own.  It isn't elaborate, nor is it animated, and stunning graphics are scant as well - but this DVD is wealthy in prose, fact and British scene and drawing which will warm your holiday for seasons to come.",1482364800,,1127,4.804123711340206

8079323,1,B000ARXFNC,"I didn't even want to award it one star!  Extremely disappointed in the content and quality of this show.  I was hoping for vignettes of Victorian life during this festive time of year, instead all I got was still photos, a boring condensed reading of, ""A Christmas Carol"", plus other useless factors, which I could have picked up more cheaply by surfing the web.  If you are interested in Victorian Christmases, may I recommend, ""A Child's Christmas in Wales"".  That is much more entertaining and worth your money.",1260057600,12,515,4.818181818181818

8079325,4,B000ARXFNC,"This DVD was interesting and informative, but dragged a little at times and I feel that a different narrator would have been more interesting.  Other than that, it was a good program.",1226793600,9,183,4.71875
