8597686,5,B00DTW6JHO,"As a fan of old shows from the late 30's and during the 50's, this collection is wonderful. The late 30's cliffhangers were exciting to watch and the shows from the 50's gave life to all the characters of the Dick Tracy comic strip. I recommend watching this collection.",1507680000,,270,4.530612244897959

8597691,5,B00DTW6JHO,"It has the first serial from 1937 (which was followed by four more).
Next the four ""Dick Tracy"" movies from the 1940s.
The few serials from 1950s TV is a plus.
Watch them, you won't regret this view about a passed America.
Note the attitudes, dress, roads, and automobiles.",1438041600,6,273,4.591836734693878
