8489778,5,B005ZLB0SU,What can I say? It's the story of the man who created the monster. The mention of OU is synonymous with football greatness and Bud Wilkinson is the one who started it all. Football was played at OU long before. But most Sooner fans mark time as before Bud and after Bud. No Sooner fan should be without these three part documentaries.,1429401600,,334,4.403225806451613

8489783,5,B005ZLB0SU,"Where is Part III?  AND make it is HD this time!

I think an additional movie would be not just about OU, but a contrast of the other power house teams and how OU compared...offense, defense, etc....  Too Nerdy?  Perhaps, but the overall accomplishments contrasted against those other teams makes the story even better.",1394755200,,319,4.851851851851852
8489784,5,B005ZLB0SU,This was a very well made history of Sooner football. Learn a lot I didn't know about that history. Just an enjoyable dvd to watch. Shows how Oklahoma became the college football power it is. Spencer Tillman shows why he is such a great College football analyst.,1349827200,,262,4.595744680851064
8489785,4,B005ZLB0SU,"This is an excellent book for football fans who are interested in coaching, especially for OU football fans.  There's a wealth of information about Bud Wilkinson's coaching strategies and tactics, and about Wilkinson the man.  He had a generous spirit, was very intelligent and talented at getting the very best performance from his players, who loved and appreciated him.",1330214400,,372,5.288135593220339
