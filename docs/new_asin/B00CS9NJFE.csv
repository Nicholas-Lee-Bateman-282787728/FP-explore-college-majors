8585708,3,B00CS9NJFE,"A rather bland set of Wakely films, but Wakely was a sort of bland Gene Autry type in some ways. ""Cannonball"" Taylor proves once again why he's considered the top side-kick in B westerns. Always fresh and always funny was he.",1481068800,,225,4.512195121951219
8585709,4,B00CS9NJFE,"You have to like ""B"" grade westerns and singing cowboysand you will find this to be a very entertaining DVD set to view.  Everything was kept to the simple side for plot, music and story line.",1383868800,3,192,4.333333333333333
8585710,5,B00CS9NJFE,"Jimmy Wakely was one of the last singing cowboys. He said he was indebted to Gene Autry for his career. in dress, style, and singing. He did not have whatever it was that made Autry so successful. But no other singing cowboy, except Roy Rogers, did either.
Probably Wakely's  greatest liability was Monogram Pictures. Monogram did not have the capability to promote actors that Republic or Columbia had. What always impressed me about Wakely's films was the presence of good country songs as well; as cowboy songs. Also, he used interesting musicians like Wesley Tuttle, Johnny Bond, Ray Whitley, and Colleen Summers before she teamed with Les Paul and became Mary Ford. There are plenty of 8-Western faces in the films, but the Monogram ranch is overused. As usual, the transfers of sound and image by Warner Archives are excellent as well the service by Amazon.
