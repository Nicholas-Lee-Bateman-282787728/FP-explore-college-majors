8520143,5,B007P4LBVG,"I bought this DVD because as a novice I wanted to learn more about the process. I had long admired the work of the Shiflett Brothers and when I saw that they had created this I did not hesitate. I was not disappointed. The video walks you through the creation of a sculpt from the building of the armature all the way to the finished piece. As the sculpt is forming the two brothers talk about each step. You may want to take notes while you watch because there is a wealth of information!

If you are a beginner and I suspect, an experienced sculptor, this very informative DVD will give you all the info you need.

It was really amazing to sit and watch as the sculpt came to life right in front of my eyes.

These two sculptors are incredibly talented and a joy to watch.",1333584000,2,774,4.216216216216216
