733498,5,6303944019,"Texas seemed to supply us with more than one good cowboy(Tex Ritter,etc.)but Monte Hale is one of the best. This film has Monte playing a medical student bank teller to pay for his education. You guessed it! The bank is robbed by Monte's fiancee Julia's(Lorna Gray)brother and Monte ends up being framed for murder.  Not wanting Julia to know her brother helped with the job Monte makes his escape and goes to hunt the gang of outlaws the brother runs with. Along the way he meets up with Foy Willing and the Riders Of The Purple Sage. Here's where we get treated to Monte Hale's pleasant texan voice,as well as the talent of Foy Willing and his boys,proving that there were a few good singers to follow Roy Rogers. All's well that ends well however. Monte gets in a few good fist fights and brings the bad guys to justice helping the sheriff spring a trap.

I was pleased with my copy of this tape. It was filmed in trucolor but for early colored pictures is fairly decent. For anybody who has never seen Monte Hale and likes singing cowboys this is a must for their collection.",1177891200,3,1079,4.472081218274112
