8043346,2,B0006U5V62,"The movie is as the title, Magnificent. The bad part is that the DVD is very scratched. I highly recommend to watch it but with a new copy.",1375142400,,139,4.0
8043347,4,B0006U5V62,"First, this is NOT a Spanish language spoken film,  it is a Filipino language but with few recognizable Spanish words.  But what contradicts my thought is that many of the actor's surnames are considered Spanish.  I can't figure it out.

Note:  I have been enlightened by a commenter as to why the Spanish surnames.  Read the comment

Some might call this a tearjerker, others might look at it as a little sappy.  I say the latter.  Director Maryo J. De los Reyes has made several films, from sex to fable, and this award winning 2003 focuses on a poor Filipino family who endure life's struggles while the boy named Magnifico, shines in his own heartwarming way.  The film is two hours long, moves a little slow at times.  Subtitles move fast, are difficult to read at times, and of course, lacking in translation.

The family consists of mom, dad, an aging sickly and dying grandmother, mentally handicapped young girl, nine-year old Magnifico, and an older brother who attended the university but dropped out.

Magnifico is observant to the family struggle, pressure and frustration at home.  They will not afford a coffin when the grandmother dies, become stressfully disappointed when the handicapped child won't speak, and endure the demands of the sick grandmother.  A once-believed-to-be scholastic son who dropped out of studies.  This older son sets out deceptively to win the heart of a rich girl so he can live in comfort.

But it is Magnifico, who only sees the world through care, comfort and challenge.  He secretly builds a coffin, hauls his sister on his back to the carnival, tends to his sickly grandmother with tenderness, and he raises money creatively.  And then, a twist and turn...stick around for the rest of the story!!  ....Rizzo",1203292800,3,1756,4.888135593220339
8043348,5,B0006U5V62,"A tear jerker is what my sister called it, so when I watched it I did cry too...and it was a good cry nevertheless.
The movie was well written and the acting by the cast and especially the young boy Magnifico was amazing.  This is a must watch movie and if you can own it.
beautiful, heart-warming, and just Magnificent!",1186531200,2,320,4.333333333333333
8043349,5,B0006U5V62,"Although this movie was very sad, it touched the hearts of many viewers. I highly recommend this movie to people who enjoy viewing films about life, love and family.",1149724800,2,165,4.724137931034483
8043350,5,B0006U5V62,"This was the saddest movie that I have watched.  Not only does this little boy portray persistance in trying to help his family, but his intentions are so good that you can't help but fall in love with this child.  I don't want to spoil the movie, but please watch this.  You definitely need the kleenex.",1145318400,4,304,4.392857142857143
