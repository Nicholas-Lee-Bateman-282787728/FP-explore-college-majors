The acting is superb and Song Seung Hun and Kim Tae Hee absolutely shine!  They are both adorable.  The story line belies the title and is really quite interesting.  What makes this so educational as well is everything that I learned about the customs, culture, fashion, history, and scenery of Korea.  I was enthralled!

LOL  The subtitles are often amusing and don't really translate into English that well, but you can totally understand what is going on.

My family absolutely couldn't understand why I was glued to my set watching a Korean Drama.  Especially one without any martial arts in it! LOL  I couldn't really understand it either except to say that I loved this series.  This is one of the rare shows that I've watched where I absolutely came to care about the characters.",1314835200,5,914,4.608695652173913
8463808,3,B005B0L4OU,I was enjoying this drama until the last disc.  The English subtitles  got so bad that it was really frustrating because I could not understand what was being said. The translation made absolutely no sense.  I bought this drama because I like romantic comedies and I'm a fan of Song Seung Hun. He's a great dramatic actor but he's good in comedic roles as well. Kim Tae Hee is lovely and makes a good romantic pair with Song  Seung Hun.,1314489600,,436,4.4125
