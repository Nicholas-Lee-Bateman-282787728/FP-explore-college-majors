5015015,1,B006RUT21A,"An absolutely terrible film. No plot to speak of, not even coherent storyline to hang onto, quite dreadful dreary dialogues, uninteresting flat characters, bad acting and even worse directing...
One may only wonder for whom it was actually made? For those who know the subjects touched in this film (Mt. Shasta & its peculiarities, portals, Clarion call, etc) - this dingy drag is too primitive and quite useless ; while for others (who may occasionally get interested in this field) it's a way too uninformative and totally uninspiring...",1412726400,2,539,5.136363636363637
5015016,2,B006RUT21A,"Growing up I was and am still a fan of Erin Gray when she was in Buck Rogers and Silver Spoons.  Unfortunately her acting in this movie didn't do it for me.  With the exception of Gary Graham and Tim O'Connor (who was outstanding) the rest of the cast sounded like they were reading their lines right off of paper.  Maybe I need to see this movie again but I had a difficult time following the story line.  It went from trying to find Erin Gray on a mountain top to her daughter singing on a mountain top.  It was great though to see Erin and Tim back together again in scenes; it brought back memories.  For me though however, I could have seen those two together in an Ed Wood movie an still enjoyed it.  I'm only giving this movie two stars instead of one star because Tim O'Connor was so awesome in it.",1365465600,2,806,4.161290322580645
5015017,5,B006RUT21A,"I'm a Heathen. Asatruar, to be specific. I found this movie, and its premise, to be quite interesting. I only watched it because it stars Erin Gray, Tim O'Connor, and Gary Graham -- all three are faves from way back. Glad I watched it. Presents a POV I hadn't heard of before. Always open to new things.",1355443200,2,303,4.333333333333333
5015018,4,B006RUT21A,"I really was grasped by the mystery of the film's idea. Not good to think that this movie gives altruistic answers for those who need something that really is not out there, except as a figment of one's imagination. I bought this movie because I wanted to see a mature Erin Gray. She is still hot.",1343779200,2,297,4.321428571428571
5015019,5,B006RUT21A,"This is a really super film. I thoughly enjoyed it and have no hesitation in recommending it to others. In ""Dreams Awake"" a dysfunctional American middle-class family finds itself unexpectedly staying on Mount Shasta (a real mountain in the Southern Cascades in California with long-term spiritual associations).
During their stay the mountain's spiritual influences begin to affect the individual members of the family. In particularly these influnces have a powerful effect on Hope, the wife, who finds herself on an emotionally spirtual jouney involving her past, present and future, which I found both deeply moving and powerfully inspirational. All the cast deliver impressive performances, but Erin Gray, in particular, delivers a particularly powerful performance as Hope, as her jouney of self-awarness climaxes on the slopes of Mount Shasta.",1334620800,13,850,5.6484375
5015020,1,B006RUT21A,"I was going to send the DVD back to the producers directly, with a letter of constructive feedback, but it is too late.  The acting of the main star, most of the characters, the character development, and the continuity in the writing is very, very, poor overall.  The first five minutes and other segments are dead, draggy, and boggy, like an uninteresting home movie you can't wait to be over. The lead actress I'm sure is a nice person but her acting is very flat. I wanted to share this film out into my community...but, what they would have to sit through to get to one short good visual effect, and one short good conversation - which was done by the only seasoned actor in the cast - I would not do that to my friends. I love to watch and also support spiritually based themes, but this was so corny and the story was so bad, don't waste you time. I tried to give it zero stars but that didn't work. This is a low-cost independently made film, that needed to consult with people who could have helped them before and during  the making of this film.
 My feeling after watching the movie and the brief special features was that most all of the people involved behind the actors were playing out their personal dream to make a movie, without the skills needed to pull it off.",1331510400,4,1280,4.3655462184873945
5015021,5,B006RUT21A,I brought this movie. It held my attention from the beginning right up to the end. It was an amazing good film. The actors did their jobs very well. I would recommend this film to everyone especially people who are seeking answers.,1330819200,6,231,4.523809523809524
5015022,5,B006RUT21A,We need more movies like this. Loved it! I loved the message of life goes on in the after this life.,1329177600,9,100,3.8095238095238093

8503639,2,B006RUT21A,"The talent in the movie is impressive. For the budget, I think they did a great job. That is why I gave them two stars. The message of the movie, however, I think could not have been worse. They are trying to spread a teaching that death is the ultimate spiritual experience and that we should leave our minds behind.",1475366400,,317,4.3
8503640,2,B006RUT21A,The story was good but the live stream was terrible . It kept stalling and the visual quality was not very good.,1474243200,,112,4.136363636363637
8503641,2,B006RUT21A,The sound quality is terrible in this field and apparently this industry can completely ignore the needs of those of us who need the captions or even prefer the option or both. It is not expensive to add captioning so why are these open and aware producers so out of it when it comes to a solution for the hearing impaired or let alone the myriad of other uses or users. I cannot enjoy the movie because I cannot follow or understand most of the dialogue.,1456272000,,455,4.3023255813953485
8503642,1,B006RUT21A,"I was so excited to finally watch this movie. It had been showing up on Facebook over and over. I love Mt Shasta and spiritual movies,  so I was very excited to watch. I had a roomful of hopeful viewers and five minutes in we were all laughing at it. It was a terrible plot and acting. I don't know who would like this movie, but it was good for a laugh! Hopefully someone will make a better movie about Mt Shasta one of these days. This was like a cheap lorn flick without the sex.",1455148800,,482,4.020833333333333

8503644,5,B006RUT21A,"It was a very informative movie and I would highly recommend it to anyone that wants or needs to have a little jolt into reality. It is an awakening movie, nothing like you've ever seen before and with an open mind and a loving heart, this movie will help out tremendously to show what is really going on around you. You just have a take your mind off of everything around you and let your misconceptions go. Everything around you is alive and has a heartbeat. EVERYTHING!!!",1412899200,,474,4.459770114942529
