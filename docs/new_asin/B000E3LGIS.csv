Pippi Longstockings meets the man with the prehensile sword.  And a giant robot.  And an insatiable lust for...condiments!
I borrowed this disc from the library and decided it was amusing enough to order the entire set.  The English voice actor for Van is what sold it for me, his delivery is perfect.  The villains can be a little too silly and over the top, but that doesn't hurt the show too much.",1365638400,,470,4.4941176470588236
8105361,5,B000E3LGIS,"Note: Just for clarification, this is a review of the whole series. This item contains only the first four episodes.

I'm almost entirely new to the world of anime, so I can't tell you all the ways in which this is like or unlike earlier works. All I can say is that as an anime outsider, I loved this show. I began watching it on Netflix when it was available for instant streaming. My first reaction to the pilot was something along the lines of ""What the freak?"" During the first volume, I reserved my judgment on the show. It was amusing at times, but strange. I didn't know what to make of it. The first few episodes were only just interesting enough to keep me watching.

Somewhere about the middle of the story, everything changed. I couldn't wait to see what happened next. I cared about the characters: Van and Wendy especially, but also others like Josh, Ray, Priscilla, etc. I laughed at the funny parts, frequently backing it up to watch particularly good bits of dialogue again. And I was sad to leave all the characters behind when I got to the end. I can't put it any other way except to say that this show drew me into its world and its story the way a really good fantasy novel used to draw me in as a child, leaving me to emerge blinking in surprise--and a little bit of disappointment--when I finally turned the last page. (I don't want to give anything away about the final episode, except that I had to watch it twice before I really got why it ""worked,"" even though it wasn't the kind of ending I had wanted. So, if you are disappointed with the ending, I recommend watching it again.)

Maybe the best thing I can say about Gun X Sword is that it makes me want to watch more anime, in the hope of having that drawn-into-the-world experience again.",1281139200,,1769,4.37082066869301
8105362,4,B000E3LGIS,"I'm sort of new to anime, only caught a few over the last two years. But I've been ill, so I've been using my ROKU while wheezing on the couch, and I've been enjoying some anime from the last few years that I didn't see the first time round, such as Saiyuki and some of the early episodes of Bleach.

I added this one to my line-up, and yesterday, I caught a little over half of the episodes in one sitting. Yep, that's like 5 hours of this in one go. I wouldn't have done that had I not been drawn in to the story of the black-clad, black-hatted, mecha-controlling loner on a revenge quest to get the Clawed Man who killed his bride. Not the most original plot, but it's definitely fitting for the west-meets-east-meets-a-little-steampunk sort of tale. It's got humor, action, family issues, and adventure. I like it.

Yes, it is a going from town to town chasing Claw-Man thing, helping people (no matter how initially reluctantly) along the way. Van may try to be aloof, but he ends up picking up sidekicks and aiding the oppresssed, all the same. And he has another ""armored"" fella out to kill the Claw competing with him. So, the race is on.

As I said, I'm over halfway done, and I found the 14 episodes engaging and the action fun and the humor not irritating (like some anime humor can get with the over-the-top cutesiness or dopeyness).

Obviously, other reviewers have a more broad anime perspective with which to judge/compare/find faults. As a newbie anime-watcher, I think this is a fun series and I want to see what happens to the characters. I even like the weird intro music that starts with taiko drumming and segues into a sort of Western-retro-theme updated for anime.

Mileages vary, right?

8105363,3,B000E3LGIS,"Wendy Garrett's town has gone to the pits because a ruthless gang known as ""The Wild Bunch"" has set their eyes on robbing the town bank, even if it means killing what's left of the inhabitants in a homage to Road Warrior, except in Gun Sword, the leader of the gang has a mecha, called an ""armor"" to threaten the citizens. Enter a strange tuxedoed man named Van who also owns an armor and a sword with strange powers. He's too busy pursuing his own troubles hunting down a killer known as ""Claw"" and doesn't want to stop to help the town. Or does he? Especially when Wendy says she'll marry him if he'll help! They do have something in common because Wendy's missing brother was last seen with Claw. So they'll join forces, well, Wendy doesn't have any force except her brother's gun which she carries more for sentimental value than any expertise with the weapon. The two will get into all kinds of trouble as they continue their search across Endless Illusion and meet interesting people like the information expert Carmen99, a girl so buxom that she enters a room before she does, if you know what I mean. The 99 stands for her bust size!

Gun Sword is another entry into the wanna-be Japanese Western that started with Cowboy Bebop and continues with shows like Samurai Gun. But it works partially, because the mysterious loner who comes riding into town bringing justice with his gun is an American idea. The characters are appealing in a limited way and seem to have a lot going on under the surface which is shown to good effect by some of the quieter scenes. The music and the villains are a little overwrought and silly at times but that's no surprise because the stories were written by Hideyuki Kurata, who also wrote Read or Die, which had very eccentric bad guys. While the show is entertaining, you feel as you've already seen bits and pieces of it in another anime, but it's still early on in its run, so I'll reserve judgement. The animation at least is above par.

Extras: Gun X Sword-San Ep. 1&2-- two short episodes featuring cgi hand puppets of some of the show's characters in comedy bits which are quite funny. Clean openings/endings. TV Commercial collection. Art Gallery.",1152748800,2,2195,4.611253196930947
8105364,3,B000E3LGIS,"Admittedly at first glance this show does look like grand eye candy, but with Kurata Hideyuki working on this project I could not resist picking up the first volume to see for myself.  Kurata's work is most familiar to me from the R.O.D. franchise.  Read or Die was an enjoyable OVA, but R.O.D. the TV had the right mix of action, music, humor, and heart for me to get really wound into the story.  I am hoping that Gun Sword can live up to my expectations.

So far, the music has been rather generic, the action and humor are somewhat underplayed, but if Kurata's writing style holds true, this show may yet bloom.

If I were to compare this to any other Anime, I'd say it feels most like Big 0, but if it was written in the style of an early Hokey Western rather than the Film Noir look.  The hero clad in black, the look of the Mecha, the obligatory Mecha battle.  I'd almost say that it was Like Big O in Trigun, but it lacks everything of trigun except the semi-serious semi-humorous western theme.

If I was to choose on Mecha Anime to top my list, it would be Soukyuu no Fafner (I believe the western version is simply called Fafner).  It's got the great music, a decent story, and a lot of emotion.  Still, I wouldn't write off Kurata-sensei's writing talent so quickly.  I'm gonna stay loyal to this show for now.",1149120000,,1322,4.333333333333333
8105365,2,B000E3LGIS,"This show is very similar to, and feels just like S-CRY-Ed. That statement alone will tell you more about what this show is like than any summary or plot description. The director, assistant director, and music composer of this show are the same as for S-CRY-Ed, and that resulted in a similar show even though the animation studio is completely different than for S-CRY-Ed.

I got this hoping it would be like another Godannar, since it is the show that the animation studio AIC ASTA did right after Godannar. Gun Sword also uses the same style of character drawings as Godannar, in the style of character designer Takahiro Kimura. However I was disppointed in this show as it is nothing like Godannar other than the female characters being drawn in the same style.

I kind of liked S-CRY-Ed actually, and watched it when it was free on Cartoon Network. But I don't really think it is worth it to buy this type of show that is sort of like a ""working show"" where characters engage in similar repetitive battles or job tasks on an episode-by-episode basis. Those kind of shows are better for teenagers and younger viewers in my opinion. I prefer my anime DVD purchases to be of the category where different things happen in each episode and the story evolves over time. I'd happily watch Gun Sword if it were free on Cartoon Network though.

Gun Sword can be good if you are looking for one of those television series working-type shows such as Cowboy Bebop or Ghost in the Shell:SAC, but not if you are looking for something interesting like a Godannar or a Madlax. My rating is 2 stars but if you like this type of show it could be a 3 or 4-star show for you.",1148860800,2,1661,4.511627906976744
8105366,5,B000E3LGIS,"If you like space westerns, mechas and colorful villains, Gun X Sword won't disappoint. The pacing, detail and action are topnotch. It doesn't take itself too seriously (like Hellsing) but it's not too comical (something Trigun was guilty of in its first parts at least). There are also some references for otakus, especially in the third episode featuring an aging super sentai team. An anime series worth picking up.",1148860800,2,418,5.072463768115942
8105367,4,B000E3LGIS,"When I first heard about Gun Sword, I was pretty pumped up about it. As an anime fan, it resembled all of those other anime greats out, such as Cowboy Bebop and Trigun. I figured any anime modeled after those two beauties would definitely be worth a watch. But then I let that sink in and began to worry. What if Gun Sword was modeled too much like the others mentioned? Would it even be worth watching, if it feels like I'm watching a repeat? It didn't sink in too much, and I still bought it, but all the while I wondered if I had made a mistake and wasted my money.

I can honestly say now that no, I didn't waste my money. What Gun Sword lacks in originality it makes up with everything else. The animation is smooth and unique, the action is solid and frequent, the comedy is enough to chuckle at, and the Americanized version was surprisingly well-done, with a wide-screen format and great voice-acting. Plus, the collector's box is beautiful and comes with a key-chain.

As for the story, it follows a tuxedo-sporting vagabond named Van (pronounced Vaughn) as he searches for a mysterious, clawed figure across the wasteland. With him is his belt, which he can manipulate into a sword at will; and always hovering in space above is his ""Armor"", a mech used for fighting other Armors. Eventually, he picks up a companion named Wendy, who is also searching for someone, but unlike Van she's highly inexperienced and carries with her a gun with only one bullet. Most of the episodes in this volume are your basic introductory ones, showcasing what is to be expected from Gun Sword in the future while introducing us to the main characters and the world of Gun Sword. By the end of this volume, though, it delves a little into the overall plot of the story, which should pick up again in the next volume.

Needless to say, if you liked Cowboy Bebop, Trigun, or are enjoying Eureka Seven right now, then this would be a great anime for you. Sure, it isn't the most original, but it definitely brings a lot to the table, enough to give it a little separation between it's two primary predecessors.",1148515200,4,2098,4.515789473684211
