8597508,4,B00DT6RIB6,"This satirical, funny, but also rueful PBS film looks at teenage life in middle America in the 1950s and is well adapted by humorist Jean Shepherd from his own writings.  Really a series of episodes, without much of a plot, but lovely details, and pretty strong acting all around. The adults seem a touch exaggerated and the teens a touch underplayed in a way that makes me think the intent is to look at the adult world through the slight distortion of teenage eyes.

For me, this was stronger than the PBS produced follow up six years later The Great 4th of July and Other Disasters.  While that had a bit more wacky fun, this had more hard, and tartness to go with the sweet.",1448496000,,678,4.408

8597512,5,B00DT6RIB6,"I bought this at my husband's request. I enjoy parts of it, like the gravy boats and the whole prize lamp business. My husband loves the whole film. When it first arrived, he was recovering from heart valve replacement surgery, and he found himself unable to watch the film. He kept laughing too much, and his chest couldn't handle it. Now that he is recovering, he is watching this even as I type. It's very nice to find a way to make an invalid feel better. [smile]",1403740800,5,467,4.379310344827586
8597513,5,B00DT6RIB6,"While not as funny as ""A Christmas Story,"" it's still awfull good and deserves a full-blown DVD and Blu-ray treatment.  This particular copy is a little rought around the edges, like an old VCR tape before those got good.  The cast is all good and the narration by Shepherd himself is exactly right.

The copy was send promptly and even included a bonus.

Big-time DVD publisher, are you listening?",1395446400,2,398,4.72463768115942
