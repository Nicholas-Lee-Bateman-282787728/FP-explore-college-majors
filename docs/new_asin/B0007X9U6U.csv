8053158,1,B0007X9U6U,"This video production by writer Mark Zwonitzer starts out with a bias against the raped woman and then proceeds like a piece of indoctrination propaganda to try to drive its presumptions and unsubstantiated assumptions into the viewer. On the other hand, I just finished reading Admiral Stirling's version of these same events from his autobiography, all of which should have been included in any PBS program for proper balance. (None of the ""historians"" in this American Experience production offer any opposing view, which is flatly unacceptable in anything masquerading as a history documentary.) The admiral points out in his book that Mrs. Massie's jaw was broken in two places, according to the examining physician. That does not seem like a ""lie"" to me. The accused, whom she identified, was a big burly and popular Hawaiian football player who later confessed to the crime. Both he and several of the other males had previous violent sexual and robbery offenses on their records, which is also not mentioned in this film.  An additional fact that substantiates the guilt of the accused group -- but which is not mentioned in this American Experience video -- is that AFTER the trial a group of sailors who had been AWOL (and thus afraid to identify themselves) came forward as eyewitnesses who had seen the rapists' car at the exact location where the attack occurred.

I believe the admiral, Mrs. Massie, the eyewitnesses, and the courts of the time. Not PBS or the American Experience crew in this biased production.",1523923200,,1526,5.003937007874016
8053159,4,B0007X9U6U,I've been on a streak of good documentaries lately and this one is no exception.  The story is fascinating and a time capsule for the racist thinking during that time period in Hawaii.  The documentary is definitely slanted against Mrs. Massie who was clearly physically assaulted by someone that night though probably not the people she accused of assaulting her.  Just riveting.,1447545600,2,380,5.096774193548387
8053160,3,B0007X9U6U,"This is a very interesting story, and the video is well put together.

However, the recounting of the events is strongly slanted against the Massie's and comes close to contradicting established facts namely, Thalia Massie was abducted by car, her jaw was broken, and she was raped.  Either the PBS researchers failed to interview living relatives of Thalia Massie who actually knew her, or they ignored their account.

8053161,4,B0007X9U6U,"This film is important for everyone to view because it brings to light a true story of extreme prejudice and pathologic behavior in Hawaii in the early '30's.  The murder of one Hawaiian young man is covered up and the lives of several others are ruined by lies supported by the American Navy stationed there.  The distrust and hate toward the native people is based completely on skin color.  This story is an eye opener, albeit a sad awakening.",1345075200,3,446,4.620253164556962
8053162,5,B0007X9U6U,"We often hear of ""getting away with murder"" and these folks actually did it!  An amazing true story of murder in Honolulu and how the ""connected"" family got away with murdering an ""ethnic"" and completely innocent young man after a ""wandering"" wife told lies to save her marriage.",1285372800,,279,4.8125
8053163,5,B0007X9U6U,"This documentary is an excellent primer to the events and racism and social climate of Hawai'i in the 1930s that led to the attempted railroading of five young men in both the court of public opinion and the court of law.  The filmmakers set the stage well, hitting all the broad strokes of the case and the particulars of the time.  It tells the story of a young, innocent Hawaiian man whose life was taken away...in the name of vengeance...for a crime he didn't commit.  The film contains amazing archival footage from the period, including footage of the Massies who murdered Joe Kahahawai and got away with it, and builds a precise snapshot of the times.

While this documentary is a great start in learning about this case, the length of the piece prohibited the filmmakers for providing the amount of detail that is known about this case:  all the machinizations, the lies and the truths about what happened and how.

If you want to know even more than this documentary is able to provide, check out David Stannard's exceptional non-fiction work ""Honor Killing.""  If the documentary makes your mouth gape at the injustice done in this case, Stannard's book will make your jaw hit the floor.",1244678400,2,1196,4.748792270531401
8053164,4,B0007X9U6U,"Fascinating, well told account of what happens when race trumps all. Those interviewed are generally very insightful, with the exception of Haunani-Kay Trask, who makes sweeping generalizations that detract from the impartiality. My thoughts keep returning to this injustice three days after I watched it on PBS.

If only we weren't doomed to make the same mistakes and could have learned from history, maybe reason would have prevailed over emotion before three more young men's lives were ruined in North Carolina. The parallels are spooky!",1179964800,,542,5.376470588235295
8053165,5,B0007X9U6U,"It's important for everyone to understand that our world is situated in history, politics and economy.  This film explains, in a heartbreaking way, why some sentiment still exists in Hawaii that is considerd anti-haole.

Viewers are given an overview of Hawaii in the 1930's, as well as before it was annexed and became a U.S. territory.  This lays the foundation for the event described, and provides an explanation as to how events played out as they did.

To write further information or detail would be a disservice to the film and to the producers.  I would encourage anyone with an interest in history or social sciences to watch this.  You will be disturbed, and you will not be the same.",1127433600,6,695,4.75
8053166,4,B0007X9U6U,"This is quite an informative documentary film about what was perhaps the most unusual case ever defended by famed attorney Clarence Darrow, best known for the Scopes and Loeb-Leopold cases. It also offers a unique glimpse at the military's racism in 1930s Hawaii. All in all, it is a fine social document and an important piece of history.

8053167,5,B0007X9U6U,"I'm not surprised to hear this tragedy called the Massie Affair just like the Dreyfus Affair.  Both dealt with prejudice and biased court cases against oppressed men.  Here, a divorcing, mentally-unstable white woman accuses five Asian and Polynesian men of raping her.  Her relatives kill one of the Native Hawaiian men wrongfully accused.  Instead of condemning the killers, the majority of white Americans in HI and on the Mainland supported them.  In fact, supposed good-guy Clarence Darrow represented the murderers.

The documentary has a diverse array of experts speaking, including men and women, whites, Native Hawaiians, and multiracial persons.  Haunani Kay-Trask, the author of the outstanding ""Notes of a Native Daughter"" which even author Alice Walker praised, is interviewed her.  She looks older than I had expected.  It was interesting to see her speak about history, rather than current cultural criticism.

I thank PBS for making this documentary.  When they arranged the ""American Experience"" series, it appears that they wanted to show the awful, as well as the noble, aspects of American history.  This documentary shows that non-black men of color have been lynched in this country just as black men have.  This series do not just posit slavery and Japanese interment as the only scars in American history; this country has many blemishes.

No fault to the producers, but this documentary was incredibly difficult to watch.  Emmett Till's body was recently exhumed for forensic evidence.  These two facts point to how many men of color have died at the hands of majority Americans defending notions of ""white womanhood.""  Mrs. Fortescue reminds me of Ruth DeWitt Bukater, the elitist, redheaded mother in the ""Titanic"" film.  The facts here are very much like the 1994 tragedy where a Caucasian woman named Susan Smith drowned her two sons and lied that a Black man had done it.

This was an important work discussing Hawaiian history.  My heart goes out to the Native brothers over there.  This was powerful, though incredibly disturbing.",1118361600,11,2062,5.206686930091186
