8346547,5,B001VKSPLY,"Simon Boccanegra will never be one of Verdi's most popular operas, lacking, as it does, a plot driven by the typical soprano-tenor romances of La Traviata and Il Trovatore or the memorable arias of Rigoletto -- the three big operas of the 1850s that preceded Boccanegra's premiere in 1857. Not merely revised but practically recomposed in 1881, incorporating the now-famous Council Scene, Boccanegra has greater appeal perhaps to discerning aficionados who can appreciate the darker hues of its leading baritone and bass roles and the palette of Verdi's later, more advanced orchestration.

Despite not being one of Verdi's frequently performed operas, Boccanegra has nevertheless been well served in recordings, dating back to RCA's 1973 LP set conducted by Gianandrea Gavazzeni and Claudio Abbado's 1977 Deutsche Grammophon issue, which brought Boccanegra to a wider audience than ever before. The video era followed with magnificent stagings, notably the Met's 1995 production conducted by James Levine&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Verdi-Simon-Boccanegra-Levine-Te-Kanawa-Metropolitan-Opera/dp/B000068UXH/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Verdi - Simon Boccanegra / Levine, Te Kanawa, Metropolitan Opera</a>&nbsp;with Vladimir Chernov, Robert Lloyd, Kiri Te Kanawa, and tenor Placido Domingo, which remained the reference DVD into the 21st century.

This 2007 Boccanegra from Bologna, starring Italian baritone Roberto Frontali, was the first to appear on Blu-ray and seems to have gone unnoticed, maybe because the other members of the cast are not household names. Unfortunate, as this is an excellent Boccanegra.

Frontali, 50 when this was filmed, is a widely experienced Verdi baritone. Like the corsair he portrays, he looks robust, sings with vigor as well as nuance, and acts effectively. A reviewer of the DVD issue complains that in his Act I duet with Amelia, Frontali fails to scale down the dynamics on the high A of his closing ""O figlia"" to piano as Verdi has written at the end of this touching father-daughter recognition. Perhaps the sound on the DVD is not as good as the Blu-ray's because I hear Frontali's diminuendo just fine.

In the Council Scene, Frontali is duly majestic and convincing in the Act III reconciliation with his archenemy Fiesco. One of Frontali's shining moments comes near the end, as Boccanegra is dying and says, ""I want to breathe the blissful air of the open sky."" The backdrop rises to reveal a gentle, light blue seaside, and Frontali sings, ""Oh, relief! The breeze of the sea! The sea, the sea,"" establishing a sense not of gloom and doom but of welcome peace. In the ensuing death scene, Frontali doesn't stoop to melodrama, and as he expires, a radiant smile lights up his face, creating a cathartic release. It's a striking portrayal.

As Fiesco, Italian bass Giacomo Prestia delivers a solid performance throughout. As in his depiction of Philip in the Tutto Verdi Don Carlo&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Don-Carlo-Blu-ray/dp/B0094AH3DE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Don Carlo [Blu-ray</a>] from Modena, Prestia approaches the heights of Ferruccio Furlanetto in this role&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Verdi-Simon-Boccanegra/dp/B0043GN6XU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Verdi: Simon Boccanegra</a>, which is no small compliment. A real and pleasant surprise is thirtysomething Italian baritone Marco Vratogna, who is the best Paolo I've seen or heard. His dynamic acting and singing give Bologna's show extra value.

In the roles of the two lovers, Carmen Giannattasio is a beautiful, voluptuous Amelia who sings gorgeously. In the lesser tenor role, Giuseppe Gipali is adequate. Michele Mariotti, only 28 in 2007, is an alert conductor who renders Verdi's masterful orchestration wonderfully. The stage set, designed by director Giorgio Gallione, is abstract and minimal, but functional rather than distracting. In fact, Gallione's set serves so well that Parma picked it up in 2010 for its Boccanegra in the Tutto Verdi package.

Comparisons with that later version are instructive in revealing the strengths of the Bologna performance. Both use period-appropriate costumes, but under a different stage director, the Parma production&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Simon-Boccanegra-Blu-ray/dp/B0094AH34S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Simon Boccanegra [Blu-ray</a>] looks more like a rehearsal. The lighting is weak, the orchestra isn't conducted so well, the chorus in the mob scene mills aimlessly. Leo Nucci seems taxed in the lead role. (Unlike Frontali, he doesn't drop the dynamics on ""O, figlia"" to piano at the close.) When the Parma backdrop is raised to reveal the sea, it's black -- not the light blue as it is in Bologna. Nucci staggers around rather pathetically as he's failing and dies with his mouth gaping in despair, rather than with Frontali's radiant smile. Frontali succeeds in making Boccanegra's death uplifting; Nucci's is a downer.

Arthaus Musik's Blu-ray image is knife-edge sharp, the sound full and flawless. It's the best Boccanegra on Blu-ray and merits a strong recommendation, along with the 2010 Royal Opera House DVD set&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Verdi-Simon-Boccanegra/dp/B0043GN6XU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Verdi: Simon Boccanegra</a>&nbsp;with Domingo, Furlanetto, Marina Poplavskaya, and Joseph Calleja.",1422835200,8,5513,6.141374837872893
8346548,5,B001VKSPLY,"Being an avid Ricciarelli fan for years, this Simon Boccanegra proves the role of Maria Grimaldi as sung by Katia Ricciarelli, could have been written for her! And with her touching way of phrasing, (even with all her so called ""flaws and liberties"",) she still sounds angelic to my ears!  I was blown away with her performance!  Vocally, she was at her very best and with the rest of the cast, this is something to be remembered.  Bo Biffa",1422748800,,440,4.544303797468355
8346549,1,B001VKSPLY,"Even if everything positive the other reviewer says about the Tokyo Boccanegra recently released is true, and even if everything negative he says is untrue; even if you like one of the two MET versions that have been released (one with Milnes, the other I think with Chernov); and even if the moon is made of green cheese, the fact remains that the La Scala production, live in the Scala house in 1979, must be the greatest performance of this opera ever preserved in video, and perhaps the greatest of any such opera, although that would be an extravagant claim, and one of the best is probably enough, and more consistent with the appropriate rules of etiquette and objectivity concerning opera criticism. The cast consisted of Freni, Luchetti, Cappuccilli, Ghiaurov, and, to boot, a fabulous Paolo whose name I think is Felice Schiave, but I would have to check to be sure.  The conductor is the great Claudio Abbado, the director Giorgio Strehler, the host Ashley Putnam.  The performance is one of the greatest combined ensemble and solo outings I have ever seen, live or on video.  The Scala orchestra and chorus are also magnificent.  This is a very beautiful but rather dark work, presumably not the most popular, but there are several inferior DVDs available.  The Scala performance has been available in pirate form for years, and I think if I were to die tomorrow, I'd want to first view it for the umpteenth time.  I cannot imagine why Scala or someone licensed by Scala does not bring this one out.  I believe it was available on Scala VHS a long time ago and is in Amazon's catalogue as not available.  True, they would have to add subtitles; so what?  What possible contractual issues could be insurmountable?  Is it Abbado who is keeping this treasure from us this because of his later video?  If so, for shame.  Is the original source unavailable?  If so, there must be lots of people who taped it off of TV; some of the pirate versions are themselves of reasonably high audio and video quality; and there may be better ones out there too.  (There is also a pirate with almost the same cast on Scala tour in Paris, or Barcelona, or wherever, that is not as good as the Milan performance.)  The acting throughout the Milan performance is riveting.  Cappuccilli's soft singing and his subtle acting as Boccanegra are achingly beautiful, and helped confirm or establish him as something other than a loud and forceful de Luna, Forza Don Carlo, and even an excellent Iago, which he was.  There is a spectacular moment when he projects several phrases with his back completely toward the audience.  The role of Amelia may well have been too heavy for Freni, but she gives of her all and achieves admirable results.  The audience loved her. The Gabriele Adorno of Veriano Luchetti is passionate, sincere, and gut wrenching in every way, and it is an outrage that on Abbado's DGG audio recording -- itself a great one -- Luchetti is replaced by Jose Carreras, presumably to enhance commercial appeal. Carreras is fine on that studio audio recording, as far as that goes, but Luchetti's performance in the theatre is at an entirely different level of intensity.  It is understandable why Luchetti was not one of the three tenors, but all the more reason to make available this document of one of his best performances.  Ghaurov is, of course, magnificently mellifluous.  I could go on and on.  (I already have.)  There is also on the market a commercial DVD conducted by Claudio Abbado years after the Milan performance, but it is, in my view, inferior in every way. Is there anyone out there who can get to whoever has the rights to the 1979 Scala Milan televised performance I have been discussing  and persuade them to make that performance available?  If that can be done, then the next one to work on is the Scala Macbeth with Verrett, Cappuccilli, Ghiaurov, and I think Luchetti as Macduff, also conducted by C. Abbado, and also available in a DGG studio recording (with Domingo rather than Luchetti as Macduff).  That Macbeth -- also available in pirate form -- includes a spectacular performance by the force of nature known as Shirley Verrett.  I'd bet that if you asked her, she would like that one to be released as well.  But first things first, CAN ANYONE DO SOMETHING TO GET US A HIGH QUALITY DVD REPRODUCTION OF THE 1979 SCALA BOCCANEGRA?",1253491200,10,4362,4.725231175693527
8346550,3,B001VKSPLY,"There is much good-to-great solo singing in this telecast of SIMON BOCCANEGRA taped in Tokyo on 26 September 1976, reported in the jacket blurb to have been Japan's first encounter with the work. For many, the names Piero Cappuccilli (Simon Boccanegra), Katia Ricciarelli (Amelia Grimaldi/Maria Boccanegra), and Nicolai Ghiaurov (Jacopo Fiesco), the date of 1976, and a cursory report that all three singers were in representative voice will be enough to justify the purchase. In the event, I am sorry to be able to make only a very qualified recommendation, for this latest entry in VAI's valuable DVD reissue series presents more obstacles to enjoyment than has been typical thus far.

Cappuccilli and Ghiaurov frequently were teamed on stage, in these roles and others, and each upholds his own standard here. From the baritone, there is, of course, that seemingly inexhaustible breath supply -- on a single breath, he manages passages most Boccanegras require two if not more to bring off, and the feat is never an end unto itself, for he puts his resources in the service of shaping long, beguiling legato lines. The emission is impeccably controlled; the tone, if not quite glamorous, at its handsome best. The Bulgarian bass Ghiaurov *did* have a glamorous voice, one of the most beautiful lower male ones to emerge since the Second World War, and he is in solid mid-career shape here, as fearsome in damnations as he is poignant in paternal grief, and summoning a burnished, enveloping warmth for such passages as the ""blessing"" duet with Gabriele Adorno (Act I) and the final reconciliation with Boccanegra. Only in the Prologue is Ghiaurov given full advantage of his own stage presence, however: the ""young"" Fiesco of ""Il lacerato spirito"" has such charisma and magnetism that the over-the-top phony aging to which the singer is submitted for the remainder of the opera (taking place 25 years later) is regrettable. It is topped off, literally, by a notably ratty and distracting white wig.

Katia Ricciarelli's performance is seductive and frustrating in equal measure. Her beautiful lyric soprano here is as yet unscuffed by her subsequent misadventures in dramatic territory (Aida, Turandot); she has an ingratiating way on stage, and she is an expressive vocal actress. She is also, on this night, either cavalier or lazy, if not both. I do not mean this simply in the most fastidious matters of dynamics and note value, but even at the basic level of singing all the notes Verdi wrote --at times she seems to rewrite for ease or comfort, or simply keeps her mouth shut (there is a conspicuous example of the latter in her contribution to the Act III quartet). In general Ricciarelli gives the impression of singing as she likes: half-voicing, sliding, coming in behind the beat, neglecting rhythmic points left and right, getting away with things a stricter conductor than Oliviero de Fabritiis would not have tolerated. In spite of all this, I cannot deny she makes a haunting effect, especially for those moments when she chooses really to sing out in her middle register. But a comparison with the similarly equipped Mirella Freni, the reigning  Amelia/Maria of her day (praise that seems too faint), is not flattering to Ricciarelli. Both women had attractive voices and both knew how to use their appealing personalities to get us on their side, but Freni consistently put more body in the tone and was the more diligent and attentive musician.

As Gabriele Adorno, Giorgio Merighi is, here, not only a poor actor but a plainly uncomfortable one. For example, with the Council Chamber's monumental ""peace"" concertato concluded, he adopts a sheepish mien and wanders away from Ricciarelli for no apparent reason, and then back. His singing is better, the voice of appropriate size and weight, only a trifle nasal in character, guided by good musical and stylistic sense. A couple of patches of uncertain intonation in Adorno's aria suggest that his throat was better than his ear, but he gives a good accounting of himself. Lorenzo Saccomani, a Tokyo Lirica Italiana regular (Valentin in FAUST and Silvio in PAGLIACCI), is an adequate Paolo, not encouraged by the production to do more than make the obvious points.

After his arresting work in a recently issued 1973 Tokyo AIDA (Santunione/Cossotto/Bergonzi -- see review of DVD), conductor Oliviero de Fabritiis is a disappointment. His is a very restrained and subdued reading, and while there are parts of the score where the approach pays dividends, ultimately we get less than the whole picture. Other conductors have given us more vital and mercurial BOCCANEGRAs with no sacrifice in lyricism or introspection. Too often, de Fabritiis is simply soft-edged, his foot always hovering over if not depressing the brake, and this combines with the responsible (though less than first-rate) work of the NHK Symphony Orchestra for an impression of tentativeness. The orchestra does uphold its end better than does the Union of Japan Professional Choruses, which reminds us all too well how important the choral work is in BOCCANEGRA, and how cruelly both Verdi's music *and* the Piave/Boito hybrid libretto can expose a weak or underrehearsed group. Much of the choral singing is vaguely coordinated and approximate in attack. Compounding this problem, the Japanese appear to have received minimal stage direction and look utterly lost when they must, for example, storm the Council Chamber in riot. It is chaos, yes, but not the kind one desires. (They also sport some of the silliest, most thrown-together-looking and inappropriate costumes I have ever seen in an opera DVD -- not patricians and plebeians so much as court jesters with a domino fetish. Throughout, while the main characters look conventionally presentable, the less important a role is, the more risible and desperate the clothing gets.)

Both sound (mono) and picture are at the low end of the scale for the VAI series, which has had its audio/video ups and downs. The image quality frequently is dark, and quality of focus varies. Longer shots are apt to be so blurred that detail passes for nothing, but these are apt to give way to a close-up or medium shot that is comparatively crisp. In short, it is all over the place. At least one unforgivable sin can be laid on the director of the original telecast: Boccanegra's final collapse, as he succumbs to the poison, is shown from such an angle that Cappuccilli is largely blocked from view (instead, we are looking at Ghiaurov's back). Sound is listenable but muddy, both for the period and for the specific DVD series of which this is part. The burned-in Japanese subtitles often continue appearing when the English ones have nothing to add, and the English ones have numerous awkward, tin-eared translations. The more recent of the two Met DVDs, with Vladimir Chernov in the title role, does a far better job of making eloquent English of BOCCANEGRA's dialogue. That Met DVD (on DG), itself flawed in some ways, remains my first choice for a BOCCANEGRA in the home. The Japanese performance, which on paper looked as though it could sweep the board, is best acquired as a supplement, its principal lure being the opportunity to see Cappuccilli and Ghiaurov in roles with which they were closely associated and for which they are warmly remembered.",1240099200,18,7342,5.0337171052631575
