8067621,5,B0009VT6S2,"These are two nice films with the bonus of some singing on the film 'The New Adventures of Heidi'.  This film has nothing inappropriate for young children, although the 'Wild Man' is a bit scary, and you never find out who he is till near the end. He never talks for a long time, and when he does it is in rather scary sounding screeches. I especially enjoyed the songs 'On the Mountain', 'Please Let Me Stay', and 'Sometimes the Simple Things are the Better Things'. Heidi and Elizabeth do several duets together, and, although their voices are very different, still sound sweet. The two songs 'That Man', and 'Women!"" were funny, but not extremely edifying.

I was impressed how closely the Heidi in 'The New Adventures of Heidi' closely resembled the Heidi in 'Heidi' played by Maximian Schell, which was the second film on this DVD. I'm not sure if the resemblance was intentional or not. There are several touching sections throughout in that one as well, including the scene I liked best when Grandfather finally overcame the past and played his handmade organ again after so many years. This film does take a few minor deviations from the book, but stays true in the main points and the spirit, and does not finish like the awfully altered version starring Shirley Temple.

As far as quality, it's not bad although both films definitely look 'old'. Also, they seem rather pieced onto the disc. When the main screen ( 'Play movie' screen) comes up, there is simply a picture and no background music, and at the end of the film, it doesn't quite finish the last few seconds of the music before it jerks back to the silent main screen again. Not a big deal, but it doesn't seem quite professional. Overall, two nice films on one disc.",1430524800,,1738,4.636363636363637
