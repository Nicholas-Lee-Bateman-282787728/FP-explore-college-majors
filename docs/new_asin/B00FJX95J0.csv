8616173,2,B00FJX95J0,"Switchblade DVD authoring have recently released a pair of Japanese 'women in prison'  flix - the second of which is entitled ""Hellcage-Inmate 611- Part 2"".  One might imagine that this release has been timed to 'capitalize' on the popularity of the WIP genre that the cable TV show ""Orange Is The New Black"" has recently ignited in the general population - even though the 'original production date' for ""Hellcage"" is listed as 2007 - pre-dating the Netflix produced feminine penal potboiler by a few years.

""Hellcage - Inmate 611 - Part 2""  sorta picks up where the first film in the series: ""Hellhole - Inmate 611"" left off - back in the all female prison with the same 5 cell-mates - but this 'episode' focuses on a different inmate - ironically NOT prisoner 611 (per the title), but rather the 'head girl' of the group ""Reika' ( inmate No. 44) - an 'X' girl gang member who is doing time for 'stimulant abuse' - the Japanese Penal Code euphemism for 'drugs'.

In a format similar to the first film - the plot jumps back and forth between events in the prison betwixt the girls & guards, and flash-backs that tell the back-story of how Reika ended up running afoul of the law (several times!) leading to her multiple incarcerations.  Also, sadly, similar to the first film, the lead actress never gets naked in any of the proceedings - that 'honor' is left to some of the secondary characters in the tale.  This part of the story has a few soft core sex scenes scattered throughout its brief (77 min) run-time - most of which occur during the out of prison flash-backs - there are actually no sex scenes in the prison!  Nor is there 'full' female nudity to be enjoyed (tho breasts put in the occasional appearance) - but also no annoying digital censorship (in either movie)- mostly because the skin/sex scenes are so low key.

Can't really recommend this (shot direct to video)  limp excursion into the WIP realm - true fans of the genre should perhaps look to the plethora of 'older' Japanese WIP offerings ( such as ""Female Prisoner Scorpion"" ) - many of which really did provide the 'perverse' action alluded to by the box-cover hype for 'Hellcage"" that it, unfortunately, did not truly deliver.",1407888000,2,2204,4.6426735218509
