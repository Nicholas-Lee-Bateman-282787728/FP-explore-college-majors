8139725,5,B000HGYXXC,Wonderful inspiring movie for all ages! Too bad that it is only half of existing 75 episodes out on DVDs,1409270400,,104,4.25
8139726,5,B000HGYXXC,"I stumbled across this anime/manga a while back and have liked it ever since.  The anime has proven to be as good as the manga, even if the voice acting could have been a bit better...  But I was really disappointed to find out Shonen Jump discontinued the DVDs after volume 11.  The least they could have done was make a limited edition of the complete set so the true fans could have a copy.  Despite how cheesy some people may think this story appears, it's actually quite an intelligent and intersting story and the characters all stand on their own really well.",1303344000,,566,4.466019417475728
8139727,5,B000HGYXXC,A must for all fans of the manga!  Why wasn't the rest of this series ever put on DVD?  Get all the disks while you can.,1265500800,,120,3.576923076923077
8139728,5,B000HGYXXC,"Who would have thought that a series about some kids playing Go would be so addicting?  Man . . . this one really caught me.  I'm not a big anime fan.  You know, big robots and big brests?  This is nothing like that.  There are no analogies I can draw on.  It isn't like anything else.  Just watch the first one and see if you aren't quickly pining away for number 7 to come out like I am.

Just to be honest, I have an incredible need to see the rest of this series and if you folks don't buy some of these disks, I may never see the end of the series!  That is unless I buy a region free player and learn Japanese.  So hurry up and watch number one!",1170633600,5,651,3.8636363636363638
