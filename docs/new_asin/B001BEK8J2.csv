We saw them live and they were just as fun. I don't know why they aren't on anymore. Not even their cartoon could compare to the real thing.",1468195200,,276,4.036363636363636
8282936,3,B001BEK8J2,"My daughter loves the Doodlebops as I just think they are annoying. But you will do anything for your kids right? The Doodlebops have fun challenging Jazzmin to create rhymes for different words. But when Moe stumps her with finding a rhyme for the word ""orange,"" Jazzmin loses her rhyming skills altogether. The Doodlebops put their rhyming caps on and help Jazzmin out all day, until she manages to get her rhyme back by creating made-up words to rhyme with. She loves singing and dancing along to their songs and likes how silly Moe and Rooni are. She wants to buy more as this is not on any networks on TV.",1462579200,,610,4.504504504504505

8282938,5,B001BEK8J2,"Our daughter's daycare teacher introduce the kids to the Doodlebops. She loved it so much she started to ask for it at home. Unfortunately it was not available through any of the streaming services I use e.g. Amazon, Netflix. I ordered three of these Doodlebops DVD's from Amazon. Based on how often she asks to watch them I think we have a winner!

Parent note: I was unfamiliar with the Doodlebops. Apparently they were available in the US on the Disney Channel at one time but no longer. The content is toddler friendly with lots of lively music. This is not an animated show. The characters are brightly costumed, energetic humans! The three I purchased are below. They are all similar, at least from an adult perspective!

8282941,5,B001BEK8J2,"If you were bummed that you couldn't watch the Doodlebops on TV anymore, you'll love this.  Each episode features the ""newer"" Doodlebops.  It seems like a lot of DVD's have the newer characters on the front but upon further inspection the back shows the older characters.  This is just what we wanted and my two little ones enjoy watching the DVD.",1320451200,,347,4.655737704918033
