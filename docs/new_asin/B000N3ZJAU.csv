8174648,5,B000N3ZJAU,"Raiders of the Lost Ark, 1981 film

This was the most popular film in the summer of 1981, and played to packed audiences. It must have resonated with peoples emotions as an action film unlike many others. It starts with an adventure  an explorer travels to a savage society in order to steal their wealth (for scientific knowledge of course). He fails when another adventurer expropriates his winnings, but survives to return to his teaching job at a university. The film shows him traveling in a flying Clipper from the 1930s, but not on a railroad (passenger trains are now obsolete).

It is a good action film, as long as you don't question some of the scenes. Could Nazi Germany have military forces in 1936 Egypt? Could German Schmeisser sub machine guns be found in 1936 Nepal? I don't believe so. I suspect these scenes were copied from the 1940 serials that entertained moviegoers. Indiana Jones will entertain you as an action adventure story with a multitude of cliches from long forgotten films. Sliding under the truck recalls Yakima Canutes famous stunt. Some scenes seem far fetched to me (when you think about it). Could Indiana Jones on a horse overtake a convoy of trucks? The theme music came from the 1948 film Don Juan starring Errol Flynn (rarely seen on TV). The chase through the maze of streets reminds me of 1940 cartoons. Other scenes may be derived from other old movies (the truck knocking down scaffolding from Abbot & Costello Meet the Keystone Kops). A few sequels were made, but it failed to be translated into a television series. Just like Jaws. The ending scene reminded me of the movie Kiss Me, Deadly.",1451865600,,1638,4.7403508771929825
