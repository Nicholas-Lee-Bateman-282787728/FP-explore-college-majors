7754710,3,B01G4N5Q0A,"Theatrical review.  While watching the various trailers for this Steven Spielberg film leading up to its summer release, one is led to believe this is the next E. T.  Well Ive seen E. T. and I will tell you that this is no E. T.  What it is however is a big, beautifully looking movie with some really big characters.  One who isn't however is Sophie (Ruby Barnhill), an orphan of about 12, who has trouble sleeping.  One night while walking about the orphanage shes taken by a giant, who is known as the Big Friendly Giant (Mark Rylance, Bridge of Spies).  Hes only interested in capturing her dreams, but still won't let her return to her home, as it were.

While BFG is indeed very big, hes a runt compared to the other dozen or so companions.  He also has a friendly temperament and is a vegetarian unlike his buddies who prefer to eat human beans.  Essentially the movie is about BFG keeping Sophie hidden from his hungry friends.  The final act has the duo appealing to the Queen, who looks like Elizabeth complete with matching Corgis.  They want the rest of the giants isolated so they stop kidnapping children and well eating them, I guess.  This darker side of the story is suppressed.

Surprisingly, this British Queen has the authority of the Prime Minister to call the military to action.  Who knew?  Evidently not Spielberg, the screenwriter, Melissa Mathison or Roald Dahl, the books author.  I saw this movie with a theater nearly full of kids from about 4 to 10 and surprisingly they were all pretty quiet.  Thats usually a good sign for a movie targeted at kids.  Or maybe they were dozing off like me.  The film looks good.  Barnhill and Rylance are excellent, but the movie just isnt.  Sorry.",1467763200,4,1712,4.565789473684211
7754711,3,B01G4N5Q0A,"Once upon a time, a seven-year-old boy dedicated his free time to one thing and one thing only: fairy tales. He would make his family reenact his favorite stories, take his father to see low-budget musical productions of these stories, and even illustrate his own versions of Jack and the Beanstalk, The Three Little Pigs, Rapunzel, and so on and so forth. Coupled with the Disney classics, he simply could not get enough of these highly interpretive whimsical tales. Then came the third grade, when he read a little book called The BFG. As he read it, he had difficulty putting it down because of the wonderfully dim-witted yet big heart of the title character. Even to this day he still remembers how heavily it resonated with his love for fantasy.

Yes, I was that boy from the story. While this book has stayed in the back of my head for years, I never lost my love of fairy tales, particularly in what Disney can do with them. Then Steven Spielberg announced his upcoming project focused on the classic: very dumbfounding considering how he has long ago retired the captivating child fantasies for much more mature political studies. My admiration of Spielbergs heart for filmmaking did not affect my concern on how it would result; at the same time, I knew The BFG needed to scare us and make us smile at the same time, reminding us of the good in the world.

The Big Friendly Giant himself, portrayed through CGI magic by Mark Rylance, makes any true kid at heart fall in love with him. What he does is simple: he snatches children in the night at the witching hour, and takes them away into Giant Country. Its the only company he could ever find, as the other, much larger giants see him as an insult to giant peoples. During the day, he catches dreams found in a magical tree, sorts them into jars, and blows them into childrens heads at night. Much like the sandman or the tooth fairy or old Saint Nick, here is yet another entity for childrens nighttime fantasies. This elephant-eared giant may look evil at first as he hides his way through Londons streets, but after hearing his kindly, sluggish speech, you instantly feel a personal connection with him. Its just a shame that the film is anchored by an unbelievable relationship between the BFG and little Sophie.

Ruby Barnhill plays the orphan who stays up during the witching hour with the cat, and I could easily imagine any other actress in her shoes and playing the part possibly better. She isn't introduced with much detail, as she is carried away by the BFG too soon for a desire of following her journey to be initiated. It wasn't scary like it intended to feel, and nobody explained why the BFG chose her in particular to bring home. Maybe it explained in the book but I cant remember.

Even without the girl-giant bond, the environment creation makes up for the entertainment. Composer John Williams does it again with his spellbinding sounds of sweet dreams, and production designer Rick Carter (Lincoln, Jurassic Park) recreates the large color of dreams with an upside-down tree shrouded with all the glowing sprites of dreams. Together, they create a spectacular light-show of northern lights, dripping leaves, and sprite chasing like weve all felt at some point way back when. If only the creative geniuses went back to old-school special effects without all the obtrusive CGI, then these moments would have felt all the more nostalgic for the generations beyond the millennials.

If you ask me, the features third act officially lost me in its imagination and realism. Basically, Sophie sets a plan with the BFG to get rid of the other giants by sending a nightmare into the head of the queen. So they together successfully make it past the guards and get the nightmare into the queens head, following with a scene so atrocious in direction that I am ashamed to place it along with the rest of the movie. Penelope Wilton, the actress portraying the queen of England, put no effort at all into her part, and the entire direction of the scene felt purely uncomfortable and out of place. At least it follows with an amusing if overlong sequence where the queen gladly welcomes the BFG by treating him to a huge breakfast, with a pitchfork and sword substituting for a fork and knife. Thinking back to Spielbergs history of portraying the political system on screen, I expect him to have done more with this historically relevant scenario to make things flow better. Alas, we just cant have the best of both.

It disheartens me a bit to say that not enough was done with this whimsical fairy tale. The so what factor falls short compared to simple tales such as Goldilocks and the Three Bears or Pinocchio. But judging by the first two-thirds, the childhood escapism successfully triumphs. It teaches little ones the reward of being a good giant besides a greedy giant, and reminds older readers of these stories timelessness over hundreds of years. Even today, we still can put ourselves in Little Reds place as she falls deceptive to the wolfs lies. We still see rags-to-riches stories similar to Cinderellas. I would love to see us all to start reading these old tales more frequently, including discussion on how a particularly story spoke to us individually. If we learn not to be afraid of the observant wandering child within us all, then we too can become little friendly people who can live happily ever after.

7754712,5,B01G4N5Q0A,"This is the first movie I have ever reviewed here. As a senior organizational leader, Ph. D. student in psychology, and the father of young children, I don't have much time to write for anything other than work and my dissertation. Yet, I feel compelled to write about this movie, which my children just saw with me in the theater. It's magical. I looked at the faces in the audience when the lights came up, and people were either smiling or they had tears in their eyes. Even as we left, the ushers were smiling as if they were saying non-verbally, ""Yes, I know!"" Of course, there will be some people that don't like the movie. That's okay, diverse thinking is among the things that make each of us uniquely valuable. Personally, I think the movie offers valuable life lessons related to the value of fantasy, fun, enduring friendships, and well-placed kindness. I recommend it.",1467676800,6,880,4.683870967741935

7754757,3,B01G4N5Q0A,"This Disney adaption of The BFG, a 1982 childrens book by Roald Dahl, might have been big fun if director Steven Spielberg had taken more liberties with the plot. The first few mintues, in which a giant old man snatches a little orphan girl in the dead of night, are somewhat intriguing, but the story doesnt really go anywhere interesting from there. The dream catching bit is silly and the Giants bombastic lingo is annoying, though scenes in which he hides her from Giant Country villians offer playful suspense.

Its slow the plot isn't engaging and there's a few scenes where you can tell whats going on and why you're supposed to enjoy it, but its boring.  Maybe certain parts of it are played too serious.  I mean its supposed to be a fun movie but then there's all the sad parts about lost and eaten children that send a tonal rift down the middle of it so you can't tell what the whole movie is going for.

One heart stabbing thing that wasn't Disney's fault struck me very hard.  At the beginning of the film there is a shot of Westminster bridge, a much filmed spot.  It is also the spot where a Jihadi murdered and injured a number of people just a short time ago.  We live in sad times.",1495843200,,639,4.418803418803419

7754896,5,B01G4N5Q0A,"This is a Disney movie, and so expected to be family fare and specially for children - and it is, of course!
But I feel that most ""kids of all ages"" would be impressed, entertained and just plain delighted with this film.

Watch it more than once to appreciate the attention to detail and the grace in development from start to a finish that is actually a beginning.
""Good morning, BFG"" .

The first sentence aims right at the audience as individuals and draws them into the story. In a few moments the personality of our heroine, Sophie, is presented artfully and the fun begins, when she catches a glimpse of the BFG, who must, therefore, take her along with him, so as not to reveal his existence.

The two become friends and partners and very fond of one another, in spite of the obvious differences in nature and nurture and learn of a world-threat that must be mended and only they can do it.

The imagination if fed with portions of the story that are easy , moderate and fantastic in the original story from the famous children's author Raould Dahl , and the film seems truly devoted to adding ""just one more thing - and then another "" , all along ,  one more sparkle that would make the story worthy and delightful !

My problem?  I am not a fan of sequels, but now that we are in love with the characters, may we have some?  The Possible  story lines are infinite !

Thank you so much, to all who made this film the wonder it is - charmed - just charmed!

7754912,1,B01G4N5Q0A,Disappointed that the American (Spielberg) who made this movie felt the need to change the British story and make the BFG lash out in anger at the other giants. Is it really not possible for American audiences to like a character who is getting victimized by bullies? Is it really necessary to show him lashing out in rage before we identify with the character? The whole theme of retribution & revenge through intelligent patience was dismissed. The very British lesson that he who laughs last and laughs best isn't necessarily the one with the biggest stick was part of the reason I liked this story as a child.,1493510400,2,613,4.685185185185185

The technical aspects of the movie prove the technology is moving closer to realistic every few movies that come out.

7755213,4,B01G4N5Q0A,"Years ago I remember reading Roald Dahl's ""The BFG,"" and thinking that it deserved a film adaptation much like others of Dahl's works (""Matilda,"" ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory,"" ""James and the Giant Peach,"" ""The Witches,"" etc.).  It took nearly two decades for my dreams to become a reality, and in that time I grew a little more cynical.  Could a fairly big-budgeted film capture the whimsy and magic of Dahl's writing, without turning it into a mindless blockbuster?  And given that few movies adapted from books live up to their high expectations -- and the fact that despite being a Spielberg effort, this movie underperformed in theaters -- I went into it with more than a little trepidation.

I needn't have worried.  While ""The BFG"" has its differences from the book and has its flaws, it's still an enchanting experience, a more laid-back family film that's sorely needed in a world where movies think they have to constantly wow their audiences to hold their attention.

""The BFG"" follows an orphan named Sophie, who virtually runs the orphanage she calls home in lieu of the incompetent headmistress.  One night, while looking out the window, she spots an enormous figure in the streets of London... who promptly kidnaps her and whisks her off to Giant Country.  Lucky for her, she's been snatched by the one giant who doesn't eat humans -- the Big Friendly Giant, or BFG, who despises his brothers' murderous and cruel ways and, instead of eating children, captures and brings them dreams.  Sophie finds herself befriending the giant, and hatches a plan with him to stop the other giants once and for all.  Her plan will involve stealth, a diabolical nightmare bottled by the BFG, and even the Queen of England, and the fates of all the children in the world will depend on its success...

The visual effects for this film are stunning.  The CGI is well-integrated with the live-action elements, and is realistic without falling into the trap of the Uncanny Valley.  I had wondered how the movie was going to handle the catching, mixing, and bottling of dreams that's central to the plot, and I found it did remarkably well.  Oddly enough, the one scene where the special effects fail is one involving the Queen's corgis -- it's rather blindingly obvious when they swap out the real dogs for CGI copies...

The story stays mostly true to the original book, which I appreciated.  There are a few departures, such as hints that the giant had kidnapped another human child before Sophie, and some tweaking of the ending that bothered me just a little.  Most of the changes are for the better, however, and except for the slight alteration of the ending, didn't detract from the story.  I won't spoil the ending, but suffice it to say that it's a little more realistic than the original, but still a bit unsatisfying.

As for the acting... everyone does remarkably well, even accounting for the fact that they're interacting with a special effect.  I did find this new version of Sophie more grating than the original -- I don't remember the novel's version of Sophie being quite so snotty.  But the BFG's voice actor does a phenomenal job, and the rest of the human actors handle their roles with remarkable talent.

This film is a lot more laid-back and slower-paced than typical modern movie fare, and I think that accounts for much of its failure at the box office -- it's not a flashy, hyperactive action flick, nor a constantly busy children's comedy, and so I think modern audiences used to constant action from a movie don't know what to make of it.  (The fact that Disney didn't promote it much AND released it right after ""Finding Dory"" didn't help either.)  But in a day and age where every film is intended to be a franchise and the art of gentle family films has been largely lost, it's nice to see Spielberg returning to such a family film.  ""The BFG,"" while not perfect, is a whimsical experience, and a great family film.",1485820800,,3949,4.738304093567251

7755341,3,B01G4N5Q0A,"The BFG(released May/16)stars,among others, Mark Rylance,Ruby Barnhill and Penelope Wilton. This is an uneven tale of the troubles which not beset ordinary humans but giants also.
The story finds a small girl snatched from an orphanage in the early morning hour of 3AM by a BFG(big friendly giant),when she spots him prowling the area from her balcony. Before she can get really used to her surroundings it turns out the BFG not only doesn't live by himself, but with bigger giants than himself. Being the runt he is constantly picked on. Things eventually come to a head when the girl persuades the BFG to go to the Queen for help. And help she does. She sends armed forces helicopters to the land of the giants to snatch all the bigger ones and put them on a small,desolate and barren island in the middle of no where. When she finally wakes up she is in a bed within Buckingham Palace,her life having changed forever. However she has learned that the BFG can still hear her whenever she wants to talk with him.
The story is immediately charming. The BFG has over sized ears and his language is less than perfect. He is bullied by bigger giants than himself(the human condition creeping in) but the world he lives in is a fascinating one. The area where he catches dreams is particularly so. Once his world is established the movie seems to slow and lose its energy. The script point as the girl and giant enlist the queens help,while at first neat,exacerbates this,which is unfortunate. Spielberg usually,though,manages a last minute come back and this film is no exception. The fade out with the BFG hearing the girl's""good morning""call is delightful to behold.
Technically the film is in its w/s a/r of 2:35:1 and is clear and crisp. Extras include two featurettes.
All in all a movie with charm that doesn't work over the long haul. Spielberg comes back with a boffo ending, but its not enough to offset what has come before.",1484870400,,1931,4.699115044247788

7755527,3,B01G4N5Q0A,"I didn't have high hopes for this movie because I loved the book so much, but I figured that I would give it a shot. The little girl is a bit annoying, but she helps move the story along. The BFG is actually animated quite pleasant-looking, so I was happy with that. I was disappointed with the bad giants, because they were not as scary as I thought that they should be - because they are supposed to be super mean and scary!! Overall, the show is cute, but I've seen it once, don't need to watch it again.",1483833600,,507,4.1313131313131315

7755558,2,B01G4N5Q0A,In our opinion it was not a patch on the original film.

The movie had so many alterations/ deviations from the book needlessly, it doesn't make sense, I tried to see the logic (like did they do this for time or difficulty in reproducing on film or what?) but couldn't find a good reason. I really can't stand when film companies make mediocre films from great books.",1483660800,,458,4.784810126582278

7755576,5,B01G4N5Q0A,Absolutely delightful!  I remember purchasing the book for my now 32 year old daughter twenty-two years ago.  She had all of the Roald Dahls books.  The movie is brilliant and has captured the attention of my 5 year old grandson (daughters son).  He has watched this movie so many times he has memorized some of the characters lines.  I love all of the characters.  Sophie is precious and the BFG is priceless!  What is there not to love about this movie!

7755588,4,B01G4N5Q0A,"I really liked this movie.  The animation, particularly the articulated movement of BFG's expressions and hands, was really well done.  I don't think I ever read the book, or read it to younger relatives, but still enjoyed the story.  There were a few farting jokes, but overall, this movie was far less crude than some other so-called family movies of recent years.

7755638,4,B01G4N5Q0A,"The kids and I really enjoyed the movie. I really liked special effects and graphics throughout the movie too.

The storyline doesn't make too much sense to me as you go through the movie. If the giant has come and gotten kids before and those kids have been hurt by the bigger giants, why would he put the kids in that danger again? That part doesn't make sense but obviously, that's not a question a kid would ask and our kids loved the mystical-ness of the movie.

It's one of the few that has kept the kids attention and I absolutely love the pure love that the giant has for the little girl. And I love the ending.",1483401600,,619,4.237288135593221

7755653,2,B01G4N5Q0A,"Kidnapping, captivity and ""Patty Hearst"" are what happened in this story.  Furthermore, the giant can barely communicate and yet has the job of affecting or effecting people's dreams.  More alarming is the kidnapper bringing the child into close proximity of bully cannibals.  Add explosive flatulation and we should think it is all cute?  Disturbing to me, most of the movie, especially because it is meant for children and families.  I upgraded to two stars for the impressive and effective computer graphics.",1483315200,,511,5.2592592592592595

7755697,3,B01G4N5Q0A,"My grandsons (12 and 14 1/2) and I watched this last night.  I know that the earlier version is significantly shorter and I would love to know what Spielberg added because I think that the shorter version might be more enjoyable.  The younger grandson gave it a much higher rating of 4; the older one  gave it a 2.  I gave it a 3 as I enjoyed the dialogue and some of the action, but some was just plain inexplicable.  Also, I thought that a lot of the special effects were just weird and not particularly of interest.  We liked the scene with the Queen (not sure whether that was in the original book, or first movie as I forgot to ask the boys) although I noted that her trait of carrying a black purse on the left arm was only intimated by carrying a beige one on the right arm.  I was cooking supper so missed a few spots but  I wouldn't bother to watch it again to ""catch up,"" and I don't think that the boys will watch it again either.  What is the difference between the theatrical and other versions?  I didn't see any explanation but perhaps I didn't read the descriptions with enough care.",1483142400,,1099,4.240384615384615
7755698,5,B01G4N5Q0A,"I was so happy when a live action version came out (the cartoon was not good) of this book. I love Roald Dahl and the BFG was one of my favorites of his. The animation is stunning and the BFG has a great presence in mannerisms and speech. I have not read the book for awhile so I didn't notice any inconsistencies though I am sure there are plenty. However, the movie is extremely enjoyable, touching, and stunning visually. Definitely recommend.",1483142400,,446,4.518518518518518

It has been far too long since someone produced work that you must have to see. The magic, dialogue, every second of this movie is created in ways that have not been seen in decades. I do not exaggerate. Please give yourself a wonderful opportunity to be amazed with the intelligence that shines through every second of this movie. It has been long overdue to have someone give us this surprise. I could write a book in itself to describe the respect, gratitude, delight, and wonderment how at long last we have life presented for us that gives one an opportunity to receive so much enjoyment. At first when the title was shown I too thought ""now what another piece of something one would think that title is saying""  Please please say yes and hurry to get this work. If it were possible I would send one to everybody I know so I may share sheer delight with them. I will never tire of watching this movie and thank goodness I have it available to watch especially when I am recovering from the negative experience that life can bring. Oh how I hope there are more in the making. Thank you Mr. S. for giving me delight that I have not had in far too many years., Yes many excellent stories have been told however this will always be #one for me. A quick note to say Blue Ray will enhance the enjoyment. Thank you a zillion times for brightening my time. P.J.Tofay",1482883200,,1478,4.335740072202166

7755776,4,B01G4N5Q0A,"""The BFG"" is pretty good. This is how the story goes: A girl named Sophie encounters the Big Friendly Giant who, despite his intimidating appearance, turns out to be a kind-hearted soul who is considered an outcast by the other giants because, unlike them, he refuses to eat children.

The cast led by Mark Rylance (solid as usual as BFG) & Ruby Barnhill (in a solid debut-making performance as Sophie) is pretty good. The directing by Steven Spielberg (who also produced) is pretty good. The screenplay (based on Roald Dahl's novel) by Melissa Matheson (who also associate produced) is pretty good.

The music by John Williams is pretty good. The cinematography by Janusz Kaminski is pretty good. The film editing by Michael Kahn is pretty good. The production design by Rick Carter & Robert Stromberg is pretty good. The art direction by Chris Beach, Todd Cherniawsky, Margot Ready & Grant Van Der Slagt is pretty good. The set decoration by Elizabeth Wilcox, set designs by Kris Bergthorson, Nancy Anna Brown, Aric Cheng & Callum Webster and set dressings by Cody Larson is pretty good. The costume design by Joanna Johnston is pretty good. The make-up design by Lois Burwell is pretty good. The special effects supervised by Joel Whist & coordinated by Adam Heinis is pretty good. The visual effects supervised by Joe Letteri, Mark Gee, Brian Goodwin, Ken McGaugh, Mike F. Hedayati, Alexander Nowotny & Kevin Andrew Smith and coordinated by Kimberly Aller, Chloe Feodoroff, Cale Hetariki, Jana Jungk, Caroline MacLeod, Drew Nielsen, Margaux Peach & Georgina Selby is pretty good. The stunts coordinated by Marny Eng is pretty good.

This is a pretty good and solidly entertaining family film that is well-done and well-made. Steven Spielberg has made another solid family film to his resume. Mark Rylance is solid as usual as BFG & Ruby Barnhill is solid as well in her debut-making performance as Sophie. This is one of the better movies of this year (also one of the better family movies as well, too) and also was one of the better summer films that came out as well, too.",1482796800,,2079,4.88385269121813
7755777,3,B01G4N5Q0A,"First, I haven't read the book and don't intend to. Besides, comparing a movie to how closely it follows a book seems totally irrelevant to me - it's good movie making or it isn't regardless of what the source material is. So is this good movie making? In sum, not so much, as the nice cgi don't make up for a rather dull story with a deadly flaw of having the main character, the Giant, that's not visually enticing.  I'm fairly sure most young kids would enjoy this movie (young being elementary school age and younger) but any older kids or preteens will find the movie dull (as verified by it's weak reception at the box office) as it doesn't measure up to their expectation of ""blockbuster"", mostly crap ""superhero"" movies being shoved down their throats by the studios. In a way sad but cuteness, unless it's cartoon animals, doesn't seem to connect well with audiences. These type of movies seems to be lost in a dead category (like Jack the Giant Slayer) that doesn't seem to appeals to a wide enough audience. Take away the fluff and cuteness and silliness and it's an empty movie, technically well made but still empty. Guess  it's like eating cotton candy.",1482710400,,1167,4.605769230769231

7755814,3,B01G4N5Q0A,"*** This review may contain spoilers ***

Let's start with the obvious. The BFG is a major disappointment on all fronts. The story doesn't hold interest and doesn't flow. The actors lack chemistry, and Ruby Barnhill is unfortunately a very poor casting choice. John Williams' score is bland, uninspiring and at times so obvious and overpowering that you just wish the music wasn't there at all. The CGI is occasionally brilliant, but mostly - mediocre. Not once did I see Sophie being carried in BFG's palm where it looked natural.

So the less obvious question is - why and where did it go so wrong. The answer is that the treatment is all wrong. The brilliance of Dahl's BFG is that it's a multi-layered, complex novel, hiding behind the facade of a children's book. It's full of subtleties and innuendos and satire. But most importantly, it juxtaposes good and evil, beautiful and ugly, horror and amazement. The good balances the bad. Without them both, the incredible concoction that is The BFG is just some bland chicken soup. Which is exactly what the movie is. Disney and Spielberg have stripped the evil from the story, leaving us with a meaningless and sentimental journey to nowhere. Here is one example of the impact of this treatment. In the book, the characters of maid Mary and the butler Mr. Tibbs serve as the comic relief. Sure, there is some class criticism and satire in their characters, but mostly they are there to add some long needed laughter after some frightening and tense moments. In the film these two are straight characters (romantically involved), with only a hint of comedy. And this makes sense, because in absence of the evil and the frightening, there is no need for a comic relief in the movie.

And so, we know the answer. The treatment of The BFG was totally wrong. It should have never been a Disney film. Nor a kids' film for that matter. The BFG is and should be treated as young adults literature, and the movie needs to reflect that. Otherwise, it's just some lukewarm snozzcumber soup.",1482537600,6,2031,4.731638418079096

7755841,5,B01G4N5Q0A,"Mostly true to the book.  As always, there are golden nuggets left out from the book and some rather significant changes are made here and there, but, and this is a GIANT BUT, I felt they stayed very true to the Spirit of the book and the main story line.  Roald Dahl is one of my all-time favorite authors and this is my favorite of all his books.  I was so happy when the BFG started speaking in the film.  It was a good indicator of what was to come and I was not disappointed.  I felt that the BFG was the most likable CGI character I have ever experienced.  The voice acting combined with the incredibly expressive animation was superb.  One of my favorite parts of the movie was when we got to see into the dream of a young boy after the BFG visits him.  It was hilarious!  The book tells you more of the funny dreams, but at least they put one of them in the movie.  If you have seen this movie and liked it, you really should do yourself a favor and read the book.  If you have kids, you might want to consider reading it with them.  If you have read the BFG and liked it, you really should give this movie a chance.  Brilliant!

7755919,4,B01G4N5Q0A,We like kids movies!  This is a cute movie.  My wife wanted to watch it.  I wasn't familiar with the series like she was when she was a child but I went with it.  I enjoyed it but I wouldn't hold it to classics.  She was disappointed as well and said it didn't meet her expectations.  Not knowing the series I can only ding it slightly based on the boss' feedback,1481760000,,363,4.042253521126761
7755920,4,B01G4N5Q0A,"I liked this movie. It's visually spectacular, the tone is gentle and childlike (and pure Spielberg) and has two amazing performances. Ruby Barnhill and Mark Rylance really make this movie work, and the visual effects and production design are just flat out amazing. The design of London felt like a marriage between the chimney rooftops ""Mary Poppins"" and ""Harry Potter"". John Williams' score, as always, great.

Towards the end, the movie does become a little silly and out there. And it's often very slow-paced. This movie honestly might would have worked perfectly at 90 minutes rather than 2 hours. Far from the best movie this year, but it's still a good and solid movie the family can enjoy. 3.6 out of 5 stars.",1481760000,,718,4.837398373983739

I never really got sucked into this movie, it was a little bit slow and the animation was very noticeable and the girl felt out of place. I would say the cgi is on par with the prequel star wars films.  But besides the aesthetic point of view I had to push my way to finish the film, I just never felt a since of magic or wonder.

7755977,2,B01G4N5Q0A,"I'm not familiar with the book, but if this movie stayed anywhere near the story line, a dull time was had by all...okay, MOST. Even as an adult, I can usually get into kid's movies. I tried hard, hoping something magical would begin in the next frame. But, the frames got fewer and the only magic was in the incredible fx. The relationship between girl & giant was quite mundane. Not once did I have an ""Oooohh, sooo sweet"" moment. Very young kids will be dazzled and enjoy the bathroom humor, but, unfortunately, will be too young not to get scared witless. So, it's a crossbreed that's sort of stuck in no man's land.

Frankly, it seems a darn shame to waste such wonderful effects on such a weak story. The girl actor was above average. BFG was very well-done, but this giant just kept offering promise without really delivering.",1481241600,2,833,4.553333333333334

7756026,4,B01G4N5Q0A,"If one were to summarize director Steven Spielberg's output it would be safe to say that he is at the top rung of great filmmakers of all time.  No matter what genre he tackles Spielberg is capable of putting his personal stamp of excellence on the product.  I was anxious to see ""The BFG"" though not enough to pay admission at a theatre but excited enough to await its home video release.  I wouldn't say the film is a letdown but to be kind it is mildly flawed enough so to give it something less than an enthusiastic recommendation.  The problem lies in my mind with the script and the pacing of the film.  It unravels at a slow deliberate clip and ends abruptly leaving an unsatisfied taste in mouth.  A little more heft in the screenplay and tightening in the editing room would have helped the film immeasurably.  The pluses here are numerous.  Terrific art direction and special effects.  Spielberg stalwarts composer John Williams and cinematographer Janusz Kaminski once again deliver stellar work.  Mark Rylance as BFG proves his Oscar was no fluke.  Partially animated Rylance recalls the work of Andy Serkis in ""The Lord of the Rings Trilogy"" except his character is benevolent and not malevolent.  Hearing Rylance spout out the Gobblefunk dialogue will make you grin from ear to ear.  Ruby Barnhill as Sophie continues the tradition of Spielberg getting excellent performances from children.

Considering this is directed by Spielberg, I had high expectations for the movie.  As far as the special effects and CGI that the movie has, those expectations were met however, the story itself was a bit disappointing and lacked the magic that Spielberg movies usually have.  The story to me is missing something and for the most part, I found to be pretty boring.  I was expecting a bit more of a magical moment at the end than what it turned out to be.

The development of the relationship between Sophie and the BFG seems a bit rushed with little time for the audience to feel a connection between the two.  There are a couple of cute moments with the BFGs word choices and the whizzpoppers but those jokes are definitely aimed at a much younger audience than me.  The scenery is definitely beautiful though with touches that both Disney and Spielberg are known for.

It isn't a bad movie by any means but this maybe movie is better suited for a much younger audience than older kids and the young at heart like me as I don't there just wasn't enough substance to the story to keep me involved in the movie.

7756056,4,B01G4N5Q0A,"The BFG,"" adapted from the 1982 Roald Dahl novel, is about Sophie (Ruby Barnhill), an 8-year-old orphan from central London who is taken from her orphanage in the middle of the night by a 26-foot giant, portrayed by a special-effects enhanced mark Rylance. Sophie is snatched up because she spotted the lumbering giant from her window. Afraid that she will reveal his existence, the giant takes her to his remote secret cave inhabited by other giants.

After a period pleading with the giant to return her to the orphanage, Sophie realizes shes a lot happier with the BFG (big friendly giant) who looks after her and never punishes her. Because the others giants are carnivorous and sense fresh meat, Sophie must keep out of sight, aided by the BFG.

Rylance is excellent as the BFG, but his performance and his character are far better than the movie itself. Director Steven Spielberg, who crafted one of the best films about kids in E.T., never captures the same magic in The BFG. There are some razzle-dazzle set pieces along the way, but the film is overly talky and strives too hard for laughs. The motion capture technique renders Rylances face completely expressive, and the blend of live action with CGI is seamless. John Williams provides the score, which gives the film a grandiose tone that conflicts with the story. Though not up to Spielbergs usual standard, the movie still offers an entertaining trip into a fantasy world.

7756070,4,B01G4N5Q0A,"Its a long time in between modern classics that are just right for younger children, but director Steven Spielberg and actor Mark Rylance have delivered a rollicking lullaby of a movie that, even if its not getting its just due in theatres, will find a place on the video shelves for years to come.

Spielberg continues to be one of our most prolific and dynamic directors and often does not get credit for taking risks.  The BFG, a semi-classic 1982 childrens novel from the surreal mind of Roald Dahl (Charlie & the Chocolate Factory, The Witches), would seem too safe a project for Mr. Spielberg; filled with imperiled children, CGI giants and fantastical dream worlds mashed up with London of the 80s (even though the orphanage seems straight out of Dickens-era London) and a bittersweet ending (much changed from the book), its the kind of thing Spielberg can knock out in his sleep.  Its a slight film for the director of Jurassic Park and Schindlers List, but, like Robert Zemeckis much maligned Polar Express, it will likely endure for generations, simply because its not trying to be anything other than a whizpopper of a gentle fantasy.

Theres no winks-n-nods to the adult audience here, and nothing terrifying happens; a gentle giant named Runt travels from the land of giants (really, really North) to collect and deliver dreams to the beans, or humans.  He catches little orphan Sophie one night and takes her to his home and dream laboratory; at first thinking shes there to be eaten, she realizes hes a lonely soul who is bullied and harassed by his much larger and more menacing brethren, a brutish group who kidnap and eat children.  Together they concoct a scheme to banish the other giants; a scheme involving the whimsical complicity of Queen Elizabeth and the British army.  The plot points are not as important as the delivery; Mark Rylance is superb in motion capture form as the timeless Runt, giving him a delightful stuttering, twitter-pated vocal cadence and word-mashing thats part classic Walter Brennan and part Lewis Carroll.  As Sophie, newcomer Ruby Barnhill is sweet, smart and perhaps not quite precocious enough to steal the screen from the CGI.  Penelope Wilton has a nice turn as the Queen, and Bill Hader leads the band of nasty giants as Bloodbottler.  Spielbergs friend Melissa Mathison (E.T.) wrote the script, her last before she passed in 2015.  The film is dedicated to her.

Theres much veiled social commentary in Roald Dahls works, but Spielberg effectively skirts any stretching in that direction and keeps the tale focused on dreams and farts.  Just when you think its getting a bit too smarmy, the action shifts from giant land to the real world and Spielberg has a lot of fun with the giants intro to royal society.

This will be on my video shelf next to Babe, My Neighbor Totoro, and Polar Express.

CLICHES:  Giants are big; kids are little.
SURPRISES:  This is the first ever film that Spielberg has made for Walt Disney Pictures.  Spielberg had been planning the movie for decades and back in 1991, it was going to star Robin Williams.  The BFG is a far better movie than Spielbergs disastrous Hook, which starred Williams.",1472515200,16,3181,4.846580406654343
7756071,5,B01G4N5Q0A,"This Spielberg film is touching, magical, lovely, and wondrously alive in a deeply emotional and spiritual way.  It has action, but it is first and foremost a story of growing, maturing love between two very different characters who teach each what life and love and friendship really are.  It is the most childlike, in the best possible sense, of any film I've seen in many years.  To me it is a precious gem, with humor, depth of character, a grand mythos fleshed out visually, musically and in a strangely poignant coming of age story line.  The actor who plays the giant is a joy to watch, in his every mannerism and facial expression.  He communicates with a simple smile and a imaginative communicative and warm body language.  The child actor those very much smaller in physical stature, is able to stand up to the giant in a very human and genuine manner.  I love every moment watching these two beautiful beings interact and grow in understanding and loving friendship.  Wow!  This is a classic that will stand the test of time, in my opinion.  Like the Wizard of Oz that took some time to be as treasured as it has become, this film too will take some time to gain the acclaim it deserves, going back to the roots of the medium of film, when character was the centerpiece that made the story work.  Thank you, Speilberg and John Williams!  Magnificent!  Really!",1472428800,9,1371,4.615702479338843

The movie was delightful, imaginative, sweet and adventuresome.  Sophie was full of courage, spunk and had a plan.  There was no death or destruction, no war or horrible violence yet bad actors got their due.  There was such a sweetness and beauty in the relationship that developed between Sophie and her BFG. There was hilarity and magic.  At the end the audience in the theater applauded...something I do not remember happening in a long, long time.  I seldom see a movie twice because my memory has developed a censor that edits out portions of a movie I did not like, so the second viewing I am disappointed.  I returned to see this movie with friends the following week, it brought me to tears as it was richer than I had remembered.  My husband was also moved and again the audience applauded. I am 69 and my husband is 71.  Thank you Steven Spielberg and all who were involved in the making of this film.  I wish every family would see it.",1472342400,3,1091,4.606217616580311

7756074,4,B01G4N5Q0A,"I confess I was wanting Tim Burton to direct a movie version of the Bfg. I hadn't seen  many Spielberg movies, so I didn't know what to expect watching this.
The good The dialogue is right out of the book. Mark Rilance has fun with Dahl's wordplay, speaking slowly so people can understand. If people haven't read the book, his play on words can seem annoying.
Ruby Barnhill plays Sophie, giving her a sassy personality. I like this Sophie better than Dahl's too polite one. I'm glad she was picked, instead of someone people already know.
Penelope Wilton was a good choice for the Queen, acting in control the whole time. An unknown to kids, hopefully she'll do more family movies.
Dream country was lovely, very colorful. The bubbles are pretty, cool that it's underwater. that's also where a new subplot comes in. Liked the idea of the missing blanket. In the book, it's not mentioned much.
The BFG's cave was a treat, too. I know those scenes could seem long, but they were taken from the book. Sophie and the giant did have long conversations with each other to develop their friendship. She encourages him to stand up to the others, and he eventually does.
The bad You don't find out Sophie's name right away. There wasn't enough dialogue in some scenes, like the Queen's palace. We assume Sophie and the BFG tell her about the giants, all of a sudden, she's on the phone to the White House. That would've been a good time to slip in the Miss Souri and Mrs. Sippi line from the book! None of the people eating jokes were there at all!
The queen didn't seem grateful to me. Okay, she gave the BFG a garden. So, the ending felt rushed.
The other giants weren't scary, but they might be to kids.
Some people complained about the Whizzpopping, it's in the book, not overdone, like I was afraid would happen. And people were expecting dark Dahl, instead, they got Disney Dahl.

7756078,4,B01G4N5Q0A,"Given that Steven Spielberg's been at the helm of so many childhood classics that his name has become synonymous with nostalgia, it's kind of amazing that he's never made a Disney movie yet. And yet that was absolutely the case before The BFG, his adaptation of Roald Dahl's beloved novel about a young girl and the big friendly giant she befriends. The combination, which includes late E.T. writer Melissa Mathison, proves to be every bit as magical we could have hoped. The BFG is Spielberg at the height of his powers, crafting a story that will whisk kids and adults alike into a fantastical world that is tall on heart.

The film is built almost entirely on the wonderfully expressive performances by recent Oscar winner Mark Rylance (of Spielberg's Bridge of Spies) and newcomer Ruby Barnhill. The 12-year-old actress plays Sophie, a spirited London orphan whose insomnia causes her to spot the Big Friendly Giant tip-toeing through the empty streets late at night. Moments later his giant paw is plucking Sophie from her bed and carrying her off to Giant Country, a hidden place on the outer edges of Great Britain. For obvious reasons she fears being chomped by the big-eared, soft-spoken giant whose vocabulary consists of jumbled gibberish and Giant slang. But it turns out the BFG, the name she ultimately gives him, has no interest in eating her. He eats snozzcumbers, the rotten, stinking vegetable that grows on the island. He also drinks frobscottle, a green drink with inverted fizziness that causes the most delightful of putrid farts. The BFG lives up to his moniker, but he's still the runt of the litter compared to the other giants, who munch on ""human beans"" and have names like Fleshlumpeater (Jemaine Clement), Bloodbottler (Bill Hader), and Bonecruncher. They bully the BFG at every chance they get, and eventually begin to sniff out Sophie's presence.

The vast majority of the film takes place there in Giant Country, mostly in the BFG's home which is full of all sorts of wonders. He's an inventor with contraptions littered about everywhere, and a giant pirate ship for a bed. The film's already impressive visuals jump a notch when we're introduced to the BFG's laboratory, where he keeps dreams, all glowing and will o' the wispy, bottled up and locked away. That's his job, going out at night to Dream Country to capture the good dreams and dispense them to the world, or to keep the menacing red dreams locked away where they can do no harm. Every place we're transported is brimming with visual splendor and teeming with boundless energy. If only there were more places to visit because the story does tend to drag a bit after being in the BFG's home for so long. We begin to feel as if we've been kidnapped and locked away in Giant Country, as well.

Fortunately, Rylance and Barnhill are terrific together and imbue their characters with so much spirit that we can't help but fall for them. Rylance is a veteran performer who had been working a long time before Spielberg ""found"" him and it's no wonder he seems reluctant to part from the actor now. Barnhill continues the tradition of unforgettable child performances in Spielberg films. Her Sophie is at all times caring, mischievous, and a little bit dishonest, but she's supremely loyal to her new friend and willing to risk her life for his. It's the BFG who is in the most danger here, not her, an unexpectedly rewarding dynamic that pays off in the final scenes. There's also a good deal of cheeky humor that comes about when the BFG is introduced to the Queen of England (Penelope Wilton), who is promptly introduced to frobscottle and the gastrointestinal relief it provides.

The BFG is a nearly-perfect little bedtime story, and as such it lacks the dark subversive tone of some of Dahl's other works, particularly Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. It's rare nowadays to have a family film exist simply to kindle the imagination but that's what The BFG does, ensuring Dahl's classic will be remembered on the page and the screen.",1470182400,38,4027,4.831884057971014
7756079,3,B01G4N5Q0A,"Last night I took my two girls who are 6 and 3 to see the film version of Roald Dahl's 'The BFG.' We're in Peru at the moment, so we watched the film dubbed into Spanish. This was actually kind of fun because Roald Dahl dearly loves playing with language, and 'The BFG' is probably the work where he indulges himself the most in this respect.

I've always been a great admirer of Dahl, and I've only recently finished reading all his works to my daughters so the story was still fresh in their minds. Dahl gets unfairly criticized for his use of reoccurring themes like: ""poor people are morally superior to rich people"" and ""evil people should be punished."" I find it odd that Dahl would be criticized for paraphrasing 'The Bible' but I guess most people don't read that either.

Although I'm a big fan of Dahl, 'The BFG' is probably my least favorite of his works. For me, the best is 'Danny the Champion of the World' which a lot of people haven't even heard of. 'Matilda,' 'Charlie and the Chocolate Factory,' and 'James and the Giant Peach' are all great, but 'The Great Glass Elevator,' and 'George's Marvelous Medicine' are a tier below.

My problem with 'The BFG' is that too much of the entertainment is just how the BFG talks. Yes, it is funny, but after a time the language games start becoming a little self-indulgent. But that's just my perspective and I see and respect how other people absolutely love this book. I don't consider it a Dahl classic though.

The film is quite beautiful but I have to wonder how much of it was actually ""Directed"" by Steven Spielberg. He's at the point now where he can just hire a young, upcoming director to do the work and then show up on set four or five days before racking up the credit.  I think there is some sort of rule about how you have to shoot 51% of the film to call yourself ""The Director"" but every rule can be worked around.

There aren't a lot of Steven Spielberg type moments. He likes to do things like point the camera at a mirror and then you see the action in the mirror...kind of self-indulgent just like the word play complaint I had before. What Spielberg is really good at is capturing the child/adult relationship, and that doesn't really come across here. Although maybe my impression comes from the fact that I'm watching this as an adult now and not a child. Come to think of it, Spielberg hasn't done any kid's movies for a while has he?

The actor playing the BFG is spot on. He does a good job with wry smiles and emoting sad kindness. Sophie is also pretty good, though a lot of her performance is just her staring over the rims of her eyeglasses.

I thought the film really missed the mark with the giants though. They were a little too big and creepy and not ridiculous enough. I think Dahl's weird sense of humor is the hardest thing to transfer to film. In his books, it's funny when an evil school teacher grabs a child by the hair and swings her in circles before launching her over a fence. Yes, you wouldn't think a scene like that would be funny, but somehow Dahl makes it so. However, if you try to convert that scene to film and play it straight, it comes across as super creepy.

The giants are a bunch of evil bullies who pick on the BFG, so you had the option for an important message there, but I think this film focuses on the value of friendship a little more, so it kind of falls flat. It does a good job hitting the plot points of the book, but I think the ending is a mistake. As I recall, the evil giants were sentenced to live in a pit, in this version they send them off to an island, forgetting that the giants have a magical running ability which allows them to cross the earth in a single evening (I presume that includes the ability to run across water).

The fuzzy drink that the BFG loves is well employed and if you're into fart jokes this movie is a must see. Normally I'm not into them, but my kids enjoyed the 'breakfast with the queen' scene so much that just those two minutes justified the whole rest of the movie.

All in all, the movie is quite beautiful, hits some high notes, and the kids will probably really enjoy it. I don't expect them to sell a lot of DVDs though as this doesn't seem like something that can hold up to many repeat viewings. If you're a big Roald Dahl fan, this is certainly a respectful treatment of his work, which is always good to see. Hopefully some kids will be inspired to pick up the books which remain, as always, better.",1469836800,,4474,4.326968973747016

7756083,4,B01G4N5Q0A,"Forget about the box office numbers and the mild reception BFG received from critics and audiences.  If you don't clear your mind and find the proverbial blank slate, these outside influences will taint your viewing and in the process a gem of a movie will be missed.  The public reaction initially served to reinforce my general angst and reluctance to shell out $40.  I kept asking myself, how could a Spielberg movie based on a Roald Dahl book flop? This wasn't like most other current movies being produced, which are basically over-hyped schlock (usually sequels) that require mindless consumption of over-buttered popcorn to survive the journey.  However, I had a hunch that BFG would be a quality film because it didn't fit this popular zeitgeist.  Plus, the kids really wanted to see it and I am sucker for taking my kids to the cinema.  In the end, I am glad I listened to my kids because BFG combines the best of both visual effects and storytelling, making it the type of movie that keeps me and my family coming back.

As a family movie, it doesnt get much better.  BFG spoke to my wife and me, and my two sons, (ages 7 and 9), on different levels yet still allowed us to connect and talk about the film days later.  After all, isn't this the true point of movies  to tell and re-tell the story, long after the lights have come back on and the theater is empty?

For the adults, BFG offers insights into one of the greatest mysteries of aging, the loss of friends and increase in loneliness as the years pass.  The BFG himself is a sensitive and complex being who is alone, a hermit of sorts.  His only human contact is the nefarious giant bullies who periodically intrude upon him and outlandishly degrade him.  He is, in a sense, Corey Haim in his most prized role of Lucas, even down to catching dreams in jars via beautiful things that fly. But, when fate connects him to Sophia, an orphan, they begin a journey together that breaks their parallel cycle of loneliness. In the process they establish a love and commitment to each other that develops bonds of true friendship.  This is quintessential sappy Spielberg, but isn't that why we love him?

For the kids, BFG has the excitement of wonder  the main character is a kid, its full of giants, there are new unexplored lands, it features the Queen of England and  wait for it  giant farts!  What would a movie with a friendly giant be if there wasn't a juvenile ode to that bodily function that has been captured from Chaucer and Shakespeare to Caddyshack and Austin Powers?  Yet, there is far more going on here to keep it from whiffing. BFG conveys to kids in a relatable but non-preachy way that it is okay to be afraid, but eventually you have to stand up to your fears.  When you do good things happen.

So, why didn't BFG reach its potential?  A few things methinks.  Was there any other book adapted movie more in need of a title change?  Even my 7 and 9 year olds knew that the F didn't really mean friendly.  It also happened to be competing against Finding Dory  which leads me back to my first paragraph.  Lastly, its greatest asset was also its greatest weakness, Spielberg himself.  More specifically, it is the legend of Spielberg.  The man is like King Midas, every movie he touches is expected to turn to gold.  He is no longer allowed to make a good, decent family friendly movie.  It has to be E.T. or Indiana Jones.  If its not, then we consider it Hook, which once again brings me back to my first paragraph, but I digress.  BFG was, in my humble opinion, a victim of Spielbergs success.  And that my friends is a shame.

So do yourself a favor, go see BFG, but skip the over-buttered popcorn.  I guarantee you won't miss it.",1468800000,174,3713,4.486567164179104

If you ever read this Roald Dahl book as a child, this movie will be a giant (geddit?), nostalgic punch right in the feels. The BFG himself is brought to glorious life through the ever-expressive face of Rylance and the deft touches of a very talented animation team. The dream worlds fizz with life and imaginative design that leaps off the page.

Adapting a rather short story into a full-length movie has its pitfalls though, and the pace does seem to lag  in the middle, as smaller ideas from the novel feel fleshed out for time.

Though some of Dahls darker ideas are glossed over (as they always seem to be in movie form), and the Sophie seems a bit more precocious than I remember her, The BFG (both movie and character) is still rather charming.",1468281600,36,1074,4.510309278350515

7756088,5,B01G4N5Q0A,"My wife and I took our daughters, 7 and 4 years old, to see The BFG.  We all LOVED it.

From start to finish I felt a smile on my face.  I've heard some people complain that the movie is boring, and while each one is entitled to their viewpoint I cannot say that I will ever understand how they feel that way.  The reality is that I can't remember the last movie, regardless of subject, genre, or content that didn't have a vocal group of people on the internet claiming it was boring, from the latest Star Wars movie to any number of award-winning dramas.  It just makes me sad that so many are incapable of enjoying a light-hearted movie unless it cuts from one action-packed scene to the next.  Can't anyone sit back and enjoy a movie that creates an amazing, wondrous, whimsical atmosphere that is full of imagination and appreciate the fine performances as we watch the relationship between the two main characters develop and grow?  Yes, this movie features several scenes where Sophie and The BFG are simply interacting with one another, finding out more about each other.  And those scenes are glorious.

One criticism I've seen of this movie is that it doesn't compare favorably to another Spielberg family classic: E.T.  First of all, that's setting quite a bar for any movie, considering that E.T. is one of the most critically-acclaimed and popular films of all time.  But more to the point, I actually think that The BFG reaches that bar and measures up to E.T. as another instant classic for the whole family from Steven Spielberg.  Mark Rylance is pitch perfect as the Big Friendly Giant, playing a lovable, awkward 24-foot runt living in a land of 50-foot child-eating brutes.  His delivery of Roald Dahl's ""gobblefunk"" is spot on, making for several humorous moments, and the masterfully utilized motion capture technology allows us to see the warmth in his eyes and smile, growing to view him more and more favorably the longer we spend time with him, just as Sophie does.  Speaking of which, Ruby Barnhill as Sophie nails her role as well, accomplishing the difficult feat of convincingly playing opposite an actor pretending to be a 24-foot giant.  The other giants provide a fearful enough presence (it is valid to state that Spielberg toned down the darker side of the book, but that was also understandable...do you really need to see giants gleefully chomping on children in a family movie in order to appreciate how frightening a thought that is?) while at the same time being amusing.  A highlight is the scene where they bully BFG by tossing him around and play with actual vehicles like children with toy cars.

It was fascinating watching Spielberg bring to life the places we had seen in our imaginations while reading the book.  The scene where Sophie and The BFG are chasing dreams in Dream Country was magical and enchanting.  The imaginative methods employed by BFG to conceal his presence as he moves through the London streets at the beginning of the film and again as he infiltrates the grounds of Buckingham Palace were done perfectly and very enjoyable.  The sequence showing BFG mixing the dream for the queen is great, as is the demonstration of him blowing dreams into a family's home and then describing the dream the boy was having to Sophie.  That was one of several scenes that allowed the audience to feel the connection between BFG and Sophie growing.  Those scenes reached their high point for me with Sophie and BFG sitting on a hill in Giant Country and him telling her about the special dream he had stored in a jar that was for her.  It's a heartwarming scene, lighted and framed to perfection in quintessential Spielberg fashion.  And the breakfast scene with the queen and the ""musical"" effects of everyone drinking the BFG's gift of frobscottle provided the biggest laugh of the film.  If you take yourself too seriously to laugh at ""whizzpopping"", then I guess a delightful movie like this isn't for you.

It also strikes me that this is a movie that rewards an observant viewer.  Even in my initial viewing, I noticed many little details that added to my enjoyment.  I'm looking forward to catching more of this when we go back to watch it again (something all 4 of us are excited to do).

It would also be a mistake to fail to mention John Williams' score for&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-BFG/dp/B01EX1AUL0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The BFG</a>.  Like Spielberg himself, the excellence of Williams seems to be taken for granted a bit because he has produced so much incredible content for so long.  But he still delivers consistently, and the music he provides here is wonderful.  It captures the beauty, the fantasy, the humor, the excitement, and the range of emotions present on the screen perfectly.  And like so much of Williams' work, it is equally enjoyable while watching the movie or, as my family and I have found, while listening to it by itself.

This movie is an example of old school Hollywood storytelling.  Like so much of Steven Spielberg's work, it doesn't shy away from sentimentality.  Sadly, many in modern audiences seem to have decided that it isn't cool or something to respond emotionally to a movie that is designed to stroke their heartstrings.  So they fight against it instead of just sitting back and enjoying the movie as it was intended to be enjoyed.  That's the only explanation I can provide for anyone who couldn't feel a connection to Sophie and The BFG and didn't feel touched as they watched, especially during the scene on the hillside that I mentioned earlier or the terrific final scene just before the credits roll; they had to be actively resisting the movie's emotional pull, refusing to be moved by it

Bottom line is this: if you require an action scene every 5 minutes to enjoy a light-hearted movie, this isn't it.  If you think a movie has to explore its subject in the grittiest and darkest way in order to be worthwhile, you probably should look elsewhere.  But if you are capable of relaxing and letting a movie stimulate your imagination and transport you to a strange faraway place, and willing to open up your emotions and allow one of the master storytellers in cinematic history in, then I would say that you will very likely find the experience of watching The BFG as rewarding as my family and I did.",1468281600,15,6370,4.807339449541284
7756089,4,B01G4N5Q0A,"The BFG..The Big Friendly Giant..I have not read the story before but went to watch the movie today. The movie time was of course for my kid but I also had a keen interest to watch this one as the trailer was quite interesting and I am an die hard fan of Steven Spielberg.
This movie is for kids but good to watch for adults also. The 3D effect was soothing as per the movie. You can't expect hi-fi 3D effect of space movies from a kid friendly movie.
The little orphan girl Sophie performed by Ruby Barnhill and The BFG performed by Mark Rylance was awesome. It feels the characters really came out from page and became real. We enjoyed each scene of drinking the fizzy drink frobscottle and it was really funny. We burst into laughters mainly in the frobscottle scene at the Queen's place.
The make up of the nine giants The Fleshlumpeater, The Bonecruncher, The Manhugger, The Childchewer, The Meatdripper, The Gizzardgulper, The Maidmasher, The Bloodbottler, and The Butcher Boy were too good. The looked really scary. Whereas The BFG was really lovable.
Overall it was a nice movie to watch. My kid enjoyed the movie though she was a bit scared watching the nine giants. But she loved Sophie and the BFG. Good to see movie with Spielberg's magical touch.",1468022400,7,1259,4.6

Bad enough that most family films are now laced with ghetto rap music but, now, Spielberg subjects his audience to a series of un-funny, low brow fart jokes. We walked out, along with several others, and asked for our money back.

Yeah, Spielberg, we get it...farting exists. However I seriously doubt that anyone would actually believe that listening to it is entertaining...except you.",1468022400,17,524,5.058139534883721
7756092,3,B01G4N5Q0A,"Theatrical review. While watching the various trailers for this Steven Spielberg film leading up to its summer release, one is led to believe this is the next E. T. Well Ive seen E. T. and I will tell you that this is no E. T. What it is however is a big, beautifully looking movie with some really big characters. One who isn't however is Sophie (Ruby Barnhill), an orphan of about 12, who has trouble sleeping. One night while walking about the orphanage shes taken by a giant, who is known as the Big Friendly Giant (Mark Rylance, Bridge of Spies). Hes only interested in capturing her dreams, but still won't let her return to her home, as it were.

While BFG is indeed very big, hes a runt compared to the other dozen or so companions. He also has a friendly temperament and is a vegetarian unlike his buddies who prefer to eat human beans. Essentially the movie is about BFG keeping Sophie hidden from his hungry friends. The final act has the duo appealing to the Queen, who looks like Elizabeth complete with matching Corgis. They want the rest of the giants isolated so they stop kidnapping children and well eating them, I guess. This darker side of the story is suppressed.

Surprisingly, this British Queen has the authority of the Prime Minister to call the military to action. Who knew? Evidently not Spielberg, the screenwriter, Melissa Mathison or Roald Dahl, the books author. I saw this movie with a theater nearly full of kids from about 4 to 10 and surprisingly they were all pretty quiet. Thats usually a good sign for a movie targeted at kids. Or maybe they were dozing off like me. The film looks good. Barnhill and Rylance are excellent, but the movie just isnt. Sorry.",1467763200,2,1693,4.565789473684211
