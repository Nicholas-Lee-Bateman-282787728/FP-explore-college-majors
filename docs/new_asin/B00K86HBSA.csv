6406863,5,B00K86HBSA,These videos are the best method to learn Spanish that I have found -- much better than high school Spanish and the other programs I have tried. The spanish is shown with great visuals that make it a lot easier for me to remember. I am happy with this product.,1436745600,2,260,4.22
6406864,5,B00K86HBSA,"This Spanish program is just AWESOME! I have the three volumes and my students love them all! They are fun, very clear for the learners, dynamic, the contents are very clear and very well connected. I really hope the creators keep producing many more.",1434240000,2,251,4.7272727272727275
6406865,4,B00K86HBSA,"It's good, kids enjoy it well enough. Maybe kids learn better through real life scenarios, I don't know, I'm not an expert, but I'd also love a cartoon sing/song variation. Kids have been watching this as a supplement to other tv on and off and don't balk, but I anticipate them growing tired of it sooner than say the cartoony leap frog videos.",1429056000,,345,4.492063492063492
6406866,5,B00K86HBSA,"The second volume of this DVD did not disappoint us. The videos are once again fun. It is exciting to see that the second DVD is a higher level of spanish and my son is able to follow along! The lessons do what all great education tools should do: entertain, simplify and repeat. This DVD is a little more challenging for my wife and I and we need to watch it more times to catch up with our son. I will say that we don't mind because we are enjoying learning along with him and he likes that too. I wish something like this had been around when I was his age. I'm looking forward to more volumes in the future.",1426636800,4,611,4.0578512396694215
6406867,5,B00K86HBSA,"I used Foreign Languages for Kids by Kids with my 7 year old.  I have tried out all the pieces from the CDs to the Dice Game and Labeling Cards.  I love this system!  It's fun, simple, and you can go at your child's own pace.",1421712000,,225,3.847826086956522
6406868,5,B00K86HBSA,"We already have volume 1 and were thrilled when our daughter ASKED US to get volume 2!  It's a great continuity from the first dvd and funny.  Words learned from volume 1 return and are added to build longer sentences in sketches easy to follow and entertaining.  Figuring out the words by watching the skits is actually fun and all of us (even mom and dad) are learning. The second dvd is a higher level (advanced beginner/early intermediate?) and it really feels good that we can watch these stories in all Spanish (no translations) and understand them. Every time we watched we learned more and felt more at ease hearing the language. Definitely a fun way to learn Spanish, for kids and their parents!",1415836800,4,704,4.661290322580645
6406869,5,B00K86HBSA,"Well made. Excellent tool to reinforce what my son is learning in school. Great for all kids. Engaging, interesting and effective. I highly recommend this product.",1415750400,,163,5.3076923076923075
6406870,5,B00K86HBSA,"This is an excellent DVD to supplement classroom instruction, or get children of any age started with Spanish. I use it in my Spanish classroom because it is one of the few DVDs I've found that successfully imitates immersion. The stories are engaging and memorable, with lots of context and visual cues, and my middle-school students pick up a new word or two every time they watch.",1413331200,6,383,4.731343283582089
8656739,5,B00K86HBSA,"Having lived in a foreign country for many years, I do think immersion is the fastest and easiest way to learn a language. Additionally, I've found there is a big difference between understanding a language on paper and understanding a conversation spoken in real time. (It as if you have to re-teach yourself how to listen.) That's where this DVD comes in handy.

Using the immersion approach, the program uses one scenario as the backbone of the video. Mini segments are then inserted along the way that break down the information into bite sized teaching chunks to ensure comprehension of the main story line. Information is presented in a simple style so the viewer can grasp content through context.

There is lots of built in repetition. For slower paced or younger students, this can help them master the information in a gentle, go-at-their-own-pace manner. However, this can be a little cumbersome for the teacher who likes to control when and how much repetition the student receives or the faster paced student who already gets it. The one story scenario may quickly leave them wanting more (though not a bad thing).

While not meaty enough to be used as a stand alone, the program can definitely serve as an asset to any foreign language curriculum. From introducing vocabulary, bringing your foreign language out of the textbook, enhancing listening skills or using the scenes to spark conversations and Q&A sessions with your students, I can think of many ways one could use this program!",1522108800,,1502,4.9523809523809526
8656740,5,B00K86HBSA,Very good. It uses Spanish only but the visuals are great and the repetition helps so much.,1501804800,,91,4.411764705882353
8656741,5,B00K86HBSA,"I have just purchased levels 1-3.  I talked with the owner of the company and was totally impressed with how this program came to be.  If all educators and lawyers could work this well together, our nation would be excelling in education far more than it is.  This company is going to places.  My hat 's off to them!",1481846400,,316,4.305084745762712
8656742,5,B00K86HBSA,"Our family felt a little sad when we finished this series. It was fun to watch and we can't believe how much we learned and how easy it was. Each time we started a new video, at first it seemed like it may be somewhat difficult. But every time we watched again, it got a little easier and after awhile we couldn't believe we ever thought it was hard at all. We hope more will be made soon.",1478822400,3,389,4.0
8656743,5,B00K86HBSA,"I am so glad we found this Spanish program. We use it in our homeschool and my children are really enjoying it while learning. After summer break, I quizzed them with the flash cards and they remembered what they had learned last year!! I am very pleased!! Thank you for a great product!!",1476835200,,288,4.452830188679245
8656744,5,B00K86HBSA,"I LOVE IT.
I have been looking for something like this for a long time.
I love that the idea ""kids teaching kids through a story""
For my experience teaching Spanish I know how important is to have fun in class.
I also love the story and every lesson is the continuation of the previous lesson.
I recommend it.",1468368000,,309,4.254237288135593
8656745,5,B00K86HBSA,It is very well done !,1455840000,,22,2.8333333333333335
8656746,5,B00K86HBSA,"Only DVD, it is a little bit expensive one.but fine.",1452470400,,52,4.3
8656747,5,B00K86HBSA,"We loved this DVD. It is a high quality Spanish program that builds on the videos before it. We have tried numerous foreign language curriculums and never found a Spanish program that our kids both enjoyed and retained. Highly recommend this DVD, can't wait to buy the workbooks next for a complete curriculum for our oldest son in the new year!",1451433600,2,345,4.672131147540983
8656748,5,B00K86HBSA,The second was as effective as the first video. My 10 and 13 year old speaks spanish around the house and to each other. The video shows the Spanish in detail so you are never left behind. Great way to make learning Spanish fun!,1443830400,,228,4.204545454545454
