4065458,5,B0033PRVMO,"This is a very interesting concept.  It is general psychic-type information given via electronic technology to a man who shares it to stop it or change the outcome.  While the information comes through very similar as it does to a psychic, it can also be very specific.  Still, the problems with interpretation become evident.  It involves human flaws, the growing awareness of possible multiple interpretations, and a chance to make a difference.  How does this affect ego, awareness of perception, government control, and more.  I enjoyed all of these shows.",1353801600,,560,5.166666666666667
4065459,5,B0033PRVMO,"I thought that the show was brilliant and I have watched it about three times (all episodes). Yes, bits & pieces of ""future"" clues are given but one question the watcher must constantly ask - is pursuit of the future occurrence actually setting events into motion to cause that outcome?!? I do not find it simplistic and I question whether it was actually canceled. I have noticed that unlike American television programming, the BBC does not run an idea into the ground s-t-r-e-t-c-h-i-n-g out everything! OMG! Yes, the viewer actually has to think! What a great idea!",1351987200,,569,4.876288659793815
4065460,4,B0033PRVMO,Started off a little boring but picked up very nicely. Left me wanting answers-and another season. Enjoyed the storyline and sub context,1349568000,,136,5.2272727272727275
4065461,3,B0033PRVMO,"Here's another promising show that got short shrift from the television network. PARADOX aired across the pond in 2009 on the BBC. Set and shot in Manchester, England, this DVD package is appropriately of a Region 2 persuasion. Too bad the show's deaders. When you've got British sci-fi television fare as freewheeling and in your face as DOCTOR WHO, TORCHWOOD, and PRIMEVAL, it's difficult to compete when your schtick is plodding police procedural and slow burn gratification. LIFE ON MARS, a fellow sci-fi police drama, was able to get away with a minimalist sci-fi premise. But PARADOX was too stingy for too long with reveals concerning those overarching conundrums. The plug was pulled before it found its audience. Like me. I stumbled across it in tardy fashion. Maybe there isn't a Subway franchise in Britain with which its fans can launch a last ditch save-the-show campaign.

There are elements here of 24 and FlashForward and even MINORITY REPORT. It offers plenty of mind-warping philosophical and moral quandaries for us to wrap our heads around. Only, I wish there were more of them water cooler moments. Me springing from common denominator viewership, I don't get upset when you ding my brain pan with questions of morality and proper ethics and quantum mechanics, but you best give me the fancy explosions as well. I am shallow and, sad to say, folks like me are legion. In my eyes, PARADOX needed a bit more flash and a more accelerated pace.

Five hour-long episodes, totaling 294 minutes, comprise the entire series, and the first episode does offer fireworks. At 2:33am, a series of fragmented images, revealing a massive explosion, are transmitted from the depths of outer space, manifesting on the display screen of space physicist Christian King (Emun Elliott). But the time stamp on the images suggests that the catastrophic event has yet to happen, eighteen hours away. Now a team of police investigators, eyebrows skeptically arched and led by DI Rebecca Flint (a commanding Tamzin Outhwaite), must race against time to avert a potential disaster. As they analyze the mysterious images for long shot leads, it gradually dawns on them that maybe, just maybe, this isn't a prank, that perhaps these images are really from the future. Some react to this epiphany with wide-eyed wonder and excitement. Some are absolutely horrified.

Besides the space scientist's dubious assistance - Dr. King is a distant and disdainful git - DI Flint is supported by straight arrow DC Callum Gada (Chike Okonkwo) and loose cannon DS Ben Holt (Mark Bonnar), Flint's off-again, on-again flame. There's a chance that PARADOX over-indulges on the juicy soap opera elements. It's interesting, though, that further episodes go on to challenge the viewer's initial perception of these characters. As the investigating team learns, there's nothing like being exposed to the truth of predestination to rock your foundations and shift your beliefs some. I love that the climax to the first episode doesn't give us the ending we expect. This adds a fascinating dimension of uncertainty to the show. And as a tease to the second episode, we glimpse a new batch of disturbing images streaming on the space scientist's screen.

I happen to love this particular sci-fi gimmick. This isn't time travel, but it's the next best thing: a dark message from the future. These five episodes raise those familiar questions: Is the future set in stone? By attempting to change the future, do you, in effect, bring about the very event you were trying to change? These questions have been explored before in other similar shows; there's nothing really new here, from that aspect. Part of the fun is in piecing these fragmented images together so that they finally coalesce into a cohesive narrative. Intriguingly, the team won't have a 100% success rate. I did enjoy the characters' frequently adversarial interactions and the arcs they individually undergo, and how very quickly they venture beyond their lawful jurisdiction. What dropped the ball for me was the plodding pace and the unimaginative police procedural bits. And because the ratings were utterly dismal, PARADOX, lacking enough of those fancy bells and whistles, got the axe before we learn the secrets behind it all. Where do these images originate from? What does it mean when a future suggested by these images is thwarted? How does episode five's bloody cliffhanger ending resolve? You'll just have to shrug it off and move on. If you're one of them types what gets fixated on stuff like that, then I don't recommend trying out PARADOX. Me, I'm still trying to get over the brutal, frustrating demise of POPULAR and EARTH-2 and SPACE: ABOVE AND BEYOND and TRU CALLING and SURVIVORS and... Hell, it's a long list.

The 2-disc DVD set's bonus stuff:

- ""Prometheus Bound"" - exploring the set of the Prometheus lab (00:07:10 minutes)
- ""The Big Bang"" - Episode One behind-the-scenes shooting of the explosive scene in which a petrol tanker crashes into a bridge (00:06:29 minutes)",1338768000,13,5031,5.048134777376655
4065462,2,B0033PRVMO,"The premise of this program is simplistic and the writers don't do much with it.  A bunch of cops are given a few fragmentary, confusing clues about a crime, or something, in advance, and they have to figure out what the clues mean and stop the bad thing from happening.  Only instead of getting these clues from a medium or a psychic of some kind, these images get downloaded mysteriously from outer space.  The writer's don't do much of anything interesting with this idea.

The characters are also poorly developed. The dialogue is mediocre at best. Bad British writers love to have their characters yell and scream and browbeat and insult each other and behave like incredibly annoying jerks.  There is a fair amount of that in this series.

I had high hopes initially and looked forward to watching the episodes I bought. But after wading through four episodes, I am not at all surprised that the series was canceled after only 5 episodes. I would have canceled it myself.",1334880000,18,977,4.7176470588235295

4065466,4,B0033PRVMO,"another good show...I'll follow this season one and hope that it doesn't get too expensive on Amazon.
The plots are intriguing. They are off to a good start.  Could be a classic, if they can keep it up.",1392940800,,202,4.315789473684211
4065467,3,B0033PRVMO,The series is formulaic and quickly wears out.  What's lacking is some engaging plot progression rather than episodes that essentially repeat the same pattern.,1392595200,,159,5.625
4065468,2,B0033PRVMO,"This show has one interesting character. The rest are freaking boring, which is a shame because the premise is pretty cool. Why cast such uninteresting actors? And why are the characters so poorly written? The plot line is quality work, but for what is basically supposed to be a police procedural the ""cops"" spend half of every episode complaining, and the other half fighting and sulking. The  lead cop brings her ex onto the team, who sits through most of the pilot. (Sulking.) Then in a later episode they have a fight about her keeping things from him and for the rest of that episode he sulks and ignores her calls.(The calls of the lead investigator during a case involving the possible murder of a woman.) Because he is her ex she does not have him removed from the team, but tries to make up. So very irritating. I keep wanting to shout at the characters to grow the f up.",1392422400,,881,4.472049689440993
4065469,3,B0033PRVMO,"Acting was good in this series. The story line was interesting, but for the first couple of shows was not done that well.

4065475,4,B0033PRVMO,"Enjoyed the first season and I hope there is a second.  I like the premises and hope a second season will explore more of that question.

4065478,2,B0033PRVMO,"I did watch all six episodes, and I probably will watch more if they make more. That main scientist shown in the picture is very annoying, I must say. As viewers we are somehow expected to believe that he knows more than he's revealing, but he just seems to be too contrived. The show reminds me somewhat of Flash Forward, but it doesn't come close in quality or scope.",1366329600,,369,4.36231884057971
4065479,3,B0033PRVMO,"The concept worked for me, as well as the slowly unwinding mystery of where and how the information from the future was coming to them. For me, the single biggest problem is the portrayal of the scientist. I think they were going for a mild Aspergers type, but he's so withdrawn and aloof that he's part of the surface plot, but not part of the human story. The police characters were more fully developed, but weren't enough to save this one for me.",1365811200,,450,4.433734939759036
4065480,2,B0033PRVMO,"I wanted this show to work..it has a good premise for some nail-biting moments, but the characters are all a bit ordinary. No one compelling role that drives you back to watch the next show.

Quite disappointed actually. Acting not up to the usual standards of British TV and although the lead guy is decent, he is a little too low-key to work the ""drama"" in the show",1364428800,,367,4.397058823529412
4065481,2,B0033PRVMO,"The concept is engaging--a scientist receives warnings from somewhere in space that catastrophic events are going to occur and a team of police and scientists set about attempting to divert these catastrophes from happening--with varying success.  The series would be more compelling if there were a gradual unravelling of the mystery behind the signals.  This is a single, plot-line show where a dual plot line--one that reveals an alternate reality beyond what is happening in real time--would have provided depth and thought-provoking meaning for audiences.  The female protagonist is excellent.  The brooding male scientist comes off a bit creepy instead of troubled as he is meant to be, I believe.  If you want something border-line sci-fi and still engaging, try Warehouse 13, Touched, or 666 Park Avenue.",1363132800,,812,5.362204724409449

8388030,5,B0033PRVMO,"Too bad this show only had a few episodes.  If you liked the X Files, you'll probably like Paradox as well.  The elephant in the corner of the room in each episode is ""What is the source of these pictures?  Omniscience time travel?""  That not being explained makes the show all the more tantalizing.  Characters were developed well without spending too much time doing so.",1522972800,,372,4.661538461538462

8388032,5,B0033PRVMO,"This is an edge of your seat BBC series. The premise and narrative are really good. For me, the ONLY negative was that there were only five episodes. Yes, some of the characters are: bitchy, self-absorbed, or short sighted and there are some minor characters who don't add much to the narrative, for example DCI Sarah Bower, but thankfully they are given minimal time and they  don't take away from the main storyline.

Set in the UK, physicist, Dr Christian King is studying solar flares and their effects on the Earth's power grid. The satellite he uses to gather his information, Prometheus, suddenly begins sending images from a worm hole which portends near future crimes.

Calling on an agency within the British police, he requests an officer be sent to help investigate. He asks for someone who is both intelligent and has some imagination (is open-minded).

Detective Inspector Flint is sent to hear him out but when he presents his findings, she's angry with him because she thinks it's a hoax and he's wasting her time. However, before she leaves he gives her w some information and after she checks the information she's reasonably convinced that something isn't right and it's worth looking into. She returns with two of her co-workers, DS Ben Holt and DC Callum Gada, to investigate further. The first case is lost because it takes them too long to debate whether Dr King is crazy, messing with them, or in fact onto something. After failing to solve that case, only to have seventy-three people die, they move onto the following crimes with ever increasing vigilance.
The cases are really interesting and engaging. If you like sci-fi and don't mind that it ends after five episodes, this is a good show to watch.

Again, the only thing I would have liked would be  more seasons but they pretty much ended any hope of that with the season one ending.  Boo Hiss!
