8435003,5,B004LWG3ZO,"I'd give this DVD more stars if I could. DMB put on one of their finest shows. The whole band is on fire in here and plays possibly one of the best versions of ""Lying in the hands of God"" I've ever heard. I love the intro and outro with the interviews with the ravenous fans in line. Check out this DVD!",1528416000,,303,3.903225806451613

8435006,5,B004LWG3ZO,I really enjoyed watching this concert DVD. Fast delivery and great quality! A great purchase to make anyone feel you are at the concert in person.,1393545600,,147,4.6923076923076925
8435007,5,B004LWG3ZO,"The DVD is great, but I'm disappointed that the case it came in was completely broken. At least the DVD didn't break.",1389657600,,117,4.363636363636363
8435008,4,B004LWG3ZO,"I am a hardcore Dave fan and I own all of the other video DVDs the band has released.  For whatever reason I didn't have this one in my collection until recently.  This release is probably not going to please the casual fan of the band as the setlist is very Big Whiskey and Groo Grux King oriented (I believe all of the songs from that album are represented).  But for a hardcore fan such as myself I really enjoy having video versions of such newer songs like ""Seven"", ""Why I Am"", ""Lying in the Hands of God"", ""Squirm"" etc - it really complements my collection of the other DMB video DVDs.

I only have two complaints: 1. I would really love to have a Blu Ray version (as I would for the other video releases).  2. I have never seen DMB overseas, but I always hear about how crazy the crowds are.  I didn't really feel that the crowd was that great here - but perhaps it's just me.  I have some of the Live Trax from overseas: from places like Portugal, Brazil etc - and I can hear how crazy the crowds are in those audio releases.  Anyway, solid release overall",1386547200,4,1064,4.206896551724138

8435010,5,B004LWG3ZO,"As we are DMB nuts,The DVD was perfect. Quality and sound are great. It was like we were there are selves. Well worth the price",1356652800,,127,4.12
8435011,5,B004LWG3ZO,This dvd is great. The picture and sound quality are very good. The setlist mostly contains songs from Big Whiskey. A must for any fan of the band.,1337990400,,147,4.285714285714286
8435012,3,B004LWG3ZO,"Great to see and hear DMB perform many of The Groo Grux King songs live, and they did it professionally, as always.

Unfortunately, the video editing leaves must to be desired, with too many shots of the audience, many out-of-focus, close-up shots, and too few scenes of the band themselves.",1307059200,2,291,4.82
