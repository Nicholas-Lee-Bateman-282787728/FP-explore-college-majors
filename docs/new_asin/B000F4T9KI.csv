8117498,4,B000F4T9KI,"A really peppy show, with lots of action and innovative slapstick routines. Herbert Lom is there too, repeating his demented character from the Pink Panther series.  One little problem: I didn't understand a thing of what was going on--not the scam, not the sting, nor the sting on the scam.",1486252800,,291,4.82
8117499,4,B000F4T9KI,"This is a funny little movie which draws its inspiration from ""The Sting."" Bud Spencer is as always lovable and fun, and this movie sees him almost never using his ""secret weapon"" (read: funny punches to stop his adversaries). Mind me, I said ""almost never."" It's a lot of fun for the whole family, clean and fresh like a nice soda on a Summer evening.",1485129600,,352,4.430769230769231
8117500,5,B000F4T9KI,"All his movies are funny and just good easy going entertainment. Almost a Three Stooges quality. If your looking a complex master piece, this is not for you.",1484697600,,157,4.642857142857143
