4510439,5,B004GNEDAK,I took a second look at Preludium and enjoyed it even more than the first time.  I think the film is an astonishing accomplishment in terms of getting everyone in location in time and the coordination that was involved.  I really enjoyed it.,1379548800,,241,4.5813953488372094
4510440,1,B004GNEDAK,This movie was so bad that I had to turn it off.  I really enjoy foreign films but this one not only bored me but it got to the point where I was frustrated with the movie.  Maybe I should have given it longer than the 20-30 minutes I put into it but I didn't enjoy that time whatsoever.  I even attempted to fast forward the movie to see if it got any better...and it didn't in my eyes.,1371168000,,387,3.8734177215189876
4510441,1,B004GNEDAK,"""Well that movie was a piece of crap"" I said when I thought it was over. But the movie just kept on going and then I realized there was 23 more minutes to go. No thank you. But if you like movies where men are depicted as murderers and rapists while women are depicted as innocent victims of men rejecting them (interesting how men are vilified for both wanting and NOT wanting women), then you'll love this movie. If you're not into those things, then who knows, maybe there's some twist ending within the last 23 minutes that redeems the movie. I suspect, though, that it will just be more feminist propaganda, and more headaches from trying to watch the movie while the shaky camera tries to chase after running actors. During the street scenes, which is where most of the movie takes place, you will also have to deal with constant noise from cars honking and yelling.",1368316800,,872,4.525316455696203
4510442,3,B004GNEDAK,"Interesting characters, generally well acted, each involved in their personal crisis, interact almost at random to produce a fascinating but ultimately incongruous portrait of human struggles set in Copenhagen.  There is little action, and the setting is deliberately annoying with street traffic, blaring horns, and an unexplained celebratory backdrop that plays no direct part in the plot.  While the movie has both dramatically compelling and delightfully humorous moments, there is far too much time spent watching the characters walk, then run, then walk some more.  There was so much of this it felt like cheap filler.  Still worth seeing. Very adult themes and language.",1364947200,,677,5.480769230769231
4510443,1,B004GNEDAK,i completely disliked this movie.  It was distasteful within the first 10 minutes of the movie.  Do not watch this.,1359936000,,115,4.7
4510444,5,B004GNEDAK,"Browsing through prime videos the cover looked compelling enough to try it.

If you enjoy foreign films and don't mind some truly terrible lighting then
you should definitely try this.

The single shot camera action was shaky but forgivable to literally see people
walking by and interacting with each other.  I was very engaged with what was
happening on the screen.

Totally worth it.",1359158400,8,386,4.984375
4510445,5,B004GNEDAK,"This film, like the movie, Russian Ark, was made in one continuous shot, without any breaks.  It does have a jumpy, disoriented feel at times, but this is to be expected when you consider the challenge of such an undertaking.  The movie is about  a young woman who is wandering the streets of Copenhagen, searching for her missing husband.  It documents the intertwined lives of a group of characters who have had contact with her husband and the pivotal moments of transformation they experience during one night. It is a challenging movie, not unlike an Isabelle Huppert film, where it can be difficult to have sympathy for their complicated and (sometimes) unlikable personalities.  But there are unexpected scenes of hope and redemption in this thoughtful study of human frailty.  This is not an easy film to watch.  Like most important films, it makes certain demands of the viewer. But with patience, it is a compelling movie with unexpected rewards.",1358294400,21,956,4.9748427672955975
4510446,1,B004GNEDAK,This was a horrible movie!!! Please do not waste your time watching this mess... very confusing and a total waste. Dont let the cover fool you.,1357776000,5,143,4.538461538461538
8450234,1,B004GNEDAK,"Better look for another movie. It is a confusing story, a pervert guy manipulating women in his live. Really bad movie. If you like strange movies you can watch this one. I didn't like it.",1400976000,,188,4.4
8450235,3,B004GNEDAK,A pretty decent movie. The whole film is one shot with no cuts or breaks. It is about a woman looking for her husband.,1400112000,,118,3.9583333333333335
8450236,5,B004GNEDAK,"If you are bored with regular snipped and cut and edited pictures...this is what I recommend for you.  This film is shot continuosly with no cuts.  I was impressed with the timing of the characters coming and going. There is plenty of raw emotion from the characters which makes one want to keep going through the picture with them. The film takes you through city streets and you see people coming and going, meeting and interacting all in one camera shot.  This is no easy feat to accomplish.  This was a nice change to view.",1397692800,,527,4.515789473684211
8450237,5,B004GNEDAK,"Great live theatre on the street, mesmerizing!
No100 take shams, great spontaneity makes for exciting cinema. More experimental takes no fear inspiration!",1397088000,2,154,6.045454545454546
8450238,1,B004GNEDAK,"Well, this movie sounded like something I would like to watch, but I am not into reading sub titles. So I shut it off.",1396310400,,118,3.9583333333333335
8450239,4,B004GNEDAK,This was a pretty decent movie. The ending was good. I understand danish so I can see though a bit of the humor gets lost in translation.,1386720000,,137,4.111111111111111
8450240,4,B004GNEDAK,"This movie was all shot with continuous filming, so the camera doesn't ever stop. It follows some very unstable folks around and chronicles their human frailties and how they deal with them and each other. I was most amazed by the fact they were able to film it the way they did, it had to be difficult and demanding for everyone involved. It was worth watching just to see how they pulled that off. But otherwise, just a so-so storyline and characters.",1382918400,,453,4.536585365853658
8450241,1,B004GNEDAK,When reading the description of the movie it didn't say that it wasn't in English. I would have been ok with subtitles but they talked so much and there where so many that it was hard to keep up. What I could get didn't make a whole lot of sense and I never did see how this movie could be classified as gay and lesbian genre. I was very disappointed.,1382832000,,351,4.0285714285714285
8450242,2,B004GNEDAK,The movie was very noisy with street traffic and fighting through the whole movie.  Not what I was looking for,1381104000,,110,4.5
8450243,1,B004GNEDAK,Somehow thought this was a mystery. Ended up being a b movie with a poorly developed plot. Skip the movie,1379548800,,105,4.3
