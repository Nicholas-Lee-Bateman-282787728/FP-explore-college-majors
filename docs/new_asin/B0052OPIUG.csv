4530368,5,B0052OPIUG,"We absolutely LOVED this movie!!! And we are so excited that it will be on dvd already!  We waited for this movie for months and the night it came on was a big family event.  Can't say enough about how cute, funny, smart, this movie is.  Everyone should watch it.  Phineas and Ferb is a fantastic show for kids AND their parents.  We love trying to find all the hidden movie gags (especially the Star Wars bits).  The creators of this movie (and the show) are just brilliant!  Genius!  Thank you guys for another FANTASTIC movie!",1312848000,9,529,4.4375
4530369,5,B0052OPIUG,"""Phineas and Ferb: Across the Second Dimension"" is a great movie that revolves around the adventures of a family that end up in an alternate reality.  The mastermind behind this event is the character of Doofenshmirtz (played by Dan Povemire as per the imdb website).  Perry the Platypus is another character that is used to portray the family pet who is an undercover spy.  He is trying to do his part to save his owners (Phineas and Ferb) from being harmed while simultaneously safeguarding his true identity.  In addition, Phineas and Ferb's older sister Candace normally enjoys trying to catch them in their scientific activities.  Candace does this with the secret hope that their mother would also catch Phineas and Ferb in the midst a science experiment.  Candace even seems to be bothered by the fact that her brothers enjoy coming up with some innovative technological creations. However, she changes her feelings about this during the time in an alternate reality. In the second dimension, she meets her alternate version where Phineas and Ferb do not partake in growth enhancing discoveries (influenced by the second dimension Candace being too overprotective of her younger brothers).  I enjoyed watching this movie because it sent out the positive message that happiness can be found in the present.  This film is also very uplifting (and can stimulate laughter) because it contains humorous scenes pertaining to what can happen when a person is allowed to play in separate dimensions.  ""Phineas and Ferb: Across the Second Dimension"" is great to watch to invoke an uplifting mood.",1312761600,2,1594,5.1

This movie takes you to another dimension with Phineas and Ferb as they finally meet Dr. D and find out that Perry is a secret agent.  They also get to meet their other dimension selves including their sister who finally comes to terms with busting, well not busting them.  And the best part you see that Perry really does care for the boys as he has kept record of all of their summer inventions.  Let the battle for the Tri State Area begin.

It's funny and smart and an enjoyable way to spend time with the kids... or just to watch on your own adults reading this. Okay, that describes the show too but you get the idea. It's interesting to see the opposite version of all the main characters from the show and is a good story idea that plays out in a way that holds your attention.

4530415,5,B0052OPIUG,"I've probably seen it over 40 times now, and at least ten of those were by myself. Hahaha! So my son LOVES this movie. He's two and he interacts with the movie (especially when Phineas and Ferb are running from Other-Dimension Doof). This movie is a great composition of story-telling and simplicity. The music is great and you can't get good children's (and adult's) entertainment like this. Every other show that my son watches drives his dad nuts, but when it comes to Phineas and Ferb, he loves it just as much as his son and I do. And that says a lot. My husband frequently voices and quotes Doof to make us laugh, and even dressed as Doof when we went to a comic convention (our son was Phineas and I was Linda). With the DVD, I love all the supplementals you can play with. There's a jukebox that plays the music from the movie and the soundtrack (some tracks were omitted from the actual movie), and my son dances to all of them. And I love to sing them to him because they're fun and catchy. This movie never gets old, there's always something your eye will catch in the scenes that you didn't see before, and I almost always (ALWAYS) cry toward the end when Phineas and Ferb rescue Perry just in time).

But this movie was not only hilarious, it was well written and every bit as ingenious as the series it is based off of. This movie is an absolute must-see for any fan of Phineas and Ferb, period, no questions asked. 5-stars all the way; I intend to see this movie many more times.

Just as a side note, though, it may be a bit too dark and/or ""scary"" for the younger fans of Phineas and Ferb (like 6 and under) and there are many jokes that will go right above their heads, but there is technically no reason they shouldn't be allowed to see it. This movie was fine with its G rating, which is very respectable for a modern cartoon series. There's nothing ""dirty"" in this movie at all. Still, for those who have young children, I would watch this movie first before deciding if they would be okay to see it. The ending might need to be explained to really younger kids or they might take it the wrong way.

Overall, though, excellent film and a must-see for any fan of the series. Top-notch music, too.",1359849600,,1115,4.304761904761905

4530430,5,B0052OPIUG,"Phineas and Ferb: Across the 2nd Dimension is a Disney Channel original movie based on the widely-popular Disney Channel animated series. In the film, Phineas Flynn and his step-brother Ferb Fletcher are shocked to learn that the Flynn-Fletcher family pet platypus Perry is really an agent of a secret organization of animal spies when they encounter Dr. Heinz Doofenshmirtz and his latest ""Inator""-a machine that can open a doorway to another dimension. There Phineas, Ferb, Perry, Dr. D. and Candace-who accidentally stumbled into the fray-meets their alternate selves, a Phineas and Ferb and Candace as rebel fighters, Perry as a platypus cyborg and Dr. D. as a succesfully evil dictator. Now, both sets of Flynn-Fletchers and the Dr. D. from our reality must the truly evil Doofenshmirtz from taking over our reality. The special features includes deleted scenes, Doofenshmirtz's Jukebox-Inator, a bonus episode of P&F-Attack of the 50 Foot Sister and sneak peeks of other Disney favourites such as Bambi 2, Prom, Fish Hooks, The Lion King special edition and the new Disney animated adventure Tron: Uprising.

4530432,5,B0052OPIUG,"If you like Phineas and Ferb you will love this movie.  If your children ages 3-13 haven't discovered them yet, buy this movie.  It is refreshingly appropriate for all ages and even fairly entertaining for adults which is unusual for kids' shows!",1341792000,,246,4.833333333333333
4530433,5,B0052OPIUG,"(I'll explain my title down below in the 'spoiler' section.) I'm 38 and do not have children. My favorite genres are science fiction and fantasy. I love animation, both American and Japanese, and after watching tens of thousands of shows, I have developed VERY high standards.

Phineas and Ferb: Across the 2nd Dimension meets my standards admirably.  It's definitely a thinking person's movie/series, with all kinds of cultural references (remember the show Laverne and Shirley?) and deeper levels of thought than most of today's mindless entertainment, yet kids can watch and enjoy it immensely for the action, quirky humor, songs, and deep bonds of love between family and friends. ""Anyone ELSE here leading a bizarre double life?  Put your hand down, Ferb.""

Honestly, I'd never seen the show before I watched this movie on a whim, and was pulled into their world within minutes!  The only time this has happened to me in the past ten years was during the fantastic movie 'Megamind'&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Megamind-Two-Disc-Blu-ray-DVD-Combo/dp/B003UESJFG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Megamind (Two-Disc Blu-ray/DVD Combo)</a>, so I knew I was watching something special.  You will CARE about these characters, even the villains.

Right from the beginning, the music swept me up on a glorious ride I have YET to come down from after more than an month.  I even bought the 3 CDs (You want the Wal. Mart exclusive Movie CD-it has ten extra songs from the series including fan favorites Spa Day, A-G-L-E-T, Candace Party and Watchin' and Waitin'), bought the Summer Belongs to You Amazon download, and even went looking online for those that aren't on the CDs.

(The music itself really needs a separate review, as there were 261 movie/series songs already as of May 2012, across a huge range of music genres.  There's something for everyone, fun, upbeat and catchy as all get-out!  Seriously, I watch this show as much for the music as the plots, characters and laughs. The best part is they're written to be easily singable by everyone.  I appreciate little details like that.)

This movie is not available on blu-ray, unfortunately, but the quality of the WS (widescreen) DVD release is crisp and clean, MUCH better than the first two DVDs, which were not only SD (standard definition) they were not widescreen and had aliasing that produced an odd echo-lines here and there.  I haven't seen the two more recent releases-the Christmas special and The Perry Files, but since they're widescreen I figure their quality is on a par with this movie edition.

For a fascinating, touching look at deeper issues, watch 'Phineas and Ferb Get Busted'  http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006GM4VX8  It's one of my favorites; actually brought tears to my eyes more than once. Note the nod to the 'chain gang' songs of historical America.

One more thing.  I highly approve of the wide range of worldviews this show displays, from happy blended families (the two main characters are stepbrothers) to looks at other cultures (supporting characters are of Indian, Mexican-Jewish and Japanese cultures) to the show's central concept-that anything can be accomplished if you use your imagination, work hard, and above all, get out there and DO something!

I'd heard of this show for years but never got around to watching it.  Now I wish had, but for those of you who are on the fence, if you have Amazon Prime you get to watch the first two seasons for free, SD or HD.  So what are you waiting for?  As the song goes, Carpe Diem~ and enjoy the wonderful world you are about to enter.  I'll be right there with you.

What I meant by 'explores the one place they haven't gone' I'm not talking about a parallel dimension, although they do that, too.  I'm talking about the heart. I'm talking about seeing friendly, beloved characters display enough bravery and self-sacrifice in the face of genuine evil to make your heart swell with pride (Phineas' rare ""No"" scene stands out), new ways of looking at the world (Candace seeing her brothers through Alternate Candace's eyes as precious treasures to be loved and protected) and even budding love (Phineas' reaction to Isabella's kiss leaves you no doubt about his feelings for HER).

Even better, Phineas fans will be thrilled at the exploration of his character, as the normally calm, even-tempered Phineas is upset, hurt and even angry at Perry's years of deception and worse, letting the boys actually help an evil scientist further his evil plans.  It's proof of just how much he loves Perry, since betrayal from those we love always hurts the worst.  Their eventual reconciliation is just beautiful to watch, so heartwarming!

I understood why they had to have their memories erased-since Candace's attempts to 'bust' her brothers is one of the main conflicts of the show, so that didn't disappoint me as it did other people. But even though their memories are erased, you'll remember.",1340668800,,5017,5.052184466019417

The packaging is great since it comes with a slipcover, blue case, platypult kilt, 150 DMR points, the digital copy, 8 bonus tracks, and the bonus disc.

4530439,5,B0052OPIUG,"I LOVE Phineas and Ferb! This is a brilliantly written cartoon. This movie is P&F at it's best! I laughed so hard I was nearly in tears! I can't even express my favorite part because every time I think of one, another great one comes to mind! My kids and I saw this on TV and I bought it as soon as I was able. Then my husband got to watch it too and we were all in stitches all over again. It's refreshing to watch a cartoon that's still for kids and not have to worry about inappropriate content but is so well written that any age will enjoy!",1322697600,3,545,3.963636363636364

For anyone who has never seen Phineas and Ferb, you are missing out. The tv show is clever, funny, and is uplifting. I'm always smiling and laughing the whole way through. That means it's not just for kids. There are jokes or references, albeit clean ones, that only adults or people that have lived in certain places or eras would understand. Makes you want to watch every episode to see what you're missing.",1318896000,,567,4.5588235294117645

4530445,5,B0052OPIUG,"In a world where entertainment is riddled with violence, inappropriate images and  language, Phineas and Ferb is a breath of fresh air. This is a cartoon that parents can feel good about their kids watching. It is always upbeat and positive and encourages creativity in young people. Granted there are certainly better ways to encourage creativity then watching tv, but this show is something special the entire family can sit down, watch together and enjoy. It has a great sense of humor, an interesting plot line and catchy songs you will find yourself humming long after the show is done. That being said, if you are watching the movie having never seen a Phineas and Ferb show in your life you are going to be a bit confused. There's a lot of in-jokes and characterizations that only the veterans will get, but still the movie is a very enjoyable experience. It has just the right mix of action, comedy, music, a touch of romance, and a secret agent Platypus. I don't know of any other movie that can say that!
  If you have never watched the show I do suggest you do so before purchasing the movie. There are clips all over the internet and it will give you a better grasp on whether or not this is something your family would enjoy before spending your hard-earned money. I do think that it is very reasonably priced though for everything that you get in the DVD. First you get the film, then you get a digital copy of the film, as well as a CD with the songs from the movie. You also get a ""build your own platypult kit"" (Don't worry, it will make sense when you watch the movie) The DVD itself also has some bonus features and a few secrets of its own! Overall  I am very pleased with my purchase, and I think ""Phineas and Ferb the Movie: Across the 2nd Dimension"" is a fine addition to the ""legacy"" of Phineas and Ferb and I can't wait to see what Disney comes up with for the daring duo next!",1316649600,10,1902,4.379603399433428

4530447,5,B0052OPIUG,"Disney's ""Phineas and Ferb: Across the 2nd Dimension"" is a great, highly-entertaining movie featuring the characters from the successful ""Phineas and Ferb"" television animated series.
Created by Dan Povenmire and Jeff 'Swampy' Marsh, the show translates well to feature-length stories! The 'alternate dimension' is well-played, and the depth of characterization is enjoyable!

4530448,5,B0052OPIUG,"This is definitely one of the most creative and FUN series on Disney! It's great for kids but has enough for the adults to get a few laughs too. We were excited for the premiere of the movie and as soon as it ended I just KNEW I'd have to order the movie and the CD. They did a really good job on the story line (as usual) and I love how the integrated so many elements of the show over the years into the movie.  The songs are wonderful and catchy. They really did a fantastic job on this movie! There's a line in the movie where Phineas, Ferb and Perry are standing together and Phineas asks ""Is anybody else here leading a bizarre double life?! Put your hand down Ferb""! I'm so hoping that leads to another movie! This is really just fun and funny entertainment for the whole family. Do yourself a favor and order the CD - you'll find yourself singing the songs over and over!!",1315872000,,880,4.176470588235294
4530449,5,B0052OPIUG,"If you enjoy the regular episodes of Phineas and Ferb, you'll most likely love this.  Our favorite thing about P&F is how it caters to both children and adults.  First thing my husband does in the morning is check and see if a new episode has been added to Netflix.  Like with most shows, not EVERY episode is a winner, but that's a matter of opinion.  As to this movie, it was a home run in our house.  I love the music, although I was a little disappointed that they cut out Candice's song ""Mysterious Force.""  although it is included in bonus features. My 4 young children loved it too.  Someone mentioned it might be a little scary for little kids, and I can see that as being possible.

SPOILER!!!  don't read on if you don't want to know what happens before you watch!!

My favorite part of the movie, by far, was right before the kids all had their memory erased, and Isabella kissed Phineas.  His reaction was so awesome, after watching that tension between the pre-teens for a few years, it was definitely amusing!",1315353600,4,1023,4.446236559139785
4530450,5,B0052OPIUG,"""...FERBULOUS!"" - The Danville Tri-Stater

The above critical rave is fictional, but don't you just love the way some reviews make the huzzahs really big and the sources small? (""*****A TRIUMPH!"" - The Margate Pennysaver).

In the case of Phineas and Ferb: Across the 2nd Dimension, its acclaim was well-earned and the ratings were high. The series is one of the best series on television today, including live action and prime time. And if you follow the series, you can spot references between episodes and learn its ""language,"" so to speak. And it's very easy to do that because Disney Channel and Disney X-D runs the already large library of episodes quite a lot.

This helps in appreciating the first TV Phineas and Ferb movie, Across the 2nd Dimension, especially the spectacular climactic scene that parades elements from numerous episodes within minutes. However, it's not necessary to be a Phineasoid to enjoy the film.

Like the series, it's chock full of eclectic songs that weave through a snappy script. It's not just a padded episode, but a well-constructed story that sets up a logical way for the basic series premise to unravel. For fans of the show, it's the equivalent of Dr. Bellows finding out the truth about Jeannie. How it resets itself to sustain the series' continuity is clever.

The DVD package comes with a bonus digital disc so you can download the movie on an I-device plus eight songs (though I recommend the soundtrack album too). There's one episode from the series with a commentary track, though I wish the feature had a commentary too.",1314921600,10,1572,4.872659176029963
4530451,5,B0052OPIUG,"""Phineas and Ferb the Movie: Across the 2nd Dimension"" is a Disney ""movie"", starring Phineas and Ferb from Disney HD's animated cartoon series of the same name. The story ... Phineas, Ferb, Perry and Dr Doofenshmirtz get transported into a parallel dimension where a more evil/competent Dr Doofenshmirtz has enslaved (say it with me) ""the entire Tri-State Area"" and the boys must try and set things right ... is typical Phineas and Ferb (P&F) - smart, funny, and written on a level that entertains both adults and kids. The music is also typically outstanding.

The package I bought contains two DVDs with the movie, eight deleted scenes (probably cut for time constraints), a bonus episode from the show, a digital copy of the movie, 8 music tracks from the movie, and best of all, a ""Platypult""! :-)

One mild word of warning if you have little ones (say 6 and younger) that like P&F; this episode is a little darker than what you see on typical episodes on TV. Two of my kids were scared a little, and one had to be coaxed to watch till the end to see that no one got hurt and that the ""good guys"" won. Tellingly, they haven't asked to see it again as they do for other episodes we own. This isn't to say that this movie is too over the top or unsuitable for kids, but you may want to watch it first if you have youngsters who might get scared and make your own call.

But the wife and I absolutely loved it. I highly recommend this movie ... five stars.",1314576000,23,1457,4.388888888888889
4530452,5,B0052OPIUG,"P&F was terrific. Sharp humor, touching and it never dragged. Not perfect, but what is? (Maybe Game of Thrones). Im 43 and can't believe how much I enjoyed this movie. Nice job guys, hope you make another one before you close the series out.",1314230400,,241,4.5
4530453,5,B0052OPIUG,"Anyone who loves Phineas and Ferb will love Across the 2nd Dimension.  The humor is the same as in the episodes, it's paced extremely well, and it doesn't seem like there are too many songs (as in Summer Belongs to You).

What's the advantage of buying the DVD over watching on Netflix, etc.?  Here's what's included:

* Across the 2nd Dimension in SD (not HD, unfortunately)
* 7 minutes of deleted scenes (each of the same quality as the rest of the film, in my opinion)
* Season 2 Episode: Attack of the 50 Foot Sister
* Perry-oke and Jukebox-inator for the songs in the movie
* Soundtrack (can be downloaded straight to your computer)
* Copy of the movie (can be imported into iTunes or WMP, but can only be played in those players; rip the DVD for full control)
* A delightful ""Build Your Own Platypult"" Kit (makes a high quality, cute little Platypult model with character discs)

Overall, I'd say this is an even better deal than&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/A-Very-Perry-Christmas/dp/B003ND0AXS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">A Very Perry Christmas</a>, which came with bonus episodes, but no Platypult.
