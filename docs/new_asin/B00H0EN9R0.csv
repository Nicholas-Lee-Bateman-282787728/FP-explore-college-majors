6125323,4,B00H0EN9R0,"Decent documentary, could have been better. I would have liked more interviews with the people of expertise involved in the case, law enforcment, psychologist, lawyers etc.  I feel bad for both Larry and Brandon. Larry didn't deserve what happend to him and its tragic. Brandon being only a kid and getting approached by Larry in front of his friend's at school makes me wonder the impact that could have on a young guy his age. I don't look at this case as a hate crime but more as an unfortunate and tragic event involing two kids who were both struggling in their own personal ways. Sad story for everyone involved.",1490832000,3,618,4.618181818181818
6125324,5,B00H0EN9R0,Extremely thought provoking documentary of a tragic school shooting.,1485475200,3,68,6.666666666666667
6125325,5,B00H0EN9R0,"It is well done, because HBO is consistent in their excellence of producing documentaries. It clearly and concisely allows one adult after another to spew hate and prejudice against a 14 year old transgendered kid, calling him a bully and saying that he should be beaten to death by his classmates. They forced the one teacher who tried to support him to leave the school after she witnessed him be murdered right in front of her and a classroom of his peers. They focused on his killer as a hero who had no choice and no one to turn to after he was asked by the TG kid to be his valentine, and the jurors in his trial all feel sorry for him and his abuse??? Thankfully HBO also talked to the prosecutor and police so it is made VERY clear the murder was 100% pre planned and was a hate crime. They talk to Larry's friends and we do get to see what a hard life he had, and what he struggled with, but NOTHING he did deserved him being murdered. Brandon got off easy, and the teachers open disdain and hatred for Larry makes me sick! THEY are part of the reason Brandon felt justified in murder...that and the neo nazi group he was part of. This doc will make you angry one way or the other, you will feel one of these kids was wronged and did not deserve what he got; if you choose Brandon, shame on  your narrow mind and hateful heart.  BTW, I am a middle aged straight white conservative liberal. I don'tQ! have a problem with the LGBTQ community because I am HUMAN, and understand that not all of us are the same.",1481673600,12,1516,4.224137931034483
6125326,4,B00H0EN9R0,"Several says after beginning to publicly identify at school as transgender Larry King (who had begun asking to be called Leticia) was executed in the classroom by Brandon McInerny. Brandon shot Leticia in the back of the head twice after bringing a gun to school. Brandon told people he was solving a problem for the community. This is a documentary about that murder, the trial, and the community's response.

Brandon's defense team used unsubstantiated stories to suggest Brandon panicked after receiving romantic advances. What is known is that Leticia became the target of some bullying after beginning to live her gender openly. She may have at times attempted to respond. The adults of the community rallied behind Brandon saying that any normal boy would have reacted the same. Community members and even jurors wore ""Save Brandon"" bracelets. It also turned out Brandon had begun associating with a white power group, decorating his backpack with such symbols and making related drawings.",1470528000,4,995,5.21875
6125327,4,B00H0EN9R0,A fair and even keeled documentary about the murder of one 14 year old by another.  Well rounded interviews from people on both sides of the incident.  Utterly fascinating.,1447459200,4,172,4.896551724137931
6125328,5,B00H0EN9R0,"Sad sad story, wonderfully portrays in the movie.",1442966400,2,49,5.25
6125329,5,B00H0EN9R0,"It is a heart breaking story of two teens and about the intolerance that exists in the USA
The one was different, acquiring a sexuality that was unbecoming of societal norms.
The other was a mucho one, like most kids are that age.
Both were 14 and their life got totally destroyed, when the latter decided to kill the first
one because he asked him out for Valentine's
It is one of those documentaries that shows that our children need more attention,
and that society, school, their friends, the TV will not raise them.
Parents need to step in and be parents, because when children shoot each other
there is something really rotten with that society.",1398556800,7,651,4.620689655172414
8628978,5,B00H0EN9R0,"Loved the documentary, but hated some of the people in it. Brandon (and his mother) are nothing but ignorant, hateful, uneducated, simple minded white trash. At least if he is in prison until he is 39 (a much better deal than he deserved) he can't produce any offspring who would be just like the totally worthless P.O.S. looser that he is. It's absolutely deplorable that somebody (anybody) can get 2 bullets put through the back of their head in cold blooded murder and have then have people emphasize with the criminal just because they are homophobes.  Yes, Larry King was a weird, annoying little misfit who wanted to rub his sexual identity issues into other student's faces, and no doubt an embarrassment to Brandon, but that was no excuse to execute him.",1532390400,,762,4.7727272727272725
8628979,5,B00H0EN9R0,Miscarriage of justice. Shooter should have gotten life without parole. Shows the ignorance of the townspeople. Very sad reality.,1531353600,,129,5.842105263157895
8628980,4,B00H0EN9R0,"It's sad to hear about why the young boy was killed, being who he was.  I thought the movie built a good base and history of why or how the killer evolved into a despicable person.",1528502400,,180,4.0

8628982,5,B00H0EN9R0,Powerful and unsettling. I use it in my courses to help students understand how structural racism operates and its consequences.,1515974400,,128,5.45
8628983,5,B00H0EN9R0,I only mark five stars not because I love it but because it is a lesson we must all learn about loving our students. I wish this documentary was never made and he was still alive. A documentary on how he overcame the struggles and how the community learned to embrace him would be better. Until then I must use this video to educate people and keep his loving memory alive. HE DID NOTHING WRONG BUT LOVE HIMSELF AND BE HIMSELF.,1508371200,,427,4.283950617283951
8628984,5,B00H0EN9R0,"This was a very well done documentary because it's an HBO doc.  I am very active in the LGBTQ community and I hadn't heard of this story before!  I'm not oblivious to the fact that I watched this through rose colored lenses of bias, but everyone in the documentary who showed more empathy for the shooter than the victim made my stomach churn.  Really, that was the only problem I had with this documentary, BUT it was a BIG problem. It's definitely one I would recommend for anyone to watch, if only to open their eyes to how much people often blame the victims of hate crimes, assault and abuse.",1498694400,2,597,4.409090909090909
8628985,5,B00H0EN9R0,"It is shameful to watch how poorly the school responded to gay and Transgender kids!  Girls get hit on by boys all the time and sometimes it is unwanted but it is the way the world works. Sometimes letting another person know how you feel works out.  It is our social standard for matting and dating rituals.
Anchorage AK a 14 year old girl who's never been in trouble before. Ties up a 70 year old man robs him and then slowly kill the tied up man over an hour.  She is just following the orders of the two older boys that she is with. Tried as an adult and deemed unrehabitable! She gets life. My thoughts at the time is that she is too young to have that type of determination.  She showed no remorse and was happy she did the crime. Even became pregnant from one of the guards while awaiting trial.
Brandon the shooter was no ""victim"" of sexual-harassment!  I've had countless guys try to pick me up or come on to me. I've had countless girls do the same.  I'm a good looking guy and I admit I'm gay. So do I claim all the girls who tried to hit on me or pick me up as sexual-harassment?
How about all the guys who hit on me that I wasn't interested in?  Just say no thank you and move on.  Oh but he is too young to have that sense of maturity!  He had enough to commit premeditated murder.  It becomes a story like Harvey Milk where Dan White says it wasn't premeditated even though he snuck in through a window with his gun to bypass the metal detector and shoots Harvey Milk and the mayor.
Dan White's Twinkie defense and an all Christian jury was a great miscarriage of justice.  He got out in 5 years. I'm glad he shot himself later.
We see the same thing here.
While I still believe that prosecuting a 14 year old as an adult might be an injustice as it leaves no room for rehabilitation which should be the first purpose of incarnation. A mandate of life in prison for 14 year-olds excludes the possibility of rehabilitation. Some people can change and the human brain only begins to really mature after age 16.
So is 21 years adequate for Brandon the shooter?  I'm going to say yes. Maybe. The prosecutor shows us his true nature starting fights in prison and his neo-nautzy affiliations.
Most disturbing was the schools total inability to deal with a Transgender child. The teacher who gave him the dress was showing true support but she gets fired for it! Really, it angers me.  His alternative classes to ""legal binding contract"" to remove behaviors that draw attention to his self-identity was gross negligence on the part of the school!  You can't have a legal binding contract with a minor miss teacher!  And such an agreement only acts to diminished his self worth and self-confidence at a time when it should have been encouraged and evaluated.
It's worth watching but there are no winners here only tragedy that I hope many others can learn from and reflect on their own biases.",1498003200,3,2900,4.394392523364486
8628986,4,B00H0EN9R0,This is insane. This kid is able to kill another kid and somehow the murder is blamed on the victim. I am speechless after watching this. How could our legal system fail this miserably? This is incredibly sad.,1491350400,8,209,4.526315789473684
