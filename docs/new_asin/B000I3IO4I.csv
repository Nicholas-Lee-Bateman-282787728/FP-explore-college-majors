Really good Sci-Fi Series though too bad that the DVD's are such bad quality anymore as everything else in the world.

Now I have to exchange it; can't return it since all of us are video pirates. I AM NOT BUYING ANYMORE DVD'S!!! They're either made in CHINA or made here with made in CHINA DVD's by underpaid people who can't speak English. Either way it's all CRAP!

We'll have to wait until after WW-III before we can get anything good again.",1298851200,,493,4.455555555555556
8143837,5,B000I3IO4I,I received by dvd's very promptly.  They were in excellent condition.  There was no damage at all.  I would not hesitate ordering from this supplier again.,1262995200,,155,4.884615384615385
8143838,5,B000I3IO4I,"Farscape DVDs are a must-have. It was the best drama on television and cancelled before it's time. Thank goodness we have DVDs available. A&E is coming out with a NEW box set in November 2009, so perhaps some of the compression issues on previous discs will be taken care of. This is one series that just does not get old upon repeated viewings. These sets are definitely worth the money.",1246752000,,388,4.557142857142857
8143839,5,B000I3IO4I,"I had to watch this series over a period of months that it took me to get it from NetFlix.  This is quite possibly one of the best SCIFI dramas to have ever been made.  It relied on good writing rather than million dollar special effects to capture its audience.  Get this series with the movie that ties it all together as a finale&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Farscape-The-Peacekeeper-Wars/dp/B0006FO9B0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Farscape - The Peacekeeper Wars</a>&nbsp;.  There is some discussion as to the quality of this particular recording but the series was awesome, do some research and see which release works for you, I feel this all-in-one-box release will take care of 90+% of viewers.",1195689600,10,746,5.754545454545455
