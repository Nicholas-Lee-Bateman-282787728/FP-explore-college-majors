8069717,1,B0009XT8R4,A fiend terrifies the city by killing one person after another. This is a B movie which should actually be a D. Its horrible. The acting is primitive and awkward. The fight scenes desperately need stunt doubles. The plot is silly and clichd. Viewing this movie may seriously damage precious brain cells. Don't go near it.,1498780800,,321,4.75
8069718,3,B0009XT8R4,"ALPHA VIDEO's A FACE IN THE FOG is typical of the fast-moving 1930s murder mystery programmers that were churned out by Poverty Row studios on a bi-monthly basis.

Here, a somewhat deformed murderer named ""The Fiend"" uses his trademark frozen bullets to ""knock off"" two cast members of a stageshow.  A lady reporter named Jean, her colleague Frank and goofy press fotog Elmer cover the story for their newspaper. After the show's star is murdered however, the play's author demands to be allowed to solve the case unassisted. Subsequent to a scuffle over some telephone trickery between Frank and an actor named Reardon, the Fiend makes an attempt on Jean's life, but his shot misses its mark. Reardon is arrested as the suspected killer, and then HE gets ""iced,"" too!

Comic relief Al St. John (Elmer) first worked at Mack Sennett's legendary KEYSTONE studios, in 1912. He later made slapstick shorts with his uncle, Fatty Arbuckle and Buster Keaton. Several of their classic silent comedies may be found on the marvelous DVD set,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/THE-BEST-ARBUCKLE-KEATON-COLLECTION/dp/B00006IUIU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">THE BEST ARBUCKLE/KEATON COLLECTION</a>.

ALPHA VIDEO is a provider of vintage movies, serials and TV programs, many of which aren't available elsewhere. Their prices are fair, but so is transfer quality of some of their offerings. None have undergone restoration, yet the market scarcity of their material and an honest price make these DVDs a worthwhile purchase.

This is a great example of Film Noir.  I love these old movies and you can't go wrong with this one.  Check out Ghost Breakers with Bob Hope - very funny.",1209254400,,306,6.794871794871795
