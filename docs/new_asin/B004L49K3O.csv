8433802,5,B004L49K3O,One of my favorite anime of the past decade.  Stage actress Anduki Mabou shines as the voice of Balsa.,1426809600,,102,4.368421052631579

8433804,5,B004L49K3O,"Excellent storyline.  For people who are tired of super heroes and appreciate a very ordinary one, this is for you.",1381708800,,115,4.75
8433805,4,B004L49K3O,"With interesting character designs usually drawn to insinuate evil leanings, but never come to pass. I like the female protagonist who's background revealed in great detail too. Buy both for a solid story to the end.",1364947200,,216,5.027777777777778
8433806,5,B004L49K3O,I already reviewed the first set so I'll just repeat what I said there.  This is one of my favorite series of all time.  It's based on a series of novels instead of the usual manga that inspire anime these days.  You can definitely tell as there is a good deal more character development and story complexity than you'll find in standard fare.  The fantasy world is well developed to the point where there are distinct cultures in the various countries explored throughout the series.  I highly recommend this one.,1364428800,3,514,4.666666666666667
8433807,4,B004L49K3O,Bought both part 1 and part 2.  Awesome anime with a great story line and characters.  Absolutely recommend this anime. You won't be disappointed.,1340755200,4,146,5.041666666666667
8433808,4,B004L49K3O,Great anime to watch!  The extras are almost non-existant.  This Blu-ray was authored so that your player can remember where you left off automagically.  I would rate the anime 5 stars and the disk 3 stars.,1312761600,2,206,4.666666666666667
