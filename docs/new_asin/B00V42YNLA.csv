7076298,5,B00V42YNLA,Anything about John Denver is great!  A nice bio with a sad ending.,1433376000,,67,4.153846153846154
7076299,5,B00V42YNLA,"This lovely production touched my heart.  To hear his voice and ballads again brought back fond memories,",1433289600,16,105,5.176470588235294
7076300,5,B00V42YNLA,"Singer/Songwriter John Denver died in 1997  at age 53  in a self-piloted experimental airplane. I knew Denver for his music and really liked his early folk material, just after he left the Chad Mitchell Trio. I have to honestly say, I lost interest in him in the mid-1970s because of what I considered a homogenized sound. (Yes, its subjective.). And I knew very little of his upbringing (son of a tough-love Air Force pilot)

Denver (he real last name was Dutchendorf  the same last name his two adopted children have) is still heard today on the radio on adult contemporary pop music stations, but son one in the US ever made a biography of him (to my knowledge). It too the BBC to create and present the story of Denvers life, and while his many fans will probably think the 58-minute film is too short (it never even mentions his film career, including two Oh God films with George Burns), its the right length for old folkies like me to learn more about the man  and see some wonderful (though short) archival performance clips of Denver with the Mitchell Trio and performing with Bill and Taffi (Fat City) on their composition Country Roads. And it was the BBC that first gave Denver a six-part TV variety show series and we see excerpts here as well.

The interviewees are all the import folks. Annie, his first wife (who filed for divorce in 1983), his second wife  an Australian singer  who he married in 1986 (and was divorced four years later), Peter Yarrow (who, with Paul and Mary took Denvers Leaving on A Jet Plane to the top of the charts), Jerry Weintraub (Denvers manager) and Denvers younger brother.
Im fairly sure that this 2013 film did not air on national PBS in the US,. It may have aired in regional markets. The DVD does include some interesting outtake interviews. There are eight of them for an additional running time of 11 minutes.

So, if you are a big Denver fan, youll definitely want to see this DVD. If you know him from his early folk years I think youll like too. I know I did.

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.

7076313,3,B00V42YNLA,It's a good film. I've never owned any John Denver records and am not really interested in his music. I have been to Monterey California and that is a very beautiful town!  I like to get PBS films from the library and am interested in music and that's why I watched this. The movie is not super in-depth. Good overview and use of an hour. I'm not in love with the film and that's why I'm rating it three stars. You can ask your local library to order a copy if you would like to see it.,1487462400,,486,4.010309278350515

7076320,5,B00V42YNLA,"Ok, so I'm like one of the biggest fans of John Denver there is.  The first non-classical album I was allowed to own was of John Denver and I wore that LP out!  When I saw this documentary on PBS about his life I went searching right away to find a copy.  He was for sure not your cookie-cutter Country singer, and in fact didn't consider himself a ""Country"" singer.  He sang about life, nature and had a silly side to him as well.  I consider him much more of a singer/songwriter.  The documentary does a wonderful job of showing you who the real John ""Denver"" was and it's such a shame we lost him at such a young age.  Even if you're only a casual JD fan you still will love this DVD.",1482710400,3,687,4.082089552238806

7076329,5,B00V42YNLA,"This documentary was airing on PBS.  I wanted to see it from beginning to end.  It is a really good documentary and worth the few dollars that it cost.  I will watch it a few more times and then probably donate it to the library.  I loved it.  For those of us who were teens and 20-somethings during the Vietnam War era, this documentary chronicles the life of a remarkable man who was well know during the late 1960's and through the 70' and 80's.",1467676800,5,448,4.223529411764706

I learned some things about John that I did not know and the songs that he sings and the scenery in the video are just beautiful.  John Denver had a voice like no other and watching this video is truly amazing.  His untimely death is very sad, but I am happy to say that his wonderful music will live on for years to come.  I have watched this video already countless time and have not tired of it at all....it makes me smile every time I see it.

7076339,4,B00V42YNLA,"I watched this with a dear friend. I had given this as a birthday gift, and the recipient invited me to watch it with him. We both sat enthralled the entire time. I had seen something like it on PBS, years ago, then enjoyed it all over again this time. John Denver was ahead of his time in a number of ways:  excellent singer and musician (yet humble), ecology-minded, visionary. I am aware that John had a problem with alcohol; then again, doesn't everyone have at least one personal issue to deal with in life? John was able to keep on making spirit-touching music, despite his personal problems. Would highly recommend this video to anyone interested in John Denver's music, lifestyle, and the way he created a life for himself. Why are there not more folks in the USA embracing more of the issues that face us now? Are we afraid to speak up for the environment, for a better and simpler way of life?  Can we be as proud of ourselves as John Denver had the right to be proud of himself? COME ON, PEOPLE, get real!!! At least, buy and watch this video, and find out how the simple life, accompanied by uplifting music, may well be the better choice!",1450915200,2,1151,4.4245283018867925

I think he will always be underrated as a singer/songwriter and should have been given much more respect. The scathing reviews gave me pause, he didn't deserve them while selling gold records and having sold out concerts.
I wish there was a little more on his family and life off stage but I still enjoyed it and it made me download 3 of his songs after I watched it.
Having Calypso wake me up today as my alarm almost made me smile. ; )",1445385600,13,698,4.17037037037037
