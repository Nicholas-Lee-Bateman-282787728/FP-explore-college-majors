3701828,3,B001MVYUZ2,"The non-Biblical history is generally informative, no question about that. However, the first program, Exodus, has nothing to do with the Bible's Exodus. According to their liberal views, Ezra (about 500BC) returned from Babylon and gathered all the myths and traditions and fables of the Jews, to compile these ""stories"" into the Jewish Bible (OT)... Meaning: none of it actually happen, according to this documentary, i.e., Moses did not lead the Israelites out of Egypt with a might hand, Joshua did not command the conquest of pagan Canaan, David was just a little half-baked clan leader, Solomon's was a virtual nobody, and his temple was a little shack. Thus, in the second program, Diaspora, in keeping with the first program's notions, and after the destruction of the temple, Yochanan ben Zakkai felt free to change the need for actual atonement sacrifice to expiate sins to a do-it-yourself acts of kindness; he changed many other such biblical injunctions, thus resulting in Rabbinic Judaism. Again, the history that follows in subsequent programs detail the high and lows of this synthesized religion. Reflecting on this method of ""worshipping"" God, that it, making it up by reason and consensus, one can understand how the Bible would be interpreted as myths... or lies by some. As for me, I don't accept this... So, I was greatly disappointed with this revised view of ancient Israel's history.",1261785600,47,1408,5.126086956521739
3701829,5,B001MVYUZ2,"The documentary ""The Jews"" is a very entertaining and educational mix of narrative description and historical re-enactments. This is a vibrant and poignant history of a fascinating people.  The persecutions repeatedly suffered are also accurately documented, but the focus is as much on Jewish diversity and the contributions they made to society.",1261353600,16,347,5.673076923076923

8322195,1,B001MVYUZ2,"Disappointing.  I'd hoped this would be a concise historical overview of Judaism and the Jewish people.  Instead, it's laced with the opinions of ""experts"" with more of this ""perhaps"", ""possibly"", ""might have been"", ""could have been"" kind of language that characterizes liberal academics.  Looking at the index, this could have been very informative.  If I were to take all this to heart, I would finish the video knowing less than when I started.",1386288000,,447,5.082191780821918

8322198,5,B001MVYUZ2,"It's 2 dvds full of information and it's very interesting and fun to watch.  A friend of mine had to read ""a short history of the jewish people"" and she said she found the book too boring and didn't understand all the things that it was describing.  So I got her this and she loved it.  She says she's now able to read the book and understand better.",1330128000,6,350,4.117647058823529
8322199,5,B001MVYUZ2,"Sometimes popular perceptions are formed within the limitations of a single event, a memorable individual, or even the ""Book"" of the tradition.  That seems to be the case of rightly interpreting the ""history of the Jews"" as if the Hebrew Bible is sufficient unto itself to explain the history of a people.  That notion becomes even more distorted when the scantiest knowledge is restricted to occasional readings or ""lesson"" drawn from the Old Testament scriptures in the Protestant ""Holy Bible.""

What is needed is a comprehensive, though selective, recounting of the those events, those individuals, and their writings to inform responsible inquirers of the rich and long history of the the Jews.  With the research and the technology for presentation, Nina Koshofer's visualized narrative of episodes in the history of the Jews offers a remarkable and responsible interpretation of ""a people's history.""  The settings, the readings, the production make ""The Jews"" one of the most effective sources for an understanding of this rich and remarkable story.",1311811200,6,1056,5.337349397590361
