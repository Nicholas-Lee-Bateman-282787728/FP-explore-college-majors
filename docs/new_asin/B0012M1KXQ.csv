Talk, talk, talk.
Words,words,words.
Only a few  music performances.
No clips.
I read Quincy's bio book(trancelated in japanese), and that's enough about him.
DVD could show us more visualy about the man.",1213747200,,245,5.447368421052632
8246825,5,B0012M1KXQ,Absolutely amazing interview with Q and many excellent performances. A love fest with many endearing and frank memories which illucidates the world of music in our time and the cultural environment around it. A truly great and compassionate human. He's a man who obviously loves people as much as they adore him. Mesmerizing!,1204243200,2,325,5.150943396226415
