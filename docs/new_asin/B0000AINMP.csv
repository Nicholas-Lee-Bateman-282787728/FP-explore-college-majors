It is a fun watch in the ilk of the other cartoons released that year on Cartoon Network.
Olive The Other Reindeer.
I liked it because I work with kids in the hood. Where I come from as well.
I think it is important for kids to see characters that look like themselves.

They stopped showing it.
It disappeared after the 2nd year & I wanted to have it to show every year to the kids
and for myself the big kid.

The story is simple & fun & is for all kids.
I like the fact that it has a hip-hop feel.
It's kind of cheesy but then again aren't songs like the heat miser song & put one foot in front of the other lol.
To get it for the ridiculously low price I paid is a steal.

I ripped it to am Mp4 file & it is ready for my Christmas rotation on my tablet, my HTPC & on my laptop.",1352332800,3,871,3.8011049723756907
