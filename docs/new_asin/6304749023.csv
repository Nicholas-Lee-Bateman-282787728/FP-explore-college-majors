7878079,5,6304749023,"Not only is this video a great collection, it's also a great deal!  This VHS video (in standard play, non-stereo as it was recorded) features almost 1 hour and 25 selections including: ""The Man That Got Away"",  ""We Could Make Such Beautiful Music"" (Duet with Liza Minelli),  ""Get Happy"", ""There's No Business Like Show Business""  (With Barbra Streisand & Ethel Merman), ""S' Wonderful"",  ""Lover Come Back To Me"" ""Bewitched, Bothered &  Bewildered"" (Streisand) and the exceptional ""Happy Days Are Here  Again"" (Duet with Barbra).  Several more classic tunes.  This  collection does not include ""Over The Rainbow"" or  ""Chicago"".  The collection was released in 1995 from a show done  back in 1963 - when Streisand was only 21!  For fans of Judy, Liza or  Barbra, well worth adding to your collection.",957484800,15,797,5.023076923076923
7878080,3,6304749023,"Though not the best of her TV series (I prefer the ones with Rooney and Terry Thomas), this one does have obvious historical value due to Streisand's presence. Supposedly, Garland was intimidated by Streisand's  rising star, but treats her very warmly, and seems genuinely impressed with  the young star's talent. Garland's physicality with Streisand is touching  and they share some very impressive duets on medleys of their  hits.
Streisand's voice is gorgeous and her outfits ridiculous. Minnelli  is young and has a sweet air about her as she interacts with  ""Mom.""
The stuff with Merman is staged and phony (If you read  Torme's book, you know that Garland was not pleased with Merman's cameo  appearance.) and mercifully short.
Highlight -- Garland singing ""I'm  Always Chasing Rainbows"" (normally not one of my favorites, but  beautifully rendered here, not becoming overwrought as she was won't to do  in her later years.)",934243200,8,930,5.174496644295302
