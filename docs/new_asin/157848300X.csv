196501,5,157848300X,I thought this film is a must-see! It was very well written and if you've ever been on tour with almost any concert you can truely relate to each one of the charcters and the situations they were in. Even if you haven't this film will open your eyes! You have to see it for yourself!,975888000,,283,4.071428571428571
196502,5,157848300X,Acouple of year ago i was on the set watching this moive being made. It  was a lot of fun because the eara where they were filming was really was  created into a deadhead consert seen. I have seen this moive about 5 time  and i sitll watch it. This moive should have been bigger but there was not  a lot of money for advertisement. So see biggest and the best independent  film of a long time.,968371200,3,393,4.0519480519480515
196503,4,157848300X,"This movie has originality and interest. From the beginning you understand what it's all about, at the same time consisting of nothing but curiousity and anticipation. I could swear I saw my relationships in theres. What I  enjoyed best about the movie was the time in which it was set, which was  the core that made the movie the way it is. With tye dyes and a killer  soundtrack in a time of sex, drugs, and rock 'n roll, it is a no wonder  that Simon (devon sawa) became overpowered & gained a 'high' (no pun  intended) through the life of no responsibilites and lack of parental  control from his already disruptive relationship with his father and  stepmother. This movie is ""Dazed and Confused"" with the sympathy,  and ""Trapped in a Purple Haze"" with the authenticy. Great acting  by Tara Reid, who plays Simons girlfriend, and Eric Mabius, who I  personally loved in The Crow. The role of an instable boy who is finding  his way up the man ladder (through interpersonal relationships and drugs)  was a perfect role to a rising star such as Devon Sawa who is as versatile  as they come (i hear he is currently attending acting classes to improve  his skills; talk about ambition & dedication). 'This movie is a must  see if your ready to see a movie set during that incredible time when  tempations and pressures from friends overpower the influences of parents  and responsibilities.'...",967593600,12,1394,4.694214876033058
196504,5,157848300X,Very moving!!! Brought back memories !!! The actors were very good..I was very surprised that it didn't make it into the movie theaters...,1394582400,,138,5.043478260869565
196505,4,157848300X,"I bought this DVD because I am filling out my collection of Devon Sawa.  I like his acting.  Half way through the video
I thought it was a waste of money, simply because I lived through that era and I deal with addicts on a daily basis
in a volunteer capacity.  But then I thought maybe I am becoming jaded, an attitude I refuse to adopt. So I started
the DVD over and watched with a more critical eye. While the sad situation with the character played by Sawa
is typical, the redemption is not.  It has an alternate ending, which I am not sure I appreciate, but left me with something
to ponder, and I like that. It is a coming-of-age story, and I am prejudiced because I like Sawa, but having said that
it is uplifting because of the redemption he experiences. He and his family do not 'live happily ever-after', but they
do live ever-after happily.",1388016000,,851,4.333333333333333
196506,1,157848300X,this movie sucked.  the acting was awful & the characters & storyline were just so unbelievable.  snore fest zzzzz.  epic fail,1363824000,,126,4.904761904761905
196507,4,157848300X,"Movie was made a few years after J.Garcia died; I was 1 of the ""DeadHeads"" called to be an extra......turned out I'm the harmonica playing head in the campfire scene. I also, went to the Russian hill studio inS.F to do the singing in that scene.....I think they paid me 25.00 to spend a few days in the city & Marin Co. It was all spose' to be for fun...it was;met Tara reid & the Simon character. Finally, I get/got to see my name on the big screen---pretty cool huh?!?",1360972800,,470,4.233333333333333
196508,4,157848300X,"COOL MOVIE, REMINDS ME OF BEING A TEEN. THOSE GOOD OL'DAYS! I ALSO LOVE ERIC MABIUS THAT PROBABLY ONE OF THE BIGGEST REASONS I WATCHED THIS MOVIE TO BEGIN WITH.",1360713600,,160,4.366666666666666
196509,4,157848300X,"This movie is about the upper middle class boy being introduced into a world of sex, drugs, and rock-n-roll and his recovery from his addiction.  A real subject I have seen myself. What is scary is this could be your son or daughter.",1305936000,,233,4.4186046511627906
196510,5,157848300X,"Or so he thought. I really liked this story of a child being raised with making no choices of his own and what the ""damage of rebellion"" really caused to him. Then when he was able to make choices, they were bad ones. This is very true to life of children being raised in this kind of environment. I think that the only bad choice that Simon made was to involve himself in the drug scene of the hippies. All of the other choices that he was making was ""freeing"" him of his own bondage and the bondage of his family. Being freed of this bondage gave him the ability to ""remember"" the truth of what really happened to his mother. I do recommend this movie to anyone that has an open mind to see what choices were really being made.",1168646400,,729,4.177304964539007
196511,3,157848300X,"It's a story we've all heard 100 times: good boy goes to bording school, boy meets stoner, stoner takes him to hippie concert, boy makes new friends, does numerous drugs, then sells drugs, hates his father and step-mother, spirals out of control, and ends up in rehab. I couldn't decide if this film was for drugs, or against. Maybe the pros/cons of the whole scene. Overall the films story was half jam-band parking lot life, and half the ups and downs of the boy Simon. Even though I could relate to some things, overall I felt the movie was kind of a buzz-kill. No bands were actually in ""Around The Fire"" either. And no great acting to be found. The only ""star"" here was really Tara Reid (pre-implants). Overall decent for those who attend shows, but it basically just reminded me of countless losers I've known (meaning those who didn't know when to say when). Peace.",1127692800,2,872,4.596153846153846
196512,5,157848300X,"If you've ever been a fan of the jam-band scene, and still maintain some intelligence or vestige of sanity, you will vastly enjoy watching this film, again and again. Not for the soundtrack (which includes such classics as Marley, Dire Straits, Phish and Winwood), not for the actors (although there are some good ones), not for the 'authentic' lot-scene ambience. You'll love this movie because it is so unbelievably lame, you will not be able to stop laughing.

From the early scene where Andrew asks Simon what music he listens to, Simon replies ""what kind of question is that?"" and Andrew declares, ""That's only the most important question I could ever ask you,"" this movie is fully loaded with some of the cheesiest and most hilariously lame moments I have ever seen. Kate Matthews, the world's most unprofessional rehab counselor, flies off the handle with no more provocation than a little junkie 'tude, then laughs at Simon for ending up in rehab. Andrew comes out with lines like ""ALWAYS check the hippie pouch,"" and introduces Simon to guys who blow into conch shells to determine the future. A lot of guys in the movie dance with their arms above their heads, looking like complete idiots. Jennifer and Trace laugh uproariously every time Simon says something naive or stupid, leading me to wonder, was nobody else willing to be their friend before he came along? In this movie, hanging out with someone for two hours makes you a friend for life.

The best character in the movie is Kevin, Simon's ""demented friend"" who is in a wheelchair and at death's door for reasons that are never explained (outside of Kevin saying ""I had WAY too much fun""). He asks Simon about his experience at a concert, Simon replies, ""I can't put it into words,"" and Kevin counters sagely: ""You just did."" When Kevin starts strumming his guitar, entire drum circles fall silent so he can play original compositions like ""I Don't Mind Failing In This World""; creative works that make the Dude of Life seem like Mozart. He abruptly dies when the plot finds it convenient, leaving Simon - who has apparently hung out with him a handful of times - to bear the responsibility of scattering his ashes. Huh?!?

Add to this inexplicable flashbacks-within-flashbacks, the spectre of Simon's mother's death (also never explained; the movie suggests she had WAY too much fun as well), and a series of festivals and concerts during which you NEVER see a band or any musicians at all (except Kevin) and you have a film that will leave you scratching your head in puzzlement and laughing out loud at the ridiculousness of it all.

It's time to open the package!",1102377600,18,2636,4.786813186813187
196513,5,157848300X,this film is a great this cast wonderful and the story is good to. If you want to show your kid's the way drugs can hurt you then show them this movie. It takes time but there is a great message at the end of this film. if you like this movie then watch over the edge.,1091404800,,268,3.719298245614035
196514,1,157848300X,"This movie is crap.  It's annoying to watch.  Especially if you go to a lot of shows.  It's done so cheesily.  And what's with the faux mullet???  Even those with serious drug problems have better sense than to don a mullet!!  This movie is CHEESE!!  Sure this may be how some kids experience shows, but it's just done so poorly.  I thought it would be a somewhat decent movie after reading these reviews and especially since there was a real actress involved, but I was just so annoyed most of the time while watching this movie and I was also embarrassed to have brought it home. Definitely rent this movie if you are even thinking of buying it, but otherwise, don't waste your money.  HORRIBLE HORRIBLE LAME-ASS MOVIE ABOUT AN OTHERWISE FANTASTIC AND MAGICAL EXPERIENCE.  DON'T BUY IT!!",1080518400,4,789,4.6521739130434785
196515,5,157848300X,"I first heard of this movie while sitting in my friends garage passing around a bowl and watching the movie grass. I beleive around the fire was the second preview on this movie. I headed to the video store and picked up this movie right away. I watched it 4 times in the 2 days that i had it and then went out and bought it. It is a gem, this movie is a tale of a young man who discovers the joy and happiness of life on the road with your favorite bands. the soundtrack is amazing (features bob marley, phish, grateful dead and more). I watched this movie with my uncle, who was a ""dead head"" (which means he followed the grateful dead on tour) and my cousin who works with the band phish as a roadie. they both said that this movie is the real deal. it made me laugh, it made me cry and it made me think, not many movies have done all of that for me. rent this movie!!!!!",1069113600,2,874,4.0
196516,2,157848300X,"I heard this movie was really good. So I rented it because I go to alot of shows and know how the scene is. Well I popped it in and watched it, and I was really disappointed. First off the movie was pretty slow in some parts.... Another thing is yeah there's drugs there, but that's why you have to be smart and say no!! And it makes the scene look bad by centering the movie around acid!!!! Because there's not always that at shows, and now some dumb teenager is going to go to the shows because they watched Around the Fire and said ""Wow there's acid there!!!"" It's all about the music!!
I gave this movie 2 stars because Devon is hot, and Tara Reid is pretty cool too. Other then that the movie was terrible.",1063497600,,711,4.159420289855072
196517,5,157848300X,"This isn't your typical ""stoner"" movie.  Its still a stoner movie, but its deeper than any stoner movie I've seen.  Around the Fire is the story of a young man away from his family for the first time that experments with drugs for the first time in his life and realizes that when he's high, he no longer thinks about the torment memories from his childhood that fill his head.  Maybe it is your typical ""tennager doing drugs to escape personal problems"" movie, but its diffently one you should rent.  Most people like myself will find themselves drawn to his movie, somehow reminded of a certain time in their lives.",1025913600,,617,4.581818181818182
196518,4,157848300X,"Being a teenager i am going through this now, i loved the movie my main problem is that before i bought it i could only watch it at like 1am on stars. I can watch it over and over. It shows what teenagers go through and how drugs are in there life, personally i think most teenagers would love the movie. It shows that you can do drugs and have a great life, as long as you don't get out of control with it.",1002585600,3,407,3.857142857142857
196519,1,157848300X,"This movie has the worst script I have ever witnessed.  I feel sorry for the actors-- they tried to do their job, but what can you do when you have such BAD, predictable lines?  Excerpt: ""Are you okay?""  ""Yeah.""  .. ""I don't know who you are anymore, you don't even pay attention to me.""  ... ""You got caught.""  ""I totally did""  ""Yeah."" ...

196520,1,157848300X,"This movie is ridiculous!  I hope people don't take this movie serious, because it in no way depicts what touring from show to show is like.  This was a direct kick to the groin to any and all who like movies and enjoy really good music.  By the way I loved the kids haircut in the movie, it was the most obnoxious mullet I have ever seen",992044800,3,338,4.014925373134329
196521,5,157848300X,"Hmmmmm... you kinda get the impression that the makers of this film had some legal problems so they had to drop any reference to the jam band PHISH from the film - - so even though they're following a Phish-like band, with very Phish-like followers listening to very Phish-like music and smoking and dropping Phish-like stuff on a Phish-like scene you don't really hear the word PHISH that much...
Whatever the case, I kinda dug the film at first for the music - - lot's of that funky jam stuff... even some Dead, Meters, Bob Marley...  then there was the story... and of course you have the emotional tie in... at first this nieve kid liberated from a snobby boarding school making the scene, making friends, experiencing the music and drugs, then getting too deep and turning into this messed up acid head drug dealer at odds with his girlfriend and his Dad and step Mom - - eventually, the story goes from Rock and Roll to ABC after school special but overall its a pretty cool film... and besides, I don't even drop acid, and I've seen colors coming out of water fountain like that too !
Thirty some years after THE STRAWBERRY STATEMENT, HAIR and BILLY JACK, this is a film for and by the groovy people !",985219200,3,1208,4.490909090909091
