722443,4,630386550X,"The Glass shield held my attention easily. The cast was enjoyable, especially Boatman, who brought back memories of Magnum P.I.(Selleck's helicopter pilot and side-kick. I liked the combination of crime thriller with a message that leaves you feeling better about life, without whacking you in the head with a bible. The english subtitles are a neccesity for me. Bonus!",1343174400,,369,5.271186440677966
722444,5,630386550X,"Charles Burnett is one of America's most underrated filmmakers working today. Unlike his African-American contemporary, Spike Lee, he is not an outspoken personality in his own right, preferring to let the work speak for itself. In many respects, his films are self-aware in terms of social conscience as John Sayles' own work. As a result, Burnett also finds it hard to get his movies widely distributed. The Glass Shield was his attempt to reach a wider audience by having Miramax distribute it. Sadly, like Jim Jarmusch's Dead Man, it was subjected to the same lackluster release by Miramax head honcho, Harvey Weinstein and promptly disappeared.

Stylistically, Burnett is not as in-your-face as Spike Lee, preferring to let the content and the characters deliver his message. That's not to say his films don't have their own style-The Glass Shield is a well-shot movie (adopting a colour scheme that reflects Johnson's comic book fantasies)-it just doesn't cause unnecessary attention to itself.

There is an audio commentary by writer/director Charles Burnett and composer Stephen James Taylor. Burnett points out that the cops are conditioned not to trust anyone before they are sent out on patrol and this often explains their hostile behaviour on the streets. This is an intelligent, conversational track with lots of excellent observations by both men with some good stories told by Burnett.

""A Conversation with Charles Burnett"" is a featurette that alternates between clips from the movie and Burnett talking.

""Film Scoring with Stephen James Taylor"" explores this composer's creative process. He drew from all kinds of musical genres with Negro spiritual melodies as the score's heart. He also talks about the origins of key musical cues from the movie.

Finally, there is a theatrical trailer.",1126828800,10,1809,5.289198606271777
722445,4,630386550X,"This movie was done very well, Michael Boatman, Lori Petty, Ice Cube all acted the way they should for there parts. But then you have mean Michael  Ironside, who wants to put everyone through hell in the sheriff's  department. I thought that Elliott Gould was the only wimp in this movie,  he's the one who did not act real well in this film. But timely look at  racism and corruption in the sheriff's department as seen through the eyes  of African American rookie J.J. Johnson (Boatman). He realizes his own  department is framing a black man (Ice Cube) for a murder he did not  commit. Lori Petty who becomes Johnson's only ally on the force. ""THIS  IS A MUST SEE FILM""",941500800,5,672,4.4958677685950414

7854309,3,630386550X,This movie is frustrating the characters were constantly doing the wrong things to get them in trouble but the sheriff wasn't doing anything he was non-existent so it seems quite a bit unreal to me,1503014400,,197,4.6571428571428575
