4859894,3,B005QROJ0O,"This is a rather lukewarm collection.  Two of the episodes are average, one of them is painful, and the final one is stellar.  If you're a fan, you can't go wrong by buying this set, but this should probably be one of the final ones you get.

The Rebel Set is all right.  It's certainly not the first episode I leap to when I need my MST3k high, but it's serviceable.  It's a tale of three downtrodden individuals taking place in a bank robbery for a criminal mastermind... and of course, things don't go as they should.  For the most part, it's a torpid turd, trudging along until the final third of the movie.  It's also one of those movies that ALMOST works, and you'll find yourself watching it and forgetting to listen to the boys every now and then.  Because it has its own presence and almost functions properly, it shadows the riffing and is almost impossible for the guys to lift.  That said, check out the short, ""Johnny Goes to the Fair.""  It's a fabulous short, definitely one of my favorites.  I laugh until I cry every time I watch it.

Secret Agent Super Dragon is average as far as eps go.  It's a James Bond ripoff, which is all you need to know.  Although the premise sounds hilarious, the movie itself is just not very engaging.  Yeah, it's super lame; that's the problem.  It fails at being a humorously poor film in and of itself -- a quality that always makes for the best episodes.  That said, the constant jabs at the ""white-trash Q"" and rude protagonist make for a pretty good time.  Just don't expect too much from this one.

The Starfighters is horribly, horribly boring.  This is basically airforce propaganda masquerading as a documentary masquerading as a movie.  Refueling scenes take up roughly a fourth of the movie, and there's only so much Mike and the bots can say before you're taking a nap.  Furthermore, here's a case of poor product; I popped this pristine, brand-spanking-new DVD into my player and the darn thing skipped a total of 5-6 times.  Really, shame on you, Rhino!

Parts: The Clonus Horror is my favorite in this set.  The premise is that humans are cloned as organ donors for the wealthy.  It's downright hilarious!  The movie is just interesting enough to keep you engaged while the guys pop out one-line wonders.  This episode is a must-have!

All in all, I can only really recommend this set to the hardcore fan.  New MSTies are better off with Volume 2.",1221696000,6,2409,4.534883720930233

4859896,4,B005QROJ0O,"Opening Credits (Beginning Remarks):

This apparently is the final box set of MST3k DVDs from Rhino (not counting the re-release of Volume 10) before they hand over the reigns to ""Shout! Factory"".  And for their last offering, they've given us a very solid set, splitting its four episodes evenly between Joel-hosted episodes and Mike-hosted episodes.

THE REBEL SET

This film is about Edward Platt (Maxwell Smart's Chief) as the head of a gang of thieves.  With his superior intelligence, he has concocted a brilliant heist and has assembled a bunch of bad guys to enact his bidding.  His bidding involves a fairly convoluted plan with multiple train journeys, fake police disguises, armored car hold-ups, etc.

For me, one of the funniest running gags was the in-theater argument over whether one of the characters is portrayed by Merritt Stone (by the way, Tom Servo is right: the conductor is played by Gene Roth of ATTACK OF THE GIANT LEECHES fame, not Merritt Stone).  The discussion spills out into the final moments where the episode ends with a stupefied TV's Frank franticly flipping back and forth through multiple stacks of film guides trying to figure out which B-movie actor is which.  Ah, how difficult it was in those days before the Internet Movie Database.

SECRET AGENT SUPER DRAGON

SASD is one of those kinds of films that was made for MST3k.  It's an Italian spy film that's not totally unlike a cheaply made James Bond rip-off.  It's the story of a secret government agent who's pulled out of retirement for one final mission.  Not only has one of his former colleagues been murdered by an international crime ring, but there's a plot to poison untold millions with tainted chewing gum.  By the time the final reel has finished the evil schemes have expanded to include a smuggling operation which features Ming vases and mind-altering drugs.  I've seen this film multiple times, and I'm still not sure what all the different plot-threads have to do with each other.

As I indicated, this is the style of film that MST3k handles very well.  The story is ludicrous, the dubbing poor and the dialog silly.  The jokes from Joel and the bots make a funny situation even better.

THE STARFIGHTERS

This has to be one of the most boring films the MST3k gang ever did.  I'd be willing to wager that a good third of the movie is simply made up of US Air Force stock footage (almost entirely long passages of planes refueling in mid-flight).  And what isn't actual stock footage is as tedious as stock footage: dull-speaking talking heads intoning boring dialog at each other.

Usually extremely drab and dreary films like this are my least favorite MST3k episodes.  However, this time the jokes were energetic enough that I never actually got fed up with the movie.  What also helped was the mental leaps I had to go through to figure out how the producers possibly thought that an audience would be interested in extremely minor plot-points.  For example, the most exciting thing that happens in the film is a storm that blows several fighter planes off course.  That's it for excitement.  And it all happens off-camera anyway.

I hadn't seen this episode before, so I finally learned that the piece of music that the bots would hum in later episodes during extremely boring sections was actually some of the incidental music from this film.  (Well, I think that's a fun thing to know, even if no one else does.)

PARTS: THE CLONUS HORROR

PARTS is an interesting film.  One gets the impression that underneath the bad acting from the leads and the low production values there was a decent movie to be made.  (Apparently I'm not alone in that thought; the producers of PARTS sued and settled with the makers of THE ISLAND, which starred Ewan McGregor and Scarlett Johansson.)  There are also some good and accomplished actors in secondary roles: Dick Sargent, Peter Graves and Keenan Wynn.  But despite the film's strengths, the overall production is just too silly for words.

I hadn't seen PARTS since the initial broadcast on the Sci-Fi Channel and I had completely forgotten how funny this episode is.  I got a little tired with all the Peter Graves and Biography jokes, but everything else was absolutely spot on.  (The MST3k people had done a lot of Peter Graves movies over the years and I think they finally ran out of jokes.)

Stinger (closing thoughts):

Rhino's DVD collections of MYSTERY SCIENCE THEATER 3000 episodes is going out on a high note.  This is a great cross-section of genres and styles which I'll be happy rewatching.",1206748800,4,4559,4.805912596401028
4859897,5,B005QROJ0O,"This is without a doubt one of the funniest MST3K sets there is. All four of the movies stand up to repeated viewings, with the Rebel Set and Secret Agent Super Dragon carrying the bulk of the laughs. The Starfighters is made up of about 50% Air Force (Navy? Royal Air Dragoon?) stock footage, but the riffs on cold war military activity are strikingly amusing and the double entendres on in flight refueling methods (you know, sticking the fuel line into the other plane's fuel line) are downright hilarious, and, the scene is shown twice! (You can never have too much refueling footage, you know?) And coincidentally enough, I saw&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Island/dp/B000BO0LH2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Island</a>&nbsp;(which rips off the Clonus Horror) about a week before this set arrived. The Clonus Horror is actually not too terrible by MST3K standards, but after seeing The Island and then watching it, well, the comedy effect is greatly multiplied. I don't recommend this set to newcomers to the MST3K fold, but if you are a fan of any kind and have had some past experience with these compendiums, I think this one is certainly worth adding to your collection.",1204761600,2,1229,5.373056994818653
4859898,5,B005QROJ0O,"As a true lover of MST3K this was a find for me. I love the B movies with the commentary by Crow,Mike or Joel and the gang. There are references to events and people of that time period (90's and 2000's). I would recommend this to anyone who is looking for commedy with a silly,quirky edge.",1204675200,,290,4.196428571428571
4859899,4,B005QROJ0O,"This box set is made up of one lame MST- The Rebel Set.  I can't hardly sit through it the movie is so stupid, but make sure you watch the short before it Johnny at the Fair for more than a few chuckles.

Now on to the other episodes.  Both Secret Agent Super Dragon and The Starfighters are very good episodes both are more than funny enough for some good riffing.  Starfighters has some especially great lines in it.  Poopy suits anyone?

Last but certainly not least is Clonus.  In my opinion one of the best of the Mike Nelson era.  This movie is a colossal mess.  Whimpy main character, a super mario look alike, idiot female clone, and Peter Graves phoning it in.  There are some great lines in this that my buddies and I still quote regularly.  This one episode is worth the price of the whole box set.

All in all I highly recommend this set.  Three out of four ain't bad plus there are some pretty good extras as well.",1198800000,4,927,4.258620689655173

4859901,5,B005QROJ0O,"Another foray into the heart of bad-moviedom, but Mike Nelson and the crew.

4859902,2,B005QROJ0O,"I've got a few of the earlier offerings of MST3K and enjoyed them.
I understand these choices were not new episodes but the weren't the cream of the crop either- I guess it stands to reason that you package the better episodes first and the poorer ones later-Very Disappointed-Rich C",1196208000,3,283,4.68
4859903,5,B005QROJ0O,"After releasing a set of public domain episodes, it seems that Rhino has gone back to purchasing licenses to copyrighted MST episodes. The purchased episode in this set is PARTS: THE CLONUS HORROR, a Sci-Fi Channel effort which incidentally is the reason to pick up this set. Along with that we get two lesser-known Joel offerings and a Mike/CC era episode as well.

""The Rebel Set"" is a poorly done crime film turned to a good-but-not-great episode from the fourth season. It's mostly chuckle-worthy, but the real laugh-out-loud moments come from the chase towards the end of the film (""The heist is ended. Go in peace."") 7.5/10

Much better is ""Secret Agent Super Dragon"" a James Bond knock-off that adds great fodder for Joel and the Bots. I love the so-called action sequences (""Oh good, an action sequence...and it's over."") 9/10

What can one say about ""The Starfighters""? A flight film where nothing ever happens. It's the weakest episode in this set, but still pretty good, overall. I like the host segments where Crow is trying to call tech support. 7/10

Finally, we get to ""Parts: The Clonus Horror"", easily one of the strongest episodes of the Sci-Fi channel era. The jokes are really funny and the fact that this movie isn't too bad makes it more worth watching. Yes, it's plagued by a horrendous amount of Biography references, but there are still some great jokes scattered throughout, running at a pretty constant rate 9.5/10

In addition, there's some solid bonus material. For starters, we get theatrical trailers and another compilation of musical host segments. Also, there's a 15-minute interview with ""Rebel Set"" star Don Sullivan, which incidentally didn't catch my interest. Much better is the 10-minute interview with ""Parts"" director Robert Fiveson, my favorite extra. Here he talks about his influence with the film, his lawsuit with Dreaworks's ""The Island"", and his reaction to when the movie appeared on MST3K. Oh, and he also gives a small promotion about where to find the uncut theatrical version of ""Parts"" on DVD.

Overall: 8.5/10",1194307200,27,2065,5.005830903790088
4859904,3,B005QROJ0O,"In 1964 when ""Goldfinger"" was a hit with my classmates, I was 11 years old.  That's very young for all the boys in Sacred Heart School to be reading Ian Fleming.  I read all the Honey West novels and secretly preferred ""The Girl from U.N.C.L.E."" to the ""Man from U.N.C.L.E."" when the television series came out.  But that goes to show the whole James Bond idea was basically juvenile as the James Bond doll that was manufactured was one of the first action figures.  1966's ""Secret Agent, Super Dragon"" starred Ray Danton in a Euro-spy imitation of Bond that pales to the brilliant Richard Harrison starring ""Master Stroke"" from 1967.  Harrison also made ""Secret Agent Fireball"" and ""Ring Around the World"" which were excellent.  He was also better than ""Kommissar X"" was to be played by Tony Kendall in a series that also rivaled Bond made by a German director if I am not mistaken.  ""Secret Agent, Super Dragon"" out Bonded Bond with many gadgets and had its fair share of beautiful willing women and strong villains who wanted world domination by psychotropic drugs.  While a complaint of ""Master Stroke"" was that it was talky in comparison to ""Secret Agent, Super Dragon,"" at least it was more mature.  No offense, I had been a weird kid.  And the ""beautiful color"" as described in the blurb on amazon, was faded in the print used by Sinister Cinema and again there were splices and gaps where even important clues to the plot were obliterated or unheard.  ""Master Stroke"" was faded, but in better shape overall, but for some reason is no longer available as a DVD-R from amazon at regular prices, but, at last checking, it was available on Sinister Cinema's website slightly more expensive than amazon had made their product available, but nowhere near as expensive as it is selling on amazon as a ""used"" item.  Marisa Mell is cast in ""Secret Agent, Super Dragon"" as is the fabulous Euro-femme, Margaret Lee, among others.  The credits list it as ""a film by Roberto Amoroso"" but lists the director as ""Calvin J. Padgett"" perhaps another Americanized Italian name that, at the time, was fashionable as their work was sorely in competition from the States.  A lot of the information about these films from Sinister Cinema is sketchy, and I, for one, can certainly use a Euro-spy Guide.  Ray Danton lacks the sex appeal of Sean Connery or Richard Harrison, and does not have Harrison's also superior humor.  Danton's humor comes with the gadgets and girls and not by a flair for interpreting intelligent writing.  According to one source I did read, Richard Harrison, also a gladiator and a spaghetti western frequenter, only made three Euro-spy films.  That's really a loss.  The three that I saw were keepers.",1340150400,,2712,4.7935483870967746
4859905,2,B005QROJ0O,"This movie is fairly mediocre despite a great female cast, a capable lead, and a goofy but ok sidekick.  Decent villain.  The plot is kind of ridiculous though, chewing gum that makes the kids go crazy?  It's sort of like a spy version of Reefer Madness.

Still not sure what the New York in ""New York Chiama Superdragon"" has anything to do with, either - the only real named location is Amsterdam.

I give it two stars for not being a waste of time, but it's not on the level of Master Stroke, nor does it contain as memorable a character as Lady Chaplin.

Print is mostly acceptable, not fantastic.  There is a scene with a text reveal that is impossible to read due to contrast and color fading issues.  Other than that and a few scratches it's OK.

Thanks to Sinister as always for putting this one out.",1330646400,2,807,4.3624161073825505
4859906,4,B005QROJ0O,"[SECRET AGENT SUPER DRAGON - (1966) - Directed by Calvin J. Padgett]  Ray Danton stars as retired agent 'Super Dragon' and is reluctantly recruited for a final mission by the lovely Margaret Lee in this superior Eurospy entry that entertains without the usual downtime associated with this genre of film. Danton is one of the better Bond-like impersonators - he's in top physical shape and performs his fighting scenes and stunts admirably, without the obvious doubles used in most spy flicks. He's cocky, capable and competent in his role, which improves the overall film nicely. More action than talk-fest (I recently watched 'Master Stroke', another Eurospy film with Margaret Lee and Adolfo Celi, and found myself daydreaming during the incessant dialogue delivered in lieu of any real action sequences).

Adding additional adornment and eye candy are a bevy of comely Eurobabes - the luscious Marisa Mell ('Danger: Diabolik'), Solvi Stubing and Adriana Ambesi round out the curves in delectable 60's fashions and flesh for flights of fantasy. Action, adventure, foreign agents, exotic locales, beautiful femme fatales, poisoned chewing gum and some comedic moments insure this film shouldn't fall under your radar as a spyfreak, and Sinister Cinema delivers a decent (though in no way pristine) print with decent colors and contrast. Your assignment, should you decide to accept it - watch this film and enjoy yourself.",1322784000,3,1424,5.29646017699115

4859908,4,B005QROJ0O,"Episode 419: The Rebel Set with short Johnny At The Fair
How do you get the money you need without getting your hands dirty? Well if you're the coffee shop owner in this movie you simply get three of your down on their luck customers to hijack an armored car and make off with the money inside. Its of course hokey and very badly acted throughout. There have been better episodes but the crew does get some good laughs out of this one. The short is pretty funny as a boy is lost at a huge fair in Canada and plenty of laughs ensue. Favorite Line: ""Johnny feels dark hands pressing him onward, the voices in his head get meaner.""

Episode 504: Secret Agent Super Dragon
Here we have a special agent named Cooper who comes back for one more assignment. This one involves a confusing plot of some group trying to take over the world and there's also some deadly type of chewing gum they want to use in their scheme or something like that. Its a pretty badly dubbed and goofy film, the crew does do some of their best riffing from Season 5 in this one, love how they especially slam the agents sidekick. Favorite Line: The sequence where some villains are being scolded by their boss whose talking through a sensor in the table (don't ask), is totally hilarious.

Episode 612: The Starfighters
A bunch of pilots, a strained father/son relationship and loads and loads of flying and refueling footage. Thats about all there is to this movie, its like Skydivers only in color and with less plot. Mike and the crew do some good riffing though there are some dead spots, which is no suprise given the lack of material in the movi, but the good outweighs the bad. Favorite Line: ""Is your face odd, mishapened? Join the Air Force""

Episode 811: Parts: The Clonus Horror
From the '70's we have a camp of clones who are raised from birth and when the time come they are taken to America, or rather parts of them are as the rest of them are frozen. Basically these clones are for rich and powerful people so they can live longer. One of them escapes and could blow the whole operation which would effect the chances of a man (Peter Graves) being elected to the White House. Its actually not horrible storywise and was blatantly ripped off in '05's ""The Island"", but the acting really brings it down. Favorite Line: ""Dick Sergant is ""The Bionic Woman""

This isn't a bad volume, but if you're just starting out filling up your MST3K collection, I might recommend springing for a different one first - this collection is a little hit-and-miss.

- The Rebel Set: A crime film that produces a few good laughs, but nothing very noteworthy. The episode is worth watching, but probably won't stick with you for very long.

- Secret Agent Super Dragon: An amusing James Bond knock-off film, this film isn't terribly fun to watch, but the riffs are solidly amusing - just don't try to make sense of the plot! Probably my favorite part of this episode is when Joel and the bots write, perform, and riff their own music based on the movie.

- The Starfighters: Ugh, I'm not sure what to say about this one. Almost nothing happens in this movie - a huge portion of the film is just planes being refueled. I vaguely remember the MST3K crew saying once that the only reason they did this film was because they had nothing better to do that week, but unfortunately, nothing makes this tedious episode worth owning - it's almost painful watching Mike and the bots struggle through this episode.

- Parts, The Clonus Horror: Reminiscent of the modern&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Island/dp/B000BO0LH2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Island</a>, this episode is quite good - Peter Graves is featured in the cast of the movie of the week, and Mike and the bots manage to milk out about 300 references to the Biography Channel - all of them hilarious. This episode is really the selling point of this volume, and pretty much carries the entire volume single handedly.

4859912,5,B005QROJ0O,"Of all the experiments committed by mad scientists over the years, could there ever have been a more fiendish one than that performed by Dr. Clayton Forrester, who subjected innocent people to some of the worst movies ever developed?  Volume 12 of The Mystery Science Theater 3000 collection is further proof of Dr. Forrester's evil.

Experiment #1 in this set is The Rebel Set, which has Edward Platt (The Chief from Get Smart) recrujting some beatniks to commit a robbery.  It's kind of like Reservoir Dogs without the good writing or acting.  In addition, this one comes with the short subject Johnny at the Fair, which makes you appreciate the lack of short subjects before today's movies.

Experiment #2 is Secret Agent Super Dragon, a miserable James Bond knockoff.  The best that can be said about it is it's better than Experiment #3, The Starfighters.  You'd think with a title like that, it'd be a sci-fi movie, but instead it's a movie about a jet fighter called the Starfighter.  With long segments of airplanes flying to easy listening music and no plot or suspense, this movie gives Manos a run for its money for worst movie honors.  The pity is that it pretty much did in the career of Bob Dornan the actor, forcing the country to endure Bob Dornan the congressman.

Experiment #4 is Parts: The Clonus Horror.  The plot deals with a secret institution that raises clones for parts for important people; when one man escapes (the guy who played ""Chet"" on Emergency!), the secrecy is threatened.  If this sounds a lot like the plot of the recent movie The Island, this is no coincidence.  An extra feature with the Parts director discusses the lawsuit that resulted from the rather obvious plot theft.  Interestingly, the MST3K playing of Parts helped raise awareness of the similarities.

As usual, this is an excellent set to pick up and no MST3K fan will be disappointed by these episodes.  Keep them coming!",1231545600,2,1924,4.784848484848485

-The Rebel Set made this set for me. I very much liked seeing this movie in MST3K mode(really hard without MST3K) and Johnny at the Fair was a funny short. I think it is an underrated episode. I love the xylophone solo at the middle of the film where the crooks(let by Edward Piatt) put their stuff ""In the hole"" I could watch this over and over
-Secret Agent Super Dragon - A lot of people were clamoring for a Spy episode and here it is. When you are in the mood for a B movie spy non-thriller its a good viewing. Tom Servo's Secret Agent Super Dragon song is funny and Joel's invention was a hoot.
- The Starfighters - Mike Nelson said it correct, this movie had more nothing than any other film. Was this a movie or documentary or what was it exactly. This has the imfamous Poopie Suit scene and the jet fueling intercourse scenes which are riffled to death. Again, when you are in the mood to watch this you will enjoy it as opposed to just having it on. Sometimes the right mood makes watching these movies much better.
- Parts the Clonus Horror - a popular Season 8 episode with Mike & the Bots. This was my least favorite of this quartet. Im not into this movie as much as the others. Maybe a little more on the duller side. At least the Starfighters was unforgettably dull, this one was just not my cup of tea. Stil a popular episode among the MST scifi fans.

8483676,5,B005QROJ0O,"""The Starfighters"" has nothing to do with Japanese TV or science fiction; it's a plotless, pointless 1964 snoozefest about Air Force pilots, starring future Congressman Bob Dornan. It's a movie that would be unwatchable without the riffing by Mike and the 'bots, who turn it into one of the series' funniest episodes.

""The Rebel Set"" is a pretty good 1959 heist picture with the riffing front-loaded onto the movie's opening (and completely gratuitous) ""beatnik"" scenes. A coffee shop owner-slash-criminal mastermind ropes three losers into helping him pull off an armored car robbery.

""Secret Agent Super Dragon"" is a low budget James Bond ripoff so tedious, it makes ""Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy"" look like an action movie, and ""Parts: the Clonus Horror"" is a 1979 thriller in which a clone is hunted after escaping from an organ-harvesting ranch.

8483678,1,B005QROJ0O,absolutely garbage picture quality poor story uninteresting not my idea of a secret agent fights for want of a better word are poorly choreographed and two of them are in the dark so you can hardly se what is going on although im not sure if that is a good thing james bond inspired many spin off movies this is not one of the best,1420243200,,331,4.107692307692307

8483680,5,B005QROJ0O,"What can I possibly say about MST3K?  It's hysterically funny, it's smart, and I can't get enough.  I'm thrilled with this collection!",1393804800,,134,5.045454545454546
8483681,4,B005QROJ0O,"I actually think the Rebel Set isn't that bad of a movie.  It has the Chief, disguised as a priest, so that's a winner right there.

Secret Agent Super Dragon isn't very good, as you would expect, but I do love the Tom Servo version of the song.

The Starfighters.  Well, it has B-1 Bob Dornan in it.  Take that as you wish.  Was the point to make you want to join the Air Force?

I really know that the Clonus Horror wants me to feel bad for the poor clones, but instead I feel bad for Peter Graves in doing this movie.",1366070400,,520,3.9902912621359223
