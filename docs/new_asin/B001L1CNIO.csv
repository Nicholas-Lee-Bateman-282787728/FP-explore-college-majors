8316803,5,B001L1CNIO,"I loved this series as a little girl and even carried around a white stuffed animal cat I named Sonja.  Now over 20 years later, my 2-year-old daughter can enjoy one of my favorite shows as a young girl.  Even though some of the clothes, cars, and other items definitely look like the 80s, the stories are just as cute as ever and my daughter loves watching them.  I even still enjoy watching them even though I hadn't seen any episodes since I was a kid.  Adults could relate to some of the humor in the episodes.  It's touching to see your child enjoy the same shows you liked as a kid.  I would definitely recommend this product!",1407542400,,632,4.313559322033898

8316806,5,B001L1CNIO,I absolutely loved this show as a kid. Was really hoping my kids would enjoy just us much. Well they don't..at least not as much as I do. If you liked it when you were younger then it will be fun to revisit a Saturday morning fave.. and good luck getting the theme song out of your head.  :),1278892800,,291,3.9322033898305087
