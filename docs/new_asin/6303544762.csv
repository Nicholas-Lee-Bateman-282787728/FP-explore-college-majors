Mork And Mindy (Vol 3.)
As funny and humorous Robbin Willaim is these 2 particular episodes stood out. In mixed emotions Mork gives you the basic instinct of real emotions. A he toch base with a rainbow of characters from happy the anger. Being that Mork is from another planet, by the way did I mention Orken's refuse to have emotions. It shows how talent Robin really is. Only a simmaly here; but it is the same genius mind that ""Andy Kaufman"" shows in ""Taxi"". Nevertheless, mork finds out that love is what true emotion the blance all emotions.

In ""Stark raving Mork"" its Mork that finds out don't do Everything you see. Understanding reason is one of the many mystery of living with the human race. Like in any realitionship it not only give and recieve. He finds out the lesson again is that Love is the basic element to spice up any renewed fresh relation.",1126483200,,1124,4.504901960784314

This video showcases Willams different  characters and Mork's early attempt at romance. It is quintessentially  Robin Williams at his nuttyness and funniest. Combined, the two episodes  make a fail-safe pick up on your bluest days.
Although M&M are still  in their platonic stages at this point, there is a developing attraction.  While the flirting is subtler than many today's sitcoms, it is still  detectable. Devoted fans of the show (such as moi) know what will  eventually happen, but find the subtext absolutely delicious",962582400,5,773,5.015748031496063
