8181073,5,B000NQRV4Y,"I thoroughly enjoy this movie over and over. I love Stuart Little. He's my hero because tho he may get down, he doesn't give up! I also like the fact that he is concerned about others. Yes, I know its a cartoon, but the writer's story lines are always encouraging to me. I'm a lifetime fan!",1424304000,,290,4.196428571428571
