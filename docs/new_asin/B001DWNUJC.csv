And that is what i wanted - in this helltown of asphalt and concrete, this BRD is a welcome respite.",1277078400,,265,4.541666666666667
3541654,1,B001DWNUJC,"I just wanted a relaxing beach scene video but this is not what I got; it's more like animal planet.

The other blu-ray called ""Hawaii Beaches1"" in blu-ray is way better at 5 stars.",1272585600,,181,4.323529411764706
3541655,5,B001DWNUJC,"I love the idea behing Sunrise Earth. No music, no talking, just natural sounds.  Sunrise Earth was shot with HD in mind which makes these DVDs spectacular. I only have stereo speakers, but they do have a setting for surround sound which I can only guess would make the experience more enjoyable.

There are 4 discs, and disc A is both my least and most favorite.  The first selection ""Island First Light"" is truly about the sunrise and there really is nothing else that happens. (Not that that is a bad thing, I just enjoy the movement of nature such as birds stirring and other creatures beginning their day.) The second selection ""The Great Barrier Reef"" is my favorite showing both above and below water shots.

The other 3 discs, have a good variety of activities happening at sunrise and are a joy to watch as well.

If I have any disappointment with the DVDs, it is that there is no ""scene selection"" so if I want to pick-up the video at any particular moment the only option is to fast-forward to where I left off.

I certainly hope that there will be another Sunrise Earth series coming soon.",1245024000,6,1101,4.507537688442211
3541656,5,B001DWNUJC,"I've been a fan of Sunrise Earth since I discovered it a few years ago on Discovery HD.  Back then I used to try to save as many episodes as I could on the HD cable DVR.  That proved to be stressful because HD shows eat a lot of space, even with the external hard drive. It was hard to decide which ones to save and let go.

Now it has arrived on Blu-ray in all its 1080 HD glory. On my Sony 46"" LCD, the shots look slightly cleaner on disc than they do on the channel (no compression or pixelation).  It is 5.1 surround-sound camera mic recording too.  Great photos on each disc in the collection too.

When there's a movie or a show you really love, nothing's better than owning a physical copy of it in the best resolution possible!

They is another collection called ""Sunrise Earth:American Sunrises""! It was released in late 2007.  I will be looking forward to getting that one on Blu-ray too.  For some reason it's DVD format-only at most places except the Discovery website.

This is nature as it was intended - no talking, no music other than natures own.  Great way to unwind, mellow out, take your shoes off and CHILL. You will feel like you are at each location for the whole duration of the sunrise.",1238198400,23,1211,4.314159292035399
3541657,5,B001DWNUJC,"Sunrise Earth is really a great idea. Packaged Environments have been available in the past on sound and video recordings. The absence of narration is the key attraction. Many wonderful nature and wildlife documentaries have interesting voice-overs but when I'm watching and hearing a gorgeous bit of scenery, the commentaries often seem Superfluous and even rude. I began enjoying Sunrise Earth shows on HDTV and filled up my DVR every other day. I bought my first set on DVD and got the Seaside collection in BD and it is one of the reasons I got into Blu-ray.
The episodes are all a bit less than an hour each; they start at first light and continue as the local lights up with the sun. Some of it is jaw dropping but much is subtile. I have seen better A/V quality on things like Planet Earth but the quality is excellent and the content is truly unique. There are almost never people in the picture. Just nature. The sound is only Dolby Digital but it is good enough to put you in the picture. If you like nature you'll find these a great experience. I have a lot of discs 'like' these; but Sunrise Earth gets played the most.
Also available on DVD, HDDVD and BD and single episodes are available. Check you HighDef TV programing and catch a few. Read about it on Wikipedia at [...]",1236038400,7,1287,4.480851063829787
3541658,5,B001DWNUJC,What a great blu-ray disc for relaxing and dreaming of retirement watching sunrises. You won't be disappointed. Resolution and audio outstanding. Would like to hear 7.1 audio though.,1234051200,,182,5.535714285714286
3541659,5,B001DWNUJC,"Sunrise Earth is an unusual program... films are without background music or narration, only sounds are those which naturally occur on location at the time of filming.
As another reviewer pointed out it is NOT a documentary.
It is an incredibly immersive and relaxing experience to watch these films, especially in blu-ray. It is something like video meditation, best enjoyed alone in a quite place. The first time I saw this on TV I thought, Who would want to watch this for and HOUR?!!!
But if you want to watch something to unwind with after a tough day this is the best programing available.
There are other collections available on blu-ray also that highlight other locations.",1232928000,6,681,4.879310344827586
3541660,1,B001DWNUJC,"I Bought this with excitement expecting a High Def feast
like planet earth or similar..but how wrong i was !!
So whats wrong with this series ?
1..It is painfully slow to change the picture you will look at the same scene for a minute or two before it changes sometimes..very frustrating
2..There is no dialogue just nature sounds very faint also at times
so for me it just not watchable so i'm  selling it
Some may ask then what does he like..well heres the nature blu-rays i own an like
Planet earth...excellent
Ganges...excellent
Wild China...excellent
galapogos...excellent
scenic national parks(yosemite,grand canyon,yellowstone) ...all excelent
Africa the serengeti...excellent
Alaska spirit of the wild...excellent
the Alps..excellent
earth  the biography ..very good
so unless you are prepared for an extremely slow moving series i suggest you buy some of the above instead",1231718400,16,881,5.3768115942028984
3541661,3,B001DWNUJC,"I'm a big fan of the Sunrise series.  I'm waiting for the release of Asia and Europe.  I own the America Sunrises as well as the Ancient world.  This one fits in the middle. Ancient World is boring, America's is awesome.  The Seaside I expected more beach sunrises in cleaner locations.",1231200000,11,286,4.549019607843137
3541682,5,B001DWNUJC,I enjoyed the Sunrise Earth broadcasts so much and was sorry they went off the air.  These  intrepid videographers take us to some of the most amazing places on our planet and we can watch them coming to life.  It helps me ease into my day and wind down from the frenzy.  So pleased when I found the box set available and in perfect condition. Order processing and shipment with this vendor was convenient and timely.,1381536000,,417,4.447368421052632
3541683,5,B001DWNUJC,"UPDATE:  All 83 episodes of Sunrise Earth are now available streaming through Compass Light.

This set contains episodes from the TV show Sunrise Earth, which used to air mornings on Discovery HD Theater (now the Velocity channel), perfect to watch with a cup of coffee. These are not ""picture window"" videos. These episodes are designed to show you a specific place as the sun rises as if you are actually there, no narration, no music. Just the sounds of life as you would hear it if you were standing there. I love this set of beautiful waterside places.
I also noticed that a new Sunrise Earth set&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sunrise-Earth-National-Parks-Blu-ray/dp/B00CS7PHPQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sunrise Earth: National Parks [Blu-ray</a>] is coming out. I hope Gaia will release other sets especially Sunrise Earth International episodes shot in Asia. The episodes ""Li River Cormorants"", ""Ping An Rice Paddies"", ""Elephant Trunk Park"" and ""Japanese Garden"" have never been released and they were some of my favorites. Thanks Compass Light, Gaia and Discovery for these great programs!",1375660800,,1143,5.7976190476190474
3541684,1,B001DWNUJC,I saw a few of these when they were on HD cable TV and there were many times when it said the sunrise was coming up over the Pacific while watching it on a California beach.  That is IMPOSSIBLE but the scenery was beautiful.,1368057600,,224,4.090909090909091
3541685,2,B001DWNUJC,I got this because I thought these Blu-ray disks would be in HD....it was deffinately a very big disappointment for us.,1364601600,,119,4.714285714285714
3541686,5,B001DWNUJC,Really enjoyed this a lot and I think you will too. Features various beautiful scenes from across the country at sunrise.,1359417600,,121,4.809523809523809
3541687,4,B001DWNUJC,I just like the quiet and pictures of the scenery- It is a nice change when the weather gets gray and damp!,1355702400,,107,3.909090909090909
3541688,5,B001DWNUJC,"This is a Bluray of various sunrises in a beach setting. I like to put this on when company comes over or when it's too cold to go outside or when I just want something on in the background that doesn't require attention.

Its' basically just what the title says, sunrises. On the seaside. How that's a confusing title to some people I don't know. There is no music. It's not something I could picture myself sitting down and 'watching' watching, but it sure is nice to have on in the morning when you're getting ready for your day or hassling with the kids before school. If you live in a setting with snow, you will appreciate the beautiful scenery and daydream of being on a tranquil beach somewhere, away from it all. There's one sunrise where you watch a surfer girl prepare for her morning surf. I thought that was kinda cool, because you would probably be staring at her if you were actually on the beach that day.

I bought this Bluray used for $20, and I think $20 is about as much as it's worth. So if you can get it used, I would suggest that rather than full price. All in all, this is a relaxing way to start the day or nice to have on when company comes over or when you want to take a break from all the over-stimulation that's normally on your television. Worth purchasing for around $20! Happy with product.",1327708800,5,1324,4.313253012048193
3541689,4,B001DWNUJC,"Don't get me wrong, I loved it, the Image and sound quality are excellent. But as others reviews stated, the title is deceiving. When you name a DVD ""SEASIDE COLLECTION"" and you put a palm on the Cover, people are inclined to expect those to be shown. This DVD is NOT about sunny beaches, but about other locations ""by the sea"". That actually made it better for me, because I got to watch footage of places by the sea that I don't regularly do, but I give it 4 stars only because it is using a kinda ""fake"" marketing tool to sell more copies (title+cover photo).",1285286400,4,562,4.311320754716981
3541690,4,B001DWNUJC,"I saw part of this series on television and thought to register for it when expecting my son: I wanted something I could put in to help me get through any wee-hours-of-the-night feedings! As it turns out, we really love this collection, as do my babysitters and my now 6-month-old son. I actually thought to leave this review because I'm on Amazon shopping for another in the series, or something similar!

The photography and settings are beautiful, and the sound is inobtrusive and lovely--just whatever bird, water, or other ambient noises were present during filming (or so it seems). When I'm home alone with my son, I love to have this on in the background while we play. It's wonderful to have a window onto some distant shores.

I'm leaving this just 4 stars, because I actually only tend to watch about half the scenes. Those featuring seals have a bit too much... barking... for my taste. :)",1282780800,2,901,4.69620253164557
3541691,3,B001DWNUJC,"Hey guys, I absolutely love tropical scenery with palm trees and seeing the cover to this Bluray is what made me want to buy it. Now I am in the marketing business so I know sometimes you do not get what is advertised so I did my research and read the description a few times to see what to expect. Well, I found it really cheap ($16) on amazon and decided to get it. It comes with 4 discs that have 2 different sceneries that last about and hour and a half each. I was somewhat disappointed because only 2 out of the 8 sceneries had palm trees in it and they were only shown for a couple of minutes in each. The whole reason I got it is to stare at palm trees, but thats not what I got. I still watch it though because the sand and water shots are really beautiful. The image and sound quality is great. I am glad I got it for the cheap price that I did, because to me it isn't worth paying regular price or above $20. If anyone knows a similar high quality video with alot of palm trees that they would recommend, please let me know.",1277078400,5,1035,4.004830917874396
8295205,5,B001DWNUJC,"Some years ago, when the format war between HD-DVD and Blu-ray was still going on, we had out first HDTV.  Our cable company provided us some HD broadcast for a while.  One of them was Discovery HD Theater (which I don't think we have in the basic lineup anymore).  There were times when we take a close look at the screen to see how detailed the background was.  Even though our first HDTV was 720P and 1080i, it still looked pretty doggone good.  One of the shows we've seen, although very little of, was ""Sunrise Earth"".  I thought I would check out that HDTV program to see if it's on DVD (that was before I got my first Blu-ray player).  Well, at the time, it was exclusively released on HD-DVD.  Some reviewer of ""Sunrise Earth"" said that he would like this ""boring"" documentary to be released on DVD (which would happen not too long afterwards).  And then there came a time when Sony (the one who came up with Blu-ray) won the format war.  Which meant that the companies who had released movies on HD-DVD had to start releasing them on Blu-ray.  It also made me decide to get a Blu-ray player so that I would be ready to view the discs whenever I get them.  Besides that, I got my first HDTV, which I still have as of this writing.

It wouldn't be until May of 2016 when I got my first ""Sunrise Earth"" set.  The reason why I got the ""Seaside Collection"" was that I saw ridiculous prices on the Amazon Marketplace (it was over $65(!), but now it looks as though some sellers are charging about $20).  But, thank goodness, there was at least one Ebay seller who was selling them for less than $20 (that included the shipping charges)!  I thought I might as well get it while they're still in stock.  So I did!  By the way, if you try searching ""All Departments"" on Amazon, it's possible to find this set on Blu-ray for as much as what I paid for.  I've just watched this set for my first time.  The TV I have, by the way, was by the same company that made HD-DVD (Toshiba!).  It has 720P, but I'm fine with that (that's the best I've seen on 26-inch sets).  I've managed to appreciate the picture quality of the show.

Each episode lasted about 51 minutes, which is long enough.  I could watch 2 episodes, which would be 1 Blu-ray disc.  This ""boring"" documentary is good for taking it easy.  It can also be educational when you read the captions.  The bottom part of the captions would contain the trivia, so be sure you read that first before it would fade away.  And besides, whenever the captions do appear, the title, time and location would appear as well.

The other blu-ray releases I've found worth watching, as well.  Besides the Seaside Collection, I also like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sunrise-Earth-Sunrises-of-the-Ancient-World-Blu-ray/dp/B0049KRC7Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sunrise Earth: Sunrises of the Ancient World Blu-ray</a>.",1464220800,,2902,4.723107569721115
