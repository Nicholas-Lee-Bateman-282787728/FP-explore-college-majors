2014877,1,B0001LYFJ0,"This DVD has attractive packaging, well designed menus and good background on the animations....BUT viewing the shorts is difficult. They are mostly grainy, dark in contrast, and some are so damaged they are painful to watch. There has been no attempt to restore these films on any level and the prints are as rough as I have seen in ANY silent era film on DVD currently available. The music score makes no attempt to compliment the action, but it's just honkytonk piano playing random songs in the background.  I give this DVD 1 star for content and historic value, but for viewing enjoyment, its a dud.",1089417600,20,604,4.69811320754717
2014878,4,B0001LYFJ0,"This DVD is a good introduction to Felix the Cat, a cartoon character that has been around in one form or another since the 20s.  The first 8 or so cartoons on this DVD are in black and white and are amongst the earliest Felix the Cat cartoons made, meaning they are silent and black and white.  The later cartoons are color.  All are public domain.",1087948800,2,349,4.257575757575758
8014572,5,B0001LYFJ0,Some of the reviewers of this DVD are very confused/mistaken. The DVD pictured contains 10 b&w cartoons from the silent film era and a couple of color cartoons from the 1930's. There are NONE of the cartoons produced for TV in the 60's or later. NONE!,1469923200,,251,4.478260869565218

8014574,1,B0001LYFJ0,"If you grew up in the 70's, like me, then you are probably most faliar with the Felix The Cat cartoons from the late 1950's, which featured the characters of Rock Bottom, Poindexter, and The Professor, it was in color and had the Felix The Cat Themesong, and Felix had a bag of tricks.
Yeah, well, this IS NOT that Felix. Looks like that Felix, but its silent, 1920's I estimate. No bag of tricks, no charachteres, no Felix song, no color. It sucks I say !!",1425513600,,457,4.264367816091954
8014575,5,B0001LYFJ0,"Hey, what's not to like? It's ""Felix the cat, the wonderful wonderful cat..."" Hilarious- loved these as a kid, and now I'm enjoying them all over again- 55 years later!",1417651200,,168,4.633333333333334
8014576,2,B0001LYFJ0,"I decided to get this thinking that since it shows color artwork on the cover that it would reflect upon this DVD having some of the cartoons by Felix that we come to know and love.  Unfortunately only the last 2 cartoons were in color and, the rest were really really old and primitive black and white animations that only either a die hard fan of Felix or someone old enough to actually remember these cartoons would enjoy.  If you are looking to buy any Felix DVD for the fun, entertaining and colorful cartoons that made Felix as popular as he is today I think you would be far better off instead buying the 1958 or later cartoon series.",1222473600,3,641,4.378151260504202

8014578,3,B0001LYFJ0,"This DVD mostly contains the Felix cartoons in his middle years (1924-25). This is probably a good choice, as recent DVDs tend to focus on either his earlier or later years. One highlight is the classic ""Felix In Hollywood"", where Felix aims to have a career in the movies. There are also a host of movie stars appearing in this cartoon (albeit in animated form), including Douglas Fairbanks, Ben Turpin, and Charlie Chaplin (he's impossible not to miss).

The quality of the silent shorts are acceptable considering their age, as these are probably the best-looking PD versions available. Despite the print damage, it is still watchable. What I don't like about these silents is the added music. With the exception of ""Felix Finds Out"", all cartoons have stock jazzy musical scores. These may sound authentic and fit into the era of these cartoons, but they just don't fit into the action, leaving some of the gags in ""mid-air"".

The DVD also contains two of the three colour Felix cartoons produced by the Van Beuren studio. It's not the Felix we know and love, but it is nice to see them included. However, the picture quality of these cartoons is poor. There are better looking prints available, with full original titles. It seems that Delta didn't look further into the PD archives enough.

The DVD presentation isn't one of the best, but when you consider the rare silents included in this DVD and the price, the complaints does sound rather petty. It is a worthwhile purchase.",1119312000,9,1484,4.811764705882353
8014579,4,B0001LYFJ0,"The music accompanying 7 of the 10 cartoons is not just SOME honkeytonk piano player.  It is the incomparable JELLY-ROLL MORTON & HIS RED HOT PEPPERS! (16 tracks) There are also 4 tracks by Morton's Trio.  All 20 Morton recordings date from 1929-30.  They start with ""Mint Julep"" and ""Mississippi Mildred"" from a session recorded 11-13-29 and end with ""Crazy Chords"" recorded 6-2-30.  Musicians in Morton's groups include Red Allen, Albert Nicholas, Barney Bigard, Paul Barbarin and Zutty Singleton.  The sound quality is exceptional for recordings of that time; very little surface noise.  The cartoons themselves mostly date from 1923-25.

Granted, the music has no direct relationship to the cartoon action but I found it greatly enhanced my enjoyment.  Such uplifting, fun music.  Different music was used on ""All Puzzled,"" ""Golden Goose"" and ""Neptune.""  Had Morton's music been used on all 10 cartoons I would have given 5 stars.

If you own other Felix dvd's, turn off that horrible organ music and put on some 1923 King Oliver or other early 1920's instrumental jazz recording.  You'll be amazed!",1116115200,24,1103,5.134831460674158
8014580,3,B0001LYFJ0,"Delta Entertainment's Felix collection is titled ""The World's Most Wonderful Cat"". It consists of eight silent, black-and-white cartoons created by Otto Messmer for the Pat Sullivan studio between 1923 and 1925, and two sound/color cartoons directed by Burt Gillett in 1936. They are all Felix classics and most of them are not available on other DVD collections.
  The quality of prints used for the Delta collection varies greatly. ""Felix Goes West"" is remarkably good, ""Felix Gets the Can"" is acceptable, and ""Felix Monkeys with Magic"" is barely viewable. The Gillett-directed cartoons are available, in better condidion, on the GoodTimes collection.
  The music selected to accompany seven of the silent classics sets a good Roaring-Twenties atmosphere but often does not match the action on the screen. ""Felix All Puzzled"" has a post-production music track which does not work any better and has deteriorated in sound quality with the passage of time. Original music, written to fit each cartoon, would have been more effective.
  One cartoon, mistakenly titled ""A Felix Comic"", is actually ""Eats are West"" from 1925. The words ""A Felix Comic"" frequently appeared on closing title cards from the silent era.
  Shortcomings notwithstanding, this is a good collection of classic Felix and comes at a good price. Buy it and see for yourself why Felix really is THE WORLD'S MOST WONDERFUL CAT!",1089936000,3,1394,5.247747747747748
