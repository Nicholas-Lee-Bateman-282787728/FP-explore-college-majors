8087613,5,B000BJKWPI,"Complete video of crew news conference following the first manned moon landing mission, Apollo Eleven.  Also features very attractive artwork on cover of DVD case.",1395878400,,163,5.52
8087614,5,B000BJKWPI,"I am disappointed that this DVD is receiving such poor reviews, because many are failing to realize that this is the opportunity for any fan of the moon missions to have a part of history in their own personal library.

The DVD has no commentary against the landings.  It is simply an historical account of the press conference, where we hear perhaps the most words said by Neil Armstrong about his mission than any other place in recorded history.  Any fan of these three men should get this DVD.  I think you can buy the Sibrel DVDs for less if you go straight to the website: [...], but I ordered mine here.

The three men go over the mission in detail, beginning with the lunar insertion and continuing from there.  They then take questions from the press.  It's very well produced.  I give it five stars for it's historical value, and it's 'unedited' production by Sibrel - who left it as it was with no commentary.",1212537600,6,920,4.5
8087615,5,B000BJKWPI,"Take a look at the posture as well as the facial expressions of the three Astro-Nots of the cover. Do they look happy to you?  If I had just come back from the ""Moon"" I WOULD BE ECSTATIC..or at the very least, smiling! Wouldn't you?

But no, they look like they're ashamed  to be there; ashamed to have taken part in deceiving the American people.

Take a good hard long look at the three men pictured on the cover, and their body language.

It will tell you what they couldn't.",1202601600,7,478,4.266666666666667
8087616,5,B000BJKWPI,"THE PROBLEM IS THIS: 40+ YEARS (AND MILLIONS OF HOURS) OF MEDIA SAYING THE MOON LANDINGS WERE REAL, AND ONLY A FEW YEARS ARGUING AGAINST THEM.

So everyone coming to this film has had years of being told the official line. That's a lot to compete with and a lot to flush out of the brain.

Just imagine if the USSR (Russia) had carried out the moon landing.

Imagine the dent in US national pride. Well if Bart SIbrel had then come along and accused the USSR of faking the landing.

The US support would have been in the majority - 'of course Russia did not land on the moon' everyone would have chorused.

The problem is that most people see such an historic event, an event that has come to be seen as 'man's' greatest achievement, through political filters.

No if Russia had done it, becuase we don't WANT them to have done,

or YES if the US did it, beacuse we'd WANT that.

Looking at the evidence presented in the films, and looking at the official responses, and debunking, the case for a faked moon landing is over the 1/2 way mark - so its more likely that it was faked than real.

I suggest you watch his films for yourself, and decide for yourself, and try not to let any preconcieved ideas filter what you see.

An interesting fact: When the Soviets managed to build a system that could track rockets from the earth to the moon, the remaining 3 Apollo missions were all suddenley cancelled.",1168128000,10,1403,4.382239382239383
8087617,1,B000BJKWPI,"On the back cover of this DVD, there is passage from Adolph Hitler's Mein Kampf which is known as the Big Lie Section.  While do not see how this passage relates to the moon landing hoax or the Apollo missions in general, I would guess the director/producer wants you to believe that NASA is promoting this huge, colossal and outrageous lie with this press conference and everyone just sheepishly believes it.  Except for those few brave souls, like director/producer Bart Sibrel.  Regrettably, there is nothing to indicate that crew or NASA is lying to the public.

On this DVD, the viewer is treated to the first press conference given by the Apollo 11 crew after they were released from quarantine.  In this hour and half press conference, the crew briefly and sometimes technically described their adventure to the moon, on the moon and then back to Earth.  Afterwards, they answer questions from the audience who are primarily members of the press.  Throughout this press conference, I was extremely hard pressed to find anything that resembled a lie or even a simple dodging of the question.  In fact, I noticed quite the opposite.  These men looked extremely happy, maybe a bit tired, about their great accomplishment.

What would have helped the viewer understand the proposed Big Lie scenario is some sort of commentary from the director/producer after each DVD section describing how or why he feels that the crew is lying.  Or maybe he just can't do it, because personally, I couldn't see anything that was amiss.

In the end save your money and buy a book or another DVD because the feature does not show the crew perpetuating some colossal Hitlerian lie.",1139788800,5,1667,4.872340425531915
