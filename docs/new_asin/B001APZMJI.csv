I would have bought it if they had. Now I'm not even interested in renting it.",1500076800,,381,4.162162162162162

All of them, from the nearly 16 yo boy to my 8 yo daughter, enjoyed it and thought it was a really good movie. My daughter said she liked it because it was very loving and adventuresome and had happy parts and sad parts and it was funny. I think they took seriously Jodie Foster's character's OCD/ agoraphobia, and it wasn't something that was milked of laughs, but was shown to be something that was really limiting for this person.  They liked the animals, and the combination of fantasy and reality.",1455840000,,592,4.431192660550459

3456933,4,B001APZMJI,"Released in 2008, Nims Island stars  Abigail Breslin as the 11 year-old title character whos alone on a remote pacific island while her Dad (Gerard Butler) is late coming back from an expedition. Nim emails a reclusive popular adventure writer (Jodi Foster) in San Francisco for help.

Im a sucker for island movies and this ones quite good but, for me, its hindered by its childrens adventure/fantasy approach.  Im talking about the Disney-esque animal shenanigans. Apart from that, however, everything clicks for a fun island adventure. While kid-oriented, there's enough here for adults to enjoy, particularly for those who are in tune with their inner-kid. It was a modest hit when released.

The movie runs 96 minutes and was shot in Australia.

3457043,4,B001APZMJI,"Forget the fact that the whole time I watch this all I can think is the timelines and how unlikely some of these occurrences would happen all so very quickly, its a cute movie. My daughter really seemed to like it when we rented it a few years ago. We found a great price for the dvd here on amazon when we were looking for some movies that gave us a feeling of spring/summer with the dull-ache of a never ending winter. Nim's cute relationship with the animals, and her know-how of navigating the island was a nice change to some of the wimpy girl movies my daughter used to watch. We love movies that show strong female roles.",1396310400,,628,4.285714285714286

3457046,5,B001APZMJI,"Nim's Island is a nice little kid's film and my grand kids thought it was pretty cool so I at least did not come out on the short end of the stick on this economical collection that includes the classic Princess Bride and Tom Hank's cutest role (outside of Woody of course).  These are separate blu-rays for each movie and The Princess Bride includes the DVD as well.  Kudos to Mr. Hanks cuz the kids thought Big was a riot and they absolutely loved it...to the tune of watching it over and over again for the last week.  Of course they want that darn piano keyboard!!!!!
They thought The Princess Bride was kewl and thought that the Grandfather telling the story had a great voice (so Peter Falk will always knock em dead...).  At any rate you can't beat the price and even Nim's Island has Gerard Butler and Jodie Foster for gosh sakes.  The transfers are wonderful to boot.  You can't go wrong here.",1394150400,,902,4.4363636363636365

3457048,5,B001APZMJI,"It is hard to ""review"" a movie because it is totally subjective... but this is really a great movie.  I love the story and I am a Jodie Foster fan.  So that helps.  It's lightweight, no deep story lines to follow, but that's ok.  Sometimes we just want to be entertained, right?  I found it worthwhile owning.  I think it would be appropriate for most ages... no nudity, but intense themes on occasion.",1394064000,,402,4.438356164383562

3457078,4,B001APZMJI,"When I saw the cover of the movie the kids had chosen, I thought, oh no: talking animals on a magical island. But instead, I was treated to some wonderful action and adventure, both comic and suspenseful; an idyllic and picturesque film, inviting you back to the romance and innocence of childhood.

But there's nothing old fashioned about it. The main characters meet via email, linked by satellite phone from the mainland to a secret island location.

The filmmakers seem to have aimed for somewhere between Raiders of the Lost Ark, Cast Away, Dead Calm, and Home Alone; with a little bit of Crocodile Dundee and Tin Tin thrown in. But somehow it works. If you liked any if those movies, you'll like this one.

But it's the three lead roles that make it all gel and really happen. I'd watch it again, maybe even three times, just to watch the sparkling performances of each of the three lead characters.",1378512000,,905,4.64375

3457082,5,B001APZMJI,i liked this but u should not require a narrative if you r using a star system.  it will prevent me from rating in the future because of time,1376092800,,141,3.8620689655172415

3457110,4,B001APZMJI,"One point for adults considering this movie for family viewing: Sometimes kids' movies can be tedious for adults to sit through, and other times they're fairly enjoyable for everyone. If you like the two movies I mentioned in the title of this review, you'll likely find this movie fun viewing. There are several striking similarities:

1. Most notably, Jodie Foster (Nim's Island) and Kathleen Turner (Romancing the Stone) are both successful female novelists who write adventure stories centering around a handsome and courageous Indiana Jones - type hero whom they are more or less in love with, whether they want to acknowledge it or not.

2. They are both somewhat agoraphobic, not wanting to leave their safe and quiet homes to venture forth into the big, uncertain city (San Francisco for Foster, New York for Turner).

3. Both are driven to do just that by the desperate beckoning of other female characters who are both facing some sort of peril.

4. Both women find themselves pushed to their limits and forced to face their fears by the cocky yet charismatic male leads (Gerard Butler in Nim's Island and Michael Douglas in Romancing the Stone).

5. Both Swiss Family Robinson and Nim's Island involve families living on remote tropical islands in highly sophisticated yet somehow pleasingly Gilligan's Island-ish treehouse dwellings.

6. Both SFR and NI have animal-to-human interactions that make it seem that the animals are on a par with the humans in terms of IQ.

7. Swiss Fam and Nim also include the buccaneers/pirates-invading-our-island subplot complete with organized island-defense strategies involving rudimentary weapons ""manned"" by animals.

There's definitely nothing in Nim's Island that kids can't handle, and little girls will find it especially thrilling to have the rare opportunity to watch a young girl be the center of an honest-to-goodness movie adventure. So if you like Romancing the Stone and Swiss Family Robinson, Nim's Island is probably a safe bet for all the parents out there who can't stand the thought of another noisy and mindless animated feature.",1363219200,,2096,5.180473372781065

Just imagine what it would be like if you lived on a private island and then someone tried to turn it into a vacation destination. This is the problem Nim faces when her father is lost at sea. She finds very creative and funny ways of getting rid of all the people who are invading her island. To kick things up a notch Jodie Foster also plays a agoraphobic author who learns to have her own adventures instead of just writing about them. Can she help save Nim and find Nim's father? First she has to get up the courage to leave her house! The only problem with this movie is that it makes you want to run away to an island immediately. Kids who watch this movie may also want a tree house! Last but not least, the animals in this movie are amazing! Well, except for the sharks. That is really the most scary part.

3457145,2,B001APZMJI,"Okay, I saw this movie and was pretty disappointed. The storyline is that this young girl is visiting her father on island where he is a researcher of some sort. He gets lost at sea, and the girl, alone on the island, must do what she can to survive and also locate her dad. She communicates with a writer, played by Jodie Foster.

Now, don't you think that this guy, being a man of science and living on that island for some time now, would have been astute enough to see that there was a storm coming and to not go sailing on that particular day? Also, this island has a mountain on it which is quite steep and treacherous, yet, this girl walks up and down it as if its a 12 foot hill.

The Jodie Foster character is an agoraphobic who hasn't left her apartment for months, yet she is able to find her way to the island in a matter of a couple of days, when she has never heard of it before, and only has a vague idea of where it is located. I didn't understand why she was in the movie anyway. I thought her character was going to help the girl find her father, but that wasn't the case.

It insulted my intelligence to sit through this one, and avoids the one-star designation because I like the cast and there are a few cute sequences when the girl interacts with the animals on the island.",1303257600,,1295,4.151394422310757

3457147,3,B001APZMJI,"My three children have all read Nim's Island at some point and loved it so we decided to check out the movie and purchased it for Christmas this year.  I should clarify this review is based on our love of the book, which is short and could have easily been made into a movie without changing it.  Well, Hollywood was lucky (or unlucky) enough to get the wonderful Jodi Foster and Gerard Bulter (who are both great), however, it ended up causing them to change the story completely to ""satisfy"" the big names.  While the book focuses on Nim's life on the island (her daily routines and getting food etc), her relationship with the animals and her relationship with Alexandra via email, the movie does none of those things.  It instead, focuses on the big stars of Jodi Foster and Gerard Butler and creates a dialogue between her character Alex Rover (Butler) and the extra-reclusive Alexandra (Foster).  I don't think they had much of a choice landing such big stars, they had to use them but it totally changes the story in the book.  The most endearing aspect of the book is the wonderful relationship of Nim and Alexandra via email and Nim and her animals.  Those relationships are diluted down and lose all potency as we are forced to endure the Alexandra's (Foster) agoraphobia/social anxiety disorder and have Nim endangering her animals by flinging them in a catapult?  What?  I am not an animal expert but I would consider flinging your ""pet"" a hundred yards in a wok-catapult is abuse!  So in summary this has the characters of the book but doesn't follow the story there.  Nothing is the same as the book save for the very beginning and the very, very end.  So if you are looking for a cute story and nice acting but don't expect this to follow the story then it is worth watching, as for us, we wanted the book relationships not a study on the psychology of overcoming agoraphobia!  I was going to list all the differences of the book versus movie but it would be everything!  They even changed Trop Tourists and their interesting hats to Buccaneers and gave their unlikable tourists a lot of screen time.  Too bad really.  Hope that helps!",1294617600,,2150,4.603674540682415

The Princess Bride is undoubtedly a classic. It's full of humor, adventure, catchy lines, and lovable characters. A must see for all ages.

Big has been a favorite of mine for years. Tom Hanks does a great job acting in this movie- (he's supposed to be a boy who is granted his wish and has grown up over night). Big is a lot of fun and sweet.

Nim's Island is different. I enjoyed this movie, but it's not an absolute favorite by any means. It's a decent kids movie and has a bunch of excitement thrown in throughout. The style of the movie and plot kind of threw me off (while at the same time most of it was predictable) and the imaginary character and other events had me rolling my eyes sometimes, but it's worth watching a couple times... maybe.

Recapping the plot of ""Nim's Island,"" which is based on the novel by Wendy Orr, is no easy task.  Suffice it to say it involves the unlikely meeting of two people from opposite corners of the world:  an eleven-year-old  girl named Nim (Abigail Breslin), who lives, ""Tempest""-like, all alone with her biologist father (Gerard Butler) on a small island in the South Seas, and a writer of popular adventure novels (Jodie Foster), living in San Francisco, who's afraid to leave her own house.  The fourth major character comes in the form of a floating incarnation of the author's signature creation - an Indiana Jones-type adventurer (also played by Butler) - who periodically appears out of thin air to offer sage advice both to the writer and to the young girl stuck on the island.

While ""Nim's Island"" earns some points for putting a young girl and a middle-aged woman up-front-and-center in an action scenario, the movie, as a whole, is a bit too cutesy and corny to be of much interest to an adult audience.  It works too hard at being clever when what we really want is for it to settle down and tell a halfway believable story (even for a fantasy, this one unduly strains credibility).  Instead, what we get is an assortment of lovable animals doing stupid pet tricks and Foster emoting away as if her life depended upon it.  Yet, ironically, the scenery-chewing performance by Foster is probably the best thing in the picture, since at least we get a few laughs out of this neurotic agoraphobe/germaphobe finding herself suddenly and reluctantly living out a real life adventure of her own.

For a far better take on this whole literature-come-to-life thing, my advice would be to set your course for the truly wonderful ""The Fall"" - or even the less impressive ""Inkheart"" - and paddle away from ""Nim's Island.""",1279411200,,1824,4.780254777070064

As he searches for new species of plankton, she roams the island with her friends:  a bearded lizard, a white pelican, and a sea lion.  She is a voracious reader, and one of her all-time favorite authors is Alex Rover, whose tales of adventure and escape in exotic locations rival those of, say, Indiana Jones.

One day Jack heads off for a 2 day collecting trip, and leaves Nim behind.  At the same time, Alexandra Rover (the real Alex Rover), who lives in San Francisco and suffers from agoraphobia (an acute fear of public places), emails Jack as part of her research into how Alex Rover can escape from being thrown into a volcano.  Nim replies, thrilled that she is communicating with the famous Alex Rover.  But when her father doesn't return from his collecting trip, and she injures herself in checking out the island's volcanic crater for Alexandra Rover's book research (she thinks she is talking to the REAL Alex Rover), Nim asks for Alex Rover's help.

But Alex(andra) Rover can't even go out the front door of her house to collect the mail.  What can she do?

Add to this Nim's adventures with the buccaneers, Jack's experience in the cyclone, and Alexandra's attempt at international travel, and you have an adventure!

Nim's Island works because of the strong performances of Abigail Breslin (Nim), Gerard Butler (Jack AND the imaginary Alex), and Jodie Foster (Alexandra).  Jodie Foster in particular brings a well-polished level of anxiety and comedy into the plot that allows the story to stretch for a full 90 minutes.

It will just be for himself and Nim.  Uh-oh, what happens when Nim grows up and decides she wants someone else besides Daddy?  Is Jack going to approve?

In fact, the whole question, and its incestuous implications, gets sidestepped as the adventure begins and instead of reaching out, as Brooke Shields did for Christopher Atkins in The Blue Lagoon, for a peer's love, Nim instead is forced to summon Jodie Foster of all people!  Well, not exactly Jodie, but the image of her favoriote fictional hero, Alex Rover, not realizing that Alex Rover is a woman.  This is one of those pictures where the ground keeps shrinking, and it's like SLEUTH in that it turns out that everyone is played by a tiny number of actors.  As we watched NIM'S ISLAND, it took the one of us who had misplaced her progressives upwards of 90 minutes to realize that Gerald Butler was playing both Nim's real Dad, Jack Rusoe AND the male version of Alex Rover.

Is the movie a journey for Jodie Foster to admit her femininity and learn to love holding hands and romping on the beach with Gerald Butler?  We needed a whole new movie that showed us what happened when Foster meets Butler.  They are two splendid actors, but they can't bring love at first sight to life without a slightly better script.  Scenes with Abigail Breslin and Jodie Foster were like some bitter version of a child star growing older and more and more out of touch with the real.  Rusoe = sounds like Rousseau from LOST, the Frenchwoman who prowled the island crying out for her lost daughter.  Also sounds quite a bit like Crusoe, like Robinson Crusoe.  Notwthstanding what a weird Freudian romance it becomes (and what about that mother, swallowed by a whale but apparently monitoring Nim's progress in some spiritual way), both Butler and Foster deserved to get the Oscar and the scandal is, they didn't even get ""NIM-inated.""",1262908800,,2087,4.635869565217392

I would actually have been happy if more of the movie had been filmed that way.

Anyway, the plot development was interesting, and is in my opinion worthy of family viewing.

I liked the dual role played by Gerard Butler (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Timeline-Widescreen-Edition/dp/B0001I55OC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Timeline (Widescreen Edition)</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Phantom-of-the-Opera-Full-Screen-Edition/dp/B0007TKNIS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Phantom of the Opera (Full Screen Edition)</a>) and the psychotic reclusive OCD writer role played by Jodie Foster.

You can read about principals and producers on the website and check out the narrative here on Amazon and elsewhere, so I'll highlight Selkie the sea lion, whose name suggests mythic Celtic and Scandinavian shape-shifting seals, the pelican named Galileo for free-flying conveniently natural GPS wherever you are (even on a remote island in the South Pacific whose inhabitants aspire to not being found by anyone ever), and Freddie the bearded dragon.

Especially as an artist and dweller in a coastal desert I love the tertiary color palette of the film - but what else would you find in an island setting? - along with relatively sparse though essential special effects. Patrick Doyle's wistfully fresh music fits perfectly. Concerning becoming the hero of our own stories, in this film, literally Berkeley-bound by agoraphobia Alexandra Rover (think about the implications of possessing a name like ""Rover""), Jack Rusoe the dad and Nim his daughter all deal rather predictably with their own stuff as circumstances, the needs of others and more than a hint of irresistible grace push them into new dimensions. All three principal characters are tightly caught in their own self-defined world (since the dad in the story was wearing a wedding ring, I assume he'd been widowed) and for sure every one of us is most of the time, but how do those liminal, transitional moments marked by vestiges of what was and hints of not-yets and months full of fear, promise and future happen if by grace someone or something other than ourselves doesn't push us out of where we are?

I often find that movies targeted towards children are just as enjoyable for the adults, but ""Nim's Island"" might be a rare exception for me.

Which isn't to say that there isn't a lot here that is fun and light-hearted - described best as a cross between the ""Swiss Family Robinson"" and ""Home Alone"", young Nim captivates the screen as she fearlessly explores her island in her father's absence, and protects the pristine beauty of her lovely home from the littering tourists who threaten to encroach on their way of life. Nim is completely charming, wonderfully vivacious, believably vulnerable, and disarmingly likable. Her character is possibly one of the most independent, empowered depiction of a young girl in movie memory, and for that alone the movie is to be congratulated for filling a much needed void.

Foster and Butler, too, are superb actors - as always - and Foster's sympathetic portrayal of a frightened agoraphobic thrust into the big, scary world in a desperate plea to rescue a small, alone girl is truly beautiful. Foster carefully mixes bravery, fear, and anger in perfectly measured amounts, leaving audiences cheering for more.

Children will enjoy the 'castaway' lifestyle portrayed and the easy joy of being isolated and empowered on a gorgeous island with dozens of animal 'friends' to pass the time. Adults, however, may find themselves impossibly distracted by the realities of the situation - the movie, taken seriously, is portraying that it is somehow healthy for a little girl to be completely isolated from all human contact outside of her father (who keeps reminding her how much like her deceased mother she is), who is so ill-prepared for this task that he doesn't even have an ""in case of emergency, call..."" plan in case Nim is left alone in an island accident. Apart from the isolation, Nim is also poorly served in the lack of a serviceable education for the situation - she hasn't, apparently, been taught how to disinfect cuts, which would seemingly be a crucial talent in an area completely lacking in basic medical care. This completely unhealthy situation comes to a head when a young tourist boy finally comes face-to-face with Nim and proclaims, in horror, that she is all alone - a climax that is apparently then happily discarded when the designated surrogate mother washes up to keep Nim-and-Dad company. All I could think was the coming adjustment as Nim has to learn to share - for the first time in her entire life - her father's attention with another human being.

Of course, these concerns are not to be taken even remotely seriously - this is light-hearted children's fare, as close to reality as flying carpets and genii. Children will likely find the adventure charming and captivating, and adults can probably enjoy it as long as they never slip into the error of taking the movie seriously, and just remembering that this is fantasy in its purest form.

3457173,4,B001APZMJI,"Nim Russo (her mother ""invented"" the name before vanishing at sea, purportedly down the throat of a whale) has a life many kids might envy.  She lives with her father, Jack, on an isolated South Sea island where they generate their own power, grow their own food, connect with the world via satphone and satellite Internet, and get a visit from the supply ship every so often; no one but its crew is allowed to know their location, and no one including the crew is allowed to step ashore.  At 11 she's totally homeschooled (or ""island-schooled,"" as she calls it), mostly by way of the many books they order, and associates only with her father and her pets, including a sea lion, a pelican, a sea turtle, and a spiny lizard.  Jack is a marine biologist whose fixed obsession is the discovery of a new one-celled organism, to be named Protozoa Nim.  One day he heads out to sea in their little sailboat to see if he can find it.  Nim stays behind to rescue the little turtles about to hatch from her pet's nest.  When a sudden storm cripples Jack's boat and leaves him unable to communicate with his daughter, and Nim finds her island about to be ""invaded"" by Buccaneer Tours, it's up to her to find a way to fend off the outsiders.  For help she calls on Alex Rover, the world's greatest adventurer--who, unknown to her, is actually the creation of Alexandra Rover, a seriously agoraphobic San Francisco novelist.  But when Alexandra discovers that her new cyberpal is an 11-year-old girl left alone on an island and coping with a 5"" gash on her leg, she somehow finds the courage to conquer her fears and set out on a wild journey halfway around the world.

Nim, played by Abigail Breslin, is a child-heroine for today and one boys and girls alike should enjoy--cool under pressure, resourceful, self-sufficient and free.  Jodie Foster manages to bring Alexandra to life in a slightly over-the-top way, with an exaggerated sort of humor that's unexpected given her previous roles.  Gerard Butler plays a dual role--Jack and Alex, who's a combination of Indiana Jones, Richard Halliburton (see&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Richard-Halliburton-s-Complete-Book-of-Marvels/dp/051736770X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Richard Halliburton's Complete Book of Marvels</a>), and Lawrence of Arabia.

3457175,1,B001APZMJI,"Like any other genre, you can see some pretty bad films within the children's films niche. This ranks up with the best of the worst. The acting is ok, though Jodie Foster's attempts at slapstick tend not to come off that well -- I think she should stay away from physical comedy, if not comedy all together. And Abigail Breslin seems to have succumbed to the Dora the Explorer 'have all the characters shout their lines' method of acting. It has some not half bad camera work. What tanks the film is the writing/plot structure. It seems to be trying for the record for greatest number of active and unrelated or unfulfilled plot lines.

-- Jodie Foster plays an agoraphobic adventure writer who decides to venture out from San Francisco to a remote Pacific island, by plane, boat, and helicopter, to save Nim. But how Foster's bumbling appearance on an isolated island is supposed to help Nim in any way -- never mind help her save her father -- is beyond the plot conception: at no point does the plot actually believe Foster could help in any real way. And in the end, she has to be rescued by Nim. What then is the purpose of that plot line except for some lame slapstick? I don't do justice here to the irrelevance of Foster's character to Nim's plight, or the irrelevance of Foster's adventures to the film -- unless, that is, it's actually a film about Foster, not Nim, and I'm mis-reading it.

-- Gerard Butler, stranded on his wrecked boat, is ostensibly the driving motivation of the movie, as Nim is seeking aid to rescue him. Yet he ends up saving himself, with the help of Galileo the pelican, by miraculously building a raft in open sea _after_ his boat is sunk.

-- Nim calls on Foster for help (thinking Foster is actually her books' adventure hero), yet is utterly capable to handling everything by herself, including defending her island against tourist invaders(in a plot line that has nothing to do with the other stories, but serves to fill up half an hour of movie).

So we're supposed to think Nim needs help, when she's the most capable character in the movie. We're supposed to think Foster can help, when she's the most incapable character of the movie. And Gerard Butler, well, he's got a pelican helping him.

Anyway, a groaningly absurd, pointless, and (I mention in passing) logically flawed plot. It is unfortunate that my 1 1/2 year old daughter likes the movie. But she likes it for the primary tension: she understands Nim's father is missing. Unfortunately the screenwriters/director lost sight of that primary tension.

I have not read the book. And there are moments in the film -- as when Nim and the boy are talking about stories vs. reality -- where the threads of a more ideationally developed plot -- one that holds the whole film together -- might reside. But they are at best mal-formed teases of a better film.

One might say everything above is irrelevant to a child's movie, so long as the children like it. But I have to disagree. To say that is to say, essentially, ""We don't care is you feed our children crap, just so long as they're smiling."" And that's, in essence, is why Johnny can't read (to appropriate the phrase). Simply because the film is aimed at children does not give everyone involved a get out of jail free card for quality. The opposite should be the case. As said, my 1 1/2 year old is enjoying the DVD currently. Hopefully by the time she's 6 she'll have outgrown it.

For those who have kids age 5-12, this is highly recommended. For adults, well, it's not bad. If you're looking for ""clean"" entertainment, you found it. It's not goody-goody, either, and it's not always a smart family movie (a father leaving his kid all alone for several days?) but it's a nice movie, has funny animal characters, a lead kid who is not a brat, nice island scenery, one big-name actress (Jodie Foster) and is a diversion for an hour-and-a-half.

The little dragon ""Fred"" is the best of the non-humans. I don't know if that's the real noise that lizard makes, but it's fun to hear. Seals are always entertaining, too. The one in this film is very talented.

As for the humans, Abigail Breslin as ""Nim Rusoe"" is a cute, likable kid. Gerard Butler plays both male leads and does them well enough that you forget he's doing two characters.

It's very enjoyable if very improbably plotted (I'm not going to get into the fact that I was a little disturbed with the idea of Nim and her dad living alone in the middle of nowhere, no school, no socializing, no hospital - the mind reels).  Breslin is wonderful, and although I prefer Jodie Foster in drama rather than comedy or adventure, she's good as the agoraphobic writer who comes to Breslin's rescue.  Butler is totally engaging in his dual role of Dad and Foster's alter ego Alex Rover.  Very good production values and well-paced.

When Nim's father appears to be lost at sea, Nim reaches out to the author of her favorite adventure novels, Alex Roper (Jodie Foster), via e-mail. Unfortunately, Alex is far removed from the hero she writes about in her books. In reality, Alex has as little contact with the outside world as possible (she's been cooped up in her San Francisco apartment for 16 consecutive weeks) and is extremely OCD. However, when Alex realizes that Nim is all alone and needs her help, she faces her fears and travels halfway around the world to get to the island where Nim is desperately waiting for her father to return to her.

I enjoyed the movie, which is extremely cute and a bit hokey at times.

I loved her in Little Miss Sunshine. Her tireless upbeat attitude was infectious. And I'm happy to say that's what makes this film bearable.

The cute factor is exceptionally high, so if you're not into the `cute-and-fuzzies', don't say you haven't been warned. But one must realize the audience this film was targeted at: six to eight year olds.

Dancing seals, intelligent pelicans, and near verbal lizards are all present on Nim's Island, making the cute-and-fuzzy barometer tilt far to the right. The story is also exceptionally trite, with hardly any danger or suspense. When Nim's dad Jack Rusoe (Gerard Butler,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Beowulf-Grendel/dp/B000VUVGAW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Beowulf & Grendel</a>) gets `lost at sea', there's really little doubt he'll survive -- especially with the help of Galileo the Pelican.

Also, when Alexandra Rover (Foster) is forced to decide between her agoraphobia and saving Nim from a life of possible solitude on an uncharted island, there's no doubt she'll overcome her fears and be forced out into the world (it's also entertaining to see how she experiences life outside of her small apartment where she types away on action-adventure books that Nim loves to read).

There's not much point to the story, either. Simply exploring Nim's world is the basis for everything, but it's a fun world and one that kids will enjoy watching. The playful animals and the child-growing-up-in-isolation themes are easy for children to follow, and are things parents won't find upsetting in the slightest.

My wife and I watched ""Nim's Island"" with her yesterday and we (my wife and I) really liked it. My almost 14 year old was less impressed. She wanted an adventure to rescue ""Jack"" and was disappointed that his rescue ended up as merely metaphorical. Go figure.

So here's the deal, ""Nim's Island"" is a cute family film, but it is a bit silly and probably best viewed by tweeners and their parents. I'll give it to my oldest Granddaughter and see what she thinks. For my part Kudos go to Jodie Foster for making a (pretty good) movie that kids can watch, and parents won't hate.

I usually enjoy Jody Foster and the other talents in this movie, but they should have stopped filming while they were ahead and that was in the process of reading the script.

I just don't understand why Jodie Foster let herself get mixed up in this piece of junk. Usually you can trust her to be very careful about the jobs she'll accept.

On the bright side, there's nothing really gratingly offensive in the movie, and it makes a sort of token effort at a preserve-the-wilderness theme.",1221955200,,651,4.909090909090909

3457213,3,B001APZMJI,"Somewhat diverting but hardly memorable, this 2008 adventure movie boasts some surprisingly bad computer-enhanced matte shots, especially in the attempt to make the remote island setting a tropical Eden.

The multiplicity of fingerprints shows in the screenplay which tries to tie together the isolated situations of three sketchily developed characters in a story that doesn't really provide thrills or genuine heart. It's a new millennium tinkering of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Swiss-Family-Robinson/dp/0451529618/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Swiss Family Robinson</a>&nbsp;story replete with single parenting, agoraphobia, and out-of-nowhere WiFi.

The story focuses on eleven-year-old Nim, a rambunctious girl who lives with her scientist father Jack on an island otherwise uninhabited except by her frolicsome animal friends. As part of a biweekly shipment, she receives a series of books about an Indiana Jones-style adventurer named Alex Rover. The books allow her to imagine the rest of the world through the adventurer's eyes, and he shows up vividly in her imagination. With much trepidation, Jack decides to take a two-day sailing trip to look for protozoan specimens leaving Nim behind. A storm tosses Jack into harm's way, as Nim tries to ward off an onslaught of cruise ship passengers intent on turning the island into a Club Med. Through happenstance, she emails who she thinks is Alex Rover the adventurer. Instead, it turns out to be Alexandra Rover, the Marin-based author of all the books Nim loves. Alexandra turns out to be an obsessive clean freak who survives on Progresso Soup and Purell and won't ever leave her house. The rest of the story is how Alexandra comes to Nim's aid and Jack survives a sinking boat and shark-infested waters.

The omnipresent Abigail Breslin (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/No-Reservations/dp/B00005JPSM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">No Reservations</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Definitely-Maybe/dp/B0017JHQPK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Definitely, Maybe</a>) shows she can carry a movie as Nim, but she does seem to be on the verge of overexposure. In a complete about-face from her most recent roles (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Brave-One/dp/B0010HOZW6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Brave One</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Inside-Man/dp/B000GFLKF8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Inside Man</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Flightplan/dp/B000BYY11Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Flightplan</a>), Jodie Foster seems out of her element as she attempts to make Alexandra a slapstick comic heroine. The strain often shows, but there are moments when you realize how she would have played Nim in her tomboyish way had the film been made 35 years earlier. Also in an about-face, Gerard Butler gets to play both Jack and the fantasy figure of adventurer Alex Rover. He struggles mightily with an American accent and a microscope as devoted father Jack but swaggers with ease as a Scottish Alex. In truth, none of the three stars seems stretched here, but their innate likeability goes a long way toward making this movie palatable ...even for an old curmudgeon like me.

There is a robust set of extras on the 2008 DVD beginning with two commentary tracks both aimed more at the more youthful viewer. The first with Breslin and Foster is surprisingly low-key, while the second with Levin and Flackett is more engaging. Of more interest are the deleted scenes. The first is nine minutes long and includes footage of Nim's interactions with her imaginary friends Huck Finn and Alice in Wonderland. The second features the deleted role of Alexandra's assistant. While the additional characters provide an opportunity for more dialogue, it's arguable whether they would have helped pick up the pace of the film. Two PSAs, several trailers, and three quick featurettes, two focused on Breslin and the animals, round out the extras.",1221782400,,4817,6.679425837320574
3457214,4,B001APZMJI,"I watched this without the company of children and still found pleasure in the story line.  It definitely requires the ability to stretch your mind into the realms of fantasy so it's important to watch from a child-like point of view.  Abigail Breslin is a delight and, surprisingly, there is a moral to the story that I found heartwarming.  Jody Foster is very funny, and Gerard Butler is always a pleasure to watch.",1221696000,,417,4.684931506849315
3457215,2,B001APZMJI,"Abigail Breslin is Nim, a young girl living in an isolated island in the South Pacific alone with her father Jack (Gerard Butler). When her father, a slightly eccentric biologist, is missing after a heavy storm, Nim asks for a help from the most unlikely person in the world: Alexandra Rover (Jodie Foster), an agoraphobic writer living in a big city, famous for her successful ""Alex Rover"" series, Indiana Jones-like adventure novels. ""Nim's Island"" has the right ingredients to make a great family picture (and a nice change of pace for Jodie Foster), which it is not, however as the film is helmed by wrong directors.

In fact, Jennifer Flackett and Mark Levin's ""Nim""s Island"" could have been a great family picture with a better director. In the film's introduction Nim is shown as an independent and clever girl who can also communicate with animals. The imaginative girl has a lot of stories to tell us, about her mother (apparently dead) and father, animals, island and herself. She is also a gifted storyteller (as the film's introduction shows) and is good at using computers too.

But somehow the director team didn't realize that such an intelligent girl would not mistake tourists for buccaneers. Even if she does, she doesn't need a slapstick comedy sequence like flying lizards. After the promising beginning, the film's story suddenly starts to meander in the mid-section with a train of silly set-pieces, and we start to think: Well, Nim has sent a message to Alexandra, a reclusive writer to come over to help her, but why should she do that if she is really a clever girl? Isn't that impractical and most of all, a bit selfish? But the film doesn't seem aware of that, leaving us far behind.

Of course the contrived situation could be forgotten if the film provides us with a good story, in this case, a story of Alexandra. I hate to say this, but Jodie Foster's ""comic"" antics as fish-out-of-water Alexandra only irritated me with her terrible overacting. Here is a job for directors who should have stopped the camera to say ""no"" to her. I really like her, but it is painful to watch her yelling, stumbling and vomiting (twice), all clich. Is this all necessary after all when the film is titled ""Nim's Island""?",1221609600,,2233,4.77979274611399

Amanda Breslin does a wonderful job in this children's fantasy without being ""cutesy"" and Jody Foster and Gerard Butler (in two roles) take care of their parts without coming across as stupid, as adults often do in family movies.  All parents have flaws, but they are portrayed more or less realistically here.  The author of the book shows a real understanding of the family dynamic, and it carried through nicely.

Since I know Foster and Butler have done brilliant work in the past, I have to lay the blame at the feet of the directors.  They had Foster mugging with unrealistic facial contortions better left to a circus.  Butler fared a little better, but he, too, had some difficult moments.

3457233,4,B001APZMJI,"I don't think Walden Media is ever going to produce a five-star film, so I'm going to stop waiting. They just don't seem to have it in them. They lack the vision, I suppose. So, I'm just going to enjoy the four-star fare that seems to be their forte. Few family films rise above the level of ""good mediocrity"" nowadays anyway. (Pixar is the obvious exception to this.) Not so two generations ago. Two generations ago, five-star family films were the norm. But we in America have forsaken the family film, just as we have forsaken the family. I guess that is to be expected (forsaking the family film, I mean). I don't think the family film will make a comeback until the family makes one first.

That said, Nim's Island is a very enjoyable family film that is almost like taking a cheap vacation. It's fun, funny and exotic. It has three strong stars that carry it, in spite of a weak script and weak direction. You really can't do much better than Abigail Breslin (Little Miss Sunshine) for a child actress, Jodie Foster (Maverick) for a female comedian, or Gerard Butler (300, PS: I Love You, Tomb Raider: Cradle Of Life) for a romantic hero. The story is quirky and unrealistic, but it is enjoyable and does have a message: ""Be the hero of your own story.""

Nim's Island can be forgiven its lack of realism because it is being told from the viewpoint of eleven-year-old Nim (Abigail Breslin), who has an active imagination that is fueled by reading adventure stories written by Alexandra Rover (Jodie Foster) and featuring Alex Rover (Gerard Butler) as the hero. Butler also plays Nim's father, Jack Ruscoe, who is a marine biologist living alone on a South Pacific island with his daughter. Jack goes off for two days on his boat to search for a new specimen of marine life, but does not return when he said he would because he is caught in a storm, which all but destroys his boat. Meanwhile, Alexandra, who is doing research for her latest novel, contacts Jack via e-mail to ask about his island, which has an active volcano on it. Thinking that Alexandra is the heroic Alex from her books, Nim asks Alex to come help her find her dad, whom she believes is lost at sea, and to help save her island, which is being invaded by tourists from a questionable cruise ship called the Buccaneer. Unlike Alex, Alexandra is deathly afraid of everything, and thinks of every excuse why she can't come. But the imaginary Alex, who is as real to Alexandra as he is to Nim, talks her into it. So off they go to help Nim, with Alexandra kicking and screaming.

The story is strangely reminiscent of Romancing The Stone, but toned down for kids. It also has a host of animal actors, including a seal, a frigate pelican and a bearded dragon lizard, all of which are Nim's pets and friends. The film is based on an illustrated children's book by Wendy Orr. I can see why the producers wanted to make this book into a film. I just can't see why they chose a pair of weak directors (Jennifer Flackett and Mark Levin) instead of one strong one. Directing is not a job that can be shared. Nor can I see why they chose a team of weak writers (in addition to Flackett and Levin, Joseph Kwong and Paula Mazur) instead of one or two strong ones. Too many cooks spoil the soup, especially when the characters and plot have already been worked out in the book. So, much is lost that could have been saved with greater wisdom on the part of the producers. But the actors are enjoyable and the locations gorgeous, and it does make a nice escapist film for the family. The DVD may be worth buying because it comes with a book of exotic creatures; but the special features are rather slim unless you're an Abigail Breslin fan.

3457234,3,B001APZMJI,"Nim (Abigail Breslin) lives with her scientist father (Gerard Butler) on their own tropical island.  They have all the modern conveniences and are devoted to one another.  One day, Dad gets lost at sea and Nim starts an email correspondence with Alex Rover (Jodie Foster), the neurotic, agoraphobic author of Nim's favorite adventure novels.  Alex vows to come to Nim's island to help the little girl.

If I were eight years old, I would love this movie; it's all about girl power and a great father/daughter relationship. But I'm not eight, and I found the movie way too precious and utterly boring.  The actors are all okay, although Foster seemed wrong for the part, Butler phoned in his performance, and Breslin was too old to be Nim.  She was too perfect, too confident, and too capable and lacked the sincerity she had in earlier movies (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Signs/dp/B00005JL3T/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Signs</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Little-Miss-Sunshine/dp/B000K7VHQE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Little Miss Sunshine</a>).  I didn't much care what happened to her.

While the island scenery was lovely, there was a lot of obvious CGI and the movie felt like an over-long cartoon.  There is never any doubt that the movie will end happily and the lack of suspense ruined it for me.  Highly recommended for kids; adults may find it provides a nice nap.",1218931200,,1471,5.8

3457236,3,B001APZMJI,"Half fantasy, half kids-adventure, Nim's Island is more aimed at the tweens crowd than anyone else. Abigail Breslin plays 11 year old Nim, a young motherless girl who been raised and lives on a remote island with her scientist Dad played by Gerard ""300"" Butler (who after that first flick you might not recognize as that same guy). When Dad gets lost at sea, Nim goes on-line to speak to Alex Rover (phoning it in by Jodie Foster, who at least isn't shooting men in a vengeful way this time), who she thinks is the man in all her ""Indiana Jones-like"" novels, but actually is an agoraphobic female writer who never leaves the house and sees her creation talking and walking with her (again played by Butler). When little Nim is injured while searching the beaches for Dad, she calls to her hero to save the day and come from San Francisco to her South Asiatic Sea location to come save her and Daddy. Of course she does.....

Okay you get the point. Sure, it's as far fetched as you can imagine, but at least my nine year old daughter was entertained. As for the adults, it's cute with beautiful breathtaking scenery, but the story will make you roll your eyes every so often. Not to mention some of the animals are real, some are CGI, and those latter ones really look pretty fake. And while not writing any more spoilers, you can also figure out how it ends. A nice little rental, or something to show the kids in the other room, Nim's Island is okay, but rent it first before buying.

Jodie Foster, yummy Gerard Butler, a deserted island for a home, loads of adventure (at least according to the trailer), trained animals, a mother swallowed by a whale.

This movie turned out to be a very pale imitation of ""Romancing the Stone"", without the romance, without the adventure, without the fun...I was bored stiff in the first five minutes and by the time Jodie Foster eventually made it to the island, I just plain didn't care.

If this film is truly aimed at 6-8 year old, then they've got to be the least interesting 6-8 year olds on the planet.  Because my grandkids were bored stiff too (ages 6, 10 and 11, two of them girls).  Maybe the film picked up during the last half hour; I wouldn't know, I fell asleep.

3457239,4,B001APZMJI,"Nim (Abigail Breslin) lives with her father Jack (Gerard Butler) on an isolated island in the middle of the Pacific Ocean. They've lived there since discovering it on one of their around the world cruises after Nim's mother died. Even though they are alone, they aren't lonely. Nim has made friends with several of the island's animals. They have tons of books. Somehow, they have the internet (that's never explained). And every few months a ship comes by and drops off supplies, including the latest Alex Rover novel.

Jack is a marine biologist always on the trail of a new species of microorganism. When he gets a lead, he takes off for two days. Nim insists she stay behind since her sea turtles eggs are about to hatch. Two days turns into longer when a fierce storm comes up and partially destroys his boat.

While Jack's away, Nim gets an e-mail from Alex Rover asking for help in research for the next book. When things begin to go wrong, the upset 11 year old pours out her heart to Alex, asking for help.

What Nim doesn't know is that Alex Rover is really Alexandra Rover (Jodie Foster) the author who created the hugely popular character. And Alexandra is afraid of everything and never leaves her apartment. Can Alexandra overcome her fears and come to Nim's rescue?

From the previews, I expected a story set on an island.  And part of it was.  But the story is as much about Alexandra's journey to the island as it is what is happening on the island.  When I realized this, I had to shift my expectations.  And I'm glad I did because I enjoyed the movie.

It is filled with the kinds of stuff deserted island fanciers will love. The house that Nim and her dad live in is wonderful. The animals are exceedingly cute and the scenery is beautiful. If it were real, I'd be on the next plane out for a vacation on this island.

As long as we're talking about fantasies, there is a fantasy sequence near the beginning that this reader loved. You'll know it when you see it. I was grinning stupidly the entire time that scene was on.

Ultimately, this movie is about finding the courage to be a hero. It's something that Nim, Jack, and Alexandra must do in various ways. What I like about it is that all three face that need in different ways

But this isn't a preachy film.  Instead, it's hidden in a film filled with adventure and laughs.  It could have been broad and over the top, but it never falls into that trap.  That is partially thanks to the wonderful acting by all involved.

Now I will admit that the movie is a bit far fetched.  But while you are watching it, you'll want to believe every second because you are having so much fun.

The one flaw the movie has is the climax.  Quite a few things were glossed over in the rush to get there, and it is over much too quickly.

The movie is PG.  I'm guessing because it is because of characters in peril.  I don't remember any language issues.  Frankly, I think this is a movie that kids of all ages will enjoy.

3457241,4,B001APZMJI,"We enjoyed this fantasy- adventure, but you must quickly park your reason and commonsense at the dock right away, or it'll drive you crazy, e.g., what loving father would leave his young daughter alone for two days, even, or especially, on a beautiful, deserted island?  And how could they live there without other kids or family for her to play with?  Wow, that parenting mind never shuts off.

The actual island where Nim and father live and work alone is a place where every kid and kid wanna-be should vacation, and the tale reminds me of ""Joe and the Volcano"", kids' style, or ""Swiss Family Robinson"", a fun fable with likeable people, exotic locations, adventure, cute animals and a message: ""You can do it!""

Abigail Breslin(Nim) is a talented, young actress; we always love Gerard Butler(Daddy/Jack, Alex' alter ego), but Jodie Foster(Alexandra) was a hoot(I had reservations beforehand) as the agoraphobic, constantly talking to herself, writer who's forced to become, more or less, her 'Indiana Jones' creation, Alex Rover.  For Foster, it's definitely a refreshing change from her slew of thrillers.

There's essentially three stories going on: 1. Nim's longing for her lost-at-sea father while 'defending' their island with the help of scene stealing animals; 2. Father's fight to get home; 3. Alexandra's struggle with self-imposed fears to help Nim.

It's appropriate for school age kids, but being left alone and the fear of losing one's father is too stressful for little ones; however, they could easily watch and enjoy the animals, the gags and the tree house.  The negatives: it's far-fetched, vascillates between serious and silly, but over all, it's a satisfying trip and with beautiful scenery- just leave your brain at home.",1218067200,,1747,5.126760563380282

Yet in Nim's Island she is portrayed as if she has never had a decent film before this and this is her breakthrough role I suppose.  She is so-so in this family oriented flop granted the material wasn't really good.  She tries to make Nim a fascinating character yet she comes across as a immature and foolish girl.  Gerard and Jodie are paired up together and it really works well, the relationship is strange but the chemistry is their. However, they are completely overshadowed and they have to take the back seat.  I really couldn't see the attraction to this lackluster film.  I usually enjoy family films yet this film leaves something to be desired.  The ending was lazy at best and felt rushed to me.  If Walden Media wants to be taken seriously they need to bring more passion and something new.

To pass some time, Nim reads Alex Rover adventure novels.  Alex Rover is an Indiana Jones type adventurer.  When Nim's father is lost at sea, she has an exchange of emails with Alex Rover to get him to come help find her father.  What she gets is Alexandra Rover (Jodie Foster) the agoraphobic, panic driven author of the fictional Alex Rover novels.

All three actors play easy roles and don't use their full potential.  Jodie Foster had the most challenging role in playing the agoraphobic, but played it well.  She was like a female Bob Wiley (""What About Bob?"") minus the Tourette's Syndrome and foul language.

Most of the story revolves around Rover's quest to get to Nim's Island, but when she gets there, it's really not clear why she needed to be there in the first place.  Most of the action and ""Home Alone"" defense of the island by Nim is over long before Rover gets there.  A predictable happy ending of a story about a loving relationship between father and daughter.

On the whole, ""Nim's Island"" is a good place for kids (ages 5 to 10) to adventure in or vacation with the family.  Not so much for adults, but they can get tidbits of enjoyment out of it.",1217894400,,1347,4.54356846473029

3457246,4,B001APZMJI,"This lightweight bit of fluff actually has a bit more substance than I expected, but nearly enough mass to bog it down. On the surface, it's a kid-empowerment movie. Nim, the nine year old girl, is adventurous, interested in everything, and fiercely self-reliant. Alex (that's Alexandra, much to the surprise of people expecting a male Alex) is too timid to open the front door, and gets carsick before the car even starts moving. Nim is fearless and Alex is omniphobic. Still, once their friendship forms, Alex overcomes her fear of everything but her shadow to help Nim when disasters leave her alone, hurt, and frightened.

The two main characters balance beautifully. Nim is yound and bold, by nature, but still a little girl who gets scared when truly scary things happen. Alex embodies timidity, but has a core of mousy bravery that rises to the occasion. Nim lives in the world of Alex's adventure stories, which turn real around her as she reads them; Alex lives with the characters she writes, too, but has a much more argumentative relationship with them. A few other things come across nicely, too: the pervasive love of reading, nearly lost in today's media-mad world, and the image of scientist-geek as loving, strong, and physically competent. The girl-power message is there too, without being exclusive or overbearing. And despite a positive view of science, Nim brings a touch of magic, too.

I might not remember this one a week from now, but it's great entertainment for any kid in your life (with a very few slightly scary moments). If you have a rainy afternoon, have a blast.

3457247,3,B001APZMJI,"I'm sitting on the fence. I liked Nim's Island because it feels a little bit like Holes. Hovering around the real and blending with fantasy and quirky visuals, this story is an exercise in imagination and is entertaining most of the time. I liked the casting overall. Jodie Foster played the angst-ridden adventure novelist with the whole gamut of human emotion. Gerard Butler got to exercise his acting muscles as well.

I appreciated the ingenuity and attitude that Abigal Breslin as Nim Russo displays. A breath of fresh air when so many of our kids are bored even with all the technology and toys that money can buy. The value of family and the importance of others in life is an underlying theme that strengthens the movie.

The negatives...well, there was really only one. I really struggled with not getting sucked into the story. I spent more time ""yeah-right""ing than buying what was going on. The frantic pace of parts of the movie, the outlandish happenings and the blending with the real made it almost feel like a tall-tale that doesn't quite get beyond a middling-tale.

Parents of four to ten year-olds (depending on maturity level) will likely find Nim's Adventure to be a treat for the whole family. If my kids were younger, I'd probably purchase Nim's Island.",1216425600,,1277,4.821917808219178

Nim and her father, mirobiologist Jack Russo live on a private island in the middle of the Asiatic Sea. They have all the conveniences of home, with regular deliveries from a supply ship. Nim enjoys her friendships with her animal pals, a sea lion, a pelican and an iguana. She also enjoys reading the latest adventure from her favorite author, Alex Rover.

When Nim's father fails to return an excursion to collect specimens, Nim is worried about her own safety and the safety of her father out to sea. She contacts her favorite author, Alex Rover. She is certain that Alex will know just how to find her father.

Alex Rover turns out to be Alexandra Rover, the big city dweller who is afraid to leave the comfort of her own home. Alex braves the wild world just outside her door, by taking a deap breath and listening to the promptings of her fictional adventure character.

How can this pathetic creature go over land and sea to help a courageous child find her father?
Can her father brave the storm and find his way back to his daughter?

This is a fun family movie about going outside yourself and overcoming obstacles.

3457252,5,B001APZMJI,"In the tradition of last year's poignant and well-made film adaptation of ""Bridge to Terabithia,"" Disney and Walden Media pair up again for another nicely written and superbly acted story for the big screen. I knew from the beginning that I wanted to catch this one when it came out, and upon seeing it for the first time, I was pleasantly surprised to find that it was even better than I expected.

It's a children's adventure flick, to be sure, but for all you parents and adults out there, you just might find yourself enjoying it just as much. And unlike the controversial and mismarketed ""Bridge to Terabithia,"" which had several people in a tizzy by the time the end credits rolled, there are no frightening or overly emotional curveballs to worry about here. From beginning to end, there is plenty of excitement and unique plot material to go around, and it is mixed with just the right amount of sweetness to satisfy everyone.

This is Jodie Foster's first family-friendly role in a VERY long time, and it's nice to get a glimpse back at the kind of characters she used to play back in her ""Parent Trap"" days. She undoubtedly has some powerful range as an actor, and by playing a reclusive author who has a heck of a time even leaving her house to grab the mail, this movie allows her to be bold, funny, and inspiring at the same time.

As for Abigail Breslin, if you don't know who she is by now, then you should be aware that she has been working very hard to catch up with the solid acting reputation of young stars like Dakota Fanning, and with multiple back-to-back films in the past year (along with a Best Supporting Actress nomination at the 2007 Oscars at the age of 10 for her work in ""Little Miss Sunshine""), this is a young starlet to keep your eye on. She tackles the title role with a lot of maturity and responsibility, and at the tender age of 11, the movie belongs to her. I have every reason to believe that her career is on its way to gaining the same strength and renown as that of Jodie Foster's, who also started out as a child. For a role like this, it was very important for the film to find a child who could carry the movie, someone who would be convincing as resourceful, headstrong, and intelligent--and part of that means casting a kid with experience. You can't ask for more than Ms. Breslin, who has an impressive number of movies under her belt, has worked with some big-name stars (think Kate Hudson, Steve Carell, Catherine Zeta-Jones, Joan Cusack, and now Jodie Foster, among others), and is always, always capable of putting up a solid performance. You always know she's going to be good, and she always is. She knows how to emote, she knows how to be cute and precocious, and she knows how to be a little bratty when the script calls for it, so it's easy to understand why she's been the ""go-to kid"" for so many ""older child"" roles recently. I look forward to seeing more from her in the years ahead as she approaches adolescence and adulthood.

Gerard Butler rounds out the main cast and takes on a dual role here, portraying both Breslin's single scientist father and Foster's imaginary ""crutch,"" if you will. I loved watching him star opposite Hilary Swank in the recent ""P.S. I Love You,"" and he is equally likable in this film.

Simply stated, this is the kind of film that you can take the whole family to. It has enough action, adventure, and intrigue to keep the older kids interested, and the overall ""no man is an island"" message of courage and perseverance is something that very few parents can complain about. There are no guns, explosives, or foul language necessary to advance the plot--just a group of talented actors, lovable characters, and a simple, original story that you'll fall in love with. I agree with a previous reviewer in that Foster and Breslin should have had more screen time together--after all, only three or four scenes at the end of the movie isn't all that satisfying for two dynamic characters and talented actors such as them--but I guess the given story wouldn't have been compatible with multiple scenes for the two of them. Setting that aside, it's just one of those special films that everyone has something good to say about, and whether or not you have a child to accompany to this, you won't want to miss it!",1213660800,,4299,4.541935483870968

8. An exchange of e-mails brings Alex and Nim together, and getting there is more than half the fun

3457255,4,B001APZMJI,"This is a very sweet and fun movie, with some major messages, but mostly a great adventure fantasy for children - especially girls.

It is the story of Nim, a motherless girl who has been bought up by her father roving the sees and later settling on a deserted island in the middle of the Pacific. It is somewhere no one knows because they meet a supply ship in their own small sailing boat every few months. From that ship they obviously get all the things to live in an extraodinary tree house, and also have online internet whenever they want it! My daughters especially loved the tree house - they want to live in one now, including the flying fox to get down to the water.

There are some lovely scenes in this - the animated section of the mother getting eaten by a whale, the decorations in the tree hut house of Nim and her father are the most outstanding.

Anyway, as the story unfolds Nim's father sails away to collect samples from a reef and will be back in three days, Nim refuses to go, and then their troubles begin. A storm hits and Nim is left alone - the tree house sustains damage and she can't contact her father when she repairs it because (although she doesn't know it) his boat is wrecked and the communication gone - and sharks are circling.

In the meantime author Alex Rover who has a spot of writer's block is trying to contact Nim's father to find out about real volcanos - she is trying to finish her next Alex Rover adventure and can't get him out of a volcano - she wants to know what they are like. Nim helps, but reveals she is a young girl alone and her father is missing. Alex Rover, is actually Alexandra Rover, and an agraphobic who is too scared to leave her apartment, even to get the mail. She orders hand sanitiser in mega amounts by courier. Yet despite this she sets out to help Nim or save her father, or something!

In the meantime Nim's island is being 'invaded' by the Bucaneer brand of cruise ship - these are linked with her mother's death and so in her mind are pirates. Nim must do everything she can to drive them away.

All these storys seem to be loosely connected by Nim herself - but in actualy fact seem to operate quite independently. Nim's father gets help indirectly through one of Nim's friends, by the time Alex Rover gets to the Island the role she plays is actually extremely small - and the Bucaneer brand of Cruises are driven from the island, but for how long?

The magic of this story is in the setting, the island, the tree house, the animal friends and the character's sheer pluckiness. These are great images - or mostly. I have one great problem with this - while abigail Breslin is perfect in most ways - she is wholly physically incapable of being a plucky adventure heroine. Don't get me wrong, I love her as an actress, I think she is extraodinary! But she runs with her elbows up, she kicks out - she is not a tomboy in her actions and even my 6 year old noticed it. Breslin is funny and nice, but action adventure heroine she is not.

All parts played well - especially the animals, my daughters are now keen we dwell in tree house and tame a few seals to have fun with. Just what I want from a movie!",1211500800,,3179,4.295492487479132

They live alone and like it that way.  Nim (Breslin) is ""Island schooled"" by her father and has lizards and sea turtles for playmates.

Alexandra 'Alex' Rover (Foster) a writer of adventure stories featuring a brave man bearing her name. Alexandra calls herself a borderline agoraphobic.  She hasn't left her apartment in San Francisco for sixteen weeks.

She's also got a problem--she's three weeks' late getting a draft of her latest ""Alex Rover"" novel to her editor, Buffy, and can't get Alex (also played by Butler) out of a trap in a volcano in Chapter 8. Like many writers, her character is real to her and he's tired of being stuck in the same predicament and wants Alex to get on with the book and both their lives.

Jack leaves on a specimen collection run and Nim stays home alone for the first time to assist with the birth of sea turtles. She's told to tell anyone emailing Jack that he'll return on Thursday and never divulge the location of their island. Alexandra becomes Nim's inadvertent penpal when she writes Jack asking about volcanoes and thinks that Nim is Jack's assistant. Nim thinks Alex is her hero, Alex Rover, and will do anything to help him.

Despite Jack's admonishment.  Nim answers the author's questions about the volcano and accidentally injures herself rappelling down from the top.  From the heights, she sees a cruise ship called the Buccaneer landing and believes the men to be pirates.  When the ship  returns with a boatload of tourists to enjoy the island, Nim thinks she's being 'invaded' and asks her hero, Alex Rover, for help.

Prodded by her character, Alex packs her bags and her courage, and heads literally toward uncharted waters to help a little girl alone. Pretty brave, since she's got to confront fear of just about everything.

Out on the open sea, Jack's encountered a storm and his ship's damaged.  He may not make it back to his daughter.

Meanwhile, the tourist ship has come back and Nim's launched an attack on the invaders with the help of her animal friends. Poor Alex is struggling to make it to the island, and Jack's cobbling a ship together to get back home to his daughter.

The story's written for children, but the tale's so engaging you really are lost from the moment Nim (Breslin) starts telling us about the loss of her Mom and their travels. All the actors are people you want to see accomplish their goals.

WARNING:  This story may not work for very young children.  A little girl of about 4 next to us whose Daddy was in Iraq was pretty distressed when she thought Nim's Daddy was lost and was frightened through several of the scenes.  ""Nim's Island"" is a wonderful adventure, but it could be scary and the issues of abandonment, scary spiders, sharks, etc. might be too much for them.

A wonderful film for the whole family.  And just think only one explosion - a natural volcano.

Abigail Breslin(Nim) is such a sweet, natural actress that she very easily carries the title role.  Nim is resourceful, brave and smart.  She lives on a remote island with her father Jack Rusoe (Gerry Butler), a ocean scientist.  He goes out to sea to look for protozoa on an overnight trip.  Nim begs to stay behind so she can help the sea turtle hatchlings.  All is well until a storm.

She handles the storm that nearly tears her home apart, putting everything back together.  She gets rid of a tour boat that happens by, by rigging up a lizard catapult.  She even answers a message from the author Alex Rover and climbs a cliff to check out the volcano.  But when her father is still missing after the 4th day because of the storm, she succombs to being a little girl wanting her father.

The big storm ruined his sail and motor.  With no tools, he has still managed to rig a pump to get the water out of the boat.

When Nim contacts Alex again saying she needs help, the writer, who is really a woman (Jodie Foster) terrified of going out of her home, argues with her alter ego, Alex Rover(also Butler) the hero of the books she writes.  Her fight with herself/Alex, getting out of the house to ""be the hero of her own story and go help that little girl"" is funny and well done.

The Animal friends who live with, and help Nim, are Selki the seal, a lizard named Fred, and Galileo, the Pelican.  It is Galileo who is the hero of the story.  He dives for fish for Jack to eat, and piles them in the boat.  He flies back to the island and snatches Jacks tool belt away from where Nim is using it, and takes it to Jack so he can rig a sail and get back home.

As Nim and Alexandra are discussing the future, way out at sea she sees a speck and then as it grows larger, realizes it is Galileo and as he flies toward the island Nim sees the boat bringing her father.  As the 3 meet on the beach, Galileo flies overhead - a friend, and the hero of this story.

Highly recommended for families and all who have an inner child.  8/10

3457258,5,B001APZMJI,"Walden Media and 20th Century Fox look like they have a hit on their hands. Nim's Island is one of those delightful film concoctions of adventure, fantasy and family everyone from your grandma to your kid sister will enjoy. Based on a children's novel by Wendy Orr, it's always intriguing to hear the author's reaction to an adaptation of their own book. After watching a screening of Nim's Island, Orr had this to say in a recent interview, ""...the overwhelming feeling was relief and joy--I really like it, and I truly believe it's good."" High praise indeed.

Nim Rusoe (Abigail Breslin) is a young girl who along with her scientist father (Gerard Butler) lives on an island paradise. He makes his living researching plankton, algae and other tiny creatures of the sea. But not even in his National Geographic cover story bio does he reveal where he lives. He and Nim have worked long and hard to keep their location a secret from the outside world. They don't need strangers interfering. They have each other, the ocean, the animals, and Nim has her favorite novels--the Alex Rover adventure series. What more do they need? (Okay, so it's a tad bit unbelievable the supply ship wouldn't have spilled the beans, but this is a fantasy movie after all. We can cut them some slack.)

One day Nim's father hurriedly sets off on a two-day boat trip to capture a rare form of glowing algae. He tries to talk Nim into coming with him, but she insists she's old enough to take care of herself. Which is an understatement. This little girl is more like the Indiana Jones esque Alex Rover of her books than she realizes. She can fix solar panels, shinny up palm trees, build fires and cook up delectable delights like mealworm stew with the best of them. But when a storm hits and Nim loses contact with her father she's put to her biggest test of all. In desperation, she reaches out to the other hero in her life--Alex Rover. What she doesn't know is that Alex Rover isn't a ""he"" but a ""she"", an author who's penned the best-selling novels all without leaving her apartment.

Played brilliantly by Jodie Foster, Alexandra Rover is an agoraphobic writer obsessed with Purell hand sanitizer and Progressive soup who can barely gather up the courage to retrieve her mail each day (and some days puts it off until tomorrow). How could she possibly hop on a plane to help a young girl who lives half-way around the world?

There might be a reason Nim's last name is Rusoe. Her character could draw comparisons to the Robinson Crusoe of literature, only she's alone for four days not twenty-eight years. She's resourceful and adventurous. Her schooling is the best kind, coming from actual experiences and reading books rather than some boring classroom. Her best friends are a tame seal and lizard (is he real or CGI?) who are her inseparable companions throughout the movie. There's even a Pelican-like bird who rather unbelievably helps Nim's father out of a few scrapes, but hey. That's what we want, right?

Abigail Breslin has already proved herself a worthy member of any cast from her performances in the likes of Little Miss Sunshine and The Ultimate Gift. Here in Nim's Island she's once again blipping on our radar screens as a young actress to watch.

But as cute and talented as Abigail is in this film, Jodie Foster really steals the show. It was hilarious to see the reclusive author stereotype played out on screen, like when Alexandra talks to her character Alex Rover (also played by Gerard Butler) as if he really does exist. The fun part here is that the character actually does pop up in her scenes in some humorous ways, even dragging Alexandra out the door to help Nim. At one point when Alex Rover is handing Alexandra a line from her book about being the hero of your own life story, Alexandra turns on him and says, ""Don't hand me that line. I wrote that line!"" It's all in Alexandra's imagination, of course, but we almost begin to wonder at times.

One of the many great things about Nim's Island is the way it portrays the adventure of reading. Books aren't just words on a page. When you read a book you're transported to different worlds and different times. A scene early in the movie has Nim lying in her bed reading the latest Alex Rover novel at a point in the book when the character is battling his captors in the desert. But instead of just switching to Alex, the film makers chose to put Nim right in the scene, bed and all. So she's reading away completely oblivious even as Alex throws punches and literally tosses men across her during his escape. A beautiful portrayal of literature's power.

It's a pet peeve of mine when movies don't include scenes that are in the trailer. I'd expected some sort of swashbuckling confrontation with a pirate or nefarious villain in Nim's Island (as was implied in the trailer), but neither materialized. They certainly weren't necessary to create a compelling story, but I like to get what I've been promised.

I went into Nim's Island with high expectations. Jodie Foster simply has ""it"" as an actress, and I couldn't wait to see her portrayal of a tortured writer. Could she really nail a comedy/almost slapstick role after so many dramas? Would Abigail Breslin come off too cutesy? How would the adventure unfold?

I wasn't disappointed. I laughed so much that a few times I found myself glancing sheepishly around the theater hoping I hadn't disturbed someone. Though it probably won't be as huge a blockbuster as say the upcoming Prince Caspian, Nim's Island is still one of the best family films of the year.

3457259,3,B001APZMJI,"After watching NIM'S ISLAND, it occurred to me that Wendy Orr's children's novel would have worked much better as a Walt Disney animated feature than as a live action film with CGI effects. Animation would have provided the missing ingredient here--namely, good old-fashioned charm...and magic. The design work for the main titles led me to believe this would be an enchanting film. It wasn't.

However, with a lack of good films for children to see, I wouldn't discourage younger patrons from seeing the film. It's entertaining enough for impressionable minds to appreciate--if they can understand that the Alex Roper character is really a figment of Abigail's and Jody's imagination.

ABIGAIL BRESLIN is fine as the lonely island girl who has to fantasize about her pulp action hero and GERARD BUTLER is perfectly cast as her father (Jack) who goes missing for most of the story but is reunited with her--predictably--at the end after a savage storm. But I can't say I enjoyed watching JODIE FOSTER play a clumsy agoraphobic authoress in a series of scenes that had me wondering who else might have been better in that role. I came up with a younger Angela Lansbury, who knew how to do this sort of physical clumsiness with such skill and still remain charming. With Foster, the charm is gone and all you you get is a mannered amount of nerdy nervousness.

Lest anyone adult should fall asleep during the proceedings, not to worry. Patrick Doyle's bombastic background score, incredibly busy even during the frenzied height of the storm scenes, is enough to make anyone pop open their eyes to see what's happening.

What should have been wistful, magical, even a bit romantic, comes across as kind of brass, corny and utterly predictable nonsense with lots of credibility issues. Foster's character is among the most unbelievable characters ever created, even for a children's story.

Summing up: Has its moments and it's not all bad, but too bad Butler couldn't have had more footage. His scenes as the imaginary adventurer provide the best and most humorous moments in the whole film.",1207612800,,2088,4.97134670487106
3457260,5,B001APZMJI,I was pleasantly surprised by this movie. I was not sure about it at first but the plot really draws you in. There is only mild peril so it is fine for the small kids also though I would say anyone under 8 might not sit still. The plot is a little weak but you get sucked into the acting of the daughter and you forget. All in all a movie I would reccomend to adults and children too.,1207526400,,384,3.8734177215189876

3457263,4,B001APZMJI,"""Nim's Island"" is the kind of film you'd expect to open with ""Once upon a time"" and end with ""Happily ever after,"" but since it's about the magic of imagination and courage instead of actual magic (if there is any such thing), there's really no need. It does, however, begin and end with Abigail Breslin's voiceover narration, and she establishes a story so lofty that it's difficult to think of it as anything other than a fairy tale. While the plot of ""Nim's Island"" is completely unrealistic, and while the characters are anything but relatable, it tells such an innocent and good-hearted tale that you don't really think about those things. Its heart is in the right place pretty much all throughout, even when it lapses into sappy moments; that's saying a lot, since the entire film is based on a premise sappy enough for three family films.

The story: Nim Rusoe (Breslin) and her marine biologist father, Jack (Gerard Butler), live alone on a secluded island somewhere in the South Pacific. They came to live there after a whale (supposedly) swallowed Nim's mother after being spooked by a cruise ship called The Buccaneer; Jack and Nim found the island while searching the world's oceans for the whale and decided to stay. Since then, Jack has been obsessively looking for a new form of sea-dwelling amoeba, and Nim has been reading. Apparently, both would prefer that no one else inhabit the island, so whenever the supply ship stops by, they don't allow it to dock--they sail to it while it's still offshore. How such exchanges could ever be managed, I have no idea, but as I said before, this is not a realistic film. If you stop to question this, then you might as well stop to question how Jack could have a working computer with a reliable Internet service provider. Or why Nim and the island animals can communicate with one another. Or how they can keep the island a secret when we have satellite imagery that can locate anything anywhere on earth.

One of Nim's favorite reads is a book series featuring Alex Rover, a rugged Indiana Jones-type who travels the world and goes on daring adventures. There's a moment when Nim imagines one of the scenes from the latest book, and lo and behold, Rover looks just like her father (meaning he's also played by Gerard Butler). What Nim doesn't know is that Alex Rover is also the name of the author that created the character. What she also doesn't know is that the author is a woman; Alexandra Rover (Jodie Foster) lives in San Francisco, and despite being a very successful writer, she's agoraphobic, germaphobic, and obsessive-compulsive. Much like Nim, she can imagine Rover (the character) as a real person. But she takes it a step further--she has full conversations with Rover, relying on him for courage and support. It's easy to see why she writes these novels: she's too afraid to have a real life adventure.

For the past three months, Alexandra has been struggling to finish her newest book; she doesn't have all the information she needs about volcanoes. She e-mails Jack for information, knowing that he lives on an island with a volcano. Since Jack is away at sea, Nim responds, pretty much at the same time a monsoon hits the island. Believing that she's corresponding with the adventurous, male version of Alex Rover, Nim begs Alexandra for help, not only for the sake of her father--who is now lost at sea--but also because the crew of the Buccaneer cruise ship has discovered the island and plans to turn it into a tourist attraction. This means, of course, that Alexandra has to face her fears of the outside world, and we all know how difficult it can be to face a fear.

If this sounds to you like nothing more than an implausible kid's story, then you're not getting into the spirit of it. Consider the moment when Breslin fires an army of lizards onto a beach-load of tourists, or when Foster packs a suitcase full of soup cans and hand sanitizers, or when Butler receives a tool belt from a pelican; these moments are supposed to be fun, meaning they're not meant to be taken too seriously. On the same token, ""Nim's Island"" sends messages that are both positive and meaningful, and this is good because most of the better family films have done the exact same thing.

One of the most surprising things about this film is Jodie Foster, whose quirky fish-out-of-water role called for a strong comedic personality. Her career has been defined almost entirely by dramatic roles. Even as a child star, films like ""Taxi Driver"" and ""The Little Girl Who Lives Down the Lane"" never let a sense of humor emerge. It was refreshing to see her play a light-hearted character in an equally light-hearted movie. If only she and Breslin had been given more screen time together--their characters officially meet at the very end, which isn't really satisfying as far as plot is concerned. Then again, the film's message is overcoming obstacles on your own, so it's quite possible that they were supposed to be separated all throughout. Whatever the case, ""Nim's Island"" is a charming little fable, despite the fact that it's completely preposterous. But as I said earlier, a fairy tale doesn't always begin with ""Once upon a time"" and end with ""Happily ever after."" Sometimes, fairy tales are defined by nothing more than the good intentions of carefree filmmakers.",1207353600,,5334,4.762162162162162
