5798180,1,B00DGWZKHM,This is a short I have loved but will not be buying because the Yodelberg short.  The new mickey mouse shorts are utter trash and disappointing compared with what Disney has done in the past.,1383782400,,191,4.457142857142857
5798181,3,B00DGWZKHM,"I have an 80"" HDTV, so older/unrestored films/DVDs really show their age.  Before playing this new blu-ray of Mickey's Christmas Carol, I watched a bit of the same short film on the Walt Disney Treasures: Mickey Mouse in Living Color Vol. 2 DVD, since that's shown in anamorphic widescreen.  I am happy to say that the Blu-ray is indeed an obvious upgrade in video quality.  I did notice some shots were a bit soft and some scenes did look overly cropped, as one of the top reviews here mentioned, but for the most part, I'm happy with the upgraded video quality and glad I own this on Blu-ray.

One major disappointment - aside from the price: this is easily a $14.99 Blu-ray - although not really that surprising, was the omission of the original making-of documentary that is also available on the same Walt Disney Treasures DVD mentioned above.  Was it too much for them to restore that special in HD?

The other shorts are fine, especially the classic Pluto's Christmas Tree, which is also now in HD.  But I REALLY wish Disney would do on Blu-ray what they did on VHS back in the 80s and put out a full ""Walt Disney Christmas"" with all the Christmas short films on one collection.",1383609600,64,1185,4.535211267605634
5798182,4,B00DGWZKHM,"I know a lot of people here have complained about the digital restoration, but if you're like me and you only have your old VHS copy of the '80s it will look great to you. The picture is really clear but there are a few spots where they brightened it up so much that it looks a little odd depending on how good your TV screen is. Like I said, compared to my ancient old tape where the picture was so dark and dirty it looks nice and clean, but if you already have one of the previous DVD releases then you can skip this one.

However, what makes this blu ray for me are the shorts included, whose restoration look very good. It's very hard to find these shorts outside of trying to track down the out of print Disney Treasures or Classic Cartoon Favorites DVDs. There is also a Disney Christmas Carol sing-along included in the features.
The shorts are:
Yodelberg (all-new Minnie and Mickey)
The Hockey Champ (Donald and his nephews)
Pluto's Christmas Tree (Pluto and Chip & Dale)
The Art of Skiing (Goofy)
Corn Chips (Donald and Chip & Dale)

So if you're buying this for the first time on disc format then it's worth your money, but if you already have it on DVD then you can skip it if you don't care about the shorts. The digital restoration isn't as good as the Diamond Edition series, as you would expect, but it's clean and bright, and your kids will love being introduced to this classic!",1383609600,64,1396,4.344827586206897
5798183,1,B00DGWZKHM,"This movie, like Sword in the Stone and to a lesser extent, other Disney Classics, has been damaged heavily from extremely high use of DNR (Digital Noise Manipulation). In an effort to make it look modern and clean, Disney has rushed the restoration and turned the film into a soft mess.

Needless to say that Disney has once again opted to release it in 16x9 only (1,78:1), cutting a big portion of the top and the bottom of the frame. The framing is even tighter than the DVD's.

The audio is Dolby Digital 2.0.

NOT RECOMMENDED (terrible picture -blurred and cropped, lossy audio, high price)

If, like me, you love this movie to bits and want to add it to your collection, I advise you to contact Disney customer service and explain why you aren't buying this Blu-ray. Otherwise they'll just claim that customers don't like it enough.",1382918400,76,959,4.746987951807229
5798184,1,B00DGWZKHM,"After Sword In The Stone, another classic Disney short gets completely short-changed. I just read the review and saw the screenshots at blu-ray.com for this one. Filtered and noise-reduced to death, and robbed of all fine detail and film patina, this is an act of pure vandalism, like using marker pens to touch up a Van Gogh. It would have been far better to present the material as is, instead of subjecting it to this kind of plunder in the name of digital clean-up. Shame on you Disney, penny-pinching on your classics, and not even passing on those benefits to your customers. If you really must have this movie, wait till it reaches the sub-10$ bracket. Otherwise, avoid like the plague.",1382918400,21,693,4.735537190082645

5798186,4,B00DGWZKHM,I'm curious. Does anyone know what the other holiday shorts are? I wish a Walt Disney Christmas & a Disney christmas gift are included!!!  Those two along with carol were my favorite Disney holiday VHS movies!!!,1374624000,7,211,4.861111111111111
5798187,5,B00DGWZKHM,This has always been one of my favorite things to watch around Christmastime.  We had it recorded on a VHS tape when I was growing up and I was very happy to see it came on a dvd and then a blu-ray.  The quality's great for a Disney cartoon (obviously much better than my old VHS version).  Love it love it love it.  Every family should have this one!,1374537600,10,351,4.043478260869565
5798188,5,B00DGWZKHM,This is a great Christmas animated feature. Plus it does come with additional Christmas short cartoons. This will be a must have if you are a Disney fan.,1372809600,15,153,4.5
5798189,1,B00DGWZKHM,"I love this ""short."" But to sell this for anything more than 5 dollars is a scam.  At the time of writing this it is listed for over $33 dollars. This is a 26 minute short film, and it is described as being 95 minutes long which is false.",1372464000,33,238,3.857142857142857

5798193,5,B00DGWZKHM,I watched this when I was a kid. Back then they showed it over the holidays on tv.  I introduced it to my kids this past holiday and they watched it over and over. Love that they are enjoying this classic.,1518307200,,205,4.0
5798194,5,B00DGWZKHM,"A Christmas classic, but the best surprise in looking this version up was the special feature cartoons! What a bunch of fun bonuses on an already great feature!",1518134400,,160,4.75
5798195,1,B00DGWZKHM,"If you can, skip this and buy the Disney Animation Collection Volume 7. It has the the film as it should be. Unbutchered.

Disney destroyed this film in order to make it fill out widescreen TVs. They chopped the top and bottom off. It's a travesty they keep mutilating these films.

I attached 2 examples. In one, the ""counting house"" sign is cut out. In the other, you can't see Mickey is jumping off the chair onto a pile of books. Removing things like this really takes away from the movie.

The examples are endless. Through the whole thing characters are oddly shown from waist up, or the tops of their heads are cut off. Why would anyone prefer this? I'd avoid this at all costs, and I hope everyone stops buying these chopped up versions of Disney classics. Boycott any studio that does this. It's just as bad as what Lucas did to the original Star Wars movies!",1517875200,17,868,4.446540880503145

I'm writing the review though to tell people that this DVD includes a bunch of classic Christmas shorts, like Pluto's Christmas Tree, that I remember watching as a kid. I went looking for some of these Disney christmas specials i watched as a kid on Amazon and found VCR tapes and other people online talking about converting their useless VHS cassettes to dvd. No need! They are all included with this DVD, and in BluRay is even better. This was an amazing purchase, especially for the price.

5798227,4,B00DGWZKHM,"I loved this movie as a little girl and was excited to find it to share with my 4 year old. The picture quality of the DVD didn't appear to be remastered and did have some pixelation black spots here and there, but not so much that it distracted from the movie. The movie follows Scrooge McDuck as he learns hard lessons about the pitfalls of greed, selfishness, and treating people badly with the help of the ghosts of Christmas past, present, and future. I love the story and so did my daughter - it's also a great teachable moment about being blessed and helping those less fortunate.

The DVD also has bonus short cartoons that we had never seen before, but that we didn't like at all when we watched them. I felt they were a waste and just thrown on there to justify the $15 price tag for the 20-25 minute Christmas Carol movie. Overall, the price is worth it for the actual movie and we enjoy watching it now every Christmas, but the shorts were annoying and uninteresting.",1490572800,,979,4.4088397790055245

5798311,2,B00DGWZKHM,"The ""restoration"" of Mickey's Christmas Carol on this blu-ray is, as others have already pointed out, very poorly done.  The image has been aggressively scrubbed, making the lines and marks of the artists look like filtered blobs (worse than the job they did on sword in the stone). The overall image is very soft. Aaand this disc is overpriced for the amount of content on the disc.

The good news is that most of the other shorts on the disc look pretty good. The Art of Skiing looks great! Wish we could somehow tell Disney that that is a good benchmark for a faithful restoration.",1450742400,,584,4.552380952380952

5798317,4,B00DGWZKHM,"What a way for a beloved, star-studded, & Oscar-worthy holiday classic to celebrate such a big anniversary; just like with the 50th anniversary DVD/Blu-ray release of The Sword in the Stone, Mickey's Christmas Carol is also in a Faux-Widescreen format for its 30th anniversary DVD/Blu-ray release. It's true Mickey's Christmas Carol was originally in a natural Widescreen format, since it was seen that way in one of Mickey's color Treasures tins, but Disney didn't bother to reuse and further remaster the Treasures print for this release; they seemed to use a Fullscreen print and crop the top and bottom of the picture, to make it in Widescreen. The picture's not only off at times, but so's the sound, even more so than in Mickey's Magical Christmas: Snowed in at the House of Mouse from 2001! It's a lucky thing Disney learned its lesson in 2014 for Mickey's Once Upon A Christmas for Blu-ray; instead of it being in Faux-Widescreen, like on TV as Paramount's 4 Peanuts movies followed suit on ABC Family AND Discovery Family, and their own new DVDs, it was an all-new HD restoration in a natural Widescreen format, as seen in a very limited theatrical run, only with no dirt and debris to the naked eye, if at all. The bonus shorts here are one of the new Mickey shorts, what my niece calls ""Crazy Mickey"", Yodelburg, without its end credits, along with much older and greater Christmas and wintry shorts; Pluto's Christmas Tree (1952), The Hockey Champ (1939), The Art of Skiing (1941), and Corn Chips (1951), all in HD, in their original Fullscreen format, and mostly in uncut Have A Laugh prints, even bypassing the restorations of the Treasures tins they're in, most of the time, aside from having incorrect copyright dates at times; for example, The Art of Skiing was released in 1941, but the Have A Laugh print says 1943, since I'm very good with Roman numerals. We should all get on Disney's bootie and make them rerelease Mickey's Christmas Carol AND The Sword in the Stone on Blu-ray, in their original natural formats, instead of Faux-Widescreen, and at a much lower price like the good old days of classic Disneytoon DVDs. Like I keep saying with those, just be thankful for what you still have, and have a merry Christmas, too!",1446076800,3,2246,4.776349614395887

5798335,3,B00DGWZKHM,"Gee Wiz! I've forgotten how short this movie really is. I remember liking this adaptation years ago, but now in my grown-up life, it appears to be casually wanting in a lot of areas. You tend to wonder why they made it so ridiculously short. With the Disney humor and Disney characters complementing the piece, it's just hard to understand why they wanted it to be only like 25 minutes long! There's so much more they could have done with it. Maybe a young kid may not mind all the holes in the plot that the diminutive length of this movie creates, but someone more mature may find him/herself griping about inconsistencies in the storyline.

It May be good if you have young kids in the house during Christmas time, but if you're over the age of say... 10, you may not find this DVD worth the heavy purchase price, even with those extra Disney cartoons included.",1424044800,,864,4.503184713375796

The voice actor who did the spanish translation of donald duck had the same quacky accent that donald has in the English version. That was very impressive.

Neither of us noticed any issues with sound or picture. He enjoyed that there were little cartoon ""commercials"" when he paused the actual movie. Neither of us liked the Yodelberg short.

5798426,4,B00DGWZKHM,"An excellent re-telling of the Dickens' classic. Also a wonderful reunion of classic Disney friends who have not appeared on the screen in a very long time. Characters from ""Ichabod and Mr. Toad"" appear in here (including Mr. Toad himself as Fezziwig) and of course, the original classic Disney villain, Pegleg Pete, take a terrific turn as the Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come. The Giant from Mickey & The Beanstalk is here as the Ghost of Christmas Present. Jiminy Cricket as the Ghost of Christmas Past. Goofy as Jacob Marley. The list of classic characters just goes on and on.

Why only four stars then? Well, even with the addition of a handful of classic shorts to go along with Christmas Carol...it's kind of a short runtime for the cost. ""Christmas Carol"" is right around 30 minutes and the shorts only had another half-hour or so. It's just about an hour's worth of viewing in total, and a little spendy for something that short.",1387065600,,937,4.678787878787879
5798427,5,B00DGWZKHM,This is a great movie for everyone. Disney can turn a big book like a Christmas carol into a 30 minute classic movie it's better when you see your favorite Disney characters portray the characters from the book. even though this is only 30 minutes long it is really enjoyable and this 30th anniversary edition comes with 5 classic Disney shorts. the shorts are great. this is a awesome movie. Disney never disappoints. if you have not seen this movie then I recommend you do,1386892800,,474,4.588235294117647
5798428,1,B00DGWZKHM,"Back in September I purchased Robin Hood and The sword in the stone on bluray. When I went to redeem the digital copies that were claimed to be inside. I was annoyed when it turned out that I could not redeem the ""digital copies"" on itunes. They were ultraviolet copies which is different than digital copies.  I called Disney and I was told they were getting alot of complaints about this issue and they would choose a different path in the future.

Fast forward to December. It's Christmas time and our family loves Christmas movies. We had purchased this title back when it was called Classic Holiday stories VOL 9. The Disc contained other wonderful Christmas shorts that our family has enjoyed for a while so we thought we'd upgrade to bluray. We were disappointed to see that the really great shorts like ""The Small One"" were not there. Haven't seen the other shorts  but I am disappointed as it is not worth $25.",1386460800,,919,4.591463414634147
5798429,5,B00DGWZKHM,"Great adaptation of the holiday classic for kids.  I didn't mind the restoration - overall the new movie looks great compared to my old VHS tape!  The shorts included at the end and the sing-along intermission add to the value as well.  My only complaint is not with the product, but with Disney not allowing you to use your digital copy code for iTunes.  You must pick between Amazon, Vudu, and Google Play.  We use an Apple TV, so this very much limits the value of the digital copy for us.  Wish this had been specifically indicated somewhere on the packaging so we could make an informed decision about buying.  In this case, since this is Blu-ray combo pack only, we probably would have bought anyway.  Something to think about going forward with Disney movies - if the digital copy is important to you, check the digitalcopyplus.com info and help tab under participating providers -> ""How do I tell which Digital copy providers are available with my Blu-ray or DVD before I buy.""  This will give you a list of the options you have when you go to download the digital copy.",1386460800,3,1078,4.572916666666667

5798431,4,B00DGWZKHM,"Disney brings another celebrated film to Blu-ray just in time for the holidays with its release of ""Mickey's Christmas Carol: 30th Anniversary Edition."" Although Charles Dickens' classic tale has been adapted for the screen dozens upon dozens of times, this version stands out as one of the best. Its use of everyone's favorite cartoon characters to bring the story to life is charming and the pace is perfect to keep the attention of children of all ages.

The greedy Ebenezer Scrooge (Scrooge McDuck) doesn't understand the meaning of Christmas. Four ghosts (Goofy, Jiminy Cricket, Willie the Giant, and Black Pete) visit him Christmas Eve to show the old miser the error of his ways. He'll also get a sneak peek of what he can expect if he keeps traveling down the same road in life.

""Mickey's Christmas Carol: 30th Anniversary Edition"" is presented in 1080p high-definition with an aspect ratio of 1.78:1. The picture is clean and features a vibrant color palette. It's obvious great care was taken in its meticulous digital restoration, as the proof is on the screen.

It's only fair to point out that I've read complaints from tech-heads who say ""Mickey's Christmas Carol"" has been cleaned up to the point that it's lost any ""organic"" flavor. Everyday viewers will never notice or give any thought to this point. All they care about is the clarity of the picture in front of them.

The audio quality of ""Mickey's Christmas Carol: 30th Anniversary Edition"" leaves a bit to be desired for those wishing for a true surround sound experience. All we get here is a Dolby Digital 2.0 mix which limits the experience of home viewers with an expansive theater set-up. I'm not entirely sure why Disney wouldn't find a way or take the time to upgrade the sound to 5.1 or 7.1.

""Mickey's Christmas Carol: 30th Anniversary Edition"" is loaded with fun bonus material. The Disney Intermission gives viewers the opportunity to sing along with Mickey and his buddies as they belt out ""We Wish You a Merry Christmas,"" Deck the Halls,"" and ""Jingle Bells."" Bonus animated shorts are also found. ""Yodelberg"" is an all-new cartoon which features great artwork that marries the animated style of the classic Disney shorts with a modern look. Other shorts include ""The Hockey Champ,"" ""Pluto's Christmas Tree,"" ""The Art of Skiing,"" and ""Corn Chips.""

It's hard to believe the time has come for a Blu-ray version of ""Mickey's Christmas Carol: 30th Anniversary Edition."" I remember seeing the film when it came out paired with ""The Rescuers."" Talk about making someone feel old. ""Mickey's Christmas Carol"" stands the test of time and remains as entertaining for the whole family as it was when it first hit movie screens.",1386115200,,2702,4.9144736842105265

Please also know that I do enjoy ordering products from amazon and plan to still do so. However, I went ahead and purchased the viewing of Mickeys Christmas Carol from my companys website as a show of support for being a Walmart employee.  With that said, Mickeys Christmas Carol revolves around an ambitious but stern character who is forced to see how his past actions have affected some of the other  characters that he came into contact with.  A part of him starts to show remorse when seeing how he hurt someone that loved him.  Mickeys Christmas Carol is a heartfelt family film that also includes the following bonuses:  Mickey Mouse In Yodelberg, The Hockey Champ, Plutos Christmas Tree, The Art of Skiing, and Corn Chips.",1386028800,2,828,4.722222222222222

I own the slightly older Walt Disney Animation Collection: Classic Short Films DVD with this same movie on it, and I like that one much better because it is still 4:3. I think the restoration job looks pretty good on a big TV, but I know that some of the older, hard-core collectors may say otherwise. I'd say don't get rid of your old DVD/VHS copies of you still plan to upgrade to the Blu-Ray. Watch them side by side and you'll see how much they cropped it. I don't understand why they couldn't have kept it in 4:3! Otherwise, I'd still recommend getting it because the additional shorts are different from the older DVDs...It's kinda nice to have those. The Blu-Ray includes: Yodelburg, The Hockey Champ, Pluto's Christmas Tree, The Art of Skiing, and Corn Chips. For reference, my older DVD copy includes Pluto's Christmas Tree, The Small One, and Santa's Workshop. So yeah, if you have your old DVD, just keep it. If you want the Blu-Ray for the different shorts, go for it. But it's not worth it to buy if you're looking for an upgrade of Mickey's Christmas Carol, because they cropped the thing, and that's just lame!",1384905600,22,1255,4.582222222222223

5798438,5,B00DGWZKHM,"This was the VERY start of the second golden age of Disney animation. Without this there wouldn't been a 'Little Mermaid','Beauty and the Beast' or 'Lion King'. Disney took quite a chance on this as they had a lot riding on how this did. It's certainly possible that the Disney we know today would be far different than it is. I don't really like Michael Eisner but he sure was right about taking a chance on this.

The shorts contained on this are as follows:

1. All-new 'Yodelberg' which is Disney's latest attempt to update Mickey to make him more reverent today. It doesn't fail but it's not a home-run either. I didn't care a whole lot for the story or Mickey's voice - I would rate this a 3 out of 5 stars.

2. 'Hockey Champ' was next. It's a Donald and his nephews piece that I don't believe I've seen before. It's cute and filled with imaginative parts. I would rate this one 4.5 out of 5 stars.

3. 'Pluto's Christmas Tree' was next. I have seen this a couple of times. It is very cute and well done. I would rate this one at least a 4.75 out of 5.

4. 'The Art of Skiing' was 4th with Goofy. This was well done and had many good parts however Goofy has never been a big favorite of mine. I would rate this a 4.25 out of 5.0.

5. 'Corn Chips' was the last bonus short. It is Donald with Chip and Dale. It was very, very cute. I would rate this one a 4.5 out of 5.

And last was the headliner - ""Mickey's Christmas Carol'. I watched this on a 51 inch top-of the-line LCD. I felt the picture and sound were as good as they could be. In fact the picture on all of the shorts was exceptional. I was impressed with the restoration.

The only way this could have been better, for me, would have been to have some added scenes that had been cut, etc. 'Mickey's Christmas Carol' is the rare 'movie' that would benefit from being 15 or 20 minutes longer. I would rate this 4.75 to 5.0 out of 5.

The 3 songs as a intermission were just ok - would of been nice to have 2 or 3 more songs.

My only other very minor complaint is it would have been great to have 1 or 2  more Christmas/winter shorts.

Overall I would rate this a VERY, VERY HIGH 9.75 out of 10 stars - VERY HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!",1384041600,6,2192,4.095794392523365
5798439,5,B00DGWZKHM,"I really find the Amazon marketplace to be a place of ridicule. Shoppers routinely compare Wal-Mart's low prices or the eventual price drop at Black Friday shopping. What is the likelihood that these same people would take the time to mention digital noise reduction or even that the kids might like it, but not adults as stated here as a worthy critique to not buy product. So adults are better off buying Transformers for the mildly suggest prepubescent sexual innuendos and kids are better off watching tv then being bought DVDs for the their own entertainment. Hello! For who is this product...? The perverted fool watching Transformers or a young person who wants to feel the magic of Disney?

If however, Disney bashing has become the elite martyrdom for all commentators then I dutifully dissent seeing a need to fulfill my own thirst for animation that should not be taken off the market.

If it is deduced that Sword in the Stone was restored badly, then so has my copy of the Lion King right? I disagree. It is obvious that however old a film is it still quality technique for its time. One to look beyond what you would like in animation( like CGI effects and the like) and what actually is there might be apparent of the frugal taste of the critic and not of the the entire storyline as it works with the animation.

8593039,1,B00DGWZKHM,"A wretched ""restoration"" as bad as the infamous ""The Sword in the Stone"" debacle. It's not quite as horrible, but it's right up there. This is not how Disney animation actually looks folks. This is more like VHS standards stamped onto a bluray. It's sad, but I can't lie to you here. There is no reason to buy this. Stream it somewhere or wait for a 4K version that is truly something decent. It honestly pains me that Disney does this to its films.

The animation all around is fantastic, and the story is timeless. But why did they have to go make this look like some blurred out abomination with VHS levels of detail? There might be a few improvements from the DVD, but not many. They even applied sharpening after the DNR, which is just completely insane. Who in the heck is running the show here? For good measure it's also improperly cropped LOL. AND you can see the unaltered version in the menus! It boggles the mind how this product was even created.

I definitely stopped in my tracks when Disney DNR took out some detail from Robin Hood and Cinderella, but when it got as bad as The Sword in the Stone I took on a layer of revulsion that hasn't gone away. This is not how you treat art, and this has nothing to do with making something look modern. This is trash-tier restoration by people that simply do not care.

DO NOT BUY. Stream it somewhere. There is an actual uncropped version without DNR on Netflix. It's part of Snowed in at the House of Mouse I think. It is much better than the actual bluray, which should tell you something. It's incredibly ridiculous Disney chooses to treat their films like this much less actually release them on a high-definition format as is. Truly contemptuous of their customers sometimes.",1525996800,,1738,4.511111111111111
