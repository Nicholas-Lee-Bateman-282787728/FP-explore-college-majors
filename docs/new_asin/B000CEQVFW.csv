8098170,1,B000CEQVFW,"This is a lousy movie, and it is a shame. The Tchoupi series are all very innocent and sweet and revolve around small daily events like a new kitten, planting a garden, etc. This movie has a cheap storyline involving a menacing black shadow with yellow slit eyes who steals special toys. It is genuinely frightening. Tchoupi does unrealistic things like drive all over town in his toy car with his friends. Pilou's robot can fly and attack people. There is an awkward dream sequence that looks like Mario Brothers where Tchoupi shoots and is shot and attacked by the scary menace. It's just really bad, and it is too bad. Shame on the producers! (If you buy this, note it is Zone 1/North America, even though it is all in French.)",1334448000,,730,4.537878787878788
