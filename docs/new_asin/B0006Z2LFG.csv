The overall story is well written.  I rented the movie on a whime no knowing much about it but now I am looking to purchase the DVD.",1116720000,2,307,4.62962962962963
2197810,2,B0006Z2LFG,"This movie will be no landmark

in 21st century film history.

However, in terms of gore and violence,

""Red Riding Hood"" is a champion.

This film is successful in its attempt

to shock and disturb the viewer.

There's no great acting achievements

to witness here, but the lead actress

definitely maintains a psychotic air with

a straight face throughout the movie. Sadly,

there isn't much else to say about this

movie that's positive.

  The credibility level of this movie is less than 0.

For starters, an unseen mother abandons her 12 year old

and runs off with a man 20 years her junior. BUT WAIT!!!

She is considerate enough to leave her with untold thousands

of dollars and a posh apartment in Rome. Get real. Also,

why is no one ever suspicious of a 12 year old walking

through the streets of Rome at all hours of the night wearing a black hooded cape and red boots?

  Nonetheless, this is a bold interpretation of an old tale.

I did appreciate the attempt to parallel Jenni

with Don Quixote. At least they tried to inject some intelligence into this movie. Unfortunately, it was

a low dosage injection that didn't quite ciruclate

through the rest of the film.",1114905600,2,1184,4.621359223300971
2197811,4,B0006Z2LFG,"Let me explain my 4 star rating. I can see why someone would give this a good review, and I can also see why someone would give it a terrible review. Yes it had bad acting in it. As a matter of fact, the lead girl was about the worst child actress I have ever seen. She was terrible. Yes it was a B horror movie, at time very generic, IT HAD TERRIBLE MUFFLED SOUND and it was very predictable (I knew who ""George"" really was in the first 15 minutes of the movie). The movie also stole ideas from every other movie, BUT for some reason I really liked this movie. Maybe I'm just a sucker for revenge plots, and vigilante plots. Or maybe I just bought into the gore, but I thought it was a twisted spin on an over told story. I think they successfully beat a dead horse. The gore in this is very outdated. By that I mean, you just don't see horror movies these days putting that much gore into a movie anymore. For that, I was generous with my stars. Next, some of the things this girl does to her granny are just plain twisted. Yes, stolen ideas from the movies like ""Misery,"" but we are talking her own granny! Anyway, my gore meter was pretty full after this one, It made me laugh. I was laughing at the dumb acting, the bad lines, and the way that some of the victims died.  I think the movie is a 4 star movie and probably need to see a shrink. If I had to compare it to something, it would be a generic ""Donnie Darko"", meets ""Misery"", meets ""Omen"", meets ""Death Wish"" (maybe?) For the record though, I should mention that my wife thought it was stupid and would probably give it 1 or 2 stars.",1112918400,2,1595,4.112179487179487
2197812,3,B0006Z2LFG,"Basically what you have is this kid, Jenny, who is really mentally deranged and does crazy damage to people who she thinks has wronged her.  The grandmother gets caught up and trapped in her delusions and is put through utter hell.  I literally had to cover my eyes and not watch some of the stuff, it was that GROSS and the most memorable one involved a nail gun shot straight into an eyeball.",1111881600,16,394,4.383561643835616
2197813,5,B0006Z2LFG,"It is NOT that bad of a movie. Of course, if you are expecting a horror movie where some masked killer with no motive runs around killing people over and over then this isn't for you. Yes, there is a ""wolf"" named George who is in a black cape and white wolf-looking mask, but if you watch the movie you realize that George isn't real, and that he is either a figment of the girls imagination or, that George is really the entity that takes over the girl (jenny) when she murders her victims. Jenny is a 12 year old girl living in Rome in an apartment all by herself, because her mother has once again left her and run off with a man. Her grandmother was left in custody of her and comes to Rome to ""stay"" with Jenny for a while, then take her back to New York with her. Jenny doesn't want to go anywhere, she is staying where she is and so is her Grandmother. She's intelligent for her age, structured, disciplined, organized, and some may percieve her as very controlling/bossy. They show when she was young that she had a little black lab named George, and George is her best friend and confidant and the only one she can trust. Now, that she's 12 George and her are inseperable. Except George is a very tall thing, with a black cape and hood, and a white make/face that looks like an abstract version of a wolf. Only she can see George of course, but she thinks he is real. They find their victims during the day, and punish them (by killing them) at night. They aren't just random people, they're people that Jenny sees committing crimes. For instance, one woman steals a bottle of wine. So she punishes all the offenders. I thought the movie was great. Rent it or buy it and see for yourself.",1111708800,3,1697,4.30625
2197814,2,B0006Z2LFG,"I saw the cover to the movie and after reading the synopsis on the back decided to rent.  Sounded original and the wolve mask appeared somewhat frightening at first glance. Then I watched the movie.  I am a major horror movie fan and have seen some crap in my day.  Yes, this was a disappointing movie.  But it certainly was not the worst.  It at least was done on somewhat decent quality film and not amateur like alot of horror movies. The idea behind the story is very original (tying in a fairy tale and ridding the world of sinners, Sleepaway Camp 2 and 3). Even some of the incidents are somewhat amusing.  Sadly enough, the main character is the worst actor. The grandmother wins best actor. What ruins the film is the horrible ending.  That scene could have been done creepier with less cheese and saved the movie.",1110931200,2,822,4.476510067114094
2197815,1,B0006Z2LFG,"1) this movie (and I use the word losely) is pathetically predictable; 2) worst acting ever; 3) worst writing ever; 4) worst soundtrack ever.  This is a story about a physcho young girl who has this imaginary friend who commits unjustified acts of vigilante, including acts like handicapping her grandmother by taking out her knee cap, etc.  I cannot for the life of me understand why anyone, upon seeing the screen writing of this movie, would actually put a dime into it.  The only people who would even entertain the idea that this movie is worth watching are either retarded or disturbed.  There isn't even enough imagination here to satisfy the people who are just into gore.  If there is a minus 5 star rating that's what I'd rate this movie as.  Oh my God I cannot believe what a waste of time this is; this movie needs to take the title of worst movie ever made (currently the title belongs to I Spit on Your Grave, I believe).  DON'T DO IT!",1110758400,5,949,4.482558139534884
2197826,2,B0006Z2LFG,The other reviews pretty much cover this movie to death (pun intended) and are pretty accurate. I would like to throw my 2 cents in here... I think the acting was horrible and really detracted from the movie.,1250640000,,208,4.5
2197827,1,B0006Z2LFG,"The only good thing about this movie is that *some* of the filmwork and a *few* of the ideas are interesting.  Otherwise, this awful story turned my stomach with its wholly despicable lead character, largely predictable plot, and the glee with which the scenes of torture were portrayed.  I suppose that on the other hand, films that are truly sickening are hard to come by, but that wasn't what I was hoping for when I rented it.  I almost took it back to the store halfway through, and if I had, I wouldn't have missed much.  The father/daughter reunion ending was idiotic and more along the lines of what you might see in some high-school-made B flick.",1189036800,2,655,4.572649572649572
2197828,1,B0006Z2LFG,"I am sorry, but I really wanted to like this movie but found out that I really hated it. To me, this teenager of a girl needs to be institutionalized for the rest of her life. She is self righteous to the point of being very obnoxious which made the movie very unbelievable and down right stupid. I am not a person to write bad reviews, but this movie does more than deserve a bad review. If you want to see a horror flick about a fairy tale, then see the tooth fairy. Yes, even that one is very stupid but compared to this, it is an excellent movie.",1187827200,2,550,4.055045871559633
2197829,1,B0006Z2LFG,"When I say this is possibly the worst movie I've ever seen, I mean MOVIE, not just horror flick.  I rented it with a friend of mine based on the cover, and we regretted it completely.  I actually had Blockbuster refund me my money for it.

Anyway, the story is about a girl named Jenny, who is twelve years old, has thick, ugly eyebrows, and thinks she is the judge and executor of mankind.  Rich and abandoned by her mother in Rome, she has unlimited money, and wants to keep it this way.  Deranged and confused, she has a twisted sense of morality in which she hunts and kills those who perform things she deems unjust, with the help of her silent and presumably imaginary friend, George.

For example, she witnesses a woman steal a bottle of wine -- she inconspicuously approaches the woman and asks for her name and other information, under the guise of ""I'm an American student doing a report.""  Then, later she and her friend George find the woman in a subway station and kill her, chopping off her hands, and exuding justice on her.

This sounds like it might be a good way to present a film, but it fails horribly.  The acting by the girl Jenny is terrible.  Not only is it bad acting, but she throws in a cheesy ""evil grin,"" every time she gets a new idea on how to murder someone.  The grin alone was enough to make me want to slaughter the director for making this film, in my own sense of justice.

Anyway, things get a little crazy when Jenny falls for her tutor and tries to seduce him (remember, she's only 12), and her grandmother arrives to take custody of her and take her back to America.

The bottom line - Jenny finds people she doesn't like, then kills them.  There's not much depth, the acting is subpar (except for the grandmother, who is decent), and by the thirty minute mark you'll be ready to trade it in for something with Bruce Campbell.

My suggestion -- toss this one aside.  This one is so bad, you can't even laugh at it's silliness.  A total waste of time.  Pass.",1172620800,4,1998,4.354054054054054

A spoiled brat genius rich girl gets her kicks by stalking the streets of Rome 'punishing sinners'.

is no easy task and to make a horror movie good is by far the

hardest look at comedy,drama & action see how many good ones there are and then compare to all the good horrors?horror's

don't even come close,so to see even a O.K. horror film in the

year 2000 is a treat. With red riding hood you are going to like the lead character or hate her(my friends did)I will point out the good points of RED there is a scene in which susan and her

friend george follow a shoplifter to a subway and the wolf plunges a knife in the woman that SCREAM fans would be proud

of,also the dentist was very funny (MARIA!!!)and his nurse was

a plus.(va,va,voom)but most of all there is one scene where

jenny(satta)is talking to george her wolf and she is putting on

her shoes and saying how everyone must pay she looks up at george and James K Cimini directs this wolfs mask inside red

tapestry that would make John Carpenter & Tobe Hooper say

""WOW MAN""so again is it great well no but how many great horror

films are there between 2000-2006 yeah,yeah thought so. Again

2197834,3,B0006Z2LFG,"With lush Rome backgrounds and a rather unique plot, RED RIDING HOOD is a little better than I had expected.  Newcomer Susan Satta looking like a feminine young Corey Feldman plays Jenny, a somewhat deranged 12 year old who takes it upon herself to bring justice to criminal types.  This justice is meted out in pretty gory violence, with the aid of her mysterious friend George.  Kathleen Archebald combines the hammishness of Tallulah Bankhead and Joan Crawford in her role as the actress grandmother of Jenny who comes to Rome to take the child back to New York.  Of course, Jenny doesn't want to go and she goes to extreme measures to keep granny disabled.

A weird little thriller, with some unique twists, RED RIDING HOOD is actually a derivative of psycho thrillers dating back to BAD SEED, PSYCHO and others, and despite its innate cheesiness, it's a diverting thriller for fans of the genre.",1126483200,13,900,4.780645161290322
2197835,2,B0006Z2LFG,"Red Riding Hood is an odd, offbeat movie to say the least. A marriage of French art film and horror movie, this is not your typical film. The basic premise is that Jenny, the troubled daughter of a murdered Judge, is abandoned in Rome by her floozy mother. Yet Jenny is happy in her circumstance, because at 12 she has unlimited freedom, until her grandmother, Rose, comes to bring her back to America. Jenny proceeds to launch a campaign of murder and terror on her grandmother, tutor, and all of Rome.

While this movie is a marriage of art and horror, it's a rocky marriage at best. At times the movie descends into wackiness, with an original song track of cute songs that at times distracts from the scene. The ending is beyond horror, into an odd, head scratching finale. Jenny is utterly unlikable, which makes the film hard to enjoy.

Overall, not the best movie out there.",1116806400,2,881,4.569620253164557

8044126,3,B0006Z2LFG,"Red Riding Hood (Giacomo Cimini, 2003)

Red Riding Hood is another of those films I seem to be drawn to that was made in another country, horribly mismarketed in America, and suffered greatly for it in initial release. Usually it happens to southeast Asian supernatural dramas that get brought over as Yet Another Asian Horror Film, but in this case we have an Italian black comedy/thriller/musical/character study that was incorrectly called a horror flick. And if you go into it expecting a horror film (or, worse, a horror ""retelling"" of the Little Red Riding Hood fairy tale), well, you're probably going to end up being one of the people who've given the movie, as of this writing, a 38% at Rotten Tomatoes and a 4.5 at IMDB. (Not that the recent horror retelling of said fairy tale, released in 2011 and starring Amanda Seyfried, did much better; 11% critical and 39% popular on RT, 5.2 on IMDB.) But if you go into it with no expectations and an open mind, you may find it more enjoyable than you expect. It's not great, but it's certainly not as bad as the ratings at the big websites would have you believe.

Plot: a young girl named Jennifer McKenzie (Susanna Satta in her only screen appearance to date) has been left alone in her mother's palatial apartment in Rome...and she prefers it that way, with only her tutor, Tom (Exorcist: The Beginning's Rob David), on whom she has a major-league crush, and her imaginary...or is he?...friend George (Simone Dipascasio in his only screen appearance) to keep her company. While Tom teaches her about art and literature, she learns very different lessons from George, whom she takes out cruising the streets at night, looking for sinners upon whom she can visit vigilante justice. Life is going well for Jennifer, if not for her victims, until her Aunt Rose  (Kathleen Archebald, another newbie) comes to put her back under adult supervision, a move she does not take to kindly at all. Never fear, George is on the case...

To be fair to the critics, there are a number of shortcomings in this movie, and the vituperation directed against the film from almost every direction has managed to hit on a few of them (in that stopped-clock kind of way). Most of the actors here are, in fact, amateurs, though I don't think that detracts from the film nearly as much as many others seem to; Susanna Satta's overacting, especially, gives the film an otherworldly, cartoonish quality that fits in quite well with the fantasy content here. Then there's the whole musical aspect. Which I don't know what to say about--you're either going to love it or hate it. I came in on the latter side, though that's probably my general dislike of musicals showing through rather than any dislike of this material in particular. And I'm not entirely sure where Cimini was attempting to go with the film's violence; he didn't succeed if he was going for the over-the-top cartoony violence of a film like (the original) Dawn of the Dead, and the more realistic feel he seems to have been aiming for is out-of-place in the film we ended up with. That's going to turn a lot of people off.

Still, if you're looking for a slasher film that attempts to do something altogether different with the genre, Red Riding Hood is one to look up. ** ",1356393600,2,3268,4.694589877835951
