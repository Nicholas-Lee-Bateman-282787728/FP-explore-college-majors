8573745,1,B00BTQ6BXO,"This DVD is not about advanced retriever training;This DVD is is very basic, focusing on training a dog
for his first blind retrieve...about the level of beginning training for intermediate hunt test dogs.

Topics covered include basic obedience, force fetch, force to pile, place command,basic baseball casting, wagon wheel, basic memory blinds, mark then blind, honoring, and basic 75-yard cold blinds.
Basic e-collar force is used.
Much of the training involves teaching the retriever to go to place boards and teaching the retriever to run to white targets (ala James Spencer methods from the 1980s).

There is nothing about advanced marking concepts in this DVD.

The DVD does NOT cover casting concepts such as silent versus verbal casts, rotations,angle backs,digbacks,
using attrition in cast refusals, literal versus momentum casting, teaching a retriever to fight wind, terrain, and water factors, etc.

It does NOT cover casting drills such as walking baseball, split casting drill, tune-up drills, etc.
The DVD does NOT cover  lining drills such as bird boy blinds, chair slot drills, barrier board drills, channel blinds, posion bird blinds,
etc.

 It doe NOTcover concepts such as re-entries on water blinds, angled entry and exits, keyhole blinds,

If you are really interested in advanced retriever training,I recommend either Evan Grahams Transition 3-DVD set
or Mike Lardy's Total Retriever Training, or Fowl Dogs DVD 3 and 4.  If your interested in advanced handling, I recommend Dave Rorem's the art and science of handling retrievers DVD.

If your interested in advanced retriever drills, I recommend Building a Retriever -- Drills and More by Carol F. Cassity (Paperback Book)",1392854400,2,1698,5.373584905660377
