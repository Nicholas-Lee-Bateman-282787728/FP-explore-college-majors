8058326,4,B00097C1EW,"The fake documentary American Alien is surprisingly well-done. I hesitate to call it a mockumentary, because it treats even its most ridiculous interviewees with sympathy. It's a post-disappearance tale of a Mr. Baron Dixon, a man convinced for decades that a UFO would take him away. We meet his good-for-nothing friends, cruel coworkers who mock him, a mom and a dog who love him, and an ex-girlfriend who found something wonderful in this big obsessed fortysomething guy.

The performers are almost uniformly flawless in acting as regular weirdos being interviewed. I mean, really, these people are like high-skilled amateurs out of a Christopher Guest film.

I was left wondering and surprised in the end that I cared about almost every person presented and excited to have discovered another gem in my wanderings here on Earth.",1240704000,,832,5.155555555555556
