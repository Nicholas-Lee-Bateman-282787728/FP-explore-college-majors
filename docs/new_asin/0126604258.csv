7787869,1,0126604258,"I purchased this video to play in my undergraduate Physiological Psychology class.  I did not realize it was simply filmed interviews.  The material was also rather complex and I debated on whether to use the video in class.  I was worried it would not hold the students attention and the information presented may be too complex for the class.  After much debate I decided to play the DVD for my undergraduate Physiological Psychology class.  It was not a success.  Students could not focus to the content because (1)the video and audio were out of alignment, (2) the speaker had very bushy eyebrows, and (3) the speaker was wearing a western bolo tie.",1358553600,,653,4.785714285714286
