3465968,5,B001AR014W,This is a breathtaking documentary showing the true colors of the Grand Canyon!  You will not regret adding this beautiful documentary to your BluRay collection.,1247443200,2,161,5.44
3465969,1,B001AR014W,I had the same problem as one of the previous veiwers.  This Blue Ray DVD does not work on my new Samsung Blue Ray disc player.  What a dissapointment.  I had bought my copy at Borders and had hoped to buy one here  that would work.  Grateful for the reviewer before me that shared his comments.,1246665600,8,295,4.196428571428571
3465970,1,B001AR014W,"I tried two copies of this disk--neither plays in my brand-new Samsung BD-1600 Blu-Ray player, which plays all the other Blu-Ray disks I've put into it.  Only the menu plays--you can't get past it, and eventually the player locks up and has to be powered down to get the disk out.  Save you money and buy another video on the Grand Canyon.",1245024000,8,339,4.451612903225806

3465972,2,B001AR014W,Quality could have been much better. There is a lot more to see and experience than what is seen here.,1225670400,5,102,4.15
8279152,1,B001AR014W,"I had high hopes for this video. I hoped it would be like a Planet Earth for the ultra-scenic Grand Canyon. Wrong! Insipid narration through out, but they compensated for the dialog with shoddy, unsharp, out of focus camera work. This is a blu-ray but most of the video had dvd resolution at best. and there were places when the resolution//focus was so poor it might have been shot on VHS. And the video seemed to be shot without regard for lighting angles and haze. I was looking for hi-contrast dramatic video showing the canyon in all its glory. What a disappointment. If I'd made this video I'd be ashamed to sell it. Save your money - total dreck.",1497744000,2,653,4.495798319327731

8279155,5,B001AR014W,we are planning a trip in a few months and this gives us an idea what we want to go and what area we need to go.,1362096000,,112,3.185185185185185
8279156,5,B001AR014W,"A grand and glorious tour of one of natures wonders. This one will be watched over and over and the price here at $4.99 is a bargain indeed. As is usual with these videos there are a few ""fill"" scenes that are obviously not filmed in HD but that is not a big deal for the overall quality and I still give it a 5 star rating.",1351036800,,324,3.8507462686567164
8279157,3,B001AR014W,"The Scenic National Parks Grand Canyon Blu-ray was informative and enjoyable, but to my surprise only half of the disc's 98 minute duration was dedicated to the Grand Canyon.  The remainder covered other National Parks nearby, not the Grand Canyon.  Nothing in the product description indicated this was the case.  Like some other reviewers, I too had issues playing back this disc.  Specifically, the disc navigation menus would sometimes not appear, and the opening scenes and music would loop forever.  I'd applied an update to my Samsung Blu-ray player, which momentarily fixed the issue, but it again occurred the next time I turned on my player.  This is the only Blu-ray disc I've had that has had problems with the menuing/playback, so I'm not sure what's different about the way the menus were done on this disc vs. other discs.

In summary, the content was good, but I wish the entire duration covered only the Grand Canyon.  The problems with the disc playback may also cause you some head scratching and frustration.",1329264000,6,1028,4.936046511627907
8279158,5,B001AR014W,"It is difficult to capture the essence of one of the earth's greatest spectacles. This DVD takes you from the north & south rims to the amazing mid canyon country to the mighty Colorado. It even includes the magnificent Havasupai blue green waterfalls. If you're planning a trip, it offers many ideas of things to consider doing. It made me realize that exploring the grandest canyon of them all takes time.",1321315200,,407,4.746478873239437
8279159,4,B001AR014W,"As a another reviewer said - you can't hope to capture the real epic grandure of the spectacular scenery on any form of video - but this does come close.  I've got several versions of the Canyon on DVD, including ""Canyon Dreams"" and a transfer from 45 minutes of 16mm film from a personal trip made in 1970....and none of these are as pristine as this DVD.  I have no issue with this playing on either of my SONY BD players - so the problems some people are having must be directly related to the software in the SAMSUNG ( try finding the online upgrade and update the machines - the copy guard and software permissions are constantly changing on BD - I've had to bump my SONY's several times to keep them current ).  Good Luck and enjoy !!",1313366400,,740,4.271428571428571
8279160,4,B001AR014W,"There is also single-disc Blu-ray edition (which I bought). So what's the difference? Per the Questar website:

""In addition to the Blu-ray disc, this combo pack also includes:

1.  DVD version of the program(s) that you can play in your DVD player, vehicle or computer.

2.  Digital copy of the program that you can download to your computer and/or transfer to your mobile devices.""",1291248000,3,383,4.921875
