1240023,4,B00000K2X9,"I don't really know if I would say this was a great movie, but it is a fascinating movie. Even more fascinating if you watch it with the audio commentary. Normally I'm not too keen on that audio commentary stuff, but  in this case I was intrigued because of a scene in which Barbara Steele the  witch/vampire sucks the life energy (or something like that) out of Barbara  Steele the love interest/mortal. In the course of this transformation their  (her) makeup changes so that one character appears to age while the other  appears to grow younger. (Now, this wasn't a Wolfman kind of thing, where  the camera dissolves between a series of makeup applications and you can  clearly see the dissolves between separate shots. I mean, Barbarba was  doing some serious writhing while those age lines were appearing and  disappearing on her face, and there were no signs of cuts or dissolves! And  this was in the days before computer morphing.) Anyway, I wondered, How the  hell did they do that? So I enabled the audio commentary in the menu and  sure enough the effect was explained (it was a pretty ingenious little  effect too, I might add). Anyway, I ended up watching the whole movie with  the commentary over it, because darned if all didn't turn out to pretty  fascinating. The commentary was done by film historian/expert/possible OCD  sufferer named Tim Lucas who seemed to know what he was talking about. Now,  normally, there's something about those ""The Making of"" media  specials/reports about Hollywood blockbusters--Titanic, for example--that  just put me to sleep. I mean, as far as I'm concerned, you spend $100  million and have several dozen nerds slaving over  computer keyboards for  months, your effects better look pretty spiffy. But when you get impressive  results when your using a child's wagon for your dolly shots and poached  egges for eyeballs, that's when I get interested. Anyway, thumb's up from  me on your job, Mr. Lucas. Apparently this same fellow provides audio  commentary on Kill, Baby, Kill too. Which I'm thinking I might buy as  well.
I should add that the transfer for Black Sunday is pretty nice, and  this is pretty important because the big thing this movie has going for it  (as opposed to, say, great acting, brilliant dialogue, etc.) is its  cinematography. And atmosphere. It's got that too.",946252800,,2339,4.892857142857143
1240024,3,B00000K2X9,"Black Sunday (aka ""Satan's Mask"") is a dark, creepy period piece.  A 1960s vintage Italian production, it features the beautiful Barbara Steele in the dual role of a centuries-old vengeful witch, and her modern descendant who becomes possessed by her ancestor..

1240031,5,B00000K2X9,"a masterpiece of the genre of gothic horror. Bava created a moody period piece via excellent set design and dynamic lighting contrast within the black and white film format. The musical score compliments the visuals in a pleasing way enhancing the old world charm of the films settings. I'm anti-religious so I view most crucifix clutching defense mechanisms as laughable but many of these old religious themed movies propagandized Zionism shamelessly despite the obviously futile gestures of warding off evil with a cross. This is not a serious movie regarding plot, but it's highly enjoyable to experience Bava's excellent direction and camera work. Barbara Steele is alluring in her dual role and the entire cast is good overall. I can imagine watching this time and time again when the mood is right. The HD transfer is good.

I don't know if there's an Italian language version out there, but I want it. That's my only complaint, and Italian language option would've made this even more perfect.",1492214400,,1000,5.024096385542169
1240032,5,B00000K2X9,"This great film, my new favorite vampire movie, deserves a loaded Arrow Blu Ray complete with hours of extras and feature length documentaries. The visuals are amazing, the plot is incredibly coherent for an Italian Horror Movie, the performances are good, the special effects are excellent (best use of poached eggs I've ever seen). It's a heavily stylized black and white horror movie with the visual qualities of an old silent picture. Mario Bava uses the entire frame all of the time, his environments are calculated for how they will appear on frame and there are dozens of ""pause the movie and paint a picture of that scene"" moments. Italian horror films are known for strong visuals and incoherent plots, but this isn't one of them. It is a 1960 film, but there is a bit more gore than was standard at the time and the story is good. This movie kicked off a BIG Bava kick for me and I'm currently consuming most of his films one at a time. Read a synopsis elsewhere, this is a great film for people who are fans of Tim Burton, fans of Hammer Era Horror, people who like to see how visuals are framed and presented. Barbara Steele really delivers, she's both beautiful and a bit weird looking, so her undead look is appropriately haunting. There aren't many special features. There is a very informative and entertaining commentary track by Tim Lucas, a Bava biographer who clearly loves the picture and his observations add quite a bit to the film. There is no italian language option, which I would have liked. After watching this picture I think Tim Burton cast Winona Ryder in Beetlejuice based on a resemblance to Barbara Steele and the two wear nearly identical outfits in the two movies.",1491264000,,1700,4.67

1240049,4,B00000K2X9,"Mario Bava's beautiful black and white film is a horror masterpiece.  It made Bava's name as a director and made a horror star out of the iconic actress Barbara Steele.

Based on Gogol's story ""The Vij,"" it is a tale of witchcraft and vampirism that transcends centuries.  Steele plays two characters, not uncommon for her - an adulterous woman burned as a witch and then a more innocent damsel in distress in the ""present.""  But the witch leveled a curse on those who killed her and two hundred years later, she is determined to seek revenge.

The black and white photography is lovely - a ghostly carriage in the woods surrounded by fog, the cobweb filled crypts, the dead strenuously coming back to life, and the entrance of characters from behind secret passages all give the illusion of a fairy tale.  The opening sequence, where the villagers nail a spiked mask on Steele, is pretty intense for the period (the film is also titled ""The Mask of the Demon"").

The dubbing of this version of the film is not particularly good - hence the four stars instead of five - but the film itself is carefully paced to build excitement and the cinematography remains gorgeous.  Like a number of films of the 1960's, ""Black Sunday"" helped move horror films away from the Universal classics approach and into what we consider modern horror.  While not discussed as much as Psycho or the early Hammer films, this remains a classic and a must see for fans of the genre.  While Bava and Steele did many other movies after this, they never topped their work on ""Black Sunday.""",1462752000,8,1563,4.650909090909091

1240053,5,B00000K2X9,"EVIL is afoot in Moldavia (circa 1630).  A self avowed witch (Barbara Steele as Asa Vajda) and her lover (Arturo Dominici as Javuto) are found guilty of sorcery.  They don't deny the charges, but were a bit putout by the torture inflicted after the fact.  The allegations were made by Asas pompous and puritanical brother.  (Sibling rivalry at its worse!)  Just before Asa is fitted with a snazzy mask, she curses her brother and his descendants (how malicious, holding a grudge against ones kin..........yet to be born).  And with a very BIG hammer, the nail encrusted mask is firmly set in place.  Two centuries later, Asas spite is about to be put to good use, as a pair of traveling nitwits stumble upon her crypt and clumsily spoil the stone cross thats stationed upon it.  As luck would have it, one of Asas relatives lives quite close and shes a dead ringer.  Poor Katia (also played by Barbara Steele) is oblivious to the danger thats closing in on her and her family.  Vengeance much delayed is still a potent force.

This is a fabulous looking film, loaded with great black and white imagery.  Its moody and gloomy and not nearly as gory as claimed (by todays standards at least).

THE MASK OF SATAN aka BLACK SUNDAY

(also aka ""Le masque du dmon"" or ""Revenge of the Vampire"" or ""Mask of the Demon"" )
directed by Mario Bava
Italy 1960
Secluded castles, musty hallways, tree branches that reach like hands, mist-shrouded forests, stranded travelers, duplicitous lovers who conspire to murder, secret passageways that descend to deteriorating crypts--this is the stuff of Italian gothic horror, one of the most exciting and atmospheric sub-genres of film, and Mario Bava was one of its greatest practitioners.

Bava's career as a director got started only with the assistance of director Riccardo Freda. After Freda left the set of I Vampiri (American title: The Devil's Commandment) due to a disagreement with the producers, Bava completed the final days of filming. Until I Vampiri (1957) presented the opportunity for him to take the director's seat, Bava was content as a cinematographer and special effects artist. He may have lacked the ambition to become a director on his own, but Freda suspected Bava needed a little extra push. When Freda signed on to direct Caltiki: The Immortal Monster (1959), he insisted upon Bava as his cinematographer. Midway into the production, Freda left again, turning over the direction to Bava. The resulting movie looks much more like Bava's movie than Freda's.

1240078,5,B00000K2X9,"The AIP version of BLACK SUNDAY is one of my most vivid memories from watching horror movies on TV. I don't remember it playing in the theaters in my home town of Greenville, SC but I'm sure it did as we had a lesser tier movie house in the Center Theater that featured American International releases. It would have been of no consequence as I wasn't old enough to see it. AIP trumpeted the fact that ""impressionable young minds"" might be harmed by the film and ""no one under 14"" would be permitted to see it. That intro is still on the AIP print and thus on this Blu-Ray release.

I had never heard of the film until I saw it late one night on local TV (no cable or internet in the mid-1960s). I was absolutely riveted and terrified and the powerful Gothic imagery stayed with me for years. The same was true of my best friend from church and later high school. We loved horror movies but had never seen anything like this. It was far more graphic than the old Universal horrors and had an edge that the color Hammer movies just didn't have. I became a big Euro-Gothic fan thanks to this movie but abandoned Mario Bava after he turned to Giallo with BLOOD & BLACK LACE.

It took quite a while for BLACK SUNDAY to come to DVD and when it did it was the British version known as THE MASK OF SATAN (a much more accurate translation of the original Italian title LA MASCHERA DEL DEMONIO) yet it was still marketed under the American title. This version had the original title sequence (which misspells Barbara Steele's name as ""Steel"") and the original score by Roberto Nicolosi. It contains extraneous gore cut from the AIP version and has better dubbing. I have this version as part of a much bigger Anchor Bay set of Bava's movies which includes BLACK SABBATH in Italian.

Despite already having the movie, I have longed for the AIP version. I did have it on a so-so VHS version but now a digital version is finally here. There is a different credits sequence and a different score from Les Baxter which I find preferable. Some of the dubbing is remarkably inept but the visuals are so vivid that it doesn't bother me. While I'm sure the U.K. Arrow version is superior, this one is not bad at all especially on Blu-Ray and it's the one that first turned me on to the film and to the genre so it holds a special place in my heart. How you feel about it will be up to you. Next up, the AIP version of BLACK SABBATH with Boris Karloff not dubbed into Italian.",1435881600,3,2457,4.336956521739131

Right down to the incomplete AIP logo and the music that's out of synch at the beginning (likely as a result of the incomplete AIP logo). I love ""Black Sunday"" more than ""The Mask of Satan"" (the new score and dubbing kicks the hell out of those found in the international version), and I'm glad this is finally available stateside, but if you're looking to buy this thinking it may be different/better than what Arrow put out, pass on it.

1240095,2,B00000K2X9,"I'm not going to bother reviewing this essential film.

This is a bare bones disc of the CUT AIP version - the main attraction here being the Les Baxter score, which isn't better than Roberto Nicolosi's on the original version, but more a curiosity. Kino have released that original version on a separate disc, with a few basic extras (not even as many as were available on the US DVDs), and if you want both versions in Region A, you have to buy both discs.

IF you have a multi-region player there is a MUCH BETTER option in Arrow's blu ray, which has both cuts of the film, and is a fully stacked and pretty definitive edition. (It even contains the full length I Vampiri in standard def.) Almost all of Arrows releases of Bava's films have eclipsed their Kino counterparts in terms of transfer quality, extras, etc., and this, Black Sabbath, Baron Blood, The Girl Who Knew Too Much, and Rabid Dogs (a.k.a. Kidnapped) all contain the (sometimes significantly different) alternate versions in hi def where Kino doesn't. They are producing really outstanding releases that go the extra mile. A lot of Kino's arthouse releases are also surpassed by the UK editions, such as the Masters of Cinema series, and it's always seemed to me that they've been a bit perfunctory in their approach in general, despite having a great catalogue of titles. Now they've partnered with Lorber, a company that has always had a really respectable catalogue and a shameful track record for the quality of their releases going back to the VHS days.

Just get a multi-region player and you have access to so much more. A quality multi-region player costs NO MORE than a standard player, and if you order discs directly from the producers or from the regional Amazon sites you can get some really reasonable prices and pretty low shipping charges. I have so many great foreign discs now, including a number of films that haven't been released in the US at all, I don't know why everyone isn't doing this.

Bravo, Arrow! I have no worries regarding your forthcoming Blood and Black Lace blu ray.",1424304000,10,2072,4.7154696132596685

1240097,4,B00000K2X9,"Vampires, witches, gothic castles, crumbling crypts and the odd dead body. If this movie had werewolves, it would be the perfect Halloween movie. But even without lycanthropes, ""Black Sunday"" is a brilliant little chunk of gothic horror. Mario Bava's solo directorial debut is rich in atmosphere and beautifully filmed, and it has plenty of very-graphic-for-1960 violence that is genuinely disturbing. The only problem is that the English language dub is... AWFUL.

In the 1600s, the Inquisition condemned the evil witch Asa Vajda (Barbara Steele) and her brother/lover Javuto (Arturo Dominici). They were both executed with iron devil masks nailed into their faces, but not before Asa curses her brother (the grand Inquisitor) and vows to return. Two hundred years later, a carriage breaks down outside her crypt, and Dr. Thomas Kruvajan (Andrea Checchi) and Dr. Andre Gorobec (John Richardson) wander in. Wouldn't you know, Kruvajan accidentally cuts his finger and the drop of blood revives Asa's corpse.

And fortunately for her revenge scheme, her brother's descendants still live nearby. Before long, she has sicced the undead Javuto on the family of the fearful Prince Vajda (Ivo Garrani), particularly his daughter Katia (Steele again). Oh, and shes turned Kruvajan into her vampire slave. Gorobec must join forces with the local priest to stop the witch and her minions before she can use Katia's blood to fully resurrect herself.

""Black Sunday"" is absolutely soaked in gothic atmosphere -- black leafless trees, vast shadowy castles, ruined cobwebbed crypts with eyeless corpses, and a perpetually stormy night. Mario Bava takes full advantage of this, crafting beautifully eerie scenes with his use of light and shadow. The film is like a string of beautifully horrifying tableaus, like illustrations from a gothic novel. Just looking at it is an experience.

It's also pretty disturbing. Granted, the gore isn't much compared to the ""Saws"" and ""Hostels"" of current horror cinema, but they're still pretty disturbing (burnings, eye-stakings and iron masks hammered into faces). And there's a vampiric element in this story, but Bava doesn't overplay it with cheesy fangs or other cliches -- it feels more like Eastern European folklore than Hollywood, where vampirism was both subtler and more alien.

But there is one big problem: the dialogue tends to be cheesy and clunky, especially during big dramatic scenes (""You too can find the joy and happiness of hating!"" -- which was apparently a bowdlerized version of the original line).

This was actress Barbara Steele's breakthrough role, and she's quite good (if a bit hammy) in the dual role of the innocent Katia and the malevolent Asa; certainly she has plenty of stage presence. The other actors do good (if a bit hammy) jobs as well, particularly Dominici's silent blank-faced menace, Enrico Oliveiri, and Andrea Checchi as an inquisitive man of science.

""Black Sunday"" is the ideal Halloween movie for people who are tired of the same ol' Hollywood horror -- an eerie movie about witches, curses and vampires.",1421884800,7,3080,5.247967479674797

1240135,5,B00000K2X9,"One of the Italian horror classics, Black Sunday has been viewed by many. But never with this video and sound quality. Granted, there is only so much quality you can get from a film so old; still, it enhances the effect. The opening sequence of the movie is and always will be the most memorable (some countries censored this opening) part of the film. The rest is a lesson in creating ambiance and letting the set and background do a lot of the talking. Speaking of talking, I am not sure if Barbara Steele was overdubbed, but her squeals when she faints are a bit distracting. Her fainting style is a little over dramatic and campy (seen a lot is telenovelas), but it would probably be considered just right for Italian audiences of the time.

If you are a horror film buff, love the classics, like Barbara Steele, or are just looking for a horror film you have not seen before, Black Sunday is recommended for you.

1240149,4,B00000K2X9,"Black Sunday is another film that illustrates how unfair life can be, no matter what the time period. Numerous movies, books, and documentaries have been created surrounding the sad situation of the witch hunts. Not all methods of executing 'witches' were identical though. In this particular story it's the 17th century and dozens of innocents are being slaughtered for fear they're in league with the dread diabolical Satan. Princess Asa and her servant (kind of strangely named Igor), happen to BE in league with black magic, and are put to death as a result. I guess if you're going to do the time, it's better to have actually committed the crime. Anyway, here Asa and Igor are killed with 'the mask of Satan.' It's a  ghoulish appearing contraption that has spikes and is placed on their faces and 'nailed' on. They are then tied up and burned. Before this horrid death, however, Asa is sure to place a curse on the descendants of the Vajda family.
Hundreds of years later, two doctors find Asa's tomb and do the inevitable. You know, what everyone in any horror movie does when they find a tomb! Asa's body is resurrected through another clich way, and she sets her obsessive sights on the young daughter descendant, Katia Vadja, which seems like it would be a pretty name if I could pronounce it. Katia's father has been having nightmares about the return of Asa and what it could mean to the family if she got her witchy hands ahold of them.

Mario Bava is a highly respected director, even today; this was his debut and he pulled it off clean and smooth. It was a lower budget flick that helped him get his hands dirty. Not only was he the director, but he was also the writer, special effects designer, and cinematographer. The strong gothic tones he weaved fit the movie well - it wouldn't have worked any other way. The stunning eyes of Barbara Steele blend stylishly with what this movie achieved. It's pure gothic bliss. Fog is everywhere, rich and heavy, with beautiful set pieces and photography.

Another aspect the movie has going for it is that the kills and effects for this day and age were pretty nifty. More details are below in bloody bits and gore factor, but let's just say they were pretty daring and bold for this time period.

It's a movie every horror fan should see, simply because it's a classic, and Bava's most famous. This isn't saying it's a perfect film, though. There were lagging times in there where much more could have happened, or even if the scenes didn't contain much action, they still could have been more intriguing. Also, the order of events could have used some sprucing up. She comes back, she tries to possess, she's found, etc, etc. A little more....well, layers, could have been added. Even if the basic plot is kept, at least throw in a small red herring or distractions to make it more interesting for God's sake! If you dig a bit deeper than the surface you CAN see some sublime blending of the Universal age gothic style meeting the coming of age sexual exploration.

Either way, Black Sunday is in no way a bad film and you'll be better off seeing it. It's stylish and wonderfully directed. Not 'fun', but interesting and beautiful.",1379635200,,3192,4.642477876106195
1240150,5,B00000K2X9,"Halloween, Nightmare On Elm Street, The Exorcist, Night Of The Living Dead, Friday 13th, The Thing, Dracula, Frankenstein, The Mummy, The Fly, Werewolf, Alien, all the other scary movies I've seen--none of them disturbed me in the least.  But Black Sunday scared the bejeezus right out of me--in the minute or two before the opening credits!  I only listened to the rest of the movie, that first time.  (Granted, that was way back when I was a lad--but I'd seen plenty of scary movies, with nary a fright among them all.)  At that time Black Sunday seemed a gratuitous punch in the nose, unworthy of anyone's respect.  Still, there was something intriguing about the movie I'd listened to.  I was in no hurry to do it, but figured I'd someday have to actually watch Black Sunday and re-evaluate it.  That re-evaluation, years later, was surprising: the movie actually was good!  Quite good!  It was made in a couple of weeks, for a couple of bucks, a half century ago, and yet is a favorite horror movie, or major influence, for a number of famous folks.  There is reason for that.  Never mind that its effects and such  cannot be compared to recent horror films--as a movie, it is very good, indeed!",1374710400,2,1200,4.6350710900473935

1240154,4,B00000K2X9,"I doubt many people know but there were actually TWO English translations of this film which was originally in Italian. The first English translation was done by the Italians themselves prior to selling the film to AIP (American International Pictures). However, and quite understandably, AIP was not happy with the Italians' voice dubbings, so they hired a company (Titra Sound Corporation) to do it over. In brief, the two versions are like night and day, with the AIP version being vastly superior. The witch's voice in the AIP version is far better suited for Steele, as are those of the other actors and actresses. And the musical score by Les Baxter blows away that in the original Italian version. At the very end, I've linked to the AIP at DailyMotion, a video hosting site like YouTube. The video quality there is not very good, but at least you can see what I'm saying about the superior audio track, voice dubbing and musical score. And if you happen to have the Italian's English translation, I suggest you compare the two.

Check out this excerpt from Wikipedia's article on the film (Black Sunday - 1960)
Note that they state that AIP deleted parts of some scenes. However, when comparing both, I observed barely any changes to the video between the Italian's English-translation and the AIP English-translation. Again, both the Italians and AIP made English-translations of the original film which was in Italian. .........

From wiki:

""Samuel Z. Arkoff and James H. Nicholson, of American International Pictures, screened the Italian-language version of the film when they were visiting Rome in search of viable, inexpensive European made films to act as second features for their double-bills. They immediately recognized the film as a potential hit and bought the U.S. rights for $100,000...reportedly more than the movie's budget.

In order to make the film more accessible to American audiences, AIP trimmed over three minutes' worth of violence and ""objectionable"" content.[10] Sequences excised or shortened included the burning ""S"" branded into Asa's flesh, the blood spewing from the mask after it was hammered into her face, the moist eyeball impalement of Kruvajan, and the flesh peeling off Vajda's face as he burned to death in the fireplace. In the original version of the film, Asa and Javuto were brother and sister; in the AIP version, Javuto became Asa's servant. In addition, some dialogue was ""softened,"" including Asa's line, ""You, too, can find the joy and happiness of Hades!!"" AIP modified it to ""You, too, can find the joy and happiness of hating!""[6]

Roberto Nicolosi's musical score was replaced by an effective but more generic ""horror""-sounding one by Les Baxter,[11] and the dialogue was completely redubbed into English. As the entire cast, with the exception of Checchi and Dominici, had spoken their lines in English, this was a relatively easy task.

*** Galatea had provided AIP with their own English-language version, which had been completed by the Language Dubbers Association in Rome. However, Arkoff and Nicholson felt this version was stilted and ""technically unacceptable"", so a newly recorded English version was commissioned and produced by Titra Sound Corporation in New York. (Barbara Steele's own voice was not heard in any version).[6]

AIP tested several titles for the film, including Witchcraft, The House of Fright, The Curse, Vengeance and Demoniaque, before finally entitling their shortened version Black Sunday.[6] The film premiered in the United States on 15 February 1961.

Even in its truncated state, '""Black Sunday"" was considered to contain strong material for its time. In the U.S., the AIP publicity campaign indicated that the film was suitable only for audiences over 12 (although its doubtful that this was enforced). In England, with the title '""The Mask of Satan,"" the film was officially banned by government censors until 1968,[10] when a distributor submitted the full version under a new title, '""Revenge of the Vampire."" The British censor made cuts to most of the scenes of violence, and the film was not released uncut in Britain until 1992.

Despite being censored, the film still had moments of very graphic (for its time) scenes of horror and violence. With bloody scenes featuring a wooden stake being rammed into a vampire's eyeball (Bava's variation on the more traditional stake through the heart), a metal mask hammered into a beautiful woman's face, and other mayhem -- the film was ""far more graphic in its depiction of murder and death than audiences had previously seen.""[5]""

Here's some more info I just came across from another source...
However, although they do say the musical score in the AIP version is ""arguably preferable"" (it's actually way better), they don't seem to make any mention at all that the voice dubbing is better than the Italian's English translation, let alone vastly better, which it actually is. I can't imagine how anyone familiar with both English translations could not come to the same conclusions.

Anyway, here it is...

""BLACK SUNDAY (1960) (AIP Version) Blu-ray
Director: Mario Bava
Kino Lorber

Mario Bava's BLACK SUNDAY (aka ""La maschera del demonio"" or THE MASK OF SATAN) is a crown jewel in the world of gothic horror. Its cinematic depiction of dark poetry and stylish sadism made it one of the most influential of all European horror films, and it seemed to be the one all others aspired to (along with Terence Fisher's HORROR OF DRACULA, made shortly before this). British actress Barbara Steele imbues her portrayal of the vampire/witch with a demonic majesty never before brought to the screen. Indeed her skeletal, high-cheekbone facial features, a landscape of puncture wounds with wild, thick lips (promising the joys of eternal Hades) are forevermore a landmark symbol of 1960s Italian Horror, of which she would become the queen of. The American International Pictures (AIP) version of the maestro's landmark maiden voyage now sees its way to Blu-ray disc, courtesy of Kino Lorber.

In the 17th Century, Moldavia is a land of twisted barren trees surrounded by thick fog and ubiquitous gloom. Princess Asa (Barbara Steele, THE PIT AND THE PENDULUM) of the aristocratic Vajda family and her serf, Javuto (Arturo Dominici, CASTLE OF BLOOD), have been found guilty of witchcraft and acts of sorcery. Asa's own brother, the Grand Inquisitor, sentences both to death at the stake. As a bronze mask lined with sharp spikes is placed up to her face, Asa curses her brother and his descendants for the centuries to follow. Scores of robed priests carrying torches observe as one massive blow from a sledgehammer strikes the mask, impaling the witch to the stake. An attempt to set the two ablaze is thwarted by the fury of a sudden nocturnal storm, as the priests carry off the bodies of the two heathens for burial. Two centuries later, Dr. Kruvajan (Andrea Checchi, ERIK THE CONQUEROR) and his young associate, Dr. Gorubec (John Richardson, ONE MILLION YEARS B.C.) are on their way to a medical convention when their carriage breaks down in front of a ruined chapel. Inside they discover an ancient crypt with a stone tomb illuminated by moonlight. Kruvajan's inspection of the sarcophagus reveals the body of Asa the witch still wearing the devil's mask. A huge bat flies out from the darkness and attacks the doctor as he beats it with his cane, damaging the tomb and shattering a window recessed in its lid. He wounds his hand, allowing blood to flow onto the empty eye sockets of Asa's corpse. After the doctors exit the crypt, the blood starts reviving the cadaver.

At the castle of Prince Vajda (Ivo Garrani, HERCULES AND THE CAPTIVE WOMAN), the family patriarch sits in fear with his daughter Katia (Steele, as the mirror image of her ancestor, Asa) and son Prince Constantine (Enrico Olivieri, THE RIVER GIRL) since it's now the anniversary of the execution of Asa and Javuto and the one day in which Satan supposedly walks among the living. Back in the crypt, Asa summons her undead lover Javuto to rise from the grave, still covered with the devil's mask as he emerges. His rotting shroud falls aside as he pulls the flesh-clinging mask from his face and lumbers off into the night. The undead Javuto abducts Dr. Kruvajan, who is soon beckoned by the dormant Asa to embrace her, as he too becomes a vampire. With Javuto now on the side of darkness and the village in a panic over the recently discovered casualties, it's up to young Dr. Gorobec to be Katia's protector, and that's no easy task when she's sacrificial fodder to revive her identical vengeful witch of an ancestor.

Beautifully shot in black & white by Bava himself, BLACK SUNDAY is a compellingly chilling classic, and a lyrical nightmare to behold, especially when watching it late at night. Bava's first directorial effort complements his great talent for visuals, as his camera effortlessly glides through the fogbound soundstages and crumbling, cobwebbed-filled crypt sets. From its opening, sadistic execution scene (imitated in numerous genre films to follow), there's a string of memorable shots and aura of early cinema gore throughout, some of which had to be trimmed for the American version released by AIP (the film was reportedly banned in England until 1968 where it was first issued as REVENGE OF THE VAMPIRE). Defined by its superior atmosphere and the otherworldly art direction by Giorgio Giovannini, BLACK SUNDAY is no doubt the genesis of the Italian horror cycle and arguably the best of them all.

Kino has previously released the uncut European version with a different international English track (with a print source bearing THE MASK OF SATAN title) in a Blu-ray edition which includes a Tim Lucas commentary (last Fall, Kino leaked out copies of a double feature Blu-ray of the AIP versions of BLACK SUNDAY and BLACK SABBATH, which was quickly pulled from circulation and cancelled: Kino is promising a single Blu-ray release of the AIP version of SABBATH some time in 2015).

This U.S. version of BLACK SUNDAY is more or less meant as a companion piece to Kino's release of the Euro version, but note that this is the cut of the film seen by baby boomers when AIP released it theatrically 1961, with it soon becoming a late-night TV staple for many of us who grew up watching it on the boob tube well into the 1980s.

The AIP version presented here contains distinct English dubbing done at Titra Sound Corporation in New York (Steele's actual voice is not heard in any version of the film).

After the classic early 1960s AIP logo and fanfare, in typical AIP ballyhoo fashion, it starts with a scrolling ""warning"" prologue and does of course read ""Black Sunday"" as the onscreen title. This version is actually around three minutes shorter than the European cut, and a number of the gorier and more violent scenes are trimmed. Some of the bits excised or shortened included the ""S"" hot-pokered into Asa's back, the blood spewing from the demon mask after it is hammered onto her face, the eyeball impalement of the buried Kruvajan and the gruesome burning of Vajda's face after he falls into the fireplace. There are also some changes in the dialogue, and of course, Roberto Nicolosi's score is replaced with a grandiose one by AIP house composer Les Baxter, and it's arguably preferable to the original (Baxter would re-score a number of Bava films that AIP released, following this).

Mastered in 1080p HD from original 35mm elements, Kino's presentation of the AIP version of BLACK SUNDAY nicely replicates what played in American drive-ins and hardtop theaters back in 1961.

The film has been presented in its proper 1.66:1 aspect ratio and the black & white image has strong detail, well-balanced contrast levels, and very deep black levels. Some minor speckling can be found on the print source, while grain is well-managed throughout. At times, white levels appear a bit blown out and several darker scenes appear a bit too dark, but all in all, this a very attractive Blu-ray presentation of the film, and looks similar to what Arrow Films released in the UK.

The English language track is presented DTS-HD Master Audio 2.0 mono and sounds pretty terrific, with clear and easy-to-follow dialogue and Baxter's score also having good fidelity (no subtitle options are present). Extras here are limited to trailers for Mario Bava titles available on Blu-ray from Kino: BLACK SUNDAY (AIP's trailer), A BAY OF BLOOD (under the title ""Carnage""), BARON BLOOD (AIP's trailer), HATCHET FOR THE HONEYMOON, LISA AND THE DEVIL and THE WHIP AND THE BODY (French language trailer).

The biggest disappointment for me is not the image quality (which is okay but, comparatively speaking, no revelation) but the fact that this Blu-Ray gives you no options but to watch the lousy English dub. Why? It makes no sense. The film was released as an exploitation film in the US by American International Pictures; the dub is of this level. Compare this with the just-released Region 2 UK Blu-Ray which offers three audio versions (""Italian, European English and AIP English""!) as well as the option of watching the original Italian version, with music by Roberto Nicolosi, or the AIP re-edit, re-dub with music by Lex Baxter. It also includes, as a bonus, the earlier I VAMPIRI (which Bava partly directed, but without credit). Now, this is what one expects from a Blu-Ray! I've just ordered the UK release and will report on it again when I eventually receive it. Of course, it requires one to have a multi-region player so it would be a no-go for most readers here, but my point is simply that there is no reason why this classic little gem doesn't deserve better treatment by its US distributor. A missed opportunity. The same bare bones treatment seems to characterize the other recent Bava Blu-Rays. Sad.",1359936000,59,1312,4.784140969162996

1240161,4,B00000K2X9,"Vampires, witches, gothic castles, crumbling crypts and the odd dead body. If this movie had werewolves, it would be the perfect Halloween movie.

But even without lycanthropes, ""Black Sunday"" is a brilliant little chunk of gothic horror. Mario Bava's  solo directorial debut is rich in atmosphere and beautifully filmed, and it has plenty of very-graphic-for-1960 violence that is genuinely disturbing. The only problem is that the English language dub is... AWFUL.

In the 1600s, the Inquisition condemned the evil witch Asa Vajda (Barbara Steele) and her brother/lover Javuto (Arturo Dominici). They were both executed with iron devil masks nailed into their faces, but not before Asa curses her brother (the grand Inquisitor) and vows to return.

Two hundred years later, a carriage breaks down outside her crypt, and Dr. Thomas Kruvajan (Andrea Checchi) and Dr. Andre Gorobec (John Richardson) wander in. Wouldn't you know, Kruvajan accidentally cuts his finger and the drop of blood revives Asa's corpse. And fortunately for her revenge scheme, her brother's descendants still live nearby.

Before long, she has sicced the undead Javuto on the family of the fearful Prince Vajda (Ivo Garrani), particularly his daughter Katia (Steele again). Oh, and shes turned Kruvajan into her vampire slave. Gorobec must join forces with the local priest to stop the witch and her minions before she can use Katia's blood to fully resurrect herself.

""Black Sunday"" is absolutely soaked in gothic atmosphere -- black leafless trees, vast shadowy castles, ruined crypts with eyeless corpses, and a perpetually stormy night. Mario Bava takes full advantage of this, crafting beautifully eerie scenes with his use of light and shadow. The film is absolutely beautiful.

It's also pretty disturbing. Granted, the gore isn't much compared to the ""Saws"" and ""Hostels"" of cinema, but they're still pretty disturbing (burnings, eye-stakings and iron masks hammered into faces). And there's a vampiric element in this story, but Bava doesn't overplay it with cheesy fangs or other cliches -- it feels more like Eastern European folklore than Hollywood.

But there is one big problem: the dialogue tends to be cheesy and clunky, especially during big dramatic scenes (""You too can find the joy and happiness of hating!"").

This was actress Barbara Steele's breakthrough role, and she's quite good (if a bit hammy) in the dual role of the innocent Katia and the malevolent Asa. The other actors do good (if a bit hammy) jobs as well, particularly Dominici's silent blank-faced menace, Enrico Oliveiri, and Andrea Checchi as an inquisitive man of science.

""Black Sunday"" is the ideal Halloween movie for people who are tired of the same ol' Hollywood horror -- an eerie movie about witches, curses and vampires.",1351468800,,2793,5.2561797752808985

Unjustly overlooked in his day (due to heavily cut and rearranged versions of his movies distributed outside of Europe) people are now able to see his movies as they were originally intended and Bava has subsequently become one of the most beloved directors of gothic horror cinema.

If you're a fan of Hammer horror movies or gothic horror in general you NEED to check this one out. To pass this movie up is to miss out on the single best example of its kind. It's a gorgeous display of classic black & white horror imagery with ALL of the elements of the subgenre represented; dark castles, shadowy figures, gorgeous damsels, a steadily building mysterious menace, and an utterly horrifying finale that maintains its creepiness even after many repeated viewings.

1240165,3,B00000K2X9,"I am upset with this blu ray release of Mario Bava's first feature MASK OF SATAN (aka Black Sunday). First off, the picture IS more detailed than the Anchor Bay DVD released, but it is not a very clean print. Specks, dirt are in abundance. I don't mind the film grain. Glad they left that alone. But this great film deserves to be ""cleaned"" up (and I don't mean grain removed) to make its debut on blu ray. Something to ""Wow!"" Bava fans. This ain't that disc. No restoring this film to the brilliance it once was back when it was released to theaters. Too much ""junk"" that distracts from the beauty of this film. This print looks ""cruddier"" than the Anchor Bay version. Too bad Anchor Bay didn't use their print and upscaled it to 1080p because it would have looked better than what Kino offers.
The picture isn't the best, nor are the special features. The awesome commentary by the Bava scholar Tim Lucas (I love to hear this guy talk about film) carried over from the Anchor Bay DVD, a few trailers and that's about it. I am VERY disappointed that after all these years no one has the nerve to persuade Barbara Steele to do a commentary track. It would be great to hear the Queen of Italian horror talk about working with Mario Bava.
Big disappointment from this Mario Bava fan on this blu ray release. Mario Bava's BAY OF BLOOD from Arrow on blu ray is much better.
If you already have MASK OF SATAN on DVD, don't bother upgrading.
By the way, Kino uses the Italian print (English dialog) that shows the title MASK OF SATAN but below it in subtitles they put Black Sunday. Should we be reminded which version we are watching? This is not intended for the hardcore Bava fan. A wasted opportunity, indeed.",1348444800,11,1707,4.439490445859873
1240166,3,B00000K2X9,"I'll leave it to other reviewers to give you their opinions about the movie itself.  I'll just put it like this:  It's a magnificent and masterful classic that should be watched by anyone interested in the golden age of horror and more specifically, the origins of Italian horror.  Black Sunday was innovative and inspirational, paving the way for many thriller, suspense and horror tropes still in use today.  Kino's blu-ray treatment is almost passable.  The first thing I noticed:  no Italian dialog track with or without subtitles.  Unacceptable.  I almost couldn't believe it.  Instead, Kino gives us only an English dub with some glaring synchronization issues.  When the product description reads ""original Italian cut"", it's only referring to the picture, and has nothing to do with the audio.  Concerning the picture quality, this transfer looks like it was straight from the source.  Obviously, no restoration, not even cleaning was completed.  This film went from the can and straight to the scanner, nothing in between.  It's as pure a transfer as we're going to get, but beware that the complete lack of restorative efforts is evident throughout.  If you've been pampered by the awesome restoration efforts of Criterion Collection or Masters of Cinema, prepare yourself for disappointment here.  This Kino blu ray release is more like an old Ferrari barn find than a Ferrari manufacturer's corporate collection piece.  The image quality certainly has its high points as any film stored in a sensible archive will have, but they are exceptional.  The audio is good, perhaps as good as mono audio can get.  Distortion is evident in places, but it's otherwise highly satisfactory, considering the audio recording equipment at the time of recording.  Additional features are minimal.  There are a few trailers and a single commentary track; that's it.  Packaging is your standard blu-ray fare, with no special case and no insert.  I should have bought the cheaper DVD.

EDIT:  After listening to the commentary track on this BD by a Bava film scholar, it's evident that the film was originally shot with the actors speaking in English.  Contrary to my assumption, the actors did not originally use Italian to speak any of the dialog.  I think perhaps the use of Italian dialog in the original cut is a common misconception, the result of which is likely due to such a terrible English on English dub.  Even so, I'd still like to see a version with the original dialog track intact.  This dub is horrible, but perhaps that's the only way we can have it.  Maybe the original dialog track doesn't exist.",1348358400,11,2609,5.0

Is this going to be the European version, with a couple of extra minutes of film and music by Nicolosi, or will it be the American version, with it's minor cut and music by Les Baxter?

The European version seems to be the only one available in mainstream media.  While I don't mind having the European version for the sake of completeness, I truly wish that they would make the American version available.  The main reason is the film score.  Nicolosi's score works against the film.  This is after all a Horror film.  Only when you see this film with Baxter's score can you appreciate why it traumatized so many American youths when it was first released.

I will purchase this blue ray in any case, if just to upgrade the quality.  But ideally, Bava's Black Sunday ought to be released in a deluxe edition with both European and American versions.",1346112000,,968,4.543352601156069

But some dingbat at Amazon seems to think this is a good idea and lumps all reviews for a particular movie or music title under ALL OF ITS RELEASES!! I'm not sure why as it can only hurt sales.

1240174,4,B00000K2X9,"Mario Bava (1914-1980) is celebrated as Italy's master of ""giallo film""--a phrase that derrives from the Italian for yellow and indicates pulp fiction.  He began work as a cinematographer in the 1940s and during the 1950s gained considerable experience by filling in as an uncredited director.  In 1960 he received his first directorial screen credit with the movie THE MASK OF SATAN.  The movie was only break-even successful in Europe, but after being edited, dubbed, and renamed BLACK SUNDAY it was a huge success in the United States, and it is more or less that version of the film that we see on this DVD.

BLACK SUNDAY (said to be based on a short story by Gogol, but not to any extent any one would notice) concerns a witch and her lover who were executed two hundred years ago.  Accidentally awakened by a doctor with an unfortunate curiosity, the witch rises from the grave as a satanic vampire and sets out to destroy the surviving members of the family that condemned her--including a young woman to whom she bears an uncanny resemblence.  The film has lot going for it in terms of Bava's gift for lighting, picture, and atmospheric set ups, and perhaps most particularly Barbara Steele's performance, which is truly memorable.

Ideas about what is scary have changed a lot since 1960, but BLACK SUNDAY is genuinely creepy and capable of making you jump a bit from time to time.  Even so, there is something about the movie that leads me to wonder if Bava spent the 1950s watching movies by Ed Wood.  Granted, it's unlikely that Bava ever even heard of Ed Wood, but this is exactly the sort of movie Ed Wood could have made if he'd had a little more talent, a little more competence, and a lot more money.  Graves burst open.  Coffins explode.  Blood gushes.  It is the same set of notions but in this instance executed with considerably more style.

What really IS Ed Woodsian about the movie is the absolutely hideous dubbing job visited upon it.  The story is interesting on its own merits, but the translated script is absurd, the vocal performances are poor, and even worse the voices don't match up well with the faces.  There is one line in the film that is particularly memorable for being interminably long and delivered by the dubbing artist (if one can use that term) without so much as a single break for breath.  The result is often unintentionally hilarious, and I often found myself snickering.

BLACK SUNDAY has developed a cult following over the years, and certainly this movie makes me want to see a non-dubbed version--but it seems that such a version has never existed.  Barbara Steele did not speak much Italian at the time and she, along with many other English speakers in the cast, were dubbed into Italian which was later dubbed into English.  Still, one wonders how much more fascinating this intriguing film might be if we could revert to the original script with either subtitles or a really good dub.  As it is--beautiful, over-heated, elegant, and quite often funnier than the Marx Brothers after after a few drinks.  Recommended, but be prepared.

La Maschera del Demonio (The Mask of Satan) is the proper name of this Gothic Horror classic. (Rant) It's amazing how America is incapable of using foreign film titles & always manages to change the titles to something pointless. America didn't even get her name spelled right on the credits or the trailer (Rant over).

Mario Bava's first movie is a tremendous success in all phases of Gothic Horror. The writing, directing, cinematography & acting are a treat to watch. Barbara Steele, the Queen of the Virgin / harlot double role stars as Princess Asa Vajda / Katia Vajda. Katia is the virginal love interest of her co-star John Richardson playing Dr. Andre Gorobec but the even the secondary roles are well done.

Set in two time periods 250 years apart the evil Asa cohort of Igor Javutich, a sorcerer are killed for witchcraft but not before cursing the family members involved. What a delivery of the curse too. You'll never find a better one. Fast forward 200 years & you find Katia Vajda the picture of innocence & spitting image of Asa at home with her Father, a highly superstitious man close to death. Two Doctor's, professor Kruvajan & Dr. Gorobec are traveling thru the country & stumble on the Vajda family tomb. The rest of the movie deals with the resurrection of the two evil fiends. One by accident or fate?, one by design. Watch them begin to renew their lust for revenge & blood.

I notice I left out praise for the writers. Nickolai Gogol wrote the story the screen play was adapted from. Mario Bava contributed as a writer but the majority of the screen play was done by Ennio De Concini, Mario Seradrei & Marcelo Coscia. The quality of the short story is a historical fact. The quality of the screenplay you'll see for yourself.

Many, shocking for the time, special effects are shown here & they still appear eerie today. The American version is missing a number of minutes of this film so make sure you buy the one I'll give a link too later. Necromancy & necrophilia  are the subject matter here that was uncommon for the time. Familial betrayal & hatred of human blood ties rule the day, or will love, innocence & knowledge. This is a movie about a complete sellout to the powers of Satanism & evil. It's a rare & true treat that can easily be watched again & again over a lifetime. I rate it 5 Amazon Stars in every category applicable to movie making.

I cannot say enough about Barbara Steele's performance here, her alabaster skin for which she's famous was the perfect canvas for the portrayal of harlot or virgin & her face expresses those emotions perfectly. Catch her again in Castle of Blood & Shivers the real title, called They Came from Within in America. OK, that's more rant.

Do you like dark and gloomy gothic horror movies that were shot in glorious black and white?  If so, then Black Sunday (1960) is your movie.  This Italian horror movie by Mario Bava is actually known as The Mask Of Satan.  This hugely influential horror movie is the perfect movie to watch on Halloween night.  Dark, macabre, gothic, gloomy, and full of atmosphere, this movie seems to have a little bit of everything macabre, such as a castle, a witch, vampires, crypts, woods, etc.  It has influenced many horror movie makers over the last five decades, including Tim Burton's movie Sleepy Hollow (1999) and Francis Ford Coppola's movie Bram Stoker's Dracula (1992).

This movie's dark gothic atmosphere is enhanced by the exotic and wicked good looks of Barbara Steele, who plays dual roles as a witch named Asa Vajda and as Katia.  She truly is the #1 Scream Queen of all time, starring in many horror films.  Every horror movie fan should have at least one Barbara Steele movie in their arsenal.

If you want to watch a great black and white movie that's heavy on dark atmosphere and perfect for Halloween night, then this is the movie.",1294617600,3,1199,4.743961352657005
1240191,5,B00000K2X9,"I'm always interested in whether people like or dislike a movie, but only if they really have something to say.  Many of the reviewers here do have interesting things to say, but unfortunately there are also quite a few who do not.

It's clear that some reviewers have no appreciation or understanding of the history of film.  You can't watch Mario Bava's 1960 Black Sunday as if it were a recent Hollywood horror release.  If you do, you're probably not going to like it - duh!  Please save the Facebook and Twitter chatter for those forums or for reviews of the latest Hollywood offal.

Some films in history were monumental in determining the scope and development of the films that came after it.  That is a fact that escapes one reviewer here who pans Black Sunday because Dario Argento's Suspiria is just so much more colorfully cinemagraphic.  First of all, Bava made this film in 1960.  Dario Argento didn't start making movies until a decade or so later, and he had Mario Bava to follow - and copy - in important ways.  Not the use of color from the black and white Black Sunday, but from Bava's Blood and Black Lace (1963) - a symphony of beauty, color and horror.  Don't get me wrong - I'm a big fan of Argento - but his use of color in Suspiria and Inferno is so clearly something he lifted from the much earlier Blood and Black Lace.  Faulting Bava because he wasn't Argento is like slamming Newton because he wasn't Albert Einstein.  Ridiculous!

Mario Bava made Black Sunday for about $60,000, a sum that was incredibly cheap for a movie even in 1960.  He filmed it entirely on a sound stage that was so small the horse-drawn carriage couldn't take more than five or six steps without having to turn around.  His budget didn't permit him to rent a dolly or a crane.  No one before had created such lushly gothic horror sets - just check out the first scene of the underground crypt.  Bava also introduced graphic depiction into horror movies - such as the now-famous hammering of the spiked mask onto Barbara Steele's face.  Even the current Anchor Bay release is from an edited print that cuts out the last frames of that scene.  We take graphic horror for granted now, but it started with Mario Bava in 1960.  Remember:  Argento's stylish murders and mutilations came more than a decade later - with much bigger budgets - and only after both Black Sunday and Blood and Black Lace blazed the trail.

Black Sunday oozes gothic horror atmosphere and does it very effectively.  I've seen lots of big budget horror movies that simply ooze throwaway GGI graphics. I don't think anyone has ever bested Mario Bava's ability to create a multi-dimensional, sensual atmosphere of horror.

Bava's success with Black Sunday didn't only have an impact on Dario Argento.  Horror films in the early 1960s were cheap trash drive-in fodder, with one sentence plot lines. The idea that you could make inexpensive but entertaining horror movies and make real money certainly wasn't lost on Roger Corman. Don't think for a moment that John Carpenter, George Romero, Tobe Hooper, Wes Craven, Quentin Tarantino, David Lynch and others too numerous to name didn't know who Mario Bava was.

This movie and its impact could fill a volume.  Period.",1284076800,7,3238,4.693262411347518

I recently read an article in which ""Black Sunday"" was described as the ""Citizen Kane"" of horror films. After watching it, I think a more appropriate comparison would be with your average Hammer Horror movie. The acting is wooden, the script downright laughable, and the dubbing is un-synced. Add to that the fact that, with Barbara Steele playing duel roles, the film becomes quite confusing at times.

Much of ""Black Sunday's"" reputation is based on its supposedly great cinematography, but I wasn't all that impressed. Yes, the cinematography was above average, but is was nowhere near as good as what you would find in most Dario Argento movies, in particular ""Suspiria"", one of the most beautifully shot horror movies ever. Besides, it doesn't matter how pretty the movie is, if the story is bad, then it's going to be difficult to sit through. Good cinematography can only keep you entertained for so long, and after the initial novelty has worn off, this is a pretty boring film that I had to struggle to stay awake through.",1234915200,2,1218,4.879227053140097

Two centuries later, 1830, Dr. Choma and his assitant, Andre Gorobec travel through Moldavia. They are travelling by coach and a coach wheel breaks. So as it may be expected they have to continue on foot in the direction of a howling voice. Eventually they discover the tomb of Asa.

ambushed. He will become vampire due Asa sucks blood from his neck. Choma kills the Prince and then Asa asks for Javuto tio bring her to Katia because her blood will become her immortal.

1240205,5,B00000K2X9,"The great Italian horror maestro, Mario Bava, certainly had his share of hits and misses (with much of his best work completed during the early part of his career) but his 1960 debut, ""Black Sunday"" may well be his crowning achievement.  An atmospheric masterpiece of stunning imagery and genuine creepiness, ""Black Sunday"" is an intelligent, well-crafted thriller centered around an aristocratic family and the unintended resurrection of a long-dead (and very evil) ancestor executed for practicing witchcraft.  The witch, along with her newly revived henchman, proceed to wreak havoc on the inhabitants of the castle, as they attempt to gain a foothold in this world.

Of course, the film proved to be a huge hit upon its release, and has since developed both a cult following and a genuine amount of respect from the film industry.  Unquestionably, the true beneficiary of the film's popularity is British actress, Barbara Steele, who proved that she was more than a scream-queen, parlaying her newfound fame into a successful career playing weirdly erotic, strangely complicated women in distress.  In ""Black Sunday"", she plays both the nobleman's aristocratic daughter, Katia, and the vengeful witch, Asa, and she excels in both roles.  As Katia, she exudes a fragile vulnerability that suggests a touch of madness, or maybe a physical frailty, like the consumption that destroyed many characters (both real and imagined) in previous centuries.  And as Asa, she's every inch the vampire queen, a bloodsucking witch and eternal goth girl who's feeling a little cranky after having a spiked mask hammered into her face and being tossed into a dusty, insect-ridden crypt for 200 years.  Except for the holes left by Asa's spikes, there's very little else to physically distinguish Katia from Asa.  The actress conveys the differences through her eyes and the intensity with which she delivers her lines.  It's a good performance, maybe even a great performance, and one that I don't think Steele, in spite of becoming a star, was ever given the opportunity to match.

The male castmembers also acquit themselves nicely, although none stands out quite like Steele.  John Richardson is the other Brit included in the film, portraying the doctor who unwittingly unleashes the horror; and Italian actors Ivo Garrani, Andrea Checchi, and Arturo Dominici fill out the other roles of nobleman, doctor's assistant/romantic interest, and demon-lover.

For its time, ""Black Sunday"" was considered quite daring, with its (now) subtle eroticism and the (once-shocking) violence that opens the film.  With hundreds of considerably more graphic and gruesome films released since then, it may not have the visceral jolt that it once did, but ""Black Sunday"" still thrills and entertains with a genuine eeriness and chilling authenticity that is rarely seen onscreen anymore.  It is a class act and a milestone for a fondly remembered director whose subsequent work (some of it, admittedly, good) never quite lived up to the bravura and promise of his stellar debut.",1222128000,,3051,5.248971193415638

1240220,5,B00000K2X9,"Whatever its flaws in dialog, dubbing and sound editing, this will always rank, in my book, as the greatest vampire film ever made; I might also add that there's not a fang in sight.

I probably should not have seen this movie at the impressionable age of seven, as it has haunted me all of my life.  I cannot be certain of it, but the version I most likely saw was the American version (which is good, since I've heard that this unedited, British/Italian version is much more explicit; it is the only edition, that I know of, that has been released on video or DVD). As an adult, I have found that BLACK SUNDAY has lost none of its mystery and allure.  My first copies were obtained from Sinister Cinema (video and later, DVD), and they were of inferior quality - and I was still happy to own them. What's great about this issue is that the print is gorgeous; at last I have this beautifully restored masterpiece in all of its black and white glory. Barbara Steele's enigmatic, dark beauty leaps off of the screen more vividly than ever.

Only one sequence, near the beginning, when a bat attacks the elder doctor, is poorly executed.  Thankfully, little of the bat is actually shown, the the scene ends with the doctor, hilariously, shooting the bat dead.  The rest of the movie is hard to fault, from a visual standpoint, and the story is nicely paced amid all of the suspenseful atmosphere.  Not only is Mario Bava's cinematography superb, but the sets and lighting are also worthy of the camera's close attention.  Some of Steele's costumes are a bit tacky, looking like they were borrowed from another movie about another time and place, but this small flaw is not enough to detract from the overall production values.

Much has been made of the sexual ambiguity and tension, but the excellent audio commentary included in this edition revealed something I had not paid much attention to, during the many times I have watched this hypnotic work. There is an ""eye, and injury-to-the-eye"" motif that runs throughout the movie. I don't know how I ever missed that.  Many of the facts and the history and biographical information about the actors given in the commentary make this DVD reissue an even better value.

The image that sticks with me most is near the beginning, when the two doctors first see Barbara Steele, standing in the ruined archway of a church, two large hounds straining at the leashes she holds.  As the camera moves in, her large, black eyes seem to gaze upon some unseen vista, a tangible sadness in them.  She is both beautiful and strange; it's a classic cinematic closeup.

1240222,5,B00000K2X9,"This is a brilliant film. Like Hitchcock - or any great director with a long career, Bava had his highs and lows but ""Mask of Satan"" is arguably (very arguably) his best film. I hold Bava in high regard because he usually served as the cinematographer in his films; and great, good, not s' good, nearly everything he made was visually stunning and had Bava's unique visual signature. He didn't just ""show off"" his technical prowess with a film camera just for the sake of doing it. His visual technique carried the story - but appropriately, often innovatively, and usually always ""in balance"" and ""in tune"" with the scene and the film. If he was a guitarist, he would be playing unique and challenging riffs, but ones that ""fit"" or better still, ""elevate"" the composition but not just be demonstrating skill or technique for the sake of it with a riff that doesn't really fit the tune.

Here Bava is working with black and white. Scene after scene looks like it could be hanging in a gallery of great black and white photography. It's truly visual poetry.

Those who do not like Bava's films don't ""get it"".  Let me help to frame these films for you. Films like Black Sunday were known, broadly, as ""chillers"".  They were dreamy dark mood pieces intended to give you an eerie feeling. They were never intended to be the visceral ""shockers"" with extreme levels of gore intended to ""startle"" you with off-frame ""booga booga"" shock cuts or to sicken you with depictions of extreme gore or saddism like what we encounter in contemporary horror films. I like many of these types of films to but consider them to be an entirely different category.  Like the greatest Gothic horror films, of which is this one (Nightmare Castle is another), they ""take you to a place"" - a dark, dreamy place ... convincingly, effectively, and take you there entirely through cinematic technique.  It takes a master of ""cinematic technique"" - mastery of appropriately painting scenes through lighting, composition, sound, shadows to ""get you there"". Bava is one such master - to many he was the best.

Bava takes you to a dream-like, hypnotic, surreal land of Gothic fantasy. They are not ""scary"" like, say, King's best works. Rather, they work more like Poe. You enjoy these films for the mood they elicit and their dark visual beauty. Those criticisms who point to deficiencies in the depth of the plot are to be discounted. This would like like criticizing Dutch Master, Willem Claeszoon Heda,'s painting ""Breakfast with a Lobster"" - or any classic still life painting, on the grounds that this classic still life depicts ""just some objects on a table"", and we've seen this sort of thing before. (It's a boring painting! Where are the nude people! - It's a boring movie! Where are the zombie cannibals!  Uggh.)  The art is not about the ""objects on the table"" per se - they're nearly inconsequential. It's all in the use of the medium in the depiction of these familiar objects through the mastery of technique in the medium on which they're depicted to elicit and sustain a ""feeling"" or a ""mood"" in the viewer, and have the artist's imagery filed timelessly in the memory of the viewer.  In Bava's case in Black Sunday - his cinematic ""still life"" - the objects on the table consists of witches, fire, fog, vampires, the walking dead, castles, crypts, and cobwebs. Yes, these objects are as familiar as ""the bowl of fruit"" is to a still life and equally, ultimately, just as inconsequential having just as little relevance to the success of the work be it a painted still life or cinematic art.

Black Sunday is a dreamy dark visual poem... It's a waking dream and cinematic art at the highest level.",1190246400,2,3680,4.725429017160686

Bava makes the most out of a low budget(as usual) and turns Black Sunday into a great film to look at.  Lots of gothic imagery, castles, graves, trees, fog...you know, good stuff.  It's like an Italian Hammer film in alot of ways.  A tad more blood than you're used to seeing in this kind of a film from this time period.  Not a gorefest by any means, but a bit icky at times.  Plotwise it concerns a witch who places a curse on the family of her enemies before she's branded and burned.  Two hundred years later she's awakened and is still a bit pissed about the branding and such and decides to make good on that curse with the help of her resurrected lover.  A heroic doctor comes to the aid of the cursed family and the battle begins.  The plot's not fantastic, but good, and Bava's visuals suit it to a T.

If more had been spent on the production and it had been filmed in color with some REAL actors and actresses, it could have been a truly GREAT film instead of the cult film it is.

1240237,5,B00000K2X9,"By all means seek out the version of this film as scored by Les Baxter for release stateside by American International Pictures.

Mr. Baxter, then heavily involved in scoring the Poe series for Roger Corman, understood perfectly the musical needs of a Gothic supernatural melodrama par excellence--such as this beautifully photographed film assuredly is.

Baxter not only provides all the aural excitement to accompany the film's many thrilling sequences but provides lovely alternative counterpoints for the films broodingly romantic and triste subtext.

His accompaniment to Princess Asa's unholy resurrection seethes with orchestral malevolence in perfect accord with Miss Steele's writhing frame. His wildly pitching and rolling tempo seems to actually hurdle the baroque carriage forward through the fog laden forest as the doctor is driven to the castle, and the introspective piano version of ""Katia's Theme"" hauntingly captures the melancholy of John Richardson's attraction to Katia after having just met her in the ruined chapel.

And to top all there is the sumptuous, full orchestral reprise of ""Katia's Theme"" as played under the closing credits.

This film is the ultimate ""blood and thunder"" epic which owes as much to Gottfried Burger's ""Lenore"", Ludwig Tieck's ""Bride of the Grave,"" and the Brothers Grimm as it does to Gogol.

And it is to his everlasting credit that Mr. Baxter understood this genre well. As such his music not only serves Mr. Bava's vision but frequently augments it.

If you are interested in further films from Mario Bava, I'd suggest the horror anthology BLACK SABBATH, which contains some of Bava's best work, and the ultra-rare obscurity FOUR TIMES THAT NIGHT, which features a playful Bava doing an offbeat erotic movie that seems inspired by Kurosawa's RASHOMON.

Most of them were quite forgettable and, if seen today, would be funnier than scary.  Few were scary at all and didn't seem to provide more than an excuse to stay up late.  The scariest one that I recalled seeing was ""Black Sunday"".  It had a believable plot; evil beings are put to their proper death only to emerge generations later to terrorize.  Their reincarnation occurs when travelers stumble across the crypt of the witch.  Each step of the movie seemed to feed on the previous one in a frightening series of escalading terror.  Or at least that was what it felt like to watch it when I was a 10 year old.

I was so fascinated with the movie that I searched for years to find just WHAT book by Nickolai Gogol that the movie was based on.  I read ""Dead Souls"" just on the chance that it might have been the one.  It wasn't but I was better for the effort.

The opening sequence with the spiked mask is great and the overall pace of the film is about right.

This is certainly a minor stylistic masterpiece.  It creates atmosphere that is thick, foreboding, and claustrophobic.  The story, however, is not worthy of such a lush, lavish treatment.  It just doesn't possess any emotional depth. The whole film is Barbara Steele's eyes.  They possess power that the film as a whole simply does not.  The fog the film is enveloped in is not pervasive enough to mask the bitter emptiness of the tale being conveyed. It is difficult to criticize the film on its cinematic qualities.  Nevertheless, the story does not mesmerize, tantalize or excite beyond those moments when Asa is moaning in her blood ecstasy.  Indeed, my grandest (futile) wish was for Asa to slaughter them all and then to hit the road looking for more victims to prey upon.
Barbara Steele weeps, shrieks, sighs, faints, screams, moans, gasps, and is undeniably fascinating to watch. She is far more interesting as Asa.  As Katia, she is a cipher.  She's drained of life and hysterical to boot. Asa has activated her will (if the undead can even be said to possess a will--the will of Satan?).  Katia is receptive, helpless and boring. She's just a lonely princess longing for her prince (yawn).  It isn't Ms. Steele's fault--the character is simply dismal. She's the ""good"" girl--she doesn't have to do anything, except mope about in a perfectly awful hairdo. The rest of the cast are perfectly plastic--save for Arturo Dominici as Javutich. He's a fine match for Ms. Steele and wondefully terrible.  He has presence that the others lack.
Still, the film is simply gorgeous.  The story might not be my glass of Absinthe, but the film is still visually stunning.  It lacks emotion and depth--but it makes up for it somewhat in the sheer power of its images. Obvious films that clearly map out the binary opposites at play are just not that intriguing.

Barbara Steele, who went on with Hazel Court, to be the true scream queens of the sixties, is perfect in the dual role of the witch and her descendant; Bava knew that Steele's beauty is not of the usual kind and he used his lens to soften some of her harshness, but yet to ignite those gorgeous eyes.

Black Sunday is the movie Ed Wood always wanted to make. A four-cheese pizza with extra provolone is still not nearly as cheesy as this ""horror"" film, from which the only horror can be gleaned at the unintentional humor to be found throughout. But still, for the fan of Italian horror cinema, Black Sunday (as many of Bava's films) is a must-see, simply because Bava was the man who inspired giallo, and the tangents off giallo which gave rise to the films of the great triumvirate of Italian horror directors (Argento, Fulci, and Lenzi).
If you can piece together a plot summary for this movie, you're a better man than I. But I'll give it a shot: in the 1700s, a witch (Barbara Steele, recently of the ill-fated attempt to remake the ark Shadows TV series) is executed by the Inquisition (weren't they gone by then?) in a startlingly brutal manner: they hammer a spiked mask over her face. Two hundred years later, a professor of history (Andrea Checchi) and his eager assistant Dr. Gorobec (John Richardson) stumble upon her tomb and remove the mask, freeing her spirit. Now, it just so happens that her many-times-great granddaughter Katja (also played by Steele) is still living in the witch's house with her family, and the two of them happen to look remarkably alike... you can see where this is going, no?
Fans of the Italian horror masters will find the geneses of such things as Fulci's obsession with ""eye shots,"" Argento's sweeping cinematographic spectacles of murder, and Lenzi's brutal execution techniques. And some of the scenes do inspire the viewer to disgust, at least (when Checchi pulls the mask off the witch's face being a perfect example), but as a horror film, it falls pretty flat. The later Italian directors refined the style into something better. **",1072051200,4,1812,4.829581993569132
1240250,5,B00000K2X9,"Italian director Mario Bava exploded onto the horror scene with the wonderful black and white film ""Black Sunday,"" also known as ""The Mask of Satan"" (a title I prefer because it does such a better job describing the movie). This picture borrows heavily from a Nikolai Gogol short story called ""The Vij,"" and while I am not familiar with the story, the movie succeeds fantastically at conveying a bleak atmosphere of horror. ""The Mask of Satan"" was Bava's official directorial debut, giving viewers a chance to see the genius that was to come from this excellent filmmaker. Bava didn't merely direct films, however. He also worked on all aspects of movie making during his long career. The director even helped his son cut his teeth in the business immediately before his death in 1980. Fans will miss Bava terribly after viewing just a few of his films, as he was one of those rare Italian horror directors who could truly deliver the goods.
""Black Sunday,"" set in Romania, opens at an unspecified date in the seventeenth century. Some of the local nobles decide to get together and roast a couple of Satan's followers, but this barbecue bears a special meaning for the House of Vajda because one of its own is on the spit. The beautiful Princess Asa Vajda fell under the evil spell of the dark one, along with her unseemly lover Javutich, and both now face a painful execution. In order to insure that these two sullied creatures wear the mark of their crimes, Asa's own brother orders a metal mask of Satan nailed to their faces. Unfortunately for the Vajda family, Asa casts a curse on the family immediately before her execution, promising to come back from the dead and plague her relatives throughout the centuries. After carrying out this sordid task, the people present attempt to burn the corpses, but a rainstorm conveniently whips up and prevents the destruction of the bodies of these two satanic worshippers. In order to rid themselves of the bodies, the House of Vajda orders Asa interred in the family crypt with a few conditions: a glass pane and a cross must be placed on the sarcophagus in order to keep Asa firmly in her coffin. Javutich's corpse doesn't fare as well; his body ends up in a grave in the cemetery. All's well that end's well after this incident, as Asa and Javutich waste away the centuries in their tombs.
Flash forward two hundred years. Two doctors traveling to a medical conference stumble upon the decaying Vajda crypt. In a fit of scientific defiance to peasant tradition, one of the doctors named Kruvajan bumbles around Asa's coffin and causes some damage to it. From this point on, Bava takes his viewers on a roller coaster ride of creepy imagery, walking corpses, vampiric transformations, and oppressive atmosphere rarely seen in even the best of horror films. As the horror of ""The Mask of Satan"" unfolds, we meet the various characters who will play witness to the resuscitated curse on the House of Vajda: Doctor Gorobec, the young, heroic companion of Kruvajan destined to save the day; Katia Vajda, the present princess of Vajda; and her fearful father and brother. Katia's father knows about the curse of Asa, and he spends a significant portion of his time worrying about it. Moreover, several people remark on the amazing resemblance between Asa and Katia Vajda as seen in an old portrait of the Satan worshipping princess. Does this similarity have anything to do with the Asa's seemingly renewed deathbed curse? Probably, and the fun comes from watching it unfold through Bava's masterful use of cinematography, sets, atmosphere, sound effects, and gruesome special effects.
That Universal horror films influenced ""The Mask of Satan"" is so obvious it really doesn't need mentioning in the editorial review on this site. Throughout the movie, I continually recognized these similarities. Perhaps the surprising revelation here is that Bava's film is markedly better than many of the influences he supposedly borrowed from. Check out the coach moving through the forest in complete silence, or the trip Javutich and the doctor take through the castle. These are superb effects accomplished without the benefit of CGI or fancy prosthetics. Additionally, every movement of each character seems choreographed for maximum creepy effect. I kept wondering how Bava managed to get his actors to move so SLOWLY while making it look so natural. Special mention goes to the eerily effective Barbara Steele, the actress who plays both Asa and Katia. I wouldn't go as far as a few horror fans and say that this woman is drop dead gorgeous, but she is pretty and the make-up effects used on her face give her a ultra creepy appearance when she is playing Asa. I could go on and on about the things I liked in this movie. Everything works masterfully, giving ""The Mask of Satan"" a classic feel right from the start.
The DVD version of the film I watched carries a ""Special Edition"" label, meaning that you get a Mario Bava biography and filmography, a trailer, a photo and poster gallery, and a commentary by Bava historian Tim Lucas. The package claims this is the uncut version of the film, always a good thing when you decide to watch a horror movie. Mario Bava went on to make a slew of films in a wide range of genres, but so far ""The Mask of Satan"" has been my most satisfying experience with this director. With Halloween right around the corner, this film would nicely fit the bill for a home horror movie marathon.",1067126400,90,5464,4.820021299254526
1240251,5,B00000K2X9,"At least, one scene of italian director Mario Bava's BLACK SUNDAY will haunt your memory for a long time : Javutich, played by a sepulchral Arturo Dominici, kidnaps a doctor and drives him to the castle's chapel in a diligence. The hellish trip is partly filmed in slow-motion without any sound. Astounding ! and a great homage to the german director F.-W. Murnau who shot the same scene in 1922 for his NOSFERATU but in a slightly different manner.
In 1961, the British Hammer Films reigned over the horror movies genre and the audience was accustomed to the Gothic made in England. So let's appreciate Bava's courage ; with a screenplay vaguely inspired by a story of Nicola Gogol, he was aiming at the same goal than Terence Fisher & Co. : frighten the audience !
In my opinion, Mario Bava is clearly the winner of this cinematographical battle. BLACK SUNDAY is the masterpiece of this director and deserves to stay in any curious movie lover's secret library.
An excellent copy and edifying bonus features will complete your pleasure.

Barbara Steele is probably the most beautifull actress of this genre. She's really The Goddess of Darkness. The quality of the DVD is very good, however there's only the English version and no Italian. The extras are not extraordinary.

1240253,4,B00000K2X9,"This movie represented an international breakthrough for famed Italian director and cinematographer Mario Bava. Before this movie came out he was well known in Italy and in professional circles, but not in the rest of Europe or America. It also marked the international breakthrough for British actress Barbara Steele. Black Sunday (aka La Maschera del demonio). And this movie has everything: A mean and cruel witch; vampires; zombies; gothic setting; beautiful star....
Black Sunday begins with Princess Asa Vajda (Barbara Steele) and her brother Prince Vajda (Ivo Garrani), being accused of witchcraft and then having a mask with spikes in it nailed to their face. The witchcraft accusations were true and of course centuries later they come back with a vengeance. A distant descendant, Katia Vajda (also played by Barbara Steele), becomes possessed by the witch Asa who is working on taking over her body permanently. Her brother is also brought back to life from the grave and he wanders around murdering those who would stand in the way of Asa's triumphant return. As usual, I don't like to spoil too much of the movie so I will leave it at this.
The brief scene where the mask is pounded onto Asa's face has no gore, but is gruesome nonetheless. The scene was cut from most theatrical versions of the film and has recently been reintegrated for the wonderful dvd release from Image Entertainment.
Mario knew he wanted Barbara Steele for the lead role in his directorial debut and he flew her from England to Italy for the part. This film ended up making her a star in Italy and the rest of the world and she made several more movies in Italy including Fellini's 8 1/2. Lots has been written about the film and it has acquired quite a cult status among horror and film aficionados.
The Image Entertainment release includes a full commentary by horror film historian Tim Lucas, theatrical trailers, liner notes and a photo gallery. The print is a gorgeous 1.66:1 transfer and the sound is in Dolby Digital 2.0 mono.
Many consider this one of the finest horror films of all time and some consider it one of the finest films of any genre of all time. For myself, I am very glad I own the dvd. After my second viewing of the movie recently I like it even more and I am certain I will watch this movie many times in the coming years. It retails for $ and is worth every penny. And if you can find it cheaper, all the better.",1034812800,3,2425,4.655011655011655

The witch is accidentally revived and summons her lover--also destroyed with her--from the grave to wreak havoc and revenge on the surviving family. The ultimate goal is to possess her living ancestor, the innocent Katia (Steele).

This is the perfect movie to watch on Halloween or on a rainy day or if you really want to get scared watch it all alone at night!

1240266,4,B00000K2X9,"""In the 17th century, Satan was abroad on the Earth and great was the wrath against those monstrous beasts thirsty for human blood that traditions have given the name of vampires.""
Such is the opening narration of the Masks of Satan, or Black Sunday. Princess Asa is burned by the inquisition of the High Court of Moldavia, who have also executed her partner-in-crime, Igor Javutic. She curses the House of Vajda, and her face affixed with the mask of satan, a facial iron maiden. There is an effective closeup of her frightened face before the masked executioner slams a heavy wooden sledge onto the satanic mask! Ouch, that's really gotta hurt! She would've been burned at the stake and that would be the end of it, had it not been for a thunderstorm. Instead, she is interred in her crypt and Javutic buried in unconsecrated ground.
Two centuries pass, say sometime in the 1840's. I say that due to the coachman's remark of having fought Napoleon's army, and estimating his age. Asa is accidentally awakened by Dr. Kruvayan, the older of two Russian doctors en route to a medical conference. Soon after, a slew of deaths involving anyone connected with the House of Vajda occur, and Princess Katya, who is a dead ringer for Asa, seems to be the prime target. She is helped by Andrei Gorobek, Kruvayan's younger colleague, who has taken a shine to her, and vows to get to the bottom of things (""We're in the presence of some unnatural mystery."")
Barbara Steele is brilliant here as the gentle but frightened Katya, and as the strong and evil Asa, scoring better in the latter role, with lines such as ""Don't you feel joy in the beauty of hating?"" and ""Come kiss me, my lips will transform you."" The scars on her face from the mask are explicit for 1960.
As for Igor Javutic, the painting of him resembles a painting of Vlad the Impaler I've seen in a book on Dracula, and Arturo Dominici is perfect realized as a live incarnation of said painting.
Horror is not just madmen slashing away at nubile young women, but the tense atmosphere created by the dark forces at work. The resurrection of Javutic is just one example. And the scene where the Prince of Vajda notices the change in the painting and sees the mask appear in his hot toddy is accompanied by dramatic music, most of which is chilling. However, in scenes between Andrei and Katya, some romantic Rachmaninoff-sounding piano comes on cue.
Black Sunday really set the stage for effective horror films. It's full of scary effects: eerie wind blowing, a thunderstorm with lightning, invisible forces at work, secret passages, vampires with claws, and realistic corpses. And its being shot in black-and-white gives a boost to the cinematography and lighting.",1026950400,3,2717,4.758474576271187
1240267,5,B00000K2X9,"The incredibly photogenic original Goth queen, Barbara Steele, couldn't have asked for a better film debut than this atmospheric black-and-white classic by famed director Mario Bava.  She gets to play both the innocent and beautiful ingenue Katya, and Katya's evil twin ancestor, the diabolical witch, Asa.
Steele's performance is half the reason to watch this conventional black magic/ghost/vampire tale, the other half being Bava's cinematography and skillful direction.  This is an especially violent film, opening on the execution of Asa and her evil manservant, Javuto, by the nailing of spiked devil masks to their faces (the original title of the film was Mask of Satan).  The visuals in this, and all other, scenes in the film are archetypally perfect.  The actual framing and composition of each shot is beautifully done, throughout.  The scenery is lush, the makeups unsettling  -  especially the resurrected Asa, with the holes in her face from the mask  -  and many of the effects are equally disturbing, especially one in which Asa's naked ribcage is exposed.
European horror cinema of the 1960s was the best the genre ever produced, and this was one of its premiere features.  Highly recommended not only for horror fans, but for serious film students as well.",1020816000,3,1274,5.170731707317073
1240268,5,B00000K2X9,"""Black Sunday"" is widely regarded as one of Mario Bava's strongest films in a career filled with over a dozen bona fide horror/giallo/goth classics.  On one level, ""Black Sunday"" is something of a red herring for the director, a black and white film which reminds one more--on first glance--of the classic '30s Universal horror stories than of later color-laden works like ""Black Sabbath"" or ""Planet of The Vampires.""  However, ""Black Sunday"" is where Bava began as a solo director, and he hits a home run the first time out with this eerie tale.
Barbara Steele is perfectly cast as both the evil vampiress risen from the dead as well as her modern descendant, a more demure but surprisingly strong heiress.  This performance cemented her reputation as one of the earliest ""scream queens,"" and in this film there are plenty of opportunities to display her talents as one of the finest reactors (as opposed to actors) in cinema history.  Her expressive eyes and eyebrows--and voice-- always let the viewer know exactly what her character is feeling.
Modern viewers may be wary that the film is in black and white, but this remains one of the most beautifully shot films I've ever seen.  When done the right way, black and white photography can be far more evocative than color photography--not to slight such Bava devotees as Argento, who obviously have copied his later penchant for color.  The camerawork, especially a 360 turn displaying the entire dungeon, is always impressive; rumor has it that Bava often used a child's wagon as a dolly to save money.
The DVD of ""Black Sunday"" is exemplary not only due to the beauty of the transfer but also Tim Lucas' commentary.  This is one of the finest commentaries done by an ""outsider"" (i.e. someone who did not direct or star in the film) I have ever heard.  Lucas, a historian, is known by many as the author of fine liner notes for DVDs for Bava and Jess Franco (eg, ""Vampyros Lesbos""); here, he talks almost nonstop about every aspect of the film and its director.  Never dull, sometimes funny, this is a commentary which will teach you more about Mario Bava in 80 minutes than you could learn surfing the web all day.",1018915200,9,2170,4.75
1240269,5,B00000K2X9,"Although there is a glitch or two in the DVD format, this movie is perhaps the best horror picture ever filmed. Thick, gothic atmosphere sets the scene for wonderful camera work that can only be effective in black and white. Barbara Steele is beautiful,yet spooky, as not only the monster but the victum as well. The garbage to come from hollywood in the last 20 years cannot compare to this horrific masterpiece.",1013212800,2,413,4.75
1240270,5,B00000K2X9,"This dvd, part of Image's great (and occasionally revelatory) Mario Bava collection, represents the best (indeed, only) way of viewing this film as it was originally intended.  The film is a must for fans of gothic horror; the contemporary viewer will notice it's influence on both Italian cinema and american (particularly Tim Burton, who's recent Sleepy Hollow in particular contains a number of explicit 'homages'..).  The black and white photography is extravagent without becoming distracting, the casting is perfect (sadly Steele and Bava would not work together again).  Although dated, Mask of Satan (Black Sunday's original title) is considerably less so then the more childish Universal Horrors of the 30s, due to it's more graphic (for it's day) violence and disturbing sexual undertones.
The transfer for this dvd is superb, and the print in great condition.  Picture quality is in fact considerably better then the previous disc of 'Baron Blood' (which is very good).  Anamorphic enhancement helps a lot, although sadly it isn't 'windowboxed' (this isn't a big deal but would have been nice).  Lack of Italian soundtrack with english subtitles is disappointing - but the cast appear to be speaking english for the most part anyway, and the dubbing really isn't THAT bad for this kind of film (*ahem* - 'Female Vampire' anyone?)
Tim Lucas' commentary track is very good also.  Actually I wish he'd do this on all the Bava collection dvds (perhaps there isn't much to say about his lesser works?).  It's of the informative variety; he is clearly reading a prepared script despite the enthusiasm he shows for the film - but it's well worth a listen at least once as it really gives an insight into Bava's genius.  He also points out the differences between this and the previous US version (if you were unlucky enough to have seen that).
Despite being slightly long in the tooth, I would recommend this film to all open minded film fans, particularly those interested in horror or foreign film.",1013212800,2,2004,5.030211480362538

From the opening squence where the witch receives the Mask of Satan, to every cobweb,every spooky shadow, to the mesmerising Steele in the dual role of the witch and her current day descendent, this is one beautiful piece of work.

The picture is very clean with only bits of dust going by once in a while.  It's hard to say what's better:  the eerie sets and interior scenes or the lighting of the actors' faces.  The DVD is simply amazing -- what a great purchase!  I subtracted one star for a pure mono soundtrack.  Yes, I realize that's all there was back then, but DVD's should be a totally superior visual and sound experience.
It's easy to see now why there are so many Barbara Steele fans.  She literally captures your heart and brings the screen to life.  I'm not sure of her dimensions; sometimes she appears quite petite, but she has strong forearms and nice, long hands and fingers/thumbs.  It's those kinds of sensual details that I like about the Bava films and crave in most modern movies.  And of course there are a few scenes to make you smack your lips -- like when the doctor unbuttons her blouse!
Superb black + white, widescreen presentation that is superior to those full-screen presentations, this is a delicious way to spend 87 minutes.  YOU WILL be hooked on Barbara Steele after seeing this movie.",1012089600,3,1297,4.567099567099567

In the early part of the 19th century two medical doctors, one young, and the other his older mentor, pass through a remote part of Romania on their way to a medical convention in Russia and become involved in the machinations of an extremely evil witch who was destroyed two hundred years before and is seeking to return from the dead by stealing the life of her lookalike descendent.  Many of the scenes have been copied in dozens of later movies but never as good as this original.  The action includes vampires, spooky castles with secret passageways, weird portraits that change, eery coaches, scary graveyards, and more!  This movie made Barbara Steele a star and the queen of horror throughout the sixties.

1240286,3,B00000K2X9,"Mario Bava's Black Sunday is an early example of the Italian horror genre which would later be defined by the likes of directors Dario Argento and Lucio Fulci and may best characterized by an abundance of gore, zombies, and misogynism.
While Black Sunday (originally titled &#8216;The Mask of Satan'), being released in 1960, does not employ the extreme graphic violence that would later manifest with the genre, it does have its share of the macabre and interesting visuals.
The opening witch-burning sequence is by far the film's most memorable moment, and it's most gruesome -- the sadism towards women is already beginning.  We see the bare back of the witch branded, then in amazement, I watched as the &#8216;Mask of Satan,' which is lined on the inside with nails is placed over the witches face as her head rests against the stake and then pounded home with an enormous wooden mallet by a muscled, black-hooded executioner.  In a black-and-white film from 1960.  Having shouted out, &#8220;NO THEY DIDN'T!!!...&#8221; I had to rewind the shot a couple times.
Unfortunately, the remainder of the film plays more like a Scooby Doo episode with some of the most absolutely braindead detective work of all time on display, but from what I gather, the Italian horror films are more about atmosphere and images than good acting and well written plots.  Black Sunday is loaded with morbid atmosphere as a doctor discovers the dead witch's crypt and, after being attacked by a ridiculous looking fake bat, is compelled to pry the mask off to reveal her insect-covered face with gaping eye sockets. There are many underlying necrophilia currents and later in the film he kisses the dead-for-two-hundred-years-nail-hole-havin'-face witch. The constant billowing fog and crumbling crypt ruins definitely create an unsettling atmosphere if you allow yourself to look past the dated &#8216;thriller' soundtrack and bad dialogue. There is also an absolutely superb shot where a ghostly carriage is filmed in slow motion coming down the road.

1240287,4,B00000K2X9,"Let me start by saying Barbara Steele is just plain weird looking.  She is not unattractive.  She is just...disturbing.  Maybe that is why she fits so well into the role of an ancient witch condemned to death, a horrible iron mask nailed to her face.
Time passes and some travellers wander into her crypt despite their coach driver's warning.  And of course they manage to break the wards and symbols that keep her from returning to life.
Black Sunday features great set design and an oppressively dark mood that oozes evil and menace in every scene.  Apparently the film is available in two versions.  I think I got the bad one.  One version is heavily edited but features voicework by the original actors in english and better overall sound quality.  I bought the extended version which unfortunately has some pretty bad voice acting.
Buy Black Sunday if you like classic horror movies such as the old Universal monster films, but wish that they didn't pull their punches so much.  I would have given Black Sunday 5 stars, but the voice acting in my version is going to cost it a star.

Mario Bava stops at nothing to create the ultimate atmosphere of fear and  terror in this movie (which was no doubt copied over and over again by the  countless horror movies to follow). From Fog rolling in to stormy, broken  graveyards, you stare in amazement...at just how you can't help but feel  you're really there. For example, he takes you 360 degrees all around the  vampire crypt! Amazing, bingo, you're there! Mr. Bava also sets up scenes  with the feeling of ""impending doom"" (ie: the little girl who has  to walk thru the forest to milk the cow, who is deathly afraid to do  so...in her innocence every frog that crosses her path, scares her...and we  know the vampires are right in her midst. Will they get her??...)  Barbara Steele is also perfection playing good and evil personified. Take  one look into those dark sultry eyes, and at her heaving breasts (with just  the right amount of cleavage showing...) This breathless beauty became an  overnight sensation from this film, and continued to make more horror films  (mostly, I believe, for HAMMER productions).I was a big fan of hers...she  almost made a film in America too...with Elvis Presley (you can hear more  about that in the wonderful commentary provided with the DVD)  Also,  remember when this movie was made (1960), and realize that there were some  shocking moments for the time, and jthere still are  today After seeing  many  of today's horror flicks, I still cringe at the ""masking""  scene. It's nothing short of terrifying.  The movie is also in glorious  ""black and white""...an ingenious thought by Mr. Bava. Because of  it, the movie succeeds gloriously...shadow after shadow, dark and light  play beautifully within this film. Bava goes all out when it comes to  fright. He's a master, again of atmosphere: shadows of a bat,an exploding  crypt, regeneration thru blood,...and the recurring theme of  ""eyes""...  This movie is a true horror classic.  It is not to  be missed, especially this ""uncut"" version with a wonderful  commentary and publicity stills.  The movie is dubbed (though you see the  mouths moving and you know they're speaking English, some of the words are  not exact...as more of a script was added in the dubbing, but hey, that's  part of the fun with these horror classics). I gave this a 5 star rating.  Pick up a copy, you'll see why....then, don't even think about trading it  on one of those auction sites...this belongs in your collection, filed  under ""horror"". :)",968371200,2,2551,4.892018779342723
1240317,5,B00000K2X9,"In 1960 Mario Bava directed his first and best film,La maschera del demonio(The Mask of Satan)In North America it was released as Black Sunday. The story concerns a 17th century princess who is executed for  witchcraft & vampirism. Two centuries later she is accidently resurected  by doctors on the way to a medical convention. The witch(Barbera  Steele)kills one of the doctors & makes him a slave of Satan. She wants  the body & soul of her look-alike ancestor(Steele) & must destoy  Dr. Andre (John Richardson) to get it. This is a true horror  movie with a  gothic atmosphere that Bava's later color films lacked. Also this is the  widescreen European version which is superior to the US release. Errie music  along with scenes cut from the American version make it so. The only  downside is the bad dubbing and occasional ticks in the film (The US  version uses Steele & Richardson to dub their lines & have  digitally remastered the print)",962064000,5,946,4.807453416149069
1240318,4,B00000K2X9,"Actually, my rating for this DVD version of ""Black Sunday"" would be 5 stars for the video transfer, 5 stars for Bava's cinematography (seen here like never before), 2 stars for the audio transfer,  and 3 stars for  the overall quality of the film itself. Bava was not a great director, and  didn't like to be called a ""cinematographer,"" but this  film  really is a painting in motion: every scene is a paradigm of Gothicism --  the cinematic equivalent of Gustave Dore. Like other
reviewers, I was  floored by the print used for this disc: it looks, almost literally,  like  it was shot yesterday, and it's almost  impossible to believe the film is  almost  40 years old. If there are other films from this  era that look  this pristine, I haven't seen them. My only quarrel with the disc has to do  with the dubbing. In all honesty, I feel this film sports one of the worst  American dubbing jobs ever performed on a film, and the big  question  (which neither Tim Lucas nor anyone else seems to have raised)is this:  WHERE is the  original Italian-language version of ""Black  Sunday,"" and why wasn't an attempt made to give us the original  dialogue with OPTIONAL English subtitles? Mr. Lucas would have us believe  that this DVD was the original version, but obviously the entire cast is  speaking Italian (duhhh - why else would you have to dub in English?). So,  yes, I'm thrilled to have this beautiful print, but  hopefully in the  future we'll get the original Italian dialogue and not have to endure the  abominable dubbing...",958608000,36,1535,4.669172932330827
1240319,3,B00000K2X9,"Of greatest interest to me is the addition of a commentary by Video Watchdog's editor-publisher Tim Lucas.  Lucas knows his Bava and certainly knows this film - it 's one of the best commentaries I've heard, rife with  anecdotal detail and mise-en-scene perception.  I had already been aware  that Bava produced some remarkable and inventive shots (he was his own  cameraman), but without the sound his style completely comes to life.  Lucas makes sure you miss nothing.  The movie is an atmospheric black and  white, with Bava as a sort of horror Welles/Sam Fuller, and I don't make  those comparisons lightly.  I will not pretend that some of the leaden  dubbing and confused, plodding story line can make B tedious.  Stepping out  of these aspects with Lucas, one can see what makes this film so  remarkable.  Inventive dollies, cranes and lighting are everywhere: a  magnificent 360 degree pan in Steele's crypt; a dizzying cork screw down on  the vampirized Baron in bed; an almost Kurosawa/THRONE OF BLOOD-like image  of Steele's ghostly reflection appearing in a pond at night.  Lucas further  enlightens us on how certain chilling effects were achieved out of bargain  basement solutions.

1240320,5,B00000K2X9,"There is a story that director Mario Bava discovered that if he lit Barbara Steele's face a certain way, her face looked more like a skull. Black Sunday is one of the best photographed films, with its disturbing  images of Steele and the unforgettable show motion shots of a stagecoach.  Filmed in black and white, this film is an important link between the  gothic horror of Hammer in the late 50s and the more graphic films that  followed Psycho, including the work of Dario Argento, and Mario's son  Lamberto Bava. More importantly, I have seen the film several times since a  college friend introduced me to Black Sunday: on television, tape, and best  of all, on the big screen at the Pacific Film Archives. This is a film for  all serious collectors.",953942400,4,756,4.674242424242424
1240321,4,B00000K2X9,"There is no doubt that the Mario Bava classic is one of the very best, most visually beautiful horror films ever.  I really even hate to call it a ""horror film"" because of the negative connotations of that term.  This is really a dark visual poem performed in splendid black and white  visuals.
While it is great to have the uncut European print, especially  looking this good, the original English dub prepared in Italy is terrible,  with awful performances, cut rate sound effects, and worst of all, a drab,  lethargic score by Italian hack composer Roberto Nicolosi which would seem  more at home in an old Monogram chiller.
When AIP brought the film to the  U.S. they removed a few moments of gore, but did not, as has so often been  assumed, tamper in any significant way with Bava's directorial effects.  The main decision at AIP was to improve the dramatic effect by redubbing  the film with better English speaking actors (AIP did NOT tamper with the  script, which is obvious if both versions are compared), i.e., George  Voskovich as Dr. Kruvyjan, and a new score by Corman/Poe specialist Les  Baxter, which makes the film seem to almost race along.  It should be noted  that AIP retained the Italian sound effects track, only ocassionally  beefing it up where the original sounds too thin.
I have many friends who  agree with me on this one, in the best of worlds, the film would have the  slightly longer European cut with the American soundtrack matched to it.  Many Americans who grew up with the Les Baxter score and U.S. dubbing of  AIP's edition will be very disappointed with the drab Italian-prepared  English dub and dreadful Nicolosi score.  Overall, 5 stars for the visuals,  but only 2 for the European soundtrack.  Otherwise this would be five stars  across the board.",947894400,3,1792,4.755700325732899
1240322,5,B00000K2X9,"Black Sunday AKA The Mask Of Satan was one of the most loving visual tributes to the classic gothic horrors of the past.  I just got the new DVD of the film and it is absolutely amazing.  The black and white picture  quality is stellar, very reminiscent to the crystal sharpness of the Boris  Karloff Thriller TV show but shot by the cinematography master Mario Bava.  Imagine a  photographic art book, with all of the vibrant black and white  imagery you would expect from such a high publication.  But this one moves!  I wish the Universal Classic Horror DVDs could somehow look this good!  The  menu is a lot of fun, looking like old lobby cards with a Paul Frees voice  over from some old promo ad.  The commentary track, while containing some  stretches of silence, is very very informative.  Plus, an equally crystal  sharp trailer, posters, pics, and notes.
The film is a bit gruesome and  gory at moments, but you could not find better black and white Gothic  Horror eye candy anywhere!  Bravo to all involved on the movie and the DVD!  I believe that Image is coming out with a VHS tape as well.",947289600,5,1104,4.50761421319797

Barbara Steele serves up some centuries old witch realness as well as wealthy good girl realness. If you pay attention, this movie is great. If you're chit-chatting with friends at a party and not paying attention, youll be confused and this movie won't make sense.

Not only does it look great, it truly shows the beauty of Barbara for which she plays 2 roles here. The audio is good also.
Although I think KINO could have done better putting some subtitles in and perhaps Closed Captioning. Come on, it's the digital age, not everyone can understand or hear what is going on in the movie.
That is my only gripe about this new release from KINO LORBER.
