7795892,4,1557390746,"Anne Baxter is my favorite actress of all time and this movie truly showcases everything that was so fabulous about her! Made in 1971, Anne stars as Liz Addams Hatch a beautiful, wealthy society woman plagued with alcholism and general unhappiness despite her priveledged and advantaged life. After a failed attempt at ending her own life, she finds salvation thru the gospel. Words cannot even begin to describe Anne's powerful performance; she truly sparkles and gives the character such depth and sympathy. Also noteworthy is that Anne at age 47 looks absolutely stunning and just seeing her outfitted in 1970s couture outfits is worth the price alone!! This movie is a MUST have for any fan of the beautiful and elegant Anne!",1133913600,2,729,4.983606557377049
