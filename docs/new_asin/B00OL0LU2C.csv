8684065,1,B00OL0LU2C,"I just finished watching this and had to immediately write a review.  This is awful.  A boring, sleepy attempt to make a unique, poetic, dreamy and creepy documentary.  Creepy and boring at least, are what it turns out to be, regardless of intentions.  I appreciate creativity and attempts to be different.  If they work.  This doesn't.  I don't think the director has the talent to pull this off.  Granted, the subject is tough, requiring more skill than most subjects, but that doesn't excuse him from wasting an hour and twenty of my time.

Too subjective.  Too pretentious.  Too homoerotic with a touch of pedophilia thrown in.  Too weird.  All with no good result, which is the main complaint here.

8684067,4,B00OL0LU2C,"Guy Maddin wrote liner notes for a micro budget Canadian film 'Father's day'(a tone perfect modern mock-exploitation flick) by renegade filmmaking stable Astron-6. Guy Maddin was unfamiliar to me then, and after stepping inside of his fever dream 'My Winnipeg', he still is. But I now feel an affection for this man and his inspiring work.

'My Winnipeg' is a delirious escape to and through the time-fog of Guy Maddin's idea of home and his town, Winnipeg. The director unreliably(maybe?) regales us with stories over an amalgamation of reenacted memories, local lores and a personal history tour. The tone drifts into the murky waters of David Lynch, ambles about in Gonzo fragments of absurdity, and smiles with Canadian joviality through a consistent double-exposure Manitoban snow front.

Criterions Bluray release looks timeless. Beautifully composed in black and white, the stormy grey pallete organically blends with the mysterious material and hypnotizes the viewer. Images of winter, hockey, transformation, and destruction delight the eyes.

I suggest 'My Winnipeg' to anybody who appreciates seeing original ideas. Allow yourself to be captivated and explore something new.",1444003200,4,1185,5.535911602209945
8684068,4,B00OL0LU2C,"NOTHINGS TRUE in this mockumentary on Winnipeg, the midwest section of Canada. Except for the things that are.
Its impossible to tell whats real and what isn't in Guy Maddins My Winnipeg. The movie spools out like a surreal therapy session presented in black-and-white with the occasion bright flash of color. Like a dream.
But thats not unusual for the highly creative filmmaker, although, admittedly, hes an acquired taste. Hes produced numerous short features and is often compared to David Lynch and John Waters. Still, theres something more approachable about Maddins work  possibly because of its dreamlike quality. He says his inspiration comes from Federico Fellini, particularly I Vitelloni (1953). It reminded me of Fellinis Amarcord (1973), the Italian filmmakers amicably bizarre homage to his hometown and family. Maddins certainly engaging as seen in Criterions 2014 conversation between him and critic Robert Enright, who does his best to analyze My Winnipeg and get to the bottom of some of its mysteries. Theres more from Maddin as he introduces five fascinating short films. Theres nothing artistically pretentious about him; he seems as normal and likable as anyone youd care to meet.
Which only leaves us puzzling over the rambling narrative and visuals. Maddin presents a town of almost everlasting winter, where sleepwalking is the norm and its against the law to wake one up. He also says no family can refuse shelter to any of the night-walkers who roam the streets, bunches of keys clutched in their hands.
If you think thats odd, wait till you check out Maddins family, re-cast and re-created for the audience. His father died when Maddin was a boy; to recreate the family dynamic, hes been exhumed, laid out on the living room floor and covered by an area rug. Mother is played by Ann Savage, an actress who reached brief stardom in the 40s as the perfect vixen  and so intense Maddin says she even shook Bette Davis. (Seriously? The icon who took on Joan Crawford?)
Maddin sublet his old home for the film, a mesmerizing assembly of boxes that once housed his mothers beauty salon, a structure for his aunt, and another residence for the family, all joined together like childrens building blocks. (There are photos; this is true.) The heat register in Maddins bedroom was a conduit to the salon, where conversations drifted up to the boys bedside. That should have created enough fodder for several films. Imagine the dramas unfolding down there.
But My Winnipeg gives us a very uncomfortable confrontation between Mother and Maddins sister, who accidently hit a deer with the car, and a scene from Ledge Man, a soap opera in which Mother starred that ran for decades. In every episode, a suicidal person stands on a high ledge, threatening to jump; Mother talks him down. We learn about the towns biggest industry  demolition  and its three-level swimming pool, homoerotic swimsuit competitions, hockey teams and stadiums, and bizarre sances held in government buildings attended by the city government. Apparently, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle was impressed with Winnipeg as a center of paranormal activity; Maddin tells us the areas indigenous people already knew that. Then there are the frozen horse heads, the remains of a terrible  but verifiable  tragedy in the 20s. Did those horses actually freeze in the Red River? No one seems to know.
Meanwhile, Darcy Fehr, cast as Maddin himself, rides the rails, trying to get out of town. Its not his first attempt. Some people can never go home again; Maddin can never leave. The effect is disturbing although, oddly, not unpleasant.
The film itself is made to look deliberately grainy and archaic, like found and damaged footage. Some of it is; Maddin uses home movies in his work, much of which was filmed by his older brother. Interviews found among the bonus features have the widescreen, high-def color and detail weve come to appreciate on Blu-ray. Sound is pretty simple. Maddin narrates the film, playing himself in an old fashioned, melodramatic style. He comes through clearly, but there is little to move through a speaker system, except an occasional train whistle or weather effect.
In the bonus interview, Enright asks direct questions about Maddins material, but there are no concrete revelations. Sometimes the fantasy is so strong, we don't know the truth of it ourselves.
Sometimes its not so much what we know thats happened, but what we convince ourselves is true.   Kay Reynolds",1426896000,9,4473,5.043301759133965
