830486,5,6304288433,"Movie review:
Halloween 2 (1981) is a great sequel to a classic  film, and its by far my favorite sequel in the Halloween franchise.  The story picks up directly following the events of the first Halloween. Laurie (Jamie Lee Curtis) is taken to completely empty Haddonfield Memorial Hospital, and Michael will stop at nothing to kill her.  Donald Pleasance gives a great performance as the unhinged Dr Loomis, who is relentlessly tracking down Michael. Jamie Lee Curtis isn't given much to work with, since Laurie is under sedation for most of the film. The gore is definitely ramped up for this sequel, and the effects look great.

Product review:
The Shout Factory Blu Ray looks and sounds fantastic.  This release is packed full of extras. Multiple commentaries, making of features, trailers, and more.  Also included is the TV cut of Halloween 2.

They are still fun to watch but not really as scary.  On the first one when michael kills his sister ( the first murder ) and he has the mask on, it glides as he moves. Not the normal movement  of a person walking...then when hes stabbing, he makes sure he looks at the knife a few times while he was doing it so the viewer can get a good shot lol. I realize it was the late 70's early 80's but still. The first friday movies although they also had mistakes , were a bit slicker and suspenseful.  Its still a carpenter film and has his vibe all over it...but wow was i aware as a kid...although fun, the first two fridays were better.",1493510400,,807,4.025

D: Rick Rosenthal


Halloween 2 is sadly underrated. Yes, its no horror masterpiece like the original, but its still an able-bodied slasher film in its own right. The first film mastered pure tension and dread, the sequel ups the violence and gory spectacle thanks to a much larger budget. As a pure progression of the plot, Halloween 2 delivers.

830736,3,6304288433,Halloween 2 is a good sequel to it's predecessor and I really wanted to get this blue ray version. Now the transfer is not so bad considering this film is 35 years old and for it's condition is very good. But just my opinion the difference of the picture quality between the dvd and this one is only very minor and in many shots the picture is not as sharp as I would expect coming from a 1080p image. Bad side is that there is no chapter menu so you cannot choose the scenes that you like to see and you're gonna have to fast forward or use your skip buttons to get to the right track of that particular scene you want to see. So I hope they can reissue this again on 4K and let's see if this movie can look a bit sharper than this current release.,1471824000,4,749,4.0

830744,5,6304288433,"WARNING: CONTAINS SPOILERS

Halloween II holds a treasured place amongst my all-time favorite films. And, in my humble opinion, is arguably the greatest slasher film ever made. While most are perfectly content with the acclaimed and groundbreaking 1978 original, I have always gravitated to this one as the definitive ""Halloween"" movie.

About the only thing it lacks relative to the original is merely not being able to say it was first. In all other respects, I prefer it.

The setting is a huge reason for this. A hospital provides a confined and almost claustrophobic environment that propels this film to more suspenseful and perverse heights than the simple ""stalking the neighborhood"" plot. It also sets up the film with a more delicious canvas of victims, namely hot nurses! Oh, sure, it's stereotypical and evokes mannerisms of its time, but it should! After all, we are dealing with a thrill 'n kill slasher film, not something that we need to put into an Academy Awards time capsule.

Director Rick Rosenthal takes John Carpenter and Debra Hill's storyline and manages to continue the ""feel"" of the original while making it more effective and more forthcoming to exploitative situations and creative deaths. Some of my favorite scenes in this film include:

- The chilling opening scene with Alice (Anne Bruner) on the phone.

- Ala Alicia's overall performance as cute orderly nurse Janet.

- Dr. Loomis's frantic pursuit throughout the film that takes him to the school and eventually back to the hospital.

- The death of Nurse Jill (Tawny Morey) as an unsuspecting Michael Myers sneaks up and stabs her in the back, lifting her up until her shoes fall off! It is a scene that is both startling yet somewhat comical (a trademark of any good slasher film).

- The definitive scene in this film belongs to Bud and Nurse Karen (Pamela Susan Shoop). The two sneak away on the job (what naughty nurse wouldn't) and quietly retreat to the hot tub therapy room. Over the course of this scene we are treated to an array of wonderful twists. Nurse Karen takes off her uniform and reveals her gorgeous shapes in one of the genre's most memorable nude scenes. Meanwhile, a prowling Michael cranks the heat up, literally! The hot tub goes from hot to boiling! With her ""Romeo"" dispatched and left for dead outside the room, Michael makes his way inside. Based on how I set this up, you might guess what happens next. If not, you're in for a treat! Let's just say Nurse Karen will not be sneaking away during any more shifts!

- There is also, surprisingly, an element of beautiful cinematography that envelopes parts of this picture. This really jumps out at me in the finale with the fiery plumes and explosions that light up the original 2.35:1 frame with a bright yet haunting glow.

This latest Shout Factory release of Halloween II is spectacular and even provides what is known by many as the ""Producers Cut"" or ""TV Cut"". Familiar viewers of this underrated classic on television will know that this cut features many alterations and added clips. In some cases, the violence of the deaths have been toned down (for TV consumption naturally), while other scenes and snippets enhance the film. Like most alternate cuts of film, some hurt and some help, but the main thing is we now have it! I've actually assembled my ""own"" Halloween II ""Ideal Cut"", where I inserted parts of the TV Cut that I enjoy alongside the more excessive death scenes found in the original theatrical version. In my eyes, while not a seamless endeavor (the theatrical version is widescreen, while the TV Cut is full frame), this makes for the ""perfect"" version of Halloween II. That being said, for practical purposes, if you only watch one, stick with the theatrical!

All in all, Halloween II remains a top of the shelf favorite of mine. It not only tops the original, but might be the best example of a sophomore sequel being the VERY best of its series. While most houses around the country are popping John Carpenter's original classic into their players on the night of October 31st, I'm always putting this film into mine. It is my definitive go-to Halloween movie.

Grab some popcorn, grab a nurses hat (if you happen to be female ;), and watch Summer turn to Autumn with this 1981 masterpiece.

830951,5,6304288433,"Growing up this was the first ""Halloween"" that I saw on cable, not the first film. That said I will say that although after the first and second films none of the sequels got it right especially with the third sequel having nothing to do with Michael Myers. This, the second sequel, in my opinion is actually better than the first and I'll explain why. First is the soundtrack: in 1980/1981 sound engineering was starting to move over to more synthesized and electronic sound which in my opinion sounded even more dark and macabre than the original acoustic soundtrack in the first film. Also for several reasons Michael is just more menacing in this film. For one his mask looks different whether it's the color or the fact it looks dirtier not so white as the first one. Also his movements are more machine like lacking any emotion or human like movements. The poorly lit hospital is missing patients and lacks adequate staff giving the viewer a sense of abandonment that definitely freaked me out after I saw it. I'm a huge fan of the first film as well but I actually think the sequel outdid it in this case which usually with horror films doesn't ever happen.",1442793600,2,1164,4.600961538461538

For this and Halloween 1, the feeling of watching it on Halloween gives you a real feel. That is because of the catchy tune, but I would like to say I do not like how they changed the music in this movie.

831120,5,6304288433,"*Updated review on the Extras* (February 27, 2013)

This review concerns Shout! Factory's new Collector's Edition release of Halloween II, it is not a review of the film itself. But, in the interests of transparency, I do like this film.

The Blu-Ray transfer looks and sounds absolutely stunning. The film looks better than I have ever seen before (TV, VHS and DVD). I read that Shout! did a major upgrade in transferring the film to Blu-Ray and it shows.

In addition to the great transfer, Shout! must be commended on the stellar and abundant extras included in the 2-disc set:

PLEASE NOTE: I have not been able to view all the extras yet, but will add to the review as I do.

1. Television Cut With Added Footage Not Seen In The Theatrical Version

This comes on the second disc (DVD, not Blu-Ray) in the set. OK, watched the TV version now and it's enjoyable, especially seeing the way they re-cut and/or edit scenes, to fit TV censors and time constraints. In addition, there are different (albeit short) scenes that are used to bridge moments in the TV cut that are not seen at all in the original version. Overall, an interesting view and definitely a worthwhile extra.

2. Audio Commentary With Director Rick Rosenthal And Actor Leo Rossi (Theatrical Version)

3. Audio Commentary With Actor/Stunt Coordinator Dick Warlock (Theatrical Version)

I haven't had a chance to listen to the commentaries yet, but I have heard they are very interesting and informative, can't wait!

4. The Nightmare Isn't Over!: The Making Of Halloween II - Featuring interviews with Director Rick Rosenthal, Actor/Stunt Coordinator Dick Warlock, Actors Lance Guest, Leo Rossi, Nancy Stephens, Executive Producer Irwin Yablans, Director of Photography Dean Cundey, Co-Composer Alan Howarth and more!

Looking forward to watching this featurette, it's always a good sign when most of the cast/crew participates.

5. Horror's Hallowed Grounds: The Locations Of Halloween II - Host Sean Clark revisits the original shooting locations of the film

This was a great featurette that I was really looking forward to as I had already read the print version in HorrorHound magazine. It is interesting to see how some locations have changed drastically in the last 30+ years, while some have not changed a bit.

6. Deleted Scenes with Optional Audio Commentary From Director Rick Rosenthal

Decent deleted scenes, but what makes this featurette is the commentary on those scenes. All DVD releases with deleted scenes should have commentary on them, to put them in perspective as to why they weren't included.

7. Alternate Ending With Optional Audio Commentary From Director Rick Rosenthal

As with the Deleted Scenes, the commentary really helps put the alternate ending in perspective. And it's a pretty good alternate, with some key differences.

8. Theatrical Trailer

Love when they include trailers. It brings back memories for the ones I have seen and also shows how good the restoration on the Blu-Ray really is!

9. TV & Radio Spots

More fun nostalgia. Why can't trailers and TV spots be like this today?

10. Still Gallery

Some interesting shots and behind the scenes photos, but I always wish there was some sort of text to go along with these Still Galleries.

Overall, I highly recommend this release to Halloween fans, horror fans and fans of things that go bump in the night!

831237,2,6304288433,"My problem with this set is very basic. There are so many DVD/Blu-ray combos out there now, the same movie but both formats offered, which is nice, as I have no blu-ray player and these combos are sometimes the only way to get a movie on DVD now, as not all movies are made on stand-alone DVDs.

That said, I thought that was what I was buying here...the title of the listing says ""Blu-ray/DVD"", and of course in the description you know you are getting both the thatrical cut (which I wanted) and the TV version (which I think sucks but would be cool to have). I thought that there would be a Blu-ray disc of the theatrical cut and the TV print, and a DVD of both as well. However, upon opening my package, I find that the theatrical print is on a Blu-ray disc and the TV print is on a DVD! Nowhere in the advertising (unless I just missed it) does it say anything about one movie being on a Blu-ray and the other on the DVD. It was the natural assumption that both versions were being offered on both Blu-ray and DVD format, to accomodate whichever player you have. And not everyone in the world has gone to Blu-ray yet (whether they should or not is a different matter!)

So now I am basically stuck with only the crappy TV version to watch and a Blu-ray disc of the movie I wanted that I can't watch. Now, not a biggie, as Blu-ray players are cheap and I probably need to get one anyway, but that doesn't alter the point that it was VERY misleading what was being offered here.  I was literally speechless when I opened the case.

I will keep the Blu-ray disc and I'm sure get a player at some point, but again, this stuff should have been clearly stated in the Amazon description and you'd think on the case itself (which says NOTHING about one movie being Blu-ray and the other being DVD).  Again, very misleading and should have been spelled out.",1415059200,3,1853,4.2979942693409745

831346,4,6304288433,"Halloween II was released in 1981, three years after the original kick-started the cinematic career of one of Hollywood's most iconic slasher movie villains. Even now, the general consensus among critics is that it failed to live up to the first installment's greatness by a landslide. The screenplay was co-written by John Carpenter, though director duties were passed onto Rick Rosenthal. Rosenthal's ""evident lack of experience"" is cited as the movie's primary downfall.

After giving it another viewing more than 30 years later, Halloween II hits the right notes with a deep sense of 80's nostalgia. The narrative may be ""simple"" to some, but the fact that it literally picks up where the first story ends marks a welcome enough return of Michael Myers that time has ironed out any gaps in quality between the first and second films. Jamie Lee Curtis (Laurie Strode), Donald Pleasence (Sam Loomis), and Charles Cyphers (Leigh Brackett) reprise their roles and cement the bridge in plot so seamlessly that both Halloween I & II can be viewed back-to-back as a single film.

Michael Myers dons a more intimidating appearance, with a dirtier and more disheveled mask. He invades a hospital to terrorize its denizens and pick them off one-by-one. Director Rick Rosenthal (possibly with John Carpenter's help) uses a greater amount of creative leverage when depicting the various ways in which Michael Myers kills his victims. A doctor is stabbed in the eye with a syringe, a nurse takes a lethal brain injection by way of temple, and another gets her face boiled off in scalding hot water. Don't forget that Myers himself is walking around like a piece of Swiss cheese after being stabbed and shot multiple times at the end of the first film.

Laurie Strode is damn near vegetable after all the trauma she has suffered, though her survival instincts kick in when Myers gains entry to her hospital ward to finish her off once and for all. Sam Loomis resumes his paranoid quest to kill Myers, at one point flailing around like a madman and shooting at a crowded street of trick-or-treaters because one is dressed akin to his maniac fugitive. Hours later, after the coroner concludes that the now incinerated corpse is in fact a random 17-year-old, Loomis shrugs off his folly and stomps off into the night as dementia continues to ravage his brain.

Halloween II is still widely considered a failure and was followed a year later by the spin-off anthology ""Halloween III: Season of the Witch."" Michael Myers would not be seen again until Halloween 4 hit theaters in 1988. Though the franchise's flame dwindled with each successive release, the iconic killer maintained a powerful enough screen presence in Halloween II that it's a joy to watch in comparison to later films in the series. Great horror schlock overall, criminally underrated movie >>> 4 stars.",1413676800,2,2856,4.95615866388309

First disc is a Blu-Ray copy of Halloween II in anamorphic widescreen, a lot of decent special features and the usual trailers. Disc 2 is a DVD copy of the television version of Halloween II, presented in fullscreen. this is basically the film with 90% of the sex and violence removed and replaced with deleted scenes and alternative ending. It's actually fairly boring as a standalone, but as an extra for the collector it's great to get it.

831480,5,6304288433,"Maybe 4 years or so ago, I remember seeing the TV cut of this film on AMC and thinking 'what the hell?' Lol. It's sloppily edited and doesn't make a lot of sense sometimes. BUT the aggravating part is that some of the scenes are extended or alternate or new and they really add to the characters (to me). I think my favorites are the scene of Janet and Karen chatting about Michael and being creeped out, the scene where they show the lights go out (DUH, THAT SHOULD'VE BEEN IN THERE... IT JUST GOES TOTALLY UNEXPLAINED!!!), and the extended scene where Jill and Jimmy are talking, and Nurse Jill actually says something about leaving and getting help. Lol. They fleshed them out a bit more, and made them seem a bit more smart and likable. They didn't appear as clueless as they did in the theatrical cut. Despite all that, it's pretty bad. Unnecessary dubbing, moving scenes around, cutting parts of scenes into new ones, and obviously, censorship. Oh God, and near the beginning, with Mr and Mrs Elrod, they make it appear like he killed her by putting this screenshot of Michael in the scene lol. It's nuts.

But anyway, the movie itself is presented very nicely, one of the better Shout releases. And I loved the bonus features... it was nice seeing much of the cast. The commentary was very insightful as well. And besides the TV cut being pretty bad, it makes for a fun and nostalgic watch. Lol, it even has the 'this has been edited' thing in the beginning. And hello, it's (in my opinion) one of the better sequels in the series and has some great and memorable death scenes.

All in all, buy this release. !!!!!!!!!!!!!",1410652800,3,1629,4.537414965986395

Curtis and Donald Pleasance are great in the first two movies.  If you want a good scare, catch this movie.

It might be one of the best of the Halloween series, but that just goes to show how often it is a series that scrapes the bottom of the barrel. It's a little dull, a little too deliberately paced, and the seeds of many of the series' biggest issues like Michael's obsession with family and Druid curses are planted here.

Still, this disc is FANTASTIC and if you're like me and only care about four Halloween films (I, II, III, and H20) then I'd recommend going this avenue instead of buying the forthcoming outrageously priced complete collection.",1405641600,,687,4.631147540983607

It looks like a brand new movie. Thanks Scream Factory for caring about your work and what you do...IT SHOWS!

However, I further didn't enjoy the movie because I felt no emotion towards this cast, which is the main reason I didn't like most Friday the 13th movies. Also the twist of this movie makes Michaels behavior very questionable.

However I am even more annoyed about the fact that, once again, studio's release the extra's for this movie over two releases.

831799,4,6304288433,"With John Carpenters Halloween a big hit, it was inevitable that there would be a sequel. And while he had no intention of directing it, Carpenter along with Debra Hill wrote Halloween II which takes place on the same night of the original, basically picking up right where the first film leaves off. The flick continues the story with an injured Laurie Strode (Jaime Lee Curtis) being taken to a hospital in Haddonfield while Dr. Loomis (Donald Pleasance) and the police scour the neighborhood for the still at large Michael Myers (stuntman Dick Warlock). But, unbeknownst to them, Michael has discovered Lauries whereabouts and heads to the hospital to find her, leaving a trail of bodies along the way and once there he begins to decimate the hospital staff in search of his prey. It is in this film we find Laurie is actually Michaels other sister and he has come home to finish the job he started 15 years ago. While Halloween II is far from the masterpiece that Halloween is, it is a classic in its own right and in retrospect is definitely among one of the better slasher flicks of the 80s. Carpenter chose unknown Rick Rosenthal to direct and its hard to tell just how much of the films effectiveness is his, as it is said that producer Carpenter was unhappy with the film and did some re-editing and reshooting himself upping the gore and nudity quotas which, in turn, made Rosenthal unhappy with the film. Photographed by Dean Cundey, the look of the film certainly matches the first and with Carpenter again handling the music, the atmosphere is there. The two flicks fit together quite nicely but, its hard to tell just how well Rosenthal did as director when Carpenter basically took over post production and added new material and rearranged sequences. The result is a solid slasher with some decent kills and gore and some nice suspense sequences as Myers stalks Laurie and the hospital staff in the dark hallways of the nearly abandoned hospital night shift. It has its intense moments and it certainly is a bit more brutal then the first with a much larger body count. Though, obviously it doesnt have the first films finesse. The cast all perform well with Curtis once again strong as Laurie and Donald Pleasance seamlessly reprising his role as Loomis. Dick Warlock gives Michael a powerful presence and newcomers Jeff East, Leo Rossi, Ana Alicia and Pamela Susan Shoop are all suitable as hospital staff and potential victims. Who actually deserves more credit for making this sequel a solid slasher and a decent follow-up to Carpenters classic is not clear but, what is clear is that despite the large shoes it had to fill, Halloween II is an entertaining and effective slasher sequel that over time has come to stand on its own and has earned its own reputation as a classic. Scream Factory's restored and remastered blu-ray is a beautiful disc filled with some fun extras that they are fast becoming famous for and includes the re-editied TV version as well!",1386892800,4,2981,4.7678916827853
831800,5,6304288433,"I love the slasher movies of the 70's and 80's and the Halloween movies are at the top of my list. I always thought Halloween II got a bad rap from most people. I know the original was and is still the best, but II stands very well by it's brother. It ramps up the killings from the first one and the hospital setting adds a surreal vibe to it that gives the movie a great edge.
 Up front let me say that I hate edited movies. I want to see it the way it was made and released. That said, I always thought the TV edit of Halloween ll was well done and might even be called Halloween III if you like. The TV version, while staying close to the movie cut, changes elements around and ends somewhat differently.

as for the the Blu-ray itself i must applaud Universal for doing such a good job not only restoring this classic for HD transfer, but also including for the 1st time ever newly remastered 5.1 audio. the Shout!

Some initial notes: The disc ships in a very cheaply made all cardboard booklet with no plastic cover, which surely won't hold up to wear and tear. In fact, the back of the cardboard booklet only has the image ""glued"" on with 4 pieces of the kind of jelly fastener you find when you get a new credit card in the mail...you can actually remove it. I actually did, and reset it, as mine came shipped with it slapped on pretty crooked. Annoyingly, it's also one of these booklet cases that's about 1/2"" taller than all your other DVD's, so it won't fit nicely on your shelf (and doesn't even look nice next to the 35th Anniversary Edition of Halloween I, which ships in the standard blu-ray blue case). It also has this cheesy movie art poster (with the visible crease lines intact on the scanned image) on the cover, but interesting includes a reversible cover with the more ""original"" pumpkin face artwork and title on the back, from when the movie was released. First thing i did was reverse the cover to look more like the original box/posters when it was released. ;-)

Another curious note: The TV version is a DVD, not a Blu-Ray disc, in the Blu-Ray release. I guess they didn't want to spend the extra money to remaster it, since it was shot for TV originally and probably not in high-def in those days anyway. Kind of a cheap shot to do this with no mention of it in the packaging until you open it. Oh well.

This is still the only version released yet worth buying, as far as I can tell.",1380067200,3,1744,4.44375
832031,4,6304288433,"During the 80's slasher craze it would have been a miracle for a successful horror film not to have its sequel. Michael Myers was made into an icon of fright overnight and would forever imprint his expressionless face into the hearts of many; as a result, the fans screamed for more relentless carnage and they got it, in its flawed but magnificent form, on the morning after the first fateful Halloween night.
Intended more as a continuation of the first series of events, the viewer is left seeing Loomis stare at the ground in horror, seeing only small specks of blood where Myers corpse should lay. Meanwhile, Laurie Strode is being rushed to the hospital, while reports of the madman on the loose have been released to the small town. Michael continues on his murderous rampage while the sheriff discovers, with Loomis, that his only child is one of the victims. Loomis stays determined to find the killer - who he swears is still somehow alive - and with the help of an upset deputy, ends up making situations much worse. At the hospital Laurie meets Jimmy, a paramedic close to her own age, who befriends her and exchanges harmless teenage flirting. Like Loomis, Laurie's convinced Myers is still alive, and begins making plans to protect herself. Of course the viewer knows the two are right and we sit back to witness various examples of senseless slaughter, silly teenage bantering, and gratuitous nudity.

Halloween 2 is a more than worthy sequel, not only rehashing much of what worked in the original formula, but expanding it by widening Myers killing circle and his motivations. The script is peppered with a bit more raunchy, ridiculous seasoning, but it does introduce some clever backstory. The connection between Strode and Myers was an interesting one to invent, and it is that familial connection that enabled more sequels to be produced. One could argue that the lack of reasoning behind Myers madness is one of the things that worked so well with Halloween, however, and that trying to explain things away - albeit clumsily - in the second go around only muddled the waters a bit. I'm not sure yet how I stand on the issue - I would have dug both methods, I think - but I don't try to put too much brain power into it.

While the first movie had a hint of newness about it, the second just continued something fans had already fell in love with, not able to break any more new ground. Although some of the shock had worn off by the time a sequel shows its head, they thankfully kept Michael the same (unlike the Nightmare on Elm Series with the dismissal part 2), keeping his killing style similar to the first. One thing different was that the gore was laid on thicker, making it seem more of a standard slasher film than its predecessor. In the original little gore was used and Carpenter attempted suspense without trying to shock. In the second the director wasn't happy with Rosenthals version being scary enough, and went in to add some more violence/gore himself - the hot tub scene, the razor blade apple, the nurse-needle-eye - which is a bit to a contradiction, but oh well.

Suspense is built as in the first one, but with a different style from director Rosenthal. The man IS talented, I almost bit my knuckle off when Laurie was on the ground outside trying to distract her potential help! Mood is still grim,  heavy, and harrowing. If he would only have spruced up some of the slower scenes, he would have been nearly perfect. Alan Howarth reworked the original score a bit, giving it more of an 80's electric vibe, and while it didn't carry the same terror as it did before, it worked well here and was used wisely. Who doesn't start getting excited when they hear this score now?

 I didn't find Halloween too slow, but I enjoyed how part 2 picked up the pace a bit. In the first film Michael stayed more in the shadows, yet here since the cat's already been let out of the bag they don't mind giving him a little more spot light. The kills were a little more creative, although flash doesn't always out-equal class. I really got into the flashbacks Laurie had - they were trippy and beautiful at the same time, strange - and more of those would have been welcomed. Good, unexpected move there. As in the original, the final showdown between predator and prey was phenomenal. Plenty of suspense and chills, ending with a small twist of irony.

For the bad, the script is just too damn slow in some parts. It's actually boring for a few minutes here and there, especially blabber with the staff. There was a mood about these scenes that induced more yawns than interest from yours truly, although I can't really put my finger on why. There were also holes and inconsistencies galore - too many to be ignored for fans - that irritated. This hospital had to be one of the more bare hospitals in existence, with only one security guard and basically zero patients. Phones and lights don't work, people leave doors open to hear patients if they call for help, the newborns seemed to have spontaneously reproduced with no parents around, and the ease of breaking in and murdering in the halls is ludicrous. Introducing the backstory of Druidism didn't  make a lick of sense and seemed to be reaching too much. It's clear the scriptwriter was grabbing his head and trying to think of something to add to the 'story.' Didn't work, sorry.

Halloween worked so well for so many reasons, and even though it holds its baskets of holes, Halloween 2 tried hard to live up to expectations. Faster at times, maintaining some of the originals suspense, and delivered with a more vicious, bloody knife, it had to let go of some plausibility and follow more of a formula. Overall a more than fun sequel to the original, continuing the reign of terror through that small town Haddonfield, by a killer who would later be called ""The Shape.""",1379635200,,5858,4.635838150289017
832032,5,6304288433,I love Halloween and when they came out with the Blu-Ray of Halloween II and included the TV Version I was very happy.  Everytime this version came on TV I was always working for I was out of DVD discs.  The TV version is not in Blu-Ray but standard DVD but still looks better than when you watch it on TV.  I hope they come out with the Halloween 6 Producer's cut I bought on Ebay years ago that version was 10x better than the Halloween 6 they came out with on DVD.,1379548800,,467,4.0

832038,4,6304288433,"Halloween II features Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis) being stalked in a hospital after the injuries inflicted by Michael Myers in the original Halloween. The sequel doesn't live up to its predecessor but it is bloodier. It is one of the better horror sequels though (and certainly the best sequel in the Halloween franchise). The plot is a logical extension of the original film in a hospital setting (a slasher subgenre in horror).

Buy this 2-disc Halloween II Collector's Edition from Shout! Factory. It's jam-packed with stuff considering its only a sequel (most studios don't dream of releasing extras for them). Skip the single disc 30th Anniversary edition (which includes Terror in the Aisles) as it is nearly obsolete now. This BD/DVD is a real treat because of the extra cut, extra content and extra commentaries. Modern films don't have it this good. This version does not include the horror documentary Terror in the Aisles (1984) which is now sold separately. That documentary is a compilation of trailers and scenes from science fiction, crime drama and horror films of the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s. It is an enjoyable look back at some of the all-time classics but guest stars Donald Pleasence and Nancy Allen don't offer much in-depth analysis about the films. It does leave one wanting more and perhaps inspires you to watch the films. Ultimately you aren't missing much because the clips will be familiar to hardcore horror fans. It got a theatrical release in the 1980s but doesn't hold up well now.",1374969600,,2235,5.275280898876405

832171,4,6304288433,"If you're like me, you wouldn't put Halloween II on the same level as the original Halloween. That doesn't mean that Halloween II isn't a good follow up. In truth, I've always liked Halloween II(I am always fond of sequels that take up right where the original left off)  and view it as a worthy sequel to John Carpenter's classic. The fact that Jamie Lee Curtis and Donald Pleasance reprise their roles from the first film and that Carpenter still has his finger prints on this movie despite not being the director help to at least keep it in the same league as the original.
 This Blu Ray/DVD pack comes with alternate artwork cover(very nice) and and very good HD transfer. The DVD is of the Halloween II TV version and contains some footage not in the theatrical cut. In addition, there is a Halloween II featurette that has some great interviews and back story. Truthfully, Halloween II has never looked better and this edition belongs in any true fan's collection of the Halloween series.",1368057600,2,994,4.674285714285714
832172,5,6304288433,"Halloween 2 continues where the first left off. Myers is still on the loose and Dr. Loomis is hot on his trail as the wounded and medicated Laurie Strode is left vulnerable in a nearby hospital. We are introduced to some new supporting characters in the way of doctors, ambulance drivers, nurses and a deputy. Halloween 2 was made in 1981 three years after the first movie. The first movie had spawned a ton of copycats and slashers that focused more on gore than the suspense that made Halloween one a classic.

  The gore in this movie is good. It helps to separate the first movie from itself. The gore helped make it not the same movie. It still has suspense as the ending rocked and was very suspenseful. The hospital setting is very creepy and atmospheric as Myers could be looming anywhere.

  The movie moves pretty fast from the beginning shot. One of the things I liked about this movie is it was never slow. There was always action. The acting was very solid as we are introduced to a lot of characters. Another strong point is the ending. It had to be one of the best endings to a horror movie I've ever seen. It was exciting.

  One negative aspect of the film is Jamie Lee Curtis is in drugged up from the surgery in the hospital half the film and unable to make the acting impact til towards the last third of the film. Even so she still gives one of her best performances in a horror movie. I thought it could have worked setting this film five to ten years after the first halloween but with the way they chose it here it worked very well.

  Donald Pleasence gives a performance to match his performance in the first movie. The Sheriff Charles Cyphers is great in the small amount of time he is in the film. Hunter Von Leer does a great job as the Deputy. Lance Guest who plays Jimmy the ambulance driver who knows Laurie gave a solid performance. He was very likable although he doesn't fit the mold of a tough guy hero he is a good guy. He maybe overmatched with Myers but I'll let you see what happens. The confrontation of Loomis and Myers in the end is nothing short of epic.

  Jamie Lee Curtis is the greatest Final Girl of all time. I loved watching this movie as a kid and it still holds up today as my favorite horror movies. Both Jamie Lee Curtis and Donald Pleasence were great iconic actors in the horror genre and this movie helped to cement their legacies and making this film unforgettable. I reccomend this to all horror movie fans and those looking for a good scary movie on Halloween. Cheers",1367798400,,2528,4.371794871794871

832231,5,6304288433,"While Halloween II isn't as good as Carpenter's original, this is still a really effective flick and leagues beyond any of the other original sequels or the Rob Zombie reboot series. It's an atmospheric little film that still manages to retain the feel of the original, even as it devolves into slasher movie madness by upping the kill count from the first and spills even more blood this time around. Michael Myers is still as frightening as he was and maybe even more so. The hospital setting is great, providing a genuinely scary and memorable location for the bulk of the film. Jamie Lee Curtis and Donald Pleasance are great as well, reprising their roles from the original films.

This Blu-Ray edition of the film gets high marks due to Scream Factory's treatment of the film, providing a beautiful transfer of the film along with worthwhile extras. It's really nice to see a film like this get treated with respect, even if it's just a B-movie horror flick. There are a couple of nice behind the scenes extras produced exclusively for this disc that are full of interesting background info on  the production of Halloween II and it's fun to hear the recollections of many of the original cast (except for Jamie Lee Curtis and John Carpenter who aren't here but the other participants more than make up for it) more than thirty years after the film's release.

Also packaged is the television cut of the film which is a good thing for purists. Highly recommended for horror buffs. Keep an eye out for Scream Factory, as they've been putting out quite a line up of classic horror films as of late.",1363046400,3,1602,4.673758865248227

I really liked this special edition but wished the Directors Cut was included instead of the TV version. The directors cut had scaled back the violence and had an alternate ending, the TV version seems to have been cut from that version. The TV version which I have never seen until now seems a bit of a mess to me. Some of the scenes are run out of sequence and a lot of UN-necessary dialogue has been added to pad out the running time for television.

832489,5,6304288433,"This particular film in the Halloween doesn't seem to get the credit it deserves and often instead seems to get dismissed as being just another terrible sequel in the franchise. While there are a lot of bad sequels in the series, Rick Rosenthal's Halloween 2 is not one of them. Its true that it doesn't compare to the quality of John Carpenter's original but it stands on its own enough to be a legitimate and entertaining sequel.

The film picks up immediately where Carpenter's film ended. Loomis goes out onto the balcony to find Michael's body....gone. He immediately runs out into the front yard and continues his pursuit of Michael while the paramedics arrive and take Laurie to the hospital.

The film has some great bonus features including featuring both the theatrical version and the extended television version of the movie. It also has a commentary track from Rick Rosenthal and Leo Rossi (he played Bud the ambulance driver) and a detailed making of Halloween 2 featurette that goes into great detail describing the process that it took to get Halloween 2 to the screen including some very blunt interviews from the cast, crew and producers.

832492,3,6304288433,"Halloween II has always been fascinating to me, because it is the first sequel I ever saw that picks up literally from the last frame of the original film and does not jump forward in time.  It is especially cool since it was filmed a couple years after the original, so it was not from a back to back shoot where they would have been there anyway.  The film itself is not quite up to par with the original as far as suspense, it is more of a straight up slasher flick with more violent and inventive kills, but definitely missing Carpenter's ability to build suspense while providing scares.  However it is still a very enjoyable sequel in comparison to the rest of the Michael Myers series, with some good performances, and an entertaining conclusion.

832495,3,6304288433,"Of all the Halloween films, this is by far the most uninspired, but not always the most unwatchable.  There are parts to this film that I really do enjoy, and yet it doesn't really stick out to me as anything other than a clone of other more inspired work.  To go back to the time that this film was made, you have to realize that I think it was the first iconic horror sequel (Maybe not historically, but of the big slasher villains that are still popular and being remade today.)  John Carpenter had no intention of doing this film, as he felt like he had done everything that he cared to do with the first volume, but he sure didn't mind the royalties, so the film was developed at Universal, where Carpenter would spend a large part of his career in the 80's.  The idea of pre-steady cam pov shots that were popular in the first film were maintained with a new sense of gore that had emerged in the genre since the release of the first film.  This lead to the original pick for director (IT's Tommy Lee Wallace) leaving the film.  Rick Rosenthal, who had the same agent as Carpenter, was brought in.  What you end up with is a original script and concept by Carpenter that is now being handed over to a large studio, you still have Akad, an Arab film producer who had released the original that still had rights to the franchise, Rosenthal who would try and put his own stamp on it.  While the story line picks up exactly where the first film left off, and it does film in the gap of how we see the story from, but it really greatly deviates from the original and I can't help but wonder if the sequels hurt the legacy of the original.  The lighting and camera work in this film remind me a lot of the first film, as their aren't any immediate stylistic deviations in the film, and you never lose the sense that it occurs in middle America, as Loomis is driving around trying to find Michael after he isn't there after being shot seven times by a six shooter.  Lauri is taken to the local hospital, and there seems to be too films that are taking place.

Loomis, who is looking for clues that takes him to the school where he finds that Lauri Strode is Michael's sister, as well as the Samhain reference on the wall, in what appears to be blood, though it has to be asked whose blood it is as no one has been murdered at the school that I can tell.  We also have the fake Michael being killed, which really doesn't serve any part of the story that I can tell other than to mock adults/law enforcement because we know better than them, but this dynamic doesn't really work for me as Loomis is a very well accepted hero, though the effect of the car crash immediately going into flames is iconic.  At the very heart of this film, there is a lot of images that work, and B movie coolness that is inserted without context or consideration for tone, that are added with the hollywood problem of throwing money at creative issues.  The Samhain reference of course would lead to the Halloween 5 and 6 story lines, though the druid occults have yet to come into play so we hear the iconic line from Loomis that we really haven't evolved much in 2000 years, meaning that as a species we still kill things and there is still evil in the world.

This can be seen in the scene with the child who has the razor in his mouth at the hospital.  The new older cast seems to be less interested in pretense of innocence resulting in one of my favorite minor characters in the Halloween franchise with Budd, who sings foul songs and seems to only care about sex, not in the childish sense that he is new to girls, but that he still has rules of girls he won't go after, as this is more welcome to the grown up world where sex is a common occurrence.  The kills attempt to begin taking center stage as Michael eventually shows up, after a laughable jump out of the shadows first kill.  Once we get to the hospital we really begin to see where all the cooks in the kitchen got their say.  Rosenthal's first version of the film that has never been released, as Carpenter, after seeing the first cut of the film, felt that it would ruin the legacy of his first film, and reshot some key scenes to be more scary/gory.  Rosenthal would protest and eventually go on to direct the series ending Halloween Resurection (I still have memories of being the only guy in the theater for that one).  Akad didn't like the razor scene so I wonder just what else was cut.  I also have to say that the lighting in the hospital is still dark like the other parts of the film, so much so that even the film makers comment on it in the commentary.  It is a film that felt a need to change from the original in more elaborate kills that would include an eye puncture and graphic nudity in the hot tub scene, and want to change the scenery without changing it at all.  This is the film that Jamie Lee Curtis doesn't do interviews about.  The movie where a character slips and falls to his death, or at least seemingly so.  The whole film just seems uneven, and with two directors and lots of influence, especially from Friday the 13th, it is just hard to see this as a stand alone effort that tries to make you forget this isn't a John Carpenter film, while the idea that they needed to include gore almost apologizes for the superior first film

The ending of the film, where Michael ""dies"" is a great stunt that includes the image of him crying blood from the eye holes of his mask in front of the sister he is trying to kill after she shoots him in the eyes (good shot), punctuated by an incredible fire stunt.  Though these seemed to mortalize Michael or at least take away from the he can't be killed vibe of the first.  It goes into that formulaic concept of killing the horror icon at the end of each installment that would plague later installments of most franchises.  Nothing has topped the simplicity of having the killer go through something that should have killed him and him still be out there trying to kill you that the first film left you with, and after seeing the first film, you assume that Michael is going to keep coming until Laurie is dead, which she does eventually die in Halloween 8, but I'm pretty sure our imaginations did a much better job of filling in the details.

Also, I wanted to comment about the different versions of this film that are available.  I have two different versions of this film, the original universal release that was packaged with Halloween III, though the extras are consistent with with the single film release with the black and white Michael face on the cover.  I also bought the Collector's edition that includes a TV version of the film that is supposed to me more closely edited with the original Rosenthal material that does not seem to be very different than the theatrical version, though there are a couple of different cuts made to the film, but nothing to change the tone or composition and still includes the imposed Carpenter cuts, so either the Rosenthal version is not as different as we have been lead to believe or it is just never going to see the light of day.  There are a few new special features that I enjoyed on this edition.  I have not seen the 30th anniversary edition to know if the special features are different, but do see a slight difference in contrast in picture in the special edition that I prefer, though no remastering was labeled.  I also want to point out that I have not seen any Blu Ray versions of the film, but find that films made prior to the 90s do not seem to upgrade well past DVD and it seems a waste of money at least in past older releases I have purchased.",1352937600,2,7626,4.334504567814476

So I watched the original Halloween blu-ray that Starz or Anchor Bay put out several years ago, followed by this. The Anchor Bay blu-ray is fantastic for picture quality. It was like watching Halloween for the first time. Very impressed.

Then I followed it with this.......and was very disappointed. The picture quality sucks, to say the least. Very grainy, especially in some darker scenes. I know that some grain is supposed to be there but this had grain throughout the whole movie. It is just a poor quality transfer.

To watch it on it's own, I probably would not think so poorly of this blu-ray, but watching it after the stunning picture quality of Halloween, it was very disappointing. It is still a better picture than the DVD would be, but I expect more from a Blu-ray.

Why couldn't they just have ended the series with this film,where Michael Myers,an ordinary psycho killer finally gets killed off. Nothing supernatural or fake,but something that could really happen. Anyway,Halloween II is a good Horror flick,taking place the same night as the first film,with Michael Myers going after his sister Laurie,once again,but this time at the hospital.

Just read film critic Roger Ebert's reviews of Halloween and Halloween 2 for a proper assessment of these two movies. As he says, ""It's a little sad to witness a fall from greatness, and that is what we get with Halloween 2."" Probably the only thing worthwhile about the DVD is the audio commentaries.",1350950400,3,664,4.588235294117647

It actaully explains more, and you can see the child side in Michael Myers.  The tv version also goes in sync with the comic books.  Laurie Strode ""He won't die mama! He Won't go away!""  True red-neck vioce!  This movie is considered the red headed step child of the series.  It never gets Tv play, it's never part of a boxset, it's never part of a flash back in any of the sequals, Jamie Lee never talks about, and people never realized that there were versions of the movie.  Halloween III and V, and VI get more respect!(3 had nothing to do with Halloween, and 5&6 were god awful!)  I have watched it twice already! The documentury was was cool! Halloween II is really where it should have ended.  H20 was good, but there was so much more of a back story on Laurie Strode.  We needed to have flash backs of her hell.  H2o never explains why she faked her death, and how Jimmy really died. They also never mentioned Michael coming back after her again in after part II and H20.  How Dr. Loomis and Maryann Chambers hid her from Michael.
Part 8 should have had jamie lee unconsious in the hall with Michael missing.(having her dream that she cut off Michael's Head.) or you have them say that's how LL cool j put the ending in his book that he was writing.

832677,5,6304288433,"I got a chance to watch Halloween 2 with the director's commentary on which I thought was very well done.  Rick Rosenthal and Leo Rossi (one of the ambulence drivers in the movie) seem like old friends and give you some great insight into the movie.  Leo references several times about how he's kept in touch with some of the co-stars of Halloween and Halloween 2 via conventions and autograph signings.  It just shows you the popularity of these films and the cult following they have.  The deleted scenes are excellent and also have Rick's commentary on them.  I wish that Scream Factory and Universal would have allowed Rick to edit these scenes back into the movie the way they were supposed to be and given us a true ""Rosenthal Cut"" vs. the TV version.  As it is well known, John Carpenter went back after viewing the original cut and directed several scenes that were more violent and better competed with the slasher films that were coming out in the early '80's like Friday the 13th.  Carpenter felt like the movie wasn't scary enough when actually, the script was this issue, which Carpenter and Debra Hill wrote.

I think that Halloween 2 is an under appreciated sequel to arguabally one of the greatest horror movies of all time.  Is is a good at the original?  Of course not...very few sequels ever are.  But if you watch both movies, you can see where Rosenthal used very similar camera angle techniques that Carpenter used in the first movie.  It would have been interesting to see the original Rosenthal cut with Carpenter's music from the original...NOT the digitized score.  Carpenter readily admits that he saved the original Halloween with music and that it wasn't scary in the original screening before it.  I'll bet that Halloween 2 would have been much better received if those 2 things happened.

Anyway, I enjoyed this new Collector's Edition of Halloween 2 and would recommend it over the recently released 30th Anniverary Blu Ray edition.  Sorry, for me the bonus material in this version outweigh the ""Terror in the Aisles"" bonus movie.

P.S.  Look for Dana Carvey in a bit role (his first movie appearance) as a reporter in the beginning of the movie.

Laurie (Jamie Lee Curtis) is brought to the local hospital where she is recovering from wounds caused by the maniacal Michael Myers. There he tracks her down to finish what he started and as a result a series of murders takes place.

 To me what was exceptionally inventive is the reason Michael wants to kill Laurie and it is revealed about half-way through the film.

 On a paltry $2.5 million budget ""Halloween 2"" grossed a very impressive $26,000,000 and fans simply loved it. My only problem with the movie was Jamie Lee's wardrobe. LOL.

832821,4,6304288433,"Shout! Factory's horror division, which they've christened Scream! Factory, continues to release quality Blu-ray versions of cult classics most uneducated viewers write off as B-movie schlock. One of those 1980s gems they've treated like cinema royalty is ""Halloween II."" Many look at this sequel as the unwanted imitator of the original that upped the gore ante and added cheap jump moments where genuine ones of suspense once were. However, there's a legion of fans out there of the franchise that carry a treaty loyalty to the film and its cast and creators. The new ""Halloween II: Collector's Edition"" was put together for those individuals.

""Halloween II"" begins exactly at the end of the original film. Dr. Loomis (Donald Pleasance) runs downstairs into the front yard of the house he found Michael Myers (Dick Warlock) and Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis) in. He discovers that Myers has walked off from the spot where he landed after Loomis shot him several times knocking him off the 2nd story balcony. Laurie is rushed to Haddonfield Memorial Hospital where she's admitted for treatment. Michael tracks her down to the hospital and begins killing the medical personnel one by one in his search for Laurie. Can Dr. Loomis track him down and end his reign of terror before Myers can get to his sister?

Is ""Halloween II"" as good as or better than its predecessor? Of course not. Is it good in its own right as an entertaining slasher film? I believe it is. Director Rick Rosenthal did what any man picking up the reigns from a master like John Carpenter would. First, he uses the same director of photography to capture the movie visually. Next, Rosenthal tries to hang on to the suspense that made the first movie a hit, but at the same time add more moments of gore to elevate it to a different level. Did it work all the time? No, it didn't.

However, it did add all sorts of iconic moments that viewers still hang on to and celebrate to this day. Moments like the blood running down Myers' mask after Laurie shoots him in the eyes; the swishing of the scalpel as he blindly swings it in front of him trying to kill whoever gets in his way; the POV shots of the killer stalking while we hear his heavy breathing under the mask; and who can forget the scene where the mother is taking her little boy to the emergency room after he bit into an apple with a razor in it? That put Halloween in a bad light from the moment it first debuted in front of an audience.

It's great to see a cast give such genuine performances in what many actors might write off as an opportunity to just pick up an easy paycheck. Jamie Lee Curtis returns in the role of Laurie Strode and isn't given a lot of dialogue to work with but does her best to deliver legitimate bursts of fear and anxiety as she crawls and stumbles around the hospital hiding from Michael Myers. Lance Guest (""The Last Starfighter"") plays paramedic Jimmy who is convincingly intent on keeping Laurie safe from Myers' clutches. Donald Pleasance returns as Dr. Loomis and continues to add a level of class and drama to the film that many slasher movies of the decade sorely lacked.

The high-definition transfer of ""Halloween II"" delivers the movie to fans in a whole new light that I'm sure it's never been seen in. The picture is as clean and vibrant as its ever been. The 5.1 audio guarantees that John Carpenter and Alan Howarth's eerie electronic score mixed with the screams, gunshots, knife swishing, and heavy-breathing terrifyingly envelopes you.

Shout! Factory scores big points with horror aficionados when it comes to the special features for ""Halloween II: Collector's Edition."" It's literally packed full of treats and goodies. They include the theatrical version and television cut with extra footage not seen in theaters. Two audio commentaries feature director Rick Rosenthal, actor Leo Rossi and actor / stunt coordinator Dick Warlock talking about the film. Two exciting featurettes give fans more insight into the making of the movie. ""The Nightmare Isn't Over!: The Making of 'Halloween II'"" goes behind the scenes and explores the history of the film. ""Horror's Hallowed Grounds: The Locations of 'Halloween II'"" takes the viewer on a tour of where the movie was filmed. There are also deleted scenes and an alternate ending with commentary for both by Rick Rosenthal. A theatrical trailer, TV and radio spots, and a still gallery are found as well.

The Blu-ray release of ""Halloween II: Collector's Edition"" is a great gift for any fan of the popular franchise. If it was affordable to buy enough of these to drop into the buckets of trick or treaters on All Hallows Eve, you'd be the toast of your neighborhood. I honestly don't know what more they could add to this to improve on it.

Producer Irwin Yablans says he got the idea for a sequel when all the money started pouring in from ""Halloween"" (1978). Yet, when he received the script from John Carpenter and Debra Hill, he hated it! Yablans calls the resulting film utterly ""pedestrian."" He'll get no argument from me there. John Carpenter did not want to direct, preferring to move on to ""The Fog"" and ""Escape From New York."" ""Halloween"" alumni Tommy Wallace, a logical choice to direct the sequel, also hated the script and passed. The job fell to Rick Rosenthal. Carpenter hated Rosenthal's Director's Cut, re-cut it, and shot some more scenes himself. Is it any wonder that, as Tommy Wallace relates, everybody felt ""underwhelmed"" by the prospect of ""Halloween II?"" ""Halloween II"" is actually more adequate than most sequels, but that's really not saying much positive in its favor.
  To be fair, Carpenter and Hill did create a sequel that FEELS and plays like a LOGICAL extension of ""Halloween"". The sequel begins mere MOMENTS after the end of ""Halloween"" (thus, making this particular Halloween night, played out over TWO movies, the longest one in cinema history).  Dr. Loomis  (Donald Pleasence) has shot Michael Myers.  He runs outside to the lawn but the body has vanished. In a deliciously funny bit, the next door neighbor who so obviously ignored Laurie's (Jamie Lee Curtis) screams for help, finally comes out and yells off-camera, ""What is going on? I've been Trick or Treated to death tonight."" Pleasence seriously replies,  ""You don't know what death is!"".
  ""Halloween"" was all about good, honest, horror tension and suspense. With the tension and suspense now gone, ""Halloween II"" has nowhere to go except to fall into the ""Slasher"" category, which it immediately does. Laurie goes to the hospital. Michael follows her there and starts murdering the alternately unaware or sexually-obsessed hospital staff and a few other hapless citizens. Leo Rossi is a hoot as Bud, the arrogant, foul-mouthed EMT who is anxious to have sex with a tardy nurse. The pair actually get it on (while ON DUTY, no less!). Bud is strangled, and the neglectful, very nude, nurse is gruesomely drowned. Billy, a  handsome hospital orderly played by Lance Guest,  is knocked unconscious when he slips on a floor of blood. Now trapped in the hospital and drugged up on IV medications, Jamie Lee Curtis as Laurie is regretfully reduced to a more ""passive victim"" role. Pleasence is obligated to remain several steps behind murderous Myers and spout off exposition we've heard before. Pleasence screams, ""I shot him six times!"" so often it seems like he screams it sixty times.
  ""Halloween II: Collector's Edition"" includes Theatrical and TV Versions of the film, two audio commentaries, and enough additional Extras, to make everything worthwhile.  You are hereby warned: All other ""Halloween"" Sequels, with the possible exception of ""Halloween H20"" should be assiduously avoided, however.",1348531200,4,3453,5.088652482269503
832826,1,6304288433,"Scream Factory drops the ball (pumpkin?) on a long-awaited special edition of Halloween II. The following is a review of the DVD version of Halloween II Collector's Edition released by Scream Factory.

The main reason of this review is to further point out (as a previous reviewer has done) this product's severe audio botch-up on the theatrical version's main audio track. For starters, the audio info described on the back of the slipcase as well as the back cover art is erroneous.  It is not 5.1, but rather something else, which is displayed by my DVD player as 2.0.  Be that as it may, this 2.0 track is disastrous on all fronts.  Loud noises, e.g. gunshots and explosions sound terribly off and unnatural.  Vehicles driving into and out of frame sound as if the soundtrack was replaced by jet airliners taking off.  Two such instances of this are when the two women drive off in the Mustang and the ambulance drives off at the end.  Most inexcusable however, is that the film's musical score sounds altered in the worst way.  It hasn't been replaced, but somehow tweaked to an unacceptable incarnation.  I was not able to bear listening to any significant portion of this audio track while watching the film (neither will anyone else, I imagine).  The bizarre thing is that the audio track played in the background during both commentaries appears to be free from the aforementioned problems.  Why Scream Factory could not use this track as the main track is anybody's guess.

The rest of the package is not without merit however as the video quality is excellent as is the documentary and featurette revisiting shooting locations.  A major plus is the inclusion of the TV version on Disc 2 (the audio track here is fine) featuring the addition of many deleted scenes, most of which can be found on Disc 1 as separate entities with an optional commentary track.  Rounding things out are two decent commentary tracks, a trailer, TV and radio spots, and a still gallery.

Fans of this movie will not be able to part with the 2001 Universal DVD release of this movie since this is what will be used to actually watch and enjoy the movie for all subsequent viewings.  Because the audio track on Scream Factory's disc is unlistenable for the entire run of the movie (due to the crucial musical score being distorted and loud noises sounding off unnaturally), I am unable to rate this product higher than one star since the main feature (the movie itself) is unpresentable.  We waited 10-plus years for a special edition of this movie to come out and we are presented with a film whose audio is unbearable and to some extent unrecognizable to sit through.  The supplemental material exceeds expectations but in the end is attached to a real stinker of a maligned main feature.  Hence this product is now placed on the same pedestal as the problematic Code Red release of Madman: terrific to watch the supplements, inexcusable to watch the actual movie.

Never, under any circumstance, sell off or part with a DVD just because a future special edition DVD is in the works.  Always wait until you have the new edition in your hands and you have had sufficient time to watch and listen to it in full before deciding to let go of previous editions.

UPDATE 10/27/2012: I too have received a replacement disc for Disc 1, and after a thorough listening have determined that the audio all the way through is up to par for 2.0 stereo.  There is good separation in the left and right channels as opposed to the original faulty disc that had an overamplified mono sound with considerable flanger effect.  The replacement disc is flanger free and well worth the hassle of contacting Shout! Factory to procure a replacement disc.  The replacement disc is an actual pressed disc (as opposed to a DVD-R or MOD disc) complete with all the additional special features and is visually identical to the original faulty disc with the exception of a different matrix on the data side.

I will not bump up my rating due to the foreseeable future of subsequent purchasers buying this edition and not realizing the faulty audio and what, if anything, they can do about it since Shout! Factory is not widely acknowledging a faulty pressing anywhere on their website (nor is amazon.com for that matter), especially on the pertinent product info page.  Thus I can envision plenty of fans who will go on with the rest of their movie viewing lives in complete ignorance of this issue.",1348358400,11,4457,4.7322121604139715
832827,3,6304288433,"For those buying the 30th Anniversary blu ray, you are buying the wrong one! The blu ray that was just released is from Shout! Factory that is called COLLECTOR'S EDITION! I see the 30th anniversary on the best sellers, I think people are buying it cause it is cheaper, but it is the wrong one! Buy the Collector's edition!",1348099200,5,322,4.47457627118644
832937,4,6304288433,"Well, I bought the 30th AE from Universal last fall, only to find a lackluster release. The box said perfect picture and purest digital sound available, but that sadly was not the case. The picture was in much need of a full restoration and the audio was merely 5.1 processed (whatever that is) dts. Extras included a few deleted scenes (in 4:3), alternate ending and the boring ""Terror in the Ailses"" (nothing more than a long advertisement for Universal' horror films) theatrically released in '84. Not very impressive extras for a 30th anniversary edition. Thought this was to be the best edition available for some time.
 Well, I happily was wrong thanks to Shout! Factory. One year later comes the collector's edition. And the question is how does it fare in comparison to the previous blu ray release. Let's start with PQ. It is only slightly better, yet still in need of a full restoration. The scene where Jimmy checks on Laurie to find her unresponsive still looks awful (washed out with bad blacks) along with a lot of other night scenes but other, brighter scenes look slightly improved with good color, contrast, and clarity. The AQ is improved with better bass and clearer dialogue in DTS HD MA.
  Now for the extras which are better. The making of doc is cool just wish it had been a little longer and more in depth, original shooting locations seg was funny and slightly interesting, it has deleted scenes/alternate ending (in 4:3) from the 30th AE, but now with director commentary, it has 2 commentaries. One with the director and one with the stuntman who played The Shape. It has tv spots, radio spots, trailer, photo gallery and to top this release off it has the tv version with added footage (namely the deleted scenes/alternate ending) albeit in 4:3, mono, and is not blu ray but a bonus DVD. It's interesting but scenes are in a different order which makes it a little confusing. It would have been really cool if they had done a director cut with the added footage inserted into the theatrical cut but since the added footage seems to only be in 4:3 it wouldn't work.
  All in all, it is a better edition. It is worth the upgrade for fans who love this (the best sequel) and are into extras and improved sound as well as a slightly better picture. Moustapha Akkad's name is there at the opening credits. Until a frame by frame restoration from original negatives and audio track, this is the best it will sound and look. This is the only blu ray presentation that should have been released, forget the 30th AE from Universal. It was simply a mediocre cash grab.",1348099200,5,2586,4.637554585152839
832938,5,6304288433,"Finally, The Halloween II release that fans deserve. This Blu Ray/DVD edition is packed to the rafters with all the extras that we have been desiring. Audio commentary with Director Rick Rosenthal and the man who portrayed the shape, Dick Warlock. Also, a making of documentary, trailer, TV & radio spots, and a very fun feature from Sean Clark's Horror's Hallowed Grounds.

This release also boasts the first time released TV edition of the film, which I'm currently watching. I haven't seen this version of the film in probably 20+ years. It's really like watching a whole new movie.

The packaging for Halloween II is breath taking. The original art work for the cover is fantastic. But, the real treat here is the reversible covers. The opposite side shows the original one sheet and video release art work of the iconic pumpkin skull.

This is by far the most superior release of Halloween II to ever hit the shelves. Worth getting even if you have a copy of this movie already. I currently own 6 copies.(don't judge me, Haha!)

I want to extend my appreciation to Shout! Factory for this masterpiece. They have done an incredible job.",1348012800,8,1140,4.771573604060913
832939,3,6304288433,"I just got my copy of the 30th Anniversary Edition in the mail from Amazon, and I'm noticing that something is really off with the sound on the theatrical cut, because it has a weird 'flanger' effect. If you don't know what that means, do a search for 'flanging' on Wikipedia, and listen to the sample file. This is especially evident with loud sounds, such as gunshots and explosions.

I compared it to the television version on disc 2, and the TV version does sound different. The back of the box says the theatrical cut is Dolby Digital 5.1, while the TV version is Dolby Digital Mono. On the theatrical version, the only audio option (besides the commentary) to choose in the menu is Dolby Digital 2.0, so I don't know what's actually there, since I'm watching the movie on my computer with Creative T40 speakers (2.0 setup).

BTW: This seems to be only affecting the DVD. Supposedly, the blu-ray copy is ok. However, I still wouldn't buy it until/unless the company offers a fix for those who bought their defective DVD.

UPDATE 10/01/2012: Just got the following email from Shout Factory:

-------------------------------------------------------
We apologize for the audio error on the DVD version of Halloween II (Collector's Edition) as this mistake was not intentional. We should have a replacement in the mail for you, in a week. Please provide us with proof of purchase so that we may issue you a replacement disc that has the correct 2.0 Stereo audio as was intended.
-------------------------------------------------------

UPDATE 10/7/2012: Got the replacement disc from Shout Factory and the audio on this one seems fine. Thus, I am updating the review from 1 star to 3. I really can't justify giving this 5 stars, since I'm assuming anybody who buys a retail copy will have to go through the hassle of replacing disc 1, but I appreciate that Shout Factory is doing right by their customers.",1347926400,5,1906,4.906832298136646
832940,5,6304288433,"I just got the new 2disc edition, released by SHOUT Factory which I pre-ordered back in July.
Having already seen the theatrical version countless times, I chose to go straight ahead to the extras....WOW!!!
There's a ""making of"" feature (40 mins approx) incl interviews w/Irwin Yablans, Dir Rick Rosenthal & many of the supporting cast from Halloween II, some of them going into revealing details of their ""death"" scenes. I was already pre-aware that ""The Shape"" was played by Dick Warlock but I didn't know that he was also (on set, simoultaneously) the stunt co-ordinator. So while he was stalking the actors on screen as Michael Myers, behind the scenes he was also responsible for maintaining safety amongst the crew, talk about double-billing! Also included is featurette hosted by (??) some ""Shout factory"" guy visiting locations that were used for the film, even using the camera to duplicate the motions as they appeared in the 1981 original. There is the ""deleted scenes"" segment which can B seen on the television cut (D2). The only downer (minor, IMO)is that the TV cut is in fullscreen, not widescreen.
Lastly, let me add that the audio is MUCH more better than that of the prior UNIVERSAL studio's 2001 1disc widescreen release of Halloween II. The sounds here are BOOMING & Michael's ragged/creepy ""breathing"" is heard more clearly than in the prior version, making it more chilling.
Overall this is an EXCELLENT buy, just in time for the UPcoming Halloween season. Anyone who is a fan of the original Halloween series needs to add this to their collection. It's SUPERIOR to that POS ""Rob Zombie UNrated version"" of Halloween2!!!!",1347926400,6,1644,4.9818181818181815

This movie felt like a continuation of the original and 'to me' was a classic end to the Halloween Movies. I know of the countless sequels, but since JC wasn't involved, I consider them really low budget knock-offs that should never have been made.

Again, to me, this is really were the Halloween movies ended. Anything else was made to cash in on the name without even attempting to come up with anything original in thought or style.",1347840000,2,653,4.572649572649572

Some nurse figures it all out. Donald Pleasance repeats the same lines over and over. Every kid in the movie wears the same Halloween mask as the killer. I didn't know the mask was so popular.

As the tag line states ""More of the Night He Came Home"".  In this outing we learn the reason why Michael Myers is in town.  The movie does have graphic violence (something the original left to your imagination) and its controversial because of the fact that it is rumored that the film was taken away from the director (Rick Rosenthal)  in post production and John Carpenter (The Original Directer of Halloween I) re-shot a few things and added graphic insert shots.

And for the Coup De Grace, a second disc contaning the famed TV Cut with additional/alternate footage (although the R-Rated material is edited out). The TV cut will be on a DVD disc for both format releases.

Now don't start getting rid of your 30th AE just yet!

833028,4,6304288433,"I remember it as vividly as any memory of my youth - I was about 7 years old. I woke up in the middle of the night and went to the kitchen for a glass of water. Instead of drinking it and going directly to bed I sat down with my drink and turned on the TV. It was HBO and a movie was coming on; little did I know it would be Halloween II and that I would remember sitting and watching that movie for the rest of my life. It has been nearly 30 years since that night, but I remember having nightmares about it for weeks after seeing it.

Now that Im an adult and have come to appreciate a good scare, I look back on my first encounter with ""The Shape"" very fondly. Although it is not a masterpiece of cinema (unlike it's predecessor) and won't be seen on any AFI lists, ""Halloween II"" accomplishes what it sets out to do very well - to create an eerie, claustrophobic, scare-a-thon, that leaves its audience gripping the armwrests of their theater seats until the thrilling, climatic conclusion.

A short synopsis would be this: Laurie Strode survives her first encounter with Michael Myers and is transported to Haddonfield Memorial Hospital where she must endure one more epic struggle with the immortal serial killer in the dark corridors of the nearly abandoned hospital before her nightmare will finally come to an end.

'Halloween II' is not a methodically paced, psychological thriller; as opposed to a true horror film like the original John Carpenter classic - it is, in fact, almost the antithesis to the original with lots of blood and gore, but therein lies the genius of the film. Where the original played to frighten you psychologically by lurking in the darkness, the 2nd film tries to scare the hell out of you with everything up close and personal, and it succeeds brilliantly. A fantastic horror film!",1338768000,5,1819,4.539634146341464
833029,4,6304288433,"I am a fan of the Halloween franchise, good, bad or indifferent.  Every one of the movies have their strong points, even the infamous Halloween III and The Curse of Michael Myers.  The remakes are fine too, incredibly violent and warped as they may be.  I won't waste time talking about the movie.  There's plenty of reviews doing that.

The Blu Ray is a very clean visual transfer for as old as the source material is.  In some ways it's a little too clean with the color enhancement, as you lose some of the ""autumn midwest"" feel for the plush green Los Angeles reality in a few scenes.  Otherwise it's a beautiful transfer with only a few minor blemishes here and there.  Overall the best visuals of any previous Halloween II release.

The opening credits looked a little different for some reason, but I can't place my finger on it.  I'll have to watch my Universal DVD again to find out for sure.

Interestingly, the sound is somewhat inferior to the Universal DVD.  Sure, it's as crisp and clean a sound as could be expected for a movie this old, but it seems to be toned down a little more than on the DVD.  For instance, the barking doberman early in the film and the late-for-work nurse knocking on the glass hospital door did not make my heart skip a few beats as on the DVD.  If you're expecting it, the DVD really makes no difference.  But if you're distracted, the DVD definitely wakes you up on these kinds of scenes, whereas the Blu Ray is not as likely to get your attention.  The sound is a little flatter in my opinion.

Sadly, the deleted scenes are located elsewhere on the disc.  They are not enhanced for 1080p like the feature presentation, but still clean despite the noticeable grain.  They are not presented in their original 2.35:1 aspect ratio.  Instead, they are offered only in the cropped full-screen television format.  The alternate ending is not included in the deleted scenes menu, though it does appear as a secondary menu option.

In my opinion the ultimate Halloween II Blu Ray edition would have the deleted scenes added back into the main feature but without the alternate ending.  Perhaps yet another version will be released with these changes.  I would definitely pay for another copy of this movie.  After all, I have at least 4 Anchor Bay releases of Halloween, including the unrated Extended Edition.  Now they did that one right: the original R-rated version (brief nudity and all) with the made for TV scenes (2.35:1 retro ""1978"" scenes that were shot during the filming of Halloween II in 1981) spliced in; not a true TV version but certainly a perfect extended version.  Why couldn't they do the same for this one?  They still can.  I'll eagerly await it.

As for the other extras, I have no idea why they added Terror in the Isles as an extra but it's not a bad piece of work.  I would much rather have seen original TV commercial spots, heard radio clips, and seen a ""making of"" documentary or at least some behind the scenes photo stills.

My conclusion: the Blu Ray is definitely worth the price.  No overt disappointments.  Alas, I want another release as described above.  Until then, I'll hang onto my Blu Ray and my Universal DVD.  I'll also snag an old copy of the Good Times Video DVD release.  I love the cool moving/live action video clips on the chapter menus.  Those should have been carried over to Blu Ray as well.

Anyway, both HALLOWEEN and HALLOWEEN II have their moments and still pack a punch as a terror flick.

The HALLOWEEN II Blu-Ray is pretty decent but there is some picture noise in the darker scenes that take place inside the hospital, which is the only fault that I can find. The rest of the picture is sharp and detailed and, aside from outfits and hairstyles, looks as though it were shot yesterday.

The Blu-Ray has some special features like deleted scenes and a bonus movie, although I would've liked a present day interview with Jamie Lee Curtis.

*****  BONUS FEATURES  *****

* Alternate Ending & Deleted Scenes - 08:01-minutes -- ""play all"" button
There was one scene that should've been left in the movie that explains why the hospital is so dark. As is, the hospital just suddenly goes dark, particularly in the corridors and hallways, and I always thought that maybe the lights were turned off to let the patients sleep, but that doesn't make sense because the patients aren't in the hallways, LOL. Anyway, this one scene explains it.

* Documentary Movie ""Terror In The Aisle"" - 01-hour:22-minutes

The deleted scenes were a nice feature as well as the addition of ""terror in the aisles"". Don't expect to be blown away by the picture quality just because it's Blu Ray. Just expect to see the movie and remember why you got hooked in the first place.",1320537600,2,529,4.3979591836734695
833151,2,6304288433,"This flick doesn't hold up as well as it did thirty years ago.  Back when I was an impressionable undiscrimanating seventeen year old the body count was good enough for me.  It was also pretty cool watching it with an urban audience who shouted at the screen imploring in vain for the victims not to open door or closet.  Now it's no better or worse than any knockoff of the classic original ""Halloween"".  Events take place on the same evening as the original but it's more preposterous.  They open things up by having the action set mainly at a hospital but that makes it more ludicrous.  This has to be the darkest most sparcely staffed hospital I've ever seen.  Donald Pleasence and Jamie Lee Curtis reprise their roles from the original but that only adds so much cred.  Proceed if you must but be prepared to be disappointed",1319846400,4,829,4.554054054054054
833152,3,6304288433,"Halloween II is merely ""OK.""  Far better than any sequel that came after it, and inferior to the John Carpenter classic.  The style and tension of the first movie has been replaced with a ""Jason-esque"" slasher rampage flick that dominated 80's horror.  When I was a kid, I liked this movie a lot.  But re-visiting it again as an adult, I was somewhat bored by it.  Working at a hospital myself, I found it hard to believe that the Haddonfield hospital was virtually empty (even the nursery!).  Having most of the film set at this location was a pretty bad idea.  Having a stuntman and not an actor portraying Michael Myers was another one.  My guess is that John Carpenter and Debra Hill were so busy with ""Escape From New York"" that they put very little thought into the story.  They just wanted to catch a ride on that money train.  Listen to the audio commentary on the original ""Halloween"" and Carpenter himself admits this movie is a disappointment.

That being said, the blu ray picture is quite good, and the soundtrack sounds great.  The inclusion of ""Terror in the Aisles"", another movie I liked as a kid, makes it worthwhile.  That is the only reason I decided to purchase this.  Just as with ""Halloween II"", when the eventual blu-ray of ""Halloween III"" comes out, they're going to have to include something else to get me to bite (perhaps the original soundtrack on CD?).",1319587200,4,1382,4.610655737704918
833153,3,6304288433,"I've had a love/hate relationship with this movie ever since I first saw it in the theater as a kid.  It's one of those sequels that justifies the common assertion that sequels are always inferior to the ""originals"".  I do not expound that philosophy because, like the hypocrites that do, I have always bought a ticket to see sequels of favorite movies out of natural curiosity.

Yes, ""Halloween II"" is not as good as the original.  Yes, it plays like a ""Friday the 13th"" sequel.  Yes, stuntman Dick Warlock (and all those who followed) is a poor replacement for Nick Castle and the grace he brought to the figure of Michael Myers.  Yes, the cast is populated with unappealing characters.  Yes, the death-by-boiling-her-head had already been done in Dario Argento's ""Deep Red"".  Yes, the Michael Myers mask is different (though I am weirdly fascinated by the varied masks in each of the sequels).  Yes, Dr. Loomis (Donald Pleasence) shouts repeatedly that he shot Michael six times when in fact there are SEVEN gunshots at the beginning of the movie!  A neat trick for a revolver.

We fans of John Carpenter's ""Halloween"" couldn't help but yearn for a sequel.  The result could have been quite worse but it's unlikely that it could have been better.  Jamie Lee Curtis is to be commended for making the most out of this weak material while wearing a bad wig.  Donald Pleasence has always been fun but never more so than when his Dr. Loomis recites his Myers soliloquies as he stares off into space and the music comes up.  I love that!  Dr. Loomis' colleague (Nancy Stephens) returns as does Charles Cyphers as the sheriff and Nancy Loomis reprises her role... dead on a gurney!

On a positive note, this is not one of those sequels that is so awful that watching it ruins one's appreciation for the original.  How's that for a recommendation?

As for the blu-ray, it's fine, I guess (with the exception of the removal of ""Moustapha Akkad Presents"" from the opening credits).  But I would still like to know the whole story behind the rumored production woes and Carpenter's intervention.

""Halloween III: Season of The Witch"", silly as it may be, is a more entertaining movie and I lament that it was not successful enough to spawn a series of annual Halloween movies with different stories instead of the same ol' generic slasher stuff above which the Michael Myers sequels could not rise.  I eagerly await the blu-ray release of ""Halloween III"".

One final note, all the carnage Michael Myers inflicts upon his victims should be served up to the a**holes who rigged this blu-ray so that I have to sit through myriad previews and nonsense each time I stop it instead of returning to where I left off.",1319241600,5,2701,4.712153518123667

They do not seem to reappear after the opening credits, however. This is also the first film I have rented through Amazon Instant Video and I was very satisfied with the quality.

As shes walking in late and he buzzes her in he stops her and gives her his own unique perspective on the killings in the neighborhood. and michael got cut himself in a small but poignant  scene not included, when he finds lauries room and walks towards her, scalpel in hand, he starts stabbing away at what he thinks is laurie but she hides the pillows under the covers, we all know that. well before michael walks out of the room he grabs the pillows and violently jerks them across the room then he walks out. its nothing yes but i would of love for that scene to be put back in. I bought this bluray hoping and praying that all this would be put back in the film seeing this is the 30th anniversary issue but such is not the case. all except those two scenes are back in the disks deleted scenes. oh well, the blu ray is still a real TREAT and i recommend it highly. the picture is so much sharper and john carpenter and alan howarths score is soooo extremely powerful in full dts 5.1 master audio. i recommend one really crank it up to get the full effect. that alone is worth the price of this bluray. so many years weve heard it thru just 2.0 dolby surround. it substitutes for no commentary track by director rick rosenthal who went on to do BAD BOYS with sean penn and came back to do HALLOWEEN RESSURECTION with jamie and no featurettes sadly but again oh well.

Im not sure what sorce universal used for the transfer but it could have been better. Look its a catalog title I know, and this will probably be the only release for this movie on blu ray but universal could have took their time on this one. Now what the disc does include is the terror in the aisles feature movie that has only been realsed on vhs in the past. This is aside from the film, the real jem on the disc.

833159,4,6304288433,"Growing up, this was the first Halloween I ever saw. At the time, I was 7. I didn't know about sequels, so I thought this was the beginning and I didn't know why Michael was killing everyone in the hospital. But it sure got to me. I think the dark, creepy-ass, nearly-deserted hospital did it for me because we've all been to a hospital and they usually make us uneasy to begin with. I've seen the movie about 100 times since it's first releases on VHS and DVD. This one is the best.

First, let me explain that I do not own a 60-inch Plasma with a 7.1 Surround Sound Home Theater System. I own a 37-inch LCD HDTV and a Sony Blu Player. I did watch this twice, first on HDMI input and second on Component. Sharpness was just about the same. The HDMI enriches the color, almost too much sometimes and adds a lot of oranges and reds. There is some grain in different spots throughout the movie, but it depends on the lighting. It got kind of hazy during Laurie and Jimmy's talks in her hospital room, as well as the end in the operating room. A few scratches and dots here and there, but hey it's a 30-year-old print. Overall, though, the picture was a great improvement over the DVD. Again, this all depends on what kind of monitor you use. HD does sharpen all of the flaws, as well, but they're magnified even further when you use a giant screen. Even on a TV, you can tell the difference between the different audio streams offered. The Dolby 2.0 sounded kind of hollow with a little bit of tin in it. The Dolby 5.1 sounded fuller.

And lastly, we finally get some extras for Halloween II! There are about 8 deleted scenes. Don't get your hopes up if you're looking for uncut gore. It's all character developement. Some of it's the hospital staff, and some of it's Loomis with the police. Laurie getting checked over after they sedate her (that's where the title of my review comes from). There's a lot of Jimmy talking, or least trying, to talk to Laurie. Some stuff between the nurses. And a few drunk Dr. Mixture scenes before he goes to ""watch the fish"" in his office. There's also the Happy Alternate Ending. I think I saw this on TV awhile back, because I remembered it perfectly. It kind of confirms what was already insinuated in Part 4. The biggest bonus on this disc is Terror in the Aisles! Full Widescreen HD, with great sound and subtitles. I watched this on satellite about a week ago and this blows it away. Sure, there are some bad spots from the old clips, but even a lot of them look great on here.

My biggest gripe with this disc is some things that Universal did to it. Yes, they removed Moustapha Akkad from the credits and changed the font. They also jacked up the menu. I love seeing the pumpkin split open and the skull hidden inside. But, they added a BD-Live pop-up add on the menu! If you're connected to the internet while it's on, it cycles ads for Universal content right there on your DVD Menu! They also added some kind of funky built-in screensaver to their discs. If you pause for too long, it overrides your player's built-in screensaver and you get one that says Univeral. It looks cool, but you can't just hit Play and turn it off. I couldn't get mine to turn off, so I stopped the disc and had to find my spot again. With a little research, I found out that you have to hit ENTER on your remote for it to resume your playback. I hate that sort of thing.

All gripes aside, you can't go wrong buying this disc. I got mine on sale for $9.99 right here on Amazon, but it's back up some now. It's worth the purchase, so you can relive some of the greatest horror moments from your past.",1316649600,4,3622,4.31424375917768

The extras Suck!!!!
the deleted scenes, and Alt. Ending have been  around for some time
They throw

833251,4,6304288433,"Let me start off by stating that I'm going to discuss the movie itself, this new Blu-ray release and the recent Universal controversy.

This isn't the best movie made, not even the best sequel but by far the best Halloween sequel next to H20. The story picks up right where the original left off. We're introduced to the very understaffed Haddonfield Memorial Hospital as Laurie makes her stay to be stitched up and to recuperate from her wounds that night. Meanwhile Michael stalks the streets of Haddonfield, his childhood hometown, on his search for Laurie. The always faithful Dr. Loomis is on the prowl for Michael once more trying to stop his patient from hell and facing the subsequent guilt of ""letting him out"" again to wreak more havoc. That's all I can say as to not give the movie away and to spoil it for you newcomers (but really, it's been out 30 years, maybe you shouldn't be reading the reviews if you haven't seen it yet).

The movie ups the ante on gore and nudity to compete with the other early 80s grand-daddy era of slasher films. But this movie does it with a bit more class. There's only one scene in particular that's necessarily disturbing. I'll just say it's ""scalding"". The characters are more or less fleshed out, or as fleshed out as they can be in the slasher genre and that's due in large part to John Carpenter and Debra Hill writing the film. I wouldn't say it's the best character development but it could be much worse. Hindsight is 20/20 afterall.

The Blu-ray is great. It's an upgrade from DVD by far. A lot of people seem to take issue with the white specks but I think it's not over-bearing and it's not that noticable in my opinion. I'm glad that DNR wasn't involved. I've come to appreciate film grain. The original Halloween looks fantastic on Blu-ray and this film doesn't look bad at all. To be honest I wasn't expecting Universal to put any care into it at all especially since it's a catalog title. The extras are nice, sure the deleted scenes and alternate ending is in full screen and they're not in HD but they look as close to HD as you're going to get. They didn't include all of the deleted scenes from the tv cut but I think they included the best scenes in my opinion. Terror In The Aisles, that alone sold me. I knew I had to pick this Blu-ray up. It could've just included this and no deleted scenes at all and I'd be happy. It looks great as well. And yes it's the full theatrical movie hosted by Donald Pleasance and Nancy Allen. My only gripe about the release is the cover. I prefer the original art. But that's a very meager and minor complaint on my end.

Now to the Universal controversy...I don't know what to say. Was it wrong of Universal to take Moustapha Akkad's credit away? Yeah, I'm sure they have their reasons (albeit probably moronic or lame) but I don't think an exchange with the corrected ""Moustapha Akkad Presents"" instead of ""Universal Presents"" title card is going to prompt many fans to exchange their copies for the corrected one. Unless Universal includes more deleted scenes or adds a documentary or commentary (doubtful) I don't think many fans are going to care that much with the exception of the hardcore fans that are anal about it. It's not enough to make my blood boil but I understand the frustration. We all want credit where it's due. And it's nice to see that Universal has acknowledged their mistake (as if they didn't know). Either Universal is very smart or very stupid. Because they know a good number of fans would just buy the corrected version and keep the ""mistake"" too for completist reasons and make even more money or they just don't care which would make them stupid.

All in all I'm happy. I've waited all year for this release and with my luck as usual it didn't go off without a hitch but I'm grateful for what I've got. This release exceeded my expectations.

Edit, as of today June 4th 2012 I've since sent my disc in for the replacement Blu-ray back in February. Akkad's credit was restored and now there's HD lossless audio. Also, Shout! Factory just announced that they secured the rights for this film and 'Halloween III' and 'They Live' among others. And here's what it offers:

833252,3,6304288433,"As many have metioned, if you know Halloween 2 1981, (NOT the insane Crappy Rob Zombie mess)then there is no need to talk about the movie itself,  All die-hard fans of the franchise adore this flick.  Now on the the PQ,Audio and Special features review.

As most Halloween die-hards, were hoping for a bit more here. Granted the PQ is a slight upgrade over the DVD, it is a wonder why Universal couldn't take some time to remaster the transfer with a bit more time.  I am sure it is pretty easy to remove scartches/dirt from the negative so we don't get white specks all over the screen every 1/2 second (it's like watching a VHS with tracking issues.  In one sceen where Lance Guest is talking with Stroid in her room there was a bunch of grain on the wall and the image became so unsharp it was horrible.  The audio was a great improvment, but why processed 5.1 DTS, this is Blu-ray, which can handle loseless audio, which seems to defeat the purpose on putting this out on BR.  I can see 2.0 DTS and a lossless 5.1, to give the fans a closer to the theatrical edition.  I think the loseless would've given the sountrack a bit more punch.  So if you your going to boast a 3oth Anv. edition, than make the transfer PQ and audio a 30th upgrade.  The picture could've been much much cleaner and sharper, I know this was shot analog, but if star wars can look this good from 1977 then 1980 halloween should atleast be much improved.

The special featurse are much more by comparison to the DVD, but again a 30th Anv. should have more thought behind the specal features, thats why there called (SPECIAL FEATURES).  We got Deleted scenes IE addtional TV scenes added due to deleted stuff that cannot air on TV. I understand not widescreen, since they were set for 4x3 tv's and quality is not bad, I was just hoping they would include the Rick Rosenthal cut in hidef or the R rated verson with the TV scenes added.  Who cares about Terror In The Aisles, that could've been issued by itself.  How about some Documentries, how about a doc called Halloween 2 30 years later, with current innerviwes with cast that are availble, with a count from the director and crew with a detailed malking, how about even a trailer more stuff that had to do with halloween 2.  I even thought the cover art was bad, I like the Pumkin, with the old logo and said more of the night he came home.  Universal could've find some stuff in the vaults.  Surely 30 years could of produced more.  I hear Halloween 3 is due next for hidef, I hope they give us more than just a catilogue tittle.  As we always wish for more, maybe these studio excecs. would read fans message boards or give us an oppurtunity to voice our opinions before they put together stuff, I guess they wouldn't be able to double and triple dip tittles.  Just my thoughts.

833253,4,6304288433,"OK, there are currently over 400 reviews telling you how good or bad ""Halloween II"" is.  Chances are, if you're reading this, you already have your own opinion of the film itself and want to know about the Blu-ray.  The transfer is quite good, although not perfect.  Unlike the 1978 original film, this one takes place all in one night.  And some of the scenes are pretty dark.  Still, it's probably the best the film will ever look on the home screen, so I'm reasonably satisfied with the picture quality.  Unfortunately, the sound suffers a malady common to too many discs: You have to really jack it up to hear people talk at times, only to have your walls shaken by a sudden sting of music during a scary moment.

The real treat that no one seem to be talking about, however, is the bonus feature film included.  ""Terror in the Aisles"" was a theatrical release way back in 1983.  The Universal-produced feature is a compilation of scary moments from films from the 50's through the early 80's.  Co-hosts and frequent genre stars Donald Pleasance and Nancy Allen not only narrate, but sit in a crowded theater watching the film clips.  The theater scenes are generally a bit cheesy, but not really out of line with the often irreverent tone of the film.  I remember watching this one in the theater back in the day, and I'm delighted to finally have a copy.  As far as I know, it was previously only available on a long out-of-print VHS tape.

If you're a fan of the movie, this is certainly a must-have (especially at the current low price).  But even folks who are just fans of horror cinema in general should pick it up for Terror in the Aisles.  Aside from the aforementioned technical deficits, it's a welcome addition to my Blu-ray collection.",1316217600,6,1752,4.5673076923076925
833254,5,6304288433,"I'm no expert on transfers considering I'm new to the blu-ray world, but the picture looks fine and the audio seems excellent. The alternate ending is the one used on the television version from the 80's and 90's. There are about 6 or 7 deleted/alternate scenes that are pretty much character bits that extend the plot. No additions to the kill scenes as most of these scenes take place in the first half of the movie.
  The ""Terror in the Aisles"" documentary is okay, but it's little more than a collage of films from the Halloween 2 era. It's broken up into subject chapters, but more audience reactions than types of horror movies.
  Overall it was well worth $13 and I'm not complaining about the look and sound. It's probably hard to get a great transfer from a 30-year-old flick without painstaking hours and years to work on it.",1316131200,3,835,4.583892617449664
833255,3,6304288433,going to be short first of all i have the original 2003 standard release of this  halloween and it is a better  quality transfer without the white specks and grain throughout. but this maybe the best possible negative in the vault from what i have heard is the previous copies were lost and the colors are remarkable and bright. being this is a 30th anniversary edition  the original 1978 carpenter classic i have and it is beautiful. so i give this 3 out of  five for transfer the rest is a five star  classic.,1315958400,2,511,4.3936170212765955

are white specks of dust that appear quite often, the blacks look muddy, and many shots appear soft, while the rest
in the scene are crisp. This was not the way it was on the DVD release. I was really looking forward to an excellent transfer,
like that of The Exorcist on blu-ray, simply because all of the more recent films I have on Universal blu-ray look
fantastic, and I figured they would take their time in restoring this classic film. Unfortunately, this is not the case.

They have also added an extra title credit during the opening credits of the film. It states that it is an MCA Universal
release, however I have never seen this title credit on any other release of Halloween 2, and the font is not the same
typical 'Halloween' font the rest of the opening credits are in. It immediately threw me off.

The deleted scenes in the special features are not in widescreen, they are in the 1.33:1 aspect ratio, which is unfortunate,
because the film itself does a fantastic job of utilizing the 2.35:1 ratio like the original did.

Having Terror in the Aisles in quite nice, but I would have preferred to see more Halloween 2 related special features.

Overall, I rate the 30th anniversary blu-ray of Halloween 2 as follows:
PICTURE : *** / out of *****
SOUND: **** / out of *****
BONUS FEATURES: **** / out of *****

The film itself is a classic sequel, and I am glad to have updated it to blu-ray since I am an avid Halloween fan, even if I was a bit disappointed.",1315872000,4,1596,4.414965986394558
833257,5,6304288433,"Okay, this is a fantastic blu ray transfer.  The images are crisp, clear and sharp. The audio is awesome.  It doesn't get much better than this.

The plot is that Halloween 2  picks up right where Halloween leaves off. I mean, the exact second. Laurie is transported to the hospital, and Michael is right behind her.  He pretty much kills off everyone that's between him and her. The question is why is Michael targeting Laurie? What makes her so special? Ahhh....what a great question. In this installment, you find out why he's after her.  I also liked the symbolism in it, that happens at the end.  I can't say what it is, because it would be a spoiler.

There is a note of caution to Halloween 2. It's much more violent and graphic that the original, way more.  I can promise that a couple of scenes will make you jump.  :O)

As far as sequels go, this is nothing but a classic. If you've seen the first Halloween, and were thinking of getting this in blu ray, then I suggest it. I've seen it several times, and couldn't wait to get it in blu ray.",1315872000,3,1051,4.338461538461538
833258,5,6304288433,"I love the fact that this movie takes up where the first one ends, but to me, the main selling point of this movie is the intro. It starts off with the same themesong as the first one, only the sound is synthesized and has a harsher ""bite"" to it. All the while this music is playing and the credits appear, there is an ominous pumpkin on the screen. The camera gets closer and closer to the pumpkin and when its very close, the pumpkin cracks open and there is a death mask inside with cobwebs all over it. This has to be the best/creepiest introduction to a horror movie that I have ever seen. Even if i didn't like the movie, i think i would still buy it just for the intro......I am curious though as to the connection between this movie and the song, ""Mr. Sandman""....the song is about a girl who is asking Mr. Sandman to bring her the ""perfect boyfriend""....what possible connection could there be between that song and Halloween?",1315526400,4,935,4.379310344827586

This sequel does what every sequel should do...add a little more to the history/background without fleshing out the aggressor to the point of total understanding.  The pace is just right and there is not the over kill of blood and guts.  There is not as much suspense in this movie as the first film, but I do not believe it was meant to have it.  Dick Warlock plays Michael Myers perfectly.  Everything has been said already about the late Donald Pleasence role in the film, one word - ""AWESOME"".  This film is definite ""must have"" for the Halloween series fan, and it is a great addition to the franchise.  I am glad it will be coming to Blu-ray, as others have stated in these reviews...I have been wanting a better/updated copy since my $5.00 copy I bought ""back in the day"" from a used dvd store.  The music in this sequel is updated some from the first film but is still excellent and gives the eeriness of know that something is going to happen, you just not sure exactly when...
All in all, a great horror sequel which helped the series move along and set the pathway for parts 4 and 5, and gives some closure to the first film.  Hopefully in the near future Halloween 4 & 5 will get the same Blu-ray treatment...",1314576000,2,1456,4.4232209737827715

Michael Myers continues to hunt Laurie, as Dr. Loomis finds out a very disturbing secrect about Michael's connection to Laurie.  This has never really gotten a proper DVD release, and I'm so happy that it's finally coming to blu ray.  Any new transfer of the movie has to be better than what's out there now.

833345,2,6304288433,"Despite the involvement of John Carpenter (who REFUSED to direct the film -- he probably knew even he couldn't save it), this film is yet another brainless, run of the mill slasher film. While the first film managed to create suspense, get you involved with the characters, and had an exciting climatic battle, the only thing that saves this sequel from being at the bottom of the barrel is Donald Pleasance.  Since this film takes place immediately after the first film, those with short attention spans won't have to worry about things like a script that tries to build up to the conflict.  But of course the same thing can be said about the dreadful Friday the 13th remake, and I doubt very many people (even those with no attention span) would recommend that turkey.  Instead you get Michael Meyers shambling around killing one stereotypical teen after another.  As Roger Ebert (a fan of the first film notes) this sequel begins the trend in this series of plots that require all the victims to be absolute morons.  With the exception of the original film, Halloween 3 (an underrated film which has nothing to do with Michael Meyers) or the Rob Zombie films (which are highly flawed -- particularly in their running time -- but at least show intelligence, creativity and have great visuals), it is best to avoid any film in the Halloween franchise.  John Carpenter meant for each film to be unique, and for Meyers to never return.  Instead we got stuck with ever increasing suckiness.  I recommend enjoying the original and experience Michael Meyers as the very human but very menacing character he was in the first film instead of the dull, uninteresting, shambling immortal dependent upon stupid, stupid victims the awful sequels turned him into.",1310169600,3,1752,4.855704697986577

But...Haloween,the first one.did it for me.as for the sequals. H2 is my pick among the myers franchise. Now on to H3. I know im gonna get hate mail for this one.

833471,4,6304288433,"Halloween 2 is a solid sequel to the 1978 horror classic Halloween directed by horror legend John Carpenter. Some sequels of the horror genre especially during the 80's failed desperatley compared to the epic original as we saw with the The Excorcist 2, but that is not the case here.

Even though Halloween 2 wasn't released till 1981; 3 years after the original this movie is supposed to be a continuation of the 1st. It takes place later on the same night as the original. Babysitter, Laurie Strode ( Jamie Lee Curtis ) is rushed to the hospital and treated for the injuries she recieved in her first encounter with Micheal.

Micheal, who mysteriously dissapeared after being shot off the balcony by Dr. Loomis ( Donald Pleasence ) continues after Laurie tracing her to the Haddonfield Memorial Hospital and doing a few classic Halloween style stalk and slash routines along the way with the now even more obsessed Dr. Loomis trying to track him down.

Halloween 2 uses the slow building tension and suspense from the first film, and adds in the gore, blood, and unique more explicite kills that the first movie lacked. It also reveals the back story of Micheal being Laurie's brother which was a good, well explained twist for the movie. Also, the large seemingly empty hospital filled with unsuspecting nurses and poor traumatized Laurie teamed with the original bone chilling music from the first adds to the movie's suspense and chill factor. Jamie Lee Curtis delivers another excellent performance proving that she can do more than just scream and run in the numerous first rate and nail biting chase scenes this movie provides but that she can also act, alot better than most other actresses of the 80's slasher genre.

The movie is well paced and well directed by Rick Rosenthal..good from beginning to end, and in the shadow of a legend a worthy sequel and an all around good slasher flick.",1143244800,8,1901,4.804281345565749

HE'S BAAAAAACK

Michael Myers returns to reek havoc on teens every where, and Jamie Lee Curtis is at the top of his menu. Of course Donald Pleasence is still on the hunt for the serial killer, and this film will be the one to leave a Permanente mark on him. When viewing this film it is easy to see that even though the film is good it just isn't the classic the first movie was. The thing that might be the answer to that is probably because a different director steps up, Rick Rosenthal. Don't get me wrong he does an excellent job but he's the having to follow up behind John Carpenter. Speaking of which John and Debra Hill {R.I.P.} return as both producers, and writers. Which pleased me greatly.

The story follows as such, it picks up directly where the last left off with Myers being shot out of the house then not being there. Michael is after Jamie again and to get there he has to visit the hospital. Of course it's the same slasher thing, Horney people getting cut up, nothing new. But it still serves its purpose when Michael lurks from the shadows in one scene where his mask slowly comes forward. That was great, truly worthy of mention.

Over all this is a worthy sequel all though at times it falls flat.",1132185600,,1233,4.352173913043479

Sensational sequel to the classic horror film is equally as scary, and even a bit darker and violent than its predecessor. Once again, performances are top-notch, screenplay is excellent, music is adapted from the original score for synth and is terrifying, and the direction by Rick Rosenthal is terrific. Possibly the best horror movie sequel ever made, HALLOWEEN II's star rating is brought down to a four because of an unnecessary slow pace at times. But it is hardly noticeable because the rest of the film is so scary and great.",1127001600,,755,4.8604651162790695

833542,5,6304288433,"John Carpenter's HALLOWEEN scared millions of people back in 1978. It was filmed on $300,000 budget in the course of three weeks in the Spring of 1978. But in 1981, director Rick Rosenthal, with the help of original HALLOWEEN producers, John Carpenter (director of the first film) & Debra Hill, brought us HALLOWEEN 2.

  Filmed in 1981, but picking up on October 31st, 1978, where LAURIE STRODE (again played by Jamie Lee Curtis) has been rescued by DR. SAM LOOMIS (again played by Donald Pleasance), Michael gets up on walks away, for he has not yet finished, nor will he ever be finished, his business in Haddonfield. Laurie is found by the police and ambulance and is taken to safety at the Haddonfield Hospital to be treated for her stab wounds and fractured ankle.

  MICHAEL MYERS (played by Dick Warlock) is still at large. He wanders into the Elrod's place, steals a kitchen knife and goes on his way. But his blood left on the cutting board scares the hell out of Mrs. Elrod, causing her to scream in front. ALICE (played by Anne Bruner), The Elrod's next-door neighbor, comes out, concerned, but realizes that it is probably nothing major, but in Alice's case, it is, since Michael appears kills her off.

  Earlier, Laurie was taken to the hospital by two paramedics named BUD (played by Leo Rossi) and JIMMY (played by Lance Guest), who is the older brother of one of Laurie's classmates. At the hospital, DR. FREDRICK MIXTER (played by FORD RAINY) requires that she be put under the gas for rest, but Laurie is so terrified that she does not want to sleep, but the Dr. goes against her wishes.

  Dr. Loomis has already caught up with SHERIFF LEIGH BRACKETT (again played by Charles Cyphers). They search the whole neighborhood for Michael. They found a supposed Michael Myers. As they chase him, Michael walks into the street, where is he rammed by a police car and slammed into a truck, where he and the truck explodes. The guy in Myers' mask was not Michael Myers. At that moment, DEPUTY HUNT (played by Hunter Von Leer) drives up and tells Brackett about the three kids murdered in Lindsey Wallace's house, and reveals that one of them is Annie, Leigh's daughter, and Laurie's best friend. They pull up, and Brackett looks at his daughter one last time, and storms off, pissed at Loomis for supposedly letting Michael escape, in which, Dr. Loomis hadn't done so. Hunt decides to help Dr. Loomis out in this ordeal.

  Awhile later, Jimmy is talking to Laurie about what happened. He reveals that the guy trying to kill her tonight was Michael Myers. She is shocked to learn this, since she has heard about Michael killing his older sister 15 years earlier. She realizes that she last heard that he was locked up, but Jimmy tells Laurie that Michael did escape.

  Awhile later, Bud and his girlfriend, KAREN (played by Pamela Susan Shoop), a nurse on the maternity floor, are in the physical therapy tub, but Bud gets out to check the temperature, after Michael had turned up to the hottest temp. There, Michael strangles Bud, but Karen doesn't hear a thing. Michael walks in and drowns Karen in the burning hot water.

  Dr. Loomis and Hunt find out that the guy blown up earlier was definitely not Michael, but a 17-year-old boy named, Bennett Tramer. They continue their quest for Michael, until MARION CHAMBERS (again played by Nancy Stephens), the nurse who was with Dr. Loomis last night, arrives to tell him that the governor of Smith's Grove has ordered Loomis back to Smith's Grove. Dr. Loomis and Marion walk out to the car, where a marshal will drive them along. He asks Hunt to continue the search.

  At the Hospital, Laurie escapes her hospital room, sending Jimmy and JILL (played by TAWNY MOYER), who is the hospital's receptionist, on the hunt for Laurie. While searching for Laurie, Jimmy finds MRS. ALVES (played by Gloria Gifford), the head nurse, dead. Jimmy trips and cracks his head open.

  Jill tries to leave, but can't since every cars' tires are flat. She enters the hospital and finds Laurie walking around, where Laurie witnesses Michael kill Jill. Laurie runs down into the basement, finding the security guard, MR. GARRETT (played by Cliff Emmich) dead. Michael finds her, but Laurie gets on the elevator, leaves the hospital and hides in the car.

  Back with Dr. Loomis and Marion, Marion reveals to Dr. Loomis that Laurie Strode is actually, Michael Myers' younger sister. Laurie was born two years before Michael murdered Judith. Two years after his crime, after their parents died, Laurie was adopted by the Strode's. They had requested that this piece of evidence be sealed to protect the family. Dr. Loomis orders the marshal to turn around, in which he does.

  Laurie exits the car after seeing Michael again. She runs up to the Hospital door and tries to open it, but it's locked. Dr. Loomis lets her in. He shoots Michael again, but he kills the Marshall and chases Laurie and Loomis, as Marion calls for backup. They enter a gas room, where Laurie shoots Michael's eyes. Dr. Loomis tells Laurie to get out of there, as he turns on gas tanks and blows up the room, burning Michael. Laurie has done it again.

  This film is just as scary as the first film and very enjoyable. Jamie Lee Curtis will always be the original Scream Queen. Her screams sound just as great as they did in the original, but I feel as though, hearing scream for the first time in the original will always be the best. This is a worthy follow-up to John Carpenter's original horror masterpiece.",1117411200,,5529,4.699170124481328

There are several deleted/extnded/and alternate scenes inclding an alternate ending.  Trust me, it is because I have it.  There are several.  I also have the TV version of the original.  The plot continues right where the first film left off.  Michael Myers escapes and Laurie is taken to the hospital and Michael follows her.  Dr. Loomis along with Sheriff Brackett and one of his Officers are tracking Michael.  Michael does some surgery on the staff of the hospital.  Michael catches up to Laurie and tries to kill her.  Dr. Loomis comes to her rescue and in an explosive finale Loomis tells Laurie to leave the room as Loomis blows it up!!!!  If you've seen it on tape you know how it ends.  We see Michael Burning.  If you haven't seen the  TV version I'm not gonna spoil it by telling you the alternate ending.  Sorry!!!!!!  I like ""Halloween"" and ""Halloween 2"" excatly the same.  They're both awesome.  They both have an excellent plot.  I think they're alot better than ""Halloween 4"", and ""Halloween 5"".  Don't get me wrong I like 4 & 5 also, but I think 1 & 2 are a hell of alot better.

833545,4,6304288433,"John Carpenter's_Halloween II overall is an excellent horror film, which exceeds conventional horror and could be on the level of science-fiction. The ""eerie"" image of the film taking place in Haddonfield Memorial Hospital is what sets this movie off. The beginning of the film (October 31, 1978 in Haddonfield, Illinois) sets off the creep-factor as the classic tune ""Mister Sandman"" plays, as the dark leaves on the trees sway and the Doyle House comes into focus. Laurie Strode is taken_by stretcher_out of the Doyle House where she was stalked by Michael. The movie then again takes on eerie overtones using the effects of dark overlay music, as Laurie is being removed from the Ambulance (through the Ambulance Entrance) into the hospital. The setting becomes even darker as ""The Shape"" finds his way into the hospital's dimmly lit corridors, making way for a final dramatic confrontation with (HIS SISTER) Laurie. *The classic tune ""Mister Sandman"" heard at the beginning of the movie sets thoughts in your mind that ""something serious is going on here."" Speaking of eerie, the added organ to the ""Halloween Theme"" (which identifies the sequel as a movie of it's own from Halloween) and additional overlay music make it a nail-biter. This movie along with the original and H20 set the entire mood of HALLOWEEN! In memory of Donald Pleasence and Debra Hill. **Please see my review of HALLOWEEN.",1084579200,2,1399,5.0606060606060606
833546,3,6304288433,"With the happy tones from The Cordettes' ""Mr Sandman"", the second Halloween film sets off. We are taken back to the same night as before, in a film that was meant to conclude the story.
The mood is a bit darker in this film than in the first one. Expectations about a good time on Halloween have changed into fear and sorrow after the murders. News reports about the murders, that interrupt the TV-film (""The Night of the Living Dead"") and on the radios, makes sure that no one misses what has happened. Dr. Loomis is, if possible, even more pessimistic about Michael Myers' nature. If he wasn't, in a moral sense, fully human in the first film, he is not even physically really human in this one. Adding to this dark mood, the action takes place only at night this time.
Since the film literally starts where the first ended (or two minutes before it ended), there is not much build-up. From the beginning Michael is out to kill people, and instead of building up a horror mood, we start with such a mood that only intensifies as the film continues. This also means that the new characters don't get to be intruduced so much. Although there are many side-characters the important ones are those from the first film: Michael Myers, Dr. Loomis, and Laurie Strode. Laurie Strode is at the hospital, having some dream about her childhood, and Dr. Loomis is out with the police looking for Michael Myers, following every new lead. In this film Michael is not content with knife stabs and strangulations, which makes the film a bit more gory, but not more scary.
Musically we hear the same tunes as in the first film, but often with a more synthetic sound (the turn of the eighties is to blame for that). The mood setting interludes from the first film are mostly lacking, which makes the film a bit too intense to last one hour and a half. The fact that this was meant to be the end of the story (obvious from the fact that Halloween III has a totally different story) may make up for some of the film's weaknesses. This is, after all, the conclusion of the Halloween saga.",1076284800,,2069,4.4907161803713525

HALLOWEEN 2 is sometimes very scary and frightening, but never as suspenseful as the first (almost however). One of the reasons it isn't as suspenseful is because there is quite a bit of explicit violence displayed on-screen in this motion picture. One of the scenes that shows this is much more graphic than the original is the sequence where Michael forces the nurse's face into the jacuzzi tub in the hospital. Otherwise, this sequel is very good and as good as the original. The musical numbers are from the original score by John Carptener, thus are effective and eerie. However, they are not done by Carptener himself - Alan Howarth does the score for this film and it is just as good as the original's. Debra Hill also returns with Carpenter to write the script for this sequel, and the script is very good and lives up to high expectations of a sequel. It's full of frightening scares and tense moments. Basically, it takes place the same night the original ended, and Laurie is admitted into the hospital. Michael follows her there and begins stalking the empty corridors of the hospital. Dr. Loomis discovers a secret about Michael and Laurie which I will not spoil if you haven't already seen this film.

She goes through hell in the Halloween movies and some how she manages to survive and get out, and amazingly some how Michael does the same!

""Friday the 13th"" jumped the shark when the original came out. That was one movie I just cannot enjoy. ""Halloween II"" is an exception. It actually picks up where the first film ended when Dr. Sam Loomis shoots Michael and leaves the house to check to see if Michael is dead or not, only to find Michael had gotten up and walked off into the shadows. Laurie Strode is taken to the Haddonfield hospital and that is where the fun begins. What bothers me the most about the movie is: a) where the heck were Laurie's parents? and b) the lack of lighting in the hospital is so unreal. Plus shouldn't there be more people on staff at a hospital? Then again Haddonfield is a small town. It ain't Chicago that's for sure. The body count in ""Halloween 2"" increases. This was one of those movies where you want to scream at the person in the film for being so stupid. The suspense from the first film may be lacking in the sequel but I enjoyed the movie. It sure beats the heck out of its predecessors (although ""Halloween IV"" is a major guilty pleasure of mine).",1067385600,,1178,4.334841628959276
833602,3,6304288433,"As the movie's slogan reads, ""The Nightmare Isn't Over Yet"". The original cast and crew return for the sequel to one of the all-time greatest horror films. While the film is supposed to take place on the same night as the original massacre, it was actually filmed three years later. Many members of the cast, most notably Jamie Lee Curtis have aged since then but hey, it's all in fun, right?
Michael Myers isn't dead and he's still killing teenagers like nobody's business. His shrink, Dr. Loomis is still trying to warn the residents of his old neighborhood but little is being done. The original victim, Lorie Strode is in the local hospital so it's only a matter of time before Myers shows up there and perfoms surgery on the staff.
""Halloween II"" is not quite on the level of its classic predecassor but it is still a worthy sequel. It does rely a lot more on gore than the original but this is to be expected. Donald Pleasance is the real star here. With Curtis nearly catatonic through the majority of the film, Pleasance really steps up. His portrayal of Loomis is such an intergral and often overlooked piece of the Halloween series. Without Pleasance in the latter films, the Halloween series has become just another run-of-the-mill slasher series but these earlier films were real treats.",1066348800,3,1299,4.726872246696035

Yes, it's vastly inferior to the first, but Michael Myers (played well here by stuntman Dick Warlock) is still a creepy presence.  Forget that the hospital is poorly lit and ridiculously understaffed; forget that the killer breaks windows by simply walking into them; forget that his scalpel can support a nurse in mid-air, without her sliding off it; etc.  The music is altered slightly at times, but is still creepy.  And the ending certainly looked liked the door to any other sequels was slammed shut; unfortunately in this day and age we know better.  Good fun.",1064880000,,622,4.830188679245283
833604,5,6304288433,"Being the first Sequel to the brilliant 1978 Halloween Horror Classic, Halloween II (1981) is clearly flawed but clearly still delivers.  First of all I think It was kind of difficult to come up with a first sequel for such a great part one that came three years earlier.  With that being said, It left off directly from the ending of the first Halloween.  It brought back all the main characters from the first one as well.  The movie also serves it's purpose explaining why Michael want's to kill his sister Laurie Strode (Played By Jamie Lee Curtis).  But the Dr. Sam Loomis (Played by Donald Pleasence) is out to stop the Evil Michael Myers from wrecking havoc even some more from earlier that day which was shown in Halloween I.  The problem with Halloween II is that, Michael Myers Was shown a bit too much opposed to the first installment which made part II lack the suspense of the original.  It's like he was the main character in this movie, especially the first half.  Another thing is that this one had more gruesome bloody death scenes which were unnecessary.  Part One showed almost no blood and still found a way too be scary.  A large part of the movie took place in an empty hospital which made the atmosphere more creepy.  I thought that maybe they should not have shown too much of the movie inside the hospital, but I feel it certainly did not ruin the movie.  As for the supporting cast which was mostly people who worked in the hospital they were not terrible but after a while the viewer might be wanting Michael too kill them, due to them being a little annoying.  Donald pleasence intense acting once again did a great job in this one as Michael Audrey Myers Doctor.  Jamie Lee Curtis also did a solid job acting as a great scream queen,  but I wish they had spent less time showing curtis lying in hospital bed throughout the movie.  Curtis however, played a vital role in the movie's intensifying ending.  When you compare Halloween II to the rest sequels in the series or any other horror movie sequels or sequel's in the entire movie industry there was not many other ways this movie could have been better.  Don't get me wrong Halloween II has it's faults but at the end it turn's out to be one hell of a ride.",1064016000,2,2240,4.461916461916462

It once again seems that Dr. Sam Loomis(Donald- rest-in-peace-Pleasence) is ""hell-bent"" on catching Michael before he kills again.  Rick Rosenthal, in my opinion, didn't do such a bad job of directing this film.  However,John Carpenter I believe wrote this one; he just didn't want to direct it.  It picks right up where the original leaves off.  The score is slightly different if you compare the original to this one, but it still gets it's point across to the viewer.  Michael finds new, and unique ways to kill his victims in this particular film.  I think the most grotesque killing is when he drowns the nurse in the scalding hot therapy pool.  After 20 years+, it still remains one of the most concrete, of all the sequels.  The sound isn't the greatest, but it is o.k..  Some special features would of been nice.

No nurse is gonna do something so stupid as that.  I am however so glad that Myers killed Bud.  He was such a dweeb.  My favorite part was the chase scene between Laurie and Michael.  She runs as if in a nightmare, and he walks his methodical walk.  The ending was great and I was thrilled to see him come back for more in Halloween 4,  but I liked Halloween 7  H2o much more and consider it a sequel to this trilogy.",1023667200,2,1074,4.370558375634518
833890,3,6304288433,"This is one of the 1980s most needlessly gratuitous blood-'n-gore flicks. The admirable restraint of John Carpenter's original film is entirely lacking in Rick Rosenthal's sequel. Continuity begins to become a problem in the series starting with this film, by virtue of Michael Meyers' becoming a connoisseur killer for no particular reason.
For all these flaws, though, the film is still nail-bitingly suspenseful. The story is clever, providing murderer Michael with a motivation and introducing some interesting backstory. Jamie Lee Curtis continues to play the beleaguered heroine with sympathy, and Donald Pleasance, as always, is fabulous. The effects are good, even if the blood and gore are way, way overdone. The explosive finale is terrific. The color is especially rich. John Carpenter and Alan Howarth's frenetic music score is essentially the same one used in the first movie, but better orchestrated and more full-bodied.
Maybe not better the second time around, but still worth a look  -  especially for fans of the series.",1021334400,3,1038,5.361963190184049

833892,4,6304288433,"Even if John Carpenter did not direct it, this still remains one of my all time favorite horror movies. Of course, it is very rare for a sequel to outshine its predecessor (only ""Aliens"" did manage to do that in horror cinematic history); especially if the original film is considered to be a classic by critics.
However, ""Halloween 2"" still manages to be a very enjoyable horror movie. It picks up exactly after the incidents of the original. Laurie Strode is taken to hospital, Michael Myers is still alive and once again innocent people will inevitably fall victims to his prey. Many previous reviewers have signalled the excessive amount of blood and gore present in this movie. And it's true. Just think of a nurse having all her blood drained out, or a person with a needle pinched in the middle of his eye.
This type of grotesque drama is surely a matter of taste, but anyone not minding a little blood-sheding here and there should definetely check out this sequel. Those who say that this movie lacks suspense are however quite wrong in my opinion. ""Halloween 2"" is full of heart-throbbing moments. The movie does not simply show Myers killing his victims in matter of  seconds, as witnessed for example by the famous bath-tub scene. The person playing Myers also did a fantastic job. ""The Shape"" has a very sort of mechanical movement this time round, which makes him less human and more frightengly threatening.
I only hope that Rick Rosenthal does another good job on the forthcoming ""Halloween 8"", even if personally I do not have high hopes for it. Donald Pleasence, we miss you. We truly do.",1019260800,,1606,4.735714285714286

833895,3,6304288433,"It was pretty clever to pick up exactly where Halloween left off.  Michael continues his spree in a hospital albeit in a more Friday the 13th sort of way.  In Halloween, the murders are so stretched and dripping with suspense that there are only three onscreen murders!  I guess he's more efficient now because he doesn't waste time with all that creepiness and taut anticipation.  That being said the last thirty minutes or so are right on par with the original.  Try not to hold your breath as The Shape walks slowly toward the open elevator door.  I dare you!
Like all sequels it is often compared unfavorably to the original.  That's okay.  If you're a slasher fan, what would you rather watch Halloween II or Sleepaway Camp 2.  See.  It doesn't compare with Halloween, few do.  But it is so much better than any other horror sequel (and most originals) that it stands on its own in that way.  Check out Visiting Hours for a hospital slasher made at roughly the same time.  Do they compare?  No, they do not!
The Goodtimes DVD has few extras.  For instance, in the TV version there are several differences in certain scenes.  The girl killed at the beginning her throat slashed in this version, but in the TV version Michael jumps out at her and engulf the screen in black.  Also, the deputy's death in the hospital is different.  In one version Michael stabs him with a knife and lifts him off the ground, in the other Michael turns him over and slashes his throat.  In addition, there are several scenes missing like Jimmy returning with the Coke that he promised Laurie and Jimmy being reunited with Laurie at the end of the film.

Another thing similar to other horror sequels is that the plot becomes more complicated, but the movie never actually follows the rules it establishes. .... He'll stop at nothing to get to her.

As a note, the television version of this film is different and contains quite a few extra scenes that were used to pad it out for the networks while violence was cut down.  Can we please have a COMPLETE version of this film that includes all of the extra TV footage as well as the blood and gore?
The missing scenes definitely fudge the continuity of the DVD release.  For instance, early in the film the hospital is a well-lit place with a little bit of activity.  Within minutes we see shots of the hallways in which the emergency UPS lights are on and the corridors are bathed in expressionistic shadows.  Fine, stylistically, but what gives?  Well, if you've seen the TV version, you know that the power goes out when Michael Meyers tampers with it.  (He did knock out the phone line, and this is clearly implicated.)  Suddenly the dwindling hospital staff are running scared down dark hallways chasing Laurie.
Also, there is additional dialogue between the doctors and nurses, increasing their too-short on-screen time, as well as extra footage of Jimmy and Laurie, and a different ending(!)  This makes the 2 versions quite different in my opinion.
I've never been too impressed with Goodtimes' VHS and DVD releases, and this is no exception.  All we get are some lame production notes.
As far as sequels go, especially in the slasher genre, this is definitely one of the better ones.  The main attraction is that it picks up RIGHT AFTER the original ends.  Essentially you can have a marathon of these 2 back to back and it's quite exciting.  This film emphasizes gore much more than the original (which was really bloodless).  And, like it or not, Michael Meyers does some pretty classic cliched slasher killer moves here, including getting inventive (needles, hot tubs, draining people of blood(!))  It does have a very creepy atmosphere, for which the film gets major points.  The camerawork is excellent for the most part, and Dick Warlock is a great Shape.  Missing again are extra scenes of him stalking around the hospital as well as closeups of the mask right before the hot tub dunking murder.
All in all, you may want to skip this particular release and pick up the more recent Universal DVD.  Although it is still the same exact movie (no more extras) there is apparently a much better picture and sound quality.
In my opinion, the first two Halloween films make a nice couple, and I feel so-so about the further lot of sequels that followed.  This film increased the creepiness of the original by making Michael some kind of (semi) unstoppable creature.
Another note, apparently Halloween II director Rick Rosenthal is helming the upcoming Halloween: The Homecoming in 2002.",1012780800,3,2894,4.798387096774194

I'd like to refer to this as the Empire Stikes Back of horror sequels, if it weren't for the epic George A. Romero's Dawn Of The Dead. The nudity and gore in this one are nicely handled to show-off artistic freedom, if not just for fun.

This is a great sequel to HALLOWEEN. It has the original characters, unlike some films, and the story doesn't change, making the film a big amount of confusion. It all continues from where it started. After this sequel to HALLOWEEN, it starts to get bad though. That's why I would stick with the first two films. They're both pretty much scary, I'll tell you that.
HALLOWEEN II is always good to watch right after the first film, if you're up all night watching horror movies. It's a direct continuation. That's another thing that's great about HALLOWEEN II. It was made three years after HALLOWEEN's original release, and the producers managed to keep the right characterizations for the sequel.

It also must be brought to attention that Carpenter's main infulence for Halloween was Dario Argento's DEEP RED(1975)...(happy Phil?!) Most of the plot thematics were borrowed, if not some of the situations, such as the scene where the police find a school where Michael Myers broke into only a few hours ago.

834135,4,6304288433,"John Carpenter's chilling 1978 classic ""Halloween"" was a true benchmark for terror. Anything following it would not stand a chance of being as good. While some 'Halloween' sequels were very good(4 and H20), some were also bad(3 and 6). This follow up to the original is in the 'good' category. The film, however, fails to capture the real terror of the original. It tries very hard. The story continues on the same night as the original. Laurie has been transfered to the Haddonfield hospital. Michael has survived(!)and overhears on a kid's radio that the victims have been taken to the hospital. The kid with the radio is the son of Dick Warlock who played Michael. There, Michael hacks his way thru the staff to get to Laurie. Dr. Loomis is hot on his trail. It is also in this film that we learn the truth behind Laurie and Michael's connection. So, in that regard, this movie is pivotal in the series' history. It is very eerily shot and looks good, but it doesn't hold a candle to the original. It comes close at times. Director Rick Rosenthal definitley went to the ' John Carpenter School ' when he set out to direct this movie. He got the angles and the mood down right. What he didn't get down right was the characters and the emotional pull of the first film. The writers of this film also turned the Laurie Strode character into a nothing role. You rooted for her in the original, but in this one you barely remember she's even in the darn thing!. It was almost as if the Laurie Strode character was an after thought until the final chase and showdown in the climax. Donald Pleasence was great, but Jamie Lee Curtis was given way less to do. She has a much smaller part in this one. Her part kicks in in the last half. This film plays more like a standard ""Friday The 13th"" slasher film than the bloodless, suspense filled original. It works most of the time. The other characters in the movie don't fare as well as the few in the original. There is no one in the movie, besides Laurie, that you would care about one way or the other if they died or not. Very undeveloped. They are all just typical knife fodder who would of been just as useless in a Jason movie. Dick Warlock, as Michael Myers, is a very good Michael. At least I think so. He has the creep factor and the walk down pat. The mask is a little altered from the original. I have mixed feelings on the mask. Still, it's a fun, entertaining chapter to the series. Don't expect anything close to the original masterpiece. This film, along with the original and H20 make for a teriffic trilogy of films. The others, while some are okay, don't matter as much. Halloween 2 is not great art, but it's a fun horror film. It had a tough job to do to follow the classic original. It tried it's best, and even though it didn't completely succeed, it came okay.

834138,4,6304288433,"""Halloween 2"" has something that is very rare in sequels: it picks up the exact second that the last one left off. The only other sequels I know that did this were Back to the Future parts 2 & 3.
Disagree with me if you like, but ""Halloween 2"" digs far deeper than it's predecessor. Some things you find out about in this film will make you look at the original in a far different way. Of course, I won't dare give away anything crucial. Also, in this sequel, some rules have been bent. Michael Meyers is back and bigger than ever. He's now invincible, can walk through plate glass doors, and can walk away from explosions, thirteen bullets (two of which go directly into his eyes!), and slamming elevator doors.
This time, we start off seeing the ending of the original, where Dr. Loomis (Pleasence) saves our heroine Strode (Curtis) from Michael with six bullets. Michael dissapears, and Pleasence has a really good line right before Carpenter's da-doo-doo-da-doo-doo plays in full, with a new funky 80's sound to it. After that and the credits, Curtis is rushed to a hospital, where Michael tracks her down and starts picking off nurses one by one. Sounds cheesy? It is. But it's really entertaining.
In a vain effort by director Rosenthal to make the audiences squirm and see it again, he uses very unique ways to do away with the nurses. Including, but not limited to, disfiguring them in hot tubs, draining their blood out, and taking hypodermic needles to their eyes. Some of this is really sick... but all in good fun.
One of the few things that is wrong about H2 is that it tries to up Michael's IQ along with his invulnerability. Early in the film, Michael writes the word ""SAMHAIN"" on the wall of an elementary school. To know the origin of this word, and to be able to connect it to the date of October 31, requires more IQ than a braindead maniac who's been staring at a wall for half his life. Oh well. It's an intresting approach to show off Michael's bigger and better powers. Also makes you wonder: how did Michael become invulnerable after they have heavily spoken on how human he is. Almost like he sold his soul to the devil or something in between 1 & 2.
Oh, well. It's still a lot of fun.",994982400,3,2210,4.486352357320099
834139,2,6304288433,"HALLOWEEN 2 is a unique film in many ways, because it picks up the chain of events of the original HALLOWEEN basically right at the end of that film and continues them.  Jamie Lee Curtis and Donald Pleasance are back, with the masked figure known as Michael Myers still stalking the streets of Haddonfield.  This time, much of the murderous mayhem is centered around the local clinic where Curtis has been hospitalized...and here it is revealed exactly why the madman is targeting her.
Because Michael Myers couldn't even be stopped by Pleasance's gun at the end of HALLOWEEN 1, this sequel may actually have been necessary.  And certainly for the most part, director Rick Rosenthal, helped by ace cinematographer Dean Cundey (who later shot JURASSIC PARK and APOLLO 13), keeps his focus on suspense, in the tradition of the original.
But something sure went wrong when it was finished.  Reportedly, feeling that this suspenseful emphasis might make HALLOWEEN 2 look old-fashioned in light of such HALLOWEEN-inspired imitators such as FRIDAY THE 13TH, Carpenter (who was only co-producer/co-writer this time, along with Debra Hill) went back in (without Rosenthal's knowledge) and shot some graphically gory murder inserts.  This is really a shame!  The sequel may have been necessary, but the explicit violence and gore weren't!
This makes HALLOWEEN 2, for me, a curiously disappointing film.  Had Carpenter not tinkered with Rosenthal's methods by trying to liven up things with a bunch of unnecessarily gory murders, this could have equalled the original.  Instead, it's not much better than HALLOWEEN's many imitators.",994809600,4,1622,5.235521235521236

I was disappointed at this film; it was no where near as scary and creepy as the original. The killer no longer hides in the shadows, and the killings are not as creative as the first film. The only thing that are present in this flick from the original is the score by John Carpenter. There is one portion of the movie that didn't make sense; Laurie Strode's reason for leaving her bed wasn't explained in the movie.

Letterboxed and with good sound and picture quality. Many people here complain about the lack of extras, but does all movies have to come in a 2-disc limited edition set? Others compare it to the original, and of course this movie is not that sort of all-time classic. Anyway, I think Halloween II is one of the best horror-sequels ever.

834252,5,6304288433,"There are reviews for several different DVD & blu ray releases of this movie in this section. This review is for the Shout / Scream Factory Collector's Edition blu ray version. I now have four recent releases on blu ray from this company: Halloween II, Halloween III, Funhouse and They Live. They all have spectactular audio / video presentations and have just never, ever looked this good. Even Halloween II has been given an upgraded video transfer over last year's Universal 30th Anniversary release. They only thing that version has over this one is the  rather excellent documentary feature film, ""Terror in the Isles"", that was included as a major special feature. So hold onto it if you bought that version too.

As a side note, one pet peeve of mine as a collector, is the tendency of companies that release home video media to put new uninspired cover art on their DVDs and blu rays. My only disappointment with these four blu rays from Shout / Scream Factory initially was the ""pulp-comic book"" drawn look of the cover art. Well...I just discovered (by accident) that they all have reversable cover sleeves with the original classic movie poster cover art inside. So I reversed all of them on mine. You can tell that releasing these films properly is a labor of love for Shout / Scream factory. They really thought of everything. I look forward to buying Terror Train, Deadly Blessing and next year's The Fog, The Howling, Night of the Comet and Lifeforce. Bravo!",985651200,,1473,4.772549019607843
834253,3,6304288433,"Let me first state that you cannot go to see a sequel, and think it is going to live up to be as good, or even better than the original. If you do that, then you are in for a lifetime of dissapointment. With that said, Halloween 2 does not come close to being the classic the first is, but it is a rather good sequel.
The story takes place just hours after where the first one left off. The plot is this. Laurie Strode(Curtis) is taken away to the Haddonfield Hospital. Micaheal Myers follows her, where , in a game of cat-and-mouse, kills, about more than half the hospital staff, as a means to get to Laurie. That's it. The BIG plot. The only twist this story has, is that you find out why Michael is so determined to get his hands on Laurie. I won't spoil that for you, just check it out.
Now, the DVD it'self. Get ready for ton's of bonuses and extra's, uh, wait, sorry, this DVD has about none of those that I just mentioned. I will say, that I have 2 VHS copies of ""H2"", and I must say, the DVD picture quality is pretty good. All in all, I would recomend this DVD to anyone who is questioning whether or not, to buy it. For the small price, it is worth it. John Carpenter and Debra Hill, were sort of ""forced"" to write Halloween 2, even though Carpenter will tell you, that 80% of him does not like doing sequels. Instead of relying on characterzation, suspence, and the errie atmosphere of the first one, Halloween 2 relies on ""let's think of a dozen way's to kill a dozen people"" type of shock.
Final words- For a movie that was not supposed to be, Halloween 2 is a pretty good follow-up. I give it 3 stars, only because of the film it'self...the DVD features are really weak. Hopefully, maybe down the road, another DVD company will pick up the title, and give us some extra feature's.",984960000,2,1795,4.236151603498542

834255,3,6304288433,"Many sequels do not live up to their original.  In this case, Halloween 2 (The Nightmare Isn't Over), is quite respectable.  Though it's not quite as shocking as Halloween (1978) was, it still delivers what fans want.  You have to like the fact that Jamie Lee Curtis returns, and Donald Pleasance, but the movie mostly takes place in a dark hospital, and most of the suspense has been lost.  This film will be dumb for non-Halloween fans, but for Halloween fans, it's watchable.",982972800,,478,4.72289156626506
834256,4,6304288433,"Picking up immediately where ""Halloween"" ended, Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis) is taken to the local clinic for her injuries while Dr. Sam Loomis (Donald Pleasance) urges the police to ""assume Michael Myers is still alive"" and keep looking for him. Good idea. But while they look in all the wrong places, Michael follows his terrified quarry to the clinic and starts performing unauthorized surgery on the staff. By the time Loomis discovers where Michael is - and why he's there - it's a race against time as Laurie is being pursued by the most dangerous man alive.
Rick Rosenthal directs this handsome and polished sequel at a pace that keeps ""more of the night he came home"" moving along. But in the wake of the first two ""Friday the 13th"" films that were released after ""Halloween"", audiences expectations had changed. Behind Rosenthal's back (and certainly against his better judgment) John Carpenter re-shot some scenes with more graphic violence. There is some merit to Rosenthal's claim that Carpenter ""ruined"" his film; all the gory close-ups really aren't necessary, and it certainly hasn't helped the film's reputation. Nonetheless, there's still plenty of scares and suspense to keep you on the edge of your seat, as well as logic loopholes that the film wouldn't be possible without. TV versions offer a variety of deleted scenes, mostly of hospital staff chit-chat as well as shots of Michael Myers roaming the corridors and some alternate scenes, such as the attack on the marshal or the ending where a very much alive Jimmy is reunited with Laurie. One deleted scene worth mentioning shows the hospital emergency generator kick in as the lights go out. This answers the often asked question ""Why did the hospital suddenly get so dark""?
Donald Pleasance gives a great hammy performance as the obsessed doctor, and Jamie Lee Curtis can still scream - although until the last half hour or so she's mostly in a hospital bed. I think this is the best sequel; the other ones lack the coherency and style here until Curtis returned in 1998 for the gripping ""Halloween H20"". This Universal DVD release only has the theatrical trailer; Rick Rosenthal was too busy shooting ""Halloween: Resurrection"" to do the promised commentary and the inclusion of the deleted scenes were scrapped at the last minute, despite active fan petitions.",979603200,5,2341,4.989769820971867

The opening scenes start up right  where the first movie left off and the ending is thrilling.  PLEASE watch  this movie!  Some may say the sequel is not as good as the original but  that is nonsense.  I have watched practically every horror movie more than  once and this is one of the top ten of all time easily.  Besides do we  really watch a horror movie for its acting or ability to fit into popular  culture as critics argue.  The answer is NO.

The star,  Jamie Lee Curtis, is reduced to crawling around and murmuring like a stroke  victim. Donald Pleasence often shouts the exact same speeches he shouted in  the first movie and the new actor portraying Michael Mysers doesn't look AT  ALL like the actor who played him in part 1. Whoo! Those faults aside,  Halloween 2 does deliver the goods. Characters aren't lined up one by one  and knocked off like in most horror movies. They are slowly and  methodically bumped off in rather memorable ways without disturbing the  slowly building suspense. The ending, by the way, is a knock-out.

The cat and mouse style of the previous entry is discarded in favor of bloody 'weapon of the moment' murder sequences and the viewers frustration level at waiting for the movie to get truly nail bitingly scary like the first one was will be almost as high as the body count. The only things I can recommend about this DVD are the nice widescreen presentation, Dean Cundy is an excellent cinematographer, and Carpenter's wonderful music score. There are zero real extras on the Goodtimes disc and why is that? No trailers even?

834647,3,6304288433,"As an avid horror fan, I truly believe that HALLOWEEN is one of the greatest and most influential horror flicks ever created.  It jump started the whole slasher genre, in which many have tried to duplicate its terror  and ingenuity.  However, none have ever matched up with it.  Three years  later, John Carpenter and Debra Hill wrote (but had no input in directing)  the sequel, which does indeed do something quite creative: taking place  EXACTLY where the first one left off.  I have heard most HALLOWEEN fans  call it the second half of part one.  I have even heard HALLOWEEN fans  refer to it as the superior flick.  However, I tend to disagree.  While  this horror movie does a decent job at sweeping off the dust that the first  one left, it does not rank up there with the first.
The first HALLOWEEN  was low-budget, therefore unable to perform bloody special effects.  Much  like THE TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE 2, the sequel to HALLOWEEN induces more  gore and more deaths, simply to satisfy the title of being a  ""slasher"" flick than the actual movie.  Expect some mild sex and  tremendous slaying.  I do admire the slayings taking place in the hospital,  though.  Don't ask me why, but I thought that was rather interesting for  the Shape to follow Curtis all the way there.
HALLOWEEN 2 does bring back  Jamie Lee Curtis and Donald Pleseance, who both do fine at reprising their  roles.  The supporting cast is only there for the slaying, most of them the  staff at the hospital.  I do give HALLOWEEN 2 props for having a satisfying  climax and good eventual twist to the story.
This is basically it:  HALLOWEEN 2 should be viewed by the fans who liked the original.  You may  like it more, you may like it less.  If you like it less, it'll succeed in  making you appreciate the original even more.  But all I'm saying is that  HALLOWEEN 2 is far from memorable.  Not the worst horror sequel, but  definitely not the best.",952473600,,1930,4.575221238938053

834649,4,6304288433,"Halloween II does something which I find very unusual for sequels. It picks up at the exact moment when the first movie left off, and Michael Myers continues his bloody rampage through Haddonfield. Donald Pleasance  again delivers a fantastic performance as Dr. Loomis, and so does Jamie Lee  Curtis, though we (unfortunately) don't see much of her in this one, until  Michael finds her and chases her through the hospital. The plot with Dr.  Loomis was well delivered, but the moments in the hospital dragged on just  a bit, although it does prove that Michael has no regard for life as he  systematically eliminates anyone who could stand in his way. The best part  of this movie is when Nurse Marion (Nancy Stephens) reveals the truth about  Laurie Strode and her relationship to Michael. In retrospect, this makes  the first movie make complete sense! I think this is a good movie, but that  it's more like the second half of a three-hour movie, than its own  individual story.",951091200,4,981,4.779761904761905

You feel sorry for everyone who gets killed.  The organ music is  incredible, and every time I watch it, it gives me the good ol' chills and  winces!  All of the hospital instruments were brilliant, particularly the  hypodermic syringes and the intravenous tube.  The scene where Bennett  Tramer is hit by a cop car and roasts is also top notch.  Just about every  minute of the film is pure, classic suspense.  It is the most suspenseful  horror film I've ever seen.  The only part of the movie I hate is when we  see a boy with a razor in a marshmallow that he's eating!  Gratuitous and  in very poor sadistic taste.  Really stupid, too.

I mean come on, most of you guys bad mouth the gore in this  but give great ratings to such gore fests as the FRIDAY THE 13th and  NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET movies.  Anyway, I thought that this was the best  HALLOWEEN sequal ever!  I love the fact that it starts off right after  HALLOWEEN and that it continues on Lauries story, when could have easily  just said that Michael decided to go after someone else.  But as in most  horror movies I did have some problems with it, #1 the recap of the ending  of HALLOWEEN is messed up in a spot #2 the killing at the beginning had  absolutaly no reason to it and #3 it doesn't explain how Michael survived  all the gunshots and pokings/stabbings in HALLOWEEN.

835101,5,6304288433,"When I first heard of the Halloween series it was when Halloween H20 came out.  I had never seen the original, but I did see Halloween 3 (which sucks out loud) but I never knew it was related to the whole series (in a sense  that it only bears the name Halloween).  I saw one preview for H20 and I  had to see it.  I saw H20 the 2nd week of August I loved it.  Halloween  came around and I bought the first 3 sequels (a big mistake since they were  Goodtimes and Video Treasure copies, but I have heard that the widescreen  version of this movie is a big improvement from their usual transfers).  I  loved the first movie, since then I've gotten all of the sequels and the  limited edtion plus the tv cut of Halloween II, the producer's cut of part  6 and the rough cut of H20--many people say the producer's cut of Halloween  6 is terrible because it's usually overdubbed--my copies are actually in  color, so I was lucky enough to find someone who had color copies.  One  major problem with Halloween II was the fact that Curtis cut her hair  shorter (if you watch Terror Train you will see how it looked in 81) that  was one BIG mistake they could have made a better wig! her hair was darkish  brown with blonde streaks and lighter tones of brown.  It was her choice to  cut it, but come on that's one cheap wig they could have tried a little  harder than that.  The wig looks Red not Brown like in the original.  I  like the whole movie though, remember how Laurie couldn't even talk to a  guy in Halloween?  Jimmy takes a liking to her and she's not shy at all I  like that whole scenario.  I also enjoy  the part where Jamie Lee does her  screaming I love when she murmurs ""help..."" then ""HELP  ME!!!"" and runs for the hospital door and reprises her dialogue from  the original...that to me is the best part.  All in all it's a great sequel  one of the best considering other cheesy sequels like (the Nightmare On Elm  Street series) which I do not like it's just stupid.  I'd have to recommend  you watch Halloween 4, 5 and H20, you will not be disappointed with any of  .  Halloween rocks!--JAMIE LEE CURTIS IS AWESOME :)",936748800,,2129,4.248743718592965

When you consider all of the filmmaker's options for a sequel to perhaps the best horror film of all time (Halloween, 1 year  later?, Halloween the next day with police involved?, Halloween III?  yuck!),they could have done a lot worse. The only sequel that I can think  of that picks up exactly where the first one ended, who knew the night was  only half through? Very cool. Also, I forgot to mention the other effect  that made this film and it's predecessor so scary. The WALK! Talk about  body language! The walk that Nick Castle (Michael Myers in pt. 1) came upon  almost by accident, made the character what he is.  Evil, precise,&  predatory. Always stalking his prey. I wouldn't go into detail about this  sort of thing but if someone asked you to imitate Michael Myers, what would  you do? But I digress.

7866907,3,6304288433,"HALLOWEEN II is a modestly entertaining slasher film that probably never should have been made. It has its moments, but in no way, shape or form does it recapture the dark magic of the original movie. This should come as no surprise. Though it was produced by John Carpenter and features his iconic, chilling piano score, as well as key members of the original cast, it falls victim to numerous insta-cliches and makes the critical mistake of trying to explain the inexplicable.

HALLOWEEN II begins moments after HALLOWEEN ends. Dr. Sam Loomis (Donald Pleasance) has just shot the escaped lunatic Michael Myers five or six times with his revolver and watched him plummet off a balcony, only to discover the mouth-breathing murderer has somehow gotten up and walked away. He goes off in search of his nemesis while the lone survivor of Michael's rampage, Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis) is taken away in an ambulance to lonely Haddonfield Hospital. Riddled with bullets but showing no ill effects, Michael gets himself a new knife and, catching a news broadcast that Laurie is in intensive care, begins to carve his way to and through the hospital looking for her. Catatonic with trauma, Laurie begins to recall repressed moments of her youth that fill in some of the blanks as to why Michael is so interested in her, but she doesn't have much time to put the pieces in place before Michael knock-knocks on her chamber door and the final hunt begins. In the mean time, Loomis zeroes in on the hospital and rushes to confront Michael, and save Laurie, for what he hopes is the last time.

If that sounds a bit straightforward, even simple, well, it is. This movie is very light on plot and unlike the previous film, which was a kind of exploration of the unfathomable nature of evil and the capriciousness of death, this one is a fairly routine slasher-slaughter in which Michael behaves somewhat out of character. In HALLOWEEN, we quickly discover that Michael Myers is not interested in body counts; he's interested in playing a game of ""tag,"" in which specific people are ""it"" and no one else is to be harmed -- provided they don't get in his way. In this movie, Michael goes full Jason Voorhees (before Jason Voorhees was a thing!) and just massacres all and sundry in his path, while his victims behave more or less as stupidly as possible, leaving doors unlocked, going into spooky dark basement rooms and slipping on blood at critical moments.  What's more, Jamie Lee Curtis, though given high billing in the movie, has almost no part in it. She weeps and babbles a little, seems to recover, then goes into a catatonic state and stays there until nearly the end of the film. Most of the screen time is divided between the redoubtable Donald Pleasance, who does a yoeman's job of trying to recreate the frantic, almost-crazy intensity of Dr. Loomis -- who is as obsessed with Michael as Ahab was with the whale -- and various soon-to-be-victims who get boiled alive, smashed with hammers, or hacked to death. But even Pleasance can't quite rescue this film from slasher convention. What I love so much about the original film is its restraint: the first hour is a tense and prolonged set-up, and the last 45 minutes an exercise in inescapable, inexplicable doom. The key point -- why? -- is left up to the audience's imagination. Here, nothing, or very little, is, and that left em feeling a bit like the kid who just saw how the magic trick is done. It may satisfy curiosity, but it ruins the fun.

Oh, to be sure, some of the kills are brilliantly gruesome, and the film does a very effective job of making the dull small-town hospital look as creepy and isolated as if it were a cabin at the end of the world, but I could never shake the feeling that this was just a by-the-numbers sequel, put together mechanically and designed to squeeze as much cash out of a hot property before the temperature cooled off. I'll watch this film around Halloween just for the hell of it, but it doesn't hold a jack 'o lantern to the original HALLOWEEN.",1520726400,,4046,4.670406732117812
