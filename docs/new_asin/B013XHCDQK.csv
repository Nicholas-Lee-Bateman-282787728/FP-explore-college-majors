8729147,5,B013XHCDQK,"Martin Armstrong, the worlds most accurate forecaster, makes complex world economics simple, its all about rich folks trying to make money and moving capital to the best place to make the most profit as well as keeping their money safe. It does not matter how much people get hurt by this process, or even how much whole countries suffer. So long as my pile is safe, who cares what happens to you.

Martin lays out the cycles of war, corruption, profit and bankruptcy that have been repeating themselves since the beginning of time. You cannot stop it, its human nature. So glad we have Martin there to at  least tell us about it so you can prepare and prevent yourself from getting screwed over. This is a DVD you should buy and play over and over again until you understand just how the world works.",1531008000,,801,4.517241379310345
8729148,5,B013XHCDQK,"If you are a follower of Armstrong's work, then this is one of those that will give you ideas outside of the conventional norm. Note that there are two version - the short and longer version.",1485993600,2,191,4.333333333333333

8729150,4,B013XHCDQK,"A good overview of Martin Armstrong's take on the current debt problem in the USA, and the implications for other countries. As per Martins' usual style, it may appear to ramble a bit, but he does cover a lot of ground. He offers an historical view and a solution, whether it comes to pass is another matter. For any student of history this is worthwhile viewing.",1457481600,9,363,4.515151515151516
8729151,5,B013XHCDQK,I watched this live and I was astonished. The reason I began following Martin Armstrong's blog was because I kept coming across pundits whose opinions I did not trust complaining about him. One even said he hated Armstrong. Now I know why. Armstrong thinks far outside the box but his perspectives make sense. I wish we could make every member of the House and Senate watch this video.,1451779200,11,385,4.676470588235294
8729152,5,B013XHCDQK,"Martin is a well respected economic forecaster with decades of experience in trading and artificial intelligence.  He's a history buff.  He also has spent decades interacting with power players in business and politics.  This conference is for you if you are interested in how many geo-political problems can be best addressed (National Debt, taxation, unfunded Social Security, political contributions, the definition of money, understanding the business cycle, Deflation, globalization, capital flows, bubbles, interest rates, and more).

Sadly, Martin believes it will take another major crisis before these solutions will be politically palatable.  But the more we all understand that there are market based solutions, the better the chances of us all pushing the future Congress and President to make the best moves possible, instead of falling into tyranny.

But perhaps this DVD will spark a current or future politician to be bold and proactive?  One can still hope.

I also highly recommend googling his free blog for more insights and forecasts from Martin.

And if the cost of this DVD is prohibitive, or if you are short on time, or if you have a short attention span, or if you get bored with too many history lessons, check out Martin's 90 minute version of this conference for the highlights.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Solution-Conference-90-Minute/dp/B014LAADTM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Solution Conference 90 Minute</a>",1451779200,13,1481,5.851162790697674
8729153,5,B013XHCDQK,"This provides an interesting bit of history and a unique projection of where things are headed based on Pi and cycles.  Based on those projections, it also offers a unique solution to the world's current dilemma with regard to money, debt, economics and political power.  Because one thing's for sure.  You don't solve problems using the same thinking that created them.  I see it all the time in the business world.  A client develops a bad business process in response to problems they encountered at some point in time and then when it stops working or they continue to have problems, they think if they just double down on it and do it harder or more efficiently, then they will get better results.  They don't see that their new business process has become the new problem.  They just keep slapping more band-aids on it, hoping it will get better.

They say that the military always trains to fight the last war.  This same logic applies to businesses, governments and especially to economists.  Economic theories are just stories built about what happened last time and how they ""fixed"" it.  That's why there are so many economic schools of thought.  When we get through this crisis, there will an economic story built around it too and how they ""fixed"" it and it will become a new economic school of thought with its associated beliefs.

Martin Armstrong offers a solution that is definitely outside of the box.  We are going to need some new thinking in the years to come, because what we are doing now, definitely isn't working and I'm not sure most of the current players are even remotely qualified to be putting a new solution together.",1448582400,16,1648,4.716783216783217
