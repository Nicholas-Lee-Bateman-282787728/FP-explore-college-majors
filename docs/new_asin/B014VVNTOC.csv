7425050,5,B014VVNTOC,"The compelling, intriguing and poignant story of a 14 year old girl's short tragic life as an early colonist in Jamestown, told through her discarded remains.

I remember studying Virginia history in Mrs. Farnham's fourth grade class in Norfolk, Virginia, nearly 50 years, ago.  History was ""cleansed""  for innocent fourth graders and told in capsulated ""disjointed"" individual stories..

The well acted scenes show the story of a 14 year old girl whose real name is lost in history, dubbed by archaeologists as ""Jane"" for Jane Doe.

You cannot have anything but heartfelt sympathy for ""Jane,"" as she arrived at the colony during the ""Starving Time"" and died only several months later, only to be butchered for her meat and especially her brain.

The story of ""Jane"" really personalizes the history of early Colonial America.  Kids grew up fast and endured enormous hardships, especially women.

The video would be ideal for any Junior High School Class and  all older students.",1448668800,9,978,5.10062893081761

8732043,4,B014VVNTOC,I like the info in this video and after being at the Jamestown dig it means so much more.  The video is a little short but the price through Amazon is great.,1508284800,,157,3.90625
8732044,4,B014VVNTOC,"This film was an interesting addition to another I have on Jamestown, but a little too graphic for young people.",1481068800,,112,4.65
8732045,2,B014VVNTOC,"I could have done without the eerie dramatization of them moving her body around figuring our how to butcher her to explain the cut marks.  The whole have a real actor portray ""Jane"" is kinda creepy.",1472256000,,199,4.527777777777778
8732046,2,B014VVNTOC,"I'm going to have to disagree with the other reviewers about the quality of this film. The first 20 minutes were great, and the structure of the story around one individual was a good storytelling choice, but the filmmakers ran out of things to say about halfway through the hour. The last thirty minutes was highly repetitive with multiple interviewed historians and archaeologists saying the exact same thing over and over. For example, there were multiple scenes in which experts said ""Hey, we found cut marks on the skeletal remains."" As if each time was the first time the viewer was hearing it. Near the end of the film, several experts each said one after the other, and in nearly the exact same way, that their work allowed the young girl's story to finally be told. Then the film narrator then chimed in and said that the expert work finally allowed the young girl's story to be told. Yes, we got that the first several times it was said. Very disappointed that the filmmakers could not find more to say without repeating themselves so much.",1468454400,4,1050,4.681081081081081

8732048,4,B014VVNTOC,"Very insightful,  It makes you truly appreciate the sacrifices those before us had made to make what would become America. I'm working on a historical fiction saga and so this was bought for research purposes.  If you are looking for a glimpse through a key-hole of time to get an idea of those first turbulent years at Jamestown, then this is for you.
WARNING:  while not as graphic as it could have been, there are a few 'cringe-worthy' segments that make this a PG-13 & above audience.  But, it  paints a look at Jamestown you won't find in school history books.  Remember: out of hundreds of colonists that Winter of 1609/10 only 60 survived---this explains what happened to them.",1464220800,2,684,4.705882352941177
8732049,5,B014VVNTOC,Very interesting.  Well researched.,1453680000,,35,7.75
8732050,5,B014VVNTOC,I watched the program on PBS and loved it. I knew I wanted a copy of my own. I visited Jamestown Colony in the mid 1990's and that added to my enjoyment. When we look at what people overcame historically it is amazing anyone survived. I love archaeology. The girl's story made me feel sad.,1453420800,6,289,4.2727272727272725
