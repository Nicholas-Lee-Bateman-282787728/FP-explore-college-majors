845318,5,6304313446,"I first met Ozu in Tokyo story , then i watched  The floating weeds  and i felt as if Ozu and every actor were a member of my family. This statement was further confirmed when i watched  Good morning  and  Equinox flower  all of them brilliant pictures so i decided to buy  Early summer  and i'm really hooked in Ozu's films and i can no longer wait for other of his films to be released.

If you are sensitive and if you believe in family and what everything in family life is concerned about don't hesitate to buy this movie.",1090540800,4,527,4.19
845319,5,6304313446,"The more Ozu films I watch, the more I fall in love with the simplicity and elegance of his storytelling.  Like all his work, ""Early Summer"" (""Bakushu"") is a beautiful snapshot of the human experience, in this case a 28-year old woman being pressured by her family to marry and balancing her own happiness with the happiness of those around her.
The tone of the film, like the weather in the title, is light and happy like a soft gentle early summer breeze.  Whimsical and joyful, even while dealing with a potentially heavy subject.
Arranged marriages (O-Miyai) are still practiced in Japan today and were much more common when ""Early Summer"" was made in 1951. In the cases of women like Noriko (Setsuko Hara), who at 28 would be considered almost an old maid, if she hasn't found a love-match by now, it is best to arrange a marriage before she becomes too old for anyone to take her.  However, Noriko is a modern woman, with ideas for her own happiness as her family will soon find out.
Ozu's simplicity is never boring, and Setsuko Hara is so completely charming that her smile can carry any story.  ""Early Summer"" utilizes many of Ozu's principle actors, and Chishu Ryu is on hand as Noriko's older brother Koichi, although he would play her father two years later in ""Tokyo Story.""
Criterion's presentation of ""Early Summer"" is every bit the jewel you would expect it to be, with Ozu-expert Donald Richie supplying the commentary track, and a documentary called ""Ozu Films from Behind-the-Scenes"" detailing his working methods and camera techniques.",1085875200,38,1555,4.812734082397004
845320,5,6304313446,"Ozu is a aquired taste to be sure.  If you just open yourself to the quiet beauty of the film, you will be rewarded.
The ""trancendent moment"" here is the future mother-in-law arranging the marriage directly with Noriko.  She regains her social position, makes her family whole, makes a mother for her grandaughter and a wife for her still greiving son, by breaking through the codes of politeness and indirectness.
It is a moment of modernity in a culture caught in-between.  It is a moment of total change for perhaps a dozen people, but it is not a crisis or a catharsis - just the opposite.
Films do not have to Thrill and Manipulate (E.T. anyone?) to have a lasting profound effect on your life.  Some great art is almost invisible......",1000771200,10,741,4.633587786259542
845321,5,6304313446,"Early Summer is a classic Ozu piece, and will probably rank as one of his best works. A sensitively rendered portrait of an ""old maid"" under severe pressure from her family to get married, Setsuko Hara gives a  heartbreaking performance in this beautiful, subtle, elegant and witty  piece set in post-world war II Japan. Although the film does suffer from a  few editing problems, it represents the world's greatest humanist director  at the peak of his craft, producing a lovely, stirring, emotional drama.

845403,5,6304313446,"Ozu Yasujiro should be listed among the top 5 filmakers of the 20th century.
I am aware that Ozu's ""Tokyo Story"" is rated among the 10 greatest films by a London-based group of film critics.  I do believe ""Tokyo Story"" (Tokyo Monogatari) is certainly one of the world's greatest.  But for my personal tastes, ""Early Summer"", ranks higher.  Ozu once said he did not wish to make films which were conventional in their plots.  In fact it seems he rated the concept of ""plot"" as Westerners view it, fairly low in value.  As do I.  ""Early Summer"" then is the best example I know of a movie that does very little in terms of action.  There are no chase scenes, no love scenes (by American standards) and no obvious tension.  For this reason I believe it is Ozu's masterpiece, it requires one to pay attention to everyday life.  And it rewards that consummate attention with timeless beauty, dare I say Love for life, whether lived in Japan in the 1950's or today. You can see the documentaries about Ozu's no-cut filming, low camera angles, and such....but until you experience the peace of his story telling, the interpolations of sky, clouds, the almost total lack of soundtrack, then you know little about sitting quietly watching trees blow in the wind either.",1341878400,3,1259,4.6863636363636365
845404,5,6304313446,"Ozu never married and spent his last years living with his aged mother and drank many an evening away often ending up in a stupor, yet he had the audacity to think he understood the subtleties of family life; as a movie director he refused to take advantage of new camera tecniques instead limited the options of his cinematographers seemingly guarenteeing a narrow viewpoint and treated his actors like robots, directing their slightest nuances down to their eye movements assuring stilted performances.  And with his co-screenwriter Kogo Noda ignored the essential foundation of films, the plot.  Also except for rare instances Ozu movies are devoid of overt drama and action sequences, that can be at first a stultifying experience for American movie fans weaned on action adventure movies.
  Why is this director of limitations now extolled by many as one of the greats of world cinema?  Because he made films that touch the heart is the answer.
  How was a director who limited his camera angles able to include so much movement within his frames and how could his actors who were coached in the minutest details of body and facial movements and had to stop often while the camera was repositioned give spontaneous looking performances, which they did and how could plotless scripts result in affecting cinema.  Ozu's cinema contradicts the expected results of his directorial methods.
  The reason for this is the assumptions I made about Ozu's methods in the first paragraph are fallacious.  Despite retakes and their precise positioning, the acting on film appears unconstained and unforced; his stationary camera is not limiting, but focused and the scripts are plotted, gently plotted as a series of anecdotal snippets unfolding subtle nuanced revelations of relationships emerging as seamless plot without the sharp edges of most story lines.
  The mystery of how a lifetime bachelor could plum the emotional depths at all and without resorting to dramatic exaggerations of feelings is baffling,yet he did. Ozu in his films reveals the hearts of his central characters yet never puts them on show.
  He had a meticulous discernining vision and with an unwavering trust in his own distinctive creative approaches, he transfered his sensebilities to the screen creating cinematic gems. 'Eary Summer"" is one of his masterpieces.",1259971200,2,2336,5.175531914893617

845406,5,6304313446,"Early Summer (Bakush) is the middle entry in what has been called director Yasujiro Ozu's Noriko Trilogy (bookended by Late Spring and Tokyo Story). All three films feature women named Noriko (all played by Setsuko Hara), who are without husbands, and embroiled in family dramas. The names of many of the other major characters recur in the trilogy, as well, which gives the films a feeling of almost being alternate world versions of each other- ala the way comic books have `canonical' superhero tales, and those set in alternate universes. Released in 1951, the 124 minute black and white film was written by Ozu and his co-writer Kgo Noda, and is every bit as great a film as its two more celebrated companion pieces. The film featured many of Ozu's actors from the two other films, and in many ways is a variation on the narrative of Late Spring, which revolves around the family plotting to marry off the `old maid' Noriko. Naturally, a suspension of disbelief is needed to believe that a character played by Hara- Japan's mid-Twentieth Century answer to Julia Roberts, aka `the girl next door,' would have any trouble finding male companionship. And all of the trilogy films are predicated on the changing role of the Japanese family in the postwar world, where the ideas of giri (duty) and ninjo (emotion) come into conflict.
  The basics of the narrative follow the tri-generational Mamiya family, who all share a suburban Tokyo home. The oldest generation is wary of change, but accepts it. The middle generation takes it or leaves it, and the youngest generation are just self-centered brats. There are the mother and father, Shukichi and Shige (played by Ichir Sugai and Chieko Higashiyama); their doctor son Koichi (Chishu Ryu), his wife Fumiko (Kuniko Miyake) and their two bratty sons, the older Minoru (Zen Murase)- about eight or nine, and the younger Isamu (Isao Shirosawa)- about four or five; and the parents' daughter, Noriko. Another son, never seen in the film, Shoji, died in World War Two, and the parents still lament and feel his absence. A missing member of the family is another Ozu standby. All of the family members share the expense of the household, and Noriko, who is twenty-eight, feels in no great hurry to marry. Yet, the bulk of the film is not devoted to this pursuit, but rather the exposition of individual character through small scenes that do not relate directly to the plot. Ozu often eschewed plot driven tales' heavyhandedness in favor of an anecdotal style that allowed things to emerge as a tale more organically, or naturally, without the contrivances that often occur in film....Ozu's films rise or fall on their little moments, when people do little things. There are scenes where the grandfather cuts Isamu's toenails, or when he tries to bribe Isamu into saying he loves him. He does it four times, but when grandpa stops bribing him Isamu gets snotty and says he hates the old man. Then the two brothers show their disappointment when Koichi comes home with a package they assume are toy train tracks. When they find out it's bread, call their father a liar, and kick the bread till the package breaks, Koichi spanks Minoru, and scolds him for abusing food- a no-no in a nation where food was still scarce after the war. Then there's a scene when the adults eat cake, and hide it from the boys, lest have to share it with them. These are the prosaic moments which aid in contrasting the greater moments. The very fact that so few other filmmakers include such `down' dramatic times, which are nevertheless fascinating, goes a long way in explaining the empyreal heights Ozu reaches in his films.
  Early Summer is an unjustly neglected classic, and a great film, every bit the equal of its two more celebrated cousins in the Noriko Trilogy, which takes its place alongside Ingmar Bergman's Spider Trilogy, Michelangelo Antonioni's L'Alienation Trilogy, and Krzysztof Kieslowski's Three Colors Trilogy as one of the great accomplishments of cinema. In fact, it is probably the best of the trilogies mentioned, for it is the only one where all three films that comprise it are unequivocally great films. While it's great to be in good company, to rise above that company is even better. Ozu does, no matter where or when you watch his films.",1221004800,6,4294,4.854024556616644
845407,5,6304313446,"In my opinion, Early Summer is Ozu's most beautiful film.  The heroine, Setsuko Hara has never been so radiant in her beauty and goodness.  Her unselfishness and personal conviction triumph over intense familial and cultural pressures.  In standing up for herself, she awakens within her family a greater understanding and acceptance of the realities of love and life.  Her conversation with her sister about her decision on the beach is perhaps my favorite scene in all cinema.

Rarely is a film so real, so sad, yet with an ending of profound peace and acceptance.  If you love Ozu, this will be one to come back to over and over.",1206144000,3,632,4.752293577981652
845408,5,6304313446,"Simple yet poignant, this beautifully photographed story of Japanese family life and the changing role of women in postwar society contrasts the values of elders and the impulses of youth, an abiding theme in Ozu's deeply humanistic oeuvre. Longtime muse Hara is exquisite in the role of Noriko, the put-upon daughter who incautiously agrees to marry a friend of her brother over an unfeeling suitor 12 years her senior. A delicate exploration of tradition and cultural change, ""Early Summer"" is a masterpiece of compassionate storytelling.",1182729600,3,540,5.364705882352941
845409,5,6304313446,"I interpret this film as portraying the Buddhist insight of impermanence.

All things change and clinging to anything brings inevitable grief. This lesson is played out in the evolution of a family from a cohesive three generation family all living in one household to the scattering of the family as the younger generation moves away to establish their own households, leaving the parents alone.  There is a minor repetition of this theme with the portrayal of of an elderly uncle in declining health with failing hearing and mental acuity.",1174694400,5,541,5.067415730337078
845410,5,6304313446,"An absolute masterpiece. This is another take on the issue of 'Late Spring'(of which I wrote another review): How family changes along with the times.

It's NOT about the rights of women to decide whom to marry, or anything of that sort. Visually, I prefer 'Late Spring', but 'Early Summer' has a lot more issues and more depth in its narative. It really would take a whole book to tell all that this film points to, if it were at all possible. How can you you describe colors to someone who's born blind? That's why some people will say this is about women's rights. (The same kind of people who'd say that Jesus was a great philosopher -but not God- when, evidently, he was either God incarnate or a mad man).

""And Jesus said: 'For judgement I have come into this world, that those who do not see may see, and that those who see may be blind'. Then some of the Pharisees who were with Him heard these words, and said to Him, 'Are we blind also?' Jesus said to them, 'If you were blind, you would have no sin; but now you say, 'We see'. Therefore your sin remains."" (John 9:39-41)

For this reason I give up any hope of contributing to this film's understanding. Nothing better than the film itself. Simply stated: If you don't get to love this story, these characters, you have a spiritual malfunction.

The female protagonist, Setsuko Hara, is just lovable and wonderful. I can't imagine her doing any other role but those she does in Ozu's films. She is that natural. There are 3 generations in this family here; the newest one we are spoiling it. Too much love and no discipline is no good. Watch the symbolic scene where the grandpa gives candy to the little one. See the results. Watch how grandpa reacts. He laughs. Yes, we are bringing our own destruction, day by day, and yet we laugh. Is it our fate, or can we do something about it?",1174176000,4,1845,4.41764705882353
845411,5,6304313446,"EARLY SUMMER  is not Ozu's greatest film, it is merely my personal favorite.  The reason is simple:  Noriko Mamiya, played by the incandescent Setsuko Hara, is one of the most fascinating, perverse, and peculiar female characters in all of world cinema.  Every viewing of EARLY SUMMER peels away new layers of her guilelessness, revealing more and more quiet audacity.

Noriko lives with her brother (Koichi), his wife, her elderly parents, and her brother's bratty young sons.  She dresses in simple western styles and works as a typist.  Koichi is an imperious man with old-fashioned ideas about the role of women, and he intimidates the whole family.  Except Noriko.  Not that she is ever defiant towards him, she has simply mastered the art of smiling deferentially and continuing along her own inscrutable path in life.

Her family, friends, neighbors, and professional associates all take note of her age (28!) and begin to pester her about getting married before it is too late:  Noriko smiles deferentially at every suggestion, insinuation, or act of coercion.  There is even some speculation that she might be a lesbian.

One member of her family is unable to advise Noriko, and that is Shoji, her older brother who has been M. I. A. since the war and is presumed (by any reasonable standard) to be dead.  Ozu is a master of evoking what is out of frame, continually reminding us that there is an unseen world that interacts with what he allows us to see.  The absent and lovingly remembered Shoji turns out to be a force that points Mamiya to her groom, a man who unites the family in his absolute unsuitability for Noriko.  In my favorite scene, Noriko denies to her friend Aya that she is in love with her intended--and then describes her exact feelings for him in words that perfectly define the phenomenon of being in love.

The new subtitles by Donald Ritchie are only at times preferable to the ones on older prints.  On the one hand, the bawdiness of some of the dialogue is much more clear in Ritchie's translation, but on the other hand the titles have become far more prosaic.  Sadly, the two best lines in the film have had all the poetry sucked out of them in this version.  I will give you the original translations, and you can read Ritchie's for yourself.  When Koichi finds his two sons abusing a loaf of bread, the translation of his outburst used to read, ""Don't kick food!""

Lastly, when the two elderly Mamiyas share a sandwich in a park, they see a toy balloon floating off into the sky.  In a perfect distillation of Yasujiro Ozu's ability to draw our attention to what is off screen, the husband's line of dialogue used to be, ""Somewhere a child is crying.""  Maybe Ritchie's is more accurate, but that was one line he should never have touched.",1169251200,12,2777,4.690082644628099
845474,5,6304313446,"As many people have noted, Early Summer (or Bakushu, made in 1951) is easy to confuse with another movie by Ozu made during the same period: Late Spring (1949). Aside from the references to the seasons in the title, both deal with the ""problem"" of the Setsuko Hara character (she of the ever wonderful smile) still being unmarried in her late twenties. (Ironically, in real life, Setsuko Hara never married and become something of a recluse in later years). Curiously, Chishu Ryu, who played her father in Late Spring, plays her brother in Early Summer. The slight plot deals with the pressure and machinations made by the extended family to find a suitable husband for her. When she finally does find a husband, however, is not the one they were expecting. Her new husband would have to move to another city for job reasons soon, and that means the splintering of her family: without her contribution to the rent (she works as a tourist guide, as so many young unmarried women in Japanese movies of the 1950s), the family will not be able to afford living in the same house. Her actions would eventually mean the return of her parents to the countryside. That means the movie ends in a bittersweet note: on the one side, Hara has attained some degree of freedom in choosing her own spouse, but for her family, this freedom would end up hurting them financially and emotionally.",1168387200,6,1378,4.698347107438017
845475,5,6304313446,"The familiar themes of Ozu are once again on display in this heart warming masterpiece of marriage and a womans right to choose. Set in post-war Japan, the film stars the usual Ozu actors: (Chishu Ryu) and the magnificent (Setsuko Hara). The film opens with the three generation Mamiya family undergoing a generational crises. [A common theme in Ozu's films]. There have been many changes now that the war is over. One of these is the infusion of western values, and how these changes are altering Japan. And nowhere is this more felt than in the traditional values and lives of the Japanese household.

The film focuses on Noriko (Setsuko Hara), who is the 28-year-old daughter which the family believes does not want to marry. This becomes serious in the Mamiya household, as tradition states that the older she gets, the more difficult it will be for her to find a suitable husband to marry later on in her life: Time is of extreme importance. Moreover, the family must approve of the husband as tradition dictates: For the family, this decision is extremely important in Japanese society, and it is important that Noriko marry someone of a higher status. Yet Noriko's independence [she has her own job helping to support the family] is considered disrespectful to the old traditions of Japan.

Ozu as usual has created a masterful and profound film dealing with a genrerational conflict. The changes occuring in Japan during the time of the filming shows [not tells] the societal changes that are also occuring throughout Japan. The Mamiya family is but one small snapshot of the changes that are occuring in this new Japan. And yet, there are the traditional family values that still remain. The film's nuances, which Ozu was remarkable in creating are infused throughout the film. This is a masterpiece of cinemea, and belongs in your film collection. The CRITERION DVD is great, and well worth the purchase. The film is beautiful and profound. Highly recommended. [Stars: 5+]",1166227200,4,1982,4.931137724550898

The commentary is both interesting and very detailed, allowing us to get even more out of the movie by giving us information about the film, the actors and director.  The story is simple - the family is trying to find a husband for the daughter.  Noriko ends up finding one on her own (a friend who is also a doctor) and, by doing so without the family's input, pulls the family apart.  In the 1950s, when people got married, the wife ended up (much of the time) joining the household of the husband's side of the family.  Everything was carefully planned and families got bigger - not smaller.  The idea of the next generation LEAVING the house (or going to another town) is not a Japanese one at the time and, therefore, what seems normal to us (or to the Japanese now) was heart breaking and sad to the movie-goers in the 1950s.

845479,5,6304313446,"Having just enjoyed the quiet brilliance of Yasujiro Ozu's ""Tokyo Monogatari (Tokyo Story)"" for the first time last week, I was immediately drawn to another Ozu film released by the Criterion Collection last year, 1951's ""Bakushu (Early Summer)"". Both movies are part of his classic Noriko trilogy which uses many of the same actors playing characters with the same names but in different roles. Consequently, the great Setsuko Hara portrays a young woman named Noriko in both movies, but this time, she is the liberated daughter (rather than the forlorn daughter-in-law) and also the focal point of the story (rather than the aged parents in ""Tokyo Story"").

The musical chairs continue with Chishu Ryu playing his real age as Noriko's strong-willed brother Koichi (rather than the resigned grandfather) and Haruko Sugimura playing older as neighbor Tomi, the mother of Noriko's prospective fiancee (versus the conniving daughter Shige). Chieko Higashiyama still plays the grandmother, but her name is not Tomi but Shige, and her husband Shukishi is portrayed by Ichiro Sugai. It's only confusing if you are looking for some kind of plot continuity between the films, but Ozu is primarily interested in reinforcing similar themes of the evolving family unit in post-WWII Japan. This time, he does it in a more comic, sometimes even ribald fashion, and while it doesn't resonate quite as deeply as ""Tokyo Story"", ""Early Summer"" is full of Ozu's shrewd observations and insights that make it emotionally affecting, especially as the story takes a surprise turn toward the end.

The story here centers on the Mamiya family, who are trying to find a suitable husband for 28-year old single daughter Noriko. As typical in Japanese culture, several generations live together under one roof, and a frequent subject of conversation is Noriko's lack of a husband. However, she is a member of the new postwar breed of Japanese women. She dresses almost exclusively in Western clothes and holds down an administrative position in an office in the heart of Tokyo. In spirit, Noriko bears a strong resemblance to Elizabeth Bennett in Jane Austen's ""Pride and Prejudice"", a point raised by film historian Donald Richie on his informative commentary. She loves to go to dinner with her girlfriends. Of the four friends, two are married and two are unmarried. In a particularly amusing scene, the four have a spirited debate about the pros and cons of married life versus single life.

Noriko is happy with her life as it is and doesn't seem to be too concerned with changing it anytime soon. Nonetheless, the family attempts to fix Noriko up with a successful, 40-year old business associate of her boss. Although polite about the matchmaking effort, she becomes more interested in her neighbor, an old classmate now widowed and left alone with a small daughter and his mother. Noriko prefers that her potential husband is an old friend and that they will slip into their new romantic relationship more easily than two complete strangers. The bigger problem, though, is that she makes her decision without consulting with her family and that's where the familial conflict arises.

Hara continues to be a revelation to me, a beautiful, charismatic actress who radiates goodness and a sense of cunning mischief that is entrancing. The supporting performances are excellent with Sugimura again a standout in a surprising turn as the mother grateful to Noriko for her decision to marry her son Kenkichi. Kuniko Miyake has a bigger, more dimensional role here than in ""Tokyo Story"", playing yet again the brother's wife Fumiko. She and Hara have a particularly lovely scene on the beach at the end of the film, and the two have a pretty funny scene where they hide their clandestine cake slices from the somnambulant child.

Chikage Awashima portrays Noriko's best friend Aya with feisty charm, goading Noriko to see the man she passed up, impersonating a country bumpkin to preview Noriko's new married life and trading innuendo-heavy barbs with Noriko's politically incorrect boss. This latter interchange is surprisingly adult for 1951, as they even joke that Noriko may be a lesbian for waiting so long to get married. The children play more prominent roles here, and Ozu really plays up their bratty insubordination as they hurl inappropriate epithets when they don't get their way, though their running away from home is the catalyst for Noriko to become attracted to Kenkichi.

Yuuharu Atsuta provides the beautiful cinematography, which is gratefully captured in a fairly pristine print of the film, though I have to believe Ozu is the one most responsible for the simple yet powerful scene compositions. His now familiar low-to-the ground camera angles are used consistently in the film to replicate the perspective of someone sitting on a tatami mat. Lighter and more loosely structured than ""Tokyo Story"", ""Early Summer"" is essential viewing for Ozu aficionados and anyone interested in post-WWII Japanese society. Along with Richie's thorough commentary, the DVD package also includes a 47-minute documentary, ""Ozu's Films From Behind the Scenes"", which includes a table discussion with Ozu's longtime cameraman Takashi Kawamata, his sound and editing assistant Kojiro Suematsu and producer Shizuo Yamanouchi who produced six Ozu films.",1118448000,13,5329,5.190697674418605

The beautiful Setsuko Hara gives a fine performance as Noriko. Her performance is breathtaking, and she is given a strong supporting cast to work with. The film's dazzling cinematography captures both the striking interiors and the dazzling beauty of the Japanese landscape. While it isn't the greatest film experience of all time, it is a beautifully realized motion picture that every person should view at least once.

845481,5,6304313446,Early Summer has moments of supreme excellence that rival Ozu's best films ('tokyo story' and 'floating weeds' also released by criterion are two of them). There are some very memorable shots as well as Ozu's fine cast of stock actors - performing another touching family story. The central theme of the film is marriage - but it also seems to deal with changes in life - and eventually leads to a sort of falling apart taking place within a family structure - and perhaps a larger societal structure. Ozu's films are modern and yet classical - as many have said - embracing an almost theatrical style - interspersed with interesting camera shots - that help the viewer to meditate on the film - and life itself. Early Summer is perhaps not as sad as 'Tokyo Story' but it is an equally poignant account of Japanese life - and comments on the constant battle between generations.,1099440000,6,878,4.670967741935484
845482,5,6304313446,"Early Summer is set in post-war Japan where three generations of the Mamiya family share space under the same roof.  The film opens intriguingly with a regular morning with symbolic shots of the Mamiya house with singing birds in birdcages and the morning duties of the family which suggests the natural rang order of the family.  These two cinematic elements play a big role in the overall cinematic experience as it refers to duty, tradition, and other values of a Japanese family.  The Mamiya's are the middle of a generational crisis influenced by peers, new cultures, and the aftermath of a war, which will have a significant effect on old Japanese traditions and values.

The story is focused on Noriko, a 28-year-old daughter, who the rest of the family is lightheartedly implying is one of those women that never wants to get married.  Yet, the notion that Noriko will not get married is worrisome for the Mamiya family as it is tradition to marry and the older she gets the harder it will be for her to find a suitable husband that the family will approve of.  The approval of the family is crucial as it will reflect on the parents position in the society as it is important to marry someone of higher status.  Noriko is also a woman of her time as she changes with the times and has a job that helps support the family.  Her independence is considered by family members as disrespectful towards the old traditions, and it also worries the family.  Despite what others think Noriko wanders her own way with a good spirit, which seems to reflect upon those around her.

Osu created a brilliant film when he worked on Early Summer in the early 50s as he captures the societal changes within Japan through one single family.  The changes that Ozu presents are sincere as they are not always pleasant, yet the changes will help the people grow in several different ways.  It is within the change that the key to the story rests as it presents a thick fabric of artistry with numerous thoughts that will hopefully open several doors to debate.  Early Summer is a cinematic event of historical proportions that will remain influential for many years to come.",1090886400,10,2162,4.672823218997362

Set in Ozu's Kamakura City, and a hospital in Tokyo where two of the characters are doctors, the pace of the film is quiet, intersecting stands rising and falling

At the time of its making, 1951, arranged marriages were still very common in Japan, and often successful.  As late as the Studio Ghibli Omoide Poro Poro of 1991 there is an echo of a famous scene in Early Summer - when a rural grandmother explicitly suggests to a visiting city girl that she should marry her grandson (finally she does).  In Early Summer itself, the mother of a widower neighbour tells Noriko that she had a 'dream' that Noriko might marry her son - to which a deeply moved Noriko says ""You'd have me?"" - the widowed son is never consulted, his mother simply announcing it will happen!

But there are many more strands in Early Summer - ranging from the high cost of strawberry cake and household economies, to the breaking up of families.  As always in Ozu, the 'big' events such as weddings happen off screen - though Early Summer ends with the parents moving to a farmhouse near Nara (in 'Yamato') where in the closing scene they watch a wedding party thread their way through the fields...",1492473600,,1427,4.642857142857143

Director: Yasujiro Ozu
DVD
1951
Rating = ***

Film = barely three (3) stars; subtitles = two (2) stars; restoration = five (5) stars.  Director Yasujiro Ozu's yearly episode for 1951 in his ongoing, de facto TV series at the movies.  You've seen most of this movie before (and will see it again) as the Director remains stuck in a creative funk in most of his post WW II films.  The photoplay is ponderous at the dramatic (there are too many trivial line readings) and technical (the camera moves in about 4-5 shots) levels, often boring, and much too long.  Virtually the same multi-generational household remains focused on the same obsession:  marrying off its members.  The adult lead actresses and actors (who are some of the best of their generation) save this movie from the trash can (as they do in other iterations by the Director).  They could read the list of ingredients on food labels and still charm the viewer; and compensate for the Director's fondness for ""back acting"" (where the camera remains fixed on the backs of speaking characters!).  Subtitles need to be seriously reworked; this time with adult grammatical supervision.  They are far too long and often inaccurate.  Cinematography (old-format narrow screen, back and white) seems technically stuck in the 1930's and would look better on small TV screens than in theaters.  (This ancient style of presentation could have only helped to accelerate the decline of contemporary paying customers in view of the concurrent rise of free TV.)  Film music is a mash up of choirs, a celeste, and faint, inferior elevator music.  Except for the choirs accompanying the opening and closing credits, it seems to have been placed on the sound track almost at random! Restoration is excellent!  Skip this one unless you are a diehard fan of the leading actresses and actors.  WILLIAM FLANIGAN, PhD.",1423353600,,1883,4.964856230031949

7868154,3,6304313446,"I saw this movie as part of an international film series at one of our local community colleges.  The movie is interesting in that it gives insights into a perhaps typical middle class Japanese family of that era - post-war Japan.  Featured was an extended family and everyone in that family (except perhaps the kids) and their friends were all almost obsessed with getting one of the women in the family married off and controlling, if they could, her choice of husband.  They were all a lot more concerned about it than was she.

The movie is from 1951 and it was very interesting to me to reflect on how it foreshadowed some aspects of today's Japan where more and more women are foregoing marriage and many who do marry choose not to have children to the point where the birth rate is dropping.

Setsuko Hara as the lead is gorgeous, and a real standout among the actors.",1395446400,,875,4.512658227848101
