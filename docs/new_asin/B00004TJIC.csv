8479362,1,B00004TJIC,"I bought this video because it was the only one I could find on the Chito-Ryu style, and I really wanted something to illustrate techniques and especially the Kata.
When it arrived I eagerly tore off the wrapping & slotted it in the player.  I was rewarded with an appalling, flickering, yellowed image jumping about on the screen.  Yes, I do have the multisystem player to read the video properly and the heads are clean.  This is the true quality of the material on the tape.
It was filmed in 1967 or so, poorly, and with a very dated commentary.  It shows some karateka working out, and a few block-breaking demos that are of such dismal quality that no useful information can be gained about the technique.  There is also some footage from the Canadian competition of that year, including a rather good (and apparently famous) kumite bout and some medal-awarding.  This is also not very illuminating, and of equally disastrous quality as the rest.
In summary, an afficionado of Chito Ryu might find the tape wonderful, full of historical merit and rare images of bygone experts, including footage of the originator of the style himself.  As a practical guide to learnig the discipline or studying technique, forget it!",972777600,12,1222,4.818181818181818
