1313958,2,B00003CY5P,"There turned out to be very little of interest in this formula teen flick.  It tries too hard to be a serious examination of the two leads' lives, but it doesn't dig deep enough.  Kirsten Dunst saves it from a 1 star rating, because she is radiant and with performances like this one she'll go far.  But don't pay money to see this.",1007596800,,332,4.238095238095238
1313959,5,B00003CY5P,"Crazy / Beautiful is a great movie where you can feel the pain and struggles of everyday teenagers.  I love this movie because I can really relate to how Kirsten Dunst is treated by Jay Hernandez's family in the movie.  My own family treats me the same way.  It is an educational and interesting love story.  It's not at all a ""teenager movie"" . . . my mom even likes it!  ;)",1006387200,,375,4.152777777777778
1313960,5,B00003CY5P,"I got Crazy/Beautiful as soon as it came out. Im glad I did. Worth the wait. Its very emotional and dramatic. I think its Jay's biggest and bestest piece for now and for a while to come. He did great as Carlos. Proviong wrong the stereotype. I want to see Jay in more movies like this. Kirsten did awesome, different from before. Crazy/Beautiful is very original, with an excellent cast, the min characters and the others (Carlos' friends and Maddy)Defiantly a must see.",1005955200,,470,4.674698795180723
1313961,5,B00003CY5P,"Not that I'm trying to deny the fact that I have a thing for teen movies, but I think this counts for more than that. I didn't think so at first; I went to see it because it looked ""cute"" and Kirsten Dunst was in it. But I found myself enjoying the plot more and more; Nicole's emotional problems, that I could relate to, her love for photography, which I sjared, and the couple's realationship, which was oh-so-cute. It has a great soundtrack, and I found myself laughing at many parts in the movie, as well, which is always a bonus. One of the best ""teen"" movies out there.",1005868800,,575,4.284403669724771
1313962,5,B00003CY5P,"i  rented this thinking ok time to numb my brain because kirsten dunst has funny charectors
most of the time but this time she can play serious anyday. nicole is a wild girl always getting
 drunk and carlos is the good boy that loves her. the story is simple kinda like the story of me
 and my ex girlfriend. i loved this movie and would watch it anyday. rent this instead of the strange americas sweethearts which i expected to write a revie on but forget that.  this was  much better.",1005696000,,486,4.2967032967032965
1313963,4,B00003CY5P,"ok. where do i start? First of all, i feel that this movie is extremely intense and emotional. in the beggining of the movie, i was like, ""ok, its one of those movies again...the ones that you sit and watch, laugh or cry a little, and then go home"". For some reason, something metaphysical, i felt involved in the movie, almost as if the movie knew what buttons or corners of my heart to press and go to to make me feel the way i felt. i feel that Jay hernandez played a very good role, and also gave us latinos a very good reputation for playing the role of the school-going, reasonable, healthy ego-driven person. I give him alot of credit. On the other hand, with Kirsten Dunst, i feel that the role she played was very realistic and tragic...she was doomed throughout the entire movie, against all odds, and lonely as loneliness itself (even though she was with him, there was still a sense of isolation.) She also did very well in portraying the personage of the i-dont-know-where-i'm-headed-but-im-going-anyway type of person, someone we all are inside but are afraid of expressing it. I also give her lots of credit. You go girl! At a corner of all this, i also noticed that there was a little bit of stereotype, check out all the stuff in Jay hernandez' bathroom (when she looks in the mirror), it's very disorganized and filled with lots of bathroom stuff. I mean, it's true that we latinos are a little disorganized and jumbled, but i think they overexpressed it in that scene. It was almost like an exxagerated hint to how we live (us latinos). But all in all, it was a beautiful movie. I recommend it to anyone who wants to have a clear understanding of the cultural diffrences and the things we humans do to love one another. In a nutshell, the moral of the movie i think is that we should love without letting anything get in the way (for example, race, color, cultural beliefs, etc...). We should let ourselves be driven by pure emotion. People! put away the diffrences for once.
(and no, he was not ""there"" in the end when she spoke with her father, it was her super-ego finally kicking in, he just helped her use it the right way. pay close attention to the scenes in the hotel, what did he do to her? how did she change so drastically?)
Adios.",999820800,7,2261,4.463768115942029

1314109,5,B00003CY5P,"I saw this movie on tv in high school and loved it. It's a wrong side of the tracks romance. Nicole is the out of control rich daughter whose only goal in life is to have the best time, whether it's by partying or by doing drugs. She has no real interest in school or her stepmother. Carlos wants to get into the naval academy and studies his butt off. The two meet and slowly fall in love, but it seems like everything is trying to keep them apart. It's a nice teen love story with very few laughs. Every time Nicole slips up, you feel bad for her but wish she'd get her act together. It's not that she's a bad person, but she lost her mother when young and that had a heavy effect on her. Carlos has a rough home life, and no one sees why his dream is so important to him and it's very easy to sympathize with him. It's a very sweet movie with a nice ending.",1478217600,,860,3.976878612716763

1314354,4,B00003CY5P,"My first thought as I was streaming Crazy/Beautiful was that I didn't particularly care for how they set up the love storyline between Kirsten Dunst and Jay Hernandez. While I got the Romeo and Juliet aspect of it, I thought it was set up entirely too quickly. It felt like they were kissing after ten minutes. Just a perception. For the first 1/3 or  the movie, I thought it was a hip upgrade to Romeo and Juliet, but then it got me

This Romeo and Juliet story is different, but I would totally spoil the movie if I said what it was. Lets just say that shes not your typical Juliet. From the point of that reveal on, the movie seized my attention and lived up to the sort of beloved status that it holds among many within the teen movie genre. If you stick with Crazy/Beautiful, youll probably like it, but that is the great challenge.",1451433600,,837,4.32484076433121

1315115,5,B00003CY5P,"I rarely give a movie 5 stars but this one struck a cord with me. It's a moving, heartfelt story that I found refreshing.

At first the movie appears to be voyeuristic exhibition of adolescent rebellion and excess but it soon becomes apparent that it is something much more as it develops it a serious drama that compelling relates why the heroine is the way that she is and does so in a way that is quite compelling. The script's actually quite skillfully written. The film deals the serious and dark themes of reality but is ultimately very uplifting. Uplifting without being naive, in my opinion.
Carlos who the heroine falls in love with is a very likable, responsible genuinely good person and one can't help but admire and empathize with him. The heroine, to some may seem off-putting initially because of her flamboyance and wild ways but is also a character one is drawn to relate to and empathize with. And this is a strength of this movie. You really care about the characters and what they are going through.
The movie has a strong and emotionally moving climax.

The film feels grounded in reality. Carlos come from a poor, working class mexican-american neighborhood. The heroine comes from rich and privileged family. Her father has remarried and his wife has the attitudes and anxieties that can arise from a flawed individual in high society. And all these situations and backgrounds are well portrayed. The movie is also perfectly paced. It doesn't drag out and get boring nor does it move too fast.

I'm not one who usually watches these kinds of movies. I tend to watch hard action movies, art films, thriller/horror films and most of these are foreign films because frankly, most hollywood movies suck.
So this review isn't coming from a tearful sentimentalist who keeps a tissue box close at hand as they watch romance after romance. I do have a sensitive side but anyways, all that to say that this review isn't coming from someone who is easily moved by anything and everything.

I highly recommend this movie. It is a moving, heartfelt romance that deal with both the happy and the dark realities of life. The characterization is phenomenal, as well as the character development.
Highly recommended.",1354492800,,2223,4.81151832460733

This one starts out with a tough latino boy and a trashy white girl and sets up the viewer for an I've-seen-this-1000-times-before film, but none of the characters are who or what you expect from outward appearances. The pounding beat of the music and the risky situations the two put themselves in make the film tough to watch in spots; at other times it is borderline sappy. I found both these swings to be a realistic representation of life in the teenage years. Kirsten Dunst (girlfriend in spiderman) is an amazing actress and Jay Hernandez is absolutely beautiful, too -- both are exceptional in the role of conflicted teens and have a powerful chemistry together.",1312675200,,740,4.880952380952381

Kirsten plays a trashy highschool student who is too reckless for her own good.  Her father tries to do his best by her so her behavior is not warranted in the least way.  She's supposed to be a rebelling teen but it was just way over the top and made no sense.  The romantic relationship is not properly developed with her and Jay Hernandez so you are left wondering what he sees in this girl in the first place?  Not one thing about her was attractive prior to him falling so deeply in love with her so their romance was rushed and very fake.

I was tired of the constant conversations in Spanish with no subtitles.  What is the point of that?  Either show subtitles or speak English. Using a language that not everyone knows keeps them disconnected for those scenes in the film.

I like all the actors in this movie. I can't believe this movie has been out 10 years, time sure goes by. Nicole ( Kristen Dunst ) only wants to be loved, and for someone to accept her for who she is, I can relate to that. Eventually everyone wants to be loved. This movie is emotional at times. Sometimes love will take over, especially if the love is that great. Love can distract you from important things in life, but sometimes it doesn't matter. I lost my grandma recently, I can relate to Nicole, it's hard to lose your Mom like that it's very hard. I think love saved Nicole. Nicole always wanted her father to be there for her, but the relationship wasn't always that great. Nicole is going through a lot in her life, and she wants to be loved for who she is. If you find true love never runaway, because you'll regret it in the end. It's worth sacrificing even the important things in life for love.

However, this movie has no passion, nothing to make me see how these two fell in love, and no ""ah"" factor. It simply involved a girl who drank, used drugs, and was out of control and a boy who was a real straight arrow. Unlike most films the rich and White female was the one out of control (in more ways than one) while the poor and minority male was the straight arrow- refreshing. Yet this is where the refreshness ends. While most of these type of movies have two opposites falling for each other in this case they were two polar opposites and their ""love"" seemed shallow- based on teenage hormones that ran rampant on both ends (though more so on hers.) Don't waste ur money. By the way I gave this film a two because I was about to turn it off when it got better though did not exceed much- therefore I give the first third a 1 and the rest a 3.

1315285,5,B00003CY5P,"I've always been an advocate for Kirsten Dunst.  I feel she's a brilliantly talented actress who chooses challenging and engaging roles for herself.  She shines in just about everything and continues to impress me with each selected performance.  That said, I was forced to see this movie.  It just looked to me like another in a long line of recycled and regurgitated teen love stories that plays out the same way and never initiates any real care or concern on the part of the audience.  I did however see this film, in the theater at that, and have to say that by the films end I was in complete shock.  `Crazy/Beautiful' is a genuinely great film, from the script to the acting to the films execution.  While the subject material may appear like `Romeo & Juliet' light, it veers enough from its pre-chosen path to establish originality and demand rewatchability.

`Crazy/Beautiful' casts Dunst as trouble child Nicole, a misunderstood daughter of a wealthy congressman who battles her stepmother every step of the way and vies for attention through one screw up after another.  She doesn't take anything serious, not school, not boys, not anything but then she by chance meets Carlos, a boy who is her complete opposite.  Carlos studies hard, gets up extra early to travel a long distance to attend a good school so he can make something of himself.  He takes everything seriously, that is until he meets Nicole.  Their relationship is explosive and, according to their families, dangerous.  Nicole's father even pleads with Carlos to stay far away from his daughter, not because he's concerned for her well being but because he's concerned for Carlos, fearing that Nicole with ruin him.  It's in these small changes that `Crazy/Beautiful' distinguishes itself apart from the other fluff.

As the film progresses we can see the relationship between the two of them bend and break only to reform stronger than before.  It's actually a realistic look at teenage relationships today.  Of course it's dramatized for Hollywood but if you really take a second to analyze what you're watching you'll see that it all rings forth very true.  Nicole is far from a bad child, just a misunderstood one who craves love and attention she's not receiving from those who should be handing it out to her unconditionally.  What I love most about this film is that instead of really painting Nicole's father and stepmother as downright evil they are portrayed realistically, as confused adults who have no idea how to handle someone they feel is bucking them constantly.  As much as the audience is persuaded to hate the stepmother I feel that in the end she's given credibility.  This is a film that exposes the faults of all parties involved.

What really drives this film home is the powerful performance given by Kirsten Dunst.  She's amazing here, giving so much genuine emotion, investing so much heart into Nicole that she breathes to life before us.  Dunst is effective throughout, but scenes like her drunken breakdown at the feet of her father are especially effective, awards worthy even.  How this girl keeps escaping Oscar's eye is beyond me.  Newcomer Jay Hernandez is wonderful as well as Carlos and proves he has what it takes to light up the screen, but against Dunst riveting performance he's a little dry.  I was very pleased with Bruce Davison's portrayal of Nicole's father and of course was smitten with Taryn Manning who just explodes with charm and charisma as Nicole's BFF Maddy.  Great film overall, one that desires to be looked at and beautifully lives up to its name.",1183939200,,3581,4.874380165289256
1315286,4,B00003CY5P,"John Stockwell's CRAZY/BEAUTIFUL describes a conformist love story in an environment that doesn't react the way it should react. In a mainstream movie, the Mexican parents of Carlos Nuez would have cherished Nicole Oatley with the usual Latin warmth and Nicole's family would have rejected Carlos because of his social and race background. Congressman Tom Oakley, even if he's a member of the Democrat party, wouldn't have accepted that his daughter sees the son of a chicano. Thanks to the unusual handling of this love story, in addition to the exceptional performance of Kirsten Dunst, CRAZY/BEAUTIFUL deserves to appear in your rental list.

The way Nicole and Carlos complete each other is incredible.  At first, Nicole is lost and destructive.  The solid schedule of homework, football practice, and family obligations deteriorates for Carlos as he becomes engulfed in Nicole's world of chaos and drama.  But their love is something real, strong enough to make everything change.  Carlos realizes that he has to make sacrifices in order to save Nicole from herself, and Nicole realizes that she's ready to become the person she's always wanted to be.  Carlos helps her find the way home.

The story, while it's been done before, has never quite been done this well.  Nicole (Dunst in one of her BEST performances to date) is a rich girl with a wild side who continues to stress her father and push her stepmother further away.  Carlos (Hernandes in his breakout role) on the other hand is a poor boy trying hard to make the best of himself, traveling further than need be, waking up earlier than need be, all to get a better education and get a chance to be something bigger than he is.  When they meet it's lust at first sight, but as they grow together they realize how much they need each other.  This is a touching family film that shows well how a childs feeling of neglect and unwantedness can damage there relationships and even result in their inability for better relationships in the future.  Kirsten Dunst is truly a star and she shines so much in this film delivering what has to be her most stunning and commanding performance to date.

Hernandez on the other and is a cutiepie and an ok actor. Dunst's character Nicole is mentally-disturbed and her love for Carlos is threatened when her dad (Bruce Davidson) tries to end their relationship.

1315291,5,B00003CY5P,"Have you read a P.K.Dick novel ""Do Androids Dream Of Electric Sheep""? Main plot contains a characteristic that lets discriminate between people and well-oiled machines. It tests (or tries to test) for empathy. Now, if you are a sci-fi fan you know what telepathy is. I guess you know what's that even if you are definitely *not* a sci-fi fan. What I want to talk about is teleempathy. Empathy lets you feel what it feels like when you are that other person, any person, even not a *real* person and experiencing an emotional state of any kind. Love, for example. Teleempathy is something *more*. It's a gift letting you to *make* other people to feel how it really feels like when you are feeling something you are both calling using the example word, ""love"" or *make* other people to feel what it *really* means when you are feeling what the other person is feeling or even what she is feeling about that feeling of hers (reflexion). It lets you *teach* her (or him or anyone) what the word ""love"" means. They might know it's *meaning*, they don't know what it *means*. If you are teleempathic, you can *teach* the other. What I think is it's not just a happy ending by divine intervention, Kirsten Dunst's character has teleempathic gift (and yes, it *must be* a genetic trait) and it is a powerful one. She managed to *make* two well-oiled machines (her father and lover) to understand what the word means. The example word. That ""love"" word they were using *before* without knowing what it means. She *made* them to  learn to love *for real*. She knows not of her teleempathic abilities (a 7 or even 9), you don't need be taught how to smell or taste, no awareness is required. She'll probably think she was saved by brave, loving men. She is (ironic and funny and what made me to write that review in the first place) right and wrong - that is because the word means now the same thing to them and it's not a coincidence. That word, you know. Love. Think about it. I recommend this movie to anyone who even once in a life-time tried to comprehend the ""in love"" phrase, tried to explain it to someone (yourself?). No, dictionary is not the right place to look up what *love symbol means*, what ""it"" (the other person ""using"" the symbol to convey meaning from waterfalls of nuances, probably) tries to tell you. Dictionary contains the symbolic meaning of a symbol, a symbolic definition (or an attempt at computationally complete definition, though probably just a construct derivative of circular logic).

1315292,3,B00003CY5P,"There was just something not quite right about this movie, whether it was the fact that it was rated PG13 (scenes were cut as it was originally an R), or the fact it was highly cliched, with the pretty, rich, messed up white girl falling in love with a poor Latino boy. Either way Kirsten Dunst was the only good thing about this movie.

Even though she was severely skinny in this movie, and she was greasy haired, and not wearing a scrap of makeup most of the time, she played it well, though, for me, her skinniness is severely distracting. Give the girl a good feeding, she's skin & bone.

This film could have done well or even better with a higher rating. Instead of a scene where Kirsten leaves the bedroom naked to get some contraception, we get her leaving in a cut off t-shirt and underwear (something tells me Kirsten had something to do with that more than anything). I definitely think the PG13 rating made this film fall flat on its face.

There have also certainly been some other scenes left on the cutting room floor, as there's a subplot with some other Latino girls verbally attacking Kirsten's character Nicole, with no reason, although it seems the whole ""white girls taking our men"" comes to light here.

Nicole's love of photography in this plays a big part, and over the end credits, it shows some of the photos she's taken during her relationship with the guy (who's name I forget), and there's some really cute pics of the two of them together. Even if sometimes their faces are chopped in half, it's still those photos that make you go ""aaaaaahhhhh"".

Overall it's an OK film, if not slightly boring in parts, and as I've already said, an R rating would have been better than the lame PG13 it ended up getting.",1124150400,,1737,4.501587301587302
1315293,3,B00003CY5P,"""Crazy/Beautiful"" made me cringe a few times.  It was kind of like watched two drunk, underage girls gyrate on a table in an inappropriate setting.  That seems like a good metaphor, plus I just described one of the key scenes in the movie, where Nicole (Kirsten Dunst) and her friend do exactly that at a shabby taco joint.

The story line is fairly simple: two young people fall in love even though their families are against their relationship and live happily ever after.  These two young people happen to be a depressed, rich white girl (Nicole) with few prospects and a hard-working Mexican immigrant (Carlos) who excels in school and sports.  You know exactly what's going to happen at the end of the movie, but watching the two lovebirds struggle to achieve happiness is largely enjoyable.

The two main actors Dunst and Hernandez play their parts well.  The story is fairly fast-paced with a few good plot twists.  The character development is ok, but for an ""unconventional"" love story, it seems to be full of clichs: the white girl who supposedly has everything is neglected by her rich father and emotionally unstable, the Mexican guy has to work ten times harder than everyone else to prove himself and succeeds.  There are lots of people like this in real life, the characters ARE believable, but I never quite understood why a guy like Carlos would fall for a girl like Nicole?!  Maybe it's just the raging hormones high school students have, but they did seem like a bit of an odd couple.

What is portrayed best in this movie is the lifestyle so many rich white children lead in their roomy, suburban mansions.  They are viewed as lucky and content by most, but they are usually the most lonely and confused in high school, and according to a magazine I read the other day three times more likely to take drugs than most inner city students.

Anyway, let's get back on track: I'd give this movie 3 out of 5 stars for a well acted, fairly interesting story.  Nothing all too provocative or new, but it has enough pleasures to carry the day.",1122768000,3,2055,4.640883977900552

The storyline is excellent, all about love and doing what is ""cool"" vs. what is responsible in high school.  I really enjoyed seeing Kirsten Dunst's character develop.  Both Dunst and Hernandez are excellent actors in this movie.

1315371,3,B00003CY5P,"I was just flipping through the channels the other night and caught the beginning of this film.  It looked like some cheaply made after-school special and so I just thought I'd watch some of it just out of curiousity.  But I have to admit that the more I watched, the more I fell under the film's spell.  On the whole, it is not a bad movie but I think the message it sends is shallow.

I can understand why teens in particular would like films like this, particularly those ""free spirit"" or ""rebel"" types.  Basically, the message is that love conquers all.  In this film we see two teens who have absolutely nothing in common fall in love with one another.  The girl is a rich white brat who does nothing but party and get drunk.  The boy is a poor hispanic kid who works hard to do well in school and has dreams of getting into Anapolis to become a Navy pilot.  They first meet each other on the beach and from that time on they start hanging out with one another.  Very early in the relationship, we see signs that the girl is no good for him.  The girl is a wild party animal and he is a clean-cut, upright and studious guy.  Against his mother and brother's wishes he continues to hang out with the troubled girl.  Even the girl's father recommends that he stay away from his daughter due to the fact that she will do nothing but take everything away that he worked so hard for.

After a point in the film, the girl becomes somewhat disillusioned to the fact that she is just wasting her life away and questions whether or not she is really good enough for him.  But this is only temporary.

The problems I have with this film are the following:

1) It doesn't emphasize some of the dangers associated with teen drug use.

2) The girl's behavior didn't get her in to enough trouble.  It was almost depicted as ok behavior for teens.

3) The film does not illustrate some of the dangers of involving yourself with people who really don't have anything in common with you and more often than not are up to no good.

4) One of the messages the films seems to send is that it's alright to follow your animalistic desires and everything will fall into place ok.",1103932800,3,2161,4.312655086848635

(I am not one of those people that have 100 favorite movies either)  I love everything about it.  It seems like a realistic version of Romeo and Juliet yet not like it at all.

1315418,4,B00003CY5P,"This was a surprisingly good movie.  It is directed by John Stockwell (Blue Crush) and stars Kirsten Dunst and Jay Hernandez.  The movie deals with some of the more common clich&eacute;s that abound in teen movies.  The difference is that Crazy/Beautiful handles these clich&eacute;s a little bit better than most.  This one takes the basic clich&eacute; of: a boy and a girl with very different backgrounds fall for each other.  Director John Stockwell does a very good job with this basic story.
The movie opens with Carlos (Hernandez) waking up before 5 am so he can eat breakfast and run out to catch the bus for a two hour ride to school.  This is a long trip just to go to school and it shows the dedication that Carlos has to his education.  He is there because he wants the education and opportunity that the better school can provide him, even if the cost is a two hour bus ride at 5:30 in the morning.  The movie shifts to Nicole (Dunst) waking up.  It is bright out and we see the contrast between her life and that of Carlos.  They have very different home environments.  It is obvious that while Carlos's neighborhood is not very good, his mother tries to do the best she can.  Nicole lives in a very nice house, but has a much worse home life.  A friend picks her up and Nicole gets to school the same time as Carlos.
We see very quickly that Nicole is a problem kid.  She skips classes, spends a lot of time drinking and talks about drugs.  Carlos is a good student and excels on the football field.  Carlos meets Nicole when she is doing community service as probation for a DUI.  They meet again at school and there is an obvious attraction.  They begin spending more and more time with each other.  Carlos's focus to his education and his priorities begin slipping as Nicole seems to be dragging him down.  However, Carlos and Nicole genuinely care for each other.
This is a story that has been told many times in many different ways, more often than not with a teen movie (it seems to work very well with youth).  The story is about tolerance, acceptance, and how love can be the impetuous for someone to change.  Surprisingly, this movie was a lot better than I expected and I was impressed by how the film did not preach nor talk down to the audience.  It was not as simplistic as it could have been, and for a teen film, this is a very good one.  As a movie, it is nothing special, but a whole lot better than it should have been.  Crazy/Beautiful is worth a rent.",1052784000,,2486,4.387308533916849

Dunst is a convincing as a mixed up California Congressman's daughter.

1315421,4,B00003CY5P,"Good romantic comedy teen flicks are often few and far between, but it's a pretty safe bet that anything involving the startlingly talented Kirsten Dunst is worth a look.  Crazy/Beautiful deals with rich city girl Nicole, who's off the rails (the 'crazy' Dunst) and her deepening relationship with the serious poor Hispanic kid, Carlos (the 'beautiful' Hernandez) who has aspirations of becoming a pilot.  As the movie progresses, happiness and smiles gives way to doubts and fears - will Nicole drag Carlos down with her?  Can Carlos resolve the tensions in his family with him dating a white girl?
Filmed in a gritty, grainy style it's clear from the start that although this might be no revelation Crazy/Beautiful at least sets itself out as a little different.  Dunst gives a typically fantastic turn as the troubled Nicole, managing to emote without ever seeming whiny or tiresome, a girl who sees her faults and hates herself for them and consequently falls headlong into them.  Such a complex (at least for a teen movie) role isn't easy to pull off and it's due to Dunst that we do actually care about the possibly noxious Nicole.  Unfortunately Hernandez's role is a lot more stereotypical, and the race issue was much better evoked in Save The Last Dance, but he's still an appealing performer who creates a realistic relationship with Nicole.
Although the trials and tribulations of the relationship will definitely give you a sense of deja-vu, Crazy/Beautiful is a gently moving film that not only promises great things for Dunst but also never feels compelled to fall into cheap violence to get a reaction.  The relationship is drawn out quietly and therefore emotes a great deal more than the histrionics that many directors of similar movies seem to opt for.  In addition there is a realistic portrayal of a troubled teenager in Nicole, and when we learn the root of her trauma it's a genuinely compelling moment.  With a beginning that's scattered with photographs and scrawlings this is an intimate film throughout and works all the better for it.  The ending may be cheesy but before that you'll find yourself impressed at its subtle differences in a pretty much dead genre.",1041465600,,2191,4.929347826086956

Nicole Oakley (Kirsten Dunst) is seemingly a lucky teenager, blessed with good looks and wealth, she lacks for nothing. Or does she? Carlos Nunez (Jay Hernandez), the son of a poor, Mexican single mother, is an intelligent teenager, also blessed with good looks. He is also his family's hope for the future.
Nicole carries a lot of baggage with her, due to some serious family issues she has yet to work out. She and Jay meet. He manages to see beneath her hard, wild, devil may care veneer. She realizes that Jay treats her as a person and not a boy toy. He manages to look below her hard exterior and sees her vulnerability, as well as her innate kindness, and is touched by it. They manage to fall in love but not without experiencing a few bumps on the road.
Having some serious self-esteem problems, however, Nicole is on a downward spiral towards complete self destruction, almost taking Jay with her. He basically pulls her out of the tailspin just before these star crossed lovers both crash land. For the viewer, it is, however, a ride well worth taking.
Kirsten Dunst gives a wonderful performance as the angst ridden Nicole. Jay Hernandez is excellent as the stalwart, hard working, teen from the barrio whose family is pinning all their hopes for the future on him. Burce Davison gives a very good performance as Nicole's tolerant, but bewildered, father who wants to make Nicole happy but does not know how to do so, until it is nearly too late.

There's a really great film to be made out of this kind of material, but `Crazy/Beautiful' isn't quite it. It's still good, but what lets it down is its style. A slightly more gritty, documentary-like approach might have made it feel more real.

It also played the Gotta-get-high-&-drunk and outcasts-are-the-coolest-people card. I would rather get one pap smear per hour for the rest of my life than watch this movie one more time!!! The only thing the main character did was act like a freaking baby and the male lead, to say he was so smart, was so stupid. He felt he had to clean up all of her messes and in effect almost screwed up his own future. Her father repeatedly tells him that she will (but he won't listen). I waited throughout this entire movie for it to get good..... and it did... in the last 10 seconds. Don't waste your time or money on this one, unless you just loved the movie When a Man loves a Woman (which I also hate)!",1022630400,2,870,4.477987421383648
1315597,5,B00003CY5P,"And that is saying a lot. this movie mesmerized me. I became a huge Kirsten fan after this movie, her acting is way beyond her years. I could tell what the character was thinking just from a tiny twinge in her eyebrows or a slight, barely perceptible smile. She plays someone very different from any character she's ever played and probably about as far away from who she really is as she could get. Brave, real, painful, performance. There is one scene where her heart is breaking and if I think about it enough, I can get myself crying. Kirsten allows herself to look and be ugly in this one. You love her all the more. The soundtrack is special, wonderful blend of rap, dance beats, melodic overlays, angry rock, peppy pop-like singalongs and ballards, totally addictive. Don't miss the extras where they talk about casting the smaller parts. Jay Hernandez is quite fine. Even my 70-something yo Mom commented on his hot body! Hope to see more of him (pun intended). ACtress who plays her best friend (please forgive me, I can't recall her name) is spot on. Bruce Davison is a scene stealer as her dad. He can't BE bad. Best thing about this movie is most of the characters have some good and some bad points, like real folks. The contrast between her world and his is important but not reduced to stereotypes, it just is revealed enough to carry the plot along. I'm looking forward to more from this director.",1021852800,,1413,4.566929133858268
1315598,4,B00003CY5P,"This one is not a typical teen movie.  I have no problem with teen movies because they have their problems, dreams, and  'teen reality'.  But too many cliched teen movies don't make a healthy viewing.  This one is a surprise.  For once I care about the characters.  Kirsten Dunst made a realistic portrayal of a hurting teen girl who's not yet equipped with good self-awareness to cope with her emotional and growing turmoil.  Jay Hernandez, forced to be mature early due to his background, instinctively became a stabling influence in her life.  I was feeling her pain and his dilemma through out the movie.  Although the ending was tidy, but I love to see two people made it.  Don't you?
The director, Mr. John Stockwell, showed a sincere effort to make this movie real and grounded.  He and his team also demonstrate effort to give real teens a chance to act.  I am sure this means a lot to those who auditioned (regardless they got a part or not).  He mentioned that it's not how hard you work or how good your work is that'll make you a famous star in the movie business during the making-of documentary.  I think this is one of the most honest statements made by an industry insider.",1020643200,2,1189,4.52112676056338
1315599,3,B00003CY5P,"Crazy Beautiful did not draw in big bucks at the box office. It did not have a cute blond cheerleader, and perhaps its characters are a little too real for savvy Hollywood advertisers to market. Let's just say Crazy Beautiful deserved much more recognition. Now on DVD, Crazy Beautiful delivers a complicated emotional undercurrent that practically all teen films of late lack. Kirsten Dunst gives a multi-layered performance,void of any vanity,of an alcoholic teen who is conditioned not to be loved. When she meets Carlos, played by a charismatic Jay Hernandez, she begins to allow herself to fall in love with someone she might normally not think she deserves.
Director John Stockwell creates a very believable atmosphere, contrasting between Carlos' low income, but emotionally warm neighborhood, and Nicole's upper class icy palace. This is not your typical inter-racial class division romance, though the elements are certainly there. Instead both Carlos and Nicole are individual characters that you can believe exist. The ending is a bit tidy, but the fact that you care about the characters makes it satisfying to watch them grow.
Technically the DVD is top-notch. It includes an insightful commentary by Director John Stockwell and Kirsten Dunst. The films crisp, but edgy cinematography comes through excellently, as does the films soundtrack.
Crazy Beautiful is indeed a surprise and is likely to induce some viewers to tears. Note that Kirsten Dunst's performance predicts that she will likely be a future Oscar Winner in the next ten years.",1019174400,5,1554,5.270161290322581

I know Jay Hernandez from a show on Real World on TNBC on Saturday mornings & he is very talented which he proves in this film. Kirsten Dunst is a great actress. A quick summary for this film would be the wild girl (Kirsten Dunst) meets a total opposite (Jay Hernandez), they fall in love, go through trials and tribulations, and they discover she has a problem & they fix it together.

1315601,4,B00003CY5P,"The plot of Crazy/Beautiful is the common opposites-attract scenario. A rich white girl named Nicole, who is self-destructive and out of control falls in love with a Hispanic boy named Carlos who is doing everything he can to succeed and make a better life for himself. Carlos is a stabilizing force in Nicole's life, but she is a destructive force in his. Even Nicole's own father warns Carlos against getting involved with his daughter. Though the basic plot is extremely formulaic, it does deviate from the norm in a few ways. For example, instead of Nicole's father being racist against Carlos, he genuinely likes him and warns him to stay away from Nicole for his own good. It is Carlos' mother who is unhappy about the relationship and would prefer that he went out with a nice Hispanic girl. The movie is also slower-paced than I would have expected, but I don't mean that as a bad thing. The slow pace allows plenty of time for character development, and is supported by great cinementography and an interesting score. I also expected it to come to a tragic close, but I was surprised to find that it ended happily. This film is perfect for young adults, but I think it should also have some appeal for the slightly more mature crowd.",1018396800,,1242,4.65
1315602,5,B00003CY5P,"I live with an LA High School teacher; we are both in our fifties yet we both enjoy teen oriented movies, at least to some degree.  However, we are also highly sensitive to the distance from reality in most of these movies, and this one kept us awake and interested.  Crazy/Beautiful may be another fairly tale reworking of the star-crossed lovers theme, but it also presents its characters with a gritty realism.  These kids in this movie are a lot like real kids that we know and see everyday.
Kirsten Dunst is still portraying a teenager, but proves she can handle adult complexity.  Jay Hernandez is wonderfully unaffected.  The story is in many respects by the numbers, but it turns most of the movie cliches upside down - the rich kids father approves of the poor kid - it's his own daughter he has trouble with.  The Latino kid is appealing to the white girls, but he isn't a white boy in a Latino skin, he is comfortable in his identity.  I don't want to say too much more because I don't want to ruin the story for those who haven't seen it.
This is a fun film to watch with superb performances.  As others have said, it has no villains just people who look like them from the vantage of the main characters.  It's a feel good teen movie with something to interest the brain.",1016928000,8,1284,4.406779661016949

1315604,5,B00003CY5P,"I enjoy teen movies but often I find them to be rather cliche.  I was pleasantly surprised at how good of a film this turned out to be.  Both of the actors did a wonderful job portraying the characters.  This movie is about the interracial romance between a poor Hispanic kid and a white rich girl. Its also a tale of two opposite people being that Carlos is a hard-working student who travels far to the rich kid's school and Nicole is a rich slacker with little ambition in life.  She has many emotional problems due to her family and the death of her mother.
This is not a film that makes their romance easy.  There are problems on both sides being that they come from different worlds and have different ideas on life.  Nicole is a complicated character who makes you angry sometimes but you also see the pain she hides.  She falls for the grounded Carlos who in the end helps her to become a much better person.
This film far surpasses the others out there.  The kids talk, dress and act real which makes it quite a bit more believable.  You care for these people when you watch this and hope things turn out for the best.  A great romance and film.  A+",1013040000,2,1158,4.314814814814815
1315682,4,B00003CY5P,"Kirsten Dunst, while one of my favorite actresses, seems to be stuck in the teenage-rut. She played a cheerleader in ""Bring it On"" and a high school student in ""Get Over It."" Both are you average teenage movie.
""Crazy/Beautiful"" is a great movie. The acting is top-notch, both by Dunst as Nicole, the rich girl with a crazy streak, and by Jay Hernandez as Carlos, the poor kid trying to make himself better.
Dunst's character has some severe problems. She has trememdous mood swings due to a tragic past, and severe family problems because of a step-mother who means well, but who is replacing a mother she's not ready to let go of.
The viewers are able to see what life is like for this poor Latino, from the strong family ties to the 2-hour bus ride to a school in a better part of town. Carlos is trying hard to better himself, by studying hard and working toward graduation and college.

When I sat down and watched it I was very surprised. The movie actually had real characters and not some characters thought up in ten minutes. The movies plot might no be a whole lot different from the plot of some of the other movies,but this one you can tell was thought in more than 15 minutes. Jay Hernandaz delivers an awesome breakthrough performance. I hope to see more of him in years to come. Kirsten Dunst hands in,probably,her best performance to date. Give this movie a try. Even if you don't like it,it's worth seeing the two actors do an amazing job",1011830400,5,861,4.3875
1315685,4,B00003CY5P,"I hesitated to see this film because having seen my share of Kristen Dunst movies, I wasn't sure I was ready for another teen sugar attack.  However, this film turned out to be a pleasant departure from the perky candy coated parts Dunst has played in the past.  In fact, this might be a watershed role for her, marking her transition from teen roles to adult roles.
Dunst plays Nicole Oakley, a troubled teenager from a privileged family who falls in love with Carlos (Jay Hernandez), a boy from the wrong side of the tracks.  The story is nothing new, but the presentation is remarkably good, with far greater maturity than one would expect from a high school flick.
This film is exceptional considering its limited budget and the fact that most of the major players have very little experience at this level.  For writers Phil Hay and Matt Manfredi, this is their first feature film screenplay.  For director John Stockwell, it is only his second feature film.  Likewise for Jay Hernandez and Taryn Manning.  Many of the Latino actors were cast from a local high school, so they are in their first film.  By comparison, Kirsten Dunst is a jaded veteran.  The use of so many ordinary (not professional actors) high school students in the film gives it a very genuine look and feel.
Stockwell turns in an impressive directorial effort with a story that is much more complex than it seems at first blush.  It starts out as your standard boy-meets-girl love story.  They flirt, act silly, have sex, fall in love and create beautiful romantic images on the beach.  Just when you think it is going to be a real yawner, things begin to get complicated.  Stockwell slowly peels away the layers of the two main characters and their families to reveal subterranean shearing forces that will act to tear them apart.
Nicole, who at first seems to be just a wild, rebellious brat, turns out to be far deeper and more emotionally unsettled than one would ever imagine.  Carlos' humble roots and burning ambition bring the relationship to a breaking point when he has to decide between Nicole and his shot at Annapolis.  Stockwell takes what could have been a trite teen romance and turns it into an engaging character study.  While his pace is perhaps a bit too deliberate and inclusive, his sensitive treatment of the motivation of the characters and his style of unraveling their psyches slowly before our eyes makes for great drama.  This film is full of ""ahah"" moments, where you find yourself re-evaluating the characters as some new piece of information is revealed.
Kirsten Dunst has had an active career, appearing in over twenty films before the age of twenty (which age she will attain in April 2002).  This is by far her best performance, helped by the fact that it is the most complex character she has ever played.  There was a hint that her ability extended beyond the superficial teen characters she normally plays in the film ""Virgin Suicides"", where she played a sullen, bad girl with some serious problems.  As Nicole in this film, she shows us that she has extraordinary range.  She really cuts loose with the character, taking her to exhilarating and uninhibited highs as well as crashing, depression ridden lows.  Though this is a minor film from a box office perspective, this performance should get the attention of casting directors and open the door for her to get bigger, more serious parts.  Jay Hernandez shows promise, although he seems a little wooden in this film.  His great strength (other than his obvious good looks) is his sincerity.  He comes across as if he means every word he says.
I was going crazy trying to figure out where I had seen Bruce Davidson (who played Tom Oakley) before.  He played Willard in the film of the same name (1971) about a sociopathic kid who befriended rats and used them to attack his enemies.  Davidson gives a good performance here as Nicole's congressman father, particularly in the touching scene at the end.
Herman Osario, Miguel Castro and Tommy De La Cruz were all cast for their first film in open auditions from thousands of Latino high school students.  They provide the film with some of its lighter moments as Carlos' friends, and they all give fantastic performances, basically being themselves.  Taryn Manning rounds out the cast as Nicole's best friend and does a fine job of playing the wild thing.
I liked this film more for the drama than the romance.  I rated it an 8/10.  Kirsten Dunst takes a quantum leap with this performance.  It is not for impatient viewers or those who despise slushy romances.  However, for those who like a good character study with emotionally charged content and complex characters it is well worth a look.",1010275200,19,4709,4.759852216748769

It follows the story of young Nicole, a troubled teenager who has all the money in the world, but naturally, that can't buy happiness and Nicole certainly doesn't have much of that in her life. Her mother died when she was little and her father is very kind, but the woman he is marrying does not like Nicole and is urging her soon to be husband to ""cut her loose."" Nicole is a party girl; she has many emotional problems and is always getting into trouble. She's heading down a bad path, and gets herself in with bad people. Then she meets Carlos, and things change. Carlos is down-to-earth, hard-working, and determined to make something of himself. At a glance, it seems like he and Nicole are way too different to have a relationship with each other, but that's not true. There's something about Nicole that attracts Carlos, and they begin a close bond. Then Nicole's father gets involved, trouble erupts, and a dark cloud threatens to plunge Nicole back into the darkness she experienced before she met Carlos. But love definitely finds its way through the hard stuff in this satisfying film on trust and forgiveness. Kirsten Dunst plays her role as Nicole with obvious strength and ability. We're used to seeing Dunst with the long blonde hair and the movie roles where she portrays a sweet and generally good teenager. Her performance in ""Crazy/Beautiful"" proves that she can take any role and pull it off beautifully. It shows what a great actress she is. Jay Hernandez also performs extremely well as Carlos.

I thought her father, a US Congressman, was going to descend into stereotype level towards the end but was pleasantly surprised he did not.
