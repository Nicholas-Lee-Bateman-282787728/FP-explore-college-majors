It is a mixture of dance, acrobatics, magic, black theater and clowns. The score music is wnderful. It would be more interesting to have this program in DVD version. The nearest spectacle to this kind of ""Cirque Ingenieux"" is le cirque du soleil.",1220659200,,304,4.648148148148148

7913746,5,B00000JWX2,"Kitaro's hypnotic music combines with the colors, costumes, contortions,accrobatics and story! The sight and sound dance together as one in kitaro's incredible mix of new age,classic, jazz and rock. It created a trancelike emotional effect that left my entire family mesmirized and enchanted!

It is no longer possible (to my knowledge) to see the show live. While out of print this wonderful experience is still available in vhs format,if you can find one!",1140307200,,457,5.260273972602739
7913747,5,B00000JWX2,"It is a rarity that a video has me awestruck after watching it for the first time. The only other video that did that to me was Riverdance. Cirque Ingenieux is one of those experiences that is satisfying on so many levels. The artistry of the performers, both musical and acrobatic, is outstanding. Colleen Ryan (The Angel) sings with an etherial yet powerful tone that sets Kitaro's work wonderfully. The dreamlike setting makes for a sometimes chilling backdrop to the performers that do feats that you would swear no human can do. The two asian contortionists who stretch their bodies in incredible shapes and directions. The two strongmen that perform an act so mindboggling, I had to rewind several times and see it again. Jugglers, acrobats, mimes, and other street performers fill out a video that is as visually stunning as musically beautiful",980985600,11,851,4.958041958041958
