8227562,1,B000X9LR82,"This was a ridiculous video. This is a white woman pretending to be a Native American medicine woman. She is not.

She dresses up in non-Native American costumes, and basically gives a pretend performance as a shaman. She is about as Native American and authentic as the British you find on YouTube trying to teach the Cherokee Stomp Dance, but doing some sort of country and western line dance instead. Totally fraudulent, and a con job.

I do appreciate the drum, but not the person at all.",1353024000,,492,4.64367816091954

I would not buy anything this person is selling. She is misrepresenting the Native American culture and completely disrespecting Native Americans. There are many resources to learn about the true Native American culture. You must be aware that there are many people out there that will tell you anything you want to hear to take your money. She only makes whites and others that are not Native American, who really want to learn look foolish. It is respectful to want to learn their culture in an honorable way. This is not the way she is teaching the Native American culture. Buyer beware is the advice I would have before you purchase anything from her.",1208908800,9,859,5.991869918699187
