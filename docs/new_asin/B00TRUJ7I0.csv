8702974,4,B00TRUJ7I0,"Retaliation is a difficult film to write about, not because it has little to offer as a cinematic classic but because it is quite complex. On the surface, it is a standard Japanese yakuza film from director Yasuharu Hasebe, a niche genre that he admittedly knows rather well from other works in the era. Its yakuza ties are much more socio-politically fueled than its action setpieces, and Retaliation is a slow-burner because of that; the focus on interpersonal relations and honor within the crime syndicate take precedence over the actual act of retaliation until the latter moments of the film, and that can often put Hasebes film in the uncomfortable position of exposing the less-than-glamorous side of yakuza life.

Because of that, Retaliation often lingers on subtle moments shared between characters, and part of its charm is the way that Hasebes main character Jiro (Akira Kobayashi) struggles to do his work dictated by the yakuza Don he works for while under constant threat of attack, either from the opposing Aoba clan or from a peer named Hino (Jo Shishido) that wants to kill him for a past sleight. Jiro is a smart and likable guy, always dressed in a suit and in complete control of himself in his surroundings  Kobayashi is excellent in this role, and its no wonder he became part of the diamond group of actors in Japanese cinema.

Jiros likability makes his downfall a lot more meaningful, too. When the Don goes back on his word to Jiro, its like a sword-stab to the audience as well  throughout much of Retaliation, Jiro resists the urge to do just what the title suggests, unable to kill Hino even after hes attacked multiple times by him, and hes unwilling to get back into the violence that once sent him to jail. Theress a moral code that consistently runs through Retaliation, a theme that Hasebe and screenwriters Yoshihiro Ishamatsu and Keiji Kubota explore throughout the multiple run-ins with the Aoba clan and within the yakuza lifestyle.

With that said, there are murders, there is rape, and theres also prostitution. Hasebe doesnt shrink from showing the terrible things that members of yakuza gangs do, and in fact the intention is to highlight the morality play within. Jiro, for all of his attempts to stay peaceful, is still pulled into the crosshairs  at one point, literally  because one cant simply have the allure of obtaining a high position in the yakuza without getting blood on their hands in the process. The climactic tipping point, where a young woman is killed in an attack on Jiro, finally forces him back into violence, and though its a necessary act for his survival, it is also a tragic moment for the audience.

Hasebe effectively structures these moments, although most contemporary audiences will most likely find Retaliation a bit too slow for their liking. It is often tedious or plodding, but in an intentional way; it is, like The Sopranos, a look at the inner lifestyle of gang members and the hierarchy of such, and that takes time to craft.

Those that find themselves bored of the action should take a look at Hasebes scene framing, because it is intentionally structured. Most scenes are shot with an obstruction between the camera and the characters, a literal barrier that obscures the image. Its intentional  there is always a obstacle between what we want, and Retaliations framing is meant as a metaphor for Jiros plight. These moments often make for very interesting shot choices, either set behind some object or enveloped in rain, and it gives Retaliation a defining characteristic that adds to the story.

But the film is not for those who aren't interested in giving it time to develop. It is a laborious process, and for a yakuza film, Retaliation is often devoid of fight scenes. With that said, the ones that are shown are chaotic and more climactic than one would assume, and Hasebes reluctance, using them sparingly, is a wise choice. Retaliation holds a rather scathing view of yakuza lifestyle, and it is somewhat slow-paced, but its presence as important cinema should have few outspoken opponents.

Arrow Videos transfer of Retaliation has few flaws, and its color (though somewhat intentionally drab) looks excellent when the film makes use of it  such as in a lush rice paddy setting. Audio is also very clear, and its presented in original Japanese with English subtitles only.
As for extra features, this Arrow Video release is surprisingly lacking, although the passing of some of the crew certainly had something to do with it. Hasebe died in 2009, so theres no chance of getting an audio commentary or interview unless done previously. However, the disc does include an interview (actually more like a commentary) from film critic Tony Rayns, who goes into enlightening detail about the careers of those involved in Retaliation as well as its presence in Japanese cinema. It runs about a half an hour.

Also included is a brief interview with Jo Shishido, who discusses his work on Retaliation and his hopes to be a 90-year-old bad guy in a movie. Worth a watch  this ones in Japanese with English subtitles.

A trailer and still gallery round out the extras on the disc. However, theres also reversible cover art (cant comment since I don't have the actual release but a check disc) as well as DVD version of the film, and most importantly, a full-color booklet insert. Not a bad set for a good picture!",1447200000,3,5399,4.85854189336235
8702975,4,B00TRUJ7I0,"Retaliation is a 1970s Yakuza film & its also one of the 1st ive seen from that era. Although I have the directors other film from Arrow Video, Massacre Gun I haven't seen it yet so I won't compare the two. This film starts of somewhat typical with the main character Jiro getting out of prison & falling back into his old Yakuza life. The is quite a number of fight scenes in the film & some are very violent/bloody. The story is good & easy to follow I only wish it had been a bit longer. The revenge/betrayal theme was also good I felt. Movie looks great on Blu Ray also. Not a lot of extra features besides a trailer & 2 interviews. The booklet that comes with it is very informative as well. I enjoyed this film enough that I also bought Massacre Gun by the same director & have looked into other of his films. The movie also has a very downbeat & grim tone. All in all id say its worth a look for fans of Asian & or Yakuza films.",1440374400,3,935,4.059459459459459
