554119,4,6303082661,This Film was extremely entertaining. The bond between Alan Ladd & William Bendix was well done Truly a well likable Alan Ladd in his role - the tough hero but compassion showed through in the role. I would recommended this Film.,1336780800,,229,4.609756097560975
554120,1,6303082661,"Let me start by stating emphatically that I love old movies like these. I like them when they get a little corny, so having read the five star review of this movie, currently there is only one, I thought this movie was for me.

After having watched it, I feel victimized.  This movie is terrible.  The picture quality, the sound quality, the plot, the acting, (except William Bendix) is all awful.

I'm not sure how anyone without a financial interest in the sale of this DVD could give this movie five stars.  I'm trying not to sound rude. I'm not accusing anyone, but I don't understand. I'm just being honest.

Run away from this movie.  Save your money.  You'll be disappointed.",1335225600,9,682,4.578512396694215
554121,2,6303082661,"I was surprised when I received the Synergy Entertainment DVD of the Deep Six how bad the quality of the picture and sound were.  I have a VHS version which is clearer, brighter, and the sound very much better.  On the DVD version, I had to crank the sound up to the point where the system hummed and the sound was mostly muffled and indistinct.  This is actually a reasonably good film (notwithstanding its stupid plot in places) and for some reason Warner Brothers has turned over the release to Synergy Entertainment which made a pig's breakfast of it.  The picture was washed out and in general it looked like a VHS tape on slow speed of a TV version.....I was sadly disappointed and recommend no one buys the DVD until Warner Brs. comes to its senses and releases a better copy.  Originally released in 4:3 and not widescreen, you may want to locate a VHS copy, which was a Warner release.....infinitely better picture and sound qualtiy.  As far as the movie goes, Alan Ladd always seems to be carrying the weight of the world on his shoulders.  Made in 1958, when he was 45 (already you can see the effects of the booze and drugs on him), and just 6 years before he committed suicide, Ladd actually fit the role of the tormented ex-Quaker Lieutenant very well, although he was 20 years too old for a Navy Lieutenant.  Even the beautiful ex-Canadian Dianne Foster (15 years his junior) who plays his love interest has to put full throttles on to get a decent reaction out of Ladd, who seems to have his feet stuck in cement.  One of the goofiest roles in the movie is William Bendix as the Jewish?? Petty Officer ""Frenchy Shapiro"".  Bendix and Ladd were real life pals and Frenchy has faith that Ladd will see the sense of shedding his Quaker qualms and start fighting.  The film is generally well cast otherwise with Joey Bishop, James Whitmore, and Efrem Zimbalist.  My biggest reservation about the film, other than the creaky plot, is how hard Dianne Forster's character has to work to get a reaction out of Ladd. The rest of us poor pilgrims would row a rubber dinghy across the Pacific for her....But this is the real strength of Alan Ladd...he is so tortured in real life that he can't hide it from the screen.  It really came through in Shane and does so here in Deep Six.  Was there ever a sadder actor out there?  One final point...shortly after this film (and a failed suicide attempt) Ladd did everything in his power to land the role of Lawrence in Lawrence of Arabia....What was he thinking?",1334966400,22,2510,4.534368070953437
554122,5,6303082661,"For several days upon receiving The Deep Six DVD, I watched it several times. The repartee between Ladd and Bendix (his real-life pal of many years) I found very natural and realistic. But then, I consider both fine actors. I enjoyed his gentle courtship of Dianne Foster, a pleasing leading lady for Ladd. I got the feeling that this role came very natural to him. I may be in the minority, but I consider the film excellent. Joey Bishop and the men in Ladd's division, comes off pleasantly comic and the film is continuously punctuated with comical relief. To sum up, I enjoyed it, found it well-acted and look forward to reading other viewer's reviews of the film. The DVD was shipped to me fast and the price was very reasonable.",1323129600,34,733,4.603053435114504

554124,2,6303082661,"This is a movie about a Young man who has a Naval Reseverist and a Quaker and is called up for duty onboard a Destroyer at the beginning of World War 2. The biggest play of the movie is how Alan Ladd reacts to the way that the crew treats him when he shows his Quaker background at various times when a life or death decision is called for. There is also a love story sub-plot going on but it doesn't seem to fit real well with the main plot.
Overall this movie doesn't make much sense when you watch it. For each of the scenes of the Destoryer being in action the only thing that seems to tie them together is the characters being shown and the ship being shown. Also the director and producer seem to have two major climaxes which is confusing. Overall, this seems more like a cheesy training film produced by the Navy from around that time and just happens to start Alan Ladd. This is defeninatly not one of his best movies. This is better for a rental instead of a purchase.
Besides the Alan Ladd this movies has all your typical stock characters from World War 2 flicks from the 50's, James Whitmore William Bendix, Keenan Wynn, etc. Also look for Joey Bishop of Rat Pack fame playing a typical sailor Sterotype.",1018483200,7,1217,4.318777292576419

554190,3,6303082661,"This is a better movie than one might think on a first viewing not to say it is a great movie but after watching it once and thinking its just ok  went back and watched it again, found it more entertaining and the acting to be better than my first impression of it. The acting and directing are adequate for the material they have to work with and on occasion they manage to rise above not much but a little are you looking at Alan Ladd and William Bendix at their prime no but they are seasoned  actors and that shows up and with the usual Hollywood stereo type of navy personnel with a girl in every port and always getting into fights ( although it may be a good enticement to join up) in this movie it's a little over done especially with Joey Bishop looking like he's playing to a live audience in a club but then when you have a limited scrip you have to fill in with something.",1421020800,,884,4.133720930232558
554191,4,6303082661,"I have been a huge fan of Alan Ladd since I first saw him in the great western, ""Shane"". In the this movie he plays a Quacker whose beliefs are testing during his tour duty on a American destroyer in the pacific during World War 2. William Bendix turns in a great performance as the chief of the boat. There are many faces you will recognize from other movies. It is a seldom seen movie that would be an excellent addition to any movie lovers library.",1413158400,,451,4.255813953488372

554196,4,6303082661,I choose this rating because it was nice to watch a movie from that era. I had seen it many years ago and it was nice to see it again.,1403049600,,134,3.5
554197,4,6303082661,"This was made as a movie to bring the girlfriend/wife with you, which some reviewers can't seem to understand, especially considering the age this movie was made in. The love story in the movie is there to keep the lady entertained in seeing her prince charming at war, and returning back to her, now the valiant hero.

Meanwhile, this story is about an otherwise conscientiousness objector (Quaker) having to make a choice between believing in his faith or ""becoming his own man"". It's typical of the day that the otherwise CO would be like Mr. Ladd, without getting too messy with religious beliefs. In the end he does prove his mettle, but not as some Rambo. The ending leaves Mr. Ladd with a duty to fulfill, despite his future wife's bliss, so it's a tad bittersweet.

There's some funny moments in the movie, and like many buddy movies while at war, there's some rowdy lower deck interaction (especially the fight scene with the merchant marine!) ... and for a good cause.

Like the maturity level of the movie, a refreshing change of the sheer pornographic nature of modern films (and certainly not something to take the girlfriend/wife to watch). Nice balance between Mr. Ladd's star power as a leading man, and a man's need to watch a manly man's war movie, too.

DVD quality, as mentioned with others, is indeed rather poor (almost a straight transfer, complete with all the film imperfections). So a person who's really into DVD quality will need to wait for a better transfer, especially to clean up the noise and adjust the chroma and color balance (film is showing that reddish darkroom tone, too).

4 Stars due to the really poor video quality (YouTube videos have higher video quality). Except for some rather cheesy acting here and there with the crew, the overall acting quality and content is a nice mixture of love, humor, action and thinking time (especially scenes where Mr. Ladd has to decide between faith and principles). It's what you'd expect of a 1958 movie (although asking his girlfriend if she wanted a martini in front of his traditional Quaker mom, was stretching the moral aspect of the day, even for 1958 social mores).",1402876800,2,2154,4.779569892473118

554380,3,6303082661,"Overall I enjoyed this WWII movie. It wasn't great nor bad, but kept my interest.  The characters were pretty well developed and the story line was OK  (Guy with Quaker upbringing questioning his ability to fight on board a US Navy Destroyer).  I've seen many Alan Ladd movies, and have enjoyed most of them.  This one is no exception in that regard.  But I would rank it as somewhere in the middle in terms of overall quality of acting.  Ladd, though professional throughout the flick, seemed somewhat stiff.  The dialogue between he and his love interest, Dianne Foste (quite a beauty) didn't seem to flow very naturally - I don't know whether it was due to a lack of chemistry or what. (Perhaps a hot looking babe like that caused Ladd to choke on some of his lines!).  William Bendix's part as Ladd's ally/supporter was right in his wheel house - funny, likeable and serious just when he needed to be.  Likewise with Efrem Zimbalist Jr., who played the ship's doctor and Ladd's confidant.  James Whitmore as the ship's Captian was played with the professionalism that would be expected of one with his fine credentials.  One of the most distracting and detracting portions of the movie were the scenes played by Keenan Wynn, the ships overbearing executive officer. His part as the foil to Ladd, was just plain awful IMHO. Over-the-top acting would be an appropriate way to describe his scenes.  Overall, I think that this movie will appeal to most as it was a good story played by good actors - just not the best example of Alan Ladd's acting ability (i.e. ""Shane""), but not bad either.",1392595200,,1591,4.683453237410072
554381,3,6303082661,"The only thing that we thought detracted from this movie was the Director/direction of the actors.  It ALMOST made it... on so many levels.

554387,4,6303082661,"I think the story summary is well put, Alan Ladd's character was brought up Quaker, but had left that life behind when he pursued a career in commercial art.  He has a first-moments of combat where his Quaker teaching overtake him when a moment came to track and shoot down an un-identified aircraft.

His portrayal was classic ALan Ladd and he came off well, the story of the navy crew's reaction to his in-ability to order the aircraft shot down was also simple and to the point.

There was an awkward introduciton of a love-interest in the beginning and end of the movie, it gave a way to introduce his Quaker upbringing, but just didn't fit in well with the bulk of the story.  Not a distraction, just a bit awkward in how it was worked in.  Would I watch it again, yeah, most likely would.",1378252800,,794,4.410958904109589

William Bendix does a good job as a senior chief. I really enjoyed this film. While it had a lot of the cliches of WWII navy films, there was enough characterization and reality of Navy life to make it worthwhile. Not a lot of naval action. Some fight scenes around Atu, but don't watch this for the action, it is more like Mr. Roberts in that regard.",1376352000,3,519,4.148514851485149

Very interesting storyline. Alan Ladd is my favourite actor because he always gave 100% and his ability and talent shows in every scene. I think he looked wonderful.  I believe he had his own issues at the time, it's unfortunate that some viewers expect you to look as you did back in the early 1940s when you had just turned 30.  I believe this was done by Mr Ladd's own production - Jaguar,  so he wasn't just acting in the movie but also having to concern himself in other areas of production. It's sad that anyone would release a poor print to dvd. Neverthless, I am grateful to have seen this, as I am currently collecting and viewing as many
