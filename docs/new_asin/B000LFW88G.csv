2710169,5,B000LFW88G,"I have received my workout today and I'm glad that I've decided to do it for my workout. On the back cover of my dvd, it shows Billy and his crew using his Billy Bands, but in the video they uses weights. I didn't use weights for this workout. I have used my weighted gloves. I thought they were going to use the bands and I didn't feel like getting my bands. I still had a good workout.

I'm glad that Billy has done a cardio strengthening workout. When it's strength training for me, I can do this workout and get both my cardio and strength workout in.

You will definitely feel this workout. I believe all the women used 3lbs weights, at least that's what it looked like to me. The next time, I do this workout, I think I would start with my 3lbs weights as well and then work my way up. Maybe five will be the highest I'll go.

I recommend this workout to any Tae Bo fans that also like to do strength training. I don't think you will be disappointed.",1306454400,,956,4.129032258064516

2710171,5,B000LFW88G,I am an experienced Taebo-er and my legs were burning by the end of this video.  Another great workout!,1243382400,2,103,4.421052631578948
2710172,4,B000LFW88G,I have just about every one of the Billy Blanks TaeBo videos and this one is just as great as the others.  The best thing about it is that all you have to do is use heavier weights as you improve.  It's not like you will eventually be able to do the whole thing with ease.  It can be made to benefit any level of fitness.  There is also an added bonus arm workout at the end!,1242172800,,375,3.831168831168831
2710173,5,B000LFW88G,"This is an incredible sculpting video. I've noticed quite a difference and have been using this video for about 2 months. I love how efficient the workout is, meaning you get a lot of workout in a short period of time. I started using 3lb weights instead of buying Billy's bar, and have now progressed to 5lb weights. I don't think you need to purchase the bar. You definitely get your heartrate up even though its a sculpting video. Highly recommend.",1236211200,2,451,4.580246913580247
