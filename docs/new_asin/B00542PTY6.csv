8456112,5,B00542PTY6,"A heartbreakingly simple love story, told from the viewpoint of the surviving partner, and culminating in the sale of an extraordinary collection of art that was loved and cherished by the two of them.  Pierre Berge speaks with touching candor of his relationship with Yves St. Laurent, who they both were, the nature of their relationship and his own beliefs and the standards by which he conducts his life.  The film brings St. Laurent and the era to life, and is liberally dotted with interviews with Loulou de la Falaise and Betty Catroux, his two closest female friends.  St. Laurent speaks of what his collections were intended to give women, his love of women and his desire to dress them as the powerful condident beings they either are or will become.  Berge details his life with St. Laurent and speaks openly and simply of the relationship between them.  I found this film remarkably moving, with extremely well-detailed accounts of events as they unfolded, and touching in its unsparing depiction of love.",1307491200,,1017,4.923976608187134
