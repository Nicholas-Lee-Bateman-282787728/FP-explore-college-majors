The animation is old fashioned 90's standard, but the voices and the effects are great, and the 'Monsters Inc.' actual star John Goodman is very entertaining as Rex.
This is something for the sci-fi and dino movies fans of all ages!",1011225600,2,430,4.746666666666667
694994,4,6303610781,"""We're Back! A Dinosaur's Story"" is a sweet movie with very cute dinosaurs. Indeed, the dinosaurs are the best part of the movie, and kids will enjoy their antics more than the subplot, which involves two kids who join a horror circus. The two kids are romantically attracted to each other and the girl's flirting will make the audience want to gag. Besides this, the plot is easy enough for kids to follow, but most of the conversations are confusing. However, the dinosaurs really are very cute.",997142400,,497,4.724137931034483

Predictably (since this is animated stuff), they are friendly and an evil circus owner wants to exploit them. Kids fare should appeal to 2nd and 3rd graders, with fairly good animation and great voices. As for people older than nine, stick to Jurassic Park, a truly absorbing, much much more successful dinosaur film made the same year and directed by the producer of this one, Spielberg.",987724800,,479,5.233766233766234

Then Steven Speilberg, the film wizard took  this little story and changed it all, including leaving out some of the  dinosaur characters and tossing in a couple of cutesy little human waifs.  Now the dinosaurs (and the humans as well) look just like very grotesque  cartoon characters that may make your stomach churl a little. In addition,  this animated kiddie wish-granter is also saturated with a really bizarre  fantasy involving the big freak show that some odd-looking villain set up  in the Central Park. Oh, well - I think ""American Tail"" and  ""Land Before Time"" are much better works of animation by Steven  Speilberg and Don Bluth, one of our own kartoon geniuses.",950659200,,933,4.848101265822785

7852005,3,6303610781,"Not unlike everything else produced under Steven Spielberg's Amblimation company, ""We're Back! A Dinosaur's Story"" was a critic's punching bag and a rare find for anybody who didn't catch its original release, but even more so than&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Fievel-Goes-West/dp/B0000VV4WW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Fievel Goes West</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Balto/dp/B00005TSMN/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Balto</a>, the story of four dinosaurs in New York seems forsaken by popular animation history, with seemingly more people not having heard of it than otherwise. While the film does have its faults, this is still a lamentable fate for a feature that puts to shame a lot of what's on the market today.

The story: four dinosaurs - Rex (John Goodman,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Monsters-Inc/dp/B000067DGX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Monsters, Inc.</a>), Elsa (Felicity Kendall,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Good-Neighbors/dp/B000784WKO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Good Neighbors</a>), Dweeb (Charles Fleischer,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Who-Framed-Roger-Rabbit/dp/6305531412/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Who Framed Roger Rabbit</a>), and Woog (Rene La Vant) - gain intelligence and are transported across time by the benevolent Captain Neweyes (Walter Cronkite) to fulfill the wishes of the children. Dropped into New York City, they befriend Louie (Joey Shea) and Cecilia (Yeardley Smith,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Simpsons/dp/B000JLQPTK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Simpsons</a>) - two young runaways from opposite sides of the tracks - and find themselves fleeing from panicked grown-ups as they search for the Museum of Natural History...only to find themselves the target of the spooky ringmaster, Professor Screweyes (Kenneth Mars,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Young-Frankenstein/dp/B000G6BLWE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Young Frankenstein</a>), who harbors sinister plans for them.

""We're Back!"" is a children's movie, first and foremost, and was most likely aimed at kids no older than eight or nine. In other words, while there is a decent amount of action, scary parts, and humor, it's all pretty inoffensive. A lot of problems are solved by talking and understanding rather than action scenes, and you know from the start that there's going to be a happy ending. This rather harmless approach carries over to the characters themselves: the dinosaurs are very cuddly, and generally everybody is proved to be very warm-hearted - almost too warm-hearted for me, and probably likewise so for anybody else who grew up watching animated films where peril was commonplace.

The performances and production, overall, tend to be pretty good. In addition to main stars, the voice cast boasts Jay Leno, Martin Short (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Treasure-Planet/dp/B00005JLR2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Treasure Planet</a>), Julia Child, and Blaze Berdahl (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ghostwriter/dp/B0039OGGX4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ghostwriter</a>) in supporting roles, creating one of the most unique voice ensembles for any film, and they all tend to do good jobs with their roles. Though it retains the trademark big-budget style prevalent in ""Fievel"" and could still go toe-to-toe with the visuals of a Disney movie at the time, the animation has a flaw: the outlines of human characters' features occasionally stutter in between frames, making a nose or mouth look less defined from one second to the next and on occasion simply disappearing. It's not a debilitating error, but is a bit disappointing to watch happen repeatedly.

What the film does hold in its favor, though, is its ability to inspire the inner child. I know it sounds corny, but consider: who hasn't dreamed of having a special friend that no one else had or seeing a real dinosaur in your own backyard, or having that dinosaur as a special friend? That wonderful ability to warm hearts that producer Steven Spielberg forsook when he began to tackle adult fare is well at work here, with New York City seeming as magical a place as any wonderland. The film pulls off the nostalgia factor incredibly, taking us back to a time before animation turned to 3D and we had&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Shrek/dp/B00003CXXJ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Shrek</a>&nbsp;shoved down our throats. I'm not sure how much this means to other people, but this aspect saved the movie for me.

In all, it's not difficult to see why ""We're Back!"" didn't do very well when it was first released, but why it remains little more than a cult feature continues to perplex me. Disregard the technicalities of my three-star rating and know that the film's strengths outweigh its faults effectively, and that the movie is a secret opus for fans of classical animation. Don't deprive yourself - give it a look.",1225670400,28,5242,6.714285714285714
7852006,3,6303610781,"Satisfactory adaption of Spielberg's interest in dinoland, but this time the dinosaurs are not confined to an island zoo. Instead, they time travel to the heart of New York, just in time for Thanksgiving, and secretly hiding among the huge floats and balloons.
Enter two lovable children who befriend the dinosaurs and stumble into the evil clutches of Professor Sreweyes Eccentric Circus located in Central Park. The dinosaurs come to the rescue!
Not a ""Disney classic"" type film, but it is cute fun and didn't lose my interest. Although the last half may be dark and gloomier than the first part, it doesn't seem to me to be any more traumatic than the real Disney villians true nature or force.
Although some big names are voiced here in bit parts, I can see where it may have some inside jokes from producers for casting Jay Leno or Julia Child. After all, the tale does take place during Thanksgiving holiday, and having Julia is like having a real chef in the house. (Ha,ha).",1194912000,,981,4.709302325581396

7852008,2,6303610781,"I saw this movie in theatres when it came out; I was six years old at the time (1993). While I enjoyed it, the middle and ending scared me to death. It gave me nightmares and was scarier than the Neverending Story, which was also pretty frightening. I would recommend the first Land Before Time instead, since there are no children who turn into animals in that movie.",1168387200,,368,4.426470588235294
7852009,3,6303610781,"How ironic it is that in 1993, two dinosaur pictures courtesy of Steven Spielberg would hit the theaters.  One of them was a runaway box-office hit, the live-action spectacular JURASSIC PARK; the other was WE'RE BACK! A DINOSAUR'S STORY, which came and went without much fanfare.  An animated film from Spielberg's London-based Amblimation Studios (AN AMERICAN TAIL:  FIEVEL GOES WEST and the underrated BALTO), WE'RE BACK has been dubbed as a sort of ""Jurassic Park, Jr.""  Actually, that might be a bit inaccurate, for while there is one not so subtle reference to the Spielberg monster hit (a marquee theater advertising the movie), this film has none of the visceral, nail-biting scares of JURASSIC PARK.  As it is a kid's movie, one shouldn't expect too much.

Even so, this ""dinosaur's story"" is a bit of a curious creation.  Based on a children's book by author Hudson Talbott, the movie involves a quartet of prehistoric giants who are taken aboard the spaceship of an elderly time-traveler, Captain NewEyes.  The foursome is treated to some sort of cereal that transforms them from vicious but dumb monsters into talking creatures with human qualities (think Barney and his friends).  Before long, the four dinosaurs--with the names of Rex, Elsa, Dweeb, and Woog--are whisked to modern day New York City where they meet two children:  tough-talking (but secretly soft-hearted) Louie and a neglected cutie named Cecilia, both of who are running away from home.  Together with their new pals, the dinosaurs crash the Thanksgiving Parade (which involves a very silly song-and-dance number), escape the police, and get sidetracked by the evil owner of a fright-show circus (NewEyes' brother ScrewEyes)... all before arriving at their destination, the Museum of Natural History, where the dinosaurs are to become real-life talking exhibits for many children.

The plot, such as it is, is pretty wishy-washy, and the routine execution barely elevates WE'RE BACK above anything but your typical, average kids animated fare.  The animation itself is mostly serviceable and includes some interesting computer-generated effects, but it's not up to Disney quality... and at times I felt that there were some frames stolen from a more superior animated film about dinosaurs, Don Bluth's THE LAND BEFORE TIME.  John Patrick Shanley's screenplay has few lines to appeal to older viewers, much less a plethora of characters one are likely to remember.  The four dinosaurs, for instance, are your typical talking animals that, while cuddly and likeable, never develop into fully realized personalities, and their supporting co-stars don't get much to do either.

Probably the only character who does show any depth is Louie, the freckle-faced street kid.  When we first meet Louie he acts pretty fresh and self-centered; but as the movie develops, his more soft qualities shine through, whether he saves Rex from drowning or befriending Cecilia to cheer her up.  He even admits, in a tearful sequence, how he uses his tough demeanor to hide his own fear.  If anything, it's really Louie who steals the movie and makes it worthwhile.  His relationship with Cecilia (who is less well-defined than Louie, but that's irrelevant) although more romantic than it has to be, is very nicely handled and is the highest point of the film.  (The moments where Cecilia flirts with Louie are quite funny.)  Equally pleasing is the characterization of Professor ScrewEyes, the villain of the piece.  He only shows up in the second half of the picture, but commands his screen-time with devious manipulation and pure nastiness.  In addition, his demeanor of tapping into people's nightmares and a hypnotic stare render him a menace to be feared.  ScrewEyes may be a bizarre baddie, but he works all the same.

That leads to another problem of WE'RE BACK.  The first half is lighthearted (and outrageously unbelievable) silliness, but midway through the picture becomes dark--particularly the scenes involving ScrewEyes' fright-show circus, which are executed in a way that may be too intense for small fry.  This unbalanced shift in tone calls the film's target audience into question.  Kids in the 5-12 age group should be fine, but older viewers expecting more may find it to be too silly and uninspired.  And the very young, too, could be traumatized by the aforementioned scary scenes.

And yet, in spite of saying all this, there is something rather likeable about WE'RE BACK--A DINOSAUR'S STORY.  Its plot is outrageous, sure, and the movie is little more than just a cute, forgettable time-passer.  But it has its heart in the right place, and there are some tender moments--one sequence, in which Rex and company make the ultimate sacrifice to save Louie and Cecilia from eternal life as chimps in ScrewEyes' circus, is genuinely moving, especially when Rex's gentle touch reverts the kids to normal.  This is done in a very subtle, effective way that stayed with me for a long while.  The voice cast includes some solid performances, too, notably John Goodman as the gruff yet gentle Rex, Walter Cronkite as Captain NewEyes (and yes, he says his trademark ""that's the way it is"" toward the end), and Martin Short in a cameo as a comic clown.  The standouts are Joey Shea, who sizzles with attitude and likeability as Louie, and Kenneth Mars (Triton in THE LITTLE MERMAID and Grandpa Longneck in the LAND BEFORE TIME sequels), chewing the scenery as the fearsome ScrewEyes.  Yeardley Smith's Cecilia is the one voice I take issue with--she doesn't exactly sound like a young girl, and most of the other voices--Jay Leno, Rhea Perlman, Charles Fleischer, and Julia Child--all seem to be just in the movie for the sake of, well, being there.  The musical score by James Horner is beautiful, although at times it does sound like a rehash of many of his other scores (a trait not uncommon with most of the composer's work, it seems).

In short, WE'RE BACK is passable fare as a family animated film; it's cute and funny, but that's about it.",1167955200,7,6021,5.043434343434344
7852010,3,6303610781,"It's not like this movie was intended to be on the same level as Jurassic Park.  It's just a pleasant animated film about dinosaurs aimed towards children.

In the film, the dinosaurs want to meet up with the children who've always dreamed of living in a world with dinosaurs.  The dinosaurs are extremely friendly in this movie, which means the film is not for adults.

I didn't think it was that great overall, because some of the voice acting was average.  Jay Leno's voice was really average, in my opinion.  Yeardley Smith is the woman who does the voice of Lisa Simpson on the greatest animated show of all-time- the Simpsons.  However, in this movie she doesn't really do that good of a job.  Back in 1993 any given episode of the Simpsons was clearly better than this movie.

None of that means the movie is crap, though.  It's just a nice passable film.  My favorite part was Goodman's performance as the parade dancing dinosaur.",1162425600,,938,4.624242424242424
