7455920,5,B0162TZ4D0,"Unforgotten is a fantastic cold case crime drama spread over 6 episodes starring Nicola Walker. It is available on amazon.co.uk in region II (non-USA format) for about $20 US. This show may well be released in region I given how popular Nicola Walker is becoming. If you invest in an all-region DVD player however, like I did a few years ago (about $40 on Amazon), you will have available superb shows like this and hundreds others from France, Germany, Sweden, & Denmark you can't see in the US. This show intertwines the stories of 4 families around a murder from 1976 and does it so very magnificently, it left me speechless at how good it was. The show can best be summed up as ""we all are harboring secrets & lies and those secrets will likely bring us to our knees someday"". This is a slow, thoughtful, crime/mystery that is worth the effort to follow to its rich conclusion. So superb did I find this series I would give it 10 stars were that a rating option.",1453248000,18,966,4.463276836158192
7455921,5,B0162TZ4D0,"Unforgotten is a cold-case mystery.  A body is found in the basement of (among many other things) a former youth hostel.  A young man was killed in the 1970s.  Met detectives Cassie Stuart (Nicola Walker) and Sunil Sunny Khan (Sanjeev Bhaskar) are on the case.  The story line is reminiscent of the wonderful cold case series Waking the Dead and to reinforce that memory both Trevor Eve and Claire Goose from WTD appear in this story.

There are, however, two major differences.  WTD was a succession of individual feature films (presented in two parts).  Unforgotten is a six-part miniseries.  A more important difference: in WTD the focus was on Peter Boyd (Trevor Eve) and his team.  Here the focus is on the possible suspects, with the Met investigators constituting the narrative thread which links them.

We have four groups of suspects and the story line cuts between each of their individual stories.  Among those individuals are such first-line actors/actresses as Tom Courtenay, Trevor Eve and Gemma Jones.  As each groups experience is explored in relation to this cold case, other facts, sins and previously-undisclosed horrors arise.  All of their lives are disrupted and changed as we plunge into their pasts.  Structurally and narratologically this is very effective.  The cold case is the central story, but it is a story within four other stories, some of which end up being related.

This is very engaging television, but there is one quibble.  The creators fascination with politics is a bit heavy-handed.  One of the four stories concerns race and racism; the second concerns homophobia; the third looks at fallen humanity within the established church; the fourth examines the dark past which hovers over a corner of the House of Lords.  That pretty much covers all the bases and the treatment of the occupiers of the bases is fairly predictable and conventional.  This is not, e.g., an account of the breakdown of the institutions of society (which it might have been and which would have fit the timeframe nicely).  Nevertheless, the story is a strong one, the acting superb, the atmospherics of the storys various sites quite effective, particularly the minimalistic representation of Liverpool.

Now some advice for the reader.  This set is the original British version and will not play on U.S. dvd players.  It is, however, less expensive when purchased from Amazon.co.uk.  Consider the purchase of an all-regions dvd player.  I recommend those made by Pioneer.  They can be obtained from Amazon.com in the general range of $100.  They then pay for themselves quickly, as the British imports (and sometimes the Dutch imports of the British shows) are often less expensive than the U.S. versions.  This also enables you to acquire shows that are not released in the U.S. (and it offers you the opportunity to acquire British releases earliere.g., shows like Downton Abbey).  Something to think about.",1449792000,16,2926,5.073375262054507

7455931,5,B0162TZ4D0,"I watch a lot of British police procedurals and I have to say that this may be the very best I've ever seen.  The acting is stellar (who would expect less from Nicola Walker and Sanjeev Bhaskar, Trevor Eve and Claire Goose, Cherie Lunghi and Gemma Jones and the rest) and the story is convoluted and interesting.  The investigation is challenging and fascinating.  The science is cool but not overwhelming.  The human interest is on point.

One thing I absolutely loved is that neither of the lead detectives were portrayed as broken people.  Not much of their home lives are mentioned at all.  And what is mentioned or shown is fairly normal and mild.  There are no criminal teenage kids or ranting lonely spouses or insane family members here.  It was nice for the main character not to be a recovering alcoholic or someone who never got over the loss of his child.  That stereotype has become so pervasive in Brit police dramas that it's time for a new tack.  And frankly, a story about the crime NOT the investigators' lives is a refreshing change.

And WHAT a crime!  I thought I was good at figuring these out, but I would have never guessed this one.

I'm so glad the second series is available right away because I cannot wait.  Of course I'm going to want to see series 3 tomorrow, and it probably won't be available for months.  But oh man!  What a great show!",1531612800,,1370,4.504065040650406

I got to the point that I did not care what happened.  But I stuck it out.  I agree with the viewer that wrote about the ending as being too goody/goody.

Other than that, this is like all the other British mysteries - which have a terrible flaw: their absurd story development. As if any police detective unit anywhere could deploy all available hands to work just one case at a time. And get DNA results back overnight. And solve the case inside of a week. There are no politicians. No higher ups to answer to. No dead ends that drag on for, well, 20 years. There are a few that have broken the mold - Shetland, Broadchurch, Tennyson - to some degree, but they take a long time to produce; except for these, I find the British mystery programs as uninspired and unimaginative.

The team toils relentlessly to peel back onion layers of suspects  including a priest and a high government official  who appear respectable but stink of past evils.

I love the Briticisms: Cheers said upon accepting a cuppa. Gov instead of boss. And the teasing way in which Cassie croons to her partner, Sunny, yesterday my life was filled with rain.

Which means Im left anxiously waiting for the rest of the six episodes and for Season Two.

7455976,3,B0162TZ4D0,"""Unforgotten"" is a mystery miniseries first broadcast on Britain's ITV in six 45-minute episodes in 2015. It capitalizes on the popularity of cold case shows and on the recent fascination of the British public with their 20th century social history. The detectives are DCI Cassandra Stuart (Nicola Walker), a middle-aged divorce and empty-nester, and DI Sunil ""Sunny"" Khan (Sanjeev Bhaskar), a family man presumably of Pakistani extraction. They are assisted by a team of investigating officers who do a lot of leg work. The skeleton of a young man is found buried in the basement of a building that is being demolished. The man was killed by a blunt force trauma from something like a hammer that put a hole in his skull. The building was built in 1886 but had been a boarding house called Arlingham House for young tenants at the time of the murder, which is determined to be between 1965 from the car ignition key found on the deceased and 1978, when the concrete floor was poured.

The mystery adheres strictly to a formula: The first episode is dedicated to identifying the victim and introducing us to characters who will later be suspects, witnesses, or the perpetrator. We see them in the present with only very brief, incoherent flashes back in time, their memories of the victim. The detectives make the rounds of potential witnesses in the usual fashion of television mysteries. In the usual fashion, the characters tell half-truths in order to conceal something that may or may not have anything to do with the crime in question, which causes the investigation to drag on for some time. The detectives make the rounds of the witnesses again and again, until they piece it together. The show has a technophilic streak in the spirit of CSI. It is only through cutting-edge technologies that the detectives get their initial clues as to the victim's identity.

Witnesses and suspects are: Sir Phillip Cross (Trevor Eve), a wealthy businessman recently nominated by Her Majesty's government to be its ""entrepreneur czar"". Sir Philip is very conscious of his lowly roots and has a great deal to hide about his start in the business world. Lizzie Wilton (Ruth Sheen), a working-class woman who lived at Arlingham House at the same time as the victim. She now works with underprivileged youth and acts as a den mother to the soccer team her husband coaches. But, in her youth, she was a homeless alcoholic who found refuge in the community of skinheads. Father Robert Graves (Bernard Hill) is a vicar whose efforts to appear to be the man his family thinks him to be have led him down a dark path. Eric Slater (Tom Courtenay) is a wheelchair-bound retired accountant who did the books for Arlingham House. He and wife Claire (Gemma Jones), who suffers from dementia, are celebrating their 45th wedding anniversary.

The supporting cast is impressive even if the two detectives are a bit dull. The multiple mysteries of what relationship these people had to the deceased keep the audience interested over the course of six episodes. I found DCI Stuart to be distasteful in her self-righteousness determination to punish the perpetrator of a 40-year-old crime. If I took anything away from this narrative, it is that the detectives should have let sleeping dogs lie. Dredging up the past wrecked everybody's life and there was no justice to be had. Beyond that, the characters too often do things that don't make sense and act in a manner that is not credible in order to make drama. There are some holes in the solution that we finally settle on. And why would someone be prosecuted for robbery 40 years after the event?  ""Unforgotten"" is entertaining enough but not a must-see, as it suffers many of the problems common to contemporary British mysteries, including a surfeit of social agendas.",1525132800,,3798,4.874613003095975

The side plots were just depressing as heck, no sense of any satisfaction at the end, just brutal, dark, ugly, nasty - with plenty of UK political correctness shoved down your throat.

I have to admit though that I didn't buy HOW they summed up the ending (with all that thorough policing and meetings for MONTHS, one would think there would be more follow up questions after the suspect told *all*. Could have happened as claimed but it didn't make sense to me.)  Also is the 2nd son supposed to stand in for the universal *us*?

not only ridiculous ; but , it was also totally unbelievable. i found this ruined a well- acted story
& i found myself rolling my eyes & saying out loud , "" oh , please .""
embarrassing & sophomoric. how do these things get made ?

7455991,3,B0162TZ4D0,"Can't believe all the 5 star ratings.  We were so looking forward to this series....what an all star cast!  It has the makings of a good mystery, but the premise, that something that happened 40 years ago could be remembered so clearly, in detail, by persons who were in their teens and early 20's is ridiculous. The side stories were interesting but very soap opera....The Priest, the Skinhead, the evil Captain of Industry (he was the only one who really paid the price...why am I not surprised). The main story, the death of Jimmy, had potential.  The way it was solved was just not realistic.  No DNA evidence, no prints on a gun, knife, etc. There was nothing that really would have stood up in court if people had just kept their mouths shut. I ""AHA"" moment when DI Kahn found boxes of FORTY YEAR OLD bank statements, in a big box labeled ""Bank Statements"" is beyond absurd.  The cash machine receipts from 40 years prior....same.  The landlady who could remember the names of tenants of her (now torn down) hostel from 40 years ago.....Then there was the contrived twist ending....good grief!  Nicola Walker, who was great as Ruth in MI-5, was just too weirdly off.

7456011,4,B0162TZ4D0,"As I post this review on April 6, 2018 I see there are already 27 reviews here. The DVD and BD aren't even being released in the US until April 24, 2018 after the series has run on PBS in the US. (I was provided an advance screener by PBS in exchange for an objective review.). My assumption is that the reviews of the series are based on the PAL version (not NTSC). The series aired on  ITV (the British commercial TV network) in 2015.
First you should know that this the FIRST Complete Season.  And, yes there was a SECOND season. PBS has that scheduled to be released on May 15, 2018 so they are only one month apart.

Like some other British procedural police dramas (I immediately think of New Tricks), this series is about |cold cases. The trigger for this one is finding of a skeleton in the area where a building was being torn down. The head of the investigation division ((DCI Cassie Stuart) for some reason, is curious to know whose body it is and why he was murdered). She uses here fairly large department (I think there were 8 or 9 detectives) working full time (and overtime!) on nothing else. I won't tell you much more because this is a MYSTERY and  if youve read my other mystery DVD reviews  you know I HATE spoilers. (They call them mysteries for a reason. I highly suggest you avoid reading any reviews with spoilers.
What I thought was distracting (okay a small bit of info) was that there are a few of Cassies family members shown, but they never get involved in the central plot. And we learn that Cassie has a son and a father, but no husband. And she obviously has no social life. Okay, since there is a Season 2, we may learn more. But the murder case here is solved and there are no loose ends. (Thankfully)

This is the UK Edition which means that is is for US players but includes some graphic language (the F and S words) that were edited for PBS. Each of the six episodes runs about 47 minutes. (Remember this was on COMMERCIAL television in the UK).

There are English subtitles  which I found I often needed to get all the words. They are the moving titles that PBS has been using for last 3 or 4 years. They are not always at the bottom center of screen.. Sometimes they are on bottom left, sometimes bottom right and even at top of screen. They are small but in easy-to-read yellow.

There are no bonus features (not even the now-requisite Behind the scenes featurette)

I liked this series and glad I saw it. But its not up there with some other Masterpiece Mysteries. Hence 4 stars.
I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.

7456016,5,B0162TZ4D0,"Unforgotten is a six-episode 2015 British murder mystery and drama, created and written by British television writer and producer Chris Lang. The story line of Unforgotten centers around the activities of a team of London detectives, commanded by Detective Chief Inspector Cassandra Stuart, and her second-in-command, Detective Inspector Sunil Khan. They have been tasked with the investigation into the identity of a buried skeleton, that was unearthed at the demolition site of an abandoned North London residential building. As a result of their persistent detective work, it is established that the skeletal remains belong to a young man who had lived in the building almost forty years earlier, and who had apparently been murdered. The investigative process by which DCI Cassandra Stuart and DI Sunil Khan use a set of car keys that were found underneath the skeleton, to track down the vehicle to which the keys belong, and subsequently identify the murder victim, is absolutely fascinating. In fact, the entire depiction of the scientific procedures and techniques used by the forensic specialists is decidedly interesting and educational. As the story unfolds, the dramatic events in the lives of the main characters gradually emerge, and the intersection of these characters around the victim of the crime, almost forty years previously, provides the key to solving this murder mystery. As always, the performance of the lead actor, Nicola Walker, is outstanding, as is the performance of her primary supporting actor, Sanjeev Bhaskar. In addition, the performances of the other talented supporting actors, are truly stellar. Unforgotten is a decidedly intelligent, intriguing, and gripping murder mystery and drama, and I found it to be extremely engaging and entertaining. Unforgotten features superb plot and character development, as well as great acting performances, and it definitely merits a five-star rating, along with an enthusiastic recommendation.",1508976000,42,1970,5.548172757475083

Once again, though, it seems that every British (and Australian) series inevitably has to include a homosexual (or lesbian) aspect to the storyline. It is unnecessary to forward the plot and makes me squeamish especially if they show actual homosexual activity.

7456030,5,B0162TZ4D0,"I thought this was very good. A body is found of a man who has been missing since 1976. He was murdered. The lead detective, Nicola Walker, must inform the survivor, plus solve the case with the aid of her partner (also shown on box).  There are 4 families who are involved in this investigation as the detectives try to find out what happened. They all seem to be hiding some major secrets in their lives which may or may not pertain to the murder. These people are now all seniors. Most of them have adult children who are dragged into the case too since they are in some measure caring for their senior parents. Trevor Eve, who was the lead on the UK's cold case detective show for years, is one of the characters in one family. This is not an action adventure type of cop show with car chases and shoot outs. It is an involved and intricate crime story instead which is a staple for British tv.",1469577600,3,898,4.2823529411764705
