8627674,4,B000XPU5HA,"As a Bud Spencer fan this is one of my favorite movies that is not with Terrence Hill.
The typical Bud Spencer dry humor and plenty of fights are the highlights I love about this movie!",1513641600,,185,4.166666666666667
8627675,3,B000XPU5HA,"This is not considered one of Bud Spencer's best comedies. (Otherwise there'd surely be more editions and releases of it.) I still reckon it is good though, being a fan of Bud Spencer and Terence Hill comedies, including the music. It is also a good example of how American soldiers can misbehave in a foreign country, and thus be disliked.
This movie is basically the same story as '<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bomber/dp/B000GH3Q76/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bomber</a>', a later Bud Spencer comedy. A lot of Hollywood (& Hollywood type) movies have similar stories. I'd say that if getting this movie, also get ""Bomber"", for the complete story. One also mustn't confuse this movie here with the later Bud Spencer one '<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/They-Call-Him-Bulldozer/dp/B000AQHL38/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">They Call Him Bulldozer</a>', which came out after Bud Spencer stopped acting in comedies. (That movie is with the ninja, not the gridiron in this one.)
This DVD here has a bad soundtrack though. I could hardly hear what they were saying.",1210291200,,1135,6.1
