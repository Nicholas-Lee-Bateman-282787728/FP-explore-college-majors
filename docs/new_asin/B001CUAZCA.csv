3520224,4,B001CUAZCA,I loved this movie.  The acting was great and made me a fan of Michael Cumpsty.  Wilder did only two of these shows and I wish he'd do more.,1405814400,,140,3.793103448275862
3520225,4,B001CUAZCA,"This follow up is, I believe, a better story and produced movie. There is the added back story of the Nazi vs Jews and Cash's love interest more involved. It is interesting in these two movies that the citizen and police get along unlike a lot of amateur sleuth story lines.",1377907200,2,274,4.392156862745098
3520226,5,B001CUAZCA,"""The Lady In Question"" is a sequel to the television movie mystery ""Murder in a Small Town"" and both produced for the A&E Cable Television Network and as far as I know these are the only two Larry 'Cash' Carter films ever made, which is a great shame!  Both films were written in 1999 by Gene Wilder and Gilbert Pearlman.

(In case anybody wonders, Gene Wilder's version ""The Lady In Question"" is not to be confused with the Glenn Ford & Rita Hayworth movie from 1940 with the same title; where the plot of this Black & White movie is totally different!)

Synopsis:
Set in 1938, Gene Wilder plays Larry ""Cash"" Carter, a one-time Broadway theatrical director who has moved to a quiet Connecticut town in Stamford, where he oversees a community theatre group and works as a private investigator.  With his stewardess girlfriend, Mimi Barnes (Cherry Jones) and detective friend, Tony Rossini (Mike Starr), they investigate the murder of renowned philanthropist, Emma Sachs, who had strong anti-Nazi sentiments.  Emma, with her late husband, used to help Jews escape from Nazi Germany, and was also a friend of Cash.  There are nefarious servants, devious relatives, and an Axis agent all figuring into the deadly puzzle before Cash can determine the killer's identity.

What a real delight this film turned out to be.  It is a well-acted gentle mystery drama with many twists and turns and added humour in all the right places.  Gene Wilder with Cherry Jones have such great chemistry and are so charming that you can just feel their love and warmth for each other.  Their rapport is just heaven to watch.  (Incidentally, this is also true of ""Murder In A Small Town"").  I thought all the actors were brilliant and with a decent plot that kept the suspense going right till the end.

I thoroughly recommend this enjoyable film!!  And if you are also a Gene Wilder fan, you'll be in for a wonderful treat.",1238630400,13,1901,4.7560975609756095
8289928,5,B001CUAZCA,Gene Wilder was exceptional in this role.  Very well done.,1493337600,,58,4.8
8289929,5,B001CUAZCA,"I saw this movie and its sister film a long tome ago and loved it then.  It's reminiscent of English mysteries, meaning these is less violence and more detecting than American mysteries usually have.  It's also a period piece that recalls a less volatile and angry time, when people treated each other is a more genteel way than is common today.  Gene Wilder turns in a very nice performance as ""Cash"" Carter, and the rest of the cast makes the film a fun romp.",1489795200,,461,4.464285714285714

8289933,4,B001CUAZCA,"I saw this and Murder in a Small Town on A&E many moons ago and loved seeing Gene Wilder playing the role of a theater director/actor assisting the real detective with his investigations.  These are charming murder light kinds of stories with good actors and production value.  It may be the last thing Gene Wilder did before he died, not sure.  Judging by the cover I didn't have high hopes for the quality of the DVDs but ordered anyway.  That was a wrong assumption.  They are perfectly fine, no extras but very watchable with a nice clear picture.",1457481600,,551,4.581632653061225
