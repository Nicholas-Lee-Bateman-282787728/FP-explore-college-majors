So many incredible moments to that season from Griffey, RJ, Edgar, Tino, Blowers, Dan the Man, A-Rod's debut, the Sheriff, Joey Cora, Vince Coleman, the Bone, and more! This video tells an awesome story with the legendary voice of Dave Niehaus, and will be treasured in the collection of any Mariners fan!",1343433600,,346,4.982758620689655

8244923,5,B0012AMIN4,"I was born in good ole' 1995, the same year the Mariners and all of Seattle watched this unforgettable season. And I've grown up with the Mariners and been to a few games at Safeco Field, but I wanted to see footage of the Mariners in the Kingdome, and I really wanted to see highlights of this terrific Mariners season, and when I ran across this tape I had to buy it. Let me say, I'm not disappointed at all. I really learned a lot about the 1995 season, this tape was very informative. It is narrated by Mariners sportscaster Dave Niehaus and like usual, he did a great job. This videocassette gives an overview of the regular season showing some highlights and discusses the Mariners roster. After around thirty minutes I got a little tired of season coverage but the overview of the last twenty games of the season is when this tape really gets interesting, it's so exciting seeing the mariners face off against the Angels in a one game playoff and then of course the seven game series against the New York Yankees.

My personal favorite moments were seeing Seattle sports fans celebrating after the Mariners won the series against the New York Yankees, it's just such a nice feeling after the last several disappointing seasons the Mariners have been having. Any Mariners fan needs this, and if you weren't around to experience the 1995 season than this tape is especially for you. It's informative and exciting and I really appreciate the Mariners effort that season because if they hadn't gone to the playoffs, the Seattle Mariners might have relocated and we wouldn't have a baseball team. I know it seems tough waiting for another great Mariners season but if the next one is as good as the 1995 season, it'll be worth it.",1283817600,,1732,4.641693811074918
8244924,4,B0012AMIN4,"I came across this video recently and, as someone who's started up a website devoted to the team, I thought it was time for me to take a look back at highlights from this memorable season.  The first half of the video is fairly standard season wrap-up material: losses are glossed over, you get some profiles of a few players, an array of great or at least very good defensive plays, and so on. But you don't get a great sense of the pacing of the season.  Then, at the end of the season and the Yankees series, things pick up, with individual games getting pretty thorough coverage.  And at the end, even though the Mariners are losing to the Indians, the 15-minute ovation given to the team after they'd lost game 6 of the ALCS is really stirring.  That's the best moment of the video, a point where you get a strong sense of what the comeback meant to Mariners fans.",1205020800,2,869,4.345679012345679
