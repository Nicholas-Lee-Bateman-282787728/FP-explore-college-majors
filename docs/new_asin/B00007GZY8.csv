7977190,3,B00007GZY8,"I wish to make it known to people that the actual documentary itself only lasts 25 minutes.

It is very well photograped and has an appealing sound track, I purchased my copy for 5 dollars with free postage. So the price matched the content.

However I would not recommend paying more than 8 dollars for it including postage.

Of course that is my opinion a surfing fanatic may differ, but beware it is 25 minutes long plus some extras.",1332892800,2,436,4.493670886075949
7977191,5,B00007GZY8,"i really loved this video. not only are the surf shots spectacular, at great locations, but the pros explain the evolution of tow-in surfing  in a way that is interesting and entertaining. i am a non-surfer who just loves the sport, the cameraderie, the philosophy, the lifestyle, and the adrenalin rush involved. tow-in surfing was a major, major advance in the sport of big wave surfing.  this is an excellent video.",1329264000,2,418,4.873239436619718
7977192,5,B00007GZY8,"Simply the best extreme surf video I have ever seen. Soundtrack is tremendous. Great just to have playing in the background on a great entertainment system. All ages, no profanity, nothing questionable.",1288051200,,202,5.34375
7977193,4,B00007GZY8,"This has some of the most incredible waves ever caught on film/tape, and ""watermen"" who actually ride these monsters!  How?  By being towed into these impossible-to-paddle-into waves, while ""strapped"" to their boards.

Why do I give this 4 stars instead of 5?  Because it's TOO SHORT - just like the video ""LAIRD"" (also about tow-in surfing).  Truthfully, ""Laird"" AND ""Strapped"" should have been released on ONE DVD!",1145145600,,416,5.149253731343284
