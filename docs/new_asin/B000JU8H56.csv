2679454,5,B000JU8H56,"Just wanted to give everyone a heads up that Scorpion Releasing now has the rights to Day of the Animals and Grizzly and will be re-releasing them in 2013 on Blu-Ray, so keep an eye out for them!",1352678400,3,195,4.157894736842105
2679455,4,B000JU8H56,"This is a really fun set, the movies are all fairly cheesy, retro, and all about blood thirsty nature gone wrong. I was disappointed at the packaging, having 5 disks in 1 case and not individual retail per movie packaging as my other Shriek Show sets are, I was also disappointed with Day of the Animals only having been remastered in the TV version and not the Theatrical version, but aside from those two nitpicks it's definitely one of the better Shriek Show sets. Day of the animals and Grizzly both kind of look like made for TV movies from the 70's with the exception of Grizzly having occasional gory but super quick, like 2second shots of the bear's victims. I defiantly felt some late 70's nostalgia watching these two, the uniforms and era of Grizzly reminded me a lot of the old TV show CHiPs. Day of the Animals has Leslie Nilson in a very dramatic and crazy roll and is really entertaining. The kills in both movies are quite funny with the bear decapitating people with one swipe, and birds picking people up and carrying them away and the like. The biggest surprise for me with this set was Devil Dog, which turned out to be my favorite movie of the three. This dog is impregnated by Satan or something and the resulting offspring are demon dogs that have brain washing and mind control power over humans. The evil creators of the pups place one of them with this ""average American family"" to wreck havoc on their lives and do the dogs bidding, this is movie is nuts, I loved it. I'm sure there's tons of bonuses and extra features in this set with the addition of the 2 bonus disks, but I'm just in it for the flicks and all three of these are entertaining and fun.",1334102400,,1681,4.425806451612903
2679456,4,B000JU8H56,Thes are great movies and I am glad they put them together in a collection. Although some of the plot lines and ending could have been better. I won't disclose info but overall I was happy with this purchase,1315267200,,207,4.333333333333333
2679457,5,B000JU8H56,"First off, this is a fantastic deal - 3 movies, 5 discs in all (2 for Grizzly, 2 for Devil Dog and 1 for Day of the Animals). However, unlike their previous box sets, Shriek Show has chosen to include the 5 discs inside a single-style case. Not a bad deal, but it is different because I was expecting 3 DVD cases inside a slip box. This only applies to new purchases, as the older release was a box set.",1312588800,3,403,4.05
2679458,4,B000JU8H56,"I got this box set because my cousin has fond memories of ""Day of the Animals"".  I thought that movie was OK, the animal action was well directed and the movie had a sense of occasion, but overall I wasn't that impressed.  Grizzly was a bit worse in my opinion.  The gem here is Devil Dog which was really well done.  For me the dog never looked scary at all, it was cute and never menacing, other reviewers certainly disagree, but no matter because over all this is a great little horror gem.  For the price you might as well get all 3 movies.",1244505600,3,544,4.1923076923076925
2679459,4,B000JU8H56,"I bought this set solely for the two William Girdler movies; Day of the Animals and Grizzly. I have yet to view Devil Dog.

I read that William Girdler was a master low-budget filmmaker who felt movies did not have to be expensive to be hugely entertaining. Reading his filmography he seemed to be a real expert at capitalizing on a film's success and making a rip off of that film. That is the case with Grizzly, his most successful movie. Made a year after the phenomenal success of Jaws, the film earned the nickname ""Jaws with claws"".

It's very entertaining and somewhat suspenseful. It's low-budger, for sure, but made with passion and some of the gore effects here aren't half bad. The likable Christopher George does well in the lead and if you like these killer animal flicks than you won't want to miss Grizzly.

As for Day of the Animals, well, I liked that one too. It's no masterpiece but it deals with a hot topic at the time (the diminshing ozone layer and here it affects the animal life in negative ways) in a fun way. It must be said that it's stretched and not much happens for a long time but it's fairly atmospheric and those animal attacks are handled splendidly. Leslie Nielsen is dynamic as a crazy ad exec who feels he can take on a grizzly bear.

William Girdler's life was cut way too short but Grizzly and Day of the Animals are prime examples of how enthusiasm and drive could be all you needed to make films in the most interesting period of American moviemaking. Low-budget but ambitious movies aimed to entertain and they do just that.

Shriek Show presents these films in a very respectful manner. Grizzly is loaded with special features along with being presented in a very nice transfer. Two versions are included of Day of the Animals; a television print that is slightly cropped (at 1.85:1) which is marginally cleaner than the theatrical cut (in it's proper widescreen presentation 2.35:1). The television print is clean and good but I'd recommend the correct aspect ratio despite the occasional wear and tear.",1220832000,10,2048,4.662049861495845
2679460,2,B000JU8H56,"Now that we have HD, the analog feature films look so fuzzy.  But for the price, they provide a good scare for adults.  NOT for children.",1218153600,,137,4.230769230769231
2679461,5,B000JU8H56,Bought this special for a friend. he saw it when it came out. He is waiting till he gets a dvd player to watch it.,1422489600,,114,3.6
2679462,3,B000JU8H56,"The first two movies played great!  Of course the cheesy stories and gories were exactly what I expected.  Sadly Devil Dog-Hound of Hell stopped playing about 1/3 of the way through and I was unable to forward through the issue.  The disc appears pristine.  I'm disappointed that I was not able to view all three features, but it isn't really worth the effort for me to return it.",1420070400,,380,4.544117647058823
2679463,4,B000JU8H56,I enjoyed all 3.  Looked for grizzly for a long time.  Got it right away.  Very pleased.,1407715200,,88,4.0588235294117645
2679464,5,B000JU8H56,Picture quality was excellent. Better than I ever expected for a movie that old. A real pleasure. Comes in a three dvd set.,1396051200,,123,4.391304347826087
2679465,3,B000JU8H56,The movie had some interesting moments.  I liked the creature affects and overall story paste a little slow at first but overall good movie to cuddle up to.,1394928000,,156,4.571428571428571
2679466,4,B000JU8H56,"I received my purchase earlier than I expected.  It was securely wrapped and no problem with inner packaging.  I have watched just one of the movies.  I watched Grizzly.  The DVD is fine and I also remember it is an older movie so I didn't expect HD.  It played fine and there is plenty of action for an older viewer like myself.  I do not need a lot of CGI to enjoy a movie.  My grandson laughed when he saw what I had bought, but then agreed that for an older movie it was ""pretty good""  Thank you Amazon.com for the three in one package.  The movie Grizzly is very expensive if you buy just it.",1394496000,,597,4.077586206896552
2679467,5,B000JU8H56,"Devil Dog: A family adopts a puppy, which is the offspring of Satan having intercourse with a German Shepherd. Grizzly: A forest ranger must prevent future attacks by an enormous, 18 foot tall bear. Day of the Animals: Animals begin to go on a rampage in high altitudes, due to the depleting ozone layer of the atmosphere. Devil Dog strengths and weaknesses: aside from an outrageous plot, the film is surprisingly atmospheric and suspenseful. The special effects (by TV film standards) range from okay to kinda bad. The films climax is rather anti climatic, not the chasing part, the end ""fight"". The rest of the film is decent, with good acting. Grizzly strengths and weaknesses: Grizzly is a rip off of Jaws, done great. With suspense,atmosphere, and disturbing shocks. Most notably a 5 year old boy is shown being mauled in all of its gory scenery. Grizzly has a lot more blood than Jaws but isn't over flowing with it. The acting is great and so are the characters, overall pretty good. The score is pretty well done as well. Day of the Animals, strengths and weaknesses: the acting at times is pretty bad, but the characters are colorful and likable. The effects vary from good to laughable. I love the score a lot. The film has great atmosphere, suspense, and great characters. The story is interesting and original. Devil Dog: DVD rating- 5/5 Film rating-3/5. Grizzly: DVD rating- 5/5 Film rating- 4/5. Day of the Animals: DVD rating 5/5 Film rating 3.5/5 Final Thoughts: I am a bit biased towards Grizzly and Day of the Animals. I thought Devil Dog was okay, I liked but not loved it.

8153188,5,B000JU8H56,"There were  3 movies, 'Devil Dog Hound of Hell' was a household favorite of many back in the day.  It's the story of a family who adopt a little German Shepard puppy not knowing that it's mother was raped by a demon.  The story line was great and so was the movie.  A must see.

'The Day Of The Animals' was another good one that showed what could happen to our animal friends when the ozone layer is depleted.

'Grizzly' was great.  I'm not sure if it was Bart Bear who had the lead role, but just amazed that they get these animals to make these films.  The groups that went hiking were torn to bits by a very very very large carnivorous bear.  They had to resort to drastic measures to kill the bear.  I felt bad for the bear in the end",1490227200,,739,4.069444444444445
