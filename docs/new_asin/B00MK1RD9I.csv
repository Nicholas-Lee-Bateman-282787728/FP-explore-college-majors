8672809,5,B00MK1RD9I,"A surprisingly thorough documentary on the life and work of Neil Armstrong, which begins with his fascination with aviation from his childhood and includes his final days.  He was not only in love with aviation all his life, he was good at it.  Not only was he an outstanding pilot, test pilot, and astronaut, he was also trained as an engineer and taught aeronautical engineering after he left NASA.  He was on the panel of the Rogers Commission, which investigated the explosion of the space shuttle, Challenger.

The story is told partly in his own words, but includes interviews with friends, relatives, other astronauts, and manages to fit in a lot of information in an hour's time.

There are also a number of written biographies on his life, including the best-selling ""First Man -- the life and times of Neil A. Armstrong,"" by James Hansen.",1431302400,,848,4.820689655172414

8672812,5,B00MK1RD9I,"Neil Armstrong was a talent who got his flying license before his driving license and at age twenty he became a fighter pilot in Korean War. Although this documentary is about the star of NASA who was the first human to walk on the moon, it sheds light on those geniuses at NASA and the whole program that it makes United States of America to stand out for our accomplishments as it should since all those space trips require scientist, technology and pilots who can bring such tasks into reality. Not only we as proud Americans can accomplish such tasks unlike any other nation in the world, more importantly we should not slow down in our space missions but yet we should encourage, promote and support NASA with all that it takes. We should insure that NASA gets the budget that it requires them doing their job instead of allowing our legislators taking our money and supporting those bankers with billions of dollars, with no results to show. Armstrong was a talent, a man of destiny who gave the rest of us few moments of happiness and joy for what humans can accomplish once they use their knowledge and energy in science and technology. Armstrong's accomplishment brought joy to so many humans in so many nations regardless of race or religion in celebrating the power of human knowledge. I certainly did not experience such joy when our nation printed few hundred billion dollars to clean up the banking mess while our worthless legislators continuously flip about NASA's budget year after year. What Armstrong accomplished was as unique as who Armstrong was. What an amazing talent.",1419120000,6,1592,4.792727272727273
