6577719,4,B00MH8IV2W,"This set from TCM could be said to be the Cary Grant action pack.  Gunga Din, with Victor McLaglen and Douglas Fairbanks Jr.  Destination Tokyo with John Garfield.  The offbeat Arsenic and Old Lace.  But the inclusion of Sylvia Scarlet is a distraction.
First of all, it is a showcase of Grant's acting talents.  From the obnoxious con man in Sylvia Scarlet, to the calm even when scared to death submarine captain in Destination Tokyo, it is a pleasure to watch how he can bring humor to a single line, with a swagger or a droll comment.  A good set, but wish that TCM would have found something better than Sylvia Scarlet to have filled out the set.",1496966400,2,651,4.47457627118644

6577725,2,B00MH8IV2W,The conversion to DVD looks like it was done by a 5 year old.  But what do you expect from a cheap combo pack.  It comes with 4 disks for the 4 movies but the disk for Sylvia Scarlett has Disk 5 printed on it.  My favorite movie ever is Arsenic & Old Lace and have it on Blu-ray so this DVD went to my boys.  This was the first and probably last TCM combo purchase.  I'll pay more for them individually on Blu-ray as they come out.,1489881600,,431,3.852272727272727

6577745,4,B00MH8IV2W,"Over the recent years I have purchased many of the TCM Classic films 4 packs. Being a fan of Hollywood movies pre 1950 I have reacquainted myself with some old favorites and discovered some ""hidden gems"" from that era. I found this collection - Cary Grant Vol 2 - a mixed bag. In my opinion:
 DESTINATION TOKOYO: This is among the best WW2 navy submarine movies I have ever viewed. A real wartime classic
GUNGA DIN: Terrific production values for a 1939 film. Serious themes mixed with slapstick British army humor - dated.
SYLVIA SCARLETT; I could not finished watching this uninteresting, dull movie.
ARSENIC and OLD LACE - Was watchable
One GEM, one dud and two just OK - for the price not too bad if your a Cary Grant fan.",1470700800,3,726,4.5

6577747,2,B00MH8IV2W,Make sure you check that all DVD work before the return policy is up.  One move in the collection stopped running the last 5 minutes.  So you don't know how it ends unless you seen it before.,1467244800,,191,4.135135135135135

I love Cary Grant.  These look like they are the same DVDs that would have been released separately. Great quality and an excellent value.  Make sure and pick up both volumes.

6577764,4,B00MH8IV2W,"Nice collection of movies, received fast and undamaged. My only complaint would be against the actual TCM manufactures who put the packaging together; this is a 4 disc collection and all the discs are sitting on top of each other, you have to remove all the disc to get to one as there is no separate holders inside for each disc to be protected. I am a little worried that later on this might cause some damage to a disc later on.",1445299200,9,431,4.2682926829268295

6577769,5,B00MH8IV2W,"Gunga Din was the reason for my purchase of this set. It is one of my favorites! Destination Tokyo was very good. I have seen most of Grant's films, but had never seen that one before.",1441152000,,184,4.138888888888889
6577770,5,B00MH8IV2W,"Cary Grant never won an Oscar as a leading man.
He should have won several.
Be that as it may be, this four-film collection shows Grant as the consummate professional that he was. That is amply demonstrated in his performance in ""Sylvia Scarlet,"" in which he plays a role in support of a young (and very athletic) Katherine Hepburn, instead of the lead. This collection does feature Grant in leading roles, however, showing his comedic chops in ""Arsenic and Old Lace"" as well as his more dramatic skills in ""Destination Tokyo."" His ability to play a physically demanding adventure role in ""Gunga Din"" is also on display in this collection.
Although under-appreciated by his peers and the critics, Grant shows in these four films why he was an audience favorite for decades and, in this case, makes it abundantly clear that the people who actually paid to see his films were far better judges of his talents than other actors and those who reviewed his films.",1440374400,18,958,4.77710843373494
