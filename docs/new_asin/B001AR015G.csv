3464906,3,B001AR015G,"For such an amazing landscape this was a less than amazing presentation. Says filmed and mastered in High Definition but really did not look it. Voice over gave the wrong feel and did not match the potential beauty of the landscape,seemed kinda cheesy.  Whole presentation seemed like something that you would pick up from the info desk at the national park not a blu-ray release. Lightyears of difference between this and Planet Earth.",1233619200,17,436,4.972602739726027
3464907,4,B001AR015G,Wonderful picture quality. The Grand Canyon Though has a bluish picture effect that is annoying at times.,1225238400,13,105,5.235294117647059
3464908,5,B001AR015G,These National Parks are beyond description.  The programs are from the point of view of what you would want to see and do at the various locations.  The high definition pictures are superb.  This title should not be missed!,1224460800,12,224,4.6923076923076925

8278932,1,B001AR015G,"This was NOT filmed in HD. It was produced with normal film, and then put on Blu-ray.
It's grainy, and it could have been superbly beautiful, save for Ken Burns' disdain for digital video.
I've seen this on DVD, and I bought the Blu-ray, and there is no difference in picture on a blu-ray player that upconverts dvd, or plays the Blu-ray edition.

Ken?  I want my money back.  Coulda bought the dvd!  Bought the blu-ray, and it's grainy as a 4:3 tv with a videotape.

Maybe next time he'll use an HD camera with digital recording.  But I doubt it.",1259366400,5,547,4.366336633663367

8278935,5,B001AR015G,"Scenic National Parks: Crown Jewels Collection [Blu-ray]  is simply stunning.  My dream vacation is camping on a warm (but not hot) week in one of our national parks like Yellowstone, Yosemite or Grand Canyon.  This Blu-ray collection gives just a glimpse of the grandiose sights available at these three national parks.  Having visited the Grand Canyon, I can say this is an accurate visualization.  If you love nature, you'll love this set.",1236470400,3,442,5.083333333333333
