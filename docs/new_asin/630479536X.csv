8135958,5,630479536X,"Despedida de soltera is one of those movies we used to watch on TV and is always nice to watch from time to time. My fondest memory was a song that Leonorilda Ochoa performs at her TV show while the rest of the girls watch at home.
In this movie are Alicia Bonet (the bride), and her friends: Regina Torn (the feminist), Fanny Cano (the bombshell), Maricruz Olivier (the smart), Sonia Infante (the romantic) and the crazy in the TV show, Leonorilda, who, besides of being the most outrageously funny was the impractical joker, and the most tasteless one was to make the bride believe, a few days before the wedding, that her husband-to-be has kids with another woman.
The comedy is superb!",1316649600,,689,4.609756097560975
