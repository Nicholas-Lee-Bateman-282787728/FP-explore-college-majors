The uniforms for jr high school girls in Japan have absurdly short skirts; panties clearly visible even when standing straight up.
It's perfectly legal for grizzled old pre-verts to peep up those skirts.
People from Osaka have North Carolina Accents.
Blonde girls from Osaka are enthusiastic capitalists; they'll even let you peep up their skirts for money.
If a girl has purple hair with antennae, all of her sisters will have it.
Space flight was achieved and a prototype supersonic jet were developed long before the Wright Brothers.
The Rosecruzians control everything; The were behind both world wars. The Freemasons and Templars are irrelevant.
The Alchemist, Parcelsus accidentally poisoned himself with his own concoction meant to extend life because he was too old.
Jr. High School principals could possibly be 500 year old Rosecrezians who have taken Parcels' exlixir.
Jr. High School principals have big mustaches, glowing glasses and really stupid looking hair.
Jr. High School principals, after having used said elixir for 500 years die a really nasty death.
The administrative assistants to said Principals have really stupid looking green hair, large breasts, large butts and wear skirts that are tight and short to the point of being ridiculous.
All Japanese women and girls wear earrings with very large orbs.
Girls cloned in Rosecrezian cloning labs have pink hair and an attitude problem.
These pink-haired female clones can be cured of their evil by consuming pancakes.
Young women with extremely large breasts are evil.
Young women with extremely large breasts hate each other, except when they're drunk. Then they're pals
Female Pop singers with ZERO talent can be really successful. (but we all know that. America has no shortage of these)
Monsters can be created from mud by throwing hypodermic needles into the ground.
Really bad-ass monsters can be summoned by jabbing a sword into the ground.
NEVER NEVER NEVER EVER UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES Ever take a shortcut though a dingy alley.
A girl can win a guy's heart by preparing him a curried entre' of some sort.
Cute little cybernetic pets that look like light-bulbs with black eyes can do some really amazing things!
A very nice super genius 16-year-old scientist can get really pissed and violent if you don't want to go on a date with him in his invisible space fortress.
Lips (usually with lipstick) for no apparent reason appear on girls who achieve astral fusion.
Wearing a little teddy bear pin on your lapel makes you a real badass!
Jr. High School principals get really pissed if you mess with the forbidden power of the Apastroth. You risk getting nailed with a large, metal lighter.
At a Hot Springs resort, if you want to watch TV, you have to put coins in it!
If a roboticist and a software engineer have a daughter, she's nice, romantic, hyper as hell and just a bit of a dim bulb.
There is no such thing as ""filler"" episodes.  It's called ""character development"".",1342310400,,3008,4.980119284294235
8037641,5,B00062J094,"Sure, it's a bit absurd! But that's what makes it fun! I won't give a long dissertatoin of what this series is all about because anyone who would read these reviews probably knows this series well.  What you have here is a tounge-in-cheek story very thinly veiled as some sort of girly-girl Sailor Moon kind of thing.  The protagonists are a group of 5 girls around 12-13 years old. One, kind of cute and annoying(Hibari), the next one is a stuck up, snobby little rich girl(Suzume).  Next you're introduced to a jock-chick (Tsugumi) who idolizes and wants to be like a particular (marginally talented) pop singer. A little later the 4th girl is introduced. What's interesting about Kamome is that in the English dub, she has a pronounced southern drawl (pretty cool for a girl from Osaka!) A little more than half way through the series, you meet the 5th and final girl (Tsubame; she's from France). Tsubame is the most interesting as well as being the most popular amongst CTIA fans.  Tsubame is just plain EVIL! But Hibari's persistence on being friends finally breaks Tsubame's evilness and brings out the good in her. It takes about 3 viewings front to back to get all of the plot-line nuances.  The farther you go along in the series, the more twisted and ridiculous (in a good way) it gets.  The 3 villian chicks will have you lauging until you cry! The Principal of the school turns out to be in reality the 500 year old Christian Rosencreuz. His pal is the 3 century old Cigone Raspailles (who raised Tsubame..who was probably conceived in a cloning lab).  Now let's talk about the music.  I've read in some reviews that the music is ""sugary pop"".  That's poppy-cock! The music is FANTASTIC.  Songs written and performed by the talented Masami Okui really add to the series.  The rest of the music is great too!  If you like progressive jazz..check out the tune that plays whenever we see the Principal(Rosencreuz)is pretty cool
The bottom line is that this series is just plain fun! Fun for it's own sake!  So get comfy in your favourite easy chair, pour a cold one..and pop on your head-phones and turn it up!",1256601600,,2120,4.651474530831099
8037642,3,B00062J094,"I sort of have mixed feelings for this title. Some scenes were really cool

and all, but I just could not get into it. Not to mention some episodes were really repeatative. Not really sure of the story either.",1147824000,,209,4.358974358974359
