The video puts you at the side of the professional instructors as they explain and demonstrate proper casting techniques on the Orvis ponds. They demonstrate the knots essential to fly fishing as we join Rick Rishell, director of the fishing schools, who gives us an entertaining and informative slide show/lecture on how to select the right flies. I learned about dry flies, nymphs, wet flies and streamers, and when and how to use them.
I learned the basics of casting on moving water and how to present a fly that will fool trout, as well as how an experienced fisherman ""reads"" the water - picking out the most likely spots for trout.
Whether you have never picked up a fly rod before or just need to brush up your technique, The Orvis Fly-Fishing School is invaluable - a full course of instruction in a single video!",1058745600,5,1008,4.605555555555555
