2823879,2,B000PISZ7M,"A heron flies across a country road in Montana. [No dog to bark a warning about visitors?] The cowboy is told about an imprisoned terrorist in London; does he know too much? Armed police patrol the London airport. [Are messages still passed in matchbooks? Would burning matches set off a smoke alarm?] The Contractor climbs into a steeple to perform his assigned task. The police seal off the area and stop cars from leaving. Will the Contractor escape? Will the surveillance cameras record all people? High-level police officers confer about this problem.

Why is there no help at the safe house? Would a young girl be so helpful to a stranger? Will he be recognized at the airport? The armed British police shoot at him. So does another person. If Jackson can't fly out of the country where will he go? Will the British SWAT team succeed in locating the fugitive? Could forensics identify the pistol that shot Superintendent Windsor? [Does the story get bogged down in the middle?] There is another chase through crowded streets. The British SWAT team uses H&K MP-5 machine guns like their US counterparts. Every telephone is Britain is tapped! [George Orwell's ""1984"" warned about this.] Will they intercept Jackson's call? Will the sound of gunshots alarm the public? There is a chase in the Underground. [A hooded jacket hides a person's face.]

There is another shoot-out in the kitchen of a hotel, done for dramatic effect. It doesn't disguise the lack of a good story. ""It was never personal"", they just followed orders. At the end Jackson rides out of town, like some cowboy in some old western movie. It is not a good ending. The use of mercenary assassins by a government is a topic that deserves a better film that this. You can read Norman Lewis' ""The Sicilian Specialist"", or Richard Condon's novels ""Winter Kills"" or ""The Manchurian Candidate"". Note that a professional killer will use a rifle so he can escape to collect his payment.

2823881,3,B000PISZ7M,"The Contractor stars Wesley Snipes as an assassin who goes to London to kill a terrorist but gets framed for another murder. Set in London, it has a good supporting cast of English actors including Charles Dance, Lena Headey and young Eliza Bennett. For the most part, it's a standard action story, and the occasional dramatic scenes feel a bit out of place, especially those between the young girl and her grandmother. I would have liked less drama and more action from this type of movie. Also, the motivation of the bad guys is somewhat unclear. Still, it was entertaining enough for three stars.",1207353600,,599,4.769230769230769

2823883,2,B000PISZ7M,"If you're looking for an action film with car chases, shoot-outs and explosions, you will be disappointed with ""The Contractor,"" which looks more like an old-fashioned cat-and-mouse thriller. The new Wesley Snipes film, it seems, is a blend of ""Shooter"" and ""The Professional"" (aka ""Leon"") with less actions and emotional intensity.

There is virtually nothing new about the story. Wesley Snipes plays James Dial, a retired sniper who is called in to do another job for men in suit. Of course, he is reluctant, accepts the job anyway and completes the mission, but not in the way he first expected and James must survive and fight back on his own as a stranger in London (but the film is shot in Bulgaria).

This stoic hitman is unexpectedly helped by a lonely, troubled 14-year-old girl Emily he encounters while hiding from his enemies. This is the most memorable part of the film because of the presence of Eliza Bennett (""Nanny McPhee""). You don't find the chemistry between Jean Reno and Natalie Portman here, but their acting is surprisingly good, making their unlikely friendship pretty convincing.

[NICE SUPPORTING CAST] In fact, the supporting actors are one of the merits of watching ""The Contractor,"" of which cast includes, besides Eliza Bennett, veterans like Charles Dance, John Standing and Gemma Jones, plus Lena Headey (Queen Gorgo of ""300"") as Inspector Ballard.

In spite of their names, however, action scenes need more originality and tension and I don't think the hectic camera work really helps. Moreover, Dance and Headey are sadly wasted, especially the latter, having not much to do in the film's by-the-numbers story. The film is better than you may think, certainly better than most of Snipe's previous direct-to-DVD films, but not much improvement either.",1191196800,2,1785,5.102739726027397

2823887,1,B000PISZ7M,"This is probably one of the worst movies I've seen in a while. The story line was very similar to ""Shooter"" but the action and realism didn't compare. Overall it was pretty hard to sit through.",1184025600,2,193,4.388888888888889
2823888,3,B000PISZ7M,"The Contractor, formerly known as The Shooter, and not to be confused with Mark Wahlberg's ""Shooter"" is a movie starring Wesley Snipes as a CIA agent who is assigned to kill a terrorist, only to be framed for another murder. To complicate things more, Snipes will make friends with a teenager who will become his most valuable ally.

I have to say I find this film very straightforward, unimaginative, hardly believable on certain aspects, and just mildly entertaining. At times it feels like an amateur attempt to create a movie and innovate certain cinematographic aspects, but stays as an attempt. Even Lena Headey, who I always find her acting abilities exceptional, feels weak as Inspector Ballard, the one in charge of bringing Dial (Snipes) down. Eliza Bennet as the teenage girl who helps Snipes makes a very good job, even if certain aspects of her character are not believable. It's obviously not her fault, it's the writers'.

So I rate this movie as an average movie, with certain plot holes and pointless scenes. If you want some decent stuff by Wesley Snipes, take a shot, and there's the plus of having Lena Headey in it.

It's 90 minutes where you can enjoy a movie if you're not feeling too picky.",1182038400,15,1214,4.771428571428571

2823920,2,B000PISZ7M,"This so called thriller or action has few thrills and the action is mostly pro-forma.  Wesley Snipe at the acme of his fame made it all the way to the third tier of action stars and has declined from there.  In this direct to video yawn fest he plays a CIA hit man who gets set up by his bosses to take the fall for a hit in London.  There is some good interplay between the American and the British operatives with the Americans trying to push into the comfort zone of the London police department detectives investigating the original hit.  In the supporting cast we have Lena Headey as a London Detective who works under Charles Dance, another London Detective and her father.  The pair famously play father and daughter in the fabulous Game of Thrones on HBO.
  The story has a young teen age girl who aids the innocent fugitive which does not work very well, which I blame on poor writing.  There are four different writers involved in the movie which is often a danger signal.
  Director Josef Rusnak over uses odd fast-slow film tricks which add nothing to the enjoyment of the story.  Aside from one cool fight where Snipes smacks a careless bad guy with a pipe-which I quite liked-there is very little which would recommend this film.",1456531200,,1243,4.5291479820627805

2823922,1,B000PISZ7M,"The action scenes are pretty good, but the story is awful -- despite all the FAKE, paid-for 5-star reviews.

You can spot fake reviews because 1. they're brief, saying nothing specific about this film; 2. often make pointless references to their personal lives, to fill space and sound ""real""; 3. the reviewer usually posts many brief 5-star reviews on the same day (with one or two lower-ranked reviews to look ""real"").

Yes, fake reviewers are often ""Verified Purchasers"" -- marketers give them a product code to get the DVD for free, so the review looks more ""real.""

So, what's wrong with The Contractor?

Let's begin by setting this film in its context. The Contractor belongs to a subgenre of spy thriller wherein the CIA kills its own LOYAL agents. The template was set by&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Six-Days-of-the-Condor/dp/B0064T4ZPC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Six Days of the Condor</a>, later filmed as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/3-Days-of-the-Condor/dp/B00AEBB9EG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">3 Days of the Condor</a>. Having the CIA kill its own LOYAL agents is a weird conceit. Instead of fighting the KGB (as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/James-Bond/dp/B0126ZK6GE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">James Bond</a>&nbsp;would do), these films have the CIA eating its own (e.g.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Scorpio/dp/B000035P5Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Scorpio</a>). I don't know of any films wherein MI6, the Mossad, or even the KGB targets their own LOYAL agents, but apparently the CIA is its own agents' deadliest enemy.

In The Contractor, Wesley Snipes is a retired CIA assassin. As is often the case, he's burned out, jaded, cynical. He now lives peacefully on his bucolic ranch. (Kinda like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Rambo/dp/B0004Z33EQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Rambo</a>&nbsp;at the Buddhist monastery.) But the CIA needs Snipes back for ""one last mission."" Snipes is such a bad-ass expert, only he can do the job. Snipes agrees, even as he contemptuously disses his CIA boss.

WHY is Snipes so contemptuous of his mission? He's being asked to kill a terrorist against whom Snipes has a personal grudge. Snipes should approve of his mission. The scriptwriter seems confused about his main character's motivations.

As is usual for this subgenre, Snipes is quickly betrayed by the CIA. WHY?

Actually, Snipes is only ""sort of"" betrayed -- but not really -- which makes for an odd film. Seems the scriptwriter is confused about many of his story elements.

Here are some details:

Great Britain has captured this terrorist. But Britain is about to release him. Bail or some legal technicality. Who knows? Not the writer. The specifics are never clarified.

So the CIA sends Snipes to assassinate this terrorist in London. In London!

WHY would Britain release this terrorist? The script makes it clear that the man is guilty. That he's ruthless. A real mass-murderer. He's killed over 200 people! So WHY would Britain release him -- especially in a post-9/11 world? I'm not saying the law shouldn't be followed, but since 9/11, the U.S., Britain, Israel -- a host of nations -- have bent any law that hinders the ""war on terror."" Innocent people have been imprisoned and tortured on false charges of terrorism. So WHY would Britain release a KNOWN terrorist?

This plot point makes NO SENSE.

The CIA tells Snipes that he's playing by ""Moscow Rules"" -- which apparently mean that if he fails in his mission, ""He's already dead."" This is another way of saying, as in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mission-Impossible/dp/B011MUA5J2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mission: Impossible</a>, that ""If you are caught, the Secretary will disavow any knowledge of your actions.""

Snipes agrees to these rules.

But after Snipes kills the terrorist (early in the film, so this is no spoiler), Snipes fails to make a clean getaway. The British police have his image and are after him. So Snipes hides in London until he can escape Britain.

Snipes phones his CIA boss, seeking help to escape. WHY? Snipes accepted the ""Moscow Rules."" Seems he's changed his mind. So now Snipes has betrayed the CIA. (Well, sort of betrayed, but not really -- did I mention the script was confused?)

Now the script gets REALLY bizarre. Rather than help Snipes escape Britain, the CIA wants to kill Snipes -- on the streets of London! -- before the police capture him. WHY? All the CIA wants is to bury the story. Hiding Snipes in a safe house (apparently, the CIA has safe houses in London) until it's safe to move him out of Britain is what both Snipes and the CIA want. So WHY does the CIA instead decide to kill Snipes?

Compounding the CIA's villainy -- and stupidity -- the CIA sends four assassins after Snipes, gunning for him in the streets of London. In one scene, a CIA killer enters a London restaurant's kitchen, and starts machine-gunning away, causing everyone to scatter, because Snipes is hiding somewhere in the kitchen.

C'mon! This is not Baghdad. This is LONDON. A U.S. ally. How realistic is it for CIA assassins -- in sharp, dressy, black government suits AND VISIBLE EARPHONES -- to shoot up London stores and restaurants, in broad daylight?

The CIA even assassinates a London police Chief Superintendent who gets too close to the truth.

But the script gets stranger still.

Naturally, the London police want to know who's shooting up their fair city, killing terrorists and police alike. But a high level British official -- attached to the foreign office? -- tries to place the London police under the authority of  ""the Americans,"" telling the (later killed) Chief Superintendent that all information is to be sent directly to this American gentleman (Snipe's CIA boss).

HUH?

It's not clear if this British official knows the CIA master-minded the killings. (Did I mention the script was sloppy and confused?) Either way, it seems the CIA has puppets among the highest levels of the British government. So WHY didn't the CIA work with them to find a less violent -- and less attention-getting -- way to kill the terrorist, or simply keep the terrorist in prison, or get Snipes out of Britain?

The Chief Superintendent later snarls about ""the Americans"" and makes it clear to his subordinates that he will disobey these orders. He won't share information with ""the Americans."" This means that he's a Good Guy.

Confusingly, Snipes is also supposed to be a Good Guy -- but HOW so? He violated British law in killing the terrorist. But if that was a Good Thing, are not the police the Bad Guys for trying to stop and arrest Snipes?

Snipes also betrayed the CIA by not living up to ""Moscow Rules."" He wants to blow the CIA's plans in Britain. So no matter which side is morally correct, Snipes betrayed that side. Yet he's supposed to be the morally pure character in this film. WHY? Because he befriends a troubled teenage girl?

Yes, this film has a warm & fuzzy subplot about a troubled teenage girl and her grandmother. The teen girl finds a bleeding Snipes in an empty apartment -- and helps hide him even after she learns the police are after him. She trusts and believes in him because ... because, she says, she's a liar, and it takes a liar to know a liar, so she knows that Snipes is telling the truth.

HUH?

Did I mention the script was stupid? And confused? And sloppy? About character motivations, and moral themes, and how spies, diplomats, courts of law, the police, and even teenage girls operate in real life?

The Contractor is set in London, but was shot in Bulgaria. In Sofia, I guess. It worked for me. No identifiable London locales (obviously), but the set decorator did a decent job in making Sofia look like London might look like, for those of us not too familiar with the city.

Blooper: One character is called Superintendent, but later he's called Chief Superintendent. Okay, I guess a Chief Super can also be called a Super. But still later, a radio news report identifies him as an Inspector. Did I mention the script was sloppy?

Some of the chase scenes were well-staged. If you want a (truly) mindless action flick, this film is ... okay. Although even as an action flick, The Contractor suffers from several long, boring segments. Specifically, Snipes's growing friendship with the troubled teen girl, and the girl's troubled relationship with her grandmother, and how Snipes helps heal their emotional wounds and become a family again. (No, I am not making this up -- I did say the script was stupid, confused, and sloppy, didn't I?)",1452816000,3,8762,5.2701149425287355

The film opens with a young male being pursued, beaten and Mirandized by the police. We then jump to 3 years later with Javier (Danny Trejo) spying on the Chase family by taking photos. At this point everyone but Shaggy has got the plot figured out. Paul Chase, an attorney ... get it Chase an attorney, Oh how clever. Anyway, he was a former DA and now wants to remodel his kitchen in time for his wife's charity event. Unable to secure a contractor for twice the price of my doublewide, he turns to Trejo who sends him an e-mail from a friend. Apparently not everyone's idea of re-doing the kitchen is buying new contact paper to put over the old faded stuff.

The funny clue is that Paul(Brad Rowe) remarks that Trejo has a ""familiar face."" Seriously? Like someone could forget that mug.

2823952,4,B000PISZ7M,"The Contractor(released July/10) stars,among others,Wesley Snipes as James Dial,Eliza Bennett as Emily Day,Lena Headey as Inspector Annette Ballard,Ralph Brown as Jeremy Collins,Charles Dance as Chief Superintendent Andrew Windsor and Gemma Jones as Mrs Day. This is yet another in an unspeakably long line of such films dealing with covert ops agencies,getting into trouble in foreign lands,portrayed as""rogue"" by their superiors,and having to fight for their life and justice. However this film has just enough of a unique story line that it takes it up a notch to become a quite satisfying flicker.
The story intro's us to James Dial,a secret black ops agent. Years before in the military he had a chance to take down a well known terrorist,but he narrowly let him slip through his fingers. Today,at his home in the mountains,he is being approached by his agency,specifically an agent Collins,who offers him a final chance to take down the one that got away. He accepts and lands in London,being greeted by a British contact there who goes under the name of Mr. Whitley. Disguised as a priest Dial enters a church to climb the steeple tower. There he has a birds eye view as the British authorities unload the terrorist and walk him inside. Dial is unable to get a clean shot outside,so he waits for his chance and gets him inside. The police are immediately swarming the entire vicinity and Dial and Whitley try desperately to elude them. Their trail gets picked up quickly,and the chase is on. It ends with the car upside down on stairs leading to a subway. Whitley is dead and Dial barely makes it out,setting his briefcase to explode as he does.
Dial flees to Whitley's apartment to nurse his wounds. A 14 year old,Emily,who lives in the building notices Dials entrance. She lives next door to Mr Whitley,with her grandmother. Knowing Mr. Whitley well and being a precocious and nosy girl,she enters Mr Whitley's apartment under the pretense of looking for a cat,which she doesn't own. The two slowly become friends and the girl makes it her business to help Dial anyway she can. When Dial is well enough he ventures outside to make a call to Collins. He realizes Collins set him up and doesn't disclose his location. Collins puts pressure on the local constabulary to disclose any info on Dial they get and he makes it clear that he wants him back. Chief Superintendent Windsor and his daughter Inspector Ballard,on the case,do not trust Collins and vow to tell them very little.
Dial meanwhile makes a dash for it at the airport. He only gets so far and is forced to flee into the bowels of the airport facility. There Collins and his minions follow and try to kill Dial. Dial gets away from them but is caught by the Chief Superintendent. He in turn is shot dead by Collins. Dial flees back to the apartment. Dial's next move is to get a passport. He goes to a well known forger and pays half down for a fake,intending to return later when it is done. However the police have been tipped off by the owner himself and are awaiting Dial upon his arrival. Emily goes with Dial to the passport office and offers to go ahead to make sure there's no police there. She walks in and sees nothing untoward and walks out. The police however are there. She gives Dial the prearranged signal for the all clear and he starts walking towards the office. In the meantime Emily has spotted Collins and his men coming in from a back area and she runs to warn Dial. Dial gets the other prearranged signal and he runs for it. The chase ends up in the subway system and two of Collins men are taken out,and Dial escapes. Dial now changes tack,and contacts the Inspector directly. He arranges to meet her alone in an abandoned mall. When they meet Dial hands over the evidence he has on Collins and his activities. He tells her that it was Collins who killed her father,not he. Collins however has tapped the Inspectors phone and he is there with his men. A shoot out starts and Dial while shot,is able to save the life of the Inspector,who both flee the mall. Collins chases Dial into a restaurant and the final shootout occurs,and Dial is the last man standing,with yet another bullet wound to show for it. The police now have the evidence on Collins and a video of him shooting the Superintendent and Dial is cleared. Dial says a tearful goodbye to his young friend as he leaves on a tram and for America. The film comes to a close as Emily and her grandmother receive two fares to Dials' ranch in the States. There Dial,with Emily's help,releases one of his prized horses into the wild.
If this film had just been about Snipes being accused of going rogue and fighting his way back for exoneration,it would have joined a pantheon of other such related films in the genre. However this one takes it to another level by introducing Emily. He not only has to look after himself and Emily too,but the two become close friends through the turmoil they encounter. That whole secondary story is very endearing and alot of the credit goes to young Eliza Bennett who is one cracker of an actor. She really brought a vulnerability and believability to the part which greatly enhanced the entire film. Also on board are actors Ralph Brown and Charles Dance,who are fabulous in their respective parts. I last saw these two working together in Aliens 3. Honourable mention also goes out to the editors who did a bang up job of visibly moving the film along when it needed to.
Technically speaking the film is in its w/s a/r 1 :85:1 and is clear and crisp. The only extra is a featurette on the film.
All in all a nice action/drama of covert ops gone wrong and the endearing friendship that develops between a young girl and the man under fire. Recommended.",1361664000,,5736,4.635559921414538

2823955,4,B000PISZ7M,"This film has been done quite a few times with other actors, with some small variations, and some tidbits from other shoot-um-up films, yet it is still enjoyable, exciting, and suspenseful. Wesley Snipes is an angry, laconic ex-CIA killer, a marksman, who failed to kill an Arab terrorist in the past and, although retired, is asked by his former handler to shoot and kill the terrorist, to finish what he didn't finish before. He is joined by a partner he doesn't trust. Events go wrong in England after the shooting and Snipes is pursued by the English police who want to arrest him as well has his former handler and men of his squad who are trying to kill him. Snipes is helped by a young girl who says she ""lies all the time."" The American handler tries to work with the English police but the senior officer doesn't trust him.

Viewers will enjoy trying to figure out what is going on. Even if they can figure it out because they have seen many such films, they will still enjoy seeing how it is played out in this version. Is this a rogue CIA operation? Is Snipes the rogue agent? Why do the Americans want to kill him? Why did they want him to kill the terrorist? What will happen between the English and Americans?",1341100800,4,1223,4.435555555555555
2823956,3,B000PISZ7M,"Overall, while not the best thriller I've seen, I enjoyed it.
Like several other reviewers have already stated, this movie's story is similar to other movies, much better movies with stronger stories.  It's the overdone plot, man gets hired to assasinate someone, then the tables turn and the hunter becomes the hunted, thrown in a little ""I was framed"" for good measure, and you've just about got the story.
However, for me, there was one major addition that set this movie apart from being just another thriller, and that was the relationship the hunter (Snipes) has with the next door neighbor, a teenage girl.  No, no hanky panky, just a lonely girl seeking someone to talk to and help.  Snipes ends up seeking solace at his side kick's (who got killed) safe house when things go bad, and the girl becomes his new best friend.  Despite Snipes best attempts to get rid of the girl and have her stop bothering him, he ends up enlisting her help as he recovers and tries to figure out who framed him, and how to get out of England.
Also add Scotland Yard Inspector, Lena Headly (pre Sarah Connor Chronicles tv series), who did a great job as well, and ends up helping Snipes, who she had previously believed killer her partner.
Good movie, not great, but good enough that I will add it to my 'to buy' list.",1280620800,4,1307,4.548936170212766
