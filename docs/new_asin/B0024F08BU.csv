Too bad it was filmed back before HD became the standard.  This is basically VHS quality video, but the content is what makes it great.  I think it was filmed in a different format for European players, originally, and must have been adapted for our NTSC format here in the U.S. because video motion is very jerky when the camera pans a shot.  A little unnerving at first, but once you get used to it, it's no big deal.",1353024000,2,560,4.355769230769231
8350617,4,B0024F08BU,"As the previous reviewer point out the music is not very good...it's a bit outdated.  It sounds like music from the beginning of New Age music and they weren't quite sure where to go w/it.  The video is a bit jerky, but once you get used to it it's not so bad.  The gardens are gorgeous, which is the real reason for watching this.  It's not an instruction video it is a tour of the gardens of the National Trust, nothing more, nothing less.  If you love looking at gardens of manor homes, then go ahead and buy it!",1277078400,14,515,4.161616161616162
8350618,1,B0024F08BU,"There had been a wonderful series on the gardens of the National Trust on a HD television channel. Although I knew that this series was not the more recent one, I was hoping that it would be equally as interesting and engaging.

Not so. I like Alan Titchmarsh's work very much but this appears to be early in his career as a presenter and none of the wit and intelligence shines through a very pedestrian presentation. The camera work is just awful, very amateurish. A long pan shot of one garden jerked and jumped to rest on a view of one of the National Trust's homes. Weekend home movies are better shot.

The production is simply not interesting. The musical score is only occasional and not inspired. There are long stretches where there is neither music or commentary to accompany the views.

The DVD that I purchased here seemed to have been a returned item as there was very apparent use of the box. And the DVD did not play smoothly.",1255564800,24,942,4.497076023391813
