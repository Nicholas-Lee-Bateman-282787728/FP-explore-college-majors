8216363,5,B000V3LG22,"Bedrooms and Hallways is one of my favourite movies of all time. Rose Troche has made a film that captures the essential characteristics of life in an inner city  location. The characters are, like most British films, lifelike and authentic. The actors are interesting, and they create characters who bring an interesting dimension to the film.
Some people will find the content of this film offensive and/or challenging. The sight of two male characters snogging is enough to offend a lot of viewers. However, the storyline is robust enough to transcend the 'gay interest' pigeon hole. The story does not focus on the homosexual love themes, but includes them in a broader storyline that devotes far more of the plot to the exploration of heterosexual relationships. There are plenty of clever inclusions for intelligent viewers and movie buffs. For instance, there is a phallic symbol strategically located in nearly every scene, and finding them, and other satirical elements, is half the fun of watching this film. (This self-awareness of the classic unconcious 'projection' gives the movie a definite post-modern quality). At one point, two of the central characters are seen arguing about a movie, as to whether it was 'pastiche' or 'satire'. The movie they obstensibly went to see could just have easily been this one! There are numerous double entendres throughout the film that are very funny, in that understated, erect British manner. The film pokes a lot of cheek at the whole 'new age' scene, but without being preachy or denigrating. The film does not take itself too seriously, and this is why it is able to make some interesting and challenging social comments without being offensive or lame. The scenes of the men having a 'wild man' weekend camp are hilarious, and so typical of urban men taken out of their comfort zone. In conclusion, this film is funny, bright, articulate and cheeky - though it will take some viewers out of their own prosaic comfort zone and challenge them with a new perception of what is, or should be, totally acceptable.",1324166400,3,2065,4.9855072463768115
