972444,1,6305120242,"Not since the ""Pet Rock"" has there been a bigger rip off!  This is bad home video set to music.  This should be titled ""A Truly Horrible Video of Caucasian Baby Faces"".  A note to the producers - try a tripod and learn about lighting.  A note to the folks whose houses were used for the shoots - try cleaning before inviting guests in.  Every person who has ordered this should be given a letter of apology along with a refund.",981590400,4,427,4.222222222222222
972445,1,6305120242,"Maybe I'm missing something, but this video is just terrible. The quality was very amateur and the voices singing the nursery rhymes were very irritating. We turned it off after 5 minutes. Maybe my daughter will grow to love it, but she really didn't seem interested. I'll have to pop it in every now and then and see .",981417600,,319,4.423728813559322
972446,5,6305120242,"My 1 year old loves this tape.  I have bought many tapes with baby faces, babies playing, etc., but this is the one she loves.  I recommend it to all my friends with new babies.  It is also nice because you learn the words to all the nursey rhymes.",976752000,8,248,4.020408163265306
972447,3,6305120242,"The only way I can describe my 11-month-old son when he watches this video is ""enraptured."" He actually goes up to the TV and tries to touch the babies on the screen. When it's over, we have to let him watch it  rewind, because he cries if you try to turn it off. He will basically sit  there and watch it as many times as you play it.
My complaint about this  video is that the production quality is ABSOLUTELY AWFUL! The sound track  is a bunch of spliced-together nursery rhymes and children's songs. The  singers sound as if they are singing from the interior of a coconut or some  other muffling enclosure. Some of the songs are very irritating, and at one  point it sounds as if the cartoon character, Droopy Dog, is singing. The  editing is very amateur, and watching the babies eat is a little gross.  However, as I said, my kid loves it.",943401600,11,846,4.337579617834395
7883843,5,6305120242,"I purchased this video when my first Granddaughter was born, 15 1/2 years ago, it was amazing how she would watch this over and over again.  No other video entertained her like this one, not even Elmo.  Now I have been blessed with another Granddaughter, she is 16 months and I dug out this treasure of a video two weeks ago and oh my goodness, she loves it as much as her sister did. It is amazing to here her ask to see the babies and my only wish is that it was on DVD so we wouldn't have to wait for it to rewind but I'm sure happy that I have a DVD/ VHS combo unit to play it on.  I would buy one if I didn't and I would gladly pay $25 for a good used copy.  Believe me Mom's and Grandma's it is so worth it!",1334102400,,713,3.7651006711409396
7883844,4,6305120242,"We've bought several different baby faces videos over the years, but this one is the only one we've had consistently work for toddler/baby after toddler/baby.

First, the voices are very friendly.  The children singing especially gets their attention.

Second, the videos of babies are cute and focus mostly on the babies eyes and faces, just what little ones want to watch.

The clarity of the videos are 80-90's home video though.  This is simply because of how they made the video.  It's not high definition, but my daughter didn't care.  The songs are repetitious and cheesy... but this is for BABIES, not adults.  Nursery songs and rhymes (which is what they use in the entirety of the program) are in nature repetitious and cheesy.

We love to put this one in the old VHS player while I make up something for lunch.  It keeps her happy and entertained, the nursery rhymes are educational, and it ends with relaxing, sleeping babies.  One warning.  After so many playings of it, you tend to get the songs stuck in your head... ugh.",1236902400,,1036,4.726256983240224
7883845,5,6305120242,But both of my babies have LOVED it. The music is awful and sometimes even old fashioned and misogynistic and the video footage is really badly produced but there is something about this video - especially the beginning that both of my children really gravitated toward. Don't expect crisp production like Baby Einstein - this really is pretty poor quality. But if you need 15-20 minutes to a shower or do a load of laundry this just might do the trick.,1184544000,,453,4.604938271604938
7883846,4,6305120242,"This video is simply a pastiche of what appear to be home videos of babies and toddlers, cobbled together with a simple soundtrack of children's songs. But it works.  Our 1-year old stays interested and interacts with this video more than any other than the Baby Einstein series (which are in a superior class by themselves).  Bonus: if you love kids, you'll likely find yourself ""oohing"" and ""ahhing"" over some of the little ""talent"" doing the things you kid does, too.",1076457600,,470,4.790123456790123
7883847,3,6305120242,"My adopted son is just at the age where he loves to crawl away when you look away.  With BABY FACES in the VCR, he sits still with his older brother, who is 13 months.  This video is part of our weekly rotation of videos.  Recommend.",1050969600,,233,4.021739130434782
7883848,1,6305120242,The video itself is grainy and well cheap looking.  My 5 1/2 month old doesn't like it very much though he likes books with baby faces in them.  The songs that are the soundtrack for this video are really really annoying.  I would not reccomend this video.,1044576000,,256,4.404255319148936
7883849,4,6305120242,Good video for babies.  My 8 month Son loves it.,1039478400,,48,3.8
7883850,5,6305120242,"I can not say enough good things about this video.  It is full of babies.  We bought it when our first child was 5 months.  She loved it for over a year and still likes it at 2 and a half.  Her sister, now 7 months, loves it just as much.  For both, it is interesting and calming. It is also great way to learn many songs, etc.  If I could buy only one video for a baby, this is the one I would pick.
I wrote this a year and a half ago.  We now have a second child who loves it as much as her sister did  (""I want Baby Faces"").",1019865600,2,527,3.601769911504425
7883851,5,6305120242,"I got this video on the recommendation from another mom. As soon as I put this in, my daughter was entranced. She absolutely loves this video and watches it all the time. The little video snippets of other babies doing everyday things as well as silly things catches her attention every time. Even when she's crying!",999302400,,316,4.660714285714286
7883852,5,6305120242,"This video is an enormous relief to me when i need 30 mins.t o cook dinner or pay bills, etc. My son has been watching it since he was 4 months old and he's 11 months now and still loves it. I let him watch it once a day and he stares at the TV mesmirized by the babies. He just started crawling and tries to crawl up to the screen and get closer to the kids. He also laughs at certain parts and likes to ""talk"" to them. I love the range of emotions and activities it shows and no child will care about the choppy home movie editing. I recommend this for every mommy.",993427200,10,567,3.896551724137931
