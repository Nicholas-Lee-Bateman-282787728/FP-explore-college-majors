8341967,3,B001TKPGK4,"The work says 90% of milk production in the US goes to cheese.  It explains the etymology of the French word ""fromage.""  It speaks of how cheese was invented milennia (sp?) ago.  It talks about the businessman Kraft.  It speaks about limburger, mosarello, and velveeta.  Like most MM episodes, the focus is upon how machines make the product.
Often when it comes to MM episodes on food, I write about whether it makes me want to eat said food.  I can't say whether this moved me because I like to put cheese on dishes all the time.  The work gave a statistic that suggests Americans eat ten times more cheese than we did in the 1970s.  However, it never attaches that fact to the US obesity epidemic, and maybe it should have.  The work concludes with discussing how companies are trying to make cheese more healthy.  It's easy for me to forget how fatty cheese is.  However, I have NOTHING good to say about ol', nasty fat-free cheese.
The work has a slight emphasis on Wisconsin, but football fans from that state who wear cheesehead hats would want more.  I took a lot of gender studies courses in college and am fascinated by the topic.  I was not expecting gender to mentioned in a talk on cheese.  However, the work said some of the harder cheeses were made by monks and were a sign of their rugged, masculine living.
This reminded me of the MM episode on leather.  On the one hand, both have been made by humans for thousands of years.  However, the process sounds complicated and I wonder how our ancestors who knew nothing of advanced biology and chemistry could put two and two together.  They mention penicillin, but say the cheese-related sort is not the same as the disease-fighting kind.  There's a lot of talk of bacteria and mold.  That may not make some squeamish folk happy.
When it comes to lemon mirengue (sp?) pie, it's quite clear to me which part is lemon and which is the other.  The program says cheese is made from curd which is quite different from whey.  However, I was still unclear as to what is what and how they may look different.  Btw, it never suggests that mice like that food.",1370131200,2,2113,4.490813648293964
