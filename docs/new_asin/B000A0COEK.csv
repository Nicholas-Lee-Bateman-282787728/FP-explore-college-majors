8098054,5,B000A0COEK,"The first in a series of explorations of exotic human behaviour.  The settings and evolution of the story portrayed in Levottomat are intriguing.  The attraction of the main male character to mainly sexual relationships is counter-balanced by a job with extreme tensions, workmates with a fairly basic approach to relationships and against his own character of privacy and some sensitivity.  On an opportunistic basis he finds himself in a pleasant social situation with attractive friends which he then exploits, not without encouragement, but with destructive consequences for the group.  Makes one reflect on what might have been and what would one do in similar circumstances.",1316649600,,680,5.447619047619048
8098055,4,B000A0COEK,"Pretty close to real life situations. But stays very close to old types of thinking about life, sex and connections. Plenty of female nudity and director doesn't try anything risky. Main character, man, is trying to figure out life in general and why he attracted to females but somehow its too much for him. Well, I am in the same boat.",1230336000,,337,4.540983606557377
