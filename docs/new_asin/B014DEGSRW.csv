7386283,1,B014DEGSRW,"I rented this movie to support the indie filmmakers behind it. With that being said, it was a beautifully shot film, but it was too clean for this type of story. It didn't have enough grit or dirt for the story they were trying to tell.

The acting and direction are okay, not great. I'm giving it 1 star because the most important part of the film, the story, was just not good or entertaining. It was a snooze fest.",1449360000,,417,4.2125
7386284,2,B014DEGSRW,"*I received a review copy of this film in exchange for an honest review

If a movie is touted as Game of Thrones meets Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters, its obviously going to be a must-see for me.  Im one of the few people in my social group who liked HANSEL AND GRETEL: WITCH HUNTERS, and Im a rabid fan of GAME OF THRONESso this kind of lure is almost too much for me to deny.  This description was initially what drew me to FOUR WARRIORS, a recent release from Lionsgate.  Unfortunately, I wish I would have listened to my instincts on this one; despite its claim, this film is nothing like either title.  I want the 90 minutes of my life I spent on this film back.

From a production standpoint, the film looks ok.  It is shot decently and the camerawork is clean.  Likewise, the sets are fairly believable (much of it is shot in the woods, so not much you can do with that), and the locales look nice.  Even the acting is acceptable.  But that is where the positives end.

FOUR WARRIORS is a low-budget venture that has the look and feel of a LARP (Live Action Role Play) production.  I say this because the details of the whole film are all lacking.  The characters look nothing like Crusaders (these guys are all clean cut and fit), and they are about as mismatched a group as you can imagine.  I couldn't decide if they were supposed to be comical or serious.  In the end, they quickly started to annoy me.  The weapons look fake and even the armor seems too clean and shiny to be real for the time period.

The battle scenes try to be intense, but they have no flair.  I never once felt like anybody was in real danger, as the swings and strokes of the weaponry are so far off the mark its just plain sad.  I have seen more action in high school plays.

The demons in FOUR WARRIORS are too humanlike, which makes them eye-rolling-ly laughable.  I attribute this to the low budget film factor.  Granted, this is not a huge negative, but when combined with everything else wrong in the film, its yet another reason to shrug this one off.

FOUR WARRIORS misses the mark for me, and therefore I cannot recommend it with a good conscious.  Director Phil Hawkins shows some promise, but a few major issues (as mentioned above) will have to be addressed for future projects.  This film is available now, however, if you decide to give it a look.",1447718400,5,2346,4.350230414746544

7386286,3,B014DEGSRW,"Basic sword and sorcery story,plodding and with a questionable music score. I enjoy this genre and usually try and go lightly on low budget films. The acting and actual story line was acceptable no surprises. For the price wait for netflix or prime.",1447200000,,249,4.813953488372093

8730298,3,B014DEGSRW,"kinda cool, kinda cliche', kinda corny. Magic, but not magic? People who steal kids, go poof and disappear. Modern ideas, not medieval ones. And finally, a white horse that needed a unicorn horn.",1519171200,,195,4.9393939393939394
8730299,2,B014DEGSRW,"I strongly recommend a skip, unless your twelve or younger.
Nothing really bad, just bread and water story with a small budget.
Weak fighting, weak acting, lame costumes and little to no special affects.
If you want to see how ""Hodo's"" career is doing after he left Game of Thrones, he's got a cameo appearance in this.",1500163200,,319,4.614035087719298
8730300,3,B014DEGSRW,"I will not blow smoke up your you know what here but I found the movie to be entertaining enough that it held my attention. it isn't the greatest movie ever but it s not by any means the worst and I have seen some of them. This was a bit of the 13th Warrior in it and a few other movies were copied to make this too. I am sure you will see the similarities. We have all seen the rip off types of movies by the lower budget studios and some aren't bad. This one wasn't bad and the acting is okay too. The story well, it is many of them. Don't expect too much and just go blank and you may not think it is too terrible. for a rainy afternoon it will work. Would I recommend you buy it like I did? No find a place to get it for free.",1473897600,2,730,3.7161290322580647
