Non-remastered print. Colors in film picture may be lacking vibrancy, but its original Cinemascope presentation looks considerably good with very few exceptions (scratches, dirt eg. TC 00:17:15 - 50).
English audio missing at: TC 00:29:00 - 32:30; 00:58:40 - 59:20; 01:27:52 - 28:36. These passages might have been cut from US-release?

Bonus features contain filmposters (courtesy of Martin Hentschel) from around the globe (2 of which are mistakingly from ""Living It Up"", 1954?)
Cast includes: Anita Ekberg, Connie Stevens, Robert Morley, Dick Shawn, Dennis Weaver.
If you can do with minor flaws (cuts, image, soundtrack) this DVD is nice to have for every Jerry Lewis aficionado!
