I have read numerous books, interviewed many physicians and PhD experts, attended various seminars and viewed quite a few of the movies.  This is by far the single best coverage of the facts that I have seen.  Anyone who does not like this movie is either a fool, a vaccine manufacturer, an ostrich who does not care about facts, or a very closed minded individual.  If you are one of the (below 1%)  of the public who, (even if it means you will be ridiculed by your friends) always wishes to know the truth many years or decades before it is accepted as fact by the mainstream, WATCH this movie.  In my private practice, I continually get phone calls by long time patients (and my students)  telling me of some media release or newspaper article which just announced some ""new"" fact that I had taught then a decade ago in my office or one of my health courses.  If you are In Search of Unknown Facts, watch this excellent movie.  There is also lots of information in the video section of my web site where nothing is for sale.",1468972800,6,1105,4.430693069306931
8745301,1,B019HTHLU6,This was nothing more than a pointless narrative of ignorance and conspiracy theory drivel. Save your money if you are educated. If you already believe in reptilian overlords with a hidden agenda to reduce and enslave the world's population then also save your money and just buy a roll of aluminium foil to add another layer to your hat.,1468540800,2,338,4.745762711864407
8745302,1,B019HTHLU6,"I hate it because it only further demonizes and stigmatizes actual autistics like myself who are NOT damaged and even have autistic parents. The antivaccine movement is threatening to bring back measles, mumps, chicken pox, and rubella, NONE of which are minor illnesses. With catchphrases that they use: ""autistics are damaged/injured/chimpanzees/dogs/zombies/vegetables,"" is it any wonder why suicide rates in autistics are higher than a lot of other people groups or why autistics are severely underemployed with no services in adulthood? Tenpenney is one of the worst perpetrators of all!",1468540800,,592,5.662921348314606
8745303,1,B019HTHLU6,You just knew after reading the list of money grubbing anti vax 'actors' that this was going to be bollocks and you weren't disappointed.  The time wasted with this rubbish cannot be recovered. Don't bother.,1468540800,2,207,4.914285714285715
