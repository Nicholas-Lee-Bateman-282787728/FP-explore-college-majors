7973181,1,B00006SFKS,"I am watching this movie right now and am bored out of my f-ing mind. I love christmas themed horror movies and thought the cover looked cool so I put it in my ""que"" on blockbuster online. On the one hand I am happy that I didn't have to shell out the 5 dollars for it at the store but on the other hand I could have been watching something way better right now. I gave this movie 1 star because I couldn't give it any less-Amazon.com doesnt accomodate for that. Granted there are some cool scenes in the movie but they are few and far between. My advice-Step away from this movie, turn and run fast as hell in the other direction.",1164585600,,631,4.138211382113822
7973182,5,B00006SFKS,Guys I only like this movie because it was the movie of the month at this website by some fresh ass Juggalettes. [...]  Check out their website if your into Insane Clown Posse.  If your not into hatchet history then leave. I'm a Juggalo and I stand beside those hot ninjettes.  Buy this movie as well a some ICP stuff.,1080604800,,318,4.266666666666667
7973183,1,B00006SFKS,"This was awful.  Don't be seduced by the awesome DVD cover.  There is very little gore, and the demons only appear briefly.  The story mainly circles around an ex-con, his stupid friend, and the ex-con wanting to see his kid.  But heres the big clincher.....his stupid friend is sleeping with the ex-cons wife.  Big deal right?  Ya!  I paid 5 dollars for this DVD.....I want my money back.",1072742400,,389,4.632352941176471
