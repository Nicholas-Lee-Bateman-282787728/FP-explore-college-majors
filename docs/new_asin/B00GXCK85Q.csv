us want to share. So we did.",1406505600,,164,3.6857142857142855
6123567,5,B00GXCK85Q,"Im proud to say that I first discovered the amazing Jake Shimabukuro more than 12 years ago when he captivated a hotel meeting room of Arts Presenters in New York. Jake was in his early 20s and, even then was a virtuoso of the uke. He hadnt even ventured up to Central Park yet to be captured playing George Harrisons My Guitar Gently Weeps which then hit You Tube and, as of today (I just checked) has 11,152,708 views! Jake has continued to mature and grow as both a person and a musician and there is no one like him. He mentors young player and is amazing in a room of children or music students. Ive seen him in both instances. Ive also had the privilege of seeing him play nearly every time he comes near Philadelphia. (If you haven't seen him play live, you are missing a great experience.)

In the fall of 2012 Jake recorded an album, produced by the great Alan Parsons, titled Grand Ukulele with new songs and a string section. He then took off on a world-wide tour, without the string players but with a huge lighting crew and, for the first time in his career, a tour bus! I was lucky enough to see the tour outside Philadelphia in early 2013 and it was great. Honestly, Im not sure the fancy lights were necessary but I guess thats the price of fame. Its Jakes amazing fingers that make the show; the rest is just window-dressing.

At some point during the tour it stopped in Boulder Colorado and Jake, and his manager, Chris Ferarri, decided that the show should be captured on video for Jakes huge fan base that wouldnt get to see him play live. The result is this wonderful 75 minute DVD.

The production quality is top-notch in both video and audio. No, its not \Bluray but the HD wide-screen images were sharp enough for the close-ups of Jakes hands (especially during the lightning-fast moves near the end of the concert. And, thankfully (at least for me), the cameras close in so that the flashing lights don't detract from the performance.

There are 11 songs performed with many from Jakes earlier albums (Dragon takes on a whole new life as Jake uses a looping machine to turn it into a rock number.

Im sure the actual concert was edited because there are no intros from Jake for any of the songs except Blue Roses Falling and the aforementioned George Harrison song (which he plays at every performance). I missed those intros (but I guess it works best on repeat viewings to omit them.). Halfway through the DVD there is a 10 minute interview with Jake which also includes scenes of gim in the studio and on the road. This 10 minute segment is accompanied by some of Jakes other recordings playing in the background. These are listed in the closing credits but not specifically noted that they were in the interview segment.

If you are a Jake fan (as I certainly am) youll definitely want this DVD for your collection. If this is your first experience seeing Jake play, work your way back in his 12 year-plus catalog and youll discover that he just doesnt focus on one genre of music. Each album is different. I wonder where hell take his focus on the next album. I guess well just have to wait.

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.

6123568,5,B00GXCK85Q,"Jake Shimabukuro is a great talent. He is best when he is live. This is a DVD of his last tour featuring songs from the Grand Ukulele CD. It is worth having just to see this version of an older song ""Dragon"". Too bad they didn't include a live version of ""Music Box"". Includes a short interview.",1388880000,5,295,4.192982456140351

The crowd in this video was really responsive and I really like the variety of camera angles.  Watch this DVD with a chin strap, your JAW WILL DROP.

8628347,3,B00GXCK85Q,"Jake Shimabukuro is an incredible ukulele player.  Fortunately, his performances in themselves are clear and can be heard well;  but the overall product should have been edited carefully.  I could not hear him talking without turning up the sound very high;  in fact, I stopped listening to him talk.  It is also annoying that there is never an introduction to his ukulele numbers.
The 3 stars are for the production of the dvd.  I give Jake 5 stars!",1432857600,2,450,4.705128205128205
