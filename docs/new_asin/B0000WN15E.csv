1957926,3,B0000WN15E,"Like most others, I stumbled on this show completely by accident.  Flipping through the channels late at night, when low and behold, a friggin' Dilbert cartoon pops up!  How interesting!  As a fan of the comics (I can get them sent to my cell phone - how sad is that??) I enjoyed the few episodes I watched.
I bought the DVD set mainly to see what I missed.  The answer: not a whole lot.  The series does have a lot of hilarious moments, but as a whole, doesn't reach as high as I wanted.  Seeing Dilbert, Dogber, Wally, Alice, the Pointy-Haired Boss and everyone else from the comics alive and moving was great, but most of the jokes and gags feel... recycled.  I couldn't count the number of moments that seemed to be ripped right a specific strip or two in each episode.  Which isn't to say that it's exactly a bad thing, just... old.
The set's features are great, with some behind-the-scenes stuff, and compilations of some cool moments in the show.  Fans will get a kick out of seeing all of their favorite characters actually doing stuff instead of being stuck in a 2D drawing, but be prepared for some minor cases of deja-vu.",1075507200,23,1132,4.456310679611651
1957927,5,B0000WN15E,Scott Adams' Dilbert comes to life in this wacky animated series about a man & his dog...Dogbert. Dilbert is an engineer at a manufacturing plant who's sometimes too smart for his own good and requires Dogbert to bail him out. You'll howl with laughter over the antics. HILARIOUS!,1075334400,5,280,4.854166666666667
1957928,4,B0000WN15E,"I've been a fan of Dilbert ever since learning to read. The comic strip was always the first one I turned to once I got the morning paper.
I accidently came up on this TV show.  I was amazed that it was made into a animated show and I was also amazed how I could've missed something like this.
All I can say is, this show is a must watch for anyone who's EVER had a job or worked a day in their life.  The comedy, rather its social or satirical, is great.  The show may not be up to par with The Family Guy but it sets up there with the best.
If you enjoy: The Family Guy, The Critic, and Futurarama then you'll enjoy this.",1075075200,9,623,3.8897637795275593
1957929,5,B0000WN15E,"With humor and wit on par with The Simpsons, Dilbert the Series captures the bite of the workplace comic strip perfectly.  It also manages to poke fun at almost everything else outside of the office; from bad neighbors and clueless goverment officals, to ridiculous conspiracies and junk science nothing is out of bounds.  Originally run on (and cancelled by) UPN in 1999, Dilbert found a home on Comedy Central last year.  Sadly, the episodes were cut for CC's commercial breaks and some of the gags were lost.  But not forever, thanks to DVD.  A must own for fans of The Simpsons, Newsradio, or The Office.  Or, if you like cartoons for grown-ups (like me), then Dilbert deserves a place in your DVD collection.",1074297600,12,713,4.7560975609756095
1957930,5,B0000WN15E,"DILBERT - the most popular comic strip of the decade - is now on DVD. With his signature turned-up tie, round glasses and buzz cut, Dilbert is already a pop culture phenomenon, providing an irreverent reference point for workers everywhere. Developed and produced by Emmy Award-winning writer/producer Larry Charles (""Seinfeld,"" ""Mad About You""), DILBERT, the series, follows the ""every man"" as he copes with daily life at The Company. Daniel Stern (""The Wonder Years,"" Home Alone, City Slickers) stars as the voice of Dilbert, while Chris Elliot voices his roommate Dogbert, who views the entire world as existing for his personal entertainment. Joining Dilbert in the office are his fellow engineers: the no-nonsense, caffeinated Alice (Kathy Griffin) and selfish, slothful Wally. Guest voice talent includes Jason Alexander, Andy Dick, Eugene Levy, Jay Leno, Jerry Seinfeld, Stone Cold Steve Austin, Tom Green and more!",1070928000,16,922,5.454545454545454

1957943,4,B0000WN15E,"I was one of the artists that had the privilege of working on the Dilbert series. And yes, I think the show was too abruptly canceled, and though the writing was not perfect the show dealt with some pretty interesting and sophisticated topics rarely seen in TV shows, certainly rare on animated shows.  I also had the chance to sit in on some of the script readings, and I can say everyone truly enjoyed the process.  I think the DVD box set is a well deserved tribute to an under-rated show.",1417737600,2,492,4.395604395604396

Well, maybe the clueless pointy hair boss, everyone's had one of those. The extra features are a few interviews with the cast and writers, they're just o.k. But the ongoing saga of the flagship product the ""Gruntmaster 6000"" from name, to idea, to prototype, is worth following and laughing too. The DVD version has better picture quality than the streaming versions, in my opinion. The best episode has to be ""the Knack"", but everyones funny bone is different. Its not for everyone, but I have gotten ""non techies"" hooked on it.",1388620800,2,658,4.780701754385965

1957949,4,B0000WN15E,"I will preface this by saying that Dilbert is one of my favorite series ever. I have seen every episode multiple times, some maybe even dozens. It's just so consistently inoffensive to watch, even when the jokes are actually more offensive than you might expect. I'm never not in the mood to watch Dilbert.

Having said that, the viewer should remember that some of the humor is also remarkably lame or obvious jokes, and aggressive puns. While there is plenty of original and genuinely funny stuff here, if you can't take a few total eyerollers and cheesy pop culture references, you should go be a snoot somewhere else. Dilbert is fun and silly and that's what makes it work.

This series is good comedy that (usually) doesn't take itself too seriously, for people who (usually) don't take themselves too seriously.",1385942400,,817,4.828571428571428

1957954,5,B0000WN15E,The Dilbert cartoons tell the story of what is wrong with the average office in this day and age.  They poke fun at all of the buzz words of the day.  The topics are very timely.  They probably are PG-13 as well.,1367193600,,212,4.0

1957958,5,B0000WN15E,"When a cartoon from two decades ago is more cogent than anything on TV today it says a lot about the intellectual and creative capacity of its author. The series is much too short. I only wish it had run for a hundred more episodes. But, nonetheless, it's worth the investment and grows finer, like wine, with age.",1363219200,,314,4.431034482758621

1957960,4,B0000WN15E,"...I liked this show. Admittedly, the second season was a little out there for my tastes. But there are moments throughout this show which are just as funny as anything you'll see on 'The Simpsons' or 'Family Guy.' Like the comic strip, it speaks to anyone who has ever sat at a desk or worked in a cubicle but with slightly more (well) animation than there ever was in the comic. But my favorite part of this show is the casting. Daniel Stern as Dilbert, Larry Miller as the Boss and especially Chris Elliott as Dogbert. When I read the comic strip now, I hear Chris Elliott's voice in my head when I read Dogbert's lines.",1359331200,2,623,4.379310344827586
1957961,5,B0000WN15E,"This is a great witty cartoon to have if your into cartoons with adult comedy.

1957963,5,B0000WN15E,"No matter where you work the stories in this series will resonate with you. I usually have a limit to how much of a certain type of comedy I can stand in a day before the jokes stop working, That was not so with this series.

1957964,4,B0000WN15E,"A good animated encapsulation of the comic strip.  If you enjoy the strip, and find endearing its self-flagellating humor and sardonic commentary about the engineering industry (yes, most engineers agree:  in the case of the Dilbert comics strip, art *DOES* imitate life...), you'll probably enjoy the DVD series; if you just don't get the Dilbert comic strip, you probably shouldn't get the DVD's...",1350086400,,400,5.333333333333333
1957965,4,B0000WN15E,"This has two seasons of Dilbert cartoons, which is two seasons more than I previously knew existed.  I read Dilbert comics fairly regularly and while the characters look the same, they just don't seem to have the same personality I would imagine them having.  I didn't really expect them to be the same as the comics, but something was missing.  Maybe the irony wasn't quite as strong.

Which isn't to say they weren't good. My daughter loved the cartoons, but when I handed her some of my Dilbert comics, she didn't enjoy them as much.  So the humor is obviously different.",1326240000,,574,4.643564356435643

1957972,5,B0000WN15E,"Dilbert is absolutely fantastic and its obscurity is criminal. It's full of hilarious quotes and storylines. It's so dense with jokes, you always find something you missed when you rewatch the series. And you'll do plenty of rewatching if you're anything like me. For anyone unfamiliar with the series, do yourself a favor and watch ""The Knack"" on Hulu. Depending on when you read this review, that particular episode may or may not be available at the moment, but I would argue that it's the best to watch if you get a chance.

If you've done that, you've most likely clicked the 'add to cart' button by now.

There are two full seasons in the collection, with few special features. Honestly, it doesn't matter. Maybe it would be a tough sell if this show were still on the air and this collection were full price, but as it is, you can't pass it up.",1273795200,,851,4.51948051948052
1957973,5,B0000WN15E,"I really never read Dilbert faithfully but I read it when I read the paper every weekend and I always got a chuckle or two. The animated series is nothing short of both tragic and downright hilarious. As stated in the review, this series reminds me of the first few seasons of Family Guy before the show just got too over the top. The only real difference is this show has a dry based humor. I have to say, if given the right circumstances, this show could have easily done well beyond expectations on a real network like Fox. Sadly, I find it sad that this show was basically too good for the audience watching it and received low viewer ratings. I found myself wanting more after I hit the 30th episode but it just seemed to end abruptly. Bottom line, if you watch almost any of the shows on Fox during their Sunday night lineup, there is absolutely no reason to skip this number. I was never a real Dilbert fan but after watching this show, I have to say, its changed my tune quite a bit",1267660800,,990,4.2712765957446805
1957974,5,B0000WN15E,"It's one of the mysteries of tv when a series as promising and brilliantly funny as this one barely gets 30 episodes before getting cancelled.  I suppose this only makes us appreciate the ones that got made even more like the priceless gems that they are.  Every episode here is quality and some of them still give me stitches after repeated viewing.  This set comes very nicely packaged in a digipak cardboard that opens up to reveal the 4 discs that fold up to slide into a nice outer sleeve.  The picture and sound quality are both very good as well although a Dolby 5.1 surround sound option would have been nice. The bonus features include a ""Making Dilbert Work"" documentary plus interviews with creator, Scott Adams which is a nice touch.  Having been in the corporate world for many years and subject to similar idiot bosses and situations makes me truly relate to and love this entire series.  I note that another reviewer found this dvd not funny and I suppose unless you've been in the corporate world many of the situations presented here would need some explaining.  I for one totally enjoyed this set and it will always be good for a laugh every now and then when I need one.

Very highly recommended!",1266451200,,1215,4.592592592592593

1957976,4,B0000WN15E,"Dilbert lasted less than one season.  Based upon the popular comic strip it attempted to bring the humor and irony of it to life.  Many times it hit the mark, but, there were far too many misses for it to last.  This set presents all the episodes filmed and compiled on 4 discs.  The picture is clean and the sound well-engineered.  The menus are easy to use.  What really stands out on these discs is the strength of the voiceactors (real word - I am one) and their devotion to making their characters really come to life.  Dilbert fans will really enjoy this set.  Others may see it as nothing but an odd cartoon.  It's both, really, and that's what makes it ultimately work.",1253923200,,677,4.395161290322581
1957977,5,B0000WN15E,"I've always been a big fan of the Dilbert comic strips and remembered that there was a series on UPN way back in the day; so when I found it on amazon I was pretty excited.  After I received this product, I finished watching all of the episodes in about two weeks, and thought that they were all quite hilarious and also applicable to life.  Scott Adams' knowledge of the business and marketing worlds combines with his broad sense of humor to make a very funny TV series.  Adams even manages to poke fun at himself and his BS in Economics, which I find to be a good indicator of good comedy.  The only negative thing that can be said about this series (and probably the reason it was canceled) is that Adams' very strong views on politics and religion also come up in more than a few episodes.  In a predominantly religious society the very strong atheistic/mystic views portrayed in this series can leave some individuals felling offended.

Overall I think the Dilbert series was absolute comic genius that was cut short before its time.  And these DVDs embrace everything that was funny about the original series with both the episodes and the extras put together by Scott Adams.",1251763200,,1182,4.6

Each episode tried to stretch the typically hilarious one liners of the comic strip into a 30min. comedy and it was a horrible disaster. I just kept waiting for jokes that never came and I finally gave up after 6 episodes. There was a reason the series was canceled after only one season.

Although they may look aesthetically similar, a 4-second comic strip and a half-hour TV show are two different mediums. The show tries to capture some of the strip's brilliant cynicism and workday commentary, which it mediocrely succeeds at. The personalities of the various characters are expanded upon, with stories happening that just wouldn't be possible in a daily comic strip. However, Dilbert is not the kind of show that can be enjoyed over and over again in a short period of time, such as Seinfeld or Spongebob Squarepants. It is the kind of show that you watch through once, forget about it for seven months, and then watch through again. Only reccomendable to Dilbert fans.

In many ways the Dilbert television series is far edgier - even over the top - than Dilbert itself. While the strip seems to cling very closely to offering quickie barbs at management, the series builds these theme to operatic heights, and offers insights into the characters the strip has only hinted at. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't, but nevertheless it still stands alone as one of the most interesting and ambitious cartoon television series ever made.",1094428800,,607,4.902912621359223

-Cute toys (the machine that makes them was a nice touch)

-The Black Hole episode

It all turns out to be a bizzare fun experience. It took me an episode or two to get into the bizzarity, but after a while I started really enjoying it.

Seen in a bunch like this, you soon become overwhelmed by Adams' unrelentingly negative and cynical view of life. After about three episodes, you find yourself wanting to throw things at all the cruel and mercenary side characters. (On one of the interviews, Adams says he gave Dogbert all the non-dog characteristics he could think of -- disloyalty, pessimism, selfishness, disaffection, etc. That explains a lot.)
Animation, acting, and writing are all excellent, and if you liked the show you'll probably HAVE to have this DVD. I just wish it weren't so annoying.",1078531200,18,708,4.957983193277311

1958002,5,B0000WN15E,"He is Dilbert. If you don't love him, at least you know him. He's the bespectacled potato-shaped Everyman, the alter ego of office workers frustrated by annoying coworkers and idiot bosses. The deliciously surreal tone of Scott Adams' comic strip is preserved (even amplified in places) in the TV adaptation.
In the strange adventures of Dilbert (Daniel Stern) and friends... er, coworkers, they travel to the muddy, backward country of Elbonia, search for Dilbert's long-lost dad in the mall, create anthrax throat drops (""My throat is moist... and the raspiness is gone... GACK!""), try to name a product that doesn't exist, deal with a black hole, and battle tiny people who are stealing the office supplies. Their souls are sucked out by their company, and a cat rules over Human Resources. And through it all, the megalomaniac Dogbert (Chris Elliot) somehow manages to arrange things so that the disasters aren't too outstanding.
Several supporting characters have enlarged roles. There's the violent, big-haired Alice (Kathy Griffin); lazy Wally; naive, dumb Asok, the idiot pointy-haired boss (Larry Miller), and Loud Howard (who can shatter glass with his booming voice). Other favorites like Catbert (played by ""Seinfeld's"" Jason Alexander) crop up from time to time, as well as other cameos by Jerry Seinfeld, Jeri Ryan, and others.
The animation is amusing and quite faithful to Adams' original animation (although Dilbert has a mouth here). And the humor is deliciously, delightfully twisted -- without losing the corporate edge, the scriptwriters kept in the sort of bizarre occurrances that make this so funny. Several scenarios are, however, included from the strip -- and sometimes even expanded (such as the Dadbert-in-the-mall episode).
Everyone's favorite bespectacled, pointy-tied, potato-shaped engineer is still funny on the small screen. ""Dilbert: The Complete Series"" is a must-have for cubicle serfs and technogeeks.",1077408000,48,1940,5.4485049833887045
1958003,5,B0000WN15E,"Dilbert never got a fair chance on TV, being cancelled on a third rate network whose idea of great comedy usually involves bodily functions or broad you-go-girl bland tripe. For my part, I thought that this show happened to be one of the funniest sitcoms ever, and it stands along with the Simpsons as being one of the wryest and most perceptive satirical works on American Television.
The voice acting is excellent. The characters all sound just as they would be expected to when reading the comic strip. Daniel Stern as Dilbert, Larry Miller as the clueless boss (who had to have been based off of one of Scott Adams' bosses), Larry Charles as slacker engineer Wally, Kathy Griffin as Alice, the triangular-haired female engineer, and Chris Elliot as Dilbert's sidekick Dogbert, not to mention a parade of guest stars, including Tom Green, Andy Dick, Jerry Seinfeld, and Jason Alexander. Put simply, this show had talent to burn.
After occasional reruns on Comedy Central, I am jubliant to see this comedy jewel now available on DVD. The quirkiness and humor of the comic strip is definitely present here, as well as the savage skewering of workplace politics and procedures. The show's highlights include the first episode, the anthrax cough drops bit was inspired, a Y2K-themed episode (remember all that fuss about the end of the world?), frequent visits from evil Mr. Catbert (voiced by Jason Alexander), as well as a guest appearance by Jerry Seinfeld as an insane computer in charge of a computer-by-mail company, a la Dell. My favorite episode has got to be the merger episode, which has Dilbert's company merging with aliens from outer space (the funniest bit had to do with a mexican restaurant/corporate pickup bar).
I think very highly of this show and think that you should give it a shot. You owe it to yourself.",1077148800,75,1827,4.877813504823151
1958004,5,B0000WN15E,I have been a fan of Dilbert for awhile now. The TV series brings Dilbert to life. Dilbert can now do the things a three icture comic strip won't allow him to do. I like the Y2K episode a lot. Most of the voices fit but I don't think Dogbert's voice fits. Wally is my favorite character becasue he's so lazy. I think theres a bit of Wally in each of us. Asok is also funny but he's so young and dumb. I can see how this series was cancelled but it was a good show but appently it didn't get enough viewers. UPN made a mistake but it stands a chance at coming back. Family Guy may be coming back so there's hope for Dilbert.

1958005,5,B0000WN15E,"The Dilbert TV series is truly a riot.  It has both the fun of office space, along with the incredibly looney deaths that only a cartoon can provide (black holes created by Dilbert's invention that's field tested by rednecks and ends up sucking up everything, poor ventilation polution that turns workers into slimes, fish people, etc, and other poorly designed contraptions that generally cause death and mass destruction). Like office space, this series pokes fun at all aspects of office life, including outsourcing, marketing folks, motivation schemes, board of directors, etc.  The character voices seem dead on for what you would expect in the Dilbert comics.  If anything, Dogbert is even better than he is in the comic version.
I don't understand why this show didn't make it on TV (maybe being stuck on UPN?).  The sense of humour is terrifically twisted. This series is well worth getting if you missed a number of the episodes when it was on TV.",1076889600,,956,4.919254658385094

He is referred to as the ""Loud Guy"". I know in my office there is a ""loud Howard"", as Im sure there is one in every office. I can't wait to see the rest of the episodes. I see in the opening sequence we have Catbert, Dogbert,Ratbert, Wally, Alice, Pointy Haired Boss, Dilbert's Mom, and Asok the Intern.

1958007,5,B0000WN15E,"What made Dilbert so funny is that all the situations in it reminds people of things that go on in their normal lives.  How many people groan at the decisions of the Pointy-Haired Boss, knowing that your own boss has done something just as boneheaded?
That is the beauty of Dilbert as a whole.  Every working stiff in the world can relate to him.  Sometimes it's your ""cow-orkers"" that always seem to be lacking in intelligence, or sometimes it's your Pointy-Haired Boss that comes up with some kind of half-baked idea.  Sometimes, it's even both!
The cast was incredible with such stars as Chris Elliot, Larry David (the creator of Seinfeld), Kathy Griffin (late of the Brooke Shields' show, Suddenly Susan, and whose character, Alice allows Griffin to steal the show), and the overlooked Jason Alexander (Seinfeld's George) as evil Director of Human Resources, Catbert.
