8586620,5,B0026P4DJQ,"""King in Chicago"" is a compelling contemporary film about Martin Luther King's time in Chicago, a lesser known and rarely discussed period in his life.  It is spirited, balanced, and ultimately moving.  It is a great discussion piece to view during Black History Month or at any time. The documentary has  very positive energy at the same time as it wrestles frankly with what had to have been one of the most difficult, frustrating experiences in Dr. King's life.  Highly recommended.",1242950400,3,485,4.950617283950617
