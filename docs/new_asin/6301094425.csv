310093,1,6301094425,"The movie was worse than I expected... Bad video, bad acting, bad special effects were all at a level I was expecting, but it is difficulty to beleive that they required 3 screenplay writers to screw-up an ok sci-fi book (at least for a book written early 60s). If you haven't read the Perry Rhodan series please don't waste your money. But if you read a few of them (maybe thousands) you know you will have to check it out one day. Do it now while you still have a vcr because I don't think this movie will make it to DVD.",991353600,2,523,4.137254901960785
310094,1,6301094425,"A quirky european film from the psychodelic era that is even worse than Barbarella. The juxtaposition of theme, mood, bad music, and, low- budget production values make it laughable. The only good thing about this film is ESSY PERSSON in those outragous costumes! This movie is so bad that it elevates the work of Dino De Laurentiis to the level of mediocraty. Remember what he did with ""Flash Gordon""? Could have been better if Radley Metzger directed this film.",941068800,,463,4.8734177215189876
310095,3,6301094425,"Unusual film. Hard to think it was made at the same time as 2001: A Space Odessy. Still, it is, at moments, entertaining. Essy Persson's nose looks larger than usual, but she remains cold and fetching. The special effects  are (of course) usually laughible. The picture was taken from the popular  comic ""Perry Rhodan"" of the day, not unlike Bava's  ""Diabolik"" (taken from the French comic of the same name) made  the previous year. ""Mission Stardust"" retains the same comic  book-logic and ludicrous plot-lines which are the foundation of any great  comic. To say the picture drags in places is an understatement, but, if you  are in the mood, it is definitely worth a watch. Dig the colorful credits  and title song ""Seli"".",940291200,5,725,4.837398373983739
7809502,2,6301094425,"As I watched this movie, my thoughts turned to Plan Nine from Outer Space and how superior it was to Mission Stardust.  As the movie progressed, I left it running while I went into the kitchen and separated the unpopped popcorn kernels from the popped ones at the bottom of the bowl so that I could pop them later.  During that time, I listened to the ridiculous caricatures and hokey ""space sounds"" and realized that ranking Plan Nine from Outer Space as a bad movie was uncalled for considering that Mission Stardust was several parsecs below it.  I guess it was because people expected better from Bela Lugosi when they panned it while Mission Stardust simply received a yawn.  I wonder how many people demanded their money back after paying to see this movie?",1517011200,,763,4.6716417910447765
7809503,2,6301094425,"This is so bad. Just a few points: referring to the rocket engine as a motor, hehe. Using the pronoun ""I"" incorrectly as an object of a verb, geezus. The 50's style wobbling spaceships was hysterical. The gas emissions on the supposed-to-be gigantic ship exposed the models as too fake to believe. Best (or worst) of all, the sound effects were irritating and ridiculous. This is what kept the public from asking for more sci-fi movies in the 60's. I kept this movie on as background noise while I was working, yet what I listed was too prominent  to ignore.",1515456000,,558,4.58
7809504,3,6301094425,"Giving three stars is a balance between loving Perry Rhodan and believing this movie doesn't do him justice. The movie itself is a ""B"" type low resolution production, with hoakie special effects, at best. If you're a classic SciFi BOOK buff, then perhaps you've heard of Perry Rhodan. It was a German paperback book series where, back in the 1960's, around 120 or so were translated into English. The series is still in production today, but only in German. It had all the techno gadgets and more from all the recent shows and movies, such as Star Trek, Star wars, Stargate and more. The series had computer games before the PC was even invented. Warp drive before Star Trek season one. So many alien scientific toys that I can't list them all, were gradually introduced as you read the series. This ""Mission Stardust"" was the first book in the series. I just wish the TV or Cable networks would make a high quality series from these books. It would be so much better than anything else they've ever produced.",1509926400,3,1009,4.64245810055866
7809505,3,6301094425,"Worth watching as a slice of mid-20th Century America.  Listen closely to the way the American 'crewmen' speak.  Mid-American speech has already changed in its pitch, pace, and emphasis enough in fifty years to make this film sound dated.  So has body language.  If there are Americans watching this film in some college media class a hundred years from now, they'll probably need the English subtitles.  For sure they'd find the special effects and 'advanced' instruments even more amusing than I do.  Stop whining about things like silly plot and cheesy effects and instead drink deep of this exhilarating silliness.",1506902400,,618,5.13
7809506,3,6301094425,"This review is for Amazon streaming. You can tell the movie would have some eye catching retro future designs. However, the amazon streaming version supposedly in HD is TERRIBLE QUALITY, This is the 5th awful streaming movie I have tried to watch and is in no way HD , barely above VSH quality. Shame on amazon",1503446400,,310,4.553571428571429
7809507,2,6301094425,"This was based on the long running 'Perry Rhodan' series, and is so bad the fans disavow it. Acting, script, and effects are wretched. Background noise is all it's good for.",1502496000,,173,4.612903225806452
7809508,4,6301094425,"Not bad for a multi foreign country mid sixties movie primarily dubbed in english.  I think a few of the actors may have been speaking english because the dubbing was in perfect sink. If you watch the vid closely you'll see the similarities to Star Trek in some scenes. Some funny moments, especially from Capt. Bull. Whoever wrote the screenplay did there homework because of the way the force fields and other alien technology was portrayed. I was impressed with the way the scene was written when the Major used the handheld antigravity generator on a bad guy and when the bad guy fired his pistol the reaction sent him going the opposite way. Just what you might expect from someone who was weightless.",1502409600,2,706,4.693548387096774
7809509,2,6301094425,"1960s Italian science fiction produced extremely bizarre and diverse movies, with Primo Zeglio's ""Mission Stardust"" being one of the cheesier and more ridiculous. The story may have made more sense before it was dubbed, but I doubt it. Astronauts leave on a mission to the moon, but upon arrival find themselves cut off from communicating with Earth. The astronauts drive what looks for all the world like an extraterrestrial weinermobile around the moon looking for the plot, when they stumble on a robot, who takes them back to an alien ship commanded by the beautiful Thora (Essy Persson) assisted by cadaverous but kind Crest (John Karlsen) who is ill. The aliens are so advanced they have no knowledge of disease, so the Earth doctor makes the diagnosis: leukemia.

Because the contact with alien life is such a big discovery they have to keep it utterly confidential, and fly with the aliens back to Earth without telling anybody. (What!?!) Now if you were flying back to Earth to get the very best health care for your new alien pal, where would you go? Mombasa? That's what I thought. Apparently the leukemia specialist Dr. Frank Haggard (Stefano Sibaldi) works out of a clinic in Kenya, so they land the spacecraft 400 miles away in the middle of the desert, requiring elaborate ground transportation plans.

Meanwhile the evil Arkin (Pinkas Braun) plans to hijack the spaceship in a confusing subplot involving mineral rights and metal mining. (It's better if you don't think too hard about this.) Before it's all over with there are traitors and double-crosses everywhere (""I'm not Dr. Haggard!"") numerous fistfights, wacky weapons, robot wars, inept military leaders, and improbable events galore. My fundamental question was this: how did Arkin know that of all the diseases an alien stranded on the moon could have, that Cress would have leukemia, and would know this far enough in advance to plant a nurse saboteur in the Mombasa leukemia clinic? Why also did the astronauts need to buy a car for what was (according to the movie) a two mile drive? (I really need to follow my own advice.)

Lang Jeffries stars as Maj. Perry Rhodan, the commanding astronaut, who confirms every 1960's stereotype ever invented about the astronaut corps, eventually even winning over hard-as-nails Thora in a most predictable, yet still amusing, conclusion that everyone knew would be totally inevitable.

""Mission Stardust"" does have a few interesting features, the alien spaceships foremost among them (I think they look like giant octopi on stilts,) and of course there's the undeniable beauty of Essy Persson which helps a not insubstantial amount. The cons outweigh the pros though as the story drags, the characters are strictly two-dimensional, large swaths of the film just don't make much sense, and most annoyingly, the soundtrack features never-ending electronic grunting as background music (remember the synthesizer was new then.) If you are a B-movie fan or a fan of Italian sci-fi, ""Mission Stardust"" contains adequate amusement value for a single viewing, but for most people there are simply better options for their viewing pleasure. As an aside, ""Mission Stardust"" is now also available on DVD, though the print doesn't look substantially better.",1309046400,3,3262,5.12593984962406
7809510,2,6301094425,"hi all, this isn't a review, just a helpful bit of advice;

if you want to see this movie for free it's online on youtube under torgs drivein account. Just type in mission stardust and it will come up.",1164412800,2,201,4.153846153846154
7809511,2,6301094425,"I remember being very young and being taken to a local theater to see a science fiction quadruple feature. I don't remember much about any of them except MISSION STARDUST. It did not stay in my memory because it is a great film. It stayed in my memory because the film broke early into it and I never got to see the whole thing. That has stuck in my mind. On a lark, I looked for it on Amazon and actually found it.

The only things I really remember from way back were that it involve a really hot blonde alien pilot (I guess I was just starting to notice such things) and that the music was funny. All else was lost to time. It probably wouldn't have mattered if it stayed lost.

The story involves an earth crew on a classified mission to the moon. When they get there, they find a ship from an advanced race stuck because of mechanical problems. The one guy who can fix things is too sick to do so. It turns out that the alien has leukemia and, by a fortunate turn of events, a doctor in Africa has just found a serum to cure leukemia. The astronauts join forces with the aliens to secure the serum. Unfortunately, a very rich bad guy has other plans and wants to capture the technology of the ship to make himself master of the world. He happens to have agents scattered all over the globe and even one on the earth ship. Eventually, good triumphs and the alien is saved.

The story is pretty poor and so are the effects. This looks like a cheaply made European movie because it is.

The hot blonde is present as the commander of the alien ship. She is pretty but not what dreams and memories are made of. The funny music is present too. I guess it was what passed for high tech futuristic back in the 60s.

This is not a good movie but there have been far worse.",1119052800,5,1768,4.173020527859237
