1627177,5,B00005MM9H,I absolutely thought this was a great movie. It was scary yet it had a real feel to it. I think Timothy Dalton is a great actor and he did a fantastic job with the role of the tormented Priest. His remembrances of his World War II experiences were particularly moving.  I liked this movie alot...was surprised at how moving I found it.  Worth a watch.,1099094400,9,351,4.303030303030303
1627178,2,B00005MM9H,"This movie is basically a wanna-be Exorcist.  And even Exorcist was boring in my opinion.  Being an atheist, these movies don't appeal to me as scary or even interesting.  Just like ghost movies or alien movies, possession movies require an interest in the subject to begin with.  Unless you are religious and actually fear the devil possessing you, don't expect to be scared.  This movie is just copy of a better film.  Watch the Exorcist.",1063065600,,440,4.8
1627179,3,B00005MM9H,"Possessed is based on the same book which inspired William Peter Blatty's The Exorcist and the classic Friedkin movie .It is not a classic ,unlike the Friedkin movie ,but it struck me as a notch or two above the usual TV movie treatment of supernatural themes.
Timothy Dalton plays the war veteran priest,a man who bears both physical and emotional scars from his world war 2 experiences in the Ardennes,and who is called upon to do battle with Satan for the soul of a possessed boy,Robbie. He does so in the face of official scepticism from the Archbishop -played with silky insouciance by the always reliable Christopher Plummer-a man more obsessed by the political (Conservative)role of the Church than by matters spiritual.
The exorcism scenes are a tad below the emotional intensity of similar scenes in The Exorcist but do carry a frisson or two and the movie is decently acted and directed. I was struck by the links made between the possession of the boy and the political climate of the time with the paranoia of McCarthyism being  explicitly invoked in one brief scene. The movie takes place against the rise of the Civil Rights movement and we glimpse the beginnings of television evangelism and the concern of the Church with Nielsen ratings and image. If the truth conflicts with image ,bury the truth-or so runs the official line as seen in the movie
It won't replace The Exorcist or The Omen in the pantheon of classic possession movies but its sturdy second string material and engages interest throughout.",1036368000,26,1522,4.8538461538461535
1627180,5,B00005MM9H,"I was very suprised as I've saw that movie because television productions are generally a bit sleazy but not this film! Sure, the story of this movie its not so detailed as in thomas allen's  book, but its very believable with the most scary and religious moments from the 1949 case. Actor dalton fits perfect in the role as father bowern and acting very, very well.
Just a good movie with good actors, suspense, thrill, religion and also some fine effects.
Not a huge stupid blockbuster, just a film, but great !
For people which likes the exorcist is this movie an other great exorcism movie in their collection.
Get it !!!!!",1026000000,11,627,4.598214285714286
1627181,1,B00005MM9H,"Having the opportunity to see The Exorcist on big screen last fall was a sweet high light of last year.  After recovering from the shock value of the film, I began to curiously obsess over the idea of diabolical possession.  I quickly hunted down the (at the time) hard-to-find book by Thomas B. Allen, ""Possessed,"" that was the foundation for Blatty's fictional account of an exorcism.  Allen's book was phenomenal, and faith-changing.  As a soon-to-be-Catholic, I've had my personal struggles with coming to God, and what more evidence for the existence of God is needed when evidence of the Devil could not be more apparent and available?  It follows the dichotomous logic that if the ultimate evil can reign as it did in little boy Robbie, then eventually so can the ultimate good.  Allen, an agnostic himself, was incredibly objective, careful with his sources, and sensitive to the topic and all the characters and witnesses involved.  For Allen, I give 5 stars -- I'd give him the sky if I could.
So as you can imagine, seeing this in the video store during my winter break was absolutely delightful.  I begged my company to watch it with me, and all agreed, trusting me that it would be as good as I thought it would.
Wrong.  The movie was a perversion of the book the entire way through.  I couldn't even believe that the director and writers had the nerve of even suggesting that the movie was ""based"" on the book by Allen.  William Friedkin's portrayal of Blatty's The Exorcist was more accurate and true to this ""true story"" than this movie that claims to be based on the book.  They liberally changed events and facts around, including the characters of the priests and the boy and his family, as well as the very important details surrounding the exorcism.  Furthermore, the exorcism scenes were ridiculous and unconvincing.  From reading the book, it is quite clear that Friedkin's Exorcist was much much closer to the real-life description so eloquently portrayed in Allen's book.
If you want to learn about what diabolical possession really is and what it is like to witness one, don't watch this film.  You will pee in your pants because you will be laughing too hard.  Instead, read Thomas B. Allen's Possessed, and watch William Peter Blatty's The Exorcist.  Also check out Malachi Martin's Hostage to the Devil and M. Scott Peck's People of the Lie.",1004832000,6,2370,4.783783783783784
1627182,4,B00005MM9H,"Ok, I just have to say that I hated the THE EXORCIST. It was pointless and nasty and not scary at all. POSSESSED is a far superior film, with believable and well-rounded characters, as well as a more interesting plot line. Two thumbs up!",997056000,7,237,4.409090909090909

1627248,4,B00005MM9H,"It was okay, I think after you've seena few possession movies, you lose the edge to be terrified.

1627249,5,B00005MM9H,"Based on Thomas Allen's book of the same name, the 2000 Showtime TV movie ""Possessed"" purports to tell the real story of the 1940s exorcism that gave rise to William Peter Blatty's fictionalized ""The Exorcist' novel and film. It's not a great movie, but it's a fun and sometimes thoughtful one. Of course there are the occasional schlock-horror conventions and some inauthenticities: some cheesy scare tactics and details like the habits worn by the religious brothers and the Unitarian-esque building that doubles for Saint Louis University's college church feel entirely phony. But great performances and an effort at authenticity help ground this exploration of exorcism for most of the hour-and-a-half running time.

If you want the real story behind ""The Exorcist,"" the 1990s documentary ""In the Grip of Evil"" gives it, including interviews with Thomas Allen among many other eyewitnesses. The film ""Possessed"" offers a stylized rendition. The basic plot is that a 15-year old Lutheran boy is possessed by the devil, leading his frantic parents to call for a Catholic priest. The Jesuits, an elite missionary and educational order in the Catholic Church, send their heavy artillery in the form of WWII-scarred Father William Bowdern SJ (Timothy Dalton) to expel the demon.

Dalton, the former James Bond known for his Shakespearean gravitas, gives a terrific scenery-chewing performance as the priest that stops just short of being overwrought. It seems that he makes the crucial decision to have fun with his role rather than play it with strict seriousness, giving us a Jesuit priest who is believable precisely because he is emotionally on the edge at all times, fighting the traumatic memory of a scene that opens the film. Excellent supporting work comes from Henry Czerny as a fellow Jesuit priest and Christopher Plummer in a smaller role as the archbishop of St. Louis.

Despite a predominant docudrama feel, the film descends into two major horror set pieces, once during the initial possession and again during the climactic exorcism scene at film's end. Full of stock horror tricks, neither is particularly noteworthy other than for the zealous acting of Dalton. The film works better when it is exploring the nature of evil and the theme of battling our inner demons. Nevertheless, it's an unusually sensitive and insightful movie overall, and is not as tawdry as what you might see on Showtime's made-for-TV productions today. It's also pretty much a PG-13 movie, making it an acceptable alternative to ""The Exorcist"" for younger viewers, similar to the duller ""Exorcism of Emily Rose."" It's a rare film that you will want to see at least once if you're interested in this subject. Also, the DVD comes with a couple of nice extra features, just enough to whet your interest in reading up more on this case.",1398211200,3,2824,5.0950323974082075
1627250,4,B00005MM9H,"I really like Timothy Dalton, and the other actors were good in this too.  The little boy who plays the 'possessed' does quite a good job.  In some ways for a factual event, it seemed a bit over the top, but, so was the 'Exorcist'.  Still an 'enjoyable' horror movie.",1376784000,,267,4.3

1627316,2,B00005MM9H,"""Possessed"" may have been a well intentioned attempt to honor the memory of dearly departed Jesuit priest Fr. William Bowden, who as we all know by now performed the infamous exorcism on ""Robbie Mannheim"", aka ""Roland Doe"", in a St. Louis hospital in 1949.  Timothy Dalton gives a fantastic (if a bit overdone) performance as the war torn, tough-as-nails Jesuit who eventually became convinced that this was no common, run-of-the-mill juvenile delinquent, but a victim of Beelzebub.

Aside from that and Christopher Plummer's performance as Archbishop Hume, a politician yet also decent man who recognizes the necessity of the exorcism and also recognizes Bowden's greatness as a priest.

And that's all she wrote in terms of merit for this otherwise corny piece of trash, folks.  Two decent performances with a backdrop of such unbelievable, not to mention fictive, embellished nonsense that is so lacking in any critical element, any subtlety, that at times I actually grew angry watching it (and that little bit about having purchased it as well.)  Can one in all fairness blame a child actor? Well, if one can, the horrendous performance by then eleven year old Jonathan Malen falls under the rubric of ruinously hammy.  When he spits, gets black teeth, chucks out the green stuff (yep, they were heavily relying on the original as one might guess), it just doesn't feel the same.  And ""The Exorcist"" was so good that I'll go for leftovers, provided they aren't donations.  And I'm a Catholic, so when I'm not a fan of donations, you know they really stink.  This one did.  One of the funniest films I've ever seen to waste two great actors.",1287619200,,1645,4.927536231884058

1627318,4,B00005MM9H,"I had only seen about 7-8 minutes of the film's finale and then I went out and purchased this film.  I had some knowledge of the real case on which the film, The Exorcist was based and wanted to see the film treatment.  The film features Timothy dalton and Christopher Plummer as the two priests at the center of helping to exorcise a young boy in St. Louis.  It is a strong psychological thriller and good horror film that raises many doubts, questions and fears.  Dalton is outstanding as the battle-scarred and post-traumatic syndrome sufferer (chaplain) who now must battle the demons that have possessed a small boy.  I found this film to be a better thriller than a horror film but with plenty of shocks.  Watch this and be drawn into this weird and frightening true event.  There are at least two books written about this true possession and exorcism.",1257638400,,858,4.642384105960265
1627319,1,B00005MM9H,"I've got to agree with 'Historical Fiction Fan' on this one, and then some. I recorded this, hoping that Timothy Dalton's presence would lend some credence to the subject of the movie. After 20-30 minutes or so, I had to stop and do a web search on this thing to see whether or not it had been mislabeled as a drama. It certainly seemed to start out that way, but about as soon as it turned towards the young boy, who appears to become possessed (or something anyway), it just went way too over the top. I couldn't help but laugh. If I had seen this in a theater, I would have been laughing so hard, I might have been heckled out of the show. The fact that the movie rotates from serious to seemingly comical so quickly just makes it worse (or funnier). I find it hard to believe that this was not done intentionally. I have a feeling that the actors all pulled a big one over on everyone and are still laughing quite hard about it today. I'm not even sure what to say about those who have commented on the wonderfully serious and honest approach that they thought this movie gave to the subject. Am I missing a big inside joke here?!
I'll watch the rest of it, but I can't see how it could possibly turn itself around. It's like one of those old Saturday Night fake commercials, where you think you're watching a real commercial and then it just gets weird, and then you finally reaize it's a joke. Only this time, I don't think there's really supposed to be a punchline.",1228348800,3,1472,4.298561151079137
1627320,1,B00005MM9H,"In this Showtime TV-movie, based upon a supposed real case of exorcism, Timothy Dalton plays a priest who becomes drawn into a situation with a young boy supposedly possessed.

The performances are stone serious or absurdly childish, there is no suspense to be found in the writing, effects or production design, and it left me disappointed that no matter how hard I tried, I couldn't take the film seriously. It isn't delivered in a believable way, and becomes lost in mediocrity.

I can't recommend the film, but I can somewhat recommend the book, which is at least a somewhat interesting, if not all too convincing read.",1226016000,4,623,4.867924528301887

I was scared out of my mind by the Exorcist, but the look and feel of this movie was not convincing and, consequently, not at all scary to me.  The actors just didn't seem to fit the movie, especially the child who was supposed to be possessed - nobody really looked their part in a convincing way.

1627322,4,B00005MM9H,"I enjoyed this film a lot more than any or all of the Exorcist films, primarily because it tends to stick a little closer to the facts in the case (yes it still throws hollywood tricks in to make it more exciting) and details more of the innner life of the priests.  Timothy Dalton is great and his camaraderie with the other priest in the story is terrific.  When I saw any version of The Exorcist I was always fascinated by the priests and wanted more of their stories and their struggles.  This movie gives you more of that and shows them realistically faltering on their own to learn about and perform the exorcism rite.  No exorcism film comes closer to the real facts (internet study shows it was not quite so fantastic as this film or any makes out) or is more entertaining than this one.",1180224000,4,795,4.387755102040816
