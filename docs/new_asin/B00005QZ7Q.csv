7951342,4,B00005QZ7Q,"THE FOLLOWING REVIEW WAS FOR VOL1.  ....
The character designs are awful. I've heard better voice acting, though it does seem to fit the designs. It is NOT the original Dirty Pair. However...The plot and dialogue were written by DP's creator, and the story holds up so well that you want to overlook the other flaws. Fans of the original DP will not be disappointed. Forget the other flash releases. The less said about them, the better.",1015372800,,437,4.675324675324675
7951343,4,B00005QZ7Q,"My favorite of the 3 Dirty Pair Flash missions, Mission 2 finds Kei and Yuri stuck on World's World, a planet theme park based on 20th C. Tokyo, all because Yuri trashed the spaceport with her landing. Their mission is to bodyguard Touma, a 3WA agent and computer whiz there to fix the World's World computer.
In the first of the 5 episodes, they protect Touma from assasins in their usual destructive style.  In the second, after inadvertently blowing up their hotel, they get put up in an all-girls school with a ghost problem, where Yuri has too much fun at Kei's expense. The third has the Lovely Angels chasing a wanted con artist which lands them outside the city, surrounded by nature and trying to find their way back (with some brief nudity) -- all for a nice meal. Touma falls in love with the flower shop girl in the fourth, but does he really have her heart? The mission wraps up nicely in the fifth ep when it's revealed that the original threat is still out there, and it's up to the Dirty Pair to track it down.
This mission does better than the other two because Kei and Yuri seem to play off each other well, especially during their bickering, the plot is easy to follow and the situations they find themselves in aren't *that* far-fetched. The extras are pretty basic: clean credit animation, trailer, character bios, and the standard ADV previews.",1013126400,5,1366,4.575510204081633
