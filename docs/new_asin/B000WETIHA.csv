8472573,4,B000WETIHA,"This video was very up to date and informative, fresh, mod and innovative. I really was stunned by the interlocking and chrokee braiding no knot cornrow technique which makes me wanna try it like yesterday you see. The braid illusions looks really good to try but to me it is one of the hardest of all the techniques and takes probably triple the time to do a traditional weave people. When I saw the stylist use the dental floss loop to knot the bulk hair I was like wowwwwwww[...] a technique she(the stylist) is really talented and works neat. All of the methods used were very natural looking and very gorgeous. One downfall is the methods went by quickly especially the interlooking and net weave to name a few. I prefer in future you show your model at differnet angles and slow down on the demonstration a bit so beginners and do at home wives like me can do. Overall this video was very very innovative.",1216684800,4,911,4.493975903614458
