4934437,5,B00632KT0U,These are 3 of stevens best movie's and were a great addition to my collection. I really enjoyed watching them with my kids,1359504000,2,123,4.391304347826087
4934438,5,B00632KT0U,It is great value for money as there are 3 movies in 3 discs. I like Under Siege the most as it is one of the best Steven Seagal movies besides the other two movies. The story may be a bit hard to accept but it is entertaining. As Steven Seagal does most of the stunts in the three movies. It is still enjoyable after repeated viewing time after time. This is of the reason why people like to buy and keep movies.,1343692800,2,413,3.9879518072289155
4934439,4,B00632KT0U,"Okay, first of all, Steven Seagal?  Not a great actor... actually I wouldn't even consider him a good actor!!  However, I do believe that Undersiege and Undersiege 2 are two of his better movies.  Soo... this three-pack of movies on blu-ray for roughly $10?  How can you honestly go wrong?

If you like these movies, buy them.  They look good, it's just the movies without any frills, but honestly, these movies didn't have any additions originally that I can remember!!  For the price, it's hard to pass up.

Thanks!",1332288000,2,517,4.730337078651686

4934498,5,B00632KT0U,I grew up watch Steven take names and kick ass and he did just that in this awesome Blu-ray pack,1461024000,,96,3.85
4934499,5,B00632KT0U,"Most times when you receive a Blu-Ray Triple feature the way the disks are put into the case are a pain, but I like how this one was organized. Now to the movies, I've seen them all before, and I absolutely love them. Buy this pack rather then buying the individual movies it's much cheaper. Obviously if you're looking at the review you are either a new or old Steven Seagal fan. These are his best movie adding Out For Justice to that mix. So if you want the best of Seagal buy this pack and Out For Justice. Then you will be satisfied",1460592000,,537,4.173076923076923
4934500,5,B00632KT0U,A nice trio of early Seagal movies with high action and intrigue.  Highly recommended.,1459555200,,86,5.142857142857143

4934504,1,B00632KT0U,"I your a big Steven seagal fan and already have blu-ray versions of Above the Law, Under siege, Under siege 2
then don't bother wasting your money on this blu-ray triple set
cause there is nothing special about it
all Warner bros have done is get the Individual titles and repackage them in a 3 Disc blu-ray case that is all
so your paying 1 price for all 3 films really
the 3 Discs are exactly the same as the Individual blu-ray titles, no Difference at all except for the packaging that's it
which means there are no new extras at all, infact a big fat O of extras, if your lucky there are Theatrical trailers for the films
plus being blu-ray Transfers i was expecting better sound quality for sure, i was expecting 5.1 Master audio mixes
there is no 5.1 Master audio mix for either of the 3 films
only Dolby Digital 5.1 mix for all 3 films which is the same sound quality as the old dvd versions
so pretty Disgusting effort by WB i must say
but i can say the HD transfers for the 3 films are much sharper & clearer quality than the old dvd versions
so that's the only thing positive about this blu-ray set are the HD transfers, but that's it

this blu-ray set only worth $5 or less, based on no extras at all, poor 5.1 quality
these 3 steven seagal films definitely deserve more respect in the sound quality & the extras
and it's obvious WB don't give a Damn at all otherwise there would be some new special features at least
so either buy the Individual titles or get this triple blu-ray set, only Difference is the packaging nothing else
about 1 star for this blu-ray set
shocking effort by WB what else is new with them",1435708800,,1625,4.275974025974026

4934538,5,B00632KT0U,"I am an action movie fan, through and through, and am always looking for good deals on blu-ray action movies.  Well, look no further than this trio of action movies on blu-ray starring none other than a true 90s action hero, Steven Seagal.  In all three of these action-packed movies (Above the Law, Under Siege and Under Siege 2: Dark Territory), the Aikido Black Belt and all-around action star is in top form, using both his martial arts expertise and a plethora of guns to take down armies of bad guys in classic Seagal form.

The visuals are well-done and truly showcase what blu-ray should look like, the sound is crisp and with surround sound truly immerses you in the experience, and the movies themselves are phenomenal in story and scope.

You can't go wrong with this trio of movies - especially so well-done on blu-ray.  Truly a great deal.",1362614400,10,852,4.653333333333333

8491678,5,B00632KT0U,"Mr. Steven Seagal will surely go down as the most tragically underestimated thespian of our generation! While we constantly deify overrated actors like Michael Fassbender, Christian Bale, and Gary Oldman, we forget that Mr. Seagal is an artist who elevates Aikido on screen to the level of French ballet! At times, Mr. Seagal puts on a restrained, emotional performance, speaking through his eyes rather than the explicit violence of his fists.

If you would like a representation of cinema as art in the mid nineties, look no further than at this masterful set of Mr. Seagal's magnum opuses, Under Siege, Under Siege 2, and the lesser known third entry to the ""Kick Ass Chef Trilogy"", ""Above the Law"". You will be in awe at what mankind has achieved on the screen!",1501977600,,765,4.8396946564885495
