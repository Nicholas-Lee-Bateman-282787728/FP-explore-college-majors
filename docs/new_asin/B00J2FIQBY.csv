8647393,5,B00J2FIQBY,"A nice qigong practice with a soothing music background.  A practice without instruction is also included.  What I like about this one is that it is short.  The entire practice with warm up takes about 16 minutes whereas most qigong dvd routines are at least 30 minutes long.  During times where I am pressed for time, I use this one so I can keep a daily habit in place.",1494720000,3,371,4.333333333333333

8647396,5,B00J2FIQBY,"I will soon have to buy another copy of this DVD I've watched it so much.  I've also purchased The Spirit of Qigong, Wise Woman Qigong and the book Women's Qigong for Health and Longevity.  In addition, I've been fortunate enough to have attended two of Deborah Davis' workshops.  She's a wonderful teacher!  The DVD's are easy to follow while giving lots of information about each movement (very important to me).  You learn why what you're doing makes a difference in the way you feel and the results are, as advertised, immediate.  I wish I'd discovered qigong decades earlier.
