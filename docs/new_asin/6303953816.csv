749146,4,6303953816,"Elvis Presley stars in his second film, and this is a fictionalized version of how he became a star. Deke Rivers (Elvis Presley) is talked into doing a song on stage by a press agent Glenda (Lizabeth Scott).
Her ex-hushand named Walker ""Tex"" Warner. He is the bandleader. He is played by Wendell Corey. Deke is a truck driver. Glenda wants him to join her ex-hushand's band. And she calls his boss and gets him fired.
Deke does join. He falls for another young singer named Susan (Dolores Hart). But is aslo drawn to Glenda. And soon Deke is booked for a one-man show. Glenda pulls a trick, she buys Deke a car and telling him it is from an anonymous rich widow.
And to do that Glenda fires Susan. Deke drives Susan to her house, and Susan thinks he did that because she thinks that Deke found out that she was fired.
But Deke doesn't know that. Glenda has to fire Susan to pay for the car. Deke sings Loving You to Susan and her family. After that, Glenda shows up with the car. But when Deke finds out that Glenda and Tex used to be married, he takes off. When Glenda finds out she goes out to look for Deke, finding him she makes him go back, and rips up the contract. Elvis's parents show up at the final concert as extras in the audience.",988848000,4,1243,4.248945147679325
749147,5,6303953816,"""Loving You"" believe it or not, could have been called ""The Elvis Presley Story"", since the movie encompasses around the point of Elvis' musical career. Elvis' character even starts out as a truck driver  in the movie. Producer Hal Wallis did everything he could to make it just  perfect. The songs are great, the movie is great, and Elvis is great as he  rocks and rolls in this musical classic1 Watch the movie, and you'll like  it a lot!",960163200,10,440,4.531645569620253

749331,5,6303953816,"I have waited years for this movie to be available on DVD. I am a big Elvis fan but I must say that most of the movies that he did after his army discharge were junk. What a hole for him to be stuck in. His very best movies are as follows. Love Me Tender, Jailhouse Rock, Loving you, King Creole,Flaming Star and Wild In The Country. I will throw in Viva Las Vegas because his co star, Ann Margret was equal in fame and talent. As huge as his talent and career were it could have been so much bigger if he had only dumped that Dutch Nazi, Cornell  Tom Parker",1439164800,2,558,3.982142857142857

749391,4,6303953816,"I saw this on tv one night in the 70's when there wasn't anything great on the schedule, & it was pot luck. This was 50's Elvis, before the crazy troubles, when he was new to all. It's loosely based on him, a teenage truck driver who sings
a little, gets discovered by an agent and becomes a local hit, before he becomes a national star. The music is great as it also picks up on some budding early Elvis mania. Even if you're not a fan this is good. I would say that this, Jailhouse Rock & Viva Las Vegas are his best, all before he went on to his destiny.",1424044800,,557,3.982142857142857

749429,5,6303953816,"Just a word of warning, while this is a fun Elvis movie be aware that some of these DVD's went bad.  I bought my copy when it was first released in 1999 by Lions Gate Entertainment and Trimark Home Video.  It played fine back then but today no matter what DVD player I put it in it tells my it is not the DVD format and will not play.  I can't even get to work on my computer.  I'm hoping to find and older model DVD player to try it in but so far no luck.  So make sure those selling have a working copy or a return policy should you get the message ""not DVD Format"" or ""bad disc"" from your DVD/Blu-ray player.",1413936000,,611,3.8951612903225805

749481,5,6303953816,"First,it's a great dvd color-wise and image-wise(widescreen).Second,Elvis was at the top of his game in the film,the story of which loosely parallels is own. The performances vary stylistically(compare ""Lonesome Cowboy"" to"" Mean Woman Blues""),giving the wide field in which he was able to play,all to his credit. He may have just started dying his hair black,but the music is true-blue rock and roll(for the most part....""Teddy Bear"" ain't nothin' but a pop song and ""Lonesome Cowboy"" is of a genre all its own).The cast does its job very well and the story engages from start to finish. In the last musical number,Elvis' mother and father can be seen in the audience. And Wanda Jackson knew a good song when she heard it: she chose ""Party"" to record herself.",1393545600,3,759,4.9375

749484,4,6303953816,"Delores Hart's really big movie was Where the Boys Are but she got her beginning with this Elvis movie.  His teenage angst was never something I could identify with, but Delores played someone who was brainy and true to her character and because of that was very appealing.  The fact that she found and made a 45 year vocation as a Benedictine  nun made her character seem real.  This was really the beginnings of Elvis' teenage exploitation movies.  That may have been true of him but not of her.",1389657600,3,497,4.53932584269663

The color is great and it brings back memories of the time I first saw it many years ago.  I would like to have gotten it in DVD but have been unable to find it, therefore I ordered the VHS.

749554,3,6303953816,"I absolutely love this movie, and have been looking forward to having it on DVD. It's got some of Elvis's great songs of the pre-Army days, a spirited little story with a happy ending, and while it's not as good as ""Jailhouse Rock,"" it's still one of his best.

That said, however, I'm wondering why it is that this one is so much more expensive than any other Elvis movie on DVD. Most don't run more than $15; yet this one is listed at $79.99 -- I haven't seen a price like that on a DVD since early in the video age! It's not even Blu-Ray. Even entire seasons of television shows don't run this pricy anymore.

I'm hoping it's a typo and that I can eventually get it, because right now, I can't justify that price, no matter how much I love Elvis!",1374192000,2,749,4.194444444444445

We had only heard his recordings up to now,and ""Love Me Tender "" being a Western did not show his magnetism off.

He has superb co-stars in Lizbeth Scott, Wendell Corey and of course the lovely Dolores Hart who help make this film a family affair.

The great songs TEDDY BEAR, HOT DOG, GOT A LOT OF LINING TO DO & PARTY are all there to help to make this my all time Favourite Elvis movie with KING CREOLE up there in second place, the Remastering is superb, a delight to watch and as with the man himself it is timeless,try buying it I guarantee you will not regret it....like Sinatra these two Masters of their trade will be remembered for many years to come.

Nothing to complain about, really, except for the strangest bonus features I've ever come across. Brief chats with NBC-Tv personalities, not a one of whom had anything to do with Elvis. The comments from people like Jay Leno and others are absolutely useless, bewildering and shallow. Only Martin Sheen (!) manages to say, well, anything, and after it's over you find he spent six minutes or so expounding on basically one 20-second thought. At least he realizes it.
Hmmm. Maybe we should do this with all musical dvd's, interview celebrities who have nothing to do with the films. I would love to hear what, say, Park Overall thinks about ""Head"". The Monkees movie, that is.",1213488000,,764,4.884615384615385

749865,3,6303953816,"This movie is a lot more fun than Jailhouse Rock and Viva Las Vegas. I could almost say it's better than Wild in the Country. They're definitely in competition.
This was before Wild in the Country and he's a better actor in this. Sad Wild came later. Elvis wasn't that good of an actor but he was an entertainer and he succeeds on that level in this movie.
Unlike Wild, this movie moves at a good pace. It is loaded with songs, lipsynced but it's still fun to watch them. Elvis plays a troubled country boy whose talent is discovered by Lizabeth Scott. Even in 1957, Lizabeth was still beautiful. She plays a half villian type role. The noir movies in the 40's were more suited for her but she pulls this off okay. Dolores Hart, who later was cast in ""Where the Boys Are"", gives a nice performance also as a pretty innocent country girl.
Wild in the Country is unintentionally funny all the way. But if you want a movie more closer to the definition of good I would go for this one. The last ten minutes are quite silly though.",1062028800,13,1027,4.3264248704663215
749866,5,6303953816,"""Loving You"" is based on a story written by Mary Agnes Thompson from the magazine Good Housekeeping.  At the time she wrote the story, the young Oklahoma girl had no idea it would be transformed into the wonderful big screen sensation starring one of the biggest stars in the world.  Even though the story seems biographical regarding Elvis, Mary Agnes Thompson knew nothing about him aside from hearing a couple of his songs on the radio.  This movie is a must see for all, not only Elvis fans.  If you're lucky enough to find a copy of the story, it is worth the read.",1059523200,25,570,4.451923076923077
749867,5,6303953816,"This very pleasant film is very enjoyable to watch. It is almost an early biographical film showing ""how "" ELV1S was discovered and then marketed. The only difference is in real life after ELV1S was discovered he was taken advantage of by his real manager who took 50% of the earinings , an unheard amount which ended up in court after the death of the ""King"".  But back to the film, the most enjoyable part of the film is seeing ELV1S on stage rocking with several great numbers, however one of my favorite songs of all time is the beautiful ballad called ""Loving You"" a simple ballad song with feeling and a wonderful voice that many don't remember ELV1S for. This film shows ELV1S can rock as well as sing some of the most beautiful ballads in the world. The song ""Loving You"" is worth the price as it is sung in  a couple different settings and sung at 2 different tempos,( I prefer the slow one) . ELV1S wasn't just the ""king of rock and roll"" but one of the best ballad singers in history. One enjoyable bit of trivia, is to watch and see the real parents of ELV1S in the crowd as ELV1S sings a rocking song and goes down into the cheering crowd. Keep your eyes open and you will see his dad and the mother that he adored and cherished.",1059004800,12,1242,4.280851063829787
749868,5,6303953816,"""Loving You"" could have almost been called ""The Elvis Presley Story"" since it revolves around a young truck driver who reluctantly gets his start in the music business by just singing for the locals at a picnic in a small Texas town. He reluctantly gets started and tours with a country/western band through every town in Texas and becomes a rock'n'roll superstar. It's the story of Elvis all over! The film doesn't get any better and very enjoyable. Look for Elvis' mother and father, Gladys and Vernon as cameo parts in the televised concert finale. Gladys can be clearlty seen on the right when Elvis dances in the aisle. Years after Gladys died, Elvis never wanted to see this picture again, even though that was the only appearance she was in. A good visual aid to the person who is just discovering Elvis. This is what he is REALLY like. ""Loving You"" comes so close to the beginning of the true story of Elvis Presley.",1036108800,13,924,4.606060606060606
749869,3,6303953816,"I suppose some folks feel that "" Jailhouse Rock"" was Elvis, best film. Other prefer ""King Creole"" ( A Stone for Danny Fisher) , myself I prefer this 1957 entry because it was his first color film..and much more.
We are aware that Elvis, mom was in the audience during the filming in that theater scene. I suppose this was one reason why Elvis didn't watch this film much after the passing of his mom.
There is nothing special abut the story ( its really his). The cast of Wendell Corey and Lizabeth Scott make it happen and adds some real character to the plot line. The songs , I think are Elvis, best. That includes the bridge "" Hot Dog"" and "" Cowboy""
Finally, this film has one of the few performances of Dolores Hart. Even the sweet Judy Tyler couldn't match Ms. Hart,s sincerity in performance. The original sound track on vinyl is worth big dollars. This is the way I like to remember Elvis.!!",1002499200,10,899,4.389221556886228

7857941,5,6303953816,"One of Elvis' best films. I'd call Jailhouse Rock number one and this number two. Here is young Elvis in a good story, great color, very good songs. He is young and raw. It's amazing because Elvis wouldn't watch either of those two movies. Jailhouse has Judy Tyler who died, and this film has a few brief shots of Elvis' parents with his mother who died. Too bad because he should have continued with good songs, a nice story and a chance to really act.
This film was made before he went into the army, before the movie/sound track album rut grounded Elvis' talent. The DVD is so well done! You really see what the young King looked like, stood like, his smile, his stance, his moves, his early, raw acting...it's all here.
I'm told that due to some sort of copyright situation, this film isn't in circulation. Thus, the high prices of the DVDs.
It was a good move for the studio to make a quality Elvis film and not a common cheap black and white Rock 'N Roll movie like so many others. Lizabeth Scott and Wendell Corey were experienced seasoned actors. Surrounding Elvis with actors of this caliber did not continue, but they did it here.
In this film you can see just how unusual this young man was in looks, appearance, and style. Elvis really was unique. And it seems like he knew it and had fun with it!",1507075200,,1309,4.390946502057613
