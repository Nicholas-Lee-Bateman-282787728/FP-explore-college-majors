8174880,2,B00004STEJ,The lighting is poor and the sound quality is poor.  One of the dance numbers is flat out annoying and the solo singing is not really enjoyable due to the sound quality. Probably the last three dance numbers are the best but hard to watch with the lighting and camera action.  I am an avid tango junkie and I will probably put this video on a shelf and never watch it again.,1019347200,3,374,4.180555555555555
8174881,3,B00004STEJ,"I think the problem with these kind of movies, is mine own interpretation of the tha tango, the choreography is realy good i have to admit, some things are funny, but still I miss the tension , real passion. In my eyes this show has to much choreography. But that is because I dance for myself, and then you are always looking to other aspects of the dance. But if you are not an experienced dancer, than this show is great to view",1003536000,2,431,4.204819277108434
8174882,5,B00004STEJ,"This video is one of three Tango cabaret shows filmed in Buenos Aires, Argentina. The others are Senor Tango, Gypsy Passion. All are sold on Amazon. This fascinating show is made up of several acts, mixing live solo Tango orchestras & orchestras & dancers. The dancers acts range from couples to groups with expert up to master level Tango dancers. Some of the acts are sexy but all have a comedy fun feeling. All the acts were meticulously choreographed by the great Frenando Solero. This is my favourite of the three cabaret show videos in this series. It has the Master Tango dancers Gloria Barrand & Eduardo Arquimbau with Orquesta De Norberto Ramos & Orquesta De Carlos Lazzari.",983836800,4,683,4.796610169491525
