8298284,5,B001EI5C50,"A couple of factors I really enjoyed about the original UFC was open-weight combat and the tournament format, albeit one night only. During Pride's final days, they put on their version of the ""Ultimate Ultimate"" to determine the absolute best better of Pride. By the time this DVD was released, PrideFC was under Zuffa's ownership; so the format of the DVD is a bit different from earlier Pride DVD's.

In addition to the event itself, the special features contained in this disc include: Fighter Interviews. This runs for over 22mins and includes Mark Hunt, Zulu, Roman Zentsov, Josh Barnett, James Thompson, Alistair Overeem, Aleksander Emelianenko, Antonio Rodrigo Noguiera, Fabricio Werdum, Hidehiko Yoshida, Kazuyuki Fujita, Tsuyoshi Kohsuka, Yosuke Nishijima, and Ikuhisa Minowa.

Post-Fisht Interviews run for about 7mins and includes Mark Hunt, Josh Barnett, Antonio Rodrigo Noguiera, and Mirko Cro Cop with Barnett taking up most of the interview time.
Also included is a 5min Walk-in Montage of each fight along with a 3min Photo Montage of the fighters in and around the arena. Great open-weight tournament and one of the last of it's kind with all the big name fighters.",1271116800,,1183,5.221052631578948
8298285,4,B001EI5C50,"Pride's Total Elimination Absolute (aka Total Elimination 2006) was the first of an open weight three-event tournament, the later two events being Critical Countdown Absolute and Final Conflict Absolute. There are some mismatches, which I suppose is to be expected since the best fighters should meet later in the tourney, but overall this is a solid event.

Gilbert Yvel v. Roman Zentsov (alternate bout) (8/10)
Yvel comes out swinging, Zentsov gets a few off himself and they take it to the ground. There's some back and forth as they jostle for position. A near submission is escaped, but a knockout results as they stand. Entertaining.

Alistair Overeem v. Fabricio Werdum (7/10)
This fight is a mix of striking and ground fighting, but there's not great energy to it. Dull at times, things nevertheless end in a nice submission.

Mark Hunt v. Tsuyoshi ""TK"" Kohsaka (9/10)
Didn't see this coming going into it, but this may be the fight of the night! They slug it out like mad several times, there's a near submission, and both guys seem to get rocked at various points. Saying a fighter ""has heart"" in MMA is way overused (looking at you, Joe Rogan), but this is a true example of heart. Great stuff.

Josh Barnett v. Aleksander Emelianenko (7.5/10)
Both fighters get to show off their styles in this fight. They stand and bang, as Emelianenko especially uses punches and knees effectively. On the ground, Barnett shows nice control and patience. Things eventually end in a surprising and sudden submission.

Kazuyuki Fujita v. James Thompson (8/10)
Both fighters do some damage with punches and knees, and in the end they're standing toe to toe slugging it out. This and the Hunt/TK fight may be the most entertaining of the night, though don't look for technical battles here! Just straight up brawls.

Mirko ""Cro Crop"" Filipovic v. Ikuhisa Minowa (7.5/10)
Cro Cop displays his usual striking prowess, while Minowa keeps things interesting with an unorthodox somersault kick. Things end before too long with some damaging ground and pound blows.

Antonio Rodrigo ""Minotauro"" Nogueira (7/10)
The standard David v. Goliath fight that Japanese fans enjoy so much. Some excellent ground work and a submission finish are the story of this bout. An expected finish, which keeps this from getting higher marks.

Hidehiko Yoshida v. Yosuke Nishijima (8/10)
This one doesn't last too long as technique wins out over strength. Good ground work and a sub finish, like the previous fight.",1231977600,2,2483,4.995157384987894
8298286,5,B001EI5C50,"There is nothing like a Pride ""Open Weight"" Grand Prix, and Total Elimination absolute lived up to my expectations. Most of the matches were very entertaining, only one of the matches was a little slow (Werdum vs Overeem) but still it wasn't that bad.  The match between Mark Hunt & T.K. is a must see.  I have much respect for TK after this match with Hunt. Barnett & Emelianenko, Aleksander was a pretty good match as well, but one of the fighters cardio seems to run empty and his ground skills are exposed and ends up getting him in trouble.  I enjoyed the Thompson vs Fujita match as well.

The disc also includes prefight and post fight interviews with the fighters.  The only thing I regret is that Zuffa should have made this a 3 disc set for $40. Might have been better to put all 3 rounds in one package since they will not be releasing the 2nd round of the tournament any time soon. Still it is a great buy, if your a MMA fan & most importantly a Pride fan, then this DVD is a must.",1226448000,,993,4.232804232804233
8298287,4,B001EI5C50,"I mean having at hand a reaally nice official event poster that could be used to be the cover art (in fact, that's what the people who made the 2005 GP did) the dude decides to play around and creates his own... and puts in the cover a squash match and the opening fight of the tournament (no counting the reserve match)...

I would recommend to wait to see if the whole tournament is released in a DVD box set. if you don't wanna wait and you have a region free DVD player, buying a region 2 release of the tournament (the whole tournament comes in a DVD box set) is a good option... if you still wanna buy it and don't care about how the event is presented, go ahead... like the person who reviewed this first, I also think this is a great event with some awesome fights...

thank good they are doing a good job with the bushido releases.. I swear to good if they put olaf alfonso and krazy horse in the cover of bushido 11 just because they are known in america i'll kill somebody :]",1226102400,,986,4.157068062827225
8298288,5,B001EI5C50,"This event is probably the second best dvd that has been released since Pride was bought by the UFC. The first round of the 2006 tournament, a total of 8 fights which are all exciting. Really no boring fights in the entire event, and every one features a top guy in their division. See guys like Antonio Rodrigo Nogueira and why they call him the ""Giant Killer"" and see Cro Cop start his run for the belt as he literally destroys everyone in his way starting with Ikuhisa Minowa. Aleksander Emelianenko has an impressive showing against Josh Barnett but there is a turn of events in the second round! James Thompson vs Kazuyuki Fujita was a slugfest for the later part of the fight with someone taking a killer punch in the end. Mark Hunt vs Tsuyoshi Kohsaka was a great fight and a great showing of heart by TK. All in all, every fight had something great to offer to fans of MMA.
