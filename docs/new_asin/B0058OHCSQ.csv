8462013,5,B0058OHCSQ,"I had not heard of The Airborne Toxic Event until my brother played a CD of them.  This is a very talented group of musicians and singers and I really enjoyed this dvd of their concert.  There were also behind the scenes of the group working on their music.  I would describe their music as soft rock, and their songs have a personal story to them.  Highly recommended.",1346976000,,369,4.382352941176471
