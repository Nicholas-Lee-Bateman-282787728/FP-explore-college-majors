7934356,5,B000059XZN,My family's favorite movie. It's a shame it hasn't been released on DVD,1501459200,2,71,4.538461538461538
7934357,5,B000059XZN,"Great movie... but extremely hard to find.  Here's hoping that Disney will stop re-releasing different sing along and non sing along versions of Frozen, and give this amazing film what it truly deserves: a Blu-ray and DVD re-release, potentially in 2018, to coincide with its 20th anniversary.",1420070400,,293,5.23404255319149

7934359,5,B000059XZN,"Looking for this movie for awhile on dvd..No luck. Saw it on vhs. Didn't want it used. Took a chance and bought it new on vhs. Really played great. This movie is a good wholesome film. There is some hokey parts to it,just part of the character of this movie. In this day and age when a lot of are family is here with us,but more interested in the device in front of them,wouldn't we all like to get away on a vacation with just them?",1394668800,,433,4.046511627906977
7934360,5,B000059XZN,This movie seems to be a poor vehicle every one in it. Guess what? It is a very funny movie and I really like it. I even own it and watch it from time to time.,1373760000,,159,3.4444444444444446
7934361,5,B000059XZN,I love this movie.  It is so funny!  It is a great family movie about a father named George Piper (Daniel Stern; Home Alone) who rents an RV and takes his family on a vacation following the footsteps of his great grandfather.,1344211200,2,225,4.333333333333333
7934362,5,B000059XZN,"i was either 9 or 10 when i first saw this on the wonderful world of disney back in those days and i remember it being such a fun movie to watch and it made me laugh alot. i just wish it was on DVD too!!! oh well, i'm ordering it for my movie collection because i would love to watch it again and share it with my little cousins once they grow up",1311897600,,346,3.689189189189189
7934363,4,B000059XZN,"It had been a long time since I watched this, so I decided to refresh my memory. It was better than what I remembered. Daniel Stern stars as George Piper who wants to take his family on a vacation to revisit where his Great Grandfather fought in the Civil War. Hilarious hijinx happen along the way. I would recommend TOURIST TRAP!!!",1292025600,,333,4.475409836065574
7934364,5,B000059XZN,This a fun-filled movie for the whole family.  My 5 year old enjoyed it every bit as much as my 8 and 10 year olds did.  Daniel Stern does an great job portraying a Dad out to reconnect with his family.  No matter what.  He's a real dud - or is he?  If you're looking for a light-hearted family-style movie this  one you're sure to enjoy over and over again.,987379200,3,358,4.042857142857143
