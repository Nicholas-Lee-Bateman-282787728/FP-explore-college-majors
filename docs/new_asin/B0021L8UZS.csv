3839359,3,B0021L8UZS,"From my wife Sarah: This movie has received loads of bad reviews, but we saw it anyway because we like the actors and the previews looked good. I was happily surprised to find that it was a decent movie. Granted, it's not one of Hugh Grant's best (like Music & Lyrics, Sense & Sensibility, Notting Hill...), but it did hold my attention from start to finish, it did have a few laughs and the story line was decently played out.

I realize this type of story has been done before, and it was quite predictable. Husband and wife split, a big problem ensues that throws them together, and you can imagine the rest. I don't think it will win any awards. Still, I think Hugh Grant and Sarah Jessica made it worthwhile. They are both so talented and enjoyable to watch. If you've seen all of the more successful films this season and you're looking for a light, entertaining movie, this would be one to consider.",1261180800,7,906,4.457831325301205

3839412,4,B0021L8UZS,"The majority of the five star reviews were very brief. I think they're by people, like me, who love Hugh Grant.
They didn't go into any of the usual lengthy analysis, or descriptions of nuanced performances.

The one star reviews were just the opposite. Usually they are just one word.

Most of their complaints were about the lack of chemistry between Grant and Parker, and the premise of the movie, with the characters from NYC, having to adapt to Ray, Wyoming, in a witness protection program.

I agree, SJP is a naturally reserved woman, and with good writing and direction, eased into her character as Carrie in ""Sex in the City"", and became very comfortable.
However, she was extremely brittle in ""The Family Stone"", a good movie, but one of her first forays after, SIC.
I don't know if feature films are her strength, and she needs to have a series, where she and the audience have time to.get to know her character.
She was great in ""LA Story"" years ago, as a free-spirited, Hollywood nymphet, and as the  bride to be in ""Honeymoon in Vegas"", who was hotly pursued by James Caan, a Mafia figure, after he loses his wife, who Parker is the spitting image of, and trys to steal her away from Nick Cage and their interminable engagement.

She IS a smart actress, and can deliver on quick- witted comebacks, and incredulity, so I think she matched dialogue quite well with Hugh Grant's, usual, dry, quick wit. However, Grants irresistible charm saved the movie, and allowed SJP to benefit from its glow.
I think the movie was well written, with some very funny lines, mostly.delivered by Grant.",1516579200,,1598,4.692857142857143

3839447,3,B0021L8UZS,"I liked the funny parts, but the rest of the film is nothing special. Grant and Parker have no chemistry and it shows. Neither can act either. The best parts of the film are when they're in Wyoming far away from the city of New York where they're used to living. Basically, a fish out of water story. For the most part, it was pretty boring. It was somewhat cute, if you're into that. Basically falls flat.",1502841600,,406,4.285714285714286

3839520,1,B0021L8UZS,Abysmal would be to complimentary as a description of this movie.  Sarah Jessica Parker is hideous - more so than usual and Hugh Grant is forced to go along with the director's and writer's horrible ideas.  The whole premise is moronic and the execution of each scene is painful.  Sam Elliott is always a treat - but I am a female and that is a given.

3839737,1,B0021L8UZS,"...if you didn't consider yourself lucky! In this film, Hugh Grant is paired with Sarah Jessica Parker in perhaps the worst pairing since Vanilla Ice and Naomi Campbell in Cool As Ice. They play a fashionably separated, New York City power couple, who are forced into witness protection after witnessing a murder. These two city folks are put in the care of an elderly U.S. Marshall and his wife, in the middle of nowhere Montana. Let the fun times begin! Didn't Tim Allen and Kirstie Alley do this a decade earlier in Amish country? At least For Richer or Poorer could get a few cheap laughs here and there, but not the Morgans. The Morgans have no chemistry what-so-ever and their film is painfully slow and predictable. Hugh Grant is usually funny, but in this film, every attempt at humor is snuffed out by Sarah Jessica Parker, who has no idea what she's doing. Parker is just one of these people who was lucky enough to find her perfect role and she was amazing in it, but everything I've seen her in since Sex & The City has been awful! Did You Hear About The Morgans has been done, more than once, and if you watch this movie and can't tell what's going to happen, twenty minutes a head of time, then you haven't seen too many movies. This has got to be one of the biggest waste of money in recent Hollywood history and if you decide to watch it, then you're dumber than the casting director who thought pairing Grant and Parker was a good idea.",1386806400,,1453,4.425373134328358

3839790,2,B0021L8UZS,"This movie was a bad concept, a Hollywood version of a modern, wealthy Manhattan power couple who are forced to go to a red state. They have to be forced, because who would go to a red state voluntarily? There they are flabbergasted by all kinds of new experiences, like a visit to a Costco/Wal-Mart store. The portrayal of small town America is pathetic, but I shouldn't have expected anything else. I blame myself for even considering this movie.

I used to be a Hugh Grant fan. He did a wonderful job in About a Boy, and Four Weddings and a Funeral. Unfortunately, he does not just play awkward and aging badly, in this film he really is awkward and aging badly. Sarah Jessica Parker, never my favorite actress, does herself no favors. Mary Steenbergen  is unconvincing as a gun toting, horse riding country woman. Sam Elliott looks like he is resigned to his fate. They must have realized how bad the scrip was, because the actors are so uncomfortable that I actually felt uncomfortable watching them. There were a few comic moments, but most of those were too obvious to generate a real laugh. My wife said that I missed a couple of them because I fell asleep. I feel that I had a better movie experience than she did.",1363046400,,1223,4.529411764705882

This one is actually nothing like Notting Hill or 4Weddings and a Funeral which I think were the best ones but is an interesting movie about a couple in marital problems who suddenly and accidentally witness a crime and have to go under protection custody in a rather far place with some cultural differences.
You sure will enjoy some great acting, some nice scenes and funny events, the course is not very predictable.
Overall, I enjoyed the movie. The quality of picture was good but the sound was a bit muffled on my computer. I prefer to rent movies but had to buy this one because the online rent option was not available. I'm happy with the purchase though.

This movie is clean, which is maybe why it's gotten so many bad reviews - no graphic sex or intense violence.

Especially one who understands what it's like to give up certain basics which we take for granted living in New York City (same can be said for Berlin, Madrid or other major metropolitan city with a distinct character of its own).  Life presents plenty of issues to deal with, so a light-hearted way of looking at your situation and be able to laugh at yourself is just what is needed to help pull through what sometimes may seem as unbearable situation.
I wouldn't judge the acting too harshly.  Yes, both actors can do more serious (or ""deep"" if you prefer) roles,  but the movie achieves its goal to entertain.",1334448000,,685,4.598360655737705

Sarah Jessica Parker looked almost 50 (she's been at it a long time: YOU know, THAT TV series.)
Firstly, early in the film they really should have given her a better make-up job, poor old girl.
Hugh Grant? Well he IS old, has to be 55 by now. Still trying to play the slightly dopey appealing English boy; it really is about time he chucked it in and tried out some serious bad or nasty roles, 'cause he really has HAD it with the funny/cutesy stuff. He's just awfully painful to watch. And he kept ducking his head, almost as though he was saying, 'look, I'm trying to be cute!'
SO?
So there's this couple WELL into middle age trying to make up; and here are we the viewers, trying to give a darn whether they do or not. They are far to 'far gone' for us to really care: Let's face it, we expect our parents who've reached their 50's to either make up or split up, it barely matters.

As fate would have it, they witness a murder, and the following morning, the killer tries to murder Meryl. Into a witness protection program they go, straight from their high powered Manhattan offices to the Wyoming ranch of Sheriff Clay Wheeler and his wife. As the Morgans struggle to cope with the immense changes in their lifestyle, they also have the time to get reacquainted and think about their futures.

Did You Hear About the Morgans is a light romantic comedy, with touches of adventure and danger. It's no Four Weddings and a Funeral, but it's way better than tripe like Forgetting Sarah Marshall or that trash from the Farrelly Brothers. Hugh Grant turns in his usually charming performance, while Sarah Jessica Parker is, well, Sarah Jessica Parker. Sam Elliot comes close to overdoing his old cowhand persona, but Mary Steenberger is delightful as his tough, practical, good hearted wife.

If it had been especially funny it would have been ok, but this movie was nothing special.",1311552000,,389,4.6521739130434785
3839854,2,B0021L8UZS,"Did you hear about the Morgans not being a very good comedy? Holy crap, what does it say about a movie when the best parts about it are the DVD's audio commentary and gag reel? Such be the case for DID YOU HEAR ABOUT THE MORGANS?, a film that not even its two ordinarily dependable leads can extract from the sucky dregs. Hugh Grant and Sarah Jessica Parker do their damndest but even their huge likability isn't enough to surmount the cruddy scriptwriting. Crazy thing is, if you listen to the audio commentary by the director and Hugh and Sarah Jessica, there's no dearth of good chemistry when it's just them being themselves.

It's hard to quit Park Avenue for the boonies, especially if you're a power couple used to the posh things in life. Or even a past tense power couple. Paul Morgan is a successful lawyer. Meryl Morgan is a high end real estate broker, and their divorce is about to be finalized. Except that Paul - he who'd bollocksed things up - is seeking to reconcile. He talks Meryl into a dinner and, later walking it off, the two end up witnessing a murder. The assassin having glimpsed their mugs, it's off to the Witness Relocation Program for Paul and Meryl Morgan. Or, as they're now pseudonymed, the Fosters. In mid-flight, they learn from the laconic NYPD official that they'll be hiding out in a tiny town called Ray, Wyoming. To which a straight-faced Paul asks: ""Is that anywhere near Phil, Wyoming?"" Oh, these superior city slickers just won't stop with their jokes.

In Ray, Wyoming, Paul and Meryl fall into the custody of a grizzled county sheriff and his gun-toting, non-vegetarian wife, and let me interject here how very welcome are Sam Elliott and Mary Steenburgen who both lend a warm, redeeming element to the picture. They're so down to earth they can't help but stabilize the goofy story somewhat. But they can't be in every scene. Maybe because, on the set, Mary Steenburgen is a notorious giggler.

I was tremendously bored for most of the film. For whatever reason (cough*scriptwriting*cough), Hugh and Sarah Jessica on screen just don't click together. Their bicker banter isn't amusing and feels forced. If there's one person absolutely not meant for big open American spaces with all the rurality and the agriculture, it has to be Hugh Grant. He just looks lost and seems to resign himself to blinking a lot. And I normally love Sarah Jessica Parker, but maybe my shallow affection is tied in to those curly locks of hers. With her flattened tresses, she seems less adorable, more shrill, less sex in the city, more ennui in the boonies.

The humor doesn't break new ground. It, in fact, deserves to have quotation marks wrapped around it. In cinema, the ""humorous"" culture clash between overbearing urbanites and the rubes had been explored as far back as in GREEN ACRES and, before that, in flicks like THE EGG AND I. And I never once thought the skit of a city slicker ineptly milking that cow was ever funny. There's also an unessential sub-plot which tracks Paul and Meryl's dueling respective assistants. And yet Wilfred Brimley's (even more grizzled than Sam Elliott) dismissal of Hugh Grant as a tea drinker did make me laugh. Ultimately, DID YOU HEAR ABOUT THE MORGANS? isn't as good as a nap but better than no-hopers such as GHOSTS OF GIRLFRIENDS PAST or ALL ABOUT STEVE. I guess the allure of these two aging heartthrobs still holds some sway. Only, dear God, please hurry them back to the big city. There's absolutely no call for Hugh Grant to terrorize that grizzly bear.

3839869,4,B0021L8UZS,"One thing about Did You Hear About the Morgans? that you absolutely MUST immediately realize is that the film *does* improve dramatically after the first 10 minutes.  For goodness sake!  The first 10 minutes will have viewers believing this is going to be yet another extremely unfunny and typical romance comedy on the part of Hugh Grant and Sarah Jessica Parker with a predictably bland storyline, but it's honestly much better than usual.

That is to say, as soon as the storyline develops to where the two of them take a trip to Wyoming to get away from a crazy gunman roaming the New York streets, *this* is when the storyline improves drastically.

Of course you're not supposed to realize that it doesn't make a whole lot of sense why the gunman is targeting Sarah Jessica Parker and Hugh Grant just because they happened to be at the scene of a surprising crime, but who cares about any logical thinking when the storyline is actually surprisingly *funny*, something I've NEVER EVER said about anything either Hugh grant or Sarah Jessica Parker have starred in before.

When the two of them arrive to Wyoming, right away they're greeted by Sam Elliott's character, and even Wilford Brimley makes an appearance later on.

It is a more 'mature' romantic comedy - dealing with heavier issues than normal - but written with tremendous depth (Honesty, forgiveness, having the courage to move on, start again,  and leave the baggage behind - being human and making mistakes - desperately wanting to be a parent and the stress it causes in a relationship when it doesn't happen - and a love that has the ability to transcend it all - if we can move beyond the pain).

We found it to be very funny - not slap-stick funny, but rather a dry wit which is rather refreshing.  There are no car chases or predictable steamy love scenes, this movie is for someone who wants something more with their popcorn - something deeper - more real.

Personally, I don't like SJP, but thought she nailed the part of the character - no question.  The wedding vows in the movie are simply wonderful.... I searched for hours to try and find them and did - and have printed them out.

If you exist on Harlequin romances - this movie is not for you....

I find Hugh Grant inherently funny in almost anything he does and Sarah Jessica Parker brings a blend of straightforwardness and assertiveness tempered with just the right amount of insecurity and naivite that make her the perfect grown-up especially when she's running behind her horse shouting-I'm not on the horse.
Hugh was properly ashamed of the affair he'd had that prompted their separation in the first place and convincingly penitent. Sara's confession of her own misdeed and how they were brought to a point of mutual trust again by mutually defending each other against the common enemy of the man sent to kill them for their bearing witness to a murder was priceless.

Not only was that a winning comedy, it also served as a great primer on the creative process.  Moreover, it featured a pitch-perfect Easter Egg: the video-within-the-movie that harkens back to Grant's character's Andrew Ridgeley-like existence as ""the other guy"" in a Wham-like pop rock super-nova.  That confection was the creation of a genius.  [The song - 'Pop Goes My Heart' - can stand toe-to-toe with any hit from that early-80s era.]

By contrast, 'Morgans' is a weak outing for both Lawrence and Grant.  The script is a dud.  Grant and co-star SJP accidentally oversee a murder and are forced into a Witness Relocation Program.  That's a highfalutin cover story for the basics of Lawrence's story: a sort of 'Cranky Blue Staters go to Red State and find life is different, but ultimately not too bad' narrative.  The big problem is obvious: zero chemistry between Grant and SJP.  [How were these two characters ever attracted to each other?]  And the story's resolution is insipid:  Sam Elliot.  Horseshoe.  Ringer.  I mean, come on.  Leslie Nielsen, maybe, in full-on Frank Drebin mode.  But Sam Elliot? No.  And stop calling me Shirley.

3839910,1,B0021L8UZS,"I like movies.  I will watch all kinds of movies from all countries.  I truly wish I was watching something else when I watched this!  Once again my wife picked out a movie for us to watch.  This is the woman who has picked out CATCH AND RELEASE nad NEW IN TOWN.  Lets say we are getting close to grounds for divorce here.  Seriously even my wife couldn't believe how DEAD this movie was.  We love Hugh Grant but he just wasn't funny here.  He looked very uncomfortable doing this part.  As for Parker, where was the director?  She came across as a whinny bitchy sterotypical New Yorker.  I am sure those from New York hated her too.  Elliot and Steenburgen, two wonderful actors,  while were the best thing in the movie, had nothing to do or add to the movie.  Elliot was a U.S. marshall and carried a gun but never used it and the only action he got in the movie was pitching horse shoes and milking a cow.  That scene where he is milking and Parker is telling him about her affair is one of the most badly written and awkward scenes I have seen.  No wonder Elliot hid behind the cow's ass during the scene, maybe he was telling the audience something.  I really felt sorry for the bear  He wasn't cute nor brave and even he looked embarrassed.  The plot was choppy at the first and it never really clear why they , Grant and Parker, were apart.  It was here that the two assistants were seen and for some reason they had more to do and chemistry than the main actors.  Of course they were not developed and they too were short changed in plot.

There were about 6 lines in the movie where I similed or laughed, but then again I am hard of hearing and maybe I wanted to laugh at something.  There was one long dragged out scene where Steenburgen taught Parker to shoot.  It was long , way too long and short on humor.  I kept wondering why Elliot who was there didn't try to teach Grant to shoot.  Elliot was a marshall so he was trained to shoot.  There was the tossed in idea that this was Elliot's last job, why it was there I have no idea.

Of course the bad guy finds them and comes after them.  This is not unexpected, after all this is bad wrilting 101.  The climax, dare I say that, was at a rodeo.  Excuse me, my wife is telling me that there was no climax.  Hmmm I think she is right!  Two people in  a mangy cow suit is not a climax.  Especially when the bad guy is hit in the head with a horse shoe, but this is the West.

The minor characters got thier names in the credits but they were not that noticeable in the movie.  The town of Ray Wyoming was given the quick sterotypical cliche whitewash, thus robbing it of any charm it may have had.

The ending, well it sucked! Grant and Parker adopt a Chinesse baby and she get pregant by Grant and live happy ever after in New York.  The thing is the one point that the movie was making was that these two found happiness away from New York and that they finally began to love Ray, Wyoming and this led me to think they would go back there to lilve.  Stupid me, I forgott about bad wrilting 101.

One last thing, we saw the movie Killers starring Ashton Kructer[spelling?]  and he and that mvoie were 10 times better than this.  Oh my god what is happening to movies?",1276387200,3,3229,4.173701298701299

The first thing that you should do after witnessing a murder is contact your plastic surgeon, so that they can alter your face, bleach your skin and surgically elongate your legs. Unfortunately, the separated couple in this rom-com decided to go to the authorities instead.

While on a reconciliation date, Paul and Meryl Morgan (Hugh Grant and Sarah Jessica Parker) bare witness to a homicide. Forced into witness-protection, they must flee NYC and hideout in Wyoming. Under the protection of local law enforcement (Sam Elliott and Mary Steenburgen), the Morgans must adapt to rural life, which, in turn, helps rekindle their relationship.

More a fish-out-of-water tale than a murder mystery, the killer chasing the Morgans is merely there to move along the romantic plot line, which is predictable and pedestrian.

Which is sort of major as I tend to depression and usually movies which were made recently have a tendency to make my depression worse.  One thing though, they're both cheaters (yes, in the adultery sense), but that is to be expected from the characters within almost every modern romantic comedy, it seems (a sign of the times maybe?).

Another big problem with the movie is after seeing movie trailers for it, I felt like I had seen it before. My friends said the same thing. The movie is also REALLY slow. Every good laugh was shown on the commercials, and its a long way between laughs.

The overall formula is standard and the movie genre is well sneaked out. Yet it is the actors, their interaction and the small story twists that make this an exception of its type. Hugh uses his three expressions just at the right time. Moreover, tossed in the mix, as a catalyst is Kim Shaw as the local nurse, waitress, and deputy fire chief.

3839954,4,B0021L8UZS,"First, I just want to say that this film probably had some of the worst publicity campaigns of any film I've ever seen.  The trailers for this film did it no justice, told you absolutely NOTHING about what you would experience and really made this film look dull beyond belief.  I mean, I had no idea what this film was about and I didn't really want to.

Okay, now onto my review.

:-D

It looks like the response to this film was kind of all over the place.  It's a pretty even spread here from people who loathed it to people who loved it (and everywhere in between).  Personally, we were recommended this movie from a friend who told us it was hilarious.  I'm still a little baffled that this friend recommended this film, since my wife and I recently went through separation much like the one in the film (yes, I was guilty and yes, she was crazy) and so throughout the films first half I was extremely uncomfortable (lord, please don't let this start a fight), but I must say that the film is balanced very nicely and by the films end you have this warmth inside that validates the films dramatic touches.

No, this film is not hilarious, but maybe that's why I liked it so much.

I was telling my wife that one of the reasons I liked this film was that it didn't go the obvious route and make everything a slapstick gag.  There were many scenes in the film that very easily could have gone over the top (take the bear scene for instance) but instead of pushing it, this film likes to play it a little more controlled.  Yes, it's funny, but it's not so outrageous that your roll your eyes.  I thought the Bargain Barn scene was another nicely done comical scene (""A sweater for $9.99?!?!?"") that could have been overplayed but was edited nicely.

The film tells of a New York couple going through a separation after the husband has an affair.  It appears that they were having some troubles before the affair took place, and he desperately wants to make things work but she isn't so sure.  When they both witness a murder they are sent into witness protection and have to spend a week together, in the backwards baroness of Ray, Wyoming.

With no distractions, they find that they never really fell out of love.

I love Hugh Grant.  I'm not the biggest fan of Sarah Jessica Parker, but I have been known to enjoy her on occasion (`The Family Stone').  Here she feeds off of Grant beautifully (and visa-versa).  They really compliment one another.  Grant's wit is effortless and he really knows how to make any situation funny (""I will pay."").  The best part about their pairing though is that they make a really believable couple.  Despite the fact that the overall plot is predictable and VERY far-fetched, they make it work because you BELIEVE them.

Add to their aura the fact that the entire cast (which includes a snappy Elizabeth Moss from `Mad Men') is spot on in nearly every way and you have a surefire crowd pleaser that hits nearly every mark.

No, this is not the perfect comedy, and at times it can even appear to be too serious for its own genre, but in the end it was a satisfying and rewarding movie experience that both my wife and I thoroughly enjoyed.",1270771200,2,3176,4.451557093425605
3839955,3,B0021L8UZS,"My husband and I just got back from seeing ""Did You Hear About The Morgans"" and it was a cute movie but very predictable. Hugh Grant's acting is almost painful to watch. I had read somewhere that he actually doesn't like acting and it appears that way in this film. Sarah Jessica Parker acts the same way she does in Sex And The City. She isn't much for characterization. Sam Elliott and Mary Steenberger have smaller parts but they are the best thing about this movie. Both are superb actors and don't ""overact"" or ""overdramatize"" their parts. Overall it is a cute date movie and it's worth seeing but I can't give it more than four stars.

So, to pay for the fuel for his Aston Martin, Grant has to accept scripts that seem to have been written by machines.

I like Sarah Jessica Parker and despite the bad press and the back alley uplifting from Hugh Grant, I actually enjoy him as well.  I think the movie started out with an overused premise and the backdrop clich of a fish out of water.  It isn't a bad foundation and I am sure we will see many more movies with this as a building block, but this one fell far short, lacking any form of sincerity.

Paul Morgan, (Hugh Grant) and Meryl Morgan (Sarah Jessica Parker) are two New York City dwellers and they are having marital problems.  Do all marriages in New York City have problems?  They are out to dinner and are discussing their issues when they decide to go on a walk.  Inadvertently they see a murder and are shipped off to Wyoming in the witness protection plan.  None of these movies ever want you to participate in a witness protection plan.  They all seem to fail.

There are a few funny lines in the movie.  I actually did laugh a couple of times.  Most of the movie is awkward and superficial.  It seems like you are watching a bunch of people who actually do not believe they are really the characters they are playing.  It seems like everyone is simply going through the motions to collect a paycheck.  Hugh Grant plays the same character he has played close to twenty times now and he seems more tired and aloof than he does interesting and cute.  Whatever happened to that guy from Four Weddings and a Funeral?

I can't say that you absolutely shouldn't watch the movie but I can say that if you gave me a list of 100 movies it would probably be in the bottom 10.  I honestly do not know much about Elisabeth Moss but she was the highlight.  She was interesting and captivating in the few scenes she participated in, stealing my interest away from the highly overpaid stars.  I like a romantic comedy as much as the next guy but this movie was missing a couple of key ingredients.  Romance and comedy.

Again, I have seen fare worse but as far as entertainment purposes there are so many other things I would prefer doing besides admitting to seeing this movie.  The one glaring positive is the movie does make me want to watch another movie very quickly.  Just to wash this one from my memory.

The movie is cute in parts, like the fish out of water story with the city couple in the cowboy, gun-toting, rodeo loving horse town of Ray.

Clearly there is much to be desired in terms of the storyline in ""Did You Hear About the Morgans?"" The contrived premise about the witness protection program and a professional killer are just unnecessary. Though based on a lazy ""fish-out-of-water"" scenario and unoriginal ideas, the film still could have been watchable with more interesting characters, which the Morgans are not. Even the character played by Hugh Grant, usually a very reliable actor, is not as charming as he should be, and as to the Razzie-nominated Sarah Jessica Parker's irritating character, I rooted for the villain.

This is the third time Hugh Grant has collaborated with director Marc Lawrence. The first was ""Two Weeks Notice"" and the second ""Music and Lyrics."" They may not be the greatest film in the world, but at least the latter is much more delightful than ""Morgans,"" thanks to the considerable chemistry between Hugh Grant and Drew Barrymore. With romantic chemistry that is nowhere visible on the screen, ""Did You Hear About the Morgans?"" lacks the charms of their previous effort.",1269388800,,1456,4.963114754098361

It was saved a bit with the GOOD acting of Sam Elliot and Mary Steenburgen. and Bart the bear. So my opinion is, enjoy what there is, but not really a keeper title.

In an attempt to discuss their failed marriage, the Morgans sit down to dinner and unfortunately witness a murder which puts their lives in jeopardy.  Pathetically played police officers insist on sending the sad couple to the Big Sky of Wyoming to the welcoming arms of Mr. and Mrs. NRA---the ever hunky Sam Elliot and the winsome Mary Steenburgen (the only two members of the cast that can do anything right with a script that has little redeeming value)where Parker does her best to bemoan her New Yorklessness and Grant perpetually winces at her incessant and expected badgering regarding his infidelity.

UGH!  Of course, the villain figures out where they are thanks to the couple's mutually neurotic assistants and the small town residents rally to protect the Morgans aka the Fosters who they have come to regard as native sons in just one short week.

Parker and Grant have absolutely no chemistry; Grant's pained expressions get old fast as does Lawrence's attempt to work Parker's reputation as New York City's finest fashionista with a know-all iPhone toting zeal for her all-consuming career as real estate mogul with the mostess.  If I see her sporting another expensive cowboy hat a la the 80s, I think I will scream . . . no maybe just yawn.

Its not that the jokes aren't funny--given a better delivery they could have had the audience chortling enthusiastically as this pair from the urban jungle ineptly lands in a place where street smarts do not matter.

Bottom line? Marc Lawrence's romantic comedy ""Did You Hear About the Morgans?"" tries to be a scintillating spectacular of cutesy jokes delivered by Hugh Grant and deflected by the object of his affections, New York's poster gal, Sarah Jessica Parker.  Without the buoyancy of chemistry between the two leads, the only thing this flick has going for itself is rustic couple Sam Elliot and Mary Steenburgen whose down-to-earth cowboy stability and laid back sense of fun keeps this review from being a one star un-wonder. Not recommended.

3839989,5,B0021L8UZS,"Bigger than life, Hugh Grant dominated every scene in this fine film, making it one of the most powerful movies in which he has ever appeared.  Grant is absolutely masterful; even his prissy British stammering delivers theatrical impact reminiscent of a Lionel Barrymore, a Richard Burton, Sir Lawrence Olivier, Sir Alec Guinness.  The other actors were extremely fortunate:  Grant carried them thoroughly through every scene.  From straight drama (begging his estranged wife to return to him) to high comedy (spraying himself with bear repellent), Grant's tremendous abilities brought to mind another cinema giant named Grant..... Cary... though Hugh is already miles ahead of Cary.  After this watershed film, which was incredibly rich with plot layers, what can the future possibly hold for Hugh Grant?  Perhaps an action film.  Hugh Grant would be perfect in a Terminator-type role, exuding strength and physical presence -- he could even be the next Schwarzenegger, or Bruce Willis, or Vin Diesel.  Hugh Grant's future is limitless... he is literally a Film Immortal.",1269216000,,1072,5.377245508982036
3839990,1,B0021L8UZS,"I'm sure there are some who, for whatever reasons, will connect with this film and love it.  More will be moderately amused, perhaps a bit nonplussed, and then promptly forget almost everything about this unmemorable flick.  While I can't quite understand the first reaction, and while I can sympathize with the second since it's probably not worth it to get worked up about a movie, in what follows I only want to speak for my own experience, and why I found this film not only bad but obnoxiously so, to the point where it makes me cynical about Hollywood.  There are so many brilliant writers out there, and so many good actors, and so many filmmakers that have original visions and interesting stories that could be told about so many things that I have to find it sad this movie got funded and filmed by the studios.  Just take a look at the many wonderful independent and international films that play at Sundance or Cannes or Toronto, and then never really manage to play in the major theaters in America, because they are allegedly aiming at a narrow niche audience -- since when did excellent storytelling and powerful artistry become a niche market? -- but this one is as niche as it comes.

Somehow someone in Hollywood is convinced that a broad swath of the moviegoing public wants to hear stories about pampered, annoying, well-to-do city folk, on the brink of divorce, who somehow discover that they really do love one another after being put into a witness protection program in small town Wyoming, and also connect with good old town home American country values along the way?  More likely, someone is convinced that there's a fair market for Sarah Jessica Parker or Hugh Grant ""comedies"" and it doesn't matter whether they're any good.  I've seen a few of these ""fish out of water"" comedies about couples who reconnect when they (temporarily) lose everything, and this one has to be by far the worst.  Chock full 'o cliches and hamfisted delivery of life's lessons, it was painful to watch.  Like the moment when Sarah Jessica Parker's character  is searching for marriage advice from the reticent Sam Elliot, and misconstrues his advice about how to milk a cow as profound psychological insight.  Then, just to make sure the audience gets it, Parker's character points out that the advice is truly profound, and then spells out literally how what he said applies to her situation (something about breaking it to your spouse gently when you've cheated on them), and Elliot explains that he was really talking about the cow (something about pulling softly on the cow's teat so it doesn't kick you), but that he guesses you could take it both ways -- this film is a far cry from the screwball ""comedies of remarriage"" from classic Hollywood days when the writers expected their audiences to catch the puns and understand the double-entendres.  By the way, I don't begrudge Elliot taking this role, since he's sadly underused, and his character is one of the few things that makes this film semi-palatable.  Of course, nearly every little nugget of wisdom he utters in his gruff and sardonic manner turns out sounding profound, and has the merit of sounding smarter than almost anything said by the leading couple.  The worse thing was, this comedy just didn't manage to be funny.  For all they tried to milk comedy out of the incongruities of city folk in the country -- Hugh Grant gets his eyes sprayed by bear repellent ... twice!!!! -- I'd seen funnier variations of all of it many times before.

It's not just the bad writing, but I have to say Sarah Jessica Parker and Hugh Grant are pretty annoying to watch here.  They aren't acting, but pretty much just playing more incompetent and more insecure versions of the usual characters they play in just about everything they're in.  I've never much liked them in anything -- though Hugh Grant managed to play a few decent roles (e.g.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Four-Weddings-and-a-Funeral/dp/B00000JRTX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Four Weddings and a Funeral</a>&nbsp;and, maybe,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bridget-Jones-s-Diary/dp/B0002W4SWC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bridget Jones's Diary</a>) before he became a stereotype of himself (and then, maybe, one more in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/About-a-Boy/dp/B001VPJZ1S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">About a Boy</a>); and though I'm no fan, Sarah Jessica Parker managed to fit well enough in her role in the Sex and the City series -- but I can say in all honesty that I've never seen them much worse.  I'm pretty sure, at least, that Hugh Grant can't possibly be proud of what he accomplished with this role since he seems hardly to believe half of the sappy things he says, and seems genuinely embarrassed by the self-deprecating antics he has to go through this time around.  I don't usually write reviews of films I hate, since I'd much prefer to spread the word about under-appreciated but excellent indies and international films; in this case, after renting it with my wife I thought it was the least I could do to warn others against wasting two precious hours of their lives.",1269129600,,5244,5.17612293144208
3839991,2,B0021L8UZS,"DID YOU HEAR ABOUT THE MORGANS?

STARRING: Sarah Jessica Parker, Hugh Grant, Sam Elliot, Mary Streenburgen, Michael Kelly, Elizabeth Moss, Natalia Klimas and Vincenzo Amato

WRITTEN BY by: Marc Lawrence

DIRECTED BY: Marc Lawrence

Rated: PG - 13
Genre: Romantic Comedy
Release Date: 18 December 2009

There are far too many things wrong with Did You Hear about the Morgans? For starters, it's the oldest and most generic form of movie there is; a fish out of water, love story. Furthermore, its three act structure is as predictable as Seattle weather. That being said, let's get on with it.

Hugh Grant and Sarah Jessica parker star as - you guessed it - The Morgans. They are a married couple whose relationship suffers primarily from what Hugh Grant's marriage did in real life; his inability to keep it in his pants.

I'll admit I am not a Hugh Grant fan and that that could have played some part in me not loving this movie. I have seen him in films where he has brought some talent to the table, such as About a Boy. But here we get the Hugh Grant we are all too familiar with; the guy he's played countless times. He has a beautiful woman who loves him; he cheats on her and or takes her for granted, and then spends the remainder of the film trying to swoop her back into his arms with his `witty' humor. Ugh.

All of the above hold true for his character in this film, Paul Morgan. His wife Meryl (Parker) is a lot more enjoyable to be around, and you often wonder why she ever married him in the first place.

Paul has asked Meryl to go out on a dinner date with him, as they are separated and no longer live together. She agrees and we get to know the two of them and we enjoy a few mild laughs. After dinner, right out of left field, with no build-up at all - they witness a murder. Some might argue that it was supposed to be completely random and that's why there were no events leading up to this random turn in the film. In my opinion, if that was the director's intention, he failed miserably, as it just seems misplaced in the film altogether. We have no idea who the character is who is murdered, or why. He is just thrown out of a window by a creepy man, and Meryl mutters something about that being her client.

This sets up the whole movie and had it been done better, the film would not have suffered as badly as it did. We have no back-story for this bad-guy-killer and never learn who he is. I get that the point of this film is to focus on the relationship between Meryl and Paul. But if that's the route you want to take, you don't introduce a murder plot!

The two are placed in protective custody by the U.S. Marshals. They will be sent off to the small town of Ray Wyoming; thus being the classic fish out of water. Meryl all but resists going as she is a New Yorker and would sooner be killed, than live in a small town.

They arrive and discover they will be living with another married couple, who are undercover U.S. Marshals. Sam Elliot and Mary Streenburgen (who seems to be in just about every movie anymore), play their hosts: Clay and Emma Wheeler. Naturally the Wheelers couldn't be any different from the Morgans. They are trigger happy country-folk who live in the sticks and don't own cable; they watch nothing but John Wayne and Clint Eastwood movies.

From there things somehow get more ridiculous, as we see everything coming from a mile away. It's almost like the writer and director (Marc Lawrence) wants us to know what's coming. He has Hugh Grant holding up bear repellent spray I don't know how many times, and he has him read bear warning signs more than once as well. Can you say foreshadow?

Needless to say, the one-dimensional villain finds the Morgans and makes trouble for them in the third act. I would like to point out that the guy, who plays him (Michael Kelly), is at least a great actor. Kelly has a bright future ahead of him, if he can manage to steer clear of roles in bad movies like this.

I'd also like to point out that just because I'm a dude, doesn't mean I don't appreciate `chick flicks.' I have enjoyed several of them, to include Two Weeks Notice; which had Hugh Grant in it as well, and was also written and directed by Marc Lawrence. I would just rather watch a romantic comedy that is unique and has some brains in the screenplay, like Along Came Polly or Serendipity. The people acting in this film were funny, but the things that happened to them were not.

Had it not been for Sam Elliot and Mary Streenburgen's classic chemistry; and Sarah Jessica Parker's terrific performance, the movie would have fallen flat on its face. Parker is one of the best actresses in Hollywood and she plays her character brilliantly - it's just too bad she didn't have more to work with.

There are a few more laughs that we enjoy later on in the film as well; but I can't help but feel it would have been better off having Sarah Jessica Parker being sent to Wyoming alone and interacting with Elliot and Streenburgen. Notice how I didn't mention a part for Hugh Grant?",1269129600,,5035,4.385193133047211
3839992,4,B0021L8UZS,"Watch purely for entertainment--it's well worth a rental,& perhaps purchase. For Sara Jessica Parker & Hugh Grant fans, it's right up your alley. It's funny, even though the situation they find themselves in is a bit off-the-wall. The Wyoming setting is great and used well in applying situations for the couple to re-find themselves. Yes, it's a romance/comedy with a very nice romance HALF that those types of movie lovers will find worthy of 5-stars. The comedy is great also, including even some of the outtakes, and special features, including a bear episode with Hugh Grant getting as close as it takes. By the way, SUBTITLES ARE AVAILABLE.

It's not going to become a ""classic"" or talked about in years to come, or produce a great number of movie spin-offs. However, after you see the outcome, such a delightful finish, you will perhaps wish for a sequel of say, 15 years later, and see how the relationships are going, and a reunion back with Sheriff Clay Wheeler (Sam Elliott)of Ray, Wyoming, and his packin' wife, Emma (Mary Steenburgen). I really loved that pair and their part in the witness-protection-home-away-from-home. Even some western horsin' around for the horse loving viewers.

It's rated PG--meaning Pretty Good entertainment for the family. Not much violence, no blood, no heavy sex, although the stars are considered sexy, and all the other things that most movie makers seem to think necessary to make a film entertaining. This is one to just give you a fun evening in front of the telly with a home-spun bowl of popcorn and perhaps with luck, beside a significant other. Bottom line-----buy it, rent it, borrow it, whatever works, just don't overlook it. IT IS GOOD ENOUGH FOR AN EVENING OF ENTERTAINMENT.",1269129600,45,1732,4.948453608247423

3839994,3,B0021L8UZS,"As many people have pointed out, this movie is basically a remake of several movies that do the city-slickers-on-a-witness-protection-program-in-the-middle-of-nowhere theme. Of course we all know that romantic comedies are going to recycle plot elements and themes, so that in and of itself isn't a bad thing. However, in the case of this movie, it seems like almost everything was done half-heartedly. The movie has some impressive lead actors who do a pretty decent job of acting. However, it seems like this movie falls prey to the same thing that plagues a lot of romantic comedies. It tries to pile up stock scenes without putting much thought or effort into them. In the case of this movie it leads to the viewer not caring too much about the characters because there isn't much effective back story or buildup to many scenes. Hugh Grant can be an excellent actor for romantic comedies, but in this one, his trademark style seems totally out-of-place. There doesn't seem to be much chemistry between him and Sarah Jessica Parker. You are left wondering how they ever got together and what they really see in each other. The one thing that can be said about the movie is that it does not have too many embarrassingly bad scenes of the type that make you cringe. Most of the scenes involving cultural differences or misunderstandings are done in a mild way which doesn't seem outlandish. If you like Hugh Grant or are a fan of romantic comedies, you might want to check this one out, but it probably won't be a very memorable movie or end up high on your list of favorites.",1269043200,,1577,4.738181818181818
3839995,3,B0021L8UZS,"If you have seen ""For Richer or Poorer,"" from 1997 with Tim Allen and Kirsty Alley, you can skip this one. If do decide to what this updated version, let me set your expectations so that you will not be dissapointed. A couple, Sarah Jessica Parker and Hugh Grant, on the verge of divorce, witness a murder thus forcing them to go into the witness protection program. In the Tim Allen Kirsty Alley version they are running  from the IRS. Tim and Kirsty hide  in Amish country; Hugh and Jessica flee to Wyoming instead. In Ray Wyoming, the pair meet Sam Elliot, a Marshal and Mary Steenburgen, his wife; as the two Marshals who will watch over the fighting couple. Parker plays the role rather blandly. As the movie slowly progresses, my wife and I wished for the original version. Hugh Grant, on the other hand, playing the penitant husband, a man who cheated on his wife; plays the part with some conviction. I believe Hugh is sincere in this part, probably due to the real-life experience that he brought to the each scene.

I don't have any issues with remakes or even re-imaginings of a movie. However, if the remake does not build on the characters or the plot of the original, giving the audience more the second time around, I see this remake as a waste of time. I watched this movie with my teen-aged kids, and they laughed at all the correct places. Why not, this story line has worked before. The laughed when Hugh Grant deals with a large brown bear. The laughed during the horse riding sequence when Sara is chasing her horse - cute. My wife and I felt strongley that the after a decade later, Hollywood's remaking this romantic comedy for a newer generation, could have been better spent re-releasing the original, dated as it is.",1269043200,,1742,4.559105431309904

Admittedly, the clarity was solid for the New Mexico countryside (yes they chose to snub Wyoming - where this ""takes place"") but the sound was hit and miss. Quite a few falters for a DTS soundtrack, but the behind the scenes revealed the cabin set to be a fake, and every driving scene was painfully obvious as a set, so those flubs made sense. The supplements are thorough and in HD for a typical Sony release, and usually I list them one by one - but these were some of the most self-serving extras I have ever come across and do not deserve a listing.

The first one to avoid I actually screened for a volume of customers and it was overwhelmingly voted as barf material - the Stars of DYHATM. Each person actually sat down (even the great Same Elliott) to brag for what seemed an eternity about how wonderful and amazing everyone is, repeatedly and then some more. The fashion supplement (apparently a staple for any SJP film) was forgettable, and if you actually watch all of the supplements (and how Hugh Grant speaks of the industry) you have a fair idea how the commentary went. The Movie IQ was the standard IMDB on screen. The only supplement worth watching is the few minute bear extra - the bear had the best acting in the film and appeared to have more fun than the actors did.

I really hate the undertones to the whole thing. Why can't adoption be a good enough ending.  I was so happy to see that they chose to put adoption in the movie but they ruined it with what they assume is the happier ending with her getting pregnant.  The whole thing bothers me a lot.  It is a disservice to aodption.  It may sound crazy but I know how people are influenced by movies.  Infact as an adoptive mother I've heard the phrase ""just adopt and you'll get pregnant"" enough times I can't even count.

When he's got a good script and a good leading lady, he is unbeatable.  His ABOUT A BOY is just one example of his performing at the top of his game.  Nick Hornby was the writer on ABOUT A BOY though and he is first rate.  The screenwriter of this film is no Nick Hornby.

They are married but separated yet it is quite obvious they will be getting back together.  That's the whole movie.  I can't say don't watch it because Grant is funny.  He does the most with what he's got.  The rest of the movie though is (thankfully) completely forgettable.

This is such a delightful movie and contains no deep message but is a humorous way to spend a couple of hours. This will not win an Oscar, but will give a ton of laughs.",1267660800,2,310,3.859375

But Two Weeks' Notice (yes, there should be an apostrophe in there, thank you) also featured a very good Hugh Grant.

Not only was that a winning comedy, it also served as a great primer on the creative process.  Moreover, it featured a pitch-perfect Easter Egg: the video-within-the-movie that harkens back to Grant's character's Andrew Ridgeley-like existence as ""the other guy"" in a Wham-like pop rock super-nova.  That confection was the creation of a genius.  [The song - 'Pop Goes My Heart' - can stand toe-to-toe with any hit from that early-80s era.]

By contrast, 'Morgans' is a weak outing for both Lawrence and Grant.  The script is a dud.  Grant and co-star SJP accidentally oversee a murder and are forced into a Witness Relocation Program.  That's a highfalutin cover story for the basics of Lawrence's story: a sort of 'Cranky Blue Staters go to Red State and find life is different, but ultimately not too bad' narrative.  The big problem is obvious: zero chemistry between Grant and SJP.  [How were these two characters ever attracted to each other?]  And the story's resolution is insipid:  Sam Elliot.  Horseshoe.  Bulls-eye.  I mean, come on.  Leslie Nielsen, maybe, in full-on Frank Drebin mode.  But Sam Elliot? No.  And stop calling me Shirley.

This movie is a low point for Hugh Grant.  He needs to aim higher.

That's the level of performance Hugh Grant is capable of reaching.  He needs to make more choices like 'Boy.'  I'm sure he fields the offers.",1267142400,2,2754,6.660112359550562
3840004,3,B0021L8UZS,"This film is a solid three-star, middle-of-the-road film. Adequately entertaining, charming and amusing in some spots and predictable and annoying in others.

I viewed it with four twenty-something girls. They all liked it better than I did and thought it was funny and sweet and all thought that the negative reviews were overdone.

The negative reviews I've heard were mostly about the lack of spark between the Morgans, Paul and Meryl. I thought Grant (Paul) and Parker (Meryl) did okay with the subject matter. Not great, but okay. For starters, this isn't a cutesy chick-flick where boy meets girl, they fall in love, one of them does something stupid or misreads the other followed by the sweet scene that pulls them back together when they discover they can't live without each other. This is a film that deals with a very broken marriage with some pretty hefty issues. The lack of spark was understandable the first half or so of the film. The issue for me was the quick resolution and some roller coaster emotional backlash. Didn't quite make sense and the challenges faced by the couple kind of sucked the funny potential out of it.

Beyond the relationship issues is a life and death plot and the secondary characters. Neither made the film a must see either. Again there are moments of attention grabbing or humor, but moments of blah to frustrating, too.

The film was pretty clean, with a few curse words and a bit of sexual conversation. Mild stuff for the most part. If you love one or the other of the actors, you will probably want to see it. I'd recommend a Red Box rental before buying. If you need a fun chick-movie, this one could scratch some itches, but again, you might want to give it a rent before buying.",1266969600,,1732,4.668852459016393
3840005,5,B0021L8UZS,"I honestly don't understand all the negative reviews. I thought this movie was incredibly hilarious and had a great plot. Grant and Parker star as a couple named Paul and Meryl Morgan who are on the verge of divorce. After having dinner, they witness a murder and become new targets for the killer. They are forced to relocate to Ray, Wyoming where nothing too much happens. They take refuge in the home of the Wheelers. The Wheelers show Paul and Meryl how to shoot a gun. While hiding out from the killer, who is hot on their trail, the Morgans begin to rekindle their love. I highly recommend DID YOU HEAR ABOUT THE MORGANS?!!!",1265846400,12,630,4.535087719298246
3840006,1,B0021L8UZS,"Really, a big disappointment.
 Hugh Grant is a master of the romantic comedy. What's he doing here? What possibilities did he see in this script?
 Sarah Jessica Parker, a veteran actress, is completely miscast as the love interest. No sparkle betwwen her and Mr. Grant.
 Same is true for Mary Steenburgen and Sam Elliott. They don't gel as a couple.
 Bottom line. This movie is not funny. Proven actors with stale dialogue and a weak storyline.
 You don't care what's happening or what's going to happen. You can't identify with the characters. That's a harsh condemnation of the script. But, if Sam Elliott can't get a rise out of you, somethings wrong.
 A case of a great ensemble acting bored and then boring their audience.
 A shame.
 One star for Elizabeth Moss who had the sparkle and the wit. Unfortunately, to no avail.",1264636800,5,827,4.734265734265734
3840007,4,B0021L8UZS,"I'm not a huge Hugh Grant fan, but I do normally enjoy his movies. I'm also not a huge Sarah Jessica Parker fan, but I often enjoy her films as well.

What I like about this one is that, in spite of utter predictability, Grant is given so much humor to put out there in his lines. It's a dry, British humor that sometimes had me snorting laughter. He almost always is saying something funny in this film. I must admit that I'd want to bonk him on the head if he were my husband, tell him to please, for crying out loud, take SOMEthing seriously, but as an audience member, I really enjoyed how his character was always ""on.""

The plot is laughable: Grant and Parker are the Morgans, a city-dwelling and sophisticated separated couple who, on the night they have what the husband hopes will be a new start to their relationship in the form of a dinner where they can actually talk about the reasons for their separation and how to get back together, end up witnessing a murder that causes them to ultimately enter witness protection. Together. In a rural town. Being guarded by an utterly-countrified Sam Elliot and rifle-toting Mary Steenburgen.

There's nothing about the plot that really stood out in an exceptional way. It proceeds rather predictably, and there were times when I just rolled my eyes at what was happening on screen. However, Grant's humor kept grabbing me, and in the end, I considered myself pleased with having gone to see this one at the theatre.

Don't expect something incredible or heart-wrenching. Just go for some laughs and smiles.",1262995200,7,1560,4.641304347826087
