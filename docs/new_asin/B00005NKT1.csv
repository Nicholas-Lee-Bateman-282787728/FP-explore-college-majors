1634442,3,B00005NKT1,"This movie is entertaining enough to hold your interest.  I purchased it to show my students who are deaf, but to my dismay- there is no closed captioning!  This is unacceptable!  They make a movie with an actress who is deaf and then they don't caption the DVD for other individuals who are deaf to be able to access the content?!  I was very disappointed- and very tired-  after I had to interpret the entire film for my class.  I hope the ""powers that be"" will remedy this soon.",1208736000,11,481,4.348314606741573
1634443,5,B00005NKT1,"Take a murder and throw in deafness, old flames, jealousy, maintaining a perfect trial record---and you've got a good movie.  That this movie does.
A deaf witness, a jealous, ambitious wife of son of Senatorial candidate, potential funds comingling, old romance between Prosecutor and Defense Attornies-- makes one think all the time at potential subplots and outcomes.
For sure I was into the wife of Russ doing the murder, but knew that was too obvious---it had to be someone else.  Won't begin to give that away for those who haven't yet seen.  Ending was surprise that took me off guard.
Acting was good all around.  Martin is excellent.",1083801600,20,641,4.907407407407407
1634444,5,B00005NKT1,"I saw this movie on Lifetime TV and I would have never guessed that the ending would have been so unexpected.  I can't wait for this movie to come out on video.  All I have to say is that you need to watch this movie.  Marlee Matlin is as convincing as can be.  This movie will keep you on the edge of your seat.  Regina King, who you may have seen in ""Jerry Maguire"" as Cuba Gooding Jr.'s wife, is fantastic in this movie as a lawyer.  She is one to watch!",996105600,13,457,3.9130434782608696

7947340,1,B00005NKT1,"I actually love this movie, since it shows a Deaf woman being very smart and savvy.  However, because it is not closed-captioned, I only give it one star.  I was very disappointed when I received my copy of the DVD to find that there were no captions...which means I can't show it to my Deaf students, or understand it myself (I first saw it on TV with captions).",1386892800,8,363,4.323529411764706
