But perhaps this show has opened my eyes to a side of the man I was unaware of.  Among a gaggle of defeatists on the French General Staff, the general stood alone.  He wanted to continue the fight, which he did ultimately from London.  Granted, DeGaulle was a royal P.I.A. for the Allied leaders, but he did much to keep the French public on track for the ultimate defeat of the Nazis. The film is in French with English subtitles. I must say that the actor portraying Churchill pretty well nails it: not over playing the popular stereotypes but offering a well-balanced depiction of this towering historical figure.  My only complaint is that it is a rather short movie.  I hope there will be a follow-up to complete the rest of the story.  Highly recommended.",1376524800,6,895,4.54375
