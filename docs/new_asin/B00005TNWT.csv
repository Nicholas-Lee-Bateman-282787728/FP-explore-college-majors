7953696,2,B00005TNWT,"I usually avoid aerobic-type videos, as I prefer to use my recumbent bike for cardiovascular workouts.  However, I was looking for something I could do occasionally as a change of pace, and I thought that this Tai Chi-inspired workout might fit the bill. Unfortunately, this was not the case, and after repeated attempts to try to like this video, I eventually got rid of it.  The main thing that I didn't like was the recurring ""take it from the top""--ie, instructor Petra Kolber introduces new movements one by one, and then you go back to the beginning and perform the whole series...over and over again.  The repetitions were so numerous that I found myself getting bored, and the series got so long that it was hard to remember all of the movements. This workout also requires a very high tolerance for new age-y type thinking, as almost every movement has an associated visualization (eg, reaching for clouds). I recently tried another Tai Chi-inspired workout, Tantric Toning, which I liked much better, as the movements were more varied and interesting and the entire workout felt less new age-y.  Petra was a good overall instructor, but her style of teaching long series of movements with frequent repetitions is definitely not for me.",1082332800,7,1245,4.914285714285715
7953697,5,B00005TNWT,"As a daily exerciser that is easily bored, I have several different types of videos from the heart-pounding step aerobics, to ball workouts for the abs, to ""dancey"" fun workouts to keep things fresh and keep me motivated. My sister turned me on to this one and I thought, ""Huh, I like Petra but how can a video be both invigorating AND relaxing?"" Well, it is.....The movements are fluid and you never stop, the workout is no-impact,meaning that there is no jumping around and jarring the joints) yet you do get your body moving and you do feel as though you've gotten a nice little workout when you are done. The moves are concise and easy to follow yet not boring for the veteran exerciser. This is the one I look for when I am not overly motivated because I know I will have a good workout and have that great relaxed feeling at the end (probably from doing all that proper, full lung breathing). So, if you are in need of something fresh, dare I say....fun (or as fun as working out can be)...give it a go....you'll be pleasantly surprised...and aren't you about due for a little variety?",1022284800,17,1091,4.4874371859296485
7953698,4,B00005TNWT,"The review I read on this tape in a magazine said this wasn't technically an aerobic tape.  They lied or maybe they meant the tape itself isn't aerobic.  This is a major cario tape for me.  I do practice Tai Chi and Yoga and was looking forward to a combination tape.  If that is exactly what you are looking for this tape isn't for you, but if you want a good cardio workout with some moves from Tai Chi and some balancing from yoga, this is a great 45 minute run for your money.",1020384000,9,480,4.074468085106383
