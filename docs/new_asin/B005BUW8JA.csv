4648000,1,B005BUW8JA,"If you don't believe in Reincarnation, the adopted son death is tragedy.

If you believe in reincarnation and karma, then the adopted son was reborn as a baby for the wife.
Her pregnancy is considered a miracle.  Everyone got what they desire.  The wife got her own son.  The ex-husband got his freedom.  The adopted son finally got to be a real son.  No more dysfunctional family and no more lies.  The adopted son death is the key for new beginning.

4648071,4,B005BUW8JA,"This Korean film as are other Korean films available on Amsazon Prime is really done well. Over a very short time period many Korean films have been viewed besides this one. It as are the others is technically proficient with lush, flawless cinematography. As those viewed are (so far) so as A Good Lawyer's Wife is an apparent outcome of a well written screenplay. Made greater by adding to each screenplay, as is no different the case with  A Good Latwer's Wife, is a cast of actors who demonstrate exceptoinal skill at his and her craft. Korean film making quality matches, and in some cases exceeds, American independent film making. That is not to say among Korean flims there are the presence of real cinematic stinkers To date among those Korean fillms offered by and can be viewed on Amazon Prime video streaming is hardly a one that meets merited disapproval no matter who the reviewer. So true the pithy adage that art, as is beauty, is in the eye of the beholder. By that adage then gets many writers of negative reviews of Korean films off the hook. Yet to assess Korean films, as to assess A Good Lawyer's Wife, on their technical merits and those evident, demonstrated feats of cinematic craft and using that criterion and many aspect of it as a standard of assessment then objectively it would be difficult to write a creditable negative review about most Korean films available on Amazon Prime. That said suggests an availablity of quality Korean films among them most definitely would be A Good Lawyer's Wife. Having time to spare would allow anyone to cue up A Good Lawyer's Wife or any other Korean film. Once cued up then sit back and have a good visual read.",1436486400,,1679,4.653198653198653

4648309,4,B005BUW8JA,"The movie is good but the lawyer is not. The story revolves around a married man who is a lawyer of some renown in his district. Like many men of power he has a mistress and his wife is disaffected. He goes about his business and one night when he's with his mistress an accident happens which changes both of their lives' forever. The wife, who is he dancing instructor, fills her time with their son and her business. One day the neighbor boy comes on to her and tries to seduce her to no avail. They strike up an unlikely friendship as both have difficult family situations; the wife with her cheating and distant husband, and the teen with his overly strict and distant father.  The wife and teen seek solace in companionship with each other, seeing that they are kindred spirits. The teen keeps brazenly trying to score with the older, beautiful woman who is way out of his league and she keeps thwarting off his advances until it just happens. The teen is nearly out of high school and has been telling her how worldly he is. When it all comes down to it he is just clueless.

The poster lead you to believe it is is more of a sex-filled tale that it is, though there some of that. There is plenty of male nudity, though none of the female perspective (disappointing as So-ri Moon is enticing). This is not a happy ending film and not one that I would watch if I were in a sad mood. It is an interesting tale nonetheless.",1426118400,17,1427,4.32089552238806
