5715962,5,B00CD45JCU,"If you have early seasons of Matlock it is interesting to see how it had evolved by the last season.  Matlock stories changed with the times, but Matlock remained in character.  Andy Griffith was a constant in American television from Mayberry to Matlock.  I miss him.",1456617600,7,268,4.782608695652174

5715964,5,B00CD45JCU,"I have always been an Andy Griffith fan, but I opted to watch another show when Matlock aired on television.

5715966,4,B00CD45JCU,"For me at least, as the Matlock series progressed, the stories got a bit weaker.  I don't care much for the family related comedy in the later shows.  But, still, it is Matlock and Andy Griffith does a fine job.  I have the entire series and it's a keeper.",1441843200,,256,4.183673469387755

5715995,1,B00CD45JCU,"We love all the Matlock series and have been slowly plugging through them. As we started this one, the final one, the DVD itself will not play - it skips, pauses or just gets stuck on the opening legal disclaimer - all of the DVD's in the set are doing this. As we were taking our time and enjoying the series, the return policy expired so I cannot even return/exchange it.  Disappointing. Shoddy product.",1403136000,2,405,4.472972972972973

5716002,5,B00CD45JCU,This series of Ben Matlock is my most favorite.  I watched all his series on TV until for some dumb reason they quit showing them. It's not the same with Ben. He's a terrific actor and I love the stars that are with him on his shows. Nothing is more entertaining in my personal opinion. I miss him.,1389052800,4,298,4.137931034482759

5716005,5,B00CD45JCU,"Some long-running series peter out at the end, so my husband and I hesitated to watch this one, but we couldn't resist. I am so glad we did. It was fun right up to the ending credit of the last episode. We loved the characters and the stories, so it was hard to let them go, but every last one was a delight.

5716019,4,B00CD45JCU,The set matches the previous sets. The only complaint I have is not against the product itself but rather the TV executives of the time.  What would be the final episode is a pathetic end to a fantastic series.,1376784000,7,210,4.384615384615385
5716020,3,B00CD45JCU,"In my own Opinion, I would have to say that this Finial Season of Matlock, it's ok, BUT, it Isn't Nearly as Good as the First { 1st } Eight { 8 } Seasons, in my own Opinion.  Also, I myself Don't care for the way the Network had Ended the Series, in my own Opinion, I think that they could have done a Better Job in the way they had Ended the Series, but that's Strictly my own Opinion, and I can ONLY Speak for Myself, I Can't Speak for Anyone Else, I can ONLY Speak for myself.",1376179200,3,479,3.8383838383838382

5716025,5,B00CD45JCU,"Over the last few years I'm been acquiring the Matlock series either by pre-order or shortly after they came out. It's a great classic courtroom drama series (Perry Mason seasons are also - and the final season of that comes out soon). Both of these courtroom drama series are from times when TV had shows with ""G"" ratings and relied on good acting and good plots rather than most of the violent, sexual and political agendas of today's shows most of which are rated TV-14 or higher - not exactly wholesome viewing",1374451200,20,514,4.5978260869565215

But then I moved to the boonies and I didn't have satellite service for a while, I decided to purchase the Matlock DVDs and I have loved them. I got season one from Walmart for a steel and I was hooked! I always loved Andy Griffith and I used to watch the reruns of The Andy Griffith Show when I was a kid. I loved him in this because he still has the quintessential Southern charm that he's known for and the sharp wit. Plus, he's playing the role of a very smart attorney and I'm a sucker 4 crime shows, detective shows and shows about law. Watching the final season made me think about what a treasure Andy Griffith was. I also loved seeing his interactions in the earlier seasons with the other actors like Kene holiday and Clarence Gilyard,jr.",1507680000,,818,4.283870967741936
