8018253,2,B0001YAUF0,"Still unavailable on DVD, the first entry in Columbia's ""Jungle Jim"" series (1948-55) is far from the best. A decided comedown from Johnny Weissmuller's Tarzan adventures, this dialogue-heavy installment only emphasizes the swimming star's limited acting ability. Sam Katzman's cheapjack production values (stock footage galore!) result in some unintentional laughs. Worth a look for the memorable villainy of George Reeves  three years before his iconic debut as Superman.",1525996800,,473,5.955882352941177

This story is based on the newspaper comic strip (now defunct). The Commissioner bans a scientist from visiting a strange land, except at her own risk. She wants the best guide, that is Jungle Jim. The small boat is upset by hippopotami who attack the rowers! A black panther prowls, monkeys climb trees. Jungle Jim follows this scientist to save her from the panther, and kills it with his bare hands without suffering from a scratch! Then he swims in the lake. [No use of firearms?] This scientist is an Anthropologist who regards this land as a laboratory. An arrow brings a message to Jungle Jim for a meting with The Old One. A hippo attacks the canoe! [A long body looks like a crocodile to hippopotami.] Jungle Jim dives in to attack and kills this fake hippo in the river!

Photos of a monkey pad out the story. There is a cliffhanger event. Jungle Jim arrives with Miss Roberts. Commissioner Kingston asks for Jungle Jims help against the ivory hunters. He wants to rescue the elephants, but needs to visit the land of the Giant People. Jungle Jim refuses. Later he sees ivory hunters carrying tusks into a cave. Jungle Jim follows, there is a fight. The stolen tusks are recovered. There is a warning about the unrestricted killing of elephants, else they can become extinct. The Giant People can threaten the people of the jungle. Miss Denise suggests releasing the captives to follow them to their home. Miss Roberts shows her anthropometric skills. Whats his name? Miss Denise explains how three people can keep a secret.

Two Giant People are caged, but the male breaks out! [The make-up reminds me of werewolves.] They show monkeys fleeing in panic! The male Giant attacks Miss Roberts, Jungle Jim defends her. Miss Denise cooks up a deal with Zulu to slaughter the trapped elephants for their ivory. There is a conflict! Will the truth serum work on Jungle Jim? A leopard attacks a wart hog! Denise plans a frame-up of Jungle Jim for a murder. The Commissioner buys this story. At night Miss Roberts plans to free Jungle Jim. Will there be a problem? They escape! Can they spoil the plans of the villains? Or will they be charged with murder?

Jungle Jim and Miss Roberts travel to that Secret Pass. The elephants are being rounded up for slaughter. Those Giant People arrive, Denise shoots them. Jungle Jim and Miss Roberts escape. A dart gun stops two men. One speaks to the Commissioner. Can they prevent the slaughter of the elephants? A landslide works. There are shots, the Commissioner and his troops fight the natives and chase them away. Jungle Jim fights Doc, Denise takes Miss Roberts away. The Giant man attacks Denise, they take a great fall. And so there is a happy ending for the Good Guys.

This is a simple Good Guys vs Bad Guys story set in a jungle (that resembles southern California). It supports the preservation of wild animals against those who would slaughter them for commercial reasons. Wasnt this a good lesson for its audience? What was the purpose of having a woman as the leader of the villains?

I saw this on a local Sat. afternoon television broadcast. Yes, its not ""Savage Mutiny"" but its close enough",1417305600,,3197,4.689839572192513
