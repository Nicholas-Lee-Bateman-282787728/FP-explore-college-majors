2277473,4,B0009CTTZG,"When I was about ten years old in 1991 I fell in love with two black legends...Mahalia Jackson and Josephine Baker.

It is indeed a great joy to be able to see Josephine in action...to witness the star quality that enchanted people the world over and mesmerised fans for half a century.

I love Princess Tam Tam overall...The dance scenes are magnificent; the flexibility and lithe grace that Josephine possessed never ceases to amaze me. One critic said that she just had a few gimicks and shouldn't be considered a dancer but Josephine accomplished with her body what many are rushing to Juilliard to achieve today. She was able to combine ballet, acrobatics, jazz dancing and vaudeville comedic steps into one stunning whole. Some people were not moved by her singing either but her range was breath taking to me. Her voice was pristine and girlish...a soprano of exquisite beauty...

Josephine you were the true definition of DIVA!!!

The highlights of the film for me were her rendition of 'Dreams'...a lovely song that she sings; the camera gets a excellent closeup of her against the backdrop of a boat sail - showcasing her exotic good looks. And the dance scene at the end were she reveals her 'savage ways' to the French Gentry on stage at the Maharajah's party where she dances to 'Ahe, la Conga'. That scene particular keeps me on the edge of my seat.",1136073600,6,1363,4.738396624472574
2277474,4,B0009CTTZG,"Josephine Baker, born and raised in St. Louis, left the United States as a teenager to escape racial discrimination. She moved to France and in the mid-20s became the toast of Paris dancing and singing in the Folies Berge. Billed as the ""Black Venus,"" Baker wowed audiences with her provacative moves, especially her infamous ""banana dance."" And she made a few movies as well.

""Princess Tam Tam,"" filmed in Tunisia, is one of her better efforts. It is a Pygmalion-type story about a writer who takes an African vacation to escape his arrogant society wife. He and his collaborator seek inspiration to write a novel and they find it in an exotic native girl played by Baker. The writer decides to transform the girl into a princess and bring her back to France to make his wife jealous. The film is enhanced by Baker, whose personality shines through - it is easy to see why audiences were so enchanted with her. She gets to do two dance numbers - one inside a cafe and the other during an elaborate Busby Berkeley style number at the end of the film.

The extras on the disc inside a 20 minutes documentary which discusses three significant Baker films - ""Siren of the Tropics,"" ""Zou Zou,"" and ""Princess Tam Tam."" It includes interviews with Baker's adopted son, Jean-Claude as well as actress Lynn Whitfield (who portrayed Baker in the film ""The Josephine Baker Story""), NY Times theater critic Margo Jefferson and dance critic Elizabeth Kendall.",1124755200,13,1448,4.764940239043825
2277475,3,B0009CTTZG,"A long time ago, in the early days of the 20th Century, the Madonna of French society was a vivacious, exotic black singer/dancer named Josephine Baker.  Blessed with enormous eyes and an infectious smile, she starred in her 3rd movie, ""Princess Tam Tam"", in 1935. A French version of Pygmalion, ""Princess Tam Tam"" stars Baker as a wild African shepard, reformed(somewhat), and brought to Paris for exhibition. The story lacks momentum, but, in the end, Baker breathes life into the film. ""Princess Tam Tam"" is part of the Kino Josephine Baker DVD-trilogy. Kino's transfer includes a documentary, songs, and other generous extras. Once again, Kino is King.",1120089600,4,656,5.130841121495327
2277476,4,B0009CTTZG,"Although better filmed and better directed than Jospehine Baker's previous feature film, ""Zou Zou,"" this movie has less soulfulness and zest, and is more genuinely offensive, in terms of how it portrays a black woman's role in European society.  The premise is simple enough: it's a remake of Shaw's ""Pygmalion,"" this time with a French novelist going abroad to Tunisia and finding a new muse in the guise of the wild, uninhibited Alwina, a shepard girl who sings, dances and shoplifts her way through life.  Our Gallic hero takes her under his wing, transports her to Paris and passes her off as African royalty, training her in the finer points of civilized life, such as wearing shoes and not dancing the boogaloo in public, all the while making side comments about her wild native ways.  Sure, the film is a product of its time, and some degree of racism is to be expected, but we also have to be honest and admit that it gets in the way of enjoying this film, and helps define its central essence.  Also, it just seems more forced and predictable than ""Zou Zou,"" which in addition to a more interesting plot also had better performances from Baker.  Worth checking out, to be sure, but a little troublesome nonetheless.",1081123200,9,1224,4.700934579439252
2277477,4,B0009CTTZG,"Princess Tam Tam"" is one of only two talkies made by the legendary Josephine Baker. It is, in this viewer's opinion, the better of the two, and quite a delightful movie.
The story is reminiscent of ""Pygmallion:"" Awina (Baker), a Tunisian woman, is taken in by a pompous French writer and transformed from a street beggar to a ""cultured"" society matron. Said writer is only attempting to enrage his estranged wife and gather material for his next book, but he manages to convince Awina that he is enamoured with her. The wife, meanwhile, is carrying on an affair of her own. When the writer returns to Paris with his 'exotic new love,' the wife and her friends work to expose Awina as a fraud. As this is a musical comedy, all's well in the end, as both Awina and the author find success and happiness (apart!).
What makes ""Princess Tam Tam"" special is the manner in which it captures Josephine Baker's irrepressible and unique spirit. She has several opportunities to show off her inimitable and uninhibited style of dance, her fantastic sense of humour and her 'star power.' At the same time, the film is not merely a star vehicle: the storyline and supporting cast work well to create a film with some substance. There is lovely cinematography and some stunning views of the desert and Roman ruins (sections of the film were actually shot on location in Tunisia).
One criticism about this film is the quality of the English subtitling. The actual French dialogue is, in a number of cases, much richer and more entertaining than the sparse subtitles would suggest.",982281600,11,1565,4.757352941176471
8059053,4,B0009CTTZG,"This movie is all about Josephine Baker and her life story. Cleverly crafted into screenplay after its successful showing of the French musical Zou. She was the first black woman to star in a major motion picture, titled Zouzou (1934).

This is a French movie with English subtitles starring Josephine Baker as a Tunisian girl (Alwina) who is befriended by a French novelist named Max de Mirecourt. He casts her as a heroine of his future novel, and brings her into Paris and teaches her French manners and customs. His wife who is flirting with an Indian Maharaja is infuriated and seeks help from her friend to a plot a revenge against her husband and embarrass Alwina in front of the Parisian elite. But that plan backfires and at the end it all ends well. The author calls his new book Civilization. Ironically it demonstrates the racial bigotry of the early 20th century in European circles which was considered as a civilized behavior.

Baker became a renowned entertainer in Paris. She renounced her American citizenship to become a citizen of France who was fluent in both English and French. Baker refused to perform for segregated audiences in the United States and is noted for her contributions to the Civil Rights Movement. In September 1939, when France declared war on Germany in response to the invasion of Poland, Baker was recruited by Deuxi&egrave;me Bureau, French military intelligence, as an ""honorable correspondent"". She received the French military honor, the Croix de Guerre and was made a Chevalier of the L&eacute;gion d'honneur by General Charles de Gaulle.

The film closes with a scene of Alwina in Tunisia with her family in her farm. In the closing scene, a donkey eats the title page of ""Civilization"" off the floor. The movie reflects on part of her life in a racial divided society.",1479686400,,1818,4.896103896103896
8059054,3,B0009CTTZG,"The movie was a bit ""frantic"" at times, but the storyline overall was cute.",1457568000,,75,4.428571428571429

8059056,5,B0009CTTZG,"Wonderful acting and thought provoking work with the incomparable Josephine Baker and Jean Gabin. I used the film for teaching a course on Americans in Paris and for a course on French cinema. It really inspires discussion among students. Seems dated for the first few minutes, and then captivates...",1443139200,,300,5.142857142857143
8059057,3,B0009CTTZG,"There is only one possible reason to watch a Josephine Baker movie, and that, of course, is Ms. Baker.  In that context, this movie is a hoot.

Like a lot of people, I know a bit of Baker's history (the impoverished childhood, the fame of her middle years, her Rainbow Tribe, and her near-obscurity late in life); and something of her legend (the banana skirt and cheetah, to start).  But I hadn't really seen her perform.  The plots of all her movies seem nearly identical, and track the legend Baker wanted tell about herself.  In ""Princess Tam Tam"" that means she is an exotic Tunisian peasant girl who meets a French novelist, becomes the toast of Paris, and then gives all the wealth and glamour up to return to her native land.  If you're with us so far, you've suspended so much disbelief you don't even need the final plot twist, which takes a silly and sentimental story and makes it just silly.

But Baker's performance is worth it.  She was, after all, a singer and dancer, and in ""Princess Tam Tam"" she does both.  Her dance style is athletic at best, but her charm and charisma do come though; with her long limbs and big smile, you understand why she became a sensation.  What was surprising to me was how well she sang.  The ""Dream Ship"" number is nothing but a long, slow song (no costumes or dancing choruses here), which she does beautifully, and which comes across in the DVD restoration very nicely indeed.

As to the other performers and performances:  well, it was 1935, this is a French film, and the acting was in keeping with its times.  Plus, for English speakers it's subtitled and while the titles are serviceable, you do miss something.  (My French-speaking husband points out that comparing an English woman to a camel isn't flattering; although come to think of it, that doesn't sound too great in English, either.) Even given that, the movie is entertaining taken as a whole.  It runs 77 minutes, and while you won't be left wishing for more, you'll be entertained for the movie's full run time.

Why only three stars?  If you come to the movie already fond of Ms. Baker, or wanting to see more of her, then it probably rates higher.  If you want to see a work of serious filmmaking in the 1930s, forget it.  As a move, it's a good three-banger.",1412899200,,2277,4.534313725490196
8059058,1,B0009CTTZG,This film is classic and should be treated as such. The copy was  an insult to Josephine Baker. This video was not remastered and should be considered for future viewing.,1392422400,,170,4.666666666666667
8059059,3,B0009CTTZG,It's an old movie so subtitles are nencessary in the french speaking film noir.  Yet so interesting to look back at those times to see how different we really were not then as we are now.  Who I ask in this movie is the real snob?  Lol.,1366329600,,236,3.978723404255319
8059060,3,B0009CTTZG,"Funny French reply to English ""Pygmalion""-or own interpretation of the ancient Greek story,-this movie is of an African peasant of a ""Maharaja"" land (Maharaja was a tribe ruler title in India) turned into grand dame of Paris with learning her European rules of courtesy.

Probably, it was interesting for viewers of the pre-race-equity timing when being white was already a sign of prosperity somewhere in then ""developed"" world also acting and music are good as a general information of days passed could testify to the history real.",1319846400,,534,5.137931034482759
8059061,3,B0009CTTZG,"I used to think that no movies in the world beat 1930s-style Hollywood films--especially the ones featuring big musical and dance scenes--for sheer camp.  But after watching ""Princess Tam Tam,"" I realized that the French of the 1930s were pretty good at making movies so bad that, eighty-odd years later, their very badness makes them totally fun to watch.

""Tam Tam"" is formulaic, as one would expect:  debonair and worldly novelist is jealous of his wife, so he fakes a romance with a wild girl of north Africa--played by Josephine Baker--to make his wife jealous in turn.  Baker plays a street urchin whom the novelist pretends is a ""jungle"" princess and introduces to Parisian high society as such.  Predictably, the charade is exposed, but--also predictably--everyone lives happily ever after anyway.

There are some genuinely laugh-out-loud moments in the film.  The guy who plays the novelist's sidekick, a sort of Oliver Hardy character, is really a good comedic actor.  But for the most part the dialogue is strained and the editing is particularly bad.  Jumps between splices occur nonstop.

The film was made, one suspects, to give Josephine Baker a stage.  She'd made two earlier French films, the silent ""Siren of the Tropic"" and ""Zou Zou,"" a much better talkie in which she sings the song made famous by the later film ""Frida.""  But ""Tam Tam"" doesn't give Baker much of an opportunity to show her stuff.  She sings a couple of numbers, which is good.  But her two dance scenes are continuously interrupted by the camera panning the crowd of onlookers.  And Baker looks old and a bit tired in the film.  She tries real hard to be the vivacious and spirited gal that France fell in love with, but can't quite pull it off in this film.

So the film is pretty much an utter cinematic disaster.  But it's great fun to watch.",1221177600,4,1833,4.7834394904458595
8059062,5,B0009CTTZG,"Delightful musical comedy gives us a rare glimpse of Baker's powerful allure and talent, and projects a knowing, sophisticated light-heartedness reminiscent of director Ernst Lubitsch. On-location Tunisian scenery lends distinctive atmosphere, and the viewer is transfixed any time Baker sings or dances. Somewhat daring and different for the times, ""Tam-Tam"" provides an invaluable record of one of the last century's most celebrated entertainers.",1182384000,3,448,6.126984126984127
