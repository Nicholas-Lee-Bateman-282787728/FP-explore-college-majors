8608792,1,B00ERH136M,"This product is a 2 DVD set not endorsed by Avril Lavigne in any way. The first DVD comprises a collection of interviews that were probably ripped from YouTube, other web sites and even some cable channels.  As a result, their  image quality is short of atrocious. It seems that the average video resolution is 240p , and to add insult to injury, the original watermarked logos can easily be spotted.  The second DVD, in the other hand, although a little bit better, is formated in full frame, not anamorphic widescreen. It just looks terrible in widescreen TVs.

Bottom line: just avoid this thing!!!!",1387065600,2,602,4.759615384615385
8608793,2,B00ERH136M,"Save your money, this is a 2 DVD set, one is ""Skater Girl"" that has been out for a while and tells her story, but no Avril music and little Avril.  The other is a compilation of videos of interviews she has done, even with the new husband, undoubtedly available on line for free, on TV/Radio/Cable.",1386720000,4,298,4.321428571428571
8608794,5,B00ERH136M,"So now we review stuff that's not even out yet? I love Avril, but Man Man. How do I rate my need for this set? It's absurd. But, I do need this. I will have it, sooner or later.",1382140800,4,177,3.5641025641025643
8608795,5,B00ERH136M,"I love Avril Lavigne, always have, since she released her first album and single. Her vocals on each of her songs are just... amazing, and I need this. I don't care if it's a DVD or any kind of collector's box. I need it.",1379894400,6,221,4.045454545454546
8608796,2,B00ERH136M,"After ten years, it's no longer a compliment for your talent to be called ""raw"". I think her original fans would all like to see her talent a little more cooked by this time.",1379203200,,174,4.147058823529412
