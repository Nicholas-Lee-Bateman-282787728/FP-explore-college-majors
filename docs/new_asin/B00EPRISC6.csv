8608235,2,B00EPRISC6,"Picture quality is poor. Fuzzy with washed out colors. Sound is barely ok. In reality this is a sub-par DVD quality recording put on a bluray media, without any evidence of remastering whatsoever. The only difference between this bluray and a DVD are the 'features'. At least I got it cheap, so not much harm done.
Seller provided quick shipping, so kudos to them.",1488499200,,364,4.703125
8608236,3,B00EPRISC6,"This disc is described as being 'lovingly restored' and upgraded to Blu-ray format. In so doing the original 4:3 aspect has been changed to 16:9 in order to fill widescreen TVs. This is done by cropping but has been so carefully done that it is unlikely that anyone will notice unless making a direct comparison. There is no suggestion of cropping tops of heads etc. for example. The sound is presented in DTS 5.1 as well as stereo and is arguably better than one would expect from a stereo CD of the same age (1992). The reason is simply that the file size is bigger and allows more resolution.

The concert starts with a strikingly dramatic performance of Verdi's Force of Destiny overture. This is clearly caught by the sound engineers who have done a remarkable job in controlling the considerable echo properties of the building. That can be heard at the end of pieces or during longer pauses when the sound can be heard reverberating around different sections of the building - the aural equivalent of seeing multiple copies of strong rainbows! This effect is really only apparent in surround sound, does not interfere with the music making and adds performance atmosphere.

There follows an aria from Don Carlos sung well by Domingo who also delivers a good 'Invocation' in the later Berlioz item. That is preceded by rather a stately rather than exciting Hungarian March. The same stateliness is also a feature of the Schubert 8th symphony which receives what must be described as a very traditional performance, a far cry from modern 'period' practice. The choice of these slower speeds may be affected by the echo situation but is more likely to be a Barenboim choice.

The concert finishes in spectacular style with a large amount of Wagner. Domingo rises well to the challenges of Die Walkure and this is his best performance of the evening. It is preceded with an impressive Mastersingers overture and followed by extensive orchestral excerpts from the Ring cycle.  Barenboim had only just completed recording the whole of the Ring cycle, a recording that is frequently referred to as being very special even today, at the time of this concert and it is easy to sense his great empathy with the music. The orchestra respond magnificently and this makes for a memorable end to the concert.

It is a pity that the opportunity was not taken to provide subtitles for the vocal items but otherwise the production values of this disc are high.

On a technical note I would suggest that this disc demonstrates what can be achieved from pre-HD source material although it must be admitted that the broadcast SD image of 1992 falls well below that of today. It is therefore probably best to consider this as essentially archive quality as regards the imaging especially. The sound is technically better than the imaging.

Bearing that in mind, I would suggest that the disc offers much to be enjoyed on a musical and historical basis but purchasers looking for HD image quality are likely to be disappointed and probably ought to consider this very carefully and possibly give this disc a miss. The 1995 concert illustrates how far SD recording technology had moved in just a few years for example with far crisper imaging. By 2001 early forms of HD technology were starting to be used and from then on modern HD quality began to nudge into view.",1381190400,,3350,4.795493934142114
8608237,4,B00EPRISC6,"EuroArts is now dusting off older performances from the Berlin Philharmonic archives, updating their video and sound, and releasing them on Blu-ray. Included in this first batch are Europakonzert performances, which celebrate the orchestra's founding in 1882 --  including, in addition to this one,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Europakonzert-1994-Blu-ray/dp/B00EPRISLW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Europakonzert 1994 [Blu-ray</a>] and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Europakonzert-1998-Blu-ray/dp/B00EPRISQW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Europakonzert 1998 [Blu-ray</a>].

For me, this particular concert got progressively more interesting as it went along. The ""Forza Del Destino"" overture (an overdone concert piece if ever there was one), the ""Io l'ho perduta!"" aria from ""Don Carlo,"" and the ""Damnation of Faust"" march and invocation to nature are very professionally done, as one would expect from the participants. But Placido Domingo is a bit on the monochromatic side here and not at his considerable best. Daniel Barenboim and the orchestra follow this up with Schubert's Symphony No. 7, and it's a fine, elegaic performance.

Then comes Wagner, and this is where the energy level picks up considerably. It starts with the ""Meistersinger"" prelude and is followed by ""Wintersturme"" from ""Walkure,"" which Domingo really puts over. I've always appreciated Domingo's occasional excursions into Wagner. To my ears, his Mediterranean tone and legato make this music shine even more brightly.

Barenboim, a leading Wagner exponent, and the orchestra end the concert with very exciting excerpts from ""Gotterdammerung."" At the beginning, you might be forgiven for thinking that you've lost the picture signal, because all you see is white. Worry not. It's the director's attempt to put the stunning setting, El Escorial in Madrid, to creative use. Slowly, the focus is adjusted and the building's ceiling comes into view, as the camera twirls downward. It's effective, once you get past the initial blank period. At the end of the final piece, though, something goes very awry with the camera as an attempt is made to reverse the effect. Oh, well. It was worth a try.

Because this recorded performance predates HD, you might be curious to know how well it holds up in the upgrade to Blu-ray.

First, the image's original 4:3 aspect ratio has been cropped to 16:9 in order to fully fill your HD television screen, rather than resorting to vertical black bars on either side. Some purists might object, but don't count me among them. The reframing has been done with care, and you likely won't notice the adjustment. The 1080i image quality is several notches less sharp than that of recent Blu-rays, but there's only so much one can do with two-decade-old video source material.

The sound quality, now DTS 5.1 surround, is very good; only the lack of full transparency in the orchestral textures and more compressed dynamic range betray its age.

The bottom line: It's the best this performance will ever look and sound, and I'm grateful EuroArts decided to upgrade and release these older concerts.

I was provided with a review copy of this particular disc, although I've purchased many EuroArts discs (as well as those of other classical music labels) over the years.",1381017600,,3420,5.794820717131474
