7802761,5,6300128881,"I had been looking for this specific program from the 90's/early 2000's (I believe) for a long time. An interesting look into the social lives and ""The Season"" as it's called (Winter) of the very rich of Palm Beach, Florida. Narrated by actor James Woods with many interesting views and interviews with long time locals. Thanks Amazon! Not a large part but I had forgotten our President Donald Trump was shown in this and that he was credited with making the private Mar A Lago Club open to people of all religions and races after his purchase, whereas many private clubs there are still very discriminatory. Bravo President Trump!",1496448000,,631,4.798165137614679
7802762,4,6300128881,"As a previous buyer has mentioned, I think the price was excessive given the age of the information. However, the is clearly accuracy in the information given.  It is sad though that Palm Beach still lives in a Discriminating way.  The documentary clearly states that people of dark skin are looked upon suspiciously by police.  Also, the fact that clubs there are private and hide behind privacy as a means of violating the First Amendment with regard to freedom of religion.  For example, there are clubs there that do not even permit members to bring in Jewish friends as guests.  The people in the presentation claim that change is coming allbeit slowly.  Hopefully, it sped up since the filming in this case",1383264000,,712,4.795081967213115
7802763,3,6300128881,"I have read the book by Ronald Kessler that this special was based on, ""The Season: The Secret Life of Palm Beach and America's Richest Society"" and they both go hand in hand. If you watch or read one, then you must also do the other one. I watched this A&E special when it originally aired and then also a few years later when it was re-aired and after reading the book I decided to buy it on DVD and re-watch it. I was surprised at how dated it was though! Ronald Kessler and his wife are even in the special so it was nice to see them in person and also Kirby Kooluris who is written about in the book. I wish that more of the people who were written about had been featured though. I'm glad I bought it but I paid $30 for it which I think is insanely overpriced for this program.",1364342400,,783,4.0256410256410255
7802764,4,6300128881,"Anyone with an interest in the lifestyles of the rich will really enjoy this DVD. Just like the Born Rich documentary, this one has a surprisingly candid look at what goes on in this exclusive society.

Just like the ""good buildings"" in the Upper East Side co-ops of Manhattan, money is not enough. The country clubs in this part of the country have a gentlemen's agreement where people are not invited simply based on race/religion. Two examples mentioned are Jews and blacks. Despite this ugly side, they also highlight the important role that charity plays out, and all the fuss that goes on around their fundraising parties. According to one guy, Palm Beach also has the greatest concentration of dollars donated for one area.

You can expect to see all the eye candy of beautiful homes, great landscaping, cars, jewelry, mar-a-lago, and a bit of celebrity with a Trump interview. His 90k a year club is reportedly the only one which does not have any requirement other than the entry fee.

If you saw, and liked the Born Rich documentary, you will probably like this one as well.  This one however, focuses on what the parent's of the born rich crowd might look/act like.",1203120000,2,1176,4.75

I TAPED IT ON  DVD FROM A&E AND  IT IS NOW  BROKEN,  I HAVE TO HAVE IT IN MY LIBRARY!  TOTALLY LIFESTYLES OF THE RICH AND RICHER! YOU WONT BE DISAPOINTED!!!",1132531200,,250,3.784313725490196
