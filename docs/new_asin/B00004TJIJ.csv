8246879,1,B00004TJIJ,I did NOT like it. technique was lousy for anything but the very specific rules under the knock down tournament.  I would NOT recommend it if you are looking to see any thing but that knock down type thing.  techniques are what I would expect from a white belt but the rules make it work.,1357776000,,288,4.218181818181818
8246880,1,B00004TJIJ,This is garbage. There is no content whatsoever and the editorial review is a pack of lies.,1036627200,,91,4.411764705882353
8246881,2,B00004TJIJ,"The action is ""so so"" while the production quality is that of a high school project. If you were competing and your girlfriend filmed it you would watch it more than once, otherwise it's just a competition like any other.
The very best competiton videos are made by Champ Co.in Tokyo who have made it their speciality-videos from other souces are best borrowed from a library.
