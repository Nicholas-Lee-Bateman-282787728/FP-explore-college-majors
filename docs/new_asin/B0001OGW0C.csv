8016022,5,B0001OGW0C,This is a made for TV movie that I taped (VHS) when I first saw it in high school.  It has plenty of action and the search for the killer is successfully sustained through to the end.  I enjoyed it.  I was happy to find it on DVD after searching for a while.,1496707200,,258,3.830188679245283
