8168291,5,0966515404,"It is not fair for me to rate the show as I was the executive producer; however, after reading the Yorba Linda ""review"" I felt a response  was necessary. (As the site requires I rate it, I'll give myself a  5).
First, Mr. Clancy was the presenter, not the journalist.  Our  research team included a former deputy director of the FBI and the former  Senior Investigator of the House Committee on UnAmerican Activities as well  as two journalists who covered Washington DC during the Watergate  years.
I am truly at a loss as to how ""Yorba Linda"" sees this  effort as an attempt to justify Nixon's actions.  On the contrary, Clancy  himself decided the man must have been insane by the end of his presidency.
That said, It is important to know that there was much, much more going  on in our nation's capital.  People do not realize, as I did not until this  project, just how close we came to lossing everything our nation stands  for; and not just because of Richard Nixon.
We attempted to paint this  period of history on a broader tapastry with John Ehrilichman as our guide.  Those of you who have read ""Inside the Third Reich"" will  understand that to explore the causes of a criminal's behavior is not the  same as justifying a criminal's behavior.
Finally, given the attitude  ""Yorba Linda"" had toward Mr. Clancy's other work, I doubt that  this person ever saw the show in the first place; it sounds, unfortunately,  as if they judged the book by its cover.",966038400,10,1464,4.575289575289576
