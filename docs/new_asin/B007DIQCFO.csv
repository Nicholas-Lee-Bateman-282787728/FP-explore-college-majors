8514986,4,B007DIQCFO,"A homeless and hungry young woman tries to get arrested in the park for prostitution so she can have a roof over her head and warm meals. As she is being arrested, three old men become her guardian angelssaving her from arrest and taking care of her until she can thrive on her own. Complications, suspicion, and illegal activity commence. This is a charming romantic comedy. Sally Blane and Henry B. Walthall showcase their talents in strong performances surrounded by  pedestrian acting, but the weaknesses do not detract from the value of this film. Its engaging from the first scene, and, although no award-winner, its a pleasant diversion and well worth watching.",1524268800,,668,4.964285714285714
