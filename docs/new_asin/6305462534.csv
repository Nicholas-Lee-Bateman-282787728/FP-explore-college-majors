1032624,5,6305462534,I had the privilge of watching this wonderful IMAX production on the IMAX screen at Hearst Castle in California. I was completely taken in by the cinematography as well as the content of the movie itself. It was well  written and well acted and the scenery was breathtaking as were the  re-enactments of how the Pyramids of Giza may have been built was  fantastic. I only wish that a soundtrack CD would be released since the  music was also a feast for the ears. I recommend this DVD to all.,939945600,2,492,4.433333333333334
1032744,5,6305462534,"The narration is by a grandfather (Omar Sharif) to his grandaughter. He
tells a simple story of the history of ancient Egypt.
The images are awesome and of IMAX quality, and the music
is lovely.
  The Nile is followed from its beginning as it encounters water
falls, rapids, river wildlife, many gorgeous views of ancient ruins.
There are some reinactments and computer special effects located throughout.
  The dramatization of the discovery of King Tut's tomb by
Howard Carter is well done (portrayed in black and white).
  I wish it had been a little longer!  I recommend it to anyone who
likes IMAX DVDs.",1184803200,,608,4.844660194174757
1032745,5,6305462534,"This is a favorite DVD in our house.  It has stunning camera work, wonderful information and an excellent narrative.  It portrays the glory of Ancient Egypt and the pride modern Egyptians still feel towards their heritage.

Like all Imax documentaries it's only 40 minutes long and written at a fourth grade level.  If you have a problem with those preconditions, don't watch Imax.  We're homeschoolers and we love it.  My children pay close attention, break out the Legos and start building pyramids of their own.",1114992000,10,514,4.988235294117647
1032746,3,6305462534,"This was an excellent documentary on Egypt, with stunning footages and photography. But if you are looking for real Mysteries of Egypt and the investigative report on them, this surely is not the video you shall look for. From historical point of view and general overview of ancient Egypt, it certainly is a good one.

The title is rather misleading......",1112659200,3,356,4.933333333333334
1032747,4,6305462534,I bought and watched this before going on a trip to Egypt. Very good quality imax movie and good overview of the stories of King Tut. But if you want a lot of details you have to dig some where else. A good introductory movie for people interested in Ancient Egypt. A little bit short though.,972518400,18,292,4.232142857142857
1032748,4,6305462534,"Very nice picture format for TV viewing matched with a great dolby sound. Narrated by Omar Shariff, this docummentary gives you an acceptable information on ancient Egypt, not for academic purposes though. It's not boring at all and the Pyramids views and sunsets are spectacular. Great if you plan to visit Egypt in the near future, it will put you in the right mood !!!",970617600,5,371,4.723076923076923
1032749,3,6305462534,"I had a chance to see this on an IMAX screen and the visuals of Egypt were terrific, but what made this movie bad was having actors try to tell a fictional story. This would of been much better as just a straight  documentary feature, instead they tried to ""Hollywood"" it up,  with poor results. My suggestion is, rent this :)",958780800,7,326,4.327868852459017

1032751,5,6305462534,"This is a great way to incentive your kid into the knowledge of how awesome and different was the egyptian culture several years ago (any culture, as a matter of fact). If there's a way in which we can use dvd  technology in a positive way for kids, this is it. After watching this  disc, my kid asked me about the Nile and other rivers (the aerial scenes of  the Nile from its source to Egypt are awesome), she also asked me facts  from our history and imagined herself living those days. I guess that is a  lot better than playing to be Cow and Chiken or any of that ugly stuff. Buy  this and start your own visual library for your kids.",949881600,11,639,4.154471544715447
1032752,5,6305462534,I first saw this film at an Imax at the Futuroscope in France.  The images in this film are breath-taking as is the narration by Sharif.  A MUST for your DVD library!,945734400,3,166,4.15625
1032753,4,6305462534,"This is the first time I have ever watched an IMAX film on DVD and I was very, very impressed especially with the cinematography and the soundtrack. Omar Sharif was priceless as the movie's narrator, a role which I felt fit  him perfectly.
Apart from the legendary Curse of King Tut (Sharif  incidentally dispels this towards the end, and his last words regarding  this formed a most befitting ""epilogue"" of sorts to the disc),  the significance of the Nile River to Egyption civilization was discussed  along with certain theories on how the pyramids were built.  I don't  believe that the intention of this disc is to provide a more  ""adult"" dissertation on Egyptian history (it's only 40 mins.  long, which is actually why I gave it only 4 stars!) but rather to  stimulate one's (particularly chilren's perhaps) imagination and to spark  some interest in the theme.  This for me is what primarily makes it a great  and enduring addition to anyone's DVD library.
Also in this disc are  trailers for other IMAX films on Hawaii and Whales, among others.",945129600,10,1053,4.810055865921788

7889717,5,6305462534,Excellent DVD! Very educational and interesting. I showed it to my middle schoolers and they were transfixed.,1454198400,2,109,5.470588235294118
7889718,5,6305462534,"This is a fascinating overview of ancient Egypt, with fresh, elegant cinematography of its spendid ruins and some great re-enactments.  It was very well done for the time allotted; would that it could have been quite a bit longer.  I like both Omar Sharif, who is the films principal narrator, and Kate Maberly, who plays his visiting granddaughter.  The dialogue format between them works extremely well; I wish there had been time for a lot more of it.  (Can you imagine being a young teenager, on location in Egypt, playing opposite a screen legend like Mr. Sharif?  Wow, what a lucky girl!  Interestingly, she had previously worked with the films director, Bruce Neibaur, as the lead in an amazing movie, Friendships Field, and was previously in Gullivers Travels with Mr. Sharif, so obviously shes a very talented girl, too).

All in all, a fine, creative documentary film on this very old and ever-intriguing civilization.",1427673600,2,928,4.987012987012987
7889719,3,6305462534,great movie for kids studying ancient Egypt ~ but the movie was tough to install without help from the school tech teacher,1403481600,,122,4.590909090909091
7889720,5,6305462534,"Not having been to Egypt for several years, I found this DVD a wonderful substitute for actually seeing familiar sites again.
Beautiful photography, excellent narration by Omar Sharif and a wonderful presentation of the history of this marvelous nation.
I recommend it highly.",1398211200,,276,5.441860465116279
7889721,5,6305462534,Last seen on Imax; the overview of Egypt's history enclosed in a family expedition is fabulous. Photography so beautiful. A gorgeous reminder of places seen on a once-in-a-lifetime holiday. The documentary that accompanies is fascinating too. A must for egyptophiles,1394928000,,266,5.675
7889722,5,6305462534,"We got a chance to see this at the California Science Center IMAX theater right after touring the awesome Cleopatra exhibit. The movie is great, the whole family was enthralled. I loved everything about it, the amazing pictures of Egypt with views you can't see even if you go there in person. The story line between the grandfather and the little girl is unobtrusive and I thought added a nice personal touch to engage young viewers.

We have had the dvd for a few days and my 5 year old has watched it every day. It looks like there are a few special features, nice dvd.",1345334400,,572,4.39622641509434
7889723,5,6305462534,"This former IMAX production was described to me as a must-see by a person who lived in Egypt for eight years. I was not disappointed. It gives a good overall historical overview of this civilization that lasted for 3,000 years and began over 5,000 years ago. Having just returned from three weeks in Egypt it was a great way to share with my friends and family. It also served as a great introduction to my slide show. Also includes an interesting piece on how this  movie was made.",1265932800,,482,4.4772727272727275
7889724,5,6305462534,"If you just want to sit back and let some gorgeous camera work just take you away on a trip to Egypt -- get this DVD.

The images are just amazing... stunning! I bought this for a child who requested it, but the whole family loves this DVD and we've watched it over and over again. If you love Egyptian history, I can't recommend this video enough. You will truly enjoy it as a glimpse into the past.",1254009600,2,400,4.128205128205129
7889725,3,6305462534,"Mysteries of Egypt, a production by IMAX, introduces viewers to Ancient Egypt.  The aerial photography of the river Nile is spectacular and is worth the purchase of that production on its own.  Unfortunately, the authors of Mysteries of Egypt spend too much time covering the supposed curse of Pharaoh Tutankhamun's tomb.  To its credit, Mysteries of Egypt can give some viewers a taste for a more substantive, visual overview of Ancient Egypt.  Think for instance about Egypt: Beyond the Pyramids by The History Channel or The Mysteries of Egypt by Kultur.",1211846400,,557,5.087912087912088
