8703029,5,B00TSUJA90,"I am a recent K drama fan and now have watched dozens... yes I have a lot of time on my hands... This drama I loved. The acting is just good by Jung Ryeo-won who plays a ""bumpkin"" to perfection. She does not overdo it. The love story is good also and together Kim Rae-Won and Jung Ryeo-won win the viewer over to their side (that they should be together, that nothing is wrong with it! )The mother in Seoul is a bit too much of a controlling freak... but then the story would not have been as good had she not try to keep the young loves separated. I liked that it was an innocent love and sweet. That is what I like about Korean Dramas and movies. They retain the pristine quality of love in relationships. As they develop more I have noticed that the writers are putting more in them that would be found on the American screen but this one maintained the thought of sweet pure love... the ending engagement party part was a bit lame...",1482796800,,937,4.211111111111111
