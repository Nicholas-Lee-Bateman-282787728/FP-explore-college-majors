My brother and I went back and saw the movie the next day, and a couple of days later we saw it again. It has some very funny elements and without betraying the plot I think Leon Schuster did his best work in this film. It was similar in style to the series ""Gods Must Be Crazy"" but was very independent. Its main focal point was making fun of the way the United Nations sometimes handles their ""security details"", and the movie never takes itself seriously.",1148342400,,629,4.121951219512195
