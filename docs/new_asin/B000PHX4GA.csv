8191507,5,B000PHX4GA,"My 3 year old has seen many Jay Jay movies, but this one is by far his favorite.  It has some nice educational value, simple to understand for a young child.  Also introduces Lina, a new character, which is my son's new favorite plane.  Overall a great movie that I would highly recommend.",1202515200,,289,4.415094339622642
8191508,2,B000PHX4GA,I was horrified when the theme song was missing from this DVD.  My 4 year old son has autism and goes through periods of time when he likes to watch and hear the same show or song over and over again.  Well now it is Jay Jay.  Well he only gets to watch it at the sitter's as we do not get any station that carries it at home.  So my husband saw the DVD and bought it.  I was so excited.. We showed my son the DVD and he went straigt to the couch to take a front row seat to watch.  We kept waiting for the song. He got really upset and would not watch the rest of the DVD.  The New Mystery style DVD's are all I can find.  If they would just include the theme song on the extras feature of the DVD I think that would be great.  If not I will not buy another DVD,1189382400,8,762,3.6832298136645965
