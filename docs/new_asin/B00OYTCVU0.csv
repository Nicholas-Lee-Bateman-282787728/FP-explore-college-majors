8685508,5,B00OYTCVU0,"great, to complement his 1993 2CD release - cities of the heart - we have here complete 2 day performance with extra added tunes like TUBE (with Dick and Ginger who recorded it in 1963), As you said, Rope ladder, Bosteon game etc. Worth checking 3 DVD version with documentary - it is historical staff. Absolutely 1 st class in all terms.",1418774400,5,338,4.467741935483871
8685509,5,B00OYTCVU0,"I have had the cd set of this concert since 1994 and always wished for the availability of it on video(in those days) or dvd. Now at last it is here but I wonder why it was held back until now. At any rate, mine came in right after the release. The first thing I did was go straight to ""Ships in the Night"" with Maggie Reilly. I loved the song and performance on both the live cd and studio version (""Willpower"" anthology, for example) and couldn't wait to SEE it  performed. I was not disappointed. As a matter of fact, watching Jack sing made me break down and really grieve the loss of such a powerful, influential musician. If it wasn't for Jack Bruce, I probably would not be a bassist for the last 46 years. That said, I love the filming of this dvd but the sound kind of wavers. The performances are outstanding from all with Simon Phillips really enhancing Jack's melodies and bass playing. For anyone who is not familiar with Jack's solo work, not that knowledgeable of his masterful bass work (or his other instruments!) and that incredible voice (listen to ""The Best is Still to Come"") one should watch this dvd set and understand the huge loss the music world suffered on Oct. 25, 2014",1418428800,10,1197,4.416289592760181
8685510,5,B00OYTCVU0,"Yes, Jack Bruce recently departed from this earth, but the decision to make this 2 dvd set a five star had no sentimental value to it. Filmed in two  gigs on stage from November 1993 in Cologne, this is a wide ranging panorama of what the mind of a creative and boundless artist is capable of achieving. In celebration of his then 50th birthday, Bruce brings together buddies including Ginger Baker/ts, Dick Heckstall-Smith/ts, Clem Clempson/g (who bears a striking resemblance to Eric Clapton FYI), Simon P hillips/d, Bernie Worrell/p and blueswailing guitarist Gary Moore for a wide ranging and soul satisfying mix of Cream, classics and Chicago blues.
He opens the concert bowing on a bass an ""Improvisation On Minuet No. 1"" before delivering a lovely piano solo on ""FM."" Intimate singing on ""Can You Follow? "" and ""Running Thro' Our Hands"" all set the stage for an eclectic evening of music inquiry. A hip jazzy take of ""The Tube"" includes some modern jazz tenor work by Heckstall-Smith before the horns come out with some Memphis soul on ""Neighbor, Neighbor"" and ""Born Under A Bad Sign"" which have Bruce in wonderful vocal form.""
Highlights? Ya gotta be kidding! A guilty pleasure has to be the 2 cellos and acoustic guitar of the understated Cream classic ""As You Said"" while Baker thunders away on a smoking ""NSU."" Bruce's slick bass work is in evidence on a snappy ""White Room"" and a brassy ""Sunshine of Your Love."" Then, all gets kicked up a notch as blues rocker Gary Moore slides on stage and tears apart Cream hits like ""Politician,"" Spoonful"" and a closing ""White Room."" As they say, it doesn't get better than this!
There are various incarnations of this celebration, some with cds, some just with dvds. Get any and get all. Pass them around!",1418342400,13,1756,4.776315789473684
