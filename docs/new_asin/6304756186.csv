921510,5,6304756186,"I was fortunate enough to have attended this concert back in 1993 at UC-Santa Cruz. It's funny because I didn't start out as a Kenny Loggins fan, and I am still not crazy about alot of his music, but when my girlfriend suggested we go, I decided to take a risk! Every time I hear this concert I am grateful that I made the decision to go!

I have been to many concerts, and Outside-From the Redwoods remains the best concert I have ever attended! Everything about the concert was wonderful. Kenny Loggins is undoubtedly one of the finest live performers living today! Many performers sound great when they are in the controlled environment of the studio, where mistakes and sour-notes can be fixed and as soon as you put them in front of an audience they sound awful! Not Kenny Loggins! I think he is best when heard live! He thrives off of the energy of the audience and draws inspiration from them to sing his heart out for them! His entire group of backing artists from guitar and piano players on down to an amazing harmonica player, have to be some of the most talented and capable musicians around! His Guest artists, such as Michael McDonald and Shanice bring perfect balance to his own remarkable voice.

As far as the DVD is concerned, I am amazed at the stunning quality of both the audio and the video! This could have been recorded last week, instead of twelve years ago! I remember the feeling of sitting on our blanket watching Kenny and his friends in the beautiful and majestic setting of the Redwoods at the Shakespeare Festival Glen. This DVD brought all of that back and made me feel like I was sitting right there, all over again! The video is so good that even on a normal flat screen TV, it felt like I was watching High Definition video!

Of course, the concert wasn't perfect and neither is this DVD. For one thing, even when I was at the concert I found some of Kenny's segue comments a bit strange and they made me a bit uncomfortable. I respect Kenny and his views (which I happen to largely agree with), especially when it comes to the environment, but there were moments, some of which are seen in the DVD, when Kenny would take questions from the audience. Not just questions like, ""How did you get started in the business?"", but ""life-questions"" like, ""In this crazy world, how do you keep centered?"" And then to see Kenny up there, sitting on the edge of the stage like Moses come down from the  mountain (or dare I say it, Jesus!), pontificating and philosophizing about how we need to just follow our hearts and teach our children Hope, on so on and so forth.... Well, it just felt very strange. I had paid to see a musical performance, not ""Life lessons from Kenny Loggins-Musical Guru"". But, those moments were relatively few and they didn't ruin the rest of the concert for me and thankfully they only show a few of these moments on the DVD. And in Kenny's defense they were clearly very heartfelt and well meant.

The other small negative of the DVD is that although it adds 3 songs that were not included on the CD version (which I also have), the DVD eliminated 3 of the songs that were on the CD version. Those three songs were some of my favorites too, such as a second duet with Shanice called ""I Would Do Anything"" and a wonderful version of ""Celebrate Me Home"", which is one of my favorites from the concert. Also eliminated on the DVD was an awesome performance of ""Angry Eyes"". On the DVD, one of the replacement songs was ""Return To Pooh Corner"", which though nice, unless you have young children, it doesn't do much. I could have done without it, anyway!

That being said, this is still a wonderful DVD of the best concert I have ever attended and would be a treasured addition to any Kenny Loggins fans collection. I would also recommend this DVD (as well as the CD) to anyone, even if they don't think they could ever be a Kenny Loggins fan! This is not your typical Kenny Loggins music and it is performed in a way which is fresh and impressive and the scenery is gorgeous too!

By the way, if your foot isn't tapping to the beat during the energetic performances of ""Footloose"" and ""I'm Alright"", you had better check your pulse. You might be dead?!

This DVD still gets a solid and well deserved 5 out of 5 stars!",1106179200,26,4267,4.447570332480819
921511,4,6304756186,"I found this DVD well performed and produced.  I deducted a star because I thought the commentary between a couple songs was a bit preachy, but the message was okay.  It just seemed out of place and detracted from the concert.  That said, this DVD is very enjoyable and the duet with Micheal McDonald was a nice touch.",1089331200,4,318,4.448275862068965
921512,5,6304756186,"I had the Redwoods concert on audiotape from many years ago.  I'm not an especially big Kenny Loggins fan, but I bought it for some reason and wound up playing it a lot.  It started to wear out, so I bought the DVD, and it is frankly better than the audio version -- there are songs left out of album, and this a show worth actually seeing because of how much is going on.  One remarkable thing you notice about this concert is that (with the exception of some slide guitar playing) the instrumentation is entirely acoustic -- no electronic keyboards, solid-body bass or guitars. Details like the vibraphone playing and African percussion stand out when you can actually see the concert.  And it's a treat to be able to see Howard Levy (harmonica), who is worth tracking down no matter what record he's playing on. The only drawback are a couple hoaky Q&A sessions with the audience, but they're short. And for some strange reason Loggins looks like he's about to cry during the first half of the show.  But it's a hell of a sound when they get all these great musicians on stage.  For a show that was not recorded with a DVD in mind, it makes for a very good one.",1065830400,28,1164,4.390697674418605
921513,5,6304756186,"The first Kenny Loggins CD I bought was the one from this concert, on a recommendation from a lounge act I heard in Singapore 8 years ago!
Subsequently, this was the very first DVD in my collection (that now numbers 500+) and the only thing any fan could be disappointed with is the non-inclusion of Celebrate Me Home and Angry Eyes, both of which are marvellous renditions on the CD.  I won't complain too much about that though, because the inclusion of Forever on the DVD goes some way to making up for that!
Having said that, now I can see the performers, I realise the CD has been mixed with some musicians on the wrong side of the stage so that's something to get used to at first!!!
I'm buying a 2nd copy of the DVD now, because I've damaged the original disc carrying it half way round the world on holiday (yes, it's definitely a desert island disc of mine) so I guess that says I can't live without it.
The quality of the songwriting and musical performances is superb, but what non-fans won't know is how good Kenny's singing voice is.  His range is broad and he sings with such power, soul and conviction, you just know he's feeling every lyric.  He's also much under rated as a guitarist himself, being very accomplished at picking out some rather nifty tunes.
It's so hard amongst the high quality tracks to pick favourites, but if I had to, they would be Now and Then and Leap of Faith, the first because it has minimalist backing and shows what a great voice Kenny has and the second because of the way the (quite large) band works so well together with a huge range of instruments being used.
I find the video quality pretty good for something shot on video and originally intended for VHS release and my home theatre is normally pretty revealing of 2nd rate transfers.  As for the soundtracks, the 5.1 has some slightly artificial depth, but it certainly isn't intrusive and it's just about favourite over the stereo.
If you like good music, interesting lyrics and a lively performance, don't hesitate, just buy this disc - you won't be disappointed!",1062288000,10,2068,4.536193029490617
921514,3,6304756186,"If you're expecting an adrenaline-driven outing featuring all of Kenny Loggins' uptempo numbers like ""Danger Zone"" and ""Playing With The Boys"", this DVD isn't for you.
It is, however, a fine unplugged-style performance filmed agianst the gorgeous backdrop of the Redwoods, with Kenny backed by a truly talented bunch of musicians and some outstanding guests, including Michael McDonald and Windham Hill Records' founder Will Ackerman.
Beginning with the anthemic ""Conviction Of The Heart"", carrying on through ""What A Fool Believes"" (performed as a duet with Michael McDonald), and a zydecko-influenced ""Footloose"", this concert is just great to watch.
Other stand-out tracks include ""Will Of The Wind"" (featuring Will Ackerman) and ""Watching The River Run"".
The sound comes in two flavours, stereo and Dolby Digital 5.1. Skip the stereo track and stick to the 5.1, which has great ambience and just opens up the sound.
The video is pretty ok, though not of reference quality. Part of the concert was filmed during the day, and part of it night. The night-time sequences look a little soft, but aren't distracting.",1055808000,4,1114,5.264044943820225
921515,5,6304756186,"Wow! What more can I say? I wasn't a huge fan of Kenny Loggins, but I bought this DVD on the recommendation of a friend. The sound quality is AMAZING. This DVD truly delivers the realism that DVD is capable of  offering. The sound is truly magical, even in regular stereo mode. The  music completely envelopes you. I thought that nothing could sound better  than CD, but this DVD truly sounds incredible. The music is excellent, too.  I'm definitely a new Kenny Loggins fan! This DVD is a must see/hear  experience.",959644800,4,515,4.615384615384615
921516,5,6304756186,"This DVD is shot amongst the redwoods.  The music is a little is really well put together by Kenny and a diverse group of musicians.
The video and sound quality are superb.  If you don't like Kenny, try renting this to  enjoy your home theatre system.  If you like Kenny, it's a must  buy.

921952,5,6304756186,This is a pretty old concert but Loggins music hasn't significantly changed since it was made so it is still current.  This was made when Loggins was working with Michael McDonald on some songs and McDonald does appear on the video to sing one of the songs.

922201,4,6304756186,I have had the cd of this concert for years and always wished I had been there. When I found this dvd I could finally see the whole show. There is a part where Kenny Loggins stops playing and lets the audience ask questions. This was really hoaky and the questins seemed staged.

Kenny has great upbeat energy and the rest of the musician's  are some of the best. I saw this when it first came out, in the 90's and it's where I got introduced to Howard Levee (harmonica) and Sonny Landreth on slide guitar. Now I own a slew of Sonny Landreth music and have gone to see him 3 times.
If you're questioning..., just do it, buy this DVD, turn up the volume and enjoy.",1256256000,,518,4.232323232323233

922547,3,6304756186,"I was a little disappointed. But first the good....
A beautiful setting in Santa Cruz, CA, all of his guests were great, and Kenny looks very fit.  The bad?  Except for three songs near the end, all the songs were very, very s-l-o-w.  I guess he was being artistic?  I didn't even recognize ""What a Fool Believes"" until almost the end because he and Michael MacDonald were singing it so slowly.  And I was stunned at the end when an entire band appeared because during the first two thirds of the show there was only a guitar being strummed, or a xylophone being hit with giant que-tips.  And there was an older lady wearing a gingham dress (she looked like the women from the polygamous set we see on T.V.) playing a tambourine or hitting a brass triangle.  Then we find out there is, indeed, a full orchestra who must have just arrived for the end of the show.  All the people in the audience were laying on the grass and didn't sit up or get on their feet until he played ""Footloose"" and ""I'm Alright"" at the very end.  I found it to be a real snore.  A shame because he has had so many hit songs and I was looking forward to a lively concert.",1220054400,,1146,4.23963133640553

He had some really talented guests and a great backing band.  I particularly enjoyed the addition of Sonny Landreth - the hands down absolute best slide guitar player in the world, into the band.  And of course, Michael McDonald's vocals are always fantastic even if just in a support role. I wish he would have let Michael sing on more than the one tune. ""This Is It"" would have been my choice.  I bought this DVD and the Loggins concert at the Grand Canyon DVD but this was my favorite.",1211846400,,633,4.206611570247934

922552,4,6304756186,"Back in 1993 I was working as a technician for the Shakespeare Santa Cruz festival.  The previous year, Kenny had walked around the UC Santa Cruz campus, walked through our Festival Glen, and decided then and there that he wanted to do a concert there.

They decided on a theme"" leap of faith.  Promotions were made, instructing fans to fax in descriptions of their own leaps of faith.  The best stories were picked and those fans were selected to get tickets.  When the concert came 'round and the crowd filed in, the energy was pretty incredible.  Free tickets, hand-picked, all of them major fans.  I wasn't a Loggings fan and still am pretty neutral about his music, but nonetheless, it was an incredible day.  For fans, this is probably the best concert film out there.",1176508800,,774,4.681481481481481
922553,5,6304756186,"Like many others I only knew Kenny from Footloose, Danger Zone and an energetic performance on 'Live Aid'. Doing some DVD exploration I decided to risk a concert. It was one of those happy finds.

This is a really good concert and I liked the setting under the redwoods. He began strongly with 'Conviction of the Heart' which I really liked and it went from there.

He has a strong presence and a lot of heart and enthusiasm. Great upbeat rock type numbers and some gentler stuff too - often sung with guests who complemented him well.

His sharing of personal philosophy that other reviewers have referred to only happened, and then very briefly, about twice and was no distraction or discomfort for me.

Footloose is there but not Danger Zone. He had recently been compiling an album of children's songs that parents could comfortably sit through and included 'House at Pooh Corner' from it.

The audience is a family one sitting on rugs under the trees. There is a lovely cameo when a little girl in the audience is seen dancing unselfconsciously: singing all the words as if she knew them intimately.

This is a good concert if you like adult contemporary rock or country ballads (though the emphasis isn't really that way majorly), if you are a former hippie or Earth lover, or just if you have heart and enjoy solid entertainment.",1109548800,10,1336,4.688034188034188
