It begins with people walking in a field. Horse-drawn buggies travel in 1984 Pennsylvania. A man speaks Pennsylvania Dutch to the assembled people. Then they eat. A man has died. Some of the Amish will travel on a train to a big city. Be careful among the English is their advice. The train to Baltimore is delayed, they wait in the train station, alone. Two men attack and knife another man! They hear a noise and search the stalls. The young boy ducks under a partition to escape. The police arrive and question young Samuel. He is a material witness. [How accurate can a description be of a stranger only seen for short time under stress?] Detective John Book takes them to his home for safekeeping. Can Samuel identify a suspect? Yes. But he sees a newspaper photo of another black man, Lt. McFee. There was a case where a gallon of P2P disappeared after a police raid.

There is a shooting attempt on Detective Book. He borrows a car, takes the mother and son, and goes into hiding. His partner removes the folders on Rachel Lapp and her son. The crooked cops go to search for Book, but he is gone. Book was hit but doesnt want to go to a hospital because the doctors will report any gunshot wound and he would be found. Book will be treated, his automobile is towed to a barn and hidden. There is a problem talking to the Amish. Samuel looks at John Books pistol! Samuel gets a lecture about a weapon. Book is offered Amish clothes to wear. The Mennonites have cars and telephones. [Why does Book have no beard?] His partner tells John to stay away, he would be in danger. Milking time is 4:30 AM. John learns a new skill. Later they hear music from the car radio. He dances with Mrs. Lapp, until an elder arrives. The people gossip, there is talk about shunning.

In Philadelphia Books partner is questioned bout his whereabouts. Books arm is pretty much healed now. There is a communal gathering to build a structure. It is completed by sunset. Book sees Rachel, its raining at night. A bus tour arrives in Amish country. Book learns Sergeant Carter was killed in the line of duty! Book calls his superior office about this. There are rude visitors; they learn a lesson in manners! But this attracts attention. John will leave for his own world tomorrow. In the dawn a big sedan arrives, three men leave with shotguns. They invade the Lapp home, they want Book (who is in the barn). One shoots at Book and misses. A deluge of grain stops Fergie. Book recovers his shotgun and stops McFee. Samuel rings the bell to summon others. Paul is stopped. The local police rollup to handle the situation. Book returns to his automobile and drives away.

In 1915 John Buchan wrote The Thirty-Nine Steps, a story where an innocent man is hunted by the police for murder and the villains because he knows too much. The hero winds in the end. That plot was used in many movies by Hitchcock and others. This ending reminds me of Shane, where the hero leaves to travel on. Since so many movies have been made there must always be similarities in movies. Was this based on the Rampart scandal in the Los Angeles Police Department where drugs and money disappeared from the Evidence Room?",1521763200,,3198,4.527681660899654
