5890463,5,B00E4V0JAW,"Bob Forest is an amazing success story. Seeing him and what he does give hope to everyone who struggles to survive each day to stay clean and sober. Thinking about Bob has given me the inspiration to live clean. Great movie to honestly tell his life. Thanks for being so brave and letting this story be told Bob.

5890464,2,B00E4V0JAW,"Nothing like being a junkie in Hollywood to hone a con man mentality. Forrest -- a useless musician who played in a useless L.A. band -- has remade himself as the go-to guy (when Dr. Drew is busy with his media career) for L.A. status seekers with habits. Forrest, the con man who never met a name he couldn't drop, runs around spouting addiction platitudes of his own creation while giving his enlarged ego a workout by placing himself at the center of the celeb treatment action. I found him and the annoying phony laugh with which he follows every dropped name to be wholly repulsive -- just like the city and third-rate music scene he trumpets throughout this vanity project. Like Henry Rollins -- another know-nothing with an outsize opinion of himself -- Forrest babbles on about what a fantastic underground music scene L.A. had in the '80s. I took a good look around at the time and I can safely say the city and its offerings haven't been worth a toss since the end of the '60s. Forrest is a product of his own overheated self-image. Sorry, kids, but someone had to tell the truth.",1397174400,9,1090,4.538071065989848
5890465,4,B00E4V0JAW,"Often inspiring biographical documentary about Bob Forrest, lead singer and songwriter for the late 80s LA critical darling Thelonius Monster and his battle with addiction, leading him to become an outspoken and passionate advocate for helping get people off drugs.

It's good to see a drugs and rock 'n' roll documentary that shows someone surviving, coming out the other side, and not only learning from his plunge, but using his knowledge of suffering to help others, There's some real inventiveness amidst the talking heads: animation, both claymation and line drawings help flesh out Bob's experiences. Interviews with Bob's friends and band mates from the late 80s L. A. inde rock/punk scene including Flea, Anthony Kiedis, Courtney Love let us in to both Bob's bravery, and what a total jerk he was when drugs and anger ruled his life.

Yet, for all it's power, there's something a little too neat about the documentary. Or maybe it's that it tries to cover too much  Bob's whole musical career from the very start, his slow rise to rock semi-stardom to his collapse into selling out, his childhood, the whole arc of his drug addiction, from his obsession to the idea of drugs as a depressed young guy, to working as a dishwasher when he was finally trying to get clean, and then his whole life post drugs, from being lost in the wilderness, to discovering his voice as a drug counselor and advocate, and re-discovering his love of playing music, not to be a star, but for the joy of it. That's a lot to jam into an 87 minute documentary, and sometimes it feels like important details are being skipped over. It can also fall into making Bob too much of a saint, there's sort of a fan- boy air to it, For all those around him being willing to talk about how awful Bob was at his addicted low, there's a little too much of the hagiography to the current version of Bob, a man I suspect is still more complex, maybe even difficult than the film lets on.",1397088000,15,1958,4.620689655172414
5890466,5,B00E4V0JAW,"I really enjoyed this documentary, a real insight to the world of addiction and LA in the 80's/90's.

5890467,5,B00E4V0JAW,"This documentary shows Bob Forrest's (indie rock hero of Thelonious Monster and well  known addiction counselor on Celebrity Rehab) transformation from his 80's punk-indie rock addiction riddled life to a life focused on helping others with addiction.

Beyond carrying a message of hope to reach and help the addict and alcoholic he takes on the recovery industry and doesn't go along for the non nonsensical profit driven ride by prescribing addictive prescription  drugs to those addicted to drugs.  ""shocking!"" Bill Wilson founder of Alcoholics Anonymous also continued to look for new ways to help the alcoholic and was not content with the group's success.  Wilson wanted to find ways to help the millions who had not found recovery.

The film is high energy entertainment with lots of music video and interviews with stars from the Chili Peppers, Jane's Addiction and more.

Bob Forrest says ""It Ends Well if You Don't Die"" and tells us that having a purpose (a life with meaning from helping others) is more important than selling lots of records.",1396656000,19,1054,5.057803468208093

5890469,5,B00E4V0JAW,"As someone with a 30 year background in clinical social work and a doctorate in life coaching I find that Bob's gifts are exceptional. Besides passion and experience, it is clear that Bob's work comes from of a place of real love, compassion and respect. I grew up in Southern California in the 80s just like Bob. He is only 4 years older than I am and I am told he went to the same high school in Huntington Beach. I remember that rock scene well. It is beautiful to see what a person can do with their live's once sober. He is a walking reminder that you CAN GET SOBER no matter how dire the circumstances. I still hold hope that some of my dearest love ones will be able to be able to come to a place of self love that will motivate sobriety. I will spread the word about this movie. Thank you Bob!

I am a Licensed Chemical Dependency Counselor, conducting groups with clients referred from the Criminal Justice System. I am always on the search for realistic information, that they can relate to and will hold their attention. This certainly filled the bill. I thought it was very creative when his use of heroin was depicted in ""cartoon format"", as that still held class attention, however was less of a trigger than actual use depiction.

It is a very well done, cohesive, informative documentary. In addition to my clients complete involvement, which was observed throughout the presentation, this counselor was impressed with the honesty of Bob as he shared his downward spiral into addiction.

I was intrigued, he always seemed like a nice and fairly private guy, so I was curious as to what his story was. Boy, I had no idea! Bob was a rock star for real! This documentary was really awesome. It went through his childhood all the way up to present day. It had interviews with his friends, many of whom are quite famous rock stars, and had lots of old concert footage. If you enjoy uplifting stories of triumph, this is the movie for you. If you also enjoy rock music, punk music and learning about the history and conception of these genres of music, this is DEFINITELY the movie for you!!

5890515,5,B00E4V0JAW,"This is definitely a documentary that should NOT be missed!!  Its' main focus is on Bob Forrest who was in the band ""Thelonius Monsters"", an L.A. based punk rock group that got to be very popular in the early 80's until about 199? ! Presently, alot of people have seen him on Dr. Drew Pinsky's ""Celebrity Rehab"" that went on for about 5years and also, ""Sober House"", a follow-up to ""Celebrity Rehab"". The reason I loved this piece, is because way before ""Celebrity Rehab"", Bob was a crazy-ass alcoholic and drug addict. He grew up reading lots about people like Lenny Bruce, William Burroughs, Jack Keruac (Sorry-I can't spell his last name! lol) along with poetry, etc. and really loved the whole L.A. based musical community and wanted to be right in the thick of it. He said on the documentary that ""at 13, I wanted to shoot up heroin. I wanted to be a drug addict"" because he felt that most of the people who were creative were junkies! So, eventually that's exactly what happened to him! (be careful what you wish for) and this is the story of his journey from an incredibly serious addiction to his remarkable recovery. It's an extremely engaging doc, lots of musicians are interviewed that knew him and/or were in the band with him and spoke about how everyone believed he would probably end up dead from an O.D. Bob was arrested for something and spent some time in L.A. county jail, which he said, ""jail saved my life"". I really love how honest he is with ALL who seek his help and honest about himself and all of the embarrassing, out of control episodes he was involved in. His love, selflessness and honesty shine through the entire documentary and I believe he's saving lives by just being himself, telling his story, sharing his own faults and he possesses an uncanny talent of communicating with people that is sincere and open, without any judgement. People listen because he's ""been there"". I don't want to say much more because you really ought to check this story out! It's sad, it's happy, it's difficult to watch in some places, but that's life.",1432598400,4,2066,4.629427792915531

5890521,5,B00E4V0JAW,I've always loved Bob's music in by myself was very much in the center of the late 80s early 90s Los Angeles music scene. I had known that he had gotten sober because I would see him occasionally in the background of the celebrity rehab television show. But more on a personal note he has saved a few of my closest friends from themselves that I shall  nameless. One can't not but love the man. But I was totally blown out of the water fact that I had no realization that they made a documentary film about which is crazy because I am very good friends with all of his very close friends. I guess they just expected that I should know they made this film anyway. This film offers hope to anyone with any type of addiction and mixes it with very interesting insights of the extraordinary musicians from Jane's addiction to Red hot chili peppers to But Hole Surfers. On top of everything else that is great in this film is to hear and see early THelonious monster and bicycle thief and clips. This is a great example of getting a persons soul back through the deepest levels of addiction and coming out on top. And thus proving that addiction recovery is extremely possible even way outside the lines of the AA method that absolutely does not work for some people. This is perhaps the most positive uplifting film I have seen in a very very long time. Love ya Bob the Monster. ,1427414400,4,1375,4.3882352941176475

That's what puts Bob F in a league of his own; living and understanding the complexity of self-destructive addiction, and the limitation that treatment can only break the cycle, not stop it.  The addict must have that moment of clarity, or as he says ""the realization it wasn't going to end well"" and stop. The honesty of experiences he shares instantly creates a dialogue with fellow addicts.
Astutely he notes the current trend of cause and cure becoming one in the same;  a pill.  Funny how drug manufacturers make $$ either way.",1414368000,2,678,4.860869565217391

5890539,5,B00E4V0JAW,I ended up loving this movie -- At first it looked like the glorification of the whole sex drugs rock and roll stereotype - and those who live to tell about it - but it is a really compelling film and a well told story. My son is an addict and I was looking for some understanding -- And mostly what I resonate with now from Bob's story is the incredible force with which addiction destroys and takes you down. I'm hoping my son is able to rise back out of the deep hole he's in and rediscover his life and talents -- And I'm grateful that Bob Forrest has found his way through helping fellow addicts. Plus since the Chili Peppers and Fruscianti's solo work are such a part of both of my sons' growing up -- it was comforting to hear from them and seeing them doing ok too.,1410048000,2,773,4.125827814569536

5890541,4,B00E4V0JAW,"Someone in one of these reviews got all huffy about Bob and called him a name dropper. That is BS. His friends happen to be famous -- he can't help that. He's not dropping their names, they are participating in this film. I knew little about Thelonious Monster before watching this, and while they are not likely to become my favorite band any time soon, this story needed to be told. There's terrible behavior, serial relapse, and finally some hope. I wish Bob the best. He deserves it.",1408838400,12,487,4.545454545454546

5890543,3,B00E4V0JAW,Interesting. I love Celebrity Rehab and I guess I am just a little too young to know who Bob Forrest was back in his rock n roll days. So it was cool to learn about him and his place in the rock scene.,1405036800,4,201,3.697674418604651

5890550,3,B00E4V0JAW,"This documentary feels like a lively, slightly edgier adjunct to the whole Celebrity Rehab franchise, only this time casting Bob front and center as a sort of heroin hero. He obviously made a remarkable turnaround but he very clearly glamorizes (and maybe even pines away for) his past. Which would be fine if this felt gritty and 100% genuine. Maybe it's the conventional ""Behind the Music"" format, but it does seem a little forced. Details like a plastic Courtney Love over-emoting ""sincerity"" for the cameras don't help. You hear a lot  about how dedicated he is to helping others, but what keeps getting emphasized is BobBobBobBob and how strung out he once was. We get it.  I wasn't as ""inspired"" as other people were who reviewed this, but maybe I'm just too jaded.

In short, it's a fun (if predictable) watch, as long as you're not expecting too much, and if you don't mind being conned by the ""clean"" Bob as much as others were conned by the ""bad"" Bob.",1398211200,3,961,4.641176470588236

8601166,3,B00E4V0JAW,"Unless you're a fan or musician, this film's got a long hard slog to get to any information about recovery. The last quarter of the film is inspirational. He makes the point that it's the drug companies' greed that is pushing for Suboxone and the like to be used for getting off heroin because people sometimes stay on it for years --- addicted to another substance, while the drug companies rake in the bucks. Sickening isn't it? The opioid drug makers and prescribing doctors got people hooked, who eventually went for cheap heroin, and then get prescribed more drugs in order to kick heroin. Bob's got a point.",1495756800,3,613,4.685185185185185
