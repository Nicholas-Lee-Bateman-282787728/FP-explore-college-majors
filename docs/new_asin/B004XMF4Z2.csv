8447158,1,B004XMF4Z2,Not a Christmas movie.,1494892800,,22,4.75
8447159,1,B004XMF4Z2,"This is a political correct film from 2010 that basically teaches all paths are the same in whatever religion you choose.  The life lesson of this is absolutely nothing like the original Davey and Goliath which most of us today have seen on the wonderful Smile of A Child Network via TBN.  It does teach to respect all people of all faiths which is a beautiful teaching of Christ, however it makes Judiasm, Christianity and Islam appear the exact same.  It shows Islam as a peaceful, giving and forgiving religion, probably focusing on it more than any other religion in the movie.  In the middle of the film, the Muslim girl Yasmine explains Ramadan in detail and how great her holiday is.  She explains how her family is Muslim and how they fast from food for good reasons on Ramadan and how she is so nice because she is from a Muslim family.  Davey asks Yasmine at one point, ""Why are you being so nice to me?""  She responds, ""Because my religion teaches me to be forgiving.""  Yasmine explains that though she does not do Christmas, she celebrates Ramadan instead, where she receives a new dress and states, ""That's the best.""  Davey then says that in Christmas he and his family celebrate God giving His Son while he says, ""That's the best for us.""  They all state their religious beliefs and all get along which is great.  However, it is more of a world religions film on the religious beliefs of Christians, Jews and Muslims, rather than a Christmas film for children.  All three of the children also make a very unwise decision to go down a ski slope that is blocked off.  An avalanche ends up happening almost killing them, and in the end, I don't recall Davey repenting to his parents at all when it was actually his ideal to break the rules in the first place.",1450915200,,1771,4.5141065830721
8447160,1,B004XMF4Z2,"I would ditto April's review.  SHE SAID IT WELL!  . As my husband said, It is clever, but it steers our children in the wrong direction.  While the Koran says 109 times to kill anyone that is not a Muslim.  This video makes them look as if Muslims are very concerned for others.  I realize that not all Muslims are killing people.  However, teaching a child that any religion is okay is very much against the Christian Life, the Bible says that Christ is the ONLY way to God and eternal life (AND THERE ARE THOUSANDS OF US THAT BELIEVE IT.).  As a Christian, I know that Christ is ""always"" with me and it is the only way to Peace and Joy.  (inward peace and joy)  Therefore, why would I NOT  want my grand children to think all religions are okay.. I thought since it was written 50 years ago,it would be good.  But I did not realize that Islam was okay to worship in the 60's and 70's and that killing non Muslims was encouraged.  In 2014 we heard about little children being beheaded because they loved Jesus.  And other Christians were crucified and shot  I think it is OKAY TO OBJECT to teaching our little children that we need to be tolerant of Muslims who kill people because Islam tells them to do it.",1420243200,5,1209,4.292035398230088

8447162,3,B004XMF4Z2,"I was a little uneasy as it seemed to promote ""tolerance"" towards Judaism and Islam when I thought it was going to or supposed to teach about Christianity, the Bible and Jesus being the reason for Christmas. I found it odd that the Lutheran church made this when Jesus taught exclusivity that He is the ONLY way to heaven when He said,"" I am THE way, THE truth and THE light. No one can come/go to the Father except through Me."" Jesus did NOT say ""I am ""A"" way among many or ""A"" truth among many and that we all believe the same thing and the same god, so why can't we just get along? No. Jesus also said that He was the Gate and that all must enter through Him if one wants to be saved."" I feel uncomfortable showing this to the kids in my Bible study b/c of the underlying current of what I think their agenda is which seems to undermine Christianity's exclusive claims.  Yes, we should be loving to others of different faiths, but...it just felt ""weird"" the way they were presenting it. I thought I was buying a CHRISTIAN video, but I feel as if I really bought a Unitarian (all faiths are equal)/ pagan video instead. Ew. It gives me the creeps. If I had known that this was what it was about, I would not have wanted to give my money to it to support it; I feel that I wasted my money and was tricked/duped/deceived. Where and when did the Lutheran church go wrong?!...I did think it was cool, however, that the Muslem parent donated money to the Christian church though to show support. That was cool. :) I also liked the animals in the animation.",1405987200,3,1553,4.264406779661017
