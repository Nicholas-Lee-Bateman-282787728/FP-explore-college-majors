6577497,4,B00MGSTNFC,"My husband and I enjoyed watching these episodes when they were first broadcast on television, here in the USA. Even though the later episodes became increasingly 'dark' with less 'humor', it is an excellent series. It's good to have both sets, to enjoy this series again, The Early Cases, fullscreen, and The Final Cases, widescreen.",1429401600,6,334,5.090909090909091

6577504,5,B00MGSTNFC,"good buy at ~98.
English subtitles are for hearing impaired so you get captions for sounds and name of character speaking. Pretty accurate.
There are several extras; interview with Suchet, Suchet on the orient express, and behind the scenes.
The video and sound are great.
DVD cases are labelled 7&8,8,19,11,12,13 and housed in cardboard box.",1427068800,4,342,5.236363636363636

6577506,5,B00MGSTNFC,"The other day I sat down at the bookcase where I house all of my unwieldy collection of beloved DVD sets of British cozy mysteries [collected haphazardly over the years] and began to sort out all of the various incarnations of the Hercule Poirot sets in my collection, since the long-running David Suchet version of the series is now over.  What a mess!  I started to painstakingly list each episode/movie, got frustrated and left it.

A day or so later I was browsing on Amazon (where else?) and came across both the Early Cases set and the new Final Cases set that between them includes (in original UK order) ALL of the episodes ever done with Suchet.  The description on Amazon for the Early Cases set was tremendously helpful to me, as were several of the reviews.

It became clear to me that by purchasing two more of the later individual series sets, I would indeed have most of the episodes in this long-running (25 years) series.  I would still have a big jumble of various collections, with some repeats and two gaps, however.

Then I did the math and found that for nineteen dollars more, I could purchase the Final Cases set and have ALL of the episodes/movies, with the last 25 of them in that nice Final Cases collection.  I was delighted when my order arrived and have been happily viewing the contents.

Friends came around and we dug through the mess of my older sets to view some of those older episodes to compare with a friend's Early Cases set (recently bought on Amazon) [Yes, we are that nerdy!] and we were really surprised by how fuzzy, poorly-colored and incomplete some of the previously purchased DVDs were in comparison with the new collection versions.  When the new sets claim to be remastered, they mean it!  Some sound issues (background sound being so loud as to interfere with the dialog) were also cleaned up in the new collection sets.

I am now going to order the ""Early Cases""  set and will then have the COMPLETE (and concisely presented) Poirot series with David Suchet.  What took up a shelf and a half of storage space will then take up only about eight inches of shelf space, AND will be crisp, clear and in original UK order.  Super!

[I have bagged up all of the other various DVDs and have contacted my local senior center.  They are delighted to get the jumble of individual DVDs and small DVD sets, as residents can check out a few at a time to take to their rooms to view.]

I can heartily recommend both the ""Early Cases"" and the ""Final Cases sets!  The new book by Suchet, ""Poirot and Me"" (available here on Amazon as well) is a wonderful companion to these sets.

For a mega Christie fan like myself, these are all GREAT finds!  Well worth the money!",1416268800,55,2703,4.520576131687243

6577508,5,B00MGSTNFC,"David Suchet is a master. He plays this Belgium sleuth with such depth and intelligence it is hard to say goodbye to the final episodes. I have read Agatha Christie since I was in my 20's. Love all her work, but the character of Hercule is the one I appreciate most and will miss. This is such an amazing body of work and it is done with precision and intelligence. Hands dow the best detective series I have ever seen. I own many, and watch often. I never tire of the mysteries and how Hercule Poirot solves his cases.",1468454400,,519,4.252525252525253

So well done in everything from the cinematography to the casting, acting, script advisory, costumes, vintage cars, art, architecture, and historical accuracy.  So artfully done and a pleasure to watch.  Well worth the money.",1441670400,,320,5.489795918367347
6577518,5,B00MGSTNFC,"Delightful series - too bad it had to end.  We took a couple of weeks to watch each disc - sometimes we did all of them on one disc - other times we  did one episode until a planned TV show was ready to view.-  Having been to the UK  we like to watch most of the UK  vintage setting mysteries which Poirot is one of the best. filmed on location - we have spotted several places we have traveled to in this series.

We also watch the  FX special effects - costumes,  my favorites are the jewelry - and set decoration.  We did notice several of the episodes based on Agatha Christie's tomes we have seen by other productions.  All are excelent.

This production is worth viewing again and again.  *****",1440892800,,700,4.21969696969697

6577522,5,B00MGSTNFC,"My wife and I enjoyed movies and episodes very much.  We watched one almost every evening until we saw them all.  I expect that we will watch them all again after some time has passed, they are that good.  The only problem we had was that Series 3, disk 1 would not play on our Blu-ray machine.  It would be good if there was some way to get that one disk replaced.",1433203200,3,365,4.027777777777778

I couldn't be happier with my purchase. If you're looking for a cunning detective out to solve various mysteries like no other, do yourself a favor and get these. The stories, plots, and endings are unlike any other mystery out there or was!",1523059200,,399,4.47945205479452
8672138,5,B00MGSTNFC,"Excellent set for mystery lovers! Loved that these are longer mysteries based on the books. They are different in tone and darker as other reviewers have said. Hastings, Ms Lemon and Jap are seldom seen. However, with this set and the first set, you have all the Poirot mysteries. Hours of viewing pleasure!",1522195200,,307,4.811320754716981

8672141,5,B00MGSTNFC,"I'll admit it.
I bought this, and ""Agatha Christie's Poirot: The Early Cases"" for THREE reasons:
1.) To get all the episodes into a smaller shelf space.
2.) They are unedited, chronological order, Blu-rays.
3.) I didn't want to pay extra for ""bonus"" documentaries.*

Buy both Blu-ray collections, or, '""THE COMPLETE POIROT CASES'"".... on BLU-RAY!

* Update: While the two Blu-ray collections ""...Final Cases"", and  ""...Early Cases"" do NOT have all the bonuses that The
Complete Cases have:
Being Poirot (62 minutes), 19 minute interview with Suchet, 33 minute interview with Mathew Prichard (Christie's grandson),
Super Sleuths (47 minutes, a documentary on the series), David Suchet on the Orient Express (46 minutes), and, a behind-
the-scenes featurette (46 minutes), and another interview with David Suchet (19 minutes). It also includes a collector's guide
with articles by David Suchet and Mathew Prichard, episode synopses, character profiles, information about Poirot & Poirot's
obituary in the New York Times.... it DOES have the 19; 46; and 47 minute features; production notes by Suchet & Tim Curry.",1502323200,3,1110,5.404624277456647
