2306834,1,B0009OGEMU,"This is a Michael Moore type mockumentary. The camera work is shoddy. The storyline is predictable corporate conspiracy stock. Robert Mondovi is taking over the world through wine sales supported by one French wine expert and Robert Parker. They are all in league with those vile conservatives like Bush, Reagan and can you believe it... Adolf Hitler. The poor French wine makers are doomed. One Italian grape grower sold 75% of his vineyard to Mondovi and after watching Mondovi create a cash crop from the old vineyard, laminated his sale and blamed his misfortune on Mondovi.  Easily this is one the more propaganda laced films made since Reefer Madness.",1122422400,10,657,5.027522935779817
2306835,1,B0009OGEMU,"As much as this is an interesting subject with some historical merit,  this is by far the most annoying documentary i have ever seen.  the camera work is truly neurotic and extremely distracting.  The filmmaker either had too much to drink during the shoot or he was too cheap to hire someone who knew how to handle a camera.  Seriously folks, save your money and buy yourself a nice bottle of Bordeaux.",1122163200,10,403,4.555555555555555
2306836,5,B0009OGEMU,"It is hard to imagine that a documentary with such elemental production values, shot in jerky handycam style, could be such an incisive, touching, and powerful examination of the wine industry and its personae. But it is.

The story is of the nobility, the megapolists, the honest and stubborn traditionalists, and the tiny producers on the very margins of the industry. The culture of wine production, the interplay between producers, critics, and consultants is exposed in vivid detail. What emerges is the story of mega wine companies who, in loose alliance with some dominant American wine critics (who come across as alternately earnest and self-important fools), dominate the industry, not only in sales, but in practice--replacing traditional methods with newer Americanized ones, and in the dominance of a particular consultant, who spreads the same taste over the globe, homogenizing wines at the expense of uniqueness.

The heroes are the little guys: the small wine producers, the Mexican laborers, the tiny vineyards in Brazil and Argentina, and the traditionalists in Britain, France and Italy. The villains are the vapid and self-absorbed Staglins, the good cop-bad cop, bearded-clean shaven Mondavis, the MBA-speak infected French wine CEOs, the Quiet American naivete of Robert Parker and the Ugly American arrogance of Jonathan Suckling, and the oleaginous Michel Rolland, wine homogenizer to the stars. Micro-oxygenate!

This film has all the right values and will be loved and hated by all the right people. Coming from a background in a parallel industry, the portraits rang true. Enthusiastically recommended.",1121990400,16,1630,5.4603174603174605
2306837,4,B0009OGEMU,"This movie is a must-watch for anyone with an interest in wine. Being a wine professional myself, I know that it is eminently biased and Nossiter doesn't do justice to certain characters in the movie, that come across very poorly, and quite unfairly so.
Now, the general message of Mondovino, though overly simplified here, is a great one. It is therefore worth spreading. But consider it cautiously as reality is certainly more complex than exposed here.",1339286400,,455,5.0
2306838,5,B0009OGEMU,"First I did not buy this earlier because of the critical reviews which are unfair and not factual.  In my DVD I could read all the subtitles.  As far as documentaries go, it's great! Most documentaries I cannot wait for the ending, but this kept me intrigued the entire time.

The cinematography captures the visual beauty of these regions, and just that alone makes it worth watching.  Beyond that, the candid seens between members in the winemaking families is thought provoking and you can see their passion for it.

As an aside the documentarian juxtaposes their dogs with the winemaker or wine critic.  There was hilarious seen where Robert Parker is espousing something and the camera focuses on the Parker's bulldog who has a big fat frown on his face as though tacitly disagreeing.  Other seens suggest wealthy winemakes have uptight dogs while the struggling winemakers have very happy dogs.

2306840,1,B0009OGEMU,"The topic is super fascinating--the way the wine industry is today and how large ""wine conglomerates"" are attempting to take over the unique small vinyards.

The problem is the documentary is so disjointed and lacks a strong point of view, it just seems like a series of scenes mashed together. Plus next time get a steady cam or a cameraperson who can hold the camera steady. It was at times like watching a war documentary the way the camera would jump up and down in scenes and pan too fast or focus on something off in the distance while talking to someone in the foreground. I guess it was their technique but it didn't work.

Another problem is the pacing, it's sooooooo slow. This was a film in desperate need of serious trimming and editing. I also found the overemphasis on the French wine industry bizarre as this was supposed to be a documentary on the globalization of wine. Other than a bit on showing us what was happening in Tuscany, Italy, and the Napa Valley (albeit they only talked to the Mondavi family), where were the lengthy pieces on Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, Chile, etc.?

Mainly, though, what were the filmmakers actually trying to say? I think they were decrying these big winemakers who mass produce and standardize wine yet why not come out and say that? I just found it a jumbled mess of a movie.",1314316800,2,1338,4.589958158995816

2306843,5,B0009OGEMU,"Fascinating presentation of the wine industry.
One way, new technique, as oxygenation, give a ready to drink product, enhance by taste of vanilla graciously provided by new oak barrel, represented by Michel Rolland.
Another way, traditionally respectful of the terroir and grape, represented by De Montille doter and father, which accept the nature and her variations which need much longer ""elevage""  (aging) in cave to reach excellence.

After all this debate, it is interesting to note than Guigal, the great Rhone winery, did not produce Ctes-du-Rhnes 2008 as the year was not permitted to achieve his quality expectation.
I also reed in Decanter report than 2007 was a mediocre year in Bordeaux. Did the Chateau should not produce any Appellation to respect their client and sale their mediocre wine under generic Bordeaux label?

Under all this debate of respect of tradition opposed to respond to the demand of consumer.
Which consumer are able to accept than a Medoc should not be drink before 10 or 15 years of cellaring?
Producers know that. Media's will not tell you as ... their come the money, big money.

Today media report on reader - advertiser team. Reader wants to read a dream story.
It's not any more question of taste, only question of investment.
Big families are opposed to poor farmer which could never expect produce wine in another planet.
Some people protecting their land from developer to create or protect Environmental Park opposed to powerful money conglomerate which want to create more opportunities for their dreamer client.

This fine tune movie exposes us to various aspect and choice.
Did we want to pay the price and respect the nature?
Did we prefer buy ready to drink? ""Why pay more""

Consumer like vanilla, industry will produce vanilla.
Vanilla is too rare and too expensive.
Who care? Industry will produce new way to make product taste vanilla without paying for vanilla or better, without vanilla. Media's will describe as ""another layer of complexity with buttery...""

Medoc's, Californian Cabernet, Meursault... needs 10 or 15 years to be at their best.
Industry will find new way to make it ready in 2 years.
A smart move as these 2 years will give time to various Media to make many report, to sale plenty of advertising, industry will make a lot of pre-release tasting... and  increase the value of the product.

Thanks to all the participants and to Jonathan Nossiter for having exposed our choice.",1301961600,,2450,4.985294117647059
2306844,2,B0009OGEMU,"When I bought this film, I suppose I created my own problem  by purchasing it as a spur of the moment thing when I also ordered Bottle Shock. I think there was an extra link when I ordered the other movie and I just picked this up too because it was ""a wine documentary"".

I didn't realize it was really more of a propaganda thing with someone pushing their own point of view. I'm not going to say his point of view was wrnog, but the film is so over the top biased that it gets a little insulting. I did find parts of it interesting but as I said, it sort of loses any credibility along the way when you can see the bias in pretty much every scene. I ended up not finishing the movie because I was tired and will probably get around to watching the rest of it one day, but if I had the purchase to do over again, I would skip this one.",1284768000,2,836,3.940828402366864
2306845,2,B0009OGEMU,"Mondovino was interesting to me as a wine buff, but as a television professional, it was hard to watch.  I know that cinema v&eacute;rite films are traditionally shot hand-held in an informal style, but this film was shot so poorly that you could actually get motion sickness watching it on a large screen.  It literally looks like it was shot by a child with a short attention span.  The shots are filled with gratuitous zooms, shaky long shots, and close-ups that are too close.  The quality of the photography seriously compromised my enjoyment of the subject matter and to me makes the film seem like an amateur effort.",1284336000,2,623,4.7407407407407405
2306846,2,B0009OGEMU,"This documentary seems to be aimed at confusing and provoking the viewer into a certain emotional reaction.  But, in my opinion, only someone who is a newbie to the world of fine wine would fall for these techniques and I doubt that many people of casual interest in wine would be drawn to watch this documentary.  I've been a wine collector for the past twenty years and I am as concerned about these issues as the film maker, but I don't think anyone is served by such a confused and simplistic approach.  For example, I too believe that Robert Parker's influence in the business of fine wine collecting is of great concern.  However, the film maker hammers a few issues over and over again while failing to delve into many others, some of which would tend to mitigate in Parker's favor.  Why not give the man a fair trial?

For example, Parker does seem to like wines of great concentration that have been aged in French oak barrels and anyone following his reviews needs to be aware of this.  However, Parker has also exerted great influence over wine makers to stop fining and filtering their wines.  He's pushed for organic and biodynamic vineyard practices and for low yields based on more rigorous grape selection at harvest, which also tends to lower profits.  He rewards single-vineyard estate bottling and has championed lesser known varietals like the type that go into Chateauneuf Du Pape.  One of his favorite wines from that region, based on his reviews, is made by Domaine Pegau, which fits into his paradigm of low yields and non-filtering, but this wine maker tends to age his wine in traditional old wooden foudres, not small French oak barrels. This all runs counter to the main theme of the film because these things tend to help reveal a wine's varietal and regional character as well as its terroir.

Further, you can watch the entire documentary without finding out that Parker does not write for a magazine and does not run any advertising in his newsletter.  Further, before Parker began reviewing wine, the wines of Bordeaux were being sold based on the prestige of the brand names and ancient classifications that no longer had any relevance.  Parker took on this out-dated and elitist system by reviewing the wines of Bordeaux with no concern for reputation or classification and the result was often that a wine of lower classification and significantly lower price achieved a score that was higher than the big-dollar, big-named wines coasting on age old reputation and out-dated classification.

What about the hundreds of family owned vineyards and artisanal wine makers who tend small parcels resulting in limited production that do not hire Rolland and who achieve high scores from critics like Parker?

If you don't know any of these things -- and you are not told any of this in the documentary -- of course all of those who praise Parker sound crazy and Parker sounds like a nut when he boasts of being inspired by Ralph Nader, a consumer advocate, or having been shaped by his reaction to Watergate.

As to the internationalization of wine styles, the film maker neglects to mention that Parker himself does not review wine all around the world.  He has other writers reviewing wines.  For example, for all of the focus on Italian wine in the documentary, you'd think the film maker would have mentioned that Parker himself hardly ever posts reviews of Italian wine in his newsletter.  For years, Italian wine was reviewed by Daniel Thomases and in the past ten years or so, Italian wines have been reviewed by Antonio Galloni.  Both of these writers have railed against the use of too much French oak in classic Italian wines like Brunello Di Montalcino.

The film maker also does a hatchet job on Robert Mondavi.  He neglects to delve into how Mondavi built his company and he also neglects to mention that Parker has very seldom given a Robert Mondavi wine a score above 95 points, which is the rarified territory where trophy wine collectors become interested.  A lot of hay is made about Mondavi buying interest in Ornellaia and the wine subsequently becoming a big seller.  It was a popular and favorably reviewed wine before Mondavi bought into it -- that's why he bought it.  Then, if you've been paying attention, you've been told by Mondavi's admirers that he is a tireless and talented spokesman for his wines.  Doesn't it follow that he saw a great wine and knew that he could increase the value of his investment by using his talent for public relations to bring a fine wine to the attention of an even wider audience?  Is that a crime?  The film maker seems to indicate that it is, but his aim is scattershot.  He seems to want us to resent anyone who has been successful in the wine business, no matter how they have achieved their success.

The film maker also brings us into the world of what is essentially bulk wine making.  Firms that churn out hundreds of thousands of cases of mediocre wine.  Basically, supermarket wine -- the kind you would see on the bottom shelves of your supermarket's wine aisle.  Yes, these wines are completely unremarkable, have no regional character, are often sold under different labels even though it is the same wine, but this is all beside the point.  These wines never achieve high scores from critics.  If you're paying attention, which is difficult in this documentary, you might notice that the film maker does not make this clear -- he seems to want you to lump all of these issues together.

So, what about the other target, Michel Rolland, the wine consultant to the stars?  The documentary makes quite a bit of the fact that Rolland consults on a lot of wines.  Something like 100+.  This is also cause for genuine concern.  However, with regard to Ornellaia, which took up a good portion of the documentary, the film maker seems to intentionally confuse the chronology of events.  He leads us to believe that Ornellaia, in Ludovico Antinori's hands was a local style wine and that Mondavi purchased it, brought in Michel Rolland and changed the wine. The fact is that Ludovico Antinori hired Michel Rolland, Rolland was a consultant on Ornellaia from the beginning, long before Mondavi's involvement, and there was no change in the style of wine after Mondavi's purchase.  It was simply  change in ownership.

Also, there are literally thousands and thousands of wines out there and it is still pretty easy to avoid drinking the wines on which Rolland has consulted if you do not like his influence.  The film maker doesn't even delve into the many aspects of Rolland's influence so the viewer remains largely ignorant of the relevant issues.  This would demand a more balanced, informative approach, trusting educated viewers to make up their own mind.  Finally, there are plenty of wines out there on which Rolland does not consult and which are highly prized by serious wine drinkers, collectors and writers, including Robert Parker.  What role does consumer demand play in all of this?  Why not include some of this information to balance the documentary?  Kudos to the film maker for bringing up some important issues, but the absence of all of this info and the fractured, incomplete, and confusing style of this documentary makes it valuable only to those looking for easy scapegoats and simplistic answers to serious issues, certainly not to those looking for an education.",1267574400,16,7383,4.816019032513878

2306849,4,B0009OGEMU,"I didn't know what to expect from this movie. If you like wine and documentaries-watch it. The filmakers go around the world interviewing winegrowers and vineyard owners and asks questions on various subjects.  What I also like about the film is that it speaks about the different generations of families that grew up making wine and their differences of business and values. There is also segments about Robert Mondavi and it's move to France and how it affects the people of France.  Now I had to watch it in three sittings, it was a bit long and this is an amateur film so the camera work is downright annoying (jiggling a lot) but despite that I'm glad it's in my library and will watch it again.",1249516800,,700,4.5476190476190474
2306850,5,B0009OGEMU,"If Rolland-Parker have, in leveling the playing field (Parker's phrase), made all ""exceptional"" wine taste the same, why care where it comes from? What is the purpose of a label except to justify one bottle selling for 100+ euros? I understand supply and demand but nothing you rent should cost that much. When will they dispense with the pretense of corks and start using screw caps?

Some day we will distinguish where we are in the world only by a few remaining landmarks left standing to add local color. Everything else will be of uniform. Several years ago I stood outside one of the gates at Canterbury and turned to see three Starbucks. I felt as if I were part of a Lewis Black monologue. Go to the antipodes and you will hear the same music, eat the same food, drink the same soft drinks, and see the ""natives"" wearing the same t-shirts. You won't have to leave home. This movie is about one aspect of the growing sameness of life.

I stopped drinking wine when I needed a home equity loan to buy a bottle, but I understand the frustration of wine growers who can't make a go of it because their stuff doesn't measure up to an admittedly (by both Rolland and Parker) personal palate. Does the attachment of a number to a subjective assessment make it objective? I don't think so. At some point in this film someone declares he would rather drink wine that is not so good but that reflects where it came from than a standardized wine. Me too.

There is a strong element of politics in Mondovino, although political systems are really being supplanted by mercantilism. Rolland suggests as much when he points to his client vineyards on a world map and jokes about the Moon and Michael Mondavi when he dreams of vines on Mars. Please, leave it to the Lunatics and the Martians.

Watch Mondovino on a large screen if you can. My TV isn't small but between the unsteady camera work, subtitles (you have to admire a guy who can speak so many languages competently), and other print information flashed on the screen, I felt as if my eyes would drop out, like a pair of joke spectacles. And yes, watch all the dogs and the laborers.",1247356800,,2135,4.5090439276485785

It is also interesting to see the behind-the-scenes politics of wine.  The filmmaker has an opinion, but I don't think it was overly stressed as all subjects spoke for themselves; i.e., he edited the film, but didn't put words into anyone's mouth.

As some have mentioned, the camera work is terrible, but the film is much more about what's being said than about what's being filmed. Happily, the subtitles are stationary, so the shoddy filming didn't bother me much.  I'd recommend it for someone who, like myself, has a passion (or developing passion) for wine.

2306858,1,B0009OGEMU,"This is the ultimate hatchet job, infused with politics and anti-globalization rants, and oversimplifying complex issues. The camera work often looks like it was done by a 12-year-old. But substantively, the level of professionalism is far worse. The film seems deliberately cut to make melodramatic points and take peoples' words out of context. Anyone little becomes a hero, including folks like H. De Montille, who said he was ""content"" after 9-11.  Then we get what can only be considered smear tactics-- things like the digression to examine the Frescobaldi fascist past. Evidently, this proves their winemaking must be bad. Your mind should turn off now. Similar investigation into de Montille's past? Uh, no. Parker gets to talk a lot about farting dogs, but he can't respond to  Broadbent's unintentionally hilarious rant. If you're big, you're bad. Period. This incredibly stupid, simplistic and ultra-leftist view of wine is one of the great hatchet jobs of all time, not to mention overlong, incompetently produced and utterly tedious. A film that makes a crank like de Montille into a hero and Robert Mondavi, who risked every nickel his family had to transform California, into a corporate villain, loses its footing with its initial, childish premise.

Yes, the director is obviously biased against the Mondavis, Gallos and KJs of the world. Yes, he does ask some pointless, antagonistic questions and does take some cheap shots. However, listening to the Mondavis, Mothilie, deVillaine, Rolland, Braodbent or Parker talk is hugely insightful. There is so much insight from both camps...any real lover of wine will take quite a bit away from this movie. The filmmaker does a good job of showing that there are many people in the wine industry who are much more attracted to the glitz and glamour of the biz than they are attracted to the wine (a great example is the ex-CEO & wife who create a Tuscan villa in Napa, as well as the [...] who leads tours at Mondavi).

From the artistic side, I found the hand-held camera to become tiresome after the first thirty minutes, and the dialogue-free shots out the car window of passing factories to get quickly old.

The director's bias may be summed up as ""Big conglomerates bad.  Small producers good.""  But this film is far from a Michael Moore diatribe.  I found it to be a relatively even-handed, showing the inconsistencies and dysfunctionalities of small French producers right next to those from large, wealthy conglomerates.

Summary

The comments made by the director in the press are far more inflammatory than the movie itself.  Closer to a documentary than a rant, this movie will be an imnportant piece documenting our current peirod in history - a turning point for th wine indutstry.

2306865,3,B0009OGEMU,"For those who have not yet seen the film, I recommend it only to wine buffs and recommend that you FIRST watch the DVD's bonus feature, ""Quo Vademus?"" (Part 6 of the original made-for-TV 10-part series).  I think I'd have understood and enjoyed the main film better had I seen that first.

I found it interesting that, while most reviewers slammed the hideous camera work, it was not until I read the 18th of 18 reviews on Amazon (plus many elsewhere) that I found someone else annoyed by the mostly unreadable subtitles.  I could almost learn the several languages more quickiy than I could decode the pale-on-pale subtitles.

While I very much struggled to follow the film in many places (and had to replay many parts, some of them several times), found it too long and disjointed, sometimes boring, I still thought it worthwhile for me.  I enjoy drinking and learning about wine, live surrounded by vineyards, and have two family members in the wine business.  I did learn a lot from the film, including how much I still have to learn about much of the business, especially in Europe.

On the other hand, I found the obvious conclusion that the artisanal quality of wine growing and making are nearly swallowed up by marketing, technology, and profit to be premature and perhaps somewhat presumptuous.  The Mondavi empire has collapsed.  California is repleat with artisanal, boutique wineries that take (what we here in upstart California may presume to pass for) Terroir quite seriously.  Navarro Vineyards, in Anderson Valley, for example (there are many, many others).  Until I saw this film, I thought California's foremost wine consultant was Helen Turley, yet she was not even mentioned.  She doesn't just ""micro-oxygenate"" wines but works right with the soil, the plants, the clusters, and every aspect of what goes into making a wine unique, including, I daresay, Terroir.

2306866,5,B0009OGEMU,"Mondo Vino lives up to most, if perhaps not all, the praise it has received. Nossiter's range is remarkable, and he brings both talent and passion to the project. Much has already been said in previous reviews with which I agree. Certainly, for anyone interested in wine, I recommend the film highly, but it reaches far beyond that specialized audience.

Where one may find fault is in the overall polemical tone of the work. True, Nossiter doesn't editorialize in his own voice. He lets his villains hoist themselves by their own petards, and it can be revealing and entertaining to watch. But he is clearly out to make a point. He does this with great success, and I salute the achievement. But something is lost, artistically and philosophically, in such point-making. It could have been a great documentary; but it is still a very good one.",1134691200,14,844,4.780821917808219
2306867,3,B0009OGEMU,"This felt like a college video production on a much bigger budget... The content is, for me, inherently interesting, but the production was almost entirely on-the-fly winemaker interviews and following several personalities around their spheres of influence,then doing a relatively crude job of editinig it all together. There was clearly no script or detailed plan going into production, and MondoVino reflects that fact. It also appears to have been shot entirely on video, which is not inappropriate for this sort of piece, but the camera  work is not particularly imaginative or interesting, and it looks as though the color palette may have been reduced somehow in the editing process.

2306868,4,B0009OGEMU,An excellent (but long) documentary on the wine industry. Some funny lines about Mondavi Family wines. Beautiful landscapes of wineries in Europe and in California. You'll never look at a glass of wine the same way again.,1127779200,,221,5.0
2306869,4,B0009OGEMU,"""Mondovino"" is filmmaker and sommelier Jonathan Nossiter's examination of the politics and personalities of the wine industry that have influenced the taste of wines worldwide in the past 25 years. Some regard the rise of wine critics and consultants and the globalization of wineries as a boon to business, allowing more access to wine for more people and more profit for the industry. Others lament the ""Rolland-Parker marriage and the Napa-ization of wine"", calling wine conglomerates like Mondavi ""terroirists"", with their high-tech young wines and disregard for place. Nossiter is an opponent of the current trend toward homogenization in wines. But the film may be of interest to wine-lovers of all stripes, since it allows both sides to articulate its viewpoint and to talk about wine, on 3 continents and in 5 languages -all of which Nossiter speaks. ""Mondovino"" is too long and repetitive at 2 hours and 15 minutes, but it has been edited down from a 10-part, 10-hour television series which may have aired in Europe. ""Mondovino"" was filmed by Jonathan Nossiter and Stephanie Pommez with a digital video camera that is usually handheld. The camera jiggles way too much for comfort, and the close zooms on people's eyes are due the camera's inability to hold focus. The film's technical limitations do detract from its watchability. In English, French, Italian, Portuguese, and Spanish with English subtitles.

On the side of ""terroir"", wine as an ""expression of the personality of the place"" or ""somewhereness"", French vintners Aim Guibert and Hubert de Montille wax poetic and get philosophical about Man's relationship with wine. Guibert was a major player in the ""Mondavi Affair"" in the town of Aniane, France, where townspeople, environmentalists, and anti-globalization groups came together to prevent Mondavi from constructing a mega-vineyard nearby. De Montille speaks candidly about his wines and family, and is one of ""Mondovino""'s big personalities. Prominent figures in the corporate world of wine include Tim and Michael Mondavi, Garen and Shari Staglin, Patrick Leon -technical director at Mouton-Rothschild, Leo McCloskey of Enologix, the largest wine consultant agency in the U.S., and members of the Frescobaldi and Antinori families in Italy, who were rivals to partner with Mondavi in the deal that resulted in Mondavi's buyout of Ornellaia.

But the most interesting and controversial proponents of ""brands"" and the global market are Michel Rolland, wine consultant for over 100 properties in 12 countries, and wine super-critic Robert Parker. Rolland is witty and arrogant to a fault, but he's straightforward and rather funny if you don't take him seriously. He admits to imposing his own tastes on the world of wine. His solution to everything seems to be ""just micro-oxygenate"". Hundreds of wineries worldwide change their wines to suit him. And the man with the palate of gold smokes; his taste buds are fried. Robert Parker is less colorful, but more complicated. He speaks of the influence of the Watergate era on his thinking. He strove to dispel the conflict of interest in rating wines and monopoly of opinion by the Old World vintners by introducing the objective critic, with the intention of making wine writing more pro-consumer. His detractors would argue that Parker's intention was to help the California wine industry by rating wines highly that were oaky, as young wineries use new oak casks to hide their lack of ""terroir"". In any case, Parker seems to have replaced one tyranny of taste with another. Not coincidentally, Robert Parker and Michel Rolland, who are friends, have similar tastes in wine. When a wine is poorly rated by Parker, the vineyard hires Rolland to consult, and then the rating goes up -which looks an awful lot like a racket.

I'm not a wine drinker, so I'm not inclined to take sides in the culture vs commerce/ terroir vs brands battle. Some people will find ""Mondovino"" revolutionary while others will find it alarmist. Jonathan Nossiter makes astute and intriguing observations in the film, but I think announcing the death of diversity in wines would be premature. It strikes me that the wine industry is a victim of its own success. Improved technologies and increasing wealth have created a global market for wine. It would be impossible to keep up with the demand without young wines. And now consumers' palates as well as critics' have adapted to it.  Industrialization brought the same fate to many industries. But that doesn't necessarily mean the demise of small-scale, individualist products. There is normally a specialty market for them. ""Mondovino"" reminds me of the Scotch whisky industry in the 19th century. Single malts went out of fashion due to high cost, inconsistent quality, and small scale production. The patent still, which could produce whisky much faster than the old pot stills, created the rise of grain whiskies and blends. Blends are a homogenized product, marketed by brand as opposed to place. It was actually corporate buy-outs that led to the resurgence of single malts in the late 20th century and a subsequent improvement in the blends. Most Scotch whisky distilleries are owned by conglomerates now, who find no reason to abandon traditional methods of making single malts. They created a global market for them, and they own the grain distilleries too.

The DVD (Think Films 2005): There are 2 bonus features: Part VI of the 10-part ""Mondovino"" series, entitled ""Quo Vademus?"" and an audio commentary with filmmaker Jonathan Nossiter. ""Quo Vademus?"" is eclectic in theme, but focuses primarily on the idea of sprucing up young wines with new oak, a lawsuit against Robert Parker involving some Burgundy wine, and taste being entirely personal. If you're really into wine and enjoyed the film, you'll probably like the audio commentary. Nossiter talks about the people in the film, their reactions, and his approach to the subject. He does discuss themes of globalization, but avoids commenting on what the film means, preferring people to draw their own conclusions.

2306871,2,B0009OGEMU,"Don't waste your time. This movie has so many flaws, its difficult to know where to begin.

First, it is painfully biased. I'm not so offended by its anti-globalist message (in fact I'm very sympathetic) as by the fact that he is so willing to distort peoples opinions and statements to achieve his goal. His constant attempt to make a caricature of every interviewee he disagrees with belies the fact that he can't substantiate his view with credible discussion. Whether it be with the accompanying music, the camera angles, the forced pauses in conversation, odd questioning or what appears to be his flagrant use of editing to achieve his goals, you walk away from the movie thinking Oliver Stone and Michael Moore are unbiased. We can argue whether or not a ""documentary"" should be unbiased (and I would not take that position), but this is no documentary. This is pure, unadulterated propaganda. In my mind there is a huge difference.

Second, the lack of narration or other vehicle to provide context to the interviews is both confusing and, once again, an attempt to muddle what are important and difficult issues. Similarly, the use of the hand-held camera is confusing and distracting and in my mind is symbolic of how ""shaky"" is own views are when put up to scrutiny.

Finally, his obsession with animals not only trivializes the interviewees, but in one scene in particular reveals his vulgar, mean-spirited and culturally biased views.",1125792000,15,1447,4.946502057613169

The power of the press -  at last someone has pricked the  bubble that is the unholy alliance of journalists and big business, no where more  devious than in the drinks trade.

2306874,4,B0009OGEMU,"The second movie of the year with a strong wine-related focus, Mondovino (""World of wine"") is no clone of Alexander Payne's award-winning dark comedy about two over-served wine enthusiasts touring the Santa Barbara wine country in search of wine and women, never mind the song.

Although the Mondovino producers aren't loath to publicize the film's upcoming (July 12) DVD release with a blurb from Vogue declaring it ""A brilliant extended footnote to Sideways,"" the only real connection between the two movies is that they both have a lot to do with wine.

But you don't have to be a serious wine ""geek"" to enjoy Sideways, while I would assert that anyone who is not deeply into wine and wine-industry trends might find Mondovino an extended exercise in excruciating boredom. If you're sufficiently interested in wine to subscribe to this publication, however, I believe you'll find Mondovino very interesting indeed. I thought the 2-hour, 15-minute film just flew. My long-suffering bride, on the other hand, fell asleep in the middle of it and said it was ""interesting but way too long.""

Directed and filmed by Jonathan Nossiter, an American expatriate indie filmmaker who lives in France and loves wine, it's an extended non-fiction documentary filled with talking heads (who talk in at least five languages, most of them subtitled) and only the occasional wine-country scene, all of it filmed in a jerky hand-held-camera style that's trendy but that might foster carsickness.

In short, it's the kind of narrow-interest niche film that its cult followers (like me) will play over and over again, but so obscure that it played in theaters in only a handful of selected markets in the U.S. I didn't get to see it in Louisville until I was able to wangle a special videotape from the producers so I could preview the DVD edition, which will become available to anyone who wants it on July 12.

Mondovino's theme, briefly told, is globalization in the world wine business, and the tension between internationalists, ""flying wine makers,"" big-name wine critics, industrial producers and artisanal wine makers (some earthy peasants, some quite well off), expressed in quick-cut interviews filmed in an ""arty"" style that features close-up facial shots that linger on every wart and crease, plus lots of cutaways to dogs (including Robert M. Parker Jr.'s flatulent bulldog), an odd leitmotif that becomes almost surreal after a while.

Nossiter's method is more like Michael Moore than Alexander Payne, using selectively edited interview clips to nudge the viewer toward a conclusion ... he's clearly no proponent of globalization and admires the philosophy and effort of small, local producers (as, in fact, do I). But Mondovino is hardly polemic. Nossiter's editing clearly casts ""flying wine maker"" Michel Rolland as a massive ego; Parker as a suburbanite at home with his dogs; Wine Spectator's James Suckling as a languid sybarite enjoying la dolce vita with Italian friends; California's Mondavis as an Italian-American family turned multinational corporation; Napa's Staglins as Stepford dot-com yuppies, and wealthy Italian nobles-turned-winemakers as crypto-Fascists pining for Mussolini. But the slant is much more subtle than, say, Fahrenheit 9/11, and Nossiter leaves plenty of room for intelligent viewers to draw their own conclusions.

My conclusion: If you're looking for a hard-hitting investigative piece that asks tough questions and unveils the smoking gun, you won't find it here; nor will you be impressed if you're in the mood for a barrel-of-laughs wine comedy like Sideways. But if you're interested enough in the wine business to care whether artisanal wine making gradually dies out in a globalizing economy, or whether Michel Rolland encourages his client producers to make standardized international wines that mask terroir, or whether Parker and Wine Spectator accelerate the trend by promoting such wines, then you will find Mondovino well worth the price of admission.",1123027200,9,3997,5.28503937007874
2306875,4,B0009OGEMU,I personally enjoyed this documentary. It gives some insight into the wine industry and the politics associated with it. It is however truly a 'documentary' with no 'story line' and would probably be of minimal interest except to those of us who already love wine.,1122768000,,264,4.888888888888889
2306876,5,B0009OGEMU,"In this sprawling two-hour-plus documentary in which there is no narration, we see charming, sympathetic, sometimes cranky old French and Italian men who talk about the origins of wine as being religious and spiritual with each region linked to a specific taste, flavor, and character of wine. These old wine makers look on with foreboding doom and disgust at the new global wine makers who, catering to Americans' infantile tastes (""easy to drink wines"") and who favor oak to ""terroir""(the earthy tastes in many French wines)are changing the way wines are made forever. It seems the small wineries are being bought out by the big corporations, synthetic methods are used, everyone is creating a McDonalds Bic Mac wine that is predictable, doesn't need ageing, and caters to wine critic Robert Parker's personal tastes and biases (he loves the big California wines so the Europeans are emulating that model.)

The profiles of philistines, vulgarians, and other avaricious types are remarkable in that the director just let's them talk and reveal themselves. They are really like caricatures of villians in action films. To hear one wealthy family transplanted to Argentina talk about the indigenous people as being lazy for example is almost too much to bear.

The most touching part of the film is the relationship between an ageing curmudgeon wine maker, fully of witty philosophical quips, and his daughter who shares his sensibility. She tells her father she is quitting the big winery she is working at because it has sold out. Her brother, who has business leanings, seems hell-bent on ruining his father's legacy. This triangle between father and his daughter and son is what rises this film to the level of a truly excellent documentary.

One last bit of praise. The director, who interviews his subjects in the film, seems fluent in many languages: French, Italian, Spanish, and so on. Being able to speak his subjects' language gave him more access and this helped the film immensely.",1122595200,68,1994,5.073170731707317

8064123,1,B0009OGEMU,"This could have been a fascinating movie, an insiders examination of the various styles of wine and wine making.  Unfortunately it came out as a vicious, misguided political screed.  You have to feel sorry for some of the families such as the Naglins, Parkers, Etcharts, etc. who brought Nossiter into their wineries & homes only to be stabbed in the back.  What is really galling is that you can seen Nossiter smiling and egging on his victims, pretending to be their friend and confidant yet ridiculing them in the resulting film.  Nossiter could have made his point without the character assassinations, but he did not, so shame on you Mr. Nossiter.

Nossiter's treatment of Robert Parker and Michel Rolland is especially egregious.  The growers whose wines have received low rating by Parker have always despised Parker, but now they have found a shill to do their dirty work in Nossiter and his followers.  In the film we can see Parker explaining that he does not care about terroir or history or the winery's culture; the casual viewer would be appalled, but Nossiter does not explain that Parker does not care about the terroir, etc. if the wine tastes bad; I guess that part was edited out.  Nor does Nossiter give Parker any credit for breaking the cozy relationship between the British wine press and their comrades in the French wine industry.  Parker has been the great equalizer and has the most integrity of anyone in today's wine press.

Arguing about wine is a national sport in France, but Nossiter only listened to one side.  What a hatchet job Nossiter does on Michel Rolland.  Everyone I have talked to who has worked with Rolland loves him and if you watch carefully you can see how much he enjoys his job.  Rolland has always been innovative and ahead of the curve, but for that Nossiter had to excoriate him.  The whole standardization rap is ridiculous;  I have tasted Rolland's wines, and there is a huge variation between his wines, depending on the terroir.  If you really think his Yacochuya tastes the same as his Chateau Fontenil or his Bonne Nouvelle, then your taste buds must indeed be dead.

The movie is full of details that illustrate Nossiter prejudices.  For instance Nossiter makes a big deal of Rolland's smoking his cigarillos, but if you watch very carefully you can see a lit cigarette in Alix Montille's hand.  Nossiter tried to edit it out this faux pas by one of his heros, but a brief glimpse remains.  Watch carefully; there are a lot of other sleazy tricks in this movie.

If that is not bad enough, the movie is full of cheesy symbolism that would be right at home in a high school video project.  Watch this movie if you must, but by the end, if you half a brain, you will feel sorry for its victims instead of sympathy for the movie's political message.",1389484800,,2806,4.672097759674134
