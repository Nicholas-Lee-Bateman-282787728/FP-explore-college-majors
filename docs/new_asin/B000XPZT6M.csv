8229101,4,B000XPZT6M,"At only four minutes long, ""Undertow"" does not have to develop a complex narrative structure. The story, such as it is, is simple. A woman (Kellie Higgins) is taking a bath while there is a loud argument in the background. She closes her eyes, submerges, and ends up at the seashore. There is slightly more, and I don't think that revealing the rest would ruin the film for anyone, but I'll hold back just in case.

""Undertow"" is hard to assess for at least two reasons. The plot itself is not terribly significant, and the actress never says a word. Nonetheless, I liked the film, which does boast beautiful photography, especially in the imagined shore sequence, and I think it rather the equivalent of a poem, albeit one with images rather than words.",1196726400,,754,4.669172932330827
