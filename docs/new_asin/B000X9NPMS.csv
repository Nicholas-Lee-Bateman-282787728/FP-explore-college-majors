8227384,1,B000X9NPMS,"Here again is an "" educated"" scholarly attempt to slander Herbert W. Armstrong...who of course cannot defend himself beyond the grave. But the FACTS remain that he was a Humanitarian, Unofficial Ambassador for Global Peace and oversaw a vast effort to speak the Truth from the Word of God. God of course is still very much alive and needs no defense. Mr. Armstrong was a witness to the World Tomorrow that GOD will usher in soon or we perish in our own nuclear nightmare. He NEVER asked for money on t.v. nor was he a tyrant over the Members of the ""Worldwide Church Of God"". His successor is another story! Get the FACTS from those who followed GOD and NOT a silly man~as Mr. Armstrong himself often said! (The Philadelphia Church Of God in Edmond, Oklahoma is the rightful successor to what Mr. Armstrong stood for: The TRUTH from the Bible versus MEN'S teachings)",1395446400,,866,4.62987012987013
