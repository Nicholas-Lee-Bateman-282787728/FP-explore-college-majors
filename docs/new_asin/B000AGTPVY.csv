2388833,4,B000AGTPVY,"Dr. Jess Goldman's (Phillips) celebrating his birthday after 44 hours' straight duty at the hospital.  He gets a small box with an interesting amulet inside and a note from the woman who used to be his mother, Dawn Rainfeather.  She wants him to come back to the reservation to meet him and learn who he is. Though he's obviously Native American, he's been raised as a Jew since his adoption and that is the only culture he knows.

When he arrives at the reservation, he finds police crime tape and a mystery.  Dawn Rainfeather died in a house fire.  He goes the the police station to find out more and is told she was a drunken Indian who was probably smoking and fell asleep.  When he sees a gunshot wound in the post-autopsy pictures, he asks for the case to be reopened.  He's attacked and left for dead that night only to be saved by his Native American family and brought to the reservation to heal.

""Sioux City"" is a well done crime thriller with a message about hate and racial identity.  One interesting note, the Lakota rituals have been changed to protect their integrity.

2388834,4,B000AGTPVY,"A Native American boy given up for adoption at an early age, raised by a wealthy Jewish family, now a medical resident at a Los Angeles Hospital has been having nightmares about events in his early childhood. He gets a cryptic message to return to the reservation where he was born. He finds that his birth mother has been murdered and sets out to investigate.
Lou Diamond Phillips handles the absurd Native American/Jewish upbringing with a goofy charm that is really wonderful. As I was watching this, I realized how easily this could have been turned in to a heavy handed comedy-mystery for somebody like Adam Sandler. Phillips always brings a natural grace to his work. (When one of the Native American characters makes a leaden comparison between Jews emigrating to Israel after World War II and Phillips return to the reservation you can't help but groan over the clumsy analogy.)
Although I guessed who the killer was and his motive long before it is revealed in the film, it was still diverting enough to keep me interested.
A fine supporting cast, beautiful photography.
This is one of those films that tries a little too hard to tie up all of the loose ends of the story for the finale, and that is its only real weakness. It doesn't so much end as peter out.

2388844,4,B000AGTPVY,"Nearly every book or film, when possible, that I can locate regarding the past or current factual history even within fictional characters is worth unwrapping.

BTW, did you all know that Hitler ""had only to note the self-righteous nation practicing ethnic cleansing across the sea. Yes, young Adolf was inspired by none other than the good ol' US of A.""  Hitler's concept of concentration camps as well as the practicality of genocide owed much, so he claimed, to his studies of English and United States history. He admired the camps for Boer prisoners in South Africa and for the Indians in the Wild West; and often praised to his inner circle the efficiency of America's exterminationby starvation and uneven combatof the red savages who could not be tamed by captivity.""

An interesting epilogue to this essay is that European people, especially Germans, have come to love the American Indian.

What's the connection between Hitler's love of Indian killers and the German love of Indians today? [Always have since end of 19th century!]""

Elie Wiesel is right: the road to Auschwitz was being paved in the earliest days of Christendom. But another conclusion now is equally evident: on the way to Auschwitz the road's pathway led straight through the heart of the Indies and of North and South America.

Wounded Knee in the later 19th as well as again in 1973 was an event of horrible pain and destruction.  Even as late as the 1970's, Indian woman that delivered their babies at hospitals had the infant taken from them, informed the baby dies and the child was presented o A white Anglo Saxon Christian family to raise the child so not to be a heathen. The Native American Indian woman was then sterilized -

""The enormity of government-funded sterilization has been compiled by a masters' student in history, Sally Torpy, at the University of Nebraska at Omaha. Her thesis, ""Endangered Species: Native American Women's Struggle for Their Reproductive Rights and Racial Identity, 1970s-1990s,"" which was defended during the summer of 1998, places the sterilization campaign in the context of the ""eugenics"" movement.
  No one even today knows exactly how many Native American women were sterilized during the 1970s. One base for calculation is provided by the General Accounting Office, whose study covered only four of twelve IHS regions over four years (1973 through 1976). Within those limits, 3,406 Indian women were sterilized, according to the GAO""",1375574400,,3043,5.062

2388854,4,B000AGTPVY,First it must be said that what happened to the children torn from their families on the reservation was much darker and worse than this movie portrays. Keep in mind that they were torn from their families most winding up in diabolical schools where they recieved hellalish treatment or in cold families where treatment could be just as bad. With that out of the way lets talk about the movie which i find great minus the matter above. The acting was very well done all around. And i must say in a strictly respectful way the woman who plays lou diamond phillip's love interest is beautiful. The scenery in the movie is breathtaking in some places. And i must say the  song by charlie daniel's about brings me tears everytrime and keep in mind im not a big country music fan. The story is very well done.

2388858,5,B000AGTPVY,"""Sioux City,"" the Golden Award Winner for Best Theatrical Feature Film at the Houston International Film Festival, 1994, seeks (through a fictional story) to address contemporary Native American issues (within the constraints of a very limited budget), including issues and problems lingering from decades of legally and illegally placing Native American children in Non-Native American homes--almost universally without being told about, let alone taught about, their Native American heritage.  Other issues touched upon in ""Sioux City"" include on-going differences and bigotry in cities adjacent to Indian Reservations, acceptance and treatment of Native Americans living off reservation, the inherent conflict for Native Americans concerning staying on the reservation, where employment, ""health care,"" ""living conditions,"" education, and other social aspects, are limited in comparison to ""moving off"" the reservation.  This issue is particularly potent given the attitudes of most non-Native Americans, along with many Native Americans long detached from reservation life.  That is, most people just plain cannot understand why anyone would want to ""live on the reservation.""  The sticky misunderstanding of traditional Native American rituals and ceremonies, give-aways, crime, and ""tribal"" membership are also touched upon.

""Sioux City,"" then, is more than a murder mystery movie or a ""Native American Movie.""  ""Sioux City"" is a drama about socio-cultural differences that are applicable to both Native Americans (and fans of Native American movies) AND Non-Native Americans.  While the film does take the high road in dealing with the tough issues, it does so, I believe, in order to demonstrate the broader (i.e., more than just Native American) implications of the movie.  However, in doing so, ""Sioux City"" has become categorized as either a murder mystery or Native American movie (with a subplot romance story) is unfortunate, but not completely unjustified.  The primary reason for this, I believe, is because the producers either failed to realize what they had in their story, or they were afraid to ""get dirty"" and expostulate the important issues of the film.  As such, for most viewers, many of the issues I have just mentioned may or may not stand out when you watch the movie--especially the first time.

It is, then, no wonder that most viewers summarize ""Sioux City"" as being a story about ""A young Lakota Sioux, Jesse Rainfeather Goldman (played by Lou Diamond Phillips), who is adopted by a wealthy Jewish couple (Leah and Douglas Goldman, played by Melinda Dillon and Adam Roarke),"" and is raised to become a medical doctor. On his birthday ""he gets a cryptic message to return to the reservation where he was born.""  When he gets to the reservation, ""he finds that his birth mother (Dawn Rainfeather, portrayed by Tantoo Cardinal) has been murdered so Jesse sets out to investigate and prove that his mother was murdered,"" and along the way, ""he gets in touch with his cultural roots (and ""gets the girl"").""  Such a summary is completely accurate, but, because the film fails to really tell it like it is, it also fails to describe the rest of the story being told in ""Sioux City.""

As stated above, the placement of Native American Indian children into Non-Native American Indian families is a long standing and continuing problem, both here in the United States and in other countries (see my review of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Spirit-Rider/dp/B000CCD20Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Spirit Rider</a>, a similar film set in Canada).  Unfortunately, ""Sioux City"" presents what essentially amounts to as a statistical anomaly (in ""Indian Child Welfare""), rather than a realistic reflection of what happens to the kids when they are removed from their families--both on and off the reservation.  That is, very few (maybe one in five thousand) Indian children are adopted by a ""wealthy"" family, and even fewer are so completely accepted that they don't end up with mental and/or behavioral ""problems""--let alone manage to become medical doctors.  Moreover, regardless of the circumstances of their ""upbringing,"" approximately 90% of all Native American children placed in homes unrelated to their familial heritage end up ""going home to find themselves.""

WARNING: MY CONTINUED DISCUSSION OF ""SIOUX CITY"" INCLUDES COMMENTS THAT MAY BE CONSIDERED A SPOILER FOR THE FILM

However, while placing the character into a less than normal situation, it is the subtlety of Lou Diamond Phillips' (the star and director) presentation in ""Sioux City"" that strikes a chord in me based on real accounts.  That is, at the beginning of the film the viewer becomes privy to dreams (not ""nightmares"" as some suggest) that Jesse is having about his mother and the reservation.  In ""truth""--if one will accept alternative metaphysical beliefs--these are dreams coming to Jesse to forewarn him of what is coming.  Then during his birthday party he opens a box to find a necklace--incorrectly called in the film, and subsequently identified by Echo Bridge Home Entertainment and other writers, as an ""amulet from the Lakota reservation in Sioux City"" (more on this latter).  In a marvelously played scene Jesse experiences (albeit, he does not know this because he has never been taught what one is) a ""vision of his birth mother;"" or as some would say, ""A call to come home.""  The scene is prefaced by his ""adopted"" mother's fears (more on this later) and Jesse's ""need"" to re-read his mother's note.  Conveniently, Jesse has just finished a ""44 hour shift"" at the hospital that everyone--including Jesse--use to explain his ""vision.""  As the viewer finds out later, when Jesse seeks a vision, time (his birthday) and exhaustion (e.g. Jesse's shift)--along with mementos (the necklace) and prayers (the letter)--are part of the vision process.

Following this ""event"" in which Jesse ""passes out,"" his ""adopted"" mother says ""tell me what really happened.""  If this is not clear enough for the viewer, Jesse hands the note from his birth mother to his ""adopted"" mother while telling her ""...for the last couple of days, whenever I can close my eyes, I've been having these dreams and...and tonight something happened.  I don't know what...All I know is...,"" at which point Mrs. Goldman carries on about his work and being tired.  After mentioning that he has been ""given"" two weeks vacation (for sort of messing up), Jesse tells his mom not to take this the wrong way, ""I NEED TO GO VISIT THE RESERVATION WHERE I WAS BORN.""  [Emphasis added].  Within the peacefulness, albeit motherly worry, Jesse, like the vast majority of placed children ""needs"" to go home--a constant, harmonious theme in much Native American literature (and films).

At this juncture I must point out that scenes in ""Sioux City"" visually suggest that Jesse has been ""illegally,"" ""but with the mother's consent,"" placed into the care of Leah and Douglas Goldman.  That is, in flashbacks, it shows Jesse's birth mother guiding Jesse off the reservation (which back at one time made the following actions legally murky) and lifting him up into the arms of Mr. Goldman.  There are no other people around, and no evidence of paperwork.  After seeing the necklace and at other points in the film, Mrs. Goldman expresses her greatest fear, as alluded to above: ""That Jesse's mother will come back for him.""  I take this to imply that the ""adoption"" was not legal.

So it is, in the story of ""Sioux City,"" that Jesse--appropriately in a ""white BMW convertible--rides home to the ""Brown Rocks Reservation just outside of South Sioux City, Nebraska.""  (Why the movie refers to ""Brown Rocks Reservation"" is beyond me, because the fact is that their is a ""Sioux"" reservation, the Santee Reservation, 97 miles northwest of South Sioux City.  The only reason I can logically come to is based upon the fact that the entirety of ""Sioux City"" was filmed in Santa Clarita, California, and the ""reservation"" and city of South Sioux City were constructed by the film crew.)  Upon arriving (as I see it, in South Sioux City), Jesse finds his mother's home burned and learns that she has died in the fire, which happened just four days earlier (his ""birthday""?).  When he goes to the sheriff's office to get details he encounters typical police ""ignorance"" and then animosity.  After having his room ransacked because he foolishly stole an autopsy photograph, Jesse goes to the reservation.  For story line purposes I guess, he goes to a ""trading post"" instead of the tribal offices, where he meets Jolene Buckley (played by Salli Richardson) who agrees to take him to where his mother's ashes have been spread.  Not knowing any Indian prayers, Jesse recites a Jewish ritual--one conveniently ""Indian"" looking.  That evening several off-duty deputies run Jesse down and leave him for dead.  However, Jesse's relatives somehow ""find"" him, and sequester him until he has healed (and learned) enough to go on a vision quest.  During the quest, Jesse learns the truth--that the sheriff, Drew McDermott (played by Ralph Waite), was married to his mother and is his real father.  Sheriff McDermott is killed while attempting to kill Jesse.  The Sheriff's daughter, Allison (played by Lise Cutter) has meanwhile, found a matching necklace to the one that Jesse got as a present from his mother and is currently wearing, which makes it clear that her father has been trying to kill Jesse; but also makes it clear that Jesse is her half brother.  The story ends with Jesse going back to his adoptive family; albeit he starts working at the LA Indian Health Services and Jolene shows up to spend some ""quality"" time with Jesse.

As discussed above, there are matching necklaces involved in the film.  One is in the possession of his biological father, Sheriff McDermott, the other originally in Dawn Rainfeather's possession, and then given to Jesse.  As stated above the film, as well as written discussions about ""Sioux City"" all refer to the necklaces as an amulet.  While amulet's can be made in necklace form, they posses very important qualities.  First, and foremost, they are ""an object that protects a person from trouble.""  Amongst most Native Americans amulets are related to other sacred objects.  Moreover, most amulets are individually owned, having been given to them by a private beneficiary (often one's spiritual helper), and therefore would not be so casually handled or (mis)used as in ""Sioux City.""  Instead, the necklaces were most likely given or made in recognition of Dawn Rainfeather and Drew McDermott's marriage.

I have given a lot of attention to the necklace/amulet issue, as it is the least sensitive of the Native American customs depicted and discussed in surprising close to accurate detail (e.g., the vision quest).  I also dwell upon it because, for me, the necklace is symbolic of what most disenfranchised Native American children seek out first: some materialistic aspect of their culture, because that is what they have been socialized by their Non-native caretakers to value most.  Then there is the fact that Jesse leaves the second necklace with his half-sister when he leaves.  In so doing, Jesse can feel like a part of him is somehow staying behind.  Again, all of this is atypical of what usually happens.  Most kids going home to the reservation are lucky to find anything to hold onto, and their future is usually bleak--no rich ""adoptive"" parents or well paying job to go back to or utilize on the reservation!  Nor have I even touched upon the convenient use of Judaism rather than Christianity as the ""adopted"" religion.  But enough of my introspection; you, the reader/potential buyer need to really watch ""Sioux City,"" and see how much I have not discussed in this review!

I first saw ""Sioux City"" as part of seminar on Native Americans in Film.  At the time I enjoyed the film, but after some discussion developed some concerns about it.  I went on to get the VHS version (no longer available), so that I could continue to watch it and see it the complaints raised seemed legitimate.  While the DVD has been available for some time now, I have been waiting in hopes that a widescreen special edition would be released; but when it went on sale for $3.99, I decided what the heck.  I just finished watching the movie, and, thinking it was time for me to try and write another Amazon Customer review, decided ""Sioux City"" would be a good item to try and write a review.  As such, I hope I have been of assistance in helping potential buyer AND in broadening the viewer base for this very well done movie.

Technically, the quality of the DVD is typical for full screen format films.  There are no language or audio options, although there is a menu for selecting specific scenes.  There are also a bunch of trailers for other films.  Otherwise that is it.  I should also note that in 2007 Echo Bridge Home Entertainment released a triple feature DVD,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Steve-Martini-s-The-Judge-Sioux-City-Night-Scream/dp/B000RGSX0Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Steve Martini's The Judge / Sioux City / Night Scream</a>, that includes ""Sioux City,"" and I have no information on the specs of that release.  Amazon's listing give little information other than the Format is NTSC and there are allegedly three disks.  Also, while I have not done a review--mostly because I only own the VHS version--another movie that touches upon a number of similar themes (especially returning home) as ""Sioux City"" is&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Thunderheart/dp/0767812182/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Thunderheart</a>, which I can highly recommend as superior entertainment and ""educational.""
