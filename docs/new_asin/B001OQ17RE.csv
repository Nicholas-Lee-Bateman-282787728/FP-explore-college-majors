3731624,1,B001OQ17RE,"This is a talking head movie where nothing really happens except for people talking to each other or at each other. The main topic is alcoholism as John Pryce tells the alcoholic poet that AA is a cult. Then he goes and talks to Uma Thurman who has one of the most atrocious fake accents since Dick Van Dyke in Mary Poppins.

Then someone else talks and they talk and they talk and they talk. These are boring characters having boring philosophical discussions about alcoholism. This movie is less entertaining than hearing your just-out-of-rehab friend preach at you about your drinking.

As Jonathan Pryce says in one scene - ""I don't want to bore you with what you already know."" Sadly, he does. And so does everyone else.",1361836800,,725,4.65625
3731625,4,B001OQ17RE,"With their denial, their contradictions and their acceptance we can see the different paths of three people who meet in a story around alcoholism, and alcoholics. The description of the addictions and alcoholism revealed with the behavior of the people concerned by this disease is very realistic. It shows their patterns without mercy but with compassion. Every character is difficult to play but the actors manage to fit perfectly in their part showing us the best and the worst in them. Most of the dialogues are powerful and provoking. This movie gives us the opportunity of seeing  Jonathan Pryce, Paddy Considine and  Uma Thurman in a great acting performance. Their talents contribute to give us a good movie about a difficult topic.",1253059200,4,740,5.057377049180328
3731626,2,B001OQ17RE,"Short Attention Span Summary (SASS):

1. This is a movie adaptation of a play by David Hare
2. It centers around three characters
3. It deals with alcoholism and infidelity
4. But mostly it's a debate on the value of the AA programme
5. I would have fallen asleep, but zinc beds are too darned uncomfortable

Slow moving, rather dry British movie fails to hold the viewer's interest despite the efforts of Jonathan Pryce as a somewhat annoying wealthy businessman and Uma Thurman as his trophy wife.  Paddy Considine's character runs the gamut from boring to blotto to bewildered, stopping just a tad short of believable.

I've read that the original play is bewitching, but the magic certainly hasn't transferred to the big screen.

Recommended only as punishment for alcoholics and cheaters.

8331095,2,B001OQ17RE,"I don't care for plays that are made into film. They usually turn into a talky bore that is heavy on pretentious dialogue. This film is no exception. It thinks it is smarter than it is. I am led to question the old man's motives when challenging Considine's desire to stay sober. He hurls most of the rationalizations at him, but his intentions remain unclear. Was it all a game he played to bait his wife into having an affair, to test her loyalty? When Considine resigns at the end, the old man appears triumphant, as if the young man served his purpose in some bizarre manipulative game. Was Considine, the drunk poet, really a pawn in a larger game, or was he the true protagonist defending the disease model of AA and ultimately winning his sobriety?  I felt as if I didn't care in the end.",1516147200,,795,4.408163265306122
8331096,1,B001OQ17RE,"yes, it was that bad. uma's acting is painful to watch.",1500336000,,55,4.090909090909091
8331097,2,B001OQ17RE,"Relationship between Uma and Drunk Poet seemed forced and predictable.  Usually David Hare is cutting and Powerful.  Meh.  Jonathan Pryce was great, Uma was OK, the poet was unsympathetic and irritating.  This is not a great love story and I think it tries to play itself that way.  The theme about addiction and desire was interesting but just did not grab me.",1486598400,,361,4.758064516129032
8331098,3,B001OQ17RE,"Brilliant dialogue and script without extras or gratuitous indulgence.  You can feel the tension and underlying logic that dares to defy.  I thought the acting was right up there too, but I kept expecting the story to take a dark twist where it was all a set up.  I think it portrays what the addiciton is like and makes the viewer FEEL it.  And the metaphor of the ZINC bed, well played out.",1483142400,,392,4.328767123287672

8331100,5,B001OQ17RE,"I think from now on I should look at what other people like and choose the opposite.  I really liked this movie.  The acting was intense. You could feel the characters' pain.  I chose this movie because I liked Uma Thurman's work, how her characters are often a little offbeat.  This movie confirmed my belief if she's in it, the movie will be good.",1473292800,2,349,4.40625
8331101,1,B001OQ17RE,"I tried to give this movie a chance but felt it was too much. You could see where it was going and it wasn't good. I didn't finish it. Got bored. Sorry, I like the actors but...",1468540800,,177,3.810810810810811
8331102,3,B001OQ17RE,"This is a tough one. I enjoyed Pryce of course. But it could have been the phonebook, as they say . The other two just made it silly, none of it believable or interesting coming from their mouths because I don't think they understood the material. They only knew their view of an alcoholic stereotype.",1467158400,5,301,4.490909090909091
8331103,1,B001OQ17RE,"Just my opinion, but this movie is awful and stilted.  And it is written by someone who seems not to know much about Alcoholics Anonymous or addiction.  I can't speak for AA.  AA does not self-promote or recruit people.  It's up to the addict to come on their own and work the program.  Although there are court appointed people who are required to attend but AA has no part in that but they welcome anyone who wants to stop drinking.  The goal is to be functioning and happy and for your life to flourish.  Addicts are never cured.  They work the program as their medicine to stay healthy.  Just as a diabetic takes insulin.  There are no requirements to attend, just a desire to stop drinking.  They don't require any payment.  Just ask for donations at meetings to help pay the rent for the room and some other things like buying free literature to give to beginners.  It's not just about sharing your low self esteem, complaining, whining and just not drinking.  It's about using suggestions to help you deal with life and be happy.  The spiritual part is up to you.  But you use a higher power as one of the tools.  You find your own way to use it.  To help you get out of your own way.  Meditation is encouraged and that is well-documented as something that is very helpful.  This film makes no sense.  It's stupid, in my opinion.  Just idiotic.  Just intellectualizing something that is an illness.  AA helps people to maintain sobriety, it does not ""dull"" them or ruin their creativity, it enhances it and frees them to live full, happy lives.  There is a lot of craziness that goes with being an alcoholic and it gives you tools to deal with that and handle life and relationships better.",1409961600,2,1697,4.4852459016393444
8331104,1,B001OQ17RE,Thurman made this film painfully unwatchable.  I was fascinated by the ideas and thoughts but every time she opened her mouth I wahs cringing so I gave up.,1363737600,,155,4.535714285714286
