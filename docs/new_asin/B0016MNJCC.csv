She's the type of artist that would be liked world wide and it's a shame more people in America don't know about her. Her rendition of the superman theme is one of the best I've heard. The Michael Jackson songs ""Jam"" and ""Smooth Criminal"" she does  are so much fun to watch. All the songs in the native language are excellent as well. This artist is impossible not to love. You're bound to find something to like here as she sings everything from pop, r&b, movie themes, and opm (native language). You'll be hooked by her infectious laugh and smile alone.",1437868800,,652,4.4789915966386555
