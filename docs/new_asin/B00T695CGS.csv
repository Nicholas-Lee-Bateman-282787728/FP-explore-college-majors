7000886,1,B00T695CGS,"Both discs had poor resolution. Anchorman had slots that went blurry and jumbled. Anchorman 2 completely froze and had to be FF to move forward. Seems like it was a big scratch or something. Both discs were watched once and taken right out of the brand new package.

Hope we can get replacements.",1451001600,,296,4.584905660377358

8700532,5,B00T695CGS,Been wanting to watch Anchorman 1 & 2 for a very long time.  Saw this decided I had to buy it.  As everyone knows Will Ferrell is one of the funniest people ever.  Well as a 70's news reporter with crazy friends he's still incredibly funny.  He is an old fashion thinker that has to deal with women's new rights and losing his job in one.  It is so crazy you can't help but to laugh out loud.  An RV crash in 2 will make you laugh so hard it'll hurt.  VERY FUNNY and worth getting.,1524528000,,481,3.9479166666666665

8700535,5,B00T695CGS,"Anchorman/Anchorman 2 Double Feature

In need of a good laugh? These are the movies for you.

Not only do you get one hilarious Will Ferrell movie but you get the equally funny sequel as well. Will Ferrell, considered one of the best comedy actors in this generation, is surrounded by an all-star cast including Steve Carell and Paul Rudd. This hilarious double feature will knock your socks off with a joke in every scene that will make you quote the movie the next day at work.

Advantages:
This movie combo is one for the ages. These two movies combine to create some hilarious laughs for the viewers that will make you want to watch them again and again. The movie meets the requirements of viewers by making them laugh out loud. I think this product is for anyone who loves a good comedy. I think the target audience for this product would be teens and older. The movies are uncensored and uncut edition meaning some things might be inappropriate for young ears and eyes. With that being said I believe that this is a great buy for anyone with a sense of humor. Will Ferrell and this cast might be able to swing some people with a lower sense of humor into being a fan of comedy. This movie combo is full of laughs and has some high points for the humor of Will Ferrell.

Negatives:
There are a few low points for this movie combo that come to mind when watching these two, this includes:
 Dry humor
 Poor plot
 Unrealistic
These few things impact the quality of the movies but they aren't deal breakers. The dry humor makes it hard to laugh at a couple of the jokes but some people might find funny. The unrealistic part of the movies affect the plot making them a bit farfetched but can be overlooked if you find them funny.

Summary:
After considering all of these things, I would recommend this movie combination to everyone I could. This hilarious all-star cast couldn't put together a better movie and compliment each other in a better way. They have some low points that are easy to get past if you are a fan of comedy and Will Ferrell. This movie combination comes in the regular disk package or in a blu-ray package for the movie lovers that like the better quality. After everything I believe most people would recommend like I would and its a great watch.",1505174400,,2271,4.481840193704601
