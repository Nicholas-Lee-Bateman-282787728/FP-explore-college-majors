8314888,5,B001KF6FB2,"We all know that Giuseppe Verdi's 1813-1901) La Traviata (The Strayed One) composed in1853 is one of the most popular and beloved works
Ever written. And many people not interested in opera and classical music know certain melodies or orchestral parts., but this leads to a question
One may ask : Who inspired Verdi to compose such a beautiful and immortal music? The answer is quite complicated but I will try to make it easy , that many new Amazoon .com customers will be able to understand and appreciate La Traviata even more. I will quote from the forward
By George Marek former Vice- president of the RCA Victor Record Division to the Novel ""Camille"" written by Alexandre Dumas fils(son) .
The story is as follows: The heroine in Verdi's La Traviata Violetta Valery was originally known as "" Alphonsine Plessis ( 1824- 1847) she came
From a humble , poor home. She spent her childhood in Normandy working on farm chores. When she was fourteen she went to Paris and , left to her own resourses began to work in millinery shop. She lived with a number of students in the
Latin Quarter. At a public ball at which she appeared ,she attracted the attention of a rich man who installed her in her own apartment. Her rise then began. She changed her name to the more euphonious Marie Duplessis and became ever more famous, desirable,reckless and capricious .She flourished in a society which made important the perfume ,the jewe, the champagne Supper and the candle - lit salon. Between the grand monte a world of elegance , haughty and
Conservative and the petit monde , the region of the small citizen ,frugal and bigoted, there had risen the new world of demi- monde. This was mixture of intellectuals writers and painters , and young as well as older men of wealth. The women of this world with all their garishness,often possessed a certain refinement cultivated , no doubt , to please the men of breeding with whom they associated. Marie Duplessis was egregious
Among them. She was toll and very slender .Her face wore a melancholy and downcast expression , perhaps partly because of her desease but
Partly because such an expression suited the ideal of beauty than fashionable. It was only to be expected that Alexandre Dumas the younger
Son of the famous author of The three Musketeers should be introduced to Marie . They met ,they laughed,they drunk together .He fell in love with her and offered to devote his own life to her,She refused at first . She didn't want him to have a sorry mistress who spils blood and spends
A  hundred thousend franks a year. Later she yielded, on the condition that Dumas was not to spy on her and to allow her complete freedom to do as she pleased. Dumas idolized her . He thought Marie was a creature corrupted by a ruthless society .As a matter of fact she was anything but a repentant sinner. And he found out that she was constitutionally unable to tell the truth. Lying keeps my teeth white , she replied to a reproach.
In short Dumas was in depth the tune of fifty thousand franks. After few weeks of happiness his life became miserable.
He was poor  , and she was incapable of having mercy on her lover purse. Dumas decided to break with her and wrote her a letter which in substance he later reproduced in the book."" I am neither rich enough to love you as I would want ... It is unnecessary to tell you how miserable
I am , since you know how I love you . You are too tender hearted not to understand the reason for this letter ,too intelligent not to forgive me "".
His letter was the reason they parted for good. Shortly after he left with his father on a voyage to Spain and North Africa, and she soon met a
Certain Count Edouard Porregaux , who married her the following year in London. The marriage did not last long and on the tenth of February
1847 , one week after Marie death , Dumas returned to Paris. His short relationship with Marie Plessis must have made on him a great impression for he not only wrote a book, called The Ladie of the Camellias ( in short Camille) but also a play .The success of the play was immediate and tremendous . Soon after the play was published , Verdi asked his friend and French Editor Escudur to send him a copy. He thought the subject ""simple and tender"" On the whole the libretto which Francesco Maria Piave fashioned from the play is a faithful adaptation.
Verdi had signed a contract with the Fenice Theater in Venice ,and the opera was duly ready and was duly produced on the sixt  March, 1853 .The story of its failure and Verdi's laconic remark- "" Is the fault mine or the singers? "" Time will show - ""is too well known to need repetition. The present performance is one of the greatest this writer has ever experienced. Soprano Norah Amsellem sung a performance of her life time. Her gorgeous pianissimos , glorious high notes ,the most beautiful phrasings one can only imagine ,all this pure gold qualities recalls the famous Violetas from the golden age .In addition she is a great actress. None of the other principals equal's her voice and dramatic performance,but both tenor Jose Bros and baritone Renato Bruson are excellent performers truly involved in their roles. The rest of the supporting cast is a excellent throughout .The supperb Chorus  Ballet and Orchestra of The Theatro Real Madrid is expertly conducted by Jesus Lopez Cobos. Listening to this outstanding performance gave me not only great pleasure ,but a joy of repeated listening. Very highly recommended.

8314889,5,B001KF6FB2,Norah Amsellem's voice is amazing but her acting is even better.  Her role in the second act bought me to tears.  Renato Bruson sang and acted  the best Georgio Gremont ever.  I don't usually like it when the director chooses a modern setting but this one was very successful.  I was surprised to see nudity in an opera but it was done in good taste and was beautiful.  I would recommend this to opera lovers as well as non-opera lovers.,1237680000,2,437,4.4
