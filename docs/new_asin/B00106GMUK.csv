8237246,1,B00106GMUK,"This DVD of A CHORUS OF DISAPPROVAL came with Dutch subtitles which are unremovable, a fact never mentioned in the Amazon listing; DaaVeeDee, the suppliers, insist that I pay to return it and accept a 20% penalty for unsealing it - how else to discover the subtitling problem; the suppliers have been quite aggressive in their email correspondence and, so far at least, Amazon has not been supportive.this is quite simply the worst experience i have ever had with an Amazon supplier, in fact my first total rip-off.

8237247,5,B00106GMUK,"Written by the divine Alan Ayckbourn, A Chorus of Disapproval is an overlooked classic.  When naive Guy Jones moves to a seaside town and is lured by a newspaper ad into joining a community theater, the company welcomes Guy with open arms (especially the ladies).  Through a series of mishaps and misadventures, he is eventually awarded the leading role in ""The Beggar's Opera"", though things begin spinning out of control long before then.

As Guy, Jeremy Irons hits just the right notes as the melancholy widower skirting (pun intended) disaster as he discovers the thrills and perils of that theater phenomenon--the showmance. Anthony Hopkins is wonderful as the quirky director, with the luminous Prunella Scales as his unhappy wife and the supporting cast is splendid. Anyone who's ever been involved in amateur theater will recognize the characters, smile at the backstage drama and adore this movie, and non-theatrical lovers of British humor will like it as well.

Sadly, it's out of print in Region 1.  If only it would be released in Region 1 format, I could retire my tired old VHS tape.",1225497600,5,1098,4.978142076502732
