42423,2,0783112750,"If you're looking for something to watch on one of those stay inside kind of days, then this will probably fit the bill. Otherwise, its not a bright spot in the annals of war films. For starters, Dwight Yoakum was not only cast in the film, but cast as the battalion commander. Dwight Yoakum should never be cast in ANYTHING. The cast was unknown, for good reason. The screen writers, both for story line, and dialog, should hope to remain unknown, aswell. The uniforms of both sides were inaccurate. Particularly those of the wehrmacht. There was never any allied air cover seen, or heard. The gross insubordination, cowardice, and low morale depicted, was completely wrong, very disappointing to see, and a disservice to the real men that were there. The German artillery had no recoil, ofcourse, (although, the sturmgeschutzen cannon looked real enough), and had no infantry defense, (which would indicate that the GI's were several kilometers BEHIND the German lines.) And the 88mm rounds could be heard incoming. In reality, the 88mm round hits BEFORE the sound of the gun can even be registered. The make-up artist was keen on using dark eye liner, for some reason, which gave the affect of punk rockers, rather than dirty soldiers. The film left a lot of room for improvement, but I've definitely seen worse. The director made an admirable attempt for the budget he had. But, some historical issues could've been dealt with, with a small amount of effort and expense.",1515974400,3,1474,4.9
42424,5,0783112750,"Wow, I can't believe I waited this long to watch this, what all war movies try to portray but sometimes get caught up too much in the action, this was more the psychological side of war with enough action to make it a great movie, wow truly an unsung hero of a war movie. 5 stars",1515801600,,279,4.0
42425,5,0783112750,"This one really surprised me. It has a roster of faceless actors I have never seen before, and no heroic leading men or Hollywood cinematography.

42427,1,0783112750,"A really, really bad movie. I have watched every World War II movie I can find and this is definitely one of the worst. Over the top, cheesy acting...at times it almost seems like satire. Poor special effects, predictable and boring plot line, and interactions between soldiers and superiors that just cannot be believed.
I would definitely take a pass on this one.",1514937600,,365,4.809523809523809
42428,1,0783112750,"Just skipped through after watching the first 15 - 20 mins. Terrible acting, terrible portrayal of events. Just a garbage movie. If you enjoy good war movies don't watch this one. You won't be able to finish it.",1514419200,,211,4.578947368421052

42431,5,0783112750,"One of my favorite WWII flicks. I love it so much I've memorized most of the more memorable dialog, and I love the feel of the film. Shots of the trees swaying in the breeze and the pockets of fog and mud made me feel like I'm right there in the Hurtgen Forest Battle. Ron Eldard's portrayal of Manning is a convincing depiction of a reluctant grunt trying to survive the ""death factory""! The ending leaves a huge unanswered question about Manning's fate and Bing Cosby's ""White Christmas"" plays as a sweeping look at the rows upon rows of snow covered ""dragon's teeth"" made for a very satisfying wrap to a film I'll never forget.",1512518400,,630,4.48695652173913

42459,5,0783112750,One of the best warrior movies I have seen.  It presents war in all its ugliness and is honest to the realism of an ode to futility.  The movie shows how little life is worth when commanders order men into battle.,1502841600,,213,4.170731707317073
42460,5,0783112750,"I've been watching a lot of war movies lately for the first time in my life, really. I thought this one was excellent in its portrayal of the realities of war for soldiers involved in close contact with the enemy despite orders from superior officers that were ill advised and mistaken.  After the small group of soldiers (four men) that took out the German position that had heavy artillery, there were many, many American soldiers that immediately appeared. Why did these four have to carry this burden on themselves?That didn't make sense to me but a great movie, nonetheless.",1501891200,,579,4.848484848484849

42484,2,0783112750,Just a bad movie. Almost no character development. Poor dialogue. Battle scenes look fake as can be. There are plenty of good movies that display the horror of war. No reason to watch a bad one that does it poorly.,1500854400,,214,4.375
42485,3,0783112750,"Understanding that this is a classic film for all to watch, I thought it was okay and just ""okay"".

The acting isn't as bad as I thought but throughout the film all you hear is cheesy lines that every other WW2 Movie with an American military protagonist uses. The storyline isn't as diverse either. Usually it is a ""lucky"" guy gets to become leader, is in charge of some men, some die, get capture, and some live. At the end a ""unexpected ending"" occurs. Everyone has seen it and everyone is used to it.

I would say though that the battle scenes are very tactfully put together. The explosives, tanks, guns, etc... all looked pretty real and nothing out of place. The makeup jobs on the bloodied soldiers on both sides were believable as well. I probably would watch this in the background of when i'm doing something else, as it's not that interesting.",1500163200,,855,4.545454545454546

42488,1,0783112750,Why is THIS story worth telling? It certainly wasn't worth the time to watch it. Are we to take away that war is a waste of blood and treasure? Thanks for the obvious. The uninteresting dialogue perfectly expressed the preposterous premise of a misfit somehow being made to fit the occasion without ever undergoing any supportive inner growth. This costume drama would have been better as a silent.,1497052800,,398,4.867647058823529
42489,3,0783112750,I liked the movie but I detest movies that begin and end the same. I somehow feel cheated out of a creative opportunity by the writer. I also feel like the writer just gave up on the story and didn't know how to end it. I'm sure in their mind they felt it was some artistic way to finish the story; it is not. There are too many movies that do that and this one happened to be the 2nd in a row that I viewed.,1496275200,,408,3.755813953488372

The movie tries much to hard to be dark and serious which is fine, but then ruins everything with god awful acting. Almost no accurate battlefield movements and if they add any more shaky cam and cut aways to hide the fact that their extras can't seem to do anything realistically, including dying, then we might as well be watching a Liam Nielsen movie.",1489795200,,440,4.653846153846154

Some of the money spent on a large cast of B actors would have much better spent on military advisers for the scriptwriters.  The Battle of the Hurtgen Forest, and the sacrifices of the 28th Infantry Division, PA National Guard (""The Bloody Bucket"") deserve a great movie.  This isn't it.",1488412800,,524,4.865168539325842

42545,2,0783112750,"Just an OK movie.  I thought it would be better based on the reviews, and it was almost a good movie.  They obviously had a decent budget for the movie, and they had an OK story to work with, but unfortunately the movie had a terrible script, probably no military advisors, was loaded with every WWII stereotype, and had ho-hum actors (you couldn't get anyone better than Dwight Yoakam?).  Call me picky, but there were also these annoying little things that irked me as cheap, sloppy lack of details; some of the helmets of the main characters had obvious paint-overs from previous movies that the props department cut corners on (and don't tell me it was subtle realism to reflect the reuse of helmets from other units).  Also, Dwight Yoakam's map at about 30 minutes into the movie looked like a silly 8th grade art project.  Really?  The props department couldn't jump on eBay and get a vintage Army grid map for $30?  The movie came close, but just missed on a lot of points.  The ending was a little corny too, trying too hard to be ironic.",1487548800,4,1046,4.526595744680851
42546,3,0783112750,lol they don't just make Privates into Lieutenants. They certainly don't give soldiers postions of power when they don't want it.

As far as historical accuracy and such, pretty close, but unless you are a total WW2 freak, why would you care?

They were a Pennsylvania National Guard unit with members from all over the United States. The red patch on some  of the uniforms was a red shape like a sort of milk can.  The Germans had such a hard time fighting this division and the losses on both sides was horrendous.  The Germans named this division, The Bloody Bucket Division.  The division due to the officers in charge lost roughly 150% in dead, wounded, POW, desertion.  Finally the division was pulled back for what the commander called R &R, meaning rest and relaxation.  They dragged their butts south toward Bastogne.  That was on December 14-15,1944.  On December 16, the Germans attacked and almost finished the job of totally destroying this fine division.

43095,5,0783112750,"This is a powerful, gritty, realistic film about what men actually experience in combat and the horrors they must deal with.  It portrays well the reality of what the battle of the Hurtgen Forest was like during the fall of 1944 as American troops pressed on into Germany.  Far too many young men died for what was later judged to be a poorly planned offensive.  The film leaves the viewer with an appreciation of the sense of hopelessness and resignation that so many troops there must have felt as they continually pressed forward under heavy fire and through minefields while suffering horrendous casualties.  Entire units were simply wiped out.  You come away with an appreciation of the sacrifice that so many young Americans made that fall as well as a sense of the horrible slaughter and waste of young lives that is war.  The film's protagonist, who starts out hoping merely to survive and make it home, ends up showing great initiative and courage in spite of himself.  I now appreciate what a great sacrifice the men who fought in the Hurtgen Forest actually made.

The attempt at authenticity was what was lacking. The uniforms worn by the American soldier did not ring true to me.  Something about them was off putting. In addition, the main battle scene, featuring  the German artillery and tank explosions just seemed too fake.  I realize this probably was a movie that didn't have a large budget and that showed. It did tell a story about a major effort on the part of the Allies to bring the war to an end as soon as possible.  I will say that even though this picture won't win any awards, it did present a portrayal of the futility of war in general and how many lives are wasted and ruined in the pursuit of victory at all costs.",1476144000,,851,4.234567901234568

43219,5,0783112750,"When Trumpets Fade documents one aspect of the Second World War that is tragically ironic. For some reason or other, Supreme Headquarters of the Allied Expeditionary Force (SHAEF) was hypnotized with the Hurtgrn Forest, as the Allies were in World War I. Though it seemed as if it was a logical way to enter Central Germany -- after all it was one of the most direct routes -- it turned out that the briar and tree-entangled route was one logjam after another. At each logjam, the casualty lists just piled up. And, when they finally breached the Siegfried Line and marched toward Colmar, the Americans left behind about 28,000 dead and thousands more wounded. The battle was joined in September 1944 and last five months.

The battle was one of those where the lifespan of a frontline soldier was sometimes measured in hours. Indeed, an ""old man,"" or veteran in this campaign, was someone who survived a week or two. In other theaters of the war, vets were those who landed on the beaches of Normanday and fought for nearly a year until V-E Day was proclaimed. In contrast, the Hurtgen was considered a meat grinder where a soldier could start out a private on Sunday and by Wednesday be a lieutenant thanks to the fact that the soldier had survived that long.

Ron Eldard gives a stark portrayal as a soldier who didn't want to be there, but was forced to be by circumstance. Time after time, he survived while everyone around him was killed or wounded. At one point, someone asks where his platoon is and he indicates that he is it. The average platoon in World War II was about 50 men.

All he wanted to do was make it out alive, so he strikes a deal to take on a dangerous mission in return for the promise of a ""Section 8,"" or psychiatric discharge, from Capt. Pritchett. The only problem is that the captain and the now sergeant are the only ones who know and the captain is wounded and sent back. At the same time, the sergeant, who successfully prosecutes the mission -- not without lots of controversy -- becomes a second lieutenant. He is about to take his command of newly arrived soldiers into the meat grinder again, when he comes up with a plan to defeat the guns that mauling the troops. He never figures that this would be the time a bullet would have his ""name on it.""

When Trumpets Fade shows the futility and madness of war where nothing is right or moral and nothing is wrong or immoral. It is only kill or be killed, survive or not. Eldard's nuanced performance fittingly shows how war and insanity can be mixed up, put into a pot and come out a battle that no one wins.

Eldard's performance is a gritty portrayal of a reluctant hero who would rather be anywhere else, but he is stuck. He's the kind of person who takes responsibility and, rather than let others do the things that have to be done, he does them himself. His character displays a weird moral compass that ultimately let's his heroic qualities shine. His portrayal is quite believable.
The campaign for the Hurtgen was pyrrhic. Yes, the Allies did win, but at what cost? And, what was the uncounted cost of the Germans who never came home. The Hurtgen was as bloody and nasty as any of the dogged fights by the Japanese on scattered islands in the Pacific. If anything, the Hurtgen is an overlooked battle in World War II. It is far outshadowed by Patton's famed Run to the Rhine, the Battle of the Bulge and even the abortive attack on the Germans in the Netherlands at Arnhem.

Among the other good performances in When Trumpets Fade, singer Dwight Yoakam does an admirable job of playing the ""I don't care what it costs, just take the objective,"" battalion commander. The supporting cast is excellent, as well.  Realistically filmed, it is not an easy film to view, but if you do, you will have an appreciation of exactly why we shouldn't go to war, unless we have to.",1470700800,7,3860,4.513590844062947

The acting is fantastic by the entire cast. I love Ron Eldard's work (including E.R. and Justified as stand out comparisons). Speaking of Justified, Timothy Olyphant has an excellent supporting role. Zac Orth was also outstanding and I'll remember his screams from the 88's scene forever! Wonderfully directed and acted. You can tell they were really a team. Jeffery Donovan's scene was the first time I saw his work. It was so memorable that I never missed a single episode of Burn Notice just waiting for him to repeat some of that magic. Great cinematography and effects considering the date this was filmed.
The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because the director / script did play it safe with the war movie cliches a few too many times for me.

43371,3,0783112750,"A neglected area of the European theater is the fighting in the Huertgen Forest area on the border of Germany. Like the Pacific campaign against the island of Peleliu, it turned out, in hindsight, to be a large loss of men for very little strategic benefit. Wars are full of such fights.

When a movie takes on this sort of topic, it has to offer some balance that recognizes both the bravery and dedication of the men who fought and died there and an honest grappling with the decisions made by commanders to commit them. This movie doesn't do that well enough. Instead, it presents the officers and commanders as bitter, by-the-bookers. Sure there were lots of bad officers. But it's much more faithful, accurate and interesting to grapple with the campaign as a dilemma, rather than simply a bad strategic decision. Instead, the movie splits the grunts from the brass and makes the latter out to be incompetents.

I thought the acting was decent, and the war sequences are terrifying and consistent with accounts I've read of the fights in the heavily wooded areas on the German border. The film does well with presenting a soldier's reality on the front lines. But the ending is too predictable.",1467676800,,1199,4.759615384615385

The acting is good, and the emotional toll of war is easily seen in the growing desperation and exhaustion of the characters. This movie doesn't have a happy ending, much like many battles fought over the years.

Lows: The orchestral soundtrack was distracting and inappropriate at times (playing a joyous overture while people are blowing up seemed tacky). The uniforms aren't period-accurate, but it is not distracting at all. There are also 10+ lengthy scenes of people just quietly walking or running through the woods trying to hide from their enemies. This adds to the realism, but got rather boring after a while.

43560,4,0783112750,"When Trumpets Fade is the story of a small squad of soldiers in France during WWII.  Going from a Private to Sergeant to Lieutenant in the space of three days and who'll do most anything to get out of the war including bargaining for a Section 8 (Psych Discharge), Manning (Ron Eldard) bucks authority as a matter of course until he is made platoon leader.

With German 88s (88 mm mortars) shelling the American troops and tanks afterwards, Manning leads a ragtag outfit behind the lines to take out the Germans.

Country singer turned actor Dwight Yoakam, with a face for radio, has the role of an arrogant Lt. Col who has the thankless job of offering more and more men to the slaughterhouse.  (For the record, Yoakam is not that good of an actor.) Timothy Olyphant plays Lt Lukas, a greenie, who freezes at the first signs of bad news.

This is an interesting story.  There's no great moral to this movie than the obvious.  War sucks the life out of men.",1463270400,5,957,4.497109826589595

43563,5,0783112750,"I think, overall, the  movie deserves 4 stars...I give it the fifth star for two very important points: this is a slice of the war effort. There is no sense of a hollywood formula here. It is what it is: WAR. Senseless, maniacal, fubar with no real neat bow or sense of closure at the end. Tomorrow will bring more of the same. Furthermore, we never see anything in war movies but the polaarizing characters: the heroic or the cowards, or those that snap. Again, the movie shows us something that was certainly present in the war, in any war, but is never brought up: those guys that are just trying to stay alive. We get a glimpse of that person in this film. And (SLIGHT SPOILER ALERT) he becomes a sort of hero...for all the wrong...or maybe right...reasons. Its gutwrenching to see that moment take place in the film. To see the sudden loyalty, the promise, the hope of some sort of redemption. This is not a Private Ryan, or other extremely gritty Vietnam movies we've seen: You don't come away feeling like it was an incredible movie...as well you shouldn't. Because it's war and there's not a damn thing good to be had in it.",1463184000,,1132,4.468599033816425

For me it was a powerful movie: good acting, good story line, good plot points that kept me engaged, and to me, believable scenes. For the record: I admire those who faced death and went forward into battle. I have asked myself many times, ""How did they do that?"" And I've often wondered if in the same situation, would I have done that or would I cracked up? In this movie a few did crack up and a few cut and run. What would you do if you were in that situation? I personally knew men who where in WW2, Korea, Vietnam, Desert Storm, and I honor everyone of them!

Attention to details, having a very good screenplay and emotionally correct acting has given this one the feel and the polish of a much bigger budget production. Acting is top notch.  I have no idea who else could have pulled off ""Manning"" but Ron Elrod does it indeed. This is a movie to watch and to add to the ""list"". Kudos to all!",1454284800,3,733,4.7109375

44308,5,0783112750,"This is the first WWII I have seen that shows the human face of the Allies struggling to get their ""objectives"" done drowning in a sea of their own blood.  It is really a  terrifying journey through the forest where everybody's mindset is that they are all going to perish in fight with seemingly random orders and poor direction as their company.  I like the surprising person who is a hero (in my eyes) and comes through the blood-bath saying ""nobody dies"".  Unlike the people who criticized Manning in their comments, I reckon him as a hero (as well as the previous soldier I described above (don't want to be a spoiler by disclosing his name)) who changed the course of the battle by his bravery and his instinctive leadership.  It shows it is not the ones who are considered cowards by themselves and by others that can't be heroes in their own right.  What Manning does eventually saves the day and he gets no accolades for it.  I think if ""saving my skin""leads to better instinct leadership that also might save the squad, then Manning is rightly promoted even against his wishes.  I found the realism portrayed here reminds me unfortunately of seeing the War in Viet Nam every night on the news while I was growing up.",1450310400,,1226,4.566210045662101

Coming from a history background and having studied WWII, i found the storyline to be very interesting. You do not hear much of the side of soldiers who just want to get out because they want to live. We always see war movies where it's all about the hero and what not.

The special effects were quite dull, sound was not really good, granted, shelling sounding sorta real (having heard what artillery rounds sounds like, hence my username). The main actor was really good but, really? Zak Orth as the supporting actor? Knowing him from the TV show Revolution, seeing him as a WWII American Soldier, was quite laughable. Some of the acting was horrible and special effects...eh. I was paying more attention to recoil from the artillery and tanks, but obviously you could tell it was all just sounds and pyro.

But it's like you took all that psychological realism of having a non-hero ""hero,"" but decided to make up for that karma and standard for realism with making the dialogue, command interactions, and battles as unrealistic as possible.

Ok ok no spoilers, but spoiler: men did not walk shoulder to shoulder 2 file deep when they advanced on enemy lines. They laid down cover fire, used smoke, had artillery support, used mortars, and stayed at least far enough apart when possible so that 3 guys wouldn't get shot dead with a single round. Also, if you can flank an artillery piece because there's not enough infantry around it... you do that with the entire company rather than sending a single squad around and hurling the rest of your men headlong into certain death. Also... while flamethrowers are cool, you simply don't use them to blow up artillery that's not in a bunker. Why? You use grenades or mortars which have better range and aren't heavy, and don't run the risk of getting shot and blowing up your entire unit. Also, if you're coming up on the back of an undefended artillery piece, you don't need that. You can just shoot everybody. Those guys would have been way more effective with submachine guns or even rifles, probably.

Also isn't anybody that the ""kill it with fire"" approach will set off a gigantic pile of ammunition? You're attacking a gigantic cannon that's firing continuously. Doesn't anybody stop to reconsider the ramifications of dumping lit fuel on that at 10-15 foot distance? If that stuff blows up and you're close enough to use a flamethrower, you're super-duper dead.",1446681600,,1737,4.786666666666667

It also demonstrates the ego and stubbornness that high command sometimes displays by insisting that its grunt soldiers succeed in executing a flawed battle plan rather than reexamine their own thinking.  The story line is mostly about a young man determined to stay alive, and makes good battlefield decisions to protect his own life.  This gets the attention of his command, and he is put in a squad leader, and then a platoon leader position which is the last thing he wants.  The movie gives a very ambivalent portrayal of this young man.  Is he a villain who would sacrifice his comrades to save himself, or is he a hero with an innate sense of battlefield tactics that ultimately saved many lives in this battle.

44908,4,0783112750,"A good Movie based upon part of the Battle for Schmidt in the Hurtgen  Forest on the German Belgian border area. The Battle of Schmidt was classified fpr many years after WW II. The American forces were chewed up by the Germans as unit after unit was sent into the fight  and shattered. In large part this was due to ineptitude of the American Commanders who really had no idea of what the troops were really facing. The following is a quote from the U. S. Army Medical Department, Office of Medical History, ""Headquarters, 112th Infantry Regiment, APO 28, U.S. Army, 10 November 1944, Report on Medical Evacuation, Let it also be made a matter of  record that only one method of total evacuation proved feasible: under the flag of truce; that this method was suggested to the Regimental Staff and later to the Division General Staff in plenty of time to permit the evacuation of all American wounded from the Schmidt-Kommerscheid [Kommerscheidt] area; that these suggestions were declined until it was too late to reach this area and these wounded were left by the withdrawing Infantry to be picked up by the enemy; and that, had the suggestion of a truce been adopted when first made, evacuation would have been completed with no detriment to the eventual tactical outcome of the operation.

45117,3,0783112750,"In the end, I gotta ask, can any movie really hope to portray the reality of a battle?  How can a script, or a director, or an actor, really  recreate such an experience on a screen?  When they try, as this movie does, I become aware that I am watching a staged scene, a bunch of young actors playing war.  A good war movie, ironically, uses the war as a backdrop, not the centerpiece of a story.  Even the highest budget flicks, like, say, Saving Private Ryan, can only hint at the true horror of battle.

This is a good movie, but it's not Spielberg and Hanks, and the battle scenes are pretty flat.  The story of the reluctant hero is far more interesting and deserves more screen time.  In the end, three stars, because I felt like I was watching a movie trying to be a,,,movie.",1444176000,2,782,4.272108843537415

It's not a mainstream, commercialized movie that would appeal to everyone.",1444176000,,338,4.745762711864407
45128,5,0783112750,"I absolutely loved this movie. I am a fan of war movies. I do, however, have a set of standards when watching a war flick. Unless the movie is a spoof or a B-rated movie that is meant to be made fun of, I like my movies to look and feel like I would picture war and the men fighting these wars. Equipment, weapons, artillery and motorized weaponry should look authentic. And the acting. If a guy cannot convince me that he isn't crapping himself when the shi* hits the fan, then I'm not impressed. With all of that said, When Trumpets Fade had all of the requirements met and more. Great acting, great scenery, and the look and feel of a battle that was fought by men and machine and all of the lives that were disposed of by bad decision making. Atrocious decisions made on the part of the brass to take that bridge. 24K lives fed into the meat grinder without a plan that didn't call for American men to get anything but slaughtered. Ron Eldard did a fantastic job as Private Manning. From the opening scene that shows Manning carrying one of his wounded comrades on his back, trying like hell to make it back to base, until the very end when there is a very similar scene to close out the movie. Irony would be a spoiler I guess. There are some great names in this movie and they all do a great job. No matter how many minutes they had on screen, they all did great. Guys like Frank Whaley and Martin Donovan. Dylan Bruno, Timothy Olyphant and a nice job by Dan Futterman. The fear and anxiety was ever present on Futtermans face, that made him compelling to me. Then there was Dwight Yoakam. Yoakams character was one of those high ups that made the decisions and he made you want to shoot him when he was doing it. Whenever he spoke I wanted to hit him. He just looked like a sniveling little rat. Other performances by this varied cast were just as compelling. Zak Orth played a new entry into the war, Warren. Warren did a great job of playing the heavy set new guy who didn't know a thing, was scared to death and wore it on his face, as well as the guy who, when needed, kicked butt with a flame thrower. His character is important to the story and to the main character, Manning. If you love or just like war movies, you cannot go wrong with this movie. Five stars, easily.",1444089600,4,2283,4.2626728110599075

45265,5,0783112750,"War at its bloodiest. That was what the GI's faced in the Hurtgen forest as they were entering Germany to Hitler's defeat. One of the battlefield promoted sergeants gets a raw squad of replacements and he has to keep them alive. He's confronted with rumors about his supposed cowardise in a previous encounter with the enemy and the general lack of experience of his men. Even at that he forges ahead and eliminates a battery of German guns that are devastating the assault on a strategic bridge. In the process he has to shoot the flamethrower tank on one of his men who has gone berserk. The other men in his squad are horrified by his action but the other man with a flamethrower goes positively berserk and wipes out the German gun crew. If you can't stand the horrors of war, this movie isn't for you. But if you are a WW2 buff then this is a must see.",1442275200,2,857,4.3625

45402,2,0783112750,"Why do war movies get everything wrong? This is supposed to be about the battle for the Kall Trail, part of the horrendous Battle of the Huertgen Forest in 1944. That was a very interesting, bloody conflict. However, in the movie, the terrain is all wrong (the Kall trail is a steep trail down into a deep ravine where it crosses a little stream before rising back up a steep trail--in the movie it looks like the Rio Grande), the tactics are from the trenches of WWI, not WWII (the soldiers all stand up together and slowly walk on line to get slaughtered), and the weapons are ridiculous (the German 88 and tanks are direct fire weapons, not artillery).
Not sure how making this movie with just a tiny bit of historical accuracy would have been so difficult. Is it because the writers/producers/directors are stupid, or because they are lazy, or because they actually do want to portray the past incorrectly?",1440979200,,910,4.658385093167702

45410,4,0783112750,"I thought I'd seen every WW2 movie ever made,well the good ones anyway so I have no idea how I missed this one. It's a very unusual movie as where the main character is actually not exactly the heroic type. He's not a coward by any means but at the same time he's in no great hurry to see any more action or risk his own life by doing so. However due the shortage of men, sergeants and officers he has no choice but to accept two field promotions which of course put him in the position to command troops. Once forced back into action he does do his best to keep inexperienced troops safe and does see much more combat. It's hard to review a movie without giving away much of the plot especially the ending so I won't say any more about that. This movie is based on a true story about a bloody and perhaps little known battle that took place after the Normandy invasion. Both sides stated that it was senseless to even fight this battle as it held no strategic meaning at all even if higher command felt it did. It's gritty and graphic, well acted, scenery is great, equipment, weapons etc as realistic as possible. I love a movie that takes your right into it from the beginning and that's what this movie does. From start to finish you find yourself trying to understand the main character while liking and perhaps disliking him at the same time. This is a very good movie and the fact that's it's based on reality makes it even better and more enjoyable to watch.",1440979200,6,1466,4.315217391304348
45411,5,0783112750,Most war movies give you action for action sake. This movie takes you into the heart in the mind of a particular operation that took place toward the end of World War 2. The Herting Forest operation was one of the most dismal planned and poorly executed Allied operations in the Western Front. This movie shows this on a personal level. It shows to how personal heroism energies from some of the most unlikely candidates making this a very believable war movie. The themes of how well this movie is written present themselves as an attractive way of mapping out the progress of the movie as it precedes. From carrying friends in the beginning to being carried by friends at the end are the kind of book ends the movie elaborates on in order to follow the cobat by the personal till it takes on the major players and how they died in the midst of this terrible operation. It is a thoughtful and provoking movie that helps you to understand what troops offered in this operation.

45617,5,0783112750,"Seems many miss the plot, as this movie questions ""what is heroism?"" and ""what makes a leader?""  As an Iraq veteran that has seen combat, I understand the feelings of almost every character on here.  Band of Brothers is by far the best war series, but Trumpets Fade is one that stands out since I saw it when first released and the many times watched it since  Unlike almost all war movies, I get something new every time I watch this.  Granted the filming is sub-par, and the acting is lacking, but the story line and plot are what has me coming back.  It discusses sometimes people are heroes out of necessity, but it does not take away from the heroism.  Leadership and responsibility are things one does not chose for themselves, but is often thrust upon them.  Though one might have low self-esteem and expectations from themselves, does not make others wrong in their potential and their abilities.  Becoming a leader sometimes requires the right motivation.  Being looked up to as a role model is not chosen by you, rather those that chose to follow you, whether you like it or not.  Sometimes those that care too deeply cannot be heroes, and those that act like they care not for others truly do to protect themselves from falling apart.

Not a pretty picture, not one where you got to know the characters, but a story which tells the horrors of war. Just like what the 101st faced at Bastogne and Foy with the exploding trees, Huertgen Forrest was a nightmare for the troops. However, it was one battle the Allies did not win. I believe remnants of the battle raged until Spring, 1945. The Battle of the Bulge was full of human mistakes and plans which succeeded. The German Army at that time were fighting to not be overrun, invaded. The Allies were determined to put an end to it all and had superior forces, with everything to back them up. It was a matter of attrition. Too many people on all sides died in that horrendous war, all because of a raging lunatic (or two). Those who wished to conquer the world and rid it of the Jewish people and anyone who stood in their way, needed to be defeated. What a shame. What a loss of a generation. What a despicable time. I knew a man who fought in it. He was wounded 3 times after he landed on Utah Beach, the second time in that bloody forest along the Siegfried Line. When he returned home, he swore he'd never ever complain again... and, he didn't. He died about 3 years back, but left a video interview of his exploits.

45703,5,0783112750,"I personally enjoyed this movie which portrayed the Battle of the Hurtgen Forest that took place just before the Bulge. Although it touched briefly on the human struggle to advance into Germany there is so much more to this true story of the Brave Men of the 28th Division of Pennsylvania, as the Germans referred to as ""bloody buckets"" referencing the RED KEYSTONE Division Patch. My Father was in the 28th Division in Company 'E', having joined in 1938 with the Pennsylvania National Guard and subsequently being Federalized at the start of WWII. The Division is more historically known for the ""Execution of Eddie Slovack"", a soldier that turn and ran during this bloody battle. He was the only soldier who was shot by a firing squad for desertion during WWII. The movie portrays the Lt. being 'shell-shocked' that took place during the first day of the push. From what I've heard and read there were many many more soldiers that suffered this condition from the constant shelling. 75% of the 28th Division perished during WWII. At the time of this battle they were being fitted with Green recruits to fulfill the companies due to the losses in the previous battles that led up to the 'push'! I have heard that the one General(Coty) that led the Division received a thorough 'arse chewing' from General Eisenhower after the battle for putting these men of the 28th into this situation as they were severely battle fatigue, understaffed from previous battles that led up to this confrontations, so much that it is said that the General 'passed out' in front of Eisenhower from the severe lashing. I had the opportunity of briefly speaking with one of the actors(Dwight Yoakum) while meeting him. He was very knowledgeable of the History of the 28th and expressed a sense of sorrow for these unknown soldiers and this important battle in the history of WWII. I have my Fathers Original copy of the 28th Division and every time I hear something of the Hurtgen battle and the battle of the Bulge, I reach for the book of the old ""Gray Mare"" and read the accounts of this controversial battle. My only regret about watching this movie, is that my father wasn't alive and with me to view this portrayal, naturally that I couldn't express to him in person the gratitude for his and his fellow soldiers struggle of the 28th Division during this battle and all others that they endured in stopping the Nazis from dominating the World.",1397088000,3,2428,4.7559241706161135

WHEN TRUMPETS FADE is one of the very best recent WWII films. It doesn't have anywhere near the scope of something like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Saving-Private-Ryan/dp/B008CBZX7E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Saving Private Ryan</a>, but it captures what it was like to fight as a typical ""grunt"" in Europe during the winter of '44-'45--and what it's like to fight in a war anywhere-- about as well as any movie can. Appropriately enough, its setting is the bloody, intense Battle of Hrtgen Forest, the longest single engagement in the history of the United States Army and one that, ironically, many of the history books largely ignore and that most experts argue should have been avoided altogether.

Ron Eldard gives a really fine performance as ""Manning,"" a reluctant draftee-type who's ""not about to take a bullet for anyone."" One of the best aspects of this film is the way it shows the psychology--and irony--of how Manning's higher-ups use him via a combination of threats, flattery, and promotions just to take one small strategic spot during the battle. Just about everyone else in the film--American or German, I don't believe that there are any non-military characters --gives a commendably believable performance, but special mention goes to Zak Orth, who plays a typical replacement who, young, green, and unsoldierly though he may seem, turns out to be a fine soldier, and Martin Donovan as Captain Pritchett, a typically ruthless, uncaring commander to the men in his company but a bit of a Private Manning himself to his own superiors.

Like most of today's war films, WHEN TRUMPETS FADE is gory, disturbing, and, by necessity (since it's about an unpopular and rather ineffectual battle), somewhat depressing. Still, the dialogue, battle footage, and various other aspects are nothing if not realistic.

45724,5,0783112750,"This very little known film took me completely by surprise and it was a very pleasant surprise indeed. Now, don't get me wrong, this film is quite nightmarish and extremely violent and I do not think there is even one single ""pleasant"" moment in it - but on another hand this is a rarity in recent cinema, a war film with a solid scenario, credible characters, well filmed action scenes, quite a lot of developments we can not anticipate and a really surprising, very strong ending...

Director John Irvin made earlier (in 1987) another excellent (and also little known) war film, ""Hamburger Hill"". In this one he did almost as well. As for ""Hamburger Hill"" he selected actors who are not really known (well, at least I didn't know them) and he worked them very hard indeed - in the film we can almost REALLY see the terminal exhaustion slowly breaking people who just reached the very limit of their strangth... As in ""Hamburger Hill"", the cast is exclusively male, the language is strong and the occasional jokes fly at the lowest possible level... However the butcher bill in this film is much, much heavier than in ""Hamburger Hill"" as here, the enemy has not only light weapons but also artillery and tanks.

Most of this movie was turned in a natural park in Hungary and the forest is indeed a very savage place, with enough fog and undergrowth to hide entire squads waiting in ambush, and enough steep hills and muddy banked rivers to stop in its tracks any amount of armor - which is exactly what happened in 1944-45 in the Hurtgen Forest and what made this battle so bloody for both sides. With only a handful of tanks managing to slip here or there and the positions of both sides being so close (sometimes only 25 metres separated Americans from Germans!) that air support was ruled out, the battle had to be waged as in 1914-17, with infantry and artillery... And the results were exactly the same as during the WWI - a long, exhausting, overextended slaughter.

Military details were well respected. On both sides soldiers carry weapons they really carried in 1944-45 - Garands, Thompsons and Browning BARs for Americans and Mauser 98, MP40 and MG42 for Germans. Hungarian army also helped with some of its hardware and as the result old Soviet M1939 85 mm anti-aircraft guns played in this film very convincingly the legendary German ""acht-acht"" (88 mm) anti-aircraft guns, which also happened to be one of the best antitank and infantry support weapons of World War II... Also, at one moment we can see a pair of Soviet-made self-propelled 2S1Gvozdika howitzers - once fitted with ""schurzen"" (thin lateral armor plates), additionnal turret armor and some camouflage nets, they can pass for the last variants of Panzer-IV which in 1944-45 would indeed wear quite a lot of additionnal armor and camouflage...

The scenario is not stupid at all and the ending is particularly strong. It is also a very good thing that although everybody curses and bitches all the time against the ""stupid army"", there is virtually no villain amongst the officers. It is true that the lieutenant-colonel and the captain seem to be extremely ruthless - but they are just doing their job and we realize soon enough that if they show any weakness their whole batallion will collapse and run... There is also one of the officers who ultimately will loose it because of being repeatedly shell shocked, but even then we can hardly see him as a villain... In fact in the whole film there is no villains or heroes - everybody is trapped in this seemingly neverending battle...

So, to conclude, this is a very, very good war film, which keeps a high quality of scenario and action from the beginning to the end. I am very happy that I discovered it and I am certain that any war films fan will be delighted after watching it. Enjoy!",1349827200,5,3818,4.709580838323354

45732,4,0783112750,"""When Trumpets Fade"" is a WWII film that provides a perspective of the physical and mental draining that is caused by war. This movie was released at an unlucky time because it had to compete with ""Saving Private Ryan"" and ""The Thin Red Line"". Subsequently it is not as well known. The film has strength by providing examples of some of the hopeless situations that a soldier can face in war, and the need to persevere despite the chaos. Conversely, there are weaknesses to the narrative, but I feel that there is a deeper undertone to this in terms of war eroding individuals, which subsequently makes them a resource, and their lack of story is reflective of this.

The movie doesn't do much to tell the true story of the battle, but rather focuses on Private Manning and his quest to get out of the war, no matter what or how.  I just didn't find the story all that believeable.  There may have been a few soldiers during WWII that went about their duties only to survive, no matter what happened around them.  But I think it was ONLY a few and I doubt any of them would ever have been promoted.  You need leaders to lead and he was not a leader.

I've read All the Way to Berlin by James Megallas, Flyboys by James Bradley, Ghost Soldiers by Hampton Sides and numerous Stephen Ambrose books to try to get an idea of what these men went through and how they felt.  Throughout these books you find stories of individual heroism and self sacrifice.  Maggie (James Magallas) led his troops and was promoted.  Dick Winters led his troops and was promoted.  It goes on about how they led and became leaders.  Countless stories of non-com's taking over during D-Day and other theaters when their commanders were killed or MIA.

45749,4,0783112750,"I picked this movie up years ago because it dealt with something I've had an interest in; the battles that took place in the Hurtgen Forest.  My fascination with the Hurtgen Forest derives from the absoluteness of the conditions and how men continued their struggles in a battle that never should have taken place.  Rather than the mobile warfare so typified in other WWII battles, the battles in the Hurtgen Forest were typified by relatively static warfare in terrible terrain that was reminiscent of the Civil War struggle in the Wilderness.

Rating wise this ones a solid 4 star movie.  The acting is solid, especially given how young/green the actors were.  All of the actors did an excellent job capturing the behavior and look of the troops who'd fought in the Hurtgen Forest (especially around 7 November 1944 when the movie takes places).  The terrain is between accurate and very accurate depending on the parts you're looking for (the woods and the mud are very accurate; the bridge over the Kall stream and the terrain around the Kall trail were inaccurate).  Historically the director and the writers did a good job telling of the 112th Infantry Regiment, 28th ID (the 112th was the regiment from the 28th ID assigned to capture Schmidt and Kommerscheidt) and showing the losses the division sustained (the Hurtgen Forest were nicknamed the Death Factory by American troops.  I've read of American losses being between 24,000 and 30,000 with German losses being similar.  Matter of fact, one battalion went in with 900 men, received 100 reinforcements, and walked out with 50 men of whom half were sent to hospital).  The weak point in the movie was showing the area around the Kall Trail and showing them attacking the guns (sorry, they would have been the responsibility of another battalion or the 109th Regiment).  This is significant because viewer not familiar with the battlefield could be mislead about conditions (having said that though, they did a great job showing what the battlefield conditions were like though).  I recommend this one for lovers of history or those interested in seeing the realities of what war is like.

45754,5,0783112750,"This movie, together with ""The Lost Battalion"", demonstrates that HBO excels at producing hard hitting, historically accurate movies, making the point that, in our history, we have sent some very brave men on a fool's errand, and they have paid dearly for it, while acquitting themselves honorably.

In this case, the setting is the Hurtgen Forest in WW II, and the protagonist is a seasoned private, with a natural gift for combat skills, but a primary focus on self-survival.  Events will thrust him into a leadership role, and that will gradually change his focus from self-survival, to the survival and success of the men he leads.

The Hurtgen Forest campaign was a needless meatgrinder that chewed up 24,000 Allied dead and wounded, and baffled the Germans as to why we simply didn't by-pass it.  This movie pulls no punches about the stupidity of the campaign, but like ""Lost Battalion"", acknowledges the individual acts of heroism and self-sacrifice that take place even when the circumstances that thrust the individuals placed into that position were misguided and avoidable.

This is a powerfully acted and executed movie, and stands in stark contrast to drivel like ""The Green Berets"".",1214265600,,1197,5.1179487179487175
45755,5,0783112750,"I read a few reviews of When Trumpets Fade recently and figured it would probably be worth the six dollar asking price. It most definitely was. This has become one of my favorite WWII films. I would actually place it ahead of The Big Red One, Saving Private Ryan, and Enemy at the Gates when comparing it to other modern war epics. When Trumpets Fade obviously had a much lower budget than the other films I'm comparing it to, but every dollar made it to the screen. This movie really has nice attention to detail, with accurate weapons, uniforms and vehicles (something that The Big Red One failed at). The acting is top notch, especially Ron Eldard's portrayal as kind of a selfish anti-hero. The film makers wasted no time with misty eyed nostalgia, instead focusing on a group of soldiers merely trying to survive. After watching so many WWII movies with a more patriotic slant, When Trumpets Fade is a breath of fresh air, and all the more believable because of its pessimistic outlook. I give this sleeper film my highest recommendation. The DVD itself is presented in its original aspect ratio of 4:3; it was made for Showtime. The sound isn't 5.1, but the stereo surround track still sounds very nice in Pro Logic II if you have a surround sound receiver, with plenty of explosions and clear dialogue. There are few extras to speak of, but the DVD is still a great bargain for the price.",1213747200,,1395,4.606425702811245

My Uncle Phil especially as he had fought in Africa, Italy, (Normandy Beach and The Battle of the Bulge) France, and Germany. This movie will make you feel a new respect for what many of the men in that war went through at one place or another or one time or another. This one battle made men reach down deep to give their inner strength to those around them. I have never been in the military but in my work and personal life I have been exposed to them all my life. Better yet I have stepsons that are Marines and exposure to them has taught me the code of soldiers. It is quite clear this movie will make you understand that code which when all else fails will get you through. I highly recommend this movie as a purchase.

45758,5,0783112750,"For me and many (if not most) other film enthusiasts, a film's story and plot - rather than the inclusion of ""A List"" actors (an arbitrary, usually temporary, and essentially meaningless designation) to its cast - is the initial draw (plus a good trailer doesn't hurt); as for rental movies, the reasons can be less geared towards the plot and more geared towards the wondrous aesthetic of bare female skin.  In the World War 2 film WHEN TRUMPETS FADE, viewers get none of the latter aspect but a very commendable example of the former.  It is an excellent story and screenplay with an engagingly ironic premise and an effective cast.  The setting is the Hurtgen Forest, a short distance from the Belgian/German border.  The battle over said real estate was a harrowing and bloody ordeal that inflicted significant casualties on the American troops, who expected a cakewalk following the ongoing German retreat in the wake of the allied liberation of France.  Instead, the allies found the weary German troops consolidated in well-planned defensive positions from which they put forth determined and brutally effective resistance.  The film actually closely follows the details of the battle (one of the longest in U.S. history).

In the movie, Ron Eldard stars as David Manning, the lone survivor of his platoon returning to the battalion HQ after a devastating battle and a harrowing incident which followed.  Instead of a brief respite from the horrendous ordeal, Manning is not only put back into combat rotation, but is also assigned as a squad leader.  Manning himself is an underachieving fatalistic malcontent without much interest or effort beyond his own self-preservation.  The Company Commander (in an understated but not entirely ineffective portrayal by Martin Donovan) has no illusions about Manning's character, but comes to recognize an unappealing yet practical truth: that Manning's experience (especially when compared to the inexperienced replacements who reinforce the mauled units) and his ability to survive are tantamount to making him the best candidate for the position (if for no other reason than by default).  Manning continually asks for an exception from combat duty, which is always and immediately refused.  Soon, he is assigned a squad to lead, which is reduced to a mere fire team after an unsuccessful attack by the battalion is savagely repelled by German artillery.  Following this latest debacle, the Captain makes Manning a somewhat remarkable deal: if Manning will lead his 4-man fire team on a seemingly hopeless assault to destroy the German artillery positions, the Company Commander will classify Manning as unfit for combat via a Section 8.

Thus, what begins with a suicide mission which the Captain believes will rid him of Manning and the requests for removal from combat duty, spurs an increasing cycle of surprisingly heroic though self-serving actions by Manning that grow in daring and peril.  Along the way in his Faustian bargain, Manning unintentionally displays the leadership, bravery, and heroism that he had no interest in possessing, even if the motives lack nobility.  It is an intriguing question of the nature of heroism: is its essence defined by motive without regards to results, or actions without regard to motive?  As for the characters, there aren't many that are very easy to like in a conventional sense, though you end up rooting for some of them.  Besides Manning's self-centeredness and disdain for authority, the Captain is an earnest but ineffectual commander, the new and unprepared (both in terms of training and psychology) platoon leader (Timothy Oliphant) utterly loses his nerve and mind after a disastrous attack, the Battalion Commander (marginal performance by Dwight Yoakum) is a rear echelon officer who reflects the upper chain-of-command's oblivion to the tactical realities of the battle.  Eldard may not be the greatest actor ever born, but he nails the role and comes off as rather believable - which is or should be the goal of an actor in a film.  Frank Whaley, Dylan Bruno, and Zak Orth all turn in solid performances respectively as a dedicated medic, a tough but jaded sergeant, and the brand new augmentee who transforms from being the platoon's biggest doofus to its most promising soldier through his harrowing experiences.

For fans of war movies, the budget is pretty modest (an HBO movie filmed in eastern Europe) with special effects and military props which might not be top of the line as well.  But the violence and gore are frankly depicted, and the terror and tension are palpable (this is the movie which prepared me for the unprecedentedly violent Omaha Beach landing sequence in SAVING PRIVATE RYAN).  There isn't much in the way of soppy sentimentality, though there is an argument that could be made for this film being one of the most realistic and best World War 2 films you never saw.  It is one of my favorite films of all, though this gritty and dark effort doesn't fall into the category of ""feel good movies"".

45765,4,0783112750,"The key for me in a combat flick is reality. historical accuracy, no cliches, avoidance of sentimentality and romanticizations. In the last few years flicks like Enemy at the Gates, Stalingrad, and especially Terence Malick's Thin Red Line do the best. When Trumpets Fade is smaller in its ambitions, production values and scope. But as such it hangs in there with these other achievements except for having a kind of epic scale. The relationships in the screenplay are more believeable than Enemy at the Gates -no romantic sub-plot- have no cultural obscurities for an American viewer -no societal war guilt to overcome like Stalingrad- and except for one brief scene there is no interplay of spirituality that one finds in Thin Red Line though that element is what makes Thin Red Line so resonant and soul shaking. When Trumpets Fade is brisk, direct, hugely existential, and as fatalistic as the other films mentioned here. The special effects are somewhat modest but fully appropriate and not lame in any way and with the exception of a few shots of the enemy tanks it all plays quite authentically. The main lapse in effectiveness is the opening of the film that is a kind of pastiche on a documentary. This is done to set up the historical context of the film's story. This 'educational' bit could have been pulled off better with a different choice of narrator. This film tells a harrowing story that condemns its protagonists to almost certain death or severe wounds, provides them with objectives that can not be reasonably achieved, and thus shows how unvalorous, how unexalted, how simply miserable, sadistic, and emotionally excruciating war is for soldiers. It really doesn't attempt tp glorify American patriotism that is the downfall of other recent large scale productions but actually beautifully shows the extreme pathos enacted between fellows in, as the characters of the film say, ""the death factory."" This is actually accomplished in the amazing opening sequence of the screenplay and mirrored less successfully in the denoument. In the end the subject is really the randomness of fate, the perseverence of the human will to live -and to die- when faced with complete lack of control over circumstances, and, with quite some poignance, the love of fellows for one another when faced with their unavoidable mortality. The historical battle depicted is a great subject for having been relegated to quite some obscurity in the annals of World War II history. And the producers, director, cast and crew rise to the opportunity to exercise their considerable skills with very little if any of the middle class sentiment that is the downfall of similar flicks that pander to audiences. It is a film making aesthetic that reflects some of the values that went in to a very few films from an earlier era, made much closer in time to the historical event they depict, and so chastened with a sense of reality not glossed over by a false need to be uplifting.

45766,5,0783112750,"This is truly a soldier's film, capturing in a microcosm of film everything which is horrible about war, from the disdain of the field grade officers whose lives aren't in danger, to the horrific decisions and life that the soldiers endured. A prior reviewer explained the inability to capture the reality of the bridge scene, especially given the budget of this film. It certainly caputures everything else about being a soldier and this insane expenditure of men's lives for no reasonable purpose.

As for the language, it's very mild by soldier standards. I spent a year in Vietnam, and the language we used was far worse, and used in almost every sentence. I doubt profanity emerged first with the Vietnam war, and it's probably been inherent in warriors for thousands of years.

The story itself focuse on a private who has to make an almost impossible decision at the beginning of the film, killing the only other survivor of his platoon, to prevent the man from suffering. It represents every impossible decision which soldiers have been faced with for centuries. War is not fought by civilized values, and this film displays that reality, and why soldier don't say much about what they did in wars.

The experiences harden the private, and make him willing to do virtually anything to escape the madness which was trying to advance through this forest, but he's such a good soldier that he keeps getting promoted, as he keeps surviving, despite his anti-authoritarian attitude and contempt for officers, the Army, and most things.

I really identified with this film. Unlike Saving Private Ryan, it doesn't have the huge flaw of a caricature (the corporal clerk who wastes so much time in that film). Everyone in When Trumpets Fade is very real. The horrors of combat itself are very well done, and the general horror of that campaign are well displayed. We see the insanity of attacking into ranged artillery fire. We see the indifference of higher officers who don't care what is impossible, as they simply pass on insane orders of their superiors to their subordinates, who are the ones who will die.

It's as good as any war film I've ever seen. Only a WWII veteran of that battle could comment on certain aspects of the film. I noted one reviewer thought it was absurd that a whistle was used to start an advance. I'm not so sure. Often the military does things which make no sense.

As an earlier reviewer said, the bridge battle scene is quite ludicrous, and the Huertgen campaign was certainly not decided by four fresh replacement soldiers knocking out a couple of unprotected Panzers in a banzai flamethrower attack. So as a historical record ... forget it. As a human story, I didn't find it any more convincing. It hinges on the conflict faced by the lead character, Private Manning, between wanting to stay alive on the one hand, and having to take on the responsibilities of leadership for his small band of green recruits, which of course puts him in harm's way. That requires a pretty sophisticated script and some good acting, neither of which is available in this case.

45773,2,0783112750,"WHEN TRUMPETS FADE starts off great, but then devolves into something little better than paperback fiction.

This is really the first film to take on the often forgotten Battle of the Huertgen forest.  In that, I applaud director John Irvin.  The storyline is a grim.  Private Manning discovers that he is the sole survivor of his squad.  As other noncomms and officers become casualties, Manning finds himself rapidly promoted -- against his will.  As a newly promoted sergeant, Manning is assigned a group of replacements and his own selfish survivalist attitude is sidelined in order for him to teach the new arrivals.

No doubt about it.  In this movie does a good job introducing the death factory of the Huertgen and recreating the partially overrun fortifications of the German Westwall.

Unfortunately, the film derails from historic reality with the renewed attacks on the Kall Gorge.  The entire Kall River Bridge fight is as phony as the bridge battle scenes in THE GOOD, THE BAD AND THE UGLY.  After a promising start, it appears that no one on the production staff bothered to read up on what actually happened on the narrow Kall trail and the struggles on either side of the gorge.  The true story alone would have made for a good movie.

One of the best books written on the Huertgen Forest is FOLLOW ME AND DIE by Cecil B. Currey.  Having previously read that book and several others, as well has having had the good fortune to tour the actual Huertgen battlefield, I am bound to be more critical than most of this film. At a time before I had cable HBO a co-worker told me that this film was very good.  Unfortunately I had to wait a couple years before it was available on VHS (and now DVD).  As I watched the film for the first time I kept hoping the movie would redeem itself before the end credits.  Alas, it was not to be.

In the film, despite the fact that the US Army cannot come close to breaking though the German lines, Manning's green squad continuously does so and wreaks havoc with the Germans.

There are some good fight scenes, but please do not confuse this nighmarish fantasy with what really happened along the Westwall in late 1944.  Come on, now.  American officers would not blow whistles to signal an attack.  Why not just invite a German artillery barrage?

The movie was filmed in Hungary, no doubt to acquire military hardware and extras at a bargain.  This movie would have had potential had someone taken the opportunity to read a book on the subject.  As such, the battle in the Huertgen is just as distorted as the many Battle of the Bulge movies gone awry. I came away from this film thinking that it was Irvin's remake of HAMBURGER HILL by inserting 1944 Europe.

45774,1,0783112750,"A movie about the battle of Hurtigen Forrest in the closing year of WWII. A battle left in obscurity because it represented America's highest attrition in any battle during WWII and clearly the poorest leadership. A lofty subject the execution of which was mutilated by inummerable basic errors in tactical details and equipment. The quality of the film is eroded further by a simplistic and inaccurate script, substandard directing, and mediocre acting.

The script is flawed in that the language and even the situations are purely modern anachronisms so that the characters end up talking and behaving as if they were in Vietnam at Hue 24 years later.  The tactical decisions each enlisted and officer makes in the film are laughable.  The characters portrayed are so inept that they must have been in a coma during basic training.  For some absurd reason, it seems like every GI in that film feels compelled to come out of his fox hole and talk to his buddies without care while being shelled or in full battle; as if having a pleasant walk in the park. Ask any vet, unless ordered to do so or a fellow soldier is injured, no soldier in his right mind would do something like that when being bombarded by artillery.  At one point some guys pick up a flame thrower that uses a fire hose (a fire hose????) to shoot the flame! The Germans in a tactical retreat withdraw the 88s back last after the infantry so that they remain exposed to the advancing enemy?  And it just went on.  I had to stop the film after a while because I was laughing too hard.  The only thing those involved in producing and directing this film knew about their story is that it was during WWII in Europe and that the Japanese were not there.

Ultimate conclusion, this has to be one of the absolute worst war films I have ever seen and I have seen many. I've seen bad foreign war films that are better than this HBO film.  Hands down, this has to be the worst HBO film I have seen in a long time.  Don't be fooled by all the stars the film has. I frankly don't know why so many reviewers rate this film over two stars!

One point worth correcting, re: bazookas vs German tanks.  The StuGG 3 and PZ IV tanks depicted in the film WERE succeptible to US Bazookas, especially the versions available in 1944.  What's more, in the scene where they are attacked, they are hit from behind.  Almost every Tank in the world at that time (except maybe a Tiger) was vulnerable to a hit from behind.

And unlike in most WW II movies, the tanks in here looked very, very real.  They were not round turreted US M48's or even russian T-34s, but rather very realistic looking mockups which looked almost exactly like real PV IV's.  The German cannon (not heavy artillery as another reivewer mistakenly referred to them) were equally realistic and terrifying on impact.  It was also refreshing to see (unlike SPR) that they made good use of their Mg42 bow and co-ax guns against US infantry.  Tanks are scary, scary things, and that is how they were depicted here.

In fact the SOUND and effect of the shells impacting was the most real I have ever seen in any movie.  It was one of the only times I have ever seen shell explosions that brought to mind the real thing.

Some people won't like the fact that not all the U.S. troops are portryaed as cliche heros, willing to jump on a grenade to save their buddies.  These people have obviously never been in the military.

The military is full of ordinary people, (especially during a time of draft) There is the same proportion of true heros as in real life, that is to say, very few.  Under good leadership and the right circumstances, a good esprit de corps can develop where many more rise to the occasion.  The Battle of the Hurtgen, while it had it's share of heroes on both sides, was not one of these occasions.  It was a slaughter of US troops in which morale reached the breaking point (the only US deserter shot in the war, Eddie Slovak, fled from this battle).  Read some of the actual accounts (widely available online, google Hurtgen forst) and you can easily grasp the horror and futility of this immense battle.

Dont like the idea of Ron Eldards character looking out for number one (at least some of the time)?  Or the incompetent, detatched senior officers who had no imagination or idea what to do other than send troops into the meat grinder over and over?

Well, stick your head in the sand like an Ostrich, because that is how war is sometimes.  Try to imagine yourself facing near certain death in an obviously bungled military operation, with idiots in charge, seemingly determined to feed you to the lions.

I found the technical realism and detail superb, the acting was goood, and the writing was excellent.  I think it hits home more if you have ever been in the military.  Yes, it was 1944, but people cursed then too. People could be just as cynical as today, especially people on the front lines. Trust me.  When do you think terms like SNAFU and FUBAR were coined?  The scenery (shot in Eastern Europe) reminded me of the sinister Black Forest in Bavaria where I was stationed in the Army.

The German soldiers were a good combination of scary veterans and hapless draftees, not just the creepy losers as in SPR.  The U.S. replacements were very accurately depicted, and their transformation from innocence to desperation, as the realization of the true horror of their circumstances dawns on them, is a true testimetn to war.

45784,5,0783112750,"This is an excellent World War II movie!  Although the actual story itself is fictional it is couched in the reality that was an actual battle during World War II that is known as the Battle of the Hurtgen Forest which took place in the autumn of 1944 and was immediately overshadowed by the much larger and incredibly more significant Battle of the Bulge which took place only a few days later.  Albeit fictional, this is an incredibly well told and poignant ""soldier's"" story that rings amazingly of the human condition in impossible situations that are well beyond the daily lives of the normal American.
Ron Eldard, primarily of ""ER"" fame and several other television programs performs quite admirably in the lead role of this film, the producers chose very well in picking him for this part.  Of note also are the great performances by Dwight Yoakam, Martin Donovan and Frank Whaley.
Director John Irvin who also directed ""Hamburger Hill"" and ""The Dogs of War"" clearly knows what it is to put a war film to screen and tell the soldiers story to the fullest.  He clearly deserves any and all accolades he's received for making this film.
The Premise:
""When Trumpets Fade"" is the fictional albeit extremely well told story of the Battle of the Hurtgen Forest and more succinctly one soldier, Private Manning (Ron Eldard) who, through his own innate understanding of battlefield condition was able to survive his units initial onslaught and defeat in the forest.  Upon returning to his company's command post he finds himself being promoted to Sergeant.  As this incredible tale progress the soldier who was a Private on Tuesday finds himself being a Lieutenant by Thursday as attrition depletes the ranks and his valor in combat propels him to this position.  Overall, this is a soldier's story in the truest sense of the words!
I highly recommend this film to any and all that are fans of films in this genre as anybody who can appreciate these types of films will not be disappointed by it.  {ssintrepid}

45785,1,0783112750,I had high hopes for this movie and I could not have been more disappointed. It had neither plot nor character development. The jokes were few and far between and most of them were mean-spirited jabs at Japanese culture. Bill Murray seemed to be either bored or just doing his lounge lizzard act during the movie. Even my wife though this was a pointless waste of time. Great idea that next left the batter's box.,1076630400,2,413,4.52
45786,4,0783112750,"The Battle of the Hurtgen forest was one of the most bloddy and costly of the war for both sides.  Over 24,000 young men and boys were either killed or wounded in this battle.  This fine film portrays the soldiers in an American platoon during this bloody battle.
Ron Eldard's performance as David Manning, a young, scared, and ""yellow"" private-promoted to seargeant-promoted to lieutenant is excellent. Manning was the sole survivor of his original platoon and was assigned the task of forming a group of replacement G.I. s into a fighting unit.  Accused of being ""yellow"" by some of his peers, Manning molds his platoon into an effective fighting unit as the film goes on, and they participate in some daring raids behind enemy lines.
Frank Whaley, Martin Donovan, and Dwight Yoakam give fine performances as a medic, company captain, and group commander.
The action scenes are well-done, especially the attack by Manning's group on a battery of German 88mm anti-tank guns.  The setting is eerily similiar to the real Hurtgen, with its dense trees and misty fog.  This made the movie very realistic.  The only scene which I thought was a little ""theatrical"" was the bazooka attack on the German tanks.  German tanks were well known for their thick armor, but in this scene, the American bazookas knocked out the tanks with one shot.  Sometimes it took several shots from a bazooka before the tank was actually destroyed.
Overall, I rate this as a good film.  The acting is very good and the scenery is excellent.  Watch this movie and learn a little bit about one of the lesser known battles of World War II.",1074211200,13,1610,4.800724637681159
45787,4,0783112750,"The two excellent and intelligent German-reviewers of this film here certainly add significantly to the reviews including their fathers or grqandfathers comments, but although I don't necessarily doubt the existence of this plaque in the forest today exclaiming 55,000 US KIA, I think you will find that figure is fairly wildly innaccurate, whether its on a German plaque at the scene or not.  33,000 combined casualties of ALL kinds is the consensus of figures that turn up on a web-search, including from sites assisting war-gaming the battle.
55 000 would seem incredible out of about 300,000 US KIA in the entire war, all fronts.
At 55000, you would effectively have 4 divisions wiped-out to a man, not merely destroyed as fighting-units or decimated, but wiped out no survivors. It was bad, but not on that scale statistically! German-plaques aside, if you start checking, I think youll find Im 'rechts'.
But you are correct this battle is deliberately played-down in Hollywood compared to the still relatively huge US death-toll, and relatively huge US bungling and callousness, of legends like Bradley who had a tank named after him.
This film addresses that, and this battle should have been looked-at in non-flag-flapping terms previously, it is classic-grounds for the anti-war genre. It could have been better in terms of technical advice, and like 'Private Ryan' we have this strange and difficult to comprehend 90s language in 1944 soldiers.
They didn't talk then like they do now, soldiers or any other people-why would a supposedly highly intelligent director and writer imagine or allege they did, and lose this branch of continuity, which unlike German Mk IV tanks costs the same whether authentic or bogus.
Remember the sniper in 'Private Ryan', keeping-up the bizarre running commentary about enfilades and 'I got no shot!'
Who is the race-call battle commentary intended for(hes not supposed to know we are there) and why is it in 90s video-game amusement parlor punk language?
This is a good and over-due film of the anti-war genre, but like Private Ryan even, the standard-setter, it left room for improvement, and a lot of it low-cost improvement.",1073865600,5,2170,5.129943502824859

Fog and rain made the whole place to a scenery which seemed to come from another planet. He said he never understood why they wanted this bloody forest. They just had to wait with their 42 and gun them down. And they came again and again.

It is obvious in this film the explosion, being low grade as they are, are just fireworks.  How ever the movie does present the brutality of war to the viewer.

45790,5,0783112750,"Puruse the mainstream textbooks, and you will find little mention of the battle of Hurtgen Forest, a drawn-out and futile battle between the German and US armies.  Whether due to the fact that is was inconclusive, or overshadowed by the Battle of the Bulge, only the more informed history buff tends to even pretend to be familier with the battle.  And that is a shame, because it depicts another episode in the sometimes poor conduct of the US Army leadership.  Clearly the local commander should have been relieved of duty for the wholesale waste of men while pursuing the same failed plan.
  What I appreciated most about the movie is that the actors conveyed that sense of futility:  keep throwing men and material at the same objective over and over, and keep on failing, yet also fail to change strategy or show creativity in dealing with the problem.  In that sense, it reminds one of the depection of WWI trench warefare.  The movie succeeds in showing the foot soldier almost at the point of breaking, of mutiny, brought about by the despair of the situation.  Only by giving the protaganist a false sense of hope does the commander even come close to taking the minor objective in what was the larger battle of Hurtgen Forest.
 The director also attempts to show some level of authenticity, using authentic weapons, what appears to be authentic tanks and tracked assault guns. Was that a real Panzer Mk. IV I saw ?  Quite a difference from the bogus 50's and 60's war flicks where everybody on all sides were driving US tanks.
 In addition, I thought this was one of Ron Eldard's best roles: do not ask my why, but I think this talented actor deserved more recognition for this project.  Also notible was Dwight Yokam, as he was able to give his incredibly small role nothing of substance:  his lack of acting skills almost does the incompetent general's part justice, but in the end he even fails at that.

Some of the battle scenes are intense and truly horrifying.  While not as graphic as Ryan, this movie conveys just as much horror.  The equippment appears accurate for the Germans as well as US forces shown.  The two German tanks even if not the real thing have been done up to look like it.  That gets points from me.

I am not sure of the accuracy when compare to factual history but if they really depict what actually happen, then i can understand the waste of lives with lil gain during this frontiere. First off, when this sargient non-wannabe agreed do take out the enemy guns in return for a section 8, why did he bring 4 rookies GI's with 2 of them carrying their own flamethrower. First off, flamethrowers are for close range and not use to take out artillary in open field unless they want to be blown up with it when all the artillary shell start to explode. Not only that, they don't even know how to use it. One ran away sceaaming like a whining baby who eventually got shot by his own man and the other one is yelling like a moron while charging at them. Then they run like babies back to the line, which cost the lives of 3 of them.
First off, i would forget about the framethrowers and bring a bazooka with lots of granades, one guy bring the rockets.

Dwight Yoakim, ur ok as a worthless commander but don't give up ur singing career cuz u still can't act and never will.

The focus is the bloody and all-but-forgotten fight over Germany's Hurtegen Forest, described in the soldiers in the film as ""the Death Factory.""  Our hero is a self-serving survivor whose talent for combat leads to several unwanted battlefield promotions -- and, of course, to a restoration of his deadened sense of humanity and heroism.  The forced modernism of the script -- particularly the gratuitous cursing and '90s-ish performances -- threaten to upend the film in the opening sequences, but it gathers steam and a sense of dread.  Worth checking out.  The only real gaping hole is country singer Dwight Yoakam's dull, scenery-chomping cameos as a bullet-headed, unsympathetic officer.

This movie as you may have guessed takes place during the November campaign through the Sigfreid Line, specifically through the Hurtgen forest on the border of Germany and Belgium.  Historically, this was one of the bigger follies of WWII costing more lives of the Allied and German soldiers than was needed. It could have been avoided.  It was a messy affair much like Market Garden (A Bridge Too Far).
So, does the movie show this?  Yes.  On a personal level as a soldier makes it from Private to Lieutennant in three days because he was lucky enough to survive that long.  It shows how the Repple Deple worked with sending constant replacements in to fill the spots of the dead (though in the film, the replacements knew each other, and this was rare since people were randomly divided up and sent to the front).
Anyway.  The movie shows the horrors of not only war, but the absolute horror and hopelessness of being trapped in the Hurtgen forest by your own command because someone seemed to have something to prove somewhere higher up.",1033689600,22,1186,4.597156398104265
45802,3,0783112750,"This movie probably deserves 3.5 stars.
As many others have pointed out, this is an unapologetically anti-war message film.  Some may object to its rather unpatriotic overtones (especially in the context of WWII), but I suppose in the meatgrinder that was the Hurtgen Forest anyone's patriotism would be severely put to the test.  But it's not the film's political message that I object to, but its execution.  Although most of the cast turned in solid, believable performances, the script and the direction were generally uneven.
The film started off well enough.  A rather reluctant and unheroic private, the lone survivor of his platoon, was assigned to lead a squad of raw ""replacements"" into their position.  An unexceptional quiet day on the front perhaps, but the nervous tension was palpable as we follow our group of raw troops through the drifting fog and the errie quiet of the forest as they crawl their way to their foxholes.  Nothing dramatic, nothing spectacular, just the dripping terror of being alone in the woods faced with an unseen enemy.
But if the film was masterful in depicting the psychological tension before the battle, the battle itself was anti-climatic.  In no way can this film be compared to the gritty realism of Saving Private Ryan.  There was a great deal of gore to be sure, but the battle sequences seem plucked straight out of a Clint Eastwood First Person Shooter, as troops from the 1st German Deaf, Blind & Dumb Division flail about in utter incompetency as our squad of half a dozen raw recruits take out one position after another.  I won't even mention the scenerios that seem highly improbable to anyone even vaguely knowledgeable about military history.
If you want to see a film that successfully combines the gritty realism of WWII combat with an anti-war message, I recommend the Thin Red Line.",1027123200,11,1844,4.922580645161291
45803,4,0783112750,"This movie isn't going to appeal to everybody because it is a dark and sad movie.  I like this movie because it doesn't go into the rah-rah [stuff] that many war movies gets into.  You know the scene with the inspirational speech about patriotism, glory and mom's apple pie with the Battle Hymn of the Republic playing as background music.  There are some cheesy moments, but every movie has them and these moments don't affect the rest of the movie which is good.
As for realism, well I never experienced shellfire or taken a round in the gut so I won't say it is or isn't.
Historically, it should be pointed out that the 28th Infantry Division had one of the worst and unluckiest combat records in WWII and for that earned the nickname ""Bucket of Blood"".  The 28th didn't get better until the Army removed the ineffective division commander and got some combat veterans who knew their stuff.
If you read your history books, cowardly officers and men were common place at that point in the war because the US Army was running out of trained infantry--they allocated too many men to anti-tank, AA and HQ units so they ended up scraping the bottom of the barrel--hence the fat guy with glasses and the dumb stuff like bunching up in an artillery attack.
It seems to me that a lot of people who hate this movie are upset because it doesn't portray the US Army as a perfect, noble organization made up of brave, competenent people instead of what it really is, an organization made of humans: some good, some bad, some incompetent and unlucky.",1023926400,23,1540,4.568840579710145

Enough good words have been said on this movie. On a negative note, the Battalion Commander played by Dwight Yoakam seemed to be dramatized a little out of proportion. Nevertheless, this is a great movie, and a reminder that movie is not just about special effects. It's about human being.
A lot of people compare this movie to Saving Private Ryan. I seriously doubt if anyone who like this movie would like SPR. Although a fan of Steven Speilburg and Tom Hanks, I think SPR is a failure. It may be a successful action movie, but not a successful war movie. It tries to achieve a balance between the big picture and personal experience, and succeeded at neither. ""Thin Red Line"" is more about personal experience, but it's too sentimental. It's almost like you are being forced into feeling what the character is feeling.

Their mission is to break through the German lines around a bridge guarded by two 88mm FlaK guns and 2 PzIV H/J tanks.

45806,3,0783112750,"If you watch films about WWII, and maybe even if you haven't, you've seen ""Saving Private Ryan"" which has apparently become the definitive movie about The Big One....well, if that film as a polar opposite, this is it. ""Trumpets"" follows a few days in the miserable life of a miserable man, Private Manning, a dogface who is part of the ... disasterous 1944 - 1945 campaign by the American army to seize the Huertgen Forest from the Wehrmacht. Everybody knows about D-Day and the Bulge, while the Huertgen is forgotten, probably because there is no glory in recounting the story of how 30,000 GI's got fed into a human meatgrinder they called ""The Death Factory"" for no purpose. The Germans never could understand why the American army chose to attack them at their strongest, most easily defensible point, but were more than content to let it happen. WWII histories, most notably Eisenhower's and Bradley's, who oversaw this idiocy, gloss it over, but ""Trumpets"" rips open the scab and gives a glimpse of what really went down. Unlike ""Ryan"" which stressed the nobility of the individual soldier even as it attacked the logic of war, ""Trumpets"" has no heroes. Private Manning is a no-account malingerer who doesn't give a damn about anyone but himself and as a result, keeps surviving while better men get killed off. His officers foolishly assume he is therefore a good soldier, and keep promoting him against his will. Thus he ends up having to break in the replacements soldiers being fed into the grinder, a task which requires empathy, leadership, courage, and patience, so naturally Manning is the worst possible choice. The battle scenes are not especially terrific, but the film does a good job of showing how the stress of combat can make good man bad and bad men worse. Officers lose their nerve, privates run away, everybody is cold, tired, and afraid, and there is always one more mindless ""push"" into the impregnable defence just over the horizon. The performances, especially by Robert Eldard as Manning and Frank Whaley as his only (sort of) friend, a combat medic, are very good. The film never sentimentalizes the characters, and the scene where Manning brutally tells the basket-case lieutenant ""If there's any way I can help you without endangering my own life, I won't hesitate, but I'm not taking a bullet for anybody"" is about as far from Tom Hanks' speech at the end of ""Ryan"" as you are gonna get. The lieutenant, near tears, tells him that's not good enough, whereupon Manning says, ""That's as good as it gets."" The medic overhears this and tells him, ""When you're out there with your guts shot out crying for a medic -- if there's any way I can help you without endangering my own life, I won't hesitate."" You wouldn't hear that in a Steven Spielberg movie. ""Trumpets"" could have been better, but it goes on about a half-hour too long after the story is really resolved, and it does have a bit of a cable-movie feel to it. Other than that, I would recommend it to anyone who wants a taste of some of the fun that followed ""The Longest Day.""",1011916800,199,3066,4.732710280373832

One of the first scenes in the movie showed a group patrolling in the woods, and it was almost exactly how the Army does it.  The combat was also portrayed very well.

45811,3,0783112750,"This is a pretty decent look at the battle for the Huertgen Forest, otherwise known as the ""forgotten front"".  This is one of those episodes that doesn't find frequent mention in the history books, but strangely it wound up with its own movie.

When I watched this, I couldn't help being reminded of the Vietnam flick ""Platoon.""  The emphasis here is on showing the gritty, unglamorous side of infantry combat, and it's well done.  Heroism, cowardice, mud, blood and fratricide are all featured in this story of a scared G.I. who's determined to survive the war at any cost, even if it means the loss of his honor.

The story opens with a young private, brand new to the war, who is the sole survivor after his platoon attacks a German position and is wiped out.  His survival is qualification enough to earn him a promotion to sergeant, and not long after, to lieutenant.  He wants neither.  All he wants to do is survive at any cost, and he doesn't care what his superiors or subordinates think about it.

The action scenes are generally believable and well done, even if some of the mock-ups of the German tanks aren't.  Several of the scenes are particularly intense and bloody, a little reminiscent of Private Ryan, but not to the same degree of utter carnage.  In general I thought the acting was okay, but seeing Dwight Yoakam as a light colonel was a little surreal for me.  The ending, in my humble opinion, was a little corny, and didn't do justice to the rest of the movie, which otherwise might have rated four stars instead of just three.

Even Audie Murphy's heroism wasn't enough to be promoted to srgnt that quickly. And since when has someone been able to fit a Thompson clip into his m1 jacket pocket? At the end comes the bit that makes me laugh. The classic NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!as mannings buddy comes to check up on him and innevitably gets killed. Someone got paid to write the script? jeeeeezus!  another sad bit is where Sanderson, the private gets separated from his platoon and has to hide under the stick pile, which is there 'coinsidentilty'.

Nowhere do you find scenes of soldiers sitting for hours on end in cold, wet foxholes under shell and mortar fire, feeling helpless before an enemy they cannot see and cannot strike back at. The battle of the Hurtgen Forest was a dreadful attritional struggle that pushed the soldiers who fought there to their utmost limits of physical and mental endurance.  Any film seeking to do their story justice would have to break way from the cliches of war movie melodrama.  Sadly, ""When Trumpets Fade"" fails to do so, despite some good performances and a few well-directed sequences. And much of it lacks military credibility: the American infantry advances bunched up in long lines instead of being spread out in small groups, and no one ever thinks to send an artillery observer forward so key German positions can be brought under aimed shellfire.",984182400,9,1020,5.023668639053255

The viewer is  immediately transported into the surreal world of death, decay, and  destruction, where the panorama in view is a smoke-seared scene that the  young soldiers labor through in the midst of all this horror. In this  excellent depiction of General Omar Bradley's ill-fated decision to strike  deep into the forbidding terrain of the  Hurtigen Forest, accuracy and  detail are everywhere one looks. The situation described in the film is  quite accurate, and the young cast of mostly unknown actors do a convincing  and credible job in conveying the insane circumstances surrounding combat,  especially of the lonely, nerve-racking and suddenly murderous nature of  isolated units moving cautiously forward through the sometimes impenetrable  glades of the forest.
All of the craziness and chaos of battle is well  presented, and the story line lends itself to the strong anti-war message  of the movie. A friend expressed outrage at the scene in which a platoon  leader shoots a deserting private, without realizing it is standard battle  procedure. There is nothing uplifting about the scenes and situations the  soldiers faced, no over-riding morality or contrived happy ending to  dislodge the reality of the horror and futility of all this carnage. If you  are looking for a pleasant evening of entertainment, a couple hours of  mindless diversion, better find another movie. But if you want to watch a  well-made and memorable movie that accurately recounts the events of one of  the most ill-conceived and bloodiest series of engagements and firefights  in the Allied campaign in France in the late Fall of 1944, and if you don't  mind a sobering slap of reality hitting you in the face while you're being  drawn into a thoughtful and engaging statement about life and death in the  20th century, this may be for you!

The movies characters very closely  showed the horrible confusion and improper tactical decisions made by  leaders under fire.  The poor weather negated the American advantages of  tanks and close air support.  The American infantry as shown in the movie  were victim to attacks by unrelenting artillery and tanks.  In one real  case, the American soldiers of the 2nd Battalion, 112th Infantry regiment,  so unnevered by constant artillery, actually got up and fled their  positions in the forest village of Vossenack.

45821,2,0783112750,"This could have been a really good movie.
There were a couple scenes that were good, like when Eldard takes his new squad into their foxholes. It was really ominous and suspenseful. But the thing I really didn't like  about it were the blatant technical inaccuracies.
When the company made  their push through the minefield, it was infuriating to see them so bunched  up. Groups of 3 here, 5 there, and 7 over there. Each man should have had  at least 20 to 25 meters between him and his buddy. AT LEAST!
I've spent  the better part of my life studying weapons and tactics and how they are  employed in the field, so when I see a BAR firing about 100 rounds without  the man behind it changing magazines, it pisses me off. Or when every time  an enemy soldier gets hit, he lurches around for a couple seconds and then  finally screams or says, ""Ahh!"".
When a burning hot hunk of  lead smashes into you, you fall to the ground like a ton of bricks. It's  like you don't have legs anymore. That's it; you're down. End of story.  Call for a corpsman if you can, but more than likely, it'll be somebody  else yelling, ""Corpsman up!"". I know that in the army, the  majority call for a Medic, but I'm speaking for a different branch. That's  what geting shot is like.
And the fat guy wasting nearly all of his fuel  in the flamethrower, just screaming, screaming, screaming. It's  ludicrous.
Also, why in the hell do movie makers feel they have to create  huge fireballs to make an artillery blast look real?
Artillery doesn't do  that. The movie kept on showing 88mm shells hitting the trees, which, yes  it did happen, but then for some reason, billowing fireballs would eminate  from the ground. Artillery sends a lot of dirt and dust in the air along  with a hell of a lot of fast-flying shrapnel. There almost no flame at all.  It just annoys me, that's all.
I would recommend against adding this  movie to your collection. I got it a month ago, and it was so depressing I  haven't watched it since then.

The company commanders see him as a perfect  candidate for a leader, due to his obvious survival skills. He is promoted  directly to Sergeant, and is put in charge of a squad of misfits. This  Sergeant only cares about himself, and doesn't mind sacrificing others to  get himself back to the base alive.
At first, a minor gripe I had is that  I never really cared for any of the characters (except the medic played by  Frank Whaley, and the young private Sanderson). And I especially hated the  main character, who, like I mentioned before, only cares for his own hide  and takes advantage of his subordinates (playing with their lives) for  personal gain.

7790004,3,0783112750,"This film has all the makings of a great war picture, if only they had hired a different director and editing team. There were so many moments that could have pulled me in even deeper, but instead; a really poor clarinet soundtrack was played over the top of everything. It was one of the worst production decisions I have encountered in a war pick. Why take gold and wipe your behind with it? Unbelievably poor production staff destroyed all of the great performances by the cast.",1516233600,,481,4.604651162790698

7790006,5,0783112750,"Love this movie. My dad lived through this battle and said this movie is very factual. I bought copies for my siblings after watching it myself. For anyone who wants to watch a World War II movie that doesnt cut corners, this is a must see.",1515974400,,240,4.239130434782608
