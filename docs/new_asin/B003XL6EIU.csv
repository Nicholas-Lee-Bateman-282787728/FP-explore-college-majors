4217132,5,B003XL6EIU,"I am a huge fan of ""The Larry Sanders"" show, and I hope they keep issuing individual seasons on DVD.  I have not wanted to break the bank by buying the complete series set, so I have eagerly snapped up each individual season as it is released.  The series really stands the test of time.  I have watched every episode several times over.  Great special features on the DVDs too.",1324944000,,378,4.357142857142857
4217133,4,B003XL6EIU,Love the Larry Sanders Show. This 2nd season is Ok. The 3rd video listed some shows that were not on it....don't know why that was.,1297382400,,131,4.28
4217134,5,B003XL6EIU,"Especially for those who who routinely watched the Johnny Carson Show, this is a perfect parody. Shandling, Tambor and Torn are in top form. WHAT TOOK THIS DVD RELEASE SO LONG?",1285632000,6,176,4.709677419354839
4217135,5,B003XL6EIU,"FINALLY!!!

Now that we've finally made it over the (almost 10 year) hump from the season 1 release to season 2, season's 3-6 must be inevitable.

I'll leave others to describe this season in detail but I'll simply state that The Larry Sanders Show was seminal and groundbreaking and has lost none of its potency in the years since it originally aired. It is solidly one of the best TV shows of all time. It was THE show that put HBO Television firmly on the map and paved the way for future groundbreaking HBO and cable shows such as The Sopranos and The Wire as well as countless network television offerings.  With its semi-verite eye on an offbeat, creative and dryly humorous environment, The Larry Sanders Show changed the face and format of television comedy and paved the way for reality TV and faux reality TV shows such as The Office. While comedy for sure, the L.S.S. provides many dramatic arcs to follow as well, some very intense and serious- all played to perfection by one of the greatest ensemble casts ever assembled, including career defining performances for Jeffrey Tambour and Rip Torn.
Every season of Larry Sanders is as good as described above with only the last (6th) season showing slight signs of creative decline, during which the series was wisely wrapped up!

This is one of those shows that should be recommended to everybody, unconditionally.  It was my favorite show when it was originally running while I was in high school in the early 90's. At the same time, it was my dad's and my grandparent's favorite show. My girlfriend and my friends followed it as well as my dad's friends and almost everybody I knew at the time.
That says a lot.

FINALLY!!!

(See season 1 first of course.)",1284163200,6,1719,4.672185430463577
4217146,3,B003XL6EIU,The picture quality is nonexistent(it sucks). I give the picture quality  zero stars and the actual show 5 stars. This is my second favorite TV show. It's great! I'm not going to buy any other seasons from amazon based on the horrible picture quality.,1463961600,,251,4.704545454545454
4217147,5,B003XL6EIU,Great. Just great.,1462406400,,18,5.333333333333333
4217148,4,B003XL6EIU,Wonderful show.  I'm so sorry that I didn't get to see Gary Shandling as a late night host.  He was excellent on this show and would have been on his own real talk show!!,1461024000,,170,3.9705882352941178
4217149,5,B003XL6EIU,"Im going to miss Garry Shandling. I purchased all 6 seasons of this masterpiece, and found only the last season, season 6 a bit of  a downer, but still The Larry Sanders show ROCKS!!",1459209600,,182,4.352941176470588

4217152,5,B003XL6EIU,"Its the funniest show I've ever watched on TV.  I mean between paranoid Hank, Artie, Sid the cue card guy,  the other Sid-Hank manager, Stevie Grant, Jerry the writer and of course Larry, it the best sitcom I've ever seen.  I have no other show to compare it with.  I am not a fan of TV or cable generally, but I love to watch the reruns of the Larry Sanders show, it never ceases to make me laugh.  Thanks.",1437436800,,407,4.10126582278481
4217153,5,B003XL6EIU,"The Larry Sanders show is not for everyone.  Its wit is quiet and subdued.  It doesn't have all the easy jokes of a popular network show but the characters are well defined and because of this, though over 20 years old the shows still radiate.  Try a few of them.  You may want to watch the entire series.",1394582400,,305,4.206896551724138
4217154,5,B003XL6EIU,I would say the only problem with the Larry Sanders show is it could still be on .. they stopped making them.,1392249600,,109,4.0
4217155,5,B003XL6EIU,"I always loved watching the Larry Sanders show when it was running in TV and still love seeing it on video! Each personality was well developed and they all came together to make an excellent , unique and funny show!",1391990400,,216,4.425
4217156,5,B003XL6EIU,I watched it every week when the new episodes came on. Just as funny and fresh now in 2014. Hey Now!,1391385600,,100,3.8095238095238093
4217157,5,B003XL6EIU,I didn't realize how brilliant this show really was when it first aired. I am loving getting to watch the whole series without interruption with my Kindle & Amszon Prime,1389225600,,169,4.666666666666667
4217158,3,B003XL6EIU,"Thought the episodes I watched had some funny moments and plots had a few interesting twists.  In general though, the humor and plot lines seemed pretty contrived.  This would not be a motivator to subscribe to a premium channel for me.",1388448000,,236,4.7317073170731705
4217159,5,B003XL6EIU,"funny show, sanders is a lovable character with that self deprecating personality that holds the audience towards him. Very well done.",1386028800,,134,5.428571428571429
4217160,5,B003XL6EIU,"The Larry Sanders Show was one of the most consistently funny TV shows ever. Part spoof of the Tonight Show, part homage to Johnny Carson and his well-known idiosyncrasies off-camera, the show always delivered insightful laughs.

Hosted by Garry Shandling, and aided by sidekick Jeffrey Tambour and producer Rip Torn, the Larry Sanders Show and the behind the scenes drama and angst consistently produce laugh out loud moments and quotes that have found their way into my daily life. ""Hank's Look-Around Cafe...where you and your food go on an adventure."" The list of guest appearances - including Dana Carvey, Burt Reynolds, Carol Burnett, Jeremy Piven, and Ed Begley Jr. - is amazing.

You will not be disappointed by the Larry Sanders Show. No flipping!",1381363200,,756,5.088709677419355
4217161,5,B003XL6EIU,"AR BETTER THAN 90% OF COMEDY SHOWS OF TODAY!  REALLY FUNNY, ADULT, ACCURATE AND FAR MORE INTELLIGENT THAN TODAY'S SHOWS.",1380844800,,120,5.0
4217162,5,B003XL6EIU,"Broad humor, inside jokes, punch lines that carry over seasons -- we wouldn't have ""Arrested Development"" or ""Curb Your Enthusiasm,"" even ""Modern Family"" without Larry Sanders.  It's like the missing link between the old, great Dick Van Dyke show of the 60's, and any great TV comedy today.  Very strong ensemble, headed by Garry Schandling (who isn't just funny, he can ACT), Jeffrey Tambor, and a pre-psycho Rip Torn, who plays maybe the most astute producer in the history of the medium.  It must have been so much fun to work on this show.",1379030400,,543,4.75531914893617
4217163,5,B003XL6EIU,"If you have never watched this show you have NO idea what you are missing.  I caught the first run when it originally came out, but started watching again recently and have not laughed so hard in a long time.  Fair warning: there is a decent amount of cursing so if that offends you might want to skip this.  These guys will have you cracking up from the first episode and I guarantee you won't stop until you have seen them all.  When Larry ""Gary"" finally says goodbye on his last episode you will be hard pressed not to cry right alongside him.  You can tell everything he says is right from the heart.",1378771200,,604,4.2631578947368425
4217164,5,B003XL6EIU,"It's fun going back and seeing all of these people with 20 years of perspective. The comedy still works and the writing's still fantastic. Since it's been so long, I don't know if it was deliberate at the time or a brilliant modern-day accident, but the bars & tone and title card at the head of the ""Artie's Gone"" (streaming) episode were a nice & cheeky touch which set the mood for me.",1377648000,,388,4.328767123287672
4217165,4,B003XL6EIU,"Garry Shandling is hysterical; Jeffrey Tambor's quirks are side splitting; Rip Torn is indescribable.  The episodes are hysterical, the format is really a first and the general feel of the show is warming.  Somewhere between 30 Rock and Curb Your Enthusiasm, The Larry Sanders Show sits.  A bit dated at times, but a must buy for anyone looking for a television comedy to spend some time with.",1376524800,,393,4.835820895522388

4217169,5,B003XL6EIU,A very funny show. The late night talk show concept is brilliant and executed perfectly. The writing is top notch and the cast is great. Highly recommended!,1370649600,,156,4.814814814814815

4217172,5,B003XL6EIU,"Witty and very funny. Highly recommended. Sorry I missed it the first time around. The entire cast works well together. Lots of subtle humor in there. Its also interesting hearing the jokes about Leno, Letterman and Arsino in light of todays talk show battles.",1366761600,,260,4.931818181818182
4217173,5,B003XL6EIU,The Larry Sanders Show is in my top five of all time TV shows.  It is truly a modern day American classic if there ever was one. A must watch!,1366329600,,142,3.7333333333333334
4217174,5,B003XL6EIU,The gold standard.  Truly brilliant and hilarious. Each character is perfectly drawn.  Really set the standard. I am ready for a comeback.,1365724800,,138,5.2272727272727275
4217175,5,B003XL6EIU,What could be funnier than a fake comedy show.  This is 30 Rock's inspiration.  Great guests and crazy plots. Funny,1361923200,,115,4.7

8408288,5,B003XL6EIU,"I'm guessing, but you have to believe that all the contemporary talk show hosts of the time (Arsenio Hall, Jay Leno, Dave Letterman) were glued to this series. I'm sure it had them all howling, and maybe the show helped the other hosts feel better about their own dysfunctional talk show worlds watching Larry Sanders' [slightly] exaggerated mock up.

And if by chance the hosts of the real world talk shows did not watch Larry, you can be sure they had their assistants combing through each and every episode scanning for references to themselves (""What did Larry Sanders say about ME?"").

Nah, those guys, and all talk show hosts since, love and treasure the series. No two ways about it. :>",1479081600,,693,4.7190082644628095
