3598462,1,B001GATF90,"Total B*%#@&!t. If women do not like working in pornography, or the adult industry then don't do it, get a regular job. As for the so-called objectifying of women? How about the reverse-stereotyping that automatically all men, who like to see nude women, think that these adult models/actresses are ""sluts"". I certaintly don't! As for the men they have irrational guilty feelings of adult porn.",1350432000,,394,5.076923076923077
3598463,1,B001GATF90,Not the complete movie. A waste of money. Only half of the show. Need to get the DVD.,1258243200,8,85,3.7777777777777777
3598464,5,B001GATF90,"The DVD of, Somebody's Daughter, just sucked the air out of me.  Unbelievably powerful, real, moving.  I was especially touched by the young couple's tenderness and vulnerability.  What sweet people.  'An amazing experience to watch this and then listen to the CD following.  Thank you!  Now to figure out how to loan this to some pastors...but only the ones I am SURE will give it back to me!  Every minister and counselor in America should have it.  Dr. Doris Sanford",1232668800,6,469,4.775
3598465,5,B001GATF90,"""The Somebody's Daughter DVD is the one of the most powerful tools I have ever used in counseling. This moves therapy beyond words to engaging a client's many senses. The music, video and real life stories help clients connect in ways that talking in therapy would never do.  It helps men move from seeing women as objects of gratification to children of God. This realization alone can be a powerful step in a man's journey toward healing and recovery.""",1232409600,7,454,4.746835443037975
3598466,4,B001GATF90,"This video is helpful in addressing the battle of pornography that is common to man.
The testimonies of men who have participated in internet porn and then come to grips with this temptation is useful to begin dialogue among men and their wives. I particularly appreciated the testimony of a wife who remained faithful to her marriage vows after her husband confessed, as she demonstrated a spirit of willingness and commitment to help him overcome. I also appreciated that NO compromising images are shown. (The last thing a struggling man needs is more images to contend with)
There is a section that addresses how male consumers of porn objectify women. Somebody's Daughter musically helps promote the truth that women are fellow humans. When men partake of porn they devalue women to the status of pleasuring ""objects"". Somebody's Daughter suggests that women along with men are created for a nobler purpose, and that both can benefit from the support and accountability of others.",1225584000,13,985,5.08641975308642

3598471,5,B001GATF90,"Gave as a gift, so I really don't know if it was well-received or not.",1420761600,,70,3.7333333333333334
3598472,5,B001GATF90,Excellent!,1413072000,,10,10.0
3598473,1,B001GATF90,"This movie was the most dis-satisfying pic I've seen in years. They had a wonderful opportunity to expose the ugliness of pornography & they were out to lunch during the whole movie. This is a sad attempt at making $$$$ off  a degrading, life-destroying industry and they never got off the ground with the attack on indecency! A farce & they should be ashamed at taking peoples money for this sham!",1391904000,,398,4.605633802816901
3598474,5,B001GATF90,"THis is an excellent movie helping us realize the two biggest factors today that are destroying our society- Families and marriages are being torn apart by the thousands from what ""should"" cause great shame and is more addictive than crack cocaine- men and! women and children are suffering it's effects--Just ask any pastor or priest and find out how many times a week they listen and counsel this very problem.  I have to wonder if this is what the once Russian president meant when he said to our country ""We will take the US one day without firing a shot!""  Destroy the family unit which is what this country was built on! and from there--- ""without a shot""--A great movie to understand their mentality is called ""Agenda The grinding down of America""--It's an eye opener~
Plus why do you think there are so many advertisements today for erectile dis-functiony? If men only realized Porn addiction has a GREAT deal to do with this health problem which robs! you of any abilty for sex but of course that's not being made public either is it?
Another great movie is called Pornography--Naked and unashamed by Paradisus Dei",1381363200,,1123,4.753846153846154
3598475,4,B001GATF90,"This was a good video, but wasn't quite what I was expecting.  The content in regards to pornography's incredibly damaging effects on the family was a much needed voice in our culture.",1379289600,,184,4.75
3598476,4,B001GATF90,"The information was nothing new to me, but I think it would be to people not involved in this field. I thought it might be a little harder hitting, but I liked the fact that it showed the effects of pornography on different men--and included one wife. Done well.",1357603200,,262,4.36734693877551
8304698,5,B001GATF90,"While the #MeToo movement uncovers the scandal of sexual harassment and assault, one subject that is being missed is the role pornography plays in objectifying women. Somebody's Daughter tells the stories of men who were addicted to pornography and how their addiction tore apart their families. So many tolerate pornography in the name of sexual liberation or for fear of being labeled prudish but they fail to understand the prison of pornography addiction and the negative effects pervasive pornography has on the treatment of women in our society.",1513641600,,551,5.2727272727272725
8304699,5,B001GATF90,Three men and a husband and wife share their personal struggles and how pornography ravaged their lives.  They also share their journey to freedom from pornography.  Highly recommend as a counseling tool.,1513123200,,204,5.34375
8304700,5,B001GATF90,"I have personally experienced the pain of this addiction in my family.  The addiction of Pornography destroys people's lives including the one addicted, their family and friends.  This DVD includes a message of hope as people previously addicted share their journey and stories.  The church especially needs to get their heads out of the sand and talk opening from the pulpit on this addiction.  Along with talking about it, there should be a message of hope as well.  If a person addicted to pornography is willing to be accountable to others, there is hope.  Watch this eye-opening DVD to gain more of an understanding.",1512950400,,621,4.923076923076923
8304701,5,B001GATF90,This is an excellent tool to use while helping anyone affected by pornography.,1509580800,,78,5.076923076923077
8304702,5,B001GATF90,"This DVD is a great tool to assist those who are struggling with pornography. So much can be lost with the addiction of pornography - relationships, respect for women, jobs, family. If more men thought about somebody's daughter when viewing pornography, this could be a turning point.",1509321600,,284,5.0638297872340425
8304703,5,B001GATF90,What I appreciate most about this program is that it shows how pornography can destroy a marriage.  The emotions and thoughts of the wife are often overlooked in this discussion but not in this program.,1509321600,,202,4.771428571428571
8304704,5,B001GATF90,"This is a great CD and DVD...it is clearly in support of women who are stranded in the sex slave trade.
When will we stop this horrible abuse of women!  They really don't choose to live this life!",1509062400,,196,4.157894736842105
8304705,5,B001GATF90,This is an awesome program. The sharing in honest and raw. It shows the destructive lie that pornography is and how it wrecks lives and marriages.,1509062400,,146,4.653846153846154

8304707,5,B001GATF90,Have watched this DVD several times & shared it with many friends & relatives.  Excellent & very well done.  The struggle & powerful message was clear without being explicit. It offers much HOPE thanks to the courage & honesty of those who shared their stories.!,1458518400,,262,4.8
