8725696,5,B0128XN9HM,"Fascinating. While it is necessary to remember that some of this information cannot be verified, the remote viewing information was just great to watch. Thanks for doing this Courtney Brown and Farsight institute.",1453680000,3,213,5.484848484848484
8725697,5,B0128XN9HM,"Another great remote viewing presentation from the Farsight Institute.
Courtney Brown & the Institute are providing some real eye opening details, using remote viewing ,to some of the greatest mysteries of
our time. Compelling information is brought forward to the public.
Looking forward to more projects of this type from the Farsight Institute in the future.",1450483200,4,361,5.464285714285714
8725698,5,B0128XN9HM,"Top notch remote viewing! A work of love, dedication, decades of learning and practicing. This great project is one step above everything else I had seen so far, and that is not an easy feat, given that Daz and Dick invariably deliver outstanding results. You can't miss this one.",1450137600,3,280,4.73469387755102

8725700,5,B0128XN9HM,"My favourite of all the farsight dvds so far. There are so many versions of events in history, that are obscured by unknown facts, which lead to people trying to fill in the blanks, which eventualy become peoples own truths. In no way does this presentation, try to fill in the blanks. It just presents what it is seen or should i say sensed. This is not the whole truth maybe, but at the same time does not come across as a presentation made up by a group of consipiracy theorists. The fact that both remote viewers showed that they did not understand fully the technologies they sensed, made this whole presentation, more plausable. Great job from the Farsight Institute.",1438905600,6,673,4.616666666666666
