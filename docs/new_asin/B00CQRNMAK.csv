5735088,2,B00CQRNMAK,The movie was a glorified documents of raunchy old geezers. If you want to see old floppy skin and the elderly doing it this is the movie for you,1369526400,,145,4.0344827586206895
5735089,5,B00CQRNMAK,I really enjoyed this movie. Not life changing but was a fun time. A lot of celebrities. Raunchy yes and different.,1369353600,3,115,4.523809523809524
5735090,1,B00CQRNMAK,It was a very entertaining and funny movie. That shows that living life is ageless. Getting older doesn't mean you can't enjoy doing things.,1401235200,,140,4.875
5735091,2,B00CQRNMAK,"very disappointed in this movie.  was expecting much better. it could have been better written.
I would not recommend to anyone.",1391385600,,128,5.095238095238095
5735092,1,B00CQRNMAK,Thought this was a movie but instead it was more of a documentary.  I could only watch the first 30 minutes before becoming bored and frustrated.  It wasn't even funny!  Don't waste your valuable time wading through all the crap.,1387324800,,229,4.675
5735093,4,B00CQRNMAK,"Not the greatest movie ever filmed but lots of laughs! I think the negative reviews are coming from some folks that don't want their world view of seniors blown out of the water. Grandma and Grandpa are not wasting their time knitting slippers for the grand-kids, they are drinking, smoking and fooling around...Deal with it!",1387065600,2,325,4.927272727272728
5735094,1,B00CQRNMAK,Very disappointing.  I found it quite boring.  I like all of the actors but I thought it was going to be a lot more funny.  My husband thought it wa OK.  Could of been better.,1383955200,,175,3.914285714285714

5735096,1,B00CQRNMAK,"The only reason I watched this was to see Scott Caan.  His part lasted less than a minute.  Tim Allen's less than 2 minute part was funny.  The rest of the movie was awful.  Parents, do not let small kids watch as it's full of nasty words.",1378512000,,239,4.0212765957446805
5735097,4,B00CQRNMAK,"Warning: This is NOT the new ""Expendables"" film.

I am embarrassed to admit I enjoyed portions of this film. The plot is non-linear. J.K. Simmons visits Coconuts, a retirement home and finds 3 Geezers full of life. He interviews and films them for a new film, which is immaterial to the script. Lou Beatty Jr. plays Benard, a blind man who does all the things a sighted person does from being a line judge to sculpturing. Victor (Basil Hoffman) is the lead in the group. He has the hots for Ruth (Beverly Polcyn), eat your heart out Phoebe Cates. Will Bonaiuto rounds out the group, although his role is minor.

I can understand a young audience not enjoying this film. There are things older people will pick up on such as the Phoebe Cates imitation scene, and the sound track playing the theme from ""Shaft"" while the group plays a trick on Bernard. I personally enjoyed this film in spite of being filled with much low brow humor. Clearly not for everyone.

Parental Guide: F-bomb. No sex. Male rear nudity.",1377907200,2,1009,4.594444444444444
5735098,5,B00CQRNMAK,Don't believe some of the haters . . . You either get this movie or you don't.  I found it super funny. A different kind of movie and the deleted scenes and bloopers were a nice surprise.,1373328000,3,187,4.054054054054054
5735099,1,B00CQRNMAK,"Lame.  Very boring, colorless, not funny.  Low budget .  Couldnt believe it was this bad... but it is absolutely awful!!",1370044800,,120,4.9
8585122,1,B00CQRNMAK,"Terrible... All of the more known names shown on the cover are barely in the movie but for a few seconds... The rest of the old guys are horrible actors. Terrible plot, fast forwarded through most of it. Not worth buying at all. Bought because my husband loves Tim Allen.",1446854400,,271,4.44
8585123,1,B00CQRNMAK,Preview were better than the movie a 12 pack of beer is a better deal then this movie  you can have more laugh,1437955200,,110,3.782608695652174
8585124,3,B00CQRNMAK,So-so plot - somewhat silly.,1434758400,,28,4.8
8585125,1,B00CQRNMAK,"PLEASE...don't waste your time and money on this movie. Terrible disappointment with the content...all the sexual/language content does NOT make for a ""good comedy"". This ""Not Rated"" should be rated ""R"" for raunchy.",1414713600,,215,5.545454545454546
8585126,5,B00CQRNMAK,"The first time my husband and I saw this movie, we laughed so hard, we almost fell off the couch.  It's the perfect balance of in-your-face and subtle humor.  The characters are genuine and there are many scenes that will widen your eyes!  And the underlying message of not taking life too seriously, and always enjoying new experiences, is timeless, regardless of age.",1414540800,4,369,4.825396825396825
8585127,3,B00CQRNMAK,"Except for J.K. Simmons, forget the other famous actors on the DVD cover because you only see them for a few seconds (maybe a minute at the most). It's basically J.K. Simmons interviewing older people in a retirement home to know what they do to occupy themselves during the day. There are a few funny parts and not totally a waste of money, just not at all what I expected. DVD cover is misleeding and trailer made this better than what it really was. It's your call really, but it's not something I would really recommend.",1411948800,4,524,4.46875
8585128,1,B00CQRNMAK,This show gets a zero rating from me.  Could not finish.  Waited for some time thinking something might happen for it to only get worse.,1405987200,,136,4.4
8585129,5,B00CQRNMAK,I had rented greezers from redbox it's A GREAT GREAT COMEDY FLICK worth buying I had rented it once I was done what did I do go straight here and order it great movie.,1403654400,3,167,3.9411764705882355
8585130,3,B00CQRNMAK,Really random movie that has NOTHING to do with anyone on the front cover of this movie except for JK Simmons. Sad! I wanted to see a movie with Tim Allen and JK Simmons working together! :(,1402617600,3,190,4.162162162162162
8585131,1,B00CQRNMAK,"If I could give this movie a negative 5 star review, I would.  It was horrible.  Why does the movie industry think crude and obnoxious are comical themes?  There are other wholesome themes that are much more funnier than dirty old men and women.  This movie was very disappointing, distasteful, and boring.  I could only watch a few minutes of it before turning it off.",1402185600,,369,4.615384615384615
