8384206,5,B002YG28IU,The Torchlighter Twin pack which included a video of Gladys Alyward and William Tyndale is amazing. The videos were accurate and yet appropriate for ages 7 and up.  Even the adults in the household were entertained and educated through watching the videos.  A must have for any family media library that wants to be inspired by people who gave their lives and passions for the glory of God's kingdom.,1271203200,,400,4.782608695652174
