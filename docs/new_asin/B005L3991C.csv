His music is fresh, thoughtful, and full of energy.  He has a zest for God and his attitude shows through his music.  Love this DVD!",1344384000,3,281,4.245283018867925

4719305,5,B005L3991C,"What a great spiritual album of encouragement.  Incorporating a variety musical genres,  Jason Crabb and his musical group go beyond traditional Southern Gospel, to not just entertain, but inspire.  The selection of songs and the dynamic contemporary arrangements give this album variety and power.  My favorite contemporary music rendition is Jesus on the Mainline, but the songs by Jason's Father, Gerald, touch the heart of what it means to be a Christian in this modern world.",1338249600,3,480,5.276315789473684

4719312,5,B005L3991C,"I LOVE this DVD! Jason Crabb is a wonderful singer. He sounds great singing old gospel favorites such as Beulah Land and Jesus on the Mainline. Jason's love and energy for the Lord shine thru on this DVD. Jason's interaction with his band is wonderful. The Gaither Vocal Band are guests on this program. They are awesome as usual. William Lee Golden from the Oak Ridge Boys does an impromptu on Why Me, Lord with Jason and Bill Gaither. It is very good. I watch this dvd a lot. It is uplifting and encouraging. Well worth the price. I am so glad that I found this DVD on Amazon.",1379289600,,578,4.3119266055045875

4719316,5,B005L3991C,"I received this DVD last night and I'm on my 5th or 6th listening already (admittedly while multi-tasking by the 3rd or 4th listen--only to pause for a moment and get caught up all over again). In fact, I've already got two more Crabb DVDs on the way as of the first viewing. This is an endearing, rewarding, and memorable experience you'll never tire of. If it doesn't reach down into the midst of your soul and pull it to the surface in record speed, nothing will! You'll find yourself erupting into hand-clapping laughter and wiping away tears back to back. Thoroughly enjoyable!

Jason is the darling of Southern Gospel but he delivers in such a humble, down-to-earth (albeit exhilarating) way, and his lively, exuberant expressions add so much zest and flavor to his performance. This is truly an awesome and soulful experience!  Don't deprive yourself!",1362614400,,858,4.86986301369863
