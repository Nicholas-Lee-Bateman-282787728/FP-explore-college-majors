8280074,5,B001AXU1F0,I purchased the Alvin and the Chipmunks Video for my 12 yr.old daughter. That was several years ago and the video is still one of her favorites. My 5 yr.old grandson finds it entertaining and asks for it when he comes over. I grew up with Alvin and the Chipmunks of the 60's and this current video does justice to the spirit of those memorable characters.,1352332800,,355,4.393939393939394
8280075,5,B001AXU1F0,My kids loved the boxed set of movies.  It has something for the whole holiday season.  The chipmunks teach some good lessons to the kids without making it to obvious.  Also each DVD has other great episodes from the show.  A good value.,1268870400,,237,4.441860465116279
8280076,5,B001AXU1F0,My daughter is a huge fan of the chipmunks ! I thought there was only 1 movie per dvd but there are about 4 or 5 on each ! She watches them every night ! You get a lot for the low price.,1229385600,9,186,3.3488372093023258
8280077,5,B001AXU1F0,"Ok...I'll admit it...while I based my rating on the movie's appeal and appropriateness for kids, I got a kick out of them too.  Teaches the right things without cramming it down your throat, and is just a fun set of movies.  Moves fast enough to keep the little one's attention, and has plenty going on and lively music for the older kids.",1226793600,10,339,4.451612903225806
8280078,4,B001AXU1F0,"(This review is for the THANKSGIVING CELEBRATION disc only. The picture of that DVD was for some reason linked to the live action Chipmunks movie starring Jason Lee, so I put my review here instead).
First there is a typo on the back of the box: ""Celebrate THANSKgiving..."" but, oh well. The DVD starts with one of those special holiday episodes, ""A Chipmunk Celebration"", which is quite good and has its funny moments. It's followed by three episodes from the TV series: The amusing ""Food for Thought"" (one of my personal favorites) where Simon and Alvin help Theodore pass his History test with the help of food, and the rather sad ""Cookie Chomper III"" where the boys take care of a kitten which later is killed by a car. Finally there's ""Dave's Getting Married"", an amusing but rather conventional episode. For some reason, ""Food for Thought"" doesn't have the theme song opening, but the other two episodes starts with the famous theme song. A must for any AATC fan!",1223510400,8,969,4.739644970414201
