stress and sorrow.  It helped to heal me.  Anna.",1420070400,,184,3.891891891891892
8449006,5,B004YXLT2C,"Not much I can add to the description above. As someone who lives in the UK and never likely to be able to visit California, this DVD has been a lovely way of seeing such rugged coast line and crashing waves. I also loved the forest and the streams, that part did remind me of parts of the Uk. Thank you to the makers for a gorgeous, relaxing time and the brilliant photography I can feel Iam there.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Serenity-Moments-Big-Sur-Relaxation-DVD/dp/B004YXLT2C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Serenity Moments: Big Sur Relaxation DVD</a>",1344384000,2,594,5.9186046511627906
8449007,5,B004YXLT2C,I find this dvd very relaxing.  I recognize some of the places where the recording was done and that reminds me of some very happy days spent wandering up and down the beautiful CA coastline.,1342396800,,191,4.457142857142857
8449008,5,B004YXLT2C,"This Serenity Moments DVD had the option to enjoy the beautiful photography with just nature sounds, which I really appreciated. The coastline panoramas were spectacular, and there were also some lovely streams included too.",1323820800,2,224,5.617647058823529
8449009,5,B004YXLT2C,"I really enjoy this video. The scenery is excellent and varies from coastal waves to inland scenes and lots of streams, woods, and plants. I was impressed at the quality of shots of creeks in woods with bright sun and deep shade. Not washed out or too dark. 71 minutes long. I can choose audio of natural sounds with or without music. I like the natural sounds and haven't tried the music. I have no complaints or criticism of this video, which surprised me as I bought this DVD on impulse along with Serenity Moments: Canadian Rockies, my main interest. I watched Can. Rockies first and found it very annoying and often irritating in spots. So Big Sur was a very pleasant change.",1316476800,3,680,4.536585365853658
8449010,5,B004YXLT2C,"This DVD of Big Sur is absolutely beautiful. Scenes look
like beautiful, beautiful paintings. I put it on in early
morn and when not looking at TV go back to it. It is so
relaxing; taking all your cares away.",1313193600,3,208,4.225
