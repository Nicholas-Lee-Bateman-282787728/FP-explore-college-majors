8577691,1,B00C6F60DI,"None of these movies are widescreen (1.85.1) as the listing (and even the back of the box) claims. They are all full screen (1.33.1). I realize that sometimes Amazon listings can have errors, but for the box to say that each movie is widescreen when it is not the case is false advertising.",1396396800,6,290,4.490566037735849
8577692,4,B00C6F60DI,"Heathers is so-so. Slater tries to do Nickelson, but poorly. Hollywood Knights was ok, some old stars. Jawbreaker was better than expected, Rose McGowan was really good. Peggy Sue is an outstanding classic that outshines the rest with an incredible cast. A wide variety in a 4-pack, 2 disks, 4 sides.",1386028800,2,300,4.901960784313726
