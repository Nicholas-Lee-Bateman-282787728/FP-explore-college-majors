5967591,5,B00F51RTYY,"A lengthy workout, but enjoyable.  You are constantly moving so time goes fast.  Some moves you may not feel when you do them, however you know you did them the next day.  Cueing is great, but what else would you expect from Jennifer Gilardi.  The music a perfect choice.  She does a bit more talking than I care for, but I seem to tune it out ok.  Many moves are different than you see in other Barre workouts, and I have a few.",1410134400,,429,4.108433734939759
5967592,5,B00F51RTYY,This is a wonderful workout.  I love Jennifer Galardi's energy and spirit.  I would definitely recommend this workout to anyone.,1403395200,,128,5.35
5967593,5,B00F51RTYY,"Another great workout DVD from Jennifer Galardi! I love her workouts! This is the 4th different exercise DVD I have purchased of hers. If you are looking for a good exercise DVD, I recommend this one!",1392249600,,200,4.583333333333333
5967594,5,B00F51RTYY,"Barre workouts seem to be all the rage, with every fitness expert and their mother releasing a barre workout recently.  Although at first I was worried that Jennifer Galardi was just following craze, my fears were completely vanquished as soon as I started this DVD.  Like always, Jennifer is one of the most gracious, likeable trainers.  Her cuing and explanations are impeccable, and her upbeat personality is contagious.  With this DVD, she has managed to create a completely unique form of fitness that will probably be unlike anything you've done at the gym, and she still manages to challenge you.  Ballet, kickboxing, strength training, and yoga are just a few examples of the exercise disciplines Jennifer will lead you through if you purchase this DVD.

Another review on Amazon JessicaT has done a brilliant job of breaking down the DVD and telling the reader what exactly to expect.  If you want to know a thorough list of what moves are included in the workout, I highly recommend reading her review.  This review will be more focused on broadly reviewing each section of the DVD overall.

WARM UP - This segment isn't very long, but it efficiently introduces you to the second position plie, which a move you'll become very familiar with throughout the DVD.  If you don't know what that is or if you're completely new to fitness, never fear!  This DVD is the perfect place to start.  Jennifer always moves slowly enough for everyone to keep up and has a modifier behind her, doing easier version of every move.  Always know that there will be a more advanced option to work to that will definitely push you to your limits, even if you're an advanced exerciser.  Before moving on, I want to note that the warm up also effectively stretches and wakes up the body, getting it ready for the workout to come!

CARDIO - I wasn't expecting too much from the segment, since I don't really equate ballet with cardio, but I was to be proven wrong!  Jennifer does some high cardio moves that almost all originate from your second position plie.  Your legs will probably be shaking by the end of the workout, since they definitely do a lot of work in this segment.  Your heartrate will also probably increase significantly with a lot of the jumping and kicking moves that Jennifer teaches you.  I find that the main difference between this workout and traditional cardio is that there is more focus on controlling your body instead of just throwing it all over the place.  Because of this, all the moves are very graceful and flowing even though they're high intensity.

BARRE - This is the longest segment and is probably where you will be conditioned the most.  Jennifer works literally every muscle in your body and really forces you to move your body in different and challenging ways.  You start off on your chair, which is acting as a mock ballet barre, and you do several challenging standing movements.  You then move to the floor and continue strengthening your body before finishing with some very unique stretches that are very focused on opening your hips.  You will also do some twists and inversions, which both feel amazing after your workout.

You use light hand weights in this segment.  When doing a full-on strength training workout, I usually use 10 lb. dumbbells, so when a workout says ""light hand weights,"" I usually just go down to 8 lbs. and do fine.  For this workout, I was forced to use 3 lb. hand weights, and I was still dying!  Jennifer does movements differently than any other workout I've experienced.  Instead of a typical contraction/release, she puts you in contraction and has you pulse.  No matter what you're working, it will be ready to fall off when she's finished!  I love that she stretches each muscle immediately after she works it.  I literally think she hits every muscle in this segment: calves, hamstrings, quads, thighs, triceps, biceps, shoulders, back, and abs.  Maybe the only muscle that could have used more intense work was the chest, but I definitely can't say that it was completely ignored.

You will need a yoga block for this workout; you definitely won't get the full impact without it, but you can find some relatively cheap ones online or in the sporting goods section at most stores.  Jennifer claims weights are an option, but I think they really accentuate the work you're doing.  From my experience, I definitely recommend sticking to the ""light weights"" recommendation.  In fact, if you don't have weights, you could probably use water bottles or canned vegetables (I'm serious, it can sometimes work!).

OVERALL - I'm thrilled with this workout; it has revitalized my way of looking at fitness!  I was extremely challenged, yet I had fun the entire DVD.  It lasts over an hour (barely, the entire DVD is an hour and ten minutes), but I hardly knew the time had gone by!  I highly recommend it to everyone looking for a challenge, which is a word I keep using simply because it fits this workout perfectly.  It challenges the viewer out of his/her comfort zone and forces them to push their body to limits it has probably never been pushed to before.  Not that it's more difficult than a bootcamp workout, but it's just different.  Whether you're a beginner or advanced exerciser, dancer or non-dancer, I can't recommend this DVD enough!",1388361600,6,5308,4.771929824561403
5967595,4,B00F51RTYY,"I have a few other ballet workouts, but this might be my favorite.  It has a good warm-up, and I like that the cardio is more plies and squats and not all just jumping up and down on your toes.  The strength portion is also good.  The cooldown is long with lots of stretching.  I only wish it were shorter if I did the complete workout, because 70 minutes is kind of long, especially when I exercise in the morning before work.",1387497600,,427,4.170731707317073
5967596,4,B00F51RTYY,"The dance moves are tons of fun and full of energy.  The only complaint for me is that it hurts/pinches my shoulders because I have neck and back problems; otherwise, I would dance to this everyday.",1386979200,,198,4.5
5967597,5,B00F51RTYY,"I love Jennifer Galardis dance DVDs, so when I was looking for a barre workout to try, this was definitely the one for me! Jens cuing is impeccable and her voice is calm and smooth. She gives a little intro at the beginning of the DVD, explaining that this DVD is best done barefoot, and also tells what you equipment you need (light hand weights, yoga block, and a chair).

Warm-up (7 min): Before getting started, Jennifer introduces Rachel on the right, Jenni on the left. Jenni is the modifier. The warm up is very gentle with lots of breathing and stretching.

Cardio (16 min): You do 5 different exercises for 3 min each. Exercises include plies, plies with balance work on each side, the sidekicks, pli jumps, and ballerina burpees (I think Ive seen these called donkey kicks before). After each 3 min exercise, you generally shake it out or stretch before moving on. Its not extremely challenging, but enough to get your blood pumping.

Barre (13 min): You do some standing work holding the block between your thighs. Then you stand on one leg and do some balance work before switching sides. Then you balance while pulsing the leg in the air. Next, you hold one of the weights with the back of your knee and do lots of work that way. Last, you work the triceps with your light hand weights.

Mat (15 min): This portion starts with the block between your thighs, and the weights in your hands to work your biceps. Next you work your shoulders and your core. You do planks still holding the block between your thighs before removing the block and doing different leg moves to challenge your balance (and your core). Next, you use the block to do a one legged bridge on each leg. Core work is next.

Stretch (14 min): This is a wonderful extended stretch. You massage your back by rolling a little, then stretch your leg and your IT band. Then you put the block under your back and stretch by laying over it before putting it under your hips and stretching that way. You lift your feet in the air, which Jennifer says helps reverse the blood flow in your legs. You do bridge before coming to a sitting position to stretch a little more.

All in all, this is an absolutely wonderful workout. I felt rejuvenated after doing it. I am looking forward to using it as my low-impact workout once a week.",1385769600,15,2302,4.4952153110047846
5967598,5,B00F51RTYY,"I really loved Jennifer Galardi's Ballet Body (BB) DVD so was really looking forward to something similar. This is a varied workout that a ballerina apparently would do to keep fit but no dancing experience is required (take it from me: the two left feet Tin Man style dancer). Everything (and I mean everything) gets worked out in this DVD i.e.  toes, feet, ankles, legs (thighs & calves), hips, butt, core, arms, shoulders and back.  Jennifer works out with two background exercisers; the girl (Jenny) on the left of screen does modifications throughout for those who are new to the workout or less advanced. Jennifer is really good with doing stretches throughout the DVD and there is also the extended stretch at the end. The music is pleasant background music, not designed to stand out, annoy or be a focus of the DVD.  Workout length is about 70 minutes.

Warm up - 7 mins
If you've done Jennifer's BB workout you know she makes the warm up fun - the warm up moves are different to those in BB and feels like a workout in itself.

Cardio - 15.5 mins
* Low impact - requires balance - plies then plies moving side to side with leg lifted at knee and either touching calf (or knee) of standing leg.  Next variation adds body tilt and then balancing on one leg while internally/externally rotating the lifted thigh at the hip. Unfortunately Jennifer has us unevenly do the internal/external rotating of the thigh. The sequence is done twice on the viewer's left leg (Jen's right leg on screen) and three times for the viewer's right leg. Minor detail which is easily fixed by pausing the DVD and doing one more set with your left leg.

* Starts with a plie facing forward then internal external rotation side to side - i.e. face forward plie, turn to right for a lunge, face forward plie, turn to left for a lunge - repeat sequence (arms up and out the entire time). Next in the sequence Jennifer has us turn to one side balance on one leg while the other leg & both arms pump - repeat sequence.

* Starting with plies, then as Jennifer says: ""you take the left foot, replace the right foot & kick the right leg/foot up while punching right arm out to the side, plie down again, then kick & punch again. Repeat several times before moving to other side. Next in the sequence after the plie/kick/punch move is to balance on one leg while bending the lifted leg in & out at the knee.  It sounds complicated but it really isn't plus it's a whole lot of fun - I love these martial arts style moves. ""Kick arse Ballerinas"" as Jennifer calls it.

* High impact - starts with wide leg plies then you jump up in the air & land with legs together heels touching then jump up again landing in a plie squat (this really is a ballet style move). There is a low impact variation.

* Last in the cardio series: ballerina version of burpees - instead of jumping your legs out behind you, you kick them in the air. Can't picture it? Think of a frog doing a hand stand. I didn't know what a burpee was as I've never come across them in my life and was surprised I could do them (!) but at my own pace. There is a standing modification shown.

Barre - 46 mins
Equipment required: yoga block (I got mine for a low price on eBay), chair, light hand weights, and a mat for the floor work. This session is long as it includes the barre workout, arm workouts and extended stretch at the end.
As the title suggests this segment has the kind of lower body work you would find in a barre class. Moves include:

* Hold block between thighs and squeeze thighs together pulsing.
* Up on tip toe, bend at the knee then do various pulses.
* Staying up on tip toe, bending at knee and do pelvic floor scoops.
* Leg extensions forward (holding body upright) and then back (while bending forward) leading into leg pulses with the leg up in the air behind you.
* Hold leg up behind you with knee bent so your leg is at a 90 degree angle, place a hand weight behind your lifted knee then pulse up.
* Arm work involves extensive triceps work while standing (Wowser! I really felt these moves) then down to the floor for bicep work while kneeling and clutching the yoga block between your thighs.
* Kneeling side body stretches with the weights to lengthen & intensify the stretch.
* Planks with the yoga block clutched between your thighs. A modification isn't shown for the entire plank series but you could easily lower your knees to take a quick break. I found the plank sequence difficult after the extensive arm workout (but I have a weaker upper body than most.)
* Pelvic lifts with one leg lifted straight up and the other leg bent with the foot resting on the yoga block.
* Various core work such as roll ups and leg taps.
* Extensive stretch using the block, who knew a yoga block could make your stretches feel so good!

As with all barre style workouts this works the lower body a lot. There are a lot of plies/plie squats and also kneeling. You need to have good knees or have built strength in and around your knees as I have with over 2 years of regular exercising (lots of squats, plies and lunges!).

I admit when I watched this DVD the day I received it, I didn't think I would like it because it looked too hard. But the workout is FUN, doable (I classify myself as a low intermediate exerciser, non dancer, reformed couch potato and NOT athletic) and moves along at a steady pace - the time really flew by for me and I particularly love the extended stretch session at the end.  I really felt it in my legs, booty, arms and core the next day. Jennifer is becoming one of my favourite instructors - she has a great personality, her voice isn't grating and she explains & cues very well. This DVD will be added to my regular rotation which includes BB - can't wait to do this work out again! Thank you, thank you Jennifer!!",1383350400,34,5807,4.367933271547729
5967599,5,B00F51RTYY,"I love to have a few DVD type workouts on hand for those moments when I can't make it to the gym, the studio, or the sidewalk for a run.  This DVD made me sweat, it made me sore (in a good way, of course), and it was fun.  I danced when I was younger so it felt really great to be recalling a lot of my old ballet moves during the workout.  Although, someone with no previous dance training would certainly be able to follow along.  Jennifer Galardi is a pro and there's absolutely nothing annoying about her as she walks you through the workout (something I struggle with with many of the other dvds out there).  Try Barre Breakthru.  You won't regret it!",1382572800,3,656,4.208

Instead of traditional workouts using weights, when I feel kind of tight and sometimes a little sore, after completing this workout, I feel sore, but in a good, healthy way! I may even be taller...? :)",1446681600,,281,5.0
8612350,5,B00F51RTYY,"I've been a fan of Jennifer for as long as I can remember. For me, she has challenging but not impossible moves, a good tempo, and the right amount of speaking. I find that her ""make sure you're doing this and not this"" statements correct my form every time! My favorite part of the video is the stretching. I feel that most videos rush the stretching and force it in to 2 or 3 minutes. Barre Breakthru has a wonderful stretching portion that leaves me feeling accomplished and relaxed!",1426896000,,486,4.47191011235955

8612353,5,B00F51RTYY,"I have been using Jennifer's Ballet Body dvd for three years and still love it.  It is my go to workout.  When I get out of my routine and need to start over and work my way back up to the more difficult barre workouts I always start with Ballet Body.  When I try a new workout (like Kettlebell Kickboxing, which is awesome, or one of those horrible Jillian Michaels dvds that makes me feel like i have been hit by a truck days after) I go back to Ballet Body to work out the kinks and soreness.  I am actually on my second copy of Ballet Body, having lent it to a friend who refused to return it.  I like Jennifer Galardi; she does the entire workout from beginning to end (none of that annoying walking around and talking like with Jillian Michaels), she talks during the workout (NO VOICE OVERS) but not to excess and she is rarely obnoxious.  Her timing and cues are perfect as well.  I also like that in the kick section of the cardio section she has trouble talking because she is a little out of breath.  Nothing more irritating than having some perky chick calmly talking through a workout that has you struggling to breathe.  I was so excited when I found she had done another ballet dvd!  Barre Breakthru is a step up from Ballet Body in terms of difficulty but it is still easy to follow and an amazing workout.  The warm up is typical Jennifer Galardi meaning your legs will be burning and your heat rate will be up.  The Cardio section is well done in that there are a couple of variations so you can build up and there are enough repetitions you can work on your form but once you have it it's still not overly repetitive.  She has added some kicks and ballet burpees which gives Barre Breakthru the intense cardio that Ballet Body was missing.  The only equipment needed is light weights, yoga block, and a chair (for the barre section).  I've tried it without the block and it is really not that effective without it.  You are also going to need enough room to move a bit.  I still prefer Ballet Blast by Jennee's weight exercises over Jennifer's but Jennifer did add a few more into this DVD.  The block is used again in the mat work.  I love the pace that Jennifer moves at for mat work.  Many dvds (ploxing is bad about this) move too fast when they get to the mat and you can't get the form correct.  Jennifer is one of the few instructors who seem to realize that it is difficult to get a clear view of the the tv while doing mat work so she gives more instructions during this section and it tends to be slower more controlled work to give you time to get the form before she moves on.  Its not too slow once you have the form though because you are holding the position longer.  And as always,  Jennifer has the best cool down stretches.  I use the Ballet Body stretch after all workouts I do and the one for Barre Breakthru does not dissapoint.  Jennifer's ballet workouts are always worth the money.",1420934400,2,2924,4.29014598540146
8612354,5,B00F51RTYY,"I have several barre dvds and gone to a number of classes but Jennifer's approach is truly different, challenging and fun.",1416355200,2,122,4.857142857142857
