8365408,5,B002DM63S6,"This cinematic gem, ""45 r.p.m."" (Remstar DVD 110217), merits a lot more thorough review than it can get from this viewer. It essentially is a coming-of-age film depicting 1960 vintage pop culture in ""the boondocks"" and its impact upon a group of adolescents, especially a teenage lad, Parry Tender, who is, as one way to put it, rather innocent past his time. Parry desperately yearns to leave small-time Manitoba, namely remote and sparsely settled Goose Lake in that province, for somewhere much more populous, and hence more sophisticated and lively, than that. The other two main juvenile characters are the two girls, Stacey Lucas and Debbie Baxter, who vie for him.

Parry and the tomboy younger girl of the two young females, Stacey Lucas (who prefers to call herself simply ""Luke""), try to scheme a way of getting to New York City, where a disc jockey has a radio programme which they just barely are able to receive on the modestly-sized radio in the household that Parry shares with Peter George, an Amerindian who his elderly foster father. The D.J. is running a contest to recognise thirty 45 r.p.m. doo-wop, r&b, and rock-`n'-roll records from the prior two years; the winner, if s/he be from out-of town, can have a free trip for two to New York City, a glamourous mecca of a different order of being altogether from what these teens have known growing up in Goose Lake, Manitoba. Of course, they are not even able to send in their mailing, not being able, despite many arduous (and some comic) efforts to identify all of the tunes and performers of all of those big-holed little music platters.

The film is very charming, but not without its dark side, too, especially the sexual abuse which has affected the lives of Parry, the-girl-named-Luke, and the adults around them and/or tragically absent in their lives. The poverty depicted and the blighted hopes, which plucky Parry is determined to overcome, add a depth to the plight of these kids that make the film poignant as well as a lot of fun to watch. The film perfectly captures the time in which it is set (and this viewer knows it perfectly well, having been an high school teen of exactly Parry`s age in 1960), which only adds to the pleasure that this treasurable film offers.",1349654400,,2252,4.757033248081841
