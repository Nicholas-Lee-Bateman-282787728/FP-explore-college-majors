4234106,5,B003ZJ0POO,I am VERY glad that the last season is finally coming out on DVD. It is the best mystery series because the characters and plot are well thought out. The actors are superb. Everyone who loves mysteries will love this DVD collection.,1283472000,27,232,4.5476190476190474
4234107,1,B003ZJ0POO,"Why has Universal totally changed the packaging?
Even the font isn't the ""Murder, Shw Wrote"" font anymore?!

4234124,5,B003ZJ0POO,"I am a huge Murder She Wrote Fan, Big Time. I own this season and season 6. The reason why this is is one of my favorite TV shows still is it can keep U guessing. It also provides the viewer a chance to put their dectective skills  to the test. It's a great show that makes you think. It is one of the few TV shows that doesn't warp your brain, and that  was great about 80's TV shows. If U love the shows from the 80's or if Ur looking for a great series from the day, this is for you. I think you will enjoy it; and like so many TV shows of today it is far from being lame. So Enjoy :)!

together, and it brings me fond memories of her.  I will always treasure these dvd's.  I only wish there were more. They are light
hear-ted mysteries, and not alot of violence, or cursing which I find refreshing, and just down to earth old fashioned mysteries.  For

Love the feel of the small town and even when she went to New York or abroad. Love here positive attitude through out  the series, but  recently I watched Angela in an old movie called Mutiny where she was sort of a fem fatal and she was great. This series is just plain old fun for anyone to get hooked on! It took us over 6 months to get through the entire 12 seasons  watching one or sometimes two every night after work with dinner!",1375920000,,585,4.348623853211009

4234152,2,B003ZJ0POO,Most of the episodes are repeats from other seasons. They should not have priced this last episode as high as the others and/or informed the fans/customers about the fact that it was a rerun of other seasons. This is very disappointing. It seems that they were just out to make money.,1359244800,3,284,4.588235294117647

4234157,5,B003ZJ0POO,"Great!  Nice ""who done it"" shows with recurring and guest characters.  I love the new locations for each of the stories.  I like the fact that each episode is completely different - no continuing story lines where you have to watch episodes in order.",1354147200,,250,4.636363636363637
4234158,5,B003ZJ0POO,"I would love to see a Murder She Wrote DVD with episodes that take place just in Cabot Cove.  Those are my favorite.  There were a lot of them taking place in Cabot Cove over the 12 years and perhaps the ""best of"" could be put on a DVD.  I would buy it for sure!",1347408000,,262,3.727272727272727
4234159,5,B003ZJ0POO,"The twelfth season has been such fun to watch. I have all
twelve seasons now, and I enjoy watching all of them.  Most
of the shows produced for television now are not the kind of
shows that I like to watch.  So... I have some of the dvd sets
of shows from the past that I do like.",1344556800,,280,3.810344827586207
4234160,5,B003ZJ0POO,"I was a big fan of ""Murder, She Wrote"" for many years and I have almost all the series DVDs. There isn't much more that can be said about this series and its star. She's wonderful, talented, and a joy to watch. What a classy lady, and believe me, you don't see that kind of class much anymore. The episodes in this, her final season, are some of the best and I enjoy watching them over again.

I now watch a lot of more ""realistic"" mystery/murder shows now. I love Bones, NCIS, and Criminal minds where they show a lot of gore and bloody gooey bodies, but I find that once in a while I like to return to, dare I say it,a kinder, gentler murder stories. I can't speak for every one, but it's kind of like when you watch all those movies with so many four letter nasty words and huge explosions and then you watch an ""Dial M For Murder"", somehow it's soothing and you just feel good about yourself again. That's what Murder, She Wrote does for me. It's murder yes, but it's not as intense. May I say right here that I don't want to give the wrong impression, I am anti-murder, It's just that I love a mystery.

I will continue to go back again and again to see Jessica Fletcher capture these dastardly criminals and enjoy watching a real actress at work and not just another chick in tight pant showing her cleavage and calling it acting.",1344384000,3,1336,4.255905511811024
4234161,5,B003ZJ0POO,I love the Murder She Wrote series.  This was the last season and was just as great as all the others.  If you are a Murder She Wrote fan you will love this.,1338768000,,157,3.727272727272727
4234162,5,B003ZJ0POO,"Again, Angela Lansbury is great.  I'm sorry that this is the final year of her
tv program, but watching it reminds me of the years I spent happily watching her
on tv.  The dvd is excellent and the price allowed me to buy the final two years.
Thankyou, Amazon.",1326931200,,259,4.26530612244898
4234163,5,B003ZJ0POO,"I'm slowly trying to purchase all seasons.  I missed most of the 12th season, but remember seeing some hacked up copies on Biography Channel such as Nan's Ghost which is the main reason why I purchased this.  I prefer my programming to be unedited without commercials which is why I purchase a lot of older TV programs on DVD.  Murder She Wrote is an good example of quality programming we just don't see anymore.  MSW still keeps me guessing even if I've seen the episode before and can't remember who did it.

Most of the other episodes for this season I missed and I was not disappointed.  The same great writing and special guests from long ago.

I'm glad to see that the MSW TV movies are being released soon.  I never saw them so it will be nice to add them to the collection.",1324944000,3,782,4.344827586206897

Jessica (our brilliant sleuth) is well past 21, very attractive, money enough to be comfortable any where in the world she travels, and most of all, she is smart.

You couldn't help but love her, & when she was in her kitchen, about to have a cup of coffee, you felt as if she was going to pour 1 for you.  There needs to be more ""down home"" shows like Murder She Wrote, yes even though  it was a Mystery, we still had Aunt Jess, to help solve the case, so it went without saying,""you knew you were in good hands"".",1308096000,2,600,3.966666666666667

My usual choices are pretty hard-core serial killer stories so for me to really enjoy a series this 'fluffy' really speaks volumes for the series.

It's acutally not fluffy - just really good entertainment.  Loved it when it was in original production on tv (i was a kid), wanted it on vhs (couldn't afford it), and am finding it just as good as I remember it originally.

Highly recommended for almost all ages. Some episodes do get kind of spooky! Seriously!",1302393600,3,614,4.682242990654205

I have purchased 3 each of the season 5, 6, and now 12. There are white blips, and dust like particle marks throughout them, and looks like the Universal Studios never bothered to ""clean"" them up before mass producing, and dubbing them for consumers like us. They put a large price on them and give us inferior product. It is a shame, as this program is a wonderful one, attested by the fact it lasted 12 seasons, not an easy task.",1296604800,8,555,4.245283018867925

I also have her books and they are terrific. They really hold you to them and you actually feel like part of them. They are hard to put down once they are started.",1296518400,3,481,4.073684210526316

This order came from Amazon quickly, in excellent condition. I did find that the orders came quicker when ordered straight from Amazon and not side company's that were cheaper. Altho they did come in excellent condition eventually.",1293235200,4,468,4.936708860759493

4234185,5,B003ZJ0POO,"This is the 12th and final season of Murder, She Wrote.  My family and I always enjoyed watching Murder, She Wrote every Sunday night.  Any fan will enjoy watching season 12.  I'm anxiously waiting for the release of the Murder, She Wrote TV movies.  I also enjoy reading the Murder, She Wrote books.",1292112000,3,300,4.60377358490566
4234186,5,B003ZJ0POO,"This show abounded with literary allusions, well-researched lines, style, and love. Love of art, of entertaining, of mystery, and of drama. This is a wonderful series!

The last season of this was filled with the innuendo of management trouble at the season, so that even in a fitting send-off, it rose above the fray. I miss these Sunday shows! This was a fabulous and missed season that paid tribute to the hard work and comraderie of its peerless actors well-seasoned in their craft. Few shows can live up to the shoes this one filled!

I hope Universal presents its loyal and loving audience with the final extended movies.",1283904000,39,627,4.796296296296297
