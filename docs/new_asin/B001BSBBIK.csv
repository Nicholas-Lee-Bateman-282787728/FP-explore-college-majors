3498620,5,B001BSBBIK,"One of the first three movies shown on broadcast TV in New York in 1947.
Hollywood was afraid of the new medium and would not allow any domestic films to be aired.
The British Alexander Korda productions ""Thief of Bhagdad"", ""The Man Who Could Work Miracles"", and ""Things to Come"" became our favorite treasures for years.",1250640000,5,320,4.732142857142857
3498621,5,B001BSBBIK,"Great story from the past that looks strangely familiar.

This movie is a reminder of the proverb, ""There is nothing new under the sun""... ""All that is has already been done"".

Of course another view of this is that everything they are doing to us they have done before, and have refined the same techniques through careful deliberation and much practice.  It is clear that the present new world order scheme is an old world ambition for world domination and total population control. There is a ""thread"" that runs throughout history, and is revealed in the study of Ponerology.",1239840000,,578,4.818181818181818
3498622,3,B001BSBBIK,"I just saw this film on TCM. For a film made in 1936--considering what happened later--it was eerily on target on some things. The dialogue was somewhat stiff and unrealistic and did anyone notice that only caucasians seemed to have survived into the future? What happened to all the Asians, Africans, and Hispanics/Latinos?",1238112000,3,324,5.132075471698113
3498623,4,B001BSBBIK,"I first saw H.G. Wells ""Things To Come"" when I was about 12 and even then it made an indelible impression on me. The last time I saw it was in college (too many years ago to mention) for a film history class and it held up well. So this restored DVD version is only my third viewing of this flick.

But the film itself still holds up, addressing many social, political and scientific implications of a progressing society that many of us would do well to heed today. For purposes of complete disclosure I must admit up front that I am a serious technocrat and believe that our intelligent ability to use science and technology to uncover the secrets of nature is the main thing that will carry us through our current difficulties and out into the future. And is apparent that H.G. wells thought much the same. (After you see this movie you will understand that, if I had the option, I would join ""Wings Over The World"" instantly...).

No doubt that this movie is a bit dated -- cinematic sensibilities have changed a lot since the production of this film. Yet, there are many stylistic choices in the areas of lighting and photography that lift it out of the ordinary. And given the technical limitations of its day, the special effects in ""Things To Come"" (especially the scale model work) is extremely creative and inspiring.

The restoration of this classic is very well done, and probably the best that can be achieved, given the age of the materials thay probably had to work with. Though I prefer watching the original black and white, the  colorized version on this disc is not too bad -- it affects an impressionistic quality, using color in a pastel fashion to overlay rather than replace information. It reminds one of the hand-tinted color photographs from gread-grandpa's day -- quaint and charming if not dynamic.

Alltogether, I would recommend this DVD to anyone who has an interest in the history of cinema, the history of science fiction films or the history of social evolution. The ending scene where Raymond Massey's character spells out why Man has to explore the Universe (taken right from Well's original text) still sends chills up my spine and stokes the fires of inspiration and imagination. Check it out -- I don't think you'll be disappointed.",1234915200,26,2271,4.710327455919395
3498624,4,B001BSBBIK,"this old classic now remade by colorization has an added dimension that enhances the visuals the cinemagraphic artists would have liked to project to the audiences. Color works in this film. compared to the black and white version in the same dvd, film buffs can compare directly their likes and dislikes of the colorization process. I think the color adds a positive new dimension in this film. It doesn't work for all older films but this time I think it is a winner.",1232150400,3,469,4.662650602409639
3498625,5,B001BSBBIK,"I always hated colorized films, but this time it was done right.  The colors don't truly look natural, but they have depth and variance and they give an almost three dimensional effect to the picture.  Besides, if you don't care for it, you also have a beautifully restored B&W version of the film as well.  The special features aren't all that impressive, but the real treat is watching what is probably the best version of this movie available.",1230163200,22,446,4.6923076923076925
3498626,5,B001BSBBIK,"H.G. Wells' history of the future (from the past, no less!) was immortalized in this World War II-era British production, and was a bold prediction of the path that lay before mankind.

As global war decimates the citizens of ""Everytown"" (a not-so artfully disguised London) the world as we know it is transformed into a dystopian, medieval abyss where the bi-plane is an marvelous warfighter and cars are quite literally operating on ""horse power.""  Things to Come chronicles mankind's decline and subsequent rise as a group of scientists from the Cradle of Civilization remake society in their shining image.

As with all Legend Films releases, this DVD contains the original black and white film (in its best available quality) and the newly colorized production.  Both are worth considering as independent viewing experiences, since the different palates carry such a different flavor.

Notable at the time (and even today) for its fantastic special effects and visual design, this new DVD production of Things to Come is notable for its consultation with legendary special effects guru and Oscar winner, Ray Harryhausen.  Before he became a household name, Ray worked as a cameraman on the original production of Things to Come.  Here, Ray puts that firsthand knowledge to use, providing Legend Films with the best possible reference for its colorization process.  What you see is what Ray's camera saw, and truly what the Director originally intended.  Extensive interviews with Ray about his career and the process of colorizing older movies round out a package fit for any DVD enthusiast.",1227571200,15,1596,5.203125
3498634,3,B001BSBBIK,"A distinct difference is found between writing a novel and writing a screenplay. H. G. Wells wrote the screenplay for ""Things to Come,"" and of course wrote the novel of the same title. He did not find this distinction in his adaptation of his own work. The script is plodding and flat, which might be why the acting is Shakespearean, British and stilted. Some have said the message should overshadow the acting, but that's a cop out.

Wells' father was a freethinker, his mother a practicing Protestant, and so there was always this tension in the home. The schism of pantheism on one end of thought and a redeemer on the other was an undercurrent in Wells' life. From my point of view there is an unmistakable religiosity to the film, although what is being proselytized is Socialism.

On the flip side, the set designs and the special effects make the film worth watching. They were designed principally by Vincent Korda, the director's brother. They are highly imaginative and precisely executed, a remarkable feat for the day, especially considering CGI was one of the things to come. My only complaint - a small one, and maybe not Korda's doing - is the look of the future people, who look like updated Romans. It's curious that, over the years, so many costume designers figured future dress would be robes and bare legs.

This set comes with both the original B&W version and the colorized version. The colorization looks OK enough, although I am not a fan of colorization and so don't know enough to make a comparison. However, some might like to know the colorization process for this film was a pet project of Ray Harryhausen.",1476576000,3,1636,4.733333333333333
3498635,3,B001BSBBIK,"Colorized print varies but worth the watch. Interesting to see how some of the story is on course to what happened today but continues for several years past what actually happened, and other parts are out of wack.",1471478400,2,214,4.657894736842105
3498636,5,B001BSBBIK,"I happened on to a review of this movie by accident while shopping for something else, but it sounded so interesting that I purchased it to consider for my Contemporary Philosophy class -- it is really surprising, given the age of the film, how many aspects of the projected future age have actually come to pass....there is a great narrative by Raymond Massey near the end, explaining how exploration has always been and always will be an integral part of the human experience.  It is a great movie to use in a philosophy class.",1470873600,,529,4.627659574468085

3498639,3,B001BSBBIK,This was a movie I would not have purchased if I had first watched it.  I don't know if I will ever watch it again.  Normally colorized movies are really great.  This is an exception to the rule.  I would recommend you watch it first before deciding to buy it.  It was too bizarre and unrealistic to have any redeeming social value.,1454371200,,332,4.290322580645161
3498640,3,B001BSBBIK,"I finally saw it after considering it for some time. The book ""Sci-Fi Movie Freak"" highly recommended it. All I can say is ""save your money"". You'd be better off buying ""Killer Klowns from Outer Space"" which I purchased recently. I was hoping to see a lot of futuristic scenes. I got a really wide plane, and a guy with a 2 1/2 foot collar sticking up. This movie is really dated. I thought at the end it was going to redeem itself - with a launching (shooting out of a cannon) of a space capsule. All I got was a few clouds.",1453248000,,525,4.106796116504855

3498649,5,B001BSBBIK,"This movie is amazing for its age.

H. G. Wells was way ahead of his time, and every book he's written that I've read (or movie of one of his books that I've seen) has been absolutely brilliant.  While the times may have changed, the ideas have not, and to see how many things in this movie have, for the most part, taken place since this movie (and, by extension, the book) came out (1936 & 1933 respectively).  This is the stuff early 20th Century dreams were made of...

The script, fimography, and acting are dated, obviously, but the beauty and quality of this age of a film are unparralleled in comparison.

Sadly, I was looking for a specific film, and had read an article that this was the one, but I didn't see what I thought I was going to see.  I was disappointed, but not in the film...  Amazing.  The colorized version of this film is worth the price of admission alone.",1424649600,3,883,4.341463414634147
3498650,5,B001BSBBIK,"Anyone interested in the interplay between SciFi themes and social issues will enjoy this decidedly vintage film. I particularly liked the way the film handled the apparent conflict between the Romanesque theme of perpetual expansion (into the universe) versus the achievement of inner Wholeness and Enlightenment (requiring a rest from tireless expansion) attributed in the film to the Greeks. In truth, these two animating motives are easily synthesized, but doing so would have required a sequel. In Joy.",1423094400,2,507,5.512820512820513
3498651,3,B001BSBBIK,"I think the first and most important dislocation that a modern viewer feels when viewing this film is a squeamish, creeping discomfort, a nagging feeling that something is wrong in this Utopia.  The film of course depicts HG Well's vision of a pan-national government of ""common sense"", run by the ""freemasonry of science"" (Cabal's words).  Cabal notes that the ""new order [doesn't] approve of independent, sovereign states""...nor, indeed, of people it deems ""brigands"" and ""artists"". Cabal feels that people are simply corpuscles without liberty in the body politic: ""'We' go on....No man is indispensible"", he says at one point, adding that ""Our revolution didn't abolish danger or death; it simply made danger and death worthwhile.""

Cabal's remark is self-serving and disingeneous, of course, since he is the recognized leader of the pan-national government, and is later lionized as a hero and a father of the modern world. The implicit classism -- the division of the people of the world into rulers and the subjugated -- is later rendered explicit, as one of Cabal's descendents lets us know the post-Nietschean God-State, run by supposedly wise engineers in the interest of all, is simple totalitarianism: ""We have a right to do what we like with our lives,"" Cabal remarks, ""with OUR sort of lives."" By that he means only the engineers have a right to do what they want to do:  Everyone else simply has to shut up and be happy with the services provided by the overweening state. He goes on to remark that the commoners in society ""have safety, plenty, all you want"" and therefore shouldn't revolt or in any way stop ""Progress"" (i.e., control by the state over our personal liberty).

Cabal's panegyric on how engineers are ""the last trustees of civilization"" comes across as simple Progressive conceit that society can, somehow, be ordered on scientific and/or eugenic grounds for the common good if you just strip people of their liberty. Well, a few short years after this movie was made, the Nazis sounded similar themes -- that it is all right to deny liberty and rights to certain classes of people whom the ruling ""brotherhood of efficiency"" deem unproductive, lacking in the necessary vision, or, as early twentieth-century Progressives often said, simply, ""defective"".  In this film, HG Wells decries the ""brigands"" and ""artists"" who irrationally oppose the ""unity of common order and a common knowledge"", and in so doing, is making a Hegelian argument to establish the case for Progressivism.  As such, this is both an important and extremely difficult film to watch. Given the horrific events that unfolded soon after this film was made, you'll find yourself rooting for HG Wells' enemies...wanting to reach back into time to warn his viewers where his vision leads.",1423008000,8,2785,5.067685589519651

3498664,5,B001BSBBIK,"What a fantastic movie for all those who love the Art-Deco period of art. Raymond Massey is just great! He carried a great deal of power even back then. The set pieces, the planes, the costumes, all first rate. The city, ""Everytown"" toward the end of the movie is VERY Fritz Lang-ish, but more detailed and beautifully white. And those who think Sir Ralph Richardson was always such a great actor need to watch him chew up the scenery as his two characters in the movie. 1936 and they were showing the power of paratroopers...actually a bit scary as the good guys are chuting into the town wearing black outfits. But Raymond, in his character of John Cabal, pulls a Klattu when landing in ""The Bosses"" township. Honestly, just incredible for its day.

3498674,4,B001BSBBIK,"As I was watching this movie, I couldn't help remembering the title of a science fiction writer's biography (I think it was Pohl Anderson), ""The Way the Future Was."" The way it was in 1936 was very art deco.

Actually, they did a reasonably good job of imagining the future. The film starts at 1940 (already the future for them, you see), and war breaks out. It is never actually said that the airplanes that come bombing ""Everytown"" are German, but that's the pot that was boiling in 1936. Only this war wears on and on, and by 1966, there's no gasoline and The Boss's car is pulled by a Clydesdale horse. People are wearing rags and living in ruined buildings, but the Boss and his lady at least live in a luxurious ruin, with gold and satin ornaments that are falling apart.

The Boss, a typical warlord bully sort of character, who wears a variety of furs, is eager to get his airplanes in the sky again so he can bomb the hill people. Then out of the sky comes a small black aircraft like nothing anyone has ever seen before (including you and me; frankly, I doubt that it was aerodynamic). The pilot who gets out (Raymond Massey) is dressed in black with this incredible black headgear which we find out much later is a gas mask. He is quite arrogant and amused at The Boss, and tells him that his group of scientists and engineers is called ""Wings Over the World"" and they've come to ""clean things up.""

Without going into detail, they do. Using a sleep gas which they call ""Peace gas,"" they put everyone out when they land a huge array of enormous planes with two hulls and huge wings, including the ""wing"" in between the two hulls -- powered by propellers!

So the scientists and engineers clean things up, all right, and we have quite a few years of building a new ""Everytown"" under ground, and a bunch of huge machines which are clearly made up of small machines with a foreground of people walking around to make them look huge, and things that were probably specifically designed models, using the same foreground overlay technique. ""Modern"" seems to mean huge, mostly, and all in a very deco style. At last we come down in 2066, and this gleaming underground city is preparing to launch a ""space gun"" -- or rather fire a space gun and launch a ""space bullet"" with two young people in it.

But there's an agitator who wants to stop it (Sir Cedric Hardwicke), and who manages to stir up a huge crowd of protesters against progress by way of an enormous TV screen that comes down in the middle of the city square. I think it's meant to be 3-dimensional, in fact. But Raymond Massey, playing the descendant of the ""Wings Over the World"" guy manages to shoot his daughter and her boyfriend out into space to orbit the moon and return.

The anachronisms are amusing, such as a Plexiglas light display which is supposed to be something to do with controls, because computer monitors (perhaps even computers) had not been visualized. But the funniest thing of all is that the space gun has a sight on the side, just like a gun, even though it has nothing to do with aiming it.

It's an H.G. Wells story, and there are some really corny ""ideology"" speeches that may amuse you. There's a tang of socialism to them, but mostly it's real fun. I'm just barbaric enough to appreciate the ""Everytown"" run by The Boss and imagine myself as the boss's lady, who wears large disks of gold for jewelry.",1337126400,2,3397,4.4781906300484655

3498676,3,B001BSBBIK,"In an alternate universe of H.G. Wells, it began on Christmas Eve 1940 with searchlights sweeping the sky and rumbles of remote explosions.  Fortunately, this initial raid was turned back.  The populace scurries in calm-panic to make ready for the dreaded inevitable war.  Nights later, the bombs begin to fall; in return, the soldiers fire their feeble cannons . . . .

Year after year the war grinds down the pillars of world civilization, until all that remains are the relics of man's machines and a few scattered communities fighting each other over scare resources.  By 1970, a pocket of civilization in the Mediterranean began spreading its wings over the world, conquering all with their airplanes and the gas of peace.

With the consolidation of this new order, its leader directs the construction of vast underground cities, leaving the ruins above to stand as monuments to the old order.  Technical advances were made: radio-television, wrist radios, networks of transportation, life-extension, and the space gun.  Not everyone was happy with this progress.

By 2036, the rumblings of the populace, turned to rebellion after a man makes a speech railing about the sacrifices of the young being made for science.  He demands a halt to shooting two young people around the moon.  After the speech, he leads the rebels in a mass assault on the space gun to stop the autocratic government from firing its powerful cannon . . . .

Overall:  Many scenes are over the top; in the opening, almost every shot has Christmas theme with a war theme in the background.  The film is preachy throughout.  The rebellion's motive doesn't seem credible.  Special Features: the best is the Sci-Fi Toy Commercials.  Picture (DVD): 2.5 to 3, fuzzy.  Colorization: 3, satisfactory, but obviously colorized.",1308441600,,1795,5.0476190476190474

3498678,2,B001BSBBIK,"Didn't watch the colorized version, not because I'm a purist and believe that black and white films should be left as they were intended, I am a purist, but in this case, no amount of color could help such a weak film.
I don't know if they were incredibly nave in 1936, but the extreme outrage and worry demonstrated in this film over the matter of space travel is laughable at best (stupid if I put it kindly); because 75 years later it's practically a non-issue.  It also doesn't help that the acting style of that time is painful to watch: a lot of yelling, arm throwing, chest beating, eyes bulged almost to the point of expulsion.  Everyone is overly conscious of which camera to play to, which was their best side, a lot of LOOK AT ME posturing; very amateurish.  This is especially disheartening because one of my favorite actors played a starring role: Ralph Richardson as The Boss.  Ham is nicest term I can apply to his performance.  Unfortunately, he's not alone; Raymond Massey overplays not one but two characters.  As for the story itself: very dry, very dull, extremely pessimistic, simplistic, dated, and not a little pompous in presenting its tale of woe over the fate of mankind.
Supposedly, there's a 130 minute version of this rant.  I cannot image trying to sit through it; I barely made it through the 92 minute version!
Not a keeper.",1307318400,,1356,4.625
3498679,5,B001BSBBIK,"This is a review of the excellent Ray Harryhausen Colorized version of this 1936 British Classic. As my title implies this is the only motion picture whose screenplay was actually written by H.G. Wells. Imagine having started writing that in 1934 and predicting the Second World War while being off on the date of it's start by only 15 months. The film opens with the bombing of EVERYTOWN by the unmentioned enemy. When Wells went to see the film with a London audience in 1936 he was shocked to find them laughing at his opening. These Londoner's didn't believe their city would ever be bombed. The picture covers 100 years in the lives of the Cabal family from Well's prediction of World War Two starting on Christmas Eve 1940 and going to a future EVERYTOWN in the year 2036. The cast is outstanding with Raymond Massey as John Cabal and his great grandson, Sir Ralph Richardson as the Boss of the plague ravaged EVERYTOWN and Sir Cedric Hardwicke as the the futurist artisan who speaks against the evils of man's progress. William Cameron Menzies is the director and he would go on to direct Gone With the Wind and the original version of Invaders from Mars among other films. The movie is produced by the legendary Alexander Korda. In all a great combination for great entertainment. A side note for British Comedy fans is that the actor playing the security man in 2036 would decided drama was not to his taste and try comedy. His name was Terry Thomas.

As to the quality of this film. I never saw it more clearer and the images are in the correct screen ratio. Every other DVD version I have seen had even the titles cut off. Yes I would agree the sound is not perfect and the colorization is off in scenes due to the quality of the original film, but all in all the viewer can't go wrong. I highly recommend this film to any fan of H.G. Wells.",1298937600,16,1852,4.479289940828402

3498681,1,B001BSBBIK,"I have no idea why this film is lauded and feted as a great classic, as it has to be one of the worst films I have ever wasted my time on.
The various scenes and sets look like they were made in a model workshop and are on the same level as Thunderbirds and other Gerry Anderson films.

Then there is the very annoying habit of the main ""actors"" shouting their lines instead of speaking with normal voices.
Maybe they think they were still in the theater when this alleged film was made?

The irritatingly over dramatic music that plays over a lot of the film, even for scenes/moments for which there is no drama, becomes draining and sould sapping and it is very distracting.

This film ranks, IMO, only 2nd to the worst film in history - The Seventh Seal.

3498682,2,B001BSBBIK,"Claiming to be the leader in restoration and colorization, I expected this release from Legend Films to be superior to previous releases of this public domain film.  Unfortunately, it isn't.

It's difficult to say just exactly what it is they considered restored, but if the viewer is expecting a spotless and clear print minus years of dirt and damage to the film elements, they will be very sadly disappointed.  Legends copy looks to be no better than other public domain releases of the title.  In fact, for my money I'd stick with the 2001 Image release which is of far greater quality and clarity.  Unlike another viewer who praised the colorized version on the Legends disc, I failed to see it as an improvement.  Unlike other Legend Films colorization efforts, such as Paramount's 3-disc release of Irving Berlin's ""Holiday Inn"", and Kino's release of ""She"", the colors in Things To Come seem unnatural and not up to the same standards.

If the buyer desires a decent, though not completely perfect, version of this English classic, I would recommend sticking with the Image release, until someone else (like Criterion) releases a truly restored edition.",1281744000,5,1161,4.984455958549223
3498683,5,B001BSBBIK,"Starting with the year 1940, we are given insight to how humankind progresses or regresses due to the inevitable war that lasts for decades. Will mankind ever learn to live in peace or are we destined to destroy ourselves watch this movie as you are about to see ""THINGS TO COME.""

Usually when a film is colorized, it distracts from the ambience that was designed in a black-and-white environment. However, in this case it actually adds to the viewing enjoyment. The colors are not overwhelming and it looks like this film was originally meant to be colorized. However, for purists the black-and-white version is also included.

For those people that actually have read HG Wells you will find that this film is not too far left field from his original thoughts. Much of HG Wells' works shows that he has some sort of a techno-fascist who believes that scientists and engineers were designed to rule the world. Raymond Massey who makes great speeches; you might remember him from Ayn Rand's the Fountainhead. In this film he states ""and now for the rule of the air man and a new life for mankind."" Another of Raymond Massey's speeches ends with ""all the universe or nothing.""

It is worth seeing, but not owning as you won't want to watch it again.",1493078400,,342,4.230769230769231
8284631,3,B001BSBBIK,"Released in 1936 and based on HG Wells 1933 book, Things to Come envisions a future that suffers three decades of world war, a human-made plague and a new one-world order that opens the way for space travel.

Wells story was a fantastical hope for a future in which everybody will ""come to Jesus"" only to him ""Jesus"" was socialism and obeying a world government. To come to this point we must first endure a second world war that lasts 30 years and destroys the planet, thrusting us into a new Dark Age. As such, this is a post-apocalyptic movie with the corresponding mutants (the plague victims) decades before that genre came into vogue.

While I reject socialism (which is basically communism with a smile), theres a lot of truth to Wells message, which was that the individuals life and actions are inconsequential when compared to the purpose and progress of the entire human race. Both the films ideology and message are irrelevant to whether a movie is entertaining or not, for me anyway. The problem with Things to Come is the story itself, which focuses on three basic times: 1940 (which was five years in the future when the film was made), 1970 and 2036. The mid-section is the longest and dullest, focusing on an annoyingly pompous warlord called The Boss or The Chief (Ralph Richardson).  The story structure simply isn't conducive to involving characters and movie-length drive.

The last act is interesting not because of the story but due to its depiction of the future (2036), which is similar to the futuristic portrayal seen in 1976 Logans Run and pretty much holds up. Wells was way off, however, in regards to humanity making it to the moon, which took place 70 years before his prediction.

In its day Im sure this was an amazing movie, dull characters & tale or not, but great films hold up over time, like 1933s King Kong and 1939's ""The Wizard of Oz."" Things to Come generally doesnt. Yet it's still worth checking out as a period piece.

The film was shot in B&W, but theres a colorized version (which I viewed). It runs 100 minutes and was shot in Denham Studios, Buckinghamshire, England. DIRECTOR: William Cameron Menzies.
