4972415,5,B006816SVU,"I lived in Wilmington, NC, where One Tree Hill was filmed, and I was fortunate to get an in-depth, behind-the-scenes look at what made the show so special.

First, the production value was tremendous. You have never seen a group of people so meticulous in their craft. Every scene had to have exactly the right lighting, and every nano-nugget of dialogue had to be repeated thousands of times until the nuance was just... perfect, so that when Peyton said ""why hello,"" you knew she meant it, and it struck you on some primal level.

I also overheard some of the discussions in the writers' room. It was phenomenal, like being in a beehive of genius, where every little writer bee would cross-pollinate the ideas of the others, and they would work relentlessly all in the service of the Queen. You. You are the queen. The 12-18-y-o girls who watch One Tree Hill are the queen, the honey to their comb. I've seen some of the writer bees at home with their wives and, seriously, all they can think about is you. It's moderately creepy. (Needless to say, this makes the wives a little fidgety, but they put up with it because they know it's only 9 seasons.)

Just to paint the writers' room for you, one writer bee would say something like, ""How about `oh but Lucas, you are the sun to my stars'?"" and another writer bee would fire back, ""Are you kidding? 12-18-y-o girls don't go for that. They want real dialogue, not cheesy bedtime fairytales. How about `oh but Lucas, you know I won't go for that--I'm a tough, modern gal who can buy her own iPods'?"" and another writer bee would fire back, ""Gal? Really? Is this the 19th Century?"" And so on.

I wish you could have seen the way the crew operated on set. Utter professionals. None of them were blessed with movie star good-looks - most of them had a saggy gut and were balding, and for some odd reason they were almost always carrying a half-peeled Snickers Bar - but you've never seen a group of guys so in tune with the modern young-female psyche. Even during their off hours, you'd find them reading pre-teen fashion blogs, trying to understand you, your essence. Such devotion to craft.

One time - and I think this says it all - I walked in on the ""testing"" room, where they had a small horde of young females stationed in front of a TV and hooked up to galvanic skin response sensors. The crew would present various scenarios on the TV - Chad Michael Murray with a varsity jacket, Chad Michael Murray without a varsity jacket; Rape scene in a basement, Rape scene at the prom - and then they'd scientifically analyze the results from the skin sensors to determine which permutations elicited the highest physiological arousal. The whole point, you see, was to maximize arousal, to make you as lustful or as disturbed as possible. And what really made One Tree Hill unique was the professionalism and dedication, the almost clinical way in which they went about their business. It's why the show will go down in the pantheon of not just the greatest shows ever, but of the greatest artistic productions period. Customer is queen!",1339891200,23,3084,4.58983666061706

4972420,1,B006816SVU,I was under the impression that I was purchasing *NEW* DVDs. What I received was far from it. Most of the DVDs had scuff marks and/or scratches. Some even had actual finger prints on them. The majority of the discs in Season 8 look like burnt copies that were pressed to look like the original artwork on the discs. I am extremely disappointed in this purchase.,1518480000,,361,4.484848484848484
4972421,1,B006816SVU,Disappointing. Upsetting. The box set of DVDs of One Tree Hill doesn't work. No matter what devise I try to use the DVDs they won't play.

4972424,2,B006816SVU,Picture of listed product is not what I received. The picture given makes it seem as if you are purchasing a box set when in reality you are just receiving the 9 seasons with no extras. I thought I was purchasing a box set which would include additional content that is not included if you buy seasons separately. Very disappointed that I paid so much for something that I did not receive.,1516492800,3,389,4.416666666666667

I didn't use my dvd's for a long time because I was watching on Netflix, but since cancelling my Netflix account, I recently opened these and they are terrible. The video quality is horrible, but what's worse is that the dvd's freeze, skip scenes, and the commentary for some of the episodes do not even match the episode that it's supposed to be. I wonder if these are pirated because I can't imagine legitimate DVD's being this utterly crappy. PLEASE do NOT waste your money on this garbage.",1498348800,,602,4.635514018691588

4972455,2,B006816SVU,"Love this show, but was completely underwhelmed by the packaging/delivery of this product. Several discs for seasons 4 and 9 were floating around in the plastic cases with little bits of plastic instead of being held in place, so they have marks and scratches on them that I'm hoping won't effect the playing quality. Also, season 5 was missing the booklet that tells you which disc is has which episode. This is may not be that big of a deal to some people, but it's highly irritating to me personally.
Makes you wonder if these were a returned product that was just resold to another customer.",1480032000,11,595,4.622641509433962
4972456,4,B006816SVU,"Yet another series about the trials & tribulations of high school students & life after high school.  It's centered around basketball not football as Friday Night Lights was.  This time it's Tidewater North Carolina not outside Dallas, Texas.

The story is predictable.  The characters are predictable.  The dialogue is predictable.  And yet I really enjoyed it because of the talented actors who made me care for them & their lives. Plus there is lots of eye candy for men & women.

Since the series ran for eight seasons (2003 - 2012) & there are 187 episodes there were 900+ actors named by IMDB.  The actors who stood out for me include James Lafferty (Nathan Scott), Hillarie Burton (Peyton Sawyer), Sophia Bush (Brooke Davis), Jackson Brundage (James Lucas Scott). Barbara Alyn Woods (Deb Scott), Tyler Hilton (Chris Keller), Brett Claywell (Tim Smith), Bryan Greenberg (Jake Jaglieski), Kieran Hutchison (Andy Hargrove), Micheala McManus (Lindsey Strauss), Joe Manganiello (Owen Morello), Michael Trucco (Cooper Lee), Matt Barr (Derek/Ian Banks), etc.",1477094400,,1058,5.331325301204819

On netflix they cut out at least 10 minutes if not more, so the dvd has the full episode. You get gag reels, on set diaries, and many other videos.

I did watch it faithfully, from the beginning when I found it on dvd. and from there was quickly hooked and looking forward to the second season! This show is unique. It's one of my favorite shows of all time. I have all 9 seasons on dvd. The characters were relatable, great music and guest stars. Although sometimes the story lines were a little out there, (nanny Carrie I am looking at you!!) they were still great. When this show lost characters, you actually felt the loss. Mark Schwahn did a hell of a job creating, writing etc. on this show. When the 2 major characters (Lucas and Peyton) left at the end of season 6, the show lost something. However, the show did really well after they left. There are some shows, when they finish they NEED or SHOULD to be finished, but not One Tree Hill, they finished strong.

I was going to give them to her as a Christmas gift  but decided to wait for her birthday. (March 2nd) Once opened(March 3rd), we soon found out they will not play in ""our region"". I tried to see if I could return or exchange for ones that would work. Nope, too much time had transpired. I did not check when I received them because I had no idea that DVD's would not work in certain areas. I am out the money. MovieMars would not even work with me at all. Very dissatisfied.",1520294400,,565,4.18348623853211
