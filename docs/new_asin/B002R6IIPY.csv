8378424,1,B002R6IIPY,I wanted Mighty Mouse!  Mighty Mouse is NOT the star in every cartoon presented.  This is almost a classic bait and switch.,1459296000,,123,4.545454545454546

8378427,1,B002R6IIPY,"The quality of the video is poor.  The colors are washed out.  Sound is tinny and garbled at times.  Animation is jumpy. Grown ups will be disappointed that it doesn't live up to the memories.

The content is inappropriate for children by today's standards.  Knife attacks, gunfire, a grown men chasing a little girls (Little Audrey and Lulu), name calling, alcohol inoxication.  Make a judgement call if you are buying this for kids, my five year-old rated it as some parts boring and some parts scary.  My five and six year-old both had trouble following the storyline as some of the humor is social commentary on the times.

Contains:  Mighty Mouse: Wolf Wolf
Bars and Stripes Forever
Little Audrey: Goof Goofy Gander
Little Lulu: Cad & Caddy
Mutt & Jeff: Westward Who
Mutt & Jeff: Slick Sleuths
Baby Huey: Pest Pupil
Baby Huey: Quack A Doodle Doo
Herman the Mouse: Cheese Burglar
Buzzy the Crow: The Stupidstitious Cat - listed on case but not on disc

No bonus features.",1274572800,6,975,4.715976331360947
8378428,1,B002R6IIPY,"Very disappointed.  Color was totally washed out, as if someone tried to colorize a b&w video.  I remember this series from the 50s and how vibrant the color was on screen.  Do not buy this video.  However, Amazon took it back and gave me credit.  Thanks Amazon.",1272412800,11,262,4.48936170212766

8378430,3,B002R6IIPY,"There is only one Might Mouse cartoon on this disk.  It is ""Wolf Wolf"" which I have seen a hundred times because it's the same Mighty Mouse cartoon that is included in every cartoon collection.  Also included:

-Bars and Stripes Forever: a Warner Bros cartoon about prison life.  Oddly I don't remember seeing this one in the Looney Tunes Golden Collection...
-Goofy Goofy Gander: an unremarkable Little Audrey cartoon in which Audrey goes to Mother Goose land.
-Cad & Caddy: a particularly mean-spirited Little Lulu short in which Lulu play caddy to a rage-a-holic golfer.
-Westward Whoa ... and
-Slick Sleuths: two Mutt & Jeff cartoons with pseudo-sound.  The characters make strange ""woop woop"" noises instead of talking, which should date these cartoons between 1919-1923, but they are in COLOR, so I'm not sure what was going on.
-Pest Pupil: Baby Huey is tutored by a duck version of Albert Einstein.  Very lackluster.
-Quack a Doodle Doo: the origin of Baby Huey.  Famous Studios beat themselves to death trying to come up with a popular character with the appeal of a Bugs Bunny, Mickey Mouse or Daffy Duck.  They failed.
-Cheese Burglar: Herman the Mouse teams up with the henpecked husband of a domineering chicken.
-The Stupidstitious Cat: I watched this disk recently and already I forgot what this cartoon was about.  That's how much of an impression it made.

The transfer quality is not very good, and there's no menu, so if you want to skip to a particular cartoon you have to play the disk and then use the chapter skip button to jump forward.  But, hey, it was cheap and you get what you pay for.  I consider it an acceptable product for the price.  But only just barely.",1270684800,18,1689,4.743150684931507
