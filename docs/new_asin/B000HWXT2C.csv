8141669,5,B000HWXT2C,"A hit for Bellini in the 1830's which faded away after a few decades of success, this version of Romeo and Juliet (not taken directly from Shakespeare but from an 1818 Italian  play) was revived in 1935 and has been consistently performed since the 1950's. While not considered to be in the same class as the top trio of Bellini's opera's, it has been sung by members of the pantheon in modern opera (Pavarotti, Scotto, Sills, etc. ) and deserves a hearing by anyone attuned to the works of that period.
Leading the cast in this version, is Patrizia Ciofi, who does a fine job as the unlucky woman who can't make up her mind between staying with her tyrannical father and her clan or taking up life with her lover, leader of an opposing clan. (No suggestion in this version that she is a teenager.) Clara Polito gives sterling support in the lesser role of Romeo (lesser in this version) although, frankly, while it has been customary (although not always the practice in modern versions) to substitute for the male, I found it disconcerting when being up on stage with the camera rather than sitting up, up, up in the nethermost galleries viewing from afar. The supporting trio Formaggia, Sacchi, and Amodio are quite able.
Scenic design is nothing to write about but does its job which is what one can say of the staging as well. Costumes are modern dress with the somewhat anomalous situation of pointing a pistol or rifle but singing of swords...but if one can accept a woman for a man, why should a pistol rather than a sword trouble you. Happy note for all of us....subtitles are quite good and are attuned to every nuance of speech and song..., at least more than in many other opera productions.
My judgment: if you like the period in which it was created, this recording will be a pleasure. It probably does not make it onto anyone's top  50 list  but is worth listening to.",1448150400,2,1883,4.56508875739645
