8508089,3,B0071BN1F2,"This video is essentially what you would get if you stood on the sidelines and watched the Stanford women's lacrosse team go thru an agility workout (46 min). The audio and sound quality are excellent. What the video lacks is expert demonstration of the drills. Listening to Coach Moser comments/coaching-tips during the video, I believe she is an expert on agility training. I encourage her to re-issue this video with a supplemental section with her demonstrating each drill.",1423958400,,477,5.128205128205129
