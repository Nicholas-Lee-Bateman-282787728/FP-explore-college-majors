6680573,2,B00NUYGA0W,"This movie is probably better for older girls who are maybe growing out of Lalaloopsy. I think this was made to be similar to the Bratz, Ever After High, etc type of shows for girls. I like that the characters are more modestly dressed than the characters on those other shows, but that's about all I liked. Rather than sweetly modeling positive friendship and manners like the original Lalaloopsy, these girls are more snarky and not as polite. I don't think that manners and morals are something you grow out of. I was disappointed. My daughter picked up on this and she asked me to turn it off.",1424217600,,597,4.537037037037037

8680389,5,B00NUYGA0W,"Super cute movie, unsurprisingly.  Very much in keeping with all Lalaloopsy stuff.  My six-year-old daughter loves it, and I have watched it with her.  I love the character of Storm E. Sky.  She's a nice injection of a slightly cynical and pessimistic character, but without overdoing it, given the context; this is Lalaloopsyland, after all.  A nice addition to the Lala franchise.",1424649600,,382,5.096774193548387
