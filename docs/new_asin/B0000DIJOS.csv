1925218,5,B0000DIJOS,"WOW!  I am not much on documentary DVD's, and I wasn't too sure about this one.  I mostly buy pay per view DVD's and the WWE really hasn't produced a good ppv in recent months.  So, I decided I would buy this DVD simply because I am a steel cage fan and I wanted to re-live the memories of the ""Brett Hart vs. Owen Hart"" feud.  This turned out to be more than what I bargained for.  ALL the matches, with the exception of ""Brett Hart vs. Isaac Yankem,"" are great matches to watch.  Many reveiewers have stated that most of the matches are highlighted, and this is true.....but you still get to see approx. 75-80% of the match.  Maybe even more!  It's not too bad highlighted.  Of course there are 11 Complete matches that are extras on the DVD, including the famous cage match of ""Ric Flair vs. Dusty Rhodes.""  There are two things about this DVD that I do not like....FIRST, the documentary.  I wish that when they did the documentary that they could have gotten some of the original wrestlers to maybe comment on the match, instead of maybe two or three doing the commentary.  SECOND....Did the WWE forget about the ""Rikishi vs. Val Venis"" cage match from Fully Loaded 2000?  I KNOW....some wrestling critics are saying, ""Why would you include that?""  Well, the answer is that it could have taking the place of the ""Brett Hart vs. Isaac Yankem"" match, which totally sucked....lol  I mean the Rikishi/Val Venis cage match was an awesome match, which produced a great psychology going into the match and we got to see a 400 POUND man fly off the cage.....AND LAND ON VAL VENIS!!!  How many of you would actually lie and take a 400 pound man jumping off the cage and landing on u???  I doubt I would!
All in all this DVD deserves 5 stars for simply putting great matches on the DVD.  That, and the fact that the WWE finally produced a good enough DVD to actually purchase. lol  Go buy the DVD and enjow WRESTLING MOST INCREDIBLE STEEL CAGE MATCHES!!!!",1070755200,2,1950,4.4576271186440675
1925219,4,B0000DIJOS,"This DVD brought back a lot of memories for me, I've been a wrestling fan for twenty years and it was nice to see the Bob Backlund matches that are included, against Jimmy Snuka, Pat Patterson, and Stan Hansen, although it was a strange mix of matches to show.  There were a lot of great wrestlers that Backlund faced in a cage, like Adrian Adonis, Jesse Ventura, and Superstar Billy Graham among others that I would have preferred to see over Patterson and Hansen, but no big deal as those matches were great.  The newer stuff was great, those matches show how cage matches have evolved over the years, although nothing will top Bret-Owen.  The NWA matches were a nice touch also, but there are two main matches included here that made this well worthwhile.
The first was the Snuka-Muraco match.  Although short, Snuka's dive off of the top is great to have on DVD to watch over and over.  While this wasn't Snuka's first jump from the top of the cage, this one connected.  As another reviewer stated, if you look close, you can see a young Mick Foley in attendance.
The top item on here, for me, was the Bruno Sammartino-Ivan Koloff cage match.  There are clips of Bruno-Zbysko from Shea Stadium, but the Bruno-Koloff match is presented in its entirety.  As a long-time Bruno fan, this was a real treat for me to see Bruno in his prime kicking Ivan Koloff's ass all over the cage.  The end especially stands out to me, as the triumphant Bruno raises his arm in victory and walks out of the cage, to the roar of the appreciative MSG crowd, while Koloff is left beaten and slumped over the ropes in the far corner of the cage.  Great stuff!",1070409600,,1640,4.473154362416107
1925220,4,B0000DIJOS,"There's a lot of good stuff here, but by showing clips of a match and then including the un-cut match as an extra, a lot of space gets used up that could've been filled with more matches!  That's my only real complaint.  Well, that, and the fact that none of the old War Games matches are included!  There's a lot of must have matches on here, including Snuka v. Muraco from MSG (you can see Mick Foley if you look real closely); Magnum TA v. Tully Blanchard; Bret v. Owen.
It was a spur of the moment purchase for me, and I think I only paid $10 for it, so I more than got my money's worth.
...Now I'm lookin' forward to the Ric Flair DVD!!",1069632000,,641,4.071428571428571
1925221,3,B0000DIJOS,"The fact that the WWE owns the majority of wrestling footage in the country, you'd figure that this would have been worth the money to purchase. This dvd set has only a handful of matches in full (which is pretty bad considering the caliber of talent that is featured). The only matches that I sat through and enjoyed were the Magnum T.A.- Tully Blanchard, Snuka-Muraco, and Bret-Owen. I wasn't to crazy about the Rhodes-Flair match though. Anyway, they could have thrown in some War Games matches from the NWA/WCW era. I believe those matches would have made the dvd's worth buying. I'm gonna end up trading it in for The Ric Flair Collection. Thanks!",1069113600,,652,4.728070175438597
1925222,3,B0000DIJOS,"WWEs ""Bloodbath"" DVD set is an honest attempt at a great concept. The WWF's original Coliseum Video release from the 80's titled, ""Inside the Steel Cage"", was a much better collection, since there were no ""hosts"" or wrestlers commenting on matches. I was really disappointed at how much time was wasted with interviews and hosting when, if chosen correctly, the steel cage matches would speak for themselves. It would have been a better idea to have had nothing but complete matches with the added wrestler's comments as the Easter Eggs. Keep the matches and classic storylines as the main focus of the set and include comments for those who want to look for them.
There were also serious issues with the matches that were included in this set. The abundance of Bob Backlund matches was ridiculous. I think the Backlund-Snuka match was a must and should have been included in its entirety in place of the Backlund-Patterson and Backlund-Hansen matches. There were also several glaringly obvious omissions in Andre the Giant, Big John Studd, Superstar Billy Graham, Ken Patera, Randy Savage, Ricky Steamboat, Roddy Piper, Greg Valentine, the British Bulldogs, and many, many others who had classic matches that were overlooked for a series of recent, more forgettable matches. Surprisingly, the ONLY Hulk Hogan match included was only shown in clips and was the most over-played match in WWF/Hulk Hogan history. They could have included one of the more obscure Hogan-Studd, Hogan-Bundy, Hogan-Muraco, Hogan-Andre or Hogan-Flair cage matches that haven't been seen in a home video release. Instead, they include ""highlights"" of Hogan-Orndorff from SNME for the umpteenth time. The wrestlers included was severely lacking in my opinion and there was room for a third disc to truly include a better scope of the classic cage matches of the past 3 or 4 decades.
The inclusion of matches within the past five years was totally unnecessary in my opinion. The abundance of VCRs and DVD recorders today makes these matches future classics which many fans have already recorded. I think the WWE has a HUGE market with people like myself that enjoy the matches from the early days of the WWF. We want to see the footage that was shown before every home had three VCRs. The bootleggers have control of this market, because the WWF fails to realize this group of fans that are looking for the matches that they grew up watching.
That said there were a lot of high points with this set as well. The fact that the NWA World Title matches were included made the set worth buying. The Magnum T.A. - Tully Blanchard ""I Quit"" match was one of the first cage matches I ever saw as a teenager, so it was a thrill to see that match again in DVD quality. Also, to have the Snuka-Muraco match in its entirety on DVD is a bonus. If you are a current fan and enjoy cage matches, you'll love this set.
I wish they would have put a little more effort into making the matches and more specifically the wrestlers more plentiful. When you think about it, they had several decades of footage to choose from between the WWF and NWA libraries. I look at the past 30+ years of pro-wrestling and to think that out of the 20 matches included in this collection (between highlights and complete bouts) nearly half occurred in the past 10 years?! That's truly blasphemous to the WWF's and NWA's history.",1068681600,,3364,4.791738382099828
1925223,5,B0000DIJOS,"I bought Bloodbath the day it hit the shelfs. I have no complaints. It's a great mixture of some of the old & some of the new. It was also nice to see the WWE finally use the old WWF & NWA footage. Matches include Magnum TA vs Tully Blanchard (brutual match), The Rock 'n' Roll Express vs Ole & Arn Anderson, Bret Hart vs Owen Hart (SummerSlam 94), & 8 more matches. I can't wait until Ric Flair's DVD set come's out. The full matches looked great.

1925224,5,B0000DIJOS,"Vince McMahon proved a lot of cynics wrong.  Those critics that said Vince would risk anything to ruin Bruno Sammartino's legacy, that said Vince would never show Bret Hart in a positive light again, or that said Vince would hoard the priceless NWA/WCW library, should all eat crow after this DVD.
The program itself is subpar for WWE, as the interviews with Gerald Brisco, Tommy Dreamer, and Jerry Lawler suck more energy out of the matches than they generate excitement.  The people featured in matches aren't asked to provide insight, so we have a second-hand account of these matches, and like I said, they are lackluster comments.
Regardless, the program is good!  It's probably the first time WWE has tried to restore faded glory of yesteryear SuperStars, like Bruno Sammartino or Bob Backlund.  Those two men have five matches on the DVD.  Even Hulk Hogan and Bret Hart are given regards (despite anti-WWE tirades), as Jonathan Coachman even segues from Ric Flair to Bret Hart by comparing great World champions.
The program is good, but the extra features make it great!  There are 11 matches shown full-length, including Jimmy Snuka versus Don Muraco and Bret Hart versus Owen Hart.  There are no less than four Easter Eggs that recap feuds leading to the matches.  The Easter Egg for the Bruno Sammartino/Larry Zbyszko feud is better than the footage in the program (found by pushing >> while highlighting that segment).
Not every classic cage match could be included, but the matches WWE selected are as good as any collection would be.  I had high expectations for the disc, and after the initial disappointment that the majority of the matches are highlighted, I found the DVD surpassed my overall expectations.  I can imagine this disc will be pulled from my collection, time to time, and whichever match I was hoping to watch will be thoroughly enjoyed.",1067644800,,1868,4.920382165605096
1925225,5,B0000DIJOS,"I was expecting just the matches - which would have been great, but you get so much more.  Jonathan Coachman introduces the matches and they tell and show how the feud escalated to the steel cage match.  Examples:  for the Snuka vs. Muraco match, they show the original footage of Snuka getting ready for a match when Muraco came out and spat at him, then they show Snuka diving over the top rope onto him.  Then they show some interview footage of Snuka leading up to the cage match.
For the Hogan vs. Orndorff match, they show the footage of where Orndorff first turned on Hogan starting their feud.
Great footage and a very well done set of discs.",1067472000,,650,4.436974789915967
1925226,4,B0000DIJOS,"I can't give 5 stars because when they made this compilation they forget one of the greatest:
Mankind vs. The Rock vs. Ken Shamrock al IYH: BreakDown on September/1998. It was incredible the way that Mankind almost defeat both of them, flying from the top of the cell to land on this pair of morons. Sadly the referee applied that stupid rule of nail one of your oponents in the mat instead of go out of the cage, and the Rock won nailing Ken. Meanwhile Mankind scalate the cage.
This was one of the best matches that I ever seen !!!",1066003200,,533,4.287128712871287

The rest lived up to the name. I recommend watching the cage matches from the 1980's like Dusty Rhodes-Rick Flair,Magnum T.A.-Tully Blanchard & The Midnight Express-The Andersons.

1925280,4,B0000DIJOS,"Cage Matches! The place where every wrestling superstar puts their skills to the ultimate test! It's so great to find the most beloved superstars of the WWE being put into a double disk, (one with like the highlights of the matches, and the other disk with the full coverage of each match) for every WWE fan's pleasure.

However one match is missing from the disk. By the time I'm composing this review, I am in no position to access the DVD to point out the missing match, so pardon me for that.

But I believe the composers of this package will have the list, so please re-check the DVD and you will soon find what is missing from the DVD.

Overall, in my opinion, It's a great WWE Production which every WWE fan should have.",1295740800,,727,4.37037037037037

1925282,3,B0000DIJOS,"Bloodbath could have been a great set. It was weird that WWE put out a best of cage match dvd in an age where they just really put out wrestler dvds. This one is far from the Ladder Match dvd. That dvd had 3 dvds full of great matches but did have an annoying guy commentating on the dvd just like this dvd. They run down a history of cage matches really quick so if you blinked, you missed it. The matches are good though.",1196208000,,423,3.988235294117647

1925284,3,B0000DIJOS,"I like the concept of this DVD set, as cage matches have always been a favorite for this old school fan.  However, this is not as well-executed as it could've been.  My main problem is a problem I have with 90% of the WWE DVD releases of this nature.

LITTLE TO NO COMPLETE MATCHES!

Practically every match is joined ""in progress"" or cut up so much you'd think Jason Voorhees was in charge of editing.  That takes away a lot of the enjoyment for me.

Of course, the nostalgic value of most of this matches make this a fun selection to watch once or twice.

But that's about it.",1154304000,3,578,4.247706422018348
1925285,4,B0000DIJOS,THIS IS A GREAT DVD ABOUT CAGE MATCHES. IT HAS A LOT OF VIOLENT MATCHES ON IT AND A LOT OF CLASSIC CAGE MATCHES. BUT THE REASON WHY I I AM GIVING THIS 4 STARS IS BECAUSE MOST OF THE MATCHES ON HERE ARE JIPS.(MATCHES JOINED IN PROGRESS.) IT WOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER IF ALL THE MATCHES WERE FULL. BUT ON DISC 2 IT HAS 7 FULL MATCHES BUT THAT IS STILL NO ENOUGH MATCHES. THIS DVD IS WORTH A BUY BUT REMEBER ONLY 7 MATCHES ARE FULL.,1153094400,5,426,3.852272727272727
1925286,2,B0000DIJOS,"(It is really random the selection they used as you hardly have a great cage match in every choice and for the millionth time that WWE lies to us, Snuka-Backlund was NOT 1980! It was June 28, 1982! The date they claim from 1980 was Backlund-Patera in a Texas Death Match. A company with that much money has no excuse for such a continous screw up! Snuka was not working for Vince Sr in 1980, he was in the NWA feuding with Ric Flair as part of Gene Anderson's stable!)

1925297,3,B0000DIJOS,"The finest cage matches in wrestling history are showcased in this two-disc collection. Well, sort of. It's only the standard steel cage matches (specially-designed cage matches like Hell In A Cell, Elimination Chamber, and War Games aren't included). In all honesty, these aren't exactly the best cage matches in wrestling. You get to see Bret Hart vs. Owen Hart from Summerslam 1994 (a bloodless and somewhat boring 40-minute technical match), Steve Austin vs. Vince McMahon, the legendary Jimmy Snuka vs. Don Muraco match, and a couple of other odd choices. It would have been cool to see them include an ECW cage match or two and the Hogan vs. Bundy match at Wrestlemania II. (the first and only Wrestlemania main event in a steel cage). Seeing as the WWE has well over 30+ years of matches from WWF, WCW/NWA, ECW, and AWA in their video library, they could have certainly come up with a far more impressive collection.",1126396800,3,923,4.848101265822785
1925298,4,B0000DIJOS,"This DVD is a fine collection of steel cage matches spanning the years 1975-2002. The DVD is divded into 2 discs. The first disc has chapters describing the history and characters in each of the steel cage matches. Gerry Brisco, Spike Dudley, Tommy Dreamer and Hugh Finkel provide background information on a few of the matches. Jonathen Coachman is the MC and he also helps to fleshen out the matches with historical and background feud details.

  The following matches on disc one have chapters and are shown in clipped format:

  1) Bruno Sammartino vs Larry Zybszko - If you double right click on this chapter, you will get a hidden interview from Sammartino and clip of the match between these two that set the stage for the steel cage match.  Larry Zybszko was a favorite of mine and it's always fun to watch him, even in clipped format.

  2) Bob Backlund vs Jimmy Snuka - This is joined in progress (JIP). Hey, it's the ""Superrfly's"" match that put him on the wrestling map. See how Snuka earned his alias.

  3) Hulk Hogan vs Paul Orndorff - JIP. The highlight of this match is getting to listen to Jesse Ventura doing the color commentary! This was a ""old school"" style brawl with the underrated ""Mr. Wonderful"" playing heel. It's always entertaining watching ""Mr. Wonderful"" perform!

  4) Ric Flair vs Ronnie Garvin - JIP. This was my second favorite match on this disc even though it's JIP. This is the stiffest match on the disc.  They go at each other in a fury rarely seen between two wrestlers.  Damn, my chest hurts just from watching this! Double right click on this chapter and you will get to see the ending of the first steel cage match between these two in which Ronnie wins the World Championship belt.

  5) Isaac Yankem vs Bret Hart - Jerry Lawler provides
background information on this one.  This has clips of the match.

  6) HHH vs The Rock - JIP and clipped. Would haved loved to have seen the complete match as the parts that are shown are great. Davey Boy Smith interferes in this one.

  7) Stone Cold Steve Austin vs Vince McMahon - The first half of the match is clipped. The second half is shown. This was a pure squash of a match. Paul White (aka ""Big Show"") interferes in this one.

  8) Edge & Christian vs The Hardy Boyz - JIP. The ending of the match is shown. Edge and Christian are the World Tag-Team Champions and the Hardy Boyz are fresh from their stint in ECW. Some fantastic aerial displays and splashes. Would have loved to have seen the whole match!

  9) Kurt Angle vs Chris Benoit - JIP at the point were Angle does a moonsault off the top of the cage! The 2nd half is clipped. Benoit does a flying headbut off the top of the cage! Steve Austin interferes in this one. Another match that should have been shown in its entirety.

  The following matches are the ones shown in their entirety (or most of) on disc one: My ratings of the matches are out of 5 *****:

  1) Bob Backlund vs Pat Patterson - World Champion Bob Backlund is in a fight for his life from Pat. The match is JIP as the first couple minutes are cut, and the second half is clipped a little.  Both men ""color"" themselves, and Pat pulls out the brass knuckles. Is that enough to win the belt from Bob? A nice brawl. Rating - ***

  2) Bruno Sammartino vs Ivan Koloff - World Champion Sammartino defends against the Russian Bear.  A total squash! Why this is on here is beyond me. Rating - ** (2 stars just for seeing Koloff).

  3) Don Muraco vs Jimmy Snuka - ""The Superfly"" soars and MSG roars!  Muraco is the reigning Intercontinental Champion and Snuka is out for blood. A bloody slugfest between two of my all-time favorites. Love the ending! Rating - ***

  4) Bob Backlund vs Stan Hanson - World Champion Backlund defends against the insane Stan ""The Man"" Hanson. It's great to get to see Stan on DVD. This was a pure brawl with both men getting ""colored"". The ending is lame, but it's OK to see a different kind  of finish. Rating - *** (Ending almost makes it lose a star).

  The following matches are on disc #2 and all are in their entirety:
  1)  Tully Blanchard vs Magnum TA (I Quit Match) - U.S. Champion Tully Blanchard defends against the rugged TA. Anytime I get a chance to watch one of the greatest heels in wrestling history (Tully Blanchard) perform, it's a treat!  Tully Blanchard, the master of the slingshot suplex, is in the brawl of his life! This was a fanatastic match with great ring psychology and brutal hits. A wooden chair is broken in the ring and a spike from the chair is used to make one of them say ""I Quit!"" Great match. Rating  - ****

  2)  Ric Flair vs Dusty Rhodes - World Champion Ric Flair vs ""The American Dream"". Rhodes is going for his 3rd title and The ""Nature Boy"" is in the best shape of his life and trying to keep his winning streak alive. This was a great ""old school"" match with awesome ring psychology and some brutal face to cage grating! It's always fun watching these two go at it! Rating - ****

  3)  Rock 'n' Roll Express vs The Andersons - World Tag-Team Champions Ole and Arn Anderson (The Minnesota Wrecking Crew) take on Rock (Robert Gibson) 'n' Roll (Rickey Morten) in a fantastic display of tag-team teamwork in action. Two of the alltime best square off and they don't disappoint! I loathed the Rock 'n' Roll Express as a teenager, as I thought they were too '80's rock cliche with their glam outfits, bandanas everywhere and mullets galore. Buuuuuuut, they were tough, i'll give them that. And what can I say about about the Andersons other they were tough as nails and could breakdown anyone. This was a great match!  Rating  - ****

  4) Bret Hart vs Owen Hart - World Champion Bret Hart takes on his brother Owen with their family watching from the front row. This was a classic match as the brothers really go at each other. Alot of high-impact moves. Awesome! Rating - ****

  5) Mankind vs HHH - The 1997 King of The Ring Winner - Hunter Hearst Helmsley in a slimmer version of what you see now.  The steroids are just beginning to take effect on HHH. HHH does a top of the cage suplex on Mankind (he barely gets Mankind turned over) and Mankind does a top of the cage flying elbow onto HHH.  Chyna interferes but is it enough for HHH? Rating  - ****

  6)  Shawn Michaels vs Marty Jannetty - The two former tag-team partners and best friends are now mortal enemies. Intercontinental Champion Shawn Michaels is water bloated from steroids and he has a mullet cut from the mullet gods! The ""Boy Toy"" has Kevin Nash (""Diesel"") outside the cage. Is ""Diesel's"" presence enough for Michaels to defeat his former partner? This was a nice match with shades of future HBK stylings seen here. Bill Alfonso is the referee! Rating  - ***

  7) Edge vs Kurt Angle - The best match on the disc! Kurt Angle is one of the greatest wrestlers EVER and every match he does is met with expectation and excitement because he is a true professional!  Kurt does a ""Angle Slam"" off the top rope and Edge lands a top rope ""spear"" on Angle.  ""Hollywood"" Hulk Hogan interferes, but for who? This match is interrupted for a TV commercial as it was shown on Smackdown. A terrific match! Rating  - *****
  Overall, this is a nice DVD collection of steel cage matches that spans 3 decades and two wrestling organizations (WWF/WWE and NWA).  The pre-match background information is a good touch. Well done Vince! I would recommend buying this.",1123200000,20,7409,4.447505584512286
1925299,4,B0000DIJOS,"NOTE #1: The first 4 matches are on Disc-1, while the remaining 7 are on Disc-2.

NOTE #2: Take the match ratings with a little grain of salt. It's actually quite difficult to watch cage match after cage match & rate them individually on quality. A good guide though is the fairly recent Taboo Tuesday cage match between Ric Flair & Randy Orton. I rated that bout a 7.

BRUNO SAMMARTINO vs IVAN KOLOFF (1975): The mesh style cage was used 30 years ago, but with no support at the top. This made the cage very shaky, and the ropes were almost as weak! Ten minute match which hardly consists of a proper wrestling move & is dominated by Bruno's repetitive offense. Huge props to Koloff for his selling, and never protecting himself on the cage shots to his bald head. Hard to get into & shortish old-style cage match, but intense & brutal enough to make it a partial success. Match Rating...7

BOB BACKLUND vs PAT PATTERSON (1979): For some reason, we join this match already in progress. Interesting game of cat & mouse, as both combatants attempt to climb out of the cage at every opportunity they get. Good mix of action as there is enough brutality included for both men to badly bleed, while (especially Backlund) throws in the occasional wrestling move. I more associated these 2 guys with the midcard, but they (with help from the cage) do a great job of looking like main-eventers here. Hard to rate as not all of the match is shown (13 minutes is), but very good from what can be viewed. Match Rating...8

BOB BACKLUND vs STAN HANSEN (1981): Inconsistent match which took a while to win me over, and when it finally did, it ended prematurely at the 9 minute mark. For those that haven't seen Stan Hansen, he is a huge man who plays a heel almost perfectly. His taunting & dirty tactics are almost equal to that of Flair. But his selling was questionable for a bout which Backlund clearly had the better of. One thing which did impress me was the pace, but then again, the match only lasted 9 minutes. Match Rating...7

DON MURACO vs JIMMY SNUKA (1983): Infamous bout which is a little overshadowed by Mick Foley's favorite memory (which doesn't even happen during the match). It's a shame that this match only lasts 7 minutes (plus aftermath), because there is so much to like here. A super intense feud which looks more like one for the WWE Championship than the InterContinental Title. Both men play their roles perfectly, while there is a great mixture of brawling & wrestling. While the match is definitely too short, the accidental ending is clever & the aftermath is exhilarating. Match Rating...8

TULLY BLANCHARD vs MAGNUM TA (1985): This is a different cage match in that it has ""I Quit"" stipulations & couldn't be won by pinfall or escaping the cage. Definitely intense enough & a good variation due to the stipulation. Like most ""I Quit"" matches, this does get a little repetitive in the middle stages, as each wrestler constantly goes to the microphone to no avail. However, things turn violent when Tully breaks a wooden chair & attempts to spike Magnum in the face. The face fights back though & uses the spike himself, resulting in the bloody victory at the 15 minute mark. Interesting to note that a Hebner is the referee, and it's just plain weird to see a microphone with a long chord being used. Ahhhh, technology. Match Rating...8

RIC FLAIR vs DUSTY RHODES (1986): Methodically paced, old-school psychological battle between these 2 longtime adversaries. I have to admit that I was never a huge fan of Rhodes, so I find something not quite right in an even & long bout between these 2. The cage was used sparingly, but wisely, and I finally got to see Flair actually perform a top-rope move; The messiest flying bodypress I've ever seen! Hard to rate due to it's pacing, but I have to be critical that the bout sort of ended prematurely at the 21 minute mark, after a lot of setting up suggesting it would last at least 30 minutes. And to top it off, Rhodes wins the title. Match Rating...7

THE ROCK & ROLL EXPRESS (ROBERT GIBSON & RICKY MORTON) vs THE ANDERSONS (OLE & ARN) (1986): Normal tag-team rules applied here, and man do the Andersons use them well. Their tagging is textbook perfect & they completely dominate this 12 minute bout, first working on Gibson's leg, then on Morton's arm. Unfortunately, the match ends very prematurely & in the favor of the Express. Many may not like this, but it struck a positive chord with me. The tag format was also a good & welcome change of pace. Match Rating...8

SHAWN MICHAELS vs MARTY JANNETTY (1993): The former tag-team partners go at it here in this 13 minute match. Unfortunately, they don't show anywhere near enough imagination to take advantage of the cage. Still sufficient & definitely watchable, but no high-flying from their tag-team days, nor the intensity of some of their other singles matches. Diesel helps HBK get the win. By the way, if anyone knows who the annoying heel commentator is on this match, please let me know. Match Rating...7

BRET HART vs OWEN HART (1994): The best match on this 2 DVD set. Practically non-stop action for 33 minutes, some good psychology, excellent intrigue, and some clever/original spots. Even the Hart family aftermath added to the bout. The rating may be a little kind due to some repetitive spots, but there are always going to be some inherent problems in a cage match. Owen looked like a genuine main-eventer here! Match Rating...10

TRIPLE H vs MANKIND (MICK FOLEY) (1997): This was around the time of Triple H's original push & even back then it was Foley helping him along. Very good 17 minute match that predominantly relied on a number of spots scattered throughout the bout. A little lethargic at times, and there was some questionable continuity problems. But eventually the spots ruled the day, ending in Foley's ""superfly moment"". Match Rating...8

EDGE vs KURT ANGLE (2002): This bout took place only a few weeks after their hair vs hair pay-per-view match, so Angle was complete with wig & amateur wrestling headgear here. This was actually a SmackDown television match & it actually works in its favor. The action is simply non-stop for the 15 minute (excluding commercial time) duration. A tremendous mixture of intensity & clever/original spots, this truly is an under-rated bout. Edge really took it up a notch here & gets the win with a lot of help from the Hulkster. Match Rating...9

EASTER EGG #1: On Disc-1, in the 'Chapters' menu, highlight 'Sammartino vs Zbyszko' & press 'right' twice. This shows a strange, yet fascinating, 4 minute face vs face scientific match where Zbyszko turns heel on his teacher. Later commentary provided by Vince & Bruno himself. A great egg.

EASTER EGG #2: On Disc-1, in the 'Chapters' menu, highlight 'Flair vs Garvin' & press 'right' twice. This egg shows the final 3 minutes of the World Title bout between these 2, including a nice top-rope sunset flip by Garvin to win the title.

EASTER EGG #3: On Disc-1, in the 'Extras' menu, highlight 'Muraco vs Snuka' & press 'right' twice. This shows a (Buddy) Roger's Corner interview segment with Don Muraco. It ends in a scuffle between Muraco & Snuka, when Superfly goes to the ring for his match & Muraco thinks he is taking over his television time. This truly was a great feud! Unfortunately, we don't get to see a lot of the scuffle, as most of it is censored due to Snuka bleeding.

EASTER EGG #4: On Disc-2, in the 'Extras' menu, highlight 'Bret vs Owen' & press 'right' twice. This shows Vince McMahon interviewing Owen Hart & Jim Neidhart. A handy 4 minute spot encapsulating the brother vs brother feud & why Owen hated Bret so much at the time.

DAVEYBOY'S CONCLUSION: All in all, this 2 Disc set on steel cage matches is a bit of a mixed bag. Don't get me wrong, I truly enjoyed watching it. But it just isn't worth the 5 & a bit hours of time that it takes up. The 115 minute main part of the DVD sort of stands on it's own. However, there are times when you wish that they spent more time on certain matches & didn't include others. Then when you take into account that time is used up on bouts that are shown in full elsewhere on the disc, you realize that there is quite a fair bit of unnecessary duplication.

Concerning the full matches themselves, I like the choice of matches with regards to the years chosen, but not so much with regards to the variation. I should make it very clear that only cage matches are included on this disc. There are no 'Hell In A Cell', 'Elimination Chamber' or 'War Games' bouts. I get the feeling they may get their own DVD down the track. So with the lack of variation included, it does get slightly tiresome watching cage match after cage match. Are you listening NWA-TNA...???

But I'm being a little picky, and seeing as though prices for 2 disc sets are pretty much the same as 1 discers, my criticisms may not be all that valid anyway. At the end of the day, this is very much worth a watch, and has enough fascinating clips & matches included to be more than worthwhile. And who can complain with those match ratings I have given? But in all honesty, it's not up there with the Hulk Hogan, Shawn Michaels, Rey Mysterio & Chris Benoit DVD's (remembering that I haven't seen Flair's or ECW's as yet). If I had to grade it, I would probably give it a B minus.",1114732800,7,9349,4.59748050389922
1925300,2,B0000DIJOS,"This collection is more of a documentary on the history of steel cage matches in the WWE. The documentary itself would be okay for a television viewing, but not a slightly overpriced DVD that advertises itself as something that it isn't. There were some matches that barely had any blood if any. Up and beyond that, most of these matches could almost be considered mid-card match ups as far as quality.

One that that was upsetting are that there are no WCW cage matches circa 1990 on the disc. Wargames in that era were the only place a wrestling fan could find great, bloody matches guilt free (it was rare to see blood on WCW any other times, but when you did it was well worth the wait).

I don't even feel this is worthy of a match-for-match rundown. If you find it cheap used, definitely pick it up, but I'd recommend waiting until it's in the $3.99 bin at your local pharmacy.",1112918400,3,883,4.411042944785276
1925301,5,B0000DIJOS,"First off, where are the Hell-in-the-Cell matches? Where are the Wargames? Those are some of the greatest cage matches ever and with all the footage library WWE has now it should've added at least one of the Wargames. All well.. Maybe the ""Cage Matches 2"" DVD will have it or somethin.

First off there's a 2hr documentery on the History of the cage. Mainly it's just a bunch of clips of cage matches with the coach introducing them. It's OK, but I would've like to hear more from the people involved then just 5 min of each match. Also, the Steve Austin Vs. McMahon (****) is pretty much complete so you can add that as a full match. Also some of the supposedly ""most incredible"" cage matches aren't that great. I mean Yankem/Hart? come on :-)  What about Buzz Sawyer Vs. Tommy Rich or Jim Duggan Vs. Dibiase? Anyway about the matches:

1) Bob Baclund Vs. Pat Patterson - (1979) WWWF Hwvy. Championship - Pretty cool MSG match with lots of near cage escapes. ***1/2

2) Bruno Sammartino Vs. Ivan Koloff - (1975) WWWF Hvwy - Bah! Kinda Like Hogan Vs. Volkoff: just kick, punch and throw into cage. Wished they had shown the Sammartino Vs. Zbysko match instead which is MUCH better. *1/2

3) Don Muraco Vs. Jimmy Snuka - (1983) I-C title - Not as great as everyone says, just has a good finish. Snuka/Backlund cage match was better. **

4) Bob Backlund Vs. Stan Hansen - (1981) WWWF Hwvy - Holy crap, Stan Hansen on DVD! Dont get excited, short match. **1/2

5) Tully Blanchard Vs. Magnum T.A. - (1985) U.S. title - This is a I-Quit match inside a cage featuring one of my favorite heels ever. After this match you'll be chanting: HE'S HARDCORE HE'S HARDCORE HE'S HARDCORE! *****

6) Dusty Rhodes Vs. Ric Flair (1986) NWA Hwvy - The Bash tour is winding down, Flair's getting tired. Could this be the night for Dusty? ***1/2

7) Rock N' Roll Express Vs. Arn & Ole Anderson - (1986) NWA Tag - Man! I was soooooo spoiled in the 80's with the tag-teams. Then: Rock N'Roll, Midnight Express, Arn & Tully, Bulldogs, Hart Foundation. Now: LA RESISTANCE... God I miss the NWA... *****

8) Bret Hart Vs. Owen Hart - (1994) WWF Hwvy - Owen beat his big brother cleanly at WM, so this is the rematch. An old school cage match with new school moves. Best match on the DVD. *****

9) Mankind Vs. HHH - (1997) These 2 always have great matches and so is this one. Foley unvails a new persona at the end. ****

10) Shawn Michael Vs. Marty Jannety - (1993) I-C - Raven and Gorilla Monsoon do the commentary, which is really cool! Good match from these two like always, but nothing special. ***1/2

11) Edge Vs. Angle - (2002) This is their Smackdown rematch right after Angle lost his hair to Edge. Really good match but again, ""most incredible cage match""? Nope. ****

If you can find this for about 15$, It's definitly worth it, but you should stick to the ECW-best of or the new WWE comps instead.",1104883200,2,2884,4.416981132075471
1925302,4,B0000DIJOS,"WWE Bloodbath is everything the title tells you, lots of blood in all of these matches. Though don't let that stop you if you think you can handle this. It also covers some of the greatest feuds ever shown inside a cage and comes complete with lots of bonus matches that make up for all the cut scenes of the matches on the main disk.

The first disk is hosted by The Coach and he takes us back to some of the early years back in the 70's, to recent matches in 2002. Some of the big names in wreslting are in these matches...

Disk one: Highlights of:

1] Bob Buckland vs. Pat Patterson

2] Bruno Sammartino vs. Larry Zbyszko

3] Bob Buckland vs. Jimmy Snuka

4] Jimmy Snuka vs. Don Muraco [See if you can spot Mick Foley]

5] Magnum TA vs. Tully Blanchard

6] Hulk Hogan vs. Paul Orndorff

7] Rick Flair vs. Ronnie Garvin

8] Bret Hart vs. Owen Hart [My second personal favorite]

9] Isaac Yankem vs. Bret Hart

10] HHH vs. Mankind [A very good cage match]

11] HHH vs. The Rock

12] Stone Cold Steve Austin vs. Mr. McMahon [Also where the Big Show came up through the ring floor and attacked Austin]

13] Edge and Christian vs. The Hardy Boys [Incredible jump by Jeff]

14] Kurt Angle vs. Chris Benoit [Great dives by both men]

16] Edge vs. Kurt Angle

Also comes with complete matches including:

Don Muraco vs. Jimmy Snuka: A great match that has Snuka's famous leap off the cage. Mick Foley is in the audience somewhere.

Bob Buckland vs. Stan Hanson, and more

Disk Two] Complete Matches including:

HHH vs. Mankind: This was sort of like a tribute to The Superfly by Mankind as he climbs to the cage and gives an elbow drop off the top onto HHH.

Bret Hart vs. Owen Hart: This was the best full match in my opinion. The Hart family was at ringside and the tension was unbelievable.

Then when Owen and his partner start beating up Bret after the match all the men in the Hart family start climbing the cage to try and save Bret. Lots of post match excitement.

Edge vs. Kurt Angle: Just watching the incredbile spear and angle slam off the top ropes by both men was enough for me. Kurt was wearing that wig at the time when his head was just shaved bald.

All in all, this was a good DVD. There are lots more full length matches that I didn't decide to ruin if you haven't seen them already.

The only problem was that they should have had the second half of the highlighted matches shown in their entirety, but other than that this was really great to buy.",1103587200,2,2465,4.267818574514039

Triple H vs. Mankind was a great match and it was obvioulsly bloody.  Triple H trys to use D-X to help him steal the match and I'm not gonna tell you the ending.

Edge vs. Kurt Angle was a weird choice to have on this DVD.  Edge & Angle didn't have a great match but it was interseting and defintly worth seeing.

Since Sammartino and Backlund were part of the WWWF (eventually shortened to WWF) I had never seen them wrestle until now. Even though Jimmy ""Superfly"" Snuka is shown here from the WWF, he was in the NWA/Mid Atlantic Championship wrestling area sometime in the early 80's, winning the NWA World Tag Team belts with Ray Stevens. In fact, there was a spectacular tag team cage match between Snuka/Stevens and Steamboat/Youngblood, circa 1980 (not on this dvd).

I didn't care much for anything post 1995 on these 2 dvd's.

Note: There are a couple of hidden dvd features.

It finally comes in the form of an all cage match dvd. Now, for someone like me, who just wants that match, the absolute boredom that comes from watching the first disc feature, the rather high price, and some unworthy matches are absolutely worth it. This DVD is not pure crap, uh uh. Just some of the matches and my ratings for each.
Bruno Samartino vs. Ivan Koloff:
A very good match that is fun to watch if just to see how the match form has changed. 4/5
Jimmy Snuka vs. Don Muraco:
Legendary match that is not only historically significant, but fun to watch also: 5/5
Magnum TA vs. Tully Blanchard, I Quit:
Definately the second best match on the disc. An absolute masterpiece: 5/5
Ric Flair vs. Dusty Rhodes:
Possibly the best match in the historic fued between two of the greatest ever: 5/5
Bret Hart vs. Owen Hart:
Never has a cage match expressed such emotion, such athletisism, such pure wrestling. Countless thrilling spots, many near finishes, and two of the greatest wrestlers of the 90s make what is, in my opinion, the greatest cage match ever: 5/5
Marty Jannetty vs. Shawn Michaels:
An odd choice for this DVD, while this match is very good, it is not nearly as good as the classics they had at that years Royal Rumble or the one on Raw: 4/5
Hunter Hearst Helmsely vs. Mankind:
Fantastic match from one of the greatest ppvs in WWE histoy, Summerslam 97: 5/5
Edge vs. Kurt Angle:
Apply what i said for Jannetty vs. Michaels here: 3.5/5",1081382400,3,1574,4.449826989619377
1925316,3,B0000DIJOS,"Of ALL of the cage matches that have taken place over the last 2-3 decades in pro wrestling, the WWE picks some of the WORST ones to showcase the most incredible. Let's set the record straight shall we:
#1(This should NOT have been a 2 disc set. ONE disc is all that was needed. Big mistake.
#2(No one wants ONE DVD with clipped matches.)
#3(This DVD omits some of the finest cage matches ever seen, either on WWE/WCW PPV, RAW, Smackdown!, or Nitro.)
#4 I would have sectioned the DVD off like this:
Steel Cage(matches from WWE/WCW PPVs, RAW, Smackdown!, and Nitro)
Hell In A Cell(the greatest HIAC matches ever, and it's only a select few of them to begin with)
War Games(it's only 3 or 4 of them I would include)
Overall, the WWE REALLY half-assed this DVD. The ONLY matches on this DVD that are notable and worth the time is Magnum TA vs. Tully Blanchard, Bret Hart vs. Owen Hart, Arn/Ole Anderson vs. The Rock & Roll Express, and Kurt Angle vs. Edge.

The Tully-Magnum I Quit match from Starrcade 85- been there done that 100's of times, same with Rhodes-Flair, Andersons-Express. The Mankind-Triple H who cares!! Edge-Angle who cares was on TV two years ago. Michaels-Jannetty can the crowd get any more boring. Alot of this stuff is avalible on pay per view tapes at your local video store.

1925319,4,B0000DIJOS,"I really enjoyed this set, even if it does have a number of issues.
Most of the matches across these two discs are edited and edited bad.  So much so that they are more highlight reels than matches.  I'm not sure why this was done, as with two discs they could have certainly fit a lot more complete matches in, but they did not.  Especially disappointing was the very, very brief clip shots of the Bruno Sammartino VS Larry Zybysko cage match, as many younger fans could have gotten to see the legendary Bruno in action.
Why do I still give this boxed set 4 out of 5 stars, you ask?  Because what you DO get to see is utterly awesome stuff.
Superfly Jimmy Snuka's two cage matches are the stuff of legend.  In this set there is one cage match with Snuka challenging WWWF Champion Bob Backlund, and another one where he takes on WWF Intercontiential Champion Don Muraco.  Both of these are just beyond praise...they are artwork.  How a cage match should be done.
Other really good stuff on here too includes a great one between Mick Foley (as Mankind) VS Triple H.  This match is not included on any of the other Foley videos and is very well done.  The camera shot on the brutal cage door slam on Foley's head lets you know just how hard it hit him.
You also get to see Bret Hart VS the late Owen Hart in a war of brothers that are also two of the hardest working in ring performers ever.
I'd like to see WWE use more of this immense video library they have now in this fashion, but include more COMPLETE matches in them.
