8285781,1,B001C3W1BA,"Nobody shines in this flick. Supposedly Laura Antonelli means something, well, all movie has 18th century feel with 20th century scenery, but main problem the movie is supposedly about sex which done with kids under 6 years old in mind. After director mix up unmixable substances the result is I wasted 25 bucks and cannot ask for money back. Avoid.
The box back states the dvd has strong sex and nudity--gee, that's a lie. From nudity we see tits couple times and sex is shown once--between horses. And lousy music add to disappointment.",1346803200,7,538,4.795698924731183
