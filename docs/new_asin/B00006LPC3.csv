1784895,5,B00006LPC3,This movie stars Treach from Naughty By Nature fame as a hit man that is the best there is. The movie tells of his father killing his mother then himself so he is no stranger to violence. This brings him into contact with a white mob type guy who brings him in and teaches him the ropes along with others like him- but he is the best there is. Then the boss hires him to kill his girlfriend  but is told if he hears from him by a certain time then to spare her. But when he does so anyway  all hell breaks loose in one of the funniest fights sequences I've  seen in a long time. There is also a love interest with a Goverment agent and what most people seem to be talking about--Treach's full frontal nude scene that highlight this movie. Violent but funny. The best part is the cooking cornbread while having to go out and do a hit while trying to contact the meat/pick up guys. Very funny.,1038614400,,891,4.138728323699422
1784896,1,B00006LPC3,"I now feel dumber after watching this movie, the only reason i give it even one star is because you have to, and maybe because the music was good. the acting in this movie is terrible, most of the movie is just them trying to do ... stunts & swearing a lot. i wanted to see this movie so bad, i thought this would be the type of movie i like, i have liked all the other types like this, i saw the ads in the source, i read stuff about the movie & i couldn't wait to see it, now i wish i hadnt of wasted 87 minutes of my time to watch .... treach... great rapper, wasn't too bad of an actor, wasn't the worst part of the movie, the one thing i couldn't stand was how corny it was. treach's (bishop) boss in the movie was a corny-... white man who wanted to be like martin luther king. this kind of ... should not even be put out on shelves. when i rented it i had a choice between this one or the other movie i wanted to see, Undisputed, i still haven't seen that and i wish i would've rented that instead, if you want my opinion, do not waste your time, its not worth it, this movie is a bunch of ... that is put out just to kill braincells. the one good thing about the movie was that the music in it was great, if your a naughty by nature fan, a lil jon fan, or just a rap fan in general i would suggest (trying to find) the soundtrack. it had great music, but don't waste your time with the movie.",1038441600,,1400,3.8645833333333335

1784904,4,B00006LPC3,"I hadn't seen this movie in years, but when Amazon recommended it to me, I remembered that it had a good amount of Gun Play, Blood, and Gratuitous Violence. The recipe for a Great Action Movie.
When I received it, watched it, I was not disappointed.

If you like hardcore action; Get This Movie.
I even watched it with my girlfriend, so she could see the scene where Trech, the star Hangs Dong for the world to see.
She loved it",1417564800,,428,4.283950617283951

1784913,3,B00006LPC3,I think this movie is a gangsta/love story. It shows how a person can be heartless and have a heart at the same time.,1315353600,,117,3.9166666666666665

1784916,5,B00006LPC3,This was one of the most funny and action filled movies that I had seen in a long time. I love the dialogue amongst the actors with the narration in the backdrop. Most of the profanity was funny but the movie could have been just as entertaining without as much cursing.,1185408000,,270,4.313725490196078
1784925,4,B00006LPC3,"A noteworthy entry into the 'action-comedy' genre, of which there are few laudable examples.  Though not one of the best, this movie, which at times includes some of the best, is fun enough to enjoy.

More comedy than action, and a genuine twist near the end of the movie.  An excellent way to spend an afternoon.",1182124800,,313,4.553571428571429
1784926,5,B00006LPC3,"I thought this action-packed film was quite good.  I've read quite a few reviews on this film over the years and I'm still not understanding all of the over-analyses over whether the script is racist in its treatment of African-Americans as killers.  I've never been a fan of what used to be called ""blaxploitation"" movies. I came of age during the initial release of such films as ""Super Fly"", ""Foxy Brown"", and ""Sweet Sweetback's Badaass Song"".  I missed them all and haven't seen too many of their contemporary counterparts and I don't think that I am any better or any worse for the experience (although I strongly believe that ""blaxploitation"" was then, and is now, a misnomer).  However, when I accidently came across this movie on cable late one night, I was hooked!!  I always thought Treach was sexy, but he laid it down in this flick!  His portrayal of Malik Bishop, a hit man with a heart, is rivoting.  What some people refer to what they call stilted acting by all the actors, I found it to be merely tongue-in-cheek camp satire.  Although violent at times, none of the scenes are gratuitous or out-of-context.  After all, the film IS about a contract killer with a conscience who is looking for the love of a good woman.  So what if she's at the ""executive level of execution"" while he's still a ""murderous mailboy""?  She handles an assault weapon in her 4"" Manolo Blahniks while carrying a back-up rocket launcher tucked away in the zippered compartment of her Birkin bag.  Her hits exhibit much better strategic planning than those of her ""future baby daddy"".  But don't most females take the lead in traditionally male-dominated positions?  Isn't it the same in ""Mr. & Mrs. Smith""?  With the exception of the races of the killer couples, weren't the story lines similar?  Yet, no one had anything fundamentally negative to say about the ""Brangelina"" film.  Both contain bullets, big guns, buffed bods, and big lips.  However, one film is a hit while the other goes straight to video.  If you watch this film while keeping in mind that nothing in it is meant to be serious, then you will find  ""Love and a Bullet"" to be a film rich in satirical black comedy (and I'm referring to the literary genre, not race).  The film only fails with some of the principle characters.  Kent Masters King was horribly miscast as a kept woman.  She is just not sexy enough in this role to be believable as the potential victim of a jealous rich lover.  Even her clothes were frumpy.  Kelly McGillis was hotter as an Amish woman in ""Witness""!!  Why waste a hit man of Bishop's caliber on this woman when Shug Knight is out of a job right now?  Now let's talk about what's really going on - the MALE NUDITY, albeit brief.  Wow, it is refreshing to see a man ""drop trou"" for a change - and Treach IS the man for full-frontal nudity.  Is that your gun, Mr. Treach or are you just happy to see EVERYONE?!?  I burned my DVD player up, rewinding and freeze-framing his ripped abs and everything ""South of the Border"".  Yeah, I'm down for ""O.P.P.""!  You know me!!",1164326400,2,3055,4.589648798521257
1784927,3,B00006LPC3,"No complaints here, save for the fight scene with the martial arts hitman...I'd say about 90% of the action footage is directly taken from Jackie Chan's ""Legend Of Drunken Master"".",1131840000,,180,5.033333333333333
1784928,4,B00006LPC3,"You really don't expect much
from movies where rappers receive
top billing, but this movie
manages to stand apart from the genre.
Not only is this a fantastic action film,
but it also successfully combines
elements of comedy, social satire,
and blatant stereotype.
The absolute best thing about this movie
is the script. Eloquent, funny, intelligent,
and full of surprises.

Since I'm a person with an overactive mind
and short attention span, I'm always quick
to note which movies are able to maintain my
interest throughout the entire film. This film
does that and never disappoints.

I highly recommend this movie for purchase or rental.

Above all, I'm glad at least ONE rapper has turned out
to be a good actor.",1108339200,5,716,4.900826446280992
1784929,3,B00006LPC3,"This movie was good. Worth watching. Worth buying. Decent acting and actors. The plot a little far fetched but still good.
Ladies definite plus was the FULL FRONTAL nude, strip scene with Treach. Too bad is wasn't longer and closer. The scene that is!!",1086912000,5,252,4.75
1784930,5,B00006LPC3,"Ramsy and Kantz have soaked up movie influences that obviously go back decades. But it is to Tarantino's generation,(my generation) that these funny and energetic moviemakers belong.
 Its not just ""influence"" that you see, but out and out theft. From ""Reservoir Dogs"", opening ally walk, to ""Goodfellas"" cooking, gun selling, helocoptor watching sequence, these guys are caught red handed. but it works. It all hits as refreshing and some what new, although clearly falling into the Q.T. world.
  You should also marvel at the fact that these guys made the whole thing for about 300,000. With that minimal budget, and (according to them) hurried shooting schedules, they have created a movie far superior to so many other boring action films. Compare this film to ""Gone in Sixty Seconds, or BadBoys I&II, and you should be impressed.
  As far as the acting goes, it's very good for an inexperienced (mostly) cast. I think Treach(the rapper) could have a real future in action films, he carries this one well with an almost constant running narrative, which is engaging and funny. Plus ladies he's willing to do full frontal. The scene chewing thief in this film however is Sam Scabber, as the ""disgruntled, older, face like a fist) hitman. His performance will leave you wanting to see more of him.
  All in all a fun action flick. Enjoy",1080864000,2,1337,4.915555555555556
1784931,4,B00006LPC3,"What looks like another run of the mill rapper driven action flick, turns out to be a solid film, with some thought provoking dialogue and above average action sequences. The movie rolls on at a relatively deliberate pace in the beginning with a narrative telling a significant part of the back story.
Narratives in movies can really be hit or miss depending on the nature that they are told and their substance and relationship to the plot. With this film running just a hair over 80 minutes, the narrative enhances plot points and also serves as a background informational case study on characters introduced in the movie. The narrative never really interferes with the pace movie, and doesn't detract from any of the action sequences.
The action in this movie is primarily gunplay; however, Malik's character is adept in martial arts and has a particularly intense battle with one of the thugs towards the end of the film. Andre ""Chyna"" McCoy did some of the action stunt sequences and as usual his moves were fluid and concentrated.
The movie's tone is decisively urban with several of the jokes and innuendo being directed specifically towards a young black male audience. Most of the lead actors and actresses are black with the main crime boss being white. This leads to further racial stereotyping. What makes this movie palatable for a typical white guy to watch is the two simple facts that there are copious amounts of humor thrown in and the story is rather entertaining.
To add spice to the story Malik's character is a hit man with second thoughts about his final job. As his boss has asked him to either kill his (the bosses) girlfriend or wait for his call and leave her alive. He soon realizes that he has to make a choice, as he has feelings for this girl. Also Malik befriends a government agent, who is working the case, to bring down the antagonist, and she provides some interesting sub-plot matter.
The acting in this movie is one aspect which was a bit wooden. It seems like the facial expressions and the emotions which this movie was trying to portray were not fully executed. This is only a minor gripe, as most of the actors in this movie including Treach have limited experience.
Overall this is a very good film with a surprise twist at the end. The camera work and lighting is appropriate depending on the specific scene. There is no nudity in this film, which is refreshing, in the sense that flesh doesn't have to sell the story. Without nudity there is no wasted time, and the flow of the story maintains an even, somewhat relaxed pace. It is obvious that director Kantz and Ben Ramsey are ready to handle movies with larger budgets and more polished actors.",1074988800,3,2692,4.693446088794926
1784932,4,B00006LPC3,"A HITMAN [TREACH] FALLS FOR HIS NEXT TARGET. THIS ACTION/COMEDY IS FUNNY AND ACTION PACKED. TREACH, WHO'S THE LEAD MC FOR NAUGHTY BY NATURE, DOES OK IN THIS MOVIE.

1784933,4,B00006LPC3,"LOVE AND A BULLET poked fun at the somewhat structure of syndicate life by using Malik Bishop, played by Treach, as a hitman who succeeds from street killer to mafia life after being recruited by a kingpin who uses him to eliminated those who stand in the way of high-powered associates.  This film was action-packed and also held a dose of humor at what life is like with ""the family"" and who get promoted to side of the big man.  Another plus was Malik's commentaries and how he found amazement in what some people will kill for.  There were some unexpected moves within the movie, which added to the conflict, and the romance with the beautiful and dangerous Hylene added dimension.  The end battle with the syndicate over an act of conscience was almost like watching a video game, it was so over the top, but then, so was this movie.  Treach's moody, bad brother character whose received a change of heart was a welcome sight to what could have been a one-dimensional character, and made what could have been a one-dimensional movie into a film that was more than the sum of it's parts.",1047600000,2,1091,4.574358974358974
