8686379,5,B00P4L4M8G,"This Dvd was given to my husband while we were walking out of adoration at our parish one day a month ago. It is awesome. Tim Francis has so much charisma and is a great speaker too! Learning about these miracles and the stigmata make you feel so on fire about your faith. Great for lukewarm Catholics! The website loveandmercy.org has other great resources from the messages to Catalina from Jesus that I highly recommend. Especially the writings on the Holy Mass. Life-changing. Buy it, you won't regret it!! Then share it with others!!!",1441584000,3,539,4.74468085106383
