2379319,5,B000A7S1TU,"Self-teaching is not for the feint-of-heart! DVDs tend to be too much, too little, too advanced, or too elementary. David Hamburger takes you through it all like he's there with you. And, once you coordinate the lessons to your pause button so that you take time to practice what he gives you - you actually learn to play a guitar! Nice job all around!",1392681600,,352,4.515625

2379321,5,B000A7S1TU,"David Hamburger has an excellent, logical curriculum that makes learning each new skill or chord easy and fun. The DVD format means that lessons of whatever size the learner chooses are available and properly sequenced, and the learner may print out for repertoire and practice on their own. If the learner will do each lesson methodically and in order, moving on when each skill or chord is fairly well ""under their fingers,"" they will be able to play in many styles and continue, ready to read common tablature and chords and play music with others. In the second DVD, finger picking becomes easy and clear with a two-screen view so the learner can see both the fretboard and strings. For the price of a lesson or two, this DVD provides several months of lessons using correct techniques and interesting",1389571200,,805,4.798561151079137
2379322,5,B000A7S1TU,David is really great at explaining and getting you on your way to playing guitar. I've NEVER PLAYED guitar in my life - only dreamed of picking one up and making it sound great... that is going to happen thanks to this dvd. Very good and very basic for total beginners. Try this if you want to learn from scratch how to play guitar!,1379376000,,333,4.21875
2379323,5,B000A7S1TU,"As a self taught guitar student, I've tried several printed methods with varying success.  Mel Bay is a great set of books, though the play along CD often moves too fast for a student to use as a duet tutor.  Alfred's cds play slower and I'm able to mostly play along, though the depth of instruction isnt't quite there.
  ""The Acoustic Guitar Method"", DVD, teaches at a much slower pace and is clearly geared towards students without formal teachers.  Mr. Hamburger presents slowly and with good background information.  Now I've got some instruction written specifically for the self taught.
  The instruction uses only folk and roots music, so once again, by itself this product lacks variety.  The instruction seems to focus on chords and accompaniment.  Used along with a traditonal method book that presents scales and theory, I'm very pleased with this purchase and would recommend it as a very accessible supplement.",1375056000,,924,5.019736842105263

My plan is to work up a couple cords then stop practice a few days then watch it over again.  So far it is working!,1364947200,,255,3.8653846153846154
2379327,5,B000A7S1TU,"This 2 DVD set is another great lesson from Homespun Tapes focusing on an absolute beginner or near beginner. DVD 1 starts out by teaching some basic chords and strumming techniques.  DVD 2 also teaches some basic fingerpicking patterns, how to play melodies, and hammer on, slide and pull off embellishments.  Simple folk tunes are used to illustrate all of the material.  The instructor does a very nice job of teaching the material in a very simple and easy-to-follow manner. Even though I consider myself an intermediate player, when I perform, I sing lead vocal and play rhythym guitar, which results in my doing basic strumming throughout most songs while a band member plays lead guitar.  Although a portion of DVD 1 was beneath my level (ie. explanation of chords), I still found the portions of the lesson focusing on strumming patterns, fingerpicking, melodies, slides, pull offs and hammer ons to be informative and helpful.  That being said, I would not recommend this lesson to an intermediate player who is fluent in these areas because they will find the lesson to be too simple.  Anyone who is an absolute beginner or near beginner should find these DVDs to be very helpful.",1363910400,,1190,4.895522388059701

2379330,5,B000A7S1TU,I purchased this along with other materials since receiving a guitar as a birthday present some months ago.  This is the most valuable teaching tool I have yet to purchase.

2379332,5,B000A7S1TU,"Acoustic Guitar Method DVD is super easy to follow along with and David Hamburger's presentation is unpretentious. He is not about impressing you with his ability or how many music terms he can lay on you or blowing you away with lightning fast riffs. He is truly focused on a ""building-block"" approach; laying a good foundation and then allowing the student to advance at your pace. DVD is well done, high quality and easily advances and resets as necessary to allow a quick review of fingering and technique. So far, so good! All you need to do as a ""wanna-be"" guitar player is commit to practice.",1349827200,,599,4.660377358490566
2379333,5,B000A7S1TU,"I was surprised that it covered folk music, though once I started looking for videos of other people playing those songs and saw the wide interpretations and variations out there, I quite appreciated this being a starting point for my education. Straight off the bat I feel comfortable changing lyrics, making me feel more creative, and he even encourages changing cords up. Sometimes I get a little strict about things, this is a nice relaxed approach and I'm loving it. I've started the dvd a couple of weeks ago and am only about halfway through the first video and I have enough practice material to last a couple of weeks without watching further yet. I like that it will take me time to get through this, it makes the cost even more worthwhile. If you like deadpan dry wit, he'll entertain you while you learn. Reading other reviews I see that some methods don't show how to play songs while you learn, so I appreciate this even more.

From an absolute beginner's standpoint, this is a great video.",1348876800,,1004,4.640449438202247
2379334,5,B000A7S1TU,"I've tried a few training videos for beginners and this is by far that most useful for my purposes.  Normally, I'd be critical of casual conversation in such a thing, but Hamburger's personal style is really perfect for his teaching method.  I knew all of the chords that are taught in these 2 disks, beforehand, but going through the lessons has been a huge benefit to my playing technique and the songs are perfectly chosen to motivate the student.  I'm sure I'm not the first person to suggest this, but I wish Hamburger would put together a Volume 2 of the ""Acoustic Guitar Method.""",1327881600,,586,4.615384615384615

2379336,5,B000A7S1TU,I've been teaching myself to play guitar and this is the perfect companion. I would definitely suggest this to anyone learning to play.,1292457600,,135,4.913043478260869
2379337,5,B000A7S1TU,"This instructional DVD program is much more practical and helpful than others I've seen for acoustic folk guitar beginners who've had little or no formal instruction.  David's approach is very casual but informative.  He doesn't include a lot of music theory, but rather focuses on real ""hands on"" (literally) visual instruction with a lot of examples of traditional folk tunes.  (Those whose musical interests lie elsewhere might not find it as interesting or useful.)  I would definitely recommend it for any beginners who are interested in this category.",1287964800,,557,5.295454545454546
2379338,5,B000A7S1TU,"This is one of the best courses for guitar.
I use it together with David Hamburger's book ""The Acoustic Guitar Method (complete edition"") that comes with three CD's, and covers about the same territory but can serve as a great printed supplement and exercise tool.

Hamburger presents a great selection of songs, mostly Western & Country. As is the nature of these songs, some are dealing with heart break of lost love (""Bury me beneath the willow""), death of mother (""Will the circle be unbroken"") and murder of a loving father (""Stagolee""). Therefore, I will not give this excellent learning tool as a present to my 10-year old godson who is learning the guitar.  (A country singer here recently told the audience that after he had sung the murder song Stagolee, a teenage girl came up to him and said: ""Please, please, never sing this song again!"")
For the more sensitive guitar students, I recommend: ""Will Schmid & Greg Koch: Guitar Method Books 1-3 (Hal Leonard).

It's a great introduction to the acoustic guitar language.",1284336000,,311,5.0
2379340,5,B000A7S1TU,"The following is essentially the same as what I wrote in my review of book/CD version of this course. I love them both!

David Hamburger has put together a wonderful beginning course for those that want to learn to play the acoustic guitar. I have the book and the DVD set. Each, on their own, is a VERY good resource. Together they are fantastic. Everything positive that is said about this course in the other reviews is absolutely true. Whether you read the book or watch the video, Hamburger comes off as someone who has thought about the best way to communicate to a new learner. The extras on essential listening and other information just make this superb instructional material that much better.

If you are thinking about buying this material don't hesitate. Get it today. You'll be glad that you did.",1262217600,,810,4.697183098591549
2379341,5,B000A7S1TU,"this is a very comprehensive and beneficial source for beginners interested in folk,country and blues rhytms...",1239494400,,111,6.0
2379342,4,B000A7S1TU,"I have bought a lot of guitar learning books and a few DVDs. I feel I am beginning to be an expert, not with guitar, for "" learning beginner guitar"". For intro to learning, if you don't have a teacher, this DVD is great. A DVD is much more valuable than a book I think because guitar is really about hand movement. A book has pictures of how  a chord should look... DVD you see David making the changes, and giving you some practice tips on learning new chords. David has a great laid back attitude as well. Learning guitar at first is really about chord changes and getting them down, and repeating them over and over until your have them in your muscle memory. Not the most fun at first but will payoff later. I saw the one bad review that some reviewer gave saying he only gets to the ""F chord"". I don't know what he meant by this, was expecting to cover barre chords? Well David covers most of the open chords. Barre chords you can move into after you have the open chords down.
The one challenging thing with the songs on this DVD is that they are very fast. Some upto like 200 bpm! For a beginner this is very difficult. He didn't really explain well that you should use a metronome, and start slow, and then build up to this(or close to this) I decided to try and get to around 160 bpm which is still fast, and the songs sound decent. So that's the reason I am taking the 1 star away. It would have gotten the 5 stars if there was some more tips on practicing. Most all books and DVDs I have seen don't have anything on how to practice properly, and how to tackle certain problems.

Just a few other comments. I like this DVD  better than:
Fender Presents: Getting Started on Acoustic Guitar
The Fender DVD is good, but it covers a LOT of topics(barre chords,scales, power chords, theory) quickly.  It's a good DVD, but I think tries to cover too much.

A good intro book to complement this DVD is:
Guitar Basics: Essential Chords, Scales, Rhythms and Theory by Buckingham
This book+CD is very thin, not a lot of blah,blah, but starts off with chords and strumming patterns. You'll just have to practice,practice,practice. Some of the chords are quite hard and I do sort of skip them(Gmin anyone?)
Both don't focus much on music theory,reading music, learning note names,where they are on the fret... but to me you can learn that matter with scales, and later on.
For reading music,notes, frets and notes you can get: Hal Leonard Guitar Method....
Hal Leonard is good, but doesn't focus as much on chords, and strumming. It covers them, but is not it's main focus IMHO.

Lastly the Acoustic Guitar method DVD is great to start practing singing and playing. Not an easy feat I have found.

In summary get this DVD!",1233273600,,2720,4.417165668662674

The instructor is funny at times, as opposed to other instructors that are too serious and tended to be boring.  This is the one guitar dvd I would recommend if you're just beginning, because it kept me practicing to learn more songs.  He teaches you the chords as an introductory of playing a song and the songs get tougher as you progress.  The songs range from bluegrass to country.  I also have an electric guitar as well as an acoustic guitar, and would like to learn to play music other than country and blue grass, although I doubt the songs I really want to play are available for lessons, but this dvd is a great start to the right direction of learning them later on your own.",1212278400,,860,4.3105590062111805

I don't have a lot of time for guitar lessons, so I need to have materials handy for when I have time to learn.  David Hamburger is a great acoustic guitar instructor.  The DVD starts from the beginning learning basic open chords, which was a bit too basic for me, but each lesson intoduces a different strumming pattern and folk song to play using the newly learned chords and strumming pattern.  Petty soon, you know all of these cool acoustic folk songs.  I'm only half way through the 2 DVD set and my acoustic palying has become more fun to play and interesting to listen to.

2379353,5,B000A7S1TU,"This two disc set is like a complete 6 month course in guitar.  For the price of, perhaps, a single lesson, you get what amounts to 6 months of lessons from a low-key, funny, and talented teacher.

The first disc is useful for those just starting out.  If you do not know how to play chords, learn a chord, turn off the DVD (even after only 15 minutes) and practice.  In a few days of practicing, turn the DVD back on and go for 'lesson 2"", or the next chord.

If you are, like me, someone who has been playing for awhile and is self-taught, take the entire course.  Do not skip much in disc 1 even though disc 2 is more appealing.  Get the basic strums, bass patterns, etc.  Find out, like me, if you have ""holes"" in your guitar education and fill them.  In other words, use this wonderful 2 DVD set to build a solid foundation, and then, after mastering Disc 2, move on to other Homespun DVD's, expanding your education, while learning to play songs.

This is what most excites me:  I get to firm up my foundation, learn techniques, but also learn songs as I go along.  After all, it is the songs that we enjoy playing the most.

My knowledge of a few basic cords did give me a bit of a leg up; nevertheless I decided to follow every step of his curriculum so as not to miss anything, and sure enough I usually found at a minimum something new to me or a better way of doing something, like a different way of holding down ""G"", or subtle hints about holding the pick.

Even if it cost a little more adding a file it would be well worth the extra money.",1483747200,,475,3.6116504854368934

He speaks too softly, and in a monotone. I actually fell asleep watching this DVD. I checked it out of the library. It's going back. I'm sorry, but I need to stay awake to learn something.",1482192000,,326,4.5423728813559325
8076025,5,B000A7S1TU,This is a great learning DVD.  David is a great teacher an this DVD is. Easy to follow an see where he places his fingers  The picking style alone is just great for first timers like myself.  With all the choices out there this one is foolproof.,1477872000,,245,4.170212765957447

Within 15 minutes of hanging it on the refrigerator the magnet came unglued, it crashed to the floor, and the divider fell out...and the cheap pen doesn't work. I didn't want to give it any stars but Amazon requires at least 1 in order to post the review.",1460246400,,278,4.264150943396227

8076030,5,B000A7S1TU,"This beginners course on acoustic guitar has some good information and sound advice.  The instruction early on about properly fingering chords and encouragement to not get frustrated is good because I think this is exactly where a lot of beginners give up too soon (those 'one word' reviewers here have probably already given up).

Some people may find this instructor's seemingly deadpan style a bit alienating - in actuality, he's got a dry, kind of snarky sense of humor that makes me pay attention to what he says, and I've been having a few good laughs as I learn. If you do a search for  David Hamburger on the web, you can find some video clips from this course to get an idea of his teaching
style.

It's important to note that the course focuses on American ""roots"" music (blues, folk and some country), so if you are looking to learn acoustic guitar with contemporary or pop material, this would not be for you.

If you are ok with the content and the instructor,  this course provides a good foundation to learning acoustic guitar.",1449446400,,1042,4.635869565217392
