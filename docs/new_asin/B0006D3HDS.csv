2181927,5,B0006D3HDS,"I've never water surfed in my life---and probably never will.  My soul mate virtually compelled me to see this film.  I reluctantly thought that I would have to suffer through Riding Giants.  Fortunately, nothing could have been further from the truth.  This is one of the greatest documentaries I've ever seen of any genre whatsoever.  Director Stanley Peralta has put together a masterpiece.  He introduces us to surfers who popularized this form of athletic perfection unknown to most Americans previous to the early 1960s.  These free spirits pursued this activity as some sort of existential quest demanding the similar dedication of a monk or the proverbial starving artist.  Living one step ahead of poverty was the reality of superstars like Chuck Noll.  Real fame and financial remuneration didn't occur until the juvenile surfer movies (remember Annette Funicello and Sandra Dee?) started to appear.

Peralta interviews such modern day heroes as Laird John Hamilton and Dave Kalama.  It is fascinating to hear them discuss their passion.  Death is their constant companion.  At the same time they love life, and are not even minimally nihilistic. We may not wish to imitate them, but this doesn't prevent us from admiring their courage and near obsession with riding waves that can betray them at a moment's notice.  A few women have even joined their ranks.  Riding Giants is most certainly a dvd that you will wish to add to your collection.  I strongly believe that it should also be nominated for an Academy Award.  Documentaries don't get much better than this.",1101427200,3,1576,5.070038910505836
2181928,5,B0006D3HDS,The best surf movie I have ever seen; it was premiered at Cork Film Festival in October. Being in the cinema was almost as good as being in perfect surf.

2181959,5,B0006D3HDS,"Great Movie!  Much Cal pride for Mavericks.  And by-the-way,  no one mentioned that Jeff Clark is the only surfer (I've ever seen) who takes off facing the wave, going left or right on HUGE SURF! I guess that makes him  ambi-dexterous, ambi-balanced, or omni-directional?""  I began surfing when I was 12, in 1963. I didn't stop till i was 42.  And only because of having to relocate away from the beach.  But lately I am feeling determined to get back to Seal Beach River Jetty and ""hang five or ten"" if it's the last thing I do!  I loved surfing as much as i loved sex!  Of course that's only because I could surf waves for 3 or 4 hours.  I could only surf body for 1 hour......would you believe 45 minutes? would you believe 45 seconds? Anyone going to the coast?  I got gas money!",1460073600,,783,4.294520547945205

2182000,5,B0006D3HDS,"Best surfing movie ever. Goes back in time to the earliest days of big wave riding in Hawaii and how over the years surfing has changed through sheer nerves of steel, and tow-surfing is awesome. It presents many great surfers like Mickey Munoz, Mark Fu and his tragic accident at Mavericks, the awesome pioneer of Wiamea Bay surfing, Greg Knoll. Then came along Laird Hamilton who could be the best surfer in the world. He invented the surfboard fin foil which allows surfers to get longer and faster rides. I highly recommend this movie, but it may not be for you surfing purists out there who believe that surfing technology has separated the surfer to far from the experience with tow surfing and the fin foil. I love it all. Surfers first. This movie is great. I watch it occasionally because it is always so much fun.",1434240000,,822,4.598639455782313

2182088,3,B0006D3HDS,"Riding Giants is a surfing documentary. A ""Big Wave"" surfing documentary that is. Aside for the language it is rated PG-13 for inappropriate language (and the language is not infrequent) it is a good watch.

I enjoyed the archival videos they put in the movie, and the spectacular scenery and majesty of the ocean. You think small wave surfin' is something? You haven't seen anything yet! I was astounded at the size of the waves and the different techniques that are used of necessity -and the utter dangerousness of surfing in the manner -- all of which is covered well in Riding Giants.

This is a documentary, so while it is a little dry in some parts it is still largely interesting. I do recommend this film (with a bleeper, of course).",1413331200,,742,4.613636363636363

Rickey Grigg and Mickey Munoz were acquaintences in Santa Monica with whom our family knew through the Santa Monica school system. They were excellent surfers then. My brother and I were just amateurs who enjoyed playing in the surf for a few relaxing hours.

  One segment missing from this documentary is Velzy balsa boards replacing the heavy paddle boards as the first innovation leading to the foam boards developed by Greg Knoll.

It is entertaining and educational and fills a void in a part of our history of a group that wasn't excepted until decades later. Surfing today is a recreation, but in Hawaii, in the 50's it was a lifestyle. The movie does a great job of showing how the sport has changed along with the waves.

I used to read about these surfers in Surfer magazine and yes, they became legends.  The footage of Greg Noll in particular is just fascinating, and then to see him interviewed for his recollections for this film was just great. This is without question in my opinion the finest big wave surfing film ever made, and one of the greatest surfing films of any kind.

This film has wonderfully evocative vintage footage of California surfing before it became huge, and untouched California coastline that today has vanished. The scenes from Hawaii are just stunning and there are other, unheard-of places many surfers will see for the first time.

I really liked when the director says he doesn't want to be pidgeon-holed as just a documentary film maker or only a sports film maker so he was trying to find that balance of making a sports film/documentary/good story that everyone could watch. I felt he did just that. This film covers multiple genre's.
Extras:
Making of, Blue carpet movie premiere, deleted scenes, 2 commentaries and a little more made for good special features. The deleted scenes when they ask the old school surfers to talk surfer lingo was pretty funny.
I picked it up on Bluray for the reason that these movies have good soundtracks and the ocean/surfing would look amazing.

The camera shots are amazing, the commentary is enthusiastic, the comparison between Hawaii and California is interesting (Maverick's debuts as a fierce surf-killing wave), and of course the surfing is phenomenal. But the one thing that draws me to this movie over and over is Greg Noll. He is a man that you wish you could sit and drink a beer (or 2 or 3...)with. I am in love with his memories and how he tells a story. His story telling, his enthusiasm is what brings about the lore, the tradition, the respect and the enchantment of surfing to life.

I am ashamed that I have seen this movie dozens and dozens of time (and that was in the theater!) and I am just now buying it, but I have netflixed this movie a so many times, I should have just kept it, copied it, paid for it...

2182213,5,B0006D3HDS,"The focus is on the three people who have had the biggest impact on big wave surfing.  It explores the heroism, along with the fears and failures, that come with tackling something really huge and formidable.  The director does an impressive job getting people to tell their story in a very personal way.  The result is a series of stories about multi-faceted people rather than two-dimensional stereotypes.  The movie includes historical photos, cool drawings, great music, and a few stories you can relate to if you've done any surfing.  These guys have done things most of us will never get a chance to do, but so many of the stories told ring true and can be generalized to our collective human experience.

If you watch the special feature about The Making of Riding Giants, it gives an idea of how this came about organically through an interview for another project.

2182220,5,B0006D3HDS,"With the success of Stacy Peralta's (famous skater and one of the original Dogtown Z-Boys) award-winning documentary ""Dogtown and Z-Boys"" in 2001, surfer/skater turned filmmaker Stacy Peralta went on to work on his next documentary in 2004 titled ""Riding Giants"".

For this documentary, Peralta's goal was to focus on the origins of surfing and big wave riding.

""Riding Giants"" would feature plenty of classic home movie footage of surfers from Hawaii and the West Coast to show the culture and what happened when the surfers from California (who fell in love with a photo of three surfers riding 30+ foot high waves) went to Hawaii and discover the waves for themselves.

From the surfing innovators of the 1940's to the early 1950's when the lightweight longboard was created and paved a way for more people to take on the sport.  Featuring big wave surfers Greg Noll, Pat Curren and many other surfers who surfed Windansea and Vandenberg and then left to Hawaii and  paddled out and attempted what was thought impossible at Waimeia Bay and learning about the transition from 80 lb. boards to the creation of guns for big wave surfing.

In Dec. 1969, the greatest waves ever recorded in Oahu took place due to a massive low pressure system.  The dangerous storm created waves as high as six stories.  This segment featuring Greg Noll surfing the largest wave ever attempted at the time in Makaha.

In the 70's, longboards became overshadowed by shortboards and Waimeia had been usurped by the Banzai Pipeline and Sunset Beach.  But by the 80's, the giant wave riding experience was celebrated through tournaments and how Ken Bradshaw, Marc Foo brought big  wave riding back to Waimeia.

As the film shifts to the 1990's, the film would also feature Mavericks in California known for its big waves, the challenges of surfing the break but also featuring the death of Hawaiian big wave rider Mark Foo in 1994 with actual footage and photos of December 23, 1994.

The film would close out with the most recognized name and face of big wave surfing and the creation of tow-in surfing, Laird Hamilton.  Featuring awesome footage of Laird Hamilton riding a tremendously insane waves including the August 2000 footage of Hamilton riding the most dangerous wave ever attempted (note: the huge swell formed an enormous amount of water under, behind and over Hamilton) and captured on film at CHOPU in Tahiti.

Peralta's ""Riding Giants"" manages to showcase the progression of big wave surfing and its evolution from the 1940's to modern times.

VIDEO & AUDIO:

""Riding Giants"" is presented in 1080p High Definition (1:85:1).  Picture quality varies as classic home video footage to modern footage looks very good  but you can see the combing at times.  In certain interviews, the jump to HD increases the grain amount of certain footage but for the most part, considering that this documentary focuses on the history of surfing, specifically big wave riding and we have all this vintage footage included in this documentary, the importance is seeing this vintage footage that has only been part of someone's home collection for so many years.

The fact that Peralta was able to obtain so much of this older footage is remarkable and you may not get the best PQ due to the age of the video footage, but it still gets a big boost in PQ compared to its DVD counterpart now that the footage is featured in 1080p High Definition.

As for audio, the documentary is presented in English 5.1 DTS-HD MA.  Truthfully, I don't expect too much from documentaries using the surround channels and that dialogue and music are typically front and center channel driven but to my surprise ""Riding Giants"" features audio utilizing the surround and rear surround channels.  You actually hear the waves crashing all around you and you hear the seagulls that is fantastic!  The documentary is dialogue driven but the fact that the documentary did feature lossless audio utilizing the surrounds was pretty awesome.

Subtitles are featured in English, English SDH and Hindi.

SPECIAL FEATURES:

""Riding Giants"" comes with the following special features in standard definition, in English stereo with English subtitles. Included are:

  *
  * Director and Editor's Commentary - Audio commentary by Stacy Peralta and editor Paul Crowder talking about the footage and how grateful they were able to get music and footage for the documentary.  Peralta talks about how the documentary came together and interviewing Greg Knoll,  Greg Hamilton and more.
  * Writer and Surfers' commentary - Audio commentary by Sam George, Greg Knoll, Jeff Clark and Laird Hamilton.  It's cool to hear the surfer's commenting on the footage and further insight from Greg Knoll surfing in Hawaii for the first time.  But everyone's commentary when Laird surfed the killer wave in CHOPU and even to even hear from Greg Knoll and hear him stoked about that wave.  Also, to hear Laird talk about it and how it was made possible because of the straps on the board.  Awesome commentary!
  * The Making of Riding Giants - (28:04) Featuring Stacy Peralta and producer Agi Orsi talking about how the documentary came to fruition and how Stacy was inspired by Greg Knoll and Laird Hamilton to create a documentary about big wave surfing.
  * Fuel TV's Blue Carpet Special - (20:21) Fuel TV at the premiere of ""Riding Giants"" and interviews with the cast and crew promoting the film.  But interesting comments from Peralta of the challenges of doing a documentary on surfing and the pressures involved.
  * Deleted Scenes - Five deleted scenes which include: Surf Talk, Wave Complexity, Half Moon Bay, the Original Ending and end credits sequence.

JUDGMENT CALL:

When I saw this film for the first time, needless to say that I was quite interested to see what Stacy Peralta had to bring after the successful documentary ""Dogtown with Z-Boys"". And after watching his latest documentary, I was amazed of how much footage he was able to get for this film.

Peralta keeps his footage consistent by focusing on the evolution of big wave surfing and I thought it was fantastic how he was able to interview a good number of people for the film but also incorporate their home video footage into the film.  Similar to ""Dogtown with Z-Boys"", where Peralta featured an amazing number of clips and photographs that no one has seen but the owners, he repeats it with ""Riding Giants"" and the results are fantastic.

As a surfer myself, I've grown up to read the stories featured in the film but to hear it from the people and see actual photos and video is amazing.  Greg Noll surfing a huge wave during a major storm is featured in the documentary and to hear him and friends talk about it is very cool but most of all, for those of us who were stunned by Marc Foo's death (especially for us who watched ""Prime Ticket"" and see him covering the various surf competitions on television back in the 90's) were shocked because Marc Foo was among the best from Hawaii in big wave surfing and to hear that he died at Mavericks was a shock.  But I was surprised of how Peralta was able to gather photos and even video footage from that day and to hear those who were present, those who recovered his body was indeed a shock.  But to show the memorials was fitting but also to mention other names include Todd Chesser's death (which was another shock) was also fitting about the challenges of surfing these big waves.  People who know that they can die by attempting the large surf but know that they can't pass it up, this is their passion.

And of course, what better than to end these film with Laird Hamilton.  An innovator and just an all-out gutsy guy that surfer's appreciate for his humbleness but the fact that he is not afraid to conquer the largest of waves.  Also, the documentary is fitting for showcasing his talent as big-wave surfer.  Dana Brown's documentary ""Step Into the Liquid"" showcases Hamilton's innovation towards tow-in surfing but Peralta's ""Riding Giants"" focuses on Laird's mindset of conquering the wave and also featuring footage from him challenging the deadliest wave ever see in CHUPO.

The Blu-ray release of ""Riding Giants"" is similar to Peralta's ""Dogtown with Z-Boys"" in the fact that one should not expect the great picture quality in HD for the documentary as there is so many types of footage incorporated in the film.  From home video to classic vintage footage and photography that ranges in quality.  But that is what makes this documentary so enjoyable because it is able to feature this time capsule of vintage surfing footage and those who were involved with big wave surfing from the 1930's to the 2000's. Audio quality is actually pretty awesome as we hear the lossless audio and the waves crashing all around us.  I definitely like how the surrounds and rear surrounds were used in this documentary.  And also, how they managed to keep all the special features intact including the FUEL TV's ""Blue Carpet Special"" (unlike Dana Brown's ""Step Into the Liquid"", the Blue Carpet Special was dropped in the Blu-ray release).

Overall, ""Riding Giants"" is a wonderful documentary and Peralta really did his homework in gathering the materials to make sure that he managed to keep the pacing intact from the 1940's and showing us how big wave surfing had progressed.

Of course, there is only so much that can be incorporated in this 101 minute documentary and a lot of surfers are not included.  But even in the audio commentary, Sam George explains how it would be too difficult to make this film in chronological order and feature everything especially during the 60's and 70's, so they tried to focus on several people.

For the most part, this ""Riding Giants"" is fantastic but I wished there was some inclusion of big wave surfing from the 1970's and 80's which was barely featured in the documentary.  But it's a documentary done right and I think that it helped having Peralta working with Sam George, Knoll and Hamilton in order to make this film right.  So, it's good to hear a documentary in which the people featured are all in unison so supportive of it.  But overall, ""Riding Giants"" was a title that I was hoping would come out on Blu-ray and sure enough both Peralta documentaries (including ""Dogtown and Z-Boys"") are both being released together on the same day which is definitely awesome!

There are not many surfing related films on Blu-ray, but finally we get one of the better surfing film's out there with ""Riding Giants"".  For those who own the previous version on DVD and have a pretty solid home theater setup at their home, then the upgrade to Blu-ray is well worth it.

Even if you have never seen this documentary before and have an interest in surfing, ""Riding Giants"" is definitely a title worth owning!  Highly recommended!",1262822400,,10814,4.829533116178068
2182221,5,B0006D3HDS,"Surfing movies are often self-consciously cutsy and self-congratulatory. This one isn't. Maybe it's the size of the waves. Maybe it's the kind of person who wants to ride these monsters. Maybe it was a decision by the filmmaker. No matter. The movie's matter-of-fact style eases you into these guys' lives and personas, without fanfare and without signaling what the filmmaker is trying to do. You find yourself walking along beside men who do extraordinary things rather than kneeling at their feet. The movie gives you a real feel for the ambiance or atmosphere of big wave surfing.

In real life, fisherman, explorers, divers, lighthouse workers, and navigators have attempted to fathom the mysteries of the Seven Seas. But befriending the ferocious 80 foot waves on a surf board, with no protection, is reserved for a selected, courageous few who risk their lives every time they choose to ride the waves. This amazing program gives the audience a first-hand graphic look at their oceanic experiences. The photography is spectacular.

For those who are interested in the history of surfing, there is a lot of it here, with the surfers themselves narrating their accounts and challenges in a simple style even non-surfers can understand. These surfers are dare-devils and eccentrics who seem to have a need to thrive on danger. They have some amazing anecdotes to share.

A moving beyond where you started to deep soul reflection about who you are in this world and what you are here doing. A story different for each individual portrayed, but also similar in their personal growth. Their respect for the nature, the ocean, and the wave.

I caught the previews for this on the Discovery Channel and set the DVR to record it in HD.  I started watching it, and my wife, who is usually not interested in this type of sports video, migrated into the living room and sat spellbound like me.  The craziness of the early days of surfing, the board development, and the challenge to survive giant waves are woven into a fascinating documentary.  The photography, especially shots taken from inside killer waves, is stunningly gorgeous.  If you are a fan of Warren Miller ski films, this should be for you.  I purchased the DVD from Amazon so I could share it with my children and friends.

You really get to know the people who made the sport into an industry.  The side stories really fit into the main theme very well and keep the interest at a very high level.  It makes you feel like part of the family of surfers by the way you get into the lives of those who lived the surfing life.  I live about 90 miles away from Half Moon Bay and when the Mavericks Surf Contest was postponed/cancelled this year, my wife and I took notice and even felt bad for the surfers who wouldn't be able to compete this year.

2182235,5,B0006D3HDS,"This movie by Stacy Peralta came on one night on one of my HD movie channels. Lucky for me. I caught it right from the start and recorded it. I was glued to my TV and watched it 2 more times in the next few days. Then I went and got the DVD. I have never surfed a day in my life. I did grow up street skating in NYC back in the 80s and in some small way I feel I can relate to this culture. I was never a ""sports"" guy. I always hated team sports and the jock mentality. Skating attracted me due to it's lack of such ""jocks"". Surfing it seems is very much the same, with nice people I can imagine meeting and talking with. Everyone seemed nice and just out for having fun. The story was peppered with tragedies which I suspected it would when I started watching. This was not glossed over in any way and was told with care and respect for those who paid the ultimate price. The sport, if it can be called that, seems to attract people who are more like artists to me than fanatics, or nuts. The way surfing was spoken of by many of them with such awe, care, love, and respect leeds me to believe that it is to most who do it way more than just a thrilling set of skills and a momentary rush. The film was directed  masterfully and edited in such a way as to truly convey the energy of surfing. I can only imagine how real surfing must feel. If the film could get me all charged up and excited, actual surfing must be 1000 times more exciting and alluring. I recomed this for anyone who can appreciate a good film, a good documentary, and can relate to good whoolesome people with of love of what they do and the courage to follow their bliss all they way, and with no fear.",1174953600,5,1672,4.036144578313253

2182242,5,B0006D3HDS,"At last a surfing movie that is interesting as well as entertaining. 'Giants' spans about 50 years and it's fascinating to see the development in surf boards and surfers. Its a development that's driven by the need for more performance in big waves.  It is the surfers, though, that are the heart of the film.  Greg Noll, the first of three featured big wave riders, is a hugely likeable character, both then in the sixties and now.  The second featured surfer, Jeff Clarke, is the epitome of the man who has committed his whole being to what he loves most, surfing. His courage in surfing alone, for 15 years, the monster called Mavericks, makes one step back and wonder at the man.  The third surfer to feature is Laird Hamilton.  There is a mystique about Laird. His humility portrayed in his acknowledgement of the bravery of his support team is moving.  The footage showing Laird being snatched from the white water by a jet ski racing against an oncoming wall of water is memorable.  The credits at the end are a must see.  A crusty old Gregg Noll reminiscing about his love for Waiamea Bay with tears in his eyes while informing us that he is not emotional is a delight. The movie moves at a good pace and balances nicely drama, excitement, courage and humour.

The footage & soundtracks work well together. From Erik Satie to Alice in Chains; it's a visual & audio masterpiece - especially for music lovers (I wish the entire soundtrack was available on Cd).
Since watching Riding Giants, It's given me a better appreciation & insight into the world of surfing; not only as a way of life, but as a religion too.
The film explores the history of Big Wave Surfing, past & present, and is presented with humor, truth, & some insanity, that comes straight from the heart & soul; as Greg Noll, Jeff Clark, Laird Hamilton share their stories.
Marooned on a dry & dusty mountain in Central Queensland Australia, 'Riding Giants' is a tonic for the mind & spirit, especially for the ocean lover(like me).
Thanks to Stacy Peralta for his fine work - taking us on this journey of an era 'gone but not forgotten'. I give this 5 stars plus (ignore the scale).

2182249,4,B0006D3HDS,"First off, I loved Stacy Peralta's DOGTOWN AND THE Z BOYS so much, I'm pretty much willing to watch anything he makes. And RIDING GIANTS was certainly worth my time. Admittedly, I'm a southern California native who drove a VW surfer van for 20 years, so this type of material has a nostalgic appeal to me that may blind me to its faults.

So to avoid just praising this film for its mind-blowing footage and lively interviews, let me mention as an aside that RIDING GIANTS does not delve very deeply into the ""man-child"" aspects of the  surfing lifestyle. It's all about catching some waves and hanging out on the sand, and I can dig that as much as the next ""haole"" (Hawaiian for ""cheesefoot""). BUT this is a less than attractive characteristic to find in adults. Riding the big waves can result in personality casualties, as well as ""real"" ones, as we learn in film's feature on the Mavericks coastline near Santa Cruz.

SIDELIGHTS: This film has such high production quality, its brief, painfully amateurish animated portions stick out like a sore thumb. And there is arguably a certain sameness to surfing footage after a while. My wife (who has suffered through her share of surfer movies), did turn to me a couple of times to ask, ""Are you SURE we haven't seen this before?"" We hadn't.

Unlike other surf films where mutch of the time surfers do their thing and that is all (some zenlike experience of these supermen on surfboards pulling halucinogenic moves in some far off land) this film had a direction, a progression, a logic that takes the audience along with the people in the film.  Greg Noll is definately the comic relief, however, he is also the most exposed emotionally.  yes he does curse a little bit.  It is somewhat distracting, but the film is soooooo worth it if you choose to ignore his verbage.  As a whole the cinematography and creative 3D re-creations of photos are inspiring.  The truly astounding sizes of these waves are something to be dreamed about if you are in one of those land locked states.  Please watch this movie.

He cusses like a sailor, and made it impossible for us to watch this movie with our young child.  He, and he alone, was the only person to use this foul language, and came across as being nothing more than a big mouth.  No one else in the video cussed once that I remember...

Or, put another way, there's a lot of the old SNL gag, ""I'm Chevy Chase...and you're not,"" in Riding Giants.  If you can get past that thick aura of cool guy -- and it is nearly all guy -- self-congratulation, the film has many, many sequences of amazing surfing (through waves that are in many ways the stars of the movie) that make the case for the sport's danger, beauty, and spiritual appeal far better than any of the surfers' comments.  Three exceptions to that general rule -- the description of recovering the body of Mark Foo, and, over the credits, the rhetorical question of whether if someone were seeking an ultimate religious experience would people call him a ""religious bum"" and Greg Noll's thinking that Waimea winked at him recently as he watched the third or fourth new generation in the waves that he had first ridden.",1137110400,2,1110,4.711340206185567

If you are intrigued by titanic waves (I'm talking in excess of 30+ ft. high!), then this film should captivate you (as it did me) from start to finish.  I can't even recall how many times I got the goosebumps and my heart dropped into my stomach.  Can you imagine paddling 45 minutes through murky, shark-infested waters to catch a 30+ ft. wave north of San Francisco (i.e. Jeff Clark at Maverick's)?  How about towing into ""the most memorable wave ever ridden in the history of Big Wave surfing"" (i.e. Laird Hamilton at Teahupoo)?  This documentary has it all: 1) an educational, historically accurate account of Big Wave surfing; 2) breathtaking film footage of not just surfing, but the lifestyle these guys lead; 3) a great soundtrack; 4) interviews with the pioneers; and 5) direction from the master-de-genre, Stacy Peralta.  Even the extras on the DVD are phenomenal, particularly, the piece that details the making of the film (approx. 40 minutes!).  I found this film particularly moving, in that it made me take a step back, engage in reverie, and assess my own life.  Whether you've surfed everyday of your life since birth or you've never set foot in the ocean before, this film packs substantial value.  Please feel free to disagree with my opinion; let us compare opinions, invite a few more points of view, and debate, like the humans we are.",1136160000,,1434,4.820408163265306
2182260,4,B0006D3HDS,"Director Stacy Peralta's first major film was the documentary ""Dogtown and Z-Boys"", a film detailing the history of skateboarding in America and how the big skating boom came about and those pioneers of which he was a member. Peralta followed up

""Dogtown"" with ""Riding Giants"", a film which is semi-related in theme because ""Riding Giants"" traces the history of Big Wave surfing with a look at the early pioneers as well as where Big Wave is today.

There are really two kinds of serious surfing. There is the short wave surfing which we may see on television and competitions where there is a lot of flash and tricks and perhaps this is even where the glory is (movies like ""Blue Crush"" cover this end of the surfing world). Then there is Big Wave surfing where the surfer needs to get farther off shore to catch a wave that crests higher and breaks harder and may have another wave just as big right behind it so you better not mess up. Peralta tracks the origins and history of Big Wave surfing where guys (it is usually men) are constantly seeking a better wave, a more perfect challenge. They first just paddle out to deeper water and the narration mentions a time where two men paddled out for two hours to reach the spot where they could catch the wave they wanted. Then Peralta shows how Big Wave has changed with different surfing locations and when Jet Skis were used to start towing the surfer into the wave.

I imagine that most people know very little about surfing or Big Wave surfing. I freely admit that nearly everything that I know about surfing came from ""Blue Crush"" and maybe one or two broadcasts of a surfing competition on television. There are two ways that ""Riding Giants"" is a success as a film. The first is that the documentary is informative while being entertaining about the history and the present and possibly the future of Big Wave surfing. It's a world, a lifestyle, and a culture that I had never considered. The second way is that this is a beautiful looking movie. The sight of these big waves rolling in and the men attempting and in many cases succeeding in surfing the waves is incredible. This is fairly short documentary, perhaps an hour and a half, so there is not a large time commitment and I think it is one worth making.

2182261,5,B0006D3HDS,"This is easily one of the best and most breathtaking films I have seen in years. Although I have long been aware of surfing in general, I knew next to nothing about the subset of surfers who pursue the largest waves, and who are the focus of this spectacular documentary. Stacy Peralta's film does what all really great documentaries do: it brings us into a foreign, fascinating world far removed from our own.

Peralta recounts the history of big wave surfing in roughly three acts, each one focusing on a specific surfer in a principal location, along with their numerous colleagues. Peralta also does a good job of placing big wave surfing into the context of the larger surf and beach scenes, especially as they have been seen by popular culture. Riding Giants fully conveys the riders' enthusiasm for big wave surfing, without being so ""inside"" as to be inaccessible to newcomers.

The real impact of the film, however, is far more visceral than sociological. I enjoy the advancement of visual effects in film as much as anyone, but I have to say that I have never seen *any* visual effect as completely astonishing as the real visuals in Riding Giants. These people are doing things that are obviously impossible. I made the mistake of putting this on during dinner, and once things started, I forgot all about my food.

2182268,4,B0006D3HDS,"Here's a simple question.  We have already brilliant films on surfing like 'Endless Summer' and 'Step Into Liquid.'  You might say, ""Do we need another one?""

The answer is Yes, and 'Riding Giants' is the reason, a documentary film about the surfers who risk their lives to ride the big waves in Hawaii, California, and Tahiti.  But the merit of 'Riding Giants' doesn't stop there.  Like 'Dogtown & Z-Boys,' another excellent documentary on skateboarding, the film is not a simple collection of interviews and archive footages.  In other words, you can learn much about the history and art of surfing.

For me, the film has three standout points -- A) breathtaking scenes of surfers sliding down the towering wall of blue water.  To see the giant waves rolling like a tube, and a surfer gliding under the crumbling wall of water is incredible and even awe-inspring.

The film also offers two other fantastic things -- B) array of amateur films shot in the 50s and 60s, showing the free life of surfers, and those footages capture the air of that time.  The last but not least is C) intelligent look on the history of surfing, which is informative even to non-surfers like me.  The film, while showing the fun and danger of big wave surfing, also is effective in elucidating the way how the skills of surfing developed by innovative surfers.  No matter how you consider the life of surfers depicted in this film, they take the techinique of surfing very seriously, and are always trying to bring it to a higher stage.

I really like the last part of their attitudes toward surfing, and 'Riding Giants' shows due respect to these likable surfers.  My only complaint is the film's rather showy editing.  I wanted the surfing footages intact, not with fast-forwarding and cutting them.  That's the only reason for my giving four stars, and otherwise it's excellent.  Those who are interested in this (sub-)culture of America like me, watching the film will be a rewarding experience.",1121990400,5,1979,4.824925816023739
2182269,5,B0006D3HDS,"As an avid beach goer/swimmer/rollerblader, I was so blown by this movie! I have never surfed before, but this movie is so inspirational, that I think one of these days I ought to try surfing even if just for the small waves. It takes a ton of courage and experience to be able to surf like the best surfers featured in this film.

I didn't know that surfing originated more than a thousand years ago in Hawaii, and it was banned by some conservative/religious group. It was reintroduced to the world as a tourism feature attraction a century ago. Greg Noll was the first legendary surfer who pioneered the surfing lifestyle in Waimea in the '50s. Then surfing became mainstream and spread to California when numerous surfing movies were released in the '60s and '70s. The number of surfers had grown from hundreds to millions.

Jeff Clark was one of the bravest and greatest surfers, and he was the first to master Mavericks surfing in the rocky shores of Northern California, and soon attracted some of the best Waimea surfers to catch those waves. It took the life of a veteran surfer named Mark Foo, and the experience shocked many fellow surfers. By the '90s, Hawaiian born Laird Hamilton, who had been trained by his step-dad since he was a kid, had grown up to become the best-known and bravest surfer. He was the first to ride the most dangerous waves and survived it, but left him shocked by the experience.

The film featured numerous interviews on the best surfers, and they talked about their experiences before, during, and after their most memorable times when driven by the sea. It also chronicles the evolution of the surf boards throughout the decades.

It is a real, well written documentary about surfing history, its protagonists, and reaching the limits when it comes to riding big waves.  The documentary shows the birth and evolution of surfing from a small group of people who discovered Hawaii's North Shore to surfing being introduced in the mainstream culture and becoming increasingly popular.  It is nicely split into three sections corresponding to time periods and big-wave spots.  First is Waimea (late 50's to 70's), then Mavericks (mid 70's to 90's), and finally Jaws (90's to today).  Each section describes the story and anecdotes of those who rode these huge waves for the first time.  It ends with footage from a beach in the South Pacific depicting the most unusual dangerous surf spot.

The documentary combines pictures and scenes taken from the very early days until the present with interviews of the big-wave surfers.  It is in this combination where the film succeeds and excels from the common surf movies; the viewer gets sucked into the context and discovers a side of big wave surfing (and surfing in general) that can only be told by the people who made it happen.",1118361600,3,1297,4.885844748858448

From Greg ""the Bull"" Noll who pioneered the sport in the fifties to Laird Hamilton who refined it in the nineties, this excellent documentary chronicles surfing as if it were the space program. And indeed, we see these guys conquer each realm of wave riding as if they venture to alien worlds. The film is broken up by the areas with the biggest, wildest surf spots such as Mavericks in Northern Cali and most notably Peahi in Maui, better known as Jaws, where the water breaks off a coral spur creating monolithic, fifty to eighty foot waves that dwarfs Laird Hamilton as he boards down the face at 30mph (Jaws was also covered in an excellent 1998 National Geographic).

  Not just a documentary, it's a first caliber adventure an adventure that reaffirms human endevour in the face of natures power. And when watching it with someone, turn and watch their eyes dialate in awe when they see these waves. Seriously, Jaws is no joke.

It's a perfect time for a surfing film and Riding Giants, the 2004 entry into list the ever-growing documentaries about the sport, is one of the best.  By now I take the spectacular cinematography that is possible today for granted.  But I just cannot get enough of the real-life stories of the surfers who risk their lives for their obsession.

For example, there is Jeff Clark.  For fifteen years he surfed all by himself in frigid water off the rocky coast of California just north of San Francisco.  When other surfers finally discovered these waves, the best of them rushed there with photographers at the ready.  The cameras were running when a well know and experienced surfer, Mark Foo, drowned.  And then there is Laird Hamilton.  He's enjoying his fame and fortune now.  But we first meet him in the late sixties, a little boy of 4 years old, who loved to body surf.  One of the surfers took an interest in the little boy, and wound up marrying his single mother.  Little Laird grew up in the world of surfing and has recently made a fortune when he developed a business for jet skis and a towing boats  Formerly, it would take hours for a surfer to get out to the big waves.  But now this is done in a matter of minutes and it's changed the sport entirely.

The film is a documentary about surfing from the 1950s on.  I've seen other films on this subject but it seems there is always new and fresh material.  This time it is includes some vintage home movies about group of young men who defined convention, and went off to live on the beach and do nothing but surf all day.  We watch them  surfing and playfully living their free and fun life.  Many of them are still alive with happy memories of that time.  And some of them continued to surf, becoming legends in the sport.

In addition the great cinematography, there are also drawings.  In one section of the film the surfers talk about what it feels like to be buried under a mountain of waves.  Naturally there are no photos to illustrate this.  But the drawings really gave me a feeling of what it must be like.

This is a fine film.  I loved every minute of it.  But, I honestly had a sinking feeling in the pit of my stomach as I watched these surfers having so much pleasure in the surf when I thought about the recent tsunami tragedy.

It's not just a ""surfer movie"". It's not another ""Endless Summer"" with merely lots of cool surfing footage (although it has all that for sure). It's as much about people who are passionate, inspired to keep stepping just a little further in the face of self-doubt and fear for the reward of being in a higher place -- metaphorically and, in the case of this movie, literally.",1108252800,,807,4.690140845070423

This review can't match the detail or eloquence of the spotlighted reviews.  What I can say is that Peralta captures the passion that grips each of the surfers he interviews.  What else but passion makes a guy paddle 45 minutes through cold Northern Cali surf to surf a monstrous wave that, if it doesn't drown him, can pound his body through a boneyard?  And does it solo for fifteen years?  That, my friends, is the passion of someone who loves what he does without any regard for glory or fame.  May we all find that one thing in life that inspires us so.

My only critique (one that I had with SIL and ES II, but that doesn't mean the movie is less than five stars) is that the movie lacks a discussion of the severe localism that plagues certain beach communities and is inconsistent with the surfing happy face presented here.

The section on Mavricks in Northern California was especially good before ending back in Hawaii with present-day monster-wave surfing legend Laird Hamilton.

The photography is absolutely stunning making you go, like, ""Whoa, dude! How they get that shot?"" The interviews with both old and current big-wave riders were well done, very entertaining, and quite informative. All in all, a masterful movie, even for non-surfers.

2182284,4,B0006D3HDS,"Stacy Peralta's ""Riding Giants"" is a worthy successor to his groundbreaking ""Dogtown and Z-Boys"". Worthy, but not as important, simply because he's not covering a story that's gone untold as he did before.

When Peralta did ""Dogtown & Z-Boys"", he was not only documenting a moment in time that was unknown to most outside a small niche culture, it was almost forgotten by the current generation of skaters who owed many of their moves & attitudes to it. This made ""Dogtown & Z-Boys"" not only an enjoyable documentary, but an important one as well.

""Riding Giants"" covers ground that has been partially covered before, most recently in ""Step Into Liquid"". What does set ""Riding Giants"" apart from the pack of surf documentaries are never-seen archival footage & photos from the late 1950's, shot by one of the original big-wave riders, Greg Noll. The shots of Hawaii's North Shore nearly 50 years ago are amazing; no hotels, no crowds, hardly any roads. Noll & his compadres were true trailblazers into this unknown frontier.

A highlight of the film is the Mavericks section. The home movie footage spotlights how courageous Jeff Clark was to surf this gnarly, cold brute for 15 years by himself. Although Clark downplays the bravery displayed by categorizing  Mavericks as his ""refuge"", when surfer Mike Ho is killed his first day there, the danger is made clear to even the driest couch potato.

My favorite part of the DVD is one of the Special Features. In additon to the usual director's commentary, the viewer can also eavesdrop on the surfers themselves discussing the movie as it plays. Listening to Greg Noll, Laird Hamilton & Jeff Clark pointing out the finer aspects of take offs, board design, & swapping anecdotes is truly a treat & not to be missed!

So, ""Riding Giants"" isn't indispensable in the way ""Dogtown & Z-Boys"" is, but the DVD is certainly worth purchasing for the special features. You'll definitely be viewing it multiple times.",1105920000,,1955,4.909090909090909
2182285,5,B0006D3HDS,"This film keeps its word: it is a documentary in the true sense of giving the viewer a comprehensive understanding of how big wave surfing evolved.  Although I had seen a handful of films about surfing and always appreciated its power, beauty, and Zen quality, it wasn't until seeing this film that I understood how surfers developed the brilliant series of innovations that led from surfing big waves on long boards to tow-in surfing and the almost limitless flexibility of surfing the biggest waves on short boards.  It was also interesting to see how the sport exploded in the U.S. almost overnight from the quixotic pastime of a few misfits to a national phenomenon.  While it would be easy to dismiss big wave surfers as adrenaline junkies, I think they are on to something much more profound.  For them, surfing is a crucible that distills their being to the pure essentials and places them in direct contact with the mystery of existence.  While most of society relies on material enrichment as its measure of success and happiness, the surfer's Nirvana is the ephemeral moment of riding the perfect wave.  If there is such a thing as reincarnation, I definitely want to come back as a big wave rider.",1105747200,,1208,4.783653846153846
2182286,4,B0006D3HDS,My wife rented this DVD for me and I reluctantly watched it (alone) and I was more than pleasantly surprised. I have surfed for over 30 years but learned a great deal from this film. This documentary is a great history lesson in surfing. The commentary by Gregg Noll as well as the footage of Laird Hamilton's death-defying ride at Teahupoo are worth the price alone. I now own this DVD .,1105488000,2,388,4.402777777777778
2182287,5,B0006D3HDS,"""Riding Giants"" is a superb documentary on the history of big wave surfing, directed and co-written by Stacy Peralta, who also made 2001's skateboarding documentary ""Dogtown and Z-Boys"". Peralta was a Z-Boy himself, as well as a skateboarding manufacturer and videomaker, so ""Dogtown"" was very much his element. But ""Riding Giants"" surpasses ""Dogtown"" with improved technical proficiency, writing, and editing. It's a dynamic account of the history of the surfing subculture, starting centuries ago, but focusing on the past 55 years, which saw surfing explode into mainstream culture and become extraordinarily athletic and increasingly daring.

""Riding Giants"" has 3 parts or acts, each concentrating on one surfing innovator and the culture in which he thrived. The first act explores the world of Greg Noll, surfing's flamboyant celebrity of the 1950s and 1960s. Interviews with Noll and other surfing giants of the time, including Ricky Grigg, Mickey Munoz, and Mike Stang, take us through the genesis of the surfing lifestyle in Southern California to Hawaii's Waimea Bay, through the explosion in surfing popularity brought on by ""Gidget"" in 1959, up until Noll surfed ""the greatest swell of the 20th century"" at Makaha in December of 1969. ""Riding Giants""' second act focuses on Jeff Clark and the surfers of Maverick's in Northern California. Clark tells the story of surfing Maverick's alone for 15 years before finally convincing 2 other surfers to join him in 1990. Maverick's surfers talk about the challenges of cold water, fog, and rocks and the day that Mark Foo died. The third act of ""Riding Giants"" profiles Laird Hamilton, a man who has been described as the ""best big wave rider the world has seen"", and explores the relatively new field of tow-in surfing, in which surfing becomes a partnership instead of a solitary pursuit. A tow-in by a jet ski provides surfers with the speed required to catch enormous waves -up to 80 feet- at considerable peril. Hamilton and fellow surfers Darrick Doerner, Dave Kalama, and Gerry Lopez talk about discovering the tow-in technique and surfing Peahi (Jaws).

To tell the story of surfing's history, ""Riding Giants"" makes use of old movie footage provided by Greg Noll, hundreds of archival photographs, interviews with surfers who were there, and the knowledge of co-writer Sam George, the editor of ""Surfer"" magazine. Modern footage of Waimea, Maverick's, and Peahi, some of which is quite stunning, conveys the beauty and incredible power of big waves. A digital technique that transforms a still photograph into a 3-dimensional image and allows the ""camera"" to pull through it has been applied to some photos of big waves with spectacular effect. In short, this is not only an informative film; it is also quite beautiful. ""Riding Giants"" successfully communicates the exhilaration of big wave surfers, so that even someone like me, who doesn't care much for water, can understand their passion and applaud their accomplishments. ""Riding Giants"" is a wonderfully entertaining look at the world of big wave surfing that everyone can enjoy. I hope to see an Oscar nomination for Stacy Peralta.

The DVD: Bonus features include a making-of documentary, a featurette on the film's premiere, 5 deleted scenes, 2 promo spots (for the soundtrack and for Quiksilver), and 2 audio commentaries. ""The Making of Riding Giants"" (27 minutes) starts out discussing the film's genesis and includes comments by director Stacy Peralta, the producers, Greg Noll, Laird Hamilton, and Paul George. Then it gets into details of how the film was put together: the interviews, editing, sound, and photos, as explained by Peralta and editor Paul Crowder. ""Fuel TV's Blue Carpet Special"" (20 minutes) is a piece about the film's Hollywood premiere at the Egyptian Theater that includes interviews and film clips. It's too long and dull. The audio commentaries are both interesting. The first commentary, by director Stacy Peralta and editor Paul Crowder, is about filmmaking. Peralta and Crowder discuss the technical aspects of putting the film together. The one fault that I find is that they frequently talk about the film's music, but we cannot hear what they're referring to, as the film's audio is turned off for this entire commentary. The second commentary, by Sam George, Greg Noll, Jeff Clark, and Laird Hamilton, is about surfing. They don't discuss making the film, but they comment on everything that they see in the film, including more details about the archival footage and commentary on nearly every surfer who appears onscreen. Aspiring documentarians will appreciate Peralta and Crowder's audio commentary. The surfers' commentary is pretty entertaining for a wide audience. Subtitles for the film are available in English and French.",1105488000,126,4791,5.24380704041721
2182288,5,B0006D3HDS,"Stacy Peralta does it again. This is the second from him, the first being ""Dogtown and Z-Boys"". The Dogtown movie is about skateboarding in its infancy and was very well done. ""Riding Giants"" is about the culture and history of surfing and is a fun and extremely well-done, enjoyable ride. I highly recommend it to anyone who is even remotely interested in sports, surfing, beach culture, Hawai'i, etc. Please don't pass this gem by simply because you don't surf and think it hasn't got anything to offer to a non-surfing audience. The photography is incredible, and historic stills and film footage are seamlessly blended into the mix. All in all a fantastic documentary film.",1105315200,,677,4.947368421052632
2182289,5,B0006D3HDS,"Imagine yourself falling from 50 feet into rapid water that spins you around as if you were inside a coin operated laundry machine.  The currents in the water are strong enough to break your neck through whiplash, or pull your arms out of their sockets.  You do not know what direction is up or down in the dark water as you can feel your lungs screaming for oxygen.  This while the surf leash that is connected to your ankle and your surfing board yanks on your leg as if your leg were about to be pulled off the body.  In your mind you hope your surf leash has not been caught in some rock on the bottom, as you begin to pull on the leash hoping it is the direction toward the surface.  Then you see it appear out of nowhere, light followed by air, which again fills your lungs. You say to yourself, ""Wow, lets find another wave to ride.""  Riding Giants is a story about individuals that continue to seek the big waves.

The sport of surfing is a leisure activity to many as they go to the beach in order to catch a good wave upon which they wish to surf without wiping out.  Films have been made such as Endless Summer (1966), North Shore (1987), and Blue Crush (2002) and they all depict surfing in one way or another.  However, these films do not depict the lifestyle or philosophy behind catching the big wave as meticulously as Riding Giants.

The director Stacy Peralta who brought the world of cinema Dogtown and the Z-Boys (2001), a documentary about the south Californian subculture that brought the world the evolution of skateboarding, documents the life of some daring surfers and why they are looking for big waves.  Peralta is a devoted surfer and skateboarder who knows how to capture these moments as she brings a fearsome adventure to the audience through a well-made documentary.  The waves that these surfers want ride with their surfboards will most likely cause fear leading to tremors as the waves are as tall as five story houses.

The documentary begins with a quick 2-minute history lesson illustrating one thousand years of surfing history and how it once was banned through missionaries that thought the relaxed mingling of sexes and the little clothing on surfers was outrageous.  It is after this quick and rather amusing introduction that surfing of giant waves begins as the story displays some of the pioneering surfers.

Riding Giants displays generations of big wave surfers as it evolved from regular surfing where people ride small four feet waves to extreme surfing where people ride 50 foot waves.  These individuals are fully aware of what they are doing and the dangers that come with big wave surfing as they began to seek new locations to surf.  Some of these locations were considered too dangerous such as Waimea Bay, which once had urban legends intensify the fear for the area.  Nonetheless, the world got its first big wave representative through the no-nonsense Greg Noll who wore his rebellious black and white stripped swimming trunks with a no-fear attitude as he surfed Waimea Bay.

In present time Laird Hamilton is the world's leading big wave surfer as he began to use smaller surfing boards and jet skis to increase the ability to catch bigger and bigger waves.  Hamilton's ideas has also brought a sense of teamwork to the surfers where they require each other for survival in case of a wipe-out.  Unfortunately has the world also seen many tragic accidents such as Mark Foo who drowned at Mavericks outside San Francisco after having wiped out after a second surf.  Despite these tragic losses the surfers continue to surf as they are aware of the dangers, but it is the danger that provides the opportunity for these select few to fully live life as the are looking to ride the next wave.",1105228800,8,3749,4.67427701674277
2182290,5,B0006D3HDS,"While the Billabong Odyssey tried to recreate The Endless Summer for the big wave surfing set, Riding Giants is much more ambitious. Fresh from the success of his documentary on `70s skateboarding, Dogtown and the Z Boys, Stacy Peralta takes the next logical step and tackles the history of big wave surfing. What makes these men and women ride such huge waves and run the risk, in some cases, of almost certain death? This doc attempts to answer that question.

Peralta breaks things down into three acts, each one dominated by three legends of the sport from different eras. Greg Noll is a renowned surfer who rode the biggest wave ever. Jeff Clark tamed the wild surf 20 miles from San Francisco known as Mavericks. Laird Hamilton, the greatest big wave surfer of his generation, pioneered a new method for riding big waves further from the shore than had been previous attempted.

There is an audio commentary by Stacy Peralta and his editor Paul Crowder. They talk at length about the film was put together in terms of editing. This is an engaging, informative track.

Surfing fans are in for a real treat with the second commentary track that features surfers, Sam George, Greg Noll, Jeff Clark and Laird Hamilton. It's great to hear these guys, especially Noll, tell old stories and cut loose with surf lingo. They joke and have fun watching the movie. It is also interesting to hear them talk about the technique of various surfers.

""The Making of Riding Giants"" is a 28-minute look at how Peralta made this doc. Peralta even talks about how he did his research and organized his doc.

""Fuel TV's Blue Carpet Special"" is a 20-minute look at the premiere of the film at the Egyptian Theater with stars like John Cusack in attendance.

Also included are five deleted scenes that include plenty of surfing sequences that were cut for time and a slightly different ending that would have utilized a Coldplay song.

There are also promos for the soundtrack and surf gear company Quiksilver.

Riding Giants presents an engaging look at the history of big wave surfing and the men and women who seek the ultimate wave: one that is bigger and larger than anyone has experienced before. This is a fantastic documentary, quite possibly the best one on surfing since The Endless Summer. It is easy for the newcomer to understand and enjoy and yet it also treats its subject with respect as well.",1105056000,28,2393,4.749397590361446
2182291,5,B0006D3HDS,"Riding Giants is a brilliant documentary that dives deep into the world of one of the most underappreciated sports and brings to the surface a very human and raw emotion that only director Stacy Peralta could capture.  Everything from the structure, to the players, to the amazing stock footage, to even the style in which this was filmed only reinforced the beauty and power behind the sport of surfing.  Of all the surfing films that I have seen (Endless Summer, Billabong Odyssey, and Step Into Liquid) this was the most consistent and relevant.  Beginning with the early ages of surfing (a brief history lesson) lasting all the way till Laird's infamous ride, Riding Giants goes further into the mind, heart, and soul of the sport than any of these other documentaries.  How does it do this?  By giving us the whole story, from start to finish, without fictionalizing or jig jagging from wave to wave.

To begin this film was structurally sound.  In the other films that I have seen about surfing, you sometimes find yourself jumping from new person to new person, wave to wave, event to event, without any knowledge of why or who?  In Riding Giants, we have a very small cast of veterans and newbies.  This allows you to really go deeper into the mind of each one.  Also, instead of just riding waves, we are handed more history and more personal insight to the world than before.  This is what really attracted me to this film.  I was impressed that instead of showing all these big waves (because it is a big wave movie), we listen to stories and see first hand what these surfers had to overcome to get to those waves.  I loved the information about the ""beach bums"" or father's of surfing.  I am still floored by the amazing tales of Greg Noll and his early adventures into the harsh deep blue.  Then, to see him in person, talking about what was going on in his mind, only added more fuel to the fire.  The straightforward structure that Peralta followed allowed me to follow and walk away with more knowledge of the sport than with any of the earlier films.  Peralta shows so much emotion and passion that you cannot help but be amazed by what these brave people have done, and where the sport is going.

Add to a immaculate structure some intense and creative cinematography, and you have darn near perfect film.  Using techniques that I last saw in The Kid Stays in the Picture, Riding Giants creates some scenes that almost feel as if they are jumping out of the screen.  While it isn't 3D, it is that flat dimensional feeling that you get when you put two pictures on top of each other.  In this film, it worked.  It created more depth to the scenes, and really added to not just the shock value (man these waves were huge), but also the danger that these guys constantly faced.  If it broke differently or they maneuvered wrong, these waves would kill them.  Some did die, but it didn't stop the sport.  It only created more excitement and more passion to do better.  It is this love of the ocean and sport that leads me to my final point.

The human element.  So many of my earlier adventures in the world of surfing documentaries left me with beautiful waves, but very little about the people.  The films knew that people were watching for the waves, so it would basically go from wave to wave to wave and the maybe a short second about the person.  This film was the direct opposite.  Peralta created this masterpiece by still giving us the waves, but devoting so much more attention onto the surfers and the immortal question of why they do this everyday.  What rushes through their minds, what pushes them to go further, and the bonds that are formed while out there on the wild blue yonder.  I felt like after watching this film that I not only knew more about big wave surfing, but also about the emotional side to the sport.  This was an element not as developed in the other films and pushed Riding Giants to a whole new personal level.

Overall, this film was brilliant.  Never have I witnessed so much passion, devotion, and love wrapped in a structurally sound film.  From beginning to end, I was impressed.  I would be very happy if this film won the Oscar this year for Best Documentary, and to see a new rebirth in the surfing world and open more doors for films of this nature.

2182292,5,B0006D3HDS,"I had a ticket to see Riding Giants at the 2004 Sundance Film Festival. I didn't know much about it rather that it was a surf documentary, and when I came out after the screening, I was completely blown away and on an adreniline rush that I haven't experienced in a long time during a film. The history of surfing was a lot more interesting than it seems, and this film truely shows it. It starts with a very neat part cardboard cutout, part still photograph, part animated sequence that tells the origins of surfing from Hawaii dating way back. The brief history then brings us to the history of big wave surfing and the surf ledgends that started the new generation of surfers in the late fifties continuing until now. It shows how these boys were social drop-outs and spent time being together, goofing off, and surfing. It wasn't a sport to impress chicks, it was an act of rebellion and the adventure of pushing the limits. It has original film footage of the pioneers, all the way up through surfing superstar of the now, Laird Hamilton. As I described before about the still photographs and Animation, later on in the film there are still photographs of the famous surfers who have pushed the limits. The effect used on the photograph makes the pictures look 3-dementional, and really adds to the entertainment of the film. The pictures look like they are actually really moving pictures, they are great. I am not a surfer. I am from Salt Lake City and the only thing close to surfing I have done is snowboarding. I didn't know very much about surfing, but this film is great for the biggest die hard fan of surfing and the date he has that only knows what a surf board is because she saw her dads beach boys album cover. It is great entertainment, and worth of buying. A Plus.",1104796800,5,1784,4.5092592592592595
2182293,5,B0006D3HDS,"I had no real intention to see this film, but after being dragged to see it, I had to admit it was truly an incredible movie. Even though I live in a beach city, I am not exactly an avid surfer, yet I still enjoyed it a lot. This film is interesting enough to be viewed by anyone, interested in surfing or not.

The history of surfing is very fascinating and it is very cool to see interviews with the people who love the thrill of riding giant waves. The footage of the surfing is especially amazing, seeing the tiny guy riding in a monolith of water is just dream-like and truly incredible. I also loved the retro footage of 50s and 60s era surf culture, if you are in to that culture or stlye at all, I recommend this film simply for that aspect.

Another great part of the movie was the music, which I enjoyed so much I bought the soundtrack. It covers a diverse ammount of surf rock, hawaiian music, and epic rock ballads, and every piece fits brilliantly well with the visuals.

A very high-quality documentary and interesting film in general. 5 stars.",1103587200,4,1058,4.3604060913705585
