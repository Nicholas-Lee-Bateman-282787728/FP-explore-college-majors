Quirky dark comedy.",1335571200,7,121,4.809523809523809
8187775,3,B000OYQ2TA,"I seen this movie as a young 20 year old.  Seemed great that it was actually on TV with some nudity...plot seemed good back then too.  But as I watch it now in my 50's, it was boring....but still interesting cause Burton makes a good psychopathic character---text book!  But the price I paid for this movie was not worth it.",1313971200,6,324,4.366666666666666
8187776,3,B000OYQ2TA,"The quality of this rather expensive video is very poor, as if someone videotaped the original from a TV screen and made copies.  Shows up like the movie, ""Multiplicity,"" where Michael Keaton's orignal form is degraded to the point of absurdity.",1251763200,11,245,4.975609756097561
