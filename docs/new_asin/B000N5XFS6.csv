8175047,5,B000N5XFS6,"The real deal...identifies with the struggles and triumphs that we all face in life.  Very relatable for everyday people like me.  Some religious people may be offended but Jesus came for the everyday person.  Great music, great message...reaches outside of the paradigm of the self righteous religious crowd.  The message that I get from Larry Norman is that Jesus was truly the friend of sinners and he accepts us with all of our garbage and brings us from death to life.  We get there not because we are good but because we accept the goodness of God.  Thanks for the message and the music dude.",1391126400,,598,4.647619047619048
8175048,5,B000N5XFS6,"I have to applaud Larry Norman for putting on this concert. It is painful to note that his health had caused problems for him,  but the fact that he came out to give a concert fueled by his love for people was heartwarming. His consistant love for God allowed him to touch lives despite his health issues. This is a special video in my collection.",1291161600,2,347,4.338461538461538
8175049,1,B000N5XFS6,"I watched a documentary at the Cinequest Film Festival about a year ago on Larry and was disturbed to find out that he had a son he neglected. I met him while we were in San Jose, and was very sad to see the family not cooperating. I don't mind rockers playing fast an loose but to do this and claim to be a follower of Jesus, makes me wonder. I wouldn't buy anything from him again. And I was a big fan.",1285804800,,404,3.8795180722891565
