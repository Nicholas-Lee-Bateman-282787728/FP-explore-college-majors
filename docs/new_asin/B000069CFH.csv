1731992,5,B000069CFH,This is a series that I once read with my mother and have revisited every few years since.  Then I saw the BBC adaptation of the first 4 books (according to the pre '95 non-chronicle numbering of the books) on the Disney Channel in the early 90's and found it to be a wonderful adaptation of these timeless books(even though they did not adapt all 7 which is a shame). I have enjoyed my VHS set for 8 years and look forward to being able to update to DVD.  Definately a must see for families and fantasy lovers!!!,1027468800,11,513,4.224489795918367
1731993,5,B000069CFH,"I could find things to pick at (The Silver Chair just goes on forever), but I have enjoyed this series immensely.  My children have been even bigger fans.  I only wish that the BBC had produced all of the Narnia stories.",1026777600,4,220,4.341463414634147

I am really mad about getting this version.  It is like a 10 year old made it.  Poor dialog, poor acting, Poor directing and the list goes on. I hope Amazon will let me exchange it if they have the right version.",1510185600,,382,3.986842105263158

The remastering and enhancement that was done is incredible, such vivid colors! No, this is not a film series for those only comfortable with state of the art image quality and effects- but as a cherished part of my childhood, its bigger, brighter, and even better than the ones I had so long ago!

1732026,5,B000069CFH,Amazing story from C.S. Lewis.  A world with good and evil that trees talk and so do the animals.  This has the great lion to show Jesus and what he did for us.  This series is not a scary as the new one.,1485734400,5,204,3.697674418604651

1732030,5,B000069CFH,"As a fan of these books, this set of movies may not have all the modern special effects /CGI as the modern movies, but I believe they portray a version much closer to the books and what CS Lewis was trying to convey.",1484870400,,216,4.046511627906977
1732031,5,B000069CFH,My two now adult children used to watch these films on VHS tapes years ago and they still love them on DVD.

1732032,4,B000069CFH,"I absolutely adore this adaptation of C.S. Lewis book. Unfortunately, I only gave it 4 stars because this production is broken down into separate ""chapters"", making it not so seamless to watch. Having seen this originally on TV as a full movie, I didn't know that it would be filmed like this. I gave away the 1st set I purchased, but I enjoy this version so much more than the recent Disney movies, so I will purchase it again! I rather like the crude cinemagraphics and ""cheesy"" animation!",1484092800,,491,4.590909090909091

It is a great story.",1481673600,,359,4.115942028985507
1732038,5,B000069CFH,"I have not bought these on Amazon yet, but I saw all of them years ago. I love these BBC versions of Narnia stories! I like them more than the recent Disney versions, not because of their quality in filming which is not at the same level as the newer ones, but I liked that they are truer to the actual books. The acting is good, the characters are likable, and for the time they were made the scenery is really impressive. For someone who loves all the Narnia books they will appreciate how close to the books these movies are. I plan to get this set again (had on vhs a long time ago) to add to the Disney ones I have already. I had been very disappointed in the Voyage of the Dawn Treader done by Disney as the story line was changed a LOT and I like that this version was not changed. The special effects are not consistent with today's standards, but to me it adds charm and I enjoy the props and costumes without any animation. I personally would give these more than five stars. Though they are older they are still magical to me.",1481328000,2,1037,4.19

They are probably just fine versions but not what my child asked for this Christmas.  These will be either going back or donated.",1481241600,,418,4.1234567901234565

1732045,5,B000069CFH,"While the production is obviously from an earlier era, the content is excellent and consistent with the original books by C.S. Lewis!!!!  The new versions  of books in the Narnia series often contain erroneous and inaccurate content and present relationship emotions that are not consistent with the original books. For example, there is no rivalry between Prince Caspian and High King Peter.  Their relationship is of respect, supportive and courteous. What an opportunity to demonstrate to young people how these attitudes accomplish much more than a constant tension.  I wish that modern producers would realize that the books they make into a movie have stood the test of time because of their content and no need to change it.",1475280000,15,731,5.117647058823529
1732046,5,B000069CFH,"I wish I could give this 4.5 stars, but I'll go with 5 since I think Narnia fans should buy it.  The cinematography is very corny, but it was made in the 1980's and it can't compete with the CGI movies of today.  Story-wise, it's terrific.  It is basically the first four Narnia books put onto television.  There is very little added dialogue, and in The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe, I think nearly every line from the book made it onto the screen--very true to the book!  The bad special effects are a little distracting, but my kids didn't care because the story is so good.

Prince Caspian was slightly disappointing for a couple reasons.  They did the whole thing in one hour (2 episodes), which meant a LOT of the book got cut out, but they did manage to get a surprising amount crammed in.  One more episode would have made it feel much less rushed, and I feel that some of the story and deep meaning wasn't clear in all of the hurrying.  But, this is probably most people's least favorite Narnia book, and the most difficult to do without CGI (how does an army of trees defeat an army of men without some computer generated help?)

The Voyage of the Dawn Treader got more screen time, and it helped.  Again, they stayed so true to the book, which was refreshing because it's such a good story, and because the recent Disney version mishmashes the story so much that it was barely recognizable.

Haven't watched The Silver Chair yet, but I'm looking forward to Puddleglum!

The acting is quite good--Barbara Kellerman as the White Witch really stands out.",1475107200,6,1566,4.51063829787234

1732081,3,B000069CFH,"The 3-Star rating is an average of product review and movie reviews.

First, the Product. I was thrilled to receive this as a gift, because my VCR ate my VHS copies of these movies long ago. But this DVD set is not the best quality. I had to ask the giver to return it because the first disc was missing entire scenes of the LLW movie and I just kept getting looped back to the menu. Not to mention, although these movies originally aired as BBC miniseries, I don't think that means they should format the DVDs that way! It's incredibly annoying to be watching a movie, and every few scenes have to skip the credits and then skip the intro music. That was not thought out well. I enjoy the extras, like cast interviews and behind-the-scenes footage, but that doesn't make the movie formatting less annoying. 1 Star for product.

As for the movies, 5 Stars!!
It makes me disgusted to see reviews that say the Disney movies are better than these. The Disney movies have almost nothing to do with the actual books except character names and a vague concept - especially Prince Caspian and Dawn Treader. I don't know what books the Disney writers read, but it certainly wasn't the Chronicles of Narnia; though it's obvious that they watched a lot of The Lord of the Rings movies for inspiration, so much so that the battle scenes are inappropriate for many children (not a problem with the BBC adaptation)! And Disney absolutely destroyed the characters of both Peter and Prince Caspian. But I won't go into that further here. This review is about the BBC productions.

These BBC movies are spot-on. Much of the dialogue is directly quoted from the books, and delivered with real belief on the part of the actors. When the children hear the name of Aslan, you feel the wonder (and nervousness on the part of Edmund). Rather than expecting a cinematic masterpiece, go into it understanding that the format is more like an on-location stage play. And while the special effects are a bit lacking (cartoon magical creatures and costumed people as talking animals), it's more than made up for by the magic and realism that you can't find in a big-screen blowout like what Disney made. Realism doesn't come from effects, but from sincerity and emotion. Real and realistic are not the same thing, which is something the BBC understands clearly, and around which Disney just can't wrap their heads.

I grew up watching these movies taped off of PBS, and the effects never bothered me. I knew that the Beavers, Reepicheep, and Tumnus were people in costume, but that didn't make it less real to me as I watched them, or enjoyable. I still wanted to go to Narnia. And, as a prolific reader, I didn't find a disparity between the books and movies that bothered me, as so many book-to-movie adaptations tend to do.

I recently watched this collection with my children and they loved that this BBC version is so true to the books - word-for-word in many places. Everything about this series is wonderfully Narnian. Yes, the special effects are dated, but this production is more akin to a live-action play performance than a modern movie and it holds up very well under those criteria.

More full-bodied and accurate than recent  versions of Lewis' work, these BBC flicks give viewers time to get what's going on plot-wise and message-wise, and are open to the truths that C.S. Lewis took pains to convey.",1430352000,2,399,5.21875

1732135,4,B000069CFH,"I'm actually reviewing two different sets. One is three discs from BVe Entertainment, in individual Amray cases in a boxed set. The other is from BBC/2|Entertain and contains 4 discs.

Basically, both of these contain the same thing: the BBC/Wonderworks TV adaptations of C.S. Lewis' first four Narnia books (in publication order): The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe; Prince Caspian; The Voyage of the Dawn Treader and The Silver Chair. These are live action, but were made in the late 80s/early 90s for British TV and public telvision, so the budgets are low. The pacing is slow, the acting touch and go, but overall faithful adaptations. Most of the unique characters of Narnia are pulled off with makeup, costumes, simple visual effects and occasionally animation. Aslan is portrayed by a puppet with an animatronic face that isn't always so convincing. The music can't be faulted, however. That opening theme is perfect.

The difference is that the HVe set contains the stories edited together as movies while the BBC|2Entertain set presents them in their original episode format. Thus, it's up to you to decide what format you want them in unless you decide to get both. The 2|Entertain set also contains subtitles and better bonus features, which might be a point in its favor.

Both sets contain stills galleries. The HVe set contains an excerpt from a BBC Bookworm show (on the first DVD) about C.S. Lewis which features a tour of Lewis' home and a clip from the TV series. The BBC/2|Entertain set contains the stills galleries on each respective disc. A fourth disc is included, featuring a discussion by Humphery Carter, interviews with the cast from 1988 and 2003, featurettes about the making of the series and outtakes.

While the Bookworm excerpt is nothing to completely brush off for a Narnia fan, overall if you had to pick one based on bonus features alone, the BBC/2|Entertain set definitely wins. However, some may prefer the HVe set so they can watch the stories without episode breaks. If you want both presentations and all the bonus features and are okay with that, go ahead and get both sets.",1429747200,9,2119,4.910614525139665

1732145,4,B000069CFH,"I watched these over and over again when I was a little kid; they were my introduction to Narnia, and I still pop them in once in a while. They are faithful, if imperfect, adaptions of the wonderful books, and actually rather refreshing after the rather pretentious and wishy-washy newer versions. I do enjoy the Disney adaptions as well, but I always manage to come back to these eventually. There is a sincerity in these productions that many modern movies lack. Controversial or not, it's always frustrating when moviemakers alter lines from the books to be more politically correct.
These films appear to be made with a rather low budget, but I like to say it seems as though the moviemakers threw what little money they had into designing Aslan, who trumps Disney's computerized Aslan by a mile.
The acting is generally good. Richard Dempsey (Peter) and Sophie Cook (Susan) do very well. And though she is, in my opinion, a bit old for the role of Lucy, Sophie Wilcox definitely puts her all into the part. Jonathan R. Scott as Edmund is a bit over-the-top in the beginning, but he does have his good moments and he does an admirable job at all his parts after he is rescued from the White Witch. The White Witch herself is also exaggeratedly portrayed, but Barbara Kellerman later performs excellently as the Emerald Witch in The Silver Chair.
Jean Marc Perret did a wonderful job as Prince Caspian in the first part of Prince Caspian & the Voyage of the Dawn Treader, as did David Thwaites as Eustace before, during, and after his transformation into a dragon.
Eustace as a dragon is another area that seems to have received the bulk of its film's budget. The plastic clicks of the helmets early on in The Voyage of the Dawn Treader are quite forgettable when you see the unique design of that scaly fire breather.
There is not an overuse of music in the films, though the main theme is soulful, and most of the sets are just what you would imagine while reading the books.
All in all, these are very satisfying productions that can be enjoyed by any age.",1425772800,5,2062,4.605978260869565

1732305,4,B000069CFH,"Though it lacks the big-budget flash of modern, digital filmmaking techniques, this version is far and away superior to the recent Disney (and ""Disneyfied"" and ""Hollywoodized"") versions of ""The Chronicles of Narnia."" The books are adapted very well to the screen, in most cases lifting the dialogue directly from the books.

Younger viewers may be spoiled by modern special effects, but the practical effects in this production are quite good for their time. The Aslan puppet, especially, is very well done (though I do still get a little giggle out of the people dressed up as Beavers; even as a child I thought they were rather funny-looking) and Reepicheep (played by Warwick Davis of ""Willow"" fame) is probably the best done of all the talking animals. The sea monster in ""Voyage of the Dawn Treader"" is a little bit silly looking, but the joy of seeing practical effects that are no longer used in mainstream filmmaking makes up for such drawbacks.

It's also great to see Tom Baker (the Fourth Doctor) as Puddleglum, and seeing Barbara Kellerman play all the different Witches really drives home the point that every Witch in the books, no matter what name she goes by, is actually Jadis.

My main issue with the series is the short shrift that's given to the ""Prince Caspian"" episodes. Much of the book (many of its deeper aspects, as well as the joy of the liberation of Narnia and its significance as a huge event in its history) is left out.

Aside from that, though, this is a truly delightful production, well suited for young children and for anyone with a deep and abiding love of the books.",1389312000,2,1605,4.741935483870968

1732321,5,B000069CFH,"In order to enjoy this set of films the most, we need to keep in mind that the writer C.S. Lewis had been an atheist for a long time, and then went through a religious conversion and became a devout Anglican. (Anglo Catholic if you prefer.)

We have 4 good movies in this set. (Though Part 2 is only 1 hour.)

The saga begins with the first movie ""The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe."" The 4 Pevensie children, (Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy) journey through a wardrobe into another world where it is always winter and never Christmas. An evil queen sees to that. Though the children learn from beavers who can talk, that Aslan the Lion will set all things right. (Aslan is obviously suppose to be Jesus.) Edmund (the brat of the 4) falters and finds himself sympathetic to the queen. (Possibly from feeling bullied by his older brother Peter.) But when Edmund sees the evil of the queen, he is moved into sympathy for her victims and begins his convincing path of repentance. We then have a surprisingly disturbing and convincing reenactment of 'The Passion.' But Good Friday is soon followed by Easter Sunday.

Truth be told, I prefer the old animated 70s ""The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe."" And I feel the animated one stays closer to the book. This version doesn't quite follow the book as closely. And while the more recent one had some great moments, it deviates from the book even further. But I digress.

(2) ""Prince Caspian"" While only an hour, this 2nd chapter is the last film where we will see the 4 children together. This film stays surprisingly close to the book. (Much closer than the more recent 'Prince Caspian.') The young Caspian has been warned that his usurping uncle Miraz has a son of his own, and plans to kill of Caspian. (Undoubtedly, C.S. Lewis was thinking of the fate poor King Edward V suffered at the hands of King Richard III.) Eventually, he is forced to seek help from our 4 heroes. Caspian faces those who would rather accomplish their ends by the use evil means. (Namely bringing back the evil queen Aslan defeated in the last film.) And we have the final fight between Miraz and Peter. Deviating from the book a little, we have a cliffhanger scene that gets us ready for Part 3.

(The more recent film ""Prince Caspian"" had some good moments. But I prefer this version, and even though it's much shorter, it follows the book more. I feel the recent film hurt the story with the dissension between Peter and Caspian, and also the romance between Caspian and Susan. (Neither of which are in the book I may add.)

(3) ""Voyage of the Dawn Treader"" This is the first film where Peter and Susan are gone. And Lucy and Edmund must venture in without their older brother and sister. But they are joined by Caspian, (who of course is now the king), and Reepicheep. The basic thing of this film is that Caspian is looking for 7 lords who fled the area during the reign of Miraz. Caspian must face not only slave traders, but a corrupt government, as well as a pool that will test most men. Eustace (the cousin of Lucy and Edmund) is an unwilling member of the group. He behaves much like Edmund did in Part 1. (A bit nasty to put it mildly.) But like Edmund, Eustace will have his chance at repentance. And Edmund has to be the older and forgiving male here.

Being honest, I actually liked the more recent film better. But this BBC film follows the book better.

(4) Onto the last film. Jill Pole finds herself picked on without mercy at school.  The reformed and much kinder Eustace  tries to help her, and they end up in Narnia. After they lose each other, Jill is met by Aslan himself who gives her 4 signs to remember.  She and Eustace find each other, they later find that Caspian has grown old, and they basically need to find Caspian's lost son and heir. They team up with a funny complainer Puddleglum. While some may laugh at his constant complaining, or even be annoyed by it, the truth is that Puddleglum rather often makes valid complaints. (Sometimes, the complainer in the group is right!)

They briefly get off track (something which Puddleglum protested, AND WAS RIGHT ABOUT). But they get back on track and enter into a hell that is more a place of sorrow than anything. And it's here that Puddleglum (the complainer of all people) knows that even though they are in this terrible place, they must keep their chins up because they know they are following Aslan's directions.

Without ruining this 4th chapter, I should point out that (just as he does in the book) Puddleglum has a really articulate passage that undoubtedly reflects C.S. Lewis's own turmoil as he went from being an atheist to being a Christian. He's an interesting character in that he complains to no end in ordinary situations. But in difficult situations, he keeps his head together, and really comes through for the group.

Some parts of the 4th book were snipped. (Probably for time.) But all in all, this 4th film follows the book rather well.

One deviation I agree with, is that this film set takes a beautiful passage from the end of Part 3, and moves it to the end of Part 4. (The last movie in the set.) As the saga is ending, Aslan tells us that he is in our world, but we have to learn to know him by the name he carries in our world.

All in all, this is an excellent 4 film package that stays really close to the books.",1382659200,,5355,4.482546201232033

My children are quite absorbed by both versions, so I disagree with the commentary that the effects of BBC were not enough. I found the BBC Aslan effectively stately and deserving of respect.

1732327,4,B000069CFH,"This version is far better than the more recent film adaptation, largely because the dialogue follows the books almost precisely (with the strange exception of the chief of police having an entirely different name).  There is a very good reason why the Chronicles of Narnia has been given to children to study for years, sometimes in a religious context, sometimes as a warning against drug use (comparison to the Turkish Delight), and sometimes just for being a generally strong classic.  I never cared much for Lord of the Rings; this series filled that hole just fine.  I admit to being a fan of ""epic"" stories such as the Odyssey, so I'm unfairly partial towards the Voyage of the Dawn Treader.

The plot is absolutely fantastic, but if you're looking for an action-packed adventure that is a feast for the eyes, look elsewhere.  The child actors are definitely older than those of the books, most notably Lucy, and the special effects are certainly dated.  However, they have a style I have seen in few other media.  For the most part, this could all be acted on stage, so theatre-lovers will definitely rejoice while movie-goers will be bored to tears.

Yes, the CGI is laughable at times, but honestly the story is so much better than the Disney ones, and the acting wins by a land slide.

I'm glad I've found it and can share this version with my own children. For all the low star reviews pull your heads out of the ground and stop giving a bad review for your own stupidity in not reading the description which CLEARLY states BBC version from the late 1980's to early 1990's. Did you really think that you can buy a box set of anything from Disney for $5? It's a GREAT box set to add to the collection especially if you remember it from the first time around.

1732342,4,B000069CFH,"Whether you like the new Disney Narnia movies or not, most people agree that their treatment of Lewis's stories are a peripheral interpretation at best, with high action/adventure budgets, mediocre characterization, and low concern for Lewis's paradigms and metaphors that were the entire basis for the stories to begin with.
But anyway...
This collection on the other hand is a low budget made for TV series of movies that tries hard to stay loyal to Lewis's vision. These movies were put out by the BBC in the late 80s and were usually shown on PBS here in the U.S. It includes the stories of The Lion the Witch and the Wardrode, Prince Caspian, Voyage of the Dawn Treader, and The Silver Chair. Each of these movie length productions have a simple charm that is aimed towards children, but is harmless fun for adults, as the Narnia stories were, and these try its best to capture the spirit of Lewis's stories and intentions, with characters and the fairytale quality of the original Narnia stories. In many ways it makes this early collection uniquely enjoyable when compared to the overdone Disney versions.

Just keep in mind that there was no CGI in these days, so it's a very theatrical series, with puppets, costumes and a bit of animation here and there.

My 4 yr old daughter absolutely LOVES this series, and honestly I admire it and enjoy it also. But if you are looking for mainstream, adult action adventure, look elswhere.  Narnia were children's stories and these productions are made for children with a sensitive, family friendly, and accurate goal in mind.",1373155200,7,1576,4.82962962962963

I have been sorely disappointed in the New Movie Adaptations and 2 out of the 3 make me angry.  I grant them that the special effects are better - but the screenplay(s) are not... inaccurate and unfaithful to the books.
The only one that's barely acceptable is the first one ""The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"", and that's the only NEW one that I own... the others are horrible!

However. There are a few ways that this is dated that I very much appreciate. The innocence of the actors--the children seem like real children who have seen none of the filth that is on television these days. The simplicity and lack of drama -- Lewis wrote simple children's stories, and this adaptation is as gentle and clean as the books. Finally, BBC kept very close to the text of the book. Is it the words of the book merely brought to screen? Far from, and there are many cringe-worthy scenes to attest to that. However, BBC stuck to the plot and characters the book gives, and all of the key elements are here, and no more.
So, yes, I laugh often when watching these, and as an adult can find them somewhat tedious. But I really appreciate them for what they are, and am glad to sometimes turn back to them and share them with my children.",1366761600,2,1079,4.510204081632653

1732380,4,B000069CFH,"I saw this series on PBS in California in the early 1990s. At the time, animation was crude by today's standards and one would watch this show in small installments over time on TVs that were small by today's standards. Seen in that light, and being the only long production of Narnia, I have some fond memories. Let's remember that this was produced using eighties technology and was never meant to be a blockbuster. That said, I will disagree with some who refer to it as a low budget production because it's very clear that money was spent on this series. Some of the sets and costumes are quite elaborate in The Silver Chair episodes and in general there were many actors, decorations and locations involved. Doing a full size lion in CGI would have been way too expensive. After a while you get used to the big puppet :-). On the other hand the animated creatures at a distance were way too crude for the time and I would have preferred old fashioned labor intensive splicing. My main objection looking at it now and watching all episodes at once is that it comes across like a school play! Thanks to my wife for that description. The kids are uneven in their performances and overact a lot. Also there is WAY too much dialog. After a while you feel like you are trudging through mud.  Again looking back I can see that this is a tactic to spread out a story that is shown in small infrequent installments.

1732393,3,B000069CFH,"One must admit that the visuals for this series have not aged well. However, this is THE version for fans of the books, as it captures Lewis' world in ways the Disney versions don't. Yes, people dressed in rubbery costumes look goofy, but after a little while the story sucks you in enough that you start ignoring the goofiness. Disney's versions are very pretty, but fail to capture the soul of the stories; no doubt this comes from wanting to distance the films from the spiritual themes and alter the story plot for drama's sake. Disney was clearly uncomfortable with parts of Narnia and that came across.

First of all, this version is closer to traditional theater than film; This will bug people who have issues with stage performances on film. Frankly, this is part of why I can ignore the outdated special effects: stage performances are held to a different standard than films. Yes, there's hamming but the Disney version isn't free of that either.

Second, Barbara IS The White Witch; Tilda was never convincing. The White Witch was not meant to be a blonde ""white"" person anyway, which any of the book fans will tell you. She's *paper* white with dark hair, tall and skinny, and thinks you are a bug. She's very dominating, assertive and aggressive. The Disney version just sort of glossed over TWW for no apparent reason, barely giving her screen time or making her convincing.

Aslan also suffers from this in the Disney version. Liam just doesn't convince me he's Aslan, probably because Disney was obviously super uncomfortable knowing Aslan was a god figure. The gutlessness shows, I'm sad to say. This version does a better job showing Aslan's personality, because yes, he has one.

Third, this version doesn't feel rushed. Disney started out right, but quickly fell off into standard epic fantasy, rushing through scenes without really showing what was going on with the characters. They spent too much time on the wrong parts of the movie and not enough on the core parts of the story in most cases.",1316476800,10,2018,4.806916426512968

1732397,4,B000069CFH,"This collection gives us the complete set of the BCC adaptations of the Narnia novels by C.S. Lewis in three miniseries of six episodes each, plus some extras. The first is ""The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"" (1988) about the city Wardrobe in the country Spare Room. The second (1989) brings together ""Prince Caspian"" (two episodes) and ""The Voyage of the Dawn Treader"" (four episodes). The third concerns ""The Silver Chair"" (1990).

The first adaptation sets the tone and the main characters. The tone is that of the novel and it is done for children. It sounds slightly nave at times because the storyteller is no longer constantly present and is not C.S. Lewis at all when there is a voice over. The regular ""we"" or ""this world"" or even the ""lions of Trafalgar Square"", meaning the real world, addressing the children's audience from an external adult point of view, reminding us of the fact that this is all a story, disappear and I think it is a loss.

The second adaptation makes two full novels into one story with a shift from the first one to the second that is at least abrupt and the packing up of the two in six episodes makes psychological details and descriptive details scanty. The story becomes a story line more than a fully developed story. The dragon though is a good nice creation, and that was necessary since it was an essential element and it had to fly properly, which is not the case with other flying animals, particularly Aslan. They are mostly simple and stiff. It keeps the story of the Dawn Treader the way it is in the novel and the end is the real end including the final pilgrimage of the mouse Reepicheep and the return of the children. It is a lot more respectful of the spirit of the story than the ending of the recent long feature that can be seen in cinemas.

The last adaptation gives details and the witch is a marvel though her becoming a serpent and being killed is less impressive since no green blood is shed and only Prince Rilian takes part in that execution. Eustace and Puddleglum taking part is nice but in the novel. The escape from the underground city does not try to explain the even deeper world of fire and incandescence into which all the gnomic slaves of the witch jump back happily. I miss the big celebration outside the hole from which they extract themselves, with fauns, dryads, satyrs and dwarves all dancing together. But well at least they keep the details of King Caspian X's death and his resurrection in Aslan's country though they soften the harsh commentary of C.S. Lewis on the English school system and the incompetence of school principals and inspectors, or MPs.

But these adaptations are interesting nevertheless. They insist on the fact these stories are not heroic fantasy but only children's literature. That is important because then the values that are presented in the films are pedagogical and not only entertaining. It is also important because it avoids, like the books, any subject that is not childlike or child-friendly. No love is wasted on anyone and even friendship is rather kept lily pure. No kissing, please, we're British.

Ut also defends the basic humanistic values of the books in fair contrast with the the world at the time or the literature of Lewis's time. A fair and clear condemnation of slavery and the exploitation of animals. But since the novel ""The Boy and His Horse"" is not there the rejection of political totalitarianism is absent. The allusion to the usurping uncle in Prince Caspian is by far not enough. Lewis's books are deeply committed to a democratic system. The films are far from being as clear as that. Calormenes are absent for example.

The films are also a lot less clear than the books that only people having some human blood can rule Narnia, including the White Witch of the first film who is a descendent of Adam, mixed with other bloods, including jinn blood from the sexual partner Adam had to procreate that line of descent. The absence of ""The Boy and His Horse"" also deprives us of the description of the four initial human kings and queens of Narnia, including Queen Suzan who is definitely not served very fairly.

But for me the main absence is in fact ""The Last Battle"" because it reveals two essential things in these seven novels: the idea that all worlds have a beginning and an end, including Narnia, that this end can only come from both inner strife, invasion and political manipulation of the masses that are shown as basically easy to manipulate into divisions or obeying absurd commands. The masses make history but only when some individuals and foreign forces join their efforts to conquer the minds and imagination of these masses.

This last novel was Lewis's testament and he showed in it that he did not really believe in democracy, i.e. the power of the people, for the people and by the people, because he did not trust any politicians but preferred an aristocratic monarchy in which kings and queens are of a different sort from the people and the masses. The main difference between Calormenes and Narnians is that The Calormene ""master"" (who is a Calormene by genetic birth) governs Calormenes as slaves, with a very narrow aristocracy, and the Narnian ""king (genetically different from all Narnians by at least some human genes) grants them freedom and diversity.

To avoid in anyway the bleak atmosphere of ""The Lord of the Rings"" or ""The Time Machine"" they produced a brave new world that lacked most of its pith and marrow. The series are interesting but only as entertainment for children and they lose the pedagogical dimension the books constantly keep.

1732411,5,B000069CFH,"Bringing the C.S. Lewis classic masterpiece ""The Chronicles of Narnia"" on the screen can be a daunting task for any director, producer and screenplay writer. However the BBC hit the nail on the head when they produced The Chronciles of Narnia for the Wonder Works television series. The series consists of screen adaptations of the following books, ""The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe, Prince Caspian, The Voyage of the Dawn Treader and The Silver Chair.""
Screen play writer Alan Seymore and director, Marilyn Fox were  faithful to the original works of Lewis and maintained the ""allegory of the Christian faith"" throughout. Geoffrey Burgon's composed a musical score which is pure enchantment. The actors captured the spirit of the Narian characters as they appear in the books. Jeffrey S. Perry's portrayal of Mr. Tumnus was brillant. The performances by child actors Richard Dempsey, Sophie Cook, Johnathan R. Scott and Sophie Wilcox were outstanding as the Pevensie children. Michael Aldridge's performance as Professor Kirk is certainly memorable. Barbara Kellerman was a delightfully over the top as the White Witch. Although the series was released in 1988, it has endured for over the past 22 years, becoming a classic in its own right.
The only negative comment I will make about the series is the BBC didn't finish the series.
It would be a wonderful treat for children of all ages if the BBC would consider finishing the project by making ""The Magician's Nephew, The Horse and His Boy and The Last Battle.""

4)  The overacting -- LOTS of exaggerated facial expressions -- very weird.

This series was the best so far to screen adaptation.  The animated version of the Lion, Witch, and the Wardrobe was pretty poor.  Then you had this adaptation which actually used humans and not entirely depended on animation.  Then you had Disney version which was mostly computer generated animation.  Which I guess for some people think equals quality entertainment.  Though, I rather watch this then the Disney any day of the week.  If you have a hard time watching a play then maybe this version is not for you.  It has the atmosphere of sort of like play rendition in which the props and the background.  Though, really they do superb job on the background,costumes, and etc.  Also, I think read awhile back how people thought the White Witch who is played by Barbara Kellerman as poor choice saying she is not pretty enough to be Jadis(White Witch).  I disagree entirely as a kid thought she was very beautiful and did a wonderful job as portraying Jadis.  Even today when I look back and watch the show again I still think Barbara was beautiful in this and did better than any one could of considering they were tight on money for production of this.  It's not like this was funded by major productions at the time it was shown on TV.

1732416,3,B000069CFH,"The Chronicles of Narnia series has finally made it to the big screens, with the third film ""The Voyage of the Dawn Treader"" coming out this winter.

But it isn't the first time that C.S. Lewis' classic fantasies have been adapted -- in the 1980s, the BBC made their own adaptation of the first four adventures of the Pevensies and their relatives. Some of the actors and special effects are frankly lacking, but mostly they are just solid storytelling.

""The Lion The Witch and the Wardrobe"" introduces us to the Pevensie kids, four teenagers who are staying in the country during World War II. But during a game of hide-and-seek, Lucy (Sophie Wilcox) hides in a wardrobe -- and finds that the back opens into a snowy forest land, populated by mythic creatures. It's the land of Narnia, where the Pevensies are destined to become kings and queens -- if they can destroy the evil White Witch (Barbara Kellerman), with the return of lion messiah Aslan (Ronald Pickup).

""Prince Caspian and the Voyage of the Dawn Treader"" takes us forward a few years -- and centuries in Narnia. Warlike humans have invaded Narnia and driven the talking animals, centaurs, dryads and others into hiding. But young Prince Caspian (Jean Marc Perret) believes in them, and joins them to defeat his usurping uncle Miraz. And the Pevensies are called from their world to help.

No sooner have Edmund (Jonathan R. Scott) and Lucy finished one adventure than other begins: while arguing with obnoxious cousin Eustace (David Thwaites), they are sucked into a painting and land beside the Narnian ship Dawn Treader. It also happens to be Caspian's ship. The three kids accompany the young king through a sea of horrors, dragons, gold springs, slavers and magicians, right to the edge of the world...

The newly reformed Eustance takes center stage in ""The Silver Chair."" At his chaotic school, he confides to a bullied classmate, Jill Pole (Camilla Power), about Narnia -- and the two of them find themselves whisked there by Aslan. Aslan gives them a quest: Find the aged Caspian's missing son Rilian (Richard Henders), who was seduced away by a malevolent witch. Eustace and Jill reluctantly go, and soon find themselves enmeshed in a plan to conquer all of Narnia.

The BBC has been known to make adaptations of countless books, so it's not surprising that they tried to tackle the Chronicles of Narnia. The result is a mixed bag, with some bad acting and sketchy CGI, but still a satisfying fantasy series with some truly creepy, uplifting or just interesting.

Expect a very faithful adaptation -- the BBC preserved virtually every character, most of the scenes, and all the Christian allegory of Lewis' books. As a result, there are some truly chilling and magical scenes, like Eustace's transformations and the owl conference. The settings are magnificent, especially the giant ""Dawn Treader"" and Caer Paravel.

Unfortunately, it does have its bad points, mostly in the tedium that is ""Prince Caspian."" Some of the special effects are quite dated, including some early blue-screen effects that are almost convincing, but not quite. Costumes are very very Dungeons and Dragons, especially Miraz and his army -- very Ye Olde Batmanne. And Aslan is played by a large and almost realistic puppet, except he looks like he has arthritis and large quantities of Botox.

The acting is a mixed bag -- Scott and Thwaites give the best performances, especially since they both play obnoxious little pains who have to learn the error of their ways. And there are loads of entertaining supporting characters, like Big Mick (I swear that's his name), both Caspians, Jeffrey Perry, and Warwick Davis (in owl and mouse costumes). The only sour notes are Wilcox and Kellerman; one whines, one cackles and screeches like a hammy banshee.

Those anticipating the return of Aslan and the Pevensies should check out the BBC adaptations -- while they have some big flaws, they are still entertaining enough to enjoy.",1281657600,4,3974,4.944527736131934
1732417,4,B000069CFH,"I ordered this set for my godson, age 7; he has seen numerous times the 'Hollywood' version of the Prince Caspian movie and has played countless times the PC game. We also bought all 7 books and we are slowly slowly reading them - not very easy as he has just learn to read.
At first, this set did not appeal to him as the relatively recent high tech production of Prince Caspian. Kids today are spoiled with all the state of the art effects they are exposed to. He thought that Asslan moved his mouth not in line with the sounds and some of the animal-figures were not cute/successful enough and rather unattractive. He also felt that Lucy was 'too fat' and smiled too much! Suzan was also not attractive enough compared to the one he 'met' already!
However, he sat on the sofa and glued himself to the screen - and forced me to do the same, as I had to be tranlating from English to Greek - and watched the entire set in one go (afternoon/evening......)! needless to say I do not want to watch another Narnia movie for a long time!

That being said.. The Stage has not died out in the world yet! There is still something of value to it.
It sticks fairly closely to the lines in the book. A few are snipped for time reasons.
The biggest lack is really that of a missing narrator. For some obscure reason, lines that are clearly ""narrated"" in the book, have been shoe-horned into speaking lines by the actors.

Oddly, the other large let-down I had, was that the White Witch was supposed to be stunningly beautiful in the book; but in this film, was somewhat ugly. So it does not show the attraction of evil.

Other than that, its still a fairly good film set for children 10 and under, who aren't too jaded by expecting hollywood level special effects.",1271635200,2,1009,4.56353591160221

Instead of Lucy, Edmund, and Eustace discussing and arguing about the existence of Narnia and then discussing the increasingly more realistic painting, you hear the symblance of an arguement as they are immediatly dragged into the painting with no explanation.  I'm glad they were so cheap else I would return them.  There is no way to know if this version is all that exists of the BBC version I remember.

1732421,4,B000069CFH,"BBC TV drama series is noted as faithful adaptation of the novel though the special effects particularly animation were not well organized. It's sometimes painful to see the stuffed human actors which might be a letdown even for the eyes of the children. But the episodes of ""Voyage of Dawn Trader"" and ""Silver Chair"" are well produced and are thrilling. Silver Chair in particular, the quest lies more in the characters mindset and challenging even for readers and viewers.

1 The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe
There aren't so much striking difference between this TV version and recent film version. TV series may seem poor in the use of animation and special effects. Just be patient and view it to remember what the story was like before getting into the later episodes.

2 Price Caspian: TV version may seem too brief compared to the film one. But in this series Caspian is a boy about the age of Susan, Peter, Edmund and Lucy. I still don't see why the movie version changed the setting as an adult Prince.

3 The Voyage of Dawn Treader
That's very imteresting story, full of adventures visitng various unique islands. I cannot wait to see the coming 20 century fox version due around next year.

4 Silver Chair
It's another of great adventure story. The lead role for this story seems to be Jill Pole, performed by Camilla Power, now one of the major British Actresses. If Century Fox pursue the film adaptation who will play the role of Jill Pole may be the key. The Ending part reminds me of 1984 film version of Neverending Story.

Even the BBC series could not cover THE LAST BATTLE the last of the Narnia series because it would be too difficult to show it on the film at that time. Now techonological deadlock might be eased but I doubt the film will see the light of day.

The best thing about this production is its modesty.  While the characters are as well drawn as in the original novels, the entire story unfolds without ostentation.  Really a lovely balance.

My kids have watched this version for years.  After having seen the dazzling Disney versions, they are now more critical of the cheaper effects in the BBC version.  Nonetheless, they still watch this, discussing its accuracy vis-a-vis the novel, and get enveloped in the story, as do I.  That is a sincere and real success.

1732426,4,B000069CFH,"This series is definitely not like the new movies recently made, but the charm of the stories still come through. Over all I like this series. There a few things that not so great. What is bad? Well in absence of CGI realistic animals they take humans and put them in animal costumes. Sometimes it actually adds charm to the work. The characters of Mr. Beaver and Reepicheep work well with this method. They chose fine actors who fit the parts. Other times the results are disastrous. The acting of the leader of the White Witch's secret police, by the name Morgrim, was absolutely disastrous. There was a scene where Peter was reading a letter left by Morgrim saying how Mr. Tumnus was arrested for treason and it was read where we see the face of Morgrim and hear Morgrim reciting what was in the letter even though Peter was supposedly reading it. At the end of the letter Morgrim roars. This was OH SO BAD!!!! Through the Wardrobe story when portraying the wolves they cut between real dogs and men (walking on two legs I might add) in wolves costumes. This, in my opinion, doesn't really work. They also mixed cartoon animation with live actors (similar to Mary Poppins or Pete's Dragon kind of thing) I feel like this approach makes it harder to take the work seriously. In all fairness though, this was an ambitious undertaking to make these movies and you work with what you've got. They had a lot of creatures that needed to be used in the stories and if this is all you've got, then fine. Okay, that was my take on mostly the first story.

The other stories namely - Prince Caspian, Dawn Treader and Silver Chair. I overall have very little complaints about. The actor playing Reepicheep does such a great job that I almost don't mind that it's an actor in cheezy costume. One thing I thought could've been better was that Aslan's voice was not very powerful. The actor sounded like he had difficulty saying his lines. Sometimes he just sounded creepy which was definitely not the goal.

In the Silver chair I liked the choice of actor for the character of Puddleglum; he was ideal. My only complaint with the way they did it was that in the book, Puddleglum had extra large feet, but in this movie he did not. I guess it would have made making the movie too difficult for them.

Anyway, even with its faults I feel it captures the heart of the Narnia books. What truly makes these Narnia stories so great is the Christian metaphor of Aslan as the Christ figure. I also am glad that they included in the film where Aslan said he knew the children in Narnia so they could learn his name in their world and better understand Him there. That is the purpose of these stories, is to interest children and even adults for that matter, in knowing Him (Jesus) and see him not just as an historical figure, but as a personal savior.

I just wish they could have made a movie of ""The Last Battle"" in this series which, I think, is the best story of all of them.",1245974400,,2961,4.447513812154696

1732428,5,B000069CFH,"The ""3 disk set"" contains 4 of the, I believe 5 stories by C.S. Lewis.  though lion witch wardrobe is a bit on the cheesy side ""never forget to wipe your sword"" the rest of the stories are pretty good-superb.  Baker is the best at ""puddleglumb"" and not because I asscoiciate him as Dr. Who, in fact, I forgot he was Dr. Who and saw only the pathetic, yet suprisingly courageous Puddleglumb in his ridiculous banter hilarity for the young, youthfully old, and maybe the old and childish too.  That said, I think the main central roles had a very good choice of actors from Lucy, who some people don't like because of her buck teeth but it is a prostetic, and even if it weren't, this little girl(Sophie Wilcox) is a good actress for three movies(a long time for a little girl).  Some have dumbly asked(on IMDB) how she lost her crooked teeth, it is easy to answer for anyone with 1/4 a brain and it was part of her character to ""not be as pretty as Susan, explained well in ""Dawn Treader"" where, odviously, she had strait teeth, so what?  Eustus(actor's last name unusual) and Jill Pole(Camilla Power) were surprising as well, espcially Camilla Power who performed as good as any adult! If ""Last Battle"" had been made(and why was it not??!) David Thawties???(if spelled correctly) would have also been through 3 films! (Power 2) I always wonderd who would play ""Jill Pole"" in the new 2011 movie and have suggested Decoda Fanning since these two(Eustus and Jill) are not physical characters as Edmund, Susan, and Peter, but brain users(well, as Dr. Who) Fanning would be perfect for the reason also that she is simply a superb actress for any age group! She would be a good performer for a believable Jill Pole as well. Caspian was portrayed by three actors, most notably in Dawn Treader, the young adult actor(Samual West) who sounded almost identical(in voice) to Prentis Handcock in every way from the gravely shouting to throaty normal tone of voice though West looked only 20 his voice was more mature, and if you closed your eyes you'd think it was Prentis Handcock when, in fact, it is not. Jean-Mare Perret(pronounced Peray as in Chevrolet I am thinking) was the youngest Caspian, his voice had changed from the Prince Caspian story to the end of Silver chair indicating much time had passed in the filming of these movies, it was over a year, 1989-90 I believe.  Peter Wolfe was also in this(from Dr. Who: Sunmakers) as Cornilious I recognised his voice and mannerisms in Cornileous instantly from the bald wheelchair riding reptile-humanoid ""Company Overseer"" from Doctor Who to the bearded dark dwarvan tutor here in ""Caspian"". Prince Rilin(or jokingly Rittlin) is portrayed by Richard Henders(sounds a bit like the actor who portrayed Christ in the ""Martian Chronicles"" in 1980) and the Green Lady/Ice Queen(Barbra Kellermann) were also played by good theatrical quality actors. I am assuming Barbra Kellermann's role as both the Ice Queen and the Lady means they are one in the same, never made clear to one who has not read the books.  The effects were horrid, especially the ""talking' animals the raccoon(with her head screwed on backwards) was the most annoying, not Lucy's teeth! The worst, sadly The Lion God-king himself, Aslin, who was miss voiced and looked like a stuffed toy with flat toned speaking.(Liam Neeson does better as the ""voice of God"", meaning Aslin the Lion King.) The BBC version of him is very unconvicning.  The director of the new movie said in the DVD extras there he was ""reluctant to work again with talking animals"" probably because he did not realise how beleivable they could be(and are not here) until he himself tried it in the new Prince Caspian movie(and they were!!!).  Lewis's step son, the co producer of the new films is also on this DVD speaking in the ""bookworm"" reflection of C.S. Lewis.  He also narrates the new Caspian DVD's Extra #2, ""character section"" which I like.  If you have watched the new films(and there will be more in the future) do not be too put off by this 1989 production, it was made long before CGI and is just as good, especially if you were old enough to have watched it IN 1989/90 when these were crafted.  Back then I thought it was great, despite being shot in ""video"" and not film a no no in on location (usually).The New Zealand-like outdoor scenes near the ""Ettins"" in ""Silver Chair"" where Eustes, Jill, and Puddleglumb traversed/conversed/transacted and so forth looked great in wide shot video!  Location environmental sound was a nice little touch, not some big music and explosions production # or what not as in CGI B.S. where environmental ambeince would now days be totally absent in place of the odvious for morons of ""now"" Pre-CGI Lucas days were best! This BBC non-disney non francise production. For example, in this version of ""The Lion The Witch and The wardrobe"", the sound the snow makes when it falls as Peter, Susan, and Lucy walk toward the Beaver's home in the forest. Or Edmund when the witch confronts him and the winter wind whisps around her tossles(in sound) giving the feel of cold.(with a good RMS speaker set, even in 2.0. as this is formatted it is descernable to the appriciating ear.)  Though the visual FX were shoddy at best, the locations(and in cases the ambience and lovely music) and the acting were what made these films!  The Dawn Treader ocean scenes wernt' half bad either!  I can't wait for that movie and I am to assume many video game spin-off ideas about ""pirates"" partaining to the Dawn treader! I cannot IMAGIN why they didn't do the last story of the Chronicles.  I am to assume the ""DVD Enhanced"" edition to this is a clearer picture, though i do hope CGI ""edits"" and ""Add-in junk"" doesn't mosh up a classic nostalgia as it did in Doctor Who 5 doctors and Lucas Star Bores which was an insult to any real person, son of Adam, daughter of Eve or whatnot.",1242604800,,5885,4.703595724003887

1732432,4,B000069CFH,"These were filmed (videotaped, I think) for TV by the BBC in the late 80's, so expect some effects to be dated. I had these several years ago on VHS, and they seemed longer and seemed to follow the stories more point-by-point than this edition does. So it seems to have been edited down somewhat. The original VHS came in two-tape sets at 174 minutes each, so all three were 522 minutes long. This comes in with less minutes, so they appear to have been abridged for some reason.

If you have read the books and like a version truer to the original stories, you will probably like these DVDs. You will especially like these if you have been annoyed by the changes, additions and deletions that were done in the feature films. For instance, if you want to see the witch run away in a very undignified manner in ""The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe"" after Aslan roars at her for asking how can she know he will keep the bargain, you will find that here. If you want to see the witch carried away calmly in a litter/sedan chair, then see the feature film. If you want a version where the monsters and bad guys won't give your preschoolers nightmares, then this BBC version is probably for you. Be aware that these stories move slowly, since they do attempt to cover as many details from the actual books as possible.

If you haven't read the books or don't care about changes to the story to make it more ""dramatic"" and ""movie-like,"" then skip these and see the more recent feature films.

Since their original airing the films have become family favorites but with Walt Disney Studios creating their own epic adaptations, will these low budget classics be outdone? I don't believe they will. Although this series lacks the big budget and special effects of Disney's filmed versions, these films retain the whimsy and innocence of the books. Yes, the costumes, set design and props may seem like those found in a school production. And yes, most of us could create more realistic special effects on our home computers. However, unlike Disney's films, this series remained faithful to Lewis' text and only made departures for budgetary reasons. Overall this series still enchants children as well as adults. But I would recommend showing these movies to your children before the Disney versions. My reasons for suggesting this are: (1.) these films are closer to the spirit of Lewis' stories and therefore a better representation of the moral values that Lewis was trying to instill, and (2.) rather than relying on action sequences this series focuses on storytelling, and (3.) by showing these films first it will build anticipation for the upcoming Disney films but also introduce people to the Narnia stories and their mythical cosmology.

The four films included in this three-disc set are:

The Lion, the Witch, & the Wardrobe - 1988
Four siblings, Peter, Susan, Lucy and Edmund, are sent to the countryside home of Prof. Kirke while London is being raided during WWII. During their exploration of Prof. Kirke's house, Lucy enters a wardrobe and is transported to a magical world that is held under an evil enchantment. A witch has cast a spell on Narnia that makes it always winter but never Christmas. Soon all four children make their way through the wardrobe and into Narnia, where they befriend mythological creatures and talking beasts. The children learn of a prophecy that states that they are to battle the witch's army and restore Narnia to its former glory and they learn of Aslan, the messianic lion-king of Narnia.

Prince Caspian - 1989
A year has passed for Peter, Susan, Edmund and Lucy since their adventures in Narnia came to an end. But Prince Caspian, whose evil uncle has usurped the throne, summons the children back into that magical world. The four children unite with Caspian and his rebel army and prepare to do battle with Caspian's uncle, King Miraz.

The Voyage of the Dawn Treader - 1989
Edmund, Lucy and their cousin, Eustace are sent to Narnia so that they can help Caspian search for seven missing Narnian lords, who were banished by King Miraz. On their voyages they are taken as slaves, must do battle with a giant sea serpent, survive a deadly storm, and perhaps even sail beyond the very ends of the Earth, into Aslan's country.

The Silver Chair - 1990
Eustace and his schoolmate, Jill travel to Narnia where Aslan assigns them the task of finding lost Prince Rilian, King Caspian's son and rightful heir to the throne. Puddleglum, a Marshwiggle with a tendency to be pessimistic, joins them on their mission. Together they encounter all sorts of dangers including barbaric giants, a tyrannical sorceress and a clan of hideous subterranean creatures who serve the sorceress.

The greatest flaw of this series, other than the production value, is the acting. Sophie Wilcox who plays Lucy is endlessly whining and Barbara Kellerman is so manic and over-the-top that I felt she would benefit from medication. However, both of these performers are redeemed by the many talented actors who surround them. The actors who portray the talking animals are particularly good and Ronald Pickup who voices Aslan makes the oversized stuffed animal of a puppet believable.

The special features include a poster, a booklet with interesting facts about C.S. Lewis and the Narnia books, a recipe for Turkish Delight, an excerpt from the program The Bookworm, trivia games and photo galleries.",1217376000,,4160,5.2092675635276535

1732445,4,B000069CFH,"Before Disney, there was BBC . . .

Perhaps viewers should take into consideration the level of technical know-how available to studios at a given period in cinematographic history before criticizing special effects.  BBC did a fantastic job with what they had to work with.  This was filmed in the late '80s. Remember, ILM (Industrial Light & Magic) had just wrapped up ""Willow"" and ""The Hunt for Red October."" Most people, if they even owned a computer, had an 8086 or a 286 with anywhere from a 4mhz to 16mhz (in turbo mode) and 1mb to 2mb of RAM. Anybody remember MS-DOS 5.1 and WordPerfect 5.1? How about 40mb hard drives, high density floppy disks with 1.2mb or 1.44mb capacities, and Double Space technology? ILM had not even invented yet a lot of what we take for granted now.  Blue screens and costumes were the best BBC could do.

The acting wasn't the best, but then I watch something for the story, not the acting.  Some of the characters were not interpreted the same way I would have based on my readings in Lewis, but that is to be expected.

The series is as faithful as possible to the books, and no doubt that is where some of the dissatisfaction comes into play.  There are some parts that seem to drag.  This is no fault of the actors.  There are always going to be issues when taking a book and translating it directly to the screen.  I am impressed they did as fine a job as they did.

I am not going to give any lengthy descriptions.  Keep reading other reviews and you will get that.  Call this a perspective review if you wish.

But it isn't the first time that C.S. Lewis' classic fantasies have been adapted -- in the 1980s, the BBC made their own adaptation of the first four adventures of the Pevensies and their relatives. Some of the actors and special effects are frankly lacking, but mostly they are just solid storytelling.

""The Lion The Witch and the Wardrobe"" introduces us to the Pevensie kids, four teenagers who are staying in the country during World War II. But during a game of hide-and-seek, Lucy (Sophie Wilcox) hides in a wardrobe -- and finds that the back opens into a snowy forest land, populated by mythic creatures. It's the land of Narnia, where the Pevensies are destined to become kings and queens -- if they can destroy the evil White Witch (Barbara Kellerman), with the return of lion messiah Aslan (Ronald Pickup).

""Prince Caspian and the Voyage of the Dawn Treader"" takes us forward a few years -- and centuries in Narnia. Warlike humans have invaded Narnia and driven the talking animals, centaurs, dryads and others into hiding. But young Prince Caspian (Jean Marc Perret) believes in them, and joins them to defeat his usurping uncle Miraz. And the Pevensies are called from their world to help.

No sooner have Edmund (Jonathan R. Scott) and Lucy finished one adventure than other begins: while arguing with obnoxious cousin Eustace (David Thwaites), they are sucked into a painting and land beside the Narnian ship Dawn Treader. It also happens to be Caspian's ship. The three kids accompany the young king through a sea of horrors, dragons, gold springs, slavers and magicians, right to the edge of the world...

The newly reformed Eustance takes center stage in ""The Silver Chair."" At his chaotic school, he confides to a bullied classmate, Jill Pole (Camilla Power), about Narnia -- and the two of them find themselves whisked there by Aslan. Aslan gives them a quest: Find the aged Caspian's missing son Rilian (Richard Henders), who was seduced away by a malevolent witch. Eustace and Jill reluctantly go, and soon find themselves enmeshed in a plan to conquer all of Narnia.

The BBC has been known to make adaptations of countless books, so it's not surprising that they tried to tackle the Chronicles of Narnia. The result is a mixed bag, with some bad acting and sketchy CGI, but still a satisfying fantasy series with some truly creepy, uplifting or just interesting.

Expect a very faithful adaptation -- the BBC preserved virtually every character, most of the scenes, and all the Christian allegory of Lewis' books. As a result, there are some truly chilling and magical scenes, like Eustace's transformations and the owl conference. The settings are magnificent, especially the giant ""Dawn Treader"" and Caer Paravel.

Unfortunately, it does have its bad points, mostly in the tedium that is ""Prince Caspian."" Some of the special effects are quite dated, including some early blue-screen effects that are almost convincing, but not quite. Costumes are very very Dungeons and Dragons, especially Miraz and his army -- very Ye Olde Batmanne. And Aslan is played by a large and almost realistic puppet, except he looks like he has arthritis and large quantities of Botox.

The acting is a mixed bag -- Scott and Thwaites give the best performances, especially since they both play obnoxious little pains who have to learn the error of their ways. And there are loads of entertaining supporting characters, like Big Mick (I swear that's his name), both Caspians, Jeffrey Perry, and Warwick Davis (in owl and mouse costumes). The only sour notes are Wilcox and Kellerman; one whines, one cackles and screeches like a hammy banshee.

Those anticipating the return of Aslan and the Pevensies should check out the BBC adaptations -- while they have some big flaws, they are still entertaining enough to enjoy.",1201305600,17,3961,4.969788519637462

1732457,4,B000069CFH,"This BBC TV series is well worth your viewing.  Although there isn't much technology in it as is in the more recent Disney films, it is much more accurate to the books.  Only four of the seven books were adapted into this production and Prince Caspian was shortened to only about an hour.  But the other three-- The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe; Voyage of the Dawn Treader; and The Silver Chair-- contain much of the original stories with even much of the books' dialog preserved in the script.  The acting isn't too bad either-- the children playing the roles of Peter, Susan, Edmund, are quite good and there is a memorable performance by Tom Baker as Puddleglum in The Silver Chair.  Barbara Kellerman is formidable (though perhaps a little overdone) as the White Witch and the queen of the underground realm.

If you would rather have an accurate adaptation of the story than a movie with expensive technology this DVD set will be to your liking.

1732463,1,B000069CFH,"Well if you saw the first movie you saw the original so I'll give it a star for being a good adaptation. I couldn't sit five minutes without fast forwarding. The child actor in this movie was to fat for the part and at the same time the only decent actor in the movie. The animation was really unimaginative (raptor/chicken anyone or how bout clichd ghosts) and I'm betting the next two Narnia movies (if they come out) will be just as closely adapted to the screen. And it annoys me that the first book is still completely ignored.

Anyways unless you've seen this in your childhood stay away unless your like me and get a good laugh out of bad effects and spliced in animation. I don't care what year it was made, it's dry, dull, and the actors are wood. So unless you have allot of nostalgia for something like this I'd stay away, thank god for computer animation and save your money to buy a ticket to ""Pan's Labyrinth"" when it comes out because I doubt a dark R rated fantasy will get the atention it deserves and will make me ill.",1165536000,6,1036,4.312820512820513
1732464,5,B000069CFH,"Yes, the visual effects are primitive, but the production is so thoughtful and earnest that it hardly matters.  I mean the BBC in the late '80's didn't have the technology for good visual effects.  What did you expect?

Also, what's not to like about the casting?  The only character I can think of who was arguably better cast in the new movie was Lucy, but BOTH Lucys were extraordinary child actresses. There are people saying Lucy doesn't look the part in this adaptation... true, she's not movie-star cute, but does she have to be? I think she looks a little too grown up, but she acts the part so well you almost don't notice. The other children are superbly cast. They chose a perfect Susan, better cast than the Susan in the new version (although she wasn't bad). Peter is also a lot better in this... I don't think the 2005 filmmakers got a handle on his quite uniquely British character.

But enough of defending this TV adaptation. The makers of the new movie should be the ones on the defensive. There are aspects of this series that the new movie can't even come near. The acting is brilliant and nuanced; all the more impressive coming from children. The White Witch may have over-acted a bit in this TV version, but Tilda Swinton has such a pared-down part in the new movie, it's hard to argue with any certainty that her understated performance was any better. The pacing is perfect in the BBC version.  You don't see any of the maudlin crap that Disney puts into the new version, like the ten-minute scene of the kids boarding the train in London and crying as they leave their mummy. It's faithful to the books, not omitting or (what's more annoying) ADDING anything in the plot.  At over two hours, the Disney movie could have included most of the book's dialog and dispensed with the overdone, overlong CGI battle scenes, and with adding its own minor characters (ex: the fox).

The music in this adaptation is also SUPERB.  It's some of the best theme music I've ever heard for a small- or big-screen production.

You can say the battle scenes were more believeable in the new one, and that the witch's CGI army beats the embarrassing cut-and-paste animations, and costumed actor animals seen in the BBC adaptation. But NOWHERE does the movie create the level of suspense you see in Peter's fight with the wolf in the BBC adaptation. Yes, the wolf was obviously an actor in a costume. But seeing him toss Peter around, and with Peter looking like he was really getting hurt and genuinely scared, it was an incredibly frightening and well-directed scene.

Also, I have nothing bad to say about Liam Neeson, but I couldn't bring myself to believe an Aslan with an American accent in the new version.  Neeson has been in the U.S. a long time, and he does an American accent better than an Englih one.  I guess the filmmakers thought it would be too ridiculous to have an Irish-sounding Aslan, so they directed him to sound American, and frankly, it doesnt' work.  Ronald Pickup's voice makes much more sense for this part.

I suppose if you didn't know what to expect, the shoddy special effects in this version might ruin it for you. But if you appreciate the ways this adaptation beats the movie, you'll be able to see past the visual effects, and you'll be glad you took the time.  Makes me wish the BBC directors had just had the same CGI technology to use when they made this... with better visuals, it would be perfect.",1164499200,13,3443,4.592169657422512
1732465,5,B000069CFH,"I remember watching this British production of The Chronicles of Narnia on the Disney Channel as a pre-teen in the 90's.  It remains my preferred choice for a film adaptation of Narnia.  It doesn't have the flash and pageantry of the recent major motion picture, but it has heart and is much closer in capturing the essence of the novels.  (It's almost similar to how, I feel, A&E's Pride and Prejudice miniseries is superior to the recent P&P movie--it let's the author's story do the talking.)

Being British and a lower budget production, don't expect state-of-the-art special effects or a Howard Shore soundtrack (complete with Enya).  The goal of this production is simply to tell Lewis' story well and to accomplish on film what the author accomplished on paper.  It's goal isn't to razzle-dazzle, but it is charming nonetheless.  The lack of CGI will take a little getting used to, but, given the chance, I believe most people will find this version endearing and well done.

The great thing with the lack of cutting edge special effects is that it forces the story to focus on interpersonal relationships.  It may be subdued, but it doesn't mean it's boring.  Subtlety is a good thing when a film's focus is on the characters themselves.  And, just because it is more subtle than the movie doesn't mean that it is not entertaining.  It was immensely entertaining for me when I was eleven years old, and watching it was what turned me onto the books.  The running time for the films are also longer, so, of course, it had the liberty to flesh out the story more than the movies.

While I did enjoy the movie, it isn't something that I would watch again.  This series, though, is something I still watch over a decade after first seeing it.  Unless you have a child who can't sit still very long or gets bored without a lot of Hollywood-style action, I recommend showing them this version first before the movie.  It encourages its viewers to use their own imagination in imagining Narnia, whereas the movie's special effects are so spectacular that it requires little on the part of the viewer to contribute to the enjoyment of the film.

This film series has a special place in my heart and is completely suitable for children, as it is easier on the action than its major motion picture counterpart.",1163808000,6,2308,4.699004975124378
1732466,4,B000069CFH,"With all the other reviews of this set giving useful reviews, the only thing I would like to add is this:  The new set of the Chronicles of Narnia now coming out (the first was the 'Lion, Witch, and the Wardrobe,' 2005; 'Prince Caspian' is scheduled for 2008) has much better special effects than this BBC set.  However, this BBC set is much more complete storywise (e.g. the 2005 version is about 35 minutes shorter than the BBC version of the same story).

If you are primarily interested in the story, then this BBC version is preferred; if you want excitement and 'flashy' special effects, then the 2005 version is preferred.  Personally, I found the special effects to be distracting from the story in the 2005 movie.  Children would probably find some of the characters in the 2005 version to be more frightening than in this set, where most of the animal characters are obviously humans made up to look like a beaver or monster, etc.

Another consideration for parents who want their children to become familiar with the Chronicles of Narnia is if their children will still be as interested in the stories in 2008 and beyond.  It might be better to show this set now to older children because by the time the rest of the new set of movies come out they may be well into their teens and no longer interested.

Finally, this BBC set was done in conjunction with the PBS Wonderworks stories for families, and every Wonderworks movie I've reviewed has been a wonderful, family-friendly and uplifting story.  This set maintains that standard.  If you like this set, you have 69 more Wonderworks programs you can watch!

This series is a bit like watching a Jim Henson movie, not that it is a comedy, but for the costumes the actors like Aslan, and Reep-Cheep wear.

It is also much more small child friendly than the more recent versions that have been made of it, without speaking down to them. That being said, all the adults in this family love them too. A great set of movies to start a discussion with kids about right and wrong choices.

1732488,5,B000069CFH,"Let us begin by agreeing that computer-generated images have both added to and taken from filmmaking, in ways similar to the effect performance-enhancing drugs have had on sports.  We might thrill at the modern athlete who hits the ball out of the park, but we still wonder how he'd compare to Babe Ruth.

This 1980s-era BBC production is in many ways superior to the more recent cinematic version of Lewis' great fantasy; in particular, a number of elements, both major and minute, which are altered or removed in the film are faithfully represented in the BBC video Chronicles.  This is no unimportant detail -- the Chronicles of Narnia is first and foremost a story; anything C.S. Lewis included is probably significant and ought not to be left out or redefined at the whim of a Director.  In producing these versions of four of the seven Chronicles the BBC was careful to tell the story without incautiously rewriting it.

The technology of the 1980s, and the budget constraints upon the BBC, do play their own role in these productions, of course.  In particular, the recent film's seamless blurring of the line between humans and talking animals is simply beyond what could be done in the BBC version.  While Aslan is very nearly equally realized in both the Disney and BBC productions, and the BBC's Tumnus is in some ways superior to (though certainly not ""better than"") Disney's, other characters do not fare as well.  Beaver and his wife are almost embarassingly silly in the BBC version, and Maugrim's transitions border on the painful.  Some of the peripheral characters are portrayed by beautifully but unrealistically drawn animations, and most of the ""magic"" could be duplicated or bettered today by a tenth-grade film class.

Nevertheless, these are matters not of substance but of presentation; the stories themselves are accurately presented in convincing settings by actors who range from highly competent to superbly skilled.  Backgrounds and scenery are very well done, both interior and exterior, and distracting elements, such as those mentioned above, are kept to a minimum.  The real, the nearly-real and the purely animated are delicately balanced.

The 3 disk set reviewed presents four of the Chronicles: ""The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe;"" ""Prince Caspian;"" ""The Voyage of the Dawn Treader;"" and ""The Silver Chair.""  Also included are a fascinating film about C.S. Lewis from the BBC's ""Bookworm"" TV magazine, trivia games, numerous stills from the productions and, perhaps most intriguing, a detailed recipe for Turkish Delight.

This set is best enjoyed by true lovers of C.S. Lewis and of the Chronicles, but those who fit that description would be glad to own it.  My only true regret is that the missing Chronicles were not produced, but perhaps if this set is purchased in sufficient numbers that omission could eventually be corrected as well.

1732489,5,B000069CFH,"Lewis' world of Narnia produces wonder in its readers (or in this case watchers). If you love the Narnia stories then you will probably enjoy watching these movies. They are not very similar to the new version of the Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe that Disney just released in 2005, but they have their own strengths. These old editions are much closer to Lewis' story than the new edition, such as the closeness in age of the four children. But the special effects were not even close to what the movie industry is capable of today. For example, Aslan is a large robot and when he speaks his mouth does not move in sync with what he is saying. Some of the mythical creatures are cartoons instead of real people like the rest of the movie. But they are extremely enjoyalbe for me.

1732510,4,B000069CFH,"The full set of The Chronicles of Narnia contains seven fairy tales about a world other than our own where a lion named Aslan serves as the voice of wisdom, goodness and power. The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe was the first written and it introduces us to four children: Lucy, Edmund, Susan and Peter. The four siblings have a most extraordinary adventure when they travel to a different world called Narnia through a large wardrobe in a room in a large country estate outside London where they've been sent for safety during World War II. They meet some powerful characters, a host of talking animals, and become instrumental in the overthrow of the wicked White Witch who has caused a hundred years of winter in Narnia (but no Christmas). Eventually the children return home. Later they (or some of them, at least) return to Narnia for further adventures in the stories of Prince Caspian, The Voyage of the Dawn Treader, and The Silver Chair. Other children experience Narnia as well in The Horse and His Boy and The Magician's Nephew, until the enchanted land comes to an end in The Last Battle.

In this BBC production of 1988 and 1990, we experience four of the seven stories: The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe; Prince Caspian; The Voyage of the Dawn Treader; and The Silver Chair. I have no idea why the production stopped there. I would've liked to see all seven. At any rate, this production is certainly not the same as modern technology makes possible today, but it is well done for its time. There are three DVD's, each over two-and-a-half hours long. Prince Caspian and The Voyage of the Dawn Treader share one disc. PC was shortened, but voyage is long-g-g-g. I would suggest that if one wants young children to view the productions, that each disc be viewed over two or three sittings or start the disc early in the day and spread it out.

I do enjoy this production with its simple, dated technology. The actors do a good job and I found, as I watched it the first time, that the characterizations grew on me. You may even recognize a face or two. There is a quiz at the end of each story and the usual scene selection opportunities. All-in-all, it's a good set to have in one's DVD library.

I had already read the books and my parents and I found this set on VHS in the local library. I think I had them rent them out every other week, I loved them so much. I saw the new movie, and yes, it doesn't compare on any sort of special effects or action standards, and if that is what you or your child needs to hold their attention then, no, these aren't for you. If you can deal with the cheesy animation though, and are looking for the most accurate rendition of the books (I was somewhat dissapointed with the new movie's character development), these are a great buy. I plan on showing them to all of my young cousins and friend's children! And, yes, I do plan on buying the new movie as well, I mean, I'm  Narnia fan. And no, I'm not Christian, and I wouldn't buy these or any Narnia tale because you think it will be a good religious read either, buy it because it's an enjoyable, fantastical tale.... I feel like with this new movie too many people are looking at this as a tale about Jesus when really it's not, it's a tale about sacrifice and courage, and children and balance. Really now. He didn't write the books about or for Christianity, he wrote them to appease his own inner child.

The BBC version of the books more accuratly follows the story, and actually manages to bring the emotions in the book to life.  It has a wonderful story, for either your religious or not religious aspects.

If your after vibrant special effects, current hollywood standards, or a short movie, then no: The BBC version is not for you.

I love the story line and they seem to stay true to the books from what i can remember (its been awhile since i saw these) If you want to see the books come to live go see the walden media production version. Huge budget and much much better.

Kids might like this though just because it is a good story. My sister loves this but i am a computer person and a stickler for good special effects. I would rent these rather then buy them.

As noted in other reviews, these are not a big budget production.  The special effects are non-existent/basic.

They are a step up production wise from the Shelly Duval series of fairy tales (also stage play style), which my children and I also enjoy.

My youngest daughter (age 5) didn't find these overly frightening (the scene where the white witch descends upon Aslan to take his life is an exception).

I enjoyed these, and found them to be faithful to the books which I have read a number of times.  I am guessing they will not compare favorably with the new big budget Disney version of the Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe, however I am hesitant to take my young children to that show since it is bound to be intense and frightening.

1732548,5,B000069CFH,"THE GREATEST STORY EVER TOLD
With the movie release of ""The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe"" on December 9th, based upon the Christian classics by the late Christian scholar and literary genius C.S. Lewis, the world will see one of the most fascinating stories made into film. What the average movie goer won't know is WHY Lewis wrote the original book: (1) to describe what God was like (via the character of Aslan, who is a picture of the ""Lion of Judah"" [Revelation 5:5] or Jesus Christ] and (2) to convey in illustrative form of the salvation story of Jesus--that Jesus Christ (Aslan) was willing to die in our place because we (like Edmund) were in bondage to sin (Turkish Delight) and evil (White Witch).

Initiated by a dream that Lewis had at 16 years old, The Lion, Witch, and The Wardrobe built the cornerstone of a seven-book fantasy that has sold 90 million copies over 55 years, establishing itself as one of the most beloved works of Christian fiction of all time. This initial volume follows the journey of the four Pevensie siblings--Lucy, Edmund, Susan and Peter. Set in World War II England, the children enter the world of Narnia through a magical wardrobe while playing a game of 'hide-and-seek' in the rural country home of an elderly professor. Once there, the children discover a charming, peaceful land inhabited by talking beasts, dwarfs, fauns, centaurs and giants that has become a world cursed to eternal winter by the evil White Witch, Jadis.

Under the guidance of a noble and mystical ruler, the lion Aslan, the children fight to overcome the White Witch's powerful hold over Narnia in a spectacular, climactic battle, with its central figure, Aslan, the victorious lion who represents Christ--the Lion of Judah, who dies and resurrects just as in the Gospels. Moreover, Aslan, like Christ, voluntarily steps in to take the punishment due to one of the 'sons of Adam'. The children, like the Disciples, are initially grief stricken by Aslan's death but then overjoyed by his return, and then join him to fight against the White Witch and her evil allies. (Of course, there are many other links between the book and the Christian faith.)

A GREAT MOVIE THAT IS TRUE TO ITS ORIGINAL BOOK-AND ""THE BOOK""
Well, Walden Media and Walt Disney Studios have now turned this novel of the Christian Gospel into a $150 million movie that will reintroduce ""The Chronicles of Narnia"" to a whole new generation of children and their parents in a ""Lord-of-the-Ring"" type movie format. And this initial Narnian theatrical adventure is expected to be followed in coming years with the following six-volumes being made into movies. (You can see an actual theatrical trailer of this first movie and see more about the making of the movie by going to [...].

I must admit I was skeptical at first to have Disney partnering with Walden in making this movie; it is not like they are known for being a bastion of conservative Christianity! As Christianity Magazine (Oct 2005) conveyed,

The film has been made by Walden Films, which has a good track record of creating family-friendly movies. The decision by Disney to partner with Walden and distribute this film was initially not welcomed by Christian culture watchers in the US who warned that Disney might want to water down the Christian symbolism. Disney have always denied this intent and [so included] the input of Douglas Gresham, the stepson of C.S. Lewis, who is a co-producer [and] has helped reassure wary Christians. ""I am a committed Christian and I am very happy with the script,"" Gresham confirmed.""

Gresham, serving as co-producer, became the spiritual watchdog and conscience of the movie project, assuring that the movie version kept true and accurate to his stepfather's originals.

As a Christian and Pastor, my concerns were further quenched when other national Christian leaders affirmed the value of the movie. ""We believe that God will speak the gospel of Jesus Christ through this film,' said Lon Allison, director of the Billy Graham Centre at Wheaton College in Illinois. Ted Haggard, President of the National Association of Evangelicals, also said that the film was an ideal way for a Christian message to be brought to people who would not otherwise go near a church. ""Here is yet another tool that many may find to be effective in communicating the message of Jesus to those who may not respond to other presentations,"" he said.

MY PERSONAL RESPONSE TO THE MOVIE...WOW!
Having personally seen the movie, I can tell you it is nothing short of almost EVERYTHING C.S. Lewis intended it to convey. I cannot encouage you enough to see this movie, then read one of the many books that explain how God and Jesus are explained via The Chronicles of Narnia (like ""Knowing Aslan"" or many other books one can get from Amazon.com). As a result, at our own Christmas Eve Services (where I pastor at Lake Almanor Community Church in northern California), I will be using the movie to help me answer the question, ""What If There Were No Christmas?"" Before Aslan comes, Narnia is in perpetual winter without hope. Before Christ came, our world was lost in sin and without hope. In addition to our sanctuary's normal Christmas dcor, the stage will be flocked with snow to represent a winter landscape, like Narnia, with a lamppost and a wardrobe, out of which people exit into the winter pines! As of Sunday, January 9th, I will also begin a Sunday Series through the Gospels, studying the life and nature of Jesus Christ. It will be titled, ""In The Lair Of The Lion Of Judah,"" and will take us through a chronological gallop of the Gospels. One can obtain the CD's of those messages or read more about Narnia at our Church web site: lacconline.org)

FROM ATHEIST TO CHRISTIAN SCHOLAR: C.S. LEWIS' SPIRITUAL JOURNEY
One last thing to help you enjoy the movie. Remember that C.S. Lewis' (author of The Chronicles of Narnia) spiritual journey traveled from the extremes of an avowed and antagonistic atheist to a devoted defender and scholar of the Christian faith. His Christian journey can be read in his book, ""Suprised By Joy,"" and his rational defense of the Christian faith (which was originally given in a series of BBC radio programs during WW2) can be read in his book, ""Mere Christianity.""

IN 1916...
After Lewis's mother died of cancer when he was only eight years old (about 1908), his father sent him off to a boarding school. On October 12, 1916, Lewis penned his position in a letter to Arthur Greeves: ""I think that I believe in no religion. There is absolutely no proof for any of them, and from a philosophical standpoint Christianity is not even the best. All religions, i.e., all mythologies...are merely man's own invention-Christ as much as Loki. In every age the educated and thinking [people] have stood outside [religion].""

IN 1929...
Although an atheist until he was roughly 30 years of age, Lewis began investigating the claims of Christianity during the twenties. On December 21, 1929, Lewis-upon reading John Bunyan's Grace Abounding-wrote: ""I...am still finding more and more the element of truth in the old beliefs [that] I feel I cannot dismiss... There must be something in it; only what?"" In this pre-conversion period Lewis wrote: ""I felt as if I were a man of snow at long last beginning to melt."" As a result, in 1929 Lewis was converted to theism. He journaled of that experience: ""I gave in, and admitted that God was God, and knelt and prayed; perhaps, that night the most dejected and reluctant convert in all England,"" but this conversion ""was only to Theism. I knew nothing about the Incarnation [or that Jesus was God in human flesh].""

IN 1931...
In 1931, influenced by his friend J.R.R. Tolkien (""Lord Of The Rings""), he became a Christian and a member of the Church of England. On September 28, 1931, at age thirty-two, Lewis was ""riding to the Whipsnade zoo in the sidecar of Warren's motorcycle. `When we set out I did not believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God, and when we reached the zoo I did.'"" According to 1 John 5:1 and 5, all those who believe that Jesus is the Son of God are ""born of God."" To Arthur Greeves on October 1, 1931, Lewis wrote: ""I have just passed from believing in God to definitely believing in Christ-in Christianity.""

IN 1944...
Although he became an Anglican, he stated that he was influenced by his Roman Catholic friend Tolkien. He was very much interested in presenting a reasonable case for the truth of Christianity, which he did in a series of BBC radio broadcasts, which were developed into his work, ""Mere CHristianity,"" in which he states the following: ""I am trying here to prevent anyone saying the really foolish thing that people often say about Him: `I'm ready to accept Jesus as a great moral teacher, but I don't accept His claim to be God.' That is the one thing we must not say. A man who was merely a man and said the sort of things Jesus said would not be a great moral teacher. He would either be a lunatic-on a level with the man who says he is a poached egg-or else he would be the Devil of Hell. You must make your choice. Either this man was, and is, the Son of God: or else a madman or something worse. You can shut Him up for a fool, you can spit at Him and kill Him as a demon; or you can fall at His feet and call Him Lord and God. But let us not come with any patronising nonsense about His being a great human teacher. He has not left that open to us. He did not intend to."" [CS Lewis, Mere Christianity, Book 2, Chapter 3, The Shocking Alternative]

IN 1950..
It only took C.S. Lewis three months to write ""The Lion, The Witch, And The Wardrobe,"" and he had only one critic, his close friend, JRR Tolkien, who hated it: ""It really won't do,"" he protested. ""Doesn't he know what he's talking about?"" Yet the Chronicles went on to sell over 85 million copies over the last 50 years! (Perhaps the fact that he was still working on The Lord of the Rings after a decade while Lewis knocked off The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe in less than three months had a little to do with it.)

As the BBC news reported, ""Lewis's idea was not to write an allegory for clever readers to decode, where Aslan represents Christ. Rather, Aslan is Christ, coming to the world of talking animals as a lion, just as he came to earth as a human. Lewis found children better at understanding this than adults.

""He was not concerned with teaching children the Christian story in disguise, as he expected them to know it already. Rather he wanted them to feel it. As a child himself, he knew the story of the cross and resurrection of Jesus, and knew it was meant to be important, but he had never felt its importance. If he could retell it in terms of a fairy story, it might make sense to children and they might grasp the nobility, tragedy and power of it.""

LISTEN AND LOOK FOR THE SPIRITUAL STORY BEHIND THE ILLUSTRATIVE ADVENTURE OF NARNIA...
""But what does it all mean?"" asked Susan when they were somewhat calmer. - ""It means,"" said Aslan, ""that though the Witch knew the Deep Magic, there is a magic deeper still which she did not know. Her knowledge goes back only to the dawn of Time. But if she could have looked a little further back, into the stillness and the darkness before Time dawned, she would have read there a different incantation. She would have known that when a willing victim who had committed no treachery was killed in a traitor's stead, the Table would crack and Death itself would start working backwards."" (ch. 15 of ""The Lion, The Witch, And The Wardrobe"")

Wrong will be right, when Aslan comes in sight,
At the sound of his roar, sorrows will be no more,
When he bares his teeth, winter meets its death,
And when he shakes his mane, we shall have spring again. (ch. 8)

Bottom line, see the movie! Then read The Book (""The Bible"").",1133827200,19,11861,4.658385093167702
1732549,5,B000069CFH,"These films are excellent adaptations of four of the Narnia books. They are all beautifully shot, highly evocative, and the cast does a marvelous job. My favorite characters are young Prince Caspian (performed with the perfect blend of youthful exuberance and nobility by Jean Marc Perret) and Eustace Scrubb (played with appropriate snottiness by David Thwaites).The films are all very ""English"" in character, and I mean that in the best possible way, because the books and stories were very English in locations and in flavor.

 I'd like to say something else about these films as well: Yes, many of the special effects are quite unsophisticated by 2005 standards, but that's okay. Why? Because children have imagination! While many adults (such as Mr. Wilsonwood, the previous reviewer who titled his review ""Pathetic"") require everything to be shown to them in perfectly realistic detail for it to be appreciated, most children do not require that. Thus, small children can happily amuse themselves with simple sock puppets: their imaginations fill in any gaps. Such a review as the one below really brings into focus the reason why the characters in the Narnia stories were never allowed to return to Narnia once they left childhood: Adulthood often means the loss of one's ability to let imagination run free.",1130716800,16,1315,5.140186915887851

This is all storytelling, not visual magic, and it does a fine job at just that.

1732552,3,B000069CFH,"I recently became infatuated with the Narnia Books when i picked up ""The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe"" as a bit up light reading for a plane trip. At first i only wished to read the book so as to compare it to the upcoming film (for i had read this particular story in grade school, but had always been more of a Tolkien fan).

By the time my plane touched down i had finished the book and was craving more tales of Narnia. when i got into town the first place i headed was Borders. i got the Magicians Nephew, finished it over the next few nights in the hotel, then picked up The Horse and His Boy, Prince Caspian and Voyage of the Dawn Treader. Im on the last few chapters of Voyage now. im literally addicted.

These BBC films are loyal to C.S. Lewis's cronicles to the T, much in the line of Branah's Hamlet, i mean literally word for word. The special effects are shabby and low-key but not unbearable. the actual way in which the films were shot are as if you are watching a play rather than a movie. the films have a play-like aura around them that actually works for the story (it is much easier to imagine this as a taped play than a movie). The acting is fine, not spectacular, but some of the parts are quite well played out. Aslan is a giant pupet, but its not as ridiculous as it sounds; it is pulled off in a way that you do not simply laugh at him, which would be quite an ignorant thing to do in the first place, he is after all the Great Lion, King over all kings of Narnia.

1732555,5,B000069CFH,"OK I will be honest, when I first saw these films years ago I enjoyed them, but I still had to make fun of them for how embarrassingly moronic they seemed.  Animated creatures dance across your screen in front of grown men dressed up in Halloween costumes doing battle with plastic swords and armour.  The costumes and special effects would have been pretty sorry in most high school plays, for a movie they seem downright unethical.

  So for a few years I walked around thinking that these were enjoyable but poor films.  Then one day I realized that all of this film's weaknesses were simply the result of a very low budget.  The acting, scenery, and the truthfulness to the book were all great.  They simply could not have possibly made these films any better with the amount of resources that they were allotted.  So let's give credit where credit is due.

  And while we are doing that, let's compare it to another cinematic fantasy book adaptation in the ""Lord of the Rings"".  Having seen both series, I would have to say ""The Lord of the Rings"" is 1.5 to 2 times better than this adaptation of CS Lewis' Chronicles of Narnia.  Now consider how many millions of dollars it cost to make LOTR.  Now consider the fact that these people made a movie that was half as good as that multi-million dollar project using plastic swords and cardboard props.  What could these people do if they had a larger amount of money, like say $20, at their disposal?  The prospect is frightening.",1124236800,5,1482,4.574144486692015
1732556,3,B000069CFH,"A new big-screen adaptation of the Narnia Chronicles is currently in the works, to fill the gap that ""Lord of the Rings"" left behind. But it isn't the first adaptation of C.S. Lewis's classic fantasies -- in the 1980s, the BBC made their own adaptation.

""The Lion The Witch and the Wardrobe"" introduces us to the Pevensie kids, four teenagers who are staying in the country during World War II. But during a game of hide-and-seek, Lucy (Sophie Wilcox) hides in a wardrobe -- and finds that the back opens into a snowy forest land, populated by mythic creatures. It's the land of Narnia, where the Pevensies are destined to become kings and queens -- if they can destroy the evil White Witch (Barbara Kellerman), with the return of lion messiah Aslan (Ronald Pickup).

""Prince Caspian and the Voyage of the Dawn Treader"" takes us forward a few years -- and centuries in Narnia. Warlike humans have invaded Narnia and driven the talking animals, centaurs, dryads and others into hiding. But young Prince Caspian (Jean Marc Perret) believes in them, and joins them to defeat his usurping uncle Miraz. And the Pevensies are called from their world to help.

No sooner have Edmund (Jonathan R. Scott) and Lucy finished one adventure than other begins: while arguing with obnoxious cousin Eustace (David Thwaites), they are sucked into a painting and land beside the Narnian ship Dawn Treader. It also happens to be Caspian's ship. The three kids accompany the young king through a sea of horrors, slavers and magicians, right to the edge of the world...

The newly reformed Eustance takes center stage in ""The Silver Chair."" At his chaotic school, he confides to a bullied classmate, Jill Pole (Camilla Power), about Narnia -- and the two of them find themselves whisked there by Aslan. Aslan gives them a quest: Find the aged Caspian's missing son Rilian (Richard Henders), who was seduced away by a malevolent witch. Eustace and Jill reluctantly go, and soon find themselves enmeshed in a plan to conquer all of Narnia.

The BBC has been known to make adaptations of countless books, so it's not surprising that they tried to tackle the Chronicles of Narnia. The result is a mixed bag, with some bad acting and sketchy CGI, but still a satisfying fantasy series with some truly creepy, uplifting or just interesting.

Expect a very faithful adaptation -- the BBC preserved virtually every character, most of the scenes, and all the Christian allegory of Lewis' books. As a result, there are some truly chilling and magical scenes, like Eustace's transformations and the battles with Miraz's armies. The settings are magnificent, especially the giant ""Dawn Treader"" and Caer Paravel.

Unfortunately, it does have its bad points. Some of the special effects are quite dated, including some early blue-screen effects that are almost convincing, but not quite. Costumes are very very Dungeons and Dragons, especially Miraz and his army. And Aslan is played by a large and almost realistic puppet, except he looks like he has arthritis and lots of Botox.

The acting tends to be on the understated good side -- Scott and Thwaites give the best performances, especially since they both play obnoxious twits who have to learn the error of their ways. Entertaining supporting characters abound, like Big Mick (I swear that's his name), both Caspians, Jeffrey Perry, and Warwick Davis (in owl and mouse costumes). The only sour notes are Wilcox and Kellerman; one whines, one cackles like a hammy banshee.

Those anticipating the return of Aslan and the Pevensies in December should check out the BBC movies. While some parts have not aged well over the last twenty years, they are still solid enough to enjoy.",1123804800,36,3699,4.934083601286174

CHILDREN won't ever notice, and pessimistic, cinematically spoiled adults can too if you can forgo nitpicking the detials that are not those of the CG variety of blockbuster Hollywood mega-flicks and look beyond the visual to the stories.

I've probably read the books 20 times since my early childhood. I drag them all out every few years and have a good trip down memory lane and every time I read them, I see something else I missed the last time.

This BBC adaption (Like MOST BBC miniseries) are utterly faithful to the books. I read few of the other reviews and anyone who can claim that the BBC contracdicts a very british author in this adaption needs to read the books again.

The BBC has always been very faithful to books, it's practically their signature hallmark when doing miniseries to literature...

I wish and Hope Hollywood stays as true when this hits the big screen this summer.

I don't know how anyone could possibly say that these are good adaptations.  Lucy and Jill in particular were the opposite of C.S. Lewis' ideas. So much so that they contradicted the plots of later books.  None of the characters looked anything like Lewis' descriptions and the voice for Aslan was horrible and weak.  Where is James Earl Jones when you need him? I saw these for the first time as a child of 9 and they disgusted me then for those same reasons.  I was in tears at their horrible mistakes and the ruin of 4 wonderful books. If you have ever read the books don't waste your time on the movies.  If you haven't read the books you will be turned off by the bad acting and non-special effects.

DON'T waste your time!!!

If you do want to experience a fairly good adaptation.  Try the radio theater from focus on the family.  The voices and sound effects are pretty good, though I wasn't real thrilled with David Suchet as Aslan, he just doesn't have a powerful enough voice.

Actually the best adaptation by far is the new one by Disney.  It should be out on DVD later this year.  Wait for it and ignore this adapatation!!!",1115251200,16,1244,4.446902654867257
1732590,5,B000069CFH,"what all you naysayers of this 3 disc set have been waiting for!!!!!!!! the lion the witch and the wardrobe is coming.

i was just reminincing about the books. (i have read all of them 4 or 5 times) then remembered the movies on pbs.so i started surfing the web,i thought of purchasing them since i only saw bits and pieces of them on pbs about a decade plus a few yrs.so i type in the chronicles of narnia on my browser and what pops up is disneys website.

it gives me great delight that technology has advanced far enough to bring this to film with no imagination required.i love the lion the witch and the wardrobe.my greatest wish is that they don't just make the first book but all of them in succession.that is my dream to see them with nowadays technology.

star wars is over and now i got the chronicles to look forward too.if it take them 30 years to make all of them i will be waiting for the last battle to come out.a 63 year old man going to see a childrens movie.lol

that is how much i loved these books and your children will too,if your thinking of buying these movies for your kids,wait,buy them the books.they are easy to read,grammar is very simple mostly.i think we need to read more nowadays anyways.your children will love the books and you for suggesting them.then see the disney movie in december.they would not appreciate these films unless they have read the books, trust me.once they have read the books these older movies will give some relief until the rest of the chronicles from disney come out, which i just know(i pray) they are going to release eventually.

if your buying these movies cause your a diehard fan you probably won't be dissappointed, because they stay true to the books and you wouldnt care about the special effects.where were the special effects when you read the books ?thats where they are when you reminice with these older movies.

i think there are a lot of parallels not just religous,but actual  ones to this life.like the old proffesser who gets to here the storys again from his nieces and nephews when they come back. after all those years, from that magical portal sitting in his room that he really knows all about.i can delight my children and live it again through them in a way.

when LotR came out,i thought they should do the chronicles of narnia(my favorite books of all time to this day).now they have and i am a happy camper waiting for christmas.i literally have been waiting 22 yrs for this,no lie.christmas seems so close now and its still april.:)

i am going to buy the 3 disc set,but these movies are definitly for the diehard fan.you will either love them or hate them, i guess.

check out disneys web site for the chronicles of narnia and you will not be dissappointed.if you want up to date ,then your gonna have to wait, until this christmas.

i am already dancing around like tummus knowing that i have a very good movie to look forward to this christmas.you might think i am fruity, but its impossible to tell how much joy these books brought me when i was young teenager.

i read these books when i was 12,i am 33 now. i still sit back and remember how fun it was to discover them.i had a book report to do in 7th grade and i had saw the cartoon so i thought it would be easy and i could get out of reading a book.i started reading it,i was just gonna read the first chapter and got hooked,little did i know i would read every chronicle 5 or 6 times.

another parallel was i felt kinda as i got older like the kids in the book.i would read the books but after the 5th or 6 th time its hard to read them again, to go back.i just couldn't read any of the books again.that was probably 18 yrs ago.i thought c.s. lewis was a genius when i was younger and still do.i thought he made it so that you can only read them so many times.that he knew.i was sad to learn he had passed away.i was hoping maybe he would write more,add on to the chronicles of narnia, but to no avail.

as you know i am delighted to tell you that this is my ticket back,one last time,actually many more times through my children,and grandchildren and great grandchildren,if i am lucky.that is how much i loved these books and movies and movie that is coming.

i hoped my hemming and hawwing has helped you and hope your experiences or childrens are as joyful as mine were.thank you and god bless",1114473600,7,4346,4.368029739776952

1732594,5,B000069CFH,"Rather than the cartoons of Snow White, Cinderella, Pinnochio, Peter Pan, Bambi and so on, I was a resident of the land of Narnia when I was a kid. And not because my family is ultra-religious either. In fact, we never really picked up on the biblical parallels until we read about them on this website!

What we saw was a basic battle between good and evil and a great group of kids who had to conquer their shortcomings to become the best people they could be. They faced adversity and had to stand on their own against even their own friends and siblings to do what was right. And in the end, they triumphed! For me, this series contributed much more to my sense of self, my take on right and wrong, and my maturity than any Disney cartoons ever could have!

I first saw these movies on Public tv, PBS, when I was maybe 4 or 5 years old and my Mom had the foresight to record them to video tape for me. Over the years, I watched the tapes so much that they were really beginning to have poor quality, plus some pieces of the movies were missing. That's why I was delighted when these came out on DVD! Even at 20 years old, I still like to revisit my childhood for a time and I hope to share them with my children when the time comes, that being when I become a Mom.

I think my favorite would be The Voyage of the Dawn Treader, the adventures are so varied and the ship is just beautiful! I love to see Eustace's transformation and all the islands they visit have so many different things and people to discover. Like Deathwater Island, the Island of the Dufflepuds and of course the Silver Sea and the underwater Warrior Sea People. This part of the film also leaves the least out. It includes most of the adventures from the book and allows time for plot development. I was disappointed that Prince Caspian is really that short, I wish they had made it longer.

My main complain is, why aren't The Magician's Nephew, The Horse and His Boy and The Last Battle included? Why weren't these books made into films?

However, I have even more compliments for this particular set. The actor who plays Puddleglum is FANTASTIC! I remember watching him in Dr. Who as well, do any of you remember K-9 the robotic dog? lol  But honestly, he does do a superb job in being a wet blanket! There are a few cheesy effects in this set, like the scene where Prince Rilian kills the serpent witch, it's SO obviously a dummy. Also, some of the cartoons are a little lacking in imagination. But, I do know that these are BBC films and that there was no such thing as complicated computer animation in the early 80's. Back then, we had black screens with green writing on them and dot matrix printers! I remember using those things in grade school.

But anyways, all in all this is a great set! I'm so happy to be able to preserve some of my favorite movies from childhood on DVD and see them whole and clear again after all these years! The story is timeless, engaging and non-denominational! BUY THIS SET, you will NOT be disappointed! Also recommended are Rigoletto, The Rogue Stallion, Black Beauty and The Black Stallion (guess I don't really like cartoons!) Enjoy!!!",1092009600,219,3154,4.399656946826759

If you are expecting a special effects treat, this is not for you.  If you are familiar with Dr Who, that is more of what you are getting.  (Tom even appears in one of the series)  The stories are wonderful for all ages.  My children ages 7 and 12 often choose to watch them over Nemo, Spy Kids, etc which pleases me greatly.  The quality could be better but is acceptable and when you consider the limited production budget they did quite well.  For a Christian with children, this is a must have.  Better to get this faithful reproduction of the author's work now because Disney has bought the rights to the books and will be releasing something around Christmas 2005.  I hope they can stay true to the story line and not deviate too much but I am not holding my breath on that one.",1079481600,14,962,4.265193370165746
1732596,2,B000069CFH,I watched this on PBS as a kid and was disappointed.  Aslan looked totally fake.  His mouth didn't even move when he talked.  I'd like to see all the Chronicles of Narnia be made into movies now that we have the technology to do it.  There could be a CGI Aslan that would actually look alive.,1076198400,8,292,4.160714285714286
1732627,3,B000069CFH,"These movies obviously suffered from an unrealistically low budget.  Additionally, in my opinion they tended to follow the books far too closely, which made them very slow-paced.  The exception is Prince Caspian, where the pace is no quicker, but they cut out more than two thirds of the material and combined it with The Voyage of the Dawn Treader in a single movie.
These movies are also very sanitized.  In Prince Caspian it seems that this was intentional, as the battle scenes lack any realism, and the subplot with the tree spirits, Bacchus, etc., has been completely removed.  The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe, is sanitized basically due to budget constraints, because it's impossible to feel any fear at the death of Aslan when half the evil creatures around him are hand-painted cartoons.
Of the three movies, I think that only The Silver Chair is much good, and that is mostly because Tom Baker as Puddleglum steals the show.  He is funny, deep, and powerful, all at the same time--it's comparable in many ways to Johnny Depp's performance in Pirates of the Carribean.  Camilla Power as Jill also makes it a better movie, since she was the only child actor in the series who could actually act; and Richard Henders as Prince Rillian gives an outstanding performance as well.
The Silver Chair is perhaps further helped by the fact that we only have to endure about fifteen or twenty minutes of humans in animal costumes, while they are present throughout the other two movies.  Such costumes work great in a well-done stage performance, but look absolutely silly on screen.
All hard-core Narnia fans should own these movies.  Unfortunately, it's not because they're especially good, but rather because they're a piece of Narnia.",1067731200,13,1742,4.921501706484642

I enjoyed the DVDs and so did my two sons aged 4 & 2. Well done to BBC for trying to faithfully adapt the books, even with the limited budget. Yes, the special effects are not always special, but pretty good for a television production back in the late 80s/early 90s. The animatronics of Aslan is convincing, especially his size. I hope this DVD production prompts the filmmakers who are planning to make a movie of the Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe to produce something great. One surprise with the DVD set; having ordered it from North America, I thought I would not be able to play the DVDs on my Japanese (Region 2) DVD player, but, 'by Jove' it did! So maybe it is a 'Region Free' DVD. One disappointment: Maybe it was my DVD player/amp but the mono sound did not play very well on my system, with the dialogue often hard to hear.

I also always feel the whole thing works better if Peter and Susan are a little older.  And I hope the girl who played Lucy went on to get some braces cause those teeth are really distracting.

1732631,2,B000069CFH,"..
I read the Narnia books as a very young kid, and had good memories of the sense of security that they brought.  I remember that I thought they were good stories at the time, but that was before I knew about what they actually meant.  Replace the name Aslan with Jesus and you might as well be watching a kids Bible series.  I remember the books having a bit more suspense and an epic quality.
The TV series, on the other hand, reduces everything to brief episodes that teach a religious lesson.  When trouble arises the lesson is to cry out to Aslan to save you.  The kids generally don't do much saving of themselves.  The evil doers like the witch are over-done, and their only motive seems to be leading people away from the true god, Aslan.
I actually do remember as a kid being revolted by the story of Aslan having to be slaughtered at the alter in order to save Edmond. This gets back to the whole world-view that once a person transgresses he can't be redeemed without the resurrection.  If that's your thing, help yourself.
With that said, I gave it two stars for the wonderful filming locations.  The DVD is really crisp and brings out all of the colours beautifully.  Whether it's the snowy forest or the rolling lush green hills and cliffs, the scenes are breathtaking.  I liked the added animations, and I should definitely mention that the Dawn Treader was a very inspiring reconstruction of a fantasy ship.  I wish I had one.
The costumes were also very interesting, especially the armour.  The animals, however, mostly looked like some sort of college mascots.  I had a hard time imagining them as anything other than people in silly Disney costumes.  Aslan was just a big stuffed animal.
The acting ranged from BBC quality down to very childish over-acting.  Some of the kids are annoying.  It is as if you don't know who to slap first the Veruka Salt-ish, bratty ones or the overly zealous ones who can't contain themselves.  Oops..I think I know what kind of character C.S. Lewis would portray me as.  I wonder who my evil minions would be?

1732687,5,B000069CFH,"A number of years back, the BBC produced this television version of four of C.S. Lewis's Chronicles of Narnia.  The books, of course, are Biblical allegory for children, but they are beloved of many a non-Christian fantasy fan (including me) because they are basically Good Stories.  Furthermore, the ideals embraced by the allegory -- mercy, justice, bravery, concern for nature, intelligent contemplation of spirituality, and so on -- are hardly exclusive to Christianity.  Lewis happened to believe that his theology was logically supportable, but you don't have to agree with him on that to see that he was fundamentally a good man, and that his concept of virtue is admirable in many respects.
The BBC series captures the innocence, the adventure, and the peculiarly British charm of the books.  Also, much like Peter Jackson's new Lord of the Rings movies, it replaces lengthy expository text with beautiful scenery and intricately designed props, keeping the plot advancing steadily.  Though there are some groan-worthy bits of melodramatic line delivery, the acting is overall quite good, and there is a standout performance by Tom Baker (known to many SF fans as the fourth Doctor Who) as Puddleglum the Marshwiggle in The Silver Chair.

1732688,5,B000069CFH,"I enjoyed these movies very much, especially the Voyage of the Dawn Treader and the Silver Chair, but I still have some reservations. I feel that the four Pevensey children were too young, and had too little screen presence and acting ability. The part of Lucy is especially miscast, which is a great pity. But the movies are very true to the books, both in letter and in spirit, and that's what matters. The simple special effects and the fur-suit animals didn't bother me. The general atmosphere is more like a high school stage play than a professional movie, but the unpretentiousness and the lack of melodrama are refreshing. There is plenty of room for the imagination to be active, which generally isn't the case in modern movies.
I totally fell in love with the ship in the Dawn Treader. It's a real ship, full size (which still means small!), strikingly beautiful, and accurately built to Lewis' descriptions, except that it doesn't have oars. A better Narnian ship could hardly have been created, even by the highest budget production. The scenes with the giants in Harfang were very well done, and many underground scenes in the Silver Chair were filmed in real underground caverns. The gentle and appealing theme music evokes, for me, the real feeling of Narnia.
Overall, even though these movies could have been improved by better casting and tauter scripts, and even though they seem embarassingly amateurish at times, somehow a little of the wonder and delight of the books still shines through.",1034380800,15,1510,4.90234375

The dramatization stays very closely to the books except for some omissions of scenes which would be expensive to dramatize and do not advance the story.  The wicked witch is mundane and almost ugly which is the exact opposite of what Lewis described in his writings about the story.  He claimed that evil disguises itself as beauty; otherwise people would not be attracted to it.  This does not detract from the story very much.
