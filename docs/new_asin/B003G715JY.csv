4120991,5,B003G715JY,A raw portrayal of Alaskan law enforcement. It's impossible not to enjoy the series. The show is not cheesy. It does its best to get close and personnel to the daily grind of Alaskan state troopers. The result is pure entertainment,1362787200,,231,4.658536585365853
4120992,4,B003G715JY,The first season of Alaska State Troopers is still my favorite.  Even with a new season on tv you can still watch past seasons and not get bored.,1361750400,,145,4.178571428571429
4120993,4,B003G715JY,"I love this show (especially Trooper Howie Peterson) and was really excited to get this Season but it was entirely too short and for the price, it was not worth it. I would definitely wait until this goes to $15 or less. What I really enjoyed about this documentary compared to other cop shows, it has the wildlife aspect to it, so they explain a lot of the laws Alaska has concerning the protection of their wildlife which I think adds a real humane aspect to it. Definitely a great Season to watch and I will be buying the rest of the seasons.",1359504000,5,545,4.300970873786408

4120996,5,B003G715JY,"We got addicted to watching this show this season.  Watched the discovery channel one weekend and he had an entire day of shows.  My daughter loved so much she wanted to see all the previous ones.  Bought her all the seasons available to watch while at school, hopefully keeping her away from the college parties.  We all enjoy this show.",1351036800,,338,4.583333333333333

4120998,5,B003G715JY,"You wouldn't expect a show about state troopers to be that funny, but I was laughing so hard from the first episode on.
Some gems include:

Narrator: ""The driver's caught with a rum and coke, mixed in a salad dressing jar.""

and

Woman: ""He's had about 10 shots and 12-14 beers.""
Trooper: ""Would you say he's intoxicated then?""
Woman: ""Oh yeah.""

On top of having its humorous moments, the show gives us a glimpse of what it's like to live in the beautiful but rugged state of Alaska.",1324512000,,484,4.465909090909091

4121047,2,B003G715JY,"I'm a retired LE Officer and have the highest regard for the Officers in this show doing their job in such extreme conditions and with such limited resources. And, as a show its just 'so-so' in my view. The crimes/cases they work on are as common as the dysfunctional, alcohol fueled people they deal with everyday. One rather shocking bit of information you do get from the show is that 90% of Alaskans own a gun and a concealed weapons permit is not required to have a loaded gun right next to you in your car--yikes! Again, love the Cops--didn't like the show.",1375574400,,563,4.475728155339806

Alaska is a wonderful place that has wonderful LE, however, NG only showcases the crystal-meth, drunkards, and idiots that wouldn't survive a single season without LE support; only to make $$$$.",1479340800,,472,5.378378378378378
