8261764,5,B00169PYVY,What's the issue with getting this series out on DVD?  Can someone please explain what the delay is?  I loved this series and really would like to purchase it.  Thanks in advance for your answers/input!,1297382400,,202,4.714285714285714
8261765,5,B00169PYVY,"Don't you see. Most everything in this show has been made classified and locked away by the government and not allowed to be open until in some cases 2050 so that those involved are surely dead and gone but has leaked via this venue. The Roswell incident... John and Bobby's assasinations. Marilyn Monroe too. All linked to the events that are too shocking for us to know. It all can't be true, can it? We go along with our lives thinking tomorrow will be yet another day but one tomorrow will be more different than any in the history of humankind.

Like Mulder said....the Truth is out there and this is the truth.",1285804800,,616,4.451327433628318
8261766,4,B00169PYVY,"this was a good series while it lasted, it was completely different to other series set in the 1960s and starting with the mutilated cow in the pilot was vintage alien stuff hope they release it on dvd soon p.s megan ward is hot",1272412800,,228,4.204545454545454
8261767,3,B00169PYVY,"Very well written made for TV series.  The acting was great.  The way current events and people were woven into the story was excellent.  Some of the special effects were a bit lower budget, but everything else more than made up for it.  I recently got it on DVD and pretty much crammed the entire thing into a couple evenings.  Yes it kept me that interested that I couldn't get to bed.

If you love sci fi and stuff about aliens, this is well worth a watch.",1232668800,,459,4.218390804597701
8261768,5,B00169PYVY,"Dark Skies was one of the most creative Sci Fi series, with the writers tying real historical events into the story line. The most appealing thing about the story lines, was the fact that Dark Skies' explanation of the events were usually about as plausible as any other explaination of what happened. It left you wondering ""if there is any truth in it"". Since the whole concept was a period piece, I never had a problem with special effects, as I am sure the idea was to make it in the form of a 50's-60's Sci-Fi piece. There are numerous scientists and investigators, who believe that there is a lot of truth to some of the stories. I found it to be a lot more interesting than any of the other Sci-Fi efforts in the last several years.",1221350400,,738,4.355072463768116
8261769,4,B00169PYVY,"Eric Close was excellently cast in this period piece. He is reminiscent of a combination Fox and Scully from X-Files, first more like Scully, not believing the alien cover-up and being shocked and then evolving into Fox, who believes.  The shows special effects left something to be desired considering when it was produced but had the vintage feel of classic science fiction.  The plot was executed in an uneven fashion and stayed surprisely dark in tone. The series never really evolved into what it had the potential to be but is worth a look if you remember The Twilight Zone, The Outer Limits, and to a more limited degree, The X-Files fondly.",1218240000,,648,4.776785714285714
8261770,4,B00169PYVY,The idea of the show was to start with Roswell and come forward in time until the series caught up with the present -- which it would have in 2000.  Such was the plan but the show was cancelled in it's first season. It never had the appeal of the X-Files.,1205193600,,255,4.0
8261771,5,B00169PYVY,Where is Dark Skies?  There are many closet fans out there looking for the first (and only) season.  Help bring back this series.,1193011200,,129,4.565217391304348
8261772,5,B00169PYVY,"One of the most enjoyable sci-fi programmes ever made has two real-life amazing mysteries:

 1) That it never made it inot a second series, and

 2) That it is impossible to purchase.

As far as I can tell, there is no DVD version and the VHS is seemingly impossible to track down. If anyone reading this can help in any way to point me in the right direction or to speak to anyone in the know who could possibly get this wonderful piece of tv history put onto DVD and released, then PLEASE let me know.

Anyone who's never seen it - you're missing out on something fabulous.",1154476800,,575,4.277777777777778
