5835656,5,B00DNJ95TM,This is a must have for any big Tupac fan.  If you liked Before I Wake with Frank Alexander.  You will like this DVD too.  They revealed some interesting details about Tupac's life and closer details of why he didn't want to go to Vegas for the fight that I never knew before.  I personally own all of Tupac's documentaries and this is definitely up there with Thug Angel and Before I Wake.,1381104000,,390,4.301369863013699

The majority of this film sums up 1996 as it should...the way it played out...like a bad movie awaiting to happen. I miss his talent...there is no doubt this guy would've become a great political mind, and helped changed the landscape of today's youth...he left a blueprint behind in his music, and poems.....I could not watch this twice, but definitely recommend it to anyway who wants to know some truths that was buried when he died!!1",1456704000,,645,4.926605504587156

5835842,4,B00DNJ95TM,I thought the movie was well done and made a lot of sense concerning the demise of the late great Tupac.  It made me sad that he is gone and there are a lot of questions left to be answered about the surrounding his death.  Maybe one day the truth will come out and make sense of this great tragedy.,1393632000,,299,3.966666666666667

He would've been something big for our generation, actually I guess he kinda is he will live on through his music forever...
