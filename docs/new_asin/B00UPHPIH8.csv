8707839,5,B00UPHPIH8,"TV critics have described Halt and Catch Fire as ""Mad Men"" set in 1980s Texas personal computer business. This may speak to its quality, but doesnt give this series enough credit for its originality. It has compelling story telling that, while enjoyable in episodic installments, is only fully revealed in all its dramatic power over the course of the seasons ten-episode arc.

Each episode is a collaborative effort and theres not a mediocre one in the bunch. Yet creators Christopher Cantwell and Christopher C. Rogers scripts  the premiere, second episode, and season finale  are the weakest. Its remarkable that show runner Jonathan Lisco elevated the rest of seasons writing quality from merely very good to excellent by leading a team of gifted writers that includes Mad Men alumnus Dahvi Waller. So, while the first two episodes may be slightly melodramatic, its an incredibly satisfying storyline, as things pick up to a wowing consistency only from Episode 3 onward, climaxing in Episodes 8 and 9.

Like myself, you may know or care little about computers. Rest assured, your enjoyment doesnt rely upon such familiarity; reference to them is intelligible as far as the dramatic stakes are concerned.

The four lead characters wonderfully complement and oppose one another. Whats rare, even unprecedentedly carried out to this degree in TV and film, is how the female characters are equally important and engaging as the male ones. The storys themes are serious, too. They range from a sense of self, the search for professional and personal fulfillment, sexual and identity politics, and relationships  from lovers to family to friendship. Yet the great writing ensures that all this unravels with subtlety, moral complexity, occasional humor, realism, and, most importantly, genuine surprise for the viewer.

Its all facilitated with superb acting of very relatable characters.  Lee Pace plays Joe MacMillan, the public face of the enterprise with marketing savvy. A combustible personality, he gambles big, thrilled by teetering between success and failure. Mackenzie Davis plays Cameron Howe, the brilliant programmer Joe recruits out of college. Opposites in so many ways, they are simultaneously at odds and drawn to each other, ambitious to do great work in the field. Both have an arrogance that would be off-putting were it not complemented by a desperation rooted in vulnerability that results in this passionate dedication to finding purpose by making a lasting mark  something we all desire.

Where Camerons talents lay in software, Gordon Clark (Scoot McNairy) has a genius for hardware design, as does his wife, Donna (Kerry Bish). Contrasting Joe and Camerons tumultuous pairing is their more stable marriage. They have their own baggage after Gordons failure to strike it big in the tech world yielded a financial and commensurate emotional toll on them. Seemingly less passionate, their relationship is more equal and intellectually validating; yet, frustration at work and complacency at home have led both to feel stuck, as each wants more out of life  and possibly their marriage. Lastly, Toby Huss rounds out the cast as John Bosworth, giving the best performance of all; its a shame he gets such little screen time.

Finally, Halt and Catch Fire has the best theme music of any TV show since that of Barrington Pheloung for the UK series Inspector Morse. This is no mean feat, as it excitingly punctuates each episodes teaser.

I cant praise it enough. Theres not a program to which Ive looked forward more in these last two years. Watch Halt and Catch Fire and youll feel the same!",1464998400,,3612,5.153846153846154
