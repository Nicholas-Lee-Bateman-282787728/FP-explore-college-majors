8400412,5,B003MIZ9LW,"The future of space in thirty years is seen as bright, if somewhat dangerous, future full of wealth and adventure.  Cities in space, employment in space, sports in space, laundry and art in space.  We have engineers, designers, architects and others explore, talk about, and examine what living in space will be like.  The documentary came out in 1997 and makes me a tad sad.  If the vision of the show was ever to be fulfilled we would have needed to do something more by now.  Oh well.
I like the details of the show.  They talk about growing food in space, dealing with emergencies in space, searching for water, and so on.  The need for plants, interesting living spaces, and keeping yourself fit is all explored.  And where can you find Billy Bob Thornton, Weird Al Yankovic, and Jesse ""The Body"" Ventura all working on the same project?
I got a DVD copy from FASE but I would suggest getting the tapes, if you can, as the DVD costs more than the tapes, there are no real extras, and it took them more than a month to get it to me - the first delivery never made it and they were somewhat slow to reply to email also.",1294358400,,1122,4.3349282296650715
