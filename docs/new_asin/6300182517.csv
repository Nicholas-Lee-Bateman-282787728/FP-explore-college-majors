220579,4,6300182517,"It's great that this underrated classic can be finaly popular with DVD. It's a tough, gritty drama yet with a lot f fun. The three actors are just marvelous, and the supporting cast looks so real too. The transfer may be  dissapointing for those who likes crisp-DVD-images, but the soft look of  the film is actually more appropreate for the kind of film this one is.  Some DVD is too fussy about having a ""crisp"" image, while some  movies are made to look not-too-crisp. What is arguably more enjoyable and  enlightning on this edition is Schrader's commentary that you can hear on  the additional audio track. His story of how difficult to shoot this film,  because the three actors are constantly trying to get over the top of the  other two to prove who was the star of the film (when the film is intended  to be the story of these three guys), is hillarious, and reveals how  difficult the job of the director is. Schrader says the experience of  making this film ""was a nightmare. I thought that if a director's job  was something like that, it was humanely impossible"".",959126400,,1076,4.575916230366492

After writing successful screenplays for directors like  Martin Scorsese and Brian DePalma, Paul Schrader here makes his directorial  debut, and it is still his best film to date.  It's a searing, knowing  drama about the lives of Detroit auto workers, and in it Richard Pryor  gives his first dramatic performance.  He's brilliant, and Harvey  Keitel--no surprise here--matches him.  If you'r a fan of filmmakers like  Scorsese, you'll like Paul Schrader and this film in particular.

220713,3,6300182517,"Paul Schrader, probably best known for writing Martin Scorsese pictures such as Taxi Driver, Raging Bull, The Last Temptation of Christ, and Bringing Out the Dead, was also--is also--an accomplished director, as evidenced by the film Blue Collar. The film, which stars Richard Pryor, Harvey Keitel, and Yaphet Kotto, centers around the lives of three blue collar (hence the title) auto workers on the assembly line in Detroit. Their Union has been screwing them, so one day, Pryor's character decides to rob the vault in the Union offices, bring Keitel and Kotto along. However, there is no money, and the next day, the Union claims that thousands of dollars were stolen. And the intrigue begins..

It's a great crime film, a great film of the 70's, from the New Hollywood, that centers not only on an intriguing plot, but also on realistic characters....and it's also funny.

However, now we get to the DVD. This is a DVD-R copy, meaning it's made to order, burned from a computer, packaged, then sent to you. That's fine in most cases, however, Amazon had it listed in their product description that this included Schrader's (supposedly) great commentary that is included on an earlier version. If all you care about is owning a copy of this film, then do it, buy it. It works. But if you want the commentary, look  for Anchor Bay's release. It tends to run a little higher in price, but maybe worth it to you.

So in the end, the film gets 5 stars, all around. The DVD is what knocked my star rating down to 3 stars.",1358726400,6,1519,4.656716417910448

220718,5,6300182517,"A working class Gem! This movie goes to the heart of over worked under paid auto workers at the old Checker Cab company, which is now long gone. From the opening frame you can hear [Ry Cooder's?] blend of a particular blues song with the background noise of the factory and his "" lyric "" about being a hard working "" expletive "" man. I've read some comments about the Oreo crew. I personally feel they where very good friends who hung out at the bars together, amongst other things. So for the most part they worked together, drank together, and engaged in orgies and other things such as powder. They were way over there heads financially, with Zeke having the IRS hounding him, Jerry not being able to afford braces for his daughter, and Smokey, who had done time had his illegal resources so to speak. So they decided to get even and rob the union's safe, only to open a can of worms that put their lives in serious jeopardy. Enter the FBI, and the downward spiral begins which seems like the abyss for the three. If you want to get to the heart of corruption, both morally and the status quo, good fathers, { Zeke and Jerry } but bad husbands. I could go on and on about this buried treasure.

Director and co-scenarist(with his brother, Leonard) Paul Schrader views U.S. labor with a take no prisoners approach.  It's as though he sees management-labor as a festering wound that he not only picks at but tears at it with a Bowie knife.  It's a vicious cycle that just perpetuates itself that can't be assuaged with the exchange of a bottle of Cutty Sark.  I saw this film as a teenager on a double-bill with Richard Pryor's broad comedy ""Which Way Is Up?"".  As recollection serves people were walking out between features.  Either ""Blue Collar"" depressed people or they weren't prepared to handle the uneasy truths that Schrader was doling out.

220745,1,6300182517,"This review is for the product - the film is an under-rated gem that deserves a full restoration and proper DVD release, but instead Universal has relegated it to this garbage ""Vault Series"" line.  What you get when ordering any film in this series is a DVD-R, not a commercially made DVD - with a basic case/cover that anyone could make at home.  It's despicable and following on the heals of Warner Bros. similar attempts, a rather frightening portent of what's to come.  The only recourse we have is to send a message that this is NOT ACCEPTABLE.  Don't pay $20 for a 25 cent PC pressed copy!  Universal should be ashamed of themselves!

To be perfectly clear, what you get is essentially a home-pressed DVD COPY, not a commercial DVD.  There are no menus - you put it in and the film starts, that's it.  No extras, no subtitles, and non-anamorphic middling transfers.  Lost is the excellent Paul Schrader commentary from the long out of print Anchor Bay disc.  Putting excellent films like this, Tell Them Willie Boy is Here, A Bronx Tale, and others - many of which were previously already available on DVD! - is absolutely insulting! They aren't worth the cost of shipping them, but they have the audacity to charge $20 a pop?  Absolutely appalling greed that depends on uninformed consumers ordering blindly.

220747,4,6300182517,"Long before the term ""blue collar"" became equated with Jeff Foxworthy, a stand-up comic who basically pilfers a one-note joke about his confederate flag-waver heritage over and over, blue collar referred to manual labor performed by GED-earners, usually under poor working conditions and low pay. Foxworthy was a white-collar worker. He built mainframes for IBM.

In 1978, ""Blue Collar"" was the first studio-backed film to feature two black actors as leads -- Yaphet Kotto and Richard Pryor -- both showing genuine flair for dramatic acting under the improbable direction of Paul Schrader, a squirrelly, self-loathing man who was apparently bullied on the set by Pryor, heavily into coke at the time. Schrader himself was just starting to develop a taste for nose candy, which is likely why after this, his directorial debut, he didn't do another thing worth a darn for at least eight years. Schrader, who wrote the screenplay for ""Taxi Driver,"" co-wrote the film with his brother Leonard, another damaged man (thanks to their father), who, according to Peter Biskind's book, ""Easy Riders, Raging Bulls,"" around this time would put the working end of a pistol in his mouth like a pacifier as an insomnia cure. Paul would eventually flirt with the idea of writing Leonard out of a film credit. Nobody can say these guys were far from the art they were creating.

""Blue Collar"" explores some of the same themes as ""Taxi Driver:"" dissatisfied youth without a sense of purpose (or a college education) rebelling against a Nixonian system that was employing an outdated rulebook. The action revolves around three auto assembly line workers portrayed by Kotto, Pryor and Harvey Keitel, or as a minor character in the film observes, ""an Oreo cookie."" They are overworked, underpaid, hounded by supervisors at work and government agents after work hours, and unable to adequately support their families. They see a way out by robbing the union, which doesn't go as planned and quickly spirals out of control. All three leads contribute fine, nuanced performances that lend them credibility by the time the action becomes wrought with politics, corruption and greed a la ""Chinatown,"" here substituting unions for water.

It's only at the very end that the film falters, as if Schrader had just given up filming, then later tried to tidy up an insufficient conclusion in the editing room. If he'd had the conviction to keep at it, ""Blue Collar"" might have been a masterpiece. As it is stands, it's a minor classic.",1260576000,6,2504,5.028915662650602
220748,4,6300182517,"Blue Collar (Paul Schrader, 1978)

In the early days of Paul Schrader's career, the man could do no wrong. By 1978, he was already well known for his screenplays for Taxi Driver and Rolling Thunder, and he jumped into the director's chair to film his own script for Blue Collar. Turned out to be a pretty good decision, as this is one of Schrader's best early efforts, from both a writing and a directing standpoint. While he's fallen on hard times recently (he's one of the directors who recently tried his hand at an Exorcist prequel, and we all know how those turned out, don't we?), his early films stand as testament to his amazing talent.

Here we have three auto workers, Zeke (standup comedian Richard Pryor), Smokey (Homicide: Life on the Street's Yaphet Kotto), and Jerry (Taxi Driver's Harvey Keitel), all of whom are having financial problems. They're not getting any help from their corrupt union heads, so the three decide to take matters into their own hands and rob the local union office. Murphy's Law, of course, rears its ugly head, and the three find themselves in over their heads.

According to Schrader, the shoot was exceptionally tense, as the leads didn't get along at all (Pryor, especially, was out of control, attacking each of the others at least once, by Schrader's recollection). The mark of fine actors is the ability to take that tension and transfer it to their roles, and it should go without saying that Keitel and Kotto are fantastic actors. The real surprise here is Pryor, who had spent the majority of his film career to that time acting in light comedies, venturing rarely into drama. Here he's the lead even among the three leads, and he nails it. The three of them doing their ensemble thing would be awesome no matter the setting, but Schrader's pointed attack on the culture he's examining (the film's tagline was ""what happened to the American dream?"") is subtle and smart enough to lend the film an even sharper edge. Blue Collar is a film with teeth, and a very good one at that. Highly recommended. ****",1245974400,4,2053,4.713091922005571
220779,4,6300182517,"Blue Collar (1978) is a hit in my mind, in the tradition of the
hard-hitting, dripping-with-reality yet artistic and entertaining
movies that Harvey Keitel has come to represent.

The real story, is how far can friendship go, among co-workers, when
by circumstances at work and in their personal lives, those decide
to burglar a union office in order to raise cash, to meet mounting
out of control consumer spending on credit, lack of budgeting, and
financial discipline.

We learn that, at the end of the day, the turn of events happens
very quickly leading to unforeseen outcomes, from pressures coming
from a variety of unexpected sources.

The power of the mass media and American culture, controls minds and
emotions, as workers feel compelled to partake in escort services,
lines of powder,  orgies in between their married lives and that on
the car assembly line.

Reality comes calling, in the form of tax evasion  caught by the
IRS, and general ethnic and job class tensions, on perceptions of
fairness.

The bigger picture of course, never is told, as factories constitute
their own microcosms, with equal measures of pain and pleasure,
relaxation and hard work, in terms of those closing down,
jeopardized by overseas imported vehicles.

Not being a fan of Richard Pryor, in particular, I have to admit I
was taken aback by his maturity and presence, at least the one
captured on film, which had nothing comical in it, as well as his
senior role to Harvey Keitel, who, although having a mind of his
own, is presented with a ""fait accompli"" at one point in the
picture.

Another lesson, with Yaphet Kotto playing it, is that in a
workplace, too often the men in charge are egomaniacal and use only
that criteria in deciding who to cut loose and let go in the
company, as opposed to maximizing shareholder wealth.

As such, any and all strong, smart on their feet and wise
(potential) leaders among the grassroots force are immediate targets
from the higher-ups, keen on purging potential rivals early on, to
consolidate their hegemony.

Secrets are never secrets, so long as there is someone out there
with money, who is willing to buy them and someone attracted to the
gain.

Impersonating other people (police detectives as PhD students) is
par for the course, as is exploiting the human fear for the lives of
loved family memebrs, compelling shared information and cooperation.

The passage of time is demonstrated by the design of vehicles, and
methods of production. But of a greater concern, is the total
evisceration of entire manufacturing lines, working man positions,
(welders, sheet metal operators, drivers, engineers, production line
technicians, schedulers, logistics, tool and die machinists, etc.)
in the USA today.

The service jobs today (measured in customers attended to, for
example) formerly could have been in a  unionized setting installing
windshields time and again.

Another evolution, over time, are the ghetto and modest origins of
many individuals back then, forced to leave home at an early age,
having evolved now to a more mainstream, more levelled demeanor,
with the exception of today's glorification of the gang lifestyle.

For this picture, the lack of music soundtrack works well, as the
audience only hears the music played in the bar itself, and not as
an overdub. The DVD has a standard wide-screen presentation, albeit
lacking subtitles.

The underworld is slightly mentioned, namely loan sharks at 15 % per
month, shot gun crews to take out the hot heads not falling in line,
not transcending that it's all about the glory of those at the top,
not at the bottom. Divide and conquer is another proven technique.",1232668800,,3663,4.996710526315789

One of the better films to address the plight of the working man, without ever crossing over into sentimentality or sensationalism.  These are real people with flaws and hopes and problems.

220783,5,6300182517,"A devastating, and great film, unfortunately more discussed than seen or known at this late date.

BLUE COLLAR is celebrated for a number of reasons - the casting is inspired, subverting a standard Hollywood racial casting formula, and director/writer Paul Schrader (his directorial debut; Schrader was already known for writing TAXI DRIVER) gets unforgettable performances from three leads who apparently didn't much care for each other.  Richard Pryor's dramatic performance is oft-commented upon for a reason - his performance as Zeke is a tour-de-force; one of the great moments in recent (at least) American cinema.  A dozen movies every year are blurbed as ""unforgettable:"" this one actually earns the term.

And it does so the old-fashioned way - Schrader builds drama very carefully, with methodical pacing, sharp and realistic dialogue, and a documentary-real glimpse of post-industrial decay as it creeps into everyone's day-to-day existances: dirty and raw, filled with unsolveable moral conundrums and a simmering rage over expectations shattered.

Schrader's story - which at first might seem to be just another indictment of ""the system"" or big business (or unions) having their way with the working class - manages instead to inch towards some darker ironies: that mythologized working class may not neccessarily be any more loyal, or moral, than the upper classes that are - in fact - brazenly shafting them - and as the film moves into it's latter half, this nasty paradox, fleshed out with off-the-cuff gallows humor that Pryor (and also Keitel and Kotto) supplies turns BLUE COLLAR into something gripping and desperate.

And alas - yet another irony of BLUE COLLAR would be it's general unavailability with the passage of time, as the film has lost (unfortunately) less of its' relevance than one would have hoped.  A great film.

220784,4,6300182517,"I have a strong interest in the sharp contrast between actors Robert De Niro (and director Martin Scorsese and writer/director Paul Schrader) on the one hand and Sylvester Stallone on the other hand in their portrayal of similar themes - Vietnam war veterans, boxing champs - and labour union corruption. In Rocky (1976), Stallone's character is asked: ""Do you believe in the American dream?"" and a hesitant Rocky finally wins the heavyweight bout - the American dream came true not only for this fairy-tale character but also for a struggling Stallone as he received Oscar nominations for Best Actor and Best Original Screenplay. But the film critic Schrader did not even receive an Oscar nomination in the same screenplay category for the critically acclaimed Taxi Driver (1976) that (in contrast with the Oscar Winner for Best Picture, Rocky) did not receive a single Academy Award. Taxi Driver represented the polar opposite of Rocky - De Niro embodying the American nightmare.

Two years later, in 1978, we not only see the release of two movies on Vietnam that share the Oscar awards among them (The Deer Hunter and Coming Home) but also the release of two movies on labour union corruption that resemble the divergence of viewpoints on the American dream for workers. Scriptwriters Stallone and Schrader once again presented completely different views on blue-collar anti-heroes. After Stallone rewrote Joe Ezsterhas's script, F.I.S.T. leader Johnny Kovac came closer to resembling icon Walter Reuther than thuggish Jimmy Hoffa (on whom Ezsterhas based his original script). If Stallone had his way with director Norman Jewison, Kovac would not have suffered the ignoble end that finally prevailed. But Schrader's Blue Collar comes perhaps closer to what Ezsterhas originally envisioned for his uneconomically long and commercially unfeasible movie script: a poignant tale of the tragedy of union labour corruption.",1151452800,,1922,5.322368421052632

220788,5,6300182517,"Blue Collar is a not so sweet, good old fashioned, American tale of what happens when circumstances can push you into the shaded corners of the American utopia.

The acting is A-list through out this slice of Apple pie. Yaphet Kotto's portrayal as Smokey James is obviously the flaky crust of the film...arguably giving his best performance to date. Richard Pryor is at his most explosive and brilliant (the apples and filling of the trio) as auto-worker/family man Zeke Brown.  The multi-layered Jerry Bartowski played ever so solidly by Harvey Keitel holds his own among giants (of the time) and is obviously the sprinkle of cinammon and sugar needed to complete this cinematic masterpiece before being fired in the oven of hard times.

I recommend watching Paul Schrader's directorial debut after a long, hard days work to experience the full potency of the film; until then I'll leave you with a warm piece of Zeke's wisdom after telling off an I.R.S. agent in love with Uncle Sam:

""If I had the Navy and Marines behind me, I'd be a mutha***** too!"" -Zeke (Blue Collar)",1127952000,,1074,4.820652173913044
220802,4,6300182517,"Paul Schrader's first film as a director, Blue Collar, features Richard Pryor as one of three auto factory workers whose debts land them behind the eight ball.  The other two, Harvey Keitel and Yaphet Kotto, similarly cannot make enough at their jobs--or even with second jobs--to pay their bills, back taxes, and other expenses (like pay for a kid's braces).

So they plan to rob their union safe and being a noirish drama, things do not go as planned.  The film is a tough naturalistic look at working men who live day to day on their boring routines, their four-letter word language, their occasional escapes into drugs and sex, their TV dinners--complete with gravy over the watery mashed potatoes--their wives and kids, and their never-to-be-realized dreams of chucking everything.

Schrader does not spare the viewer anything.  We see just how these guys work inside the factory making Checker cabs--greasy, gritty, montonous jobs that numb the brain and don't pay enough to do much else but cover the mortgage and the fried chicken dinners and the utility bill.

Richard Pryor gives a startlingly vitriolic performance as Zeke and is absolutely riveting here.  Keitel (Jerry) and Kotto (Smokey) turn in rock solid performances, as do the supporting cast which includes Cliff de Young, Ed Begley Jr., Lane Smith, and an older Harry Bellaver (from the Naked City TV show; he was a good friend of my parents when he was alive in his later years.  My brother painted a portrait of him....)

It's too bad this DVD is now out of print.  It's a strong piece of dramatic filmmaking which, though made in 1978 and smacks of that era, is just as powerful today as it was then.  If you're a Richard Pryor fan you should definitely see this film; he's really great in it.

Definitely recommended.",1102723200,5,1791,4.836065573770492
220803,3,6300182517,"""Blue Collar"" is very unique. It captures the ugliness of industry and the futility of those who work in the factories of this country. Along with ""Norma Rae"" and ""Salt of the Earth"", it is one of the few movies to tackle such issues.
I can't give this movie a 5 star rating, because there were some portions which were either out of place (the love making scene) or very unrealistic (death by paintbooth?).
It was great to see the Checker factory (even if the movie writers moved it completely across the state within the story line). What an irony that Checker would be out of business within the next seven years after the filming of this movie. Getting to see the inside of the Checker factory was a true time capsule opportunity.
The transfer is average, so don't expect a wonderful anamorphic picture. However, it is unlikely this movie will ever get the royal treatment, so enjoy it as it is.",1078185600,,899,4.555555555555555
220804,5,6300182517,I don't understand why a movie this great isn't given much praise. This is by far the greatest performance from Richard Pryor. Excellent screenplay and performances from supporting cast. A nice transfer from the print to the DVD.,1068595200,3,229,5.052631578947368
220805,5,6300182517,"""Blue Collar"" is one of the great underrated American films of the 1970s.  It tells the story of three desperate, powerless men who work in a Detroit auto plant.  When they're not being suppressed by their soulless company, they're being duped by their arrogant, corrupt labor union.  Their collective desperation leads them to conduct an almost laughably amateurish robbery of the union safe.  Instead, what they find is evidence of widespread union corruption.  When they decide to blackmail the union, they find that three working men are no match for a ruthless, powerful labor union (and--in a larger sense--the American capitalist system).
Director Paul Schrader (who co-wrote the film with his brother Leonard) presents this tale in a gritty, realistic fashion.  Its bleak message is timeless, but the film is very much of the late 1970s, both in the sets (note the ugly orange sofas!) and in its infusion of drama and socio-political commentary.  Filmed in Detroit, Kalamazoo, and Los Angeles, you really get the sense of the hopeless desperation of these three men, who are dying to make a better life for themselves and their families, but are trapped in soul-crushing jobs at  the factory.
Harvey Keitel and Yaphet Kotto are their usual brilliant selves.  The true surprise for most viewers will be Richard Pryor in one of the very few dramatic roles he ever played.  He's hilarious, tragic, sympathetic, and--in the end--despicable all rolled into one.
The DVD version of ""Blue Collar"" contains interesting bios of the three stars and of Schrader, and a commentary from the director and a female journalist (who spends much of the time swooning over Keitel...particularly when he's in his underwear!).  Anyway, from the commentary, we learn that the 35-day shoot was an absolutely brutal one, especially since this was Schrader's first film as a director, and the fact that the three leads absolutely *HATED* each other.  Physical altercations and set walk-offs were apparently the norm here.  The fact that these three guys come off seeming like friends (for a time) illustrates their considerable acting ability and the magic of movies.
The commentary itself is helpful, but Schrader starts running out of steam (it's clear he doesn't really like this movie very much) toward the end.
The movie, however, never lets up.  ""Blue Collar"" is a terrific analysis of the American working man, and the illusory nature of the so-called ""American Dream"".",1045440000,15,2459,5.130325814536341
220806,4,6300182517,"An older movie, 1978, Blue Collar is a very insightful film. Richard Pryor plays Zeke Brown a hustler on the auto lines in an automotive plant. Harvey Keitel is Jerry Bartowski and Yaphett Kotto is Smokey James there are friends of Zeke's. When the bills start to pile up they come up with a plan to rob the local union office. There robbery goes wrong when they find a small amout of money in the safe and a notebook with illegal pay-offs.
Pryors Zeke is just the right amount of hustler and dreamer to make the roll work well for him. Pryor is known mostly for his stand up comic bit and his roles in comedy's like, Stir Crazy, See No Evil Hear No Evil,and Bustin Loose that a rare dramatic role one to behold. Keitel's Jerry is both a good father and a bad husband,but he is always looking out for his family. Kotto is really good as Smokey James, a imposing man on the line who seems not to worry about much untill things go wrong. Blue Collar works on a lot of levels becouse it looks at life in a factory like Norma Rea and not like Gung-Ho and for that it works well. The acting is just first rate and the story moves very well. The movie, although a drama, has some very funny moments in it and at times catch you off gaurd. A good film that is worth the watch.....",1018569600,2,1273,4.178861788617886
220807,5,6300182517,"This 1978 underrated classic is about three autoworkers. There's an honest and gritty realism to this story and the four-letter words and curses have a ring of authenticity to them, especially those of Richard Pryor whose foul language has been compared to raw sewage mixed with social insight. He's cast in the role of Zeke Brown, who owes money to the IRS and struggles to support his wife and three children.  Harvey Keitel plays Jerry Bawtowski, who also has trouble meeting his bills and can't even afford braces for his daughter.  And Yaphet Kotto, a physically imposing black man who is actually the son of a Cameroonian crown prince, plays the role of Smoky James, an ex-con who throws wild parties with drugs and women which serve as escape for the growing frustration of the men.  All three see the union as corrupt and decide to rob the union office.  They hope to get a few thousand dollars apiece.  Instead they get more than they bargained for and the series of events that follow lead to betrayal, and murder.

This is the directional debut for writer/director Paul Shrader, known for writing Taxi Driver, and he does a masterful job.  He puts the viewer right there on the assembly line, with the harsh clanging of heavy machinery and the constant pressure of the foreman to work faster and faster.  I could almost feel the heat and smell the machine oil and sweat of the workers.  Along with the physical labor, there's constant stress and this goes on day after day after day.  The subject is serious and the story real but the wisecracks provide comic relief and the story is fast paced and gripping. An excellent blues musical score enhancing the action underscores all this. And all the performances were so good that I forgot they were acting. Eventually, the dramatic unsettling conclusion leaves a lot to think about.

I loved this film and give it one of my highest ratings.  It's not pleasant or comfortable to watch but it sure is real.  And I learned more about the lives of assembly line workers than I ever thought I wanted to know.  It's especially poignant seeing it now because Kalamazoo has closed many of these plants since 1978 and this story now has historical perspective.  But this tight, riveting story that's an in-your-face gem about life on the assembly line says something important about the American Dream.  Don't miss it.",1007337600,26,2368,4.7530562347188265
220808,4,6300182517,"This, Paul Schrader's directoral debut, is a funny and some-times hard-hitting drama of three Detroit auto-workers who have to deal with the problems of money, friends, family, future,and much more while working on ""the line"".
The three main characters (Pryor, Kietel and Kotto) in a desperate need for cash, decide to rip off their own union and steal from the union safe. But instead of finding money, they find an incriminating ledger and from here they have to struggle with the rights and wrongs of what to do, where to turn and whether or not their friendship can sustain these dillema's.
The film contains stand-out performances from all three of the leads, which is not surprising having read that Schrader promised each one of them top billing to bind them to a contract and then told 'em it was equal top billing afterwards, obviously causing them to try and act the pants off each other. There is also a good level of detail in their day-to-day lives making the three seem like real characters and not just ciphers for the script. There are some really funny scenes (""What about my locker!!"" , the robbery , visit from the IRS etc.), as well as some great drama (the three-way conversation after the party, Kotto and the killers etc).
Overall, this is a low-key film with some high-ground ideas that even now ring pretty true. While I enjoyed most of this film there was a bit that reminded me a little bit too much of ""Mean Streets"" and the ending seemed somewhat forced, though it still ended the film on the right note.

220810,3,6300182517,"Screenwriter and director Paul Schrader's first effort, BLUE COLLAR was shot in 1977 and takes place in Detroit, city dedicated to one of our modern gods : the Car. Harvey Keitel, Yaphet Kotto and Richard Pryor are blue collars working in one of the churches of the God and they have the usual problems of their fellow companions : money, drugs and alcohol. They plan an hold-up and steal the notebook of the worker's union. Will they be able to handle union bosses, the F.B.I. and the killers sent to kill them ?
We have to thank Anchor Bay to give us the opportunity to rediscover BLUE COLLAR, presented in its original format and with the commentary of Paul Schrader. In fact, the director answers the questions of a courageous journalist about the movie because it seems that Schrader is not of the voluble kind. No english subtitles, so if you don't master Shakespeare's language perfectly, you will have some difficulty to follow Pryor's hysterical logorrhea.
BLUE COLLAR, in my opinion, is not a masterpiece but deserves to be seen at least once. The social point of the movie isn't the most original one : if you're poor and don't have connections, you better shut up and stay poor. But, we don't have so often the opportunity to watch movies taking place in car factories and Keitel, Pryor and Kotto give excellent performances. So, if you're curious or if you want to know better Paul Schrader who is, after all, one of the most interesting american screenwriters of the last thirty years, give BLUE COLLAR a try.
