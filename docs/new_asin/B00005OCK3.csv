Cushing. So as a kid i found these 2 movies to be great entertainment that

1641284,4,B00005OCK3,"I watched this with a Dr. Who fan who put it into perspective for me. What's great is that this film, an early cinematic remake of the second Daleks serial series, is finally on DVD. I've gotten used to the very low budget sets in the old Dr. Who shows, which are soon forgotten as one gets engrossed in the great stories. I just watched The Robots of Death on DVD, which has to have the all-time worst robot costumes but is nevertheless bone-chillingly suspenseful as the plot thickens.

One can't get too much of the Daleks, and this film is chock full of them-- lifesize and in full color. The spaceships are also well done. The thing I felt was that Peter Cushing could do more than stand around as a kind, grandfatherly Time Lord. Of course when he uses the gray matter he comes up with the day-saving plan. He simply doesn't seem very alien, whereas Tom Baker exuded weirdness in everything he did. Regardless, Dr. Who fans will welcome this release on DVD, and the chance to (re)visit the continuing saga of the Daleks.",1147132800,2,1026,4.4866310160427805
1641285,4,B00005OCK3,"This movie is good, simple to follow and adventurous. It has in it time travel, aliens, robots, spaceships, humor and action. It does look cheesy but that is another good thing in this movie, don't ask me why. Overall: VERY GOOD.",1033516800,7,229,4.609756097560975
1641306,4,B00005OCK3,"It's sort of Dr. Who, but not really.  It's Peter Cushing playing William Hartnell's Doctor.  They changed some things up from accepted Dr. Who cannon,  The Daleks are Daleks.

1641310,2,B00005OCK3,"Terrible packing on a cheap DVD-R (you can see the burn marks, not very classy). DVD needed massive resurfacing after arrival, the teeth that hold it in place had snapped off and floated around the case. 2 stars only because the 2 movies were there; it was a gift, so I can't rate audio or video, but I bet it was shoddy.

I love the Peter Cushing Who's and here, the first and sadly, last movies are both here, but oddly disc 1 is the second movie and disc two is the first! See these as part of the whomania craze that swept England in the 60's. Both are fun movies and one can't be a Who fan if they don't like the Daleks!",1415577600,,338,3.9130434782608696

1641337,5,B00005OCK3,"The Doctor left out in the cold.  Peter Cushing was hired to revisit some of the BBC serials on film during the first wave of Whomania, when Daleks first conquered the imagination of Britain's children.  While the production values and colour were a definite improvement over the BBC's cheap but imaginative sets, the scripts failed to pay full reverence to what was already becoming a serious cult.  Nevertheless, these are by no means the worst Dr. Who stories ever produced, and for those of us who flocked to see them in the cinema in that long-ago time, the sting of disappointment that William Hartnell and Carole Ann Ford were MIA has faded.  These movies may not be holy writ, but they are entertaining, nonetheless.",1404086400,6,724,4.814516129032258
1641338,2,B00005OCK3,"Even though I actually like the 2 films on this set, I give this release a I don't like it because I already owned the content on these discs.

The contents on this DVD set are exactly the same as the Anchor Bay boxed set from 2001.  Even the menus and logos are the same.  So, even though it says Lions Gate made this DVD, the contents were actually from a previous DVD release.  Since I already owned the Anchor Bay release, I basically paid for the same content twice.

This means that Daleks Invasion Earth 2150 is the same re-edited version that appeared on Anchor Bay's DVD.  The film starts with a prologue, then the opening titles, and the movie proper.  StudioCanal evidently thought this concept was too high for the average movie viewer.  So, they re-edited the beginning to start with the opening titles, then the prologue merged with the movie proper.  Unfortunately, the edit is blatantly obvious as the prologue ends with a musical cue that leads directly into the opening theme that plays over the titles.  So, this DVD version suddenly starts a musical sting that immediately ends.  There is NO need for such a stupid, sloppy edit.  Yet, manufacturers of DVD's feel the need and that they have the right to edit the contents they release on DVD.  We pay good money, we should get the product proper.

There is also evidence of extremely low quality control.  Disc 1 should have Doctor Who And The Daleks and Disc 2 should have Daleks Invasion Earth 2150 AD.  On this set, Disc 1 is actually Daleks Invasion Earth 2150 AD and Disc 2 has the first movie swapped around.  Plus, the DVD case insert is of rather poor quality.  The front image isn't very impressive or informative as to the contents.  The back is sparse with information about the 2 features.

So, if you don't own these 2 movies already on DVD, then this release, while it could be better, is, at least, some way to own the films.  It's the only way to own them now without buying the 13 year old Anchor Bay release.  The 2 movies proper are quite good, with Daleks Invasion Earth 2150 AD being the superior of the pair.",1403568000,11,2100,4.5
1641339,5,B00005OCK3,I REALLY ENJOYED THE DALEK COLLECTION AND IT WAS JUST WHAT I HAD WANTED.  IT WILL ALWAYS BE A CLASSIC AS FAR AS I AM CONCERNED.,1401667200,,127,3.8846153846153846
1641340,4,B00005OCK3,"This movie collection features both of the Peter Cushing Dr Who movies:  ""Dr. Who & the Daleks"", and ""Dr. Who: The Dalek Invasion of Earth 2150 ad.""

Both movies are digitally mastered with brilliant picture and sound, and feature a modest selection of extras for such a reasonably priced collection.  The only reason I rate this at 4 rather than 5 stars, is the disks are simply labled ""The Dalek Collection Disk 1"" and ""The Dalek Collection Disk 2.""  Oddly enough the second movie (Invasion... 1966) is on Disk 1, and the first movie (Daleks... 1965) is on Disk 2.

One other note: This DVD does not contain any liner notes, and the packaging description is minimal.  If you want this simply for the movies, this is a great buy, but if you are someone who collects movie sets for packaging features as well, you may want to look into the newer blu-ray releases.",1399075200,8,863,4.571428571428571
1641341,4,B00005OCK3,"These two full length movies differ greatly from the Series.  Doctor Who is from Earth and not a Time Lord. he invents the TARDIS and instead of calling it The TARDIS he just calls it TARDIS.  It does not make the the traditional sounds we are used too.  Peter Cushing makes an interesting Doctor.  The movies are fun to watch.  The second movie, The Invasion of Earth features actor Bernard Cribbins, who later appeared in the Rebooted series as Donna's Grandfather.  Good Fun.",1397692800,,478,4.698795180722891
1641342,5,B00005OCK3,"And his name is Peter Cushing. This was my introduction, and everything after has seemed just sad and lame. As if the mere presence of Mr. Cushing wasn't enough to make this a classic (he is always grand, regardless of what he is in), as it does not fall into the strict canon of Dr. Who's story arc, it is even better... a kind of alternate universe Dr. Who.",1392681600,,359,4.217391304347826
1641343,5,B00005OCK3,"Growing up in the United Kingdom in the 1970s and 1980s, the classic Dr. Who series was a staple part of my television diet. I didn't care about the cardboard sets and painfully lame special effects. One of my chief guilty pleasures at the time were the two Peter Cushing feature films of the 1960s that featured the character and were shown regularly on BBC2. In particular the movie of ""Daleks Invasion Earth 2150 A.D."" with its vibrant colors, exciting sequences, and one of my favorite actors Peter Cushing in the title role. I would watch it whenever it appeared on BBC2 and read and reread the novelization. Shortly after I emigrated to the U.S. in the mid-1990s I picked up a DVD copy which I watched over and over and even purchased the audiobook of the adaptation. I hoped to one day get to see the William Hartnell series on which the movie is based. Now, over three decades later that dream was realized when I saw it on DVD and the reaction - overwhelming disappointment. It's not just the shoestring budget or the low-quality black and white picture, I knew that both those would be elements in the television series. It's the plodding plot, the cringe-inducing lines and terrible acting. It's obvious comparing the two productions that the weaknesses in the series were evident to the movie makers because they excised all the superfluous elements and made a leaner and more exciting production. Having had the endure the Hartnell version (an actor I have long admired for his non-Dr Who work), I'll stick with the Cushing version.",1392249600,,1545,4.74721189591078

1641359,5,B00005OCK3,I love The Doctor. The first time i ever remember watching him was on the Sci-Fi Chanel. Years ago they had Tom Baker episodes back to back with The original Dark Shadows at 10 o'clock in the morning every Monday-Friday.,1375833600,,220,4.525

1641363,4,B00005OCK3,"This is the 2 movies done before the TV series I believe. I like Peter Cushing as the Doctor. The only thing is the Doctor in these movies is not the alien time lord, he is just a forward inventing scientist . Still good flicks.",1356739200,,228,4.088888888888889
1641364,3,B00005OCK3,"Better yet, were it not for the Daleks' cry of ""Exterminate!"", just mute the sound altogether.  The dialogue's not that great anyway; but it's the music that's absolutely ear piercingly horrendous. Maybe they were trying to mimic the ""Doctor Who"" electronic sound; but whatever they were trying, it came across as blackboard scratching with a vengeance.  That's a shame, because the film itself was quite good.  The setting and story both followed the original ""The Dalek Invasion of Earth"" almost scene by scene - with the exception that the ending was actually almost believable.  Whereas the original ending was a hodge-podge of incredibly far-fetched events, this ending at least pretended to be ""scientific.""  And, as others have noted, there was way too much gratuitous slapstick (for the kids, no doubt). All in all, I'd give the visuals and the story-line 4-Stars; but the music drug it down to a 3-Star movie at best.",1251590400,3,926,5.026143790849673
1641365,1,B00005OCK3,"The Dalek IE movie is as good as I remembered when I was given a VHS recording from my uncle back in 1989.  Peter Cushing is as good a DW as any.  But the DVD is crap in a hand basket(considering I was fool enough to get the boxed 3 set) when you even so much as ""touch"" your remote, it switches to that dumb french language and you can't switch it back(even if you go and select ""english"") you can reboot your player and cannot browse chapters without the stupid revert to french language coming up!  How lame!

The plain label set is the same thing as the original set, but just burned onto DVD-R discs.

The movies are an adaptation of the TV episodes, probably to introduce the Daleks to anyone who hadn't seen the TV show. By showing the kind of enemies the Doctor faces, it could gain interest in the series. After all, the show was originally meant to be a kids series.",1439683200,,566,4.495145631067961
