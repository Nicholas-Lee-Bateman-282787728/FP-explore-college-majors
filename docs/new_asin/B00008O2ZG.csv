1854953,1,B00008O2ZG,"Although Gary Dourdan looked fantabulous in this movie, I thought it was one of the worst movies ever done by Roy Campanella II.  First of all, the love scenes came too quickly, it didn't even make sense.  Second of all, how dumb could that girl get.  First she didn't know who those people were chasing her than she knew who the people were.  It was like Lady, make up your mind.  This was just as bad as that movie ""Ritual"".  This is a waste. Do not buy it please",1123372800,,465,4.168539325842697
1854954,2,B00008O2ZG,"Watched this movie and the script and the acting was bad.  Fortunately I didn't read the book which judging by the other reviews was a good thing because I would have been disappointed.
Athough Gary Dourdan is a reasonable actor, in this he was terrible.",1089763200,,254,4.644444444444445

7985823,5,B00008O2ZG,"I really enjoyed this film. I watched it several times. I liked the chemistry/energy between the two lead characters. The classic ""hero-saves-damsel- in-distress"" film but with an Afrocentric flavor. Wendy Davis has an unusual brand of beauty. The more you see her, the better she looks. Tricky plot, plenty of ""edge-of-your-seat"" drama/action. A good one to add to your collection.",1266364800,,382,5.383333333333334
