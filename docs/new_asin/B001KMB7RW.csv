3666519,5,B001KMB7RW,"superb story and believable acting.  gay film makers can take a lesson from this movie.  a genuinely interesting story that draws you in and makes you feel something for the main character.  lots of texture and levels to his life and his story.  a bleak, yet interesting setting..  it really helped to convey his loneliness and isolation.  and I was genuinely heartbroken at how his antagonist torments him.

I wish the cinematography had not been so dark.  Those night scenes are really hard to see..  seemed to be mostly black with a little bit of light and movement.

Still... this is a wonderful film and I strongly recommend it.",1439596800,8,633,4.724770642201835
3666520,5,B001KMB7RW,I really enjoyed this movie. Simple and at times a little difficult to follow but very well made.,1404950400,,97,4.444444444444445
3666521,4,B001KMB7RW,"First, I gave it 4 stars and not five because of what I felt was an unresolved ending.  On the other hand, that ending is consistent with the film's depiction of the misery and tedium of life in one of Argentina's river deltas.  American reviewers complain about the lack of content; I must point out members of other cultures not Hollywoodized to the point of stupefaction may find this film quite subtle.  It discovers homoerotic desire where one would least expect it: among the lower classes who have little time for anything but the business of surviving.  It exposes homophobia as a mask for such desire.  And, in a ""rape"" scene, it turns the tables by having the ""rapist"" and the ""victim"" act out their desire for each other. I recommend it, but only for those who have realized that film reflects and critiques culture.",1243814400,15,827,4.675862068965517
3666522,1,B001KMB7RW,"I suppose if one has the sensibilities of an upriver, up-jungle Argentinean, this film might be interesting.  But, someone like myself----raised in US culture----will likely not find it so.  Primarily a work of pastoral, jungle river scenes and little dialogue, you won't find much in the way of action.  And if you're a fan of the gay film genre, you'll find little of ""that action"" here (and what there is, lighting makes hard to see).  Probably you will have to be, or ""think"" you are, an aesthete if you are going to enjoy this movie (and perhaps playing to that trait explains the reasoning behind the use of all-Black&White photography).

Maybe in Argentina this film might be ""ground breaking"" (DVD back cover ""speak""), but in this country there are many of us it will not speak to.  Like many third-world and near third-world produced movies, their directors / writers think they're producing something of real substance and interest.  Unfortunately, in almost all cases, outside the boundaries of those locations, that is not the case at all----even though US gay video production companies releasing these films would have you think otherwise.

Providing me nothing new in its glimpses into human behavior, this DVD is a ""toss away"" for me, but..........if you see enough of yourself in this lead character's demeanor, it may be a ""keeper"" for you.",1234051200,3,1358,4.977876106194691
3666523,3,B001KMB7RW,"The lush river jungle in the northern part of Argentina is the setting for this award winning 2007 film from that country.  The main character is Alvaro, who fishes and cuts reeds for his meager living.  Beyond that, he coaches the local successful youth soccer team, and is otherwise a loner, not surprising for a gay man in such an isolated area.  Whatever trysts he manages to have are with strangers passing through the area, usually arriving on the area's water taxi, ""La Len"" (""The Lion"").

El Turu is the owner and operator of ""La Leon,"" which locals depend upon for their mail and trips to town, which gives him a perceived position of power and influence.  He is fiercely hostile to any outsiders who arrive, and has tormented Alvaro as well, having figured out that he was a homosexual.  However, whether the setting is a big city in the USA, or a remote jungle village in Argentina, it's still a fair assumption that the person who most vocally opposes gay or lesbian likely does so because he is insecure about his own sexuality.

""La Len"" is a tough film to rate.  It deserves the many awards it has received for its groundbreaking (for Argentina) depiction of an unapologetic gay man, portrayed in a (mostly) positive and non-stereotypical manner.  The photography is likely impressive to an art film buff, with its stark, barely-lit black-and-white photography with a slight sepia tone.  The director lets his story be told by actions rather than dialogue (which obviously makes the relatively few subtitles easy to follow), leaving long passages in absolute silence while we try to gauge the characters' thoughts.  By US standards, this gets more than a bit tedious and boring, the poorly-lit scenes and lack of dialogue make it hard to follow, and the film really doesn't cover any new ground, other than retelling a familiar type of story in a new place. There is also a rape scene that bothers me, not because of the violent act, but due to the reaction of the victim.  I can't give it more than three stars out of five.

Not rated for US viewing, but would be a hard ""R"" due to nudity and sexual situations. DVD has no extras other than trailer (in Spanish) and Scene Selections.  Region 1 DVD has English sub-titles, which cannot be turned off.",1232409600,16,2265,4.70126582278481
3666524,3,B001KMB7RW,Black and white film. Violent. Really didn't like it.,1466467200,,53,5.0
3666525,1,B001KMB7RW,"Maybe 1/2 of a star at best, I am not sure why they bothered to make this film.  The dialog is non existent, the cinematography is terrible, the characters are in a trance.",1465171200,,172,4.212121212121212
3666526,2,B001KMB7RW,"All of these gay movies have a very poor story line, poor acting and the reception (at least on a lap top) is rather poor.",1463961600,,122,3.92
3666527,2,B001KMB7RW,"Not a bad concept, but shot way too dark and hard to see. Lagged at times and obviously done on a low budget.",1463443200,,109,3.782608695652174
3666528,1,B001KMB7RW,"Much of this was photographed at night in he dark with no added light so I could never tell who was in the scene. It might have been a very good movie and it may have made sense to those who saw it on a large theater screen, but it didn't work on a  hand held tablet.",1462406400,,267,3.6842105263157894
3666529,2,B001KMB7RW,Very dark film hard to view.  Very slow story.  Viewing another culture was the most interesting part of the film.,1461715200,,114,4.65
3666530,1,B001KMB7RW,OMG Wasn't there color film back in 2008 and why was it so dark?  Isn't there sunlight there in Argentina?  I watched this from beginning to end and it still was discombobulated to me.  Usually foreign films are slow and dark so I was sort of expecting it in this.  But this was really something else.  I would give this a minus 1 star if I could just for making me waste my time watching.,1458172800,,389,4.133333333333334

3666533,1,B001KMB7RW,I should get my money back from this zero quality movie,1445212800,,55,4.090909090909091
3666534,4,B001KMB7RW,"In a very quiet way, this was a great movie.  I had no idea what to expect but it intrigued me so I gave it a shot.  I was glad I did.  It's English subtitled but so much was said through expression and atmospheric sense, and there wasn't a whole lot of dialogue, so that was no big deal.  The lead character was excellent and did a superb job.  In fact, the entire cast was great in an understated way.  This is also an interesting cultural experience as it's set in an environment and part of the world I'm not familiar with.  I will warn you it's in black and white, but after getting used to that, I realized it added to the movie rather than took away from it.  The theme of the movie is modern but the setting isn't.  It all creates for a very interesting experience.  I really liked this movie and am sure I will watch it again at some point.",1444867200,5,849,4.090909090909091
3666535,2,B001KMB7RW,"Shot to darkly.  I guess this was to create a mood but it, in my opinion just made the plot difficult to follow.  The film became a chore to watch as it unfolded.",1444262400,,162,3.878787878787879
3666536,4,B001KMB7RW,"It's a somber film from a world of experience with which Americans will be little familiar, dark, spare, with a kind of fateful inevitability about it.  I'd recommend simply that you look at the summary details and decide whether it's for you or not.  The ""homosexual"" aspect of it is really a subordinate theme--it's the isolation, the monotony, the lack of human variety that matter more.  Brutality and hypocrisy and loss emerge naturally from what is, after all, a fairly impoverished world, one that progressively impoverishes the people in it.  The ftbol games are not enough to create the more humanly rich life of which the river dwellers and reed cutters and miserable migrants have been deprived.  Save it for a thoughtful moment.",1444176000,2,740,4.983739837398374
3666537,2,B001KMB7RW,"This film was a total bore for me in that it was overreaching in being 'artsy' and the main character was more background than foreground! And why was Turu shot by those low life characters?  Was it because of his rape of Alvaro or for some other reason. In truth, for some viewers this was probably a masterpiece of transcendental art and will watch it again, again and again!  For me, I'll take the light fluffy stuff and, at least, enjoy it for its shallowness!",1443225600,,464,4.447058823529412

3666542,3,B001KMB7RW,"The movie had some visually stunning aspects but because it was b&w, it was often times hard to see,  I think it was an interesting movie but it was kind of vague as to what was going on. Even though I was not all that sure about the plot lines, I think it is still worth seeing...if only for an interesting view of another place and time.",1441065600,5,339,4.059701492537314

8315338,3,B001KMB7RW,"I actually watched this movie twice, the second time much more was revealed about the plot and mindset of the people in that rural village.  The plot and interactions of the varying characters was portrayed very well.  The movie however was shot mostly in the dark, so dark you could not make out anything whatsoever. Very troubling since to get the point you gotta see whats happening.  Was an OK film.  Would have been great if there was  more lighting in the film.",1499299200,,467,4.578313253012048
