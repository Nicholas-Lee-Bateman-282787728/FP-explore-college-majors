6382621,5,B00JPFTP52,Great DVD for TMNT fans. Ten good episodes ranging from season 1 to season 10 that will definitely bring back some memories. Not my personal favorite episodes but still a great addition to any TMNT collector and/or fan and also a good introduction for those not used to the original series.

8652729,5,B00JPFTP52,"This is a great collection of the original Ninja Turtles series. It has ten episodes, from seasons 1-5. The episodes are all over the place, in terms of chronology, so it can get a bit confusing as to what situation Shredder and Krang are trying to work themselves out of. Overall, a great compilation disc.

1. Planet of the Turtleoids - season 5
2. Night of the Rogues - season 1
3. Cowabunga Shredhead - season 3
4. Superhero For a Day - season 4
5. Turtles at the Earths Core - season 3
6. Curse of the Evil Eve - season 2
7. The Turtles and the Hate - season 4
8. The Big Blow Out - season 3
9. My Brother, the Bad Guy - season 5
10. Shredder & Splintered - season 1
