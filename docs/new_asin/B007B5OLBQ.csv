8605123,5,B007B5OLBQ,"After the 'tour de force' of Rock Symphonies, going back to his classical roots was the best and the more natural thing he could do. And again, he did it all soooo well! I simply am in love with great classical music since the first note I heard. It's an open secret to say that Passion is David's middle name, and this time again, he pushes his passion even more further in playing Kreisler spraying sparkles all over him. He simply radiates! At the ultimate Beethoven concerto, the whole orchestra embraces his playing like one perfect whole. Shivers on my spine! The only lukewarm moment is the 'flat' enthusiasm of the audience. As a passionate North American fan, I hardly understand this - How can you stand still after such a rush of love! And what about this well-constructed documentary of his short but wholesome life, with personal videos and all. All the people interviewed are of course enamoured and full of praise, but the very beautiful Mrs. Garrett is the most humble and frank. Sad that daddy decided not to be part of it; I would have loved to know more about the craftman behind this awesome passionate musician that has become David. All in all, an absolute must buy if you wish to learn how to fall in love with classical music and David's great talent and charisma!",1341187200,,1288,4.604347826086957
