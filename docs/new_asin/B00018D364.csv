8007648,5,B00018D364,"This superbly acted film by English director Mike Leigh (""Naked"") is a bleakly funny slice-of-life tale about two couples mired in somewhat depressing routines. Manville and Davis are delightfully dour as a bickering couple trying to decide whether or not to have a baby, while Kelly and Duncan's moribund, dysfunctional relationship is alternately hilarious and gut-wrenching to observe. But the film's greatest asset is Blethyn, whose showstopping meltdown on the Butchers' staircase is the work of a champion actress--one fully in touch with the depths of despair. ""Grown Ups"" is a sweetly madcap gem for the feeble-minded fussbudget in all of us.",1183680000,9,650,5.382352941176471
8007649,5,B00018D364,"I don't want to sound like I'm patronising your reviewer 'displacedhuman' but I found his/her concise review of Mike Leighs GROWN UPS quite superb. I watched this play in disbelief in the late 1970s when it was first televised on the BBC. When they repeated it in the early 80s I taped it on Betamax (RIP)! Then when my Betamax recorder finally expired I had the tape transferred to VHS. This is without doubt, the funniest, darkest and most touching of all Mike Leighs films. All the actors are superb, but Brenda Blethyns performance is stratospheric. AT LAST it's on DVD !! Goodness knows what anyone who isn't British will make of it, but try it, you just might like it too.",1096675200,8,678,4.565573770491803
