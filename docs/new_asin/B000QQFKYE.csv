2839346,5,B000QQFKYE,"I strongly disagree with the person who says this movie has no plot. I just think it takes mental effort to stay focused and understand it. I have only seen it once so far, and quite frankly I was fading out during the last hour, so I def. need to watch it again, but it did make a lot of sense to me. I'm sure it will make sense in a different way to someone else.

The movie is pretty staightforward until the scene where Laura is having a romantic moment with her movie costar. She tells him ""This is just like a scene from the movie."" and then realizes that the cameras are rolling, and gets disoriented. At this point the move really breaks from the reality thus far, which I appreciated since that moment was so awkward and tense.

The rest is very dreamlike. I have always thought that Eraserhead is the closest representation to my dreams than anything else in real life, and this picks up on that a bit. We see some of Nikki's dreams, where I believe she is dreaming about her lover's old flings all in one room. Her story runs parallel to the actors who tried to film this movie in Poland and died during filming, and their story is shown a bit. The male actor dies later on, which I had been anticipating. We also see the story that the woman told in the beginning panning out.

It is confusing and I need to watch it again. I highly recommend watching it in the theatre first since Mr.  Lynch is aware of his theatre audience and plays of off this. There are points of it that may never make sense to me, and some storylines that I don't quite see how they fit in. But I figure if I can anticipate events before they occur then it can't make no sense. This is a movie I feel I could talk about for hours, if only someone was willing to talk about it with me. It is quite an experience, I love the cinematography, the intense close-ups, the dark colors, the actors. I enjoy taking something to think about away from it.

A great movie.",1180569600,46,1946,4.220430107526882
2839347,5,B000QQFKYE,"`Inland Empire' is full of surprises. Convoluted and suspenseful we follow the story lines of successful actress Nikki (Laura Dern) who is waiting for the results of a tryout for a new Hollywood movie, `On High in Blue Tomorrows`. Soon she is visited by her new Polish immigrant neighbor. In her nosey way she pries information, but also intensely warns her of bad omens. She foretells that Nikki will obtain the part she has tried out for, but the story, is a remake and a murder will take place. She intensely relates folk tales, including one about a girl at the marketplace in an alley behind the palace who loses her memory. ""Forgetfulness happens to us all,"" she relates. She also incessantly speaks of ""unpaid bills"" in a scathing fashion. Rebuffing the neighbor's pointed comments, the actress asks the suspicious elderly woman to leave.

The movie fast-forwards to the next day as the woman foretells in the narration. The gypsy fades out with a vengeance. Nikki gets the part, and on the set we meet Devon (Justin Theroux), her dashing, handsome co-star. The director (Jeremy Irons) facilitates a script reading where he relates that the film is indeed a remake; one where a murder took place and was allegedly cursed from the start.

From here the movie weaves its way through many scenes. Nikki's husband warns the young co-star of the consequences of sneaking out with his actress wife. Some feature Southern characters Billy and Sue in the movie, but they are so closely connected to their actual lives that we begin to lose our own grip on reality. Eerily suspenseful scenes show (Nikki or Sue) walking through a house in bewildered trepidation. Then, we are transported to the lives of the screen couple in the backyard. Next, we find them in Poland during the dead of winter. In one scene the actors are having an affair; in another the characters are. To spice things up, we get a play with actors in rabbit costumes performing an absurdist comedy. At certain points, just when we feel grounded, a woman is watching all the drama on television in her dark apartment.

The developments of `Inland Empire' are intriguing. Like `French Lieutenant's Woman' (significantly also with Jeremy Irons) there's a movie story mixed within a real story. Unlike `FLW' it isn't easy to tell where one story ends and the other begins. In ways like Altman's `The Player,' we have to decide what components are real and which are not. One finds oneself asking many questions while watching the movie. Which parts are from the movie? Which parts are real life? Are the scenes in Poland real or are they components of the original film? Is this all seen through a viewer's eyes or is it all part of the movie? Is she crazy or is her character crazy? Surely, the theme of misogyny is at the forefront as we come across prostitutes and male abuse. Not to mention the claustrophobic fishbowl existence of celebrity life.  One thing is for certain, the movie is assembled expertly. It comes across like a mansion full of mirrors--like a fun/haunted house. Not everyone will like the exit strategy (Afterall, who likes hitting the pavement after a funhouse?) but it certainly provides a strange and intense experience.",1180051200,115,3211,4.822141560798548
2839348,5,B000QQFKYE,"haha,this film really pissed off quite a few people so i've heard.i saw it at the oak street cinema in mpls with friends in march and was very satisfied while they were not.it's funny too,because the folks who fancied themselves ""artsy"" were the first to dismiss it as ""too long,too over-the-top,and too meaningless.""(i admit to keeping the abstract nature of it a secret from them all so i wouldn't have to go alone though.)anyways,to the film itself:formalism+surrealism=the best experimental neo-noir experience i've had in many a moon! simply because of how long it is(3+ hours)i even found myself droning in a trance at some points--BUT--this works to the film's advantage(with the dvd format at least)because you'll be able to stop it at basically any point you because tired of it,start it up a few hours/days later,and not ""miss"" anything.if there is a ""random play"" option on most dvd players it would totally work to suffle the chapters and still be able to not make sense of it or find abstract meaning(that is,if david gives us chapers on the dvd which he normally doesn't.)i'll try to wrap this up now as simply as possible:inland empire is unmistakable a david lynch film(fits the auteur's overe quite nicely),it's mainly dark with character's finding a sickness inside themselves and thier surroundings,it's like mulholland drive as a mosaic--suffled beyond recognition,it pays homage to various films(rear window,sunset boulevard,etc),and i can only assume that it was as fun and interesting for lynch to create as it was for me as a viewer to watch.as per usual,the asthetics and chirascirro are top-notch! can't wait to see what david has in store for us on the dvd!

*edit:10/24/07

The dvd:
I finally got around to watching the extras disc last week. This dvd set has so much to offer;thanks Mr. Lynch for adding so much into it. The biggest thing that I noticed was that the film has half the power that it did on the big sceen when translated through my 17-inch Toshiba at home. My system speakers didn't honor the sounds too well eathier,but hey,I suppose that proves that Inland Empire has another power to it. I wasn't disapointed with the film itself after seeing it for the second time,but I wished that my toys could have held up their part of the bargain better. It's interesting to think that a film which was shot on dv  looks its best when shown on a large screen!

The extras were very cool and it was interesting(and a shock) to see that Mr. Lynch isn't the ""24/7 hunkey-dorey boy scout"" which so many people pigeonhole him into. He's a normal guy with a fully-developed imagination!

I never knew about quinoa before seeing this and I'll be getting much more protien via this rich grain! Haven't tried it yet but it looks good.

""More things that happened"" was fun,and I can see why the scenes didn't make the final film,but they stand on their own just fine.

I should also mention that I had no problems at all with the dvd freezing on me,or anything else mentioned by others. My copy seems to work fine.

With that said,I think that INLAND EMPIRE is still the imaginative masterpeice I claimed it was after seeing it at the Oak Street Cinema. Hollywood can't make their junk movies with ""junk"" dv,but smart film-makers can get around the problems of digital video to create amazing films for a relatively low cost. I'd rather view a smart film with a few minor visual quirks than be forced to sit through conventional factory movies made by dunces--even if they happen to be shot on high-def. The art of film reverts back to the grainy place it was born;how fitting and awesome!

And no David,I won't be putting it on my effing phone.",1179878400,53,3672,4.761006289308176
2839349,5,B000QQFKYE,"This sure is a movie. It was produced and directed and stuff. There are so many actors in this movie. So neat.

I don't know what else to call it, but a movie. I hope to see it some day. I sure do love movies, and that is what this is.",1179878400,6,235,3.607843137254902
2839350,4,B000QQFKYE,"I asked my friends to go see this movie and they declined, because they didn't want to see a 3 hour movie directed by David Lynch. I think you really have to be a movie buff or film maker to be able to want to see this movie and enjoy it at the same time. It's a total anti-Hollywood movie in many ways. One would wonder if Lynch is attempting career suicide to do a movie that is hardly marketable. I don't think this film was intended to please or draw in any mainstream audiences, maybe that's why there was a group of 5 or 6 audiences seated in front of me walked out after one hour. As for me, I went to see this movie for two obvious reasons, one would be for the bizarre and unconventional work of Lynch, and the other would be to see the many characters played by Laura Dern, who no doubt turned in an Oscar-caliber performance.

I really don't know how to explain the plot of the film, because it's like watching a dream or nightmare that's filled with wierd, twisted, imaginative scenes all randomly edited out of chronological order, so it was confusing to follow it. To distinguish the different characters played by Laura Dern was by her wardrobe and makeup and performances at times. I was bored by some of the scenes, but the film was consistently moody, creepy atmoshpere and music score. Some elements in this film confused me like the bunny characters, and the Germen/Polish characters that occasionally appeared and then vanished in a scene didn't make sense. Then there is  a bunch of imaginery dancing prostitutes that added some wierd sexual element to the plot. There was a very memorable scene that served comic relief where the homeless Black woman talks to the homeless Japanese girl while witnessing Laura's character bleeding to death. The scene was so funny even though it was a very tragic moment at the same time.

What I didn't like about this film was that it was so home video like because it was shot on digital camera, maybe Lynch intended to make this film looked raw in a way. The supporting actors turned in striking performances. I thought Jeremy Iron was underused and didn't have much of a challenging role. Laura Dern's performance is truly mesmerizing, it's so multi-layered. Honestly, I don't think I am not the only one who feels the need to watch it again to understand this film better.",1178409600,,2334,4.56563245823389
2839351,5,B000QQFKYE,"I'm not sure what David wanted to accomplish,if anything with this film,but I think that film students could definately learn things from it. For one,this film PROVES that anyone(with talent)can create an interesting,stylish film without a billion-dollar hollywood budget. I just started taking film courses in college this year,so the entire time I was transfixed to the screenwhen I saw it in the theater I would find myself stepping back from the experience to do quick physical/psychological dissections of what I saw and felt:this film allows the viewer a smorgasborg of oppurtunities for this! Some of the scenes in it which were only a minute or so long actually carried more to them than some of the lengthly ones,which I found cool. Anyway,great experimental,neo-noir/psychological-horror film which any fan of film as an art should enjoy.

Rhino is said to have the dvd on the way June 8th or so,""loaded with extras"" as Lynch himself said!",1178409600,,949,5.122580645161291

2839353,5,B000QQFKYE,"I watched ""Inland Empire"" in a theater once.  Since then, I have formed my own interpretation and read countless others.  Some people want to dismiss the film because there is no linear plot, and they don't ""get it"".  My opinion is that if a film lends itself to discussion (which requires thinking), it is a great film.  I enjoy a film that stays with me, and ""Inland Empire"" had done just that since March.  I can't wait to buy it on DVD, and watch many more times to see what I can pick up that I missed the first time.  Definitely worth at least one viewing, but probably many more.",1177891200,3,586,4.281818181818182
2839354,2,B000QQFKYE,"I doze off for all of three seconds watching David Lynch's new film, INLAND EMPIRE, and it must have been a crucial three seconds, for when I looked back at the screen, I was as lost as a character out of Lynch's amnesiac LOST HIGHWAY. We can go on about the freedom an artist possesses to express himself, (Lynch worked without any studio interference on INLAND), and how an empty cinematic plate is to the film director what an empty canvas is to an artist, but when all is said and done, boring is boring is boring, and boy oh boy, this is boring. I don't need a linear plotline to keep me attentive to a Lynch film, the music, sound, and images can speak to me on a level more rewarding than a story line, but just how many times were we to watch Laura Dern's (producer and star), character, walk down a dark Lynchian hall way, and slowly open a secret door to reveal another secret hallway and another secret door, and another, and another, ... in the meantime we get every Lynch trick and treat known to film, (men talking in silly voices, cigarettes burning holes in the sky, neighbors with clairvoyant messages, etc.), losing impact like an unfinished highway, without however, a silent dwarf, whose appearence may have signaled the close of this murky film, and with, a TV studio sitcom of two-footed, human-like, living room rabbits, which become a welcome relief of familiarity and order, when interrupting Dern's endless bewildered quest.

The way I see it, in Lynch's vision of INLAND EMPIRE, there is an imperfect parallel universe fighting each other for survival, and such conflict is the cause of all violence in the world. It's as good an idea as the snake tempting Eve with the apple. So we have Alice, (Dern), not so much falling down a rabbit hole, as being dragged through one, and then things get peculiar and peculier. The film often drifts towards a group of T & A gifted women, (picture a poverty stricken Spice Girls), who may be the victims of assault and murder, and may be consoling Dern's character in an afterlife, or a parallel universe, or posssibly they're really there in Dern's apartment, lying around like a Penthouse photo shoot and dancing to Little Eva's ""Locomotion"". Or maybe they're just a delusion. Or maybe they're simply the biggest T's and the best A's ever seen in a Lynch film.

Cameos galore here; Bill H. Macy, Diane Ladd, (Laura Dern's mom), Nastassja Kinski; you just want to stop one of them and say, do something before you leave! Don't leave me alone with Laura! I can't bear another handsome close-up and dreary speech! What about those rabbits? Why not bring The Spice Girls into the rabbit sitcom? That might work. Hugh Hefner could enter and say, ""It's just a rabbit, dear.""

I'm out the door of the theatre and there's a sidewalk sign from the club next door reading, HALF-PRICE COCKTAILS WITH MOVIE TICKET STUB. I am SO there, and in pure Lynchian fashion, me and the dwarf enter our own parallel universe.",1177804800,11,2969,4.640684410646388
2839355,5,B000QQFKYE,"Shot on digital video, rather than film, David Lynch's ""INLAND EMPIRE"" takes him out of the mainstream, if you can call ""Mulholland Drive"" and ""Blue Velvet"" mainstream, into the realm of pure Independent film making: producing films with little money and without any outside interference.
At the beginning of this film Laura Dern plays Nikki Grace, a diva-like actress frantically waiting for word from the producers of a film that she would like to do. This part of the film is very straightforward but Lynch straightforward which means that 1+1 almost never equals 2. This is where Nikki/Laura begins. By the end of the film she/they are unhappy, bored, frantic, living in a one-story, California Ranch-style house in what looks to be the Inland Empire (Riverside, Corona): the fastest growing section of Southern California. Does this have any significance as far as Lynch is concerned or is his Inland Empire one of the mind? I don't really know for sure and in Lynch's world this ambiguity makes the proceedings troubling, puzzling and fascinating all at the same time. Rational ambivalence is called for when dealing (as in viewing and describing) with Lynch's films except maybe for the almost straightforward and appropriately named, ""Straight Story.""
In regards to Laura Dern: as Jeanne Moreau was for Godard, as Deneuve was for Bunuel and Truffaut, as Audran was for Bunuel and Chabrol, Dern is Lynch's muse: the actress he chooses to personify his dreams and nightmares. Dern is neither a plush toy nor a sexpot-type of actress. She is tall, imposing yet warm, emotionally available, argumentative, brittle, ready and willing to give any man or woman a run for their money in life as well as in bed. Look to Lynch's recurring choice of Dern for hints as to what is going on his volatile mind and his brilliant films.
There are moments of great beauty and clarity here for Lynch is nothing if not a superior artist capable of making his striking images, film moments and whole scenes effective and thoughtful as well as funny and scary as all hell.
""I Don't Get IT""......"" You Got IT!"" (as quoted from"" Premiere"" which also states that Lynch himself has explained ""INLAND EMPIRE"" as making ""perfect sense."") is the mantra of Lynchists (or Lynchpins) and in regards to ""INLAND EMPIRE"" this phrase seems wholly appropriate.",1177632000,10,2331,4.964194373401535
2839386,2,B000QQFKYE,"Up until Inland Empire, the Straight Story was the least recommendable of Lynch's films. The Straight Story was easy to follow and well-acted, but the drama wasn't stimulating enough to hold me for two hours. To date, Inland Empire is the worst of his films. It's disjointed, meandering, and disproportionately imaginative to warrant a three-hour run time. Although Mulholland Drive clocks in at two and a half hours, it's compelling and suspenseful however confounding it turns out to be for the viewing majority. Inland Empire feels like an attempt to bring back the magic of Mulholland Drive, but it's too saturated with experimentalism to be cohesive, fluid, or enjoyable. Lynch must have been so preoccupied with being experimental that he failed to realize subpar acting had taken over, further depreciating the quality of his film. Laura Dern's portrayal of the lead character is sporadically convincing due to a lack of focus, lack of expressiveness, and fluctuating accent. As a result, she can barely hold the film together. Justin Theroux fared much better in his Mulholland Drive role, but here he seems overly conscious of the camera which makes him stiff and implausible onscreen. Jeremy Irons, Harry Dean Stanton, and Grace Zabriskie (especially) excel in their roles, however, there are just too many uninteresting characters and not enough attention-grabbing images and goings-on to allow a viewer to become immersed in this film.

Inland Empire contains the usual Lynchian characteristics. It's nightmarish, wry, dark, mysterious, and possesses troubled, desperate characters, but the magic normally found in his films is nearly absent. The sequences he includes with anthropomorphic rabbits uttering dryly random, unrelated dialogue (however promising they seem) are certain to distract viewers. They bulk up the film to the point where one supposes Lynch had already completed these strangely dry sequences, didn't know where else to put them, so he dropped them here at random. Not only are they distracting, they disrupt the pace of the film. If you want to invest your time in a Lynch picture, I recommend Mulholland Drive, Eraserhead, Lost Highway, Blue Velvet, and the Elephant Man. If you're still curious about Inland Empire, prepare to skip a slew of extraneous scenes that go far beyond the point of yanking the viewer around.",1503964800,,2355,5.28

2839397,1,B000QQFKYE,"Well I went ahead and bought his AMERICAN movie from a seller in the UK. Now considering that this is an AMERICAN movie I would think that the film distributors when producing this DVD would have formatted it to be compatible with AMERICAN dvd players. But alas, somehow it is only compatible with European dvd players such as those found in the UK. Now it would be an understatement to say that I was angry after spending all this money and then going ahead and trying to play the dvd on my dvd player only to find out that the dvd is not compatible with American dvd players.

First let me say this: The rest of the world needs to follow America's lead and format THEIR dvd players the way OURS is formatted. Just like the rest of the world needs to get its a** off of the obnoxiously confusing metric system and start using America's measurements. We are a superpower for a reason. At the risk of sounding like a hard-core nationalist I am just so maddened by the ridiculousness that western countries can't format their dvd players to match that of the world's superpower's dvd players. The UK by the way is the place that just put a travel warning to Brits going to America because of.....wait for it.....Donald Trump! BWAHAHAHAAHA! Of all the problems that the UK is facing internally, they have to always look across to pond and lecture us about how our society operates. As an American I can say that we Americans given our history are especially sensitive to Brits lecturing us. Well let me lecture the UK and the rest of the world.....it's time to get off the metric system and it's time to format your dvd players to be compatible with American dvd players. Stop scrutinizing our politics and our way of life. That is OUR business, NOT YOURS.

2839399,2,B000QQFKYE,"I've seen every David Lynch film known to man. Why? Because, like many others, I was captivated by the driven, innovative hybrid of beauty and horror, good and evil that is evident in Blue Velvet and Twin Peaks. These films blew my mind. Between the story, the music, the visuals, and just the downright bizarre nature of these pictures, I was spellbound. David Lynch is a master of atmosphere, and as a painter, he has moments of cinematic genius. I was so moved and amazed by Lynch's earlier works that I found myself watching films that I wasn't even interested in, films that I knew may not be good, just because he directed them. I kept getting disappointed, but I didn't give up. I bought the best of davidlynch.com, I saw his short films, I listened to his CD, and I even sat through every minute of his very slow, very experimental three hour movie.

Where do I begin? This film tries so hard. It actually tries to recapture some of the horror and the oddness that made his earlier films so engaging, but it never feels the same. The eerie atmosphere is there, but there's never any plotting, or any substance, to support it. It starts off with possibility, but it ends up feeling forced and even arbitrary at times. I normally try to give a plot summary in a review, but what we have here is simply a very dark and strange movie about an actress. That's it. There's no continuity, there's no logic, there's very little justifiable conflict, and there's no story arc. This film is literally an incoherent, episodic jumble of weird scenes.

It's kind of like Eraserhead in a way, but guess what? Eraserhead was only 85 minutes. It feels like 120. By this particular scale, Inland Empire seems to go on interminably. Eraserhead was equally surreal, abstract, and disturbing, but unlike Inland Empire, an intelligent viewer can actually make connections with the scenes in Eraserheadnot inherently logical connections, but connections nonetheless.

Even among fans, I think it's pretty much unanimous that Inland Empire is so utterly disjointed that it's futile to even attempt an analysis. It is simply devoid of any traditional story whatsoever. I can see what the movie was trying to accomplish; it is meant to create a very bizarre viewing experience unlike anything else, and it does do that, but it takes far too long to do so. I will admit this movie had its moments. It has a couple scenes that made me jump, and one more that made me regret watching it while I was alone in the house; however, these few moments of terror are wedged between hours of plotless, stagnantly-paced scenes that require too much patience to sit through.

I appreciate artistic films, but I like artistic films to get their point across within a reasonable period of time. I think some reviewers, me included, wouldn't have been so hard on this movie if it were about 40 to 60 minutes shorter. I enjoy odd films as well, but I like odd films to make sense, and if they don't make sense, if they break the bonds of logic, they need to justify this decision with something intriguing and original. I like the idea of an experimental film. I am even interested in a film that imitates the flow of dreams, and I admire a director for trying; however, as far as I'm concerned, this is nearly impossible to pull off, as, too often, ambitious filmmakers abandon the tried-and-true effectiveness of a classic story, and instead get carried away and ultimately drunk on their own meandering vision.",1450569600,9,3479,4.698360655737705
2839400,4,B000QQFKYE,"For a full description of the plot (if there is one), etc., read other reviews.  Just some quick thoughts on this David Lynch movie...

Inland Empire (2006) might be the weirdest David Lynch movie of all, and we all know that ALL of his movies are weird, but this one might come in first place.  This three hour movie seems to have everything that is vintage David Lynch and then some, including people dressed as rabbits.  Honestly, I'm not quite sure what this movie is about, but that's actually a normal reaction for anybody who watches David Lynch movies.  Bruce Dern's daughter Laura turns in a good performance.  This movie also stars Jeremy Irons and Justin Theroux.  I didn't care for the use of the steady cam in a lot of scenes in this movie because there was some shaking of the camera which I find distracting.  The second disc of this 2-DVD set contains about three and a half hours of extras with a lot of weird stuff.  While I like other Lynch movies such as Mulholland Drive, Eraserhead, The Elephant Man, Blue Velvet, etc., better than this movie, Inland Empire is still a good flick that I recommend seeing.",1445644800,2,1126,4.562189054726368
2839401,5,B000QQFKYE,"I like to think of Inland Empire (2006) as a conglomerate of ingredients from all of David Lynch's previous 9 feature length films. Of course, the word is ""surreal."" In this 3 hour movie that's shot in standard definition digital, we're taken for a wild ride of surrealism, mystery, confusion, paranoia, and all out wonderment. Yes, in typical Lynch fashion, the plot can be hard to follow, but that's okay, because you will reach the point when you forget about trying to follow it closely, and instead enjoy something unlike anything you will ever see. I see similarities with Twin Peaks: Fire Walk With Me, and especially Mulholland Dr. This is one of those films where the plot is replaced with interesting people/creatures/situations. Laura Dern shines in this film, and gives probably her best performance as an actress. Of course, this got little recognition, because Inland Empire was a very limited release movie. I strangely found myself enjoying every minute of this film, even when the slow parts got even slower, because the atmosphere was brooding and mysterious, and the acting superb. The old saying, ""it's so bad that it's good"" just might apply to this movie; I want to emphasize the ""bad"" being a strange and surreal plot that doesn't cater to the mainstream. Consider my analogy as seen through the eyes of a mainstream viewer who eventually ""gets on board"" with the pure art that is depicted by Lynch. I think this review is getting a little weird, so I think I'll stop! Inland Empire is essential viewing, and a modern masterpiece from the master of the surreal.",1442275200,2,1584,4.87037037037037

2839404,5,B000QQFKYE,"What do films really mean?

Inland Empire is a film directed by David Lynch.
It came out in 2006.
This movie contains Lynch's rich history as a director.
His reoccurring themes, visual or theoretical, are all present & intact.

Lynch always has a vision and refuses to compromise.
You could say, in Inland Empire, this vision is stronger then ever.

Lynches movies rarely ever follow the typical story arc.
There is always a certain amount of the story that is left up to the viewer's imagination.
That is what really makes Inland Empire unique.
You will use your mind in a way most films don't require.
In other words, there are other areas in your brain that films can reach, & David Lynch will show you how.

Inland Empire is a movie about making movies.
A director, played by Jeremy Irons, is filming a strange movie.
His side kick is played by Harry Dean Stanton.

The movie is a remake of a obscure Polish film that was never finished because the leads were murdered during production.
Think thats a strange? Thats only the beginning.
Naturally, this information does not sit well with the cast making the remake.
They didn't even know the film was a remake.

Inland Empire starts off slightly structured, although strange.
The lead role is played by Laura Dern,
Through the film she plays multiple characters with infinite emotions.
As things get weird, the story becomes more abstract.

The film is journey at 3 hours long.
It will take you through many different moods, genres, & styles.
Just when you think you understand what is going on, it will change.
Ultimately, a very thoughtful trip worth taking.",1435968000,2,1614,4.742857142857143

If you like a more traditional film in which you are given a beginning, a middle, and an ending, or where you aren't required to do much thinking or perhaps you like a movie that is a standard hour and a half,  this movie might not be for you.

2839428,4,B000QQFKYE,"""Inland Empire"" was David Lynch's last full length feature film before he started the David Lynch Foundation, a TM-based organization dedicated to helping people through transcendental meditation. Considering the obscene runtime (three hours, almost to the dot) for a film of its transgressive narrative, I feel that Lynch knew this would be his last movie for quite some time because the poor guy just pours his heart and soul into it with everything he's got. Now, I loved it-- I understand the movie, but the reason I can't give it five stars is because the way this movie makes me feel when it's over is something that can't easily be shared with everyone because they can't understand.

The movie is difficult to explain in terms of plot-- something I find myself saying in a lot of the reviews I write for the things I like, but this one takes the cake in terms of movies. Let me try to put it as simply as possible: It's about an actress who gets sucked inside a movie she's working on, becoming the character she plays-- I know a lot of my fellow David Lynch fans are going to come down on me for this and I know that's not a completely accurate description but I'm writing this for the Lynch layman so please bear with me. Laura Dern plays an actress who is working on a movie which is being directed by a prestigious Hollywood director played by Jeremey Irons who reveals to her that their movie is actually a remake of a cursed Polish movie that was never completed due to mysterious and murderous circumstances. This information makes her and her fellow actors uneasy, and almost without warning, her whole world is unmade right before her eyes. That's about as specific as I can get without whipping out a flowchart and some diagrams.

The point is, ""Inland Empire"" is David Lynch taking on the world, particularly Hollywood. This film is the third part of what's sometimes called the ""L.A. trilogy,"" or ""the Hollywood trilogy,"" the other two films being ""Lost Highway"" and ""Mulholland Drive."" But ""Inland Empire"" marks a major departure for Lynch, the use of digital filming techniques and the complete absence of absolutely any outside interference from executives. This is Lynch, unbound. There are no rules anymore, nobody in a striped suit with a cigar breathing down his neck saying ""Davey, boy, ya need to get Lady Gaga in this picture,"" or something similar. What we've got here is a director who knows he's about to take an extended hiatus and right before doing so he carefully pieces together a movie that will keep people talking for years. Even now, almost a decade after its release, even the most dedicated David Lynch fans are still struggling to understand what this film means.

It goes from being doom and gloom, to curiosity, to horror, romance, horror again, it culminates in an insane climax one has to see to believe and provides a beautiful and thoughtful ending for everyone who is familiar with the director's work. The rest of the movie is almost swept aside as the journey when the destination is revealed, and it's everything David Lynch has ever been a part of, everything he's ever loved coming together for a spectacle unlike anything seen in any of his prior films. In a way, I feel the ""Hollywood Trilogy"" is Lynch's way of exorcising the despair he felt over ""Dune,"" a movie which he said ""he had divorces more satisfying"" than. In the end, the whys and the hows aren't so important as how you feel when the film is done. And I felt good.

The first disk of the DVD set is the movie, the second disk contains several oddball features as have come expected when associated with the director's work. I know the DVD set itself was made with three or four different covers, the one I got is blue and has an image of two faces on it and at the bottom says ""2-Disk Special Edition.""",1425081600,25,3824,4.62739322533137

2839431,5,B000QQFKYE,"I saw ""Inland Empire"" in the cinema shortly after its initial release.  I've been a fan of David Lynch since I first saw ""Eraserhead"" in the mid-1980s.  Although truth be told, I wasn't that impressed with IE upon my first viewing ..... Then I happened upon IE on German television in Berlin.  Much of the German dubbing was too fluent for me to understand.  Thus I focused more intently on the images of the film.  After a certain point I didn't even need the dialogue.  Everything was clearly conveyed by means of the actors faces / physicality.  IE offers visual symbolism, a seemingly cryptic and random shuffling of images, and moments of terror combined with absurdist humor.  Suddenly I was seeing this work in a whole new light and grasping its deeper meaning ..... And / or lack thereof.

At one point Nikki Grace (Laura Dern) appears at a barbecue with her husband Koz Kakawski (Stanley Kamel) whose T-shirt is covered with ketchup.  The T-shirt covered in ketchup is at once a joke; a foreshadowing; as well as a joke on the idea of foreshadowing itself (it's a very funny moment).  Right before that scene, Nikki asks two of the mysterious / time-traveling ""girls"" sitting on the lawn (I paraphrase) : ""Tell me how you know me!""  One of the girls answers with a Cheshire Cat grin: ""Yes. We'll do that"" (also a very funny moment).  As with the ketchup-covered T-shirt ETC -- I welcome the recurrence of the Lynchian archetypes: the mid-century furniture, the tasteful and / or lurid lighting, the rabbit sitcom, the spells, the curses, the scary darkness of grim hallways, the wickedness of life juxtaposed with the banal.  All of that representing Lynch's preferences for multi-leveled storytelling [that many other Amazon reviewers of this product have referred to]. Whether or not a ""plot"" even exists in this film becomes irrelevant.  That being said, he basics are clear; a sudden change of circumstances sends Nikki Grace plummeting ""down the rabbit hole"" culminating in a brutal fight for survival.  All of that being magnificently portrayed by Laura Dern, who due to the polarizing nature of this film was not adequately recognized for her work in this role.  Even watching her face, as she stands against a wall in the morning sun during her metaphorical ""bad acid trip"" is amazing!

Lynch has always mined a kind of yin yang substratum in his works, that render many of them unpalatable for the general public.  And the doppelgnger, in one form or another, is always present in his films.  Lynch's outlook and meaning come from the world of dreams.  In this vein, hhe follows the path of his predecessors, as well as contemporaries, who likewise take / have taken creative risks.  Off the top of my head, I would say that ""Inland Empire"" resembles a blend / reimagining of Fellini's ""Juliet of the Spirits"", Bunuel's ""The Exterminating Angel"" & Lars Von Trier's ""Antichrist"" (even though ""Antichrist"" was released in 2009).  I'm extremely grateful for the fact that Lynch can explore such a dark place and still make it so sublimely entertaining.  It works because Lynch is ultimately a humanist who realizes that, like Pandora's Box, in the end there is always hope.

Laura Dern is remarkable as the actress whose existence begins to merge with that of the character shes playing in her latest movie. The line between the two lives becomes ever more blurred until theres no certainty which is which, or whether they are in fact one and the same.

I swear it did not feel like 3 hours.  I've sat through long movies and been very aware of the passage of time.  This one took hold quickly and wrapped me in an uneasy nightmare-trance.  Everything was slightly off-kilter: unnatural acting, weird editing, heavy-handed musical score .. all conspire to create an atmosphere laden with suspense & the anticipation that something horrific was going to happen at any moment.  The murky low-fi video was beautifully handled, lending a dreamlike intensity / vagueness to the visuals.  I could not stop watching it.

The ""plot"" is murky with byzantine complexity, laden with symbols that the viewer is not meant to understand.  You are expected to pay attention and do a lot of work mentally putting events in order.  I enjoy movies that demand a lot from me, and I revel in surrealist confusion-as-art.

It was weird for weird's sake but so imaginative and funny that it worked.  I'd say this is his most abstract work since Eraserhead but this time he just went too far (for me).  Here the nightmare qualities are unrelieved by humor and the ' barely makes sense' stuff is unrelieved by stretches of 'normality'.  And it's 3 hours of this stuff!
I guess the film worked for some folks, but I just couldn't wait until it ended.  I couldn't bring myself to care what it ""meant"".

As I remembered this surreal experience, I realized that maybe this film was not as bad as I originally thought. Over the next few weeks, I kept dreaming about this movie and couldn't stop thinking about the images.

I have since seen this film about 3-4 more times and I still believe there is nothing better out there. David Lynch was able to create a truly unique piece of art which can only exist in one medium - cinema. This is what it's all about - pushing the boundaries of what constitutes cinema. Federico Fellini has done it in his masterpiece ""8 1/2"", Tarkovsky was also successful in furthering this art with his masterpiece - ""Stalker"".

Now, having said that, I did not find the three hours to be too long at all!! It felt very seamless to me in it's pace. I am a HUGE David Lynch fan. But one thing that I loved about Inland Empire was that it was not overly graphic. There are no graphic sex scenes, the F word is used occasionally but not pervasive, and the violence is tame. Even though I am a Huge Lynch fan, I find sometimes that he can go a little overboard with some graphic scenes. That is not the case here. Inland Empire was very tastefully done!

This was probably the 2nd or 3rd DL movie that I had seen so far, I knew after seeing ""mulholland""  and also reading the IE synopsis that I was going to be in for a nightmare where you don't know what's gonna happen and above all feeling scared and unsettled. When I read the synopsis for IE I thought this movie should be easier to follow then MD, how wrong I was, by the time act 1 was over I was like ""what the hell?"", (mind you at this point i still hadn't become familiar with DL's style). Inland Empire is hard to digest at first, even on 2nd viewing but once you have learnt that this movie doesn't spell out the story for ya, that's when watching this movie becomes an entertaining joyride, the idea is not to feel you have to be in control by trying to find the story in this movie, the idea is to just let yourself go. If you can work out what the story of is, yay, yippee! but if you can't, doesn't matter, just the emotional turmoil that this movie puts you through is enough to thrill the heart.

More things that happened

This is basically a 90 min movie of all the deleted scenes in IE. I read that these deleted scenes delve deeper into what IE is about, this is true because when I watched ""more things"" I found myself understanding IE a little better but only a little :), there's one scene in ""more things"" that is kind of boring, just as well it didn't make the final cut. Other than that I recommend that you watch MTTH.

As for the rest of the special features, Ballerina, Lynch 2, Quinoa and Stories, these are all fun to watch.

2839503,5,B000QQFKYE,"""Inland Empire"" (2007) is directed by David Lynch. This provocative movie is a nightmarish labyrinth that follows actor Nikki Grace (Laura Dern) through a hallucinatory world. Jeremy Irons portrays a director filming Nikki Grace, though what is being filmed and what is hallucination, or who's point of view we are seeing is often skewed and interweaving. The film blends Lynch's interest with a decadent Hollywood boulevard, and surroundings, with a dark and dangerous foreign Polish world. After about the first hour Lynch cuts the seemingly real world anchors as we begin to feel the grip of this strange world and are plunged into a ever increasing schizophrenic madness. It is a strangely beautiful and at times horrific world.

This double dvd set also has over 211 minutes of special features including over one hour of missing scenes, a forty minute interview with David Lynch about his thoughts on the filming of the ""Inland Empire"", some filming of the movie process, and a short film showing Lynch cooking quinoa while telling some stories about his travels in Europe. ""Inland Empire"" was evidently filmed using a video camera and so the film has the jaggies and lower resolution one might expect to see on a VHS tape.",1313539200,3,1229,4.995121951219512

If you have a taste for the surreal and bizarre, Inland Empire is your type of movie.  It's beyond creative and I just adore David Lynch for making these type of movies, for artists and intellects.  Inland Empire's plot is mystical and puzzling, it's like a woman's decent into complete total madness.  It reminds me of Natalie Portman's role in Black Swan, but this movie is 10 times better.

2839506,5,B000QQFKYE,"If you haven't found the slightly concealed pinpoint ""entrance"", then this will only appear to be a frantic, hysterical torrent of impenetrable paranoia. BUT, if you are fortunate or clever enough to decipher the Polish characters ""instructions"" at the very beginning of how exactly to ""enter"", then it transforms into a thrillingly visceral roller coaster ride through the vast caverns, ornate galleries and cramped cupboards of David Lynch's irresistibly Gothic mind. The story that you then experience -- and it is indeed a profound, shatteringly intense experience -- unfolds with a stunningly vivid, logical rationale.

The ""key"" is in grasping that David is first requiring us to make a very definite adjustment to our ""awareness"", to move towards something like a meditative state where ""time"" and ""space"" are more fluid, less absolute entities. You MUST release yourself from a strictly literal reading or interpretation of the events and locales and identities, and then somehow, magically, it suddenly makes so much more sense. In fact, it turns out to be Lynch's most intensely sensible creation. That's the perplexing nature of it's remarkable method, its total dependence on the paradoxical quality of its form. Its assimilation of ""Eastern"" modes of consciousness in order to reveal a genuinely staggering insight into our ""Western"" culture can be seen as a parallel of David's attainment of his own personal enlightenment. David is a long time practitioner of Transcendental Meditation and as such has acquired formidable skill at separating himself from his temporal existence and connecting with an infinitely more intense, more accurate, more valuable reality. He is working in all his art, and especially here, to have us also acquainted with this vast, infinite experience. That's the reason for the seemingly impossible structure, and the secret to gaining entrance. At first attempt I didn't understand how to ""enter"" and I was frustrated, perplexed, pissed off with David's seemingly arrogant self involvement. But I thought, ""No, I must be missing something..."" so I went back to the beginning and that's when I discovered the barely concealed directions for gaining entry.

You may be one of those Lynch fan's that believes that it is intentionally irrational, obtuse and inscrutable, and not in any way meant to be rational, but are non the less impressed and complimentary. Well, unfortunately you have not experienced the real ""inner"" story and should go back and try again. Unless your experience is remarkably lucid, and intensely coherent, and thoroughly devastating, then you've not gotten ""in"". You are only marveling at the intimidating exterior appearance of Lynch's formidable vehicle. You have not yet actually ridden it. You'll know it when you're ""in"", believe me. There's no confusing this. I know exactly how it feels to be on the outside looking in, and how that in no way is this movie's ultimate intent. If anything, the false starts only made my eventual ""admission"" all that more meaningful and intense. If you've not experienced it as I have, as a remarkably efficient and elegant conveyor of a profoundly intense experience, then you have missed out.

David has exploited all of his previous film, TV, internet, musical, and visual arts in creating an entirely new art, but it's distinct, separate, unlike anything else he's previously created, perhaps anyone else. Don't compare this to Mulholland Drive, Eraserhead, Twin Peaks, or even to his webcast videos. This is entirely its own beast. David's web series Rabbits are a deconstruction of the Western narrative form that, through Film Noir, emerged as a compelling means to convey our innate sense of deep anxiety, confusion and terror of confronting the mysteries of our reality. Rabbits resembles a TV sitcom, a Broadway drama, an off Broadway absurdist experiment, or even a video parody of all of the above, and in Inland Empire the Rabbits take on a ""sacred"" role as supernatural icons of our media infused culture. Our persistent suspicion about life is fertile ground for some extremely curious hybrid art. Paranoia is a potent muse.

Very often, at key moments, INLAND EMPIRE plays like a horribly trite soap opera. Simultaneously, it feels like a meandering documentary, never quite focusing on any one single topic. And just as often it seems content to hover in an undefined, unlabeled space, not concerned with its name or purpose. None of this is gratuitous, random, arbitrary. It's all supremely relevant, essential. Ultimately, it feels as though there isn't a disposable scene, an inconsequential moment. It's quite lengthy if you're just ""watching"" it, but once I managed to get ""on track"" it soared past me, around me, through me at a blistering pace. At one point towards the conclusion I somehow was thrown off, I found myself as lost and confused as I had been initially. I stopped and rewound the video to the point of confusion, and sat and considered everything that had just transpired, absorbing as much as possible, and reconnecting with the film's powerful rhythm. Again, I sensed a realignment of my awareness as a fuller sense of the action coalesced into a tangible experience, and I then resumed the video. And now the final scenes were all the more more vivid, lucid, emphatically understandable, and so completely enveloping, like superb 3D in my mind -- Ultra, Mega, Turbo 3D.

Many viewers feel, or express a belief, that Laura Dern has turned in an extraordinary performance. I am not so sure. And what's interesting is that I believe that David was not only allowing for an inferior performance from Laura, he counted on it. This may sound absurd to her ardent fans, but I have always sensed that David's fascination with Laura is more her symbolic quality than her specific skill or talent. She is for him a substitute for Hitchcock's recurring Blond Goddess In Peril, but with a skeptical edge. David is more concerned with the image, the notion of the unattainable ice princess, and the lithe, fair skinned, blue eyed Dern functions abstractly as his Janet Leigh, Tippi Hedren, or Grace Kelly. But David has allowed the gaps, the stitched seams, the flaws in her work to show. By exposing the faults and weaknesses of Laura's acting we are granted access to a curious aspect of cinema -- it's inherently deceptive quality. We are being made aware of the synthetic, fabricated artifice that too many people have for so long accepted as the equivalent of reality. As much as it is a willful contrivance, Laura's often confused, scattered, unfocused demeanor may just as much be genuine confusion with her situation. David is depending on Laura's limited awareness of the meaning of his dialog and action, immersing her in an entirely alien world so that he may capture her authentic, true anxiety. It's because of his commitment to authenticity that David in fact deceives Laura. Regardless of his respect and fondness for her, David must exploit her -- exploit her persona, which he himself is largely responsible for -- in the name of artistic integrity. This paradox is as compelling as any other encountered within this daunting video. The scenes of Laura reciting curious dialog at a table before a near mute witness reveal an actress in the process of discovering her character's motivations, excavating deeply stored impulses in the service of illusion. While functioning in the film as a ploy to temporarily confuse the audience as to who -- which manifestation of Laura's character -- we are watching, David video recorded these scenes of her reading these 15 pages as a pretense to scrutinize her process. It's in these intensely focused episodes that Laura is most vulnerable and exposed, and I often winced and cringed at what I perceive are her genuinely awkward, awful attempts at a southern accent. It seems to me that just as he did in Wild at Heart David has allowed Laura to employ a jarringly horrible accent. It's also likely, to me, that Laura is oblivious of just how bad is her attempt. There's every reason to experience her performance as inadequate. David is relying on Laura's inferior talent to fulfill his requirements for an inferior actress, Nikki Grace, in the inferior film within the film, On High In Blue Tomorrows. Rather than ask a really fine actress to ""play down"" for the part of Nikki, he hired a genuinely limited actress that he could appropriately exploit. He has risked the success of the entire production on Laura's unwitting participation. Many noted director's have behaved similarly, but not nearly as cynically. David actually staged a very outrageous campaign to get Laura nominated for an Oscar for her work in this film by hiring a cow to walk down Sunset Boulevard, but I believe this was just a blatant and audacious ploy to maintain his deception of Laura. In all truth it's a despicable act, but that's Hollywood, isn't it?

There are Doctoral Theses being written about this video, schools of thought emerging that espouse its philosophy, legions of cinephiles that are as traumatized by it as they would be a terrorist attack. All this may be justly deserved, only time will tell. But I can confidently assert that the most revolutionary aspect of Inland Empire is it's entirely unique and unprecedented cinematic method. This astonishingly powerful method is the equivalent of a mind-stilling mantra; the sound of one hand clapping...",1300838400,8,9437,5.06949806949807
2839507,5,B000QQFKYE,"Watch very closely the Polish hooker (called ""Lost Girl"" in the credits) watching the TV in the opening scene, and the events surrounding her throughout the film. How does she get to being in Piotrek/Smithy's arms at the end? I think that she watches a film starring Nikki Grace, which cascades through her consciousness. At the climax, Nikki's performance kills the ""phantom"" which had been torturing Lost Girl. Thus, released from internal torment, Lost Girl is able to join her husband and son back in the real world with profound gratitude.

WE get to watch the amazing process of that film-within-the-film infiltrating through the Lost Girl's mind, and Nikki's character meeting Lost Girl's husband, older relatives, floozie friends, events back in Poland, maybe a guardian angel or two, and other memories along the way.

I regard this as David Lynch's manifesto about the power of art, and specifically acting, to change people for the better. In the end, Nikki's performance receives applause for killing the phantom and replacing the ""Rabbits"" nonsense in Room 47 (a metaphor for Lost Girl's soul, perhaps?). Nikki then takes her place in Lost Girl's fully processed memories, along with other movie heroines (Laura Harring's femme fatale from Mulholland Dr. is there). Nina Simone and some African-influenced dancers joyfully play us out.

The greatest trick of this film is how experiencing it is subjectively very much like the Lost Girl's encounter with On High in Blue Tomorrows, the film within the film. The tension and fear that get built up are unbearable in some scenes, and the frights are very startling (even though being extremely cheaply staged). Then afterward, INLAND EMPIRE unfolds in our minds for days. We replay it. By some alchemical process, once we've processed it for ourselves, we are elated, and maybe enlightened, or so I think this is Lynch's sincere hope and purpose.

2839509,5,B000QQFKYE,"Laura Dern is the best actor in the U.S.  In Inland Empire, which she stars, she gives one of the greatest screen performances I've ever seen.  From her opening appearance in this David Lynch masterpiece, the nuances of her expressions as she's listening to a bizarre woman are superbly done,  conveying outwardly within a few seconds what it would take most actors--even good ones--much longer and much less effectively than Ms. Dern requires.
  Inland Empire is David Lynch's 2006 foray into a nightmarish world where reality and fantasy are blurred, both for the audience and Ms. Dern's characters.  It is both Eraserhead and Mulholland Drive, in B & W and color.  Admittedly, there are sections of the film that drag and this flick is too long (almost 3 hours) for what it has to say; however, what it does say coupled with Laura Dern's staggering acting as she goes through a gauntlet of changes that surpasses even Naomi Watts' in Mullholland Drive, is well worth a little boredom and frustration.
  Ms. Dern is not a big star, which is probably just as well because I have a feeling--although I don't know--that she goes after roles that allow her to really act and have the creative freedom that so many mainstream films wouldn't.  She proves this in the magnificent satire Citizen Ruth, the film that made me aware of Dern's awesome abilities.

Laura Dern did a good job but I question if she even knew what was going on after some time. I read somewhere that the different scenes had their own scripts and it was all put together at the end.

2839522,3,B000QQFKYE,"A schizophrenic, uneven, macabre, absurd and highly ambitious variation of his own `Mulholland Drive', `INLAND EMPIRE' is David Lynch's most recent contribution to the world of cinema.  The cinephile in me is telling me that I'm about to be entirely too harsh on this film.  I mean, this is David Lynch!  Cinematic genius!  Misunderstood visionary!  Alas, as much as I love his work, `INLAND EMPIRE' leaves me disappointed.  Don't get me wrong, I love absurd.  When you watch Lynch's masterpieces like `Mulholland Drive' and `Eraserhead' there are high levels of absurdity involved, but they all come together rather cohesively to create something impacting.

`INLAND EMPIRE' is less profound and more preposterous.

One of the first things I notice here is that the plot and or `revelations' contained here are far too similar to those entertained in `Mulholland Drive'.  This seems to be like a mutated copycat of Lynch's previous film.

The film tells the story of an actress named Nikki Grace who lands a fated part in a film that had previously been shut down when the stars were murdered.  After learning this detail, Nikki begins to lose it.  She goes a tad crazy and mixes the lines of her real life and her stage life and everything begins to unravel for her.  She starts to live in Susan Blue's (the character she is portraying in the film) world.

`INLAND EMPIRE' tries really hard, and I think that may be my biggest fault with it.  It is obviously trying.  Laura Dern, an actress that so many of my friends laud and adore (and I personally have found her quite engaging at times) is kind of a mess here.  I know that I'm going to get lambasted here, but I'm just calling it like I see it.  She basically tries to do what Naomi Watts did in `Mulholland Drive' (unsuccessfully) for a good three quarters of the film before she goes entirely off the deep end.  Dern seems a tad lost in the concept of the film.  By concept, I don't mean plot (for that is a tad straightforward).  I mean the directorial vision.  The film is shot like a cheap adult film, grainy and full of imperfections and `too' close-ups.  Dern seems uncomfortable (which may have been the point) but it's not a natural discomfort.  It seems staged.  You can tell she is `playing' uncomfortable.  With Watts, that staginess in the outset of the `Mulholland Drive' served a major purpose when her performance came full circle.  That isn't really the case here.  Dern goes from uncomfortable to full-blown lunatic with no real defining moment to let us know what we are really witnessing.

I know that `INLAND EMPIRE' has a point, but it's still rather pointless.  The films central theme seems to be of identity and self reflection (which is exactly what made `Mulholland Drive' so profound) but `INLAND EMPIRE' fails to do that theme any real justice.

With a collection of random scenes that somehow are supposed to tie into a `bigger picture', `INLAND EMPIRE' feels lost inside of itself.  I know that many loyalists are going to call me out on this.  Obviously I'm looking at this film wrong (and maybe I am).  Remember, I love David Lynch.  `Eraserhead' is one of the greatest films I've ever seen, but this film loses me.  In the end I'm still giving it a C because it has some redeeming qualities and I will revisit this film to refine my understanding and or opinion of the film.

I will throw a positive in this film's direction though.  This is honestly one of the best `sounding' films I've ever seen.  As far as technical merits are concerned, this film nails the sound.  I'm not one who usually calls out a films sound quality, but the whole time I was watching this film I was overtaken with how engaging the film sounded.  Every footstep, door opening, phone ringing, light flickering; it all popped beautifully, and that score was expertly woven into the film to create the desired mood.

I only wish that the film itself were edited better and created a more cohesive tale.",1274054400,2,3968,4.681620839363242
2839523,5,B000QQFKYE,"""Inland Empire"" is the best movie in the whole History of Film. It achieves what, as far as I have seen, no other film has achieved. What essays on narrative said movies couldn't achieve, in comparison with Literature. That is, to show the psyche, the interior monologue, the dreams and the nightmares, within the characters. And it does it in a way no other film (that I know) has made it: showing just their (her, in this movie) mind.

This is a huge step forward in Cinema. It's like the step from silent movies to ""the talkies"". But, from the point of view of the merit of films and directors, with the significant distinction that Lynch's has been taken not because of the development of a technology that any director can use, as something taken for granted, as a routine, being the merit of scientists, but because of the personal art of the filmmaker.

Many other filmmakers had tried to do the same thing. Lynch himself had tried it in ""Lost Highway"" and ""Mulholland Drive"". And he did it masterly. But, in ""Inland Empire"", he excels. He does it for the whole movie. From the beginning to the end (or almost; the next step is too obvious). For the first time in history. That's why I think this is the best movie ever (so far). A landmark forever.

As for the story, I don't know if Lynch reconstructed his home in Boise, Idaho, for the shooting, but I would say that ""Inland Empire"" it's just another way of telling, and from another point of view, a very similar story to that of ""Mirror"", by Andrei Tarkovsky.

The sad news: Lynch will never again achieve something like ""Inland Empire"", I dare to say, maybe prematurely. He will do other movies, brilliant as he always is, but I'm pretty sure he will never reach that artistic level. He has already done it. He can repeat himself, tell other stories the same way... In fact, it's like he didn't want to stop that story of redemption: ""More things that happened"". He wanted, attempted, to show everything that happened, to get rid of it, to heal himself (he wasn't even, maybe, completely aware), once and forever... He did it. It's done. And, as a Spanish genius, the sculptor Jorge Oteiza, said, after an Artist makes his masterpiece, all he'll be able to do is ""craftwork"", ""decoration"". I think that's what Lynch will do after his masterpiece: just follow the paths (as an activity he masters and enjoys doing) he left undeveloped in ""Inland Empire"".",1267315200,6,2416,4.611627906976744

Second, the film will be populated by quirky and extreme characters.  Third, the plot will not necessarily be linear.  Fourth, after watching a Lynch film, he will provoke your brain in ways it hasn't been provoked or stimulated before.  Fifth, a typical Lynch film has comedy, drama, action, and existential pain all rolled into one.

""Inland Empire"" is no exception to these rules.  Although I found it difficult to follow the thread of the story, the acting by Laura Dern is some of her best work (if not her best).  Jeremy Irons was also impressive.

It is something of a 'movie within a movie' in that the story concerns a film production and the literal actors are playing the characters of actors in the film.  There is some drama about marital infidelity, and a back story about a curse that seems to be repeating itself.  There is some vague-ness about what is real and what is imagined.

2839526,5,B000QQFKYE,"I was at first shocked when I was hearing and reading from Lynch fans negative feedback. It took me a while to understand what had turned so many otherwise open-minded viewers off. This film, though thematically most linked to Mullholland Drive, is stylistically a culmination of what has attracted Lynch fans all along. Take Lost Highway, with the inexplicably changing 'incarnations' and the two women played by the same actress. And at how many levels is Laura Dern playing her role? It would actually be quite a task to periodize the manifestations of Laura Dern's shifting realities and identities, yet there is a cohesive thread. As for a read? Well I don't presume any Lynch fan wants to be able to walk away with some cliched abstraction that is supposed to be the meaning of the movie. I do not find the movie any harder to engage than Eraserhead. In fact, I find Inland Empire much easier to engage. However, Laura Dern's descent is quick, and one would be hard pressed to convince me that it is not a descent. To where does she descend? Where else but that most feared place of psychic horror that despite our 'enlightened' sensibilities, we cannot brush aside.

In short, two things make this film 'hard' to watch, both of which depend upon the viewer: 1. the thematic, emotional, and visual darkness of the film. 2. the realities within realities within realities. But it's like I wrote about Eraserhead: Lynch is by far the closest thing we've got to a filmaker-poet since Cocteau precisely because he is willing to make the conception of a cohesive plot (narrative) impossible. This is definitely a masterpiece for me, even amongst the other works of Lynch. In a away I'm not surprised about the negative responses. But I'm just as surprised that the audience that was glad to be horrified and removed from the mundane by virtue of shifting realities in Eraserhead, the film upon which Lynch was able to build a career, cannot accept an equally ambitious (and ambiguous) and daring film. One thing that's missing: where are the people that are really excited about this film? I'm sure there are some, but I haven't met any.

Detailed metaphors, symbols, and Mcguffins (or my lack of catching all the symbolism) aside, here's what I took away from this film upon my initial viewing: The film is simply about a woman forced to relive her brutal murder over and over again under the theory of eternal recurrence for her egotistical karma and harmful infidelities. (Eternal recurrence is an archaic and Nietzschean concept. Woody Allen made a joke about this theory in HANNAH AND HER SISTERS. ""Great, now I'll have to sit through the Ice Capades again."")

Allow me to preface my theory about this film by saying: from what we have learned from ancient Eastern thought and physics, time is not a linear event. The concept of time is temporal and subjective. It is possible that multiple timelines may co-exist as a singular event. In ""eternal recurrence,"" the same existence or life is played out over and over again thru time. In Hindu religions it's expressed as the Wheel of Time. Nikki Grace is trapped by her karma or by The Karmic Wheel of Time. According to Eastern doctrines, we all are. Birth, death, and rebirth. Samsara. The only escape according to some Eastern philosophies is thru enlightenment, by paying for that karma (""a past-due bill""), or by altering it. Or, by some other Lynchean shift in consciousness. The Phantom, or Crimp, represents Nikki's ""animus"" (The masculine inner personality of a female in Jungian psychology.) or her evil karma. Nikki is warned of her Phantom personality or karma by the old gypsy woman at the beginning, ""evil was born and followed the boy."" Only when Nikki finally kills the Phantom, or her adulterous evil twin, can she free herself from her eternal karma. Free herself from the endless cycle of birth and death. Become enlightened. The Crying Girl (credited as The Lost Girl) represents Nikki in her latest incarnation on The Karmic Wheel of Time, watching her karma and her numerous nightmare lives unfold on TV right before her eyes. The death of The Phantom, or the cleansing of her filthy karma, frees Nikki from the trappings of time and ego, while also freeing Nikki in her current incarnation as The Crying Girl. She has broken her evil karma which allows her, as The Crying Girl, to finally achieve marital bliss, children, and karmic happiness. By the end, Nikki has changed her karma. That's it, in a Lynchean nutshell.

(During my second viewing of the film, I realized that Nikki initiates her evil karma in a past life by murdering her husband and his lover, for which she must suffer karmic payment for her own infidelities by being murdered in a similar fashion during future incarnations.)

********************************

Certainly valid, if one considers Lynch's adherence to Eastern Vedic thought, philosophy, and meditation. Lynch even quotes the Upanishads in the DVD extras.

The Rabbits are the coolest concept Lynch has come up with in a very long time. Awesome and hypnotic. Like a Magritte painting. Mind blowing to say the least. Would love to see this flick on shrooms. To me, the Rabbits represent the karmic materialistic trappings of ego. Samsara. Or, eternal Hell on Earth. If only Lynch had had the temerity to linger on the static images of them for a much longer time in the film. They are macabre. (You can find some 6 to 8 minute episodes on YouTube. Unfortunately, they were not included on the Bonus Disc.) Everyone else's interpretation about this film and the Rabbits is wholly valid. What a cool flick. My hope is that, after spending more time with it, I may see it as a Masterpiece.

Not being a fan of MD or LH by any means, I had given up on Lynch. (The only reason I rented IE is because I was intrigued by the trailer.) So, I have no idea how this narrative is applied to MD. In my opinion this is his best film since WAH and FWWM.

Even though I understand the aesthetic that Lynch was going for with this piece, I only wish he would have used real film, maybe a better digital camera, or brought the film more into focus. I also wish he had used better ambient lighting in certain shots. This film was far too dark in places when it wasn't necessary. The soft dirty focus, vignetting, and fisheyed close-ups were a distraction at times, and played a large part in almost annihilating my full enjoyment of this film. IMO, this was an unnecessary device to exhibit Lynchean dreamtime. However, I may change my opinions about this after subsequent viewings. My theory is that the entire narrative takes place in dreamtime. (Parts of the film were too grounded in reality for dream narrative. I actually wish it had been a little bit more cryptic.) For the entire film to be in soft focus to simulate dreamtime, puts a very big demand upon a modern viewer. I feel that his use of music and his Lynchean set pieces are all that are ever needed to present his inner dreamworlds. However, it is his painting, not mine. (The scratchy phonograph needle that was used to represent one of Nikki's past lives was a nice touch.) I do love the raw grainy look of old film. It's like dragging a dry oil paint brush across a canvas so that the texture of the painting surface shows thru. But, I feel that it's very easy to get carried away with the newer medium of digital tape. Unfortunately, Lynch says he'll never use real film again. Too bad. :(

Aside from being a dreamscape, comparisons to ERASERHEAD are baffling to me. This piece wasn't quite on the same level as ERASERHEAD (is anything?), but it is a very fine Lynch film, none the less. Past reviewers that complained about the ""editorial sloppiness"" are way off base about this film. IMO, every scene is crucial to the narrative. Nothing was extraneous. (As a matter of fact, I felt that a few scenes adding more clues about The Phantom were needed.) The film is ponderous at times for the average viewer, but the 3 hour running time moved by very quickly for me.

All of the music cues Lynch utilized for this piece were excellent, including his own compositions. I'm especially partial to his ambient music and The Rabbits' theme. Most excellent.

Everything you've heard is right on the money, Laura Dern IS truly amazing in this. A very giving performance. (In some of her scenes, she looks so much like her mother Diane Ladd, it's eerie.)

INLAND EMPIRE indeed.

The DVD extras are great. Over an hour of extra footage, most of which was not necessary to the narrative and was rightly cut. His interview is shorter than the one on the ERASERHEAD DVD, but he seemed more prepared and relaxed in this interview. I love his thoughts on music and the importance of proper theater and home theater equipment for the purpose of achieving the full intent of the artist's vision during playback. (One of my pet peeves are friends that insist on watching films on computer monitors.) Lynch goes off on people that watch films on computers and cell phones. He gets angry and very sad by the use of technology and its trend towards the ""putrification"" of this artform. (Lynch, I feel your pain, man.) Watching him work behind the scenes was very cool. Because his signature technique is mood, I've always had the feeling that Lynch was very meticulous and demanding in his direction to his actors, and it shows here. ""Anyone need some Fixall?"" Great stuff!

Now, if we could just get Lynch to film a true biography on Francis Bacon, everything would be right with the world. Or, at least right with the Lynchean Universe.

An ex-Lynchead that is intrigued by Lynch again.",1244764800,29,7709,4.740298507462686

And with Inland Empire he does not disappoint. Laura Dern leads us on a road to madness in this film. What is our first signpost but a typical crazy Lynchian neighbor who tears open time, transplanting Dern into tomorrow with a warning from today. Who are the rabbits that appear in the TV sitcom? Who are the women that appear to be as much Dracula's Brides as common street whores? It does not matter. As with all of Lynch's films it is best to sit back and allow all of this to wash over you. Once exposed to the relentless waves of madness you will be prepared for the myth maker that is Lynch to slowly give you pieces to the puzzle. A horrific end turns out to be only part of the film within the film. Or is it? Dern's madness may not be her own. A Polish woman may be dreaming it all. Or is she? With the torments of the universe swirling about pitiful humankind one can really only be along for the ride. Looking for real clues is useless, for as one character at the end of the film tries to explain over and over to another how to get to Pamona, the other, wiser character insists basically that you cannot get there from here. You cannot get to sanity from insanity. The myth maker knows that there are no ""solutions"" only ""being"" and acceptance. Inland Empire is yet another master piece from David Lynch.",1244419200,5,1466,4.258064516129032
2839529,3,B000QQFKYE,"Since finishing Mulholland Drive, Lynch has been releasing short film projects on the internet and discovering the joys of digital camcorders. The ""standard definition"" resolution that he uses here produces a horribly grainy, gloomy image that looks like a home movie. However, the use of such a cheap and small camera permits Lynch to make a movie more reflexively than ever before.

Inland Empire was never scripted. Lynch supposedly wrote out each scene moments before filming it, with the details of the plot only arising intuitively as time went on. The plotting is absolutely labyrinthine, even compared with already-Byzantine works like Lost Highway and Mulholland Drive. Although Inland Empire seemed absolutely meaningless to me on the first viewing, after the second viewing I had worked out the basics of the plot, confirmed later when I read other people's guesswork.

Inland Empire, like Mulholland Drive, treats Hollywood as a great empire of mediocrity, quashing the mystery of genuine creativity in favour of a jellybean superficiality. Nikki, an actress past her prime is desperately worried about falling out of the Hollywood system and is delighted to land a major role that is destined to revitalise her career. She is less thrilled when she hears that the movie is a remake of an unfinished German movie said to have been cursed.

The movie takes a left turn one third of the way in, with the actress finding that she is partially living in the movie she is supposed to be acting in. The initially plush and wealthy false reality slowly degrades over time, so eventually she becomes an LA prostitute, spat out of the Inland Empire that promised so much. The curse has almost crushed her.

However, she discovers that the curse on the movie revolves around the mysterious Phantom, who has entrapped the Polish actress from the unfinished remake of the movie. Nikki ascends a dark staircase, shoots the Phantom four times, and releases the trapped soul.

That is the basic outline of the story, though there are many nuances that there is no room to discuss here. The most memorable image of the movie, the dying Phantom with Nikki's distorted face superimposed, is a shot of unparalleled horror.

The movie, however, is too gloomy (even more so than Lost Highway), meandering and self-indulgently strange for my tastes. Inland Empire is not a case of a relatively simplistic story that has been made unnecessarily complex by self-indulgence. It could not be simplified without losing much of its flavour. However, that flavour is simply something I don't want to taste. Watch Mulholland Drive for something more polished and (to me) more satisfying.",1237507200,4,2669,5.068337129840547
2839530,5,B000QQFKYE,"Since Alain Resnais and Roman Polanski, no other director has dealt with such delirious commitment the frenetic obsessions, the worlds bellow other worlds, the dream covering other dreams, with such brilliant resolutions than David Lynch.

He had bet previously for other films with narrow resemblances such as Mulholland Drive. Once again, Lynch returns to the field in which is a king. The inner demons of the human being, the sharp game of metaphors, narrative ellipsis, sinister nightmares that happen in the most bizarre stages, keeping as superb landscape the main factory of dreams around the world: Hollywood.

A young and talented actress is hired to play the main role into a filmic project that never was finished due weird circumstances. She is in love with his husband but she hides a dark background; a terrible secret and this magisterial script blends the bitter and unsaid reality, the fiction of the very script and the enigmatic presence of an old woman who meets herself as a neighbor, gifted of  dark visions.

Lynch really involves us onto this complex web of livings, fears, obsessions and unsolved traumas, mixing them with glamour, sophistication, pink tunes, dances, acidic humor and sinister hallucinations where the big screen overtly works out as a huge mirror where she as actress may be seen herself from the spectator's hall.

An intelligent and engaging visual tour de force, where everything fits admirably. The superb illumination, the arresting stages, the handle of camera and the way he employs Hollywood Boulevard not precisely as a gentle postcard, really deserve the best epithets as one of the greatest artistic American achievements of this raising century.",1232150400,3,1700,5.212454212454213

Its much like a person with a multiple personality disorder came into your house, after a while you don't want to be around them, same with this film.

2839536,3,B000QQFKYE,"INLAND EMPIRE is pretty similar to other David Lynch films like LOST HIGHWAY and MULHOLLAND DRIVE because it sort of alternates between two different worlds, both of which are almost the exact opposite of each other. And INLAND EMPIRE is similar to most David Lynch movies in that you don't know WHAT the Hell is going on half the time. So with that being said, I'm not really sure what INLAND EMPIRE is about and considering I've only seen it ONCE, it would be unfair to make any assumptions. I tried to follow along, take notes, and piece the clues together while watching the movie, but within an hour I gave up and decided to just watch it. Also the fact that the film is three hours long, made me want to just get it over with.

INLAND EMPIRE is basically a movie within a movie and it starts off somewhat normal. Nikki (Laura Dern) accepts a role in a movie that co-stars a handsome womanizing actor named Devon (Justin Theroux). As the film's production starts they find out that they are actually filming a REMAKE of a movie that had its production halted due to a murder involving the actors. There are also hints that Devon wants to add Nikki to his list of women that he's conquered, but he denies it. Nikki is already married, but there's sort of a tension between them and as they get closer and actually show affection, INLAND EMPIRE does a complete 180 and goes off into bizarre territories that only David Lynch could provide. It all starts when the line between Nikki's reality and the movie that she's filming, completely blurs. And YOU, as the viewer, don't even know if you're watching Nikki (the real character) or Susan, the character that she's portraying in her movie. After that, INLAND EMPIRE alternates between Nikki's world, which is one of luxury, and another world that's dirty and ugly and revolves around some sort of murder. There's also a lingering theme of prostitution. And again much like MULHOLLAND DRIVE, there's another woman that's introduced but you don't know if she's a completely different character, if she represents Nikki, or if she actually IS Nikki. As if the character that she plays (Susan) has jumped out of her script and come to life. Or maybe you're getting a glimpse into the world of the lead actors who were murdered during the original production of the film that Nikki is starring in. Confused yet?? I'll stop there...

Well, if you're a David Lynch fan you'll probably like this. Personally, I'm a huge Lynch fan. I enjoyed INLAND EMPIRE because it's just so weird that it's almost refreshing to watch. But I have to admit that it's definitely not one of my favorite Lynch films. It's interesting but it's not breaking any new grounds as far as Lynch's filmography goes and is too similar to some of his other films.

The DVD:
The quality of the film is horrible, but knowing David Lynch that was probably his intention so all I will say is that it's not a pretty film by any means. The overall quality looks really low budget, is shaky at times (hand held cameras), and parts of the movie look generations old. The lighting also makes it difficult to see in some parts. However, despite the bad quality, the actual SHOTS in the film are beautiful and Lynch shows that he really knows how to create both gorgeous scenes and incredibly ugly scenes (or sometimes both mixed together), ultimately creating a nightmarish effect.

The EXTRA FEATURES: MORE THINGS THAT HAPPENED (74:55) - Basically a bunch of deleted scenes that are all edited together so that you have to watch them as a whole. It's almost like watching a different version of the movie. I didn't watch it all because by the time I got done with INLAND EMPIRE, I was pretty Lynch-ed out if you know what I mean.
QUINOA (20:03) - David Lynch shows you how to cook his favorite dish called Quinoa, which is like a bunch of protein mixed with broccoli or something. It's really weird. It sounds like someone actually went out of their way to SCORE footage of David cooking. In between, he tells a weird story and randomly makes these weird gestures with his hands similar to what Dennis Hopper did in BLUE VELVET.
BALLERINA (12:19) - Edited footage of a ballerina dancing to music. You see glimpses of her toward the end of INLAND EMPIRE and I guess this is just a polished product of footage that was shot with her.
STORIES (41:37) - David Lynch sitting down and telling stories about the filming of INLAND EMPIRE.
LYNCH 2 (30:10) - My favorite Extra Feature on the DVD. It's basically real Behind-the-Scenes footage of INLAND EMPIRE, seen through the eyes (or lens) of someone who just follows David Lynch around the set. It's like they edited together a bunch of his weird antics. The footage mostly consists of Lynch yelling at cast and crew, getting hands on with the production (making props, etc.), going over scripts, making phone calls, and other random stuff. It's very entertaining.

2839537,5,B000QQFKYE,"This is really good.

Yes, three hours is a long time to sit still so I would recommend watching it in small doses and letting it work its way into your imagination a little at a time.

First of all this is the work of a master interrogator of the subconscious. What Lynch captures is the way the subconscious constructs its own realities and selves out of the strata of inchoate memories, feelings, and desires. But the self is never altogether stable nor completely secure for those memories and feelings and desires are always shifting and giving way to new memories, feelings, desires and selves.

In reality creative people (writers, directors, actors, painters, poets, ...) are always constructing and exploring the virtual worlds and selves that they create. This is their status quo. But what Lynch does is create a kind of paranoid fantasy world where his main character, Laura Dern, experiences multiple versions of herself amid multiple narratives. And she is powerless to choose between her actual self (if any version can be considered the authentic one) and the virtual self (or selves) that she is enacting or simply witnessing (its unclear whether she has any agency in this). All realities are equally real to her and as the film progresses she becomes more and more lost to any singular originary self.

One of her selves is a smoldering 1940's femme fatale that she is cast to play in a film within a film and another is a prim and pregnant barefoot housewife and another is a call girl in what looks like a Fiona Apple video but all are emanations from ""Laura Dern's"" own fragmented consciousness. Her 1940's self is helped along by a film script directed by film within a film director Jeremy Irons that requires/allows her to play the part of an adulterous southern belle but this is more than a mere role for the playing of it is informed by very real desires to rebel against the constraints and pressures of her more subdued self/reality and to enjoy in the hidden country of cinema and art and dreams what is taboo and what is forbidden without any inhibition whatsoever. But one or two selves or realites will not suffice...

Under her own watchful gaze her selves and realities continue to multiply. Almost like an audience member, or some impassive spectator to her own multiple performances, she witnesses her life become a kaliedoscopic swirl of virtual selves and realites with no actual center.

Identity crisis has never been so inticing, so sexy, so dangerous, so dizzying, and so creepy.

Lynch even throws in some Bunny theatre for good measure (perhaps as a kind of meta-comment on arts inability to make heads or tails of our chaotic existence).

This is intensely enjoyable for lovers of the avant-garde and/or lovers of psychological horror films like Polanski's Repulsion, Roeg's Don't Look Now, Kubrick's The Shining, and Lynch's own Mulholland Drive.",1228348800,6,2894,4.879837067209776

The number of complexities involved in the branching (and somewhat parallel) plot lines, and the fact that the movie itself is at least partly about making movies, make a synopsis virtually impossible to relate.

The whole movie seems a lot like a series of dreams (or nightmares) that were woven together with a fictional backdrop in order to create a connection between the dreams.

Now, as for the film itself, it's really quite difficult to describe the plot more concisely than the review and product description on the site. But suffice it to say, If you're a Lynch fan there is no reason you shouldn't love this film. However, I can see how the average non-Lynch fan might get a bit frustrated with this.

2839554,3,B000QQFKYE,"David Lynch is one of my favorite filmmakers, so when I first heard that he was filming ""Inland Empire"" with a DV camera, I was doubly excited.  Any time I hear that Lynch is working on a new project, it's cause for celebration, and the fact that he was filming the movie with a camera accessible to almost anyone made it all the more intriguing. Knowing that Lynch is an artist with little inclination to spell things out or dumb anything down for his viewers, I was aware that the 3 hour film was going to be a trip.  As I have discovered with most of Lynch's projects, the trip is often the entire point in appreciating the film, rather than the conclusion, or any ending summation.  However, with ""Inland Empire"", the trip is often rocky and fraught with an obtuseness that appears to be thrown in, not for art's sake, but for the sake of seeing how far the viewer will go along with it before heading for the door (or the STOP button).

I love the way the imagery turned out--the DV camera has served Lynch well, and though there are some exceptions, most of the film looks as though it was filmed with professional equipment.  This should be especially encouraging for aspiring filmmakers, to whom I would recommend this film for that reason alone--it demonstrates how much can be accomplished without a great expenditure of money.

The acting is also worth mentioning.  Laura Dern gives an exceptional performance as a film actress trying to revive her career by starring in the remake of an allegedly cursed film in which the two leads died. She alternately plays the role (in the film within the film) of a lower class woman stuck in a bad marriage (something that Nikki, the actress, is familiar with).  Dern is never less than riveting, even when it's unclear whether or not she knows where her character(s) is headed.

Jeremy Irons makes an interesting film director, with Lynch regular, Justin Theroux, believable as the male lead in Nikki's film (and later, in Nikki's bed).

While the film is being shot in Los Angeles, there is an alternate storyline involving a woman whose abusive husband has her locked up in a hotel room in Poland, forcing her to watch increasingly disturbing television programming.

To be honest, three hours seems a little excessive for these personal dramas that, eventually, do interconnect, and therein may lie a big part of the problem.  Because ""Inland Empire"", for all its worth as the product of a great artist and filmmaker, is never more than the sum of its parts, and those parts, in this case, aren't intriguing enough to warrant a lengthy treatment more befitting an epic.  I don't hate ""Inland Empire"" in the way that I've hated some of the other movies I've reviewed here, but I didn't love it, either.",1215475200,,2756,4.681159420289855
2839555,5,B000QQFKYE,"The thing I don't understand about most people is that they say the films of David Lynch are impossible to understand.  If you watch and pay attention, not everything is going to necessarily make perfect sense, but you're going to get the jist of what he's trying to do.

In this brilliant new film (certainly as good as, if not better, than ""Mulholland Drive"" in many ways), Laura Dern gives on the most terrifying performances I have ever seen as promising, beautiful actress Nikki Grace/ a low income, degraded, hideous woman who has nowhere to go.
If you want an idea of the kind of non-linear, angst-ridden surreality you're in for, here's an example:

about a half an hour of the film is devoted to Susan, not Nikki's, plight with a group of prostitutes, some looking like Hollywood stars and others
like crack addicts.  She is stabbed by her Polish husband in the cursed film.  Bleeding to death on the Hollywood strip all over the ""stars"", a homeless black woman says: ""You're dyin', lady"".  Then a Japanese girl speaks in her native language--while Dern's schizoid character is dying--about a bus going to somewhere else in Hollywood.  This takes about five minutes.  Then the black woman holds up a lighter and says to Dern: ""Sometimes we die, is all.  Here.  You see this light?  You won't see no blue when you wake up.""  Then Jeremy Irons bursts in with his megaphone screaming ""Bravo!  Smashing cut!""

Either Nikki was never Nikki or she was Nikki and became Susan once she prostituted herself for Devon.  Or Susan fantasized about being Nikki.  In any case, this is schizoid identity crisis in the extreme, but more than that a very nicely placed punch on the nose of Hollywood itself: as in ""MH"", he portrays most actors and actresses as elitist snobs who are amazingly empty and superficial apart from their roles, wrought with hanger ons and arrogant directors.  I don't know if this is Lynch's conspiratorial, paranoid fantasy about Hollywood or how it actually is.  This movie is brilliant, exciting, terrifying, and simply enjoyable all the way around.  Art.  Lynch continues to transcend himself.

2839556,5,B000QQFKYE,"David Lynch has consistently been one of my favorite filmmakers.  He doesn't work often, but when he does it's an event.  No other major filmmaker has been able to so exquisitely expose to us his very subconscious in such frightening, arresting ways.  ""Inland Empire"" is now the third straight Lynch film -- after ""Lost Highway"" and ""Mulholland Drive"" -- to explore a similar subject in a similar style.  All three films appear to be about guilt fracturing a person's personality.

Visually, this may be Lynch's best film.  Playing around with his little digital camera, Lynch creates stunning, scary, skin-crawling images that will leave you totally unnerved.  Actors' faces pushed close into wide-angle lenses, Edward Hopper-esque still settings of the ""bunny family,"" actors leaning into still shots from out of frame, light and shadow and noise used to completely shock your senses.  ""Inland Empire"" is an atmospheric feast.

With all the gimmicky, dumb horror movies out there -- with their killers and ghouls and other nonsense -- here was a movie that, simply with visual and auditory style, scared the hell out of me.

With a Lynch movie, people always want to know if it really makes sense in the end.  Does ""Inland Empire""?  I don't know.  I'll admit I'm not sure how all the threads fit together.  But who cares?  I don't think you have to understand every component of a Lynch film to enjoy it.  ""Inland Empire,"" to me, is a stygian nightmare vision -- paranoia, the subconscious, fear, jealousy all alight across the screen.

Forget about making sense of this movie and instead enjoy Lynch's showmanship -- the lighting, the camera work, the soundtrack -- and the incredible performances he receives, especially from Laura Dern and Julia Ormond.

""Inland Empire"" is another brilliant glimpse into Lynch's mind.",1214092800,4,1823,5.040133779264214
2839557,1,B000QQFKYE,"I once had an argument with some friends who detested The Beatles.  I love them - even an earlier, deceptively simple song like 'Please Please Me' is sheer melodic genius.  These friends thought their 'argument winner' was ""Ok...what about 'Ob La Di, Ob La Da' then, huh?!"".

Hmmm... 'Inland Empire' is David Lynch's 'Ob La Di, Ob La Da' - lousy output from a very fine artist.  I loved the intrigue of 'Lost Highway', and 'Mulholland Drive' still haunts me.  But with 'Inland Empire' the riddles and twists left me absolutely cold.  The Lynch ingredients are there but the cake just doesn't rise.  I guess it's what can happen when the usual budgetary constraints of film-making are lessened to a large degree by the opportunity to shoot digitally.  Discipline and restraint can go out the window as the director gets carried away with his new-found 'freedom'.

Quite liked the rabbit sitcom though.... One star for that.",1212883200,3,922,4.858974358974359
2839558,4,B000QQFKYE,"Regarding INLAND EMPIRE, David Lynch said digital filmmaking was a revelation for him and he'd never return to conventional cinematic hardware.  The smaller equipment offered greater freedom of movement and the superior light-capturing ability allowed for less cumbersome set-ups and more ""natural"" takes.

And also--he can shoot FOREVER and it don't cost nothin'.

The digital world allows Lynch, in INLAND EMPIRE, to, finally, fully indulge in his obsession with the dread eminating from mid-century modern furniture.

This isn't so much a movie as a meditation on the decor.

As for the story, it's Brand Lynch: the main character (Laura Dern) suffers through endless fracturings of persona and reality.

What's new here is the time alloted for the background to roar and yawn and seeth/fester/stutter in tones from dullest taupe to fever red to blinding flourescence.

Lynch sees the normality of these 1950s Americana settings as a mask getting ready to fall and expose a truly horrible underneath.

Though I think this one has a happy ending.  Your call.

INLAND EMPIRE isn't great Lynch, like BLUE VELVET or MULHOLLAND DRIVE.  It lacks narrative cohesion.  BUT--it's something to fall into, watch several times, groove on the truly uncomfortable vibe, maybe nod off and dream some weird stuff yourself and see how it fits into Lynch's bizarre, utterly unique Living Space.

2839559,4,B000QQFKYE,"Inland Empire (David Lynch, 2006)

If a David Lynch movie doesn't have me sitting in the theater muttering ""WTF?"" under my breath at least once, it's not doing its job. On the other hand, when I spend more time than not sitting there muttering ""WTF?"" under my breath to myself, maybe it's doing its job a bit too well (and people have a tendency to move away from you at times like that. Except the creepy ones. And you really don't want to have anything to do with them).

Here's what I've got for you, and I warn you my perception of the plot may be way, way off: Nikki Grace (Laura Dern) and Devon Berk (Justin Theroux) are cast as the lead actors in a remake of a never-finished Polish film that's supposedly cursed. We alternate between scenes of ""reality"" (as much as anything can be reality in Hollywoodland), scenes of the production itself, scenes of the original Polish film, and scenes of Nikki Grace losing her grip on reality and seeing the world as if she is Susan Blue, the character she portrays in the film. A Lynchian exploration of the Stanislavsky Method? As time goes on, Lynch ensures that our perceptions of the division between Nikki Grace and Susan Blue are similarly distorted-- though it must be said that there would have been a much sharper dividing line had the ""reality"" of the first hour or so of the film felt a lot less unreal. (When your second scene involves a sitcom starring a family of rabbits, ""unreal"" is only one of the many, many words that comes to mind.)

As is to be expected from any film put out by David Lynch, there's an entire parade of familiar faces, both from earlier Lynch movies (Dern has been a favorite of his for twenty years, while Theroux is a newer acquisition, but has popped up in Lynch's films before) and from the wider world of film (Harry Dean Stanton, Jeremy Irons, Cameron Daddo, Julia Ormond, William H. Macy, and Mary Steenburgen are only a small sampling). In a production like this, ironically, the raft of familiar faces serves to anchor the viewer in reality-- you know these people, you've seen them scores of times over the past few decades. One wonders if Lynch would have been able to cast reality completely to the winds had he used a cast of unknowns.

Oddly, this put me in mind of John Carpenter's short Cigarette Burns. I'm not entirely sure why, other than the obsession with filmmaking and the cursed-film-within-a-film conceit. Maybe it's because Norman Reedus and Justin Theroux are always getting mixed up in my head for whatever reason (with Michael J. Fox lurking on the edges like one of those people who doesn't move away from me in theaters). Maybe it's because Carpenter's finally back on his game, at least judging by Cigarette Burns. (Lynch, of course, hasn't been off his game in thirty years.) Whatever. In any case, Inland Empire is a movie you'll need to watch multiple times to get any sense of what's going on, but as with most of David Lynch's films, it's well worth the time you'll spend puzzling it out. I know I'll be putting in another three viewings just to make sure I've got the plot right. *** ",1212105600,3,3107,4.570915619389587

But, in the aforementioned movie, there was a semblance of a plot, even if it's chopped up and moved around a bit.  This is nothing more than a rush of imagery with nothing coherent holding it together.  Lynch lets us into his head, but not his heart.  It's difficult to feel anything when he only shows us random images, strong colors and chaos, with nothing, in my mind, that glues them together.  In fact, for someone that loves to indict Hollywood, he sure seems obsessed with LaLa Land. And that's already been done and done better (see Mulholland Drive).

2839572,4,B000QQFKYE,"You have probably gathered by now that this is a surrealist film in David Lynch's most extreme style.  (I should probably say watching it is a surreal experience as it probably isn't strictly a surrealist film).

The imagination, drama, and power for which we love his work is all there. And so is the mystery, in spades.  If you thought Mulholland Drive was hard to understand or, in simpler English, didn't make sense, you ain't seen nuffin' till you've watched this one.

The typical comment of artists when facing an enquiry of something hard to understand is to declare the question invalid.  There's nothing to understand, it just is.  But everything has to have some standard against which it can be judged.  If it isn't supposed to mean anything, if the plot isn't supposed to make sense, if there is no answer to the question whether a certain incident is a scene from the film within the film or a scene in the actress's ""inland empire"" of the mind, then there must be some other route to appreciation or coherence.  If I tell you I had a weird dream, and proceed to list a meaningless series of random events, that won't be very interesting to you.  It may be interesting if I succeed in showing how those events are symbolic for actual conflicts in my life.

So the question we need to ask is whether the lack of narrative is justified, whether all this weirdness, mystery and incoherence actually achieves anything.  Does it add up to some real insight about this unfortunate lady's mind or does it just tell us that she was as deranged as we feel on leaving the cinema?  In the case of Mulholland Drive I was in no doubt the answer was yes, it was justified.  You couldn't express the events of the film as a logical narrative but you felt that the strangeness pointed the way to an understanding of what Lynch was trying to say.

My question is by definition very hard to answer.  It may be worth watching the film just to try to answer it.  (But bearing in mind how long and slow it is, that's not certain).  In my view the case for Inland Empire is much weaker than Mulholland Drive.  Mulholland Drive was definitely a good film, and one that rewarded a second viewing.  After watching Inland Empire I was unconvinced.  Maybe a second viewing would have convinced me, but I didn't feel like watching it again.",1209427200,2,2326,4.532374100719425

Although this movie contains a plethora of dark and wonderful elements, the whole does not equal the sum of the parts. I think the ultimate problem is the story lacks a compelling central character. About halfway through the movie I ceased to care what happened to Laura Dern, in any of her incarnations. Also, while the movie is laden with the sense of mystery and forboding that is a Lynch trademark, it quickly loses any effect because there is never any payoff.

David Lynch no is longer harassed by studios who are angry they agreed to work with DL in the first place, not worried about theatrical distribution (sadly I believe theaters are going to go out for good and will become as common as drive-ins, which may give rise to better films in theaters maybe) and doesn't have to fear freeloaders like Roger Ebert deciding for the mass public that his films aren't worth your time. With the internet and digital film (cutting the cost dramatically) artists are more free and can easily get their goods out to the fans and those who are curious can read many many informed opinions on all types of websites, messageboards, blogs, or a simple email, not having to rely on whats printed in JUST ONE review in a paper. David Lynch having a brutal career within the studio system is finally free to do whatever he wants and Inland Empire is an excessive 3 hour jam session on modest equipment and like any other jam session, it can be taken in bits or you can let it rush over you at once. It doesn't seem to make much of a difference in this case.

  I'm not wasting any time saying OH DUDE ITS SO WEIRD, I personally don't find any movies or music made by human beings ""weird"" anymore. Finding films weird is something you must have gotten over by now in this day and age unless you truly are fresh off Transformers The Movie being your best day at the cinema. Like most Lynch movies this is like a long lucid dream where one central object continuously morphs, ideas fade in and out, sometimes its senseless, funny, boring, unnerving or even moving.

Here's my plot summary, and I hope it won't spoil anything for those who haven't seen Inland Empire yet:

A movie actress gets a part in a ""cursed"" project, a re-make of an Eastern-European movie, which suffered the murder of its original starlet.  Through a series of extremely odd and delightfully weird events, the modern actress (Laura Dern) begins to dip in and out of the original Polish (?) movie, and begins to see that she may be able to save the life of the woman who created her role.  Can she do it?  And what will it cost her?

You can spin as many themes off of that as you please, and the first one that seems to emerge is the sympathy between artists, who understand the transient nature of their work, and their lives.

I saw one review that mentioned the loss of impact on a small screen, but I was lucky, and watched it on a huge 54"" Hitachi TV, with a lovely sound system.

Why are those topless dancers doing the ""Locomotion"" 2/3rds of the way through?  I have absolutely no idea.  But it was as startling as anything else in nearly every moment of the show.

Her mother's hand was squashed ""flat as a pancake."" Finally psychiatrist guy utters his first words, ""I like pancakes.""

Not everything, after all, has to be approached or understood on a rational, ""mainstream narrative"" basis.  But unlike Mr. Lynch's ""Mulholland Drive"", which had two beautiful actresses, occasional stretches of regular storytelling, and (let's be honest) generous amounts of firing-on-all-cylinders erotic content to make all the surrealism go down easier, ""Inland Empire"" offers only murky cinematography, dreary eastern European locales, and yet another repeat of that old Lynch stand-by, the ol' ""one character all of a sudden becoming another character"" thing.  And it's all wrapped in a whopping-long running time of two hours and fifty-nine minutes.

The movie isn't worthless.  It's laced with intense acting, effective moments of creepiness, and the kind of weirdness only David Lynch could create (the sitcom rabbit people take the cake here on that score).

The DVD is not un-generous, however.  Disc two redeems the proceedings a bit.  While the ample deleted scenes (""more things that happened"") did nothing for me, I enjoyed the various features highlighting Mr. Lynch himself: he tells stories, runs around on the set of ""Inland Empire"" interacting with his cast and crew, and even shares with us a recipe for one of his favorite quick meals.  All fun, all engaging, and- most importantly- decidedly NOT boring.

I'd give the DVD as a whole a ""soft recommendation"", but only if one has a, well... soft spot for David Lynch.  But the movie itself barely gets the two-star rating I selected.

But at a certain point Lynch loses control of the story, as he does in other films. David Lynch is certainly an artist. His films are a unique kind of beautiful nightmare. But ""Inland Empire"" shows a lack of discipline in editing. It is a very long movie with too many superfluous scenes.

Fans of David Lynch will enjoy trying to make sense of the confusion of identities, times and places; others will lose patience. Is Laura Dern the Hollywood actress, the woman with a Southern accent having an affair with Justin Theroux, the woman living in a low-rent neighborhood of Inland Southern California, or a prostitute on Hollywood Boulevard? (For a true stranger-than-fiction account of life in the real Inland Empire, read Gary Kern's memoir of life in Riverside, California, ""Letters from Dwight."").

2839606,5,B000QQFKYE,"Love him or hate him, there is no other director like David Lynch.  True, his films are not for everyone and so reviewing or recommending his work is always a difficult process.  If you've seen, and appreciated, his previous movies then you will surely love ""Inland Empire"", Lynch's most daring, creative and challenging work to date.  If not, than this film is probably not for you.

As other reviewers have noted, the plot of this movie revolves around an actress (Laura Dern) who's life becomes intertwined with a character she's playing.  Of course, it sounds a little gimicky, but Dern's transition from one reality to another is pulled off with eerie perfection.  Perhaps less narrative than some of his previous films, Lynch develops atmosphere, tone and mood to create a three hour nightmare of loosely connected scenes and images - for example, the frequent shots of giant rabbits in a bizarre, sit-com-like tableaux seem to have little to do with Dern and the rest of the film.  Pulled back and forth between time and place, the audience is left disoriented and looking for answers until the final scene.  Whether you love it or hate it, you will never see another movie like ""Inland Empire"".",1195862400,3,1202,4.857843137254902
2839607,3,B000QQFKYE,"The movie centers around an enormously wealthy actress Nikki (Dern) who after getting an usual visit by a crazed Polish immigrant neighbor (Twin Peaks's Grace Zabriskie), Nikki gets a call from her agent telling her she got casted in the role of Sue in this of this romantic movie.  Still in pre-production the movie was soon revealed by the director (Jeremy Irons) that the movie was in fact a remake of a Polish movie that was never finished because the main actress died during filming.  After that the movie goes into a winding trip in which we follow Nikki/Sue dealing with her abusive husband who has connection with the Polish mob, visiting a Psychiactric counselor in a rundown building, several obscure scenes with people in bunny suits, encountering drug addicted prostitues along the Hollywood strip and in Nikki/Sue home, wondering if she is in reality or not and constant shots of a city in Poland.

I wouldnt say this is my favorite David Lynch movie (that goes to ""Blue Velvet"", ""Wild At Heart"" and ""Mulholland Drive"") it was too long ""almost 3 hours of non stop acid trip"".  It dragged on!  There were lots of unnecessary scenes in this movie that should've been left in the cutting room floor, one particular scene that seems like Lynch was ripping on Tarantino's style of endless dialog.  IMO this movie wouldve been better if Lynch boggled it down to at least one and a half or two hours long.  Interesting this movie does feature cameos such as Willam H. Macy, Mary Steenbergen (Back to the Future 3), Diane Ladd, and Julia Ormond.",1195344000,3,1551,4.743494423791821

Laura Dern doesn't even feature in this spectacular overture but the film is all hers, it's her Inland Empire we peer into and by the end she's watching, literally, with us. Every frame of this film is vital and with more in common with music than convential cinema, demands that we watch, and I mean really look, at what's being projected to us and then re watch again and again. Laura Dern's character talks of men revealing themselves over time, eventually exposing their true nature and that is what this masterpiece does also. In time you feel you understand what you're watching, that you feel your way to a conclusion and it really is a very beautiful thing.",1195257600,6,893,4.8431372549019605
2839609,3,B000QQFKYE,"Look, I love me some David Lynch. In my opinion, and the opinion of most of his fans, is that he is one of the few artists working in the medium of film. So, because of both this and the six year wait since his last film, the amazing ""Mulholland Drive"", I was more than hyped up to see his latest picture, ""Inland Empire"". And since it never got around to playing where I live, I had to wait around until it was released on DVD.
So anyways, what's my take on ""Inland Empire""? Well...
""Inland Empire"" is neither of of Lynch's best (it's not ""Mulholland"" or ""Blue Velvet"" or ""Lost Highway"") nor is it one of his worst (hey, anything is better than ""Dune"", right?), but the movie still feels a little like a placeholder, like Lynch is spinning his wheels a little bit, making what feels, at times, like someone trying to approximate a David Lynch film.
Now did get me wrong. If you are a David Lynch fan you will find plenty of stuff to like about ""Inland Empire"". The problem is is that because of it's three hour running time, you will also have to sit through a lot of sutff that doesn't work as well.
In fact, the biggest problem with this movie is the fact that it is far too long by about forty five minutes. The parts and scenes of this movie that work work as well as anything the man has done. But far too often scens just go nowhere and add to nothing.
Also, the film being shot on consumer digital video, peridocially the movie looks cheap, as if it was made by an upstart cable network.
But the film does work sometimes, and when it works it really works, and Laura Dern turns in what is by far her best performance to date. Add to that, the DVD is well put together with some cool extras (including over an hour of delted scenes, which should at least make fans happy that this movie isn't four hours long), and fans of David Lynch will need to add it to their collection.
Non-fans, however, should probably go and check out ""Mulholland Drive"" or ""Blue Velvet"" first.",1194739200,3,1977,4.288770053475936
2839610,5,B000QQFKYE,"Where ""Inland Empire"" starts is a signal pointing to where it's going.  It's an old lit crit cliche that I used to  use when teaching college classes in difficulty literature: forget about ""meaning"" for a while, and simply look at what you're looking at when you're looking at it.  In books, it's the words on the page; in movies, it's two things: (1) the image on the screen (whatever its connectd/disconnected relation to what came before and what follows). And (2) the verifiable ""ground"" of all the rest: what's actually happening as represented on the film that projectors project onto a white screen.

Looked at this way, ""Inland Empire"" has a lot more nudging-you-in-the-rib clues than such items as ""Lost Highway"" and ""Mulholland Drive.""  We got a movie, we got a script that was done--incompletely--once before but aborted when the actors started playing out the script's love afair for real.  So reality/movie reality is already in play before you even buy you ticket at the box office.  We know from this that it's probable that the current actors--Niki and Devon--are going to reduplicate the previous reduplication.

And then: we learn that there's a ""Polish connection"": a folk-tale about--judging by what actually happens in the film called ""Inland Empire""--love affairs/vengeful husbands/beaten wives/confusion between what is desired and imagined and what isn't.

Once you begin with these in-you-face donnees, everything else that follows follows.  Niki is the vehicle here, and curiously the Devon character simply disappears.  So everything in the movie gets acted out in Niki's ""real"" life, and everything that happens in Nicki's real life is going to happen in the movie.  Which movie?  ""Inland Empire"" or ""High on Blue Tomorrows"" (got that title right?)?  Well, what did you expect: both, dummy.

Cutting to the chase, Lynch with the above possible combinations to play with, is going to do exactly what he does: move the ""plot"" in and out of all of the above combinations and parallels in any order that you like.  Why?  Because, at bottom they're all the same story, even to the point where Polish prols show up at the backyard barbecue in the southern town's wrong-side-of-the-track neighborhood where the souhern adultress ""Sue"" ends up.

The ""moral""?  Never assume that you know what your own literal reality is on the basis of your belief in your capacity to spot the ""merely"" metaphorical or fictional or non-existent.  What we think is what we are and what we dream is what we think, and what we do turns our lives into metaphorical fiction.  We factually ""are"" by Lynch's very down-to-earth logic all our possibilities.  You think you can tell the difference between your ""real"" life and your ""fictional"" live(s)?

The simpliest and in the same time, the most ambicious work of him.y

2839615,5,B000QQFKYE,"Plot:  This is the wrong idea to start from as it's possible to write a thesis on the various interpretations of the film.  Anyway here's my take on it.

Like Mulholland Drive this is a dreamscape told symbolically via Hollywood, with all of the attendant illusion and memory.  A projector leads us to the inland empire (the internal world of the mind--here a sleeping mind very much as in Finnegans Wake) to replay incidents from the life and violently derailed marriage of a woman seen from different angles as she sleeps.  She's a whore, a killer, a betrayer, a wreck, a liar, and an `actress' both haunting and berating herself.  On the way Lynch plays with coded themes--the Axxon N references (axons in the brain with the added X and N mathematical symbols for multiplication and factoring, i.e., the endlessly complex mind dividing ceaselessly back into itself), the carefully buried yet clearly evident sexuality of the human-form rabbits (as in ""breeding like rabbits"") in their weird stilted sit-com with their secrets and problems of identity,  the stories within stories that smack of the imagination, the dislocations of time and space which do the same, the artifice/uncertainty of the settings, the need to defeat an illusive `phantom' and the probing camera (the restless eye more as an I) which is always there just behind the scenes.  Finally there is the symbolic death and self-reconciliation which seem to have become key Lynchian themes, plus the big clunking subconscious-heavy reference (sawing wood as the clich for snoring/dreaming) as a tip-off in case you didn't get it.

On a second viewing I felt like setting-up a help group for the people who were probably wrong about Lynch's artistic motivations for creating this movie--before promptly signing myself into it.  In any case, noting that the relatively straightforward Mulholland Drive had puzzled much of its audience, I think any group of that kind would oversubscribe in seconds.

Inland Empire is deliberately irrational and determinedly non-linear so if you're not prepared to give it enough time, and spend some effort spinning theories,  then just don't bother. You'll probably hate it with a passion.

Cast:  A welcome return for some of Lynch's regulars and semi-regulars, along with brilliant character portraits from first timers.  There is no doubt this is Laura Dern's best performance and the film would be a complete mess without her.

Imagery:  The most striking in all of his work.  Although the lack of polished 35mm sometimes counts against him, Lynch has turned the digital process into something uniquely beautiful and/or terrifying.  The scenes in which people fade-in or suddenly disappear, as if in a dream, are magnificent.  The sudden bursts of colour are equally dazzling and some of the computer manipulations are 18-cert disturbing.

Lynchisms:  The entire film is one long Lynchian carnival.  If you know his cinema then you'll be busy spotting references to Blue Velvet, Twin Peaks, Mulholland Drive, Wild At Heart, Eraserhead, The Straight Story and (sadly) Lost Highway.  For real Lynch aficionados there are also the above mentioned inclusions of Rabbits and references to Axxon N, which were previously limited to online subscription.  Likewise the dialogue is Pinter via Days Of Our Lives and the shifting timeframe is pure 2001--there's even the same kind of Louis XVI furniture and bits of a very popular Kubrick horror score.

Rating:  Inland Empire is not Lynch's best film.  It suffers from a lack of editorial control and is at times sloppy and self-indulgent.  In a similarly negative vein, the entire project wobbles dangerously close to being weird and difficult just for the sake of it.  As Lynch had already done this with his clunker Lost Highway, the hope was that he'd learned his lesson.  IMO at least the Straight Story and Mulholland Drive seemed to show that he'd regained the disciplined mind of an artist and not that of an over coddled ego let loose to create a mess.  Plus there is quite a bit of Transcendental Meditation in here, and despite what Lynch says he is fronting for a cult.

The plus sides, however, are thoroughly rewarding and Inland Empire should not be missed.  For three solid hours it plays as one of the most disorientating, hallucinogenic experiences that you'll ever see.  It's so honestly mentally invasive that you'll end-up dreaming sections of it...I just hope they're the pleasant ones.  I never want to relive that endless house again.  Nor do I want to cross the backdrop of an empty soundstage while ripping the sheets off my bed looking for an exit.

In summary:  If Lynch has decided to go hell-for-leather after his own brand of weird visions then good for him--even if it turns out to be a mistake and his career closes with Lost Highway 10.  If that's what he finally shuffles away with then I'll still respect the man as he's earned my loyalty.

My only concern is the inclusion of  increasing references to TM in Lynch's work, as it has the kind of dark reputation which befits its brand of pseudo-scientific nonsense.  My advice is to take a meme inoculation before accepting Lynch's PR role and look instead to his artistic foundations.  You probably came for those anyway, and not for some deluded sales pitch on behalf of the Maharishi Mahesh Yogi.",1192752000,11,5330,4.987542468856172

Lynch is a genious, unparalled in hollywood. He really went off on his own tangent here and pretty much filmed a 3 hour long nightmare.

The scene where Laura looked at the camera and slowly approached it was one of the scariest damn things I've ever seen.

No sense going into the story here, it makes little sense whilst watching it buy it was sensational and challenging viewing, all in all a total brilliant film and I'll be glad to have it in my DVD collection with the other Lynch favourites.

2839618,4,B000QQFKYE,"In a room where beautiful young whores languish and occasionally perform choreographed musical dance routines, David Lynch once again proves that he will take second fiddle to noone, as the head concubine to the whore goddess Diana.
 Lynch's sudden injection of a set of full, beautiful, ""pretty"" bosoms, is to keep us alert and on our toes. To sharpen the senses as the movie wanes towards its hemhorraged conclusion.
 Lynch loves to leave the frail minds of his viewers twisting in the breeze, as many of his re-occuring themes would indicate. But it is some of his new material which becomes the real treat in ""Inland Empire"".
 The black rabbits (those are definitely not bunnies, children) are a nice touch, and the opening sequence in which they are featured, may well be the second greatest, singular piece of cinematography ever recorded, behind only Victor Erice's capturing of a young Ana Torrent's re-action to seeing Frankenstein appear on film for the first time, in a small Castilian village, in the wake of the Spanish civil war, in the beautifully done Spanish classic, ""The Spirit of the Beehive"".
 Shot in sit-com type sequence, this morbid little tour de farce skewers the genre, in an unflinching, parodial form.
 The way the male rabbit enters the room to glorious applause, then proceeds to just stand there a mute, as well as the audience's outbursts of mirth at apparently dry and indescript lines of dialogue; top shelf. Then, when the one female rabbit laughs in a desperate manner, it is in direct contrast to her audience's canned amusement, priceless, and must be viewed on great dope in order to be fully appreciated, methinks.
 I would forever be thankful for David Lynch, if the only film he ever did was, ""Twin Peaks: Fire Walk With Me"". That was my introduction to his strange and twisted world. I was young, impressionable, and had gotten ahold of the Killah, the stuff with frosty white hairs glistening on the buds. I was transfixed, to say the least. I watched it with a couple of buddies, in this dump of a trailer we shacked in for a summer, while starving and shearing Christmas trees.
 It is Laura Palmer's mother who makes a re-appearance here, as a withered old seer of unknown, but seemingly Balkan, origin. Trully the stellar performance of the show. She gives Laura Dern's character the crazy eye, and the lilting grin, while making apparant small talk about psychotic jibberish, which we later find to be the profound, under-riding currents the movie is carried on. ""A boy steps through his door into the world and notices his shadow, thus, Evil is born, and follows the boy wherever he goes."" Mystical wisdom for the ages.
 While many Polish women are elegant and charming, Lynch's spot-on portrayal of Polish men in this movie, casts them in the beastly light they so richly deserve.
 We get a glimpse of a take on the whole time travel theory, as represented by a silk hanky being folded and pierced through. then one looks through the hole, etc. (i.e. the Wrinkle in Time)
 I also found the orange-lighted lamps to be quite pleasant, something I should like to get for around the house, my ownself.
 And, as in all his flicks, lynch includes a greenish-brown doorway, (""This would look nice on your wall"") which leads down a crooked hall, obviously the portal to his soul. Amen.",1191974400,5,3329,4.8024475524475525

I know making sense is not his intent, but this one was like watching channel changing for three hours straight.

This movie, shot in video, seems like a very experimental picture. Some effects work and others don't. David Lynch says that ""He'll never go back to film"" after using digital video for this movie. I hope that he'll reconsider in the future. The purity of film in his hands is magical.

Laura Dern gives perhaps the greatest performance of her career as multiple characters, the first of which is an actress hired under less than clear circumstances to appear in a commercial melodrama called On High and Blue Tomorrows. What is incredible about Inland Empire is how engaging it remains despite its incoherent plot and structure.

As a longtime Lynchhead, and a great admirer of films like Eraserhead, Blue Velvet, Lost Highway, and Mullholland Drive, Inland Empire takes all of the things that made those films great and ups the ante in the most provocative way. Of course, naysayers will say that this film is turgid and incomprehensible. Think of Lynch as Samuel Beckett's illegitimate son and maybe his art will begin to make sense (you'll get a better idea of where he's coming from, at least). It's long (3 hours), and it will test your patience at times, but Inland Empire is without question a new watermark in avant-garde American cinema.

2839623,2,B000QQFKYE,"I've always been ambivalent about David Lynch. His films are always interesting,  original, often beautifully shot, yet at the same time confusing and arguably lacking in real meaning beyond the images. While movies like Blue Velvet and Wild At Heart at least have plots that hold all the weirdness together,  Inland Empire for me represents the extreme in all the things I don't care for in Lynch's films. It is very long and completely confusing. It is rather self-indulgent with many lengthy scenes without much going on, shot in dark rooms or corridors.

This is a film for hardcore Lynch fans, who will not only forgive but give high praise to every random whim that he decides to throw into a movie. I have to admit that I only saw about half of it, but in this case I think that was enough to get the essence. I almost turned it off after the first fifteen minutes of watching people in rabbit costumes mumbling in a dark room. More than anything else, this reminds me of an avant-garde performance piece, where characters improvise random and bizarre actions and it's up to the audience to figure out what it all means.

Either I'm just not sophisticated and perceptive enough to appreciate the nuances and deeper meaning of Inland Empire, or it really is a convoluted mess. I will say, that despite this harsh appraisal, that the film is exquisitely photographed and that many of the performances are excellent. Laura Dern gets completely into this role and truly looks like someone in the middle of a nightmare, or perhaps suffering through a bad acid trip.

You can tell, because Lynch--who is always painfully particular about detail, has had the freedom of movement, lenght of film, lighting variability, independent control, and budget of digital film.  He says he will use only digital now.  I think his film open broader as they go, and I'm excited to see what the next one will bring.",1191110400,3,615,4.527272727272727

Filmed entirely digitally (Lynch fell in love with the technique prior to making the film), Inland Empire finds Lynch re-teaming with his Blue Velvet and Wild at Heart star Laura Dern.  Dern plays struggling actress Nikki Grace, who has just gotten a big time role as the adulterous Susan Blue, and soon enough her own life starts to mirror the life of the role she is playing, and as secrets of the film's sordid history unfold, Lynch takes us on a dizzying, identity crisis-fueled trip.  Clocking in at three hours, Inland Empire is by far Lynch's most indulgent film to date, and because of the running time and Lynch's own absurdist film techniques, devoted Lynch fans may have a tough time getting all the way through.  However, Lynch's techniques are also what make Inland Empire worth seeing, and Dern shines as well, who it's great to see once again in a starring role.  Jeremy Irons is on board as the film's director, and he's here all too brief.  Lynch regulars Justin Theroux, Harry Dean Stanton, and Laura Harring (in a cameo) are here as well, but Dern is the real star of Lynch's twisted show.  The special features are actually worth seeing, and there's some insightful features from Lynch to boot.  All in all, Inland Empire isn't always coherent or easy to decipher (and that's saying it lightly), but it's pure Lynch all the way, and many of his hardcore fans will not be disappointed.",1191024000,4,1529,4.637037037037037

And what did the stupid rabbit head scenes have to do with anything?  For that matter what did any of the movie have to do with anything?  It made absolutely NO sense.

I was unable to watch the movie in theaters (so bad!) in Detroit area simply because it wasn't shown there, so I waited 9 months since it's DVD premiere to buy and enjoy it! The Italian dubbed versions on the Internet only made my interest rise. As a great Lynch cinema lover and professional musician/composer/engineer/producer I highly admire this great production. The second DVD with extra features deserve special attention and hats down to David for bringing us these details of his movie-magic!

2839632,5,B000QQFKYE,"I saw ""Inland Empire"" last night and I am totally overwhelmed. It is brilliant, amazing, mesmerizing - you name it. I love every one of its 180 minutes and I did not want it to end. Both, ""Eraserhead"" and ""Mulholland Dr."" pale in comparison. ""Inland Empire"" quotes them, references them as well as ""Blue Velvet"" and ""Twin Peaks"" and Lynch's short films but it goes further and looks deeper. I wonder if it will be possible for Lynch to ever surpass ""Inland Empire"". It is his crown achievement. I watched it last night alone, in the dark, and at some point I suddenly realized that I was wired to its hellish Universe, that I was transported to Inland Empire of horrors, and I was surrounded and almost swallowed up by its infernal/internal fears, nightmares, guilt and regrets which I had to face all alone just like Laura/ Nikki/Sue did.  I am not sure if I understood the meaning of every image or every frame or every scene of the movie or even what movie I was watching every given moment, ""Inland Empire"" or ""On High In Blue Tomorrows""? Or maybe I was watching ""Broken dreams On High In Blue Tomorrows of Inland Empire""? I don't care - not everything should and can be explained. The following is the quote from the review of a Russian film critic, Marianna Shaternikova, the longtime loyal Lynch's admirer. She was not swept away by ""Inland Empire"" but I found her opinion of David Lynch and his world very close to what I think of him:

""David Lynch possesses rich imagination and strange unusual talent. A figure of international fame and admiration, Lynch believes that life is very complicated and the movies should be equally complicated. His is the world of magic and mystery without any explanations. Very often, the plots of his movies are perplexing but Lynch would never offer any interpretation. According to him, ""people can't accept the fact that the life, the existence has no sense, no reason. This fact makes them nervous and uncertain. Perhaps, Religion and mythology had been created as an attempt to make some sense in the existence.""

It is quite obvious that ""Inland Empire"" would split even Lynch's devoted fans. Some of them believe that their favorite director ""lost it"" and indulged himself in three hours of ""Blatant narcissism"", ""Self-Indulgence or ""Self Importance"" while the others think his latest film is a unique amazing work of a master and transfixing movie watching experience. I fail to understand why it can't be both? Does it really matter that Lynch returns over and over again to the same themes, that the same memories and images stuck with him and he has to explore them in his every work? As long as he possess his magic power and is ready to experiment with the medium, to create the brilliant, uncompromising, and even sinister films with creepy gloomy yet darkly funny atmosphere, I will be happy.",1190160000,8,2850,4.753535353535353
2839633,1,B000QQFKYE,"After the masterpiece that was Mullholland Drive, comes Inland Empire, David Lynch's worst film. The first half hour is semi-coherent, as Laura Dern plays an actress living in a very wealthy mansion (and with a very jealous husband) set to star in some film. Her costar is Justin Theroux and the director Jeremy Irons. The feature seems to have been made in the past, but it was reportedly stopped after its main actors were murdered. This is the start, and as the half hour approaches, the films collapses into absurdity, full of unconnected surreal vignettes that test the patience of the audience. For instance, Dern's character suddenly becomes a street hooker (is the actress dreaming she was a hooker or is it the other way around? does anybody cares?). And don't ask about the meaning of the rabbits or polish angle of the film. As a twenty minute short, this material might be OK, but as a three hour feature this is simply unbearable. Even Lynch's previous bizarre feasts (Eraserhead, Blue Velvet, Twin Peaks, Lost Highway) look like a model of lineal clarity as compared to this. Heck, even Dune was a better film than this.",1190160000,15,1134,4.790816326530612
2839634,3,B000QQFKYE,"Without telling you much about the plot, let me address new viewers who are here on this page to understand more about this DVD and whether they should buy it or not:

1. If you're not a fan of ""Mulholland Drive"", don't bother. This movie is even more weird and long winded than that one, and doesn't have half the good musical score that one did.

2. This is a three hour long esoteric experiment. If that's not your sort of thing, don't get this.

3. Most of the movie won't make sense to you if you haven't seen anything by David Lynch. There is a thin plot, but nothing really ties in the way you might expect it to.

4. On the flipside, if you like `weird', `cult' movies, this would be right up your alley.

5. I personally did NOT like this 10% of how much I loved ""Mulholland Drive"" (my favorite English motion picture of all time). I found it meandering and pretentious in spots.

6. I find dissection and philosophizing upon this film by `cinephiles' extremely vulgar and snotty. They often look for too much meaning just for the sake of it. If this similarly turns you off, avoid this movie.

7. If you're looking for a weekend movie to relax to, this wouldn't be the best place to start.

8. Laura Dern is fabulous here, even though she looks out of her element in places. She excels in most her scenes.

9. If you're a fan of Justin Theroux, get this. This actor has been getting better and better, and outdoes himself in this movie.

10. If you like dark, brooding cinema with an old school noir attached, this just might be the movie for you.

I'll be the first to say it, but I found this to be the very weak and delusional half-sister of ""Mulholland Drive"", which I consider David Lynch's masterpiece. This movie embarrassed me and tested my patience with its over the top pretentiousness. Its as if the director was so carried away by his penchant for `hidden clues' etc, that he was throwing uselessly un-subtle twists and turns every now and then just to get the avant-garde and film-critic crowd to go `Ooh!'. In fact, much of this film is geared toward fulfilling this demographics' seven course dinner party conversations. I have no patience for this, and I think it disrespects great film-making (something Lynch used to once know how to do). Just my opinion.

Bottom Line - Stick with ""Mulholland Drive"". Though watching ""Inland Empire"" only makes you respect that movie even more. Especially useless here was the pointless `dance' number in the end where the most personality-free group get together to belt out an inane song - all of these shenanigans worked fine on ""Mulholland Drive"" - here they just look tacky and out of place.

Five Stars for Justin Theroux though. The man is a genius.",1190073600,6,2718,4.533742331288344

As confusing and bizarre as Lost Highway and Mulholland Drive were, at least those films were interesting, in a bizarre and creepy way. This film, Inland Empire, was creepy, but not all that interesting. Can something be creepy and boring at the same time? Mr. Lynch has done it. (and Blue Velvet is one of my all-time favorite films).  Maybe I'll need to see it again, maybe in a year, but I can see why no theater screened this one (not even the so-called art cinemas). 2 stars because I still respect David Lynch as an artist.

Admittedly, it is also very abstract and its logic is twisted to the point of contradiction at times.  Seeing it in the theater, I saw an amusingly high percentage of the audience get up and leave in apparent disgust over the course of the three-hour running time.

Beware the nay-sayers (and the fanboys, too), and judge this one for yourself.  Even if you don't dig the overall presentation, the scene-by-scene writing is fantastic and entertaining, and Laura Dern's performance is worth three hours of your time on its own.",1189728000,4,886,5.034246575342466

When I saw Inland Empire in a theater, I was ready to leave after an hour and a half but toughed it out to completion because I knew I would never make it that far again.

Nothing interesting happens, there are very few if any of those great Lynchian moments to savor as in his other films, and the actors seem to be pretty much as baffled as we are as to their motivations and actions.

Lynch's objective is not to have an audience who can tell what his films are ""about,"" or to ""understand"" what's going on, but rather to give viewers strangenesses to live through and to be inspired by.

Laura Dern is magnificently mysterious. Her character is as hypnotizing as the moods evoked by the experience of ""Inland Empire"".

Every character is beautiful and every frame is a work of art.

Lynch's use of sound, light, color and music are, as they always have been for me in his work, essential elements of modern expressionism.

INLAND EMPIRE is Lynch's most ambitious and densely packed film to date, makes EH look like a Bugs Bunny cartoon in comparison. Yet that is the fun of Lynch's films. To be able to go back again and again and try to decipher the meaning of the film. And yes, there is meaning to this film. It just may take me a couple of years to figure it out for myself. But I, for one, am tired of being spoon-fed movies that are churned out just to make a quick buck. I think most people go to the theatre, shell out their money, and are content to be entertained for two hours. Lynch gives you so much more with his imagery and sound design. This film stays with you. If you want to see an easily comprehensible film and would rather not use your brain while watching it, then INLAND EMPIRE is not for you.

I loved this movie and haven't finished decoding its messages.  Although there are multiple stories going on (the polish folk tale, the unfinished movie, Nikki's role and Nikki's real life) they all converge at the bottom of the hole only to to be reborn back in the real world at the end of the movie.  For those who haven't seen the bonus disk, check out the deleted scenes.

2839646,5,B000QQFKYE,"The first time I watched INLAND EMPIRE, there would be times during the nearly 3-hour running time that I would have to get up to go pee or grab a beer or something. So I would stop the film ... and find myself unwilling to move. Instead I would gaze up at the mysterious TV lamp casting its glow on the wall, the ominous folding doors concealing the den next to the living room ... and suddenly my comfortable home environment felt vaguely threatening.

Last night I began watching INLAND EMPIRE again, getting about halfway through the film before it was time to go to bed. Having plunged through it once already, I found myself free to simply watch rather than analyze, to simply listen to the exquisitely written dialogue rather than trying to puzzle out every nuance. And I found the film moving along a lot more quickly than the first time around.

And make no mistake: INLAND EMPIRE is a lot to digest. I'm still working on it. But after two days and some additional viewing, I find myself appreciating the film much, MUCH more. The first time I watched it, I thought to myself, ""There is a story here, but it is told in extremely unconventional terms."" And now I think there are several stories here that exist in a kind of orbital resonance and sharing themes of loss, guilt, and regret.

Oddly enough, spinning like a neutron star (or perhaps an old acetate record) at the core of this film is a Polish gypsy folk tale cum movie script so cursed that it has the ability to suck its actors and characters into other realities and identities, shuffling them around mercilessly, and in the process causing us, as members of the audience, to question our own grip on what is real and what is fiction.

There is the story of Nikki Grace, a veteran Hollywood actress with a chance to reclaim the limelight with the role of a lifetime. She ultimately falls victim to the aforementioned curse, losing both her identify and her marital fidelity. But how real is Nikki herself? She might in fact be nothing more than a DREAM of stardom, a fantasy concocted by a doomed Hollywood prostitute. In this regard INLAND EMPIRE shares some of the themes previously explored in David Lynch's previous film, ""Mulholland Drive.""

(Bill Macy, in a VERY brief appearance as a television announcer, utters what could possibly be the most telling line in the film, saying that Hollywood is ""where DREAMS become STARS, and STARS become DREAMS!"")

There are other stories at work here: The prostitution ring in Hollywood may parallel a similar racket in Poland. We are teased with scenes from a Polish film that ultimately went uncompleted, the same film being remade with Nikki Grace (played brilliantly by Laura Dern) and Devon Burke (Justin Theroux). There are cryptic references throughout the film to something called ""axonn.n"" ... which, according to the first spoken words in INLAND EMPIRE, is the longest radio play in history. And then there are the rabbits (Trapped? Caged?) used as the films most surreal device.

But to hell with all that. Ultimately what's really most important about INLAND EMPIRE is the art of filmmaking. Cinema is most often used to tell stories in the simplest, most conventional terms, just as oil paint on canvas is most often used to portray people, landscapes, and bowls of fruit. But both painting and cinema can be used in far more adventurous and experimental ways, even if such efforts are not commercially viable. I doubt that Salvador Dali and Luis Bunuel made ""Un Chien Andalou"" in hopes that it would be a big box office smash; they were more interested in expanding the artistic potential of film, and if they challenged and confounded the viewer in the process, so much the better. And throughout the history of filmmaking there have been a great many other directors that have pushed the envelope of the medium in their own ways, whether through storytelling or visual imagery.

With INLAND EMPIRE, I think David Lynch has gone back to his roots, forsaking the interference of big studio executives and marketing his film on his terms. As everyone knows by know, he is notoriously reticent to discuss the film's ""meaning."" But if all he really wanted to do was blur the distinction between fantasy and reality, and in the process make his viewers become just a little unhinged ... well, I think he succeeded in spades. Few films that I can think of have crept into my mind so tenaciously. And when some reviewers dismiss INLAND EMPIRE as pretentious nonsense, all I can think of is the old curmudgeon who looks at a Jackson Pollock painting and sneers, ""My four-year-old granddaughter could do better than that!""",1189036800,6,4645,4.761490683229813

I really wasn't sure how I was supposed to decipher what I was viewing, was this actually the curse being played out?  Was it some kind of metaphoric dream interlaced with random scenes of the past, present, and future?  Lol after watching it there's plenty of discussions online if you want to try and screw your head on straight afterwards.  I enjoyed the movie, but don't wish to spend another 3 hours with it in order to watch with an experienced perspective.

Five minutes into this film life-sized rabbits appear in a living room dressed in suits and ties. Prostitutes dance the 60's Locomotion. This film also lasts three hours, and has no linear plot. Time morphs back and forth between past, present and future. Place moves between Poland and Hollywood. Lynch is either coy or just brutally honest when the only description he will give of INLAND EMPIRE (he insists that the title be capitalized) is that it's about ""a woman in trouble."" Other than that, many viewers compare the film to human dreaming or the interior landscape of human consciousness -- disjointed, disassociative, vivid, scary, and sometimes an unrelated stream of consciousness. Laura Dern's performance alone makes the film worth watching; she plays three roles. As a movie about a film and the actress who stars in it, there's the sense that reality is a social construction that depends upon the viewer, and not something objective with a fixed meaning. Lynch shot the film with an off-the-rack Sony digital camera, and as with his other films the soundtrack is alternately ominous, eery, and quirky.

2839649,2,B000QQFKYE,I am a big David Lynch fan but this film is nonsence. Yep sure David is once again delving into the subconcious and dream states but he has done it before and better. At least in films like Mulholland Drive you can follow the film to some degree and try and peel back the mystery. Inland Empire is purely a nonsensical opportunity for David Lynch to throw as many of his weirdo ideals and artistry into the one film and not care about any structure or form. At three hours in length and moving at the pace of a sloth this film is truly an endurance test which is quite frankly not worth the effort. Save your crazy stuff for your art shows Dave and get back to making films like Blue Velvet and Wild at Heart which prove how much better a discernable plotline can be.,1188777600,2,767,4.224489795918367

However, like all of Lynch's movies you have to take a leap of faith, surrender yourself to the film and just enjoy the imagery and the atmosphere and the randomness of everything.  Once you finish it, the film will leave a seed inside your mind, that will begin to grow and grow as you try to unravel the mystery of what you watched.  Repeated viewings will either confirm what is sprouting in your mind or will lead to new seeds planted.  Aside from all that, the film looks great - the HD is beautiful and no one films LA at night better than Lynch.  The cast is great, particularly Laura Dern.

2839652,5,B000QQFKYE,"David Lynch's latest film comprises several different but related ""realities."" Those who say it's just a jumble of random scenes aren't paying attention. The numerous visual rhymes (for instance: a man with a huge ketchup stain on his belly in one scene, a woman dripping blood from her screwdriver-impaled stomach in another) and lines repeated by different characters in different contexts, like verbal leitmotifs, make up a complex web of interrelated, fractured narratives. Some say it's like a cubist painting, but it's more like a hypercube. Inland Empire is a mutlidimensional, trans-temporal maze, bewildering but endlessly intriguing.

As usual with Lynch, dream logic dominates. But if Eraserhead is like one prolonged nightmare, Inland Empire is like an entire night of interconnected dreams condensed into three hours. There's nothing here that's as thrilling and strangely moving as the Club Silencio scene in Mulholland Drive, but overall I think I like Inland Empire a bit better. It's much more complex and even more amenable to multiple viewings, although I doubt the film will ever quite reveal itself as a surprisingly understandable story the way Mulholland Drive does. Inland Empire is audacious, crazy and daring. Unfortunately, a lot of people, including a lot of Lynch fans, resent the film for it. But to me it adds up to a remarkable, truly innovative achievment.

The extras are excellent, especially the half hour of behind-the-scenes clips, and the 75-minute ""Other Things that Happened,"" a collection of deleted scenes edited together to form a separate movie that functions as an addendum to the main feature.",1188518400,6,1640,5.328185328185328

2839657,3,B000QQFKYE,"Remember that scene in 'Amadeus' when Salieri (F. Murray Abraham) criticizes Mozart's (Thomas Hulce) music, saying it had ""too many notes""?  Well, 'INLAND EMPIRE' may have just two tones (dark and cryptic), but it has too much of everything else.  Too many characters, too many plots within plots, and too many seemingly arbitrary scenes that last anywhere from 10 seconds to 10 minutes.
  Like 'Mulholland Dr.,' 'INLAND EMPIRE's' immediate predecessor in both time and spirit, a certain method pokes through the madness from time to time. But unlike that previous masterpiece, there's simply TOO MUCH madness for the viewer to slog through in order to get to the heart of the mystery.  Not that Lynch's mysteries have ever had ""hearts"" in this sense, but they've always had a discernable thread running through them that only the most careful viewer can pick out.  And even though the nature of that thread varies depending on who you ask, it's always been there, even in his (previously) most difficult full-length film, 'Eraserhead.'
  In 'INLAND EMPIRE,' the thread is only faintly present, but halfway through this 3 and a half hour film it's buried beneath all the 'notes,' and it doesn't seem eager to be discovered.
  Now that I seem to have fully trashed it, I feel that I must say that it's not a BAD movie, nor is it necessarily subpar even by Lynch's historically high standards.  If anything, it demands more repeat viewings than any other film he's done before; in addition, it boasts what just might be Laura Dern's best performance ever, which is saying something.  But, like all of Lynch's work, there will always be loose ends that just don't fit, and I have a feeling that this will go down as the most notorious example of this phenomenon in Lynch's catalogue.",1188259200,,1780,4.857615894039735
2839658,5,B000QQFKYE,"First off I have to disagree that this film isn't meant to be understood, that its just meant to wash over you. Granted just watching it cluelessly, as almost everyone does the first time, creates a certain mood. But if you're a human being with curiosity, one simply cannot just passively let it wash over you. You want to know at least how to read the signposts in the film. One cannot expect to understand all the minutae.
 Even on first viewing you can pick up on some of the larger themes. The film is about the American experience, its a 'remake' of a European film. Obviously the theme here is fairly unmistakeable. This parallel is drawn upon many times in the film.
 Also one of the main themes is how Hollywood is no longer this ridiculous grinning entertainment machine like it was in the early days of Hollywood. It is now feeding the neurosis of the people consuming its drivel. The frustration in Lynch's work is evident towards the industry. He is almost screaming 'you have all this power to effect positive change in peoples life, yet look at what you're doing to your audience.'
 The movie is well done, its not for the pedestrian. Its for someone willing to stop and look at the signs.
 Even though I was frustrated at some points during the first viewing. I can feel it already this film has its hooks in me like every other Lynch film I've seen. The hook is what motivates understanding, I may not get it all but over time it will open up to me like a flower.",1188259200,5,1480,4.430147058823529
2839659,4,B000QQFKYE,"Don't think about the plot much. There is one, but that is not the only thing that matters as in most of his films in the past. ""Inland Empire"" is all about David Lynch and his ""ideas"" - about his visuals, or visions, and the unnerving sound effects, surprising use of music (including Little Eva's ""Locomotion"" with prostitutes dancing to it), a sitcom of the cool rabbit men and their bizarre dialogues. And it goes on three hours. It could be mess for some viewers, or a big sketch book drawn by a genius for others. To me, it happens to be the latter (though I would still find the film brilliant if some parts are left in the cutting room).

In ""Inland Empire"" you meet Laura Dern as Hollywood star Nikki Grace, who got a role in the new film co-starred with a handsome lead (Justin Theroux), and directed by gentleman-like director (Jeremy Irons). The fact is, the film is a remake of some unfinished Polish film, which, some people say, is cursed. Strange things start to happen around her, which defies the film's narrative conventions. Compared with ""Inland Empire,"" ""Mulholland Dr."" looks like a straight story.

Confusing as it is, however, ""Inland Empire"" has one thread of story, which is about the nightmare journey that Laura Dern`s character must go through. Fiction (or another world?) and reality start to merge, making Nikki lose the sense of where she is, and who she is. The same goes to the viewers, who follow the episodes apparently connected to one another, that sometimes seem repetitious, sometimes unexpectedly funny (I love those rabbit people), sometimes utterly ridiculous, but ultimately strange and mysterious.

David Lynch's talent is often associated with his unique visual styles, but he is also a great ""actor's director"" who often has had the actors' strongest performances, like John Hurt, Richard Farnsworth, and recently, Naomi Watts in his films. Here Laura Dern gives us one of her best performances in her career as confused Nikki, whose transformation is so painful and credible. You cannot miss smaller roles. Before Nikki, Grace Zabriskie appears as mysterious Polish lady, quietly warning of the consequences of her taking the job. This is vintage Lynch, very weird and never boring.

I know the film is deeply flawed and three hours are too long and demanding. Some part of the film is weaker, being a bit too repetitious. ""Inland Empire"" is shot with Sony's digital camera and has its original beauty, but I still wish someday Lynch goes back to the old media of celluloid. Still this is undeniably a David Lynch film with his extraordinary images and ideas that no one else can create.",1188259200,2,2636,4.864142538975501
2839661,5,B000QQFKYE,"Lynch's latest exploration of the dreams and nightmares of Hollywood focuses on the actress, Nicky Grace, (superbly played by Laura Dern) who has just got a role in the remake of an Eastern European film based on a Polish folk tale. At a read through of the script the director reveals that the original production was believed to be cursed and that the lead was murdered during production.

Nicky Grace becomes increasingly distressed by the ill omens that surround the production; then, in a disorientating moment of cinema, she says to her co-star, ""Something's happened"" and the film collapses in on itself leaving her to inhabit different times, films and characters  as she stumbles through INLAND EMPIRE trying to make sense of her reality. Films and reality merge and entwine; and just as a coherent thread arrives it collapses back in on itself  as if the viewer is watching a pattern on a kaleidoscope - unable to capture the ever changing narrative.

INLAND EMPIRE feels like a summation of many of Lynch's themes and echoes of his previous works can be found scattered throughout Nicky Grace's nightmarish journey.  This is a film about films within a film - a fractured nightmare where the protagonist wakes to find herself in another celluloid nightmare.  It delights, teases and frustrates and could not be described as an easy 3 hours viewing.  It is, however, a stunning, claustrophobic and brilliant film that is unlikely to win Lynch any new converts but will surely satisfy his many fans",1188172800,3,1507,4.932806324110672
2839662,4,B000QQFKYE,"With his 179 minute INLAND EMPIRE, writer/director/sound designer/camera operator David Lynch has created an intricate Polish melodrama, Hollywood mystery, and meditation on movies.  A Hollywood crew, led by actors Laura  Dern and Justin Theroux and director Jeremy Irons, is remaking a Polish film that was abandoned because the leading actor and actress were murdered.  Or were they?  Was the film even made?  And will Dern and Theroux meet a similar fate if it was made?  INLAND EMPIRE is a challenging and fascinating film, vast and immensely enjoyable if you give it undivided attention.  That is asking a lot, but it is worth the effort.  As with all Lynch films, the sound design is awesome and the use of color (Lynch studied painting) is flawless.

 So we have a Polish film and a Hollywood film playing out for three hours on parallel narrative tracks.  It doesn't all make sense.  I still don't understand the sitcom with characters wearing donkey head masks.  I think that is just something that Dern watches.  Or maybe it is part of the Hollywood movie, along with the superb monologues Dern has with her psychiatrist.  (One of the best is regrettably on the cutting room floor, but part of the bonus material on disk two.)  Maybe Dern and Theroux metamorphose into their Polish counterparts or their Hollywood film characters.  It all ends with a wrap party, if that helps you.

Disk two runs a full three-and-a-half hours and includes a real-time cooking lesson (!), something called ""Ballerina"", three theatrical trailers, a stills gallery, about 90 minutes of sometimes excellent cutting room floor footage, a filmmaking documentary, and a lengthy monologue by Lynch with his favorite movie stories.  INLAND EMPIRE doesn't all make sense to me, but it is one of the few difficult movies to warrant a second viewing.  Every new movie playing in theaters now seems like dog food compared to this David Lynch steak.  Or quinoa.",1188172800,3,1941,4.984423676012461

Surreal, dream-like, abstract, absurd, think for yourself--I GOT IT ALREADY! It still doesn't change the fact that Lynch never intended for this to be a feature film. Instead, it was supposed to be a string of unrelated pre-written scenes. People say this is a great film because you can make any connection you wish between the unrelated scenes. Greaaaaaaaaat. Whoopee. The bottom line is they were originally unrelated scenes. ""Inland Empire"" along with ""Eraserhead"" are bottom of the barrel Lynch. Excruciatingly boring, but atmospheric and well filmed. That's what ""Inland Empire"" has in its favor--cinematography, lighting, atmosphere. Three hours is self-indulgent for no story. I can watch grass grow too, but I'd rather see something of more substance. I liked ""Mulholland Drive"", and it wasn't exactly linear, but it was more coherent than ""Inland Empire"". Now I can see the Lynch devotee loving this film or arrogant, narcissistic (artistic), egocentric individuals also loving this film, but I watch with a critical eye. Just because you're David Lynch doesn't mean you're God. Lynch made ""Lost Highway"" a less-than-stellar film, thus he's merely human and prone to human indulgence like finding a digital camera and going hog wild with it, disregarding storyline and storytelling. Let's hope the failure of ""Inland Empire"" will result in a better Lynch film next time.",1188086400,6,1485,5.2175732217573225

2839665,1,B000QQFKYE,"This movie Inland Empire is a horrible embarassment to the great legacy of David Lynch.  This movie is at the same amature level as Eraser Head.  Eraser Head was an avantgarde near silent film from the late 70s which we accepted as shocking art rather than an entertaining film which it was not.

Inland Empire is hardly art or artistic.  This movie has no vision. It is cold, bitter, monotone, and without any plot.  The actual filming is crystaline and well done and sure, there are a few scenes that look interesting and artistic similar to that of Lynch's other movies.  But we've already seen this before in other films.

Inland Empire can best be compared to that of The Lost Highway but much much worse and not really worth the rent unless you plan to be bored and annoyed out of your head.

Another problem is that David Lynch casted old has beens in this film.  Laura Dern may be a good actress but she is much older now and long durated close ups of her face is not interesting and thought provoking at all, it is tedius and unappealing. This movie created a feeling in me of apathy and dislike towards each character.

There is no plot. This is not a twisted bizarre movie like Twin Peaks or even Mulholland Drive.

This is NOT recommended.  Watch Dune instead that movie looks great compared to this.",1188086400,9,1312,4.489451476793249
2839666,5,B000QQFKYE,"David Lynch is truly one of the few directors working today who approaches the very core of what cinema is and what makes it interesting.. He knows the ingredients and the elements and how to use them together to make a painting.. Like most paintings Lynch's movies require some work and investigation from the audience.. They contain structure and yet there is a spontaneous touch that brings life and possibilities to his work..

The photographic techniques in this film are interesting as Lynch is working with a new medium.. it is like no home video you have ever seen.. This movie truly presents new possibilities to anyone who is interested in making movies...

2839667,5,B000QQFKYE,"[***SPOILER WARNING***]

This film is not only brilliant, and probably Lynch's best, but it is completely comprehensible. One key bit of insight brings meaning to the entire film. I'm not going to dissect this film in detail, but I'll give you enough of a clue to get you started.

Nikki's neighbor (the old woman who lives ""just down the way"", played by Grace Zabriskie) is the real main character in this story. Nikki, and most of the other characters in this film, are manifestations of the old woman's multiple personality disorder. The old woman worked as a prostitute in Poland when she was young (and married). She became pregnant by another man (her husband could not father children), but lost the baby. These and other traumas in her life shattered her psyche.

The film is mostly about the woman's struggle to re-integrate her multiple personalities with the help of her therapist, which she accomplishes in the end. I'll let you work out the rest of the story for yourself. It's well worth the effort!",1188000000,9,1013,4.810344827586207
2839668,5,B000QQFKYE,"We are about to delve into the mind of someone who is in a life or death struggle and must make some very important spot decisions if she is to survive. Perhaps she has been drugged beforehand; perhaps she must do something unspeakable and degrading to protect someone very important to her; but she is in great danger. She must muster all of her strength. Part of her is terrified. How does she do it? How does she survive?

Lynch likes to ask this question: ""How does he/she do it?"" He is fascinated by the states of mind that allow individuals to behave in certain extraordinary ways in unusual situations. He wants to understand. He is very empathetic. In earlier pics, he has tried on the criminal mind: ""How can a man brutally disembowel his wife and still look at himself in the mirror?"" (Lost Highway); or ""How does a woman who has taken a hit out on her lover cope with the guilt?"" (Mulholland Drive). He gets right into the heads of these characters, to see, to show us. Now Lynch considers the victim's perspective. How does she do it? How does she survive?

The trauma is very disassociative for our heroine, like an out-of-body experience. She is frightened enough that whatever happens, whatever she does, it is almost as though she is watching someone else have these experiences. She is just with it enough to focus on certain details that might help her should she survive - what does he look like...what is he wearing...green...a green coat...the hotel room...must remember that number...where does he keep the gun...

How does she do it? Part of her just walls itself off. It is almost infantile, this part, but she will keep all of her goodness and hope and love in this place -in her ""Lost Girl"" -  safe from that SOB.

Part of her feels guilty and dirty. This part tells her that she is ""bad"" and that perhaps she deserves whatever her tormentor has planned for her. Perhaps something happened to her long ago, something she has never confronted directly, something that was not her fault but that she blames herself for nonetheless.  This is her ""Sue"", who is also a movie character played by the actress ""Nicki"".

But our heroine is strong. She will overcome these feelings of guilt and shame. There is an actress she adores and admires and who always seems to pull through at the end. What would she do? What did she do in her different films, in these various roles? What has she done to hold together in her personal life as an aging starlet? What would she do in this situation?  What would Nicki do?

So scary for our heroine. Maybe it'll all end just like that grisly story, the one that scared her so much as a girl.....but she can imagine herself as her idol and maybe just get through it. And so, to cope, she casts herself as her idol Nicki.

Lynch digs right down into this character's head. Her mind races yet time seems as though it is molasses. Themes, plans, stories, fears, dreams, desires flood into and through her psyche, and Lynch imgaines them for us exactly as he senses she would, in the same seemingly incoherant order and with the same distorted sense of time and place. That he is able to do so with such astonishing empathy and in ways that touch on so many other themes - well, welcome to the world of David Lynch.",1187913600,9,3266,4.520338983050848

2839670,4,B000QQFKYE,"In an 1817 letter, John Keats coined the term negative capability, referring to ""when man is capable of being in uncertainties, Mysteries, doubts without any irritable reaching after fact & reason."" David Lynch's films have always espoused this idea--part of what makes his work distinctive is that it always leaves something to the imagination of the audience--but not since 1977's Eraserhead has one of his films embodied it so fully. At the end of its epic three hour running time, INLAND EMPIRE will either leave one in complete awe or utterly confused, depending on the viewer's particular temperament.

The first hour of the film centers around an actress named Nikki Grace (Laura Dern), who's just landed a role opposite hearthrob Devon Berk (Justin Theroux) in what director Kingsly (Jeremy Irons) assures them will be a star-maker. Things begin to go awry when Kingsly's assistant Freddy (Harry Dean Stanton) discovers that their film is a remake of a Polish production that was never finished--its leads were brutally murdered as part of a curse on the story's origins in gypsy folklore. As filming progresses, lines blur further and further between Nikki herself and Sue, the unfaithful woman she plays, until all hold on reality is lost and Nikki (along with the audience) is plunged into a nightmarish multiple reality. Throw in some anthropomorphic rabbits, a gaggle of prostitutes, a group of circus performers, and a man with mysterious hypnotic powers, and one starts to get an idea of how far this is from conventional cinema.

In many ways, IE seems a kind of evil twin to its predecessor, 2001's Mulholland Drive; both films center on troubled actresses, shifting identities and the fractured nature of the Hollywood dream machine. However, the approach between the two is starkly different. MD's dreamlike world is a function of its puzzle-box mystery plotline, intricately designed to unlock itself once the viewer uncovers the correct keys. IE, on the other hand, stands as more of a web of vignettes interconnected by characters and themes and operating on a more instinctual rather than intellectual level to reveal itself. This contrast is largely a function of the way the two films present themselves; MD explored the lush, stylized flavor of noir filmmaking, where IE, with its handheld camera movements, lower-quality digital video and jumpy sound design (this movie plays the quiet-loud game very effectively) delves into the grittier, more visceral aspects of the genre.

Lynch's flights of style are balanced out by Laura Dern's performance, which helps anchor the vague dreaminess of the film. She embodies at least three different characters, or different identities of the same character perhaps, with masterful ability, flowing from naive to horrified to vicious (among many other modes) with an unrivaled smoothness. Even if one can't get past the director's oddities, it's not hard to understand why he campaigned (with a cow, no less) for an Oscar nomination for his lead actress. Although none of the other actors have the range or screen time she's afforded here, the rest of the cast tackles their roles with aplomb also, eg: Irons's slightly smug undertone beneath his character's enthusiastic affability, or the low-key brattiness Theroux invests into his character(s) perfectly.

Of course, that all still leaves open the question of whether or not INLAND EMPIRE is a good movie. Reviews and reactions have been clearly divisive--this is a ""love it or hate it"" movie if there ever was one--however, I would have to answer yes. I'm comfortable saying that for two main reasons. First, because of the arresting imagery; the transposed face on the mysterious phantom, or the jealous ""Smithy's"" burning blue eyes in the dark (just two of many examples) are some of the most disturbing and vivid moments in 21st century cinema. Second, because IE walks a fine line by requiring something from the audience while still giving back a certain amount of credit. There's enough within the film that it does hold together in an abstract way, rather than being a pointless exercise in avant-garde elitism, yet it's also a challenging, often frustrating endeavor, with gaps left to be filled in by the viewer's reactions, emotions and questions.

If one is comfortable with that negative space, IE comes highly recommended. If not, there's never a dearth of more mainstream, approachable films out there.",1187913600,9,4437,5.165507649513213

2839672,5,B000QQFKYE,"If ""Inland Empire"" is not David Lynch's best work, it is certainly his most fascinating.  More than any of his other films, ""Inland Empire"" is the culmination of everything Lynch has done, tried to do, said, and tried to say, throughout his entire career.  It is vastly different from any of his other works, but is the very definition of ""Lynchian.""  No film has ever explained what Lynch is all about so perfectly as this.  It is his greatest experiment into surreality, his most complicated work, and perhaps also his most rewarding.  It requires repeated viewings, and many of them, but not to understand.  Simply to experience, like looking at the world's most bafflingly intricate impressionist painting.  ""Inland Empire"" is undeniable proof that, more than a filmmaker, David Lynch is an artist.

Trying to explain ""Inland Empire"" is like trying to explain existence.  As Lynch's deepest foray into the surreal, there is no clear plot of any sort.  One of the strongest points that Lynch has emphasized with his films is that the cinema was invented as an art form, not simply as a storytelling device.  There is a story, perhaps numerous stories, hidden within ""Inland Empire,"" and many ideas as well, but anyone searching for a linear plotline will be left thoroughly flummoxed.  Story lines include an actor and actress who are pushed into an affair by various forces, and who are also working upon a remake of a ""cursed"" film; a Polish town where women are being abused; a woman who sits by her television set, crying, as she watches a sitcom about a family of rabbits, where the laugh track pops up at the most absurd moments; and two apparent mobsters scheming something.  The film is structured like most of Lynch's films: the first part is the mystery, the second part the dream, and the third part, the revelations and the descent into the nightmare.

When questioned as to what the film was about, David Lynch said that ""it's about a woman in trouble, and it's a mystery, and that's all I want to say about it.""  Furthermore, Lynch offers a clue to the film in the form of a quote from the translation of the Aitareya Upanishad: ""We are like the spider.  We weave our life and then move along in it.  We are like the dreamer who dreams and then lives in the dream.  This is true for the entire universe.""

What that means, I'm not sure.  Lynch says he understands the film perfectly, and no doubt he does, but I feel that the key to accepting the movie is in something Lynch always says about each one of his films: he will never explain the film, because what matters is what each film means to you, the viewer.  As much as I can decipher from ""Inland Empire"" is that it's about two men whose lives parallel each other, and that they have both cheated on their lovers and must now face the consequences.  ""There are consequences to one's actions,"" characters repeat.  That is simply my interpretation of it, however, and it still leaves unaccounted many of the images which make up the film.  The film has much in common with Lynch's last masterwork, 2001's ""Mulholland Dr.,"" and perhaps, like Naomi Watts' character in that film, ""Inland Empire"" involves the two unfaithful women's retreat into their fantasies and nightmares, brought on by their guilt.

The meaning is not nearly as important as the filmmaking, which ranks Lynch among the likes of Alfred Hitchcock.  ""Inland Empire"" is nothing if not the work of a brilliant visionary.  Lynch is a man to be idolized by any filmmaker with a dream: for ""Inland Empire,"" Lynch didn't even bother to search for a distributor.  He funded much of the project out of his own pocket.  He decided to experiment by filming it with everyday digital video cameras rather than the traditional film equipment, adding frightening realism to the picture, as well as a major artistic twist.  Filmed on the standard film stock, ""Inland Empire"" would be more instantly recognizable as a work of brilliance, but the amateurish look of the digital video footage makes this as unique an experiment as any attempted in recent cinematic history.  Lynch is an artist, with a dream, a vision, and he pursues that vision without regard to what the other filmmakers are doing or have done before him.

He is an extraodinarily talented individual.  The entire cast of the film has said that they have no clue just what is going on in the picture; but Lynch's direction wrings out such compelling, convincing performances in a film that would seemingly leave anyone clueless.  Laura Dern is just stupendous.  This is easily and undoubtedly the best performance of her career by far.  Supporting her with similarly excellent and mysterious performances are Justin Theroux, Jeremy Irons, Harry Dean Stanton, Peter J. Lucas, and Julia Ormond, with brief appearances by Diane Ladd, Ian Abercrombie, William H. Macy, Grace Zabriskie, Laura Harring, and Naomi Watts, who voices the speaking member of the Rabbit family.

As with most of Lynch's films, though, the power lies within the visuals, and ""Inland Empire"" has some of the most spectacular visuals in any Lynch production.  Lynch manages to make the film look lush and sparse at the same time.  It contains all the trademark Lynchian images: the red curtains; the long, tall, lamp which casts an eerie and stale orange glow around small, barely-decorated rooms; the dark, ghastly corridors - it's all here, and more important than ever.  Lynch is deeply involved with everything, from the construction of sets to the ever-so-prominent sound design.  With ominously-staged visuals, frighteningly enigmatic dialogue and scenes, and the most downright terrifying sound in any Lynch production, ""Inland Empire"" is easily his scariest film.  He sets the audience up, building the suspense ounce-by-ounce with such masterful style that he comes to rival Hitchcock.  The most delightfully absurd and spontaneous moment in ""Inland Empire"": as usual, Lynch sets us up for pure terror, the dialogue becoming more twisted, the visuals darker, more claustrophobic, the inhuman sounds growing louder and louder, but just as we brace ourselves, the characters align themselves and begin some well-choreographed dancing to ""The Locomotion.""

What is the appeal of David Lynch's work?  Is he truly a genius, or as some have said, just a trashy director with a lot of pretention?  In my mind, Lynch is an unquestionable genius, and he ranks among the most original, visionary, and brilliant filmmakers who ever lived.  There is something about the absurdity, the confusion, the unorthodox approach taken in Lynch's work that really touches something inside of us, something which we can no understand and which frightens us.  After watching ""Inland Empire"" for the first time, and trying to organize my thoughts, the most peculiar knowledge came to me: I understood what the film was about.  I could understand the entire thing.  However, I couldn't grasp my understanding, put it in terms simple enough for me to explain to another person.  But I understood.  There is something in Lynch's films far more intellectual and meaningful than anything else in cinematic history, thinly concealed within dozens of thick layers which only repeated viewings can reveal.  I feel as though Lynch has a greater idea of what life is all about than any of us, and he explains it through his films.  There is much more to be said and which I could say about this film - but for the first time, I understand.  As Lynch says, his films speak for themselves.  And ""Inland Empire"" speaks loudest of all.",1187740800,9,7563,4.90251572327044

In the DVD extra, Lynch comments that Kubrick picked very good music.  This is true.  The soundtrack to the Shining is just brilliant.  Penderecki, of course, was a key component to that.  So Lynch got Penderecki for Inland Empire, and it is...overwhelmingly good.  You really do cheat yourself if you don't hear this movie, so much as see it.  The Penderecki pieces create a really intense environment.  As much as I always liked Angelo Badalamenti, etc...

I plowed through about half the film, but could not stay awake.  I had
totally bizarre dreams.  When i woke up, i plowed through the rest.

When it was over...I did not think that much of it.  I guess the
interesting thing is that the film continues to sort of linger with me.  If
you bring up Inland Empire now, my mind flashes through a very
complicated, weird, surreal universe.  It has a funny effect.

In the end, you just have to watch and appreciate it yourself (or not).
It is a film that has a powerful effect like ""A"" the first time; then you
realize it is worth seeing perhaps again.  I cannot speak for the effect ""B"" or ""C"" that one may experience after multiple viewings.  I do know that I will likely watch it several times.  I look forward to that.",1187740800,6,2998,4.578154425612053
2839674,5,B000QQFKYE,"Yes, well, I suppose everyone is entitled to an opinion, blah blah blah, (at least we can't legally prohibit them, yet) but not everyone can aspire to a valid and/or valuable opinion. Of course, I'm only kidding, but then again am I? When one person (i.e., me) becomes attached, quite emotionally, to a piece of art, namely David Lynch's INLAND EMPIRE, contrarian opinions are thereafter dismissed as irrelevant and just plain wrong. Such is the inherent fascism of human opinion, or at least of mine.

As you may have heard, this film is not -- what's the euphemism? -- ""plot-centered."" This inevitably leads some opinion-wielders to label it as self-indulgent and (the customary adjective for ""arty"" or ""challenging"" films) pretentious. (It's almost knee-jerk: I did not understand it; therefore it must be pretentious. It's always the film's ""fault"" and never the viewer's, in other words.) But on the other hand, NOT every film needs to be a right-brain experience. Maybe INLAND EMPIRE doesn't need to be understood in a literal sense (a Plot-Point-A to Plot-Point-B sense) but only intuited. Do we have to be enslaved by logocentrism? And, if so, don't we deserve a three-hour vacation once in a while?

And -- fault the film as you may -- I think Laura Dern's performance/s in this film is/are beyond reproach within the parameters of what was expected of her. She gives certainly a whole heck of a lot more than your average Academy Award nominated actress... Let's see what Halle Barry or Charlize Theron can do in a scene opposite Grace Zabriskie (Visitor #1) spouting ominous nonsense, or likewise how convincingly Dame Judi Dench can vomit blood. Obviously, Laura Dern's role is a meaty one, and she delivers, much like Naomi Watts in MULHOLLAND DRIVE, Sheryl Lee in FIRE WALK WITH ME, and, well... herself in WILD AT HEART.

If you're here, you've probably read all of the attempted synopses of this film, and they're pretty much correct. The film is essentially about some sort of identity crisis. (It reminds me in some ways both of Bergman's PERSONA and -- even more so -- of Kieslowski's THE DOUBLE LIFE OF VERONIQUE. So if you like those films, you may -- and I repeat may -- like this one, and vice versa.) Laura Dern plays an actress who gets a role in an allegedly cursed Hollywood production of what amounts to a Southern domestic melodrama with a ridiculous name (which escapes me now). Somehow reality and fiction intersect and kablooey: You're at the epicenter of a Lynchian nightmare. That's all you really need to know. If you need, want, or expect a more thoroughgoing, literal understanding of the plot, then please avoid this film. Otherwise, sit back and take it in. It is a film better felt than thought.",1187740800,6,2735,4.839743589743589
2839675,5,B000QQFKYE,"Lynch has done it again! Another warped film, that is utterly amazing. This is really difficult to actually review. There is just so much here, and the way it is done, just done so well. Much like Lost Highway and Mulholland Dr. this has the same kind of thing, characters, becoming different people. You know the drill. David Lynch has done this in such a way that you can decide for yourself what is going on, the clues are there. I don't think there is a right or wrong answer. I was amazed, this is a three hour film, not once did it drag, it actually felt like a 90min film and I wanted so much more. Laura Dern is this movie, she simply puts on a career best performance. I know this film will be hated, it is not for those who want things handed to them gift wrapped. This is a film that makes you think, like trying to solve a mystery. That is the beauty of Lynch's work, he makes you think, he forces you to use your head, to think, to find answers. Quite simply, I love you David Lynch!",1187654400,7,996,4.139175257731959
2839676,3,B000QQFKYE,"In the past, David Lynch has used dream states and shifting times and character identities to create abstract films with their own internal logic. He used these abstractions to shuffle the narrative (Mullholland Drive), create moods that are paced and organized to give the feeling of narrative (Eraserhead), or to create jarring transitions between moods in a strictly chronological narrative (Blue Velvet). This time there is no real narrative at all. Just disconnected scenes and characters floating in a dream-space. It's the film equivalent of a William S. Burroughs ""cut up"" book- interesting things happening in a pretty much random way. The artistry and tight direction of composition and acting is still there, but there's nothing for it to hang on. If you like David Lynch movies, you'll like this film, although at three hours plus another hour or so of outtakes, it overstays its welcome a bit. But if you don't know much about Lynch, or have found his films to be infuriating in the past, this one isn't going to convince you.",1187654400,2,1039,4.977011494252873

He is an studied painter and this movie show us all his dreamfully visions of terror and suspense like in all his pictures. Great work!
This Special Edition DVD comprised a brilliant and excellent picture + sound quality and many more features like trailers, stills and deleted scenes. Anybody whosoever likes David Lynch and his films need this movie, because  it's a masterpiece in film history. No one will forget the first time they saw the Inland Empire movie, from the best director in the world, David Lynch. :-) Buy!!!",1187654400,10,693,4.588709677419355
2839679,5,B000QQFKYE,"I'm amazed at how many people don't ""get"" this film- First I must say if this film were a painting, it would be the first impressionist painting ever painted- It's so new, so completely original that in my opinion it will be years before it's accepted as a truly ground breaking film.  One reviewer said that you could shuffle the scenes and still enjoy it, I agree, but one must take a step back and take it in as a whole, I know this is hard to do- it's nearly 3 hours. One observation I will make that I think is the key to this film- and I could be wrong, but I don't think so- Luara Derns character Nicki is NOT the women in trouble. The women in trouble watches a screen, and on the screen, she plays out her options, like one does in a dream- the mind works on problems, should she kill herself?, should she kill the women she becomes when she puts on a blond wig?, should she return to her family and live happily ever after? You will have to see the movie to find out-",1187568000,5,977,4.088541666666667
2839680,3,B000QQFKYE,"I'm a huge David Lynch fan but I really think he does much better making more mainstream movies and TV shows exploring the interplay between mainstream and experimental, dark and light, dream and reality.

Mulholland Drive and Blue Velvet work in this way for example, but not Inland Empire. With one hour left to go in the film, I simply turned it off. I just didn't care what happened next, unlike Mulholland Drive, which kept me on the edge of my seat, Blue Velvet and even Eraserhead did too. But Inland Empire is 3 hours long of honey-tongued gibberish and despite what Lynch says, I still think he should have shot it with an HD camera rather than just a DV one. The scenes are too hard to watch, especially on a big screen being that pixellized. If the video quality was gorgeous to look at, I think I may have been able to sit through the entire 3 hour movie since the sound is gorgeous. But like I said, after about 2 hours, my eyes became too fatigued, my minding didn't care about the characters and I just wanted it to be over so I could watch the extras DVD.

On the plus side the extras are highly engaging. I especially liked watching Lynch make his dinner. And hear him swear in the interview. That was really keen.",1187568000,4,1231,4.37117903930131
2839681,5,B000QQFKYE,"I managed to catch this film just before it finished its brief run at a local theater here in Chicago, and I'm so glad I made the trip.  I can't say that I know what the movie is about, and I have to be honest:  I don't care (though I enjoy reading the different perspectives among filmgoers who DO have their ideas on what it's really about).  If the purpose of a good film or piece of music is to provoke an emotional response out of the viewer/listener, then ""Inland Empire"" achieved this in spades, and this makes it a terrific film in my view.  I was fully riveted for all three hours and was not bored for one single minute.  And it's unlike any film I've ever seen before.

I'll concede right away it's not for everyone - but I truly believe it to be something special and really love it.  Laura Dern's performance is something else, and I can't think of another well-known American actress who would be bold enough to approach a role like this (though Julianne Moore comes to mind), much less put their trust in Lynch as Dern does here, and has done so before.

And though this is in digital video, I still found it to be filmed in a rich kind of way.  Not sumptuous like ""Mulholland Drive"" (probably my favorite Lynch film of all), but still with the same care I believe Lynch puts into any of his films.  The use of sound is great too.  Also, though I read in a local film review about one scene where ""you'll want to scream...you probably will"", I was still not prepared for the impact.  I actually thought I'd already seen the moment in question, but was I ever wrong!  When it did happen, I was frozen in my seat - a really frightening combination of sound and image that's hard to get out of your head.

I still think about this movie every day or so - it really stays with you.  Again, not for everybody, not by a longshot.  But so glad I saw it and look forward to viewing it again at home.",1187568000,11,1906,4.223756906077348

Just let the images and sounds wash over you, as you descend into an insane dreamscape of confusion, terror, and wonder. Release your usual notions of forced, pat storytelling and allow this movie to enter your subconscious mind.

You will be rewarded with a surrealistic adventure which defies explanation and analysis. You will be immersed into a world far beyond everyday experience. You will emerge unable to forget Inland Empire, for better or for worse.

2839683,5,B000QQFKYE,"Heartbreakingly beautiful images, uncanny scenes that are absolutely idiosyncratic yet uncomfortably familiar, more flat-out horror than in all the genre films this year, and a strangely subtle performance by Laura Dern.  There is a narrative; half-submerged, its spine visible at times, holding the disparate elements together.  Still, it's a film to be experienced rather than interpreted.  Take it for what it is- a disturbing, gorgeous, mysterious, waking nightmare.",1187395200,4,470,5.882352941176471
2839684,4,B000QQFKYE,"This film is all about Laura Dern and her talent, I could see her getting an oscar nomination for this one.  For three hours she gets to act pretty much every emotion possible as her character Nikki Grace and the character her character is playing Susan Blue in this film within a film within a dreamlike/Nightmare world which goes deeper and deeper into the rabbit hole where there are actual rabbits in costumes.

So, what is this new three hour film from David Lynch about?  I asked myself that same question before watching it so I turned over the box to find, no explanation.  Perhaps they didn't understand it completely either.  I'll give it a shot Laura Dern's character is an actress who gets a role in a film, after signing on she is told that the film is actually a remake of a polish film called 47, which was never finished due to a tragedy and the film itself is said to be cursed.  Sounds simple enough, nope, her life begins to mimic the fictional film they are shooting.  Through this film we have jealous husbands, lovers, polish gangsters, murderers, moments of horror, the giant bunnies i mentioned above and a cool and diverse soundtrack.  To go into great detail and analyze this film would take away from the viewers experience of discovering something completely new and unpredictable where there are no rules.

The viewer should pay close attention to everything said in this film as things are revealed in no order and things that made no sense at the beginning ""might"" make sense at the end or the middle or somewhere.  You may want to view it again after seeing it as there is a lot to absorb.  The Internet Movie Database puts this in the drama and mystery genre, the mystery may be the film itself.

2839685,5,B000QQFKYE,"I gotta say, although the movie at this moment doesn't totally make complete sense to me right now it was definitely not a dull film. If you have any shred of emotion this movie will most likely disturb you. It doesn't SEEM to follow any linear structure for large, vast parts of the film but I think it adds to the overall mood. This movie is definitely not a passive viewing experience. It is a puzzle. There's definitely a story being told but not one that is immediately obvious.  The movie plays out like a long nightmare. I found this aspect of it particularly intriguing because I have had nightmares that have felt exactly like this movie many times before. The soundtrack is masterfully done and it sets the mood(s) perfectly. Even though this movie doesn't make immediate sense I do not get the feeling that it's just David Lynch screwing around - There's a definite plot to the film but YOU have to figure it out on your own, using your own mind. It's watching a puzzle in action. If you're up for a long movie that is challenging and thoughtprovoking, watch this, but if you watched Rush Hour 3 and came away from it thinking Brett Ratner was a genius or you think Eraserhead was too weird, run away from this film.",1187308800,3,1227,4.477678571428571
2839686,2,B000QQFKYE,"Even by David Lynchian standards this was a convoluted, incomprehensible mess. After enduring nearly 3 hours of jumbled vignettes of disjointed scenes, many in camera obscura, many in Polish, and many with people wearing donkey heads (??or mouse heads), with an obligato of blaring, jarring noises, I finally succumbed to the inevitable: this is simply not good. Lynch is making too many demands upon this humble viewer. I know. I know. It's phantasmagorical, artistic genius that I've just witnessed. Well, maybe. But nevertheless it was not in the least understandable nor, for that reason primarily,  enjoyable.

I watch movies in the main to be entertained, sometimes educated. This opus did neither. I came away bored and dissatisfied. I felt like I had just been privy to someone's psychotic nightmare.",1187308800,3,808,5.255813953488372
2839687,2,B000QQFKYE,"Being an admirer of Lynch's prior films, I must admit I was sadly disappointed by this one.  Maybe it's just me, but I could not get into the complex narrative -- mainly due to all the abstractions and hairpin turns.  One thing I noticed was that Lynch's art seemed to play a much larger part in this work than any other.  And by that I mean the imagery that prevails in his photography, painting, sculpture, etc.  It felt as though this film was an assemblage of media and ideas of sorts.  But because of that, I felt the film suffered.  Or, maybe it didn't suffer.  Maybe that's what it was meant to be.  I, on the other hand, was hoping for a different kind of narrative.  And I suppose my biggest criticism of this piece is simply based on the idea that the world already contains odd, creepy and weird things -- so why work SO hard at creating artificially odd scenarios?  This just felt like more like film as ""art"" as opposed to film as many of us tend to know it and expect.  I have yet to watch the extras, but they sound great.",1187222400,5,1037,4.239795918367347
2839688,5,B000QQFKYE,"There are some artists such as Thomas Pynchon, James Joyce and Ornette Coleman that transcend the apparent limitations of the artistic fields in which they toil. Their work is deeper and more expansive than that of their colleagues, opening doors of multiple perspectives that encourage limitless ways of seeing and experiencing the world(s) that we too often take for granted. David Lynch is one of those artists.

Inland Empire is a visual and aural masterpiece, a seamless work of art, a tour de force of imagination and poetic skill. For those who like their art pure and without boundaries, I'm of the opinion that Inland Empire is one of the greatest films of all time. And the rabbits are pure genius.",1187222400,8,708,4.851239669421488
2839689,5,B000QQFKYE,"David Lynch has crafted his least constrained and truest independent film since Eraserhead. Inland Empire dips into David's well of ideas from almost all his other films, and especially his other online works (Darkend Room/Rabbits)as well as his paintings and sculptures.
  The Lynch diehards are treated to many fan nods during the first act of this cryptic cinematic hedgemaze,(coffee closeups,vet Lynch actors etc) Then during an 1 & 1/2 hour tirade the second act tears through the viewers psyche and preconceptions with razor blades and chainsaws, allowing Laura Dern to flex her abilities in the finest performance by a female lead in 2007 as Nikki Grace.  The third act mezmerizes provided the viewer has paid adequate attention to the hints and details of preceding material.  David's soundscape is as usual impeccable with audio clues often providing more hints than the images themselves.  The music fits into place like it was born to be there slightly overpowering the nuanced dialogue in many scenes. After being taken on this darkened funhouse ride we are left with glimmers of solace during the final credits.
If you have an intolerance for David Lynch's work this just isn't the cup of tea your looking for as he really has created his least compromised and most personal work to date,what I feel is a film within a film within a radio play.  There will be many interpretations and thats what makes this mans work special, a filmmaker with a painters vision, a writers wit, and a musicians ear who lets the audience be a part of the work.

2839690,4,B000QQFKYE,"With Inland Empire, (and I must add Mulholland Drive too), David Lynch, I suspect, has begun to turn inward, most likely mirroring the bizarre twisted view he has of Hollywood. He shows the Hollywood sign almost right away. I am sure to some extent he sees this word on a day to day basis, meeting big phony types, muscle with money, burnt out old stars, pretty boys, nymphs, foreigners, empty sound stages, lame lunch meetings, half baked projects, empty mansions with nothing going on, and all the horrid, strange people met and absorbed on that filthy rich littered landscape. Take all this, and twist it up, pull it, heat it, and mirror it upon itself, upside down and backwards through the Lynch mind and you have Inland Empire.

To say it was either good or bad would be doing the film an injustice. David Lynch's films have become so enigmatic, this one in particular, that to give a yay or nay nod to the film would be to feign some sort of rudimentary understanding of it. I suspect Lynch himself knows no more what he is doing than any of us do, say, when we are asleep, deep in dreams, floating in the abyss of our minds collective soup. This is not a bad thing it's just become surrealism, pure and simple. This is a surrealist film. It cannot be judged as most films are. It stands, pretty much, outside the scope of what I mostly see. I enjoy the change I assure you. Yet the film does not register with me as most films do. This film floats.

One part even seems culled from an old Abbot & Costello routine with Irons telling Bucky to move it down while Bucky comically moves it up.

Other parts, with actors from his other films seem almost as if they have spilled right out of those Lynch movies as real/imagined actors moving on to appear in Inland Empire, as fictional versions of themselves. The recognizable faces such as Dern & Irons only help to remind me I am watching a made up film. I found it hard to lose myself in this. This is often the case with recognizable talent where little or nothing is done to make their People Magazine, normal, every day faces look different.  I suspect this was intentional. Still anyone's guess is as good as mine. Lynch has just become so esoteric that reviewing this film on acid would probably get one better results.

It's worth seeing, and more than once for sure. Is it worth loving? For me, the verdict is still out. Sometimes films need a few decades to cook in my mind before they gel into something my unconscious starts to desire all on its own.",1187136000,52,2515,4.4468546637744035
2839691,2,B000QQFKYE,"I have been a David Lynch fan for many years, but having seen this film knowing nothing about it beforehand, except the fact that Lynch wrote and directed it, I can understand why he named the company responsible for its production ""Absurda."" The film certainly has some memorable (and sinister) scenes, but taken as a whole, it appears to be an example of theater of the absurd with elements of Grand Guignol. Some reviewers seem to have embraced an emperor's new clothes perspective in their comments, which may amuse Mr. Lynch if he ever reads them.

By the way, William H. Macy appears briefly (although uncredited) as a TV announcer.

One of the noteworthy extras on the second disk  is a short film of Lynch cooking quinoa with broccoli, and telling a strange - and absurd - story about traveling by train from Greece through Yugoslavia to Venice.

I would advise potential viewers to rent this film (preferably from a library) before investing money to buy it.",1187136000,3,967,4.772455089820359
2839692,5,B000QQFKYE,"Inland Empire is without a doubt one of the most bizarre, yet beautiful David Lynch films that I've ever seen. It also had one of the most interesting plots I've seen in a Lynch film. Understandably, a lot of people aren't going to like this movie because it is far more fractured than the typical Lynch film, which makes his other work seem completely straightforward, and that is definitely a feat. Plus, it's quite long and most people barely have enough patience to get through an hour and a half of a typical Lynch-esque story line. It was also completely terrifying. There were a lot of very amazing psychological scare scenes. I noticed that Lynch used some of the same Penderecki score that was used in Stanley Kubrick's The Shining, which was a lovely touch. Music like that should be utilized far more in horror and psychological suspense films. Another interesting addition was the behind the scenes featurette on the 2nd disc. It shows that David Lynch is a very passionate artist and filmmaker who knows EXACTLY what he wants and demands it from his cast and crew. He gets right in there and very enthusiastically describes everything he wants from his actors. There were a few interesting scenes where he loses his patience with Laura Dern. Ironically, some of their banter reminded me of the behind the scenes of the movie The Shining and the relationship between Stanley Kubrick and Shelley Duvall, only not quite to that degree. Regardless, it is definitely the type of movie that needs to be watched again and again in order to catch little bits that weren't noticed before.  The bottom line is that David Lynch is a master storyteller and approaches his films in a completely unique and interesting way.  This is why they seem so fractured and end up confounding so many people.  However, if you are willing to open yourself up to it and have patience, you will be rewarded with a truly wonderful and haunting story that will stay with you for a long time after.",1187136000,5,1981,4.719653179190751
2839693,5,B000QQFKYE,"I think this is David Lynch's most visually interesting and beautiful film.  It wasn't really as strange or off the wall as I thought it would be after reading some of the reviews of it. It is gorgeous to look at and listen to and (at least for me) had a huge emotional impact.  I loved it.
Where do I think it fits in as far as overall excellence in terms of Lynch's feature films?  Better than ELEPHANT MAN, STRAIGHT STORY, MULHOLLAND DRVIE, and WILD AT HEART, but not so good as BLUE VELVET, ERASERHEAD, DUNE, FIRE WALK WITH ME or LOST HIGHWAY.  Just my opinion.  The DVD extras are awesome with excellent ""stories"" ala the stories on the ERASERHEAD and SHORT FILMS DVD's.  My favorite extra is a cooking demonstration from Lynch.  This is great stuff.",1187049600,3,755,4.467153284671533
2839694,5,B000QQFKYE,"I have to say, I don't even know where to begin to write this review. By now, anyone who has been interested in this film knows the basic plot, so I'll spare you any details. All I have to say is this: if you are a Lynch fan, this is a must! It's one of the most rewarding mind trips that I've ever seen. There are some horrifying scenes here, but it's just like any other Lynch film - the scares presented here are more psychological than ""jump"" scares. Don't go into this expecting to jump out of your seat every minute. Most of it is a twisted mystery, sort of like ""Mulholland Drive"". There's lots of dialogue that is essential to the plot, so you have to PAY ATTENTION! No bathroom breaks! There is no intermission, and the DVD doesn't have chapter stops, so if you do have to piss, you best hit pause, because if you stop it, it'll start back right at the beginning. The two-disc DVD set is amazing. I need to watch it again. It blew my expectations away. I was expecting something completely different. RENT IT, BUY IT, just as long as you see it!

Highly, highly recommended!

***I have a correction to make. The DVD does indeed contain chapter stops. I did not realize this until recently. David Lynch doesn't usually have chapter stops on his DVDs. He tends to believe films should be viewed in one sitting, but I guess he made an exception for this one.***",1187049600,4,1367,4.356862745098039

2839697,3,B000QQFKYE,"I'm a huge David Lynch fan, I've loved every movie of his.  ""Blue Velvet"" will always be one of my favorite films, with ""Mulholland Drive"" close behind - I've seen them both many, many times.  I was even more excited when I learned this is 3 hours long - a 3 hour David Lynch trip is an exciting and scary idea.  I watched about an hour and a half, waiting for it to grab me, but it didn't, and not because it didn't make sense (that's normal for Lynch), but because, unlike ""Mulholland Drive"" or ""Eraserhead"", the mystery was leaving me cold.  I kept feeling like he was reusing old ideas, and just simply trying to be complex for the sake of being complex.  I've seen ""Blue Velvet"" and ""Mulholland Drive"" enough to remember exact shots, scenes and dialogue, and several times those showed up again in this.  Eventually I started thinking this is actually a sequel to ""Mulholland Drive"", complete with Laura Harring appearing during the credits.  This is worth watching for a die-hard David Lynch fan, but speaking as a die-hard one, I was disappointed.  I kept getting the feeling that Lynch was too self-conscious in this one - too many scenes and way too much dialogue just came across as ""I'm David Lynch, being David Lynch"".  Disc 2 didn't help this - an hour and 15 minutes of deleted scenes (so it could have been four hours and 15 minutes of mystery instead), Lynch cooking (didn't care), Lynch just talking for 40 minutes (didn't care, after watching this film).  I feel like we're not far from having a 30 minute featurette that just shows David Lynch sleeping.  Not much of the film was very original, and unlike ""Mulholland Drive"", I didn't find the mystery intriguing or worth trying to understand (the unmade film was named ""47"", the room number of the rabbit people - got it, but so?)  I do give this 3 stars because it's worth seeing once, for Lynch fans, and because there are some arresting and disturbing images and ideas that were even new for him - the rabbit people start out as a funny idea and quickly become a creepy one.  And Laura Dern will probably never again have a film role that gives her this wide a range - it's incredible to see the variety of things she goes through and becomes.  It is worth watching for that reason too.",1186876800,3,2259,4.504901960784314

2839700,5,B000QQFKYE,"What David Lynch accomplishes with ""Inland Empire"" is nothing less than the re-imagination of an art form. By the end of the film, he's managed to strip away all of the superficial conventions of the genre (plot cohesiveness, realistic character development, and eventually comprehensibility itself...), leaving behind only the fantastic and frightening vision that fueled its creation. There's no journey quite like Inland Empire, and most audience members will undoubtedly find very little to like about it. However, if you're willing to surrender your rational mind to the strange currents that drive this film, you're sure to be changed irrevocably. In any case, Laura Dern's raw and powerful performance is in itself worth the price of a ticket...",1186272000,4,752,5.38135593220339
2839701,3,B000QQFKYE,"Inland Empire is one of Lynch's most unique pictures, a really strange, vivid, haunting, yet flawed movie.  Its main flaw is its mammoth running time (3 hours), and that Lynch has abandoned (at least for now) 35mm film in favor of digital video.  David likes the DV a lot more, but it also detracts from the film itself, as it's often muddy (especially when projected) and, at times, amateurish.  While Lynch was making this film, he took his time over a period of 2 years, making it was exactly as he wanted it.  I feel that sometimes that allows a filmmaker to be too indulgent, and this film often feels like that.  But there are so many instances of filmic brilliance that the film is still worth watching.

Kudos to the actors who not only reside in Lynch's world, but who give great performances.  Laura Dern is phenomenal as the woman, Jeremy Irons is very good, and Justin Theroux gives another brooding performane in a Lynch film (he was fabulous in Mulholland Drive).  Theroux has a really brooding intensity and nervous energy, like he's about to flip out at any time.  While I feel the film would have been better if he had shot it in 35mm, it's still good.  Lynch could film with an ancient, hand crank camera from the silent days and still make something interesting.  This film is really something to see, despite its flaws.  It makes you think for days afterwards.  Lynch is a great filmmaker, one of the greatest working in cinema today.  A work like this demands respect, and should be treated with such.  That doesn't mean you have to love it, but you should at least acknowledge its ambition and respect it for that.

The special features are range from quite good to a waste of time.  There is some great behind the scenes footage (a huge cut above the usual, Hollywood featurette) where we see Lynch happy, exhilarated, and very angry.  Kudos to Lynch for showing his dark (bad pun, I know) side.  A man named Jeremy (his co-producer) gets it the worst from Lynch.  Lynch even helps build sets (which is mentioned in the credits).  There are 2 short films on the supplemental disc, one called Ballerina (which, honestly, is really, really boring), and Quinoa, where we see David Lynch cooking, what else, Quinoa.  It's interesting mainly because it's David Lynch doing the cooking, but it's nothing really earth shattering.  There are 75 minutes of deleted scenes, some interesting, some really boring.  It may have been interesting to edit them together into a 75 minute film, but Lynch didn't do that.  The deleted scenes (or as he calls it ""more things that happened"") happen back to back without any attempt at cohesion.

Overall, Inland Empire is a very good film, recommended mainly to Lynch fans.",1186012800,3,2725,4.69620253164557
2839702,5,B000QQFKYE,"We just saw David's INLAND EMPIRE last night at the Aero Theater in Santa Monica where it was playing for a four-night limited engagement. As much as I look forward to the DVD, I'm so glad to have caught this on the big screen. The visuals are often so dark and moody that it demands a large screen. This movie is not typical Lynch fare. Rather, it is Lynch outdoing Lynch. The story is surreal and experimental. You can try to follow it but a lot of what you see will be left to interpretation. Do not look for a simple connect-the-dots story because it's not there. However, I highly recommend this film because of its abstractionist qualities, the acting, and the cinematography. It is beautifully filmed. Well, perhaps ""beautifully"" isn't the right adjective; it's hauntingly captivating. Mainstream and even so called ""cutting edge"" directors would do well to study this film. Lynch can take any scene and make it creepy in a way 99.9% of Hollywood directors simply cannot do. He is magical in this regard. As a graphic artist, INLAND EMPIRE was, to me, a three-hour art lesson. I walked away from this film and felt re-energized, as if I'd just been given a ""how-to"" instruction manual on the unsettling. Lynch uses both black and white and color throughout this picture and he does so seemlessly. Laura Dern should have gotten an Oscar nod for her performance; it is her finest work to date and you will be blown away by her range. There is not a bad performance in this film. It is, of course, not going to appeal to fans of mainstream studio Hollywood, but would you really want it to? See this movie on the big screen if it comes to your neighborhood; prepare to be creeped out. With Hollywood circling the drain for ideas, we need David Lynch more now than ever before.",1185062400,8,1780,4.58307210031348
2839703,4,B000QQFKYE,"That's the question that I first began asking myself years ago, after seeing ""Blue Velvet"" for the first time.  His films befuddle me, aggravate me, mesmerize me, and keep me coming back for more.  Originally, one of his films that I found the most infuriatingly obscure, ""Mulholland Drive"", I have now seen at least twenty times.  It's come to be possibly my favorite movie of all time, and I understand the plot almost perfectly (I think!).  But of course there's always more to know.  He's challenged me to understand concepts in a less linear, literal way, and to trust my instincts.  Lynch is all about diving into the endless subconscious: there's no limit to how far you can go.  Sometimes, I feel David Lynch is less of a motion picture director, and more of an abstract painter, using film instead of canvas.  No one asks why Picasso created lopsided people, or why Van Gogh saw everything in broad hyper-colors.  There are the same interesting themes that run through Lynch's works.  All of them have a dreamlike, nightmarish quality: beautiful and yet terrifying.  They all seem (to me) to prey on our universal fear of mortality, taking us to the brink of death, then grabbing us back to reality...and life.  Perhaps David has more in common with the painter Edvard Munch.

Yet, I was stunned with disillusion when I saw ""Inland Empire"" on the big screen.  As weird and indecipherable as Lynch's works are (I thought nothing could top ""Eraserhead"" or ""Fire Walk With Me"" in that department), ""Empire"" really pushes the envelope into The Twilight Zone.  I couldn't follow the vague, impromptu screenplay at all.  Some of the choices David made seemed deranged, even for him.  Why was ""The Phantom"" mentioned, then dropped entirely?  What happened to the murdered actor and actress from the first version of ""On High On Blue Tomorrows""?  What was the reason behind Laura Dern's hideous print dresses?  Who was the homicidal woman with the screwdriver?  Why the subtitles for homeless people, when they could be understood perfectly?

Have I peaked your interest yet?  Despite I.E.'s three-hour running time, I was never bored for one second.  And, as always, I could not stop thinking about it.  Lynch inspires thought, conversation, and controversy.  That's a mark of greatness.

There were many things I loved, loved, loved in ""Empire"".  The ominous, loopy gypsy neighbor played by Grace Zabriskie was worth my ten bucks alone.  Some of the technical shots---Laura Dern running head-on into the camera's view in slow-motion, then suddenly speeding up like a 747; Susan (Laura) shooting an approaching menace, who then turns into her own image as she fires the gun, the grotesquely made-up face disolving like a melting clown.  Pure genius. Surprisingly, I totally got the sit-com with the people in rabbit suits, the laugh track, and the woman watching all of this on a TV while she weeps.  It connects (in my mind) to Susan's death among the homeless, while we, the real audience, laugh at their innocuous conversation.

Ultimately, David Lynch would reach a far wider, more appreciative viewer population if he didn't seem to deliberately strive to be so odd.  But then, what would there be to talk about???

So should David Lynch be taken seriously?  I think I just answered my own question.  Can't WAIT for the DVD, so I can see it again...and again...",1184716800,11,3368,4.909574468085107
2839704,4,B000QQFKYE,"""We are like the spider.
We weave our life and then move along in it.
We are like the dreamer
who dreams and then lives in the dream.
This is true for the entire universe.""

These were the opening words that Lynch spoke during his introduction for INLAND EMPIRE at various theaters around the county in early 2007. If we are willing to trust Lynch's choice of words, this quote from the Upanishads opens a small window into the world of this film. Admiring any artists' work, requires a certain amount of trust in the artist. Their job is to ask questions (through their work) and our job is to verify what is true for ourselves. But that process is not necessarily a linear or an intellectual one. Such is the case with INLAND EMPIRE's complex meta-physical web. I consider this film to be a 21st century Alice in (a) wonderland (of hell). And in this film, hungry ghosts abound.

Having read the Amazon reviews, I wanted to take mine in a slight different direction. Not since Eraserhead has Lynch had the artistic license and freedom to create a film so free of typical constraints. In this sense, this is his most ""uncompromising"" film yet. Having evolved further as a filmmaker, he has established his own distinct palette of colors from which to work. There is a good deal of continuity from one project to another and these qualities can be a clue as to the enigma that is INLAND EMPIRE. Lynch has described that some ideas for this latest endeavor had been with him for several years. This would suggest that there is a definite bridge between this and MULHOLLAND DRIVE. There are striking similarities.

Despite our human nature to try to make sense of unfamiliar territory, Lynch is not only aware of this natural tendency, but not interested in explanations. His job is to create something very visceral within the narrative of a story infused by the world of ideals. This is what makes his work so damn challenging - we are so busy hanging on to ""rationality,"" we undervalue intuition and our ability to sense what we experience. It is also a testament to the many levels on which Lynch's films work. Rather than grasping at any ""meaning"" that may (or may not) be there, it is interesting to see how far we, as viewers, can allow ourselves to be absorbed into what we are seeing and experiencing. Lynch's ability to lay out very effective ground rules is what elevates his work into the realm of Hitchcock, Bunuel, Fellini, and others. And like a Buddhist sand mandala, what appears to be a flat one dimensional thing, turns out to be multi-dimensional house of many mansions. Lynch films are not for the passive.

I would have to echo the sentiment that Lynch's work, does not have a ""center"" or a set ""reality,"" in a typical sense. Not taking this into account and trying to ""figure out"" meaning, if not fun for some, will be very frustrating for others. As is often the case, it is here that much unjustified criticism is leveled at Lynch (""weird for weirds sake"") - which totally ignores the extraordinary thing he his doing cinematically. There are deep places he wishes to take the audience and therefore it is  important to understand that in a Lynch film, the only reality is the fact that he made a film and that there is an audience in the theater watching it. Beyond that, as in the dream world, you are on your own.

When I first saw INLAND EMPIRE, I knew it was going to be a long movie, and I accepted the fact that I was about to pay money and, as if I was attending a carnival, going to be taken on a little ride (in tandem with a few thousand companions). Before I knew it, the ride was over and I found myself walking out of the theater, a little disoriented and wondering what the hell I just experienced. Woman in trouble, indeed. Amazing film. As Lynch has said: ""...there is the story and then there is the way a story is told...""

Uncharacteristically, there are about 40 DVD ""chapter stops,"" throughout the feature - though there is no menu nor are these stops named. Perhaps it was done because the film is almost 3 hours in duration, but Lynch addresses this issue during one of the interviews on the second disc. It seems that he has shifted his position on the matter and in doing so created these ""stops"" in the least obnoxious way possible. Also interesting to note is that there are at least 3 different cover artwork designs available. Just what we need: more doppelgangers! And some editions of the DVD come with a reproduction of the black and white INLAND EMPIRE movie poster.

While premiering INLAND EMPIRE, Lynch spoke about what we could expect in terms of a DVD release mentioning that it was going to be fun and include some really great things. This is certainly the case!

Extra features include an additional 211 minutes:
""Lynch 2"" - behind the scenes w/Lynch directing INLAND EMPIRE,
Short film titled ""Ballerina,""
Additional character experiences titled ""More Things That Happened"" which seems to be ""deleted"" or extra scenes - total duration: 74 minutes,
Three theatrical trailers,
Lynch sharing a few ""Stories,""
A 73 photo stills gallery,
and Lynch demonstrating his very own quinoa recipe!

Beautiful.

Oh yes - on a lighter note and contributing one of the films more hilarious scenes, look for Lynch voicing the inept stage hand ""Bucky.""

2839710,5,B000QQFKYE,"Shot on digital video, rather than film, David Lynch's ""INLAND EMPIRE"" takes him out of the mainstream, if you can call ""Mulholland Drive"" and ""Blue Velvet"" mainstream, into the realm of pure Independent film making: producing films with little money and without any outside interference.

At the beginning of this film Laura Dern plays Nikki Grace, a diva-like actress frantically waiting for word from the producers of a film that she would like to do. This part of the film is very straightforward but Lynch straightforward which means that 1+1 almost never equals 2. This is where Nikki/Laura begins. By the end of the film she/they are unhappy, bored, frantic, living in a one-story, California Ranch-style house in what looks to be the Inland Empire (Riverside, Corona): the fastest growing section of Southern California. Does this have any significance as far as Lynch is concerned or is his Inland Empire one of the mind? I don't really know for sure and in Lynch's world this ambiguity makes the proceedings troubling, puzzling and fascinating all at the same time. Rational ambivalence is called for when dealing (as in viewing and describing) with Lynch's films except maybe for the almost straightforward and appropriately named, ""Straight Story.""

In regards to Laura Dern: as Jeanne Moreau was for Godard, as Deneuve was for Bunuel and Truffaut, as Audran was for Bunuel and Chabrol, Dern is Lynch's muse: the actress he chooses to personify his dreams and nightmares. Dern is neither a plush toy nor a sexpot-type of actress. She is tall, imposing yet warm, emotionally available, argumentative, brittle, ready and willing to give any man or woman a run for their money in life as well as in bed. Look to Lynch's recurring choice of Dern for hints as to what is going on his volatile mind and his brilliant films.

There are moments of great beauty and clarity here for Lynch is nothing if not a superior artist capable of making his striking images, film moments and whole scenes effective and thoughtful as well as funny and scary as all hell.

""I Don't Get IT""......"" You Got IT!"" (as quoted from"" Premiere"" which also states that Lynch himself has explained ""INLAND EMPIRE"" as making ""perfect sense."") is the mantra of Lynchists (or Lynchpins) and in regards to ""INLAND EMPIRE"" this phrase seems wholly appropriate.",1180742400,23,2335,4.964194373401535

I only have a region one player, no issues.

Again, english subtitles work great, it plays, it even has 6 chapter stops which i think is a first for me and films by Lynch.
