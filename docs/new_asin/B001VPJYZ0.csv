3823138,5,B001VPJYZ0,"This is probably one of the most orighinal shows on television. I was immediately hooked on this show! However, far be it to say that this show is perfect.  It hurts to say that this show has been going downhill, starting with season five. However, it is such a GREAT show that even with a few lackluster seasons, Scrubs is still one of the best shows on television.  This season the show went back to it's roots, and it remind everyone why so many people did not want to let the series die.  This is one of the best seasons, and possibly the last. And if that is the case, Mr. Lawrence you could not have ended it better.

3823139,4,B001VPJYZ0,"The last two seasons of Scrubs have clearly been plagued with bad luck, whether it's the Writer's Strike, network switching, actors' contracts ending, or just a lack of funding for an incredible cult television program. This season, unfortunately, was bad enough to make me stop watching for several weeks. It's far from the funniest season of Scrubs, which I'd say occured around Season 5, but a bad season of Scrubs is the eqivalent of a good season for most sitcoms out now. Scrubs is by far one of the more creatively funny shows out there and deserves way more recognition that it has recieved. If you're truly a fan of Scrubs, buy this season; although it's a lackluster season as a whole, a couple of the episodes (including the absolutely perfect finale) make it worth owning.",1241654400,7,784,4.772058823529412

3823205,5,B001VPJYZ0,"Scrubs is probably one of the best TV shows we have ever seen. Even though I purchased my season at Best Buy, I'm still reviewing it here. This is a show that will make you laugh and cry all in one episode. Every time we watched an episode we felt so connected to the characters. If your looking for a funny show that has a serious side this is definitely for you. I would definitely recommend this show. As the seasons move forward the show just get better and deeper and better!!",1389312000,,481,4.239130434782608

Janitor is still pretty great in this!!",1377993600,,401,4.36
3823208,4,B001VPJYZ0,This was another goofy fun season of Scrubs.  You can really tell they were heading toward the end of the series though.  But totally worth it for the collection and we couldn't beat the price!,1373932800,,193,4.485714285714286

3823221,5,B001VPJYZ0,"Before they changed a lot and added more characters for the 9th season I felt like the 8th season was the actual series finale. Just a great show overall. I loved all the characters and the set up for the show was great with little side clips and flashbacks. Zach Braff definitely made the show and everyone fed off each other on the show. The comedy was a little quirky, but if you like that kind of stuff you won't be disappointed. Obviously if you bought this you like the show so you will know what to expect with this. The series finale was great and a good way to wrap up the whole show. I felt like there were a lot of good life lessons throughout the show, good laughs, great characters, walked a good line of funny and serious, and the music was always great too.

3823227,4,B001VPJYZ0,"The eighth season was good, but there is definitely a different feel to it than what there was in the preceding seasons. The final episode was a great finale. Some of the episodes in between were almost too hokey. I'm glad The Janitor and Ted found love, but that didn't really go with the rest of the show as a whole. JD and Elliot's relationship seemed just the same as some of the other sitcoms (think Ross and Rachael, particularly).

3823242,3,B001VPJYZ0,"My fiancee and I have been major Scrubs junkies for years and we own all of the seasons. 1-5 are the best. Scrubs starts going downhill at 6, takes a sharp-turn towards Suckville at season 7, by 8 & 9 its a clash between annoying (Katie & Denise) and frustrating (Ed & Drew). Elliot's melodramatic attitude over the slightest thing gets taken up a few notches and (unfortunately) she becomes less foot-in-mouth funny and more Bipolar.

Season 8: Everything important has already happened in the Scrubs universe, so you don't need to purchase this. The final 2 episodes are very memorable though, I teared up. I won't ruin it for you. If you do buy this, laughs are few and jokes are repeats from prior seasons.

7th season sucks but the 8th season will make you atleast appreciate it. Avoid 9th. Unless it's like $5 (including shipping) it isn't worth it. Season 8 ended the way 7th should have, and if it wasn't for the said finale I would rate this 2 stars (9th shouldn't have happened). ""Bonus features"" range from mediocre (bloopers & alternate lines) to just awful (webisodes) and this season isn't graced with an attractive slip-cover.",1356220800,,1141,4.728643216080402

3823244,5,B001VPJYZ0,"I loved this series!
I never much cared for sitcoms, but this one won me over from the start and kept me hooked throughout its successful run.

The actors deliver their roles exceptionally well and keep you laughing, not to mention somewhat exposed to medical realities and the heartbreaking wisdom that comes from seeing people dealing with difficult issues. I work in a healthcare setting, so I know that they always did a good job of keeping it real.

Although there was a 9th season, this one (season 8) is the true last season as it is where JD says goodbye. The full cast, including the production crew, are not all involved with season 9. And without JD, the ""bro-mance"" between he and Turk that we came to love and laugh at makes for a HUGE hole in season 9 episodes.

But this review is about Season 8 ...

The finale is extended over two episodes, and for me has the most emotionally charged climactic final scene of any sitcom I've seen - and that includes the very famous MASH finale. The director (who does occasional cameos and shows up in the last scene) put together a marvelous goodbye that sticks with you for a while.

Makes me wish it would never end...",1355616000,4,1173,4.488262910798122

3823261,5,B001VPJYZ0,"Scrubs was one of my favorite TV sitcoms with it's combination of absurd visual humor, over the top characters and poignant sometimes harsh truths of modern health care and the medical world, taking many serious and difficult to swallow themes and packaging it as something people outside of the medical field can understand and accept.  Ask many real world health care professionals like doctors and nurses and they will tell you, as silly as Scrubs appears on the surface, it still has the most accurate portrayals of life in the hospital underneath the goofy veneer, something many much more 'serious' shows fail to capture.

Scrubs approached its 8th season and the final one with the full main cast with a release in gloriious HD, marking the time when ABC changed many of its shows to full widescreen HD broadcast format.  Of course this yielded a release on home video in bluray and we only have to benefit for it.  Great video and audio was accompanied by lots of bluray added extras making this a great collection for any Scrubs fan.

As for the ninth season which feels more like a spinoff series, i'll leave that for other reviews to comment on.",1305590400,,1156,4.731343283582089
3823262,1,B001VPJYZ0,"My thoughts are on the actual product of DVD and not on the show itself.  The show is fantastic, but the DVDs you buy are not.

The copy protection is quite ridiculous.  It would not play on my PC at all.  I switched programs to try and get it to play in another way and it only played like a scrambled TV channel.  I then popped this disc into a DVD player connected only to a TV set and it worked.

Went to a different PC and the movies would not play.  I then did a small amount of research and found that both seasons 8 and 9 of scrubs have very problematic copy protection.

I can highly recommend seasons 1 - 7 to buy on DVD for sitcom fans.  However, seasons 8 and 9 should take some consideration.  If you want to have flexibility with the media you buy, you might consider passing.  If you can get past the intentional problems introduced to the media, then the show itself is quite good.

Notes on content:  I have grown to love the new characters introduced.  Only a few in season 8, many others in season 9 and am now sad the show has ended.  I think I could have enjoyed a few more seasons with the new crew.  However, since this is a physical product you are purchasing, too much weight goes into actually being able to view the material itself.

3823266,5,B001VPJYZ0,"Very seldom is a show able to find its groove again after taking the dip into mediocrity. Scrubs is one of the few that was able to revive its roots and go out on a high note. Season 8 was one of the best of the show, and in my opinion, one of the best final seasons of a show I've ever seen (no, we're not counting Season 9 here).

There are two distinct differences in Season 8.
* First off, in order to cut costs, each main character, even JD, was absent from a few shows. Sarah Chalke and Zach Braff didn't appear in two episodes, while the rest of the main cast (meaning the characters that appear on the DVD box) missed three apiece. Not only does this not hinder the show by any means, I actually think it strengthens it. By focusing on fewer characters an episode, it created a stronger connection between some of them. One episode in particular (one of the two without JD) was centered around Turk and Eliot, and I think was the best insight into their relationship in the entire series. You see a lot more of this, and believe me, it's a good thing.

* Secondly, and rather appropriately, the show toned down on some of the silliness that made it unique in the first seven seasons. As a matter of fact, it's the complete opposite of Season 7. I thought the strike-shortened season was way too heavy on the absurdity. Ironically, there was an episode of Season 7 in which JD wonders if he needs to grow up. At that point in the series, you figure the main characters are well into their 30's. The character growth and maturation that was missing in Season 7 became a driving force in Season 8. It was still quirky, still hilarious, but more touching, more ""grown up"" than it'd ever been. It was a conscious effort for the writers to start working towards a resolution for each character, and I honestly felt that each actor, notably Ken Jenkins (who portrays Dr. Kelso), played their role beautifully. The show was still about the hospital, which was an element I felt they started to get away from in Seasons 6 & 7, but it was also about the lives of the hospital's staff, and the writers created a perfect balance to bring this show to a near picture perfect close.

I just had three issues with Season 8, one of them of which the show no longer had control over.

- I know opinions on Kim's character, portrayed by Elizabeth Banks, are split down the middle. However, I always liked Kim and wished the show had used her more in Season 8. With main characters consistently absent from episodes in Season 8, it would've been a perfect time to develop the mother of JD's child a little bit more before the series closed. I always felt like she and JD had a kind of dysfunctional chemistry, and it made for some great scenes and episodes from the end of Season 5 to the end of the series. However disappointed in her only appearing in two episodes, I did enjoy the twist ending they gave to her story.

- A gaping hole in Season 8, though there was nothing the show could do about this, was the lacking presence of Laverne. From what I've read, the show was under the impression that Season 6 was going to be their final season; if they had known otherwise, they wouldn't have brought her character to such an abrupt end. With that said, I know Laverne's death made for a powerful couple of episodes, but in the long run I didn't see the need for it. Of course, she made a couple brief appearances in Season 7 as a new nurse only JD saw as a lookalike, but I still missed Laverne's quick wit and incredible spirit after her unfortunate accident In Season 6.

- Finally, I thought there was far too little of Keith in Season 8. He had obviously become a staple in the cast from Seasons 5 through 7, and though I understand Eliot's decision to end their engagement was a major blow to Keith's role in the show, I don't think they gave his character enough closure. If I'm not mistaken, I believe he only appeared in the first and last episode of Season 8, and he didn't even have a line in the finale. Keith was an important character for the direction of the show in the late seasons and I felt like after the first episode in Season 8, he was just tossed aside and forgotten about.

With that being said, Season 8 of Scrubs was a gem. I've never been a big fan of Season 7, and by the time the fantasy episode aired, I was convinced the writers had run out of ideas and maybe it was time the show had reached its unceremonious ending. I'm happy to say I was proven wrong.
- Courtney Cox played an excellent role as Taylor Maddox, Dr. Kelso's successor as Chief of Medicine. I liked the bizarre personality they gave her combining elements of pure kindness and pure evil. Her role only lasted three episodes, but it got the ball rolling in Season 8.
- Denise, played by Eliza Coupe, was also a pleasant surprise as one of the new interns. From her boyish personality to her odd fetishes to her inability to connect with her patients, I thought the Denise (Jo) character was dynamite whenever on screen. I was impressed with the idea from the writers to pair JD, widely regarded as very feminine, with Denise, who had many masculine qualities. It was a formula made for hilarious scenes. I only wish Denise had been introduced earlier in the show so we could've enjoyed more of her (she was also the only ""new"" character in Season 9 that I thought brought a freshness and high level of humor to the show).

The rest you can find out as you watch. 'My Finale', for the record, is still my favorite series finale ever. There are shows that go out with a bang, there are shows that go out in style with tears all around, and then there are shows that just do it simple and do it right. I feel Scrubs got it right, and because the show was given a chance to finish on their own terms, I think they brought it full circle and saved a series that was in danger of ending on a sour note. I highly recommend this season and hope you enjoy Scrubs as much as I have.

3823267,2,B001VPJYZ0,"I have recently become a huge fan of Scrubs.  I just saw the first season less that two months ago.  Since then, I have bought each season and have had daily Scrubs marathons.

First problem...I have watched the first 7 seasons on the external monitor on my laptop PC.  No problems.  That came to an end with season 8.  Season 8 seems to have some sort of nasty copy protection that prevents playback on a PC.  I tried viewing the season 8 DVD's on 7 different PC's.  These DVD's failed to play on any PC.  I feel ripped off.

Second problem...Scrubs suffers from MASH Syndrome...it gets increasingly dramatic (read sad and depressing) and less humorous with each season.  I watch Scrubs to laugh and enjoy, not to contemplate dialing the suicide hotline.  We all know people pass away in hospitals.  We don't need to get repeatedly smacked in the face with that fact.  I think I laughed 2 or 3 times while watching season 8.  Back in the good old days of season 1, I laughed so much my cheeks and ribs ached in a good way.

Final bit of bad news, the Janitor is still in the show.  I never cared for the Janitor character.  He is inane and the antidote to comedy.  The only time I laughed because of Janitor, was when he used the rabbit peppermill.  And that was visual humor!  Janitor is just a consistently sadistic guy who makes no positive contribution to the show.  In real life, Janitor would have been fired long ago.

If you have seen the first 7 seasons, watching season 8 will only break your heart.",1281398400,,1510,4.410909090909091

3823282,4,B001VPJYZ0,"Season 8 was the first season aired on ABC, which meant a few changes were in store.  In terms of production, a reduced budget meant that each main character was absent from 2 or 3 episodes.  This format actually worked well, as each episode was able to go a little more in depth on certain characters or relationships.  The other minor production change was the outtakes or bloopers added during the end credits, an improvement over the photo stills from previous seasons.

Season 8 was the last season featuring the original ensemble cast.  A LOT of material was crammed into a shorter season to tie up the loose ends.  Most things were done right: JD and Elliot got back together; the interns received meaningful airtime and actually mattered; Kelso became relevant to the storyline again; and a nice multi-episode guest spot by Courtney Cox.  Still, there was the ever-present feeling that the Scrubs world as we knew it had changed: JD had a beard, a baby, and a house; Cox was the new chief; the Janitor got married; and Ted got a girlfriend.

Overall, Season 8 rebounded nicely after one or two so-so seasons and almost got back to the high bar it set for itself in the first few seasons.  The season as a whole was well done (even if the last episode was overly sappy).  The main plotlines were wrapped up nicely, and even though Scrubs is one of my favorite shows, this last season really drilled home the message that things have changed, and it was time to move on.",1264636800,2,1476,4.577946768060836

3823310,5,B001VPJYZ0,"""Scrubs"", the popular medical comedy series which has been a staple on the NBC television network since 2001 but chose not to renew the show and drawing ire from the dedicated fans.  Fortunately, the series was  immediately picked up by ABC for its eighth season.

The longtime comedy series was created by Bill Lawrence (""Spin City"", ""Clone High"" and ""Cougar Town"") and is a medical comedy series which takes place at Sacred Heart Hospital and focuses on the life of Dr. John J.D. Dorian (Zach Braff, ""Garden State"", ""The Last Kiss"").  J.D. has an imaginative mind, thus you often see things through his perspective and what he is saying to himself internally.  He works with his off-and-on again girlfriend Dr. Elliot Reed (Sarah Chalke, ""Clone High"", ""Roseanne"" and ""Nothing Too Good for a Cowboy"") who has a similar sense of humor as him, his best friend Dr. Christopher Turk (Donald Faison, ""The Boondocks"", ""Robot Chicken"") and Turk's wife Nurse Carla Espinosa (Judy Reyes, ""Third Watch"", ""The Passion"").  And at the workplace, J.D. must put up with Dr. Perry Cox (""Any Given Sunday"", ""Stealing Harvard"", ""Office Space"") who seems to not like him and the unusual janitor (Neil Flynn, ""The Middle"", ""Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull"").

With this eighth season, the season will be the final season focusing on the character of Dr. John ""J.D."" Dorian and also included on the Blu-ray are the web episodes of ""Scrubs: Interns"" which was shown on [...].  The eighth season focuses on J.D.'s relationship with Dr. Elliott Reed, working with their new interns but also J.D. leaving Sacred Heart Hospital.

With a successful and special feature heavy DVD released earlier this summer, ""Scrubs"" now enters the High Definition realm with all 19 episodes of  ""Scrubs - The Complete Eighth Season"" are featured on two Blu-ray discs.

VIDEO & AUDIO:

""Scrubs"" is presented in 1080p with an aspect ratio of 1:33:1.  The series is pretty much shot in a hospital but lighting is well-done and there are occasional outdoor scenes.  For this season, it's the first to feature the cast outdoors ala another country.  The two episodes ""My Soul on Fire"" is filmed at the Bahamas (Abacos) and definitely is a major change in pace for the series.  Of course, picture quality for those two episodes alone are quite different as you see the beautiful ocean and scenery of Hopetown.  Otherwise the series looks good and doesn't looked aged or overly compressed.

The series is not exactly ""LOST"" on BD type of quality but for the most part, it's a good video transfer for this series.  Especially since it's shot mostly indoors.

Audio for ""Scrubs"" is in in English 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio (48 kHz/24-bit).  For the most part, the series is a dialogue-driven series.  So, most of the audio is front and center channel driven.  Dialogue is crystal clear but I did notice the difference in how the music comes out of my system compared to the DVD release.  But overall, dialogue is understandable and very clear.

Subtitles are in English SDH, French and Spanish.

JUDGMENT CALL:

I personally feel that it was a blessing for ABC to pick up ""Scrubs"".  With NBC struggling in the past few years with its sitcoms or comedy shows, the move to ABC definitely gave ""Scrubs"" that synergy.  The move to the new network felt right and courtesy of Disney, episodes such as ""My Soul on Fire"" which was shot in the Bahamas would have never happened in the past.  So, it was definitely fun to watch the eighth season.

I think that the season was created with the thought that there would be no ninth season and thus the episodes were created as if it was a final farewell and a nod to dedicated fans who have watched every season of the comedy series.  ""Scrubs"" definitely was a series that will always be remembered, especially as more and more medical dramas continue to air on television, it was nice to see a show parody that and characters that remain as hilarious as they were when the series first started.

With the addition of the interns, it definitely brought something new to the series and I think with [...] trying to create that viral promotion with ""Scrubs: Interns"" was also good planning and helped viewers enjoy these new characters along with the characters that we have watched for nearly a decade.

As for the Blu-ray, ""Scrubs - The Complete Eighth Season"" is magnificent.  Not only were all episodes just hilarious and fun, they really went all out in providing a ton of special features.  I wasn't expecting 16 audio commentaries and the ""Scrubs: Interns"" inclusion on the Blu-ray  was awesome.

Personally, I felt that they were expecting this final season to be the last and so, they went all out with the special features.  So, this season's Blu-ray set will definitely keep ""Scrubs"" fans busy for many hours and suffice to say, fans will get their money's worth with this release.  Absolutely awesome!

As for the Blu-ray versus its DVD counterpart, ""Scrubs"" is presented in 1080p High Definition and an English 5.1 DTS Master Audio lossless soundtrack.  Audio is much clearer and more defined over its DVD counterpart, also you get the SeasonPlay and ""It's All In the Name"" Blu-ray exclusive feature along with all the special features the DVD came with.

With the news that there will be a ninth season of ""Scrubs"", It will be interesting to see what direction the series will go.  Will it show focus on the interns or a new hospital?  What is known for now is Zach Braff and Sarah Chalke will be in six episodes, while other cast members Donald Faison, Neil Flynn and John C. McGinley await word if their pilots on shows that they have filmed will be picked up by a network.  But if anything, season eight of ""Scrubs"" did a good job of showcasing the interns and with the web episodes, giving us an even more in-depth look at the characters personalities.  All this is included on this Blu-ray release.

For fans of ""Scrubs"", this one is a no-brainer.  A must buy and most definitely, highly recommended!",1258502400,22,14330,4.677354709418838

3823312,2,B001VPJYZ0,"Look, I love Scrubs more than anyone. I think I have watched every episode from Season 1-Season 6 about three or four times each. With that said. the show finally became unwatchable to me in Season 8. The new cast of interns was just not interesting to me at all. The jokes were poorly done and all the original characters lost their edge. I think they should have wrapped up the show after Season 6. Instead of fabricating some drawn-out, aukward ending, the uncertainty with what happened next with JD and Elliott and their life-changing decisions would have been an in intriguing way to end the show. But as with most popular shows, they milked two more seasons (7 and 8) and possibly another one(9)! If you are thinking about buying season 8, my recommendation would be to instead buy the early seasons (if god forbid you haven't yet!) and stick with those. Season 8 is just too aukward and forced, and really isn't funny at all like the show was in its first 6 seasons.

POW!

I also have issues with Bill Lawrence saying ""we'll be back in a minute"" before ad breaks during the commentaries. There's no freaking ad break on the DVD Bill. There's no fake break to recreate the TV environment either. The commentary conversation carries right on across. Enough is enough!

3823330,5,B001VPJYZ0,"From the beginning Scrubs has always been funny. Scrubs has also forayed, quite successfully--time and again--into dramatic moments. And as much as I've loved the show since it began, last season was a huge disappointment. So it was with a heavy heart I commensed my viewing of season eight.

Surprisingly enough though, Scrubs has dug back to its roots and has come back better than ever. Is it only because they truly embrace and combine the drama and comedy seamlessly now (finally)? Probably.

As much as I didn't want to be surprised that this season was incredibly good, I was. Everything is how it was before as far as the characters go in addition to a few new interns that continually play a farely large part throughout the season. The only thing different with the eighth go-round is that main characters always are noticeably absent. Even the show's main character, JD, is gone technically two episodes (Elliot talks to him on the phone in one episode). Carla is only in a handful of episodes, and it goes for everyone. That's kinda disheartening, but even when someone is gone you don't notice it immediately.

Big changes in the show are (POSSIBLE SPOILERS) that Dr. Cox is now the Chief of Medicine, JD and Elliot are back together, Turk and Carla are having a second baby, the Janitor gets married, Ted gets a girlfriend, Bob and Dr. Cox are now friends, and as we learn on the finale, the retired Bob Kelso decides to return to medicine. Not to forget Kim (Elizabeth Banks) and Sean (Scott Foley) are now dating. So a lot goes on this season and it's all handled so well.

Bonus features, as with every Scrubs release, are a big draw. Just a ton of episode commentary (which I'm not normally a big fan of but it's always funny with Scrubs). Awesome webisodes--deemed 'Interns'--a mini season of a handful of 4 minute-ish episodes following the new interns, which is great because this batch of interns is so likeable. Not to mention the staples of alternate lines and deleted scenes which still, to this day, are so great. LET'S NOT FORGET THE TRIUMPHANT RETURN OF THE GAG REEL! This time we don't have to search high and low for them.

Season eight really wraps up every loose end there is...and it's wrapped up in such a way that it really makes you smile when all is said and done. It's been eight seasons full of ups and downs but it really goes out on top this time. Highly recommended.",1252281600,2,2408,4.603729603729604

3823334,5,B001VPJYZ0,"""Scrubs"", the popular medical comedy series which has been a staple on the NBC television network since 2001 but chose not to renew the show and drawing ire from the dedicated fans.  Fortunately, the series was  immediately picked up by ABC for its eighth season.

The longtime comedy series was created by Bill Lawrence (""Spin City"", ""Clone High"" and ""Cougar Town"") and is a medical comedy series which takes place at Sacred Heart Hospital and focuses on the life of Dr. John J.D. Dorian (Zach Braff, ""Garden State"", ""The Last Kiss"").  J.D. has an imaginative mind, thus you often see things through his perspective and what he is saying to himself internally.  He works with his off-and-on again girlfriend Dr. Elliot Reed (Sarah Chalke, ""Clone High"", ""Roseanne"" and ""Nothing Too Good for a Cowboy"") who has a similar sense of humor as him, his best friend Dr. Christopher Turk (Donald Faison, ""The Boondocks"", ""Robot Chicken"") and Turk's wife Nurse Carla Espinosa (Judy Reyes, ""Third Watch"", ""The Passion"").  And at the workplace, J.D. must put up with Dr. Perry Cox (""Any Given Sunday"", ""Stealing Harvard"", ""Office Space"") who seems to not like him and the unusual janitor (Neil Flynn, ""The Middle"", ""Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull"").

With this eighth season, the season will be the final season focusing on the character of Dr. John ""J.D."" Dorian and also included on the DVD are the web episodes of ""Scrubs: Interns"" which was shown on abc.com.  The eighth season focuses on J.D.'s relationship with Dr. Elliott Reed, working with their new interns but also J.D. leaving Sacred Heart Hospital.

VIDEO & AUDIO:

""Scrubs"" is presented with an aspect ration of 1:33:1.  The series is pretty much shot in a hospital but lighting is well-done and there are occasional outdoor scenes.  The two episodes ""My Soul on Fire"" is filmed at the Bahamas (Abacos) and definitely is a major change in pace for the series.  Of course, picture quality for those two episodes alone are quite different as you see the beautiful ocean and scenery of Hopetown.  Otherwise the series looks good and doesn't looked aged or overly compressed.

Audio for ""Scrubs"" is in Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound.  For the most part, the series is a dialogue-driven series.  So, most of the audio is front and center channel driven.  I personally found it much more appealing by having the series set at stereo on all channels on my receiver but for the most part, dialogue is clear and understandable.

Subtitles are in English SDH, French and Spanish.

JUDGMENT CALL:

I personally feel that it was a blessing for ABC to pick up ""Scrubs"".  With NBC struggling in the past few years with its sitcoms or comedy shows, the move to ABC definitely gave ""Scrubs"" that synergy.  The move to the new network felt right and courtesy of Disney, episodes such as ""My Soul on Fire"" which was shot in the Bahamas would have never happened in the past.  So, it was definitely fun to watch the eighth season.

I think that the season was created with the thought that there would be no ninth season and thus the episodes were created as if it was a final farewell and a nod to dedicated fans who have watched every season of the comedy series.  ""Scrubs"" definitely was a series that will always be remembered, especially as more and more medical dramas continue to air on television, it was nice to see a show parody that and characters that remain as hilarious as they were when the series first started.  With the addition of the interns, it definitely brought something new to the series and I think with abc.com trying to create that viral promotion with ""Scrubs: Interns"" was also good planning and helped viewers enjoy these new characters along with the characters that we have watched for nearly a decade.

As for the DVD, ""Scrubs - The Complete Eighth Season"" is magnificent.  Not only were all episodes just hilarious and fun, they really went all out in providing a ton of special features.  I wasn't expecting 16 audio commentaries and the ""Scrubs: Interns"" inclusion on the DVD was awesome.  Personally, I felt that they were expecting this final season to be the last and so, they went all out with the special features.  So, this season DVD set will definitely keep ""Scrubs"" fans busy for many hours and suffice to say, fans will get their money's worth with this release.  Absolutely awesome!

With the news that there will be a ninth season of ""Scrubs"", It will be interesting to see what direction the series will go.  Will it show focus on the interns or a new hospital?  What is known for now is Zach Braff and Sarah Chalke will be in six episodes, while other cast members Donald Faison, Neil Flynn and John C. McGinley await word if their pilots on shows that they have filmed will be picked up by a network.  But if anything, season eight of ""Scrubs"" did a good job of showcasing the interns and with the web episodes, giving us an even more in-depth look at the characters personalities.  All this is included on this DVD set.

For fans of ""Scrubs"", this one is a no-brainer.  A must buy and most definitely, highly recommended!",1251244800,5,13162,4.6559373640713355
3823335,2,B001VPJYZ0,"This was a season which returned much closer to the quality of the earlier seasons but that is not what the review will cover.

After 7 years of being aired 1.33:1 full frame while their brethren on NBC were upgraded to High-Def, scrubs finally began airing in 16:9 widescreen on ABC during it's Eighth season. If you picked up this DVD you wouldn't think that because the season is not in it's Original Aspect Ratio of 16:9, but once again in a dreary 1.33:1 full frame. This far into the lifespan of DVD there is NO EXCUSE for releasing a title outside of its OAR.  It would appear this is some manner of underhanded ploy to force people to buy the Blu-ray in order to watch this season as intended, and I am very disappointed.",1251158400,38,729,4.392592592592592
3823336,5,B001VPJYZ0,"i thought the final season of scrubs was great. I felt it got off on a rocky start but started to pick up around episode 5 or 6 and thats when it started to really get funny and started feeling like scrubs again. I would have liked the season to have been a little longer because when JD said he would be leaving in a month,it came too near the end of the season and i felt they rushed it a little bit and thats why i wish it could have been a longer season. I like that they did get to wrap things up and the show did end on a good note. I liked how they ended the series,it was a really good final episode. Yes it,s true that scrubs is coming back,but they really sould,t call it season 9 because it,s more of a spin off type of show. it will be called scrubs but they will be adding a subtitle to it to let fans and new fans know it,s a brand new show.",1250294400,,855,3.808988764044944

Years ago I remember Ted Danson talking about ending Cheers while it was on top, then Jerry Seinfeld doing the same with his show and I always felt somehow cheated, wanting ""one more season.""  After watching this season of Scrubs I now appreciate where they were coming from. This season was utter crap. The writing was horrible, the actors seemed bored and I applaud NBC for dropping this dead show.

The ""new"" characters are pathetic imitations of whats already been done.",1243555200,10,506,4.929411764705883
3823338,4,B001VPJYZ0,"Warning!  Some spoilers ahead!

Although the past few seasons SCRUBS had descended slightly from the levels it had achieved in its first few brilliant seasons, its final season managed to recover afair amount of its previous charm.  Buoyed by several new interns there was some fresh blood in the cast and there were a lot of nice storylines to keep the interest up.  There was an expected resolution of JD and Elliott's story.  And we even sorta, kinda learned (maybe) the Janitor's name (Tony).

There is some talk that there might be either a Season Nine of SCRUBS, with significant cast changes.  But I hope that doesn't take place.  Better to have a show go away with some gas in the tank than have it continue on fumes.

Season 8 saw a lot of major changes.  With Bob Kelso gone and no longer head of surgery, Perry Cox becomes the new head of Sacred Heart.  Ted actually finds a girlfriend (a ukulele abusing one to boot).  Turk becomes chief of surgery while he and Carla expect their second child.  And Janitor finds a woman of his own (known as ""Lady"") and gets married.  But the biggest changes involve JD and Elliott.  They get back together and unlike in the past, JD doesn't panic at all, but instead delights in being with her, even embracing all her eccentricities.  And the final big change involves JD leaving Sacred Heart so that he can live closer to his son (with Elliott sneakily moving in with him by slowly sneaking her stuff into his place).  The series began with JD preparing for his first day at Sacred Heart and the series ends with him leaving.  And in a cameo that puts one in mind of J. Michael Straczynski's showing up at the end of BABYLON 5 and Ron Moore popping up at the very end of BATTLESTAR GALACTICA, SCRUBS' creator Bill Lawrence shows up in the final scene.

I'm going to miss this show.  At its best it was one of the most refreshing, inventive comedies on TV.  Even at its worst it was at least enjoyable.  I'll miss all the characters and I'll even miss Sacred Heart itself.  They actually bought a closing hospital in which to film the show and house the production company offices.  The result was a feeling of concreteness and reality that none of the dramatic hospital series on TV could fully match, wedded as they were to sets rather than locations.  The Sacred Heart grounds were something that they had complete access to, rather than something that they just visited.  The cars on the lot were probably those of the actors and production crew.  The whole show just seemed at home.

The good news is that we got eight whole seasons.  This translates in to lots of DVDs that we can watch and rewatch.  The show has ended but it won't really be going away.

Note -- May 15:  Well, looks like SCRUBS is going to be back in Season Nine.  Though it looks like it won't be quite the same show.  Zach Braff and Sarah Chalke will be back for six episodes to provide a transition to new doctors (the interns of Season Eight?) to take center stage on the show.  Donald Faison (Turk--though, do we really want Turk without JD?--having Turk go on without JD would seem to belie the joined-at-the-hip mythology of the past 8 years), John C. McGinley (Cox), and Neil Flynn (Janitor) will be back if their new pilots aren't picked up, and I assume the rest of the cast will be back.  But I'm not terribly excited at this point about SCRUBS without JD, Elliott, and Turk-on-his-own-without-JD.  But I'll give it a try.  Also, it undercuts what was a near perfect finale episode.  Too bad that won't be the series finale.",1241913600,27,3558,4.508607198748043
3823339,5,B001VPJYZ0,"Quality has been hard to come by on television over the last eight years.  It has often felt to me that Scrubs was the last great thing on TV.  Funny, endearing, and able to get to your heart, Scrubs is one of the best sitcoms in the history of television.

Season eight was no exception.  The writers and producers made all the right decisions throughout the season and made it one of the best.  Bill Lawrence and crew figured out the best direction for all the characters to go in while also making the interns more entertaining than they had been for years.  The final episode (""My Finale"") is the best show closer, if it is the end, that I have ever seen.  They struck a fine balance and also came up with an imaginative way to show what the future might hold for the show's characters.

There has been talk that Scrubs may return in some form next year.  I wouldn't be opposed to it, though they have a lot to live up to.  It'd be nice to occasionally see JD drop in, as a suspect they'd try to line up guest spots with the original cast.  I doubt anyone from the original cast would return, though John McGinley might as Dr. Cox.  I would love to see Kelso back as well, but I doubt Judy Reyes, Donald Faison, and all will be back.  The interns from this season showed some promise.  I guess we'll have to wait and see.
