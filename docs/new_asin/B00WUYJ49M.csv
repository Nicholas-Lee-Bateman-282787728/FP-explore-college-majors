7154591,5,B00WUYJ49M,I have been using this series for a small group Bible Study and discussion. I highly recommend this to any group wanting learn and to explore Bible Prophecy.,1444435200,2,157,4.642857142857143
7154592,5,B00WUYJ49M,"I have thoroughly enjoyed this series, and I have gotten so much out of it!  It gives you a BALANCED idea of what the end-times ""could be"".

I remember that Jay advises us to not look at ""This is That"", as we travel through the book of Revelation.  We can make some educated guesses for sure, but until the Lord reveals all things to us, we are to remain diligent and love those who are lost.

Jay has enlightened me about so many things.  A treasure to have in the my library -",1444348800,8,478,4.096774193548387
7154593,5,B00WUYJ49M,"Why did I wait so long to order this?  If you ever wanted to understand Revelations, this is the perfect way to get it done. My husband and  I are glued to the t.v. every night soaking up the truth. Invest in your everlasting life and make this purchase. Don't forget to share it. Spread the Gospel!

7154594,5,B00WUYJ49M,"It is a challenge to discuss the depth of the Book of Revelation at a spectrum that reaches into the imagination of the the novice, covers the scope of the skeptic, and at a detailed level that satisfies even the most scholarly critic. And yet, Decoding the Future manages to do just that. Part classroom exposition, part itinerate journey; this series explores the prophetic content found in the final book of the Bible in a way that offers insights past any Sunday school lesson you've seen and will leave you with a thirst to discover even more of what God has for us in his word.

Looking to discover the cultural diversity of the Biblical era? Looking to explore the important literary features in a foundational text? Fascinated by the exciting, and often troubling, times in which we live? Look no further than Decoding the Future. It will not answer every question you have about the Bible and the end times described within. But it will absolutely equip you for the journey that will take you there.",1484697600,,1008,4.694915254237288
7154595,5,B00WUYJ49M,"This set of teachings on the book of Revelation gives excellent insight from a Middle Eastern perspective, in which there's not many studies from that viewpoint. Many commentaries get bogged down in opinions and speculations which fade with time. Not so with this study. My advice as a pastor is for anyone who would like a more simple and easy to understand look at the Revelation given to the Apostle John, this is an absolute must for any library! Most importantly, you will be filled with a much more deeper and fuller knowledge and understanding of what they thought, and what they knew...

Jay McCarl is an excellent teacher and makes this study a must for those who want an accurate, informative and fascinating way to study what God's Word says about the End Times. The photography really makes you feel like you have been there . I highly recommend this DVD set!",1484697600,,330,4.516666666666667

7154598,5,B00WUYJ49M,Brent Miller has filmed a top notch and lengthy lecture by a gifted teacher on the Book of Revelation in this DVD set.

7154602,5,B00WUYJ49M,"Discussions of the meaning of the section ""Book of Revelations"" from the Bible interspersed with footage from visits in the Near East. Access to the website for additional materials is a further resource for those interested in this subject. The only downside is that fact the number of discs could be reduced in view of the capacity of blu-ray discs but from a cost point of view would necessitate the re-jigging of the prologues, menus etc compared with DVD version. Also would have preferred that the box containing discs should be blu-ray standard and not DVD case.",1482537600,8,569,4.876288659793815

7154609,3,B00WUYJ49M,"This is a nice presentation for beginners, but I was hopping for a more advanced revelation because of the inflated previews.  There is just too much promotion, even during the lessons.  If you don't know anything, or are afraid of tacking the Book of Revelations, then watch this.  It will set your mind at ease for you to go ahead and find more material to study.  It certainly will give you a desire to look at the rest of the Bible for interpretation, which is the way it should be, let the  Bible interpret itself.",1464739200,17,519,4.421052631578948

7154611,4,B00WUYJ49M,It was informative and well presented,1464048000,,37,5.333333333333333
7154612,2,B00WUYJ49M,$160 for a series of lectures? No way is it worth that kind of money. The advertisement that promotes on-sight visits to places mentiioned in Revelation basically pertains to the sites of the seven churches and I found that disappointing. Jay McCarl is a good lecturer but not at the cost that I paid for this set. Sorry to be so critical of a Brother in Christ but I felt cheated in the end.,1462579200,9,392,4.3108108108108105
7154613,5,B00WUYJ49M,This was an awesome and educational seris. A group of friends got together and watched this. There was 9 of us and we are all at different levels in our walks with Jesus as well as educational background. These videos were easy to understand. We are now Jay McCarl fans.,1462492800,,270,4.42
7154614,5,B00WUYJ49M,"Decoding the Future is an amazing teaching on the book of Revelation.  It connects first century culture to what was written and makes Revelation understandable.  This study removes many of the ""mysteries"" and ""unknowns,"" and allows us to see more of what Jesus revealed to John the apostle.  John understood what Jesus showed him and so did the people of the first century; now we can understand it as well.  Understanding the Revelation of Jesus Christ.... it doesn't get any better than that.  Our Lord wants us to know who He is, what to look for, and what is coming; and He invites us to learn.  We don't have to just settle for speculation on the book of Revelation.",1462233600,4,672,4.605042016806722
7154615,5,B00WUYJ49M,"This is a very well done study of the Book of Revelation.
I am a pastor and I recommend this study to anyone who want to understand and study Revelation.
It is very organized and teaches proper Biblical interpretation skills.
It is very clear and removes any confusion regarding prophecy.
This study will remove any fear around studying prophecy.",1462147200,3,346,4.88135593220339
7154616,5,B00WUYJ49M,"I am a pastor and I have been studying the book of Revelation for many years. This book has some incredible challenges for so many and I am glad to say that the material Pastor Jay has presented in this DVD set is worth the investment of your time. Even though I am very familiar with this book I found myself absorbed in the teaching discovering and seeing things that I had not seen before. What impressed me about the ""Decoding the Future"" series is that it is set up on the one hand  for someone who has absolutely no knowledge of the book of Revelation where it  will open one's understanding to a book that has been closed for so many  and on the other hand for the person who wants a deeper understanding of God's incredible word to his saints where  it will challenge a person to plumb the depths of God incredible message to his saints.",1461888000,2,845,4.29559748427673
7154617,5,B00WUYJ49M,"This really is a must see and an excellent resource for home groups/Bible studies. Jay has a wonderful gift for teaching and keeps you captivated from start to finish.
The film of him visiting the 7 churches in Revelation helps drive the truths home and the wisdom, explanations and knowledge imparted will open this wonderful, blessed book up to you in a way I'm sure you won't have experienced before.
My Pastor is very wary of Revelation and End Times teaching and even he said how pleasantly surprised he was! Praise indeed!",1461888000,3,528,4.75
7154618,5,B00WUYJ49M,Opens your mind and builds your faith.  A truly mind blowing experience.  I would recommend this to beginners and those that think they've heard it all.,1461801600,2,152,4.8076923076923075
7154619,5,B00WUYJ49M,"It is the most astonishing of anything I have ever seen or heard of. You have not read the book of Revelation
until you have had it explained like it is done here. it is more than seven DVD it is a hole school on the Bible.
But it concentrates on the Book of Revelations.",1461801600,11,271,3.9454545454545453
7154620,5,B00WUYJ49M,"I lived for many years in San Jose, CA, where the Winchester Mystery House has baffled generation after generation with its stairwells that go nowhere and doors that open upon impassable walls. Many who read the book of Revelation go away thinking they have just taken a tour of the Winchester Mystery House. So many lines of thought seem to go nowhere and so many doors that the apostle John opens seem to open upon things and events that defy understanding. ""Decoding the Future"" is the floor plan of the book of Revelation. I appreciate Pastor Jay McCarl's presentation of the book of Revelation. This isn't a pulpit series that has been captured on film and then bundled together and marketed as an afterthought. This series is designed to be fast-paced, yet in-depth multi-media experience as it takes the traveler through the labyrinths of Revelation. What at first read seems impenetrable becomes clear and understandable in the hands of a trained guide. Let Pastor Jay decode the future and unlock the meaning of the book of Revelation for you. It will be time well spent.

Although I am, and have been, a student of prophecy for a number of years, there is always more that can be learned, gleaned, and more insight from others.
