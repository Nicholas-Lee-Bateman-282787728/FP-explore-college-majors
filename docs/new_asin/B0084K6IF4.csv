5131770,4,B0084K6IF4,"It's been 9 years since director Lawrence Kasdan put out a film, the last being DREAMCATCHER. More than that if you can remember the type of film he is best known for, an ensemble piece that captures the essence of what being human is all about. His classic THE BIG CHILL is but a forgotten memory to some and unknown to a new generation of movie goers. But Kasdan has always excelled at these ensemble pieces and it's nice to see him in true form with DARLING COMPANION.

Many will look at the box for this release and think it is nothing more than another animal picture. That does set the stage for this tale but it isn't the main ingredient. Diane Keaton plays Beth, the mother of one daughter Ellie (Lindsay Sloane) who's moved her family to New York and another Grace (Elisabeth Moss) who's in school. After dropping Ellie off at the airport while driving home, Beth tells Grace to stop the car on the freeway. There, they find a wounded and lost dog that they take home. While Beth's husband Joseph (Kevin Kline) insists the dog isn't staying time passes and it's a year later.

While the family has grown accustomed to the dog, now named Freeway, a new change is about to kick in. Grace is about to marry the veterinarian they took the dog to when they first found him. The wedding is in the family vacation home on Colorado and goes smoothly. New characters are introduced including Joseph's sister Penny (Dianne Wiest) and her new boyfriend Russell (Richard Jenkins) and housekeeper Carmen (Ayelet Zurer). They are the last remaining guests for the night after the wedding as well as Penny's son and Joseph's fellow back surgeon Bryan (Mark Duplas).

With the intent of staying just a few days it all changes when during Joseph loses Freeway while taking him for a walk. Having not taken along the dog's whistle and losing him while talking on his cell phone (something he does constantly), Beth blames him for the loss of the dog which has taken on an extreme amount of importance to her over the past year. Joseph thinks she's over reacting to the dog's loss and that he will come home. Beth thinks Joseph is unfeeling and just wants to ignore his personal responsibilities.

All hands join in in the search for Freeway. Things get a bit more interesting when Carmen reveals she is of gypsy descent and has the ability to ""see things"". Following the clues she offers them, each member of the group is paired off and the search goes forward. Along the way each of these characters gets to know the other a little better. Bryan gets to know Russell a bit more as he tries to decide if the man is just after his mother's pension in hopes of building a pub. Bryan and Carmen get close as well. Penny and Russell show that theirs is perhaps the closest relationship in the group. And Beth and Joseph are forced to look back at the choices they've made through the years and to discover that love that they once shared long ago. Has it died or was it simply misplaced over the years?

Kasdan has always done a great job with ensemble pieces like this. Both THE BIG CHILL and GRAND CANYON are works that bring together a cast of characters and have them intertwine throughout the story being told, coming together and moving apart, discovering who they really are and who the others around them are and finally realizing the things that are truly important to each of them.

Kids of the MTV generation that want answers and want them in five minutes will have a difficult time with this movie. There are no neat and tidy summations in the first 5 minutes or within the first hour of the film. Instead we watch the characters mingle back and forth until the end of the film when the search for Freeway ends either in his loss or discovery. But then to tell you what happens would be to create the worst spoiler ever.

Well made and well thought out, this film entertains from start to finish. And above all is some of the best acting around. Keaton remains a fantastic actress and looks amazing. Kline in his sixth film with Kasdan turns in an effortless performance. And the rest of the cast falls in line with these two leads to offer totally believable characters.

This is not an action film, a horror film or a teen comedy. This is a movie about real people with real problems who find themselves after having tucked away emotions and ideas for some period of time. As the characters reveal themselves so does the story. It's nice to see a film take the time to speak rather than rush everything.",1346112000,55,4505,4.512254901960785
5131771,5,B0084K6IF4,"Beth and Joseph are in an empty marriage, along with an empty nest. Beth rescues a wounded dog near the highway, and develops a special bond with the dog. Her husband loses the dog, and Beth becomes distraught and upset as she forms a frantic search. In the process and unexpected,different people meet and various couples are in desperate need of healing. The intriguing story portrays relationships, love,and loss. Some are on the verge of divorce, others feel empty, and some are looking for soul-mates. Acting Performance of entire cast is Excellent, the story is heartfelt, and the movie entertains from start to finish. The adorable dog is an added attraction, and the setting is perfect. An enjoyable summer movie. Refreshing, and Highly Recommended!",1345248000,40,757,5.112903225806452
5131772,4,B0084K6IF4,"Ok, I've seen the low reviews for this movie.  And if I could give it 31/2 stars I would.  But what a nice change of pace it makes!  It's a warm, intimate movie with a truly wonderful ensemble cast, a cute dog and a gorgeous setting. What's not to like? There are some subplots, but the gist of the movie is that Diane Keaton (Beth) and Kevin Kline (Joseph) are in an empty marriage. She rescues a wounded dog near the freeway, and he loses it on a walk while he's on his cell phone as usual, which brings their tension to a head. Diane Weist and Richard Jenkins, lovers whose relationship worries the others, help in the search, along with her son. The part gypsy housekeeper keeps pairing them up in certain ways and telling them her visions of what they are to search for, but what they are really seeking is to understand each other. And that is the heart of the movie.  It is obviously geared for boomers (is that its great sin?), and has some humorous references to growing older which are easily relatable.  If you're tired of comic book heroes, vampires, and grossout comedies, and want to see a gentle, feel-good little charmer, give it a chance.  And thank you Lawrence Kasdan!",1340841600,212,1187,4.447004608294931
5131773,3,B0084K6IF4,"Have I seen this movie before? An unexpected event brings together various couples in need of healing and reconciliation. They eat, drink, argue and endure a trauma. At the end, they emerge healed and strong. In ""Darling Companion,"" the precipitating event is the finding of a wounded dog on the side of highway by frazzled wife Diane Keaton. Her husband, uptight surgeon Kevin Kline, doesn't want the dog. Their daughter (Mad Men's Elisabeth Moss) falls for the Indian veterinarian. A wedding and hilarity ensue after the newlyweds head off for their honeymoon and the dog (cutely called ""Freeway"") goes AWOL. Having swept the film clear of all but the warring couples, the time is ripe to hatch the various crises and problems that will show the couples How Much They Love Each Other. It's a great formula, and was good for a few laughs. Kevin Kline's depiction of the hyper-rational (and hugely wrong) male was spot on, a a little too familiar. Keaton was at her dizzy best. Diane Wiest (as Kline's lovelorn sister) brought the film a grounding in true romance.

The only curiosity for the all-white cast was the odd insertion of throwaway ethnic characters into the mix. The vet's family was Indian, but aside from adding colorful costumes to the wedding, added nothing to the plot. A airplane pilot was black and female, but could have been any race without affecting the story. And a caretaker (the love interest of Kline's surgeon nephew) was a half-Romany (i.e., Gypsy) clairvoyant whose ever-wrong visions seemed the only thing propelling the plot.

""Darling Companion"" was a rawhide bone of a movie -- fun to gnaw on for an hour or two, but ultimately unnutritious.",1340496000,8,1675,4.894366197183099

I couldn't wait for it to be over and stupidly watched to the end, hoping something good would happen to make me even like it, let alone love it.  It never happened.  The acting is less than up to par, but perhaps it's the lack of content in the story that makes it so.  The gypsy woman was almost too much to bear.  Maybe it's me, but I thought this movie was a real ""dog"" and disappointment, given what I expect normally from these actors.",1486252800,,596,4.139130434782609

At first glance, found myself wondering..why the Diane character had so deep an attachment to the dog. As the story unfolded, however, I stopped caring why she did, and fell in love with the way finding the dog, drew the family together.  Introducing an honest and kind Gypsy psychic, and the humorous way, 5 adult, rational people embraced her and her effort to help, was refreshing.",1477872000,7,654,4.620689655172414

Many of the actors over-acted, but that's probably because they could do little else with such poor dialogue.

I love this movie. I even saw this on the big screen in New York. Daddy was nice enough for mum and I to go see it because New York was my sister's birthday present. I'd like to go back to New york so that I'd spot Kevin and feel like I'm living Happily ever after again. I love Kevin with all my heart. I see this movie from a whole new perspective. We lost our dog a couple times but at least it's not a frantic search. It's not one of those dog movies where the dog gets lost and then the dog dies. Each time I look at this, it made me think of when I got to meet Kevin as an early birthday present just days before it was released in selected theaters. But it also made me think of when I did a lot of research by watching interviews, listening to podcasts, etc. The scene where Freeway chased a deer, that showed me why it's important to keep your dog on a leash. Some scenes made me think of when I was listening to a commentary. It surprised and still surprises me to see Larry and Meg making their cameos in this. I admire Lawrence since Silverado for 6 years (as of May 2009). Then it grew stronger and stronger over the next couple of years. My #1 favorite movie director. In the past I get a little scared when I see Kevin get hurt or die on screen. But then after I stopped playing with my dolls, I don't worry a lot about that. It's been since December 19th 2008 that I admired Richard Jenkins. (Though I did see him first in Cheaper by the Dozen.)",1385337600,,1631,4.021538461538461

5131981,3,B0084K6IF4,"For the life of me I can't remember why I wanted to watch this movie.  I suspect the cast had me intrigued.  It certainly couldn't have been because of favorable reviews as the film has been blasted by both critics and theater goers (grossed < $1 million).  So let me provide a tepid defense of the film.

The story centers on a well-to-do couple and their family.  Diane Keaton plays Beth and is married to a back surgeon, Joseph - not Joe - (Kevin Kline).  Beth is out with her daughter Grace (Elisabeth Moss) when they spot a large dog on a hill next to the freeway.  Circling back, they warm up to the dog, take him to a hunky vet (Jay Ali) and get him fixed up.  Named Freeway, the dog is a great companion to Beth and Joseph, essentially has come to tolerate the dog.  As long as he doesn't interfere with his medical practice.

The family gathers at their second home, a ski lodge near Denver, for the wedding of Grace who yep, marries the vet that fixed up Freeway.  While taking a walk with Joseph, Freeway gets away chasing after a deer and cannot be found.  The reality is that Freeway is just an excuse for Lawrence Kasdan, who directed and co-wrote the script with his wife Meg, to let the grown-ups come together and solve their marital issues.  In addition to Beth and Joseph, others in the collective must come to grips with each other as well.

There's Joseph's sister Penny (Dianne Wiest) who is about to marry gadfly Russell (Richard Jenkins) much to the dismay of her son and Joseph's nephew and medical partner Bryan (Mark Duplass).  Bryan gets a fix on the housekeeper, Carmen (Ayelet Zurer) who is a gypsy and seer.  Then there is Sam Shepard as the local bumpkin sheriff.

Now make no mistake, this isn't a great movie.  It is ponderously slow at times.  There is no question as to the outcome.  And there are ridiculous events and circumstances that make absolutely no sense.  But then again, there is just enough humor, warmth to make it palatable.  And it's fun to watch talented actors take marginal material and make something out of it.  I suspect this film will find an audience on disc.

I have no complaints about the Blu ray transfer that I watched.  The 1080p resolution comes with an aspect ratio of 2.35:1 and it looks tremendous.  Great shots of the mountains, woods and blue sky are really well done.  I could see no problem with the images and the detail is sharp and clear.  The audio likewise is very good with the DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 options.  Many scenes are outdoors and the sound is very effective.  Here are the bonus features on the Blu ray:

5131982,4,B0084K6IF4,"This highly appealing ensemble cast, all interacting with each other, brings me back to writer-director Lawrence Kasdan's ""The Big Chill"".  It was while viewing that film that I first fell in love with this type of movie, along with the personal stamp he adds to it.  Bring out the 'baby boomers' ...

Beth Winter (Diane Keaton) and her daughter Grace discover a wounded dog along the freeway and quickly stop getting it help.  After learning that the Animal Control Dept. would only ""put him down"", the two women are upset and take him on to the vet. Of course, Beth does end up taking the 7 yr old dog home and naming him ""Freeway"" immediately ... At first, her husband, Joseph (Kevin Kline), balks at the idea then slowly complies realizing his wife's obvious attachment.

""The Thing Called Love"" (Bonnie Raitt) plays out from the soundtrack as the family starts to fall in love with Freeway and meshes with their new pet.  The movie quickly skips ahead one year to the couple's vacation home in Colorado.  Their daughter marries the vet that got Freeway back into shape and a whole cast of interesting characters enters the scene.  The scenery in Colorado is gorgeous, lush, and colorful. Photography (Michael McDonough) of this beautiful area could not be better represented.  Everything to the slightest detail comes alive and breathes life into the couples that stay behind at their home after the wedding day.

Joseph's sister, Penny (Dianne Wiest), brings along her new love interest, Russell (Richard Jenkins).  Along with them is her son Bryan (Mark Duplass), a fellow surgeon along with Joseph.  A very intuitive person added to the cast is the insightful caretaker of the vacation home, Carmen (Ayelet Zurer - ""Hide Away"").  Shortly after everyone is there, Joseph unintentionally loses Freeway while taking him out on a walk.  The entire group gets together, in many ways, and outsources to find the dog.  The sheriff (Sam Shepard) of the town is also sought out to help and adds his own regional flavor to the search party.

This is a simple set up for this plot, as the movie does stay relatively uncomplicated and that is exactly why I liked it so well.  There are several other interests like the couple's now 'empty-nest' marriage which has become too ordinary for them.  It is obvious that Beth and Joseph love each other very much after all these years and need a new connection for themselves as a couple.  Some focus is unto the subplots if you will, although the major portion of the movie is concentrated on finding this dog and a soul seeking quest to return him home.  Beth is so emotionally tied to Freeway and is heartbroken by him being lost.  Their relationship represents so many things about her life in a much fuller sense.

The people all taking stake in getting Freeway returned are also taking their own personal journeys at this time in their lives. Full of self-reflection, this is a highly emotional story in parts. One that doesn't beg its own attention and also any animal lover would appreciate this lovely story.  Done with nothing offensive; I think that this would make an age-appropriate 'family movie' ... Personally, I loved it!",1371945600,13,3177,4.810313075506445

5131984,2,B0084K6IF4,"What we have here is an outstanding ensemble of actors who agreed to be in what must be one of the most boring movies ever to grace the silver screen.
I purchased this DVD assuming abet naively that there would be a dog in the movie.
Yes my friends, a mixed breed canine makes what I would refer to as a cameo appearance at the films beginning and for a mere moment at the end. The dog appears to have a lot of collie in it and is endearingly lovable looking. Lassie with polka dots on his snout.
With a cast that includes some of my favorite actors like Kevin Kline and Diane Keaton, and a superb group of supporting actors, you would assume that even sans dog it would be an engrossing comedy or comedy drama.
Hear me snore quite loudly. Watch me fight falling asleep. My eyelids are getting heavy. the frequency of my yawns increases with each scene. This film takes boredom and tedium to new highs or more aptly.... lows.
. The depth of despair for the pitiful viewer who keeps  hoping something....anything will happen to bring some life to the screenplay.
Alas, the entire film shows the actors searching for the dog. That's all they do.
The two leads have a marriage that seems rocky at best. Kevin Kline is a doctor preoccupied with his work and Diane Keaton feels alone and latches on to the stray dog she finds. It gives her the unconditional love and companionship lacking in her own marriage.
Two things would have helped save this movie. First, the dog aptly named Freeway, because that's where he was found, could have had more screen time.
Film Freeway wandering through the woods. Perhaps looking at houses and meeting people. He could chase a rabbit or run from a bear. There are limitless possible scenerios to put our canine friend in as he makes his way back home. Anything to bring some life to this disaster of a movie.
I will grant you the Colorado scenery was breathtaking. That and the dog were the only things That held merit in a film that was better left on the cutting room floor.
A supposed psychic house keeper sees visions of the dog. The ensemble cast is excellent. It's a pity they have no good lines to say. Improvisation would have helped. Anything would be better than the lackluster script.

That's why she always has to have a lot of good actors and actresses supporting her in any movie she's in.  But it didn't help in this movie.  Richard Jenkins, Dianne Wiest & Sam Shepard were their usual, great actors/actress self, but not given any development of character.

I knew it would be wonderful as soon as I saw the actors in it and also who had wrritten it.  Lawrence Kasdan, who had written THE BIG CHILL so many years ago, seems to know how to portray real relationships in life and to make you care about the characters. Diane Keaton, Kevin Kline, Dianne Wiest, Richard Jenkins were all wonderfully connected to each other.

It has been panned by many critics, and the negative reaction reminds me of the ""Capracorn"" label critics gave It's a Wonderful Life when it came out.  Darling Companion is a bit corny, and it is a sentimental movie.  It also has a strong performance by Diane Keaton, a great affection for human (and pet) relationships, and a refreshing take on rational versus spiritual perspectives on reality.

5132061,3,B0084K6IF4,This film would have been so much better if there had been more chemistry between Diane Keaton and Kevin Kline. Both are very good in their roles...just not together. Maybe Robert De Niro or even Sam Shepard (who has a pitifully small role in the film) might have been better choices. There is very little character development before the 'crisis' occurs that makes up the cause or the story of the film. Dianne Wiest and Richard Jenkins demonstrate just what chemistry between two actors can mean...both are great.

5132066,1,B0084K6IF4,"My take on this movie is that Elizabeth Moss and the dog had the best outcomes - they were in it for 15 minutes each and didn't have to stick around for the other 90 minutes of this crapfest.

If the idea was to delve deeper into people's relationships in times of stress and loss, they failed miserably - especially Lawrence Kasdan.  It's hard to imagine that three of these stars have four Academy Awards between them. All of them showed such a lack of talent or commitment that it was quite sad.  And yes, since ""Something's Got to Give"" - Diane Keaton has basically played the same character in every single movie.  It's a bore.

I'm guessing the dog actually ran away to get away from this sorry lot - and I'm also guessing he will be sorry he ever showed back up.",1347494400,2,769,4.3125

5132068,3,B0084K6IF4,"I found DARKLING COMPANION on AMAZON by accident. I was surprised that I had not heard of this recent film despite a wonderful all star cast. As someone active in animal rescue, I was really hooked by the fact the film was about a rescued dog and his affect on his new family. Well, that turned out to be true to a point.
There is a charm this film as Beth (Diane Keaton) and her daughter Grace,  played by Elizabeth Moss, rescue a dog from the side of the freeway. Beth's spinal surgeon husband Joseph (Kevin Kline)is not keen on having an addition to the family but everything falls into place. The dog is lovingly named FREEWAY but disappears in the Rockies while the family is celebrating a Grace's wedding at the family vacation home. There is no surprise in who Grace meets and marries. There really is not much of a rescued dog story here. Freeway is only the catalyst for the rest of the story.
Adding to mix is Dianne Wiest as Joseph's long-suffering sister Penny who has found love again. Her new love Russell is played by character actor Richard Jenkins. Completing the group is Sam Shephard as the local sheriff. It is delightful to see these ""baby boomer"" actors together in one film. DARLING COMPANION is full of visual splendor thanks to the gorgeous scenery. Unfortuanely the story is rather mediocre version of the mid-life crisis story expect our characters are more in a 2/3 life crisis as they are in their 60's. Joseph and Beth have a loving marriage that has become too routine.
Penny is a free-spirit haunted by the fact that her husband left her for another woman. Russell seems to be the man of her dreams but neither Joseph nor her son Bryan approve. Add in one more person, the beautiful and lovely Carmen (Ayelef Zurer), the young and mysterious caretaker of the vacation home who admits to being part gypsy and being able to ""see things."" Carmen becomes the glue that binds them all together as they search for Freeway.
We have a great cast in a mediocre film. It seems like Diane Keaton has been in some version of this story in countless movies. Even Carmen, the questionable psychic, could predict how this story will end. It is a pleasant enough film but so unfulfilling considering all the wonderful actors and Lawrence Kasdan as the writer/director.",1347235200,,2284,4.625615763546798
5132069,5,B0084K6IF4,"Legendary Director/Screenwriter, Lawrence Kasdan and his wife Meg have brought us a fantastic story about REAL people. The acting is fantastic too. Kevin Kline, Diane Keaton, Richard Jenkins, Dianne Wiest, Sam Shepard and ALL the other fantastic supporting characters weave a interesting story about aging, relationships and a darling rescue dog, Freeway. This film is a must see for those who care about people, animals and aging. Also some very touching messages about learning how to tolerate and change. It's a bit a tear-jerker with some fantastic performances. For an independent film shot in 31 days, I'm impressed. This is the kind of film we don't see much of anymore. It's filled with so much soul and humanity, and I highly recommend it. Also if you're a true dog lover, watch this film with your dog. My dog loves to watch TV. Everytime she sees another dog on TV, she runs up to the TV ready to play. A unique film filled with heart, humor, drama and interesting scenarios.",1347062400,,986,4.840236686390533
5132070,3,B0084K6IF4,"I should start by saying that I love to watch Diane Keaton and Kevin Kline as actors, and that plus the fact that this was supposed to be a movie about a dog drew me to watch it.  I liked the way losing the dog brought the family together, and the scenes with the dog were adorable, but at least 9/10 of the movie had to do with looking for the missing dog and working out prickly personal issues.  It got old pretty fast.  Had they made this more of a heartwarming comedy and less of a journey to self discovery, I would have loved it.  As it was, we saw very little of the dog, and every scene was basically a rehash of previous ones.  I only gave it a 3 because I loved the dog and the actors.",1346803200,,696,3.942857142857143

What's it about?
Beth (Diane Keaton) saves a bedraggled lost dog from the side of the freeway on a wintry day in Denver. Struggling with her distracted, self-involved husband Joseph (Kevin Kline) and an empty nest at home, Beth forms a special bond with the rescued animal.

What did I think?
Not the fastest moving film ever made, but it was a nice touching story.  It seems to be all about this stray dog, when in fact it was about a family healing itself through an outside source.  This movie is worth the rental, if you are in the mood for a quiet film with a good family element.",1346457600,,730,4.451127819548872

How a 20% rating on Rotten Tomatoes turns into an 80% rating on Amazon is the subject for a rant for the truly cynical. I think the better indicator is the budget-to-boxoffice ratio of 6%. Bad writing in every way. Completely inept. Pedestrian plot. No crisis. No denouement. No character development. Lack of sympathetic characters.
