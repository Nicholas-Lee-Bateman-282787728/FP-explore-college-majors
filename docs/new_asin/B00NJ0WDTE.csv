6657950,5,B00NJ0WDTE,"Border 3 has certainly grabbed my attention; it gave me a slap or two as a viewer, reminding me that this is indeed ""Ghost in the Shell"", just a very different 'Ghost in the Shell"". Kise has finally ventured into his own territory as a director. The story itself was great (including the very different ""romatic Motoko""), and is this installment's highlight.

First let me disclaim Motoko's romance in this OVA:
Yes Motoko has been portrayed with a romatic side, and a pretty hefty one at that. It takes up a good part of the film and is heavily intertwined with the story. But all of this has to be taken with a grain of salt. Sure we all know Motoko as a heroine full strategy and appeal with only a hint of emotion, but Kise's potrayal here in the Arise series predates all of SAC. Maybe this is what led to the Motoko we know. If you have not watched any of the franchise, each director (Oshii, Kamiyama and Kise) brings their own flavor. It's going to be different. I give kudos to director Kise for getting creative with both the characters and the story.

STORY - Plot-wise, the romance doesn't do too bad. It kicks off a bit unexplained, but turns out relatively genuine before the OVA is over. The story telling was EXACTLY what I was looking for; plot twists and intricate story that keeps you engaged, classic of SAC. No sense in explaining the actual story, but know that it involves heavy detective work, many twists and turns and less action (just like SAC).

CHARACTERS - Character development is brief but good. So is the voice acting as far as an untrained ear can tell. Togusa gets a special shout out. He was amazing, finally showcasing his detective skills and even impressing the Major.

ART/ANIMATION - Animation quality hasn't quite returned to the level of Border #1, but has not deteriorated. Action sequences were great, though very brief, and everything else in between average. The color pallette itself wasn't bland, but most of the foreground didn't have as much texturing or shading, like faces/clothing/vehicles were rendered with single colors. It's just enough to notice, not enough to be distracting.

CASE - Came with a nice art book, reel of film and some digital extras just like Border #1 and #2. For the digital extras, I was not able to go directly to them through any of the title/pop-up menus. So unless they are at the end of the entire film, the were no extras to speak of.
Audio - Japanese 5.1 No English
Subtitles - English & Japanese

OVERALL - Great film in my opinion, an improvement from the last installment. Definitely worth a watch, worth an Amazon Instant Video purchase, but Limited Edition purchase being pretty steep for anyone other than GitS fans.",1412553600,3,2707,4.652719665271967
6657951,5,B00NJ0WDTE,"Here's the thing. Great seller since part 3 of GITS Arise arrived in two days like promised. So I must give them a 5/5 for their awesomeness.

Now the movie. WTF???!!!!! Why did they change Major's character?! What an abomination to the Ghost in the Shell franchise! Why on earth would Major Kusanagi ever be so worried about an intimate relationship with a male character?! This was an extreme letdown to say the least. The Major seemed so weak willed and easily distracted in this movie. Arise pt 1 and 2 were great with a balance of plot and action; while deviating from SAC the stories, the directors were still true to the established characters we know and love from SAC and 2nd GIG. But Arise 3 was a complete disaster and insulting to the series. I really hope the last director can redeem this OVA for the 4th part of Arise.",1411430400,7,833,4.480263157894737
6657952,4,B00NJ0WDTE,"Nice addition to the Ghost in the Shell story line, wish it was available in English as it's distracting to read the subtitles on such a fast action paced video. Normally don't mind sub's all that much but not here. Sure wish the movie that goes with this group of 4 video's was available for streaming in the united states, its been about 2 years now that it's been out.",1453939200,,371,4.314285714285714

6657955,5,B00NJ0WDTE,I thought the story was good in the series. it gives a new perspective on how section 9 gets created. I do think it changes stuff from original cannon a bit since in the  original oav Bato and Makoto meet a bit differently .,1433203200,,224,4.090909090909091
6657956,5,B00NJ0WDTE,"I seriously cannot get enough of this series in whatever form the creators choose to present it. They could be showing me the same basic episode over and over again. Yet, I am still intrigued by the whole question of ""Where does the machine end and the human begin?"" And, as individuals, do we cease to exist if we lose our experiences/memories? Then there are the ethical/legal questions that arise when faced with ""crimes"" perpetrated by artificial life (AI). Truly fascinating and very thought provoking along the same lines as Blade Runner.",1432425600,,544,4.923913043478261

6657958,5,B00NJ0WDTE,"The anime gives good background on the main characters, even thou I perfer the art work of the original story. I  suppose it is to show the characters as being younger.  Overall, I would highly recommend adding the anime to your collection.  The series over all is one of my favorite anime.",1428710400,,290,4.538461538461538
6657959,4,B00NJ0WDTE,GITS fans will appreciate the back story. People who have not seen the movie...perhaps not so much.,1428624000,,99,4.882352941176471

6657961,4,B00NJ0WDTE,"Lately I've been pretty dissapointed with anime  productions after mid 2000, but this series has shown me that there still exist serious productions for mature viewers and fans who grew up on the 80's and 90's releases, I could go into details about Arise, but instead i highly recommend this stylish,smart,and well produced series. Can't wait to close it out with part  4th which coming soon well worth the money and time I'm sure.",1413763200,,432,4.824324324324325
8678498,3,B00NJ0WDTE,I had been looking to watch this since I really did not want to judge thing that much since it is continuing story.  I like the stand alone complex better.,1515542400,,155,4.166666666666667

8678500,1,B00NJ0WDTE,"I should have known that I wouldn't like Arise 3 once I saw there was no way to preview It before purchase. Arise 3 was very boring and consisted mostly of monotone dialog between its characters. I don't care for anime and had I known that's what Arise 3 was, I would have steered clear. I'm confused. heard many Japanese names  but saw no Japanese faces and that makes no sense either.",1504310400,,386,4.361111111111111

8678505,3,B00NJ0WDTE,"I'm not sure why this studio/distributor decided not to dub this with the original and superb English speaking voice actors, but it greatly reduces the enjoyment here. Personally, turning the Major into a pseudo juvenile doesn't help. To me the franchise rates respect for the creators designs, even when they did make the Major look like a Playboy Club waitress (The Bunnies). Otherwise, the overall visual impact has been significantly enhanced.",1465689600,,447,5.309859154929577
