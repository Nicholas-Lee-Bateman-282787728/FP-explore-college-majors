1635517,5,B00005NKT3,Victoria Principal gives an excellent performance portraying a woman being stalked by her very disturbed ex-husband.  Robert Hayes is at his best illustrating the lengths of someone who becomes obsessed with controlling another person. I shudder to think this is a reality for some women who are trapped in an unhealthy marriage.  I recommend this movie highly and hope that anyone trying to escape from an abusive relationship will watch this film.,1376611200,,449,5.222222222222222
1635518,5,B00005NKT3,"This movie touched my heart. It was a movie about a woman who gets tortured by her own abusive husband because he don't want to face the break up.
What this movie tells us is probably happening everyday to lots of women. Most of the time they don't even get help from anybody and they are alone with this problem.
For me its a real life movie and not some made up Hollywood story.
Victoria Principal plays this abducted woman very real.",1302307200,,436,4.329268292682927
1635519,5,B00005NKT3,"This was a really great movie. It was suspenceful and dramatic. But reviewers seem to overlook the fact that the young boy was stuck in the middle of everything that was going on. William Greenblatt played the young boy to perfection. In my opinion William Greenblatt was one of the most talented (and cutest) child actors ever. So, please watch this  movie because it is good, but also watch it to see William Greenblatt's greatly underrater performance. You won't regret it.",1274745600,2,476,4.8765432098765435
1635520,3,B00005NKT3,"This was good about a ex-husband who want's
his ex-wife back and goes to the extreme to

1635521,4,B00005NKT3,"I've seen a couple of movies of this genre and this one was one of the better.  How a ""crazed"" cop can't let his successful working wife ""go"" and difficult it was for her to get the law inforcement to help her because he was a cop.  Based on a true story.",1142985600,4,255,3.8846153846153846
1635542,2,B00005NKT3,"I reserve one-star ratings for movies that are so bad that I can't finish them.  I finished this one.  It was free, but I would never waste a penny on it.

Typical Lifetime-type drama drama, with one dimensional characters, mediocre acting, and sometimes very corny and unrealistic dialogue (the fault of the writers, not the actors).  Very clear-cut good vs. bad, with nothing in between.  In this case, an evil, abusuve husband/ex-husband, and scared, abused wife.  Nothing original or suspenseful.

I know that it was ""inspired by actual agents,"" but they seemed to take too much artistic license to make it realistic.",1428796800,,621,5.029411764705882
1635543,4,B00005NKT3,Good movie kept my attention,1424476800,,28,4.8
1635544,3,B00005NKT3,"Week acting.  Week plot. Week characters. Week transitions in dialog. Plot had  potential but lacked cohesion. Lead actor was believable, others call in their roles.",1424390400,,165,5.56

1635546,1,B00005NKT3,"She ran around with a phone in her hand without calling 911? enough for me, silly!",1424304000,,82,4.1875
1635547,2,B00005NKT3,So very helpless. Pitiful. I know people this helpless do exist. I had trouble watching it because a shotgun would have solved her problem. What was left of him should have decorated her walls. She lost her marbles with fear. Didn't even dial 911 with a phone in her hand - pitiful. She was too old for the part. She was 46 and the youngest daughter was about 4. The flashbacks got very boring. The children were way and above the best actors.,1423785600,,443,4.349397590361446
1635548,5,B00005NKT3,"This was crazy but unfortunately can happen in real life, and besides, Victoria Principal, need I say more.  I enjoyed it because it was an eye opener and reminder of how bitterness can cause a person to be irrational and dangerous.  A must see!",1421884800,,245,4.545454545454546
1635549,5,B00005NKT3,"We need more ""real-life"" movies such as this, to bring more attention to domestic violence!! Especially when it comes at the hands of the very people that swear ""To Honor and Protect!"".",1421020800,,185,4.8125

1635553,1,B00005NKT3,"Strange and disjointed. I painfully watched it hopefully, wishing it would get better but it didn't.  Don't waste your time on this.",1397088000,3,132,5.0
1635554,5,B00005NKT3,This movie was amazingly accurate and scary.  About a woman who was married to a policeman but divorced him and he stalked her and made her life miserable to the point of .....true story,1396828800,,186,4.470588235294118
1635555,3,B00005NKT3,"While this is based on a true story (and I know that people unfortunately get involved with individuals with personality disorders), this movie played out like a bad Hollywood scrip.

The ex-wife sees the ex-husband get out of the car with her present hubby with the cord-less phone in hand.  Instead of hiding in the house and calling the police, she runs out of range - unable to call anyone.  When she sees help and runs to her, wouldn't you know it, the car wouldn't start.  That stuff exist in bad horror/drama's all of the time.",1396483200,2,534,4.53125
1635556,5,B00005NKT3,"Victoria Principle and Robert Hays, along with Chris Lawford, who is Peter Lawford's son in real life did a great acting job of showing how a woman Victoria Principle divorced from her husband Robert Hays a Police Officer stalks his x-wife and then kidnaps her after beating Chris Lawford her live in boyfriend, who wants to marry her and take care of her and her two children.

I do wish more women who are abused would watch these movies from Lifetime Television, as they are true stories of what many women go through as well as their children with a physical and mental abuse relationship with a boyfriend or husband.  It might give them the courage to leave before it is to late for many, which we all have seen with the murders of these women and children by their abusive husbands.and fathers.

It also would not hurt men to watch these movies, as it may enlighten some to seek help before they either go to prison or end up dead.  Many men are now coming out against abusing women and that men have to stop, as well as buying women and girls for sex must stop.

Watch this wonderful movie with some girlfriends, or even some male friends for a time of sitting on the edge of your seat waiting what will happen next to the wife and her abusive husband and her boyfriend.

1635557,3,B00005NKT3,"Poor Kate (Victoria Principal- NAKED LIE), her life w/ her two wonderful kids and her new boyfriend would be absolutely perfect, if not for her ruthless, psychopathic ex-husband Paul (Robert Hays- AIRPLANE 1 and 2). Paul's been stalking Kate since their bitter divorce two years earlier. He's been able to skirt the law due to his being a cop. Now, his efforts seem to be increasingly intense and violent. It becomes apparent that Paul will never stop in his mission to take his family back. First, he snags the boyfriend off the street at gunpoint! Next, after knocking out lover-boy, Paul abducts Kate. He grows more dangerous, and whiney, w/ each passing second.  Meanwhile, we're treated to flashbacks of Kate and Paul in their earlier years of marital ""bliss"", showing his gradual mental disintegration. THE ABDUCTION is an ok thriller. For her part, Ms. Principal is stellar, especially when she turns the tables on Paul. Hays is pretty convincing as a maniac, making us want to ring his neck!

1635560,3,B00005NKT3,"I didn't want to watch an old movie, with outdated film techniques. I was disappointed that Amazon lied and said the ""release date"" was 2013.

Except this one runs through the entire house, outside, next door, and half way down the street with the phone in her hand and doesn't call 911.  I think this could have been a good story line, but it lacked a lot of realistic scenes.",1431129600,,439,4.475
