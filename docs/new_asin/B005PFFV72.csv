8482486,3,B005PFFV72,"The title and the cover are a bit miss given, The DVD  cover doesn't instruct you on the ornaments all of the ornaments pictured.  The Teacher of this DVD , likes to show off what he can turn, but doesn't instruct how to on them, there 's one that he covers and assumes the turner watching know how to make the item.
He personally likes to show off his ornaments, and not instruct how.  It's ok, a low ok!.  And for a teacher you would expect more and be informative.
It's my opinion!",1372464000,,484,4.172043010752688
