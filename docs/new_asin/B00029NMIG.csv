2071752,2,B00029NMIG,"After hearing about how 'messed up' this show was I ordered it ASAP. I'm a big fan of anime like Excel Saga, FLCL, and Puni Puni Poemy so I couldn't wait for this one. I've heard people say that it is crazier than Excel Saga or FLCL... well after watching it I was highly disappointed. Sure there were a few funny moments but the rest was just so boring I couldn't stand it. Almost all the characters are so bland it loses your attention fast. Also, they stick with some of the bits to long and which gets old real fast. The show does get a little better as it progresses but I seriously hope it gets A LOT better in the next volume. One thing I did like about it was the live action cuts from ADV. It was interesting to see they went through the trouble to do that... kinda made it unique. Also, since it includes some `vintage' episodes it was worth the cash. In my opinion it seems they took the older 8min ones, upped the animation and dragged them out to be 20mins. If your a fan of this genre of anime you would probably enjoy this somewhat but don't be expecting much.",1089244800,5,1075,4.173076923076923
2071773,5,B00029NMIG,"Take the basic animation of Ren and Stimpy, add shades of Excel Saga and throw in a pile of useless crude humor and popculture and you get what is knowen as the Super Milk Chan Show. Milk is a 5 yr old super herion who drops f-bombs like a sailor and refuses to pay her bills. He gets hired by the lazy and often ""Challanged"" president (of everything!) he normaly forgets what he calls milk for and ends up making usless convo with her or sends her on redunat missions. The first dvd set in this four part serries is broken in to two disks. 100% whole is the more crude and americanized verson of the show that has more western pop culture refferances and shows the voice cast as breaks from the cartoon itself. The other disk is the straight from Japan verson with video essays as breaks. Personaly I like the more western verson of the show but dislike the ""behind the seceens footage"" but you can't win them all. If your really into the the imature and pointless cartoons like I am then I highly suggest this set. However this set is an aquired tatse and you will either love it or hate it there is really no in between on this one. And a side note for my fellow ""smoking"" friends that shop here. If you think Aqua Teen Hunger Force was a roit then check this one out a few bowls and this show will make you laugh until it hurts",1124928000,8,1331,4.203125
2071774,5,B00029NMIG,"It is the best show I have ever seen! I cannot believe why so many people say this DVD is lame!!!! Heh, heh! It's not. ""The Super Milk-Chan Show"" has a lot of humor, and maybe violence. If you like shows such as ""South Park"" on ""Comedy Central"", and ""Futurama"", ""Robot Chicken"", and ""Tom Goes to the Mayor"" on Cartoon Networks's late-night [adult swim], then you'll LOVE this! It's like a mixture of those shows! It's very funny, and packed with attitude! Add it to your DVD collection now!!!!

I suggest that young viewers should not watch this show, no matter how cute it looks. I suggest that people over 15 can.",1119398400,2,615,4.491071428571429
2071775,5,B00029NMIG,"First off, I want to clear up some misconceptions:

When you buy this DVD, it comes with 2 DVD's... The American(Fosterized) version, AND the original Japanese episodes. One DVD has an american flag on it, the other says 'Original Japanese Episodes'. The Japanese episodes come dubbed, and also with Japanese voice+subtitles. If you rate down this DVD for the poor American version then you're a bit on the dimwitted side. You get both versions.

Now, as for the review:

The American version is, well, moreso translated and changed so that American audiences would find it funny. A lot of people like it, a lot don't. Personally, I can't stand Tetsuko's voice so I didn't bother watching it. This is NOT the version that is shown on Adult Swim. Surprisingly enough, Adult Swim bought the Japanese version and not the American version! Weird? Yeah, it really is. A lot of self-proclaimed American ""Otaku"" (Ugh...) prefer this version. (Ironic!) Also, this version really DOES seem to be a huge joke on ADV videos behalf. It's almost like they're making fun of poor dubs. (But most people seem to insist they were serious about it. Who know, right?)

Now, the Japanese version. The Japanese version, even when dubbed in english, is really hilarious. The problem is that the humor is rather dry and cynical, so you need to really enjoy a less blatant type of humor. Each episode is self-serving, rather comparable to Aqua Teen Hunger Force, despite this being a genuine anime. The humor is also very centric on references to Japanese culture, something yet again that just simply won't be funny to someone who isn't familiar with the culture. Most of my friends whom watch Super Milk Chan seem to have the ""Huh? Well, what's so funny?"" attitude towards the series. ""It's really not funny.."" Asides from that, the actual content of the show is really hilarious, if not brilliantly done. There are some repetitive moments, but that alone is part of the humor and parody of this show.

Let me jump back to the American episodes -- If you've only seen Super Milk Chan on Adult Swim, then you HAVEN'T seen the American episodes. You've only seen the Japanese ones. If you thought that Super Milk Chan could be funny, but the Japanese episodes didn't 'click' with you, then buying these DVD's might actually be worth your time. I was surprised to find out how many people absolutely adore the American version of Super Milk Chan but hate the Japanese(Adult Swim) version.

Asides from getting the ""Oh! Super Milk Chan"" episodes on these DVD's, you also get classic Milk Chan shorts. These are just as good as ""Oh! Super Milk Chan"", but they are most obviously even MORE dated than Oh! Super Milk Chan, the artwork alone being a bit on the lower quality. (But not at all bad.) Which leads to another unfortunate thing, ""Oh! Super Milk Chan"" does sorta date all the way back to 1998. So even if you DO get a lot of jokes, or cameos in the series they may just be too old to still be funny. (But I think everyone could be amused with the President having a PS3.)

So yeah, these DVD's are worth the money, and the series is really a brilliant comedy. But just a comedy; Don't expect a story. You get both the US and Japanese versions of the show with these DVD's, and if you don't like the Japanese version which is being aired on Adult Swim, you might want to give the American versions a try. Chances are you're missing out on something if you've already decided you hate Super Milk Chan. (Dr. Eyepatch. <3)",1107388800,40,3498,4.650485436893204
2071776,5,B00029NMIG,"This DVD contains 2 *different* English dubs, and 1 Japanese dub.

The 17+ English dub #2 comes on its own disc, because it is infused with a live-action drama unfolding inside the ADV Studios in TX, similar to an episode of Mystery Science Theatre 3000.  The English dub #1 is simply a direct translation from the Japanese dub, and this is what aired on Cartoon Network.

Now I don't normally watch English dubs anymore, but the ""just-for-DVD"" dub is absolutely hillarious!  I don't think I have cracked up this much in years!  I'm not familiar with the Cartoon Network dub too much, although I swapped over to that disc after watching the 17+ dub, and it failed to get me to laugh even ONCE!

I see people on here posting reviews based on watching it on TV.  Hello?  This vulgar DVD is NOTHING LIKE the TV version!  If I were rating the TV version, I'd give it like 1-2 stars.  The DVD version is pure gold!

If I had to compare this to something else, it has similar comedic and animation qualities to Ren & Stimpy, Aqua Teen Hunger Force, and South Park.  All of which I am huge fans of, so this DVD series is a definite *MUST BUY* as far as I'm concerned.

The 17+ (English dub #2) had me laughing more often than an episode of Family Guy.",1106956800,5,1244,4.333333333333333
2071777,4,B00029NMIG,"It seemed like most of the Super Milk Chan Show - 100% Whole (Vol. 1) DVD was not of the awesome cartoon, but of lame behind the scenes skits preformed by the voice-over actors.  If you saw Super Milk-Chan on [adult swim] like I did for the first time, do yourself a favor and skip the first volume.  Buy the second, third, and forth volumes.  You can only appreciate the first volume if you've seen the other volumes first.  I rated this DVD 4 stars only because I love Super Milk-Chan!",1102896000,5,487,4.318681318681318
2071778,2,B00029NMIG,"Super Milk Chan may be better in Japanese...I don't know.  But I have been watching it on Adult Swim of late and I must write a review to speak my bit.

This show is just not very good.  Most laughs are groan induced or bitter rather than snickers or outright laughter.  The episodes are also a little dull with not much happening besides the seemingly requisite visit by the landlord, call from the president and visit with the evil doctor on TV.  I didn't think it was funny.  There are, however, a number of shows that are snicker inducing or gut wrenching, The Venture Bros. for one.  So it comes down to this.  I spend thirty minutes watching an episode of Milk Chan.  I could spend those same thirty minutes watching something funnier.  So why not.

The same goes for the purchase of this DVD set.  You can take the money you would spend on this DVD and, rather than spend it on something that may at best get a few laughs, buy a DVD that is REALLY funny, like Harvey Birdman, Aqua Team Hunger Force or whatever else really tickles you.  I'm not saying Milk Chan does not have some positive aspects, just that it really isn't worth your time or money.",1100995200,3,1157,4.375586854460094
2071779,5,B00029NMIG,"This show pretty much had me in stiches from the begininng.  A few words of warning:  this isn't a sophisticated show.  It's kind of like a Japanese version of South Park crossed with Beavis and Butthead.  If you liked the above two shows, chances are you're going to like Milk Chan.  I also only watched the English version so I can't comment on the differences between the two.  One thing I would have liked to have seen is subtitles on the English version.",1100390400,4,459,4.469879518072289
2071780,5,B00029NMIG,"I liked all three versions of the show, the ""Americanized"" version is funny in it's own way, and if you don't like that then there is a more literal version as well as the original Japanese. so, depending on your style of humor, you will either like it or hate it, there is no in between here. You must have a warped sense of humor.",1092096000,4,332,4.123076923076923
2071781,3,B00029NMIG,"I absolutely LOVE the original Japanese shows!! They are hilarious and bizarre, a great example of Japanese humor taken to the limit. But ADV Films added yet another badly done revision of a great show to the already overwhelming heep of what most Americans know to be ""anime"" (Dragon Ball Z anyone?).

 First of all, this DVD was supposed to be released almost ONE YEAR AGO! I've been waiting for an affordable region1 copy for years (the Japanese DVDs cost about $50 a piece) and when it finally comes out, not only has it been slaughtered by bad voice actors and direction, but THE WHOLE SECOND DISC IS WORTHLESS!! It's the ""Americanized"" versions with badly made live action miniDV clips of the people at the ADV office...completely irrelevant! I literally threw the case at the wall when I realized that there were ONLY 3 full episodes of Oh! Super Milk Chan and 4 mini episodes of the original Super Milk Chan....ON TWO DISCS!!!!! Two discs is enough to fit every episode and we only get THREE?

 As for these other reviews, I assume they saw the English version, or have a very different sense of humor from myself, because if you like Adult Swim style humor ala Aqua Teen Hunger Force style non sequitur or Home Movies style subtlety, I highly recommend this to you.

 Perhaps for the many people here (in the US) who've never experienced the comedic genius of Oh! Super Milk Chan before it's recent molestation by ADV Films, the English versions may seem alright (some may claim they're even better), but if you do have the chance to see it, I must insist that you watch the original Japanese version with subtitles FIRST. The references are arcane enough to warrant being changed for an American audience, but the English voice acting is sacrilegious!!! They're trying to make Milk Chan sound like she looks, which is the opposite effect of the original deadpan voice. The President and Tetsuko are just as badly done. The people at Williams Street should be doing the American version, not these BAKATSURA!!

 Also, they took out the original intro and ending animations as well as songs, which were much better and fitting than the schlock that replaced it. They should've bitten the bullet and paid for the rights to the songs. Another testament that ADV Films is just another anime importing company trying to make some cash off of others brilliance and lacks respect/appreciation for the original work.

 I will buy the next volume because I love the original show, but I hope that I'll get more for my money next time. As for my rating, I give the original Japanese show 6 out of 5 stars and the American version 1 out of 5, averaging 3 stars. If you can find a way to see the originals without giving ADV any money, GO FOR IT!!",1090454400,12,2744,4.650826446280992
2071782,2,B00029NMIG,"What can I say about The Super Milk-Chan Show? Perhaps nothing, since this managed to not make me laugh and left a bad taste in my mouth.
The show is about a five year old named Milk who curses like a sailor and is an all-around brat. She lives with a robot who is searching for her father and is love-sick and a slug who is an apparent alcholic. Between dodging her queer landlord and trying to get cash to pay off her bills, she also a super hero (although she has no actual super powers). The President is a character who is as smart as a box of thumbtacks, calls her up whenever trouble is afoot. Along for the ride is Dr. Eyepatch, a mad scientist that communicates with our main charcter via a Jumbo-Tron.
While the plot will hook you in, the actual show is a dud. The humor is filled with lame jokes that seem to go on forever. Mostly, this occurs whenever the President and Milk have telephone conversations. This makes watching the show long and tiring, ultimately going nowhere. However, the animation is great, especially for many who grew up adoring Ren and Stimpy, The Powerpuff Girls, and early anime from the 60s and 70s.
You get two disks for this series. The first one contains episodes with more ""American""-themed punchlines and gags, along with live action bits featuring the crew of ADV Films. The live action bits make this series have a creative edge, but just like the show itself, this is pleaged by bad jokes and gags. Also included are ""vintage"" episodes, which are more like tradition animation (minus using computers to color, shade, ect.) US cast commentary and much more. The second disk contains the same episodes, but is more of a ""direct from Japan"" quality to them. Again, English and Japanese audio tracks are present and more bonus materials await for curious viewers.
All in all, Super Milk-Chan is a dud for the comedy anime branch and fails to capture it's viewer into it's zany, colorful world. To put it more simply, Super Milk-Chan is mere eye-candy and nothing more. But, if you are looking for anime that brillently makes punches at anime and pop culture, Excel Saga is you best bet.",1089763200,9,2127,4.585301837270341
8024578,5,B00029NMIG,"My fourteen year old daughter with autism saw the american version of this show on Youtube and my fifteen year old daughter said she laughed all the way through it and wanted me to see if there were anymore full episodes so she could watch some of those too. When I could not find any full episodes of the american version I thought ""Amazon usually has access to inexpensive movies and tv shows"" so I got online and had the dvd to that show in just a few days. Now Phoebe watches the american version of this show a few times a week and still laughs at that little 5 year old girl.

I'm not sure if I haven't seen it enough or the episodes I saw were the horrible ones but the show really isn't all that funny. It seems to be the same thing over and over again with Milk Chan doing some of the dumbest things on earth. The problem is that the stupid stuff this kid does takes to long to set up and there's no sting to any of the comedy. Notice that there are three volumes of DVD's but Adult Swim only played half of a season so obviously someone agrees with me.
