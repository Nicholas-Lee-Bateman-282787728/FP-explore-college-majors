8463159,4,B005A0FCSA,"From childhood, Ravel's ""Pavane"" was my favorite piece of classical music.  I knew it to be a reflection on a beautiful life, tragically removed from our own.  It's not included, supplanted rather by a Pavane from Gabriel Faure, which is a lovely piece of music and perhaps a few minutes longer.  I don't believe they've actually intended this to be received as a ""blues"" concert.

The selections are enjoyably upbeat, with sensuous vocals from Jazz Diva Diane Reeves.  I found this program while I was searching for variations on a Gershwin tune I've heard Peggy Lee singing, again, after her initial bout with cancer.  There was a video of hers' called ""Quintessential Peggy Lee"", within which she delivers a smooth-as-silk version of Gershwin's 'S Wonderful.  This orchestral presentation of the same melody is out there in cyberspace, and also on this sweet DVD.

While this is truly an enjoyable spectacle to watch, I docked a star for what I considered out-of-control recording levels.  I have an equalizer to subdue lower and mid-range peaks which over enthusiastically distort the presentation.  For most consumers this isn't an option.

8463160,5,B005A0FCSA,"A DOUBLE TREAT!  The lovely, talented ""jazz"" beauty Dianne Reeves sings Gershwin songs with her own Trio together with a full
