5232217,5,B00915G6MG,"WARNING! This review contains SPOILERS!  Proceed at your own risk

NCIS has always been one of my favorite TV shows. I like it so much that I now own every season on DVD. Not long ago, I watched all 24 episodes of NCIS Season 10 in the span of about a week. I thoroughly enjoyed every one of them.

NCIS is, of course, the long-running police procedural that is inspired by the real-world Naval Criminal Investigative Service (NCIS), the civilian-run law enforcement agency of the U.S. Navy. The show, which follows a fictional team of NCIS Special Agents, has (to date) completed 13 seasons on CBS. Season 10 ran from September 2012 to May 2013.

As Season 10 opens, the very first order of business is to resolve the cliffhanger from the Season 9 finale. Who on Special Agent Leroy Jethro Gibbss Major Case Response Team survived the bombing of NCIS headquarters by arch-nemesis Harper Dearing? Did NCIS Medical Examiner ""Ducky"" Mallard die after suffering a heart attack? We learn that everyone is alive, but what remains uncertain  and what is slowly and skillfully revealed as the season progresses  is what the long-term effects of the bombing are on our protagonists

Thus begins one of the most intense and dramatic seasons of NCIS that has appeared in several years. Several of Season 10s episodes interweave each team members personal struggle to recover from the bombing with many new and intriguing cases they must investigate.  Dr. Donald Ducky Mallard begins a long and difficult road back to full health after his heart attack; and forensics expert Abby Sciutos nightmares force her to confront her worst fears

Two multi-episode story arcs make Season 10 especially fascinating. An assassination attempt on Agent Ziva Davids father creates an international incident and results in the murder of a team member's loved one. During the ensuing investigation, Ziva begins behaving erratically while tracking down a suspect in the case. Against this backdrop, an over-zealous agent from the Department of Defense Inspector Generals office suddenly arrives at NCIS headquarters and announces that Special Agent Leroy Jethro Gibbs is now under investigation for possible criminal activities

I don't think theres a weak or mediocre episode anywhere to be found in NCIS Season 10. In fact, I can say with confidence that I believe the tenth season of NCIS is so consistently outstanding that it ranks among the finest in the long history of the show.  Highly recommended.",1471824000,6,2479,5.036674816625917

5232348,5,B00915G6MG,I ignored all the positive things I heard about NCIS until January 2016 when I finally watched a couple of reruns. I was hooked and now believe NCIS to be one of the best TV shows ever made. But I do not watch weekly episodes of TV series so I ordered the first 12 years from Amazon and have almost finished them. Highly recommend.,1457568000,,331,4.1875

5232434,5,B00915G6MG,"NCIS has always managed to deliver surprises even in it's tenth season when most shows are either a chore to sit through or have been put out to the television retirement home. I actually liked both the closing and opening story lines of Harper Dearing and the hard driven lawyer Parsons out to get Gibbs. Other interesting surprises include a post-heart attack Ducky getting to head up his own case or should I say cases and several episodes that serve to humanize our favorites such as Gone and the Namesake. I also thought Shell Shock was a particularly well done two part episode concerning a Marine suffers from PTSD. NCIS keeps on giving, even in its tenth season.",1451606400,,670,4.686440677966102

5232800,5,B00915G6MG,"My wife and I think NCIS is the best TV program ever put on the small screen. We, of course, watch every new episode during the regular season. But to fill in the summer we've been buying the NCIS season DVDs and watching between 7 and 14 episodes per week. They are even better the second time.

Watching the second time over is great because we know the characters and longer term story lines already so we can appreciate little things that may have escaped us the first time. Following almost every episode one of us declares, ""This is a really good show.""

The mix of smart detective work, good story lines, excellent dialog, character interaction, and humor simply isn't duplicated anywhere else. We hope NCIS continues for at least 20 seasons.

We never could get interested in NCIS Los Angeles, too much flash and not enough detective work, bad dialog, and poorly cast.

However, after giving it a chance for several episodes, we really like NCIS New Orleans. We really like Scott Bakula. Lucas Black is good but I find him difficult to understand sometimes. I'm not crazy about Zoe McLellan.

Back on NCIS every member of the cast is perfectly cast. Who doesn't love Abby. Ducky is wonderful. Gibbs sets a new standard for subtle while being right. Tony provides the comedy. Siva is great but I wish the director/writers would make use of her fighting capability more often. McGee does a great job as the technical guy and it's good to see him pushing back on Tony. McGee seems to be coming into his own in the later seasons.",1435881600,,1533,4.6213235294117645

5233410,5,B00915G6MG,"NCIS is one of the few ongoing programs that never disappoint.  The people have developed over the years but always maintained their moral compass. A refreshing and welcomed idea. The plots are always entertaining and never devolve into sadist infighting between the characters or devious plots to harm each other.  There are many programs I have started watching and had to abandon after two seasons.  I can get sadism, cruelty and lack of concern for the each other and the human race on nightly news.  I personally do not want it in my programing.",1419465600,,550,4.819148936170213

The episodes, I think, are trying to squeeze too much content into each one.  Like watching a movie, when you have read the book, and realized that the segway  needed for a scene must be on the cutting room floor, because you went from point A  to  point C .  The only reason you know what is going on is because point B was in the book.

Leroy Jethro Gibbs is such an interesting character, and Mark Harmon is such an appealing actor that they will probably survive the strange twist that was just suddenly abandoned. It was nice to see a character played by the same actor return from JAG, but then the part was basically a throw away. This is enjoyable as NCIS was a spinoff from JAG. I was hoping a few others would show up after Bud Roberts, and was a bit taken aback when Michael Bellisario appeared as a completely different character in some episodes.

Pro - Cheaper then B&M store, no hassle purchase..

CON - First disk Failed.. Again.. im seriously questioning the quality of the DVD releases now.. as I figured 2 separate purchases from 2 different locations entirely wouldn't both be bad!.. Its not even worthy going through the hassle to RMA - but ugh.. its annoying to have disks fail 2 times..

5235274,4,B00915G6MG,"This is a 'four star' review but I would actually rate it as more of a 3 1/2 star season. I'm not sure what happened exactly. It seemed as though there were too many new writers or that the writers from past seasons were becoming a bit tired. The acting was as good as it usually is. The cast is excellent. Yet some of the story-lines this season were poorly handled, the character development became much more stagnated, and there was less time given to focusing on the different characters in individual episodes focused primarily upon them. The season is enjoyable from beginning to end, but what happened, exactly? Tony is barely being 'funny' this season, even when making jokes. Yet one of the best episodes was one Michael Weatherly directed and I don't think it's an acting problem. The writing feels as if it's less inspired this year. It goes through the motions too much, and when episodes focus on character development and a larger story arc they become jarringly interjected with episodes that seem to be written as if prior episodes were not made so as to add 'filler' to the time, expanding the series by episode count but not in quality.

I love this series. I love these characters. Yet I found this season to be a bit of a minor disappointment. I hope the writers have improved upon this season with the next (which I still haven't seen), but I'm not looking forward to the loss of a central character (I will avoid saying who in case anyone is 'unspoiled') and I am not quite sure about the current direction. There were a lot of missed opportunities this year - Ducky's health at the beginning of the season was glossed over, Jimmy Palmer was barely in the season, and Abby was reduced to only working on the various crime issues at hand with less development - there is only one episode this season where Abby gets a chance to really shine, and then she seems to be a background character more than before.

Not to mention that the finale and the last few episodes were more over-the-top and less effective than past season wrap-ups.

Surely there are more NCIS fans who found this season fun without being anywhere near the quality of the past few seasons? It was a mixed bag for me and I was really expecting more from the writing team.",1385856000,,2260,4.547911547911548

NCIS is an amazing police drama. Mark Harmon is Gibbs, the boss. Michael Weatherly is Tony DiNozzo, senior field agent, and Sean Murray is Probie-Timothy McGee. In the first two seasons Sasha Alexander as Caitlin (Kate) Todd was a part or the team. Seasons 3-10 Cote de Pablo was Mussad liaison/probationary NCIS agent Ziva David. Pauley Perrette is Abby Scioto(?sp?), the goth forensic scientist. David McCallum and Brian Dietzen work in autopsy(Ducky and Jimmy Palmer).
The first two seasons, the NCIS Director was Tom Morrow, who we rarely saw and I don't know the actors name. Season 3-5 the NCIS Director was Jenny Shepard, played by Lauren Holly and we saw a lot of her as the Director became a more integral part of the storyline. Season 6-now (11), Rocky Carroll is  Director Leon Vance and he is often an integral part of the story as well.
The basic premise is find dead body, put together the clues, find the killer- with the occasional terrorist threat, assess, find terrorist, arrest or shoot terrorist. Your basic cop drama right? But the stories are very well written and the characters/actors work so well together.
If you are an NCIS fan you know this is worth having. If you've never seen NCIS, I highly recommend buying it- but start with season 1.",1385424000,,1543,4.5703971119133575

5235316,4,B00915G6MG,"The big story of the summer for this series, as many of us know, was Cote De Pablo's planned departure from the series after the first two episodes of Season 11.  This left me watching Season 10 suspecting that Shane Brennan and Gary Glassberg worked the season at least suspecting Cote was leaving, and writing the second half of the season working to set up closure with Ziva.
  Having said that, I found Season 10 to be up to the usual high standards this series continually gives.  At this point, dealing with ""The Body Of The Week"" part of the story has become secondary to the doings in the MTAC and between the team.  The interaction between the team and those around it has always been the hallmark of the series, and continued to be in this season.  The cast, as always, were great; and the ""visits""--Diane Neal's Abagail Borin, Joe Spano's Tobias Fornell--were at their usual high standards.
  This season began wrapping up the ""Harper Deering"" story, followed by Navy Yard bombing's aftermath--Abby being unable to sleep, Ducky fighting to get back to work following his heart attack...in the first half of the season, the episodes that stick out are ""Lost At Sea""--where Neal's CGIS Special Agent Borin and the team investigate a downed helicopter and the murdered pilot of the chopper; the two-parter ""Shell-Shock"", where a Marine suffering from PTSD witnesses the kidnapping/murder of a fellow Marine (Or does he??!?) and Gibbs has to help him sort out what he saw and what he didn't;
""Devil's Trifecta"", in which Melinda McGraw returns as the ex-wife of both Fornell and Jethro.  McGraw is magnificent as Diane Gibbs Fornell Sterling--she isn't in the best of moods when she pops up, and the aftermath of Tim McGee having to be her bodyguard one night...and the looks on the faces of Gibbs and Fornell (To say NOTHING of Tobias' reaction) may be one of the funniest moments this series has EVER had.  Robert Wagner comes back as Anthony DiNozzo Sr. for ""You Better Watch Out"", and for the first time, the series goes inside of Tony the Younger's apartment.  The episode that most sticks out in the first half of the season is ""The Namesake"".  This is a brilliant and touching episode, bringing back Ralph Waite as Jackson Gibbs and introducing Billy Dee Williams as Leroy Jethro Moore, the man Gibbs was named for.  It's an episode that deals with the estrangement between Gibbs's father and Jethro the Elder...and Gibbs' mother, who both men loved.  A strong episode, dealing with two old men's pride and stubborness.
  The season flipped with it's SECOND two-parter--""Shalom Shabbat"" and ""Shiva"".  Michael Nouri makes his final appearance as Ziva's father, the Mossad spymaster Eli David; Paula Newsome makes her final appearance as Jackie Vance, Leon Vance's wife.  Obviously, this is where I began to suspect--upon a second viewing of the season--that Brennan and Glassberg were writing an exit strategy for Ziva; but as the second half of the season progressed, Rocky Carroll's Leon Vance had to adjust to being a widower...but also came to understand Gibbs more, especially when it came to Jethro's avenging of Shannon and Kelly.  For Carroll, the second half of the season was an evolving performance that was done well.  Cote was very, VERY good in the back half--Ziva NEVER lost her focus at work, but was working off the books to pursue (And yes, KILL) Ilan Bodnar.  That second half of the season seemed a stark contrast to Season 1 after ""Bete Noire""--remember Gibbs' workstation running facial recognition on the photo of Ari until the end of the season??!?  Notable in the second half are ""Detour"", where Mallard and Palmer are kidnapped with a body they were taking back to MTAC and have to work to plan an escape, and ""Squall"", in which we meet McGee's father--an Admiral in the Navy--and see the strain in their relationship (Note: Sean Murray has had a lot of fun in dealing with Tim's various family issues--in my review of Season 9, I forgot to talk about ""The Penelope Papers"", and how great Lily Tomlin was as Tim's grandmother).
  The season's last two episodes actually come after Ziva has avenged both her father's murder and Jackie Vance's murder (The episode--major surprise--is named ""Revenge""), and again, really seem to have been plotted out with the option of Ziva leaving the MTAC.  Colin Hanks' Richard Parsons, the Inspector General investigator, seems to question whether Gibbs is leading a team that ""has a lot of red on their ledger"" (Avengers' line, I know...), and focuses on Gibbs--again, going back to this series go-to story, Jethro sniping Pablo Hernandez all those years ago.  The season finale is unique--Muse Watson returns, so we get Mike Franks as spirit guide again.  But the shock here is John M. Jackson dusting off A.J. Chegwidden from ""JAG"".  It's a great return, somewhat surprising--of course, some probably were thinking ""Chegwidden??!?  They couldn't have gotten Harm or Mac??!?""  Then again, Jackson's return could be just a start of Brennan going full circle...
  This was a season that got angry after the deaths of Eli and Jackie.  The usual lightness that sometimes is part and parcel of this series was shadowed by knowing that Ziva was on the hunt for Ilan, and KNOWING what she was going to do to Bodnar when she caught up to him.  Again, in viewing the season again after the summer, I just was left feeling the showrunners knew Cote was more likely to NOT come back.

What a difference in the characters, writing and displays.

It is so far ahead of the follow up show it is a credit to all concerned.

The ensemble cast is unforgettable, and tragically ignored by well-deserved awards for their remarkable efforts - the characters are unique and fascinating; the roles are exceptional and the actors both terrific and lucky to play them.

I didn't watch this show when it started, but a friend who was just sure that I would love it loaned her first season DVD set to me and that was all it took.  I have been hooked to this show for years.  I have the other nine seasons on DVD, so of course I got the tenth.

5236011,4,B00915G6MG,"Overall, the tenth season was enjoyable and flowed well. It wrapped up the death of Ziva's father and Director Vance's wife fairly well. The only reason I give it four rather than five stars is that the final couple of episodes were borderline unbelievable. The witch hunt with an ever changing target, which ultimately settles on Gibbs for no apparent reason just seemed to be a reach. Then the ""send Gibbs away on a mysterious secret mission"" to have some kind of cliff hanger was a questionable ending to an otherwise great show. Keep up the good work guys. I'll be sorry to see Ziva leave next season.",1381017600,,605,4.611111111111111

5236241,5,B00915G6MG,"Another very strong season with excellent stories, more personal information about the characters and a real cliffhanger ending.
As expected, season 10 wraps up nine's ongoing story and starts a new ongoing story for season 11.
Harper Dearing meets his match as Gibbs closes that story line.
Individual episodes show us DiNozzo's apartment and introduce ""The Admiral"".  Both of these build the characters making them real people.
Another important building episode is ""Hit and Run"" providing a glimpse into Abby's childhood.
""Devil's Trifecta"" is just fun as Fornell, Gibbs and their ex-wife ""work together"" in a personal story that touches all of them.
""Shell Shock"" is a two-part story is well written and ""right-on the money' looking at this problem and internal terrorists.
I do not want to do a spoiler and will not go into the on-going story for this season.  This is possibly the best of these stories.  This one is complex nuanced and devastating for the NCIS characters.  The acting is excellent fully showing the emotional impact of the events.

Jimmy and Ducky are funny together. I love all the cast members. I love their camaraderie and the love they have for each other. They treat each other with respect and like a family. All of the episodes have funny scenes in them and a few brought tears to my eyes. All in all, it didn't disappoint. The money I paid for this series was so worth it.

If you like NCIS you'll like this season, the cliffhanger is suitably ""oh my you cannot leave me a year before I know what happens""",1379376000,,329,3.91044776119403

5236678,5,B00915G6MG,I missed most of Season 10 because of being in a homeless shelter.  Getting to watch all the episodes one after the other made the season that much better.  The special features were better than ever-especially Tony's apartment.  I can't wait for season 11!,1379289600,,257,4.795454545454546

When ever the most dramatic things have happened and you just can't believe that the show can go on or make it without someone, somehow it does and it gets better!  I love the Tenth Season and I know I will love the Eleventh Season too.  We will just have to see how it goes without Zeva.",1379203200,,326,3.909090909090909
5236683,1,B00915G6MG,"It takes a tremendous amount of effort to screw up a show as good as NCIS. But the producers of season 10 have risen to the task. Even JAG's A.J. Chegwidden and the back from the dead Tommy Franks can't unscrew this mess of a story arc.  A tremendously talented corps of actors was left to gnaw on the scenery, emoting their way through a season of disjointed flashbacks interspersed with occasional criminal activity.  Humorless, pointlessly pensive and without any real dramatic tension, someone should investigate what's been done to NCIS. Even William Webb, one of the greatest D.P.'s in the industry, was left with nothing to photograph. What does it say when a guy as good as Mr. Webb, who could create interesting images of a dead flounder, struggles to find something to photograph. I'd be embarrassed to take credit for any of this mess.
Audio and video were out of sync on our burn. Two episodes may have been out of sequence. I can't tell, as we don't watch in real time. Was there supposed to be a complete episode between Tony and Ziva's accident and further mention?
No wonder Cote de Pablo wants out!",1379203200,4,1115,4.654822335025381

Now I am hooked too; in fact I like it as well or better - leaning more toward better - than any other crime drama series I've ever watched. It is now the #1 ranked TV show, which is no surprise. I've watched every season prior to this; just finished watching this one, and I have nothing but praise...from the stories, to the casting, to the snappy and often funny dialogue. And Leroy Jethro Gibbs (Mark Harmon) is the best team chief ever in a crime drama. Nothing but praise and my highest recommendation!!",1378944000,,600,4.463636363636364

Hated to hear Ziva was leaving but I'm sure they will come up with a good replacement.  I thought Ziva was an excellent replacement for Kate.  I don't watch a lot of TV but this show I do try and catch and if I miss an episode I go to CBS the next evening and watch it.

Its tongue in cheek approach combined with its constant character development and plot twists make this series endearing. It combines terrorism, espionage, murder and many other activities into the spotlight of this elite investigation unit where the Navy and Marine Corps are affected.

Mark Harmon as agent Leroy Jethro Gibbs, Michael Weatherly as agent Anthony ""Tony"" D. DiNozzo, Cote de Pablo as agent Ziva David, and David McCallum as Dr. Donald ""Ducky"" Mallard are brilliant, not to forget Sean Murray, Pauley Perrette or Rocky Carroll! But, it is Mark Harmon's restrained, honorable, poker faced agent Jethro Gibbs that is somehow the force that drives this show.",1377648000,3,783,5.471074380165289

I just love Abby! She keeps you laughing through the show and then there is Zevia and Tony with their chemistry that keeps you wondering.

5237001,5,B00915G6MG,One of the things that is so good about NCIS  is the fact that is doesn't push the hard edge of crime in your face.  So many of the police shows are so gritty that there is no enjoyment.  The character development is wonderful as well.,1375574400,,235,4.065217391304348

5237238,5,B00915G6MG,"I have been a fan of this series from the very beginning when it aired as a 2 part pilot on the CBS series JAG. NCIS - has succeeded in lasting 10 years, same as it's predecessor JAG and I'm looking forward to season 11 starting this fall. Just when I thought they couldn't top the season 9 cliff hanger with the explosion of a car bomb outside the NCIS offices in the Washington DC Navy Yard and leaving us thinking that Duckie had been killed suffering a massive heart attack at the shock of learning the team and many other occupants of NCIS might have been killed by a car bombing, they have a 2 part episode in the middle of the season killing off ZIva's father, the Israel Musaud leader Eli David and and the wife of the NCIS director which leads up to the hunt of the assassin by Ziva who in her heart wants revenge for the death of her father. She finds and kills the person responsible which leads up to an outside investigation which has us believing they are after Ziva when in the end it turns out to be a cover up and the person they are after is team leader Leo Jethro Gibbs. This also leads up to the surprise visit of former JAG commanding officer Admiral AJ Chegwedden who is no longer working at JAG but is now a high price high power attorney and who would be best to help with the defense of GIbbs. This is a top notch series and the cast is top notch with Mark Harmon as Gibbs who not only is the lead character but also a co producer of the show, and a top notch supporting cast Michael Weatherly as ever wize cracking and movie efficianado Anthony DiNozzo, Cote de Pablo as former Israeli Mossad Assassin  Ziva David brought in to replace agent Caitlin Todd who was killed by Ziva's half brother at the end of season 2, Sean Murray as the MIT computer geek Timothy Mcgee, Pauley Perette as the goth, tattoo bearing and very savvy Forensic Specialist Abby Sciuto, Rocky Carrol as NCIS Director Leon Vance who came in after season 5 to replace the former director Jenny Shepard after her death, David McCallum as the chief medical examiner Dr. Donald ""Ducky"" Mallard, and Brian Dietzen who plays Ducky's medical assistant Jimmy, both in the field and in the morgue. This show came along at a time when CSI was running strong in the ratings and I have a gut fealing that NCIS will out last CIS because of the great stories and the raport between team members, and believing and following Gibbs rules, the drama and the humor with the wake up head slaps. This is not only a top notch investigative team but also a family that I have grown to love in the 10 years this show has been on. I don't know what I will do when this show finally comes to an end. I fully believe it will be when the cast and producers decide it's time to end it and not failing ratings that will kill this show as it is consistently in the 10 ten ratings week after week and reruns of the show are run almost daily on cable USA network. In my opinion NCIS is the best series on TV because of the ever developing characters and I can only wish that we might see NCIS continue on for another 10 years. Anything is possible. I keep thinking they are going to come up with another spin off of the series with the Coast Guard Criminal Investigative Service since they've had the re-curring character played by a former cast member of Law and Order SVU Diane Neal. Hey she's a red head, she's got a personality like Gibbs...I'm thinking there is a possible match there.",1371686400,,3456,4.300613496932515

This season continues to show Gibbs, Tony, Zeva, Tim, Abbey, and all the rest of the regulars growing as people and maturing each day as real people do. We appreciate that in a TV show. As usual the mysteries are engaging and entertaining. We can't wait to see what ""McAbbey"" will do next or when, if ever, Tony and Zeva will break rule #12, or is it #10.

Yes, it follows a formula (dead marine/officer/etc., get your gear, investigate, catch the bad guy), but if you love the show it's probably not because of the weekly plot line. It's the character development that holds me and makes me wait for the next episode. The murder mystery aspect has actually migrated to become the sub-plot and the characters' interaction and changes over time are the thread that keeps me coming back. Most of the weekly story could be overlooked and wouldn't be missed from week to week, but the character evolution is significant enough that I hate to watch an episode out of order. If by chance you are new to the series and like a few episodes, go back and watch it from the beginning if you can.",1371600000,,795,4.566433566433567

Last 2 seasons have been a triumph BECAUSE of all the great Intertextuality- allusion, self-reference, pastiche and parody

This season, not sure.
Too often I was left confused, expecting things to be untangled next week, but just more and more knotsand they seemed gratutitous.

There has always been 'code words, the rules, and things characters knew, but as a viewer could trust they made sense if and when the whole picture came into focus.
This season I felt like an outsider.
Its always been worth the wait for the resolution, even if resolution was that nothing was resolved.  But it was a shared experience with the characters.
Just not so this season

I think they missed opportunities to develop characters.always slow, but may have lost ground this season
Skimmed over Ducky's health crisis, Jimmy's marriage; And Tim's either disappearing into the background of there is something big going on in his life and there is nothing to point in either direction. Abby's family situation?and what the heck with Ziva and Tony? Something is going on but they sure worked overtime to keep viewers out of the loop.

Obviously Gibbs has some kind of deathwish, but now there seems to be something completely unknown escalating it.

Also kind of missed the weekly cases that too often were over shadowed by whatever is going on with the Vance-Mossad-inter-agency politics and international intrigue

NCIS was never a 'keep it simple' show and wouldn't want it to be....but I never felt like a needed a scorecard and a code book before.

This show is obviously very stringently crafted - to be intentionally annoying?  There is no way that Mark Harmon's character's offensiveness would have been tolerated in reality.  As with Supernatural, I get the sense that the actors don't seem to be too happy to be doing the same thing for so long albeit well-compensated.

The first season doesn't as do several of the other seasons.  We did manage to watch the 7th, 8th, and 9th seasons as they do have subtitles.

None are perfect but all are good people, that is all one can ask of a person whether in real life or the people you invite into your home via the television.

Still good though. Need more special guest female agents to keep the male audience interested...more interested. Plus, Gibbs needs another red head to start hooking up with, not old blonde ladies wearing mock turtlenecks. And no more NCIS:L.A. References or special guest spots as if that show is comparable or that anyone  even watches it. NCIS original, that's it. It jumped the shark the second LL was named to the cast.

The individual actor's/actress'es  are great at bringing their characters to life, and just when you think you know all about a character something new comes to light in a new episode that makes you re-evaluate the character or how they would respond to a situation. This show has remained fresh even after 9 seasons, not many shows even last that long. If you like more action oriented shows you will find some of that here, but it's the characters and how they interact that keep the show strong.

5238837,5,B00915G6MG,"""NCIS"" returned for its tenth season in 2012-2013, and showed no signs of resting on its laurels as the top-rated network television drama.  It continues to offer exciting crime-of-the-week plots, to be solved by a well-chosen cast whose interactions are as entertaining as the forensics.  Mark Harmon returns as crusty Senior Special Agent Leroy Jethro Gibbs, head of a high profile investigation team and father figure of an improvised family.

""NCIS"" begins its tenth season dealing with the aftermath of an horrific terrorist attack on the NCIS headquarters.  The attack injures several team members and leaves pathologist ""Ducky"" Mallard (David McCallum) clinging to life after a heart attack.  The early episodes are devoted to a ruthless hunt for the man responsible for the attack, and to dealing with the trauma of the attack, which affects the entire organization.  A thoughtful two part episode later in the first half of the season deals specifically with post-traumatic stress disorder as a key factor in a murder.  The investigation will cause the team, especially Gibbs, to confront its effects.  Another story arc beginning after the holiday break will place the careers and lives of several characters at risk; some will not survive.  A spring episode may reveal the origins of forensic technician Abby Sciuto's (Pauley Parrette) relationship with Gibbs.

""NCIS"" is pretty good about taking care of its recurring characters, and this season is no exception.  Special Agent Tony DiNozzo's father (Robert Wagner) makes a poigant return visit in the Christmas episode, to stay with Tony in his heretofore unseen bachelor apartment.  Coast Guard Investigator Abigail Borin (Diane Neal) helps break a perplexing case involving a helicopter crash; Tony (Michael Weatherly) and McGee (Sean Murray) make a fateful bet on who will get a date with the fiesty redhead.  FBI Agent Fornell (Joe Spano) will reluctantly assist Gibbs in a case involving their mutual ex-wife.  And Tony and Ziva will have renewed cause to explore the depths of their partnership, in a case involving Ziva's father.

The tenth season of ""NCIS"" is very highly recommended to its fans.  This reviewer hopes the series isn't getting ready to write its own finale.",1358121600,,2244,5.226256983240224

5238954,4,B00915G6MG,"I am a huge fan of NCIS. Season 10 was turning out to be one of the better seasons in the last few years. They knocked it out of the park this season starting with the finale of the Dearing case from Season 9 and going full steam from there: a strong cast, complex plots, a great combination of whit and drama. They included another episode with Gibbs's ex-wife, Diane, played by Melinda McGraw. She is very funny, and the scenes with her and McGee (Sean Murray) are some of the funniest scenes in many years. Plus, Mark Harmon is awesome in this show.

The only disappointment would be the final episodes are focusing once again on who DiNozzo is sleeping with. It would be nice to keep the focus on crime solving.

I don't know whether the director(s) have changed or the writers no longer have the spark but something is different this year and it results in a less compelling storyline and acting.

since we live in a very rural / mountain area we do not get either satellite nor cable.
we love the characters & with each season they go more in-depth with them.

Not to fault the actors, I think they're doing well with what they've been given.

This season, even more of the same, a lot of stories just seem to be there marking time.

Still fairly enjoyable, but I'm personally close to cancelling my subscription as at this time, I'm not driven to see the episodes as soon as they come out.

NOTHING.we are such huge fans of the show along with it's spin-off NCIS LA.that we watch both diligently every Tuesday night without fail and then purchase the dvd's of both shows when they are released.in closing instead of having to give 5 stars we would not hesitate to give GIBBS AND COMPANY 100 OR MORE STARS for each and every episode from the first ever episode of the show till now.including the 2 part JAG episodes introducing us to GIBBS AND COMPANY.one of Gibb's rules should be watch the show weekly or expect to get slapped on the back of the head like Anthony DiNozzo gets it from THE BOSS every so often.sincerly rickfan.,1350432000,,1008,4.574585635359116
