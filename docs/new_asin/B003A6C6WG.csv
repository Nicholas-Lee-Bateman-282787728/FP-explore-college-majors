4099904,4,B003A6C6WG,"""Does in rain in Scotland all summer?"" asks one of the characters on the run. Yes. It does. Hope Springs hotel is much like several places I've been in, with USED soap gobbed up into inelegant balls for hapless guests to use. This is a far better show than I expected, based on the negative reviews here. There is far less wiggle and jiggle, and far more mystery and character development. Written by women, there's a fair critique of domestic violence, quite sympathetic. Annette Crosbie, of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/An-Unsuitable-Job-for-a-Woman-1-and-2/dp/B000XBPDY4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">An Unsuitable Job for a Woman 1 and 2</a>, is perfection as a fierce old Scottish lady, who slices off the arm of a bad-guy with a sword. The scenery is gorgeous, but there's actually good narrative, until the final scene, that is. The innocent character should have been shown returning home, and there was no need to mislead viewers to thinking all is well on a sunny beach, and then have silly complications result in a likely arrest. Despite this really poor closure to a fun saga, it's worth getting this collection for above-average suspense.",1321920000,2,1195,5.5
4099905,4,B003A6C6WG,"I enjoyed this series a lot. Regrettably its only eight episodes on three discs, and its a buddy movie series for woman, but it was still damned good. It could have rated a second season.

Probably the best part for me are the four woman, escaped cons who somehow pull off the perfect crime, robbing their leader Ellie's husband of three million pounds and fitting him up for the job in the process, and then go from super competent to completely incapable in the space of a single episode. They war with one another constantly, but in the end always stick together, while all of them keep making unbelievable mistakes and suffering one in a million tragedies, such as burning the three million pounds in a house fire, not to mention buying a hotel with a dead body in it.

The writers did a lot of work in bringing these characters to life as tragic victims of past wrongs and portraying those pasts in the way that they act, and the actresses all do top notch jobs in showing those flaws in their characters as well as their strengths. These aren't one dimensional cardboard cut outs by any means. And somehow, despite all the improbable things that happen, and the amazingly bad decisions they make, that makes everything real.

Of course the surprising amount of cleavage shown in the freezing cold Scottish Highlands, the beautiful scenery, and the seemingly endless number of plots, plotters, hotel buyers and sellers, and people who want to kill them, and of course the twisted romance of the local copper and his pregnant soon to be wife, also help.

Definitely it's British humour, always slipping somewhere between the dramatic and the ridiculous, but its well worth watching.

Four solid stars.",1316044800,,1705,4.766101694915254
4099906,2,B003A6C6WG,"I could barely get thru the first couple episodes but it got more interesting as the episodes continued. My main complaint is with the writers; the concept itself may have seemed catchy and great---but it simply isn't at all credible--4 ex-cons who have more loyalty devotion whatever to each other than to attractive men/women on the outside? then suddenly feeling torn to help out the villagers while risking being caught by bad guys or police or whomever? I can't take the character SHoo at all...obnoxious;; the prostitute with a heart of gold---a worn out character type that doesnt ring true. BTW-The highlands will make the sleaziest tart put on a pair of pants and a jacket at least. The character of Josie takes the obligatory swipes at ""Christian"" churches---she was jailed for torching a CHristian church/camp where she had been sent by her parents to overcome her lesbianism--I mean, please----all the right PC touches there. Why couldn't she have been sent to a Muslim madrassa for re-education since lesbianism is against Islam? No it is because Christians won't gut the writers with steak knives like a fanatic Muslim might. Lots of courage in that part of the script! The writers should stretch their imagination muscles a bit more as this offensive portrayal would keep me from ever buying this set. (I rented it - have boycotted buying many good series due to tired PC lefty garble)
The murder mystery, while predictable, keeps one's interest largely due to the excellent actor portraying Euan Harries, really believable and well done. In fact all the actors are superb and do their best considering what they are given to work with. This professionalism combined with gorgeous scenery, make up somewhat for other shortcomings but one must try very hard to suspend disbelief when it comes to the way human nature is portrayed with these 4 women. Enjoyable sort of but wish the writers had been better. Oh Annette Crosbie steals the show---I loved her bit part in Black Books. What a terrific comic! Also wished Ellie's weaselly husband had more scenes, he's definitely gorgeous!",1306800000,4,2096,4.991428571428571
4099907,3,B003A6C6WG,"My wife and I tried to like this. Really. With Alex Kingston and Annette Crosbie and a good supporting cast, it should have worked. But halfway through the third episode, we just couldn't take the character Shoo for one more minute. Even the bad guys were more likable than Shoo. Needy, selfish and stupid - no redeeming characteristics at all. Good acting cannot save bad writing and THAT character was badly written and annoyingly portrayed. Oh, and the scenery was gorgeous.",1286409600,4,477,4.901234567901234
4099908,5,B003A6C6WG,"I purchased this video on a whim because I like the actress Alex Kingston {Doctor Who} and I love the British sense of humor and drama.  This too short series is simply excellent.  Good story, even though it lasted only one season.  Funny!  Well acted!  Well written!  And the ""dark humor: is excellent!  And the actress's aren't bad to look at either",1285200000,5,351,4.564516129032258

I think the writers must have known, or suspected, that the series would not be renewed. They came up with a plot that was more or less resolved by the end of their allotted eight episodes. It starts out with four women being released from prison and immediately executing a major heist. They not only get away with a wad of cash, they do it by double crossing our heroine's husband, a mobster who has been two timing her after she had taken a rap for him, the rotten scoundrel.

Intending to flee to Barbados, the four end up fleeing to the Scottish Highlands and have to lie low for a while. See, there's a cold-blooded assassin after them. (Is it my imagination, or has the movie/TV assassin population grown exponentially lately?) Predictably, but pleasantly, the girls slowly become involved with the quirky population of Hope Springs, even as they make plans to leave as soon as possible. Of course, something always keeps them from leaving and they learn that they are not the only people in town with criminal secrets.

I was not familiar with any of the actors in Hope Springs except for Annette Crosbie, of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Six-Wives-of-Henry-VIII/dp/B000EBD9VM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Six Wives of Henry VIII</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/One-Foot-in-the-Grave/dp/B002BIULNA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">One Foot in the Grave</a>. The casting was excellent  - Alex Kingston was perfect as the gang leader, and the others were as believable as they could be given the outrageous plot lines.

The scenery is beautiful and so are the actors, and as another reviewer noted, the normally cold climate must have abated for the duration of the girls' stay, since they model an apparently limitless wardrobe of low-cut, clingy frocks.

By the time the last episode rolled around, I couldn't imagine how they would tie up all the loose threads, but they did, and it was a heck of a ride. I don't think it would stand up to repeated viewings, though. The weak points in the story would start to show through. So, watch it once, enjoy some grrl power, and secretly root for the criminals to get away with the cash.",1283904000,4,3118,6.40952380952381
4099910,3,B003A6C6WG,"The story did not live up to its potential.  There were too many characters with too many side plots.  Overall, the acting was excellent, especially with the material they had to work with.",1280707200,2,189,4.696969696969697
4099911,5,B003A6C6WG,"Prison food seems to have accentuated 4 women ex-cons' cleavage. Plus their wits & determination. They con the con and run. Unfortunately, instead of Barbados they end up in the Scottish Highlands. Hope Springs and the inn with that name. Seems a good place to lay low, while they get new passports. But trouble starts. There's more trouble in Hope Springs than Midsomer County has murders (Midsomer Murder DVD-TV series). Even multiple murder, like in Midsomer, but in the highlands it all happens differently. Events leave you laughing as much as in suspense. What a fantastic combination for a TV series. But after 8 episodes the story comes full circle, and alas, the series is not continued. For some unreasonable, unexplainable notion, it has never been shown on USA TV, but then it is a recent, 2009, BBC airing. HOPE SPRINGS is new, delightfully different, and this DVD set is the only way you can enjoy it.

My wife gave it 5 1/2 stars while only half way through the series. Men will add an extra 1/2 star for the beautiful babes. These women-of-the-world don't dress like it's cold in the Scottish Highlands. And oh, what scenery, landscape were talking here. Add to that the lovely British and Scottish accents, with SUBTITLES PROVIDED TO HELP. Some funny slang I need to remember to add to my own vocabulary.

The bevy of gals is led by Ellie (Alex Kingston-'ER' 'Moll Flanders') who is brilliant, colorful, and quite convincing as a tough ex-con. But she can get tender for seconds at a time. Her former cellmates include:
Shoo (Christine Bottomley, a blond with a blond brain,
Hannah (Sian Reeves), perhaps the most stable of the pack,
Josie (Vinette Robinson), leggy action-prone beautiful convict.
A highlight, almost stealing the show, is the drinking, original owner of Hope Springs Inn, Sadie (Annette Crosbie-'One Foot in the Grave' 'Little Dorrit'). She is fabulous and makes as remarkable a performance here as in the two mentioned prior appearances (both highly recommended.)

If plans can go wrong, they do, multiple times, in the most humorous and peculiar ways. During all the setbacks, a hit man gets closer to them as his target, the local cop gets closer to solving the local murder(s),and the action jumps quickly from serene highland sheep scenes to sword and gun fights. Don't expect to sleep through any of this set. Plenty of sub-plots for every episode and the primary plot of the gals' escape carries through all 8.

451 minutes total, and you'll wish for 500 more. Unrated but not for the blood squeamish, or if suspense and action causes your heart to flutter. And expect romance mixed with the comedy, suspense, drama, action, and mystery. Oops, that's 6 story forms in one, should have been 6-stars perhaps. Yes girls, there is handsome male actors too, but it's the ladies that shine in the Highlands.",1271116800,28,2843,4.87991718426501

4099916,4,B003A6C6WG,"I purchased this on a whim and enjoyed the series.  It takes place in very scenic Scotland and the performances and storyline are very engaging. Listed as a British drama, but very funny as well.  I would have liked it to continue into another season or series.",1395187200,,261,4.531914893617022
4099917,1,B003A6C6WG,"I agree with the other reviewers who thought the character Shoo was annoying.  The writers gave her no appealing qualities at all.  Time after time she jeopardizes their plans. The other women fix the problem, everything is fine for about 5 minutes, at which there is another crisis. The plot repeatedly cycles through the same antagonists: the corrupt banker who is desperate to buy the Hope Springs Hotel and his equally corrupt son, the jealous snooping daughter of the original owner of the hotel, the original owner of the hotel herself, the handsome police officer who's getting married to the jealous woman but likes Ellie, etc.  Because the interactions are always the same the plot progresses at a snail's pace.  After a while, it's all boring as hell, and you stop caring whether they ever get to Barbados.  This series had potential.  The actors are excellent and did their best with the material they had.  The writing is amateurish.  Attempts to create tension by cycling through one crisis after another are clumsy.  Sometimes even the conversations are identical.

4099919,5,B003A6C6WG,"My daughter (aged 13) and I sat today and watched 5 episodes of Hope Springs all in a row and loved it!  We love the story centered on these 4 women and wished to know more about all of them.  We think it's great that the ladies are trying to get away from the spotlight and lay low only to come to the most busy, police-involved, falling down hotel in Scotland!  We truly enjoyed this and wish Amerian tv had this kind of quality!

We did have to turn on the subtitles because some of the Scottish accents were too much and spoken too fast for us to follow -- especially some of the slang!

Came back out to Amazon to find season 2 and disappointed there wasn't any additional seasons!  There was so much more we wanted to learn about the backstories of the 4 characters and how the continued to cope on 'the outside' and how they continued living in this small community! Loved it, still want more!",1357430400,,900,4.264705882352941

The end of each episode get's you thinking, 'how the heck are they going to get out of that one'!

Full of twists and turns with plenty of drama and comedy to boot.

With a plethera of fine actors, I defy anyone not to enjoy this series. Just a shame that it's not getting a follow up.

This is one of the best shows I have ever seen on the Beeb.

I am so tired of the depressing darkness of so many series these days, this was a refreshing change.  The blonde drove me crazy, but the cast was great And I must say I empathized with the bad luck the women suffered.  It is clear from the beginning that this will not be a straightforward caper film when their partner in crime has the incident at the airport, a LOL moment for me Also laughed out loud at the ""gotcha"" ending, wish they had made another season/story out of it (although sometimes it's good to be left wanting more).

The casting is perfect, the scenery is beautiful, and what the characters lack in criminal mastermind-ery, they make up for in spunk and impetuousness.  They must have known they were getting canceled, because the story arcs do wrap up, which is really nice, though some of the subplots make a sharp left turn in the last few episodes to accommodate this.
