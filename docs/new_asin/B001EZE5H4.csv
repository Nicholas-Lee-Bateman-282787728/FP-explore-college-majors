8300036,3,B001EZE5H4,"We bought this for ""City Slickers"" which is a fun movie. This movie is much better than the other two and we wouldn't buy this bundle again. Billy Crystal is one of our favorite actors. The other two movies are simply fillers - not too good.",1372464000,,241,4.260869565217392
8300037,5,B001EZE5H4,Three of Billy Crystal's best early works. Great price. Awesome service by Amazon. Always love doing business with Amazon. Easy to use.,1320019200,,135,5.181818181818182
8300038,5,B001EZE5H4,"As a Billy Crystal fan, this was a nice find - ""Throw Momma from the Train"", ""City Slickers"", and ""Running Scared"". Three movies in one package, all are anamorphic widescreen, and all are very funny.
There's only one thing I noticed though that, I guess, might disturb anyone who is also a George Carlin fan - in ""Throw Momma from the Train"", when Larry reads the title of a book, his lips form the words ""Women I'd Like to F---"", but what we hear is ""Women I'd Like to Pork"". So we get a DVD with an ""F"" bomb removed, but the ""S"" word still happens. Curious. I guess S is OK, but F isn't? Whatever.",1299283200,4,599,4.172413793103448
8300039,4,B001EZE5H4,If you are a fanatic of Billy Billy get this triple pack. My Favourite is City Slickers with the running scared more of an action movie rather than a comedy.,1296950400,,157,4.266666666666667
