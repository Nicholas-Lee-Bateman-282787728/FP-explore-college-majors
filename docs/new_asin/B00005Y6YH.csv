1674655,5,B00005Y6YH,Good documentary about one of the greatest baseball players.  Well put together and very interesting.,1267833600,,101,5.733333333333333
1674656,5,B00005Y6YH,"If you're expecting a revisionist, unflattering portrait of George Herman 'Babe' Ruth, you won't find it in ""Babe Ruth - The Life Behind the Legend""! With interviews of writers and fans who knew the Babe, and a lot of film footage and still photos from throughout his short (he died at just 53) but amazing life, the film honestly acknowledges his flaws (he missed two months of the 1925 season with syphilis), but reminds viewers that for each fault, he was capable of incredible kindness, as well. He was, ultimately, a big kid, blessed with extraordinary gifts, and this documentary made me wish I'd met him!

While Ruth's baseball years are very well known, most films short-change the events not involving the sport, but happily, this film is an exception. From his troubled childhood, as the incorrigible son of a barkeep who 'gave up' on him, dumping him into a church-run orphanage, to his bittersweet post-baseball life (being denied his dream of managing, and watching cancer destroy his vitality, and ultimately, his life), the film is the most complete biography I've seen.

""Babe Ruth - The Life Behind the Legend"" is a terrific addition to any sports fan's collection!",1256428800,3,1182,4.934673366834171
1674657,4,B00005Y6YH,"If you enjoy sports legend biographies, this DVD is worth owning. It runs about 45 minutes with excellent commentary from actor Liev Schreiber (X-Men Origins: Wolverine). An orginal HBO special, it did not gloss over some of the less desirable events in Babe Ruth's life (look at today's sports heroes for comparison). But no one can deny that on the field, he set standards that are still admired today. Sixty plus years since his passing, the Babe still knocks them out of the park!",1245542400,,484,4.773809523809524
1674658,5,B00005Y6YH,This is a great Babe Ruth documentary!  I bought it as a gift for my boyfriend and he loved it!  He watched it twice in 2 days.  It really does a great job of explaining and illustrating the life of Babe Ruth.  Has lots of photos and video clips and stories from Babe's friends.  Good narration too!,1212796800,,299,4.175438596491228
1674659,2,B00005Y6YH,"There was so much more to Babe's life than this documentary shows..There is next to nothing about his relationship to Lou Gehrig, Miller Huggins, his wives, Father Tobias (spelling may be off) who changed his life,,his barnstorming trips where his All Star teams played against some of the great black players of those days like Stachel Paige...
The first 20 minutes consist of a verbal tribute from some very old gentlemen...it was tribute..homerun..tribute..homerun..tribute..homerun etc..that went on and on...we didn't have to be told over and over that he was a great player...About one fourth of the film is VERY interesting...but generally a real disappointment",1200614400,9,668,5.4326923076923075
1674660,5,B00005Y6YH,"This is the best documentary I have seen on Babe Ruth.  It includes tons of video of Ruth.  It even includes a home movie of him pointing on the ""called shot"".  Excellent insights into who he was and what drove him including comments from contemporaries, family and former teammates.  If you want to know who Babe Ruth was, buy this and find out.",1151366400,,346,4.444444444444445
1674661,5,B00005Y6YH,"Unique, never before seen clips and stories. Very balanced and skilled in representing Ruth with his strengths and weaknesses. This vhs represents his life from reform school to death.

Indicates how he influenced America during the hard times and changed baseball forever. Despite Ruth's rough life style his talents and popularity are unprecedented and unquestioned. This was the age before good equipment (bats, gloves, etc), and strength enhancing drugs.

Very good narration and dialogue on this vhs. Highly recommend it for baseball and history fans alike. There will never be another Ruth and he's the proof and that's the truth. Look how his totality of records have stood the test of time and are the measure to which others are compared.

This is my favorite baseball documentary for the subject matter, quality, balance, nostalgia, historical setting, etc.

An hour well spent.",1118793600,11,888,5.276595744680851
1674662,5,B00005Y6YH,I've watched this DVD time and time again.  The people who knew him really give some insight here as to what kind of player and person Babe Ruth was.,1102896000,,149,4.137931034482759
1674663,5,B00005Y6YH,"For those of us who who grew up and still feel the Babe as mythical, this is great DVD coverage of the player who proved unbelievable as a human being.  Coverages of games and warm ups attempt to bring the seriousness of the organized game since it was still a time when baseball was fun and fantasy.  Yet the babe made it look so easy.  With players still alive who played with him, a perfectly biographed story from beginning to end and garunteed to watch more than twice.",1065312000,7,474,4.363636363636363
1674664,4,B00005Y6YH,This is quite frankly the finest documentary on the life and times of Babe Ruth that I've seen. I was mesmorized from start to finish; an absolute gem and a must for any Babe Ruth fan.,1012003200,9,184,4.138888888888889
7956374,5,B00005Y6YH,"Being both a baseball fan and obsessed historian, this holds up as one of the best documentaries about a legendary player who helped make the game what it is today. With such an amazing soundtrack (I would often fall asleep with the DVD playing and hear the theme play over the DVD menu, such pleasant music to listen to while sleeping), and excellent interviews by journalists, authors, teammates, and even actors who saw him play. Sadly, many of these interviewers are no longer with us (which include Chicago newspaper journalists Bill Gleason and Ben Bentley, Studs Terkel as well as Jean Shepherd (the narrator from A Christmas Story) and author Robert Creamer, May They All Rest in Peace). True, it's only an hour long and many events in Babe Ruth's life were overlooked,  but if you were to go into great detail into the man's life, it would probably be as long as Ken Burns' PBS Baseball Documentary. I have seen many Baseball Documentaries produced by HBO and they all have been excellent. Babe Ruth's Documentary is highly recommend to anyone who has the slightest bit of interest in baseball or Babe Ruth. In addition to this, I also highly recommend Ken Burns' PBS Documentary Series as well as the HBO Documentaries on Joe DiMaggio, Mickey Mantle and the three part Documentary, ""When It Was a Game"" which consists mostly of home movies shot by fans from the mid 30s all the way through the 1960s!",1517011200,,1410,4.7317073170731705
7956375,5,B00005Y6YH,Accurate portrayal & excellent. Has more home movie clips and interviews from former friends and team members,1509753600,,109,5.470588235294118

7956380,1,B00005Y6YH,I ordered a 1991 TV movie and received a Babe Ruth documentary. Very dissatisfied.,1435017600,,82,4.928571428571429
