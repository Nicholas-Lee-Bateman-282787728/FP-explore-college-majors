8503456,4,B006QZQBTW,"My experience with minor brand DVD companies (such as this unidentified one) has been satisfactory, as I'm not interested in commentary, deleted scenes or other bonus features, that is, stuff these discs don't offer. Transfers are ""best available source"" and quality can vary from very good to only fair.

.
WE'RE IN THE LEGION NOW (1936) was shot in a bi-pack process called Magnacolor. This dual strip format skewed the spectrum. Unable to capture purple and pink shades, Caucasian faces tend to look florid or orange in Magnacolor.

Most DVD dubs of ""Legion"" are from old b&w 16mm TV broadcast films. As ""COLOR"" isn't specified here, chances are it isn't.

Set in Morocco, ""Legion"" is partly filmed in rockily shrub-dotted rural California. Thus, Arab attackers look as out of place here as if they were on the moon. (Come to think of it, a lunarscape might appear more like the desert!) Reginald Denny is equally out of place. In a failed attempt to play a gruff NY gangster, his polished British diction is all-too obvious.

Comic relief (such as it is) comes from Vince Barnett. His character's lifelong habit of tossing empty wine and booze bottles behind his back ultimately saves the day for both him and the equally hard-drinking Denny.

The plot in a nutshell: two small-timers escape their mob enemies by enlisting for a 5-year stretch in the French Foreign Legion. Unwilling to adapt to military life, they constantly break rules and receive drudge duty as punishment. After a number of infractions, the miscreant New Yawkahs get 6-months of hard labor at a remote work camp. It's run by a crazed martinet (Frank Hoyt) who revels in working men to death in the broiling desert sun.

When one man too many dies from this adjutant's abuse, our heroes front an insurrection that's interrupted by attacking Arabs. Will they be killed in battle, or face a firing squad for mutiny? A canteen carelessly tossed over a shoulder decides these issues.

Also in the cast are Esther Ralston, Eleanor Hunt and Claudia Dell, plus Rudolph Anders as the boys' tough-as-steel sergeant and Robert Frazer as the captain they managed to get on the wrong side of back in New York.",1358899200,,2172,4.854054054054054
8503457,4,B006QZQBTW,"SINISTER CINEMA is a niche market DVD-R mfr. that specializes in hard-to-find motion pictures. They offer no bonus features such as commentary or deleted scenes. Dubs are from unrestored film stock, thus quality varies with condition of their antique celluloid. None are pristine, yet none are so degraded as to be unviewable.

The only other DVD dub of ""Legion"" that I'm aware of is transferrred from a b&w 16mm TV broadcast film, so SINISTER's 35mm version is a real coup for them. The movie itself is another matter.
