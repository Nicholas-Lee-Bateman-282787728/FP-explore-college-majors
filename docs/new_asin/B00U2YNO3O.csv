8704213,4,B00U2YNO3O,"""The story of a lifetime"" as a headline for this DVD is a bit of a stretch.  This marvelous artist is truly talented, but she IS, in fact, only 21 years old, so the story of a lifetime line is a bit much.  The DVD is simply a series of interviews that Meghan did and, yes, it does basically piece together her ""story"".  So while I enjoyed hearing about her ""story"", much of it has yet to be written.  Meghan, you are an amazing talent because not only are you a beautiful young lady on the outside, you are a beautiful soul as well and, your talent will take you far as well.  I see success in many areas of life for you!  All the best to you.",1436918400,5,643,3.984375
