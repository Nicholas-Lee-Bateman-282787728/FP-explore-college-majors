1030084,5,6305419639,"ohh yeah! This is a great classic, pre-Akira anime. The comedyis great and the story builds....
its actually a good thing theyincluded 4 acts on one dvd ... .... as my freind did after watching only the firt two acts which i personally loved....(It would have been like the trigun release disaster....I personally loved the first trigun tape but many disagree.....the whole series is the bomb a must see... just like this one)",989712000,,426,4.8493150684931505
1030085,4,6305419639,"I was actually amazed to discover at the end of act 4 that I'd watched the whole thing.  Tank Police is set in 4 acts, but in fact there are two stories on this disk.  The first story, in acts 1 and 2, set up the characters, the environment, and the internal conflict about the Tank Police.  The second story, in acts 3 and 4, are about the criminal Buaku, his origins, and being human.
In act 1 and 2, the reasons for the crime isn't explained at all, and isn't alluded to at all in acts 3 and 4.  Big mystery.  The slapstick is sorta funny.  The tanks look rediculous, but around about the middle of act 2, you no longer notice.  You feel for Leona, exiled to welfare for wrecking Squad Commander's ""tank special"".  You feel a little amazed that she is allowed to build a little tank out of the wrecked tank after this order is given.  (But never mind, it wouldn't be nearly as fun later if she wasn't around.)  This first story, qualified this DVD as ""just another anime"".  Fortunately, there were two more acts.
The later acts start out vague, but riveted me to my seat.  I couldn't have torn myself away from the tube if I'd wanted to.  The back-story about Buaku and his reasons for stealing the picture are deeper than I was willing to give this anime credit for.  Then the interaction between Leona and Buaku as the story comes out is nothing short of magical.  Leona is forced to see this hated criminal, who she can't make a deal with to save her life because she is a ""tank police"", as a person.  And Buaku sees that not all humans are bad, sparing Leona's life even though she wouldn't make the deal.
The animation is okay, with some shots seemingly stills with enhanced flashing bits to make them ""move"".  Not as dreadful as some, and never a whole scene.
As for technical merits, the menus are easy to follow, the transfer is good enough average. Sound is mono, but maybe thats all there ever was.
And finally, I must mention that if you are into lowbrow humor that none of us would ever be caught dead actually laughing at (we are all grown-up here, right?) buy this one for the ""anti tank"" weapons in act 2.  Absolutly hillarious!",984268800,10,2146,4.349246231155779
1030086,2,6305419639,"When I first purchased this DVD movie, I had fond memories of the first Anime I ever saw. Dominion Tank Police had a good storyline first captured my attention a few years ago. When I watched the DVD, I was disappointed. Not because of the storyline, or music, but because the DVD conceals the nudity found in the original version in very uncreative ways that are very distracting from the plot. For example, objects are placed in front of the offending areas in ways that would have you beg for black bars instead. Because one of the most important features in a DVD is the Extra features, I consider ANY omission, or concealment to severely hurt the value of a DVD.",983059200,27,667,4.520661157024794
1030087,5,6305419639,"I just recenlty bought this DVD and I must say, it is an excellent buy. I am not a hugh fan of Anime, but this one is definitely worth a second look.
The story is set in a future world where huge amounts of pollution has made the earth's air unbreathable and everyone must wear a mask to avoid brathing in the toxic gases.  The crime rate has risen to a crime being committed every 36 seconds and the mayor forms an elite fighting force know as the ""Tank Police"".  When a new crime gang (Led by the Cyborg, Buaku and the Cat Sisters, Anna & Uni Puma) wrecks havoc in Newport city, young Leona Ozaki is transferred to the ""Tank Poilce"" squad.  After wrecking the ""Squad Commander's"" (Charles Brenten) personal armored tank, Leona hand-makes a small Mini-tank (Nicknamed: Bonaparte) out of parts of the ""Squad Commander's"" own Tank.  This new mini-Tank is a force to be reckoned with as it goes head to head with the criminals in an awesome action packed showdown.
Orginally released in Japan in 1989 as a two part movie.  (The movie was later dubbed to English and released in the U.S. in 1993), the movie is clearly Anime at it's finest (With no computer graphic effects).  The DVD includes both parts (All 4 acts) and features dual languages (English and Japanese.  I recommend that people watch the film in the Japanese version becuase some dialog and music is deleted/changed in the English version.)  Filled with lots of action sequence and hilarious one-liners, that will keep you on the edge of your seat, ""Diminion: Tank Police"" is no Saturday morning cartoon.",979257600,14,1567,4.6521739130434785
1030088,5,6305419639,"Dominion Tank Police is a series of 4 OAV's that are each very, VERY amusing and action-packed. I bought this DVD and instantly became enamored with the series' absolutely hilarious, if not a bit stereotypical, characters. The main character, Leona Ozaki, is transferred from the beat into the Tank Police, and things quickly start getting blown to pieces. I enjoyed the antics of all the characters, from the trigger-happy Commander Briton (lifetime subscriber to ""How to Kill!"" magazine), to the playful -if not a wee bit homicidal- tendencies of the Puma sisters.
The animation is good, considering it was done 11 years ago in 1989. There is not a bit of computer animation to be seen here, but that is part of the series' charm. The DVD itself has no authoring problems, and the audio is good on both the English and the Japanese language tracks, but I recommend the Japanese track because the background music on the English track is dubbed as well, and it isn't exactly top-notch quality. But, that aside, This DVD is a fine addition to any anime fan's collection.
I highly recommend this series to anyone who enjoys a good romp filled with tanks, explosions, and rampant building demolition. You will NOT be disappointed!",971654400,3,1228,4.880382775119617
1030089,3,6305419639,"O.K. this DVD was alright.  The movie was good, but the DUB sound track was way off.  If you liked the orginal soundtrack you're better off seeing  this DVD in Japanese.  They changed the songs.  Example: the part where the  girls strip, the orginal was a cool sexy slow song, but the DUB version  sounds like pure rock and ruins the mood.",967593600,2,339,4.370967741935484
1030090,5,6305419639,"While you'll hear fans of the manga of the same name say how disappointed they are with this anime, it has got to be arguably one of the better ones in my collection. The story is not overly complex, but contains some subtle  points that I'll admit I missed until watching it again most recently; most  definitely, you will want to watch the Japanese dub (with English  subtitles, if needed), as it contains most of the finer points the English  version misses. The animation is not hyper-realistic, but, then again, it  is not supposed to be; there is a delightful cartoonish quality about the  whole piece. It is this quality that allows for quite a bit of visual  humor. Keep as notice, though, that there is some adult humor in here as  well that may offend some, but it all lends itself to the humor of the  movie. Overall, I'd have to rate this as one of my favorite anime; it's a  good two-hour romp filled with tanks, more tanks, explosions, accidental  urban renewal, and all of it in good fun.",957744000,5,1003,4.486187845303867
1030091,5,6305419639,"Language selections very easy to use. A subtitled and dubbed way to watch the movie giving you the original music, and original voices in the subtitled version, and new music (not much.. lots of repeats but good) and  the english voices. Great animation, great characters, great stories.  Nothing at all disapointing.",932688000,3,317,5.196078431372549

I read a couple reviews online which totally panned this anime; my impression was that the reviewers actually took it seriously.  First, the art style follows Shirow's very well.  If he didn't help with the animation, the artists who worked on the anime certainly copied his style well.  The English voice acting generally fit the personalities of Shirow's characters well, though Leona's seemed a bit high... anyway, the story is broken into four acts.  All four have quite a lot of violence, though with one exception no one is actually wounded or hurt--just lots of property damage.  One scene has a bit of semi-nudity, but that's it.  No really mature themes here; it's a comedy with some serious moments in the last act.  The anime serves as a prequel to Shirow's manga, with the first half providing a background for Leona, Bonaparte and the Tank Police, and the second half going into the background of Buaku (and his gang).  While I liked the music (disco/techno), I suppose it's a matter of taste.  I thought the first two acts were more light-hearted and funny, and the second two had a more serious tone--also a slower pace.",1201219200,,1292,5.388059701492537
1030149,5,6305419639,"This is one of primary Masamune Shirow's works
Many people (but not me) state Wachowski brothers borrowed some ideas from Shirow's GITS for ""Matrix"" movie. And the brothers themselves at least admit they know and like Shirow's works.

That's why I am too curious why no mention of Shiro here, even in product details section.",1181779200,,325,4.909090909090909
1030150,5,6305419639,I love this movie it brings back memory as when I was younger when I first saw it... Those were the good old days.  This is how anime looked in the 80s; one would argue that this is a/one of the benchmarks of anime.  I'm not an anime collector but this is a movie that should be in the shelves of anyone who loves anime.  I recommend this.,1181174400,,339,3.9558823529411766
1030151,4,6305419639,Really cool show. Pretty neat characters and a okay plot. I think what I liked best about this title was the music. But then again I love stuff from the 80's.,1147824000,2,158,4.129032258064516
1030152,5,6305419639,"The heros of Dominion are the Tank Police, formed with a ""if we can't beat crime, we'll get bigger guns"" philosophy, and who are, like the name suggests, patrolling the city in tanks instead of patrol cars, and who are actually far more dangerous than any criminals they are trying to catch.",1142121600,2,291,4.615384615384615
1030153,2,6305419639,"Dominion Tank Police is a four part mini-series anime about a ficticious city called, Newport. Newport City has terribly polluted air which looks hazy and full of visable smog; so the citizens have to wear gas masks if they go onto the streets. Another problem of Newport was too much crime taking place. Regular police could not handle that much crime, so the local government develops a new police unit called ""Tank Police"". A new recruit named, Leona entered the, Tank Police as a rookie and we get to see a lot of her. Then we follow the the crime of one particular gang and its leader named, Buaka. Later we learn that Buaka was part of a secret government experiment which he escaped from. The Puma Sisters were always getting into mischief. I thought the overall idea of using tanks to fight crimes was kind of silly, but I guess the creators were trying to validate the amount of destruction as action sequences when a tank fired a shot and caused large explosions and even hit buildings by accident. I did not like, Buaka's storyline, being part of an experiment, it was weak and boring. I just didn't care for his character adding to the fact that, Buaka kinda looks like an ape- and the worst part is that a large chunk of time goes to him and his stupid story. I wanted to know more about the main character, Leona, but little background was given on her. Another thing I didn't like was the fact that the Tank Police didn't really do any police work; instead they just blasted things with their tank's gun all the time. One thing I enjoy was the artwork. I loved that cyber-punk, futuristic design, hazy cityscape and organic metal design of the buildings. The character designs were excellent (except for Buaka) and the animation very fluid. This anime was created in the early 90's and still looks great even by today's standard! And that says a lot. The English subtitles were easy to read and the translation look right. The voice acting was good in both English and Japanese. The sound effects were good and the music was upbeat and sometimes atmospheric which I enjoyed. Overall I thought this was a decent anime, although I didn't like the story too much because of, Buaka. Okay for teens and adults. The series ends on episode four and returns in a new (and improved) series called ""New Dominion Tank Police"".",1127001600,9,2330,4.603365384615385
1030154,4,6305419639,"Although this anime has obviously been around for a while and the story is a bit complex at first, this is one of the best animes I've seen. It's entertaining and fun to look at with some great gags and some pretty interesting characters.
One of my only complaints is that the story could use a little more continuity, which I hear the manga has. Unfortunately, I've never had the opportunity to see one.
The final verdict is that this is an excellent anime and very, very fun to watch.",1086998400,6,486,4.411111111111111
1030155,5,6305419639,"160 minutes of tanks, androids, crime, secret government projects, ruthless mercenaries and adult humor.
In this DVD we see Leona on her first day as a Tank Police Officer.  We get to see how her mini-tank (toy tank), Bonaparte, came to be made and we also learn a lot more about Greenpeace's AND Buaku's background.  We also get to see the Puma sisters in action, in more ways than one!
The DVD has some extras, besides cool character profiles which are selected clips from the Acts (which help you get an idea about each character - the Puma sisters get four clips while everybody else only gets one), they have the Director's comments (that only fits one page) and the normal previews.  They also have a tiny fold out of, you guessed it, the Puma sisters on the white motorbikes, armed to the teeth and wearing Cheesecake armour (the stuff that looks like a biker babe's outfit).  If you have the manga, Dominion: Tank Police, you need to see this at least once!",1078185600,7,965,4.5606936416184976
1030156,5,6305419639,"Dominion Tank Police is criminally overlooked by anime fans and companies too seeing how New Dominion Tank Police still hasn't been released on DVD.
You get 2 stories on the DVD - Acts 1 & 2 introduce the characters and Acts 3 & 4 tell the history of gang leader Buaku.
In a world where the sky is so polluted you have to wear breathing masks or risk death, the criminals ran riot, until the cops started to fight back with Tanks! It follows the exploits of ex Motorbike cop Leona Ozaki as she tries to fit in with Lt Britain's extreme method of policing.  Once she wrecks his prized tank she rebuilds it into a cute mini tank much to Britain's fury. But Britain himself is a bit of a softie really, especially when Leona shows she can handle things in some great encounters between the Tank Police and Buaku's gang.
The animation is ok for the time and depending on if you watch it dubbed or subbed you'll get different songs and character names.  It's highly enjoyable either way as it's a great action packed and funny anime.  Keep a lookout for New Dominion Tank Police as once you've seen this you'll want more Tank Police action",1063584000,,1134,4.416267942583732
1030157,4,6305419639,"To see Dominion Tank Police out on DVD is great.  NOt only is it incredibly creative and awesome with it characters and mass wide destruction, but incredibly hilarious.  Leona leads the charge for the Tank Police against Buaku and the Puma twins causing untold destruction in her effort to prove that woman can handle being in the tank police, leading you into hysterical laughter!  And lets not forget about the red commandos..This just a show you have to see with your own eyes.",1031270400,,480,4.759036144578313
