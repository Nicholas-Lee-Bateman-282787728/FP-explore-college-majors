4184394,3,B003RD7QR2,"volunteered at long term care facility for a woman approx 100yo who lived thru this and let me tell you it was the only thing she could discuss and could only imagine the tragedy experienced so long ago and the effect it had on family, friends, lost everything and sent to live in 'camps', I never knew anything about this piece of history and would have enjoyed more of the background and motivation for the uprising and impending soviet occupation and much less of the love story and Yul yakking... Having known several higher level soviet officials who ended up in Hungary makes me wonder how much involved they were with this operation, and how proud they seemed to be, indoctrination is only slightly touched on and can account for some actions, however this type of inhumane treatment occurs worldwide and makes me stop complaining living in US.",1341705600,3,851,4.756756756756757

4184413,5,B003RD7QR2,"I will admit up front that I am partial toward any film that stars Yul Brynner and I am absolutely addicted to any film starring both Mr. Brynner and Deborah Kerr.  There is something about these two on film that electrify the plot of the screenplay.  Smoldering passion, desire, restrained to the breaking point of emotion and reason -- all of it can be viewed in the films they did together.  ""The Journey"" has such a bittersweet ending, one that is inevitable from the very moment he looked at her.  From the first time I saw this film, I knew that one day I would own it.  I am so very thankful it has finally appeared on dvd.  If you are interested in films that deal with the political tensions that have haunted our way of existence since Man picked up the jawbone of an ass and killed another human being, then this film is a must.  IF you understand what God had in mind when he created man and woman, this film is a must.",1423872000,6,931,4.255681818181818
4184414,4,B003RD7QR2,"This somewhat under noticed film does suffer from a dated look and style, and sometimes Brynner is a bit over the top, but still, wow.  He and Kerr had a special chemistry on screen and you can really see it here as a simple man of humble origins is confronted by a woman from his dreams and a woman trying to convince herself she should be repulsed, when she is not.  The final confrontations, filled with surprising tenderness say it all.  A must see for a Yul fan, and a classic performance from Kerr as a frightened woman facing fear and primal needs.",1421884800,4,555,4.368932038834951

4184423,5,B003RD7QR2,"I was thrilled to find ""The Journey"" on DVD.  I first saw it in an elegant opera-house style theater 2 years after I became a US citizen at age 8.

 I saw the Hungarian Revolution in a hard way.  I was the child of Hungarians. I had friends who were Freedom Fighters and heard their stories. I saw the photos of Soviet tanks and people lying dead.  I read ""the Bridge At Andau,  And my heart hurt.  My people - and I couldn't help.

"" The Journey""  was the first time I had seen anyone o the other side as human.  Yul Brynner was incredible as Major Surov- cold, cruel, unyielding.  I was impressed the way Brynner slowly revealed the complex layers of the Russian commander. A soldier totally committed to Soviet ideology;  yet he was so  drawn to Deborah Kerr's Lady Ashmore,  he heldup the interrogated travelers' release.  You see the cracks in his armor as he becomes infatuated with Lady Ashmore.  I love the dinner scene where the Major shows bits and pieces of his tightly held emotions as he tries to woo the lady.  Ah! there is nothing better than hearing Yul Brynner sing.

 Passion becomes caring.  Perhaps it would be more if times were different.  At last, you see the  military machine become a human being.  He could arrest Lady Ashmore Lady Ashmore's freedom fighter, lover, Paul Kedes.  But Major Surov breaks with his imbedded beliefs and releases the all the refugees.  It is a poignant moment as he watches Lady Ashmore & Kedes escape to Austria in a small skiff.  The human draws on his cigarette-the pain of love and lost love.",1400198400,14,1550,4.505415162454874

4184431,5,B003RD7QR2,"I have been waiting for this film for a long time. I consider it a classic because of the stellar cast and the historic background. It takes place during the Hungarian uprising of 1956, a group of English and Americans are trying to leave the country to get to safely across the border to Austria. Yul Brynner excellently plays the role of a Russian officer who must decide their fate; he is immediately attracted to Deborah Kerr, one of the travelers, and its up to her to persuade him to let the group leave.

Deborah Kerr plays the lovely English lady smuggling a Hungarian agent from under the Russian Commander of the
area. The Russian Commander is played by a complicated man, Yul Brynner. Trapped in a hotel with other people
who want to reach the Austrian border...a romance develops mainly on Yul's part toward Deborah. She is the type
of woman that is unaccessable to him. Besides , a good story, they are trapped with an excellent cast.
Robert Morley,Jason Robards Jr. to name a few. The story takes place more than fifty years ago but with acting

Deborah Kerr's character shines with integrity, among a loathsome group of cowards who would throw her to the wolf (Yul Brenner) to save their skins.  And Yul Brenner's Soviet commandant redeems himself with bold and tragic integrity, and leaves one saddened and enobled at the end.  Fabulous movie.",1363651200,18,464,4.691358024691358

Worth watching over and over just to enjoy the connection between Yul Brynner and Deborah Kerr.  Same thing was on spectacular display in The King and I.

I don't think they even make movie stars like these two anymore.

4184444,5,B003RD7QR2,I really like this film. Brynner is great as the Russian Major. Supporting cast is colorful and animated. The drama is dated by today's standards but still holds up well. A good entertainer.,1346025600,,190,4.787878787878788
4184445,4,B003RD7QR2,"How will Lady Ashmore save her Hungarian freedom fighting lover from the cruel clutches of the evil Soviet Major? That's the central question in this 1959 MetroColor romance/adventure story set against the background of the 1956 Hungarian Revolution.

Versatile Yul Brenner (1920-85) plays the Russian Major. Brenner could play an Egyptian Prince (""The 10 Commandments""), a Jewish King (""Solomon and Sheba""), a gunslinger (""The Magnificent Seven""), an Asian (""The King and I""), a robot (""Westworld""), and a Ukrainian warlord (""Taras Bulba""). In 1956 he received the distinction of a NBR Award for his performances in 3 films - ""The King and I"", ""Anastasia"", and ""The 10 Commandments"", and won the Oscar that year for ""The King and I"".

Deborah Kerr (1921-2007) plays Lady Ashmore. Kerr was nominated 6 times for an Oscar (""Sundowners"", ""Separate Tables"", ""Heaven Knows Mr. Allison"", ""The King and I', ""From Here to Eternity"", ""Edward My Son"") but never won.

FWIW - Kerr and Brynner had been in the highly successful ""The King and I"" three years earlier, but their chemistry in that film is not re-captured here. Apparently the chemistry was there for Brynner and director Litvak who also teamed to make the highly successful ""Anastasia"" (1956).

Jason Robards Jr. (1922-2000) debuts as a Hungarian freedom fighter. The son of a popular film star from the 20s and 30s, Robards won two Oscars (""All the President's Men"", ""Julia""), received the Best Actor Award at Cannes in 1962 for ""Long Day's Journey Into Night"", and won an Emmy for ""Inherit the Wind"" (1988).

Kerr and Robards are two passengers on a bus bound from Budapest to Vienna, stopped at a customs check point controlled by Brynner. Some of the other passengers include -

E.G. Marshall (1914-1998) plays an American family man. Marshall had 150 film and TV appearances to his credit and won 2 Emmys for his TV series ""The Defenders"". I remember him best in ""12 Angry Men"" (1957).

Robert Morley (1908-92) plays an English TV producer. Morley was nominated for a Golden Globe for ""Who's Killing the Great Chefs of Europe"" (1978), but personally I thought his best performance was as the missionary in ""The African Queen"" (1951).

Look for 5 year old Ron Howard in his second film, and just one year before he gained fame on ""The Andy Griffith Show"".

The film was produced and directed by Anatole Litvak (1902-74), a Ukranian born Jew. Litvak is best known for his work on ""The Snake Pit"" (1948) for which he was nominated for an Oscar and a DGA. He was nominated for a second time for ""Decision Before Dawn"" (1951). Litvak made several anti-Nazi films (e.g., ""Divide and Conquer"", ""The Nazis Strike"", ""The Battle of Russia"", ""War Comes to America"", ""Night of the Generals"").

In 1959 the big money makers were ""Ben Hur"", ""Sleeping Beauty"", ""North by Northwest"", ""Some Like it Hot"", and ""Pillow Talk"". The big Oscar winner was ""Ben Hur"" (Picture, Director, Actor, Supporting Actor). Other notable films released that year include ""Room at the Top"", ""The Diary of Anne Frank"", ""The 39 Steps"", ""The 400 Blows"", ""Anatomy of a Murder"", and ""The Last Angry Man"".

The NY Times called the film ""an absorbing romantic adventure film.""
The direction is good, but the script is a little long. The photography is excellent and the acting by the ensemble cast is great. Brynner, of course, steals every scene but Morley and Krazner also do a good job.

Only two films have been made about the Hungarian Revolution - ""Children of Glory"" (2006) and ""Revolution's Orphans (1979) - so this makes this Hollywood feature film a rare treat. Of course abuses of occupying troops has been covered in many many films, and often in much better detail. There is little that is specifically ""Hungarian"" in the film, and this might as easily been any occupied country at any time.

Bottom line - a good drama and character study about a time that is rarely filmed.",1345248000,17,3901,4.883509833585476

Yul was an UFO among others actors of  his generation,and there will never be another one like him again.

8403549,5,B003RD7QR2,"Notable cold war drama. A bit overwritten, and melodramatic, but the cast is excellent, Brenner and Kerr give full throated performances that are genuine and affecting. The various characters are well developed for a large cast and the most unique aspect is the bold, willing to delve with some complexity and realism, story, authentically filmed. Only God knows in the years of the appalling 20th century the millions upon millions of war and border crossing stories that have unfolded unknown, unspoken, tragic. Definitely worth watching. Kerr is luminous. Brenner masculine and emotionally expressive. One off note is the awkward presentation of the American family and characters, well acted by Jackson and Marshall, but awkwardly written and caricatured while the other characters are not. Unfortunate. Saw it on Warner Archive streaming. Also unfortunate, is that it appears the screen presentation is off, like one is not seeing the full picture; it's clear no director would film cutting peoples hats off or weirdly from the waist up, or if you go to the trouble of actually filming on the austrohungarian border that you would cut it out of your film.
Love WW2, cold war, espionage, spy, political films and novels. If you have any to suggest, let me know. Also check out the excellent The Counterfeit Traitor with the ever handsome William Holden and beautiful Lilli Palmer in a great film.",1485043200,,1400,5.117903930131004
