208232,4,6163876032,This is a very entertaining little film. I loved it. It's honest and clean. No sexual overtones which really just kinda gave it a pure sweet feel.,1178409600,5,146,4.444444444444445
208233,5,6163876032,"Based on a true story, ""Densha Otoku (literally translated as ""Train Man"")"" is the kind of romance that could only happen in Japan.  Partly due to the ubiquitous nature of 2-channel, a country-encompassing internet chat board that puts things like MySpace and YouTube to shame. Partly due to the otaku, a style of unsocial misfit that could only be cultured in the group-based society of Japan.

I should say ostensibly based on a true story. Although the real Train Man and Hermes have never been identified, the origin of the phenomenon is a fact.  What is known for sure is that, a poster known as Densha Otoku started a thread on 2-channel telling about how he helped a woman on a train who was being harassed by some drunk salaryman. In gratitude, she sent him a set of teacups from Hermes department store, which would be the equivalent of Saks Fifth Avenue or Harrods in London.  Thinking that the value of the gift is far greater than the service he performed, Densha Otoku sought advice from his fellow otakus on 2-channel on what to do.  And the legend was born.

There have been many adaptations of the popular story, starting with a book that reproduced the 2-channel posts, then a comic book and a TV series.  This movie, starring Takayuki Yamada and Miki Nakatani, presents the whole story and does an excellent job showing the fairy tale nature of the romance.  Densha Otoku is not a bad guy, just socially awkward and someone who never really learned how to relate to women.  His moment of bravery is nothing daring, and he is no hero, but the small gesture of protection is just what is needed at just the right moment. Miki Nakatani, a mid-level pop star in Japan, is perfect as Hermes,. She is not a great beauty, just a sweet woman who seems to have had her share of bad luck with men, and is willing to give a nice guy a chance.

Aside from the two leads, much of real charm of ""Densha Otoku"" are the 2-channelers themselves.  Swept up completely in the story, they swarm the fashionable districts of Tokyo, studying up on English tea and fashionable places to buy suits and go to dinner, all so they can give the best advice to our wayward hero.  Showing the isolated nature of modern Japan, a husband and wife are both equally involved in the internet events, all though neither one realizes that their partner is also online.  Hiding under the masks of screen names, so many modern Japanese people lead secret lives on 2-channel, and it took the story of Train Man and Hermes to break them out of their shells and get them back into the living world.

I'm glad to see ""Densha Otoku"" get an English-language DVD release.  This is a film that I had admired for some time, and it was always a shame that I couldn't share it with my non-Japanese speaking friends and family.",1175126400,7,2794,4.53784860557769
208234,4,6163876032,"This is a sweet romantic comedy.  The geek falls for the pretty girl and must find away to win her with the help of his internet friends.  All the characters are quite interesting and you really start to root for train man by the end. There are a few scenes that are a little difficult for an American audience to get culturally speaking, but overall it is very cute.  I would highly recommend it to people who like quirky movies and quirky romances.",1174176000,5,450,4.397590361445783
208235,4,6163876032,"I watched this with my wife, brother, sister-in-law and niece. At least half the people who watched it are not huge foreign film fans [the movie is subtitled only.] However, everyone enjoyed it, frequently laughing-out-loud. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars [it warrants 4 1/2] is because the main male character is too much of a wimp and the main female is too much of an ice-queen. However, an argument could be made that perhaps she's as dysfunctional as him; but we just don't see the relationship from her viewpoint.",1173744000,7,529,4.698924731182796
208236,5,6163876032,"This movie is a story about how the Internet can influence the lives of its users, both positively and negatively. Train Man (hereafter referred to as Densha Otoko) is a 22-23yo otaku [anime geek] who's never had a relationship in his life. This suddenly when he helps save a beautiful woman from a drunkard on the train ride home. That's where he gets his name from.

From there, Densha goes onto 2chan, the Internet's largest bulletin board system forum. He asks for advice and eventually, thousands of people across the net encourages him and cheers him on as he fights the standards and himself in his quest for true love.

This story is apparently true, but after hearing the commentary, I would say it's existence on the Internet is totally true...but in real life? I'm not so sure. However, whether it actually is true or not, the story of Densha Otoko changed thousands of lives across Japan and even the world.

If you love romance and don't mind English subtitles in a foreign film, then this film is a pure delight. Highly highly recommended.",1173312000,9,1053,4.711956521739131
208237,2,6163876032,"Yes, they've made a movie out of Densha Otoko, but it hasn't the heart of the original television series.  Whereas on the show, comedy was mixed in with emotion for the genuinely geeky otaku, in this film, they've basically take a pretty boy Japanese actor, put a bad wig and glasses on him, then guess what? half way through the story they give him a makeover, and voila! he becomes a pretty boy again. puleez.  Two favorable points about this film, The TV actors makes a cameo at the very end, picking up the continuity for the TV movie, Densha Otoko Deluxe.  Train Man: The Movie exists within the 'world' of Train Man, that is, when his story became famous in the TV series, they made a film out of his life, being this film.  After its release in Japan, they made Densha Otoko Deluxe, wherein they show posters for the film and ridicule it.  The film's release has made all otaku celebrities, and women hound them wherever they go.  Complicated.",1171929600,4,950,4.526315789473684
208238,3,6163876032,"To put it simply, the 2005 romantic comedy Train Man is a fairy tale for geeks. As derisive as that comment may sound, it's not really meant as a criticism, just a factual description. Supposedly based on a true story, Train Man (a.k.a. Densha Otoko) centers on a twenty-two year old manga enthusiast known only by the online handle ""Train Man"" (Takayuki Yamada). Unlucky in love for his entire life, Train Man has consoled himself to the fact that he probably won't be getting a girlfriend anytime this millennium, so he decides to embrace his nerdy fate and spend his free time prowling for toys in Akihabara.

One evening, our hero's prospects for romance begin to change when he spots a lovely woman (Miki Nakatani) being harassed by a drunken commuter. In a moment of awkward heroism, Train Man intervenes on her behalf. Although he's certainly no Superman, he does delay the drunkard long enough for security to show up. Later, to Train Man's complete surprise, the woman asks for his address so she can properly thank him for his good deed. So energized by this encounter is Train Man that he posts his story on a message board, an act which eventually earns him a faithful, albeit anonymous readership. Little does he know, however, that his story has only just begun.

Things pick up quickly when Train Man receives a set of expensive Hermes teacups in the mail. The sender? You guessed it - the woman on the train. Both ecstatic and highly confused by this surprising turn of events, Train Man turns to his online pals for help, who post back bits of advice on what his next move should be. After much debate, he finally summons up the courage to call her, and amazingly, she agrees to meet him for dinner. But in preparing for his first ever real date with a woman, Train Man smartly makes a few cosmetic adjustments on the advisement of his online peers. It isn't long before he gets a stylish haircut, purchases some designer threads, and doffs his glasses in favor of some contact lenses. The transformation from geek to chic is surprisingly fast, but no matter what he looks like, it's clear that Train Man is still a socially-inept otaku, as his jitteriness and all-around dorkiness in the presence of the woman he dubs ""Hermes"" is strikingly apparent. Still, Train Man begins to make progress with Hermes, but unfortunately, his deep-seated insecurities just might mess the whole thing up. It's clearly time for Train Man to grow up, but will he do it in time?

On its premise alone, Train Man is essentially a G-rated version of The 40-Year-Old-Virgin culturally suited to fit Japanese tastes. While both films maintain an underlying message that love is more important than lust, the main character in Train Man seems to operate in a world where sex isn't even something that would cross his mind, a factor which greatly contributes to the fairytale quality of the film. And while technology, particularly computers, is crucial to the plot, Train Man is, at its core, an old-fashioned romance about finding one's true love. Some may balk at the simplicity of the story, but in some ways, that's part of the charm.

As far as performances go, Takayuki Yamada makes for a fine Train Man, particularly once the She's All That-style makeover takes place. It's easy to act nerdy when the character is dressed to the nines in Akihabara geek wear, but once he makes the transformation into a more presentable stud, it would be easy for an actor to slip out of the required geekiness necessary for his performance. However, that's not the case with Yamada; the incongruity between what Train Man looks like post-makeover versus his actual behavior helps give this geek fantasy some semblance of realism. No matter how polished Train Man looks, he's still an otaku at heart.

Also carrying the film along with Yamada is Miki Nakatani, who has the unenviable task of making her character's interest in Train Man seem believable. As likeable as Train Man is as a character is, his appeal seems somewhat elusive. Yes, he's a nice guy, but he's also annoyingly skittish, and as the finale proves, a bit of a crybaby to boot. However, the ""crying"" scene does make for a funny reversal of expectations as Hermes must console the weeping Train Man with several comical ""there, there"" reassurances. And while the believability of a relationship between Hermes and Train Man is precarious at best, it would be completely unbelievable if not for Nakatani's performance. She is able to project an inner life, if not an entire past history with men for her character that is not in the script, which gives some indication of why she values Train Man so much.

One of the more interesting aspects of the film is how it focuses not only on Train Man's mission, but also on his ability to touch the lives of his readership. Among his online supporters, there's a young shut-in, a nurse who seems to be recovering from a failed relationship, three overgrown otakus who've had worse luck in life than Train Man, and a husband and wife who don't realize they're posting on the same board. As each of these characters participate in Train Man's strange coming-of-age story, his amazing strides with Hermes opens their eyes to what's missing in their own lives, showing them that if he can get a girlfriend, then just about anything is possible. Although, these ""sidestories"" could probably be developed even better in a television drama, the small glimmers of their lives given in Train Man are a welcome presence and enhance the main storyline immensely.

After all is said and done, Train Man is more or less just a fun little underdog story, thanks in large part to the likeable performances from its cast members. Sure, things are a bit too chaste and simplistic considering the situation, but in some ways, that's part of the appeal. Unlike the protagonist, the film Train Man may not dramatically change your life, but in its all-too-true rendering of the anxieties of dating, on some level it's sure to speak to everyone's inner geek.",1170288000,19,6032,4.7831094049904035
208240,4,6163876032,"This was a fun, light hearted movie to watch. Painful at times, due to the main character's awkward shyness, but fun and sweet and romantic. Funny too and loved the scenes of of beautiful Japan. I like that there is no nudity or overt sexual-ness about it so I can watch it with my family.

Spoiler here though for anyone who will answer my question: I did not get the ending very well. My daughters and I disagree on what really happened so if someone who watched it can enlighten me please I would be grateful! I'm pretty sure how the directer meant to end it but want to be sure.",1346198400,,582,4.243243243243243
208241,4,6163876032,"What a delightful movie. I went into it not knowing if I would enjoy this story or not since it seemed aimed more at young people but it was a very refreshing take on the first love of a socially awkward, aka geeky, Japanese, young man.  It turned out to be surprisingly genuine and sweet. I loved all the different nerd characters and how they helped each other to become more socially competent people via the internet chat. The whole movie just had a very innocent charm about it and I would recommend it. In some ways it reminds me of the Japanese movie Boys On The Run in that both stories are about geeky guys who are still virgins and who want to find a girlfriend, I liked that movie too although Boys On The Run has a little less innocence about it than this movie does.",1336348800,,779,4.263513513513513
208242,5,6163876032,"This is a great flick if you have been to Japan and understand the country and it's people. The movie is pretty corny, but it also gives you an insight into Japanese society. Nevertheless a great film I enjoyed watching several times. If you are not a fan of this type of film you might not enjoy it.",1329523200,,300,4.189655172413793
208243,5,6163876032,I bought this movie along with a few others and expected this one to be the worst. Turns out it was pretty good!,1308787200,,112,3.9130434782608696
208244,4,6163876032,"The story is inspired from real-life events in Japan. Nerdy boy rescues beautiful girl in a subway train from a drunk tough guy. The profusely shy and apologetic hero gets help from anonymous friends on an Internet User group (Bulletin Board Service) and musters courage to ask the girl out. Boy has immense insecurity issues and girl waits patiently as he works them out. A similar real-life event was reported in New York a few years ago when a man first saw the love of his life on a subway. The girl got off at a station before guy could speak with her. He soon located her through the ""Lost and Found"" section in Craig's List. It is not known if that encounter transformed into a lifelong relationship.",1290729600,2,707,4.53125
208245,4,6163876032,"This is one of those movies you don't know if you will like or not when you pick it up? But give it a chance--it grows on you fast! It also helps if you are a hopeless romantic [like I am]. No sex but hey it doesn't need to be shown as you know that's where this romance is leading. And the young woman is so feminine, most guys would fall for her. She even wears a pretty dress! When is the last time you saw anything but jeans if you live in USA? So then, why are people surprised that USA men are going for foreign women? I always found them more likeable anyhow!",1276819200,2,566,3.9304347826086956
208246,3,6163876032,"I can see how this story would be a good book and catch on in Japan - an otaku (geek) is completely socially incompetent, has no experience with the opposite sex, yet falls for an innocent-looking business woman after rescuing her from a drunkard on the train one day. With no one else to seek advice from, he turns to an online community in a chatroom to guide him through each step - from changing his look to what to say on the phone to which restaurant to dine in. Surprisingly, she eventually falls for him too. Just when he thought that they were not a good match, he impresses her with his knowledge of computers to win her over. The final scene is them expressing their love to each other in the middle of Akihabara, his new look has come undone in the rain, his glasses reappear and his geekiness is back in full force. But she sees past all of that and still wants to be with him. Forever. It makes a good story, but in the end, these two have nothing in common and I doubt that a real world relationship between the two would really go well. But for a short movie, it makes for a good story.",1262131200,5,1102,4.202830188679245
208247,4,6163876032,"Okay, this is not the most original idea--a nerd going after a girl--but this movie has several things going for it.  First off, the girl is not some uber-hot celebrity; she is a normal woman who works a normal job.  Second, rather than having him confront an external enemy, such as a jerk boyfriend, the struggle is completely internal; his battle is against his own lack of confidence, which makes for much greater drama.  I identified with him quite a bit, so much so I found myself yelling at the screen--something I don't do too much--when I saw him battling against his fear.  This is quite a ittle gem of a movie, so much so that I recommended it to some friends, who liked just as much as I did.  Getting this is money well-spent.",1261008000,2,739,4.444444444444445
208248,3,6163876032,"I thought this movie would be a great movie to watch, but it wasn't that good at all.",1252022400,,85,3.7777777777777777
208249,4,6163876032,"Train Man, the movie, is likable enough - the based on fact story of a geek who's unexpectedly thrown into a relationship with a woman who may, for him, be perfection.

This was based on a famous account published in a Japanese internet group - which in itself is utterly fascinating and gripping. The problem lies in trying to make an otherwise ordinary romance seem more special than it is. Train Man turns out being fairly unsensational, even despite some smart casting choices. I would, however, strongly recommend the eleven-part Japanese drama; it's fictionalized to a much greater degree, but the dramatic peaks are more palpable.",1237420800,3,637,5.009433962264151
208250,5,6163876032,"Densha Otoko is a heart warming, uplifting film. Its a wonderful underdog love story with great story telling.  It incorporates a dynamic ensemble cast enabling it to strike resonance with almost any audience. As is to be expected with any foreign film, there will be increased appreciation if you understand the culture from which it comes, but even without an understanding of modern Japanese culture, or more specifically, Tokyo life-style, it is still a touching tale with very entertaining conventions.

Being foreign, it can't be given a rating such as G, PG, PG-13, etc., but I would easily rate it as a PG movie.  It is good, wholesome, and provides endearing redeeming qualities for every character.  Based on an autobiographical novel, it lends itself to the believability that you seldom find in the romantic comedy genre.  Naturally, some departures have been made from the original story for the sake of fluidity, but many of the storytelling mechanisms used in the movie are directly derived from the book, making it poetically  interesting as well.

I'm not one to give story details in reviews, but if you are concerned with the attractiveness of the story, note that the success of the original book spawned an anime series, a television series and this movie, all of which sustained impressive popularity in Japan.

Summation:  You can't go wrong with this pick.",1236384000,,1380,5.044052863436123
208251,4,6163876032,I saw some of this show at a con one year and though it be fun to watch. I must say after watching it. It's very much like the Japanese to make a show like this. I enjoy it and would remand it to any body.,1221523200,,205,3.4782608695652173
208252,5,6163876032,"This was an awesome movie. I teach a basic high school Japanese course and had been looking for a film about contemporary young people in Japan
without anything sexual or violent. I was worried at first if they would find it too romantic but surprisingly they were riveted from the opening scene, in Akihabara, the Tokyo Electronics district. The film gives lots of insight into the habits, language, and social lives of Japanese twenty-somethings.  It was a bonus that the film's characters are mostly ""otaku"", geeks, like my students, so they could really relate to the characters' difficulties interacting with live humans in the real world, even as they fluently socialize with each other online.
Good flick, lots of fun, emotional at the end. It's in Japanese, so you need subtitles if you're not fluent.",1212969600,,809,4.992592592592593

208255,5,6163876032,"Being a native speaker of the Japanese language, I watched the film with Japanese voice and English subtitle. Often, with other movies, I find myself frustrated with translation being not so accurate, but this film didn't irritate me. It is impossible for translation to convey the exact context, and therefore one can achieve the BEST possible translation. I say that the best possible translation effort was made with a success in this film. The quality of translation matters when one watches foreign films.

As a comedy I think this film is entertaining. They used this film as one of films shown for Japanese Film Festival in Miami, and I could see other audiences having good time in the theater. I thought the film conveys the culture of Japanese high-tech communication in a proper fashion. Although I am not exactly a nerd (some of my friends say I am, but I insist that I am not), I have had an experience a few years ago where I had to receive support from a certain group of anonymous Japanese persons online, who understood a very specific issue, and I think my overcoming that issue had a lot to do with the online support from people I didn't even know their names.

It is true that Japanese online community has unbelievably strong bond  and influences to us in a way that wasn't so before Internet came along. That I can say for sure from my own experience.",1195344000,5,1374,4.622950819672131
208256,4,6163876032,"I simply adore this movie!  I saw it twice through Netflix and decided I had to own it.  The general plot is simple... nerdy, introverted guy meets sweet, caring girl.  Girl is patient, kind, and eventually brings guy out of his shell, a bit at a time.  What is beautiful is the set of interactions Densha Otoko has with his online ""friends"" in the movie.  The cross-section of online life was perfectly picked to make this story shine.

My only reason for giving this movie four stars instead of five is because of the ending.  For those who have seen it, you probably know what I'm talking about.  For those who have not, I will not ruin this brilliant movie by talking about it anymore.

208257,4,6163876032,"I wasn't sure I was going to like this film, but I liked it quite a bit. I'm always on the lookout for Japanese comedies, and the film ""Train Man,"" aka ""Densha Otoku,"" was definitely a worthwhile purchase. The film itself centers around the life of a very nerdy [I would say shy] 22-year-old young man who lives with his parents. Moreover, he does not have a girlfriend. Part of this reason is that he has immersed himself in a world of anime and video games. Our protagonist may be shy, but his personal life is about to take a sudden change. This change will occur when he helps a good-looking young woman who is being harassed on the train. It is on this train ride that Train Man (Takayuki Yamada) comes to the rescue of Hermes (Miki Nakatini): For she is being harassed by a drunk.

In her gratitude for helping her out, Hermes asks Train Man for his address, and eventually sends him a set of Hermes tea cups. [Hence the name of this woman he has rescued] What is he too do? Well, he immediately turns to the internet for help. Moreover, several people respond to help him out. With the help of these eager internet friends, Train Man sets out to pursue his romantic interest. I know this sounds a little silly, but this film really works. With all sorts of people trying to give him advice on how to pursue this young woman, a delightful story is brought to film.

I understand that this film is based on a true incident that occurred in Japan, and that a television series was made of this incident. I have not seen these, therefore, I cannot comment on them. However, this film stands on its own. Train Man has never been on a date, and does not know what to do. He is desperate in his lonely life to seek out this woman, who for a brief moment gave him a sense of fulfillment--that there is something great missing in his life. I couldn't help but empathize with Train Man, and his attempts to use the only things he knows--the internet, as his way of reaching out to others for help, and in the process even changes those who are attempting to help him. This is a delightful film, and some of the reviewers here have given a better description of the film. I would highly recommend this film to all viewers, as it is a delightfully charming film.

So the people on 2ch, the most popular and largest bulletin board in Japan and the world, decide to help him with hints, advice and encouragement.  In the end his own actions also encourage them to turn off the computers, step outside and face the real world.

Unlike American romantic comedies which culminate with the two main characters getting together in bed, this film focuses not only on the awkwardness and difficulties of first love, but the impact one person has on the live of others. As Train Man's fellow chat-room members (who are invisible to him) help him and cheer him on, we the viewers see their own lives change as well, as they gain courage to move on and become better human beings.

As a Japanese film, this story works well. If Hollywood gets hold of it and Americanizes it, like they did with 'Shall We Dance?' it will be ruined!",1178928000,10,682,4.73109243697479

Some of the English subtitles are a little off, but that doesn't seriously interfere with understanding. This version is much cheaper than the Japanese original with English subtitles. It.has voice in Japanese and Thai, plus subtitles in English and Japanese. So, for many purposes, it's better.",1402876800,2,401,5.184615384615385
7802728,4,6163876032,"This movie is charming. My high school students love it. It is very appropriate for second and third year Japanese students. They enjoy the story more because they can read all the text that is running through the background of the scenes. Amazon, however, has not delivered me a copy to own yet! It was misaddressed and, though it has been a month since I reported the problem, they have not send out a DVD to replace the one they sent to East J'Bip. I'll be borrowing it from the library again to show in class.",1396742400,,513,4.354166666666667

This is 100 times better than the movies YOU'VE GOT MAIL or REVENGE OF THE NERDS.

There are so many surprises, laughs, tears, support, surprises.

HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!

Great soundtrack",1372377600,,278,5.2272727272727275
