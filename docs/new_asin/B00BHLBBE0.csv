8568537,4,B00BHLBBE0,"This French DVD boasts a nice color restoration. The film itself is another unsung Universal International western which deserves more attention than it was ever given. Not a ""shoot 'em up"" western but more a study of hypocrisy in a small western town. Mara Corday is especially good as a dance hall girl who is trying to better her life. The one negative factor about this DVD is that the French subtitles are burned into the image and not removable. If you can overlook this distraction, the DVD is well worth getting.",1440288000,,520,4.663043478260869
8568538,5,B00BHLBBE0,"A great movie! Good actors and story. Dale Robertson is excellent as Jagade....a ""devil-like""character who brings out the unpleasant side in ""good"" people.",1404950400,,155,5.782608695652174
