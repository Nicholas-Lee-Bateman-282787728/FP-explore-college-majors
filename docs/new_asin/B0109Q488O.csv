7306954,4,B0109Q488O,"This may not be the Deep Purple who set the world on fire with their live performances in the 70's and 80's, Ritchie and Jon (RIP) retired from the band to move on to other things. The band continued on with Ian, Ian and Roger, now joined by Steve and Don. They have nothing to apologize for. Deep Purple still have the juice and play live with an intense, though tamer, fire. This is a show that catches them on all cylinders.  Give it a look and a listen. It's worth it.",1444089600,7,472,4.130434782608695
7306955,5,B0109Q488O,they are in my blood since 1969.....love it big time!!!,1444003200,,55,4.6
7306956,2,B0109Q488O,"I admit that I have not purchased this DVD, but I saw this broadcast on Palladia the other day.  I caught the end of Don Airey's solo then Perfect Strangers... so far so good.  They are getting older but the music sounded good.  Then they started Space Truckin' and it quickly went south to downright horrible.  Gillian could not hit the notes in the chorus and sounded awful.  I changed the channel about halfway through the song because I couldn't take it anymore.  Don't get me wrong, I love Deep Purple and may get bashed since I didn't watch the whole thing, but based on what I did see I would rather remember them as they USED TO BE...",1443571200,,642,4.352941176470588

8721686,2,B0109Q488O,"Well this concert doesn't hold a candle to their ""Whacken"" concert, and it's not just because of the 3D aspect, but the ""You Are There Feeling"" of the great camera work. With Tokyo Concert it's dark and the cameras are almost always on the group and not much to see of audience, thus no ""You Are There Feeling"". Would I purchase again knowing this? No. Get the Whacken concert even if ya don't have 3D.",1516060800,,402,4.373333333333333
8721687,5,B0109Q488O,"It's great. Sure Deep Purple don't rock as hard in concert as they did 45 years ago. Who does? But here's the thing. While the rock press obsesses over weather Led Zeppelin will ever tour again, Deep Purple not only continues touring but also keeps recording records that are classic and current at the same time, with the last one ""Now What?! being as good or better than anything they've ever done. How many bands can you say that about?!",1484611200,,440,4.5125
8721688,5,B0109Q488O,"Terrific Blu-ray. Way better than ""From the Setting Sun"" Blu-ray. Get this one. Skip ""From the Setting Sun"".",1484265600,,108,5.055555555555555

8721694,4,B0109Q488O,"Still the great Deep Purple songs, but the band has to admit their age, as Ian Gillan is pushing it on his famous songs. Compared it with their original songs back in the 70's, you can really tell a difference. Still, the band is great and does the best for the performance. Any Deep Purple fans would love this concert still.",1448064000,,326,4.360655737704918
