7971947,5,B00006LPJI,"The front of this is supposed to have Sailor Venus on it, which looks like the exact cover of the movie Pure Friends. But that's supposed to be the cover of this movie. And this cover is supposed to be the cover of Pure Friends!! I would know because I ordered these two movies off of THIS site!!
The subtitled versions compared to the original uncut version, the subtitled would probley rank more higher over the uncut stuff, but I'm betting this is pretty much the same.
Even though it says on the back of the uncut boxes Rated for ages 13 and up, this is suitible for ages 10 and up{ for subtitle reasons}. And that's probely why you think you should buy the edited version{ which contains the format of episodes that were on Cartoon Network, or another cartoon channel, but if you don't care about you may not being able to keep up with the subtitles, then the uncut version, is pretty much the same.
Parents, because this rated 13 and up, it has bad stuff in it. But the only reason is because of the subtitles. The don't have any bad stuff in them.
This is {in my opinion} one of the funniest series. But there are a lot more funnier ones that I have seen. I do have to say that this is my favorite tv series.
Before I forget, here is my review:
1st episode:
Raye gets put into a magazine and becomes very popular. But then a girl comes who wants to be Raye's sister! And Raye learns a new attack!
2nd episode:
{This is episode is based on "" Rini's Diary"" in the SS 4 comic}
Palla Palla gives everyone cavities, in an attempt to find the holder of the Golden Mirror.
3rd episode:
Lita and Mina develop a crush on a principal and the scouts help him with a project. But then Mina and Lita stop being friends. But they do develop super attacks. Do you think they won't ever be friends again? Buy this movie. I swear every penny is worth it!",1058140800,3,1844,4.2414772727272725
