1082449,5,6305816689,"I really think this is one of the best movies to come along in years.  It is mysterious, creepy, and alarming but somehow it is also funny, endearing, and charming.  How did the director combine so many different  moods in one movie?  This movie is a character development and mood type  movie, not a plot type, so don't expect your typical American blood and  guts killer type movie!  Many people will not like this movie because they  are so conditioned to nonstop action.  This movie gives you time to reflect  and enjoy the intriguing vivuals and eerie sound track.  I loved it!",963878400,17,582,4.607843137254902
1082450,4,6305816689,"If you aren't already delighted by Bob Hoskins's versatility, by all means see this film.  The man who interacted so well with animated characters in ""Roger Rabbit"" scores again as a brooding, lonely single man  whose character was mis-shaped by a domineering, non-maternal t.v.  personality mother.
Under Atom Egoyan's superb direction, the complexity  of the characters and their situations unfolds so slowly and subtly that  the collision course they are on is not immediately obvious.  One wonders  why Hilditch/Hoskins is so obsessed with the t.v. French chef, Gala, to the  point of owning films of all her shows and a good many food processors she  endorses, until one realizes that the chubby boy in the black and white  films is Hilditch as a frustrated child.  The child abuse caught on camera  makes one wonder what childhood was like in the spacious, empty house that  Hilditch has always called home.
It is almost possible sympathize with  Hilditch's sad attempts to bond with various females, all clearly too young  and too street-hardened to be good partners for him, until it becomes  obvious what their fates have been and what fate awaits the tragic figure  of Felicia--whose pregnancy causes her to be rejected by the child's  father, his mother, and her own father.  It is a very interesting twist  that the unwanted pregnancy is ultimately what buys Felicia the required  time to save her life.
I would give this movie five stars but for what I  perceive as a couple of minor flaws.  Sometimes I thought Hoskins had a bit  of a problem maintaining his English accent.  Also, I am not altogether  convinced that releasing his last would-be victim and committing suicide  was a totally believeable reaction by Hilditch to his encounter with the  born-again oddballs who came knocking on his garden gate, even if they did  seem to pose some threat that his homocidal proclivities might soon be  revealed.  But then, it could be argued that a man who spent so much time  insulating himself with walls (the garden wall, his house, the building in  which he worked, and his car) might just feel he had nowhere to go but out  when it appeared that those walls had been invaded.
Viewing  ""Felicia's Journey"" is a most worthwhile experience.  It seems  that Hoskins just keeps getting better with every performance.  I  personally can't wait to see what he does next.",963532800,,2379,4.896725440806045
1082451,3,6305816689,"Where Silence of the Lambs might bang you over the head with its portrayal  of a madman, Felicia's Journey is far more quiet but just as deft. Elaine  Cassidy is very sharp and sincere as Felicia, and it is her preformance  that holds the film together. Hoskin's, on the other hand, handles his  character with less ease. He seems a little uneasy with Hilditch, the  mother obsessed killer, and in his interview included on the disk, he  re-affirms my feeling that he found Hilditch ""creepy"". So, his  portrayal comes off all creepy and less human.
Atom Egoyan is a film  maker i never really liked in his early work, witch had too much of a art  house stink to them for my taste, but with his recent outings (far more  conventional ones) The Sweet Hereafeter and Journey, he has vastly  impressed as a fine cinematic storyteller, who never forces the subject  upon the viewer. He just presents a good story, in a simple manner, for all  those willing to listen and watch.
The DVD is of good quality. Looks  great. The extras are fine but negligible. All of the cast interviews are  already in the short featurette, save a few brief comments. It would have  been better just to make the featurette longer and include the interviews  in whole. Hilditch's video collection just offers basically what we see in  the movie, only with very annoying black fades breaking up the  conversation. A video fast forward or tape break would have looked better  than the fades.
Journey by no means breaks new ground in storytelling or  subject matter, but it succeeds as a fine tale of a innocent young girl and  a deadly man, who both are confused with how to function in this world.",962582400,6,1670,4.608843537414966
1082452,4,6305816689,"Atom Egoyan's Felicia's Journey is the kind of movie that will make you sit and think about the characters.  In the surface and in the promotions, this is a serial killer movie.  In reality, it is much more than this.  Not  only does the movie deal with the plottings of a madman played by Bob  Hoskins, but it gives us a window into his past which tries to help us  understand what went wrong with this man.  Yet we could never completely  understand a man like this.
Opposite Hoskins is a very innocent  performance by Elaine Cassidy.  She plays a naive young lady, looking for  her boyfriend.  Here, too, we see the pain in her life.  Both Hoskins and  Cassidy have a horrible mother and father, respectively.  The shame in  which they grow up in is very important here.
I was less interested in  what was going to happen and what did happen than I was in letting Egoyan  work his gift as a director.  He manages to take this story into disturbing  imagery not because of gore or physicality, but for meeting such scarred  people, and (in Hoskin's case) their victims in such a visually provacative  way.",962409600,3,1107,4.484848484848484
1082453,1,6305816689,"Can you believe that this ""film"" cost 10 million dollars to  make. My bet is that Nucleus spent maximum 1 million on Production,4 million  in to his pocket and the rest was spent on bribing the judges. I mean do you  not smell a rat when the video is selling for 111 dollars and Atoms talk of  casting an unknown young Irish actress for freshness-come on face it it was  because you'd get her for cheap.(no offense to her she did  well).I think  its time Egoyan went to Film school,I haven't seen any of his other films  but I feel very strongly that this is probably one of the worst films I  have seen. The plot made no sense,so many unfinished details,full of cliches  about rural Ireland. It was like a farce that wasn't funny. A complete waste  of time that leaves a I bad taste in your mouth. Who were the Bible bashers  supposed to be at the end?If they were supposed to be Jehovahs Witnesses at  least try to get it right. In conclusion this movie is a disgrace. I wasn't  so disgusted until I read that this film made it to Cannes as I had assumed  it was a directors first film (and last)made on a low  budget.

1082454,5,6305816689,"Seductively filmed in rich detail, with a steady, even pace, this  psychological thriller has a plot which becomes deeper and stranger with  every scene change.
It begins simply enough, with the journey of a young  Irish woman to an industrial English city.  I cannot say much more, because  the viewer must experience the unfolding of this strange tale in the manner  which the director intended.
Egoyan shows the viewer that, as in life,  appearances can be deceiving... a theme that recurs in his work.  There is  a feeling of being an intruder in the lives of other people, much more so  than with the usual thriller.  Brilliant acting from every performer.  I  do not particularly like Egoyan's endings, and this one is not  exceptional.
This film contains several disturbing scenes of degradation  and cruelty.  It is not a cheerful movie.",961459200,2,845,4.928571428571429
1082455,1,6305816689,"This film is the the most pathetic serial killer film I've ever seen. Why? Because It has no suspernse what so ever. You would think that a film about a serial would be anything but boring but what you're getting in this peice  of garbage is everything but exeptional. The only thing and I mean the only  thing in this film that was even worthy was Bob Hoskin's preformance.
I  will not be seeing this film ever again and I hope that Atom Egoyan has  learned a very important lesson in making so-called thillers because this  one was so dull. The least Atom could have done for the audience was make  Felicia's Journey ""R"" but instead he went with a happy PG-13  rating that DOES NOT cut it with this subject matter.",959644800,2,716,4.378787878787879

 Brazil wasn't the first Bob Hoskins film I saw, but the third. It was the first film where I could understand a word he was saying. I simply couldn't penetrate his cockney in The Long  Good Friday or Mona Lisa.

That doesn't mean I couldn't understand his  characters. Hoskins is a forthright screen actor. He can inhabit his  compact frame with a ferocious mob boss, a compassionate chauffer, a duct  repairman or a foil for Roger Rabbit with imperceptible  effort.

Felicia's Journey played the Cannes film festival, there was a  buzz about his performance. I liked the idea of him teaming with Atom  Egoyan whose tragic The Sweet Hereafter drew a heartwrenching performance  from Ian Holm.

Listening to William Trevor's book on tape, I could  tell the role of factory caterer/serial killer Joseph Ambrose Hilditch was  made for Hoskins.

Mr Hilditch's hands are small, seeming not to belong  to the rest of him; deft, delicate fingers that can insert a battery into a  watch or tidily truss a chicken, this latter a useful accomplishment, for  of all things in the world Mr Hilditch enjoys eating.

Like his  predecessors Anthony Perkins (Psycho) and Barry Foster (Frenzy) he seems  outwardly affable enough when he's with his coworkers or offering avuncular  advice to wayward girls like Felicia (Elaine Cassidy). Atom Egoyan  dispenses with the sensationalism of Hitchcock's shower scene and staircase  sequences. He credits us with the wherewithal to conjure our own violent  images to accompany Hilditch's collection of videotaped victims.

On  the other hand, he doesn't rely on a convoluted psychiatrist's explanation  to explain to us where Hilditch went wrong. We simply watch him go wrong  this time.",959126400,4,1748,5.18705035971223
1082457,3,6305816689,"Bob Hoskins splendidly plays a serial killer who is also a gourmet chef  and manager of a catering service at a large factory.  A respected and  outwardly very respectable man whose mother was a TV personality chef whose  influence has dominated him from childhood.

Into his clutches falls a  girl from Ireland pursuing the man who impregnated  her and who she thinks  is as much in love with her as she with him.  The fun  of the movie is in  watching Hoskins develop her trust to the point where she  stays with him  in his home.

The story is extremely well developed, a tight, concise  study that is  gripping from start to finish as we wrestle with the  killer's intentions  while fearing for his beautiful victim, played by  Eileen Cassidy.

The only off-note in this fine art house film is the  final resolution where  the plausability of the killer's dialogue and  actions takes a turn completely  inconsistent with the heretofore unerring  observation of real human behavior  and interaction.  Suddenly, what comes  out of Hoskin's mouth is anything that  serves the writer/director's (Atom  Egoyan) misdirection of what was needed  for the denouement and finale.  He  should have given it more thought.

The film, however, is worth seeing  for all its other virtues and is highly  recommended.

1082533,2,6305816689,"Should have known, if it sound's too good to be true, it usually is. First, it isn't even established this guy is a serial killer. All that's shown is some boxes he has with pics of girls pasted on them, and a couple snips of him talking to various girls in his car. How does that add up to serial killer? Even Felicia isn't killed, molested or hurt in any way - just treated like his daughter. Biggest moment is he slips something in her tea, she falls asleep in a bedroom in his house, then he lets her voluntarily leave the next morning and hangs himself after that. Serial killer?

1082535,5,6305816689,"Atom Egoyan apparently can't make a normal film, which is something I really admire about him.  His take on the serial killer story is far from what one would expect, and maybe that is just what we should expect from Atom.  Instead of thrusting violence in our faces and telling us what is going on right off the bat, Atom allows his characters to simmer in a pot of tension until everything becomes clear to the audience.

`Felicia's Journey' introduces us to two lost souls.  Felicia is pregnant with her absent boyfriend's baby.  She's confused as to where he is, because she's received conflicting stories and no one seems to be of any help getting her in contact with him, so she travels from Ireland to England in search of him.  Along the way, she meets Joe.  Joe is a lonely older gentleman who manages a catering company and is obsessed with his late mother's television cooking show.  He takes an interest in Felicia and offers his assistance.  Her naivety and desperation are an easy target for this seemingly kind hearted man who is hiding a dark secret; one that involves a slew of dead young women.

Bob Hoskins really makes this film work; because he personifies `chilling' in a way that I don't think I've seen before.  He nails his character's inner demons to the point where he embodies this man.  His quiet demeanor and his soft spoken directness are both delicate details to underscoring this man's madness.  Arsinee Khanjian is also astonishingly haunting as Gala, Joe's eccentric mother.

Egoyan directs his film with a sharp sense of internalized dread.  By splicing two storylines (that of Joe's progressive madness and Felicia's journey) he builds two stories of equal depth and then peppers them with enough atmosphere to keep us glued.  The score in particular is expertly used to instill the needed reaction from the audience, and the stunning cinematography is equal parts crisp and beautiful as well as intimate and chilling.  No, this is not your average serial killer film and no, it won't necessarily make you jump out of your seat, but Bob Hoskins will crawl under your skin and the ambiguous implications that surround both storylines will provoke you to contemplate the real meaning of this film long after the film wraps.",1345766400,,2258,4.823376623376624
1082536,5,6305816689,"Well, I have to say, I watched this movie in a rather unusual way. A few weeks ago, on TV, I saw the very ending (about the last 5 minutes) and I thought, ""Egad, what IS this movie about?""  Well, now I just finished watching it again only this time,from the beginning. (I just happened upon it while channel surfing.)

I have to say Hoskins is brilliant. I can't imagine any other actor doing any better than he in this role.  You are convinced he is totally ""off the track"" as you see him preparing those impressive convoluted meals while watching hid dead mother's cooking show re-runs.

As he manipulates the turkey skin and pierces the trussing needle through the rack of lamb there is no doubt he is full of hate and revulsion for his mother but also filled with an obsession about her for which he has little control.

He is at once, menacing, charming and pathetic and his inner demons are juxtaposed alongside Elaine Cassidy's character's innocence and childlike trusting nature.

I thought the movie was very well done, VERY unusual and a suspenseful thriller in a sort of  Hitchcock genre but without the blood and gore.",1244764800,6,1130,4.62
1082537,5,6305816689,"As I do completely love Elaine Cassidy and count myself among many of her adoring fans...I've asked myself would I like this movie as much if she wasn't in it? The answer is probably not, being truthful...Therefore, speaking strictly as a fan of Ms Cassidy's...I thought Elaine was especially gifted at playing this innocent character. Felicia is a very innocent girl who is walking head on into a very bad situation! This fact had me sitting on the edge of my seat throughout the entire movie. Bob Hoskins was fantastic also. But you know, as demented as his character was. Elaine was equally angelic as her character in contrast. As for me, this dynamic made for one really good thriller! I really cared about what was happening to Felicia...She was so kind, so lost, so trusting...Bob Hoskins on the other hand takes his role to the exact polar opposite end of the human psyche...I hated him, but yet I also felt sorry for him at times...I think this is one of those films you'll either appreciate, or you'll hate it. Because it doesn't offer up american style thrills. Meaning, no special effects, body parts, blood, or gore whatsoever.

1082538,5,6305816689,"Although Leonard Maltin gives this film a tepid review in his Video Guide, I find it a very well made film. I had not watched it since the time when it was sold in video cassette, and I'd forgotten how good it was. Bob Hoskins performance is especially good. The movie is quite frightening, especially if one has never seen it and doesn't know the outcome, but it leaves one with a lot to think about. The style is somewhat like that of a Neil Jordan film.",1219363200,2,456,4.252873563218391
1082539,5,6305816689,"This is a movie in the Hitchcock style, this time without gore, but with subtle terror.

Some of the scenes are homages to the master, but this does not detract from their effectiveness. (I'm thinking of glass of milk carried up the stairs in Suspicion.)

The movie is suspenseful, and scary as mild-mannered catering supervisor Hilditch befriends the lost traveller Felicia as she struggles to find her missing boyfriend.  On the surface, Mr. Hilditch seems so nice, but as his little hobby is gradually revealed, even the calmest scenes are quite terrifying.

Hilditch has grown up under the suffocating wing of his famous TV chef mother.  Apparently, like the mother-son bonding in Psycho, the results of this ""nurturing"" can be deadly.

The leads are played by Bob Hoskins -- what a great actor -- and Elaine Cassidy, a young actress who makes the incredibly naive Felicia come alive.  The movie is from a novel by William Trevor.

This is a troubling film, filmed in wide-open industrial spaces that emphasize how alone and weak Felicia is. The only place of comfort is the serial killer's cozy homestead.

This is not a Psycho-style shrieker, but it is a work of quiet horror. ""Have a cup of tea, my dear?""

1082540,4,6305816689,"This film adaptation of William Trevor's novel of psychological suspense, for which its author  was the recipient of the 1994 Whitbread Award, is one that those who read the book should see, as well as those who like unusual films of psychological suspense. After reading the book, I became curious as to how a film adaptation would work, as so much of the book involves the introspections of two people whose lives interconnect. Despite some of its shortcomings, it is definitely a film worth seeing, if only for Bob Hoskins brilliant performance.

Felicia is a seventeen year old motherless and naive Irish girl, who has become intimate with an Irish boy named Johnny. Of course, the expected ensues, and after Johnny has left Ireland and returned to England where he ostensibly works, Felicia is left holding the bag. Her disapproving father suspects Johnny of actually being in the British Army and, thus, a traitor to his own. He also has a few choice words for his daughter, now that she is in the family way, and none of it is flattering. So, Felicia leaves her rural village and her family and goes off in search of Johnny, having nothing more than the vaguest of ideas where he might be.

She crosses the Irish Sea and arrives in the English Midlands in the industrial city of Birmingham, as she believes Johnny to be working in a lawn mower factory there. In her search for Johnny, she runs into the portly catering manager for one of the local factories. His name is  Joseph Ambrose Hilditch, and he is outwardly a jovial and agreeable man, well-liked by his co-workers and meticulous about his culinary repasts. He lives in solitary splendor in  the large house in which he grew up. There, he concocts lavish gourmet meals, while watching tapes of his deceased mother's television show, as she was a chef of some renown. Obviously, he was quite close to his mother, and he still misses her. The house is cluttered with collectibles but is well-kept, although decorated in the style of a bygone era. Mr. Hilditch is, indeed, a collector, but his collection is initially far beyond Felicia's imaginings.  In fact, Mr. Hilditch has a darker side to him, which is not immediately discernible by the unwary.

When Felicia first meets Mr. Hilditch, it is to ask for information in connection with her fool's errand, but something about her catches Mr. Hilditch's fancy, and he finds himself keeping Felicia in his crosshairs. When Felicia seemingly unexpectedly runs into Mr. Hilditch again, he directs her to lodgings, and so it begins. As Mr. Hilditch insinuates himself ever so slowly into her life, weaving a fantasy about his own life that is sure to put her mind at ease about him. Felicia begins finding herself ensnared  by this ostensibly kind and ever so helpful, avuncular man, and she initially fails to see the darkness that lies at the core of his being. The viewer, however, is given sneak peaks into some of his peculiarities and deceits.

Bob Hoskins is magnificent in the role of Mr. Hilditch, infusing the character with an avuncular charm that sits as a thin veneer over the cauldron of seething emotion within, emotions that cause Mr. Hilditch to act in ways most others would not. The viewer sees what Felicia fails to see, until it is almost too late, the duplicity and cunning that is masked by his overt geniality and seeming kindness. Like a spider to the fly, our teddy bearish Mr. Hilditch begins laying his trap, and so Felicia's journey thrusts her into the belly of the beast. Newcomer, Eileen Cassidy is quite good as Felicia, playing her with a naivet&eacute; that is central to the character. Unlike the  character of Mr. Hilditch, who physically stays true to the Mr. Hilditch of the book, the Felicia of the film differs physically. Instead of a pail, puling, nun like blonde, the viewer is presented with a robust looking, fresh-faced brunette.

The cinematography is excellent, and the interior of Mr. Hilditch's home is magnificent, as it evokes another era, miring Mr. Hilditch in happier times while at home. The musical soundtrack is used to good effect to maintain that evocation. The director, Atom Egoyan, who also wrote the screenplay, does a fairly good job of adapting the book to the screen, given some of the constraints inherent in the book. Where the film fails somewhat is in the exploration of the darker corners of the human psyche, although he maintains the cat and mouse game that is central to the story. While the mind of Mr. Hilditch is dark, indeed,  unlike the book, there are no unspeakable revelations in the film as to what lies at the heart of his predilection. What the director substitutes does not really satisfy the viewer as to why Mr. Hilditch does what he does.

The film, however,  manages to show how each of these two flawed human beings were initially able to achieve a connection with another, only to find ostensible betrayal. What is decidedly different is the way that they each cope with that betrayal. Moreover, the book has no happily-ever-after ending to its story, which culminates with a conclusion that is quite bleak, robbing the reader of some satisfaction. The film's conclusion differs from that of the book, and while  less bleak, is also somewhat unsatisfactory but, perhaps, only so to those who may have already read the book.  As in the book, the journey that Felicia makes is larger in scope than merely a trip across the Irish Sea.",1123718400,6,5436,4.791666666666667

1082609,4,6305816689,"Felicia's Journey was one of those films that I loved, then hated, then liked, then thought was decent.  It was a difficult film to watch because the pacing that Egoyan has implemented is unlike any other film that I have seen.  His use of the camera to create that uneasy sensation on screen and while watching the film was very impressive.  Hoskins gives the performance of his career as this very controlled man with a very dark secret while Elaine Cassidy impressed me with her simplistic portrayal of Felicia.  This was a brilliant film, but there were just some scenes and elements that didn't seem to match the rest of the film.  The ending in particular was a bit misleading and at times rushed, but everything building up to that point really hit a strong nerve.  If you were to define the word ""thriller"", I don't think that you could do it without mentioning this film.  Brilliant acting, an interesting use of direction (which worked very well), and a story that allowed itself to be build upon during each scene are just a few of the great moments (that overshadow the poor) in this movie.

Felicia's Journey would not have been the powerhouse that it was if it was not for the powerful acting by Bob Hoskins who completely engulfed this character and showed us this rare glimpse of evil humanity.  While I am sure that some of it is due in part by Egoyan's direction, but you cannot keep your eyes off Hoskins whenever he is on the screen.  He builds his character so well, and bit by bit, that you never can anticipate what will he will say or do next.  That is what is brilliant about Hoskins.  Normally, when you have a troubled soul like Hilditch you can sometimes guess what he is going to do next.  Actors sometimes fall into a pattern of repetition, but with Hoskins it was as if we were watching the final chapter and there were bigger events taking place.  He also worked so well with Cassidy that at times I had forgotten that I was watching a film.  His ability to be this sinister father figure to this girl was impressive.  Hoskins really built this beautiful family dynamic to the film that I never saw coming.  Outstanding performances by both that any film connoisseurs should not miss.

Taped onto the vintage acting is this deeply engrossing story that pours from the bottle like some freshly corked wine.  The simplicity of the story allows the complexity of the characters emerge and be triumphant.  The story gives our characters layers upon which we gradually peel away.  Hoskins character especially.  From the opening scene until the final, I felt as if I was given the whole course, and not just bits and pieces.  While Felicia's name does take the title of this film, it is Hoskins whom this story is really about.  We learn more about his life, and his struggles than we do with Felicia.  Yet, the story does not stop there.  I found it quite interesting that Felicia father caused her conflict, while a matriarchal figure challenged Hilditch's perception.  I thought that Egoyan was really trying to do more than tell a serial killer story (as the box may reveal) by giving us these strange and strangled family moments.  I felt as if this was more a story about family, then it was about the horrors of humanity ... or perhaps it was a slice of both.  Either way, the story is the foundation to this picture, and for the first time it really worked.  So many times we go to the theater expecting to be blown away by a creative and empowering story, but this time it was a polar opposite.  The acting is what kept this film high above water, while the story (as simple as it was) only helped build Hoskins and Cassidy further into the world of impressiveness.

Finally, there was Egoyan behind the camera doing what he does best.  I have seen only one of his other films, Exotica, and he is notorious for building the suspense from behind the camera as well as in front.  His choice of panning in the wrong direction, the colors surrounding our characters and the sound of the film hit our nerves before any actors even walk into the picture.  This is all coming from Egoyan's mind, which continues to impress me with each film that I view.  I cannot wait to see more of his work and to see how well he has developed with each project.  You can definitely see the Hitchcock influence that has been imprinted with Egoyan.  I finished watching Frenzy (by Hitchcock) right after this film and the similarities were uncanny.  Egoyan reminds me of a cross between Hitchcock and von Trier.  His bold style makes each film his own, yet he is not afraid to be brutally honest and attributive to the cultural setting.  He is a true filmmaker that needs to continue to prove that you don't need millions to create a masterpiece.

While I have given credit to everyone, and thing, that deserves it in this film, I must finish this review by saying that this film was not perfection on a stick, but very close.  There were some unfinished ends that could have been tied better, and the ending just felt as if there was this outside influence at work that Egoyan was battling.  Up until the final twenty minutes of this film, I was thoroughly enjoying what I was seeing, but when the idea of religion was brought in from left field, I felt the final moments were rushed and forced.  I needed something just as dramatic, just not so random.  Also, I needed some form of conclusion to Felicia's actual ""journey"".  Did she find what she was looking for?

Overall, I was very impressed with this film.

Mr. Hilditch: A lonely, pathetic, deranged older man, forever trapped in the mind of a pre-pubescent boy still under the spell of an oblivious mother completely pre-occupied with a French cooking show she hosts. Felicia: A ""deer in the headlights"" Irish girl, disowned by her father after getting herself knocked up by Johnny, a British lad who after having slept with her, takes the first bus out of Ireland. Even though Felicia's off to visit the elusive Johnny instead of Grandma, the big bad wolf could care less. As soon as he spots her his taste buds start performing a ritual dance and our little miss mistakes him for a puppy dog. Fortunately, it's not so much the story as the storytelling that makes FELICIA'S JOURNEY so mesmerizing, and both director Egoyan and  writer William Trevor are excellent storytellers that have the uncanny ability at finding the macabre in the mundane. Egoyan also has an incredible talent for taking a popular tune and putting into a specific context thus allowing it to work in unison with the images to tell the story with much greater depth. In making this film so effective, Egoyan owes much to the performance of Bob Hoskins who manages to take a character so despicably horrific and infuse him with such a tremendous sense of loneliness and isolation, that we actually feel sorry for him.",1106784000,,1494,4.768339768339768
1082611,4,6305816689,"Felicia's Journey is a film that I admire more than like. Base on the novel by William Trevor, Egoyan's adaptation is a dreary, very slow paced, and haunting tale of a young pregnant girl searching for her missing boyfriend, and unwittingly getting involved with a serial killer. The story is told with no blood or gore, but manages to be unsettling because of the solid performances by the entire cast. Bob Hoskins' Hilditch is in many ways like Norman Bates in PSYCHO, an innocent driven so crazy by an unstable mother (an eerie Arshinee Khanjian, Egoyan's wife) that he has grown up with a need to kill. This is the most fascinating aspect of the story and I would have liked it seen explored some more. Felicia's Journey is definitely not for all tastes. Its pacing is deliberately slow and might not work for some, but it is a good film, if not a great one, full of Egoyan's trademark style. It is rich in imagery and manages to tell its story effectively. It slowly creeps under the skin and lingers in the mind. Not Egoyan's masterpiece, but close.",1092441600,,1055,4.587301587301587
1082612,5,6305816689,"I have never seen a more sympathetic portrayal of a serial killer. As played by Bob Hoskins, Mr. Hilditch is a fatherly, sweet, gentle, and lonely man who is also conflicted, disturbed, and reluctantly evil. He also suffers from a lingering mother complex which is apparently responsible for his dirty, horrible little secrets. With a history of rescuing poor ""lost girls"" who are impregnated, then abandoned by their boy friends, he cannot help but try to keep them near him forever. Hilditch's latest rescuee is Felicia, a young Irish girl with a problem similar to ""the others.""

 Hoskins plays Hilditch with a quiet intensity that is both creepy, scary, but never less than sympathetic. I often felt that he needed rescuing as much as Felicia. The scenes where Hilditch, who is ironically a catering manager, watches old videos of his mother, a famous French television chef, preparing one of her famous recipes while he follows along are by turns funny and nauseating. Norman Bates would probably identify with Hildich. Thrown into the mix is a Bible carrying rescue worker and missionary who promises peace in the great hereafter to those who would only just believe. In the end her naive message save no one, not even the hapless Hilditch.

 There is a haunting and beautiful melody played throughout the film called ""The Faith In The Heart Of A Child"" which gives the simple message that if only children were more loved and respected for themselves there would be no need to rescue them when they become lonely, screwed up and loveless adults.",1084579200,2,1552,4.912213740458015
1082613,1,6305816689,"I have not read the book.
I have seen some other of Egoyan's movies.
I find this movie disturbing.
Rather, I find the obsession by our society with killers and death to be disturbing and the way this movie/story panders to it the most disturbing aspect of watching it.
Egoyan seems to be particularly intrigued by the macabre and the sick. The fact that he was attracted to this movie is not surprising.
What I find more and more disturbing in our American society is our obsession with death and murder.
What is happening in Iraq is bad enough. What we see on network television about Crime Scene Investigation and all the other sick network programming that uses the common theme of Death and murder is more disturbing.
We are a very sick society. Our American society is based on Fear, the fear of Terror and our obsession and trivialization of Death and Murder, our incomprehensible schism regarding Death and Murder and Terrorism and how we think it's ok to impose out political agenda on other countries, while we profess to abhor violence?!
Like Al Quida, we are hypocritical: it's ok to kill and murder if it matches the political aims of our despotic leaders at the Pentagon and the White House: or for Network Television or because it would make a good Hollywood movie.
But we profess to be peace loving while we kill.
We wallow in this type of sick victimization of a poor innocent while we watch as voyeurs to some perverted spectacle wondering if the main character will get away with it or not.
I'm sorry to say I watched it to the end to find out.
As long as we view this type of film as entertainment, we will also have the blood of the innocents on out collective hands in places like Iraq, Afghanistan, and in the ghettos of America. And politicians like George W Bush will find a way to rationalize it in the name of freedom and God and Country. What is most sick is not that we are now torturing prison detainees in Iraq, but that we as a nation condone the fraud and lies and the corruption of our President in the name of Democracy. We buy into the lies, just as this girl bought into the lies of Bob Hoskins character in this movie.
This is why I don't care to see the trash that is most of the standard Hollywood fare these days. I don't see this movie as a complex psychological thriller. It's just plain symptomatic of our very sick society.",1083542400,3,2367,4.456221198156682

It is a very good serial killer flick that took me by surprise. Normally I would scan over a movie like this one when playing it on the television but this one really did grip me. Fans of films like ""Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer"" should not miss this one. It really is not that bad at all and even for its PG-13 rating contains some very disturbing bits.
In short, do not miss this serial killer flick because it looks like one of those silly dramas that old women like to watch (Opps that sounds sexist, but you know what I mean).",1074470400,,752,4.229166666666667
1082615,4,6305816689,"This film is, I must admit, my introduction to Egoyan's works. He is a director who comes highly recommended by a friend whose taste in films I admire.
  There is, indeed, much to admire about Felicia's Journey. The cinematography is excellent, with many memorable frames. One that particularly sticks in my mind is a shot of a nuclear power plant, brilliantly photographed, that captures the emptiness of the landscape, as well as being a harbinger and symbol of the roiling emotions that lay beneath the surface of the main character's (Hilditch's)calm exterior. There are many such nuances in the film. Egoyan is clearly a director with a sure hand.
  We know from the outset of the film that there is something not quite right about Hilditch (Bob Hoskins). What makes the character interesting and keeps us in suspense for a time, is that the character can go either way. Early on, it looks as if he may just be a mild mannered eccentric who has a compulsion about the proper preperation of food. We see him comically standing at the prep table in his elaborate home kitchen, carefully mimicing the step by step instructions of a rather ditzy French Lady Chef on a small screen TV.
  The same is true of Felicia (Elaine Cassidy), who arrives at the customs desk in England, having come over by ferry from N Ireland. She is the ultimate rube, not even realizing that Northern Ireland is part of the UK, when the customs officer explains that that is why she doesn't need a passport. We are set up to expect very little out of naive, lost-girl Felicia.
 The first indicator that something is not right with Hilditch is conveyed very subtly. Directly after the characters first meet and Hilditch has directed Felicia to a factory where she might possibly locate her boyfriend (the object of her visit), the camera shows Hilditch stopping his car and checking Felicia out in his rear view mirror for a fleeting moment. We know from that moment that there are ominous things on the horizon. We just don't know how onminous or how severe. As the plot and the characters develop, we gradually come to learn the sordid truth.
  Excellent preformances from the leads and several supporting characters (particularly from Egoyan's wife, Arsine Khanjian). The Lost Girl scenes (as viewed from a secret video camera planted on the dashboard of Hilditch's car) were fairly effective in the final edit. Yet the extended scenes in the DVD extras showed just how painfully amateurish these young actresses actually were. First year drama class material. The East Indies Bible lady was also playing to stereotype and her expressions consisted more of mugging than acting.
  In the final analysis, the film was satisfying enough to make me want to seek out more Egoyan films. I think The Sweet Hereafter will be next on my list.

1082616,1,6305816689,"I hated this movie. Between this role and his disgusting role in ""Nixon,"" Bob Hoskins has officially lost all of my respect. He did a great job as an obsessed psychopath, and the movie was well done, but it's the kind of movie that does not need to be made. Extremely inappropriate and disgusting. The movie was artsie, but very slow moving. Once the plot began to unravel, I was waiting for the movie to end. The only reason why I finished it was because I was watching it for a class. This movie is the most disturbing movie that I have ever seen. I would never recommend it to anybody. It is a sickening and disgusting waste of time.

1082617,4,6305816689,"Despite the mixed to negative reviews this film received, I quite liked it. It wasn't dramatic, considering the subject matter: an isolated middle-aged man who befriends then kills young girls in trouble. Yet I somehow liked that, along with its pace, slow or not; the location shooting and the acting. The book, I think, was set in the mid-70s, and the film doesn't specify an era, so it is realistic in its portrayal of an impregnated Irish girl arriving in England seeking the boyfriend who has helped her get into this condition without leaving her an actual address. Befriended by Bob Hoskins, a caterer suffering from a childhood traumatized by a bullying mother, she finds herself drugged then trapped in his house, which she escapes by chance. That the viewer is clued into what Hoskins does with the girls he befriends via videotapes he has made of them in his car is subtle and effective. Hoskin's character has spent his whole life in the largish house in which he spent his miserable childhood. This, if anything, is the reason why he kills: a solitude relievable only by befriending then trapping people in his car or, like Felicia, his house, disposing of them as they realize the warped mind this man actually possesses. This isn't Egoyan's best film (""The Sweet Hereafter"" might be)but it shows that the filmaker's subject matter is diverse and his direction skilled.",1032739200,5,1383,4.889361702127659

This movie is an UNBELIEVABLE borefest.  I kept waiting and waiting for this movie to pick up from its sedated state and it never did.  All that happened was me falling asleep.  About an hour and 20 minutes into the movie I found myself wanting to stop it, but a part of me made me finish watching.  I told myself ""something is bound to happen, the ending will be shocking!""  But then once I realized that would never happen, I kept it running because I figured ""I've gone through so much, I have to finish this, or else it will all be for nothing.""  Nothing about this is shocking.  Even if should be remotely shocking whatsoever, that aspect of it gets lost in the fact that it is so BORING.  Slow movies are great, as long as they have something entertaining in them, or build up to something.  This movie had nothing to offer and one of the most dull climaxes I've ever seen.  I gave it a chance, and Felicia's Journey feels more like a Wisconsin Death Trip.  Avoid, unless you are an insomniac and want to go to sleep.",1023062400,2,1201,4.256637168141593
1082666,4,6305816689,"""Felicia's Journey"" is an intriguing psychological thriller about a pregnant young Irish girl who goes to England looking for the father of her baby and finds instead a psychotic, middle-aged man disguised as savior. The brilliant Canadian director, Atom Egoyan, literally isn't quite at home with the material or the location [it was shot in Great Britain]. Consequently, the movie is not quite as good as my two favorites of his, ""The Sweet Hereafter"" and ""Exotica"", though it shares that same fascinating, hypnotic quality I so much admire.
As Joe, a man whose facade conceals some dreadful secrets, Bob Hoskins is awesome. He seems so innocent and well-meaning until you notice how quickly the look in his eyes can go from benign to malignant. Elaine Cassidy is just about perfect as Felicia, the young girl. She gives her dignity and purpose, portraying her as a good girl who doesn't have a clue as to how to deal with her problems. She lets Joe lure her in, not because she is stupid, but because she is innocent and unworldly.
This is not a commercial movie. One of the main reasons is that Joe is not an over-the-top villain. He is all too similar to lots of people we see every day. He does appear to be a bit furtive and secretive at times, but not so much so that anyone would suspect his dreadful other side. He is not over there in some special place we pretend madmen live in. He's just the nice man who lives next door. We can't distance ourselves from him easily, and that's an uncomfortable feeling. We are much more at home with the likes of Hannibal Lecter, who safely exists only in a book or a movie.
Despite its faults, ""Felicia's Journey is much better than the average thriller, in particular because its images stick with you long after you've seen it.

There's not any other director who can make a film which is scary as hell as Felicia's Journey while the audience can't even see a drop of blood within the 116-min runtime. It's also a luxury sitting through the film when you see the unique way Egoyan moves the camera. Mychael Danna's music is superb as usual though a little bit more experimental than in pervious works.

That being said, there are a lot of good things about this film.  The cast is superb -- Elaine Cassidy is perfect as Felicia, and a better choice than Bob Hoskins as Mr. Hilditch I can't imagine.  Both of them turn in memorable performances here.
The thing that makes it impossible for me to give this film a higher recommendation is Egoyan's inexplicable urge to add elements to Trevor's story.  Without writing a 'spoiler' review, I'll just mention that the entire 'videotape' take on Hilditch's 'memory lane', as well as the cooking videos he watches are products of Egoyan's imagination -- they were not present in the novel, and it certainly didn't lack for their non-existence.  It annoys me that Egoyan couldn't leave well enough alone -- and it makes me wonder if he succumbs to this temptation with every film he's done.

In order to appreciate the subtleties for Egoyan's works, you have to appreciate their thematic elements, not to mention his methods of storytelling, as well as his wonderful cinematic eye. ""Journey"" is a character study in madness, as well as loss. Loss of home, loss of love, loss of innocence. How does one deal with these things? Some must grow up, other must murder.

 Felicia is knocked up by a visiting Irish lad who lives around Birmingham. Without letting her family know that she has gone far beyond their interdictions of her relationship, she gathers up some money and jumps the ferry to England. Did I forget to tell you that he never bothered to give her his address? All she knows is that he works in the manufacture of power lawnmowers.
 Mr Hilditch, son of a deceased French female TV chef, has built his life on cooking his mother's recipes for himself and for the factory workers for whom he runs an inhouse cafeteria. He is fascinated by Felicia (as he was with other ""wayward"" girls in the past) and seems to stalk her with good advice and officious, somewhat suspect, help as she fails to find her beau.
 What prevents Mr Hilditch from drugging and killing the helpless Felicia, who has just had an abortion at his behest, is a sudden and unexpected confrontation with a West Indian woman street preacher who quite suddenly makes Mr Hilditch confront himself for the first time. His pattern of unexamined repetitive behavior is suddenly shattered. In the confusion, Felicia escapes; and the poor gourmet/killer has no recourse but to put an end to all his compulsions in the most decisive way possible.
 Given the subject matter, why are the scenes in Ireland suffused with a haunting Celtic sympathetic sadness? And why is Hilditch in love with his dead mother, and why does he spend all his time watching her videos and following her movement for movement as she concocts fabulous French dishes, which he eats alone?

Most Serial Killers came from normal homes with no abuse, just your normal dysfunctional family stuff. (Ex: Jeffery Dahmer, Ted Bundy, Gary Ridgeway.) The ones that did have controlling mothers like Ed Gein, didn't kill their victims because they saw those people as human beings each with an individual name.  Ed made furniture out of their parts and ate their organs, To him they were pieces of meat not human at all just generic middle aged women that reminded him of his domineering mother, who he had to subjugate.  And I have no doubt that Ed Gein did not know his victims names.  This comes closest to John Christie and his murders.  He would gain a women's confidence by being friendly, offering them money, general  help , even to the point of offering to perform  abortions. But all of this he did to KILL Them not to keep them, not because of loneliness or a desire for a relationship, and also not because they were going to leave.  But simply because he was a sexual sadist necrophile  who killed to satisfy his needs.  I love Bob Hoskins, but even with him,  I could not give it more than one star.  Also serial killers take, they don't hesitate.  This is more of a stalker controlling situation.  More of a controlling manipulator.  Like those shows on battered wives, and their stalker boyfriends or husbands.  In their case they are not kind to the women,  they abuse women verbally physically mentally and then when she tries to leave they kill her.  Maybe I'm just too versed in true crime and human behavior.

Hoskins' performance as a deviant, yet not outwardly dangerous stranger is excellent.  Cassidy's portrayal of a girl fresh out of an Irish village is equally convincing.  The movie is also extremely picturesque moving from rural Ireland to the British Midlands with a beautiful score of Irish-language music.  Ultimately, Felicia's Journey is one of emotional healing and recovery from trauma.  This is an outstanding, overlooked film that will never be outdated.",1408838400,2,875,5.397058823529412
