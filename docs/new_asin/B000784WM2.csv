This often happens. Two completely different products get mistakenly linked together.

And so, my review of the ""Tough Guys"" video box.
Its three DVDs contain nine quite common public domain titles. There are no extras.

The John Wayne trio are his 1930s hour-length cowboy programmers. Kirk Douglas is represented by a superb film noir in which he and his pre-surgery nose are in support, a Technicolor spectacle about a logging baron, and a screwball comedy (of sorts) that's stolen by Keenan Wynn. James Cagney headlines an OK musical, a middling '30s crime drama, and a WWII-era film set in Tokyo.

TRIVIANA:
Don't blink or you'll miss demented ""Dracula"" co-star Dwight Frye in ""Great Guy.""
June Lockhart's parents both appear in ""Something to Sing About.""
Darryl Hickman (""Martha Ivers"") is older brother to Dwayne (""Dobie Gillis"").
Future director Blake Edwards is seen briefly as a sailor in ""Martha Ivers.""
Stuntman Yakima Canutt (featured in John Waynes's films) was a star of silent-era westerns. His flu-damaged voice was too raspy for a lead career when talkies came in.
