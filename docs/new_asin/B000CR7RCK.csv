2470547,5,B000CR7RCK,This series is amazing.  Oded Fehr is great as are the other actors.  I can't wait for this series to come out and wish it would come out sooner than it is supposed to.  It is a series you must buy.,1135468800,6,198,3.7804878048780486
2470548,5,B000CR7RCK,"I watched every episode and learned a few things about Muslims that I did not know.  This was for me, a eye opener and NOT in the negitive.  This did give me a little better understanding of the culture and religion. The acting, awesome!  I've enjoyed Oded Fehr's work since seeing him in ""The Mummy"" and ""The Mummy Returns"".  He's done quite a few other projects and this was just intense.  Michael Ealy was just awesome-I watched him in ""They're Eyes Were Watching God"" with Halle Berry.  Rest of the Cast were just great.  This was very well written and acted.  I can't wait to get my copy-just in case they happen to add deleted or extended scenes.  I'm not that big on drama, but this is worth it.",1134950400,6,702,4.37984496124031
2470549,5,B000CR7RCK,"In the shell-shocked aftermath of 9/11, Americans sought information about a culture and religion ensconced in an ongoing political dialog of the Middle East that received only sporadic attention in the media. Suddenly, people were asking, why do they hate us? A few years have passed, the war on terrorism settled into a predictable good guys-bad guys debate that yields few answers to a troubling question. Along comes Sleeper Cell to inform the public, a fictitious fanatical terrorist group infiltrating Los Angeles with plans to claim more lives for the Al Qaeda cause. Through the offices of an FBI undercover agent, Darwyn (Michael Ealy), the government monitors his activity within the rapidly evolving plot, the day of destruction more imminent in each new episode. The king of the villains is Farik (Israeli-born Oded Fehr), charged with the overall success of the mission. The other group members are Christian (Alex Nesic), a Frenchman who has found Allah; a bitter Bosnian teacher, Ilija (Peter Lubatti); and blue-eyed all-American boy turned Muslim, Thomas Allen Emerson (Blake Shields): ""The history of Islam is written in two lines: One is the black of the scholars' ink, the other the red blood that the martyrs shed.""

This series would be successful as non-stop action drama worthy of the accolades of the ""24"" aficionados, but the writers of Sleeper Cell add another level to this white-knuckle series, the subtleties of extremism contrasted with the true religion of Islam. Darwyn is a committed Muslim, sorely tested in his role as informant, ever on the lookout for an opportunity to spread the true word of Islam as millions practice it in America, without the taint of fundamentalism. Whenever one of his ""brothers"" blurts a fanatical slogan, Darwyn is ready to clarify in the true words of the Quran. Farik, on the other hand, is firmly entrenched in his hatred of everything American, harboring no mercy for innocents in his pursuit of revenge. Speaking of his mission to a superior, Farik declares, ""A man is not a Muslim until his tongue and his heart are submissive. If I fail again, you may take them both.""

In one of the most affecting episodes, a soft-spoken sheik approaches a dedicated terrorist in a Yemen jail, armed only with his knowledge of the Quran. The questioning begins, ""Brother, what is the greatest jihad?"" When he hears the answer, ""War with the infidels"", this holy man explains the true nature of jihad, the battle within the self to become Allah's holy warrior. He teaches the extremist to go beyond the hatreds he has embraced, to discover the true meaning of his religion, to live his convictions. That such a terrorist can change is a tribute to the power of this religion. When the holy man travels to America to deliver a fatwa against any Al Qaeda operating in this country, Farik is charged with stopping him by any means; this fatwa would render a death blow to the entire endeavor. With his usual canniness, Farik chooses Christian to do the deed, the one man who had sought a private meeting after hearing the sheik speak at the mosque.

In this riveting series, the terrorists move through the streets of LA with impunity, across the border to Mexico to tap financial resources from drug dealers and child purveyors, drive anthrax across the Canadian border into the States, and purchase explosives from White separatists with heroin. Meanwhile, the LAPD blunders into the middle of the FBI surveillance and Darwyn struggles to maintain his cover, until all converges in an explosive ending.

2470551,4,B000CR7RCK,"Showtime is well know for its cutting edge groundbreaking series such as ""Queer as Folk"" & ""The L Word"" , now having a show called ""Sleeper Cell"" it is accually good but not well known , Since not many people have SHOWTIME it is a shame no one can see it. The series deals on The terrorists in America and is a good series , But i am afraid it has not had enough publicity too make it talked about or making people wanted too see it , unlike SHO's newer series ""Weeds"" (which of corse didn't live up to the great expectations many had viewed) So all in all ""Sleeper Cell"" is a great special TV Series Event and would be better if more people could see it!",1134259200,7,655,4.0852713178294575
2470552,4,B000CR7RCK,"Before typing this update, I finished watching the whole series by net.  Let me tell you, folks, I'm glad my feelings for this show remains the same; I liked it when I was finishing the 3rd episode, and I still like it when it's over.  ""Sleeper Cell"" deserved to earn a nomination for Best Miniseries, either on the Globes or Emmy's.

- REVIEW [updated 12.19.05]

""Sleeper Cell"" could've been aired on any regular station, but it couldn't.  Nevermind the violence, the language, and the lewd content, 'cause these things can be toned down.  No, the controversy that laid upon the show's dependancy to regular stations is the use of terrorists.  Of course that many shows in the action/drama center have dealt with terrorists before, mostly constraint in the antagonistic affair, but never have made the terrorists completely emphazied.  By the time anyone watches ""Sleeper Cell"", there's no doubt that viewers will become sympathetic over the ""enemies of the nation.""  And since this show is from Showtime, this show will contain sex and plenty of it; heck, one of the show's hideouts is a porn store.

In this nine hour-long miniseries (ten if you count the 2-hour finale), ""Sleeper Cell"" covers the current fear of terrorism and the ignorance of the enemies we're surrounded by.  A black Muslim ex-con named Darwyn, played by ""Barbershop's"" Micheal Ealy, was freed from jail out of good behavior, after he was informed on a mission he had to take.  His mission was met by an extremist named Farik, played by ""The Mummy's"" Odeh Fehr, during a public Islamic sermon.  The extremist decides to test Darwyn through a series of private meetings, among his ""supporters.""  It only took one episode for Darwyn to earn the trust of the extremists.  What the group didn't realize Darwyn is that he is not an ex-con at all: he's really a FBI agent, playing an undercover role to follow all the plans the terrorists are making.  With little support from the bureau, it's all up to him, with a little help from his FBI partner (James LeGros), to expose them before doing what could be the most homicidal terrorist act yet.  It's tough to live a double life, especially when he's on both sides.

This miniseries isn't all about the action, as it is all about planning.  Each episode, the terrorist cell initiating their big jihad in a step-by-step direction; sometimes their plan halts when a problem is not from their hands.  They'll go from Canada to Mexico in order for the bloody act to be accomplished, and there are innocent lives wasted for the cause.  It shows that even one mistake can jeopardize everything they worked hard for.  Even if there's not a lot of action in this series, I was still hooked on it because I was both scared and entertained by the whole scenario.

I like the whole concept of the terrorists being the focus in this show, because I can how these ""enemies"" live their lives; they're committed to this insane act, but they're still people like you and I.  This concept wouldn't have worked if it wasn't for the involving characters, like a good drama should.  The three soldiers of the cell that isn't Darwyn all have secondary lives to live in.  One is a young caucasian who supports the Muslim cause, even though he's a purebred American, the other is a french womanizer who cares so much about his long-distant wife even after sleeping many women, and last one is a bosnian teacher who likes A Tribe Called Quest (now THAT's guy with good taste of hip-hop).  They all sacrified their social lives for the sake of a ""greater good"", but that doesn't mean they won't have some fun from time to time.  Even for a leader like Farik, who's as cold as extremists can be, has a life of his own.  These people may be the enemies committed for their ""honorable"" cause, but when they're not committed, they're just regular people.

For Darwyn, even his objective voided him to live a normal life.  He engages in a intimate relationship to a typical hot widow and cares for her son, but his double persona stops him from having this development go further.  He wants to, but if tells her what he's doing, it would cost him not only the mission and his life, but the people he cared for.  However, her curiosities might lead her to find the truth by herself.

Fortunately for this show, he and his love interest are not the only characters I cared for.  The deaths in the show are hard-to-swallow, and though it's not violently gratitous, it's shown in a manner that's sad to look at.  I love it when a show made me to feel sorry for the demise.  The only things I didn't love are are a few miscasting characters, and even though the character development is good, it could've been a little more natural.

If ""Sleeper Cell"" doesn't get cable viewers to subscribe to Showtime, I don't know what will...besides ""Red Shoe Diaries.""  At least people are fortunate this series is getting a DVD release. It's a captivating drama with good direction, well-done acting, and it did a great job of showing how intense being a terrorist is.  This is a terrorist's story, but there's no doubt that the outcome would be bad on their side.  As predicted as how the story lays out, the ending still made me feeling morbid.

This is Del Keyes, saying ""The enemy is here, we just don't know it.""

(info) Resources say this DVD set might contain behind-the-scenes footage and audio commentaries by the show's creators.  Knowing Showtime DVDs, I'm sure this DVD will not have any subtitles, but Closed Captioning is a guaranteed.  AND, this DVD set only costs 35 dollars.  It's surprising cheap to get 9 hour-long episodes and a couple of good extras; you can't get something like that on a HBO season set.  If you haven't seen this show and loves crime drama with a twist, and doesn't mind the mature content, this is a good buy.",1134172800,10,5821,4.656219392752203

Season one is has your written for TV ending good triumphs in the end. However season 2 is a bit more down to earth showing a bit of the weight of being an undercover law enforcement agent.

But the discussion always stops short when the questions could and should have been pushed further. Also, the way in which the FBI undercover agent gets away with many actions without being detected by the cell is frequently implausible.

2470869,4,B000CR7RCK,An exciting series especially in this time of ISIS and reported threats from Sleeper Cells.  Suspenseful and a peek in to what may be going on in this country.  It plays up looking normal and acting like you are an average person (plotting devious actions to kill as many innocents as possible).  This should be on your list if you enjoy intrigue and how Jihadi's think.  Islam may be peaceful to some but the lunatic fringe as depicted in this series proves a point.  The majority of terrorist  actions have been committed by Muslims in the name of Islam and we shouldn't ignore that fact as we respect all religions deserving of our respect.,1454371200,,643,4.5964912280701755

2471002,5,B000CR7RCK,"This is the kind of series we need on the air in the 21st century in America! Now it does boast to be ""better than 24"" on the box art yet I don't know if that's true. I would say if you compare Sleeper Cell to the first 5 seasons of 24 then no but if you compare it to seasons 6-9 then yes I would say its better. Having the series at only 10 episodes helps because it doesn't feel bloated. Michael Early is not that great of an actor but his character was likable and believable and Oded Fehr was brilliant. I liked the cast of the sleeper cell: an arrogant Frenchman skinhead, a mommies boy starved for attention, and a Bosnian immigrant whose entire family was killed all driven to Jihad and its up to Michael Early to infiltrate it and stop it. I just don't like how his character tries to promote the false notion that Islam DOESN'T promote Jihad. As an American I don't have much experience with Middle-Eastern cultures and have never read the entire Koran but  I have seen where it said to ""strike the heads off the infidels (un-believers)"". Its the media promoting this to try and be politically correct its like the gay Christians. Basically its people who take a religion and decide which of its laws to follow to fit their own personal needs. If you don't support Jihad you aren't a true Muslim and Islam is not a religion of peace. Despite these PC BS messages Sleeper Cell is a good show and I am happy in the end the terrorists were defeated and Los Angeles was  not blown up.",1424563200,,1490,4.298932384341637

2471005,4,B000CR7RCK,"It is a common misconception that Sleeper Cell was cables first failed attempt to recreate the hit show 24, in a more extreme format, and that Sleeper Cell was the precursor to the smash hit Homeland. In reality, Sleeper Cell was a highly rated mini-series that was picked up for another year. The show was actually the inspiration for Homeland, as if one were to take Sleeper Cell and mix it with 24, the result would be Homeland.

The story follows Darwyn Al-Sayeed (Michale Ealy), the FBI's best undercover agent, who also happens to be a Muslim, making him the perfect choice to infiltrate the domestic side of Al-Queda. Darwyn poses as a recently paroled Islamic militant, who wants to strike a blow against the country that imprisoned him.

Through his prison contacts, Darwyn is connected to a mysterious man named Farik (Oded Fehr), who even the FBI can't identify. Through a series of tests, Farik introduces Darwyn to the rest of his cell and together they start to plan an attack on Los Angeles.

Michael Ealy stars and played the role of Darwyn as if it were specifically written for him. Ealy is the kind of actor who is easily recognized from dozens of minor movie roles, but I've never seen him star before. The character he's playing, Darwyn, is basically Jack Bauer with a lot more self-control. He's cool and collected, but ready to take action at a moments notice, making for a great character.

Ealy is paired with Oded Fehr, of the Mummy series, and he too was terrific. Obviously you need an actor with a Middle Eastern background to play this role, but Farik isn't you're typical Al-Queda, as he is able to easily fit into the suburban community. Farik is a ruthless killer, but also has a peaceful, caring side, that really comes across in the episode where they go to Mexico.

Sleeper Cell has all the action and edge of your seat drama that 24 had, and more, because let's face it, This was a cable show. Thanks to a top notch cast, some well known Directors, and a great team of Writers, Sleeper Cell was a sleeper hit on Showtime, that was easily overlooked, because it was only on for a short time. Besides only having 18 episodes, Showtime originally presented the show in a very strange way, airing all the episodes on back to back nights. This means that combined, both seasons were on the air for less than a month, and in a time before on demand had gotten popular. That is why this series was so overlooked, but thanks to Netflix, Me and thousands of others have been exposed to this hidden gem, that is worth every second that you put into to watching it.",1417910400,,2591,4.563440860215054

2471017,4,B000CR7RCK,"Well written and well acted. Still the subject matter is disturbing. Religious extremism is but an excuse for human beings to behave with evil intent upon their brothers. Excrement is just what it is; murder is murder, and hate is hate. Using an ideology to enact crimes against others is just plain wrong. And stupid. I can't watch anymore shows like this that exploit and make a buck off of such ridiculousness!  Call it reality?  I call this kind of drama......sad.  Find another topic--as this, the twisted beliefs of extremists pitted against the 'heroes' of redemption??? Nutz. Neither is correct. Still both are present.

2471029,5,B000CR7RCK,"Good ensemble cast with a lot of edge-of-the-seat suspense and tension.  Stays with the main plot most of the time, but complicates things from time to time with the personal tensions that working undercover can bring.  Fortunately, the show stays away from soap-opera subplots (soapiness was one of the flaws of ""24"" in my opinion), and the sub-plots are handled deftly and believably.  There's enough attention to detail to make the schemes believable, although sometimes the dealings of the foot-soldiers with the higher-ups in the intelligence agencies are a little forced.

I haven't seen any of season two, but the finale of season one promises some major shifts in personnel and plot.  Should be interesting.",1403827200,,715,5.182608695652174

2471053,5,B000CR7RCK,Michael Easy was outstanding in his portrayal of the character. It was so believable I felt. It seems as if I started to understand the mindset of the terrorists in real life that we face living in the western world.  Also the other main actors were very good in their roles in addition.

2471081,5,B000CR7RCK,This series gives insight to the extreme measures radicals will go to for their warped sense their God's will. It is amazing to see the personal side of members of the cell. The leader has a loving family and yet cares nothing about killing other loving families.....not on a battlefield but at a ballgame or a mall.

2471086,5,B000CR7RCK,"I just finished season one of this show and I loved it.
Iv watched other shows based on terrorism, 24 and homeland and both are very good but this is on another level of authenticity and shows the pure brutal nature of the subject.
Through out the show you will see people being beaten, totured, stoned, beheaded, tons of nudity and racism.
The characters and acting is excellent.
Since the show is based on terrorism, and the main characters are mostly are terrorist is it wrong to have a favorite character who happens to be a terrorist?
Overall an amazing show, sad it only lasted two season.",1376265600,,595,4.570093457943925

You may  ask, ""Can I consume programming like '24', 'The Sopranos', 'Dexter', without bruising my humanity?"" Will we ever know? Beyond that, Sleeper Cell benefits from excellent acting and writing.

I thought 'why not' since it is available for free HD streaming with a Prime account. I wasn't expecting it to be better than Traitor but my God was it; the characterization is such that only a true legit hour-long ""premium"" tv show can do. From episode one I was hooked and I wanted to know more about the characters, who couldn't get any less stereotypical. Best of all might be Oded Fehr's portrayal as a radical Jihadist (I read that Fehr, ex-Israeli Navy and native of Tel Aviv, was appauled at the idea of playing the character until he read the script). Unfortunately his career seems to be overshadowed by his roles on The Mummy, Deuce Bigalow, and Resident Evil.

The show incorporates a look at how Islamic terrorism will seek out non-stereotypical(read: non-Arab) recruits, the differences between mainstream Islam and the Nation of Islam, etc. All packaged together in a truly thrilling show. The show is much different than 24, as one reviewer has pointed out, but in terms of writing and acting, it IS much better. Is it 100% realistic? No, but it conveys a feeling of verisimilitude all through out. Some reviewers criticize it as apologizing for Islam. Really? The show portrays honor killings and a stoning. As for the portrayal of the FBI, how do people think 9/11 happened? Bureaucracies screwed up big-time. This one is good--very good.",1336176000,3,729,5.083333333333333
2471134,5,B000CR7RCK,"This is a very good show.

It tries to tackle the complicated issues of the conflict between East and West. The main protagonist is an American undercover FBI agent in a US based sleeper cell. The main antagonist is a middle eastern executive that works at a US security firm thats trying to launch a major terrorist attack in Los Angeles, CA.

It also dives into the darker side of the drug trade, sex slavery, and other vice issues that generate money for terrorist/criminal organizations. It also depicts the upper echelons of US Agencies that have little understanding of the problem/issues that are the seed of the conflict. This is counterbalanced by the work and frustrations that the main protagonist has to contend with while trying to complete his mission AND not getting killed doing it. The show gets kind of unnerving when they illustrate possible ways that terrorist groups get through customs, borders, and counterintelligence. I also liked that they show that all muslims are not terrorists and all terrorists are not fighting for the same reasons.

The writing holds no punches. The acting is top notch. The scenarios are believable. This is definitely worth checking out.",1335484800,,1189,4.994949494949495
2471135,5,B000CR7RCK,Was new and sealed as described.  I loved the first season so much that I also purchased the second season.,1321315200,,107,4.35
2471136,5,B000CR7RCK,"Yes I said 24 for grown-ups! Look, I loved the 24 series as much as the next guy. Saying that, let's be real here and say 24 did have some unbelievably  absurd circumstances and twists at times. What Sleeper Cell does that 24 did not is bring realism to the table. Where 24 felt like you were watching an entertaining TV series (and it was), Sleeper Cell feels like you are watching real life events unfold. The writing is superb, but most of the credit for this can go to the acting and character development. The main character is truly phenomenal in portraying the stresses of undercover work and in his commitment to fighting for his religion's true meaning. Having this character be a true Muslim is key in making this show work, as you can see his drive to go through what he goes through. The show is careful to not make its existence a Saturday morning in between cartoons message that not all Muslims are bad. Most rational people already know this and the show is careful not to insult our intelligence.

The show doesn't do everything right, it at times humanizes the terrorists a little too much and seems to create excuses for their existence. Believe it or not, not every terrorist has a rational motive for becoming what they are. Not every terrorist was wronged, in poverty, or raised to be that way.

There are few inconsistencies with the show, but they are so unnecessary that you have to wonder why they were in the script. The French guy's wife saying he used to be a good man....when? He was a Nazi turned terrorist! Why did this super secret cell with a leader who never made mistakes let this stupid anger management impaired blonde kid in the cell? He was a disaster waiting to happen. What was up with the Bosnian karaoke rap? Why did the truck driver think he was going to be killed after hearing the Islamic date of the attack, when the UC FBI agent didn't even understand the date and got it wrong!? Just a few silly things that could have been left out, with the awesome writing I am surprised they made their way in. In all honesty I am being very nitpicky here, the show was that good.

While the show seems to go out of its way to be politically correct in making each terrorist from a different origin, it is actually closer to reality than many may think. Only about 30% of Muslims are actually Arab, and more and more ""homegrown"" terrorists are surfacing which makes profiling extremely difficult.

In conclusion, people here saying this show is left wing, liberal, PC, etc....are saying so with ignorance. This is coming from someone who voted Bush/Cheney twice and miss them now. I am also speaking from a position of experience and education here when I say while the show is dramatized to entertain it is also, for the most part, accurate in many ways. Yes it touches on subjects like the general ignorance of Americans when it comes to Islam, which ironically is what those same ignorant people are criticizing.",1315612800,2,2952,4.562264150943396
2471137,5,B000CR7RCK,"It's a good show that didn't get a long enough run.  This show appeared while many were still tip toing aroung terrorism after multiple real-life tragedies.

Extremely well acted and photographed, your drawn into each characters role in this series to the point that you feel that your part of the team and left guessing constantly on what direction the cell members will take next in their often distorted views of a Holy war against the U.S.

2471139,4,B000CR7RCK,"Sleeper Cell is by far the most realistic account of Islamic terrorism that I have seen yet. My only complaint with the show is the seemingly unwritten policy of political correctness with regard the the Muslim community.

The shows producers seem to be of the ""Radical Muslims have nothing to do with real Islam or the Koran"" persuasion. Simply read the Koran, study the results of a poll of the Muslim community or observe the rhetoric of ""mainstream"" Islamic groups such as CAIR to see if this notion holds up under scrutiny. It doesn't.

Other than that, the show is fantastic. I'm really sorry it didn't carry for more than two seasons.",1310083200,2,641,4.714285714285714

2471141,5,B000CR7RCK,Superb series which aired on Showtime.  I was eagerly awaiting additional seasons however the series was cancelled after only two seasons.  Each season portrayed a terrorist act from initial conception/planning to completion and the efforts of law enforcement team to prevent the completion of the terrorist act and avert a major disaster.  The acting and story line were great --- it is realistic and could easily be based on a true story.  Numerous other reviewers have outlined the story exceptionally well so I will not repeat it here.

2471142,3,B000CR7RCK,"a friend lent me this and I actually did buy the first season. It stands up pretty well to similar stuff like '24'. It is mostly well written, the action pieces are well staged, more convincing and less flashy than most US thrillers of this ilk. Michael Ealy turns in a convincing portrayal of a 'terrorist with a conscience', Oded Fehr is similarly convincing as the cold blooded extremist, and Henri Lubatti, in a typical Eastern European role, is a good solid actor. So far so good. I did feel though that the French skinhead & all American jock with a mommy problem were not particularly convincing, too stereotyped, and maybe should have been merged into one character. As another member of the cell bit the dust in Ep 1, it was a little distracting to have to head count instead of just watching the plot unfold. And then there was Melissa Sagemiller's single mother, Gayle. Which is where the stereotyping really revved up. Not only is Gayle a single mom but she smokes, drinks beer right out of the bottle and falls into bed with a guy she picked up at a party But it was a kid's birthday party, so that's okay... give me a break! Oh well, at least she didn't have a drug habit or get a job at the lapdancing club where they all adjourn after offing one of their number in the desert - saving that for next week obviously! Muslim women characters were - well, yeh, stereotyped - again. I did like it, it was cracking, sometimes thoughtful drama that got pulled after 2 seasons, which is a shame as I felt it was just getting interesting.",1268179200,,1545,4.443661971830986

It is so genuine, and reflects an authentic understanding of the complex realities of Islam's inner struggle with its own identity in the face of extremism.  There are no black-and-whites.

And there are no forced plots designed to heighten thrills.  The plots are driven by the characters and avoid the artificial devices so common in ""24.""  (If I see another ""I can't tell you on the phone, I have to meet with you so I can get into danger"" or ""The super dangerous prisoner is due to be transported for no reason right in the middle of the crisis"" ploy, I will gag!)

While not apologizing for the terrorist's evil deeds, the series does explore the psychological motivations of the terrorists, each of which is brought to the jihad for different reasons. Among the clan are: A blonde-haired, fair-skinned white guy who fancies himself a Koran expert and seems to be drawn to the terrorist group out of a sense of rebellion against the army and his mother; a schoolteacher by day who became a jihadist based on his experiences living in Yugoslavia, where Muslims were persecuted; a thuggish Frenchman who seems enraptured with violence but who is unintellectual and not seeped in religious tradition. The main character, a black Muslim FBI agent, struggles to fit in with the group despite despising what he sees as the distortion of his faith.

2471155,5,B000CR7RCK,"Set in our modern day post-9/11 world, ""Sleeper Cell"" doesn't leave out any details of terrorism today. It shows you how the terrorists operate and what our government is doing to handle it. It shows you how terrorists recruit, who they recruit, how they generate finances, how they acquire weaponry, how they plan and strategize, how they train, how they evade the authorities, and much more. More importantly, the viewer is always reminded that Islam is not the faith of terror, particularly in episodes four and six.
What really makes this show unique is that the hero is a practicing Muslim (all the better for him to go undercover) serving his country. You don't see that everyday on TV. Not to mention, the writers of the show are Muslim too.
""24"" is very one-dimensional with all the gun fighting and bravado. It's always ""The terrorists are in town, let's send in Jack Bauer."" Those who think this is another version of ""24"" will be disappointed. ""Sleeper Cell"" is not all action; it has quite a bit of drama in it. It manages to show each of the characters (terrorist and non-terrorist) in a human light. The acting and the cast is nothing short of excellent and it is generated through brilliant writing.

People should now learn not to Generalize and that there is the bad and the good in every religion and nation.

2471181,3,B000CR7RCK,"24 was groundbreaking when it came out and is still a terrific high-suspense show.  I read that Sleeper Cell was better than 24 (a few reviews stated that, not just on Amazon) so I had to give it a shot.  I wished 24 was not mentioned at all because I held the standard too high for this show.  It is nowhere hear 24 because they are completely different.  This show is much slower, has much more character development (we find out background info on most characters), but is still a very good show.  Nowhere near as high-energy as 24.  SPOILER ALERT ---

The ending was far too Hollywood....at least in 24 good doesn't always beat evil without civilian casualties.  Anyone who says this show is better than 24 is saying that just for shock value.  Its not true.  See it, but forget the 24 comparison.  One thing that bothered me a great deal was how painful it was for the main character (Special Agent...Darwin) to complete the tasks given to him by his crew.  I mean they would totally have caught on that he wasn't really with the program after always trying to do the right thing and avoid civilian casualties and arguing with their plans.

2471183,4,B000CR7RCK,"Ok, let's face it.  Any show is meant to entertain.  Sleeper Cell does just that.  But this series left me affected forever about my idea of a ""terrorist"".  With an ongoing war in Iraq and after 9/11, most of us have had very poor feelings about any ""Middle Easterners"" we have seen on the streets of our country.

After viewing Sleeper Cell, I was happy to see some different views projected on the Muslim religion.  Our family has Muslim friends and these people are anything but violent.  The undercover FBI agent in this series was himself a Muslim.  What opens your eyes to possiblity, is the fact that many of non Middle Eastern descent are portrayed as terrorists.  I found it entirely shocking, yet believable, that many born in the USA people with grudges both with our government and our society as a whole could be induced into a terrorist cult.

  I will never again view any Middle Easterner I see on the streets of my town as suspect.  I do embrace the fact that a terrorist can be anyone, from anywhere.  If the network meant to entertain me.  They did that.  If the Network intended this as something to make me think.  They have achieved this too!

  And on terrorists, while I am here.  What do you call Christian radicals that bomb abortion clinics and kill doctors?

Every religion has had radical sects now, and in times past.  Every religion has had its great people too.  Let's face it.  In the very open world in which we now live, we need to come to understand the difference between a religion and the radical offspring of one.",1143158400,5,1553,4.51985559566787

Go outside, read the paper (well that may be a stretch), look around and you will find realism. Heck, I know Batman doesn't exist nor do the Klingons really pose a threat, but they are entertaining.

2471186,2,B000CR7RCK,"I know that this show has gotten good reviews, and I am prepared to admit that it is an interesting idea, well-acted, and not without excitement.

But as someone who has studied terrorism and counter-terrorism as a hobby for years as well as someone who works inside the Intelligence Community (albeit not as a counter-terrorism specialist), I really found the opening episode's finale unlikely.

I'm referring to the scene where the undercover FBI agent is present where the cell's leader reveals that a member has been indiscrete and must be punished by burying him up to his neck and stoning him to death.  To prove that he is a true jihadi, the FBI agent is expected to take part.  What does he do?  He grabs the gun of the cell's leader and ""mercy kills"" the indiscrete terrorist.

Now, I undeerstand that an undercover FBI agent --someone like ""Donnie Brasco"" the mafia infiltrator-- might have to commit minor crimes to preserve his cover.  But the notion that the FBI would give an operative to commit murder in order to build his credibility with a terrorist cell is just flat out silly.

Now, I imagine the response from some will be:  the FBI agent had to do this to save his neck, and in the course of the series, he will conceal his awful secret.  What's wrong with that picture?

Well, first of all, I have a very strong feeling that an FBI agent in such a situation is going to get polygraphed at one time or another in order to make sure that he hasn't broken the rules (like taking part in a murder).  Polygraphs are hardly infallible , but given the gravity of what the FBI agent had to do, he might just show some reaction when he's asked if he committed any serious crimes during his undercover stint.

And let's not forgeet about the rest of the legal process.  If the FBI agent is ever called to be a witness against his erstwhile comrades in the cell, he's going to be asked by their defense attorneys -who will know because their clients have told them-- whether he did in fact take part in the murder. So the FBI agent will either have to admit to committing a murder on the witness stand and blow up the case.  Or he can commit perjury, which will be another serious crime that might be on his mind for his next polygraph.

""Sleeper Cell"" might be good entertainment for people whose understanding of the intelligence world comes from movies and novels.  But I think anyone who likes something called ""realism"" in something that is marketed as being realistic would be advised to avoid it (or failing that switch off their higher brain functions while watching it).",1141776000,11,2591,4.561555075593953

2471188,5,B000CR7RCK,"SLEEPER CELL is set in present day, post 9/11 America and capitalizes on the country's fear and paranoia about terrorist organizations. Michael Ealy stars as Darwyn Al-Sayeed, a muslim F.B.I. agent who has managed to infiltrate an Islamic terrorist cell in Los Angeles, led by Farik Al-Faris (Oded Fehr). Darwyn tries all along to uncover the groups plans of attack, trying to diffuse them or put a stop to them as best as he can with the help of his F.B.I. partner Ray (James LeGros).

SLEEPER CELL is a brave and intelligent show that delves into the grey areas and doesn't just look at the world in black and white, or good and bad. The show explores the reasons why the ""terrorists"" choose the path of Jihad, and also goes deeper into the lives of all of the characters to give us a better understanding of each one's personality. It also explains and teaches us about the rift that is within Islam, between those that wish for peace and say the Quran's true teaching is peace and love and those who wish to fight Jihad in the violent way.

This show manages to get a lot of points across and is handled with such sensitivity and compassion, I wish there would be more such shows on TV.

The cast is excellent, they all have a really good chemistry that makes you forget they are acting, which I think is the mark of a good production. Oded Fehr is just a tremendous actor, since The Mummy when he took on the small part of Ardeth Bay and created an unforgetable character. Michael Ealy slips  seamlessly in this role, I cannot of anyone else who could have played Darwyn better, and Alex Nesic and Henri Lubatti make for great supporting characters.

The soundtrack is hauntingly good as well!

Its great to watch good intelligent TV, Sleeper Cell is such a breath of fresh air amongst all the other mind-numbing TV shows. Plus, it is such a riveting show that you keep on thinking about it, long after you've watched it. I'd give it 50 stars if I could.",1139529600,25,1959,4.48876404494382

The stars are well fitted to their characters and concentrates more on the learning of terrorist ways/beliefs and not so much on inside bureaucratic B.S. like 24 does. After watching 4 seasons of 24, I had no idea terrorists believe they will be awarded 72 virgins in heaven. I learned that fact in watching just the first 5 shows of Sleeper Cell. Not long after that airing, that is when all the TV networks announced it on talk shows and in the news. I would recommend both 24 and Sleeper Cell, but if you have to chose just one, Sleeper Cell would be the winner.",1136851200,8,716,4.431818181818182
2471191,5,B000CR7RCK,"I loved this show so much because it was so much different than any other show on TV these days. Sleeper Cell dealt with the very sensitive matter of terrorists and I think they handled it very well. Not only that but I walked away from this show knowing a lot more about Muslims than I did when I started watching it. It was also very interesting that Tommy who is white was a Muslim and it was very interesting to see how it played out over the course of the show.

The show follows Darwyn who is an undercover FBI agent who tries to get recruited into the Sleeper Cell, a terrorist organization run by Farik. Darwyn is recruited to help Farik and fellow Muslims Khashul, Tommy, and Iilija as they plan to set of a bomb in LA. Through the ten hour show Darwyn must perform gain Farik's trust by ways that aren't legal and raise the eyebrows of the FBI. He also is in a relationship with Gayle who slowly starts to uncover what Darwyn is doing when he is not around her. The show is similar to Over There in being about a current conflict in the U.S. but it deals with the terrorists and a lot of it focuses on Islam. The authentic Arabic dialogue adds to the glory of this show and I think the acting was excellent.

My only problem with Sleeper Cell is that it was only nine episodes. The finale left me craving for more and I'm glad this DVD is priced so well, so I can relive the adventure as many times as I want. I hope that they include the Sleeper Cell: Know Your Enemy documentary with it and the additional special features look good.
