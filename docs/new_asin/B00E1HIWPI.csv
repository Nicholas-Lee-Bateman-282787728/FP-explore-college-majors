8600039,5,B00E1HIWPI,"Very good documentary; honest yet respectable.  Rare considering the flack Tebow gets for his expressions of his faith.  The guy is a winner.  Sure, he has his flaws, but his intangibles on and off the field, though controversial, more than made up for them.  Too bad the NFL has turned into a PC machine of late.  Tebow brought inspiration (and $$$$$) to the NFL, and the NFL disowns him because he took a knee in prayer; yet the NFL coddles those that took a knee in disrespect to our nation and our flag (and LOST $$$$$$).  If the NFL keeps it up, it will certainly be the NFL; N-ot F-or L-ong !!!!!  I for one am disgusted by the league and how it handled Kapeanick and his ilk.  They are embracing the wrong things and they are paying for it.  Praying for more Tim Tebows' and Carson Wentz's!!",1516406400,6,798,4.337837837837838
8600040,5,B00E1HIWPI,"Finally, Tebow was given a real assessment of his talents and abilities.  No hateful garbage, no swooning over-hyping.  Tebow is very good football player, leader, and person that needs to improve his throwing mechanics and efficiency.  Was worth the time to see the real player.",1516320000,3,279,5.155555555555556
