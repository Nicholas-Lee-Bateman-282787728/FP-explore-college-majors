8601628,5,B00005LDPY,"What is better than a gallon of warm milk, a relaxing bubble bath and counting thousands of sheep?  THIS VIDEO!!
  Over the years, unwanted stress has gradually inserted itself into my life.  I find this video to be a peaceful respite and welcome journey into relaxation, while helping me reclaim control over my life.
  I found this video to be extremely soothing with each beautiful image flowing into the next.  The seascapes, the flowers and the concentric ripples all cushion my senses with an aura of harmony.  Waves falling upon waves project the continuity and simplicity of nature, just reaching out to envelop and comfort me.  Irritants begin to lose their power to entrap me and I find myself seeking an inner harmony that reflects these scenes.  The dialogue and video work well together to reinforce the calming effect and I find myself reaching for this video as a great transition from work to home.  I also enjoyed seeing the ""Voice of the Video"" as Dr. Williamson appears very relaxed and confident in sharing his expertise in stress reduction.  This audio/visual journey has worked better for me than any other tool I've used to reduce stress.  Thank you, Dr. Williamson!",1005004800,2,1189,4.885

I couldn't sleep one night and put this video on and fell asleep in front of the TV - something I have never been able to do. I am a mental health and substance abuse counselor and this is an excellent tool to help my clients relax, I have recommend Dr. Williamson's ""Journey into Stress Reduction"" to my clients who suffer from stress.",1004054400,,405,4.486486486486487
