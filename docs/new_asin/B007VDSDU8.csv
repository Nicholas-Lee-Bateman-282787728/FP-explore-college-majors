5111421,5,B007VDSDU8,"It is a very instructive dvd with variations on the type of burgers that could be made with Jeff Novick's method, thanks Jeff!",1345680000,4,126,4.521739130434782
5111422,5,B007VDSDU8,"Although there are some definitely amateurish qualities to this video (lighting and sound balance, to name two), the presentation and the recipes are topnotch. I have been making burgers using Jeff's basic recipe for years without realizing it! Of course, my recipes vary in the details. But his presentation has opened up new horizons to my thinking. The greatest innovation from my perspective is his method of cooking the burgers, more than the basic recipe itself. It works perfectly every time, and the burgers are far superior when cooked his way than when grilled with any kind of fat or when baked. And the oven ""fries"" are superb! I hadn't dreamed it was possible. Thank you, Jeff Novick and VegSource!",1345420800,8,711,4.933333333333334
5111423,4,B007VDSDU8,"Jeff Novick's Burger's & Fries is an excellent entertaining video about how to create healthy and inexpensive alternatives to traditional burgers and fries.  Jeff uses a basic vegan recipe for burgers and then varies it using different beans, starches, and seasonings to create different burgers.  As usual as from volume 1, the ingredients are healthy, inexpensive and vegan.

The variations appear to be centered around different cultural approaches to eating (e.g. Mexican burger, Indian burger, Middle Eastern burger (falafel) and a breakfast burger.  The fries use a standard prep method as well to assure even cooking both inside and out.  Then using different types of potatoes (russets, sweet potato, etc) and seasoning Jeff creates variations but opens the door to lots of experimentation by the buyer.

I'm knocking a star off because of the grilling and other high temp cooking in the video.  With regular meat, grilling produces two classes of carcinogens/pollutants called pahs (polyaromatic hydrocarbons)and hcas (heterocyclic amines) that are real trouble.  The vegetarian high temp grilling is more concerned with advanced glycemic endproducts, like acrylamides which can create extra junk inside us.

For me, I'm going to use Jeff's recipes but cut off the brown burnt part of the burger where most of the AGEs exist.

Overall, the video is excellent, if a little long at 2 hours.  Good eating",1343088000,5,1410,5.306306306306307
5111424,1,B007VDSDU8,Sorry...Variations of the incredibly repetitive information on this DVD probably can be found on the internet for no cost..  Having to watch the same basic recipe repeated over and over again dosn't increase the value.,1342483200,11,218,5.228571428571429
5111425,5,B007VDSDU8,"My family and I have enjoyed these recipes tremendously. Jeff's burgers are healthful and delicious and very easy to make! No fake anything. And the recipes are pretty much foolproof. I have made several versions, and now have the recipes memorized so it goes even faster. I can whip up a batch faster than it would take to get to McDonald's. And it doesn't use any electric appliances, so cleanup is a snap. The burgers are filling, and only 125 calories each. But don't let that dissuade you -- they taste great! They last several days in the fridge so I make them ahead for lunches. The video is a bit long, but Jeff is charming and honestly you really only have to watch him do the recipe once, maybe with one variation. It comes with a PDF file with the recipes written down so you don't have to take notes. Jeff simply rocks. These recipes are vegan, flour free, oil free, relevant to the McDougall plan, would be great for weight watchers, Fuhrman, Engine 2 or anyone wanting to eat HEALTHY fast food!",1341187200,39,1008,4.483695652173913
5111426,5,B007VDSDU8,"Jeff Novick shows you many creative ways to make delicious, healthy, easy, and inexpensive burgers and ""fries.""  I have made the basic burger, the Mexican burger, the Southwest Burger, and the curried Indian burger...all were wonderful!",1339372800,8,236,5.555555555555555
5111427,5,B007VDSDU8,"Well, I'm amazed. I made burgers, garlic fries, and ketchup from the video. I substituted rolled quinoa for the oats to avoid possibly gluten contaminated items. I ate my burger sans bread, but my husband used a whole wheat flat bread. I love this sort of food; it's wonderful to get Buddha-Belly full with food that sticks to the ribs and has so few calories. Although we enjoyed everything thoroughly, we didn't think our son's carnivore friends would like them at all. Since we had a houseful of hungry young adults and 6 burgers with fixings leftover, my husband asked them sheepishly if they wanted some bean burgers and flat bread. They all wanted some and ate every scrap leftover from our dinner. They all liked the ketchup quite a bit even though it doesn't taste like red corn syrup. When they asked what it was, we said it was a sort of spicy tomato condiment instead of calling it ketchup. In the midst of all the contented chomping, I heard comments like: yummy, this is good, is there any more.

The video is a good followup to volume 1. It might be another good choice for a homeschool homearts course. The girls are young adults now, and it shows in their scanty, distracting dress. Still, there is a happy comradery between Jeff and the twins that adds a nice charm to the video series. I wonder if they will be part of the next volume? Anyway it was long but enjoyable. With such great success, I plan to make all the other versions of burgers and fries.",1339027200,18,1472,4.492537313432836
5111428,5,B007VDSDU8,"Quick, easy, delicious.

Memorial Day, 2012.  What is more traditional than a backyard BBQ?  This year, family and friends gathered and feasted on ""Fast Food Burgers and Fries.""  Jeff Novick has shown that great food can be created quickly, easily, and be delicious.  There are recipes out there for lentil burgers, Tofu based veggie burgers and the like.  All are good, but none are as easy or quick as the recipes presented in this video.

These recipes will be favorites, for life.",1338508800,10,484,4.829268292682927
5111429,5,B007VDSDU8,"I almost never eat burgers--gave up meat 25 years ago and most commercially-available veggie burgers are high in fat and full of soy isolates, etc.  Homemade ones have so many ingredients my head spins (and are usually high in fat as well).

Jeff Novick's new DVD changes all that. I started with the Indian Curry Burgers and WOWZA! They're great!  I had mine ""nekkid"" as I don't eat much bread, but they'll be great to share with friends and family with all the fixin's.  I love a great meal with 5 ingredients, LOL, especially when it's quick and tastes delicious.  Both taste and texture are great and the potential variations are endless!

Another great video!  Be sure to also check out the original ""Fast Food"" DVD for more great ideas.",1337299200,17,742,4.661538461538462
5111430,5,B007VDSDU8,"Recieved this DVD a week ago and couldn't wait to see how I could make burgers and fries myself at home that were vegan, low fat, and low sodium. In the DVD Jeff and his two teenage assistants made it look easy but I was skeptical that I could cook the b burgers in a dry pan and not end up with charcol bricket or the ber burger stuck to the pan. So, I dove right in and made the Mexican Burger out of kidney, pinto, and black beans. It was really fast to mix together which I was really pleased with but the test was the ease to cook and the taste. I followed Jeff's example in the DVD, after 10 minutes in the fridge put the burgers in the pan cover and walk away for two to three minutes. Then, flip the burgers to cook for another two to three minutes. The burgers turned out fabulously. They were really good, very filling, and stored well in the fridge.

If you're longing for burgers on a low fat, low sodium vegan diet this is an excellent resource.",1336694400,57,958,4.095744680851064

5111432,1,B007VDSDU8,"First I have to say that this is a very good presentation.  Jeff Novick is a good educator and is passionate about his work.

Very enjoyable and great ideas.  Finally an option for summer cookouts for healthy eaters too.  Loved it.",1432339200,,381,4.478260869565218
5111436,4,B007VDSDU8,"Easy to follow, but I found the burgers a bit dry for my taste. It comes out better to add some finely minced mushrooms since they add water when they sweat; or much more tomatoes also for the moisture, or add coconut oil so it feels more meat.",1431129600,,244,4.104166666666667
5111437,5,B007VDSDU8,"Swimsuits, several burger recipes and oven cooked fries, this video delivers. Good video for any household.

5111441,5,B007VDSDU8,"I found this to be extremely easy to follow.  As someone who really wants to be able to eat 'healthy burgers', but doesn't want to spend a lot of time making them, I feel that Jeff has created the perfect solution.  It's such a relief to watch Jeff, in his easy-going manner, whip up each recipe in no time...with the help of the beautiful twins.  The printout is really helpful too.  Sincere thanks!!  This is very good value for the money.  Anyone who, like me, is not comfortable in the kitchen, will come away thinking, ""Hey, I can do this!""",1414108800,2,545,4.4
5111442,1,B007VDSDU8,Novick has instructions on how to print recipes that don't work. He says to insert DVD into computer and look for a specific file. I did that and I found no printable PDF files as his instructions indicate. Highly inconvenient and time consuming to have to watch video to try to figure out what the recipes are. His measurements aren't always clear on DVD.,1408924800,2,356,4.578125

5111444,5,B007VDSDU8,"Jeff shows you had to make the healthiest burgers and fries ever! If you read the back of the box of some of those store bought veggie burgers, you'd be surprised what you'd find. One name brand of veggie burgers has egg whites in it which is not an option if your vegan. Others have added fat. What's great is you can make up a bunch of these when you have time, and then freeze them. Then take out as many as you need as you go. No need to resort to store bought veggie burgers. You can flavor them in so many ways. Only your imagination is limited.",1388880000,3,551,4.064220183486238
5111445,5,B007VDSDU8,"I really enjoyed watching Jeff cook. It taught me how to make, form the burgers, how they need to be refrigerated before cooking. He also makes sausauge patties, as well as links.  His burgers are based on beans rather than tofu.",1385251200,2,229,4.585365853658536

5111449,1,B007VDSDU8,"The video itself is very annoying, poor quality and very silly. The young girls are out of place and give a weird vibe to the whole thing. The burgers are tasteless, no salt, not enough spice and they come out too soft even for a veggie burger. It is basically the same recipe for all of the burgers so they all pretty much taste the same. We had to doctor them up a bunch just to eat them.",1371772800,5,390,4.012820512820513
5111450,2,B007VDSDU8,"I have all three of the videos in this series.  I enjoyed the other two, but this one was not worth the money.

5111451,3,B007VDSDU8,"Excellent vegan burgers and demonstrations on how to prepare and cook them. The annoying thing about this video (same as the first) are the twin assistances. They are completely dumb and act like they have never been in a kitchen before. I'm not sure if Jeff was intending to target this to a younger audience or just needed someone to converse with while doing the demos. I would give it 5 stars if I wasn't so annoyed with the dumb twins in the video.

PDF with all the recipes is included on the disk.",1369785600,3,504,4.361702127659575

5111453,3,B007VDSDU8,"Jeff Novick is super smart and a good teacher, but needed to quit after 2 different kinds of burgers. I'm not sure about the ""twins"" aspect of it-- it's mildly disturbing/sexist in my opinion.  Also, couldn't download the PDF file so don't have a print out of the recipes. I would much rather spend less and just buy a cookbook from him because he really knows his stuff and I love his print material.",1368316800,4,401,4.418918918918919
5111454,3,B007VDSDU8,The video was quite humorous with the two girls constantly having to pull up their low cut shirts but the burger ideas were good.  You need to add a lot more moisture to most of the recipes as they are dry and tend to fall apart.  If you're looking for something that taste like a beef burger these recipes aren't for you.  The recipes taste pretty similar despite the different ingredients.  Does give you a good starting point to use your own creativity.,1367971200,6,456,4.457831325301205

5111456,3,B007VDSDU8,"I really wish that Jeff Novick would get more professional people to make his videos. Novick is a brilliant dietitian and an inspiring speaker. His ideas for simple, healthful food are great. However, this video could benefit greatly from professional editing. We are treated to the same information over and over again. Once you see how to shape and cook the burgers once, you don't need to see that for every recipe. Because so much information is simply repeated, this is very much overpriced. I believe that the video was edited by Jeff Nelson, father of the two girls featured. The girls are charming, but most people aren't going to want to see so much of them. From what I know of Jeff Nelson, he seems to be a great guy. However, he's not a professional, and Novick deserves a professional to work with.",1359331200,22,811,4.638888888888889

5111459,1,B007VDSDU8,"I tried a number of the burgers on the CD. Yes, these burgers are simple and quick, but not that flavorful and are so soft that when you bite into them they spill out over the edge of the bun and are messy. They need to be eaten with a spoon.

In addition to Jeff's shopping skills (Vol 3 plus the presentations on youtube) Jeff makes the transition to this new lifestyle nutrition easy.  Hopefully he comes out with Volume 5 on the Instant Pot pressure cooker, and volume 6 on the Phillips XL Air Frier (no oil) to further what he has done so well in volumes 1-4.

The burgers are outstanding. They hold together well, taste excellent and of course are easy and healthy. The only unnecessary thing I add is beat juice when I try to impress omnivours.  As for french fries, I use a DeBuyers mandolin to cut them, soak in, and boil in salt water for 4-min, then dry, then freeze. Why do I do that? No oil. Then I use the Phillips XL Air Frier with a silicon mesh lining and cook them in the sir frier (no oil) and no further added salt. Yum...

Oh, if you want a milk shake with those fries, then get a Yonanas Elite Frozen Healthy Dessert Maker, use frozen fruit to make the slush then put it in a blender with oat milk to make it to a milk shake consistency.  Yum.  Yonanas Elite Frozen Healthy Dessert Maker is a WVPB dieter's ultimate desert appliance.  Now you have all you need for a summer fest!",1496102400,3,1247,4.363636363636363
