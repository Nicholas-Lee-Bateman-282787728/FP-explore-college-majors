8090572,5,B000BPFHCU,Dr. Koger provides a new way at looking at Lyme Disease and her interesting history with it. She has studied all types of medicine and is very knowledgeable about all dimensions of Lyme's. The most fascinating part of the DVD is all the treatments she does perform on her patients. Some are radical but alot make sense in terms of how the body will react to treating itself. She also gives lots of interesting and enjoyable stories of how she has helped people who suffered from Lyme's Disease and didn't know where else to turn. Overall a wonderful buy for me and I would recommend it to anyone wanting to learn more about Lyme Disease from a whole perspective.,1146096000,,662,4.571428571428571
