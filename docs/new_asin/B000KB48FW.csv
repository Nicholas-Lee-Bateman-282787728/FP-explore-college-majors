8155401,4,B000KB48FW,I like the capoeira part it's fun.,1414281600,,34,4.0
8155402,5,B000KB48FW,"This is the best kickboxing video!  The first time I did it, I laughed.. like, there was no way I'd be able to keep up with her quick movements and how fast she changes from one sequence to another.  Within a month I knew the whole video from beginning to end, off the top of my head!  It is extremely effective, and I have never been in better shape!",1374710400,,351,4.057971014492754
8155403,5,B000KB48FW,"I used to do kickboxing all the time.  I hadn't done it for years.  I picked up this dvd at the library, and highly recommend it for intermediate to advanced.  A beginner would have to review it before using it and/or learn the basics from other videos first.  It did take me a few tries to do the workout perfectly, but I had fun every time.  I just wish that Sherri Jacqelyn did more workouts, and I would buy them. The workout focuses most on upper body, abs, and cardio.",1227139200,2,474,4.222222222222222
8155404,5,B000KB48FW,"I love this workout!  Sherri is such a fun instructor, I wish she had other dvds.  The choreography is easy so you spend your time working out and not trying to catch on to the moves.  The Capoeira at the end is killer.  Definately recommend it!",1225929600,,245,4.260869565217392
8155405,4,B000KB48FW,"I love this workout! Sherri is a straight to the point instructer.  She gets you in and going...no fluff...no fuss.  This is definitely an advanced level workout, with some high impact moves (jump kicks, multiple hop kicks & aerial jumping jacks).  However, Sherri does gives you low impact options, so you can easily modify.  Either way, you will sweat!  I have recently been introduced to Capoeira and now I'm hooked.  I bought the dvd because I read that Sherri uses Capoeira in her core conditioning at the end of the routine.  I was disappointed that there wasn't more Capoeira moves, but that won't stop me from adding this workout to my favorites list.",1191024000,4,659,4.778761061946903
8155406,5,B000KB48FW,"This workout is just as good as a cardio kickboxing or kickboxing class you would take at the Y or another gym. If you have a little bit of experience with kickboxing, you will have an easier time catching on. Purchase some easier kickboxing DVD's if you haven't done kickboxing before, but other than that I think this is a great workout. It also incorporates brazilian dance/ martial arts moves. Many workout DVD's just don't get you to sweat even a drop, but this one will keep your heart rate up. I recommend this to intermediate and advanced exercisers. This is not a waste of money and the production quality is not bad at all (don't know what the review below was talking about here...everything looks fine and is set in a nice studio) I rented this movie and now I'm going to purchase it.",1173398400,5,796,4.496551724137931
8155407,3,B000KB48FW,"The good things:

- Sherri gets your heart pumping within the first couple minutes of the workout, and it doesn't stop until sometime after the cooldown

- It's a difficult workout, which is nice ... so many other kickboxing workouts are dumbed down, they are not worth the time

- It's a long workout split into 7 min. warmup, 40 minutes heart pumping cardio, and 20 minutes butt blasting Balance and Core work

- I have not been exposed to at least half of the balance/core work before, another positive

- She reminds me a bit of a much, much less seasoned Cathe Friedrich

The bad things:

- You don't stretch enough, nor long enough: easy to take care of on your own

- There are many mistakes, and Sherri does not keep her sides straight: if you've been working out for a while, it is no big deal

- She starts out being real big on counting, but she does get over most of it by the first 1/3 of the video (if you find Billy Blanks annoying, Sherri might be too)

- The hair was distracting ... Sherri's was all over the place and so was her co-exercisers: this is the biggest problem I have, it has never bothered me in any other video

It does not have the greatest production values, but it will be staying in my keeper shelf because it is a great cardio kickboxing workout; she does not give you much time to catch your breath.

This is NOT a beginner's workout.  You need to come into this video knowing how to kick and punch properly.  You can hurt yourself if you think you will just pick it up from the instructor.

Glove weights put the finishing touch on the upper body workout.  I recommend going through the workout a couple of times before you attempt them though, a couple of the punching drills are screwed up and if you are trying to follow along visually (or verbally) you could be doing some wild swings in an attempt to catch up.",1172966400,15,1854,4.29971181556196
