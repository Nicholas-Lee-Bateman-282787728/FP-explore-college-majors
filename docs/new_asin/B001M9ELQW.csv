8320653,2,B001M9ELQW,This movie sucks but I'll buy anything with Tom Green in it.  Although I must admit it's a lot better then Bob the Butler or the Shred films he did.  The story is actually ok and the main cast do quite well but it suffers from lack of budget and feels like they rushed it,1358035200,,271,3.909090909090909

THE INVASION OF LAXDALE

This is a bit of an odd film but I knew something starring Tom Green could be this way so we knew what we were getting into. I am glad that Tom mixed his styles he has portrayed so far in film into this performance making it feel very original for him. As you all know he can be very out there such as ""Freddy Got Fingered"", ""Road Trip"", and ""Stealing Harvard"" but for those who do not know Tom Green is actually one of the finest actors working today in my opinion. Don't believe me then check out his excellent performance in a film called ""Bob The Butler"" I assure you that you will enjoy his performance in that wonderful film, excellent movie. So this one here is another notch under his belt as he continues to prove he is much more than that guy singing about his ""bum"" on TV.

Bill Swanson {Green} is an ex Hockey player who's glory days are far behind him after an accident n the NHL. So now he is just a joke around town and lives his life quietly with his dog. That is until one day his mentor is found locked up inside his house one day on the brink of death saying something about aliens and an invasion. Apparently these aliens want to take over the world because of the hot weather since they hate the cold. So now Bill and a mysterious woman named Gina Larson {Sarain Boylan} who knows more than she should are out to stop these things. Seems like another drunken Friday night around here, sorry I just had to add that.

This while in idea of alien invasion is not too original the way it is carried out is very much so. Writer/director Grant Harvey and writers Blaine Hart, Barry Kloeble, and Josh Miller [also a producer] really got creative with this one although it was not laugh out loud funny it was still good. The alien effects are something else to in a budget kinda way because they are also kinda funny, sorry guys but they could have been better. Still that just adds to the over all feel of the film. The actors do a good job although most of them are very hickish if that is even a word. This could have been really interesting with a bigger budget.

Tom Green [star/producer] is good in this as he is a little more reserved than in other roles but it is still not afraid to ham it up a bit. Green is obviously the star of this show and he is not over shined by any one else in the cast. Sarain Boylan is good in this movie as most will remember her from Saw 4 she is a good enough actress. Crispin Glover is highly annoying, brilliant, or just down right awful depending on your taste. I personally think the role called for him to be that way so it is cool with me I suppose.

This is far from the greatest movie ever made and is even far from the greatest independent film but it is still very fun. This is an out there movie with an out there cast but that is part of the charm of the film. Green is actually one of my favorite actors ever since is staring role in ""Bob the Butler"" so I can't wait until he comes with more films. I recommend a rental at first and then see from there, I bought it because of Green and am happy with it. So go forth young ones and check this movie out, good for a weekend.",1247788800,5,3176,4.132686084142395
