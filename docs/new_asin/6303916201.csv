7856114,4,6303916201,"""Alien Warrior"" is a low-budget movie that manages to combine a messianic ""alien warrior"" with a lot of fistfights, gunfights, nudity, drug-dealing, and gangs.  The movie is a strange mix of an After-School Special and a 70s action movie.  In fact, the movie crams more characters and subplots into 100 minutes than half-a-dozen bad movies do.  This alone makes the movie interesting.

Some twists:
* The hero relives the violence that he has inflicted upon others.
* The Pachucos that are turned from their evil ways do *not* have happy endings.  They still make poor, violent choices and revert to their previous behaviors, albeit for a good cause.
* Corrupt policemen are *not* caught and punished.
* The Space Shuttle program is an inspiration for one of the street kids

Some oddities:
* Not one but two attempted sexual assaults on the lead female
* Lots of martial arts
* Break-dancing
* A driller-killer

This movie has stereotypes: black pimps, black drug dealers, Pachucos with fancy cars, etc.  This may be offensive to some.

While ""Alien Warrior"" can not be taken too seriously, it does mirror life in many ways.  Few loose ends are tied up, and life goes on.  The ending is not completely satisfying, but it fits the movie perfectly.",1311724800,3,1247,4.834905660377358
7856115,5,6303916201,"no one could have actually made this movie. i refuse to believe it exists. no one on earth would consciously write this script-- not even on accident. i mean i've watched as much of this movie as i can but i refuse to believe its real. i stole my vhs copy from blockbuster's dumpster--i think it was planted by aliens. ""i must defeat great evil."" ""is great evil over there?""  I'm serious, this movie goes beyond stupidity, into realms even genius can t touch.

Is it worth watching? well, it is certainly mind boggling; there's tons of gratuitous nudity; plenty of nice 80s style car explosions (did every one in the 80s drive around with napalm and dynamite in the back seat? -- must've been the pinto influence) and violence, yeah how do i even describe the fight sequences? they're definitely very,, sequential. i mean punch, block counter punch, it all seems to be there, even when a direct hit misses by about 40 feet, in slow motion, just so you won't miss how bad it is.

but that doesnt begin to really describe what this movie is all about: its an alien prince (from another planet mind you) who comes to earth a planet so far away that the earth is as small as,, a really huge moon in its sky. the alien (who names himself buddy) comes here to defeat a great evil (any evil, he's not real picky) so he'll feel secure enough in his manhood to rule his father's empire. And he's got psychic powers. and a bum builds him this insanely cool car. and theres lots of naked chicks involved. i mean ALOT of naked chicks. so alien boy starts a gang. and a community library--with the help of his newly reformed latino rapist friends. and starts fight ing great evil,  all with the eloquence of rain man. and the deep philosophies of a retarded version of buddha; and some kung fu skills he picks up along the way. and some really big hanguns.  and his new girlfriend and;  and he helps peole overcome their child hood traumas and did i mention he fights great evil? who turns out to be mister one, who is a gang lord/ pimp/ rapist/ drug dealer. and the cops are corrupt; and it takes about 50 bad guys in about 32 classic hot rod cars to pick up a $500 protection payment but if you break a piece of wood and yell ""NO MORE!!!!"" really loud in slow motion they'll all be your friends and,,i cant even go on...

if you thought escape from new york was fun.

this is like that but without making any sense

if you admire the sci-fi blaxploitation of brother from another planet.

this is far more ridiculous

if you love watching a retarded attempt at moral preaching. by a director who's apparently lost all moral logic

this is , well this is ridiculous, beyond all sanity.

its like some really deep down racist guy set out to make a movie about racial unity and how nice it would be if we could just help our dumb minority friends and make them stop being evil

and there's even some break dancing in the name of literacy

and nothing pisses off great evil like the words ""be temperate"" spray painted on a wall somewhere.",1113177600,3,3023,4.382826475849732
7856116,4,6303916201,"Side splittingly funny in its deadly earnestness, it is Plan 9 from Outer Space meets Brother from Another Planet.  Must have been one of Laurence Fishburne's earliest efforts.  I laughed so hard I almost wet myself.  Director Ed Hunt is Ed Wood reincarnated.",952732800,,259,4.976744186046512
7856117,1,6303916201,"Having worked on the movie as a production assistant in 1984, I can safely say this is a film in the spirit of Ed Wood. My chief memory is working late at night on skid row in downtown LA wondering if the security guard  would really come to our aid if something happened (and also wondering  about what, exactly, the producer of this film was using to keep him so  hyped up late into the night).
I saw if recently on television and was  amazed that it was worse than I thought it would be. So, break out some  popcorn and invite the friends over for this none to subtle reworking of  Starman meets Hercules (well, the guy kinda looks like he should be in one  of those bad Italian movies from the 50's and early 60's).",926985600,3,719,4.204379562043796
