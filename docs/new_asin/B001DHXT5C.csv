3530429,5,B001DHXT5C,"CBS/Paramount is the best company when it comes to releasing TV shows on DVD! Beverly Hills 90210 will have only 4 seasons left to release after this Thanksgiving. I have never seen much of Season 6, but it will great once it is released on DVD. I have the first 5 seasons in my collection, and I am looking forward for the rest of the series. CBS/Paramount is doing a good job with Beverly Hills 90210. I hope the 4 remaining seasons are planned for release soon. Please CBS/Paramount, keep those Beverly Hills coming, and release Seasons 7, 8, 9, and 10, in the near future!!",1217635200,4,577,4.452830188679245

3530431,5,B001DHXT5C,My favorite part mostly is the story line involving colin and kelly and also val. But after that ends we get some good other story lines like dylan falling in love and getting married or her also dying shortly there after. Also there's more drama between val and david and signs of David and donna true love for each other like always.,1486166400,,335,4.419354838709677

3530518,4,B001DHXT5C,"Well...well...the more things change, the more they stay the same. It has finally begun: Beverly Hills 90210 is losing steam in a big way. I thought the first half of season six was good and decent, but man, the second half was quite boring for me. Ray overstayed his welcome as he became annoying to watch. Then, add Colin to the mix. His act had been extremely thin, and he should've disappeared twenty episodes earlier. To make matters worse, Joe Bradley became this boring flake around Donna, and I knew it: time to say ditto to him. Man, I never liked Susan in the first place, she acting all kooky and awkward on purpose. It was like watching a clone of Andrea but worse. Brandon shouldn't have gone out with Susan at all due to her fake elitism and sexism. Finally, to top it all off, Tara...whoa, that's a one serious basket case, and I even saw that coming from miles away. One piece of advice: never befriend anyone coming out of a substance abuse treatment center, especially if you are from Beverly Hills. It just doesn't work. Meanwhile, I thought the rekindled lost romance between Nat and Joan was a bit awkward to watch, especially for younger generations. It was just nauseating to watch; I mean, Jim and Cindy's is enough for once, but please no more than that for a series that's meant to be seen by teenagers. Anyway, let's evaluate the old characters as usual as well as some of the mainstay newcomers.
Brandon: still at his old hypocrite self although he has mellowed out, and I've always gotten used to him, likeable or not. I loved the moment when his gambling problem had gotten out of hand. I was like, ""Yep, that's the old Brandon I know."" I thought his decision to date Susan was the biggest mistake in a while, and even bigger mistake was turning down that Boston Globe internship. Such, such a bad idea...never ever do that for a girl, ever. Emma Caulfield, playing as Susan, thankfully never returned again, and honestly, I just never liked her at all.
Kelly: Poor Kelly Taylor, arguably the most likeable character of the show next to Steve Sanders, she went through a lot in season six. It's too bad that she got a raw deal many times. I really wished she dumped Colin after finding out that he did an older woman while dating Kelly. Ewww, gross. Blah, moving on....problem with Kelly, she needs some therapy to get her priorities straight especially after what happened with that New Evolution cult thing. It's something missing in her life, but she'll be a stronger woman after some insightful guidance.
Donna: Same sweet girl, hardly a complaint about her. Yet still boring as ever.
David: It's really impossible for me to say a lot about him, even after six seasons. He is just a boring dude.
Steve: Easily the most likeable character of the show, still going strong, same old Steve. Nothing new. He certainly finds new ways to liven things up. The part showing that he has 2 brothers is probably the most farfetched of Season Six because if he had brothers, especially to babysit, it would have been made known way, way back in the beginning.
Dylan: Poor kid, the pseudo-intellectual managed to make Season Six interesting as usual. Good ole Dylan, I knew that I could count on him. That was a pretty girl in Toni Marchette. To tell you the truth, I kinda miss him after he disappeared for most of the season, and he won't be back until Season Nine. I am looking forward to his return from hiatus.
Cindy: It was nice to see her again one more time, but sadly, it felt weird.
Andrea: Hi...bye. Entirely forgettable.
Clare: Eh, I am sort of used to her, but I don't like her all that much. She was too snotty for me. One more season left of her, and she will be finally gone.
Valerie: As beautiful as she is, she was really hard to like. I knew everything was all planned out beforehand to make sure Valerie gets what she wants. She was clearly responsible for Kelly's addiction to cocaine. You know that saying: ""Leave a candy bar in a room. Sooner or later, it's bound to be eaten."" And Valerie's soft spot for men such as Dylan and Colin, leaving her very vulnerable, was quite annoying to stand. To make matters worse, her two-year cold war with Kelly had grown greatly tiresome for me to watch. Time to end it and move on.
Nat: Finally, Joe Tata got his name on the opening credits, way long overdue, but it's unfair that Jamie Walters got his so quickly at same time as Joe. Interestingly, Jamie and Luke Perry's were unceremoniously dropped from the opening credits after their sudden departures, and the opening video was re-edited to make sure none of it included them.
Overall, the acting of the cast was quite good and stood the test of time. Of course, I am used to the characters, but I wished the others, the annoying ones, weren't so recurring. I've more or less enjoyed the episodes, but many of the topics were getting rehashed from past episodes. For example, David had a drug problem, and then Dylan had his problem. For some reason, Kelly became the third regular to have an old merry-go-around. That's getting a bit old, especially in how they've all managed to recover and bounce back to their old selves rather quickly. Right now, I am not all that looking forward to Season Seven because I am getting bored and tired of the series. However, I will keep watching and hoping for better stories and better characters.",1304812800,2,5374,4.569948186528498

3530538,5,B001DHXT5C,"Season 6 of Beverly Hills 90210 is another enjoyable season of the show.

Although the ratings dipped a fair bit this year, many fans like me stood by it and continued to tune in....

The reason some people abandoned the show this year really was the shift of the show towards more soapy relationship based storylines as opposed to the past issue driven stories.

If season 5 hinted that change was coming with Brenda out and Val in, season 6 truly delivered many changes...

Andrea and Jessy were no more (their season 5 storyline of marital probs was dragged out long enough and really their was nowhere else to bring them),

Cindy and Jim have left too... this allows Brandon in particluar to grow more... he's no longer checking with mom and dad about what to do when presented with a tricky situation. And with the gang hanging out more at the walsh house, there is a sense that the characters are really growing up.

Dylan departs after episode 10, I for one was glad, the whole ""who killed my dad"" saga had gotten way to tedious, as was his on-off relationship with Kelly.. I knew when he returned in season 9, he wouldn't save the show from being axed... his character was exhausted by the end of season 4 if you ask me.

Highlights of season 6 for me:

Colin was an interesting addition and his leading Kelly astray, the writers did a good job on rounding out the character of Val more and showing softer, more vulnerable sides at times as well as continuing to rile Kelly with her bitchy antics too.

It was good to see Brandon move on, susan was a great addition, her feisty/ feministic attitude made her fun to watch,

Steve and Claire pairing up was a smart move, they really worked well as a couple.

Donna dumping ray after the whole domestic abuse storyline was good to see, it seemed pointless to add Jamie Walters to the regular cast though when they were only writing him out.

In the end, season 6 is another good season of the show, the quality of the show remains consistent if you ask me despite the changes in cast, producers and general tone of the show.  Looking forward to season 7, probably the last strong season of the show before the writers started to run out of ideas for the last seasons.",1231027200,,2222,4.45679012345679
3530539,5,B001DHXT5C,"Yes, some of the music that has been replaced with unknown tracks are horrible. But I thought the Dylan and Toni track was very nice. Does anyone know where I can get that song?

3530540,4,B001DHXT5C,"I bought this on Tuesday and am now in the middle of enjoying a Thankgiving weekend marathon. It's great seeing these episodes after so many years. The music replacement seems hardly noticable to me. Any place where the music absolutley must be included (like when a band appears) it's been kept.
The characters and storylines are what orginally drew me to this show and and that's what I continue to enjoy about it. The music playing in the background isn't essential to the stories or characters. I'm just glad to see the show getting steadily released and look forward to hopefully owning the whole series eventually. As far as the season itself the first ten episodes alone (the Dylan-Marchette story) make this set worth the buy. Then there's barely time to catch your breath as Kelly Taylor gets put through the wringer. The show also benefits immensly from last season's addition on Tiffani Thiesen as Valerie Malone. While Valerie continues to scheme we also see there's more to her this season. She really comes into her own this season and moves beyond the shadow of being Shannon Doherty/Brenda's replacement.
Long story short if you were a fan of the show during it's original run you'll want to add this to your collection.",1227830400,,1236,4.834905660377358

The first thing I have to point out is what a complete frigid biatch Kelly has turned into this season! Well, she always was, but even moreso here. And they always said Brenda was. Please, right off the bat in the second episode Kelly makes some snide remark about Ginger without knowing her all of 10 seconds. Not to mention her little confrontation with Valerie in the same episode where, OUT OF NOWHERE, she tells Val that she ""hasn't changed"" and the ""the gloves are off."" WTF? But I guess she was glad, now that Brenda was gone, Kelly could be the star, right?

The special features for the first four seasons were great, but there weren't ANY on season 5 and I don't think there is on 6.

3530544,3,B001DHXT5C,"Losing Brenda (Sexy Shannen Doherty) at the end of Season 4 was bad enough, but not trivial, after all, Tiffany Amber Theissen was just as nice to look at, then Andrea (Gabrielle Carteris) & Jim & Cindy Walsh (James Eckhouse/Carol Potter) left at the end of Season 5, now with this Season 6, Dylan (Luke Perry) departs, really liked this one because it spoke to my generation, (same age as Doherty & Preistley is one year older than me) as today's teen shows speak to today's teens, In this season Dylan finds the man responsible for his father's death & begins dating his daughter (Rebecca Gayheart) to get close to him, & in the process begins to fall for her as she does for him, thus complicating things, Steve & Brandon turn Brandon's parent's house into party central, while Kelly deals with a drug addiction, & Donna tries to rid herself of the very controlling Ray, while Valerie keeps manipulating everyone to her advantage, but the real highlight is Dylan's obsession with bringing down his father's killer, which has disasterous consequences for all involved as his father's killer makes a fatal error in judgement against Dylan, won't spoil it here, but this show seemed to lose its magic after Perry's departure, but I say get this one, just to see justice done Dylan McKay style, afterwards, the show is basically everyone dealing with relationships, Jason Preistly & Emma Caulfield(Susan) had great chemistry, this was a good pairing no doubt & Valarie (Theissan) & David(Brian Austin Green) have good chemistry as well who at the time was a real-life couple, all in all a good season, but the old favorites are missed!",1221868800,2,1634,4.818505338078292
3530545,5,B001DHXT5C,"Beverly Hills, 90210 - The Sixth Season went through a lot of changes. Luke Perry who plays sexy but brooding Dylan McKay left the show halfway through the season, he would return to the show in seasons 9 and 10. Brandon and Kelly's relationship is offically over, he begins to date Susan, a journalism major and she has a stormy romance with Colin, who is a painter and drug addict. Kelly gets hooked on cocaine and goes to rehab and befriends a troubled girl named Tara who becomes obsessed with Kelly. Donna starts dating Joe, a football player with a heart condition. Claire and Steve continue to date, they are hilarious! Valerie dates David and Colin and so much more drama ensues with the return of Val's frenemie, Ginger. Great season, I highly recommend it! Enjoy.",1220572800,,773,4.6911764705882355
3530546,5,B001DHXT5C,"im very excited for the sixth season that was my favorite . I love tiffany on the show she should come on for the spin off. i love jenny shes great. and most of all I love tori she rocks as donna, brenda and dylan are my favorite couple and ilove branden and kelly. and donna and david are so cute together. steve and his wife are the cutest.",1220313600,,342,3.971014492753623
3530547,5,B001DHXT5C,"Although I remain a huge fan of the high school years, I think there's something to be said about the entertainment value of Kelly Taylor snorting coke through Bill Taylor's check.  Watching her downward spiral through season six makes up for any of the weaker plot lines.  My favorite part is when Colin screams at Kelly, ""You went through a gram?!""  God, this is the best show ever.

Other highlights of this season include the pairing of Val and David. Donna finally ditches ""cheater and beater"" Ray ""one T was all my momma could afford"" Pruit, for the much more intelligent, CU quarterback, Joe Bradley.  One of the more painful scenes in the season involves Joe purchasing a bird for Donna which was trained to repeat ""Joe loves Donna.""  This was, of course, not successful.  If you manage to watch it without gouging out your eyes, you will be rewarded with Kelly's bout with coke.

Nat gets a shot at romance here.  It's slightly awkward, yes, but whatever.  Brandon dates Susan Keats, editor of the campus paper.  I like them together.  They also get stuck on a mountain top at one point.  Donna gets to ride on a float on the Rose Parade, which is totally exciting.  Dylan gets hitched, his wife dies, and he leaves the show.  He miss him.

Did I mention that Kelly becomes a coke addict and almost gets killed by her psychopathic roommate whom she met in rehab?",1219449600,15,1371,4.580246913580247
3530548,4,B001DHXT5C,"Who would think that Kelly Taylor would become an addict? On this very intense season, we're introduced to Colin , who brings coke to her life. Also we have that annoying Susan, who dates Brandon and ultimately breaks his heart and Dylan getting married to Toni (while furious and revengeful on Marchette), and later leaving the famous zip code (but not for good, he returns some seasons later). We have that hateful Kelly-stalker Tara, the charming prince Carl (who hits on Clare), special appearances of Cindy Walsh and Andrea Zuckerman, a very sutle reference to Brenda on Scotland (at the end of the season), Ray Pruitt hurting Donna, Valerie's hateful and blackmailing friend, Ginger, David's mom trying to kill herself, and we almost lose Casa Walsh for good! (the show wouldn't be the same without that house!!)

This season is extraordinary; the whole series is superb. But the DVDs...I know, I know, everybody already complained about the music changes and the missing scenes (the ones with pop references, especially) But it's a shame that fans worldwide (and I'm writing this from Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, where the show was called ""Barrados no Baile"" and was also a huge phenomenon) can't have on their shelves the complete and uncut seasons of such a great show. The same thing happened to ""Fastlane"", Will & Grace"" and (in a small way) to ""Charmed"", among others. Some fans expected that the ""complete series pack"" of ""Fastlane"" or ""Will & Grace"" (to be released soon) would present the uncut episodes with ALL the original music; and I know that some fans also expect the same thing when all ten seasons of Beverly Hills 90210 are finally released, but I think it is most unlikely something like this will happen, that the studio will fix something on this matter.

Anyway, we, fans, HAVE to buy the seasons just this way, and we have to be happy and thankful that, at least, the Beverly Hills 90210 gang is on DVD.....What can we do NOW about it? In fact, what could we do in the first place?
