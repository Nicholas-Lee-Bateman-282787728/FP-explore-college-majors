8367434,4,B002EB6MAK,"This is a good classic series that I first saw on Toonami years back, probably like most.  Its kind of a supernatural crime series.  I do like it but it seems like they could have done more with it,  but that would have required going in either a direction of more fantasy or more adult type content ala Hellsing or Trinity Blood.  To keep this series in the realm of a realistic crime series albeit with supernatural elements they walked more of a CSI with witchcraft path which is still enjoyable.  I like the little musical jingle that is part of the soundtrack. They should make an anime which focuses on Witchcraft in a more traditional Malleus Malificarum way like the movies Witchhunter General or Mark of the Devil, with powerful spell casting witches (either misunderstood or not). versus the hunters or clergy.",1519257600,,820,4.706293706293707
