5841567,5,B00DPJEW4I,"When watching Francois Ozon's `In the House', I was repeatedly reminded of Atom Egoyan's `Adoration'.  Both films tackle the idea of obsession and fabrication as unified entities and interwoven truths, and both carry and heaviness about them that seems rooted in something concealed.

But then, with regards to `In the House', things start to shift, tonally.

This is where `In the House' rises above being yet another `clever film' and becomes something more, something substantial.  It's not merely clever, it's remarkably astute and says so much for those very subjects thanks to an almost witty and playful shift in nature.  Ozon's directorial achievement here is easily overlooked, but he handles the film's core with such organic grace.  He allows the film's finale to coat over the audience, pandering to us without giving in to obvious manipulations.  The homage to films like `Rear Window' (this is vastly superior, but I know I'm in the minority when it comes to that film) makes for something truly rewarding, and that final shot is especially effective `because' of the buildup created by Ozon.  Yes, as the film descends into the depths of Ozon's painted portrayal of roving eyes and wandering minds, the audience is taken for a ride they won't soon forget.

And thanks to that finale, they'll continue to recall and dissect.

`In the House' tells of a partnership of sorts that forms between a precocious young student and his English teacher.  Claude is deeply affected by his family life and the perceived perfection of a middle class family he attempts to draw close to.  Latching onto his classmate, Rapha, Claude finds a way to weasel his way into their lives and begins to write about it for his class project.  His teacher, Germain, is at first almost repulsed by the distain and judgmental attitude with which Claude writes about this family, but he is also instantly intrigued and soon begins to encourage and even aid Claude in his infiltration of his family's life.  Claude becomes like a son to Rapha Senior and becomes an object of desire and escape for Rapha's mother, Esther.  But more than that, Claude becomes a form of voyeuristic escape for Germain, who lives through Claude's words, dissecting their worth and prodding Claude to `create his own truth' by altering his story with creative liberties, obviously convincing Claude to take those liberties within his own reality.

The conclusion is deeply profound, and distinctly creative.

The way that Ozon weaves his screenplay to tackle such deeply rooted subjects of family life, childhood adolescence, the loss of innocence and even sexual boundaries (the brief glimpses of homosexuality and the sexual friction between father and son are brilliant flickers of thought) is outstanding and really shows a depth of identity that transcends the film's seeming gimmick of manipulated storylines.

Ozon plays with his actors like pawns, and they all (for the most part) fit into their mold perfectly.  Fabrice Luchini is outstanding as the film's morally corrupted center.  He portrays the fibers of Germain's intrigue to perfection, especially as the film spirals to a close.  Ernst Umhauer (who looks a tad like Ezra Miller) plays to the camera too much in the end (he tries too hard to get into the spirit of the tonal shifts), but for the most part he plays off of Luchini rather well.  Both Seigner and Scott Thomas are marvelous here.  Seigner has a quite storm within her, but her character's final arc is almost too subtle.  Scott Thomas, on the other hand, builds to such a tremendous break here that I was completely blown over by her progression of character.

For me though, the star here is Denis Menochet.  It doesn't hurt that he is incredibly handsome and hard not to look at, but he is the best fit for the continually shifting tonal avenues in the film.  He understands the layer of caricature that is needed to sell Claude's story, and when he does have his bit scenes (his angry confrontation with Luchini and his tearful confession to Seigner), he blows everyone else out of the water.

For me, `In the House' was a real surprise.  I wasn't sure what I was getting into when I turned it on, and for the film's first two thirds it felt almost too heavy or unsure of its footing and yet it all came together remarkably well in the final act, where Ozon ties up every loose end and identifies the honesty within the core relationship in the film, making everything make sense in a way that lingers in the audience's mind.",1384214400,14,4520,4.871895424836601
5841568,3,B00DPJEW4I,"A mildly intriguing and entertaining French import that blurs the boundary between fantasy and reality. It depicts the lives of very likable and intelligent characters as they begin to interact with an adolescent school boy possessing a distinctive ""Bad Seed"" vibe. Literary allusions abound. Although the concept does seem imaginative, the viewing experience itself begins to get a bit tiresome-- perhaps by by going on a bit longer than necessary. All-in-all, a reasonably pleasant and amusing film. Comes with English subtitles.",1383350400,,531,5.567901234567901
5841569,5,B00DPJEW4I,"The plot takes place in 21st century France and concerns a student with a penchant for writing. His choice of topic is the plot for this foreign film.  I found it sort of a mixture of the 1957 film ""Payton Place"" and a soap opera like ""As the Stomach Churns"" that my late mother was so fond of watching.  But what really makes this movie a truly great one, is its complicated and extremely unpredictable plot.  Sixteen year-old Claude is manipulative, clever, sophisticated, sly, and somewhat of a Don Juan with older women.  His manipulation of his teacher, his teacher's wife, his best friend's parents, his best friend's mother in particular, and his social-climbing tactics are astonishing.  Most teenage boys want to score, but this one goes where no other teen has gone before.  Although the ending is unpredictable it is a perfect conclusion that leaves the audience with a sense of continuance as Claude and his teacher come face to face in a park. The one drawback of this film is, unless your French is very good, the English subtitles flash by in an attempt to keep pace with the fast-moving conversations of the actors.  As a former High School English teacher, I found this film a lesson in the complexities of the adolescent mind that even I had never encountered during my career.  If foreign language films are not your thing, this film will not appeal to you.  But for those who enjoy the foreign film genre, this one is a must see.",1381104000,4,1449,4.650980392156863
5841570,3,B00DPJEW4I,"I am a big fan of Francois Ozon's Under the Sand and The Swimming Pool (another film about a writer who blurs the line between reality and fiction) but this one doesn't measure up to the standard set by those two earlier works. In the House is much lighter and less intriguing and ultimately leaves you with very little to ponder. The film examines an unusual bond between a somewhat imaginative writing student and a teacher but Ozon broadcasts a little too loudly that the student's only real talent is listening to what adults say and then saying back to them what he thinks they want to hear, so not much in the way of suspense and not much mystery either. The only real interest is in trying to figure what is motivating student and teacher. The solution to neither mystery is particularly compelling (although, to be fair, it is somewhat surprising that they both seem to be attracted to literature for the same reason). As I watched I just couldn't stop thinking about how much better this film could have been.",1380672000,4,1018,4.5989010989010985
5841571,5,B00DPJEW4I,"This is quite simply a delightful and engrossing French film. It tells the story of Claude Garcia (Ernst Umhauer), he is a student at Lycee Gustave Flaubert and a bit of a loner. He specialises in maths, but has written an essay for his cynical and dismissive literature teacher, Professor Germain (Fabrice Lucini `The Women on the Sixth Floor'). In it he tells how he had become obsessed with entering a school mate's house, just to be with a `normal' middle class family. His mother having left and him having to care for a father he clearly has little in common with has left him on the periphery of life where he seems to be more of a spectator than a participant.

His essay details how he managed to inveigle his way into the home and what his thoughts and feelings were. He ends his essay with `to be continued'; it is the best piece of creative writing Germain has seen in a long while and he encourages his young charge to continue. This he does with increasing flair and increasing artifice.

 What started out as well written reportage quickly becomes a blur of fact and fiction. The resulting release of emotions for all involved soon leads to circumstances spiralling out of control. Kristen Scott-Thomas plays Madame Germain, she runs a modern art gallery that has some truly uninspiring and ludicrous exhibits check out the `penile swastika' to give you a taste. Her job is juxtaposed to her husbands and the increasing obsession he has with the `story' compared with her struggling in the reality of her life.

This is just a sublime film, director Franois Ozon has made a film that is perfectly balanced, billed as a thriller, mystery, it is also a bit of a comedy and a study in obsession and the inter relationships that can happen just by chance in ones life. Every single player puts in great performances and the direction and attention to detail is outstanding. This was released as `Dans la maison' and it is in French with very good sub titles and runs for 106 minutes, but it seemed a lot less. Just brilliant for all Francophiles and lovers of European, stylish cinema.",1374796800,15,2096,4.6415094339622645
5841572,4,B00DPJEW4I,"""Dans La Maison"" (2012 release from France; 108 min.; US title ""In The House"") brings several parallel stories: first we meet 16 yr. old Claude, a high school student at the Lycee Flaubert who, in a class assignment on ""what was my weekend like"", turns in a long story about how he finally was able to get invited by one of his classmates to spend time in their house, which (for reasons not fully explained) Claude had been dreaming about for a long time. Claude's teacher grades the writing assignment a B+ and encourages Claude to keep writing more. The teacher also shares this with his wife, who we later learn runs an art gallery that may be shut down at any time. She too is fascinated by the writings of Claude. A good part of the movie consists of reading/seeing Claude's latest updates on what is going on ""in the house"", and how it affect/may affect the teacher and his wife, as well as the family of Claude's classmate. To tell you more of the plot would ruin your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Several comments: this movie is being billed (in US media anyway) as a ""suspense/thriller"" and while there is a certain element of mystery in the movie, this is NOT a suspense/thriller, even when at a certain point in the movie we do not know anymore whether the writings of Claude are a true reflection of past events, or whether they are a version of events as Claude had hoped they would go. This is a talk-movie and leans towards being a comedy, if anything. Writer-director Franois Ozon does a great job with the pacing of the movie, introducing new elements at the right time to keep us interested in the movie from start to finish. Ernst Umhauer is an up-and-coming talent and just great in the role of Claude, a slightly creepy character (check out the closing scenes of the movie!), but Fabrice Luchini as the teacher and Kirsten Scott Thomas as his wife are equally memorable.

The screening where I saw this at (the E Street Landmark Theatre in Washington DC) this past weekend was absolutely packed, and the movie even got an applause from the audience as the closing credit started to roll. This is will you a good indication of the entertainment value of this movie. If you are in the mood for a top notch quality foreign movie that is miles away from your standard Hollywood fare, you cannot go wrong with this. ""In The House"" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",1368403200,5,2421,4.537757437070939
5841573,4,B00DPJEW4I,"Much food for thought in this darkish comedy. A teacher is intrigued by the essay of a student who insinuates his way into the life of a classmate from a middle-income family, whose cohesion he admires, and then destroys---unintentionally, or is it quite that innocent? The subversive side of literature and its creation is the underlying theme, but there's also a comedic subplot parodying contemporary art and its pretensions.

Wonderfully acted---Kristin Scott Thomas, Emmanuelle Seigner, Fabrice Luchini are superb---and well-paced---there's more here than a casual evening of entertainment.",1474675200,2,595,5.761363636363637

5841579,5,B00DPJEW4I,"This film's model is reminiscent of the 1921 play by Pirandello, ""Six Characters In Search of an Author,"" but it's brilliant nonetheless, and wonderfully imaginative and original. A jaded and burned out professor of creative writing, Germain ( Fabrice Luchini), at a boys high school, perks up at the talented writing of one student, Claude Garcia (Ernst Umhauer).  Claude's personal history is that of a lonely boy, abandoned by his mother, and assigned the role of caretaker for his disabled father.  He longs to be in a ""normal"" family and manipulates his environment and the people in it to place himself in those settings, caring little, we will learn, about the deleterious effects of his behavior. Claude has inveigled his way into the home of a classmate and tells their personal story compellingly and realistically, at first, albeit with a sardonic twist. He presents these written installments to his teacher. Germain and his art gallery director wife Jeanne  (Kristin Scott Thomas) are captivated and excitedly anticipate each chapter as it is delivered following the actual events. So Claude is, in effect, simultaneously writing this movie, which of course then has to be a movie within a movie.  Finally, the watchers and the watched weave in and out of each other's stories,  completely bewitching this viewer.  The acting is superior, as is the directing by Francois Ozon.  Don't miss this one.",1465171200,3,1411,5.108695652173913

5841583,4,B00DPJEW4I,"Saw it in a theater. A talented and manipulative 16 year old highschool student draws his literature teacher into a dark plot under the pretense of developing his impressive but acerbic writing skills. The scheme consists of insinuating himself into a ""normal"" middle class family and slowly supplanting himself as a preferred child at the expense of his school buddy,and his mom's (Emmanuelle Seigner still looking pretty good, remember Bitter Moon?) lover at the expense of his buddy's father. While all the action is described in the student's weekly compositions, the teacher and his wife live vicariously through his escapades. For the teacher, the students possible future career compensates for his own failure as a writer. On the whole, well written, well directed, well acted. Francois Ozon does a very good job, as usual. The movie could have been much better had Ozon decided between a straight comedy or a dramatic morality play. The movie oscillates between the two options, losing on both counts. My impression, I could not get enough emotional response. It was all very elegant, highly amusing, and too intellectualized. In a word, very French (both on the plus and the minus side). Hence, only four stars.",1454976000,,1221,5.11

5841587,5,B00DPJEW4I,"This is my third film of  Franois Ozon and it is another fascinating work from him, as we see him toying with life and fiction, switching in and out of both repeatedly while narrating the tale of a young fiction writer, who is encouraged by his school teacher. I found it a sophisticated film, which is at the same time comic as well as psychological in its exploration of creative writing.

The story centers around a school teacher, Germain and his student Claude. Germain asks his class to write a short essay on 'What did I do last week?'. The students submit their tepid and boring offerings and Germain, as he goes through them, is tired of the lack of creativity and imagination in their work until he comes across a piece by one of his students, namely Claude. The essay by Claude is focused on one of his classmates, Rapha, and what Claude sees as Rapha's 'perfect family', in contrast to his own broken one. Claude writes about Rapha Sr and the mother Esther, who is described as one with the 'stimulating scent of a middle-class woman'. Germain is impressed by both the adoring and satirical tone in the essay and encourages Claude to continue to observe and engage more deeply with Rapha's family and write further without judgement. Gradually, we see both teacher and student getting seduced by the enterprise and the lines between real life and fiction constantly getting blurred and breached. Germain's wife, Jeanne, also participates in reading and discussing each offering and puts in her view of the story line, its characters and also of Claude and his fixation towards Rapha's mother. She even suspects that Germain may actually be in love with his favorite student. As the story unfolds and unravels, we see not only funny episodes but also intrinsically tragic ones as well, because it brings to focus the failure of Germain both as a creative writer and husband. The movie ends with a fascinating scene of Claude and Germain sitting in a park in darkness and observing a row of apartment balconies at a distance, where its inhabitants are engaged in animated conversations and everyday life. Teacher and student start discussing feverishly as to what those people are about, what they are up to, what their relationship to one another is and so on, even as night falls.

It is a stylish production and I loved the performance of both Fabrice Luchini as Germain and that of the young and handsome Ernest Umhauer as Claude. Kristin Scott Thomas also has a significant role as Germain's wife, Jeanne, as the lady-in-charge of Minotaur's Maze, an upcoming upmarket art gallery. I particularly liked the teasing switch between real life and fiction in the film, often challenging us with its ambiguity of whether the events are happening really in Rapha's house or just in the imagination of Claude. In some respects, it reminded me of the director's other film 'Swimming Pool', which also tantalizes us as to whether the events really happened at all or whether they occurred only in imagination. I look forward to catching up with his other films as well in future.",1447027200,,3085,4.816981132075472

5841593,3,B00DPJEW4I,"I had looked forward to seeing this French film and for the first half, it was intriguing. The cast was well chosen the acting was spot on. Essentially it was about a boy, Claude, with a rough home life who wanted to sample a classmate's in-tact middle class family. He befriends this classmate and basically spies on this unsuspecting family and writes essays about them for a literature class assignment. His writing talent gets the attention of his professor who encourages Claude even though it violates decency and privacy. Claude uses his clueless friend and becomes obsessed with the attractive mother who at first suspects something is off with her son's new friend. Claude works on her doubts via her helping her son with math and further ingratiates himself into the family.

The film then becomes repetitive and starts to meander into being silly if not creepy. Not captivating creepy but weird creepy and the plot no longer seems believable. The ending is a disappointment with some gratuitous sex thrown in to keep the audience's attention -always a bad sign. It is fathomable that the Esther character would have been an easy target for Claude but not the Scott-Thomas character who is too smart to have fallen for this manipulative kid and his weird hang ups.

5841602,4,B00DPJEW4I,"Based on a play by Spanish writer Juan Mayorga, Franois Ozons latest work In the House (Dans la maison) follows the unusual story of Germain (Fabrice Luchini), a tired and disillusioned French teacher at Gustave Flaubert High School). One day he discovers a 16-year-old student with talent for writing in his class; he is Claude Garcia (Ernst Umhauer), who has done his homework by vividly describing what he experienced in his friend Raphas house.

Germain decides to take Claude under his wing and starts teaching about writing, but Claudes writing gets more and more real  and alarmingly so, with descriptions about Raphas mom Esther (Emmanuelle Seigner), to whom, it seems, Claude is attracted. While Germains private lesson develops into battle of wits, Germains wife Jeanne (Kristin Scott Thomas) gets interested in Claudes story.

Like in some of Ozons works, the world he describes is unique in blurring the line between fiction and reality. Claude as an imaginative and creative writer slowly takes the lead in telling the story, which could be fiction after all. Everything is done smoothly and stylishly, while players effectively become seemingly impossible characters.

For all these merits, however, I couldn't help feeling, well, in short, so what? The stagy film intrigues us with its unique set-up, but what follows is not really surprising. In the House has a well-told story, but the story, intelligent and interesting as it is feels very distant.",1384905600,,1466,5.1991525423728815

The logic, the main idea, character's motives and actions are just disturbing, no ""deep meaning"" attached.",1485734400,,253,5.631578947368421

The intricately structured script, the subtle humor, Francois Ozon's overall direction of this masterpiece, or the extraordinary acting--by Fabrice Luchini as the High school teacher and Ernst Umhauer in a satanic performance as his pupil? This film is a unique and precious creation, one that Hollywood could never emulate.",1475712000,,352,5.418181818181818
