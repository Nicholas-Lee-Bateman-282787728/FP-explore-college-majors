7976189,5,B00007G1ZQ,My kids love these movies and I enjoy them because they have Bible verses that the kids recite. It's easy for them to understand the concepts and morals/values from the Bible.,1377388800,,175,4.67741935483871

7976192,4,B00007G1ZQ,"It seems when they came out we were one of the few people buying ... but maybe you have seen them now on Qubo?
This one is pretty silly and the message is pretty clear about pride. Its much more mainstream than its VeggieTales cousins and also probably geared toward elementary rather than preschool kids.",1247788800,,305,4.5636363636363635
7976193,5,B00007G1ZQ,"Our children have watched this DVD a few times and quote lines from it, scripture, and in a short time have applied the lessons learned - priceless.  If they begin having an issue related to the teaching in the DVD, one of them will remind the other about what the story said and they will discuss what to do - mind you, these are two little boys under the age of seven!!!  They also point out pride in situations they see, others, and us (their parents).

All of the 3-2-1 videos are fantastic.  This one is obviously about pride and how it can get us into trouble.  Details regarding the story are in the Amazon review.

All I can say is I wish they were making as many of these as they have VeggieTales",1240704000,,705,4.223880597014926
