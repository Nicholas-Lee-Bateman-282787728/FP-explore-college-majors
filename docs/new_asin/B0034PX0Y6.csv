8388514,5,B0034PX0Y6,"I chose this movie because I love the 60's Mexican movies.  They don't make them like they use to.  Now it's a Spanish soap opera remake (telenovela). The modern version telenovela is more detailed, yet the movie generates flashbacks of my youth.",1363651200,2,246,4.833333333333333
