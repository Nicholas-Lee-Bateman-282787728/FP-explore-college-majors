8548095,5,B00A8255VO,excellent quality. It was great to finally see some negima in HD. the cover art on the front of the box is a bit bland; the back of the box is better though. no subtitles or english dub obviously so keep that in mind. the blu rays are region free which is a huge plus.,1475193600,,268,3.890909090909091
