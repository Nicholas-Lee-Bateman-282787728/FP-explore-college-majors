5578990,5,B00BCP83HY,"The Day of Discovery episodes hosted by Joe Stowell provide an enlightening perspective on what challenges early church members faced when making a choice to follow Jesus. Joe takes us to Turkey and the modern day cities which are home to the ruins of Ephesus, Smyrna, Pergamos, Thyatira, Sardis, Philadelphia, and Laodicea.  The fascinating review of the culture, as it was in the time of the early church, helps to put in context the message each of the seven letters conveyed.  You'll come away having a broader world view and a realization that the challenges faced by early church members aren't so different than those we face today.",1384387200,4,639,4.907407407407407

8566305,5,B00BCP83HY,"The conversations that take place on site of each 'ruin' or excavation are very thoughtful and spiritual - the result is that the viewer gets seven different homilies on the meaning of particular aspects of each city.  Interspersed also are historical and social aspects of the time zone of the early church and the viewer can use that background, along with the spiritual insight offered, to get an experience from a distance of the nature of these early Christian cities.",1509062400,,473,4.9125
