1640809,5,B00005OCKK,"Let's face it - some of like to read travel guidebooks and make detailed lists of itineraries, places to visit, etc. Others of us yawn at the thought of wading through all that print... but do better when we can actually see, with plenty of action and dialogue, the actual PLACES that we might be visiting.

 For those who like to get a feel for the country they are about to visit, these DVDs do the trick. We were awed by the film quality and even the humorous asides that Rick Steves provided about unique experiences he'd had.

  Be aware that Steves has strong opinions about how one best experiences a new country. He does provide basic info for the new or inexperienced traveler while also encouraging visitors to stray from the beaten paths and experience cities away from the usual ""touristy"" spots. In short, he suggests a mixture of planning and spontaneity, something that is sure to guarantee some unexpected surprises that could be the highlight of the trip.

  Each DVD is a delight and I was actually dissappointed when each ended, feeling as though my appetite was just getting whetting for a particular city. Looking at the DVD on Barcelona, for instance, only made me want to see more of the artist Gaudi's works and I was awestruck by churches which were still in construction after hundreds of years - such painstaking work! Seeing these images on the screen was so much more intense an experience than readng about them in a guidebook.

  We gave a set of these DVDs to a college student who was taking his first trip overseas and he was able to hit the ground running, knowing where to go to get the basic info he needed. From watching the DVDs, he also had a strong sense of WHAT he wanted to see and how best to travel, where to eat and how to avoid some of the pitfalls that one learns only AFTER becoming an experienced traveler. Well worth the price, especially since the savvy viewer should save time and money while having a wonderful time!",1111017600,30,1970,4.552407932011332
1640810,5,B00005OCKK,"Great ivestment for the money! Ten dollars for 21 hours of travel information!! Can't be beat!!

Sharp dvd quality video (definately not VHS) and a wealth of information for the money.  Ricks' historical perspective of these destinations with his hands on practical advice make this a great investment for all future Europe-bound travelers. In all honesty, I really can't say enough great things about this dvd set.

The video footage of all these destinations is fantastic as well. Not only focusing on the big tourist destinations, but covering the small country settings off the beaten path make this a wonderful bargain at this price!

Will be added to the family video library!",1108684800,21,682,5.0625

The whole DVD is over 3 hours long but no time is wasted on irrelevant stuff. The photography is excellent. You can tell the author really respects the places visited. This DVD is great as reference material for old world Italian architecture. Panning views of buildings and streets are often shown.",1093824000,17,417,4.805555555555555

1640815,3,B00005OCKK,"I purchased this DVD in conjunction with purchasing Rick Steves' ""Great Britian 2002"" book in preparation of a trip to London with a weekend getaway to Bath and the Cotswolds.  I found the DVD to be somewhat of a resource, but not as much as the book.
As the other reviewer mentioned, the two main flaws of this DVD is that it spends way too little time on London itself (I ended up spending eight days in London and *still* didn't see everything), while wasting time on other things such as how to take photos without a tripod or flash.
What this really seems to be is a combination of three of his PBS shows, one that touches on London and Scotland, one that continues in Scotland and covers Ireland, and another that goes over Wales and the English countryside.  There are DVD ""bonus materials"" of Blackpool (kind of useless), Stratford-upon-Avon, and Blenheim Palace (just north of Oxford).  To get what I needed out of the DVD, I found myself skipping around to different chapters and fast forwarding through parts of others.
Despite these problems, I do still recommend this because you get a 90+ minute video ... and because it's on DVD and you can skip to what you need, it still can be useful to everyone.  Some people may not care about going to Bath like I did, so they could just skip to Belfast if that is what they were interested in.  It was also nice to come back from my trip and see everything again, including a pub in Broad Campden we ate at that I didn't even realize was on the DVD.
What I don't understand is that I have seen Rick's show on PBS, and I have seen episodes which dealt entirely on London, so I don't know why more on the city wasn't included.  Perhaps he needed to come up with two DVDs, one on London and other sights in England, and another on Scotland, Ireland and Wales.  Perhaps this production is a victim of trying to do too much in one title, rather than giving proper treatment to everything covered.
I would still buy this DVD, but realize that it might not have everything you want, it might have things you don't want, and you'll definitely have to supplement it with a Great Britian guidebook and possibly on on London itself.",1017792000,18,2176,4.43859649122807
1640816,5,B00005OCKK,"If you love Italy and love to travel but are constrained by money or the obligations of work and family, this video is for you. Rick Steves is the kind of guy your mother probably wanted you to marry - practical, articulate and fun to be around.  He approaches travel with such a positive attitude that he makes you ashamed you are sitting at home! Some of the footage here is new to me and some is ""recycled"" from his shows. However, the picture and sound quality on the DVD make it a good buy for this arm chair traveller. He covers the classic tourist places and some that are truly off the beaten path.  He peppers the DVD with his philosophy on being a tourist, an American, on packing light and on dealing with the occasional problem. Since he travels most of the time, his insights are worth hearing. I love cheap travel and I like knowing ""secret"" places to sleep, eat and sight see - (Although after being shown on a TV program across the USA, how secret will it be?)  Anyway, when I'm feeling a little lonely for Italy, I pop in the DVD and in a few minutes I'm back in one of the most exciting countries in Europe - with a perfect guide at my side.",1014076800,87,1159,4.235294117647059

1640821,5,B00005OCKK,"Please, note that this is an intro CD.

There is no way Steves could have crammed everything from three easy-to-navigate English-speaking countries into one DVD. So, expectations should be lowered a bit.

Besides, at the bargain price of $9.99 or less NEW, can you really complain that much?

If you're wanting a more ""professional"" souvenir video, there are plenty available for $29.99 or whatever. Otherwise, I personally happen to like Steves' ""man on the street"" approach.

For people who don't ""get it"" when seeing one of his TV shows, or a DVD or DVD compilation, for Steves, foreign vacations are about seeing **people** and not just seeing **sights.** Would-be American tourists who don't appreciate this would be advised to yes, indeed, consider another video.

Likewise, for people who expect a travel video to somehow **substitute** for a book.

Trust me, especially for the price, every one of Steves' multi-country DVD compilations deserves a five-star rating.",1136246400,3,973,5.245161290322581

Rick Steves explores the British Isles in order to experience local customs and to mingle with the locals in pubs and at festivals. The London & Edinburgh show is perhaps the funniest Rick Steves' travel diary yet. These are very personal journeys, not unlike a travel diary that tells of who you met and where you ate, not to mention which museum you discovered.

Rick Steves has an amazing talent for making the unknown seem like something you may want to discover. He also has a great appreciation for beauty and likes to have fun traveling with his family. He takes his family on a day trip to Blackpool where they enjoy Amusement Park rides. His wife is all smiles as Rick Steves explains the historical significance of monuments to his children. She seems to be having the best time of her life and seems to share Rick Steves' sense of adventure.

The three main sections of this DVD include:

London & Edinburgh
Wales, Cotswold & Bath
Ireland, Dublin & Belfast

Then there are three special sections for Blenheim Palace, Blackpool and Stratford. You get to see where Shakespeare's wife lived (Anne Hathaway's Cottage), where they now put on Shakespeare's plays in a replica of the original theatre, the Globe. The gardens are refreshing and somewhat untamed in all their beauty. If you love gardening, you may enjoy the brief moments when you can guess the names of the flowers as the camera sweeps through the garden.

There are also scenes of gorgeous outdoor settings with rushing streams amidst romantic settings, crumbling stonewalls that run for miles through the countryside (Hadrian's Wall), mansions you could get lost in and little tea shops hidden in bed and breakfast locations in quaint towns. The food looks especially delicious and if you stay in a quaint B&B, the owners can give recommendations, not to mention giving you directions for how to find your way around the Cotswold Villages.

Rick Steves freely gives his advice and explains why he enjoys Cambridge over Oxford and gives tips on how to pack for your vacation. He also shows how to preserve your memories by taking great pictures.

Of all the travel shows on the British Isles, this completely explains the main events in history, highlights the places you want to visit or lets you vicariously enjoy memories of your trip to London, Ireland or Wales. You may also start dreaming of again visiting Medieval castles or have a desire to learn how to make an Irish cable knit sweater or start looking for a cardigan.

As someone who has been to London as a teenager, this DVD made me wish I could instantly return for a long vacation! Especially to see the castles. Until I can travel again, I'll live vicariously through Rick Steves' magnificent and fun adventures. He has a great sense of humor and his love for travel will awaken your own sense of discovery.

Highly Recommended.

P.S. If you enjoy the Best of Travels in Europe adventure, look for Rick Steves' Great Britain 2005, a book that is a nice companion to the DVD.",1135728000,5,3144,4.801851851851852
1640823,5,B00005OCKK,"Rick Steves is the best for any type of traveller. I enjoyed watching his PBS shows, reading his books, and of course perusing this dvd set. Rick Steves brings us to many different places in Europe and gives us wise advice to save our money and enjoy our travelling. He shows us how to make a budget and pack lightly so that we are not stuck with any worries besides picking of course different regional cuisine, desserts, liquors, museum tours, or public attractions. My favorites on the dvds are his trips through Austria where he partakes in the music (mozart's country) and the chocolate; Italy- with the art, the gondolas, and the food in general: and lastly Turkey with the open shopping marts and local entertainment.

Its hard not to like Steves since he is so laid back, so well informed, and his advice is easy to follow. Another big plus is that he won't break your bank with these travels, he doesnt lure you to 4 star lodgings, but hostels and country inns. He opts for brown bagging, picnics, and cafeterias instead of sit down dining, and likes to scope out the museum tours and art galleries that are as beautiful but less talked about compared to say the Louvre or Notre Dame. Rick Steve's dvds give you the optimism to plan a European vacation and that it can be attainable and not just a dream.

 The only problem that people may find is that it can be a little out to date, but I have found that Rick tends to update his travel books each year and those are extremely informative.

This is a great set for anyone looking to travel or just enjoy learning about new countries.",1131753600,4,1594,4.4862068965517246

1640825,5,B00005OCKK,"I love this DVD because Rick Steves is honest, and will tell things as is. No bull. Many of us may dream that Venice is the perfect romantic place. He warns us about the many tourist and the big crowds, the water is dirty, and you can get mugged. I think to have the best vacation possible, we need to be warned of such things so you'll know to be careful. Bring the right things such a money belt. He wasn't being negitive at all, just how he sees things. I'm taking my first trip to Italy, even my first trip overseas ever, and I'm very grateful for his honesty. Because I'm so aware of things now, I plan to have a safe trip and a trip of a lifetime.",1120608000,8,653,4.030769230769231
1640826,5,B00005OCKK,"I have several of Rick Steves travel videos/book-I buy them to prep for my vacations and I find them very helpful. Apparently some reviewers prefer the old-fashion, scenes and voice-overs routine-this is not that! Rick Steves prefers a personable appraoch which obviously serves two purposes; first of all it engages the viewer on a casual level (as a fellow traveler)which allows us to join in the adventure. Secondly, he role-models the proper etiquette/manners all travelers should demonstrate as they mingle with citizens of other countries. He does this while he points out key/traditional sites to visit as well as places off the beaten path you might prefer to venture to as well. Remember, vacations are restricted to a time-frame, you cannot possibly do everything and see everything so, with that in mind follow Rick Steves no-nonsense approach of sticking to the basics while customizing your vacation by ""thinking ahead."" Another feature I've learned to appreciate is the little tid-bits Rick Steves peppers through out his shows like,""how to pack/what to take."" Point being-you're on vacation-not moving in! Rick Steves focus is to help you streamline your holidays so that your memories will be more than just one-big-blur! As a traveler, I trust Rick Steves because he himself is a traveler and has been since his youth-it's his life, not a pastime, as it is with so many other would-be-traveler-writers.
