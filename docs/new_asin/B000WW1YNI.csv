8225960,5,B000WW1YNI,"OK, some may ask how somebody adds a review about something that has not been released yet. Well, frankly speaking my intention is more to inform Naruto fans rather than providing a typical review (Spoilers INCLUDED!!!).

To begin with, I am able to watch the shows from were I currently live, outside the US, and in the US the shows are rather far behind. Second, a reviewer of Box set 5, correctly stated that currently the shows have surpassed the 200 episodes. If my memory serves me well, Naruto currently has reached 223 episodes; plus the two movies with which most of you are informed with. Thing is that I am collecting the episodes through Amazon and the way they sell it will most probably take forever to complete it.

Now, judging from the cover it most probably will be the DVD that will cover the fight between Gara vs. Sasuke, inside a forest, and when he fails to beat Gara - even with his dark powers - Naruto will take on the fight in which he will employ his Clone Jutsu, the evocation powers - something that he learned before the final exams (you should probably see it in Box Set nr. 6) and of course his fox powers. In this fight Gara will reveal his true nature and after loosing close to Naruto something changes. For the first time he will realize that the strongest power to fight for, is LOVE and protecting others and not hate. Something that will be reflected in his change of behavior as well. Unfortunately, on the other hand, Sasuke will realize how really strong Naruto is and compared to him - and in his way, meaning the way he sees things - Sasuke will consider himself as weak.

In other words, this DVD - assuming that my assumption is accurate and it refers to this battle (always judging from its cover) - is one of the major turning points in the Naruto series for two reasons. 1) Gara starts to change (and in episodes 230+) we will also see that he is considered a true friend by Naruto and that is why he will also rush to help him in time of need and 2. This is the starting point that will lead to the famous great fight between Naruto (at that time he will have mastered the ONE TAIL FOX POWER and NOT all nine of them) and Sasuke's ultimate dark side.

As for the extras and judging from the DVDs that have been released so far, they will be respectively the same as the ones they put in the current DVDs.

Well, one thing is for sure with Naruto: that the story does constantly evolve, gets more and more interesting and better, never boring, plus we see that Naruto's and Hinana's feelings start to develop (although till now I don't know who will end up with whom).

I hope that I could help...

PS: As for the ones of you who just stumbled across this show, I highly recommend it!",1193356800,3,2734,4.349019607843137
