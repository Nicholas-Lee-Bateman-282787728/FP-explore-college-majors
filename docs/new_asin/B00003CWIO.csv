7917176,3,B00003CWIO,Purchased this mainly for nostalgic reasons. Most peoples first introduction to Peter Pan is the Disney or Mary Martin version this was my first introduction.,1383955200,,158,5.36
7917177,2,B00003CWIO,"My grandsons love Disney books.  We often read one and then I order the movie.
I inadvertently ordered this version of Peter Pan.  It is not a delightful as
the original Disney movie.  I learned a lesson here.  The Disney was more expensive, but worth the difference.",1349827200,,267,4.617021276595745
7917178,5,B00003CWIO,"I used to take naps on Saturday afternoons watching Nickelodeon way back in the early 90's and a show called ""Special Delivery"" used to come on. It featured this and other short animated features. I used to get this french horn melody stuck in my head (see all the fans on Youtube [...]) The animation is solid television standard, but nowhere near as nice as Disney. I'm a huge fan of non- Disney features, and I never imagined I'd get to see this again. It was animated by Burbank Studios. An animation studio in Australia. The DVD is no- frills, but it serves it's purpose. This was a pure nostalgic joy, that I'm really proud to have in my collection.",1307404800,,655,4.466666666666667
7917179,1,B00003CWIO,"First of all let me say that I'm somewhat of an aficionado when it comes to Peter Pan.  I own 25 or 30 different print versions, a half dozen audiobook versions, and another half dozen video versions.  I've seen the play live several times in everything from high school productions to summer stock to professional touring companies.  I realized when I ordered this DVD that it was an animated version aimed at younger children.  I have nothing against that concept; several of the versions I already own are abridged, animated, or storybook versions.  But this version is by far the worst of any I have seen.  The story line has been modified so much that it's barely recognizable, the characters have no personalities, the animation is amateurish and lacks detail, and the voice acting is stilted and unemotional.  I was hoping to find a version that would be appropriate for my four year old grandson.  This isn't it.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Peter-Pan-Nutech-Digital/dp/B00003CWIO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Peter Pan (Nutech Digital)</a>",1284681600,2,1086,5.579268292682927
7917180,5,B00003CWIO,"This is the version of Peter Pan that I grew up with, and thankfully I've found it after years of searching. (and thanks to the other reviewer, Taran, for posting this and another movie online, which is how I came to find it.)

It's a great version of the story and still kept me entertained and made me laugh all these years later. I think any little kid would certainly enjoy it. One thing I found is that it is not close-captioned as stated in the 'Format' section of the product details, which I would have liked. Other than this, I am very excited with my purchase and encourage you to buy this version of the classic story.",1217808000,,629,4.330508474576271
7917181,5,B00003CWIO,"If Burbank Films Australia has not created the most faithful adaptations of classic literature they have definitely produced some of the most charming introductions to these stories made especially for children.  Peter Pan, originally released in the year 1988, is, if not an adaptation, an introduction to J. M. Barrie's classic story of the boy who would never grow up.  A low-budget production, perhaps, but fun and creative in many ways, and sure to delight young children.  Though this animated library for children features tales not intended for children, these animations certainly serve, as I've said, as perfect introductions that will make children who cherish them eventually want to pick up the books and learn the full story for themselves.  That's what happened to me, I don't see why it shouldn't happen to any other child.  This obscure and under-appreciated company, which today has become the Burbank Animation Studios, is responsible for sparkling in me an interest for stories such as Anthony Hope's ""The Prisoner of Zenda,"" Jules Verne's ""20,000 Thousand Leagues Under the Sea"" and Kenneth Grahame's ""The Wind in the Willows.""

I'll pity anyone who doesn't know the story of Peter Pan, and in any case, I'll briefly summarize it here.  One night, after the three Darling children, Wendy, John and Michael, have listened to their bedtime story, their mother and father prepare to leave for the night.  The three children are certain that the hero of their favorite stories, a boy by the name of Peter Pan who never grows up and has the amazing ability to fly, is a true person and as real as any of them.  Shortly after being left alone, Peter Pan returns in search of his own shadow, which he had left behind after a previous visit to the Darling household in London.  The children are awakened by Peter and his pixie fairy, Tinkerbell, and shortly after the boy invites all three of them to join him on a visit to his home, the enchanted place called Neverland.  With the help of lovely thoughts, a wiggle of the shoulders and pixie dust, Peter Pan leads the three children to the enchanted where they meet mermaids, Indians and pirates.  The chief pirate, Captain Hook, is a vicious pirate that seeks revenge on Peter Pan after the boy had playfully cut off his right hand and fed it to the crocodile.  More importantly, Captain Hook wants to rid the island of any ""mother,"" for Peter Pan had assigned Wendy to be his mother as well as that of the Lost Boys, a group of motherless rascals in need of loving care.  Peter Pan and his friends battle each of Hook's schemes, until the time comes to return home, and continue growing like all children must.

An adult seeking elaborate animation, professional voice-acting, obnoxious pop-songs and things like that will find Burbank Films Australia's ""Peter Pan"" to be very dull.  On the other hand, there's plenty here that a small child will find highly amusing.  For one thing, the film is filled with colorful sceneries; the opening of the film alone, where Wendy Darling narrates about the many creatures that inhabit Neverland, is simply charming.  The animation here is really well done as well.  No, it's not Disney by any means, but as far as low budget animations go, it is very smooth and lively.  Another highlight is the music; the film, like all other B.F.A. productions features its own theme melody.  In this case, it is a soft, simplistic tune that plays throughout the film, blending itself with the mystical, fantasy like setting and tying it all together nicely.  There's a lot of humor; the way some characters, particularly Captain Hook and his henchmen, are portrayed is funny in a clean and clever kind of way.  Watching Captain Hook's outrageous facial expressions as he plays his harmonica, or hearing him begin to tell his favorite tale (""It was a dark and stormy night..."") definitely will inspire laughter of the best kind.  I must warn more sensitive viewers about something that may be of concern to some people.  Captain Hook's two henchmen, an obviously Italian one and a larger, somewhat empty-headed black one, may seem as negative stereotypes of two different cultures.  On the other hand, these characterizations are due to them being the ""dumb villains,"" nothing to do with racial undertones.  Someone else will prefer seeing it differently and thus ruin his or her viewing experience, and that's a shame, but what can you do?  Instead, a person should consider the wonderful values that this film provides.  Its message is sweet and universal.  Small boys (and girls) need the tender and loving care of a mother (and father), and the always cruel truth that childhood is a precious gift that unfortunately cannot last forever.  All these things are nicely put together, thus creating a rare jewel of an obscure film, bound to be cherished by children and remembered when that precious gift is through.",1212624000,2,4909,4.878313253012048
7917182,3,B00003CWIO,"I remember watching this movie on television years ago and thought it was a great version of Peter Pan besides Disney's.  I've been looking for it since it stopped airing and am so glad I found it!  It isn't that long, but the quality and innocence of the story I think is great for young viewers to enjoy.",1133136000,,306,4.258620689655173
