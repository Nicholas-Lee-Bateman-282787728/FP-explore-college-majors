I love Rutger Hauer, so I thought I would give it a chance and I was so impressed by the direction and the all the actors. Why isn't this a theater release? Who knows?

2452461,3,B000C20VTG,"Had to have this movie. Our Marine son was stationed in the Philippines as the Detachment Commander when a Hollywood producer asked if he'd like to be in a movie. He's the guy with the dimple who shouts out a couple of lines in the helicopter before it went down. Pretty bad movie, but we always watch the first five minutes.",1283472000,,325,4.344262295081967
2452462,1,B000C20VTG,"Another failure for ""Nanofilms""! I wish I had their address so that I could send them the $7.00 that it cost to make this movie. If someone could please have Rutger give me a call so that I can make sure he has enough money to eat. This movie was so poorly directed, I would be surprised if that director still has a job. For those who gave it a great review, I will give you a number for your nearest military recruiter. This movie showed an utter lack of respect for this country's military and especially the USMC. If you enjoy watching movies, save yourself the time and money and DO NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE.",1155254400,11,609,4.258620689655173
2452463,1,B000C20VTG,I would not even rate this movie a 1 star.  This is the most ridiculus movie I have ever watched.  I wasted $17.99 on this I could have used the money and given it to the Red Cross.  This was the worst action movie i have ever seen.,1153612800,6,232,3.7916666666666665
2452464,4,B000C20VTG,"I felt like I was watching something that could be akin to a video game produced by the United States Army (or maybe something from Clancy).  The maneuvers seems like those that I have seen in training films, historical films, et cetera.  The action is what is important, not the character development, think of this movie as one 90 minute examination of modern day combat against terrorists around the world.  It isn't Shakespeare, but it isn't meant to be.  Don't expect intricate dialogue and philosophy.

The story was not that bad of a story, in my opinion, at least it wasn't the Rambo ""I can shoot a thousand bullets and hit every one of the enemies, and then they shoot a thousand toward me, and not hit me once"" mentality of some movies out there.  The movie is not a perfect movie, I won't say that it is.  The story deals with terrorists and how terrorists can be found anywhere and everywhere just like real life.  This isn't paranoia, this is brutal fact that there is always danger against freedom.

The torture scene, I wish to point out, is not realistic.  The torture of humans is a bit more complex and a lot more bloody, though I find its inclusion in the film a good point to be made--that all these liberals whine that America ""tortures"" our captives, when the Islamic fanatics (not to be confused by the more peaceful Islamic) go all out of their way to torture people, especially those who are Christians (which does happen, Islamic fanatical countries do go out of their way to torture and brutally kill Christians).

Most of all what I appreciate about this movie is that it doesn't degrade the military like Hollywood tries to do in so many ways these days.  For Hollywood, anyone who fights against terrorism anywhere and at any time is considered ""evil"" and ""intolerant"" simply because they are trying to protect our freedom from these criminals (then again calling terrorists criminals is ""intolerant"" anyway, or so says the liberal media).  The men who live and die and fight another day for we who are at the home front should always be respected and honored.",1148860800,14,2090,4.662125340599455
2452465,3,B000C20VTG,"As with most modern B movies they are quite watchable if you have the right B movie kind of company..iE lotsa  not too smart friends who just want to see and hear gun fire.

Recommended for the not too smart OR HIGH TECH inclined movie buffs ...for those who have a bit of intellect I ask you to stay away.....the stars are Big name  B+ movie stars so that in itself is a good thing if you are so inclined.",1139875200,3,406,4.05
2452466,1,B000C20VTG,"If you are a Rutger Hauer fan then ok but bewarned that he only is in about 5-7 minutes of this 91 minute movie, his apearances are broken up into 30-45 second clips.

His acting hardly shines in this flick and the rest of the actors are for the most part in this a no show.

All in all the movie blows chunks, if you are any kind of war movie fan that expects some combat realism and correct combat terminology to be used by the actors then forget this one.

Example - Throughout the movie the marines constantly referred to the rebels as ""bogies"", that and other mess ups throughout the movie makes it sad and laughable.

There is no true target adience for this film, too much blood and violence IMO for the kids and the acting is way too poor to really be enjoyed by an adult.

Perhaps a few teenagers will overlook this films many negatives.

Need I say more??",1139443200,5,865,4.2439024390243905
2452467,1,B000C20VTG,"I was drawn in by the professional looking cover and jacket photos.  Little did I know that was the best of the movie.

ACTING:  Theresa Randle was completely unbelievable as a military chopper pilot, and Rutger Hauer was equally unbelievable as a Marine general.  Both lacked emotion and urgency in their portrayals, while Randle's character was flat (at least figuratively) and a whimp, Hauer's was dumpy and, well, also a whimp (I can not imagine that any self-respecting Marine would appreciate this movie).  The acting of most of the secondary characters, including most of those portraying the terrorists was also lame and un-noteworthy.

TECHNICAL:  The film was clearly shot with quality equipment, while many of the sound effects were as poor as the acting.  In fact, at some points sound effects were left out, like when Capt. Jennings (Randle) karate kicks one of the terrorist guards, the sound of the kick is non-existent.  The film avoids showing graphic violence, but does so in such a way that makes the movie appear to be simply budget.

STORY:  The story is weak, with many things happening without apparent motivation, reason, or even any degree of retro-explanation.  If you pick up this DVD and read the back ccover, you will know as much about the movie as if you'd wasted the entire 91 minutes watching the disc.

Well, except you might still think Randle and Hauer are decent actors...

Seriously though, resist the slick and compelling packaging, and hunt for anything else besides Eagle One!",1138060800,10,1517,4.968253968253968
2452468,1,B000C20VTG,"This movie was as bad as it could get. The action was unreal and didn't really include any good acting. Throughout the whole movie there was a lot of shooting, and that's about it. It actually got really annoying with the same sound automatic rifle repeating over and over and over. I actually knew what was going to happen just by watchin a few minutes of it, it was pretty predictable. It doesn't really draw the viewer in and you almost don't even care what happens to the main character. It's also pretty low budget, so don't be fooled by the interesting lookin scene photos on the back of the DVD.",1137888000,2,602,4.4324324324324325

8095334,2,B000C20VTG,"Ive said it before: action heroes shouldnt do these military team movies. Playing a member of a regulated squad is bound to result in a lot less screen time and focus on the star of the movie, and Mark Dacascos role in Crash Point is no exception. This is an impersonal, unoriginal little adventure with very mild high points, populated by characters I didn't care about. In a word, its overlookable.

The story: When the leader of a murderous rebel movement (Dick Israel,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bio-Kids/dp/6303102743/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bio Kids</a>) steals a new technology with which to hijack planes by remote control, a strike force led by Captain Matt Daniels (Dacascos) is dispatched to retrieve it.

I haven't watched the original&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Hunt-for-Eagle-One/dp/B000C20VTG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Hunt for Eagle One</a>, but if any of the returning characters were established there, they don't carry over any personality. Dacascos immediate costar is Theresa Randle (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bad-Boys/dp/B00K7BH5NC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bad Boys</a>&nbsp;series), and she barely has more luck endearing herself than Mark and his teammates. Jeff Faheys (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Lawnmower-Man/dp/6304604572/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Lawnmower Man</a>) here to supply occasional narration, and Joe Mari Avellana is utterly wasted in a do-nothing part. The film manages to create at least some tension in its final quarter, but its too little come too late, after too many drawn-out shootouts.

Said final quarter also includes a decent fight between Mark and supporting villain Boy Roque, wherein Roque attacks with a knife and Mark counters with a computer keyboard. Beyond this, theres nothing to get excited about, though there's plenty of directorial weirdness to raise an eyebrow at. The movie is on life support through the grace of stock footage from bigger and better movies. Additionally, for some reason, almost all of the original footage has been edited to include a noticeable color contrast  giving the movie the same look that conventional flicks reserve only for flashback scenes.

Luckily, this franchise seems to have run its course long before I even got to it, and I look forward to not watching any additional sequels. I don't recommend anyone else sees this, unless you're completely out of other Dacascos material.",1459296000,2,2585,6.332386363636363
