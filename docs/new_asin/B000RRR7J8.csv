8202424,5,B000RRR7J8,"From the back cover: 'Leroy the Donkey, T.R. the Rooster, Rover Joe the Hound Dog, and sassy Miss Casgut are determined to escape from their mean, rotten, masters...and their masters are equally determined to keep them down on the farm. Will the gallant, jazz-playing animals make it to freedom and fame? Only Kermit the Frog knows for sure...and you know what a great storyteller he is! A charming and music-filled modern fable.'

A wonderful video and the usual Muppet sweetnes prevails.",1234483200,2,489,5.037037037037037
