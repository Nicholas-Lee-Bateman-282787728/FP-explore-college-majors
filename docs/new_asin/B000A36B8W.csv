Just general behind the scenes interviews with various people from the show.",1384300800,,256,4.840909090909091
8073801,4,B000A36B8W,"This is a pretty nice add-on to your Seinfeld DVD collection. From start to finish it lasts only thirteen minutes though. Therefore, if you are a Hardcore Seinfeld Fan I would advise that you definitely buy this DVD but DO NOT PAY a lot for it. I got mine right here in amazon auctions brand new and sealed for five bucks, shipping included.

The DVD starts with a three-minute promo of Seasons 1 to 3 on DVD. Then it goes to the featurette called ""The Bench"" Life Before Seinfeld. As the title shows this is a featurette interviewing the ""Bench"" players of this great show. They tell us about their acting carriers prior to Seinfeld. It is very interesting and entertaining. It lasts ten minutes with a final commentary by Jerry Seinfeld. The actors that are interviewed are: Wayne Knight ""Newman"", Patrick Warburton ""Puddy"", Bryan Cranston ""Dr. Tim Whatley"" now known as Malcolm in The Middle's Dad, Heidi Swedberg ""Susan Ross"", Barney Martin ""Morty Seinfeld"", Liz Sheridan ""Helen Seinfeld"", Estelle Harris ""Estelle Costanza"", Jerry Stiller ""Frank Costanza"", Len Lesser ""Uncle Leo"", Reni Santoni ""Poppie"", Danny Woodburn ""Mickey"", Phil Morris ""Jackie Chiles"", Steve Hytner ""Bania"" and Brian George ""Babu Bhatt"".",1195948800,9,1213,5.0954773869346734
8073802,2,B000A36B8W,"Since there is no description of this DVD on the site, here it is.  This was a bonus disc that was given out as a Best Buy promotion when you bought one of the volumes 1 and 2 or 3.  The DVD simply contains additional interviews from cast members that play George and Jerry's parents, Newman, Puddy, Uncle Leo and more.  The DVD is entitled, ""Life Before Seinfeld"".

It isn't a bad DVD if you are interested in watching the interviews; however, if you don't own it now then you aren't missing much.",1148083200,91,498,4.32258064516129
