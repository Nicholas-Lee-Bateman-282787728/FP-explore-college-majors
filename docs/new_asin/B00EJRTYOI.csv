Both sets due in November. Don't know about the quality but it is bound to be better than the bootlegs I bought.",1380326400,,392,15.291666666666666
5923772,3,B00EJRTYOI,"Took years before subsequent seasons were released so I was quite enthused to pre-order this having previously bought all that were available in years past. 'Tis possible the novelty wore off (I was born in the 1960s so really do not recall the show when on primetime.) For one thing there are a few episodes I've seen which is odd for a 'never released' DVD, it's never on in re-runs (on) our cable network & from childhood I only recall beginning scene. About half the episodes I'll never watch again, other half a bit more growth in writing but some of the soundtrack (i.e. the waif in the boys home Linc takes an interest in) is unbearably sappy. On the plus side Julie finally gets to expand her role to something beyond being tearfully rescued and she actually drives a car! Some very good guest stars such as Vincent Price. All & all if you love this show as I do you may feel same, likely find it more enjoyable though for those who actually saw all of these when they were on primetime and those younger than I who do not remember the '60s at all.",1380153600,,1056,4.365482233502538
5923773,5,B00EJRTYOI,"Kudos to VEI for finally resurrecting THE MOD SQUAD on DVD. After two seasons/four volumes were released in 2007-2009, CBS abandoned this iconic psychadelic relic and left us hanging with some of the best MOD moments yet to come.

While the picture quality isn't as stellar here as it was on the CBS releases, the show has never looked this good on television before despite the presence of minor dirt and debris here and there. They even included the original opening bumpers ""The Mod Squad: In Color"", so purists will be delighted.

My only complaint is that the actual cover art is different from what is shown here on Amazon--and it isn't as nice IMO and looks rather low-res compared to the CBS releases. But who am I kidding? I'd buy this in a plain brown wrapper because the shows are what I want! Thank you VEI!",1379462400,9,819,4.5646258503401365
5923774,5,B00EJRTYOI,It was always a GREAT TV Police drama when I was a child. I will watch it over & over again !!!,1388448000,,95,3.3636363636363638
5923775,5,B00EJRTYOI,"Thank you so much VEI for completing this long anticipated series after CBS dropped the ball. The picture quality isn't as sharp as the first two seasons, but I'm not complaining. It's 100 times better than the bootleg DVDs I bought a few years ago, which I can now happily toss!",1386374400,,279,4.490196078431373
5923776,5,B00EJRTYOI,"My husband was a huge fan of the show in 70's, he's hoping that they will release the rest of the seasons.",1385942400,,106,3.8636363636363638
5923777,3,B00EJRTYOI,"While I admit it's great to finally have the entire series available (I've also picked up season 4 and will get season 5 once it is released), the quality is non on par with the first two seasons that were released by CBS many years ago.

While some episodes are much 'cleaner' than others, I don't believe these episodes have received a full restoration. I'm not as well versed in this series as some others might be but I also believe a few of the ones I have watched (both in season 3 and season 4) are edited. I saw running times between 48/51 minutes. I don't believe any restoration job has been done on these. There's a lot of dirt and debris and at times lines that run across the screen. The season 3 episodes that I did see had the 'IN COLOR' tag at the beginning which was fun to see as none of the episodes from the first two seasons had that.

Another reviewer noted that there is a white line that runs along the right side of the picture in some episodes. I saw that too. Not sure where it comes from however I wonder if it has to do with the soundtrack and properly framing the film elements when trasferring.

I still give this three stars since, as I mentioned it is good to have the series as an official release. The episodes are fun to watch. We can get spoiled as consumers with picture quality etc. however I come from an era where I used to record some of my favorite shows on audio cassette or have seen prints of tv shows in far worse shape before they remasatered things. I'm probably a little more forgiving than the average consumer of such things. I look at it this way; what would be a return on investment? Traditionally with catalog titles season 1 does great and sales dwindle for subsequent seasons. I have no idea the cost to restore three seasons of a show (granted I only have seasons 3 and 4 now and am making the assumption that things won't be different with season 5)  but I assume it isn't cheap. I have no idea when the show was last seen in syndication on a regular basis although I know ME-TV has run some random episodes on weekends from time to time. Since VEI has apparently made some arrangement with CBS (like Shout! Factory has done with some major studios with their releases), I think they are working with what the elements provided to them. A restoration could have been too cost prohibitive and just kept the remainder of this series off the shelf. So for that reason only, I can excuse the fact that they haven't been restored and recommend these because it's great to see them again.",1384560000,,2542,4.3452631578947365
5923778,5,B00EJRTYOI,Great DVD - A Must Buy!  Younger people can learn from this era.  What was happening back then is still happening today!!,1383523200,,121,4.454545454545454
5923779,3,B00EJRTYOI,"I know we were all spoiled with the clean CBS releases, but until you get over it that these are finally released, the quality of the picture is disappointing. It's like watching the syndicated versions on WOR-TV from New York without the annoying commercials. Mod Squad shot a lot at night and the darkness is almost always washed out in these. The first two seasons never had this. Mine also did have a white line on the right during the first episode.  When viewing these, just pretend you're watching them on Dad's old 23 inch Zenith TV and its 1972 again. That's about what they look like! CBS & VEI have given us the genuine experience to see them the same way we originally did with ALMOST VHS Hi-Fi quality!

One reviewer stated about the artwork. I thought the artwork is the same, in fact it's better because they've included a slipcase which the others never did. At least mine did from Target. Well, at least they're out for reminiscing purposes.",1383264000,5,958,4.5964912280701755
5923780,5,B00EJRTYOI,IT Was A Great Show With An Lot Of Real Feelings; Dealing With Issues We All At Sometime In Life Had To Deal With.  But To See Others Handling These Same Issues Within An Career As Police Officers Was An Great Teaching Show.,1382400000,,224,4.209302325581396
5923781,5,B00EJRTYOI,I'm 31 years old and I love classic TV shows and The Mod Squad tops my favorite Classic TV all time and I love all the actors on the show but I do have a favorite actor and that is Michael Cole known as Pete Cochran he was so gorgeous and still is today.,1381968000,,254,3.7222222222222223
5923782,3,B00EJRTYOI,"Previous half-seasons at least had closed captioning, but starting with this one, guess they decided to save money on that (and as other reviewers mentioned, on the cover art and the transfer quality).  Just watched the disappointing opening episode -- love Peggy Lipton, but surely they could have given her more to do than that (admittedly fetching) soulful-sad-girl look she does throughout this episode and wearing different clothes in every scene.  She doesn't drive in this episode.  Stays in the car during the gunfight (but helpfully yells out that the criminal is, gasp, ""he's over there!"")  Makes Pete a commiserating cup of coffee like a good sister.  Wouldn't have lasted a day in Cagney & Lacey's unit.  Clarence Williams similarly underutilized, though he does get a medium-shot fistfight in.  Maybe the pace will pick up in the rest of the shows?",1381363200,,861,5.0638297872340425
5923783,5,B00EJRTYOI,"Was too young when this show came out but caught it on re-runs....funny how I still love it!  The thing that amazes me is the kind of topics this show would address; the war, racism, child abuse etc.  Was one of the first shows to address these types of provocative issues.  By today's standards, the writing is sometimes a bit cheesy but need to compare it to what was on at the time and this show was a leader.  Love the development of the characters and their affection for each other.

Couple of issues.  One, as someone else mentioned, the cover art is no bueno.  It's got to be some of the worst photos of the three of them I've ever seen!  Can't understand why they didn't have access to other images.  Also, the transfer quality isn't as great as Seasons 1 and 2.  On a couple of episodes, at least in my copy, there's a white line marking the edge of the screen....since it's on the edge, it doesn't interfere with seeing the episode but just kind of distracting nevertheless.

All in all, I really love watching these shows.  It's a must have if you're a fan of classic television and of The Mod Squad in particular!",1380931200,,1126,4.360576923076923

8606072,5,B00EJRTYOI,Love the family aspect to this series.,1451865600,,38,4.571428571428571
8606073,2,B00EJRTYOI,I love The mod Squad but as I watched Season 3 disc two with Sammy Davis Jr it skipped and I never got to see the rest of it. Then the next episode the mouth did not go with the voice...I hope the rest of Season 3 is better.  Have had problems with the set of five I ordered in the box set.  This series means a lot to me.  Its part of my childhood and it's frustrating how these DVDs are such poor quality.  I think another company would be better because I don't think I'm the only one upset. Oh but do I ever love Michael Cole...I was a kid with a huge crush on him.  I forgot what a hunk he was!!!  Still love the guy...and this show.,1442361600,,638,3.83206106870229

8606076,5,B00EJRTYOI,"I got this video because I'm a huge fan of Veleka Gray from the six soaps she starred in.  It was a pleasure to see the teenaged Veleka play a bad girl in the episode ""Welcome to The Human Race, Levi Frazee.""  She was a beautiful and talented actress, even in the beginning.",1393372800,,274,4.150943396226415

8606078,5,B00EJRTYOI,"I was doubtful if the seasons after 1 & 2 would ever see the light of day. Thank VEI, Canada, that they have! We now have all 5 seasons to watch and enjoy. I won't go into what Mod Squad's about - you're either hip to it, or not. What I will say, is that I was perplexed that some reviews have commented on poor picture and sound quality. On a regular sized screen, the picture quality is excellent! If it hasn't been remastered or cleaned up to some degree, then it doesn't seem to need it. It has clear bright colours, sharp image - you can see the pores on a face! Sound is also loud and clear. Not released in the UK, but no trouble to have it sent and a fair price too. Keep the faith!!",1391817600,,691,3.9784172661870505
