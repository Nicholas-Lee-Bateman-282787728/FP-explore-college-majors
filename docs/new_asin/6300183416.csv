The ""contemporary urban sprawl as post-nuclear wasteland"" theme worked well, but other than that--well, I generally like films with very  little plot, but this just did nothing for me.  What would have saved it  would have been sharp and compelling dialogue, but there was none.  I'm  sorry, but there just wasn't.  None of the characters were at all  sympathetic, although Stanton's acting job was exemplary.  All in all, a  sort of vaguely interesting film, but a strangely non-compelling one, from  which I felt oddly detatched.  I did like the way the closing credits  scrolled down instead of up, though.

217076,5,6300183416,"Tremendous film, it goes without saying!
A brilliant nihilist masterpiece by creative genius Mr. Alex Cox.

This is a very good U.K. release but it's a bit grainy as can be seen in my images. I have a number of Bluray discs that look like this but my 4K player tends to reduce this texture, I am using a Multi Region SONY BDP S1700 for this review and a 4K TV*.

There are some great extras including the edited TV version, which is quite funny for obvious reasons. Repo Man for Family Viewing maybe?

I really enjoy the 42 page booklet/scrapbook, it has fascinating information and some great pictures.

A VERY worthwhile release, especially for collectors!



This review is for the EUREKA  U.K. Region B Bluray release.

product
packaging: 2 stars.  cover looks good but other wise its a lot of mediocre drawings that perhaps are attempting to resemble the style of some of the punk rock discs/albums of the early 80s .  long booklet haven't read yet (hope to update this).
special features: 3 stars.  great commentary but i believe its from early 90's.  Has Nesmith, Cox and others giving excellent insight into the making and vision of the movie
main feature: 5 stars.  Just gets better every time.  its bleak but funny without being downright cruel. The running jokes are great and each time catch a few new touches (like the punks shaking the hand of the drunk rather than beating him up ala clockwork orange).  The barren urban landscape is captured perfectly and becomes an alternate universe of its own; ugly but with some strange character.  The movie really captures the  strangeness of the modern world.  As they say in the commentary it wouldnt have worked if it wasn't a comedy.  The movie is bleak but certainly funny , mirthful even.  With so many indie films nowadays being gloomy and slow moving, Repo Man is a high water mark of character , vision and tempo.",1482883200,,1188,4.658653846153846

217201,5,6300183416,"Punk rock was all about tearing down mainstream culture while all the while avoiding pretense and posturing. Its chief weapon was corrosive and self-lacerating reflexive irony. Needless to say, the punk movement was untenable because, sooner or later, you have to stand for something besides self-destruction. Alex Cox takes the whole punk premise of the 1980's and explores it thoroughly.

The movie clearly places itself in the sci-fi genre with its plot about dead aliens in the trunk of a mad scientist's Chevy Malibu. If this sci-fi subplot seems unrelated to the rest of the movie, that's the point. Government agents are obsessed with weapons of mass destruction and alien invasion, but oblivious to the poverty and anarchy of our inner cities.

Repo Man's greatest debt, however,  is to the American Western. Southern LA has never looked more like the Wild West than it does here. Cox's point is that LA has become a No-Man's land, a place where laws and rules have been suspended. Repo men repossess cars even though they admit they're just stealing cars back from people who never owned them in the first place. People expect money without earning it, and in once case Emilio Estevez unwittingly throws thousands of dollars out the window of a moving car. God only knows where the money came from! Nobody seems to care and that's Cox's point. Currency has lost all of its currency in this punk wasteland.

Like a good punk, however, Cox turns his irony back on himself and for the most part cleverly avoids identifying with any one character for very long. Emilio and his buddies and associates slowly realize that we all have to stand for something in life. Hence some of the philosophizing at the end of the movie about how white suburbanites can't take the punk attitude that they're just products of society. The punk lifestyle itself is just as much of a posture as any other and card-carrying punks make choices in life like anybody else.

Miller (Tracey Walter) escapes at the end because he's the only character in the movie who dreams large no matter how out of place or ridiculous his dreams make him. You might say he's the biggest and baddest punk in the movie because he follows his dreams without drawing attention to himself. As for Estevez, I'm guessing Cox is saying that, near the end, he takes some of Miller's talk seriously. That's why he gets to leave Earth, too.

On a personal note, my grandfather was a repo man back in the 1930's. I never heard any stories to match this movie, but he did tell me that he and his associates found a corpse in the back seat of a car they repossessed. He also told me that a farmer escorted him and one of his associates off his property at gun point. So I guess Repo Man is accurate to some degree.

I rented the DVD from Netflix last week. The same DVD that can be had considerably cheaper than this Criterion Bluray. I have a pretty decent system and comparing both of these version (DVD & Bluray). The DVD picture may be slightly inferior, but it not night & day worse, and plenty good enough to not be distracting or impede your enjoyment of the film, this Bluray version is nothing to write home about. Also the DVD had 2.0 & 5.1 tracks that sound pretty good. The Criterion Bluray only has Linear PCM friggin MONO and it sounds like crap to me. Neither DVD or Bluray is going to wow you audio wise.

The bonus features on the Criterion, I watched them all. Personally the only things worth watching we're the Iggy Pop and Harry-Dean Stanton interviews, especially the latter and that is available for free on YouTube, the Iggy probably is too. My pkg came dented up as well which happens every time I get free prime shipping for a single movie that arrives in a padded envelope. Just kinda added to the ""I got taken"" vibe. But don't worry Amazon I still love U!

The movie is entertaining and worthy of adding to your collection for subsequent viewing, but I'm going thumbs down on the Criterion Bluray unless it's like your fav movie in life. The DVD stands toe to toe with it for considerably less money and better audio options IMHO. I tried the Bluray in several modes on my Yamaha receiver including a mode just for Mono movies and it was crap I'm sorry to say the DVD 5.1 track played straight was as good if not better.

In fact, I'm going to purchase the DVD now and if need be, will revise this review. I only have a couple other criterions, The Blob, and Gojira and the Blob was fantastic quality audio and video. The Gojira was kinda lacking to what I had hoped for owning various other versions. I'm going to be disappointed with about 1 more Criterion and I'm done with them.",1436745600,5,2040,4.403183023872679

I like the energy, and the actors seem to be having lots of fun with their roles, and it's always a pleasure to see Harry Dean Stanton, but the whole thing just seemed a bit dated to me now, and if punk meant more to me, I might not feel that way.  A few years later, ""Back to the Future"" blended science-fiction, cars, and satire more effectively, I thought, although visually one has to say that North and his cinematographers give a very distinctive look to this one.  The rival repo-men, the Rodriguez brothers, were funny, and I was reminded of the dueling ice-cream businesses in Bill Forsyth's ""Comfort and Joy,"" a movie that did for the darker reaches of Glasgow what ""Repo Man"" does for the less salubrious parts of Los Angeles, but the scenes with the three punk criminal gang get maybe too silly -- the ""society is to blame"" death scene of one of the punks is just too obvious to be funny, and the satire aimed through the parents of Otto (Emilio Estevez), who have become addicted to tele-evangelism, seems pretty broad today.  I watched it with amused detachment, which perhaps was as much a reflection of its stylistic self-consciousness as of my being the wrong age.  At just over 90 minutes, however, it's not too long, and the Criterion presentation and extras have considerable historical and cultural interest.

217300,4,6300183416,"One would never think to tie Tarantino and Napoleon Dynamite, but this movie is that weird, and seemingly that influential.

The production values are low, often with the feel of the Blaxploitation films that preceded it, but with a punk look, vibe, and soundtrack. The acting is good enough but as though purposely kept at the edge of superficiality in keeping with the ironic stance. A fair amount of bloody violence, but nothing is very serious, people may or may not die from prodigious wounds, parodying some Hollywood conventions. Things that had obsessed the disaffected of an earlier generation, capitalism and the bomb, are lampooned here as though the movie was made by an old hippie, though director Alex Cox was a little young for that. Religion is the other primary target. All the satire, while over the top, is relatively gentle.

Less intense and lighter in its comedy than Tarantino, but with some of the meandering deeply pointless dialogue. The absurdist, ironic sensibility of Napoleon Dynamite is there, but less thick and cloying. That's true whether you accept the theory that the character Napoleon Dynamite was based on the character Kevin in this movie or not. Director Cox believes it was, and it's easy to see the similarity.

The ""missing scenes"" feature included in the Collector's Edition DVD is actually a fittingly bizarre mix of extra scenes and a sort of film-within-a-film discussion led by Cox, with Sam Cohen, real-life inventor of the neutron bomb, and the fictional character who invented it in the film (played by Fox Harris, who apparently based his persona on Dennis Hopper, who turned down the role played by Harry Dean Stanton). Cohen is earnest and affable about the bomb and violence in general. Seeing and hearing Cox, himself a character with a distinct flavor, somehow helps put the movie in a more comprehensible frame.",1413331200,,1870,5.006430868167203

217302,4,6300183416,"It's hard to believe that ""Repo Man"" came out 30 years ago. Set in the working-class urban punk rock utopia of mid-1980s LA, the film achieves a balance between gritty realism and over-the-top looniness. The white ""plain wrap"" products with the blue stripe (""FOOD"") might be unfamiliar to younger people who are used to much better marketed, modern store brands, like Whole Foods' ""345"" or Kroger's ""Private Selection"" - and who does the store brand for ""Publix,"" anyway? Most of them are more appealing than the name brands. I only wish the filmmakers had taken the trouble to create generic alcohol for the liquor store scenes (imagine shelves of white bottles with blue stripes, reading ""WHISKEY,"" ""GIN,"" ""VODKA,"" and ""BOOZE"").

Other great details are the pine tree air fresheners in every car, and even on a motorcycle (disclaimer: I hate pine tree air fresheners), the parents getting stoned while watching the televangelist they just donated their son's college fund to, the repo man ""code"" that is lifted almost verbatim from Isaac Asimov's first law of robotics (""A robot shall not harm a human being, or through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm"" - replace ""robot"" with ""repo man"" and ""human being"" with ""car""), and the strong resemblance to Isaac Asimov of the scientist driving the Malibu with the aliens in the trunk.

And of course their is a boat-load of special features(commentaries, deleted scenes, featurettes, etc.) that give further insight into this odd-ball movie.

How something this odd and fun could get made and then how it tapped so powerfully into the counter-culture undercurrents of the Reagan era is a great story. The multitudinous bonus features on the disc did a great job of telling this story. Criterion even includes the entire T.V. cut of the film (in VHS resolution), so you can appreciate it how many fans first experienced the movie.

The disc is worth it alone for the interview with actor Harry Dean Stanton, whose professed approach to life and acting is something akin to performance art.

This REPO MAN disc makes an excellent companion to Criterion's recent KISS ME DEADLY release, which features a video appreciation by co-writer and director Alex Cox. If you've seen that film, you'll see the profound influence it had on REPO MAN.

217389,3,6300183416,"(This review is for the 2 Disc DVD version of the Criterion Collection Release in 2013)

What can you say about ""Repo Man"" that hasn't already been said?  A fantastic, low budget film that really touched a nerve back in the mid-1980's by capturing the essential spirit of L.A. Punk Culture in the process of evolution under the Regan administration.

That being said, ""Repo Man"" is one of those disconcerting titles that I can never quite pin-down to a definitive version.  Correct me if I am wrong, but this version appears to muddy the waters even further by reverting the film to a sort of ""director's cut"" as envisioned by Cox AFTER the fact.

(other postings detail these differences, so I won't go into them here again)

I know my dissatisfaction is clouded by my NOT seeing the original theatrical release, but then again, I'd guess most people did not and this is not the film I so fondly remember.  Anyone actually know how many variants are out there?  I don't, but I guess my appreciation was initially founded on one of the variants that was re-mastered for a subsequent DVD or TV release, and not on this version.

That being said, I DID enjoy this version, but was vaguely dissatisfied anyway.

My biggest irritant was that I was constantly distracted by the color grading of this version.  The black levels are far too crushed in many important night scenes, leaving me struggling to explain to first time viewers important visual clues that are buried in the murk;  details that are important to the stream of gags running throughout the film.

I wonder if this has to do with colorist grading strictly for a theatrical release and not a home video release?  Maybe I'm wrong, but regardless, I feel the whites are slightly muddy, the midtones are constricted to a higher than normal range and the blacks are severely crushed.  Perhaps I am spoiled by true film that has super whites and still can retain shadow detail without having milky blacks, but I don't remember this problem in previous video releases...

This version gives me the weird impression of high contrast as viewed through a slightly dirty window.

IMHO, This release will have everyone scrambling for the contrast and brightness controls on their display, hoping to eek more details out of the shadows and restore the highlights to something other than tepid, clipped textures.

Too bad.  The grading, in light of Alex Cox's participation, appears to be an obvious attempt to correct some stylistic compromise forced upon him in the past, but sadly, it only serves to diminish the impact of the film by obfuscating the details that made it such a vibrant, funny film in the first place.

I hope the BluRay looks better.",1381449600,3,2703,4.7720430107526886

217391,5,6300183416,"One of my all-time favorite movies since I was a kid, so I may be biased, but Repo Man is one of the greatest American satires of all time! I must have seen this golden B-movie over a hundred times (literally!) and I STILL find new things in it almost every viewing. Every scene is packed with layers and layers of background audio and subtle little sight gags, the soundtrack is great, and I have no doubt that Emilio Estevez has never topped this performance. Despite the seemingly-inane storyline, the whole film is arguably about the futility of American life, told from within the obliviousness to the futility with such style and sharpness that any viewer paying attention can't help but laugh out loud. An absolute classic, wrought with philosophical dissections of everything from Christianity to UFOs, from torture, to plates of shrimp, to the consequences of folding or not folding one's pants, Repo Man really does have something in it for (or about) everyone (watch for the lounge-punk cameo appearance of the Circle Jerks!

The opening scenes are perfection: menace drifts down forlorn western highways in a 1964 Chevrolet Malibu, from Los Alamos National Laboratory, along New Mexico's evil Route 666, to Los Angeles, California. In the Chevy's trunk, Dr. J. Frank Parnell has stashed stolen space-aliens, who are emitting toxic radiation. After a curious cop looks inside the trunk, the space-creatures irradiate him. The Chevy departs; on the highway, all that remains of the unfortunate fellow are his boots, wafting smoke.

There's an anti-greed element: generic brands dominate, while Repo Men deal in the messy aftermath of acquisitiveness. Our hero, Otto Maddox (Emilio Estevez is perfectly deadpan) returns to his dismal home, to eat out of a generic can marked ""FOOD."" His mother tells him to put the glop on a plate so he'll, ""enjoy it more."" His stoned couch-parents are transfixed by a T.V. evangelist to whom they donated all their money. Otto is drifting, hopeless, another bit of human flotsam & jetsam washed up on the outskirts of LA, whose shining skyscrapers loom on the distant horizon. Fired as a stock clerk from a supermarket, he winds up helping Bud (the great Harry Dean Stanton) collect a car, and his life is reinvented by the excitement of car chases in LA's surreal storm drains, drugs, and decent commissions.

Meanwhile, the Chevy Malibu has arrived from New Mexico, with dead but dangerous space-aliens rolling around in its trunk. Leila (Olivia Barash), Otto's casual go-to-girl, worries that the aliens will turn into ""mush."" He drops her off at her job at the aptly named United Fruitcake Outlet. Although skeptical, Otto sees a $20,000 reward offered for repossession of the Chevy Malibu. He and his rivals, the brothers Lagarto and Napoleon ""Napo"" Rodriguez (Del Zamora and Eddie Velez), are pursued by secret government agents while they search for the rogue Malibu. Jimmy Buffet plays one of the Rep Wives. In quiet moments, Otto confers with the repo-junkyard guy Miller (the wryly evocative Tracey Walter), throwing a copy of ""Dioretix"" onto burning garbage. Like Bud, Miller shares wisdom with young Otto, describing the confluence of Cosmic Unconsciousness, the Bermuda Triangle, UFOs, abducted humans, Flying Saucers, and Time Machines. Miller says he only rides the bus, and doesn't want to learn to drive, declaring, ""The more you drive, the less intelligent you are.""

Bud is wounded in a Sam Peckinpah spoof, and placed in a hospital whose intercom system blares, ""Mr. Lee, Mr. Lee, please return the scalpel."" He absconds with the toxic Chevy, while ice-cubes rain from the sky, driving it back to the repo car-lot. Government agents are flung back from the car, while it flares green and sparks with electricity. But Miller simply walks up to the car, and says he is going for ""a little spin."" Otto replies, ""But you don't know how to drive!"" Miller beckons Otto to join in in a joy-ride, and the car allows Otto in. The car rises from the ground, zooms hilariously back and forth over LA. Otto exclaims, ""Whoa, this is intense."" Then the luminescent Chevy accelerates, flying to the stars... Enjoy!",1376006400,9,3818,5.556701030927835

217431,4,6300183416,"This review is specifically for the Criterion blu-ray, not the movie itself (which is excellent, nuff said).

I believe I first saw Repo Man on closed circuit television in the midwest -- closed circuit being the predecessor to cable television, at least where I was from.  Because of this -- I remember parts of Repo Man that I haven't actually seen in years.  When I bought the Collector's Edition dvd -- the one in the license plate tin -- those scenes weren't there either, so hey, maybe it was all a dream.

No, plate of shrimp, it wasn't a dream. The Lorna Doone discussion was cut as well as several other scenes. They appear in the deleted scenes section of this release. This Criterion blu-ray is wholly approved by Cox, so, it's not like anyone pulled a fast one on him. Heck, he guides the audience through the deleted scenes. Here we have a George Lucas scenario; do we respect the artist's vision, or do we cry like babies because we're not seeing the exact version we remember?

For me, that's a tough call to make. As an artist myself I reserve the final word on what I create. If Alex Cox were into pandering to the demands of viewers -- Repo Man would never have been made in the first place. I want to respect his vision, but frankly, I want it both ways. They include the modified-for-television version on this disc, why not an uncut version?

If memory serves me -- a deluxe edition of Apocalypse Now includes a smattering of deleted scenes. You can watch these individually, or you can tick an option to watch the entire film, deleted scenes included. The quality suffers momentarily with some of these scenes -- but it's worth viewing in this way.

So, that's why I'm giving this only four stars -- because it could have been just that much better. But, my complaints are minor overall.  They did a great job on restoration, the sound is great -- the packaging is lovely -- the interviews are good.  This is a nice, solid reissue. It's totally worth owning.

By any current sense of screenwriting it is muddled and unfocused. There are two storylines which have nothing to do with each other and only come together in a rather ho-hum way. The dialog is flat, none of the characters are compelling or sympathetic. I really wish I could point to just one thing and be like if you fixes that the movie would work, but it's a whole package.

I grew up with a copy recorded on VHS off of the TV, and we have never been able to watch the original without thinking back to the TV version with the use of ""FLIP YOU"" instead of using different four-letter word. The additional absurdity and comedic value added by the use of ""FLIP"" in the edited version can't be overlooked.

I was THRILLED to get a version of the edited movie on a disc and even more thrilled to know my brother and I weren't odd balls with found recollections of the edited version but in fact we were in the majority in understanding the brilliance of the edited (perhaps superior?) version!

217471,4,6300183416,"Repo Man is an adrenaline-high trip that can best be described as an existentialist, sci-fi noir comedy. It was also a studio (!) movie.

The premise is insane: it's the story of a young punk in a slummy part of LA who gets a job as a repo man, who quickly gets himself wound up in a plot about alien invasion and the threat of nuclear warfare (and tons of fun Kiss Me, Deadly references). The movie works because it takes an out-of-control plot and plays it for laughs. The storyline is ridiculous, and the characters treat it as such, either reacting with skepticism or fitting the caricature perfectly and fitting into the logic of the story.

In addition to all the crazy going on, there is also a complex and intelligent world created by director Alex Cox. We meet characters from all over Los Angeles, from a grungy house of punks to middle-aged losers to Mexican gangsters. It's ""slice of life"" without feeling like it. We encounter these characters organically, as everyone has something at stake in this nutso plot.

Within this vision of LA, we also get some heavy existentialist themes. We quickly get the sense that, in this universe, everything and everyone has a sense of order, which is explained in a great monologue by Harry Dean Stanton's character Bud, in what he calls the ""repo code."" Even in a business which is questionable (and elevates the film to what might be an allegory on the fluidity and arbitrary nature of property rights?), the characters find logic in that which they create for themselves.

I don't know if the movie quite grazes the level of greatness, but it is probably film at some of its most fun and eye-popping. It's definitely better than your standard popcorn flick and actually gives audiences an intelligent yet entertaining experience. Few films are as kinetic as Repo Man and it is easy to see why it has become a cult classic.",1369440000,2,1876,4.675757575757576

217486,5,6300183416,"I have always been fascinated by this film, it is truly a masterpiece of original film making in this country that I think is long gone and will never happen again. I have owned the vhs copy for years and it recently stopped working, so I started  checking amazon and saw that they just came out with the blu ray criterion collection and I bought it right then and there. The cover of this movie will get you to buy it just looking at it, and I was even more mesmorized when I looked at it in person. Someone took some time and effort to develop the art on this jacket and the booklet it comes withbecause their just amazing to look at.
 The movie is mastered in 2k and the resolution of the picture is amazing, really crystal clear, so clear I had to get some windex and clean the little bit of dust I saw on the tv screen, it was that clear. This blu ray has alot of special features, mostly with alot of the actors from the film doing commentary and a couple of segments of how they got casted for the movie which was interesting.  The only actor I didn't see or hear on the speacial features section was Emilio ""Auto"" who is MIA somewhere, who knows. I haven't seen or heard a peep from Emilio in years, he should of at least made an attempt to reunite with the cast or something. The disc also has the tv version of the film if your a little offended by the language in the movie, or were used to seeing it on tv back in the day. Audio commentary is good, I enjoyed hearing some of the actors imputs on scenes throughout the movie. There is a real interesting sit down talk with Harry Dean Stanton which was really inspiring to here his input on consiousness and how everything is predestined. Harry is such a cool classy actor you don't see any actors like him anymore, there all a bunch of pretty boys who can't act worth you know what.

I was 20 when this came out, saw it about 5 times at the Beverly Center Cineplex in West Hollywood in a small little theatre in 1984. what a fantastic gem of American Independent Filmmaking.  This film is so entertaining, and watchable, you can easily see it 10 times or more. Alex Cox did such a great job on this picture, it definitly inspired me to go to film school.  What Hollywood puts out today, spending 300 million on something shallow, horrible, can't touch Cox's ""Repo Man"".  Wonderful hi-tech visuals, but not overdone, campy in a good way, ascerbic, brilliant.",1366934400,4,611,4.79047619047619
217490,3,6300183416,"The 3 star rating is not for the film as such. Unfortunately there are at least two scenes missing form the Criterion release. First is the amazing exchange between Zander Schloss and Fox Harris wherein Harris extolls the restorative effects of vending machine food. ""Lorna Doones? I love Lorna Doones!"" - Gone.

Far more important to the development of the film's climatic scenes is the Big Party at Miller's. Everything that follows is dependent on the party. Without it the film veers toward the incomprehensible.

There is a note in the package that Alex Cox approved this version. I'm clueless why. In fairness the package has a lot of extras: commentaries, deleted scenes, interviews, and so forth. But it doesn't make up for an incomplete presentation of the movie. Also I did not finish the deleted scenes. Perhaps they're buried there. (Interesting note: Cox presents the deleted scenes to the inventor(?) of the neutron bomb. We're in his living room with him watching the out-takes.)

As to ""Repo Man"" itself...the movie is iconic. It's brilliantly funny and captures a sense of time and place like few others. This will sound strange, but I compare it to ""A Hard Day's Night"". Both seemed like ephemeral moments of pop culture at the time, yet, decades later, both stand on their own. Repo Man is probably the best evocation of the Reagan era on film that we've got.

217491,5,6300183416,"This is a great film that captures an era and its strange ethos nearly perfectly. Its funny, its weird and its often very oddly philosphical. A kid (Estevez) falls in with Repo Men. The Repo men operating each with self-defined code of honor in a business where they are essentially being paid to be car thieves. The film is often a study in the philosophy of contradictions. Its in the small details that the film really shines. From the repo wives to the bland government agents to the hippie nouveau conservative parents. It pokes fun at all sorts of things and often makes the points that can't usually be made.

The greatness in the film is in the subtile points it makes. The plot (which dominates the later part of the film) is not very interesting. Its all the individual characters, their philosophy of life and the contradictions of living in that era that makes the film interesting.

The casting is excellent. Harry Dean Stanton steals the show playing what the extras call a skeleton cowboy. He captures the archtype in that era of a person who talked & appeared one way while being something totally different. Then there is the girl (Leila) who seamlessly moves from conspiracy freak to government torturer without even a second thought. The gutless surburban punks out robbing stores and so many, many more. Then there is ""Miller"" out in the parking lot who parcels out a philosophy that sounds serious but is completely insane. There is also the running joke with the generic products which turns product placement on ite head.

Criterion did a very, very fine job with the extras. Much of the content is by the director Alex Cox himself. He goes over the story of the how the film came to be, shows off some of the pitch and production materials and has one of the real repo men he worked with talk about the reality that inspired the fiction.

The transfer and the blu-ray release are (as usual) up to the normal crierion standards. The film has never looked or sounded so good. It really great that this film received this sort of blu-ray release. As the extras point out, its one of those films that by the rules should never have been made, never had the cast it did, never had a large budget and never turned out as good as it did.",1366329600,3,2254,4.571782178217822
217492,4,6300183416,"Let me start by talking about my first encounter with ""Repo Man"". It was late on a friday night. I was 10 years old and decided to stay up late and watch TV on my black and white 13"" Zenith television that I had in my room. I had trouble getting any stations in on my rabbit ears since it was pouring down rain outside, so I kept flipping and adjusting until I was able to finally get something that came in clear. It was the late night movie on my local CBS affiliate, WLKY32. It was ""Repo Man"". I had missed the first 15 minutes or so, but I was able to catch up pretty quickly. I sat and watched the rest of the movie before falling asleep shortly thereafter. Man, those were the days. Watching TV was a challenge, but it was rewarding when you were able to get something to come in clear and I was able to watch the movie with a minimum of fuzz.

Repo Man has since become an essential movie on my 1980's ""must watch"" cinema list. A literal snapshot of the early 1980's L.A. punk scene, it is a bizarre mix of comedy, action, sci-fi, social satire, and general overall weirdness. The synopsis has been beat to death already, but a short description of the plot would be Otto (Emilio Estevez), an L.A. street punk, gets a job as a Repo Man and weird stuff happens. There's aliens, UFO conspiracy theorists, guns, strange characters, mysterious briefcases, a glowing 64' Chevy Malibu, the wisdom of the Cosmos as delivered by grounds worker 'Miller' (Tracey Walter), and an amazingly bizarre performance by Harry Dean Stanton as Otto's mentor 'Bud'. This film is the cult classic to rule all other cult classics! It is a film that has risen to levels of infamy not possible for a film that was a box office success. A box office flop, ""Repo Man"" became a sensation early on VHS and is now available on a Criterion Collection DVD and Blu Ray, the picture has been remastered and looks great on Blu Ray. The Criterion Collection DVD/Blu Ray is chock full of extras including the ""Cleaned Up"" TV version of the film put together by director Cox. Definitely worth adding this to your personal film archives.

In short - if you haven't seen it, then see it. If you have, then see it again.",1366243200,6,2186,4.395061728395062

217510,5,6300183416,"Nothing makes the passing of time more clear than realizing that I saw this movie in the theater over 25 year ago.  There are few movies that define a moment in time in a way that cannot be truly replicated as time goes by.  The Exorcist is still a creepy and somewhat scary movie when watched today; the lines of people around the block were just blown away because it was previously unimaginable to see the horror depicted in the movie in the face of a young girl.  The Matrix is a cool videogame action movie; at the time it seemed like you were watching high definition for the first time.  Or for that matter, watching high definition for the first time.  You could not imagine that colors were that vivid or that there was so much resolution on a flower.  Today, I skip over non-high def channels like they are old VHS movies.  Repo Man is the same thing.

It was not the first nihilistic movie, nor was it the first movie to go off in unexpected tangents that were never explained.  There were other movies that attempted to capture the ""punk"" movement, but they always felt like outsiders showing pictures of funny people.  Less esoteric, when I walked out of the theater back in 1986, the entire audience realized that it had just seen something genuinely new and amazing.  Other detailed reviews go through the scenes better than I could, but I still visually see ""Beer"" and ""Beans"" when I'm in the supermarket looking at store brands.  Watching a young Emilio Esteves before he became a young gun, or became a household breakfast clubber, is amazing.  It's like watching older movies and seeing a current star in a role before the were household names.

Forget all of this.  It's just a freaking cool movie that nails the mid 80's in a way that no other movie can.  You can probably trace hundreds of defining movies back to this single film.  It's like the old saying that the Velvet Underground sold 1000 records and everyone who bought one formed a band.

His chief trainer and mentor, played by Harry Dean Stanton, shows him how it's done.  After a particularly wild scene, Otto says ""This is intense!"" to which the older man replies ""Repo Man's always intense"".  That sums up this film.

Repo Man's action, pacing, and narrative style will keep you on edge from beginning to end.  Devoid of cinematic cliches, it is strange and unpredictable.  Nothing about it is dull or formulaic.  And to top it all off, the Repo Men are asked to recover a mysterious Chevy Malibu which is worth some HUGE amount of money.  No one knows the story behind it, except some shadowy government agents.

Repo Man was a landmark in the history of independent cinema, produced by former Monkee Michael Nesmith.  And it's become a cult favorite, with all the traits of a true indie film.",1264982400,4,938,4.80625

217568,5,6300183416,"The only things I can compare Repo Man to are ""Naked Lunch"" by William S. Burroughs, ""White Noise"" by Don Delillo and ""Atomised"" by Michel Houellebecq. It is a dark satire of modern society that shows us characters who are archetypal punks: aware of the total lack of inherent meaning to life (nihilism), caught in a society that's obviously in decay, they try to navigate past the hypocrisy, stupidity, corruption and lies to find a life they can admire themselves for.

Into this framework, director Alex Cox drops unlikely anti-heroes: Repo men re-possess the cars of the presumably innocent, but they also have a code. And they seem to be living for something. Yet even they get caught up in the tangled web of ego (there's a slight Buddhist perspective to this film) and dragged down, but some find a way to thrive, usually by throwing away all of the things that society would respect them for.

If you want a movie about a Nietzschean undergang, this is it: pure nihilism that strips away the illusions of modern society and replaces them with a gritty struggle for survival. It does so with one of the most offbeat dry senses of humor ever seen on film, with not only nothing sacred, but the formerly sacred sought for mockery. This film also has an uncanny insightful eye into the excesses of the 1980s and the obvious hollowness of the institutions and idols we considered important as a culture back then.

As if that weren't enough, it's also a ripping storyline that takes us through the underbelly of a modern city in pursuit of a modern holy grail. While many of these characters are punks, a good many others could have walked in off the street and we would have believed them, but when presented in the ludicrous context of this movie, they stand revealed as the larger-than-life illusions that they are. Do you like seeing people ignore society's reality in order to struggle for a goal? And in doing so, to go everywhere their parents warned them not to go? This is the movie for you.

It's only fair to mention that even if you don't like punk music, the soundtrack to this movie covers all of your bases. Suicidal Tendencies, Black Flag, Iggy Pop, The Circle Jerks and associated punk classics, as well as atmospheric instrumentals from The Plugz (an ad hoc band of former punk celebrities) really guide this movie by tuning us to the source of its characters' discontent. If you like postmodern fiction, particularly from the Burroughs-Delillo-Pynchon nexus, and just like a good ripping movie, Repo Man is where it's at.",1262563200,3,2543,4.733634311512415

If you're some kind of academic elitist I guess this flick is for you.  Everybody else feel free to scratch your head at this aloof offering from wildly overrated director Alex Cox.  The most appealing aspect here is the performance of Harry Dean Stanton as the hangdog repo-man.  Emilio Estevez, on the other hand, graduated to the Brat Pack pergatory that he deserved.

""Repo Man"" has all these things and more. Ah, so many laugh out loud moments.
""Repo Man"" is an example of why I feel American films constitute the majority of the greatest films made. Yes, director Alex Cox is British and, btw, he sites Luis Bunuel and Akira Kurosawa as influences. I highly respect these filmmakers (how much have they left their mark here?). But like so many of my favorite films ""Repo Man"" could only been made here in America. It especially captures the time it was made and place it's set. It's a creation of the 1980s with this music and with this slew of characters that all inhabit a plot which perhaps only somehow makes sense on an American cultural level. The story has gotta do with a missing 1964 Chevrolet Malibu and the mysteries of the universe. And... and well just see the movie. What like a 90% chance you have and that's why your here. We're fans. If not set in L.A. or in the 80s, you have a different film. The whole weird blend forms something greater than the sum of it's parts. ""Repo Man"", now an influential classic, was low budget and a cult film, but this makes it no less a masterpiece and deserving of a place of honor in the annals of film history.

Harry Dean Stanton gives one of his most compelling performances, as the Repo Man mentor to Emilio, even though Harry Dean and director Alex Cox did not get along during the Repo Man shoot. Great and I mean great, performances from Sy Richardson as another repo mentor, Tracy Walter as the ethereal junk man of the repo yard, the lovely Vonetta McGee as their secretary, Tom Finnegan as the repo boss and a particularly fine turn of performances by Del Zamora and Eddie Velez as the notorious Rodriguez Brothers.

217590,5,6300183416,"Whitout a trace of a doubt, this movie is the very synonym of what a cult  film is meant  to be, in every single possible aspect that can be analysed on the mad lab of filmic culture, a larger than life experience about the most true and substancial feelings, atmospheres and aesthetics, fibers and existential layers required for a cinematic work to be considered a cult icon. ""Repo Man"" is the flag, the standard of the underground, B-style, drive-in cult films of all times. If there's an encyclopedia of cult films, this stunning on-the-edge work of art, spawned from the rotten entrails of the mid 80's pop culture, car repossessions, radioactive alien conspiracies and government chases, punk rock mayhem, and cynical goofy revisions of  american society values of an infamous decisive decade, must be on the cover with golden frames written with large gothic imprints. To describe this passionate and iluminated milestone of the B-movies country is just as hard as it is breathtaking, the experience provided can't possibly be told in simple words. Not because we are facing an astonishing description of life on the streets combined with notorious wicked-fun and bizarre fiction, but because our very world is absorbed by the truth implied in this 94 minutes hilarious evaluation of  the human  struggle to overcome the economic and moral concepts of poverty, in a society dominated by TV ideals, learnings, and stereotypes of happiness and golds in life.

Alex Cox's directional debut must be the most entertaining synthesis of cheap science fiction, suburban punk rock culture, and teenage dissapointment ever portrayed on  film. The targets chosen for this awesome satiric tale of  humurous profanity, conspiracy and post-modern deception, are the generic food and consumers products industry, UFO and pseudo-religion cults, the automobile worship and the human angst from the very bottom of the social scale, all combined in the most wicked, amusing and lovable critics to mid 80's monopoly of materialism.

This affectionate sci-fi comedy-parody leads us to the life of suburban slacker Otto (Emilio Estevez's fresh, warm but cyinic agressive charm, stealing every scene), a misfit punk rocker who've just lost his job and girlfriend, and meets Bud (Harry Dean Stanton, in a superb laid-back but intense performance) just to end up being envolved in the underground car repossession bussiness. When a reward of $20.000 comes along for a 1964 Chevy Malibu, a car obviously over-priced and driven by a lobotomy freak scientist who keeps a very glowing and deadly  secret in the trunk, Otto jumps into one of the most bizarre and unbeliavable adventures a simple kid can get: a surreal, in-tune, modern-noir atmospheric tale of chases, incongruous but intelligent gags fulled of the most memorable dialogues of the pre-Tarantino era, and a truly beatnik-cool style that was the very landmark for other styles to come for the genre.

In a straight competition with these authentic and solid  graphic circumstances, the music score must be heard to be believed: The travesty of distant Spaghetti western stereotypes combined with ferocious punk rock soundtracks by the classic bands ""Fear"", ""The Plugz"", ""Suicidal Tendencies"", and the main theme performed by our dear lunatic Iggy Pop, are the surface, the perfect adjunct for the movie, creating a world that trascends the screen, breaking  into our nerves and consciousness for the ride of our lives. Fasten your seat-belts for this off-screw travel to the other side.

This milestone in grindhouse filmaking is a must see for every movie fan of the cult-film genre, and i dare to admit that it's almost impossible to apreciate the genre itself without admiring this outstanding piece of art. Every minute of this film reflects a phase of what we know, love or consider ""B"" in the cinema industry, in such a quality, rhythm  and balance of diverse recognizable elements, that the very reason why we love to seat in front of a screen to spend our precious beloved time, is fully justified.

In conclusion, an entire chapter in the philosophy book of coolness, one of the ten commandments in the history of B-movie culture, and a classic film of epic proportions. The only way to vindicate your honor for the shame of not knowing this film, is to get it...25 years ago!

For someone to associate this as sexist, cruel, sadistic, unholy, or any other negative societal connotation is certainly understandable. It is probably those things because it was meant to be. I doubt saying Hannibal Lechter was a cannibal would surprise the author or director of ""Silence of the Lambs"". So trying to equate displays of anti-feminist, anti-christian, or anti-social behavior with intelligence is rather moot. The movie is what it is. You will love it or hate it probably.

It has a great group commentary track, a surreal interview, an equally odd review of deleted scenes, and a decent documentary. Yet it's all very sparse in the end. The cover art is a dark and tightly cropped closeup of three characters from the original poster with a new logo. Why did they include Debbi? It would have been nice to add a poster gallery so we could enjoy seeing all the characters and the classic logo. Yet they didn't even include a chapter list insert. Ideally the disc would add the TV version instead of interrupted clips of the deleted scenes, as the foul language replacements were popular even with the director and have an absurd charm all their own. Even an alternate ""censored"" audio track would have been welcome.

217615,4,6300183416,"Otto(Emilio Estevez) is having a rotten day. He's jobless, his girlfriend has taken up with his best friend and his parents have given away the money he planned to use for college to a TV evangelist. Bud (Harry Dean Stanton) a repo man takes a liking to Otto and decides to mentor him as a repo man. When Otto repossesses a car driven by a wacky scientist (Fox Harris) he discovers that his troubles were nothing in comparison; there's something nasty in the trunk that disintegrates whomever opens it ( a homage to the classic noir thriller ""Kiss Me Deadly""). Alex Cox's (""Sid and Nacy"", ""Straight to Hell"") bizarre tough fantasy is clearly informed by the noir graphic novels popular during the 80's with its bizarre characters and conclusion. It's probably the closest we have to a graphic comic novel on film that doesn't dwell on superheroes. Featuring a winning soundtrack of classic punk inspired rock by The Clash, The Pogues and other popular bands of the early 80's, ""Repo Man"" gained cult status very quickly creating a career for talented but iconoclastic Cox. Cox's film reminds me of something David Lynch might have made if his pet obsessions hadn't overwhelmed much of his film work. Oh, look for a cameo by Jimmy Buffett as an FBI agent, director Cox as a carwash attendant and character actor Tracey Walter in a pivotal supporting role. Actor Zander Schloss will be familiar to punk fans as he plays bass for the Circle Jerks. He also appears on the commentary track as well.

This is the third DVD release for ""Repo man"". Flesh tones are natural looking and detail is sharp although there are some minor problems digital blemishes such as edge enhancement. Colors are robust and faithful to the original look of the film when it premiered theatrically. Audio sounds fine with a nice 5.1 mix although you'll notice most of the action is up front with the rear speakers relegated to the music and sound effects. We also get the original 2.0 mono soundtrack.

Universal has chosen to carry over the commentary track done for the superb Anchor Bay release from a couple of years ago. Producer Michael Nesmith (yes, the guy that wore the wool hat in The Monkees and a talented solo artist as well who made a number of fine films), director Cox, casting director Victoria Thomas and character actors Zander Schloss, Del Zamora and Sy Richardson all appear on the commentary track as well providing a balanced, thoughtful and frequently funny discussion on the making of the film. ""Up Close and Personal with Harry Dean Stanton"" is one of the new extras here. An interview with Stanton about his career and why he has made some of the choices he has over the years working in the film business. ""Repossessed"" features Cox with producers Peter McCarthy and Jonathan Wacks discussing the pre-production and shooting challenges they faced in making the film. We also find out about the original ending of the film which is quite a bit different from the final one shot. ""The Missing Scenes"" covers Alex Cox with Sam Cohen discussing and presenting the scenes cut from the film. They also delve into politics and a discussion of the neutron bomb (Cohen evidently came up with the concept for the neutron bomb). The cut scenes don't add anything of importance to the film.

Is this worth a double dip? It depends on how essential this film is to your film collection. The extras amount to almost another feature film when combined. The image quality here is comparable to Anchor Bay's fine edition but that edition only had the commentary track. If you feel you'll spend a lot of time watching the extras here this will be a worthwhile investment. Otherwise you should stick with the previous edition you already have and pick up something else. If you haven't purchase the film before this funny, outlandish fantasy flick (and we're not talking about Kansas, Toto or the Wicked Witch here folks) is definitely worth adding to your collection.

217616,5,6300183416,"I don't know how it occured to Amazon to pair up Repo Man with The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai Across the Eighth Dimension, but Buckaroo Banzai happens to be my favorite movie (seen it twenty plus times), with Repo Man as a close second. Since I often review family-rated movies, I'll say up front that Repo Man is rated ""R"" for sex, violence and language, but unlike many films that throw all those in to get that rating, it actually delivers.

This is the original punk, sci-fi cult classic produced by Michael Nesmith of the Monkees (who has been involved with many other less successful outre projects) and by the same director as Sid and Nancy (about Sex Pistol Sid Vicous (the other punk movie). Repo Man is often dismissed as a film school homework assignment that got out of hand, but things people like in other movies this one has in spades.

For one thing: an incredible cast, especially a young Emilio Estevez. Harry Dean Stanton in his most memorable role (his other cult classic performance is as the preacher in John Huston's film of Flannery O'Connor's college circuit favorite, Wise Blood (when's that going to make it on to DVD?). The so-called bonus features on this budget version seem absolutely random (in keeping with the film's sensibilities), but the earlier version came in a metal box that looked like a license plate and was priced accordingly. Not to mention that from the Iggy Pop theme song on, Repo Man has about the best upbeat punk soundtrack you can get, such that the CD by itself is a real find. So have a TV party tonight with Repo Man and Buckaroo Banzai. Wow. This is really intense.",1138838400,2,1625,4.638888888888889
217648,5,6300183416,"Repo Man originally debuted on DVD thanks to the fine folks at Anchor Bay in a fantastic metal tin package that resembled a license plate and also came with the film's soundtrack album of West Coast punk rock and nice booklet with photos and liner notes. Sadly, this edition has gone out of print and the rights have reverted back to Universal. Fortunately, the studio coordinated this new edition with Cox and he helped assemble some new extras especially for this edition. Is it worth the double dip? I think so.

""Up Close with Harry Dean Stanton"" features the refreshingly candid actor talking about his life and espousing his personal philosophy that kinda fits with the notion of personal codes and ethics in Repo Man. He comes across as a fascinating guy, a true original, in this excellent interview.

""Repossessed"" reunites producers Peter McCarthy and Jonathan Wacks with director Alex Cox and they reminisce about Repo Man. The three men talk about how they got the film financed and tell lots of good anecdotes. One highlight involves Cox telling a funny story about meeting with Stanton's agent to pitch the movie. The director felt that towards the end of shooting the actor was too unpredictable and actually wrote him out of a few scenes. They clearly look back at the experience with fond memories.

Cox takes a look at a collection of ""The Missing Scenes"" with Sam Cohen, the actual inventor of the Neutron Bomb. We get more footage of Duke and his gang, Bud taking a sledgehammer to a faulty pay phone and more of the repo party to name but a few additional scenes.

The one carry-over from the Anchor Bay edition is the excellent audio commentary by Cox, producer Michael Nesmith, casting director Victoria Thomas and actors Sy Richardson, Zander Schloss and Del Zamora. This is clearly a trip down memory lane for all involved as they fondly recall making the movie. Everyone talks about their problems with the studio and tell great stories as they laugh and joke on this thoroughly enjoyable and entertaining track.",1138838400,5,2038,4.830945558739255
217649,4,6300183416,"I saw a version of REPO MAN on television about 20 years ago that contained most of the deleted scenes you can find in the ""Bonus Features"" section of the menu.  The deleted scenes are worked into a 25-minute interview with the inventor of the Neutron Bomb (Sam Cohen), who's a fan of the film.  A lot of those scenes, which I'd seen years ago in a TV version, were quite funny, and I felt something was missing when I watched the main film on the DVD (e.g., the scene where Buddy steals a guy's car after telling him he's required by law to ""wait right here"", the scene where Emilio Estevez's parents have cobwebs growing on them while watching religious TV, the scene where Estevez signs the ""standard contract"", several others).

That said, it's still a great movie.  I didn't find it quite as clever and original as I did two decades ago, but it's certainly worth watching if you've never seen it or only dimly remember it.  Also, there's an excellent 20-minute interview with Harry Dean Stanton.",1138406400,6,1000,4.564245810055866

217651,4,6300183416,"The word of the day is peculiar.

This entire movie is peculiar.  It's classic 80's, with punks, campy special effects, and ridiculous cloths that make you remember what everyone ELSE wore, back then.

The plot is absolutely ludicrous; Emilio Estevez gets fired from his dead-end job at a supermarket and is fooled by Harry Dean Stanton into stealing (repoing) a car.  He then embarks on a life of a repo man, meeting some very odd characters along the way, including their ""rival"" repo men.

When a '64 chevy Malibu comes across the wire with an impressive bounty, it becomes an all out race to see who'll find it first.  Unbeknownst to the repo men, the car is loaded down with alien corpses.

Car chases, secret agents, conspiracies, gunfights, and questions regarding John Wayne's sexuality ensue.

So, enough of the synopsis and on with the review:

Emilio Estevez has always been one of my favorite actors, because he (like his brother Charlie and father Martin) has an amazing range of facial expressions and is a fairly natural actor.  He is young, rough talent in this movie, but he's still pretty good at being the half gritty, angst-ridden, ""lost generation"" quasi-punk.  I'm not the biggest fan of the whole punk movement, and if you absolutely can't stand them, you'd probably better avoid this movie.

The repo men are the kind of guys you'd expect to be seeing doing repo work.  They all give you the impression that they'd be out there, if they weren't acting.  They're all named after beers, which is appropriate, since being severely inebriated would help you understand this movie.

Dennis Hopper is the fruitcake driver of the '65 Malibu, and you get the feeling also that he isn't even acting.  Of course, Dennis Hopper IS a fruitcake, so he may not, in fact, have been acting at all.

Quirks abound - every car has a Christmas Tree air freshener.  Every bit of food or drink is in a plainly labeled tin (beer, food) except for 7-up, which is featured prominently in the supermarket scene and in a background commercial later on.

References to philosophy and revolutionary rhetoric pop up everywhere.

It's hard to even review a movie like this because it's just so damned odd, so here's my final word:

Buy this, if you can get it for cheap.  Spend the rest of your dough on alcohol (even absinth wouldn't be amiss here, if it's legal in your locality).  Wait until late at night, and start the drinking just before you start the movie.  Make sure that you're totally loaded by a 45 minutes in.

Enjoy.

I'm here mainly to make just one point: the voice-over commentary on the DVD is wonderful.  By my calculation, Alex Cox must have been 29 when he finished this one, and if my reading is right, he has never had as big a success since.  Fair enough:  Mascagni spent his whole life trying to top Cavallera Rusticana, and Bizet died without knowing that Carmen was a hit.

But it does mean that Cox and his gang are in an effusive mood when they get together together to relive the old days, like the vets on the History Channel, reliving World War II.  Just as a general rule, I suspect these voice-over more fun with indie flics or somesuch: big, fancy production numbers tend to choke on their own gas, but these guys just get to remember how they were pranksters once, and young.  Indeed, I think this voice-over would be good fun even if you didn't like the movie but, um, yeah, I did think the movie was pretty good, too.",1123632000,4,1113,4.4
217653,2,6300183416,"First off, let me say that I LOVE this movie. There is nothing else out there like it. It is the first movie about Nothing, long before Seinfeld and Napoleon Dynamite came along.

But actually, it's not about Nothing. It's about a quest. A quest to find the Holy Grail of car reposession: A Chevy Malibu.

So why 2 stars? Because this DVD SUCKED, that's why. The widescreen was pretty good, and the audio was okay. But other than that, where were the captions or subtitles? And more importantly, WHERE WERE ALL THE GREAT SCENES I REMEMBERED?

I never saw this in the theater. I grew up watching reruns of it on TBS. I got to hear all the repeats of ""flip you"" and ""melonfarmer"" in all their dubbed glory. When Leila swears at Otto at the end, my memory is her saying, ""You Nerrrrd!"" Not that-other-word.

That's okay. I can deal with more cussing. In fact, I like it. But what makes me want to say ""Flip You"" to the makers of this DVD is that we are missing all these great scenes:

1. The crazy guy in the car babbles on and on to Kevin about various things, including Lorna Doone cookies. Kevin's response is, ""Lorna Doones? I love Lorna Doones!"" From this DVD - GONE!!!

2. Bud gets pissed at a phone booth for no apparent reason and goes and gets a baseball bat or crowbar or something and beats the thing to smithereens. Otto wants to get in on the action, so he picks up the bat and starts doing some smashing of his own, with some nice maniacal laughter. Bud has to make him quit and leave. This scene - GONE!!!

3. Otto goes home again to see his hippy parents. The Good Reverend on TV is going on and on of course. I remember him saying these specific very cool lines, ""Suffer the fires of eternal damnation! Now these are the end times..."" Otto's parents are covered in spider webs. He walks up to the TV and turns it off. They give him a kind of lost look, and he gives them a disgusted look, and finally he just walks out the door with nothing else said. This Nice Scene - GONE!!!

4. Seems like the ""Bad Man"", Lite did a lot more talking on the movie I remember. Seems like he said some stuff about ""break the bone"", like in the song. Where did it show that in this DVD? GONE, that's where!!!

5. There was one scene with the crazy guy in the car where he is talking either to Otto or Kevin, and he runs his fingers through his hair. As he runs his fingers through his hair, a handful of hair falls out. This was really gross but crucial to us fully understanding how far his radiation poisoning had progressed. Where is this scene, I ask you? GONE!!!

6. I'M SURE THERE ARE MORE SCENES, BUT WHERE ARE THEY??? GONE! GONE, I TELL YOU!!!

And why? I wouldn't mind this if this was just a regular DVD, but this supposed to be the ""Special Edition"" DVD! When are you movie execs going to figure out that we consumers don't care about gimmicks like tin-cases shaped like license plates? We want SUBSTANCE, not PACKAGING.

I haven't listened to the commentary track yet, but everybody has good things to say about it so I'll give a star for that at least.

Now, on to the soundtrack. This is a great soundtrack, but it too left me disappointed. I recognized the songs in it, but where was the main Repo Man track? You know which one I mean! I wanted to hear the lonely guitar solo that comes up while Otto walks the streets alone. That awesome track that comes up while the bum is sobbing on the side of the street and Otto just keeps on walking past, ignoring him as just part of the wasteland that is Urban USA. Where was that incredible soul-transcending track by the Plugz? We get a taste of it on the final track, but nothing like the main track. How disappointing.

The bottom line: If you've gotta have Repo Man, it's a good buy. But I'm still holding on to my much-worn VHS recording of the cable version. I suggest you do the same.",1118880000,108,3847,4.266483516483516

Instead, I'll simply observe that it's pretty impressive for a shoestring-budget film with mostly unknown actors except for Stanton and a very young Emilio Estevez.  Much of the movie was shot on location in LA at night or very early in the morning. This gives it a spare, almost surreal quality; a lot of the time you feel like you're watching a bizarre play.

One thing that struck me when I watched it last night -- my third viewing -- was how much the scenes with Otto and the black guy foreshadow the scenes with John Travolta and Samuel Jackson in ""Pulp Fiction.""  I have to believe that Tarantino was influenced by this movie!

Anyhow, it's great entertainment if you don't mind a lot of violence and virtually non-stop swearing. Someone says ""f**k you"" about once per minute on the average.",1103155200,,1036,4.696132596685083

Emilio Estevez plays a young white punk from the suburbs whose existence is almost comical in it's nihilism and aimlessness.  Here we see punk in it's truest form, Estevez raising his middle finger at every opportunity his bizarre life offers him.  Until, that is, Harry Dean Stanton comes along (Estevez's initial is ""F**k you, queer"") and offers him a job as a repo man, the perfect job for Estevez's angry young character.  Estevez yucks it up, snorting crank and driving all night, repossessing cars from the naive

and sometimes simply stealing them.

Meanwhile something cosmic is happening.  A 64 Chevy Malibu that glows in a really hoky neon way is being driven by a strange little man with one eye, constantly spouting metaphysical visions and sweating like a fat pig.  There is a hallmark scene in which Estevez's best friend opens the trunk and is vaporized.  The plot is really indescribable and you have to see it to understand it.

It somehow foreshadowed the nihilistic, sarcastic characteristics of the Nineties, kind of in the same way ""A Clockwork Orange"" did. That's not to say this is some sort of significant social statement--on the contrary, it's nothing more than a very surreal satire of cut-throat urban paranoia that's actually probably more relevant today than when it came out back in 1984. Fans of old-school punk, William S. Burroughs, conspiracy theories, and ""Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas"" will surely fall in love with this one.

 Plot-wise, a heartlessly fascist Harry Dean Stanton recruits young suburban punk Emilio Estevez into repossessing cars for a living. They prowl the concrete jungle for a spell, philosophizing and overcoming various sticky situations, when they are assigned to recover a mysterious Chevy Malibu. The car just so happens to be driven by an insane scientist from Los Alamos Laboratories who's dying from radiation poisoning...and Estevez's 'love interest', Layla, just so happens to be a UFO fanatic determined to expose a government cover-up...and rival repo men, the Rodriguez Bros. are after the same car but Estevez's crusty friends just so happen to steal it and complicate matters...and so on and so forth...hilarity ensues.

 Yeah, in the end it doesn't make a whole lot of sense, but oddly it doesn't really take away any of the enjoyment. In fact, by the time the credits start rolling, you realize that the bizarre, 'transcendental' ending is the only possible way to conclude such a hysterical mess.

After the first viewing, i didn't get a chance to see the movie again until 3 years later when i got a chance to purchase the special edition(before it became an excrutiatingly high price) i picked it up used from the store that i worked at.  My first point is the awesome soundtrack.  I actually purchased the special edition because of the soundtrack and the packaging.

This movie is not for everyone though. Some people may be turned off by the harsh language, themes, and aliens. All three of those made the movie SO much better. The whole alien in the trunk of a car thing was so cool. You never really get to see the aliens kinda like the briefcase in Pulp Fiction. But in this movie you know that it is aliens in the trunk.

The film starts with Otto, a young suburban punk, who getss fired by his boss for repeadily showing up late for work. With nowhere to go, Otto runs into a cop who asks Otto to help him get his wife to the hospital. He is tricked and finds out that he just helped out a whole department of repo men. This leads him on a fast-paced ride.
While Otto travels and learns the ropes from the other repo men, a man in a 1964 Chevy Malibu is the subject of a nationwide search because of what he possesses in his trunk.
With a full cast of interesting characters and an amazing soundtrack from the likes of Fear, Black Flag, and a theme song by Iggy Pop, this film is one of the most interesting films of the 1980s.

217738,5,6300183416,"Alex Cox (Sid & Nancy) made his directorial debut with this bombastic, abrasive, satiric, and highly influential film.  Repo Man tells the story of disgruntled punk rocker Otto (a young Emilio Estevez) who becomes a repo man under the tutilage of veteran repo man Bud (Harry Dean Stanton).  Soon Otto becomes quite good at his job, but a mysterious '64 Chevy Malibu soon becomes sought after by Otto and a some rival repo men when a high priced commission is put on it.  What's in the car's trunk will change everything, and I mean everything.  One of the key films of the 80's, Repo Man is undoubtadly the best piece of work to come from Alex Cox, and even though it may seem chaotic and even a bit incoherent at times, there is an underlining theme to the film that links to the political uneasiness felt during the 80's.  The scorching punk soundtrack features legends like Black Flag, Iggy Pop, and the Suicidal Tendencies; all of which add to the bombastic feel of the film.  Universal's recent re-release of Repo Man surprisingly includes the commentary by Cox and various crew members (which was previously only available on Anchor Bay's Limited Edition release of the film which has been out of print) as well as a trailer.  This is surprising to me considering every one of Universal's recently re-released films like They Live and Prince of Darkness have no extras at all.

Most of the figures in 'Repo Man' are grating, none are memorable. A little of this watchable mess does- granted- go a long way, especially for eighties fringe culture enthusiasts.

217743,4,6300183416,"Repo Man is a twisted movie, which blends social satire, sci-fi, suburban angst and consumerism targets that were prominent in the 1980s, such as TV preachers, people who claimed to see UFOs, and angry punk rockers rebelling against the gamor of the decade. Emilio Estevez plays a nihilistic young male out of a job and practically robbed of a future when his parents, apparently hippies or born-again Christians, give all of his savings away to a TV preacher so they can 'send bibles to El Salvador,' according to the holy mission of this evangelist that appears in the movie often. He meets up w/ Bud, who offers him [money]to move his wife's car out of a 'bad area,' presumably a ghetto. After the chaotic scene, Otto (Estevez's character)knew something was up, and gets dragged into becoming a 'repo man,' a guy that repossesses cars when the owners do not pay their bills.
The company, among other parties, such as eccentric UFO spotters, and the Rodriguez brothers, are after this one car driven by a lobotomized scientist which contains some alien device of some sort in its trunk that disintegrates those who come in cotact with it, such as a highway patroman and one of Otto's punk rock anarchist friends. The movie consists of nothing but chaos throughout the plot in which all the groups invovled try to get hold of this []Chavrolet Malibu, and the ending is rather surprisng, but very cheesy at the same time. The sci-fi effects in this movie are dated, and scream 80s (after all this movie was made in 1984), but its satirical edge and rather cryptic storyline make Repo Man an interesting, but occassionally bewildering film.",1057536000,,1639,4.815602836879433
217744,5,6300183416,"I put this eighties cult classic right up there with Blazing Saddles (1974) and Dr. Stranglove (1964) as one of the best satires ever to hit the silver screen.  No exaggeration: this is one bizarre and one very funny flick.  Seeing it again after almost twenty years, I gotta say, it lost nothing.
Emilio Estevez stars as Otto Maddox, a head-strong and slightly naive ex-supermarket stock clerk and sometime punk rocker.  He's kicking a can down the street when up pulls Bud, ""a repo man,"" played with a fine degeneracy by Harry Dean Stanton, who asks him if he wants to make ten bucks.  (Otto's reply is memorable but not printable here.)  When he learns that Bud just wants him to drive a car and not...uh, never mind, he bargains it to twenty-five bucks.  When he finds out that Bud repossesses cars for the ""Helping Hand Acceptance Corporation,"" he is sorely offended.  But when he realizes how intense the life is (and how bleak his other employment opportunities), he becomes a repo man himself.
Meanwhile there's J. Frank Parnell (Fox Harris wearing a demonic grin and weird glasses with one black and one empty frame) driving a ""hot"" '64 Chevy Malibu.  ""You don't want to look in the trunk, Officer,"" he tells a cop who pulls him over on a desert highway.  By the way, the map under the opening credits shows the action of this film beginning somewhere on old Route 66 in New Mexico, suggesting alien mecca Roswell territory perhaps, but most of scenes were clearly shot in LA, and the desert scene just mentioned was probably also shot in California as evidenced by the Joshua Trees in the background.
What director and scriptster Alex Cox does is combine urban ghetto realism with bizarro sci-fi shtick.  He adds a fine punk soundtrack including the title song from Iggy Pop with a brief appearance by the Circle Jerks, and wow are they appropriate, but you have be a punker or a 15-year-old to really visualize their moniker.  The supporting players, Sy Richardson as Lite, a black cat repo ace, and Tracey Walter as Miller, a demented street philosopher, really stand out.  I also liked the girl repo person with attitude (Vonetta McGee).
The real strength of the movie, aside from probably the best performance of Estevez's career, is in the street scene hijinks, the funny and raunchy dialogue, and all those sight gags.  My favorite scene has Otto coming home to find his parents smoking ... on the couch zombie-like in front of the TV listening to a Christian evangelist while he scarfs down ""Food"" out of a blue and white can from the refrigerator.  I mean ""Food"" is on the label, period.  The Ralphs plain wrap (remember them) are all over the sets, in the convenience store, at the supermarket, bottles of plain wrap whiskey and plain wrap ""Tasteetos,"" plain wrap beer and plain wrap cigarettes.
Some other good shtick: the dead rat thrown in the car with the woman that doesn't accomplish its purpose; the money in the presents that Otto throws out the window busted open by the tires of another car for us to see and drool over; the ""I left a book of matches"" line that diverts Otto's ... friend pumping gas; the pepper spray; Miller by the ashcan fire contemplating the disappeared from the future and ""the lattice of coincidence that lays on top of everything"" (trippy, man); and the punk criminal act of ""Let's go get sushi and not pay.""  And Otto's clean pressed white dress shirt and the tie--I love the tie--as Lite tells him, ""Doing my job, white boy.""
See this for the authentic eighties street scenes and for my UCLA Bruin buddy (by way of Oxford) director Alex Cox who dreamed the whole thing up.  Only an Englishman could really see America authentically.",1051747200,10,3687,4.700310559006211
217745,5,6300183416,"If you're one of those people who look for movies that are more odd than anything else, look no further than Repo Man.  Emilio Estevez is the young punk turned reluctant Repo Man.  That's the simplest part of the story.  From there the movie unfolds sidestepping genre after genre.  Some of the funniest, sharp witted dialogue ever to grace a film script puts the quote factor of this movie into the stratosphere.
""It happens sometimes.  People just explode.  Natural causes.""
Case in point.  Or how about this:
""I do want your money because God wants your money.""
""The more you drive the less intelligent you are.""
""Let's go get sushi and not pay.""
""Did you ever hear of the neutron bomb?""
""Since time is short and you may lie I'm going to have to torture you.""
Bottom line is if you haven't seen this movie make it a point to do so.  Truly a celebration of the indescribable.  Great doesn't do it justice.  Repo Man turns convention on its head and then quickly, repeatedly, kicks it in the face.  We need more movies like this.  And remember:

This should be an interesting and different kind of movie about a repossessing agent but it isn't. I don't like any of the characters except for the lobotomised scientist who is probably the most interesting and mysterious character in this arthouse dog. Unfortunately in a way I own this film on VHS and paid five dollars for it as an ex rental, although I was planning to buy it on DVD and I am glad now that I saw it again on videotape and I am not buying it now. What a waste of money it would be.
This movie is about a car, driven by the lobotomised scientist who as far as I can tell, has radio active aliens in it. Anyone who opens the boot gets zapped out of existence. A police officer did this and only his boots were left. The scientist tries to warn anybody not to open the boot, but do they listen? NO.
This car has a $20,000 repossessing value on it and everybody is after it. Otto played by Emilio Estevez, is after it, his co-worker Harry Dean Stanton is after it, the Rodriguez brothers are after it, including government agents that want to get the valuable cargo. Ridiculously at the climax of the movie, some guy gets in the car, and for some strange reason he is the only one who can because the car is so hot it sets people on fire. And for some reason he knows how to make it fly and it soars over the city rapidly. Oh yeah, it's glowing too.

I haven't watched my old taped from the TV version for some time, but I have the feeling Miller's lines are trimmed a tad also.
However, the film remains unmissable in this widescreen version and the sound is particularly excellent (Iggy Pop's 'Repo Man'  theme has never sounded more exciting). But for those of you used to the far funnier use of 'melonfarmer'...this truncated version might not please the purist, hence my four star rating.",1045267200,2,726,4.854838709677419

217789,5,6300183416,"Repo Man is completely unclassifiable.  Funny, dark, biting, thrilling, confusing, action, adventure, it's all there.  Emilio Estevez plays Otto, a ""white suburban punk"" living in LA's sprawl, with a nowhere job that he loses in the film's second scene.  When his hippie parents admit they sent his college fund to a TV preacher (We're sending Bibles to El Salvador!), Otto meets Bud (Harry Dean Stanton), a cocaine-driven Repo Man who needs an extra driver.  Otto joins the firm and soon learns the Repo Code; Bud's version (You see, a Repo Man gets himself INTO tense situations), and the other regulars at Helping Hand Auto share their philosophies too.  Light finds Bud's view tedious but is willing to handle shoot-outs when he's not reading parodies of Scientology (Diuretix), Miller seems completely neuron-fried (The more you drive, the less intelligent you are), and Oly is along to make a four-pack.  (Did you notice the four experienced Repo Men are named after beers?) Let's go get a drink, kid!
Multiple plot strands at first seem unrelated, but bind together closer and tighter as the film moves along.  Otto and the other Repo Men are on the lookout for a 1964 Chevy Malibu, with a $25,000 bounty.  So are some creepy FBI agents, who stalk and kidnap Otto.  And so are Helping Hand's arch-rivals, who careen into the plot whenever things are getting dull.  The car's  driven by a nuclear physicist in from Los Alamos, who warned a CHP officer not to look in the trunk (with deadly results).  Otto's punk friends find the car while breaking into a pharmaceutical factory, but they're too stupid to keep it.  (These three are some of the dumbest criminals ever shown in film, including Kevin Kline's Otto in _A Fish Called Wanda_)  Otto finds love, after a fashion, but since this is Reaganesque LA, even his girlfriend has her own motives.  (""Otto!  What about our relationship?""  Otto's reply is a brilliant retort to Cary Grant's last line in Gone with the Wind.)
The film abounds with hilarious throw-away lines, signs, and labels.  Several scenes take place in food stores, and all the food is generically labeled.  Multiple viewings are required to catch them all; be sure to read all the signs in the windows.  Even the TV preacher shows up on several television sets.  Repo Man takes its structure from Miller's bizarre rant about the cosmic latticework of interconnectedness, because everything is interconnected, and Miller turns out to be right about all of it by the end.  ""And flying saucers are... You got it.  Time Machines.""
Top it off with a TERRIFIC sound track by Iggy Pop, Black Flag, The Circle Jerks, and a host of others from the punk scene and this is one of the best movies ever made.",1039996800,155,2722,4.818965517241379

This film is not for anyone who does not have a slightly bizarre taste in movies.  However, if you are a fan of cult movies or punk rock than this movie is for you.
  The story has to do with a young ""white suburban punk"" named Otto(Estevez) who loses his job and pretty much everything else.  He gets hired to help a repo man with a repossession and is stuck for life.  The plot gets more complicated when a lobotimized scientist shows up with something in his trunk that everybody seems to want for reasons unknown.
  Some of the highlights are the Circle Jerks cameo as a lounge band (""I can't believe I used to like these guys""), Otto's really stupid punk friends (""Come on let's go commit crimes"" ""Yeah, let's get sushi and not pay""), and the theory of cosmic unconsciousness.
  Punk rock and B-movies are two of the greatest things to ever come out of America ever and this movie captures them perfectly.  This is one cult movie that truly deserves it's following.

And I totally think it was worth the watch. Unfortunatley thought I watched it over the course of a couple days, so my viewing was very chopped up and I actually had to rewind it to catch some things I'd missed when I was drifting off to sleep late at night on my first viewing.
It's campy, and silly, and strange, and very my kind of movie. It's basically a B movie, but a good one. My favorite parts were of course - if you know me - the really random things that happened or that people said. And of course the end was great.

On to the Special Edition Packaging.
The first thing you have to do is LOWER your expectations. It comes in this cheezy metal box, like a holiday cookie tin. The lid has a graphic of a California license plate that says appropriately enough Repo Man, and Oct 2002 where the date goes on a license plate. It is not embossed or anything that might make it cool. The rest of the box is unremarkable. On the unpainted bottom is a sticker saying what number you have in the limited edition. I have 08512/30000, it is just a sticker.
Inside the disapointments continue. The 24 page book is a minimilist tribute to a great film. There is not very much information of interest, and only a few good photos. You don't need these photos if you have movie. Then there is a 5x7"" postcard of the movie poster with chapter info on the back. The dvd and the cd come in 2 disc cd case with no cover. Just a dvd with part of the movie poster silkscreened on it. and the cd with
the 11 original sound track songs on it. Time, >38 minutes. There is no individual packaging for either.
There is nothing in the packaging that makes this special.
The DVD-
The picture quality is excellent. The sound quality is excellent.
There are little to no extras on the disc. This get frustrating as one version of the trailers shows a snippet of a scene where Bud (Harry Dean Stanton) is beating the hell out of some phone boths with a sledgehammer. In another snippet from the same trailer the repo wives look like the may be at the office, or something that is not in the film. Yet, the extras have NO extended scenes or deleted scenes. To make matters worse the commentary discusses a made for t.v. version of the film that was radically different from the version they are talking about. So I keep thinking I want to see these scenes. If they are hidden on the dvd anywhere I cannot find them. I thought a special edition would have more extras.

217848,5,6300183416,"Every decade, there seems to be a movie that defines the angst of the culture and the subculture, the collective feeling that something is wrong with the establishment. To call this zeitgeist is misleading; these films don't reflect the spirit of the times as much as they somehow tap into the opposite - they manage to create an all-around sense of unease about the state of the world. In the 1960s, it was The Graduate and the bombshell look at the end. For the 1990s, Fight Club identified many things wrong both with pop culture and those acting in rebellion against it. For the Reagan-saturated 1980s, the distinction falls squarely on Alex Cox's debut film Repo Man. In one of his first roles, Emilio Estevez plays Otto, a street punk who loses his job and college savings in the same day due to misunderstandings and television preachers. At the end of his rope financially and mentally, he agrees to make a quick 20 bucks by helping experienced repo man Bud (Harry Dean Stanton).  Realizing the potential to make a good living, and an ""intense"" life in his new job, Otto signs up with the crew and becomes a repo man. On the way, he meets an unusual woman (Olivia Barash) whom he rapidly falls in lust with. When word comes down the wire that there's an enormous commission out on a 1964 Chevy Malibu, Otto and all the other repo men set out to look for the car with the huge score. What they find in the trunk is so unusual, it will change everything - EVERYTHING.
What makes Repo Man so unique is the obvious satirization not only of regular, and in this case conservative Reagean-esque, culture, from the ""John Wayne was [gay]"" speech to Bud's trashing of Russia, but the send-ups of punk culture (Let's go do some crimes! Yeah, let's get sushi and not pay!) Otto is the everyman in every sense of the word, as he - like us - realizes that no matter what culture he tries to be a part of, he never fits in, and those strains of culture are so rife with stupidity and hypocrisy that he no longer wants to belong. Like The Graduate and Fight Club, Repo Man also refuses to supply a stock answer, instead making the audience question instead of spoonfeeding them. Plus, it's roll-on-the-floor funny, with some of the best oneliners since Evil Dead 2 or Terminator 2. Alex Cox made Repo Man while still in film school, and he basically admits it's little more than a trumped-up student film. The lack of budget is obvious at times, but the killer screenplay and direction more than make up for that slight fault. As usual, the movie looks excellent on Anchor Bay's DVD; the sound and video are as clear as you can ask for, with a remixed 5.1 audio track to boot. There's a great commentary track with Alex Cox, some castmembers (sadly, no Harry Dean or Emilio), and some crew; it's a lot like a Kevin Smith commentary, with everyone sitting in one room, having a great time talking about a great film. There are no other extras to speak of, unless you buy the collector's tin (which does not look like the normal Repo Man cover - it looks like a California license plate, with Repo Man on it). The collector's tin has the soundtrack on CD and a booklet about the movie with a little comic in it.

217854,4,6300183416,"Alex Cox's feature film debut, ""Repo Man,"" is an incredibly wild exercise in crisscrossing genres.  On one hand, it's the story of a disillusioned young punk (Emilio Estevez) who winds up in the car-repossessing business; on the other hand, it's about aliens from space, weird things in the trunks of cars, Area 51 paranoia, and even consumer disgust.  In a way, its blatant and effortless desire to be different makes it to the 1980s what ""Fight Club"" was to the 90s.
""Repo Man"" manages to be hilarious without resorting to immaturity and truthful without being preachy.  Cox's filmmaking technique is truly guerilla, with a ""pull-out-all-the-stops"" style that pays huge dividens in its charming low-budget way.  The acting is top-notch (Estevez and Harry Dean Stanton are a duo with chemistry to spare), and the many weird events that conspire keep things unpredictable and interesting.
Which brings me to Anchor Bay's limited edition tin.  Being a video company I've known and respected (yes, it sounds lame) for its top-notch remasters of underrated Italian horror/gore films from yesteryear, I was surprised to see them releasing ""Repo Man.""  But I was impressed with the faux-letterbox presentation and the overall package; an amusing booklet with asides from the cast and crew is included, and also the movie's soundtrack (one of the best I've heard).  The extras (talent bios, trailers, etc.) are a bit sparse but still impressive. As of this writing I haven't listened to the audio commentaries, but will in the near future.
Even if you don't have a DVD player, ""Repo Man"" plays out just as well on video.  If you're in the mood for a movie from an era when 'Hollywood' wasn't about turning profits and marketing teens and actually took risks, this is for you.",985564800,8,1769,4.993197278911564

For those of you that can share my fondness for the film  and the memories it evokes, you might also share my disappointment that the  Special Edition - DVD does NOT include the deleted scenes found in the  ""Directors Cut"" of the film.
Thankfully, I still have a VHS  copy of the REPO MAN ""Directors Cut"" that I taped when it was  shown on A&E about 6 years ago.  Still, it saddens me that the Special  Edition - DVD does not contain J. Frank Parnell's hysterical description of  the qualities of vending machine food or the details of the  ""project"" in which he was involved. Also, I must say that  Amazon.com, to some extent, misleads the consumer into thinking that this  is in fact the ""Driector's Cut"" of the film.  You'll see Amazon's  misinformation if you've read through the quotes & trivia section for  REPO MAN. In that section there is a description of a scene where -  ""Bud gives an irate car owner a business card and tells him to call  his boss ""I.G. Farbin"", a reference to Farben, the German company  that produced poison gas during World War II.""

But the `64 chevy malibu content something beyond the wildest dreams and worth a lot more than $20,000 they offer.
The film was instant cult fave to the audiences and critics, who`s have remember the film. The movie has a good story mixing comedy, sci-fi elements and social society life is cleverly well done. The picture doesn`t always succeed at time and never know why the Alien(actually we never seen how the alien lifeform looks) is here on earth.

217962,5,6300183416,"One of the most amazing things about ""Repo Man"" is how well it holds up to repeated viewing. Not only are their dozens of background elements, which only become apparent somewhere between the second and fiftieth viewing, there is also a very well written story. By combining  elements from genres ranging from ""juvenile delinquent pictures""  to ""science fiction conspiracy"" Alex Cox created one of the best  American movies of the 1980s. There really is nothing quite like it. It  teases you, based on your expectations for a certain genre, then turns your  expectations on their head. Certainly, subverting audience expectations is  not all that rare, but Cox makes it seem so natural and right in this  film.
The film also benefits from a wonderful cast. Emilio Estevez was  never again so convincing in a role, while Harry Dean Stanton contributes a  portryal of an honorable ""repo man"" that is as critical to the  impact of this film as Alec Guinness was to the original ""Star  Wars."" Special note is deserved for character actor Tracey Walter  (perhaps best-known as the Joker's side-kick in the first Tim Burton Batman  film). His role as a burnt-out mechanic who turns out to be the only one  who really understands what's going on is among the funniest in cinema  history.
After this film, Alex Cox won acclaim (and more than a little  controversy) for his film about Sid Vicious, ""Sid & Nancy,""  and has made a number of films since then. All of them have had varying  degrees of critical and commercial success, but ""Repo Man"" seems  certain to be the one for which he'll be remembered.",957225600,2,1596,4.801470588235294

My high  school buddies used to quote this movie. So finally I saw it in college.  There are so many little treasures in this movie--space doesn't permit them  all, but the ""plot/subplot""--young nihilist Estevez becomes a  repo man and ends up repossesing a vehicle w/ dead aliens that then turn  the car into a UFO and whisks the 'pure' ones off into space--is not the  point of the movie.
The point? It's about the interconnectedness of  everything and the re-creation of that fantasy movie world that we miss so  often in today's films. Maybe there really were people like this in the  80's, but I never met them. I'd like to think that this film uses the  medium as a way to indulge all of our darker fantasies about human nature,  morality, and how we'd all act if we could.
Perhaps that's why this movie  is so popular. To give it five stars would be an insult. It's a terrible  movie, with terrible subject matter and terrible, mostly unlikeable  characters.

I think I even saw Napoleon Dynamite in there ! Worth the watch, for sure.",1525737600,,415,4.777777777777778
7804149,5,6300183416,"Sure, it's kind of the 'Rebel without a Cause' of my generation, but that doesn't lessen its appeal. Harry Dean Stanton at his most deadpan-cynical, Emilio Estevez's bratty punk put to good use, aliens, government agents, cameos, plate o' shrimpthis movie has everything. But most important, it has the greatest soundtrack ever made.",1525046400,,333,5.30188679245283

7804153,5,6300183416,I rented this when it came out in the 80's. Light years ahead of it's time. Probably the best characters of their careers that either has played for both Estevez and Harry Dean Stanton.,1520380800,,185,4.470588235294118
