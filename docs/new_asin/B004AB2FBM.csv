8419908,5,B004AB2FBM,"Don Pasquale is a beautiful, sometimes hilariously funny opera.  But one is sometimes saddened by
 poor Don Pasquale, who got more than he could ever have bargained for!  An excellent production,
well-sung throughout and particularly well-translated in the subtitles!  Sometimes sad, but on the whole
very funny.  Those who like this should consider getting one of the oldest versions of this opera, now on dvd
(but unfortunately without subtitles!).  It is with Italo Tajo as Don Pasquale, Alda Noni as Norina, Sesto Bruscantini
as Dottor Malatesta and Cesare Valletti as Ernesto.  Tajo is absolutely extraordinary and much more believable
than any other Don Pasquale I've ever seen.  An absolute genius of an artist!

8419909,5,B004AB2FBM,"I have not seen every DVD of Don Pasquale out there, and definitely cannot afford to ... but I HAVE read every review carefully on Amazon (as of 03/2014), and I have been burned by the Mei/Corbelli version (which I find essentially unwatchable due to the idiotic stage direction).  Reviews of other productions all mentioned something I didn't like, and using that experience this one came out on top.  (I would have gone with the later Muti blu-ray but reviews mentioned too many young singers, and staging leaning toward minimalist).

Well, I am very happy with this version, very happy indeed, well-sung and played and acted;  staging and scenery almost ideally traditional.  Responding to other reviews, the title character is not played as a total buffoon or unkempt tramp, just a lovable old eccentric.

And I am also happy to report, although I am not prepared to state the score is presented 100% complete, it is certainly at least nudging that end of the spectrum--I definitely heard at least several ritornelli I have NEVER heard before.  Always a pleasurable experience :)",1395964800,3,1083,4.9502762430939224
8419910,5,B004AB2FBM,La opera me encanto. Lo que no me gusto es que esperaba ms fotos en el libreto. Posee muchas arias muy buenas y  no se pasa de cmica.,1361923200,,133,3.75
8419911,5,B004AB2FBM,"This DVD recording is simply fantastic. I had only heard audio recorded excerpts of Don Pasquale but I had never seen it performed on  stage as it is meant to be enjoyed.

Wow, what a performance of what must be the greatest Italian comic opera after Barber of Seville. What a laugh, with a still very relevant moral lesson.

Put on the subtitles and you will actually laugh at certain moments!  Ricardo Muti leads the La Scala orchestra, soloists and chorus in a glorious performance.

The Soloists:

Ferucccio Furlanetto: (Don Pasquale)is incredible. He was still in his mid forties when he played a man in seventies and he is fantastic. Gorgeous  bass voice! He really understands what he is singing!

Lucio Gallo: (Dr Malatesta) is amazing! Not only does he have a beautiful voice but he really gets into the role physically. You will be hysterical! Unbelievable!

Watch a listen to both of them sing the patter duet ""Aspetta, Aspetta, cara sposina"" in Act III at allegro vivace speed! Unreal not one word missed!

Nuccia Focile (Norina): Sings the role beautifully and manages almost all of the coloratura and some of the trills. She is also a great actress and makes the role very funny as it should be!

Gregory Kunde: (Ernesto) One of the most beautiful tenor voices I have ever heard. He sings all of the difficult passages(for example the Act II  ""Cerchero lontana terra "") with such ease and clarity. He is an example of a bel canto lyric tenor voice that is crystal clear and never nasal! A joy!

The sets and costumes are beautiful. Very classically conceived without any crazy or what is now referred to as ""regie theatre"" where many European opera houses allow stage directors to ""experiment"" with scenery and choreography from a nightmare they once had....example the Don Pasquale with Florez from Zurich.

If you are familiar with or love  Don Pasquale then you will enjoy this DVD. If it is new as it was for me you will be hooked!",1351209600,4,1949,4.707964601769912
8419912,5,B004AB2FBM,"[[ASIN:B004AB2FBM It was very difficult for me to decide which version I was going to buy from the big offers.
Don Pasquale and Ernesto played by Ruggero Raimondi and Juan Diego Flores were the characters I liked the most in the Munich Opera.
An other version that I considered was the one directed by Ricardo Mutti, but I also had a preferences for the characters of Don Pasquale and Norina played by Desderi and Laura Giordano, I finally decided for the production of La Scala because I found the four characters very even in their performances as singers/actors.
It is not a surprise that Furlaneto as Don Pasquale was very successful, I have seen him frequently in dramatic roles, but he is very good as a comedian, I've seen him playing  Bartolo in Barbel of Seville and Leporello in Don Geovanni ,he is a very good singer an actor.
Nuccia Focile was very convincing in her role, she was very fanny and when she had to be serious she could do it, she is also a very wonderful singer.
Luccio Gallo playing the role of Malatesta was very witty organizing the ""complot"" involving Don Pasquale in a false marriage with a young lady played by Norina ,the goal in this plan was to favor a reunion in a true marriage between Ernesto and Norina.
Ernesto played by Gregory Kurde was very good.
The direction and orchestra were excellent as well as the scenery, costumes and quality of the DVD .This production is very enjoyable and I rate it with 5 stars.",1310860800,,1451,4.559386973180077
