3764804,5,B001QFP5MG,"This is an excellent beginning Bar Method workout; it is well taught, an excellent sequence, and something that can be done as a single session or in sections.",1360454400,,159,4.714285714285714
3764805,5,B001QFP5MG,"If you're an exercise dabbler like me, you might also have you life changed by this video. I have a kid, a full-time, job, a husband, and a desire to look better at 30 than I did at 18. Bar Method might actually get me there.

The movements are very focused and concentrated, i.e. 1-inch leg lifts done in a particular stance and for a number of reps, followed by 4 similar exercises in quick succession. The lack of a break is what helps burn fat, and the very concentrated work really sculpts problem areas. Burr focuses on arms, waist, seat and legs. Every time she talks about a ""lifted seat"" I kind of giggle because the term seems so archaic, but it is exactly my goal. Some easily found equipment is required, at least a mat, chair, and a strap. Weights and the fancy bar are optional.

Love that the entire workout is very low-impact so it energizes me later. Added bonus of not sweating profusely throughout (and I am a sweaty person...this is a big deal).  I find my posture is better, the right muscles are more defined, and my pants fit better after a month. Seriously. It does work quickly. Muscles shake throughout during the first several workouts.

While it's not mindful like yoga, and it's not as graceful as Pilates, I'm seeing results more quickly. Will get back into yoga and Pilates once I make a little more progress with Burr and the Bar Method.",1357430400,12,1369,4.485943775100401
3764806,5,B001QFP5MG,"I love this DVD.  It is a great beginner/intermediate DVD.  I like it better than The Bar Method Beginner workout.  The beginner workout moves really fast, and it doesn't feel like the instructor allows as much time for a stretch.  Don't get me wrong, it is a good DVD, but I like what feels like a slightly slower pace with a little more explanation to this DVD.  I felt like I was able to get a pretty good full body workout, and there wasn't anything that was too hard to try.  I highly recommend this DVD; however, don't buy it from Amazon.  Go to the Bar Method's website and buy the DVD's there.  You can buy a bundle that makes the DVD's less than $20 each.",1356307200,10,664,4.214285714285714
3764807,3,B001QFP5MG,"I have all of the Bar Method DVD's.  They have made my arms look great, helped my legs & backside a bit but have done little for abs. Too much stress on the back and neck. Other than that, the workouts are easy on my very bad knee and have helped me to make it stronger which is a huge plus. I started by squatting less and working my way up (or down).

Great instruction and easy to follow but I have found that in EVERY video, that instead of taking attention away from extreme burn by cueing you to concentrate on form or another part of the body, she points out how difficult some parts of the videos are.  It is annoying and makes the difficult part of some exercises even more difficult because she get you to concentrate on the burn.

I have found that most good instructors get you to focus on something else rather than saying ""I know these are tough"" or ""you can really feel the burn"" or ""just let the pain live there""...An ODD way to encourage you to keep going!  (Comments from various videos that I recall off the top of my head).

Good workout that can be adapted depending on your fitness level. Inspiring to see a woman who is not in her twenties in such great shape too. Great instruction as far as how to perform the exercises correctly, but hope her future videos don't emphasize the pain or how difficult some of the poses or moves are!",1327622400,7,1356,4.256809338521401
3764808,5,B001QFP5MG,"The first time I did this workout, I almost cried during thigh work, it is hard!  I like Burr as an instructor, she is not annoying at all.  I also like that all the women in the video wear long pants and a tank; you can tell they are in good shape but they are not showing off their 6-packs.  I noticed an improvement in my posture almost immediately.",1308096000,5,352,4.072463768115942
3764809,5,B001QFP5MG,"I'm a sucker for these ballet-inspired, little-tiny-movement workouts. I think it's because I'm inherently lazy, so I don't like to jump around a lot, but also because I like workouts that make me concentrate on what my body is doing.

What's interesting about this system is that it uses light weights, which means there's a bit more focus on arm work than in my beloved Callanetics. Almost every movement is followed by an appropriate stretch. The glutes and legs are worked in a variety of ways. And there are truly challenging abdominal exercises. Now, these use very few crunches, but the focus is on pelvic tilts. My guess -- and I hope I'm not getting the anatomy wrong -- is that they're working the Psoas muscle, which is generally quite hard to reach. This isn't discussed on the video per se, but the effect of working the Psoas muscle is, I've heard, to pull in the abdominals -- which you can't get just by doing crunches. I haven't seen this kind of focus on the Psoas in any other workout video so far.

By the time the workout was done, I didn't really feel I had done anything. Sure, the individual exercises had been challenging, but none were exhausting. Still, I thought I'd wait a day or two to see how I felt the next day, if the exercises had really worked my muscles.

The next day: oh lord. And the day after that -- I could feel leg, butt, hip, and arm muscles still pleasantly hurting. Now that I know its effects, I can't wait to do it again!",1296345600,40,1470,4.437037037037037
3764810,4,B001QFP5MG,"Ouch! My thighs are on fire!
The directions are clear, and you don't need speacial equipments to perform the exercises which seem easy but burn every muscle of your body.
I wish they would add some back exercises, more waist and abs.
For beginners - try to concentrate on the pink/lavender lady. Sadly, not shown enough.
All in all - a great way to start the day!
I will definitely purchase other Bar Method DVDs.",1294704000,8,413,4.52
3764811,5,B001QFP5MG,"Since 8/19/10, I've done this 11 times. I do this dvd 2-3x/week. I get bored very easily doing the same dvd so I'd do Ellen Barrett's Slim Sculpt or Burn and Firm Pilates to alternate on strength days, then the other 3 days of the week are reserved for cardio [Hiit/bursting for 2 days and Ilaria's Powerstrike 5 for 1 day]. I allow myself 1 day to rest. Now, when I wear my jeans, they became lose that I keep pulling them up or I just wear a belt when I remember it.....So, this is good news that keeps me motivated to keep at it. My diet isn't perfect but I try to eat sensibly [around 1600 calories on most days]. The best part is a co-worker asked if I've lost weight and I said 'not really'; she said I have a slimmer shape. I just didn't mention about the lost inches I'm experiencing. I silently said to myself, bar method must be working 'coz my physique had always looked like a ""barrel"" and now it's developing a slimmer shape; curves if I may say so myself?! Wow, results that someone noticed! I'm so convinced now that if I keep doing this I might just reach my goal of fitting comfortably in a size 4-6 in 3-4 months. I wear a size 10 right now and sometimes I fit in an 8. It takes tremendous will power for me to stay slim 'coz like others, once I reach my goal, I slack off and become chunky again....

About the workout, the 52 minutes fly by. I like Burr Leonard 'coz her instructions are clear and precise. She's encouraging and never annoying. You can't help but admire her method; just look at her toned body at age 61 during the year this dvd was released. The moves are similar to Lotte Berk and Core Fusion which I borrowed from the library. Thank God I didn't buy them 'coz I found them boring. Don't get me wrong but I think Core Fusion would have worked if I could stay focused. It was just not interesting to me. Back to Bar Method, I still shake a lot doing the thigh/seat series, the arms/upperbody was challenging but doable and the core is something I need to focus on form for it to be effective. Tuck, tuck, tuck! By the time I do the core series, I have sweat flowing down on my face. This is basically a toning dvd and I'm sweating? You know it's not easy when you see Burr and the 3 instructors in the dvd still shaking doing the thigh series considering they've been doing this for years. Burr even says, shaking is a good sign....so don't give up on 'standing on your toes carving the thighs part'; I was in serious discomfort/ready to quit during this part and Burr would say ""you'll go down 2 jean sizes if you stay with me""...I personally close my eyes and take deep breaths to survive it. I like the pretzel move and seat dancing 'coz at 45 years old, I can feel AND see my rear lifting....Oh, and the stretches after each segment, do them....the muscles are warm at this point so the deep stretches really elongates/lengthens/shapes them. You'll feel these....

Bottomline, I highly recommend this and I'm looking forward to the new release sometime soon. I bought this dvd from the bar method's website for $20 + s&h....I prefer shorter workouts but this is worth my time...

UPDATE: It's been 2 months since I started doing this DVD 2-3 X a week. Still NO weight lost but my size 8 pants are no longer tight on me. As a matter of fact, I have to pull them up a lot of times. I've been researching 'cuz I want variety so I was thinking of getting Callanetics Evolution....HOWEVER, few days ago I checked out the bar method website and they just released their new dvds:Beginner's (37 min.), Dancer's Body (62 min.), Pregnancy and Super-Sculpting. They're so new that that there are no video clips to show or no reviews published yet....I'm interested on either the Dancer's body or Super Sculpting [this particular one isn't even mentioned in the dvd store- I found it on the blog]. Can't wait to invest another $20.....",1284768000,43,3866,4.37413073713491

Burr is much more tolerable than Tanya from Physique 57, and I like that the music is more low key.  The movements are smaller, but very focused and you can really feel the burn.  I like to mix it up, so I'm glad I have other bar DVDs, but this one is definitely my favorite and I don't get bored with it like I sometimes do the others.",1423094400,7,434,3.954022988505747

3764822,5,B001QFP5MG,"I started doing the Bar Method in March 2014 (now early June).  The changes I have seen in my body in that time have been tremendous.  I've gone down 2 pant sizes and have lost about 5 inches off my waste.  My thighs have drastically tightened up as well.  The best thing about The Bar Method is the change in my posture.  I never walked with confidence and kept my shoulders hunched up avoiding making eye contact with the world.  As a result of this, I had tremendous back pain. Now, my shoulders are back and I keep my head up and feel confident in my own skin.  I have Burr Leonard to thank for this new confidence.  Plus, my back pain is completely gone.  I will do The Bar Method for the rest of my life.  It is has lengthened my body and toned it in ways I didn't think possible.  I do it about 3 times a week.  If you want to see results, don't quit... Keep it up.  You too can get tone and lose inches.",1401840000,15,911,4.022346368715084

It doesn't have as many reps or as great a variety of exercises as the Super Sculpting or Dancer's Body DVDs. Still, Burr's cues are exceptional and she gives excellent tips about body position and form. These movements are so subtle and small that even slight adjustments in form can make a big difference!

I still think Super Sculpting is my favorite DVD, but this one is classic and worth the money. Oh, and for heaven's sake buy it on the Bar Method website for $17!",1393200000,7,643,4.358333333333333

3764830,5,B001QFP5MG,"I tried The Bar Method (TBM) years ago when the original two workouts were released, and although I owned both TBM&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Fat-Free/dp/B00011D17M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Fat Free</a>&nbsp;and TBM&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Designer-Sculpting/dp/B00011D17C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Designer Sculpting</a>&nbsp;for awhile, I didn't really click with either of those workouts.  I also didn't really click with the instructor and founder, Burr Leonard, so I was interested to see if things would be different with this new workout.  Burr instructs CHANGE YOUR BODY live, and she is accompanied by three background exercisers, all of whom are Bar Method instructors and one of whom (Jen) shows modifications for many of the exercises.

The Main Menu for Change Your Body offers options for Play All-Select Workout-About Burr Leonard-Web Link.  In the introduction to the routine, Burr recommends using 2-4 pound weights for the arms work.  You will also need something to use for a barre (two of the three background exercisers use a high-backed chair), a mat, and a strap for the stretching at the end.

Like most barre workouts, Burr begins with a high knees march as a warm-up.  This is very brief, however, and she moves right into the arms work with weights.  The moves here include alternating shoulder raises, various bicep curls/pulses, and single straight arm tricep work.  Following a stretch for the triceps, you'll put down the weights for push-ups (held and pulses) and triceps push-ups on the floor.  After another stretch on the floor for the arms, you'll move to the barre to stretch the hips and hamstrings.

Now it's time to start the leg work.  Burr sets you up at the barre, starting with legs parallel, on your toes, and coming about halfway down.  Most of the moves are performed on the toes, but you'll constantly switch up between parallel feet, feet turned out, isometric holds, slow repetitions, and quick pulses.  Just when you think you can't do any more, you'll finish with a standing quad stretch and then stretch you hip flexors and hamstrings on the mat.

Seat work is next, starting with the pretzel.  Burr asks Jane to demonstrate this so that she can meticulously explain positioning.  Several variations are performed on both sides, and then you'll return to the barre for bent over leg lifts.  Following this, Burr states that we need to get the heart rate up, so she performs front leg lifts while standing sideways to the barre.  (Note:  my heart rate barely reached my target zone for this workout.)  The final seat move consists of a wide plie with heel lifts; again, you'll perform variations on this until your legs feel ready to fall off!

The core section starts with a hold of elbow plank.  Burr then performs three separate series of c-curve abs work.  For the first series, she is lying back, holding her arms out to her sides in an ""L"" shape; for the second series, she leans back on her elbows; and finally, for the last series, she is again in a more upright position, this time with her palms at her chest.  I found this work to be quite challenging and also a bit straining for my back, so I use my squishy ball behind by low back to provide some support (Jen shows a modification with a pillow).

Following the core work, Burr comes to a reclined position for ""back dancing,"" a series of quick pelvic tucks to work the seat.  These are performed at various tempos, first with the feet hip-distance apart, then with the feet further (about mat distance).  The 4.5 minute stretch segment is performed mostly lying, starting with a happy baby pose stretch and then moving right into a crossed legs stretch.  Next, Burr uses the strap to perform reclined leg stretch for the hamstrings.  Finally, she comes to seated for a neck stretch on either side to finish.  I clocked the total time for this workout at 51.5 minutes.

This is a TOUGH workout, but because Burr interspersed stretch breaks throughout, it felt very doable, and the time went by very quickly (the upbeat music helped with this too).  Burr's instruction is excellent; she provides plenty of form pointers making this DVD appropriate for those who are new to barre workouts.  However, because this routine is quite challenging, it is NOT appropriate for beginning exercisers.  I am a daily exerciser (I generally consider myself in the high intermediate range, depending on the workout) who has had some prior experience with barre workouts, and I found CHANGE YOUR BODY to be sufficiently taxing.  Time will tell whether this workout will actually provide body-changing results, but I believe that it certainly has the potential to do so.",1373155200,44,4770,5.1175710594315245

Since then, I have purchased two more DVDs and have joined Bar Method Online for streaming online classes, the workout is that great. It's low impact (maybe non-impact actually) and very effective. I actually don't use this DVD any more because it has become too easy for me. But when I first used it, it was definitely challenging at parts, but overall felt like a moderate workout, more refreshing than exhausting. Even so, I did see results. I am naturally thin so I can't speak to any weight loss results, but I definitely saw tone and new muscle definition and noticed a dramatic improvement in my rear. To put it bluntly, I have a butt now. It used to blend into my thighs but it has perked up now and become it's own separate body part, which is great.

I would recommend this to anyone who is new to the Bar Method because it eases you in to the workout, emphasizing form and technique, at a level thats easy enough to not be discouraging, but still get results.

Also Burr is great, not too perky, obnoxious, or corny. That's always an important to me when choosing a workout video.",1451260800,10,1151,4.450236966824645

But it was too pricey, so I looked for a barre video that would bring me the same burn. I ordered Bar Method based on other reviews, along with Pure Barre's Pershing Square 1.
Bar Method is easy to follow, and the leader is pleasant without being boring. I understand that part of the transformation comes from the stretching elements, but for me it seemed like there was too much emphasis on the stretching. I gave it 4 stars for that reason. Production values are good and the background music is innocuous. The exercises themselves are challenging, but reps are much lower than Pure Barre and there are far fewer change ups. I've been using the 3 in tandem now- Physique 57 for arms and abs, and Bar Method and PB for seat and thighs. Great together.",1444953600,7,899,4.454545454545454
