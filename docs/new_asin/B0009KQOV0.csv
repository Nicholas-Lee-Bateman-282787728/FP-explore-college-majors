So I will just review the physical aspects of the shipment instead of the show.
I got it within the estimate time I was given, and it arrived intact.
The buyer I got it from (gohastings) said the case itself was a little worn, and it was, but not much and is acceptable.
The disc itself is in PRISTINE condition, and has no problem playing.
So, yeah.
Great show, great condition! BUY!",1377907200,,479,4.161290322580645
8062812,4,B0009KQOV0,"Pacifica is traveling with her brother, Shannon, and her sister, Raquel. Pacifica has a terrible destiny. She is referred to as the Scrapped Princess. The Scrapped Princess is said to be born under a cursed star and bring destruction to the entire world. Nearly the entire world is out to kill her. There is nowhere they can hide, so they stay on the move. Shannon is a talented swordsman, and Raquel is a strong sorceress. Pacifica has very good protectors. At first glance, Pacifica tends to seem like a spoiled brat. Sometimes she makes a complete turnaround and shows a sweet and caring attitude. It's kind of wierd how she changes like that. The 3 siblings will meet many people on their journey. Some will become friends and others will betray them. One thing is for sure; there will be lots of action and plot twists.

This series is pretty good. It has a good mix of action, comedy and drama. There are some really good characters that are developed well. This series stays focused on the main plot and doesn't diverge like a lot of the fantasy animes out there. It has good animation, voice acting, and a decent soundtrack. I really enjoyed it, but there are tons of better shows out there. I'll give it 4 stars, because even though I enjoyed it, it didn't blow me away.",1356480000,,1279,4.560869565217391
8062813,4,B0009KQOV0,"Ok, I'll cut to the chase: you won't be buying this if you don't already love the program - that would just be absurd, no?
You won't be buying this if you don't have shelf space - the box is too good to throw away. By the way, for some reason someones already opened the box.
I'm assuming you're not Comic Book Guy(tm) and you will break the blister pack seal and actually handle the  figurine. This is 125mm tall inc plinth. She is beautifully detailed (please bear in mind that I've NEVER owned a doll in my life so have little to compare against save Matchbox cars etc.) and the workmanship is top notch. I hope I haven't just praised a machine.
I have never come across such a loose woman. Everything falls off (apart from the clothes!)so care is required that limbs don't go missing.
Note: if you are after a figurine alone, the two boxes in this series that are $45 have much larger figurines. One each of Pacifica and Raquel.
Now I need a display cabinet...",1185753600,,964,4.355555555555555
8062814,5,B0009KQOV0,"As our unfortunate party continue on their retreat, they encounter even more potential enemies and allies. An encounter with a church inquisitor leads our band to a hidden village, and another Scrapped Princess(?). Later, their escape is thwarted, and they are taken prisoner by a princess of the Giatt Empire. Pacifica must then face many questions about who she is, and what she represents. Is she a threat to the world, or just a threat to someone's carefully constucted status quo?
The plot has definitely thickened in this latest installment, as parts of the story get clearer. As usual, the animation is great, and the writing is very sharp. This series just continues to impress me with its quality, and I'm looking forward to the next installment.",1161648000,,755,4.952755905511811
