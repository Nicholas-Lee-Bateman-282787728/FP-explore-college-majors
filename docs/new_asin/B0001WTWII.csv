2034991,5,B0001WTWII,"Moonchild was the BEST MOVIE EVER!!! Gackt and Hyde's relationship was adorable. ^_^ The.. gun scenes were really amazing, though sometimes confusing about who was shooting who.. Overall, great movie! It all made SENSE! And.. the ending was beautiful. Best vampire ending possible. ^_^",1084579200,,285,5.5
2034992,5,B0001WTWII,"I don't know why this movie gets bad ratings. It's a great movie. I'm not saying it's perfect or anything, because it's not. I'll start off with the bad things about it. The acting isn't the best, of course, the three main characters are singers, not actors, but for singers, they sure do well at acting. There's no really memorable music (except Orenji no Taiyou, the song Luka taught Hyde...er... Kei XD), and I guess it *can* be slow at times. But the good. It's got memorable characters. Movies are good if they can easily control your emotions. If they easily move you from happy to sad to angry. This movie does it all. Everything ties together nicely at the end, and it leaves you satisfied and with a few things to think about. I highly reccommend this to people who want a movie that isn't about the killing and blood, but about the emotions and messages behind the picture ;)",1083369600,4,885,4.503105590062112
2034993,5,B0001WTWII,I ordered the original Japanese DVD a while ago.  Moon Child is one of my favorite movies of all time.  Gackt and Hyde are exalent in this movie!!  I love the plot. (...) I hope they do more work together in the future.,1080000000,2,219,4.046511627906977
2034994,5,B0001WTWII,"Moon Child is one of the best movies ever! It has all the action and sci-fi~ Gackt and Hyde are the best! Wonderful plot and story! Great acting and gun action. A bit violent, but very good work! Would recomment to anyone!!! Very cool and very stunning! My all time fav. movie!!! Recommend! It's worth your time!!! Gackt is so cool!!!",1079913600,4,334,4.491803278688525
2034995,5,B0001WTWII,"Even if you're not a fan of the two rock idols, Gackt and HYDE, there is something for everyone in MOON CHILD. From the ultra-hip fight scenes, tightly edited camera work, and heart-wrenching storyline, this powerhouse of a movie is a must for any DVD library. Zeze Takahisa succeeds beautifully in taking two idols and turning them into the definitive cool characters of our time. Japanese cinema is in the middle of a huge comeback and it's getting better than ever.",1079827200,4,468,4.790123456790123
2034996,3,B0001WTWII,"We basically view Sho's life, who's an orphan with his brother and best bud Shinji.  Kei, a vampire, becomes a crucial companion to Sho.  Japan's Jrock stars work together along with Wang Lee Hom in this piece.  There are many transitional scenes and slow moments that deem to be boring.  However it has its interesting quirks that'll leave the watcher in wonder.",1079654400,,363,4.806451612903226
2035009,5,B0001WTWII,"I had to write a review on this for two reasons. First, this is one of my favorite Japanese movies, period. Second, I don't believe most of the negative reviews are fair in the sense that reviewer doesn't seem to ""get"" the movie.

Plot: The plot sounds bizarre, I couldn't blame someone for being skeptical about the movie based on the bizarre genre match. Its also somewhat hard to describe given that there are two major ""time jumps"" in the movie and changing dynamics between the characters. Essentially, its about a group of friends who earn money by drugging elite gangs. One of the friends is a vampire, but not everyone knows it in the beginning. If this sounds strange, it is. But it's brought together in a beautiful way based on the theme of the movie.

Theme: The major theme of this movie is change. People who say the plot is nonsensical are definitively not appreciative or aware of satire. In a period of two hours, this movie covers the heart-felt beginning of new friendships, questions of mortality and existence, the pain of change, the loss of past, sacrifice and rebirth. Not only are these themes present, they are developed in a way that makes you feel connected to the characters. Each character has a specific purpose, a role in the movie. If you remove any single character from the movie, the events wouldn't have played out in a way which covered all the aforementioned themes. Also, the movie is gushing with symbolism. You may not get it all your first time around, but if you pay attention you'll want to watch it again. There are very few movies that you can watch several times throughout several points in your life and be able to feel connected to it in different ways.

All in all, I'd recommend this movie to anyone who craves something more than a rudimentary plot and senseless violence. If your the type of person who can appreciate the very human struggles we all have, as well as engrossing satire, this movie is for you.",1386288000,,1963,4.6189111747851
2035010,2,B0001WTWII,"I'm pretty sure 90% of the fans of this movie are Gackt and Hyde fans. With that said, there's some fan service that would make any girl (or guy) squeal. The thing is, the acting is so bad with the exception of the guy from Battle Royale. That was the main flaw of the movie. Second, the budget of the movie definitely shows with bad effects and corny settings. Third, the action (this was supposed to be an action movie right?) part of the movie is directed as if they people who wrote and directed this movie never saw an action movie before. Oh and the plot is pretty outrageous, but I won't hold that against this movie because it's Japanese after all.

If you're a Gackt or Hyde fan, you'd probably give this movie a 3 or 4 out of 5, but otherwise, just skip this.",1382486400,,769,4.2312925170068025
2035011,5,B0001WTWII,"First off, this movie stars some pretty big names: GACKT, Hyde, and Leehom Wang - all of them great singers.

It's in Japanese with or without English subtitles. I love the original Japanese language instead of a voice over.

I saw this movie on YouTube when I was in 10th grade, 5 years ago, and fell in love. It made me cry (which means it's good).

I won't spoil the story, but I must say the characters and the storyline are brilliantly crafted. There's action, drama, a bit of romance, not really horror, and comedy.

If you are fans of GACKT, Hyde, and Leehom Wang, you won't be disappointed. If you like foreign films, I highly recommend this one.",1368230400,,654,4.470588235294118
2035012,4,B0001WTWII,Not in English. Bought the DVD because it sits so well in my vampire section but the verison I saw was in English and the DVD gives no option other than subtitle other wise moonchild is a masterpiece and gakt is amazeing,1361145600,,220,4.261904761904762
2035013,5,B0001WTWII,I bought this movie so that I would have a copy for my daughter to watch. I love this movie. Its very tragic and romantic!,1357862400,,122,3.92
2035014,3,B0001WTWII,"I bought the original release at a con in 2005 and fell in love with the movie-
The action sequences are a lot of fun: sometimes they're serious and well-choreographed, other times they are ridiculous and funny. The music choices melted my heart a little bit. The subtitles translated and synced well and were easy to follow. The plot and performances are all fantastic. The only issue was that the original DVD release was Region 2, and I only have Region 1 DVD players.

But things have changed for this release-
Somehow the subtitles got off-sync with the dialogue for a few lines during one scene. It probably won't ruin your viewing experience to be reading the english sentences at the wrong times while they're speaking in cantonese and japanese. What made me sad was that they changed out Jim Croce's ""Mr. Bojangles"" for some tune I'd never heard during one of the fun BFFs-scenes toward the start of the movie.

That said, this new release is certainly Region 1, and I do appreciate not having to burn a copy of the original release to break region coding to get to enjoy this beautiful movie. A friend gifted it knowing I'm a fan, and it made my day to open that wrapping.

""Not worth knocking it down to 3 stars""- Instead of raving about how much I love this movie (and I do!) I wanted to let people know what their options are. This is a 5 star movie with a 3 star release quality.",1353801600,,1393,4.454901960784314
2035015,4,B0001WTWII,"I love the cast so the special affects don't have to be great and they're not but, it IS worth watching.",1353715200,,104,4.0
2035016,5,B0001WTWII,"I really enjoyed the movie! Gackt and Hyde were amazing. I watched it with my family and we laughed and cried at some parts. Also, i got this used-very good and i looked at it, it had no straches so i was very happy. Fast delivery!",1343260800,,231,4.043478260869565
2035017,1,B0001WTWII,"I read good reviews for this film so I watched it with my friend. Both of us HATED it with a passion and still cannot believe that we managed to sit through the entire movie and my friend still blames me for wasting her time. I kept thinking, ""well, this film got such good reviews, there must be a good reason for it...I'm sure it'll get better!"" But it never did! I have a high tolerance for horrible films, but this film just blew them all out of the water.

I would say that most of the people who rated this as 5 stars are fans of gackt & hyde and just said they loved the film because they were busy drooling over the actors rather than their performance. To me, these 2 have no acting skills whatsoever and I'm never going to watch another movie with them in it. The acting was rigid, overly done and not believable at all. The plot was also slow, bland, cliche and horribly boring.

If you're a fan of these 2, you might enjoy it. I'm neither a fan or a hater of them, but I sure did hate this film! I guess this film mostly got 5 stars because the only people who bothered to watch it were fans of gackt/hyde or fans of vampire stories.

Don't waste your time with this film. I highly do not recommend it. Not all pop stars can act and these 2 certainly cannot.",1334880000,,1270,4.112903225806452
2035018,5,B0001WTWII,"As others have written about the story of Moon Child both singers Hyde and Gackt play the 2 main characters and there are another 3 or 4 that become joined within their group of friends.  This is an action/vampire story which sounds insane and it's not dubbed for those of you who won't read subtitles.  I have to say this has actually turned into my favorite Vampire movie.  No big vampire make and Hyde does a remarkable job as Kei a vampire who was turned and then the man who turned him sat in the sun to die because he said he had seen and done everything he needed to.  Kei is haunted by what he has become also when he meet Sho (Gackt's) character who appears about 8 or 9.  Kei is shocked when Sho sees him starting to smoke when the sun hits him and drags  him to his brother and friends hideout into the shady spot.  The three young boys have just robbed a man with a briefcase full of money to me it is assummed he is some sort of bad guy with all that cash.  As you can except he chases the boys and finds one of them first Sho's brother and shoots him in the leg.  Toshi the friend has taken off another direction and the man directs Sho to get him before he kills his brother.  As he steps out of screen you here a sound his brother screams as Sho runs right back and warns him against going in saying his friend is a monster.  In fact although Kei kills/feeds off the man he does it to save the boys.  When Sho sees him with the blood on his lips and isn't frightened he asked him if he were scared and he tells him by shaking his head and smiling.

This friendship as Sho and the others while Kei has to watch it happen around him is both beautiful and sad.  Hyde often is photographed in tons of make up but I have to say although he is very small probably a little over 5 feet tall and rather delicate looking he is very handsome in the nearly natural make up they did with him.  I do have to agree with others that they overdid Gackts makeup he's a handsome guy I know make up is one of his trademarks too but in the movie it was too much.  But as with Hyde Gackt put in a very wonderful performance of both at times a little funny to a wide range of emotions.

I liked that this wasn't your typical vampire bite em up movie.  Kei's character only fed on people that Sho and his gang fought and killed.

There are some beautiful scenes in this movie and personally I like the way they used Kei's vampire skills.  In one gun battle particularly I found it so beautiful as Hyde/Kei held onto a bad guy and did a dance as he shot.

I've given away enough but just remember go into this movie with an open mind it might surprise you.  I picked it up when I read Hyde was in it for the dumb reason I loved his bands song Ready Steady Go from Full Metal Alchemist the anime.  Turns out he should be in more movies however I think he has only done 2.",1331596800,,2862,4.035460992907802
2035029,5,B0001WTWII,"An excellent movie, there is a bit of a time gap, but overall I thoroughly enjoyed it.  A little comedy, with action, and tragedy.  Unexpected twists, make the movie all the more memorable.",1324425600,,189,4.696969696969697
2035030,5,B0001WTWII,"This movie is one of the best movie's I have ever seen. Granted there is no real plot, but the action and the story of friends is amazing. I would recommend watching this.",1323216000,,171,4.212121212121212
2035031,5,B0001WTWII,"I hadn't heard of this movie until a couple of years ago but couldn't buy it due to lack of money so I had to settle for watching it in parts on Youtube (not the best choice, but the only one available). I'm glad to say I finally was able to afford it & purchased it a few days ago. It arrived earlier today & I'm already viewing it for the 2nd time. If you like feel good movies with action & drama you'll love Moon Child; Gackt Camui, Leehom Wang, & Hyde help make it worth watching. Watching it you'd almost believe they really are a ""family."" If you don't speak Japanese, Cantonese, or Taiwanese it's fine; the movie comes with English subtitles.",1300665600,,650,4.25
2035032,5,B0001WTWII,"I am not good a writing reviews for movies, but this time I will give it a try.  The movie has an awesome story line, and it is quite moving.  Even though it is based upon the story line of one being a vampire it is not the vampire story you would expect from having watched others, it is one where a young boy innocently befriends a vampire and they become best friends.  There is not much blood and gore vampire activities in the movie but rather how one who is supposedly bad does right by their friend and protects him.

I would suggest any who are interested in Asian cinema to watch this movie as a beginning start point. To enjoy the movie you must watch it through to the end, there is a wide array of different styles of acting in this, you have comedy, drama, action and true love.

I can only wish that movies like this would appear here  :D",1296950400,,852,4.164634146341464
2035033,5,B0001WTWII,"The musicians GACKT and Hyde do better than expected in this movie. Emotion is felt, and they get the point across. There are some moments in this movie where you think ""What the hell..?"", but then you understand after. Has comedy, romance, tragedy and action. This movie was certainly worth watching.",1292716800,,301,4.921568627450981
2035034,4,B0001WTWII,"The title to me is misleading, I thought at first it would be a werewolf movie, but it is a cool/hip vampire movie.  Early on in the movie you have to suspend disbelief as one of the main actors dodges bullets without any special ability, but all-in-all, the movie should appeal to anyone interested in vampires or asian action cinema.  If you aren't used to asian cinema, there will be some peculiarities, but if you keep an open mind you should enjoy it.  One aspect of the movie I liked is that it gave a modern feel to vampires.  Instead of vampires running at the site of crosses or garlic, and being ancient creatures, it feels like this is more how vampires would be in the modern world.  The main actors are pop stars, but I think they did a good job in their roles (not stellar, but not bad either).  It was an enjoyable movie, and I encourage people to watch it.",1289088000,,872,4.319018404907975

2035036,5,B0001WTWII,A old friend of mine had showed me this movie and i fell in love with it! So after getting onto AMzon i was glad to have found it!,1281225600,,130,3.5172413793103448
2035037,5,B0001WTWII,"This is one of my favorite movies because it's starring gackt AND hyde. And the subbing is pretty good too. Hyde is more of a natural actor than gackt, but they both did a beautiful job if you ask me XD",1276473600,,202,3.951219512195122
2035038,5,B0001WTWII,"Okay, so I'm reviewing this after just finishing the film only minutes ago. Tears still falling.

Honestly, though, this probably is one for all those fans of Gackt or Hyde. Honestly, if you know Gackt's style you'll love this. If you are a fan of them you should have no problem with this film. It'll probably boil down to that for some.

For those who aren't fans, or don't know either, this isn't a bad film. It's certainly a tear jerker, so if you're prone to crying during such films, keep a box of tissue near. Also, be aware, this video is in subtitles. Three languages are spoken; Chinese, Japanese, and English. The English is minimal, though, and when it's spoken you won't find a subtitle, the rest of the movie there is no dub. For me, I prefer that they don't dub it as they tend to ruin the intent of a film when that occurs, but I know others it may be a problem for.

That being said, this story is very deep. It can get slow in order to show character development, but honestly, it's not unruly so. If you like a story actually being developed this isn't really a problem. There are time skips, but honestly, I believe they do this more because there's only so much that you can pack into one film, and to grasp the full scope of this film, it was necessary. I've seen far worse things done. You also have to take into account that this isn't an American made film. The Japanese have a slightly different style than us. Which is fine by me, having grown up watching Japanese anime, but again, it might be a problem for others.

The story, takes place in the future. Think, very poor and run down, not bright and happy. The film initially shows three children, one of them befriending a vampire at the beginning of the film. After that point, there is a time jump to when these guys are young adults. This is the point that the major character development is established. There's a female love interest that soon becomes involved, and despite some other reviewers saying she didn't play much of a part, I feel she was an integral part of the story. This story is definitely a roller coaster with many ups and downs.

And honestly, I'd recommend it, but to those with an open mind. And of course, to anyone already a fan of Gackt or Hyde. To those who thinks anything I've just described really isn't for you, I'd suggest probably avoiding this film.",1273363200,3,2365,4.415137614678899
2035059,5,B0001WTWII,"That's all I can really say. Honestly yes I am a fangirl of both Gackt-san and HYDE-san but I can honestly say that this movie was great. The acting of both Gackt-San and HYDE-san was superb. I just finished watching it a few seconds before writing this and I'm still teary eyed. While the ending is sad, yes it's more of a bittersweet ending. There were also points in the movie that made me laugh as well (mostly concerning Kei's teasing of Sho) I would reccomend this movie to whoever likes action and doesn't mind the fact that it isn't your typical vampire movie. It focuses more on the relationship between the characters and the pain of loosing those you love and how they deal with aftermath (mostly not so well :)) and yes there are going to be times where you will be shouting at the screen going why the heck are you going in there you idiot! But that doesn't take away from the fact that it is a great movie.",1267920000,,920,4.323699421965318
2035060,4,B0001WTWII,"Before you write a review about this movie, I think you should explain where you stand.
I love Gackt and Hyde and their music, but I still tried to see this movie for what it was. And because both singers got lost in their characters, I didn't have a problem at all. On screen, they were not Gackt and Hyde, they truly became Sho and Kei - the main characters of ""Moon Child"".

Set in a fictional city called Mallepa, three orphans try to make ends meet by pickpocketing. Young Sho, one of the orphans, finds a weakened man in an abandoned building - intrigued by the man's beauty and his strange condition (he burns in the sunlight) Sho takes him to their hideout and attempts to take care of him.
Unfortunately, a yakuza shows up and demands that the boys return his stolen money. In the resulting fight the stranger saves the boys' lives and when curious Sho discovers that he is indeed a vampire, the two decide to stick together as friends.
Kei, the vampire, raises Sho and becomes his partner in crime as they steal money from various gangs around Mallepa. They are assisted by their friend Toshi, and soon they find another ally in Son and his mute sister Yi-Che.

The essence of the movie would be the strong friendship between the five main characters. But as they age, they have to choose sides, give up their friends, face them in battle, fight for what they treasure...
In the middle of this chaos are Sho and Kei, who has to live in the darkness with the guilt and the knowledge that he will see his friends die and continue to live with a broken heart.
Kei's character has the most depth in this film, and I have to admit that Hyde's acting blew me away. I'm also thrilled by the fact that he is more of an old school ""I kill people and I don't sparkle""-vampire.
However, I wish they would have made the movie longer. I got the feeling they squeezed too much into the movie and pushed the plot forward with every scene, but by cutting down on the runtime Sho's and Kei's bond loses credibility. Also, I'm not too happy with the gun battles, they look very low-budget and are way over the top at times.",1267315200,,2115,4.379134860050891

2035067,3,B0001WTWII,"I happen to like both Gackt and Hyde. Not as a fangirl, but I like their music and weirdly ""pretty boys"" fashion senses. I especially appreciate L'Arc-En-Ciel's music. Hyde definitely can perform and sing.

However, this movie was a mess. It needed better story structure and editing. It really was a strange experience in the mish-mosh way of telling a vampire-human bond (with homoerotic undertones) type of tale.

Hyde plays a vampire who is pretty sick of his life and has a death wish. Gackt plays a juvenile delinquent in a futuristic Asian town who, with the aid of his vampire comrade, rises in the ranks.

The fight scenes have a certain over-the-top appeal. And watching pretty-boy Gackt and his cheekbones and makeup and sexy-not-at-all-practical outfits for a ganster-guy is a bit surreal, but amusing. Hyde has terrible ""cheap"" hair in this one. What a shame. He's really attractive in that uberslender, pretty J-rock style when his hair is longer and dark.

The story basically follows the emotional messses and joys of the bond between these two men as they deal with relationships, crime, ennui, dysfunctional families, allies, and enemies.

Had a better writing/editing team gotten ahold of this, there might have been a good flick. This is a so-so flick, but definitely a must-see for fangirls and a could-be-good-see for those who appreciate two of J-Rock's cooler Bishies.

2035068,3,B0001WTWII,"I watched this movie without any idea of who Gackt or Hyde were. [i later came to find out they are some type of japanese rock stars, but that's beside the point]
Yes, they are both very pretty, but good looking stars doth not a good film make.
In all fairness, i did enjoy the fight scenes, even if they were a bit over the top.  But overall, the movie kind of dragged.  The story made weird timeline jumps, which left me feeling like i was missing something.  Most of the characters are pretty cold also.  The only one i actually sort of sympathized with was the vampire, Kei. [which is ironic, because he's not even human]  The ending, however, was very well done.
But overall i found it hard to follow, and emotionally muddled.
So, in my humble opinion,
It wasn't horrible, but it wasn't Great",1240099200,6,797,4.394557823129252

In the first part of the movie, before things truly pick up, my thoughts remained in the state of expecting crap. However, after the first five or ten minutes I was shocked by how pulled into the movie I had become. By the end of the movie I was sobbing. Not many movies make me cry, even fewer are good enough to make me want to write a review.

The credits song was very Last Samurai-esque. In fact. . . the emotions in this movie were very similar to The Last Samurai. I would have to say that Moon Child is kind of like a modern day vampire version of The Last Samurai in a way.

Anyways, I digress, this movie is definitely worth the time to watch! With a price of 9$ I really do think its worth the money. Go for it, its likely you won't be disappointed!",1224201600,,954,4.037037037037037

This is not your typical vampire story. There are no glowing eyes and obstruction of the facial features. It seems to be a very realistic approach to vampirism. Although there is a vampire in this film it is NOT a horror movie. It is more of a action/drama. I cried on a few parts myself. It is a very touching movie that I highly reccomend to everyone. So if you're in the mood to watch a movie thats true to life and the struggles we go through check it out!! You will not be disappointed!",1207440000,2,668,4.2265625

This movie is a tribute to the many talents of Gackt as well as Hyde and Wang Lee, who also did a very good job.  Gackt's acting was truly heartfelt and has left me in tears eveytime I watch the movie.  Hyde's performance was very touching as well, portraying his character's feelings to his way of life and the love he has for his friends.  Wang Lee was also very powerful, blending very well with the talents of Gackt and Hyde.  The movie is a rollercoaster of emotions, going from truly heart jerking moments to roaring gun fights and action scenes.  The story is very engrossing and well written, coming from the brilliant mind of Gackt, creating an immediate interest in what is going to happen next.  A must have for any Gackt fan, Hyde fan, or Wang Lee fan, although Gackt's grace and talent are unexpressable, and I don't feel like I am doing the film justice.  It is just something that one must experience to understand and appreciate.  Nevertheless, it is a must have for anyone that is interested in this genre.

I have to say I was pleasantly surprised by this movie and the acting of all the main players. The movie centers on Kei (Gackt) and Sho (Hyde), hope I didn't get those backwards, and how they go through life together. Kei finds Sho when he's a kid, and eventually Sho becomes Kei's teacher and friend. The movie was written by Gackt, which just shows how talented the man is, because this movie is far from boring like many other vampire flicks.

HYDE did a good job acting.  If you've seen his live performances, he practically has to ""act"" to the song and be expressive anyway.  His facial expressions and voices were very convincing, and I practically forgot that he's a singer, not an actor.

Gackt didn't do a good job acting, I mean I was aware that he's not a pro actor.  But he did a decent job, better than some other singers I've seen.

Some of the gun scenes were kinda wierd looking, but the rest of this movie was pure brilliance.",1184457600,2,714,4.5234375
2035113,4,B0001WTWII,"My daughter is a big fan of Japanese music; so I watched this with her.  Hyde is a major rock star with his band L'Arc-en-Ciel and solo CDs.  Gackt is a major rock star from two bands, Cain's Feel & Malice Mizer.  Wang Lee Hom is also famous, but his music isn't as favored in my household!  In this movie, they all do a good job.  Director Takahisa Zeze's 6th feature after some not released in the U.S. (""Dog Star,"" ""Rush,"" ""Hysteric"") keeps an intricate plot clear, spans a period of years in classic episodic structure, and creates a science fiction world of 2014 in a place Mallepa where Japanese refugees have gone to find work after the economic collapse of Japan.  Hyde plays Kei, a blond Japanese vampire who befriends a little boy.  The little boy grows up and is played by Gackt Camui with what is actually excellent range.  We see the young man who is wild and nonchalant and then skip forward in years where he is in charge.  Gackt makes the character transition significant and believable.  Taro Yamamoto plays their friend Toshi and won a supporting actor award at a festival.  Wang Lee Hom who has done more film (""Starlit High Noon,"" ""Lust Caution"") plays the good-looking friend who winds up on the other side of the yakuza and battles to the last bullet.  Yi-Che is his sister played by Zeny Kwok who marries Sho & later dies of a fatal illness.  I guess the wardrobe for Kei and Sho is Japanese rock star mode.  I thought it made them look effeminate, which was a particularly inappropriate choice since one of the main themes of the film is the bond between these two men.  The story doesn't indicate that this is a gay vampire or a gay protege, but the clothes make you wonder if there's something between the lines not on the screen.  Meanwhile Wang Lee Hom looks like he could have walked out of Las Vegas.  Other than costumes, Zeze combines the elements of vampires, science fiction & Japanese mafia into an entertaining film.

Gackt-sama and Hyde-sama were excellent in this and played their respective parts very well. Absolute movie naturals. Being a fan of both really bears no weight on my review, although it doesn't hurt. Knowing the real-life friendship that they have, it came across in ""Moonchild"" supremely well. I would recommend this movie to anyone who likes and enjoys not only these two talented individuals, but also sci-fi/horror type movies.

2035115,4,B0001WTWII,"Moon Child is a very recommended movie, though it includes very cheesy gunfights and wars between the mafia, but if you like those things in a movie, then this is the right movie for you.

Gackt, Hyde, and Wang Leehom, though they aren't actors and have never been, play an amazing role in this movie.

Hyde's dramatic acting makes his vampire character, Kei, very believable, and gives this movie a very dark and sad enviroment.

Gackt plays Sho, Kei's best friend. He meets him as a child and grows up with him(more like grows on his own, since Kei doesn't age).

Leehom Wang plays Son, a man in search for revenge of the raping of his younger sister, Yi-Che. He meets Sho and Kei and they inmediately become friends, sharing pain and happiness with them.

Moon Child focuses very much on their tight bond with each other, on Sho and Kei's love for the same woman, and the problem that unequality in races brings.

Wang Leehom in American born, but his chinese sounds very well pronounced, and although Gackt is Japanese, his chinese is also quite fluent.

All three of them are originally singers, HUGE in Japan and Taiwan, and this is their first movie, a huge turning point in their career. I personally think they did a great job as actors.

Definitely recommended for the beautiful message it sends.",1167782400,4,1306,4.647826086956521

Like many, I thought it was just them ""cashing in on their popularity."" Most movies musucians make don't turn out too well. I'd hate to give away the plot or anything, but I would definetly recomend seeing it wether your a fan of Hyde and Gackt or not.",1166832000,6,528,4.135922330097087

But don't totally bomb this movie because it's not all that bad. It's ripped off of other movies (somewhat Matrix like), yes, but not completely. There is individualism for this movie and I think it will stay in the books for a while.

So if you are a fan of Gackt or Hyde I strongly recommend it, but if you're a hardcore critic I strongly recommend that you don't because you're not going to find an Academy Award for this.

2035142,5,B0001WTWII,"I must admit I bought this movie because it has Gackt in it.  However, I think even those who are not fans of Gackt or HYDE can appreciate this movie.  But first you must understand the story was written by Gackt, and he is a very unique individual.  Initially the storyline is a bit confusing, and maybe even slow, but after a bit of watching you become attached to the characters, and realize the plotline is ultimately about their relationships with each other.

Or you can just take it at face value, where an orphan and a vampire extort money from bad guys using drugged pizza, then fall for a cute Taiwanese painter.

The subtitling on this version is not very good however, so it can be bit confusing at parts, especially if you can't tell the difference between spoken Japanese and Mandarin Chinese.  While it seems like this would be obvious, for some people it might be hard to listen to what language they are speaking in as well as read the subtitles at the same time.  There are also a few lines in English (which are not subtitled) that are really hard to understand, especially's Gackt's ninja line.  These parts are really just humor though, and not relevant to the storyline.

Overall I found this to be a great film, and have shown it to non-Gackt fans who liked it also.  In the words of my sister, ""it's a lot better than I thought it would be.""",1155340800,6,1365,4.445783132530121

I think Gackt and Hyde were great actors, although Hyde needed a push to get on the set because he was afraid he couldn't act well enough. I especially like the song they did together for the soundtrack, which is also cool, by the way!!!

Although a lot of people feel that this movie doesn't even have a plot . . . my opinion is that it just has many plots . . . or many themes . . . You just have to find them all.

I wouldn't recommend this for younger audiences though . . . I mean, like if you don't want your kids to see all the violence and learn how to swear in three different languages!!!

Overall, this movie goes in my favorites because it's got everything I look for in a movie: action, Japanese, comedy, drama . . . you name it, you'll probably find it here!

Favorite part: The look on Gackt's face when Hyde tosses him a cigarrete and he finally catches it between his fingers. ""Pretty cool, huh?""",1153526400,4,1154,4.088495575221239
2035144,3,B0001WTWII,"Despite having a name that sounds like a cat coughing up a hairball, Gackt is a bishounen, or ""beautiful boy"" with genuine acting chops.  He is a tall drink of water it is hard to tear your eyes from.

The setting for Moon Child is the future.  The city is called Maleppa.  The time, place, and sets are similar to the TV series Dark Angel.  Moon Child's story centers around a group of street-tough friends, four guys and a girl, Yi-Che.  One of the guys, Kei, is a vampire.  Only Sho knows his secret.  Another is the Yi-Che's brother.  Yi-Che is shy and does not speak, but Sho (Gackt) falls hard for her nonetheless.  The guys are caught up in crime and trying to rip off other gangs.  This proves very dangerous.  Soon the group falls apart.

The first half of the movie moves very fast; the second half very slow.  Regardless, the movie was better than I thought it would be.  One thing I took away is the fact that no matter how much you think they will last forever, good times with your buddies never do.

Extras are really disappointing.  Subtitles are only available in English, and the soundtrack is foreign.  The only extras on the DVD are trailers and a few photos stills.  If Gackt is a pop star, how about an interview or a short bio?",1150848000,4,1250,4.356521739130435

2035150,5,B0001WTWII,"Moon Child is a movie that not only features Gackt as the leading role (Sho) but it was also written by the mega artist.  You really don't need to know anytihng about Gackt's stance on the movie to understand the powerful sense behind it, but it does help.  As most fans know, Gackt entertains the illusion that he is 640+ vampire born in London.  The theme of this movie, although I have not seen it mentioned in previous reviews, is a vampire movie.

The plot isn't your average vampire plot.  There aren't any flowerings of the vampire life.  It clearly protrays the vampire life as being leecherous and unbearable.  There is even a very harsh look at this when we see Kei (HYDE) on a fast, refusing to feed off of the lifes of the corupted business men.  Of course, this scene also sprouts the famous ""OMG! HYDE kissed Gackt!"" squeal. ( The kiss is not a lip kiss, it's a mere comfortaing peck on the top of his head... silly H's. )

The story follows a group of orphans who live in the country of Maleppa, a melting pot for business, immigrants, and drugs.  It could be seen as a ganster movie, but not to the extent other people have said.  As it would be for anyone, life is hard for orphans, and they have to make ends meat, somehow.

The story unfolds beautifully, however, I don't think Gackt should take on acting as a serious career.  There are many tear jerking scenes in this movie that had me balling so much that I had to pause the movie because I couldn't see the T.V. through my tears.  Gackt builds a personal bond between the viewers and the characters so that when anything drastic happens, the viewer can actually feel the pain, happiness, and other emotions that just flow from the screen.

Although this movie has been expressed as a dud, low quality entertainment, and so much more,  it still holds as my favourite movie.  Many viewers pick it up because Gackt is on the front cover, and then watch it for his sake alone, but don't let Gackt blind you from the story.  If you actually watch the movie for what it is and not who is in it, I think you'll find a movie that will stay on your favourites list for a long time.",1139702400,6,2146,4.349246231155779

2035162,5,B0001WTWII,"First off, pay attention to the synopsis and ignore the product description, it's the same one that's on the back of the dvd and it's completely misleading and the reason this movie was such a surprise for me.

Note that, one, I am a Hyde fan but I'm going to be unbiased here because I'm also a fan of movies, a lot of foreign film too.  This movie has pop stars playing main characters, a strange combination of genres (vampire, gangster, sci-fi), and it's directed by an adult film director.  I mention this because, if this movie was released anywhere else, I would never watch it in a million years unless I happened to catch it late at night on a movie channel.  But I still wanted to see Hyde in action, so I watched it with low expectations.  I came out essentially a different person for about an hour or so afterwoods.  The movie was that shocking.

I'll first give you my opinion relative to other movies released.  Bad news first, the plot is for the most part rushed and has no sense of developement or time progression, ie. you get jerked around a lot and it's a little hard to follow.  Some relationships are way too emphasized while others are way too understated.  There was so much potential to develop the characters that ended up wasted in order to move the movie along to some other artifical milestone.  I believe this was because the director, or the producer was too concerned with getting more Hyde/Gackt scenes in for more fan gratification.  With that being said, if they learned their lessons this could make a great TV series.  So many elements of the story left me wanting more.

The good news, and the reason this movie gets 5 stars is because of all it's potential and what we actually saw.  Surprisingly, with all the ""out-there"" elements added into the story, in comes across more like a fable than somebody's imagination run wild.  Sho is played by Gackt, an orphan living in the streets of a immigrant town, being a petty thief along with his brother Shinji and his friend Toshi.  While still a boy he comes across Kei, played by Hyde, who we see earlier in the beginning of the movie lost his fellow vampire friend and I assumed mentor, some years earlier.  Kei has become worn, lonely and weak, but after meeting Sho, ends up saving his life from a gangster and feeding off said gangster.  Even though Sho realizes what he is, he befriends Kei.  The movie continues as Sho and his friends grow older and Kei remains the same.  Because Sho is an orphan, Kei has acted as both a friend and mentor to Sho.

The thing that sets this movie apart is the characters.  Their situations, no matter how cliche, bring about genuine feelings and in turn genuine acting.  One by one, we see changes in Sho's life, happy events, action, excitement and yes, tragedy, and soon Sho becomes just as tortured as the cursed Kei.

There are a lot of underlying themes in this movie that have to be seen, they're not as apparent as they could be.  The vampire aspect works in that here we have a young man, wreckless and wanting, with a mentor and friend that has seen and known everything Sho will ever in his lifetime because of his immortality.  Hyde makes a great performance as a vampire that wishes to be normal, that's trying to live his life this way, with a new friend, but can he?

By the end of the movie I'll admit I was crying, a lot actually, but I also cry over every movie, book, show, commercial what have you, so I don't know if that says much heh.

Either way, if you watch this movie, watch it with an open mind, no expectations.  There are a lot of crazy aspects to the storyline, but they can be overshadowed by the characters and their emotions.

Maybe you'll see what I mean by it possibly making a good tv series. =)

ps. If you think I gave this a crappy review, know that I'm a HUGE fan of Hyde and L'Arc~en~Ciel, there were certain parts I enjoyed solely because of him, but a movie is a movie, no matter who's playing who.

pps.  Stop with the whole yaoi Hyde/Gackt crap.  He met him when he was a kid for dog's sake, bunch of sickos.  And plenty of male pop stars in Japan wear make-up without being gay.  There's not much correlation there.",1136937600,12,4187,4.419060052219321

As for what someone else stated, this movie made me cry so much my eyes were bloodred and my family proceeded to tease me about it for the next two days. If you don't cry, you probably dislike Japan/Gackt/HYDE, or are pretty heartless. I thought the relationship between the girl (I can't remember her name) and Shou seemed awfully lame and/or not believeable. Shou and Kei seemed to have the deepest relationship in the whole movie.

2035164,5,B0001WTWII,"I'm already a fan of Gackt's music, and so when I learned of Moon Child I wasn't expecting much more than for Gackt and HYDE to be eye candy (the same thing I thought of the Bujingai game). However, I was wrong.

First, don't listen to what the DVD cover describes. There's not much in the way of romance, period. Gackt and HYDE show more interest in each other at some points than in the female love interest. In fact, depending on your point of view, one could say that it's lacking on both sides of the spectrum.

There's lots of gunplay, but contrary to other reviews I've read, it's not exactly excessive. I did at one point think ""jeez, do they ever run out of ammo?"", but if you don't think too much about it, you won't have that problem. Some of the action scenes were very nicely executed and are even humourous.

As for the actual acting - HYDE could be a natural actor. The role he plays as the vampire Kei is extremely believable. You can empathize/sympathize with his inner turmoil. Gackt is also believable (not as much so..) as Sho. Sho's a complex character in the sense that his emotions fluctuate so quickly. One moment he's laughing, and the next he's very indignant.

If you're a fan of Gackt, HYDE or both, I highly recommend this. If you're a fan of neither, I still recommend it. You may be surprised to find yourself leaving the movie as a fan.",1128556800,34,1368,4.395256916996048

However some of their behavior and appearances (especially Gackt's) can be a little confusing to those not aware of their personalities.  It's not neccessary to be a fan of theirs to enjoy this excellent movie, but it certainly helps.

The story is essentailly about friendship, betrayal, and redemption.  It focuses on a group of orphans who've grown up together in the fictional country of Maleppa, an industrial inner-city wasteland made up of immigrants and the conflicts that arise from their co-habitation.  Gackt and Hyde give surprisingly great perfomances as Sho and Kei.  Surprising because it's easy to consider this a commercial exploitation of the musicians in order to cash in on their popularity.  Of course, I don't speak Japanese so I couldn't really comment on their line delivery, however I belived the tears and the screams.  The characters show great emotional pain and joy so that's what I'll judge the actors on.",1122163200,33,1042,5.011627906976744

While there are hints that both of them like her, don't expect much in the way of romance...and don't expect them to turn their backs on the visual kei factor...which means there are some hints of shounen ai in this movie. There is very much gunfighting (Gackt is so very pretty with weapons) and violence, but nothing to cry over...and nothing too dramatic or explicit.

When i first saw it i was like I MUST GET IT because of the people in it. I just watched it yesterday hehehe .

Many people [like me] probably just picked this movie up because they're like ""GACKT!!!! HYDE!!! YEEEE!!!"" Hehe but yeah it is actually a pretty good movie, surprisingly!!Especially since many other reviews said it was bad. [grr]

The fact that Hyde plays a vampire makes this gangster action movie different from others. The fight scenes were pretty cool! But nothing really new but it was still kewl. Sometimes funny! I really like this movie a lot !!! Um yah, Ohhh at the end right, deng its so sad!!! I think i was crying!! Yeah even my dog was crying.

Well, this movie was about a guy named Sho [gack-sama!!!] who meets this vampire named Kei [hyde!!!] . Then they meet this other guy but then when they get separated they end up on conflicting sides. Then yeah i don't want to give away the ending.

I thought the acting would suck but it was pretty okae!! Gackt and Hyde are so hot in thie movie. You might get distracted a little hehe :D

2035169,3,B0001WTWII,"This is basically just a ""shoot 'em up"" ganster film, but with a slight twist...

A group a people who live by the gun meet under unusual circumstances.  They become close friends then, because of their violent life-styles, end up throwing their lives away, and even end up pitted against each other.  The twist is that one of the main characters just happens to be a vampire.  He doesn't necessarily go hunting for blood or avoid being hunted by slayers--he's just a faster, stronger gangster who doesn't go outside on a day of lovely weather.

The first half of the movie had some cool gun fights, but after that, things started to get boring.  There was no tangible driving force behind the story, and I kept wondering, ""Where is this movie going?!""  It could have instead been a story about a man who's thirsty, but never bothers to fetch himself a glass of water and therefore dies of thirst, and the plot progression would have been just the same.

Watching this film felt like watching a live-action manga--the kind that *might* fare well as a comic book or animated short, but doesn't carry over well to live-action.  (I think the main factor of success for this film is the fact that there are so many girls crazy for Gackt and Hide who will buy anything they make.)

But, I think Hyde was a great choice for Kei.

If you ever get the chance to see the concert dvd of Gackt's The Sixth Day & Seventh Night tour, do.  In it you will see more of Gackt's amazing ability to make me cry.  Because I cried at the end of Moon Child.  Bring a box of tissues with you when you watch the movie.

I liked the chracters of Sun and Ye-Chi, but they weren't my favorite.  When I saw the movie, I was hoping for more hinting towards a Kei/Sho romance but sadly it was not to be.

 Costumes: Can't say enough about the costumes. You'd have to see it to understand it. Missed 80% of the plot the first time just staring at it. x.x

 Script: More cheesily wonderful lines than you can shake a stick at in the humor parts, and almost tear-jerking in the stretches of story development. The little song that they sing at the end is an actual duet available on Gackt's Crescent album. *shameless promotion*

Yes, this scene would be the Symbolic scene of Moon Child.

Here, Gackt is wearing a long white jacket while James Thomas who plays his right hand man wearing a long black jacket. Both of them look cold and cool. Gackt's pacing up and down. James  stands still holding a pocket watch on his hand. It seems time has stopped at this movement, yet you can feel the wind is roaring, the world is weeping.

""Boss, it's time to go!"" James Thomas breaks the silence.

Slowly, they start their journey, moving toward the chaotic future. This scene states the most important breaking point of Moon Child, which bridge between the past and the destiny of Gackt's character ""Sho"". Gackt's emotionless expression reflects the cruel reality. His acting is magnificent. And,despite playing a supporting role in this movie, James Thomas does add a strong misty atmosphere that Moon Child wishes to portray.

When we talk about John Woo, we immediately think of his symbolic flying doves. For Moon Child, I will always remember this symbolic Quote-- ""Boss, it's time to go!""

I am an immediate fan of Gackt and HYDE, they're charming, great job fellas.  Moon Child is well made and directed with good gun play and special effects too.

2035197,5,B0001WTWII,"Incredibly, this was actually what got me into JRock!  I'd always loved Japanese music, but I mostly stayed on the JPop and anime soundtrack side.  I actually went into this disliking Gackt very much (the details of the Illuminati PV will do that to you) and knowing nothing of Hyde.  After seeing Moon Child, I definitely decided that I needed to know more about Gackt and Hyde.

The movie is set in the future in the slummy city of Mallepa, but doesn't actually have many futuristic details (I was so relieved at this).  Hyde plays Kei, an angsty vampire and Sho (Gackt) is his orphaned street-rat human friend.  It starts out fairly happy with hyper shooting scenes with classic (but nonetheless funny) humor and the given Matrix fast/slow motion effect.  The two meet up with Wang Leehom on his mission to get revenge for his sister.  Kei and Sho both end up falling for the sister, which equals trouble, but luckily not too much (phew).  The first half or so of the movie is happy fun but later it ends up getting pretty angsty.  Any Hyde or Gackt fans will probably end up having a good cry at this movie.

Of course, with two of the biggest rock stars in Japan in the same movie, there has to be a song.  And Orenji no Taiyou (Orange Sun), a duet between Hyde and Gackt, does not disappoint.  The over 9 minute song is beautiful and Hyde and Gackt's voices blend so perfectly that at times it's hard to tell the difference between the two.  Of course, it's already hard enough since they both have huge ranges in their voices.  The genre of the duet (romance) will make Gackt/Hyde yaoi fans drool.

This movie has more than its share of doubters, what with the two main characters being completely newbie actors and Jrockers and the director having a pretty questionable background.  But it turned out beyond expectations.  It reminded me of Interview with a Vampire (also an awesome movie) but for some reason I liked Moon Child more.  It gets a little melodramatic at times, but that's a given with Gackt playing such a big part in the movie and in the making of it.  Hyde, on the other hand, captures his character's subtle nuances so much better than one would expect from a total amateur.  His little monologues are beautiful and I'd have to say, as Lestat, he kicks Tom Cruise's (...).  He's a vampire that you feel sorry for, because he has a conscience and you find yourself relating to his pain.  It was really a wonderful acting job by my favorite jrocker.  Besides, Hyde's a heck of a lot cuter than Tom Cruise!  XD

Definitely recommend this for any fan of Hyde of Gackt.  And if you're not into JRock or even if you don't even like Gackt or Hyde, well, watch it anyway; it'll go a long way in convincing you otherwise.  If you don't judge a movie simply on its casting list, the plot is good enough to keep you interested to say the least.  It's not Oscar material, but totally worth owning and repeated watching.  Especially if you have a stubborn friend who refuses to see the light of JRock...it'll win them over.  ^_^;",1103587200,9,3042,4.4963503649635035

2035199,5,B0001WTWII,"I think that ""Moon Child"" is a very unique moive in many ways. It is not an ordinary vampire movie where the theme is more or less on the lust for the flesh. Yet, it is neither an action gun firing movie where the hero defeats vallain. In fact, many themes coexist in ""Moon Child"" - the struggle between love and hate, friendship and rivalry; the pain of growing up and growing apart; the choice of eternal life and unexpected death upon all human beings; and so many more.

I think that I should state here that I often review movies based on the feelings they gave me rather than the technical things such as plot and character development. Because, after all, we watch movies to search for feelings that are hard to find in reality, not to criticize how the story is written. ""Moon Child"" gave me a very different and somewhat melancholy feeling which doesn't usually exist in the happy Amiercan moives.

I didn't know too much about the cast before I watched the movie, except for Lee Hom Wong who took the role of Ah-Sun. I didn't know anything about Hyde and Gackt, which I think made me less biased in judging the movie. It wasn't until afterwards that I found out that Hyde and Gackt were actually professional singers in Japan. By the way, I think Hyde looks way much better than Gackt who often looks more like a woman than man.

Nonetheless, I think Hyde and Gackt's actings were great. Lee Hom Wong, on the other hand, wasn't as good as the rest of the cast, especially when he was speaking his lines in Chinese. I don't know if it was because the most of the cast were Japanese, or something else, but Lee Hom Wong seemed to have a lot of difficulty in fluently spitting out his lines in Chinese. There always seemed to be a little awkwardness in his accent and tone, which made his acting weird.

I strongly recommend this movie. It's worth watching.",1103068800,27,1864,4.441520467836257
2035230,1,B0001WTWII,"Spoilers follow, of course, so please be warned.

Moon Child peaks about twenty minutes in. The rest is a long, slow, drawn-out swan song of a train wreck that eventually spans about 50 confused and unneccessary years. These jumps in time are extremely sloppy and unnerving.

We are never given time to warm to this film--instead, we're yanked away from developing story time and again by the dreaded ""a few years later..."" subtitle. By the ""Titanic""-level sinking ship that is the climax, this film will have alienated, tormented, bored and depressed the life out of all but the most die-hard of J-Pop fans. Although to be fair, I did get some joy from the final ""Thelma and Louise""-style suicide of Gackt and Hyde's characters. But it was too little, too late.

This movie wanted to be a romance. It wanted to be a true crime flick. It wanted to be an Anne Rice romance. It wanted to be a gritty urban drama. And it occasionally really, really wanted to be the Matrix. And in struggling to go all these different directions simultaneously, it failed to be anything but mediocre.

One star, and that's just because I liked the first 20 minutes and the final 5. Everything else gets NO COOKIES.",1102896000,9,1194,4.671428571428572
2035231,5,B0001WTWII,"I found out about this movie totally by accident.  I was doing research on the Japanese rock star Hyde (who plays Kei, the main vampire character in this movie) and found out that he was in a movie.

Okay, cool! Rock stars in movies are cool...well sometimes.

Watched the movie and was totally taken by the cool action scenes, the comical moments in the film, and darker side of the movie.

The cast is what makes the movie totally interesting.  You have Hyde (Lead singer of L'Arc~en~Ciel) as Kei, vampire who was befriended by the child who saved him. Gackt (Once lead singer or Malice Mizer, now a solo artist) as Sho, the kid who saved Kei. Leehom Wang as the rival to Sho's gang (Chinese-American Pop Singer). Well I have yet to find out where the girl Zenny comes from, but she plays the generic female role as Leehom's sister who is mute.

Nevertheless, the movie flows logically through time and you see how the characters grow through the years, especially Gackt's and Leehom's characters.

It's a movie about friendships and how things change through time, for better or for worse.

I suggest watching the movie at least once.  The second time around, I caught a lot more of the underlying themes and  details that the director put in so carefully.

This movie is a must have for anyone who enjoys dramas or action movies.

In addition, the theme song that is sung over and over again by various characters in the film, ""Orenji no Taiyo"" is one of the best songs!  Buy the Cresent album by Gackt to hear the full version with Gackt and Hyde!!  or just look up the translated lyrics. Great song sung by two great vocalists...

Oh, and at the end of MoonChild: Have any of you seen ""The Returner""? Does the girl look familiar to you??",1100649600,2,1743,4.523961661341853

The emotional rollercoaster that this movie takes you on is worth every second. The story is deep; sad, happy, exciting, everything you could want for in a movie is in this film that Gackt wrote. He truly has a wonderful writing talent. I think that this is the perfect way for him to complete his Moon story.

There are not enough words in any language to truly convey how wonderful this movie really is no matter how long a review I write, but I hope that this at least inspiers you to see this moving film.",1100044800,,692,4.2748091603053435
2035233,5,B0001WTWII,"Reading the blurb on the back of the DVD, I expected this to be a vampire/action flick, and while there is plenty of action, it is first and foremost a drama. I wanted to add that I had not heard of the leads before; apparently they are popular rock stars in Japan. I intend to check out their music when I have time.

The plot is intriguing. The film follows the lives of several street urchins. The two boys work together to steal so that they can provide for themselves. One of them comes across a severely wounded vampire and saves his life and is rewarded by being turned into a vampire. The rest of the movie then deals with the interplay and relationships between several humans and one vampire, all of whom are friends.

The vampire role is not glorified. To the contrary, the vampire considers it a curse because he has to live off the lives of others, which he loathes so much that he often does without feeding on humans for extended periods of time. He also doesn't like the idea that he will outlast his friends. But it comes in handy in their life of crime.

As they grow older,a love triangle develops between the woman, whom they have known since she was a street urchin, and the two boys who are now men. We also watch as their life of crime escalates into full-scale armed robbery. The non-vampire's brother, who has a pizza store, delivers drugged pizza to the business they plan to rip-off. He always seems to mess up though, by not putting enough drugs to knock out the guards or by delivering too late. This of course provides a pre-text for some good gun battles.

During the robbery of a local organized crime gang, they meet and team up with a Taiwanese kid whose out for revenge after the gang raped his sister. He then becomes part of the group of friends and we see them hanging out together as young adults and having fun at the beach in the moonlight. These ""fun years"" are important because as they grow older, the drift apart and become harder and more cynical.

Eventually the Taiwanese leaves to join the local Taiwan mafia and ""be with his own people"", the non-vampire marries the woman and they have a daughter, the brother with the pizza business becomes the owner of a bar, and the vampire becomes more cynical. The relationships become more complex as they grow older and the film's real strength is in watching the complexity of the relationships evolve with the added twist that one of them is a vampire.

I don't want to give away the ending but it is very poignant and the movie is full of very deep and touching scenes. This is one of the most interesting and unusual films I have watched in a long time and I HIGHLY reccomend it.",1099785600,2,2674,4.435845213849287
2035234,4,B0001WTWII,"The set-up, in 50 words or less: Adorable street orphans innocently assist a vampire, who then joins their cute little gang and looks out for them as they grow up. But the streets get meaner as the kids get older. Gun-fu and blood-sucking ensue.

Fifteen minutes into this film, my beloved declared it, ""The greatest movie ever made. Ever. About anything."" We agreed (to my frank surprise) that we adored all the androgynous Asian guys in their ultra-mod clothes and eyeliner; we laughed out loud at the boys' antics; and we were mutually besotted with Kei -- the gosh-darned cutest vampire that ever did kick ass in the future while wearing an oversized Members Only jacket.

Kei-as-resident-vampire was a flawless interpretation of ""Armand"" from Interview with the Vampire. Oh God, but he was perfect. The guy looks fifteen, he's heroin-chic skinny, angst-ridden and tough-as-leather-pants when need-be. He's got style, he's got panache ... and he's got Sho, his (you're-not-fooling-anyone, you know) ""friend"" with a passion for vinyl, braids and eye make-up.

And so the movie romps along for the first 35 minutes or so -- guns blazing, mascara running, swishy-coats swishing -- and then ... it stops. What began as a light-hearted, flashy comedy suddenly shifts into a different gear altogether. Woe ensues. Lots and lots of hearty woe. It's interesting woe; it's well-drawn woe; but it's woe, and I didn't get sucked into this movie for woe. By the end of the thing I was positively bitter about all the woe, even though it did try to end on a more or less ""up"" note. Kind of. I guess.

All in all, this was a surprisingly good movie -- if psychologically jarring. The emotional WAY UP HIGH and then DOWN, DOWN, down, *crash* was disconcerting but I can't say it wasn't effective. I only wish that Moon Child could have been either one thing or the other -- a slick supernatural gun-fu flick OR a sad post-modern fable about the dreary hopelessness of life's painful, doomed progression towards death. And doom. With death. And sorrow. With a dash of WOE.

Anyway, if you're game for some intriguing foreign fodder, pick it up. If you'd rather not contemplate misery before bedtime but you need some fangy Asian cheese, leave *Moon Child* on the shelf and grab *The Vampire Effect* instead.",1098921600,3,2295,4.874358974358974
2035235,5,B0001WTWII,"Dont belive the other reviews, that say this movie is bad because it's not. The people that write that say it because they hate Gackt and everything he does.

  Kei (HYDE) is a vampier that losses his ""partner"" and feels alone and hopeless. A young Sho finds him and rescuse him with his friendship. Later on Sho grows old (Gackt) and learns the ways of Kei. They, along with Toshi, Shinji and Son rise as small-time gagsters while living in the streets and killing for sport and survival. Over time, their tight friendship is corrupted because of their rivalry.

  The movie was really intresting, the beggining is very funny and the shot outs are awesome. Whene its about to reach the end it gets slow and depressing. The thing I didn't like was the ending, which fell short for this movie. HYDE and Gackt's acting is awesome, I never expected it to be good. Also, the score is fantastic. If you are a HYDE fan, an L'Arc-en-Ciel fan, Gackt fan or of vampiers, this movie is for you.

I, being a rather large Gackt fan and a long-time follower of LaRuKu, felt this pairing was a dream come true.  What I asked for was a sexy sci-fi vampire romp with plenty of great poses and J-Rocker action, yet what I received was a strong movie of friendship and the search for happiness.

The movie starts strong and keeps on going, yet slows down near the middle when their lives start to fall apart.  Piece  by piece things crumble until the characters manage to sort true happiness from despair and find some order in their lives.

I found the movie ot be a little lacking in some parts, and some of the angst seems very Malice Mizer in nature.  There's a distinct break in the movie where the plot take a major twist, and it leaves watchers wondering exactly what will happen next.

The movie's main plot was very weak at best and the whole thing lacked any sort of cohesion at all.  I would have to describe it as, 'Some guys and an incidental vampire shoot at each other and they all end up dead.'
The whole vampire angle was the only thing that interested me, but it was almost ignored until the last fifteen minutes of the movie.  And when it was finally remembered, it was done in a very cliche manner with the ever-dreaded vampire-angst.  Perfectly willing to gun people down, we still don't like drinking blood.
So, in closing, I would only reccomend it based on a love of Gackt and/or HYDE.  Gackt looked very cute throughout the entire movie and HYDE looked nice most of the time.  If you're just looking for a good movie, don't waste your time here.",1089763200,6,999,4.248677248677248
2035239,5,B0001WTWII,"Moonchild's meaningful and in-depth story unfold in your very eyes as the story progresses. The characters are well developed and the director vividly bring forth their feelings to the audience. Moonchild brings out the best of Gackt Camui. He plays his role excellently in the movie with enough emotions; in contrast to his real personality. In addition to the casts full of gems, fasten your seat belt cause you are in for a ride in one of the best gun fights movie ever. This is, personally speaking, the best movie that has flawlessly put together the elements of drama, sci-fi and action. As for the limited edition set, I do admit that the price is a little steep but i recommend it to every die-hard gackt/hyde fan. The limited edition comes with a nicely compiled set of 3 DVDs. It definitely worth every money!",1088899200,,819,4.694444444444445
2035260,5,B0001WTWII,"I've been a fan of Gackt and Hyde for quite sometime, so hearing that they were doing a movie together I was very excited, even if I had my doubts to their abilities. After finally seeing the movie I can say I am not at all disappointed. Sho and Kei are lovable characters the develop nicely throughout the entire movie. The fight scenes can be funny and are well choreographed. Plot-wise the story was average. It's nothing completely original, but today, what is? I laughed, and cried... okay I cried quite a bit towards the end, but that was refreshing. Gackt and Hyde portrayed their characters so well they can actually move the audience to tears. All-in-all, it's a great movie and worth a look if you like Gackt, Hyde, Vampires, and/or cool gun fights.",1088726400,5,759,4.62962962962963
2035261,4,B0001WTWII,"For years I have been a fan of Hyde and L'arc En Ciel.  When I heard he and Gackt were making a movie, I, like many others here, was concerned that it would turn out poorly but I had hopes.  In American media, actors usually can't sing and singers usually can't act.  However, I have been pleasantly surprised by the versatility of many Japanese talents (can anyone say Kimura Takuya? -- to name but one).  Hyde laid my fears to rest; he was excellent in his role.  Gackt was fun in his, although I felt he was noticably straining and vaguely cartoonish.  They had good chemistry together, though.
As to the movie and its plot.  Artistically it was well shot and looked good (taking the occasional special defects aside).  Plot-wise, it wandered through several genre staples, gangs, vampires, romance and mixed them with only the occasional stutter.  All in all, worth seeing and some of the comedic touches were great!  A stand out in my mind is one of the gun fight scenes where Hyde uses an enemy as a shield and casually ballroom dances around the room trading shots with other enemies as he does so.",1087862400,,1105,4.563451776649746
2035262,5,B0001WTWII,"My fellow Otaku friend talked nonstop about this movie and when it finally came here, I was the first one to get it! As it turned out, the summary for this was all WRONG! My friend and I loved it! Come on what other movie has three hott Japanese and Chinese singers? Singers that can actually ACT? As well as the most hilarious scenes?!(You'll get most of it by just watching Gackt) All together with a great plot and the greatest action moves ever seen?
The story started slow but the action picks up after Sho (Gackt) grew up a bit. (Hey Chibi Gackt is cute too but not as cute a gackt) The best parts were the gang banging scenes but the sadest (and I mean SADEST) scenes were in the end! Many people would hate the ending but I thought it was the perfect ending to it! I cried so hard!
The song and music were both perfect for the movie! So was the clothing! Hyde's loose clothing and Gackt's tight leather pants were such a great mix! (Especially Gackt's white trechcoat)The painting by Yi-Che was fantastic, so was the ones by Hana! I really enjoy the great art in the movie!
All in all the movie is a must-see and a must-have after the must-see! Hyde and gackt weren't even singers, they were the vampire Kei and the gang leader Sho! You would never connect them from the movie to real life. That's how good the whole thing was! I'm really impressed and now I'm a Gackt and Hyde lover! Greastest and hottest guys even thought they're over 30 right now; but hey like Jhonny Depp, we don't mind!",1087776000,3,1500,4.322695035460993
2035263,4,B0001WTWII,"When I heard GACKT and HYDE were making a movie together I nearly dropped dead from laughter! But then when I actually SAW the movie, I was wiping the corners of my eyes! Not from tears of laughter but from tears of emotion!! (and perhapps amazement that THESE two were giving such a relatively GREAT performance!) Though the effects were SciFi channel in quality, the story and direction completely made up for it. In my mind this movie started as a joke but has turned out to be one of my most favorites! Don't let the pop stars fool you! Their on-screen chemistry is much more moving than Gackt's usual seizure dancing. Give it a try! You won't be dissappointed!",1087603200,,665,4.55
2035264,5,B0001WTWII,"You know it'll be a good movie when it's got HYDE [and] GACKT! Being a fan of L'arc-en-ciel and Malice Mizer I wanted to see how my vocalists did as actors. And it was beautiful. Gackt (Sho) started a little rough vs Hyde's 'I've got it under control so CHILL' Kei. Yes, there will be gunfights, but for the most part it is comical (I say that because...). Although Happy Pizza :) is the only thing made clear about the gangs, all will be implied and understood. Yi-che...annoyed me. I don't know why. Her presence just angered me. [shrugs]
You can read the plot (that's what the description is for o.o) but it doesn't go into detail about how Sho is struggling /along with/ Kei. In the end, you will see the (orange glow) light.
If you don't see it because of Gackt and Hyde, if you don't see it because of how =excellent= it turned out, see it because they have this wonderful talent of switching from Japanese to Cantonese (spelled?(...)) to English.

2035265,5,B0001WTWII,"What more could you ask for in a film!!?  :P  Usually singers turn actors don't work out very good.  But Gackt and Hyde just blow away all of that!  This was an astounding movie and the story of love and friendship is a good twist from the yakuza (gang) storyline.  Gackt was sooooo hot in this movie, and he's so funny too!  His facial expressions are just so cute!  And Hyde also does a wonderful job portraying the tortured vampire who doesn't know where he belongs and doesn't like who he is.  Both Gackt and Hyde played their characters so well that sometimes it seemed as if they weren't acting in a movie at all.  The diretor certainly takes the viewer on a roller coaster ride of emotions and keeps your attention the whole time!  From comedy, to action, to gun blasting excitement, to sadness,  this movie is just one you have to see!  And beleive me, it will quickly become one of your favorites!!  It's extremely sad too, I cried my eyes out until I got a headache, lol.  The ending is just perfect for this movie and leaves you wanting more.  Plus after you watch the movie, you can go buy all of Gackt's cd's and listen to what a good singer he is too!!  Definetaly the best movie I've ever seen (and not just because Gackt's in it, even thought that is one of the main reaons, Lol).",1086998400,2,1296,4.3153526970954355
2035266,5,B0001WTWII,"First off...yes, I am a Gackt and HYDE fan, as many people are. However, before I saw it, I did have a lot of doubts about the film. Yes, Gackt and HYDE are great singers (and hot to boot :P)--but they're singers, not actors, and how many films in the USA featuring singers as actors have royally sucked? Virtually all of 'em.
So, yes, my expectations were low. But I wanted to see it anyway, curious fan that I am.
Needless to say, my initial expectations were quickly blown to dust, and Gackt and HYDE quickly ceased being Gackt and HYDE in my mind--they really became Sho and Kei.
Moon Child is an excellent film, and has quickly become one of my favorites. For one, the stress on the film was character development and the relationships between each character, not excessive violence like in typical gangster flicks. And yes, there is a vampire, Kei...but unlike typical vampire movies, the focus isn't on Kei being a vampire--it adds to the story, rather than infringes on it. And homo-eroticism? Bah. Personally, I saw none of that present. The relationship between Kei and Sho is more like that of a father and son, which is communicated quite frequently throughout the story (if you pay attention).
Overall, it's an excellent film that will take you on a rollarcoaster ride of emotions--the film really knows how to manipulate a viewer, taking them from amusement to shock to anger to sadness. And, while I don't cry much in movies, this film had me bawling in the end. I even showed it to my mom, who was a bit reluctant to see it...and she also loved it and was brought to tears.
I recommend it to anyone!",1086220800,3,1615,4.572413793103448
2035267,5,B0001WTWII,"Before you start watching this film, if you have heard of either Hyde or Gackt..then forget you did. Yes both superstars are amazing, beautiful and talented individuals but this movie deserves more than just drooling.
The storyline is a moving tale of friendship and growth. It is not only intense and emotional, but light hearted at times and fun. Each character, more especially the six main characters, the circle of friends Sho, Kei, Yi-chi, Son and Toshi, plus Sho's brother Shinji, is incredibly well developed and brought into the plot.
Although the story does take on the three act seperation that many action/gang/mafia movies do, Moon Child manages to twist and turn smoothly between them. And though a vampire is present in the movie, the story does not revolve around the vampire being a vampire.. it is a story about love, loyalty, destiny and friendship.
This is a must see, for so many more than just Gackt and HYDE fans..though be prepared to cry, because this fantastic film will take you on a maelstrom of emotion from one scene to the next. The soundtrack is a wide range of styles and fits perfectly with the shifting mood present.
All in all not only packing a serious (thoughy at times cheesy) action punch but also a tear jerking wonderfully acted array of dialogue scenes that will leave you reaching the end wanting to start all over again.
Watch and Enjoy, for what it is. A journey.",1085270400,3,1409,4.755102040816326
