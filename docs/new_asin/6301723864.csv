8220539,5,6301723864,"The story of the lovable absent minded hunter was never better told than in this Shirley Temple version. The acting and the historical perspective make for a very enjoyable children's story which will surely spark questions about pirates, King George III and the American Revolution. There is a sweet cadence to the delivery which is endearing and patently missing from children's programming in our very enlightened 21st Century. Watch this for the lessons it teaches about being a good father and a good husband.",1279670400,,514,5.130952380952381
