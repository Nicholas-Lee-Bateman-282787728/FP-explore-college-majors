8629390,5,B000NQRS9W,One of the best overall dance fitness videos on the market.  Lisa is excellent and the exercises really helped me loose weight and were really fun.  Was a great workout and plan to get her other programs!  Thank you Lisa!,1417305600,,221,4.475
8629391,5,B000NQRS9W,"I agree wholeheartedly with Colleen M. Schneider's earlier review of this DVD; it's an extremely fun and versatile way to work out.  Lisa Nunziella has combined cardio and strength training elements into one workout that is effective while also being enjoyable!

Lisa, as always, is a flawless instructor; she cues perfectly and includes a separate breakdown of her dance section so that you don't have to constantly slow down to re-learn the moves of the dance workout.  She exhibits high energy and really encourages the viewer to get off the couch and move!

The production of the workout is also high quality.  The menu gives you the option to view the DVD nearly any way you want to; the background is vibrant; and the music is enjoyable, which is pleasantly different from most workout videos.  In addition to the wonderful music, at some points a live drummer is playing in the background which adds to the beat and atmosphere.  Not one bad thing can be said about anything related to the production of the DVD.

As for the workout itself...

WARM UP - 10 Minutes - The warm up is rather lengthy, but it definitely gets you rearing and ready to exercise.  You start with some dancey step touches and slides before going into basic stretching and yoga.  A few of the yoga moves were a bit sculpting, meaning that you truly do begin this workout in the warm up.

DANCE - 12 Minutes - Unlike most of Lisa's previous workouts that are Latin, this dance workout has more of a jazz funk feel...almost like her&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dance-with-Lisa-Hip-Hop-Cardio-Made-Simple/dp/B000BYW6Y8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dance with Lisa: Hip Hop Cardio Made Simple</a>.  The moves are very stylized and very challenging; this is NOT an easy dance workout for beginners.  This is a dance workout for intermediate/advanced exercisers who have even slight dance experience and are ready for a challenge.  This section is highly cardio and is a blast to perform.

SCULPT - 10 Minutes - This section has two parts: a balletic standing half and a pilates floor half.  The balletic standing section has you doing a lot of plies and pointing of the feet.  Nothing is extremely challenging, but Lisa does move quickly.  It focuses on the lower body.  You then move onto mat work that mostly consists of typical pilates moves such as bicycles.  This half seemed to focus more on the abs.  While it also moved quickly, I found it to be a bit more challenging than the first half yet still quite intermediate.

STRENGTH TRAINING - 8 Minutes - Like Sculpt, the first half of this section is standing while the second half is on the floor.  Most of the moves are more athletic as opposed to balletic.  You will do lunges, push ups, tricep dips, and more.  It was probably the least dancey of all the workouts, but it was very challenging.  There is a plank sequence that I can't complete...yet.  The toning emphasis is total body: legs, arms, and abs.  No weights are used, but I still think it's a pretty intermediate workout.

COOL DOWN - 9 Minutes - This section is very similar to the warm up, only with more variety of stretches and more repetitions of yoga moves.  I felt like all of the muscles that I had worked were sufficiently stretched out.  This was a fantastic ending to a marvelous workout.

EXPLAIN THE STEPS - Lisa breaks down 1 8-count at a time from the Dance section and teaches the moves to you slowly twice.  You may have to do this section several times before you can master the Dance section, but once you do master it, there's no more slowing down to learn the steps.

BEHIND THE SCENES - This is kind of a pointless section of the DVD.  A camera follows Lisa and her crew around for about three minutes, taking footage of them putting on makeup, talking amongst themselves, and doing silly dance moves backstage.

Overall, I love this workout!  I've never been disappointed with Dance with Lisa workout, and I will continue to buy them.  I highly recommend this DVD to intermediate/advanced exercisers who are confident that they can learn a tricky dance routine.  This is NOT a video for beginners; I can't stress that enough.

8629392,4,B000NQRS9W,"I have three other Dance with Lisa workouts, Salsa, SalsaII, 5 day Latin dance, and this is my fourth addition to my collection of workouts by Lisa Nunziella.

There are several things that I like about all of Lisa's videos that don't seem to change:  Her cuing is excellent, her form is impeccable and she knows the subject matter.  Unlike many workouts that slow the workout to a crawl at the beginning to show you the steps, she includes a separate section that is called ""explain the steps"", she breaks down each step and goes through it twice, slowly, so that you can understand the basics and have it slow enough to follow.  This is very good because then you can just go straight through the workout at full tempo once you have the steps without having to slow down at all.  I would highly recommend doing that section first, because you will probably still not have the steps on the first try.  This one took me about 5 tries to completely have the steps down, and I do dance workouts often.  I like the fact that I can continue to practice and then play the work-out and hopefully catch on to another move that I didn't quite have down the day before.

This workout is different than her others in the fact that it is more of a modern/jazz type on the dance section.  I loved the moves, but it easily could have had about 10 more minutes of routine to really be more to my liking.

The workout is broken down into several segments: warm-up (about 11.5 minutes), Dance (11 minutes-too short in my opinion), Sculpting (9 minutes), Strength (8 minutes) and cool down (9 minutes), which is a bit under 50 minutes for the entire workout.

The dance is my favorite, and though the moves looked challenging at first a few times through the ""explain the steps"" section and doing the workout a few days and I was starting to ""get it"".  Sculpting workout & strength workout can be viewed together or as part of the enire workout and work well with each other.  In these segments you will notice some pilates moves for abs, some yoga moves (down dog), and plies from dance, as well as pushups and tricep dips.

I found that the workout, though not long, was a good workout, I got a little aerobic, some abs and arms in, and felt great afterwards.  This will definitely be in the rotation for a while as many workouts are aerobic or strength only and I liked the combination of all three.

If you have done Lisa's videos before this one is a little different, but I liked it very much and you probably will too.  If you are looking for something that combines several different types of exercise, this one might be something to just put a little different spin to your next workout.

Dance with Lisa and get your body into shape and have a little fun while you are at it!",1202342400,17,2768,4.415354330708661
