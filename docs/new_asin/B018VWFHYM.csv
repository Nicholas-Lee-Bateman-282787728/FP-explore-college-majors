7558931,5,B018VWFHYM,"Interesting if your a royal watcher, follower or simply just curious",1473552000,2,68,5.2727272727272725
7558932,3,B018VWFHYM,Good documentary. A lot of it was pulled from a previous documentary made for the Queen's Diamond Jubilee.,1473465600,,106,4.944444444444445
7558933,3,B018VWFHYM,"These seem to be the very same interviews I've seen before in other Royal Family videos, just chopped up a bit differently.",1473465600,,123,4.636363636363637
7558934,5,B018VWFHYM,A very nice show on some of the princes.  Would have liked if they included Andrew & Edward,1473465600,4,91,4.055555555555555

7558936,2,B018VWFHYM,"Rehash of old news footage, neiter informative nor particularly entertaining.",1472774400,,77,6.8
7558937,1,B018VWFHYM,"Very biased representation of the royal family and in particular Charles.  I had to laugh when one of the talking heads claimed that Charles had done everything to make Diana happy, that she just ""couldn't be happy.""  Yeah, he did everything he could except give up his mistress, Camilla, which is what the source of Diana's unhappiness was to begin with.  British dimwits.",1471910400,5,373,4.888888888888889
7558938,3,B018VWFHYM,So many of these videos are the same footage rearranged to fit the title...but as you watch them you realize that you are seeing the same thing over and over again,1485302400,,163,4.290322580645161

7558959,5,B018VWFHYM,"I eNjoyed this documentary.  I learned some history.  I always thought Prince Charles was treated badly in the press.  The pressure on royals to marry to suit the throne is tough.  I hope Prince Charles is happy now with Camilla and that Prince William and Kate can have a halfway normal life and be happy.  I would encourage everyone to see this.  It was a little slow, but very informative.",1479772800,2,392,4.5285714285714285

7558961,4,B018VWFHYM,"For those of us who can't seem to get enough of the British royal family, this is delightful. We found out some things especially about Prince Philip, Lord Mountbatten, and Prince Charles that were new to us.",1479254400,2,208,4.648648648648648

7558970,4,B018VWFHYM,Very Informative,1477958400,,16,7.5
7558971,1,B018VWFHYM,"Definately PR for the royals.  Put down Princess Diana as a problem and embarrassment.  Prince Charles infidelity treated as a good thing, Camilla as the ""wronged"" woman.  The Queen comes off as a stuffy and cold/unemotional and distant absentee parent.",1477785600,8,253,5.275
7558972,5,B018VWFHYM,Excellent,1477612800,,9,9.0

7558978,5,B018VWFHYM,Great watching if you are interested in British Royalty,1476662400,,55,5.222222222222222
7558979,5,B018VWFHYM,The royal family is ever a fascinating subject and this included lots of wonderful footage and still photos.  I still hurt in my heart for Wills and Harry over the loss of their mother but the nurturing she gave them is so evident in the wonderful young men that they have become...the Queen sets such a high standard of duty and that comes across once again in this most recent documentary.,1476576000,,391,4.507042253521127
7558980,5,B018VWFHYM,A detailed history of the princes of the royal family. A very interesting and worthwhile movie.,1476489600,,95,5.0

7558982,4,B018VWFHYM,Being English this was familiar territory but still found it informative and well presented,1476489600,,91,5.571428571428571

7558992,5,B018VWFHYM,Rather interesting for an American. This way of life is truly foreign to us but fascinating. I am glad we do not have princes but for the British this video makes their attitudes understandable.,1476057600,,194,4.735294117647059
7558993,5,B018VWFHYM,Very informative,1475971200,,16,7.5
7558994,5,B018VWFHYM,It was a down to earth look at the royals as real people. Enjoyed it.,1475798400,,69,3.6666666666666665
7558995,3,B018VWFHYM,"I was wanting to see how that Kingdom worked, I don't believe in Royal Blood in a human.",1475625600,,88,3.9444444444444446

7559000,4,B018VWFHYM,I thoroughly enjoyed watching this and would watch it again. I understand it was the princes of the palace but I would have enjoyed learning more about Edward and Andrew but then I guess the title would change to the Princes of Windsor or some such inclusive name.,1475539200,,264,4.520833333333333
7559001,2,B018VWFHYM,A little boring,1475452800,,15,4.333333333333333
7559002,5,B018VWFHYM,It was very interesting.,1475366400,,24,5.25

7559005,5,B018VWFHYM,Love,1474934400,,4,4.0
7559006,5,B018VWFHYM,I do like to watch movies about royals when I'm too tired to read...this one was well organized and had a few new facts.  I enjoyed it.,1474848000,,135,4.0
7559007,3,B018VWFHYM,"While there was very little new information, it was interesting to have a program that focused on just the five princes. The photos, videos and interviews were very good.",1474848000,,170,4.896551724137931
7559008,4,B018VWFHYM,I enjoy stories of the Royal Family,1474848000,,35,4.142857142857143
7559009,5,B018VWFHYM,good watch,1474675200,,10,4.5
7559010,4,B018VWFHYM,Interesting but didn't go into enough depth.,1474675200,,44,5.428571428571429
7559011,5,B018VWFHYM,A very interesting and compassionate overview of the men of the Royal family.,1474588800,,77,5.0
7559012,4,B018VWFHYM,"Some interesting points, but mostly a rehash of stuff most people (not living under a rock) already know.  I enjoyed it, but didn't love it.",1474416000,,140,4.6
7559013,4,B018VWFHYM,Good,1474416000,,4,4.0
7559014,4,B018VWFHYM,Good info on the princes which I hadn't seen before,1474243200,,51,4.2
7559015,3,B018VWFHYM,I found it interesting because I like most movies about the British royal family. I find the older generation much more interesting than the youngsters but all in all worth seeing if you like the subject.,1474243200,,204,4.694444444444445
7559016,5,B018VWFHYM,enchanting,1474156800,,10,10.0
7559017,5,B018VWFHYM,I have always been fascinated with the Royals and this did not disappoint...very well done.,1474156800,2,91,5.133333333333334
8743161,4,B018VWFHYM,new blood is creating a kinder gentler monarchy,1527379200,,47,5.0
8743162,2,B018VWFHYM,Its not a bad documentary but many of the clips are recycled and a lot of the family commentary is fluffy and overly glowing.  Theres also a more than subtle attempt to portray Diana as troubled despite the family being as supportive as possible.  Not exactly the way it was reported at the time...,1525910400,,298,4.5
8743163,4,B018VWFHYM,I'll probably watch it again. I have a facination with the Monarchy especially the rein of Queen Elizabeth II. Her grandsons aren't the main focus of this one but rather Prince Charles and good points for once.,1525305600,,210,4.702702702702703
8743164,1,B018VWFHYM,"It seemed like a poor excuse of a poor Charles documentary, not worth your time.",1505174400,,80,4.4
8743165,2,B018VWFHYM,A bit boring as it's VERY pro the perspective of the royal family and doesn't really go into the aspects of how they were shaped both in their early lives and during their adult lives.,1498003200,2,184,4.285714285714286
8743166,4,B018VWFHYM,"Nice to hear about the male side of the British royal family, especially one right after the other so as to see the similarities and differences between them and how the world and family has shaped these future Kings.",1496361600,2,217,4.589743589743589
8743167,3,B018VWFHYM,"This is all stuff that has been pieced together from other pieces of documentation. If you don't know anything about the Princes, you would learn a lot from this. If you are already Royal Watchers, you've probably seen it all already. It's well put together,",1494115200,2,258,4.7555555555555555
8743168,2,B018VWFHYM,"Just a PR video supporting the royal family. Actually blamed Diana for being a cry baby. Disgusting group of pedophiles, the lot of them. I thought this was going to be more historical, but it was just a constant blame game and pity party. Oh, the poor Queen. Oh, poor Prince Charles wasn't loved by his parents, and then didn't get the support he needed from Diana. Oh, his poor kids having a mother like Diana. Oh, poor Prince William having a hard time finding a wife. Oh, poor Prince Harry with his drug and alcohol problem because he'll never be king. This should have been titled ""Victim Princes"". The people are starving and dying in the streets. Veterans are being denied basic care. Not too many people feel ""sorry"" for any of the 'royal' family anymore. I gave this video two stars, because the film admitted that the Windsor family is Nazi German, not English.",1493424000,4,871,4.589743589743589
8743169,5,B018VWFHYM,Excellent ----but a little long ---but I watched it to the end nbd wished there were more about  Prince Andrew and I cannot remember thenameof the youngest  brother.,1486339200,,165,4.857142857142857
8743170,3,B018VWFHYM,Good but not exciting and repeated itself often,1485907200,,47,5.0
