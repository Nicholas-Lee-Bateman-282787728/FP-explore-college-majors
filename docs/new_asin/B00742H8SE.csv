8509582,5,B00742H8SE,"Spectacular reproduction.  Great color.  This is an adorable movie, featuring an adorable couple - Marge and Gower Champion. I'm so glad that it is finally available.  The movie showcases the enormous talents of the Champions in a very light-hearted movie about marital challenges, ending on a happy note (whew!).  The Champions brought sheer magic and excellence to everything they did.  There IS nothing like them - before, during or after.",1455926400,9,442,5.257142857142857

8509584,5,B00742H8SE,"I wish that someday, I may own this film on DVD or on any sort of media. I casually tuned in to TCM one day and ended up watching what became a magical voyage for me of music and dance that I shall never forget. I was foolish not to record this movie on my DVR device. I feel honored to be a 20 year old who enjoys these movies. Please, Amazon or WB studios please bring this movie back to DVD or blu-ray disc. I would buy it in a heartbeat and I'm sure many other people would as well around the world. Keep these beautiful masterpieces alive for generations to come.",1391472000,6,568,4.035398230088496
8509585,5,B00742H8SE,"This is a typical Dance story for the 50's. If you like Marge & Gower, which I do, you will like this movie. Their married & dance partners then she gets pregnant & can't dance any more so he gets a new partner. It is great while they are still dancing together. She is worried they he is getting too close to his new partner.",1341619200,3,326,4.030769230769231
