5851432,5,B00DRQEU9Q,"Eugene Ashe has created a film that is contemporary and honest in its portrayal of a cast of unpretentious, believable, well developed characters. Get ready for an emotional roller coaster ride.  You will laugh and you will cry.  The film has an interesting twist and with each action, the plot thickens until there is a climactic explosion of pure emotion. This is one that you don't want to miss.",1382918400,2,398,4.753623188405797

5851454,1,B00DRQEU9Q,This movie was pretty boring. Once the end came I was pretty happy.  Actually the dead guy that they referenced... it would have been nice to see him more in the moving because he was such an intregal part of the storyline.,1393200000,,223,4.309523809523809
5851455,4,B00DRQEU9Q,"This movie does not hv ur typical homecoming fare complete with tailgating,  stepshow, and parade.  This is a story of redemption and starting over.  For some reason it drags a little, transitions are not smooth but the actor gave solid performances. I will add that anyone can relate to the characters  and their situations. I saw this on Google play.",1390694400,,352,4.816666666666666
5851456,4,B00DRQEU9Q,"This film started out a bit slow and low-budget ish, but quickly picked up in acting, theme and direction. A bit too much profanity and ghetto-style from the characters for me, but as a graduate of an historically black college, the story really resonated. I enjoyed the film and was pleased that it gained momentum after a lackluster beginning.",1389571200,3,345,4.864406779661017
5851457,5,B00DRQEU9Q,"What a delight to have watched, ""The Homecoming"" directed by Eugene Ashe, which debuted on film in October.  Often we see African Americans in movies that portray slapstick comedy or movies about underprivileged blacks rising to farfetched pinnacles.  This is a down to earth film about four college students returning for a reunion after twenty years.  I first saw the film in New York when it premiered, again at a movies night party, and at home in a quiet setting.  After watching the movie for the third time I had the chance to scrutinize the film from different viewpoints.  The music was excellent which transitioned between scenes using nostalgic ragtime to music written by Mr. Ashe himself, who is also a noted musician.  The plot was true to life and the actors made the story come alive, which makes it not your ordinary reunion movie.  Like every reunion movies we have seen there is usually a point to be taken.  As the plot unfolds, Mr. Ashe made his characters make you laugh when Abby proved her heritage, hate Robert for the seduction of Lesley, yearn to be in either Barrett or Deena's shoes, to shedding tears when Hill and Lesley shared their tender moment.  And how many people can attest to having to decide whether to juggle a relationship while obtaining an education.  The whole movies is based on choices that were made by these individuals, and how they realized that maybe the paths they had ventured were not the best choices after all.  This is a must see movie, one would not be disappoint.  You will laugh, cry, and learn that in order to transcend in life, one must learn to let go of demons to be able to move forward.",1387497600,6,1654,4.626712328767123
