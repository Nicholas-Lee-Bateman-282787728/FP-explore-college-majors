8151511,5,B000JKA3SA,"To me, This documentary is absolutely engaging, easily holding up to multiple views. one of the best ultra low budget, self produced films I've seen.  I came upon this one in an ass backward sort of way considering I wasn't particularly familiar with the music of Dead Moon, but they are from my hometown and I did some shopping at their Tombstone Music store in my early 20's. Fred and Toody always seemed like extremely interesting people even before I had any idea who they were. The most fascinating thing about the film(and the Cole's) is the fierce do it yourself approach they take in just about every aspect of their lives...inspiring to say the least. The Tombstone Music store has been gone for many years now and the only businesses operating in the ""Ghost Town"" have been a convenience store, a locksmith and  some sort of small deli(???) Recently there have been hand printed signs posted advertising spaces for farmers market vendors. I'm not sure if the Cole's are behind this, or even if they still own the property, but I wish them the best of luck.",1413244800,4,1066,4.664893617021277

8151514,5,B000JKA3SA,"I was lucky enough to see this at a screening in Portland OR., the band's hometown (and mine!).  I sat right behind Fred and Toody, who were smiling the entire time from ear to ear.  That's how I felt as well.  This doc is a must have for any hardcore Dead Moon fan.  And if you are not yet a fan, consider buying their records...NOW.",1170201600,7,334,4.092307692307692
