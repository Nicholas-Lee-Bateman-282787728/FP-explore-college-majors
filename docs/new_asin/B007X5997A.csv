8522814,1,B007X5997A,this dvd did NOT work. very disappointing with the seller!,1529539200,,58,4.9
8522815,5,B007X5997A,"Great movie!  5 Stars & 2 Thumbs Up!  You will like this movie very much if you respect ""honor"" and it shows how an older brother stands up for his younger brother and their family.  Takes place in Great Britain, so it's a region 2 DVD, so you'll have to have the proper DVD player to watch this movie, one that can play region 2 DVDs.  Also, very kind, efficient, fair, and prompt customer service from the delivery service of Prestivo.",1522454400,,437,4.3580246913580245
8522816,4,B007X5997A,"I've been in bed a month after surgery and have run out of Netflix options - ran across this movie. By the cover, I expected it to be an awful teen slasher movie. It actually  turned out to be much more engrossing - with an actual plot line and not too much gore. Not the best ever, but pretty good for  a B movie",1457308800,,313,3.875
8522817,1,B007X5997A,"Dear lord...... The production values may fool you in this hard to believe crapfest! It sure fooled me. A rather long, drawn out movie that ends in confusion. There is no other explanation for this British boredom horror/thrill-less film.

The movie starts out with a house party and some horny twenty somethings babbling about nothing. Booze, drugs and homophobia then commences. The rest of the movie only gets worse. SPOILERS TO COME SO STOP READING IF YOU ACTUALLY INTEND TO WATCH THIS FILTH: The story jumps to these partiers on their way to..... Another party. But it turns out that this won't be a party by most folk's standards. It turns out to be a trick perpetrated by some nerd's brother to lure these people to their certain demise. The reason for this turns out to be pretty ridiculous.

So they all fall victim to this trick and are quickly tied up and forced to play a deadly game of ""truth or dare"". Ohhhh scary, right? You are left to wonder why this is all happening to these poor twenty year olds and find that the reason is pretty effin stupid! It all boils down to some frightfully moronic plot about the nerd being gay and being scared of his brother, then attempting suicide because he could possibly be gay or something like that........ Even worse that the plot was how the twenty somethings were even involved in this garbage. It is some contrived drivel that is easily worthy of the 1 star rating I gave it. I am truly amazed that someone actually gave this a 5 star rating. I'm even shocked someone would give it a 3 star rating.

Closing: Just don't do it. Terribly boring and will leave you in utter confusion. The most confusing part was that someone got paid (and someone paid for) this trash!",1386979200,,1725,4.558064516129032
8522818,3,B007X5997A,"Centres around a group of friends, they're at a party which ends up in humiliation for one young man. A yea later they are reunited and things take a sinister turn. Great cast. Worth a watch. Good dialogue. Nice girl on girl kiss scene as I expected. The girls are pretty. Felix's army brother is kind of hot. One for fan's of Saw, Exam, The Steam Experiment. Contains violence, scenes of a sexual nature and swearing.",1366156800,,418,4.5131578947368425
8522819,5,B007X5997A,"There is a costume party going on with a bunch of cool kids. Felix (Tom Kane) has a crush on Gemma (Florence Hall) and wants to ask her out. He is a shy dweeb and doesn't have a costume ...unless dweeb is a costume. Luke (Alexander Vlahos) is the party specialist who fixes Felix up with a white line of instant courage.  Gemma turns him down as she is dating Chris (Jack Gordon).  An altercation happens while playing ""Truth or Dare"" where Chris slugs Felix.

Later the gang which includes the over sexed Eleanor (Jennie Jacques) and her boyfriend Paul (Liam Boyle), one of those rare guys who can fall asleep right after doing a line of coke, head out to the country to celebrate dweeb Felix's birthday. They are greeted by Justin (David Oakes) Felix's brother and soldier, who has his own ideas on how to play ""Truth or Dare.""

I enjoyed what the Brits did to this common theme geek kid humiliated/revenge slasher film. Good sound track. Good action. Jennie Jacques reminded me of Fairuza Balk during her slutty roles. Good abduction style movie.

F-bomb, sex, girls kissing,",1346198400,4,1078,4.652631578947369
