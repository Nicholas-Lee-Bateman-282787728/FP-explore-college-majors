8455314,5,B000A7JKNQ,"This film portrays the day to day life of political prisoners in a Hungarian gulag, which operated during the early 1950s. Recsk was the most notorious gulag in Hungary, and its legacy still lingers around today. This film was made by the very same filmmaker, who made the European Award winner documentary - Recsk 1950-1953: The story of a secret concentration camp in communist Hungary - which will also be available through Amazon.com in October. Her husband, Geza Boszormenyi, who collaborated with her during both productions was actually a political prisoner at Recsk and went through the same hell the main characters do in this film. That's why this movie is so realistic and unglamourized unlike some similar hollywood flicks.",1122854400,8,735,5.133333333333334
8455315,4,B000A7JKNQ,"This is a pretty decent small European film, which deals with the communist gulag life in the early 1950s. Recsk was the most notorious forced labour camp in communist Hungary in the early 1950s. This film does a great job illustrating what really went on in these camps, which were more like the nazi concentration camps. Apparently it is based on a true story about a small group of prisoners, who are trying to break out from the prison camp. There are not too many movies about the communist gulags, so its worth to check this one out.",1122681600,4,539,4.510204081632653
