8117059,2,B000F3ZSIQ,"I was very disappointed in this dvd.  I found there was too much Vinyasa Yoga and not nearly enough Qi Gong.  In addition, the yoga was boring and overly repetitive.  If you are looking for a good vinyasa dvd, Seane Corne's dvd is fantastic.  I guess I'll be sticking to separate Qi Gong and Yoga practices until I can write my own combination.",1236988800,3,344,4.412698412698413
8117060,5,B000F3ZSIQ,"I have purchased several yoga DVD's which have been highy rated by the Amazon customer reviewers.  However, this DVD is far and away the best workout DVD I have seen and done.  I have only done 40 of the 60 minutes of the workout and I am pretty much thrashed.  I had been used to doing the 90 minute Bikram yoga workout at a studio.  So, I am used to doing yoga.  I realy like this DVD and I am really impressed by Dawn's blending of Qi Gong and yoga into a great workout routine.",1186185600,4,481,4.021052631578947
8117061,3,B000F3ZSIQ,"Simple menu choices of the 3 described choices below only. No chapter choices, no chapter FFw. Set during a fall season, there are many trees w/colorful leaves falling with a small river & a large pond behind. Occasionally the wind picks up & the leaves swirl around Dawn Holst on the foreground on a concrete ground in a mystical way. There are only 2 cameras that are stationary for 2 angles & is always zoomed far away so she only takes up 1/4 of the screen. I assume so you can see the beautiful landscape, though rather have her a little closer. Everything is narrated with a voice over, her voice is simple almost monotone, no spiritual advice, just basic how to move your body instruction. The pace is slow/relaxed, she gets in/out of the poses slow & holds them for a full minute. You must already know yoga & be at least a beginner or intermediate w/at least average endurance/strength.
Qi Yoga Vinyasa Yoga - Music is fast, decent tempo beat & cute. It's hard to hear her sometimes over the music, especially that there's little passion in her voice or change in tone between simple instruction on how to move to next posture & speaking the English name of the pose.
Starts with mountain, Qi Shower, Cobra Rising, balance crouch, standing fwd bend, twisted standing fwd bend & also half bound, downward facing dog, lung, crescent w/arms behind back stretch, revolved crescent w/prayer hands into revolved side angle/prayer twist, down dog, crescent hip opener & w/twist, goddess pose (low squat w/arms in prayer), standing fwd bend, Lifting the sky (she calls Qi Gong sun salutations), 3-4x sun salutations (mountain, standing fwd bend, plank, upward facing dog, cobra, down dog, lunge, standing fwd bend, mountain w/added lower plank as well), chair, standing fwd bend, low plank, upward dog, down dog, warrior 1, Iron cross expansion, Golden bull rakes dust, lunge, down dog, low plank, up dog, down dog, repeat Qi Gong movements w/other leg fwd, down dog, standing fwd bend, chair, Kidney cleanse, low squat, mountain w/extended leg lightly then into warrior 3, standing fwd bend, repeat on Cobra rising, squat down, lay down, locust, bow, lay down relax, stretch, child's pose, down dog, lunge, low squat w/light extended arm twist, butterfly, sitting wide leg fwd bend, straight leg sitting fwd bend & ends with 2 min lay down guided meditation.
Qi Burst Tutorial - 12 min - Starting with a 2 min freeze-framed about this DVD, Qi & how this is in different sequence as the vinyasa yoga workout. This also only just uses clips from the main yoga practice & tells you step by step & when to inhale & exhale. I felt a little more relaxed, but I think only because I was forced to breathe much slower w/the relaxed pace instruction.
The name of the movements are:  the simple Golden shower, Cobra rising, Kidney cleanse (involves yoga chair pose & simple arm circles), Lifting the sky, Iron cross expansion, Golden bull rakes dust.
Qi Burst  - 4 min - No narration, her & her teacher, Mfundishi Bakari standing in front of each other, their side profiles for viewer. They go through all the Qi movements VERY fast, like hyper aerobics fast, you wind up breathing in & out very fast which I read many times was bad for cultivating energy. I only felt a touch better other then a little stretched out & anything aerobics would give.
I did show the trailer to someone who's studied MANY forms of martial arts including many different weapons all his life & has done years of study on how it has influenced many cultures & mediums. He said this is authentic qigong & some do move that fast. He didn't elaborate further.

I liked the yoga at first, but then got incredibly bored & try as I might, at the sun salutations point, I couldn't finish it. I don't think it was the music, but rather her almost sleepy soothing voice & what I find to be her lack of body awareness. The slow pace w/o telling you benefits of the poses, more instruction on perfecting the pose didn't help at all either. Others may like it which is why I left 3 stars & the idea is great. Maybe someone who has more body awareness & passion for these arts will do a better job.

You can see a trailer at their site qi-yoga com & pictures of Dawn doing various poses (some well, some not as well) & they even have 2 video clips, one of the dvd, another of Dawn at a morning show. You can also see them on youtube com",1186099200,18,4393,4.578144853875476
8117062,5,B000F3ZSIQ,"I have been practicing yoga and qi gong both for some time.  I admittedly focus mainly on yoga, and have felt that I have been missing something when I don't get to work in a qi gong session as often as I would like.

When I found out about this dvd I was excited, but fearful that one or the other would be watered down.  But Dawn's practice has dispelled any of those fears and I found the workout challenging and well balanced.  The marriage of qi gong and yoga is an incredibly beautiful and powerful thing with so much potential.  I look forward to more of Dawn's dvds and hope that qi gong is able to find its way into more yoga studios around the country.",1169510400,10,662,4.181102362204724
8117063,5,B000F3ZSIQ,"Qigong and yoga are two deep traditions that have very different teaching styles. This DVD offers a very accessible appoach that fuse these two amazing disciplines into one very organic whole. This is not some goofy combo to capture some commercial wave, this feels and flows beautifully.

The instructions here are very clear and complete and Dawn's voice is soothing - the music could be better but the video quality is clear making this an efficient and fun learning tool.

It is really amazing how the same qigong moves can flow within yoga in the vinyasa and then reemerge as a martial art in the short ""qi bursts"" in the latter chapter.

This is well worth the time and investment for those who want to learn something new that is entirely grounded in tradition.",1145232000,14,768,4.7164179104477615
