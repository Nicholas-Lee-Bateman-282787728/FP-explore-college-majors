8652430,5,B00JMF1IY6,"Perhaps more than any other presentation I've seen, Rise Above the Mark explains the current situation with public education in a manner that is astonishingly easy to follow and understand. Interviews with classroom teachers, administrators, and local and national education officials from both the United States and other countries give the viewer a clear look at how the current emphasis on testing and the siphoning of funds away from public schools is slowing eroding the time-honored tradition of public education in this country. While the film focuses on the situation in Indiana, the issues are national in scope. Peter Coyote's narration serves to focus our attention on the myriad of initiatives, laws, and programs that politicians (and not educators) are forcing on teachers and students. Author Angie Klink wrote the film and her words are perfect. Her son Jack's camera work, directing, and editing are the same. Together with Steve Klink's producing, they make a formidable film family. Do yourself a favor and watch this documentary.",1412208000,13,1049,5.325301204819277
