8473317,5,B005HN69F0,"These are two classic movies as far as I'm concerned. However, this set didn't allow for Caption settings or other features. Not a good thing. Burn Without Reading was easy to follow the vocals but the American was difficult to hear the words. Other than that I'm satisfied and recommend this product.",1487635200,,301,4.8076923076923075
8473318,5,B005HN69F0,"Burn After Reading has to be one of the most underrated comedies out there.  Clever, humorous, and Brad Pitt is absolutely hilarious in this role, as is George Clooney.  All Star cast, little known gem of a movie.",1474588800,,213,4.578947368421052

8473320,5,B005HN69F0,"Both movies played seamlessly on my Samsung Blu-ray player.  I honestly believe some of the comments in regards to non-play issues are because owners aren't updating their firmware in the players.  I did last year and noticed many improvements such as load time of features and ability to play all my Blu-ray titles.

As for the films; I'm a Clooney fan and was looking to buy The American then spotted this combo and couldn't resist especially when you compare to the price of both films alone.",1419811200,2,495,4.732558139534884

8473322,4,B005HN69F0,"Hitting the bricks is not part of this 'slow to the fire' thriller/romantic film ""The American"". It is about an assassin going through redemption in a quiet Italian town (Castel del Monte) while making friends with a priest and then making love to a beautiful prostitute (Clara, played by Violante Placido). Going into battle may seem like fun but to our hero Jack the gunsmith (played to-the-bone by George Clooney), it is not very high on his list. He has just killed his lover Ingrid (played by Irina Bjrklund), and has to live with his conscience. Our empathy may be tied to his `soul searching', as we do not understand why he had to kill defenseless Ingrid. He is thrown into the abyss of guilt and remorse. The plot thickens.

Jack wants out of the business; he tells his boss that he is going into seclusion and will not return to his profession of `killing for a price'. By doing so, Jack brings the wrath of the rejected employer down on himself. He knows this. He assumes another identity. He confides to the local priest (played by Paolo Bonacelli), ""I don't think God's very interested in me, Father."" He even seeks to be cleansed of his guilt by sleeping with our `Mary Magdalene' heroine. Jack will now die to protect Clara from any harm; he is her bodyguard and lover.

He has changed the course of his life through her influence upon him. In all regards, Clooney is cool, reserved, quiet, deliberate, methodical, and tender with the women characters from start to finish. He is even protective of a woman assassin (Mathilde, played by Thekla Reuten), who is sent to kill him. Mercifully, he gives her every chance to back away and turn down the contract on his life. He wants her life (Mathilde) to be spared as well. He has a conscience now, and we empathize with him - not as a cold-bloodied killer but as a changed man from within. He has 'discovered' what matters most to him as a man of conscience.

These dramatic ironies - the sensitive caring side to our assassin-turned-hero toward three highly feminine women (with completely different personnas) and the precise way he builds a Ruger Mini-14 suppressor for the gun meant to be used against him - allow us as an audience to enjoy an Italian-American remake of ""Le Samourai"" (French, 1967, stars Alain Delon as the assassin in a similar, redemptive plot; also defending a woman) and ""Sumarai I, II, and III"" (Japanese, stars Tishuro Mifune as the moralistic 'master swordsman' defending honor and women with his life). Clooney works well with women in strong roles, and this elevates the film substantially. All unities adhered to.

At times the movie is so low-key, it becomes an exercise in tranquility. Directed by Anton Corbijn; original novel by ""A Very Private Gentleman"" by Martin Booth; screenplay adaptation by Rowan Joff. Has serious erotic scenes that may or may not offend viewers.

Please see my future movie review on ""Burn After Reading"" when it is done.",1333411200,,2945,4.744140625
