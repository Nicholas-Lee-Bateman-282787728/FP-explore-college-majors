4667096,4,B005ER6TAE,"I recently got to see the movie For Christ's Sake.  The movie is about a small town priest named Robert (Jed Rees) who finds out his brother Alan (Will Sasso) desperately needs money to help pay for cancer treatments.  Robert then secretly borrows money from the church's emergency fund to help.  He finds out later that his brother has used the money to finance a porn movie with Robert as the unwitting producer.

Will Sasso from MAD TV, Less Than Perfect, and the upcomming movie The Three Stooges delivers laughs as a porn director named Alan who finds himself knee deep in drama.  Sara Rue from Less Than Perfect and Rules of Engagement turns up the heat as a popular porn star named Candy.  Sara Rue fans are in for a real treat because this is Sara's sexiest role ever.  Sara's sexy outfits, steamy seductions, and jaw dropping topless scenes are sure to put a big smile on your face.

This movie is funny, sexy, and heart warming.  I enjoyed following Robert's journey and all the laughs, drama, boobs, and Dukes of Hazzard nostalgia that came with it.  I like this movie and would recommend it.",1322438400,7,1103,4.581632653061225
4667097,3,B005ER6TAE,I had to give this film at least three stars for the presence of the lovely Sara Rue as a blonde. I can't really comment much on the film itself as it seems to be a direct to video release. Even Sara Rue commented on Twitter that she herself was wondering whatever had become of the film. The basic premise/plot concerns a priest being duped into financing an adult film. Not certain if this will be everyone's cup of tea but as a huge fan of Sara Rue I already have this on pre-order.,1321833600,,485,4.170212765957447

8468910,4,B005ER6TAE,"decent movie. Its about a priest who while popular isn't thrilled or finding satisfaction in the priesthood. there are two plots going. One his scoudral of a brother convinces him to invest the churches funds on a movie project,which turns out to be a porno movie to the horror of the priest brother. Naturally the priest falls in love with the star of the porn movie played by likable Sara rue who has a heart of gold underneath and by becoming a porn priest the priest finds his calling to god.the subplot is the secondary minister at his regular church wants his job as head priest and behaves as most despicable priest do to get it. AAll in all an enjoyable movie",1470528000,,667,4.475409836065574

8468912,3,B005ER6TAE,I got this movie because of Sara Rue.  She does have a topless scene but she does a good job in the scenes with her clothes on.  Will Sasso as the director of the porn movie and Jed Rees as the befuddled priest do good jobs as well.  The problem is that a movie of porn meets the church should have been funnier.  Not a bad movie but rent it if you can.,1404172800,2,353,3.7945205479452055
8468913,3,B005ER6TAE,"Not a great film, there are a few funny, and dramatic scenes, but I don't think they were shooting especially high with this film anyway.",1401840000,,137,4.52

And my kids and I are in it!
Had no idea it would be so raunchy... not worth the money",1398297600,,98,3.5
8468915,4,B005ER6TAE,"Sure, he played Curley in the remake of The Three Stooges, but he's an underrated actor and very funny.  Surprised this didn't get a lot of press at its release.",1392595200,,161,4.366666666666666
8468916,4,B005ER6TAE,"I feel like I wanted to like this movie more than I did.  The premise is that a priest gets sucked into the adult film world by his brother.  A lot of the situations that are set up by this are really funny, especially some of the scenes where performers use him for a form of confession. My biggest problem was that in order to get to the joke set-ups, the priest character needed to be otherworldly gullible.  I know that he is supposed to be a less worldly, more trusting character, but the lengths that the movie goes to have him appear to be still kept in the dark is hard to get by.  Sara Rue is great as the star of the adult film being made and some of the other character actors are really funny.  I just wish that I could have gotten past my feeling about the main character's lack of sense.",1362268800,3,801,4.108974358974359
8468917,5,B005ER6TAE,This film is very funny. I liked it a lot. I think people should buy it. If they do they will laugh. If they don't they will not laugh.,1337644800,,135,3.689655172413793
8468918,5,B005ER6TAE,Sara Rue is beautiful and hilarious in this movie. She steals the show but has a good story throughout. Not a watered down comedy that has been edited to where there is nothing funny.,1329955200,,183,4.411764705882353
