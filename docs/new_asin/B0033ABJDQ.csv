8387875,3,B0033ABJDQ,"I heard Rex on the Internet radio and thought it would be great to get his stand up routine on DVD. However, I was disappointed. This is late in his career and he was tired and not funny most of the time. Buy something from his early career.",1362528000,,241,4.041666666666667
8387876,1,B0033ABJDQ,"Poor quality on DVD.

8387878,5,B0033ABJDQ,"This is funny! We were new to Rex's comedy and so haven't noticed if the material is ""nothing new"" (like another reviewer said). His impressions are spot-on, we liked his energy, and his food bits (esp. hot dog) are hilarious! I also like how he builds a joke up and develops the characters (like the gay cousin bit). We're new fans and look forward to seeing more.",1269907200,,365,4.462686567164179
8387879,2,B0033ABJDQ,I am a fan of Rex Navarrete. He is the face of pinoy fil-am comedy but it sucks that this comedy special falls flat on so many levels. The jokes are nothing new. His delivery is so long and repetitious that you beg for the punchline so that he can finally end the joke and move on. He had some good material to go with on Manny Pacquiao but couldn't pull it together and hit anything out of the park. I can count the number of times I chuckled on one hand. Really disappointed on this release after waiting so long for a new one.,1265587200,2,529,4.0476190476190474
