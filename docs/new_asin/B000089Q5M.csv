I adore Anna Deveare Smith and think that the work she does is amazing. This production for television gives a hint of the original play that covers the Crown Heights riots in New York. She interviewed many people are represents them through her own incarnation of their voices, mannerisms and emotions. Truly fascinating. As she says, some people call her work journalism. I call it wonderful and engaging acting. A must see.",1355616000,,569,4.588235294117647
8324746,4,B000089Q5M,"I had been meaning to get ahold of this for a while, having just accepted a teaching
position at a small midwestern college whose students otherwise would not encounter this
genius production.  I took it in small doses and found myself gasping and crying a few times.
She is amazing.  However:  for an $80 DVD, this is pretty skimpy material.  No supplemental
features, and there is no ""Table of Contents"" to move to desired sections.  A disclaimer on
the box states this is for educational use only.  Uh.... is THAT why it cost so much?",1345939200,2,537,4.6
8324747,5,B000089Q5M,"Thank God!  I've been waiting it seems like forever for this documentation of Anna Deavere Smith's work to become available as visual media.  Now I can share this with my communication students!  Anna Deavere Smith is a genius.  Her work epitomizes for me (and I would guess is inspired by) a deep desire to know the ""other.""  To me, her work is a profound, rare and precious type of social research (!) which creates pathways that we can follow to learn how to understand each other, how to share our human journeys, and how to build peace.  Anna Deavere Smith embodies the other... by that, I mean that she walks into, creates space for, and enacts-with her body and voice-the lived reality (feelings, paradoxes, rants, values, passions, convictions) of other people--all kinds of other people.  She records interviews with them, and then she enacts the presence of the other.  She is deeply blessed in her ability to do this.  The particular piece that is for sale here represents her enactment of the perspectives of many people who have witnessed, or perhaps in some way participated in, a riot born of long-held resentments.  Her work is ground-breaking, and she does a poetically, a reverently good job.  I'm so glad that I am aware of Anna Deavere Smith's work, and that her work is part of my life.",1285718400,3,1307,4.738938053097345
8324748,5,B000089Q5M,"This is the very talented Anna Deveare Smith at her BEST!  You won't be able to take your eyes off of her performances.  She puts on the skin of others no matter the gender, race, ethnicity, or religion and becomes them right down to her bones.  This is one of the most stellar depictions of our social issues in this country ever.",1277683200,3,331,4.306451612903226
8324749,5,B000089Q5M,"Evocative and brilliant.  Ms. Smith doesn't disappoint in her one woman show here for PBS.  Nothing can compete with seeing this brilliant performer live, I've seen her time and again and have been continually amazed at her effectiveness.  Storytelling comes effortlessly to her, she is a consummate artist.  Her acting ability and comedic timing are only matched by the genius of her writing.  Diva, Diva, Diva.",1277424000,,412,5.181818181818182
