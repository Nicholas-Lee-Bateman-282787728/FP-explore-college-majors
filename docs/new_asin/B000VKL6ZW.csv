2944865,4,B000VKL6ZW,"""Deep Water"" tells the strange story of Donald Crowhurst, an Englishman of limited sailing experience who was one of 9 men to take up the challenge issued by the Sunday Times in 1968: A non-stop single-handed boat race around the globe. There were doubts as to whether boat or human could withstand such an arduous, isolated journey. The first person to do it would win a Golden Globe. The fastest would win 5,000. Crowhurst was a struggling small businessman with a family who had never found the success he wanted from life. The opportunity for fame and prize money appealed to him. To get a sponsor to pay for his boat, Crowhurst staked all he had, including his house, on completing at least half of the race -a decision that would have bizarre and catastrophic consequences.

Crowhurst set sail in the 40-foot trimaran ""Teignmouth Electron"" on the date of the race deadline, October 31, 1968. The story of his voyage, his predicament, and surprising decisions is told through old 16mm movies taken on board the boat and interviews with son Simon and wife Clare Crowhurst, friend Ron Winspear, journalist Donald Kerr, and Ted Hynds, who was deputy to Crowhurst's dodgy press agent Rodney Hallworth. Competitors Robin Knox-Johnston and Bernard Moitessier provide an insider's perspective on the race, Moitessier in the form of films and logs, since he is deceased. Francoise Moitessier shares her husband's experience and her own. Along with Tilda Swinton's narration, they paint a compelling picture of this groundbreaking 10-month endurance test.

This is one of those rare documentaries that might suffer from spoilers, so I'll be vague. ""Deep Water"" superbly recreates Crowhurst's grave dilemma and his character which obliged him to cope as he did. It's fundamentally sympathetic to Crowhurst, more than I would have been, perhaps because those who knew him and were interviewed are understandably fond of the man. The filmmakers tactfully avoid saying that Crowhurst gambled the roof over his children's heads to satisfy his ego, and thereby became his own undoing. It also doesn't mention an obvious alternative which, in the end, Crowhurst failed to see. But between those two points, ""Deep Water"" is a penetrating and gripping account of a man trapped, almost literally, between the devil and the deep blue sea.

The DVD (IFC 2007): There are 4 featurettes and a theatrical trailer (2 min). ""The Sailors' Stories"" are text and interviews about the contestants. Alex Garozzo, Donald Crowhurst, Loick Fougeron, and John Ridgeway have brief text bios. Very worthwhile are interviews with Chay Blyth (5 min), Bill Leslie King (6 min), Robin Knox-Johnson (10 min) and with the widows of Bernard Moitessier (6 min) and Nigel Tetley (7 min). ""The Journalists' Story"" (11 min) recounts how the Sunday Times conceived of and reported the boat race, creating the story, not just reporting it, through interviews with journalists Murray Sayle and Philip Norman, editor Harold Evans, et al. ""The Family's Story"" (7 min) interviews wife Clare and 2 of the Crowhurst children about how they came to understand their father's actions. ""The Abandoned Boat"" uses some photos of the Teignmouth Electron to present 11 of Donald's audio recordings and some of his notes and diagrams. Subtitles are available for the film in English SDH and Spanish.",1198886400,26,3340,5.124770642201835
2944866,5,B000VKL6ZW,"This is a beautiful and compelling film. It is the story of the last voyage of Donald Crowhurst, a batty amateur of the finest British tradition: a man with a young family and a struggling business who became fixated on the forlorn quest to win the 1968 Sunday Times solo, non-stop round-the-world-yacht race.

Archive footage reveals that from the earliest stage Crowhurst, a tubby, cardigan-wearing thirty-seven-year-old inventor, had no idea what he was taking on. But he was certainly dressed for it: in a tie and slacks as he set off on the race! The poor man did not know what he was doing, how his plan had a hope of success, yet bizarrely he was financed, filmed and represented by people who ought to have known better.  Most strangely of all he was allowed, even out of his garden shed, by his wife, a woman revealed by the documentary to be otherwise a sober, sensible, reflective and thoughful woman.

One of many tragedies catalogued in this film is that no-one had the wherewithal or gumption to tell this poor chap - in no sense one of life's winners, and certainly not the sort to be up for a round-the-world solo yacht journey - not to be such a blazing fool.

Yet, like a Greek tragedy, plot developments thereafter pile inevitably on, compelling the poor man on when even he had twigged it was sheer madness: the oppressive terms of his financing, residual pride, his own ill-considered decisions to misreport his positions and, in the final strait, the sheer bad luck to have a couple of his competitors unexpectedly sink or go postal on him when all he needed them to do was simply complete the course ahead of him and allow him to finish in quiet, plucky British ignominy. Were it not for any of these, Donald Crowhurst might still have his unspectacular life, and still be running a failing electronics business, to this day.

But as it is, events conspired to a different course, and Crowhurst's elegaic and articulate descent into the abyss is capitvatingly rendered in this film, from logs, recordings and films he made en route, and in which he is portrayed without apparent exaggeration as a tragic hero, doomed by the course of this actions and the irresistable currents of human and physical nature, to a sad end.

Thoroughly recommended.

2944867,5,B000VKL6ZW,"In 1968 the Sunday Times of London sponsored a race to see who could circumnavigate the globe --solo and without stopping. Prizes were offered for the one who finished first and the one who finished fastest. Nine sailors entered the race, but this documentary film focuses on three contestants in particular-- Robin Knox-Johnston, who finished first by averaging 92 miles a day for 312 days (28,704 miles) and who appears in the film; the Frenchman Bernard Moitessier, who turned around just before finishing, forsaking fame and fortune for the isolation of the sea, and sailed an additional 10,000 miles to Tahiti (his book The Long Way tells his story); and then the amateur sailor and eccentric Donald Crowhurst who never should have entered the race under any circumstances. His bizarre story forms the real narrative of this film. It's difficult to say more without spoiling this film, but you can be sure that it's more of an exploration of the deep waters of the human psyche than an adventure tale. Interviews with family members and friends; archival film footage; news reels; diaries, audio tapes, 16mm film and ship logs by the sailors; and still photos lend authenticity to the pathos of this deeply human story. Two of the film's producers were John Smithson and Paul Trijbits who made Touching the Void.",1190160000,46,1317,4.963800904977376

2944877,3,B000VKL6ZW,"Like a few others have mentioned, this is not so much a book about the race as it is about Donald Crowhurst, the lone inexperienced 'average joe' competitor. The movie was beautifully filmed and narrated and has compelling current and past interviews and footage that make the subjects (especially Crowhurst's family and the other competitors) come alive.

However, there are problems. The participation of Crowhurst's son and widow, and their obvious emotional involvement, made me wonder about whether we get an accurate portrait of Crowhurst himself. The film treats Crowhurst as a dreamer and a victim of circumstance, when in reality he just wanted to escape the financial problems that he created, and got tangled in his own web of lies.

His widow and son have not recovered from their ordeal. That was very sad to watch - she seems to blame herself. The son says his father just wanted to get home to them, and I understand his need to feel that way, but based on his father's actions, it is hard to accept such a simple concept. Crowhurst had a chance to contact family when he was in Brazil; they were 'desperate' for news, but he didn't. The film implies he wasn't in his right mind at this point, but perhaps he just wanted to mask his deception more than he cared for the worries of his wife and children. Crowhurst wanted many things on his voyage, and his family must have been among them, but they took a back burner to his pride and sense of failure, certainly.

Ultimately, this film treats Crowhurst perhaps too kindly. The film treats his situation as if he was forced to choose only one of his four children from a fire or something. Financial ruin sucks, but he would have still had his family and his life. He could have made adult decisions. Instead he ran away looking for a pie in the sky solution, and then constructed elaborate falsehoods to cover his tracks. The rest of his problems flow from this original lie.

Forgiving me for saying, but I also found myself wondering whether he pretended to be mad in his journals to make his suicide more excusable than it would have been if he killed himself to avoid the fallout from his deception and financial ruin. It seems very plausible given his other lies.

Finally, like others have mentioned here, despite what I mentioned above, I do agree that the story has a whiff of Shakespearean tragedy/futility to it. That in itself makes it worth watching.

2944891,5,B000VKL6ZW,"There's something in the British character that loves glorious failures.  Tennyson wrote his famous poem about the Battle of the Light Brigade at Balaclava, and the retreat from Dunkirk is immortalized in the British consciousness.  Failures such as Gallipoli and the Battle of the Somme in WWI are written about with greater emotion and affection than any victory.  Every English schoolboy knows about Gordon's last days in Khartoum, Scott's failed march to the South Pole, Richard III fateful charge down Boswell field, and Harold's fall at Hastings. Let's add Donald Crowhurst and his boat Teignmouth Electron to the list. This supurb documentary tells the story of the 1968 Globe race which pitted solo sailors from around the world to see who could finish as the first  to circumnavigate solo around the world unaided.  The story focuses on three major figures: the eventual winner, Robin Knox Johnson, the great French sailor, Bernard Moitessier, and the oddball amateur Donald Crowhurst. The footage is often stunning; the story is compelling; and the outcome is Shakespearean tragedy.  No need to go into the story's detail, but Crowhurst found himself in an unrecoverable dilemma. He eventually resorted to fudging things, which grew into greater lies and then outright deceit.  Somehow, in the end, there is arguable redemption, but then that depends on your point of view and definition of failure.  There are so many twists in the story that one is reminded that reality writes more fantastic plots than whatever could be devised by fiction.  I've seen this documentary at least five times, and tear up throughout.  There are no weak points to this story.  As Crowhurst's friend, Ron Winspear states towards the end of the film: When somebody has risked and failed and when somebody has fallen from the tightrope they had been walking on. Someone has to pick them up and give them a burial.  Best thing is that a friend should do that...In my mind, I gave him a heros burial.

2944928,5,B000VKL6ZW,"Excellent documentary. Keeps one riveted throughout. But to call this man any sort of hero is a total injustice to the meaning of the word, and to those men and women who truly are heroic. It seems quite clear that Donald Crowhurst wanted glory; he wanted to be recognized as a great man. Nothing uncommon there -- that same desire has been the downfall of many. He decided to place himself heavily in debt, and to risk the security of his family in order to chase after that glory. Again, nothing to really criticize for that decision; it was his right. However, within two weeks of leaving, he decided to cheat by sending in false locations. Then he decided to cut off radio communications so that his actual location couldn't be determined. Next he decides to wait the entire length of time, just drifting off the coast of South America, while all the other participants are actually sailing the course. This, so that as the others approached, he could join in. These were all conscious decisions he made to deceive the world. Not one lie, but lie after lie. Rather than facing up to his mistakes like a mature adult man, he chose the opposite -- to hide his mistakes, to falsify his actions. There is no doubt he would've continued right on into England with his concocted voyage but that the other ship sank, and his lies were sure to be exposed. It is a sad story indeed, and it's pitiful that his wife and children had to be subjected to such shame. But in reading these reviews, so many of which, try to justify or forgive his actions, I see what is so wrong with attitudes today. It seems that no one is to be held accountable for his own actions. Mrs Crowhurst states that she was angry and blamed everybody and everything. Well, how about blaming Mr Crowhurst? He alone decided to lie and cheat. He could have just as easily turned around, sailed home, admitted failure, and faced his financial difficulties. Now that would've been courage.",1391212800,4,1951,4.577142857142857

2944933,5,B000VKL6ZW,"I have watched this film at least 5-times now. I've bought most of the books relating to the participants, especially Donald Crohurst, the anti-hero, the man who's initial lack of integrity seems to be his undoing. But when you realize why Crowhurst ended his life the that way he did, you realize that his courage and sacrifice were undoubtely the greatest of all the contestants. He made series of misjudgments which, true, got him in to an impossible position. But when you REALLY understand why he made his final choice, you understand the courage, integrity and strength of the man.

Of course, the story is about Knox-Johnston, Tetley and Moitessier as well, along with the others, ALL of whom deserve tremendous credit for their courage in taking part in the first ever attempted solo-circumnavigation of the globe.

But this film seems to mostly focus on Crowhurst, lending insight in to the human psyche and what compels men to take great risks...some succeeding, others failing...and some actually CHOOSING to fail.

It's a FASCINATING and extremely well-done documentary. The quality of the story telling, the narration, the editing, the musical score and the cinematography reminds one of a Ken Burns film...one for the modern age. The tragedy, the joy, the hopes, dreams and fears are wonderfully captured, through mostly direct actuality interviews. It's a masterpiece of it's time.

2944936,5,B000VKL6ZW,"The sea is an enormous and unforgiving place for even the most experienced sailor. The first successful solo circumnavigation in 1967 took 274 days not including a six week layover in Sydney. In 1968 the London Sunday Times newspaper hosted a race for solo sailors to do the same voyage and to make it interesting it was to be done unaided and without touching land. But this documentary is only about the race in part, indeed the race only forms the backdrop to the real story. The central subject is one hapless amateur sailor hoping to make a name for himself. The prize money would go a long way in getting him out of financial strife and the publicity would give his sagging electronics business a needed boost.
He made hurried preparations and with a shoestring budget built a catamaran which was untested for sailing in the notoriously difficult southern ocean and outfitted with a prototype of an electronic navigation system of his own design. Everything that could go wrong was going wrong even before he set sail. He was the last boat out and there were concerns that if he left any later he would sail into the southern ocean during its stormiest season when gale force winds could blow relentlessly.
As he made his way south towards the equator things began falling apart - not the least the sailor himself. I won't spoil it for the viewer to describe what ensues but it is a truly strange tale of madness.",1388707200,,1419,4.634920634920635

A very sad and depressing story, and quite boring. Why would anyone watch this?

2944955,4,B000VKL6ZW,"I liked this documentary. The screen footage, interviews, and historical context were philosophical, and interesting. My review is also philosophical.

First, a documentary like this has to have a point of view, even if subtle.  In this case the filmmakers choose to use the ethics of sailing, and failure in sailing equates to failure in general. In typical British fashion, the sailor almost has the weight of the British Empire to uphold, and the die is cast. There's a heavy set of Christian/Judaic ethics that almost pre-dooms the hero.

One can accept this thesis, or not; I chose not.

If the only true failures in life are those who never try anything, then the main character is a hero. After a life of conformity, he took a chance. He managed to stay alive for almost a year on a small sailboat. In taking the chance he is akin to a mountain climber.  Although he doesn't reach the top, by simply trying he exceeds those who never even try.

At the end perhaps he felt like a failure, or perhaps he simply did not want to go back to a life where he met others' expectations.

This movie definitely met that goal. This was a documentary type movie of men who were going to sail around the world. It was entertaining and because it was telling a true story, it definitely kept me glued to the screen. The home video of the family and the children watching as Dad went off to sea were powerful for setting an impression of how many eyes were watching him and how much pressure was on him to succeed. I think it was a very sad story. To me, it said a lot about a man's ego. I do not think they are all fragile, but some of them can be and this movie helped me to understand why. It made me want to hug my husband and tell him, no matter what baby...good or bad....I've got your back.",1379808000,6,876,3.9829545454545454
2944959,5,B000VKL6ZW,"A great film, and wouldn't change much about it since it was really about Donald Crowhurst, but it leaves me wanting to know more about the others in the race. Especially, the two who apparently valued the intrinsic nature of the romantic and heroic ideals behind the race more than the accolades or prize money.

The frenchman who was on track to win it, but instead continued sailing halfway again around the world because he found the poetry of the profound solitude and oneness with creation so compelling.

The other, and only one to finish and receive the prize money, then gave it away to Crowhurst's family.

I only wish it were a longer film that explored the themes of compare and contrast between the participants. Also so many spiritual themes to explore that such a voyage can't help but stir up...

THEY THAT GO DOWN TO THE SEA IN SHIPS, that do business in great waters; These see the works of the LORD, and his wonders in the deep. For he commandeth, and raiseth the stormy wind, which lifteth up the waves thereof. They mount up to the heaven, they go down again to the depths: their soul is melted because of trouble. They reel to and fro, and stagger like a drunken man, and are at their wits' end. Then they cry unto the LORD in their trouble, and he bringeth them out of their distresses. He maketh the storm a calm, so that the waves thereof are still. Then are they glad because they be quiet; so he bringeth them unto their desired haven. Psalms, 107:23-30

Back in the days before satellite navigation and video links the oceans were where a man or woman and a small boat could disappear for months at a time away from human contact or sight of land. Against this profound isolation, solo deep water sailors brought only their wits, experience and their small wood and steel craft to tackle a challenge so formidable that many considered the feat to be impossible due to the psychological stress alone. Nine contestants showed up, mostly from a field of highly experienced and capable deep water sailors. The film follows the exception, novice sailor Donald Crowhurst's voyage, which today seems equally audacious, foolhardy, brave and inevitable from the moment of its conception to its surprising finale.

A tale of Don Crowhurst.  He wanted great things for himself and his family.  Too much perhaps, more than he could manage.  Though failed in his quest, he dreamed big, and carried through to the point of putting himself on the line.

It was more than he was capable of.  He is like Icarus who flies too close to the sun.

He did things we normally find abhorrent.  Trying to feign greatness by cheating.  Yet such was his quest, so high his vision, and so short did he fall we can forgive him for being merely human.  His humanity brought him back to earth, and caused him to take actions that finally make his final testament one of justness.  That saved his legacy in a very strange way.

One can find his actions reprehensible, and at the same time put themselves so easily in his place to see how very likely it is many of us would end up the same in those circumstances.  A very human story.",1376179200,,979,4.278688524590164

It is also every bit as excellent as Herzog's legendary piece.
 I don't want to give much away. Simon Crowhurst's tale is fascinating by itself. It is told through the eyes of history & family members tragically affected by his failure to realize & accept that he was getting in too far over his head. (I actually think that Crowhurst is a more sympathic figure that GM's Timothy Treadwell who, let's face it, got is girlfriend horribly killed.) We all have some Crowhurst inside of us but not to this degree.
 This doc also explores the siren call of the open seas, a world when techno-saturation was still in its infancy (no ONSTAR for your cork in the ocean)& a nation's pride. It is also a tale about a thrilling sailing competition & another sailor/navigator who didn't get lost in his dreams...at least he didn't apparently die chasing them.

He added to the colorful story, with his newly designed boat and his talk of special gadgets. His start, within hours of the last possible starting time allowed by race rules, was underwhelming, and his boat's speed indicated that Crowhurst wasn't the optimal sailor.

But the sporadic radio reports indicated that he was plodding along, headed for the southern oceans to begin that scary trip through the Roaring Forties.

Then, miraculously, he radioed that he had set a new one day sailing distance record, and after another month, he was actually a contender in the race.  As other boats dropped out, he was suddenly one of only four boats left, then three.  And it looked like he might actually win the timed race.

Only Crowhurst had never made the trip.  He came to the realization, near the tip of South America, that his experience and his boat would, at best, have a 50-50 chance of succeeding though the southern seas.  To return to England would lead to financial ruin and humiliation.  To go forward led to death.  So he faked his progress, hoping to rejoin the race as the other boats started their final run back to England in the north.  This decision had tragic consequences.

This movie, Deep Water, is a collection of authentic film clips of Crowhurst along with narrations from his logbook, and supplemented with interviews of his children, his wife, his promoters, and other sailors.

Eerie and tragic.  It almost seems that this tale was a made-for-television fictional event, but it was all true.",1375315200,,1663,4.892857142857143

2944990,3,B000VKL6ZW,"** Warning: SPOILERS **

As a documentary focusing on Donald Crowhurst's attempt to circumnavigate the world solo in 1968, this was mainly flawed by an over-sympathetic approach, resolutely biased to try and  present him as a 'hero', hopelessly torn between saving his family (whose financial ruin he ensured) and trying to save his life (which he recklessly endangered all by himself).

While hardly mentioning and giving due credit to the exploits of the other participants, true sailing heroes, starting with Robin Knox-Johnston, a true sailor and a gentleman, as well as Bernard Moitessier, Nigel Tetley and all the others, this documentary seems to have been made with the sole purpose of making the Crowhurst family feel better about their loss.

Unfortunately, after watching this overlong and biased documentary, I feel not one iota of pity or compassion for a cheater and a liar.  And not a lot for his family either.  Seriously, what happened to taking responsibility for our mistakes?  The media involved (The Sunday Times and the BBC etc.) and Crowhurst's PR manager are of course also to blame as they clearly exploited and pushed a weak-minded man into making a major decision which he was not capable of assuming, a mistake he then compounded again and again over the course of several months.  This story is a perfect cautionary tale about wanting fame and fortune without being willing to pay the required price - usually by devoting one's life to acquiring the skills and endurance necessary to reach such an ambitious goal successfully.

You may find my point of view very harsh, but I believe trying to justify cheating and lying as 'a game that went out of control' or 'losing touch with reality' as this documentary repeatedly does is an endemic and moral problem, similar to justifying  doping in sports or plagiarism in literature:  any such pity for a failure should be curtailed and cheaters and liars should not be excused in my opinion.  Especially when one considers that Donald Crowhurst dug his own grave by an attempt he was wholly unqualified for. Failure can be glorious, but cheating cannot ever be pitied or excused.

Your mileage may vary of course but I really disliked the exculpatory tone of this documentary which I felt was trying to emotionally manipulate the viewer a bit too obviously.  Note that I am not suggesting his family and friends should be harassed for or reminded of Crowhurst's moral failings - they clearly already blame themselves - and I do not pretend to know if they are right to blame themselves:  this is something only they know and furthermore is really none of our business.

Yes, documentaries may not always be perfectly objective and may not contain all the truth - in cases when it is unknown, for instance - but they should be unbiased or aim to minimize their bias at the very least.  This is most definitely not the case here.

A far better approach would have been to film this as a fictional movie (a la 'based on a true story'), a structure which would have neatly circumvented most of the problems I had with this movie.",1374105600,,3098,4.8352272727272725
2944991,5,B000VKL6ZW,"I had, several times, passed up the chance to watch this film - both when it was in theatres as well as when selecting something to watch from the Prime lineup. I'm not sure why I clicked into it tonight - but I am glad I did. This is without doubt something to watch - not for the adventure aspect, although that is there; but more for the human aspects, and what we can learn and take away from this.

Without giving spoilers, what I found interesting were some of the side stories - those stories which, while important to the entirety of the whole, were incidental, running parallel with the Crowhurst narrative.  Delicately filmed, rivetingly interviewed, and fascinatingly intimate, this film takes you from the land through the seas - both physical as well as spiritual.

The challenges of telling this story in a sensitive, enlightening manner was well accomplished by the directors and producers. You are left questioning what, in fact, happens to someone who is so long isolated while being faced with life and death decisions in every moment - what happens to the human mind, the human soul, the human heart when faced with such naked life-or-death times.  And how do different people cope with the same, or at least very similar, circumstances?

The delicate weaving of several story-lines through photographs, movies, log books and interviews creates a sense of 'now-ness', bringing you into the environment of the man Donald Crowhurst, his wife, the other competitors, the press agents, and the journalists involved. In a brilliant editing job, these very different views are used to create a complete view - and, while the view is necessarily missing pieces, there are enough pieces present for you to actually feel the emotions...and understand the silences and pressures faced by all.

The momentary glimpse of Crowhurst's early days, coupled with interviews from his widow and one of his sons, tells a story of a man who, despite grave misgivings, ventures into a race around the world...and a race with self - an introspective, good-and-evil confrontation and questioning of the meaning of life in a fully rounded tale. The contrasting tale of Moitessier and his wife, and the actions he took, demonstrated another aspect of the 'winning' of a race - and of the fears one may not be able to conquer.

Together with the balance of the film, it is both uplifting and confronting, assaultive and informative, but above all, you are left with a deep sadness for a man who risked it all - and lost.

The outrage I felt at having wasted the final hours of a Sunday night, before I have to go to bed and then rise for another day at work, watching this horrible account instead of watching the uplifting story I'd hoped for, are what prompt me to write this review.

I'll say this, the filmmakers chose the wrong subject on which to base the film. If they'd chosen the other 8 sailors as the focus of their story and left this one to a 5-10 minute footnote, they would have really had a picture to be proud of. Instead they chose the footnote to be placed into the limelight, and in so doing to place into obscurity and insignificance the true courage, and daring and out of this world toughness that folks hold up as the true ideals in life. But perhaps that is exactly what the filmmakers planned to do.

In making this film they not only lower the tone of any who watch, but they also rub a generous portion of salt into the wounds of those who have to live with the mans mistake. ""Here, everybody look at the failure. See, we've made an hour and a half film about the failure and phony. See, here is his family so that you can recognize them in public and regard them in the most pitiful way so that their lives from here on out my not recover.""

The first choice is he turns back to England and admits his ship just was not seaworthy to the rough seas. The second choice was he sets into port and fixes the ship and limps on toward completing the voyage, while setting into port and making repairs as needed. The story makes it clear my two choices were unacceptable to him, but they were really the only choices he had. I say these choices were the ones because in the end he could not live without being an honest man. He would not have won the race in both of my choices, but just attempting the journey is what sells stories.

2945045,5,B000VKL6ZW,"My husband and I watched this last week. At first, he thought it was going to be ""one of those corny sailing movies like 'Wind.'"" (I admit the romantic plot of ""Wind"" was really silly, and according to reviews, nothing like the real-life romance.)

But husband consented to watch the beginning, and by the end of the movie, I said, ""You're still here."" (He had said he would leave after the beginning to go do something else.)

He admitted it was a good documentary.

It isn't just about sailing, although that's mainly why I wanted to watch it. It is, however, a scary look at man's psyche.

*SPOILER*: It was interesting to me that Donald Crowhurst and Bernard Moitessier both decided not to go home again, but they decided to do different things instead.

I like to think I'm more of the Moitessier type. But I do admire Crowhurst for his inventions, his bravery (although husband said, ""He was an idiot to set sail without thorough preparation,"" which is true. Part of being a good sailor is knowing how and when to fit your boat. And to do a good shakedown sail before making long distance voyages.), and just because.

There's a book which I got, in addition to the movie: _The Strange Last Voyage of Donald Crowhurst_. I didn't appreciate the snideness of the authors, but I did appreciate that they included a lot of Crowhurst's journal entries. Fascinating man.

The surprising part about this movie was once our protagonist began to fail miserably and ultimately went crazy after figuring out that he couldn't cheat his way into success. I don't know whether it's ego or pride that caused his demise? Probably both. As bad as things can get either financially or otherwise I can't imagine that it's worth taking it to that extreme.

2945056,4,B000VKL6ZW,"In the late-1960s an English weekend sailor named Donald Crowhurst felt that he was - in some ways - imprisoned by life. In his mid-thirties, Crowhurst had a wife, four young children, and a reasonably-successful career as an engineer. But Crowhurst sought something else and he gradually became obsessed with joining a race to become the first person to sail around the world, solo, without stopping.

Crowhurst eventually joined the 1968 race - against eight more-experienced sailors. Prior to the race, the English press championed underdog Crowhurst. But Crowhurst had a difficult time finding a seaworthy vessel and he faced financial ruin if he backed out. Eventually, at the last possible moment, Crowhurst set sail from England.

Deep Water is the true story of how one bad decision can often lead us to make even worse decisions later. For most viewers, Crowhurst will be an ambivalent figure. On the one hand, he had the courage to chase his dreams. On the other, he ignored the potential harm that his choices could have for those who loved him.

The film contains some amazing, beautiful shots of the oceans. The viewers begin to understand the sea's power - and its indifference to our fates. Also, in recounting the race, Deep Water reveals what it is like to sail in the open ocean, alone, for months on end. Finally, there are some good descriptions of the eight competitors in the race - many of whom are fascinating in their own right. (I would like to see an update of what happened to the people in the film after the race was over).

Deep Water reminds us that dreams aren't free. Conventional wisdom tells us that we should take more chances - after all, we typically regret the chances that we don't take more than those that we do take. But at what point do the costs become too high? The film doesn't have the answer, but it does force the viewer to consider these questions while also recounting some interesting events.

This documentary is NOT about sailing. It's about what can happen to a man who in the course of pursuing his dreams and ambitions, gets his balls caught in a vice and has to deal with the situation totally alone and in the face of incredible danger. Admittedly, he may have had some inner instability, but who doesn't? Consider the Frenchman who, closing in on the finish, reversed course completely to sail around the world a second time! That's another story, in and of itself worthy of a documentary. Nine months at sea completely alone would test any man.

2945059,3,B000VKL6ZW,"This is an odd film which appears to attempt to turn a rather flawed human being -- an unstable liar and cheat -- into a hero.  I can appreciate the fact that Donald Crowhurst's family want to think well of him, but the film makers really owe us a more balanced picture.  The film says at one point that Crowhurst had tried other careers, but it doesn't tell us that he was asked to resign from both the RAF and the Royal Army for conduct unbecoming, etc. He was a man who never really grew up, and to say that he was a player of games as an excuse for what he did (attempting to fake a voyage around the world) really doesn't excuse his basic dishonesty.  A classical hero is a good and great man with a single flaw.  Crowhurst was a weak and flawed man with a few good qualities (he appears to have loved his wife and children).  Paranoid Schizophrenia (which reading Crowhurst's logs clearly reveals) is not, I believe, something that happens to a person who is psychologically reasonably strong.  So trying to present Crowhurst as a sort of hero is, at best odd, at worst a misrepresentation.  Far more interesting to me are the brief bits in the extras sections about Robin Knox Johnson and my own favorite, Bill King.  Buy the film if you can find a cheap copy; it's rather nicely edited; but beware of an odd agenda running throughout.",1270857600,6,1342,4.4048582995951415
2945060,5,B000VKL6ZW,"1968.  In the pre-GPS era, Briton Francis Chichester becomes the first person to sail single-handedly around the world, after a brief stop in Australia for repairs.  His achievement inspires the London `Times' newspaper to sponsor a round-the-world yacht race which will challenge the world's best yachtsmen to go one better;  to sail single-handedly around the world without stopping, and without assistance from any third party.  Total Solitude for anything up to a year.

Using Chichester's achievement as a preface, ""Deep Water"" chronicles the pre-race excitement and preparations, profiles the nine men who accept the challenge, then tells the story of the race itself, all the way to its haunting conclusion and inspiring legacy.  Although its principal focus is on Donald Crowhurst,  the `dark horse' among a field of experienced and famous yachtsmen,  the whole 90-minute story is one of risk, adventure, solitude, shipwreck, survival, deception, triumph, failure, eccentricity, descent into madness, and - tragically - crushing bereavement.  To say any more would spoil the suspense;  suffice it only to add that not all of the nine men finished, and not all survived.

Interviews with surviving personalities (including family members) combined with clips of archived footage and an articulate narrative make this a very well-coordinated documentary, in fact, now the best I have ever seen. I've watched it four times in the last year, and find it's one of those rare tales that reveals something new each time.  Only this last time, for instance,  it struck me that - surprisingly - not a single American entered the race;  all the contestants were Europeans (actually British and French), almost as though they were the last in that great line of continental adventurers in the tradition of Columbus, DaGama, Drake, Magellan, Tasman, Cook, and others.  Then it occurred to me that in 1968-69, these last great adventurers from the Old World were setting out one last time to sail around it,  just as the first adventurers from the New World were setting out away from it, toward the moon.  With each viewing, though, I found myself haunted by man's inner heart of darkness, about which so much is disturbingly revealed in this gripping tale.  The last 10-15 minutes are particularly moving, perhaps even disturbing.

I'm just over 50, but I still wonder that in my lifetime we have seen the transition from self-dependence (using a sextant and knowing the stars), to the global inter-connectivity of GPS, weather radar, and advanced communications which now make such voyages almost unadventurous.  I couldn't help feeling that these men had more in common with those heroes of centuries ago, than with the more recent mariners of today,  who are their actual contemporaries.

Among the bonus features are logs and film recovered from one sad, derelict vessel of a sailor who didn't make it, and recent short interviews with a real-life cast of characters from what will soon be a forgotten world. There are references to that old classic Anglo-French rivalry,  and we see the eccentricities of a very special group of larger-than-life heroes (look for the swashbuckling Scotsman who later became the first person to sail solo around the world in the wrong direction,  not to mention the gallant Frenchman who abandoned fame and fortune to achieve self-fulfillment - right out of Saint-Exupery!).  I did find, however, that at least one of the biographies in the bonus features section stopped short for reasons that are not clear;  for the full and ultimately tragic story of Nigel Tetley, I recommend you look him up on Wikipedia.

Never mind if you're not a sailor - I'm not;  this is about so much more than life on the high seas and the wild oceans.  There's something in this for everyone, but especially those who want their heroes not to be country-men, or company-men, or men of any kind of institution, but men's men;  individualists in the classic sense, whose strengths derive from something deep within.

This story continues to grow on me, and - significantly - on all those to whom I have recommended it. To explain in full why this documentary is so compelling and so good would spoil the show.  So trust me far enough to spend $4 (used) for what in my humble opinion is the best documentary ever made.  I am certain you will not regret it.",1266192000,19,4368,5.013869625520111

2945066,5,B000VKL6ZW,"Have you ever found yourself watching a film or documentary and having to hold yourself back from screaming things like ""No! Don't do it!""? No? Well it's time you do. And undoubtedly DEEP WATER is the one to get you started.

The story is based on that of Donald Crowhurst and his entry into the first round-the-world yacht race to be undertaken by individuals in 1968. That word ""individuals"" is important, as the men who set off on this nearly suicidal escapade head out alone.

Most of the men are well-knowns in the sea-faring communities of England (where they launch from), but one of them is the ""unknown dark horse,"" and his name was Donald Crowhurst. Struggling financially, Crowhurst enlists a backer who can take everything from him should he fail to at least attempt to make it through a large portion of the race. He could take his home, his property, everything.

Crowhurst now finds himself between a rock and ...well ...deep water: either attempt the race with an unproven ship and an unproven captain, or lose everything you own (which was significant since Crowhurst had a wife and several children). You'll note the term ""unproven captain"" in there, too. Not only was he unproven, he'd never been out on the open sea! Did I mention suicidal?

Flicking between archival footage of the pre- and post-race, and those of Crowhurst's friends, family, and acquaintances of today, Deep Water is put together masterfully. Initially seen as a poor sap who got in over his head, the film gradually shows you the limited choices Crowhurst had after months and months out on the water. His ship leaks. Equipment breaks. Pysche stretched to the breaking point (and beyond). Crowhurst finds himself lost in an internal struggle with no successful way out. It is interesting, too, to see the psychological breaks that other racers have as they deal with their solitary confinement on-board their respective boats.

The wave-like emotions that you'll feel as you watch this astounding documentary may make you a bit ill (not unlike trying to get your sea-legs). And you'll probably be frustrated at the choices being made; perhaps just as frustrated as poor Mr. Crowhurst.

The ending is also amazing in that we get to see the actual ship that Crowhurst sailed, sitting deserted and rotting on a Caribbean beach ...not unlike other things that felt deserted and rotting toward the end of this poorly thought-out race.

Of all the participants, Crowhurst was the least experienced and the least prepared. The race began in England and participants had a window of several months during which they could leave before the weather turned against them. While all the others had left weeks before, Crowhurst finally had his boat ready on the very last day possible. Remember, this was before GPS and the only contact was when they happened to be in range of radio contact. Several, including Crowhurst, had movie cameras along as well as audio taping equipment to record their journey. From the beginning Crowhurst had laid everything on the line. His financial future was tied to the success of the race. What makes someone in the prime of life risk family, finances and future on a challenge that only proves you can do something no one else has done? Why didn't family or friends or both talk him out of this utterly absurd expedition? What a person does when they face the ultimate challenge in his life reveals his character.

This documentary focuses on the story of Bernard Crowhurst, a struggling inventor with limited sailing experience, money, and support, but no lack of ambition. He was right, as we know now, a multi-hulled boat would be the fastest. But Crowhurst lacked the resources to build a boat suitable to circle the globe. None the less, he sets out at the last possible moment to win the race. He soon recognizes that he faces financial ruin if he does not complete the race and certain death if he continues. This documentary uses original 16mm footage, interviews with fellow competitors and family, and entries from his log to explore his experience and tragedy at sea.

Artistically and tastefully done, Deep Water, is a compelling story of one man's ambition and the lure of the sea.

And the exact same was true for how the majority of people defined their social and personal identity as well...and I am not speaking metaphorically, either.

Today my children take their GPS for granted. The world is mapped...every square inch. Today we know where we are not in relation to something else, but just in relation to where we are...which defines to us where everything else is. And beyond the physical description of where we are, today my children know and can articulate the manner in which their culture, and their society, and their family shapes them. But it was not so in the 1960's...it was not so. When Donald Crowhurst sailed over the horizon, he indeed sailed not only into a geographical oblivion, he also sailed off the social map in a very real way. And as we bid him farewell, we who grew up back then were as certain of this geographically, as we were socially.

It's interesting that today Western culture advocates venturing over social horizons so glibly. The assumption is that in so doing, self-disclosure awaits. But without the proper social navigational tools that tie us to someone, somewhere - not to everywhere, not just anywhere, and not to just anyone - are we just cut adrift like sailors on an ill-constructed ship without a way to turn back, as was Mr. Crowhurst? ...or in reacting to the lack of social sophistication of the past, are we throwing off all social ties, leaving our loved ones to muck alone through the consequences of the subtle, modern ways we promote social isolation in our own time? (Certainly, the social grounding that Britain offered in the 1960's served neither Crowhurst, nor any that were adversely affected by his desires or actions - DEEP WATER certainly does not advocate a return to it.) These were simply the questions that were being opened in me as I watched DEEP WATER...as I watched these people's faces then, and now.

Looking back on the events on which this movie is based it's easy to see that most of the people interviewed have matured to realize today, as we did not realize then, that it really wouldn't have mattered what would have socially befallen Mr. Crowhurst had he returned home and been exposed. No. The real tragedy is that we as a culture had put something in his way that made it more than difficult to simply return to what is now a beautiful, beautiful family and true friends, who just wanted him to come home...and it's evident that they still do. Blessings on them.",1200700800,6,3141,4.613595706618963

Nine people enter and this documentary has some footage but mostly interviews with relatives and secondary participants.  And there is the problem.  There is just not enough action, just the retelling of a story that is really not that compelling.

David Crowhurst is the main character who enters a race unqualified and sends back false locations at a time when he cold not be tracked by GPS or other devices.  The news builds but what do you do when you have charted yourself close to finishing but are not anywhere near finishing?  And therein lies the problem in this tragedy.

This is not a bad documentary.  There is just not enough action, not enough of a story to warrant a casual fan such as myself to enjoy this story.  Now, maybe for an addicted sailor this would be more interesting.",1200182400,2,898,4.632911392405063

His isolation and the nature of his dilemma, in conjunction with his intelligence, apparently forced him to find a ""cosmic"" resolution that might be compared to a much more famous ""forty days and forty nights"" of isolation in a desert.

Deep Water, on the other hand, emphasizes Crowhurst's economic plight portraying him more flatteringly as a kind of dreamy anti-hero. Readers of the Tomalin book will like the tidbits of old film footage but may find Crowhurst's tale constrained by the nature of the film medium and the editorial accommodations likely made for family members who are interviewed throughout.",1199145600,36,812,6.8173076923076925
3179362,4,B000VKL6ZW,"""Deep Water"" tells the strange story of Donald Crowhurst, an Englishman of limited sailing experience who was one of 9 men to take up the challenge issued by the Sunday Times in 1968: A non-stop single-handed boat race around the globe. There were doubts as to whether boat or human could withstand such an arduous, isolated journey. The first person to do it would win a Golden Globe. The fastest would win 5,000. Crowhurst was a struggling small businessman with a family who had never found the success he wanted from life. The opportunity for fame and prize money appealed to him. To get a sponsor to pay for his boat, Crowhurst staked all he had, including his house, on completing at least half of the race -a decision that would have bizarre and catastrophic consequences.

Crowhurst set sail in the 40-foot trimaran ""Teignmouth Electron"" on the date of the race deadline, October 31, 1968. The story of his voyage, his predicament, and surprising decisions is told through old 16mm movies taken on board the boat and interviews with son Simon and wife Clare Crowhurst, friend Ron Winspear, journalist Donald Kerr, and Ted Hynds, who was deputy to Crowhurst's dodgy press agent Rodney Hallworth. Competitors Robin Knox-Johnston and Bernard Moitessier provide an insider's perspective on the race, Moitessier in the form of films and logs, since he is deceased. Francoise Moitessier shares her husband's experience and her own. Along with Tilda Swinton's narration, they paint a compelling picture of this groundbreaking 10-month endurance test.

This is one of those rare documentaries that might suffer from spoilers, so I'll be vague. ""Deep Water"" superbly recreates Crowhurst's grave dilemma and his character which obliged him to cope as he did. It's fundamentally sympathetic to Crowhurst, more than I would have been, perhaps because those who knew him and were interviewed are understandably fond of the man. The filmmakers tactfully avoid saying that Crowhurst gambled the roof over his children's heads to satisfy his ego, and thereby became his own undoing. It also doesn't mention an obvious alternative which, in the end, Crowhurst failed to see. But between those two points, ""Deep Water"" is a penetrating and gripping account of a man trapped, almost literally, between the devil and the deep blue sea.

The DVD (IFC 2007): There are 4 featurettes and a theatrical trailer (2 min). ""The Sailors' Stories"" are text and interviews about the contestants. Alex Garozzo, Donald Crowhurst, Loick Fougeron, and John Ridgeway have brief text bios. Very worthwhile are interviews with Chay Blyth (5 min), Bill Leslie King (6 min), Robin Knox-Johnson (10 min) and with the widows of Bernard Moitessier (6 min) and Nigel Tetley (7 min). ""The Journalists' Story"" (11 min) recounts how the Sunday Times conceived of and reported the boat race, creating the story, not just reporting it, through interviews with journalists Murray Sayle and Philip Norman, editor Harold Evans, et al. ""The Family's Story"" (7 min) interviews wife Clare and 2 of the Crowhurst children about how they came to understand their father's actions. ""The Abandoned Boat"" uses some photos of the Teignmouth Electron to present 11 of Donald's audio recordings and some of his notes and diagrams. Subtitles are available for the film in English SDH and Spanish.",1198886400,26,3340,5.124770642201835
3179363,5,B000VKL6ZW,"This is a beautiful and compelling film. It is the story of the last voyage of Donald Crowhurst, a batty amateur of the finest British tradition: a man with a young family and a struggling business who became fixated on the forlorn quest to win the 1968 Sunday Times solo, non-stop round-the-world-yacht race.

Archive footage reveals that from the earliest stage Crowhurst, a tubby, cardigan-wearing thirty-seven-year-old inventor, had no idea what he was taking on. But he was certainly dressed for it: in a tie and slacks as he set off on the race! The poor man did not know what he was doing, how his plan had a hope of success, yet bizarrely he was financed, filmed and represented by people who ought to have known better.  Most strangely of all he was allowed, even out of his garden shed, by his wife, a woman revealed by the documentary to be otherwise a sober, sensible, reflective and thoughful woman.

One of many tragedies catalogued in this film is that no-one had the wherewithal or gumption to tell this poor chap - in no sense one of life's winners, and certainly not the sort to be up for a round-the-world solo yacht journey - not to be such a blazing fool.

Yet, like a Greek tragedy, plot developments thereafter pile inevitably on, compelling the poor man on when even he had twigged it was sheer madness: the oppressive terms of his financing, residual pride, his own ill-considered decisions to misreport his positions and, in the final strait, the sheer bad luck to have a couple of his competitors unexpectedly sink or go postal on him when all he needed them to do was simply complete the course ahead of him and allow him to finish in quiet, plucky British ignominy. Were it not for any of these, Donald Crowhurst might still have his unspectacular life, and still be running a failing electronics business, to this day.

But as it is, events conspired to a different course, and Crowhurst's elegaic and articulate descent into the abyss is capitvatingly rendered in this film, from logs, recordings and films he made en route, and in which he is portrayed without apparent exaggeration as a tragic hero, doomed by the course of this actions and the irresistable currents of human and physical nature, to a sad end.

Thoroughly recommended.

3179364,5,B000VKL6ZW,"In 1968 the Sunday Times of London sponsored a race to see who could circumnavigate the globe --solo and without stopping. Prizes were offered for the one who finished first and the one who finished fastest. Nine sailors entered the race, but this documentary film focuses on three contestants in particular-- Robin Knox-Johnston, who finished first by averaging 92 miles a day for 312 days (28,704 miles) and who appears in the film; the Frenchman Bernard Moitessier, who turned around just before finishing, forsaking fame and fortune for the isolation of the sea, and sailed an additional 10,000 miles to Tahiti (his book The Long Way tells his story); and then the amateur sailor and eccentric Donald Crowhurst who never should have entered the race under any circumstances. His bizarre story forms the real narrative of this film. It's difficult to say more without spoiling this film, but you can be sure that it's more of an exploration of the deep waters of the human psyche than an adventure tale. Interviews with family members and friends; archival film footage; news reels; diaries, audio tapes, 16mm film and ship logs by the sailors; and still photos lend authenticity to the pathos of this deeply human story.

3179374,3,B000VKL6ZW,"Like a few others have mentioned, this is not so much a book about the race as it is about Donald Crowhurst, the lone inexperienced 'average joe' competitor. The movie was beautifully filmed and narrated and has compelling current and past interviews and footage that make the subjects (especially Crowhurst's family and the other competitors) come alive.

However, there are problems. The participation of Crowhurst's son and widow, and their obvious emotional involvement, made me wonder about whether we get an accurate portrait of Crowhurst himself. The film treats Crowhurst as a dreamer and a victim of circumstance, when in reality he just wanted to escape the financial problems that he created, and got tangled in his own web of lies.

His widow and son have not recovered from their ordeal. That was very sad to watch - she seems to blame herself. The son says his father just wanted to get home to them, and I understand his need to feel that way, but based on his father's actions, it is hard to accept such a simple concept. Crowhurst had a chance to contact family when he was in Brazil; they were 'desperate' for news, but he didn't. The film implies he wasn't in his right mind at this point, but perhaps he just wanted to mask his deception more than he cared for the worries of his wife and children. Crowhurst wanted many things on his voyage, and his family must have been among them, but they took a back burner to his pride and sense of failure, certainly.

Ultimately, this film treats Crowhurst perhaps too kindly. The film treats his situation as if he was forced to choose only one of his four children from a fire or something. Financial ruin sucks, but he would have still had his family and his life. He could have made adult decisions. Instead he ran away looking for a pie in the sky solution, and then constructed elaborate falsehoods to cover his tracks. The rest of his problems flow from this original lie.

Forgiving me for saying, but I also found myself wondering whether he pretended to be mad in his journals to make his suicide more excusable than it would have been if he killed himself to avoid the fallout from his deception and financial ruin. It seems very plausible given his other lies.

Finally, like others have mentioned here, despite what I mentioned above, I do agree that the story has a whiff of Shakespearean tragedy/futility to it. That in itself makes it worth watching.

Tennyson wrote his famous poem about the Battle of the Light Brigade at Balaclava, and the retreat from Dunkirk is immortalized in the British consciousness.  Failures such as Gallipoli and the Battle of the Somme in WWI are written about with greater emotion and affection than any victory.  Every English schoolboy knows about Gordon's last days in Khartoum, Scott's failed march to the South Pole, Richard III fateful charge down Boswell field, and Harold's fall at Hastings. Let's add Donald Crowhurst and his boat Teignmouth Electron to the list. This supurb documentary tells the story of the 1968 Globe race which pitted solo sailors from around the world to see who could finish as the first  to circumnavigate solo around the world unaided.  The story focuses on three major figures: the eventual winner, Robin Knox Johnson, the great French sailor, Bernard Moitessier, and the oddball amateur Donald Crowhurst. The footage is often stunning; the story is compelling; and the outcome is Shakespearean tragedy.  No need to go into the story's detail, but Crowhurst found himself in an unrecoverable dilemma. He eventually resorted to fudging things, which grew into greater lies and then outright deceit.  Somehow, in the end, there is arguable redemption, but then that depends on your point of view and definition of failure.  There are so many twists in the story that one is reminded that reality writes more fantastic plots than whatever could be devised by fiction.  I've seen this documentary at least five times, and tear up throughout.  There are no weak points to this story.  As Crowhurst's friend, Ron Winspear states towards the end of the film: When somebody has risked and failed and when somebody has fallen from the tightrope they had been walking on. Someone has to pick them up and give them a burial.  Best thing is that a friend should do that...In my mind, I gave him a heros burial.

There's not much of a line between heroic quests and lunacy. That's one message of this movie that applies way beyond the rare world of sailing races.",1393891200,,692,4.372093023255814

3179417,5,B000VKL6ZW,"Deep Water chronicles the 1968 solo-handed round-the-world nonstop yacht race originating off the coast of Britain. It was dreamed up shortly after Sir Chichester successfully navigated the globe single-handed (but included stops for repairs) in a record 9 months and 1 day. I know nothing about yachting other than it's a rich man's sport, or so I thought. This documentary is about the race and the men who attempted to run it. I don't wish to ruin any of the surprises so I'll remain a bit vague in this review because I found it a bonus to go in knowing nothing about the subject. I was hooked after 10 minutes. You cannot make this stuff up! There is footage of many parts of the race and interviews with several of the principles and those closest to them, which adds to the poignancy of the event. The physical and psychological toll that the race would have on these men is beyond belief. The race serves as the backdrop for one of the most remarkable stories in sporting history, involving one of the participants, Donald Crowhurst an engineer and father of 4 small children, who jumped at the chance to realize a life-long dream.

3179425,5,B000VKL6ZW,"Excellent documentary. Keeps one riveted throughout. But to call this man any sort of hero is a total injustice to the meaning of the word, and to those men and women who truly are heroic. It seems quite clear that Donald Crowhurst wanted glory; he wanted to be recognized as a great man. Nothing uncommon there -- that same desire has been the downfall of many. He decided to place himself heavily in debt, and to risk the security of his family in order to chase after that glory. Again, nothing to really criticize for that decision; it was his right. However, within two weeks of leaving, he decided to cheat by sending in false locations. Then he decided to cut off radio communications so that his actual location couldn't be determined. Next he decides to wait the entire length of time, just drifting off the coast of South America, while all the other participants are actually sailing the course. This, so that as the others approached, he could join in. These were all conscious decisions he made to deceive the world. Not one lie, but lie after lie. Rather than facing up to his mistakes like a mature adult man, he chose the opposite -- to hide his mistakes, to falsify his actions. There is no doubt he would've continued right on into England with his concocted voyage but that the other ship sank, and his lies were sure to be exposed. It is a sad story indeed, and it's pitiful that his wife and children had to be subjected to such shame. But in reading these reviews, so many of which, try to justify or forgive his actions, I see what is so wrong with attitudes today. It seems that no one is to be held accountable for his own actions. Mrs Crowhurst states that she was angry and blamed everybody and everything. Well, how about blaming Mr Crowhurst? He alone decided to lie and cheat. He could have just as easily turned around, sailed home, admitted failure, and faced his financial difficulties. Now that would've been courage.",1391212800,4,1951,4.577142857142857

3179430,5,B000VKL6ZW,"I have watched this film at least 5-times now. I've bought most of the books relating to the participants, especially Donald Crohurst, the anti-hero, the man who's initial lack of integrity seems to be his undoing. But when you realize why Crowhurst ended his life the that way he did, you realize that his courage and sacrifice were undoubtely the greatest of all the contestants. He made series of misjudgments which, true, got him in to an impossible position. But when you REALLY understand why he made his final choice, you understand the courage, integrity and strength of the man.

Of course, the story is about Knox-Johnston, Tetley and Moitessier as well, along with the others, ALL of whom deserve tremendous credit for their courage in taking part in the first ever attempted solo-circumnavigation of the globe.

But this film seems to mostly focus on Crowhurst, lending insight in to the human psyche and what compels men to take great risks...some succeeding, others failing...and some actually CHOOSING to fail.

It's a FASCINATING and extremely well-done documentary. The quality of the story telling, the narration, the editing, the musical score and the cinematography reminds one of a Ken Burns film...one for the modern age. The tragedy, the joy, the hopes, dreams and fears are wonderfully captured, through mostly direct actuality interviews. It's a masterpiece of it's time.

3179433,5,B000VKL6ZW,"The sea is an enormous and unforgiving place for even the most experienced sailor. The first successful solo circumnavigation in 1967 took 274 days not including a six week layover in Sydney. In 1968 the London Sunday Times newspaper hosted a race for solo sailors to do the same voyage and to make it interesting it was to be done unaided and without touching land. But this documentary is only about the race in part, indeed the race only forms the backdrop to the real story. The central subject is one hapless amateur sailor hoping to make a name for himself. The prize money would go a long way in getting him out of financial strife and the publicity would give his sagging electronics business a needed boost.
He made hurried preparations and with a shoestring budget built a catamaran which was untested for sailing in the notoriously difficult southern ocean and outfitted with a prototype of an electronic navigation system of his own design. Everything that could go wrong was going wrong even before he set sail. He was the last boat out and there were concerns that if he left any later he would sail into the southern ocean during its stormiest season when gale force winds could blow relentlessly.
As he made his way south towards the equator things began falling apart - not the least the sailor himself. I won't spoil it for the viewer to describe what ensues but it is a truly strange tale of madness.",1388707200,,1419,4.634920634920635

A very sad and depressing story, and quite boring. Why would anyone watch this?

3179452,4,B000VKL6ZW,"I liked this documentary. The screen footage, interviews, and historical context were philosophical, and interesting. My review is also philosophical.

First, a documentary like this has to have a point of view, even if subtle.  In this case the filmmakers choose to use the ethics of sailing, and failure in sailing equates to failure in general. In typical British fashion, the sailor almost has the weight of the British Empire to uphold, and the die is cast. There's a heavy set of Christian/Judaic ethics that almost pre-dooms the hero.

One can accept this thesis, or not; I chose not.

If the only true failures in life are those who never try anything, then the main character is a hero. After a life of conformity, he took a chance. He managed to stay alive for almost a year on a small sailboat. In taking the chance he is akin to a mountain climber.  Although he doesn't reach the top, by simply trying he exceeds those who never even try.

At the end perhaps he felt like a failure, or perhaps he simply did not want to go back to a life where he met others' expectations.

This movie definitely met that goal. This was a documentary type movie of men who were going to sail around the world. It was entertaining and because it was telling a true story, it definitely kept me glued to the screen. The home video of the family and the children watching as Dad went off to sea were powerful for setting an impression of how many eyes were watching him and how much pressure was on him to succeed. I think it was a very sad story. To me, it said a lot about a man's ego. I do not think they are all fragile, but some of them can be and this movie helped me to understand why.

3179456,5,B000VKL6ZW,"A great film, and wouldn't change much about it since it was really about Donald Crowhurst, but it leaves me wanting to know more about the others in the race.

The frenchman who was on track to win it, but instead continued sailing halfway again around the world because he found the poetry of the profound solitude and oneness with creation so compelling.

The other, and only one to finish and receive the prize money, then gave it away to Crowhurst's family.

I only wish it were a longer film that explored the themes of compare and contrast between the participants. Also so many spiritual themes to explore that such a voyage can't help but stir up...

THEY THAT GO DOWN TO THE SEA IN SHIPS, that do business in great waters; These see the works of the LORD, and his wonders in the deep. For he commandeth, and raiseth the stormy wind, which lifteth up the waves thereof. They mount up to the heaven, they go down again to the depths: their soul is melted because of trouble. They reel to and fro, and stagger like a drunken man, and are at their wits' end. Then they cry unto the LORD in their trouble, and he bringeth them out of their distresses. He maketh the storm a calm, so that the waves thereof are still. Then are they glad because they be quiet; so he bringeth them unto their desired haven. Psalms, 107:23-30

Back in the days before satellite navigation and video links the oceans were where a man or woman and a small boat could disappear for months at a time away from human contact or sight of land. Against this profound isolation, solo deep water sailors brought only their wits, experience and their small wood and steel craft to tackle a challenge so formidable that many considered the feat to be impossible due to the psychological stress alone. Nine contestants showed up, mostly from a field of highly experienced and capable deep water sailors. The film follows the exception, novice sailor Donald Crowhurst's voyage, which today seems equally audacious, foolhardy, brave and inevitable from the moment of its conception to its surprising finale.

A tale of Don Crowhurst.  He wanted great things for himself and his family.  Too much perhaps, more than he could manage.  Though failed in his quest, he dreamed big, and carried through to the point of putting himself on the line.

It was more than he was capable of.  He is like Icarus who flies too close to the sun.

He did things we normally find abhorrent.  Trying to feign greatness by cheating.  Yet such was his quest, so high his vision, and so short did he fall we can forgive him for being merely human.  His humanity brought him back to earth, and caused him to take actions that finally make his final testament one of justness.  That saved his legacy in a very strange way.

One can find his actions reprehensible, and at the same time put themselves so easily in his place to see how very likely it is many of us would end up the same in those circumstances.  A very human story.",1376179200,,979,4.278688524590164

I guess you can put it the same category with ""Grizzly Man"" because it deals with a man's (misguided) relationship with nature & his attempt to redeem himself in his own mind & how he feels he must appear to his family, friends & society. It is also every bit as excellent as Herzog's legendary piece.
 I don't want to give much away. Simon Crowhurst's tale is fascinating by itself. It is told through the eyes of history & family members tragically affected by his failure to realize & accept that he was getting in too far over his head. (I actually think that Crowhurst is a more sympathic figure that GM's Timothy Treadwell who, let's face it, got is girlfriend horribly killed.) We all have some Crowhurst inside of us but not to this degree.
 This doc also explores the siren call of the open seas, a world when techno-saturation was still in its infancy (no ONSTAR for your cork in the ocean)& a nation's pride. It is also a tale about a thrilling sailing competition & another sailor/navigator who didn't get lost in his dreams...at least he didn't apparently die chasing them. Curiously, it may very well be that Crowhurst didn't ultimately die either, but he did get forever lost.

3179480,4,B000VKL6ZW,"During the first nonstop, solo race to sail around the world, novice distance sailor Donald Crowhurst signed up, delighting the British media.  He added to the colorful story, with his newly designed boat and his talk of special gadgets. His start, within hours of the last possible starting time allowed by race rules, was underwhelming, and his boat's speed indicated that Crowhurst wasn't the optimal sailor.

But the sporadic radio reports indicated that he was plodding along, headed for the southern oceans to begin that scary trip through the Roaring Forties.

Then, miraculously, he radioed that he had set a new one day sailing distance record, and after another month, he was actually a contender in the race.  As other boats dropped out, he was suddenly one of only four boats left, then three.  And it looked like he might actually win the timed race.

Only Crowhurst had never made the trip.  He came to the realization, near the tip of South America, that his experience and his boat would, at best, have a 50-50 chance of succeeding though the southern seas.  To return to England would lead to financial ruin and humiliation.  To go forward led to death.  So he faked his progress, hoping to rejoin the race as the other boats started their final run back to England in the north.  This decision had tragic consequences.

This movie, Deep Water, is a collection of authentic film clips of Crowhurst along with narrations from his logbook, and supplemented with interviews of his children, his wife, his promoters, and other sailors.

Eerie and tragic.  It almost seems that this tale was a made-for-television fictional event, but it was all true.",1375315200,,1663,4.892857142857143

3179487,3,B000VKL6ZW,"** Warning: SPOILERS **

As a documentary focusing on Donald Crowhurst's attempt to circumnavigate the world solo in 1968, this was mainly flawed by an over-sympathetic approach, resolutely biased to try and  present him as a 'hero', hopelessly torn between saving his family (whose financial ruin he ensured) and trying to save his life (which he recklessly endangered all by himself).

While hardly mentioning and giving due credit to the exploits of the other participants, true sailing heroes, starting with Robin Knox-Johnston, a true sailor and a gentleman, as well as Bernard Moitessier, Nigel Tetley and all the others, this documentary seems to have been made with the sole purpose of making the Crowhurst family feel better about their loss.

Unfortunately, after watching this overlong and biased documentary, I feel not one iota of pity or compassion for a cheater and a liar.  And not a lot for his family either.  Seriously, what happened to taking responsibility for our mistakes?  The media involved (The Sunday Times and the BBC etc.) and Crowhurst's PR manager are of course also to blame as they clearly exploited and pushed a weak-minded man into making a major decision which he was not capable of assuming, a mistake he then compounded again and again over the course of several months.  This story is a perfect cautionary tale about wanting fame and fortune without being willing to pay the required price - usually by devoting one's life to acquiring the skills and endurance necessary to reach such an ambitious goal successfully.

You may find my point of view very harsh, but I believe trying to justify cheating and lying as 'a game that went out of control' or 'losing touch with reality' as this documentary repeatedly does is an endemic and moral problem, similar to justifying  doping in sports or plagiarism in literature:  any such pity for a failure should be curtailed and cheaters and liars should not be excused in my opinion.  Especially when one considers that Donald Crowhurst dug his own grave by an attempt he was wholly unqualified for. Failure can be glorious, but cheating cannot ever be pitied or excused.

Your mileage may vary of course but I really disliked the exculpatory tone of this documentary which I felt was trying to emotionally manipulate the viewer a bit too obviously.  Note that I am not suggesting his family and friends should be harassed for or reminded of Crowhurst's moral failings - they clearly already blame themselves - and I do not pretend to know if they are right to blame themselves:  this is something only they know and furthermore is really none of our business.

Yes, documentaries may not always be perfectly objective and may not contain all the truth - in cases when it is unknown, for instance - but they should be unbiased or aim to minimize their bias at the very least.  This is most definitely not the case here.

A far better approach would have been to film this as a fictional movie (a la 'based on a true story'), a structure which would have neatly circumvented most of the problems I had with this movie.",1374105600,,3098,4.8352272727272725
3179488,5,B000VKL6ZW,"I had, several times, passed up the chance to watch this film - both when it was in theatres as well as when selecting something to watch from the Prime lineup. I'm not sure why I clicked into it tonight - but I am glad I did. This is without doubt something to watch - not for the adventure aspect, although that is there; but more for the human aspects, and what we can learn and take away from this.

Without giving spoilers, what I found interesting were some of the side stories - those stories which, while important to the entirety of the whole, were incidental, running parallel with the Crowhurst narrative.  Delicately filmed, rivetingly interviewed, and fascinatingly intimate, this film takes you from the land through the seas - both physical as well as spiritual.

The challenges of telling this story in a sensitive, enlightening manner was well accomplished by the directors and producers. You are left questioning what, in fact, happens to someone who is so long isolated while being faced with life and death decisions in every moment - what happens to the human mind, the human soul, the human heart when faced with such naked life-or-death times.  And how do different people cope with the same, or at least very similar, circumstances?

The delicate weaving of several story-lines through photographs, movies, log books and interviews creates a sense of 'now-ness', bringing you into the environment of the man Donald Crowhurst, his wife, the other competitors, the press agents, and the journalists involved. In a brilliant editing job, these very different views are used to create a complete view - and, while the view is necessarily missing pieces, there are enough pieces present for you to actually feel the emotions...and understand the silences and pressures faced by all.

The momentary glimpse of Crowhurst's early days, coupled with interviews from his widow and one of his sons, tells a story of a man who, despite grave misgivings, ventures into a race around the world...and a race with self - an introspective, good-and-evil confrontation and questioning of the meaning of life in a fully rounded tale. The contrasting tale of Moitessier and his wife, and the actions he took, demonstrated another aspect of the 'winning' of a race - and of the fears one may not be able to conquer.

Together with the balance of the film, it is both uplifting and confronting, assaultive and informative, but above all, you are left with a deep sadness for a man who risked it all - and lost.

The outrage I felt at having wasted the final hours of a Sunday night, before I have to go to bed and then rise for another day at work, watching this horrible account instead of watching the uplifting story I'd hoped for, are what prompt me to write this review.

I'll say this, the filmmakers chose the wrong subject on which to base the film. If they'd chosen the other 8 sailors as the focus of their story and left this one to a 5-10 minute footnote, they would have really had a picture to be proud of. Instead they chose the footnote to be placed into the limelight, and in so doing to place into obscurity and insignificance the true courage, and daring and out of this world toughness that folks hold up as the true ideals in life. But perhaps that is exactly what the filmmakers planned to do.

In making this film they not only lower the tone of any who watch, but they also rub a generous portion of salt into the wounds of those who have to live with the mans mistake. ""Here, everybody look at the failure. See, we've made an hour and a half film about the failure and phony. See, here is his family so that you can recognize them in public and regard them in the most pitiful way so that their lives from here on out my not recover.""

The first choice is he turns back to England and admits his ship just was not seaworthy to the rough seas. The second choice was he sets into port and fixes the ship and limps on toward completing the voyage, while setting into port and making repairs as needed. The story makes it clear my two choices were unacceptable to him, but they were really the only choices he had. I say these choices were the ones because in the end he could not live without being an honest man. He would not have won the race in both of my choices, but just attempting the journey is what sells stories.

The movie is rather well done, and it will tell you ""something"" about the race, and that's why I gave it three stars.

But husband consented to watch the beginning, and by the end of the movie, I said, ""You're still here."" (He had said he would leave after the beginning to go do something else.)

He admitted it was a good documentary.

It isn't just about sailing, although that's mainly why I wanted to watch it. It is, however, a scary look at man's psyche.

*SPOILER*: It was interesting to me that Donald Crowhurst and Bernard Moitessier both decided not to go home again, but they decided to do different things instead.

I like to think I'm more of the Moitessier type. But I do admire Crowhurst for his inventions, his bravery (although husband said, ""He was an idiot to set sail without thorough preparation,"" which is true. Part of being a good sailor is knowing how and when to fit your boat. And to do a good shakedown sail before making long distance voyages.), and just because.

There's a book which I got, in addition to the movie: _The Strange Last Voyage of Donald Crowhurst_. I didn't appreciate the snideness of the authors, but I did appreciate that they included a lot of Crowhurst's journal entries. Fascinating man.

3179553,4,B000VKL6ZW,"In the late-1960s an English weekend sailor named Donald Crowhurst felt that he was - in some ways - imprisoned by life. In his mid-thirties, Crowhurst had a wife, four young children, and a reasonably-successful career as an engineer. But Crowhurst sought something else and he gradually became obsessed with joining a race to become the first person to sail around the world, solo, without stopping.

Crowhurst eventually joined the 1968 race - against eight more-experienced sailors. Prior to the race, the English press championed underdog Crowhurst. But Crowhurst had a difficult time finding a seaworthy vessel and he faced financial ruin if he backed out. Eventually, at the last possible moment, Crowhurst set sail from England.

Deep Water is the true story of how one bad decision can often lead us to make even worse decisions later. For most viewers, Crowhurst will be an ambivalent figure. On the one hand, he had the courage to chase his dreams. On the other, he ignored the potential harm that his choices could have for those who loved him.

The film contains some amazing, beautiful shots of the oceans. The viewers begin to understand the sea's power - and its indifference to our fates. Also, in recounting the race, Deep Water reveals what it is like to sail in the open ocean, alone, for months on end. Finally, there are some good descriptions of the eight competitors in the race - many of whom are fascinating in their own right. (I would like to see an update of what happened to the people in the film after the race was over).

Deep Water reminds us that dreams aren't free. Conventional wisdom tells us that we should take more chances - after all, we typically regret the chances that we don't take more than those that we do take. But at what point do the costs become too high? The film doesn't have the answer, but it does force the viewer to consider these questions while also recounting some interesting events.

This documentary is NOT about sailing.

Admittedly, he may have had some inner instability, but who doesn't? Consider the Frenchman who, closing in on the finish, reversed course completely to sail around the world a second time! That's another story, in and of itself worthy of a documentary. Nine months at sea completely alone would test any man.

3179556,3,B000VKL6ZW,"This is an odd film which appears to attempt to turn a rather flawed human being -- an unstable liar and cheat -- into a hero.  I can appreciate the fact that Donald Crowhurst's family want to think well of him, but the film makers really owe us a more balanced picture.  The film says at one point that Crowhurst had tried other careers, but it doesn't tell us that he was asked to resign from both the RAF and the Royal Army for conduct unbecoming, etc. He was a man who never really grew up, and to say that he was a player of games as an excuse for what he did (attempting to fake a voyage around the world) really doesn't excuse his basic dishonesty.  A classical hero is a good and great man with a single flaw.  Crowhurst was a weak and flawed man with a few good qualities (he appears to have loved his wife and children).  Paranoid Schizophrenia (which reading Crowhurst's logs clearly reveals) is not, I believe, something that happens to a person who is psychologically reasonably strong.  So trying to present Crowhurst as a sort of hero is, at best odd, at worst a misrepresentation.  Far more interesting to me are the brief bits in the extras sections about Robin Knox Johnson and my own favorite, Bill King.

3179557,5,B000VKL6ZW,"1968.  In the pre-GPS era, Briton Francis Chichester becomes the first person to sail single-handedly around the world, after a brief stop in Australia for repairs.  His achievement inspires the London `Times' newspaper to sponsor a round-the-world yacht race which will challenge the world's best yachtsmen to go one better;  to sail single-handedly around the world without stopping, and without assistance from any third party.  Total Solitude for anything up to a year.

Using Chichester's achievement as a preface, ""Deep Water"" chronicles the pre-race excitement and preparations, profiles the nine men who accept the challenge, then tells the story of the race itself, all the way to its haunting conclusion and inspiring legacy.  Although its principal focus is on Donald Crowhurst,  the `dark horse' among a field of experienced and famous yachtsmen,  the whole 90-minute story is one of risk, adventure, solitude, shipwreck, survival, deception, triumph, failure, eccentricity, descent into madness, and - tragically - crushing bereavement.  To say any more would spoil the suspense;  suffice it only to add that not all of the nine men finished, and not all survived.

Interviews with surviving personalities (including family members) combined with clips of archived footage and an articulate narrative make this a very well-coordinated documentary, in fact, now the best I have ever seen. I've watched it four times in the last year, and find it's one of those rare tales that reveals something new each time.  Only this last time, for instance,  it struck me that - surprisingly - not a single American entered the race;  all the contestants were Europeans (actually British and French), almost as though they were the last in that great line of continental adventurers in the tradition of Columbus, DaGama, Drake, Magellan, Tasman, Cook, and others.  Then it occurred to me that in 1968-69, these last great adventurers from the Old World were setting out one last time to sail around it,  just as the first adventurers from the New World were setting out away from it, toward the moon.  With each viewing, though, I found myself haunted by man's inner heart of darkness, about which so much is disturbingly revealed in this gripping tale.  The last 10-15 minutes are particularly moving, perhaps even disturbing.

I'm just over 50, but I still wonder that in my lifetime we have seen the transition from self-dependence (using a sextant and knowing the stars), to the global inter-connectivity of GPS, weather radar, and advanced communications which now make such voyages almost unadventurous.  I couldn't help feeling that these men had more in common with those heroes of centuries ago, than with the more recent mariners of today,  who are their actual contemporaries.

Among the bonus features are logs and film recovered from one sad, derelict vessel of a sailor who didn't make it, and recent short interviews with a real-life cast of characters from what will soon be a forgotten world. There are references to that old classic Anglo-French rivalry,  and we see the eccentricities of a very special group of larger-than-life heroes (look for the swashbuckling Scotsman who later became the first person to sail solo around the world in the wrong direction,  not to mention the gallant Frenchman who abandoned fame and fortune to achieve self-fulfillment - right out of Saint-Exupery!).  I did find, however, that at least one of the biographies in the bonus features section stopped short for reasons that are not clear;  for the full and ultimately tragic story of Nigel Tetley, I recommend you look him up on Wikipedia.

Never mind if you're not a sailor - I'm not;  this is about so much more than life on the high seas and the wild oceans.  There's something in this for everyone, but especially those who want their heroes not to be country-men, or company-men, or men of any kind of institution, but men's men;  individualists in the classic sense, whose strengths derive from something deep within.

This story continues to grow on me, and - significantly - on all those to whom I have recommended it. To explain in full why this documentary is so compelling and so good would spoil the show.  So trust me far enough to spend $4 (used) for what in my humble opinion is the best documentary ever made.  I am certain you will not regret it.",1266192000,19,4368,5.013869625520111

3179563,5,B000VKL6ZW,"Have you ever found yourself watching a film or documentary and having to hold yourself back from screaming things like ""No! Don't do it!""? No? Well it's time you do. And undoubtedly DEEP WATER is the one to get you started.

The story is based on that of Donald Crowhurst and his entry into the first round-the-world yacht race to be undertaken by individuals in 1968. That word ""individuals"" is important, as the men who set off on this nearly suicidal escapade head out alone.

Most of the men are well-knowns in the sea-faring communities of England (where they launch from), but one of them is the ""unknown dark horse,"" and his name was Donald Crowhurst. Struggling financially, Crowhurst enlists a backer who can take everything from him should he fail to at least attempt to make it through a large portion of the race. He could take his home, his property, everything.

Crowhurst now finds himself between a rock and ...well ...deep water: either attempt the race with an unproven ship and an unproven captain, or lose everything you own (which was significant since Crowhurst had a wife and several children). You'll note the term ""unproven captain"" in there, too. Not only was he unproven, he'd never been out on the open sea! Did I mention suicidal?

Flicking between archival footage of the pre- and post-race, and those of Crowhurst's friends, family, and acquaintances of today, Deep Water is put together masterfully. Initially seen as a poor sap who got in over his head, the film gradually shows you the limited choices Crowhurst had after months and months out on the water. His ship leaks. Equipment breaks. Pysche stretched to the breaking point (and beyond). Crowhurst finds himself lost in an internal struggle with no successful way out. It is interesting, too, to see the psychological breaks that other racers have as they deal with their solitary confinement on-board their respective boats.

The wave-like emotions that you'll feel as you watch this astounding documentary may make you a bit ill (not unlike trying to get your sea-legs). And you'll probably be frustrated at the choices being made; perhaps just as frustrated as poor Mr. Crowhurst.

The ending is also amazing in that we get to see the actual ship that Crowhurst sailed, sitting deserted and rotting on a Caribbean beach ...not unlike other things that felt deserted and rotting toward the end of this poorly thought-out race.

Of all the participants, Crowhurst was the least experienced and the least prepared. The race began in England and participants had a window of several months during which they could leave before the weather turned against them. While all the others had left weeks before, Crowhurst finally had his boat ready on the very last day possible. Remember, this was before GPS and the only contact was when they happened to be in range of radio contact. Several, including Crowhurst, had movie cameras along as well as audio taping equipment to record their journey. From the beginning Crowhurst had laid everything on the line. His financial future was tied to the success of the race. What makes someone in the prime of life risk family, finances and future on a challenge that only proves you can do something no one else has done? Why didn't family or friends or both talk him out of this utterly absurd expedition? What a person does when they face the ultimate challenge in his life reveals his character.

Well done documentary about the first round-the-world race and it's oddest conclusion.",1207353600,3,538,4.604166666666667
3179566,4,B000VKL6ZW,This DVD was very good.  I did not find it long and drawn out.  There was a very small portion that was slow but it was still a very compelling story.  For any one that sails or if your thinking about setting sail view this movie.  It is about one mans journey who sails around the world who had no sailing expeience and got caught up in the hype of his trip and could not back out.,1204761600,2,382,3.9220779220779223
3179567,5,B000VKL6ZW,"This is a most astounding documentary about the first solo sailing race around the world, focused largely on one of the participants, from a psychological perspective.  It addresses the most profound questions of human existence.  Watching it left me in stunned silence. The special features include detailed information about all the participants, journalists, and family members.  After watching this 5-star movie, the special features are so good that I'd rate them by themselves as a 4-star movie, they are that good.  Bravo! Outstanding.",1203638400,8,542,5.493975903614458
3179568,4,B000VKL6ZW,"In 1968 nine sailors set out to capture a L5000 prize offered by the Sunday Times of London to the first man to sail around the world single handed. One finished.

This documentary focuses on the story of Bernard Crowhurst, a struggling inventor with limited sailing experience, money, and support, but no lack of ambition. He was right, as we know now, a multi-hulled boat would be the fastest. But Crowhurst lacked the resources to build a boat suitable to circle the globe. None the less, he sets out at the last possible moment to win the race. He soon recognizes that he faces financial ruin if he does not complete the race and certain death if he continues. This documentary uses original 16mm footage, interviews with fellow competitors and family, and entries from his log to explore his experience and tragedy at sea.

Artistically and tastefully done, Deep Water, is a compelling story of one man's ambition and the lure of the sea.

3179569,4,B000VKL6ZW,"Although not as riveting as Touching the Void, a previous film by this team, Deep Water contains some unique historical footage of one of the most extraordinary ocean sailing sagas in history and as such, makes compelling viewing for anyone with an interest in ocean voyaging in general or of the Golden Globe Race in particular.  More use could have been made of Bernard Moitessier's vivid images and of the footage available about other competitors, instead of repeating a boring and ultimately meaningless motif of storm-wracked seas to heighten drama.  Nonetheless, this film provides a splendid insight into the motivations of these lone sailors, the zeitgeist of the times, and the reality of ocean voyaging under sail.",1201737600,,725,5.188034188034188

3179571,5,B000VKL6ZW,"""Nowdays...you can pinpoint your position to a few feet on any portion of the globe. In the 60's that just wasn't the case. Don Crowhurst sailed over the horizon and effectively into oblivion."" --- Deep Water

GPS - open any map and we can know exactly where we are on the globe today. For those of us who were learning to navigate land and sea in the 1960's, it just was not so. Few amateurs knew how to use a sextant; nor could the average person afford one. For the most part, on any given day we knew where we were relative to other landmarks around us. But the thought that you could know precisely to the foot where you were eluded all but the most sophisticated. And the exact same was true for how the majority of people defined their social and personal identity as well...and I am not speaking metaphorically, either.

Today my children take their GPS for granted. The world is mapped...every square inch. Today we know where we are not in relation to something else, but just in relation to where we are...which defines to us where everything else is. And beyond the physical description of where we are, today my children know and can articulate the manner in which their culture, and their society, and their family shapes them. But it was not so in the 1960's...it was not so. When Donald Crowhurst sailed over the horizon, he indeed sailed not only into a geographical oblivion, he also sailed off the social map in a very real way. And as we bid him farewell, we who grew up back then were as certain of this geographically, as we were socially.

It's interesting that today Western culture advocates venturing over social horizons so glibly. The assumption is that in so doing, self-disclosure awaits. But without the proper social navigational tools that tie us to someone, somewhere - not to everywhere, not just anywhere, and not to just anyone - are we just cut adrift like sailors on an ill-constructed ship without a way to turn back, as was Mr. Crowhurst? ...or in reacting to the lack of social sophistication of the past, are we throwing off all social ties, leaving our loved ones to muck alone through the consequences of the subtle, modern ways we promote social isolation in our own time? (Certainly, the social grounding that Britain offered in the 1960's served neither Crowhurst, nor any that were adversely affected by his desires or actions - DEEP WATER certainly does not advocate a return to it.) These were simply the questions that were being opened in me as I watched DEEP WATER...as I watched these people's faces then, and now.

Looking back on the events on which this movie is based it's easy to see that most of the people interviewed have matured to realize today, as we did not realize then, that it really wouldn't have mattered what would have socially befallen Mr. Crowhurst had he returned home and been exposed. No. The real tragedy is that we as a culture had put something in his way that made it more than difficult to simply return to what is now a beautiful, beautiful family and true friends, who just wanted him to come home...and it's evident that they still do. Blessings on them.",1200700800,6,3141,4.613595706618963
3179572,3,B000VKL6ZW,"It's a vaguely interesting story, a large prize is offered for solo sailors to sail around the world.  Nine people enter and this documentary has some footage but mostly interviews with relatives and secondary participants.  And there is the problem.  There is just not enough action, just the retelling of a story that is really not that compelling.

David Crowhurst is the main character who enters a race unqualified and sends back false locations at a time when he cold not be tracked by GPS or other devices.  The news builds but what do you do when you have charted yourself close to finishing but are not anywhere near finishing?  And therein lies the problem in this tragedy.

This is not a bad documentary.  There is just not enough action, not enough of a story to warrant a casual fan such as myself to enjoy this story.  Now, maybe for an addicted sailor this would be more interesting.",1200182400,2,898,4.632911392405063
3179573,3,B000VKL6ZW,"As an admirer of the book by Tomalin and Hall (read in 1970) I was disappointed that this film completely ignored the true nature of Crowhurst's mental dissolution. One journal alone contained 12,000 words aligning himself with and exploring nearly every religious notion our species has toyed with. His isolation and the nature of his dilemma, in conjunction with his intelligence, apparently forced him to find a ""cosmic"" resolution that might be compared to a much more famous ""forty days and forty nights"" of isolation in a desert. Anyone interested should read the book for the real story and then use the film for backup",1199318400,5,626,4.9714285714285715

Tomalin and Hall's book is a psychological portrait of a small town intellectual desperate for recognition and success. Deep Water, on the other hand, emphasizes Crowhurst's economic plight portraying him more flatteringly as a kind of dreamy anti-hero. Readers of the Tomalin book will like the tidbits of old film footage but may find Crowhurst's tale constrained by the nature of the film medium and the editorial accommodations likely made for family members who are interviewed throughout.",1199145600,36,812,6.8173076923076925
