4657308,4,B005D7E7PY,"Season 6 of Gunsmoke would mark the last of the half-hour black and white shows.  It would also be the last year the show would rank as the Number 1 show on TV.  Gunsmoke ranked a very respectable No. 8 in its first season.  As the actors matured in their roles, it would rocket to the No. 1 spot and stay there for the next four years.  Dennis Weaver's Chester Goode helped out in the Marshall's Office and all was right with the show.  I have always considered these shows to be the golden years of Gunsmoke.  These episodes relied very heavily on recycled scripts from the admittedly superior radio show.  If you have never heard the radio shows, you owe it to yourself to give them a try.)

Season 7 the show's time slot expanded to a full hour and Gunsmoke dropped to No. 10.  The half-hour scripts were stretched to fit the hour format and story pace suffered.  It would continue to drop in the ratings down to a low of No. 34 in season 12. Dennis Weaver left the show after two seasons of hour-long episodes.  Chester's last season the show ranked at No. 20.  The following season it dropped to No. 27.  The loss of Chester was a big deal to someone like me, who had watched the show since its premiere.  After his departure, I lost interest in the show.  I probably would not be interested in buying the later seasons.  Ken Curtis's Festus was cute for about 15 minutes the first time I saw him.  After that, I couldn't figure out why no one wanted to strangle him - and I really liked Ken Curtis as an actor-singer.  Did you know he was one of the original ""Sons of the Pioneers"" singing group?)

In season 12 (1967) color was added and Gunsmoke would climb back to be in the top ten for six straight years.  Too few shows dealt primarily with Matt Dillon.  The secondary characters do not interest me.  I would like a collection of episodes where Matt rides off alone and the entire plot is about his adventure.

Through all the years, I have never tired of James Arness and his appealing portrayal of Marshall Matt Dillon.

The half-season releases ARE an irritant.  What will they do when the show length doubles - issue quarter-seasons?  The audience for these old, black and white shows is dying off.  At the rate they are releasing this series, the audience for the COLOR shows will have died off before all of THOSE have been released.  I am old enough to wonder whether I will ever see the release of Dennis Weaver's last season.

The quality of the half-hour shows was all 5-Star material - even the first season and the quality of the digital transfers is truly spectacular.

The 4-star rating is for the lack of ANY bonus material.  The main stars are long gone now, but there surely are decades worth of interviews and TV historians who could be called upon to record enlightening commentaries.

4657317,5,B005D7E7PY,"This was the number one TV show for this season.  The characters had settled into their roles, the half hour show was perfect for the writers making for great entertainment.  This season, the show expanded beyond the standard western story line. Looking at emotions and failings as much as standard western fair.
Johnny Red, Crowbait Bob and Jailbait Janet are two excellent examples of this expansion.  Both are somewhat comic and at the same time very realistic and human.  This is not to say the season lacks westerns, Horse Deal and Kangaroo is one of the better stories.
The season is split into two purchases and you will want to make both purchases at once.",1477094400,,664,4.747826086956522

4657321,5,B005D7E7PY,"Gunsmoke provides western-lovers with a family-friendly great show that emphasizes character, law & order, and good plain common sense. This half-season, as well as all previous episodes, provide a breath of fresh air in an age when many of the most entertaining movies have drifted from such character-building values. It is amazing to me that the writers were successful in making the plot and storyline consistently excellent and among the best of the classic Westerns from season to season for so many consecutive seasons. I cannot think of one episode to date that felt weak or that let me down.

Definitely a great addition for the video library of anyone who likes the Western genre, or who likes solid character and good role models in the primary characters, and a strengthening of the ideas of justice, fair play, the rule of law, and even compassion and wisdom throughout.",1471564800,,883,4.966216216216216

Sadly this is not the cast with some TV show on television today. DVD reviews are hard to write because is it all personal preference.

In the final scene, Matt and Chester visit the Cobb household to speak with the husband.  However, Mrs. Cobb persuades them to sit down for coffee and pie.

When Matt enters the home, he is wearing his gun and holster.

When Matt rises from the table after eating, both the gun and the holster are missing!

However, even with this mistake, this is a fine story about the cruelty of spousal abuse.

4657392,5,B005D7E7PY,"The first six years were half-hour episodes. Originally adaptations of the radio scripts from 1952-1955, the producers by season five discovered that original teleplays were also beneficial. For anyone keeping track, Columbia House put ""Gunsmoke"" out on DVD years ago and stopped in the middle of the fourth season. So even if you think you have all the half hour episodes, guess again. CBS has finally cracked past the Columbia House releases. The hour-long episodes have aired on the Starz Encore Westerns Channel. So Season Six is all we Gunsmoke fans need to enjoy the best years of the program. Yeah, the hour-long colors were not as intriguing and were eventually padded. But the black and white years were the best and Season Five and Six are the cream of the crop.

Picture quality is superb and my only gripe is that the studio put bonus features on the DVDs. Seriously, there are historians out there who know their stuff and wrote books about Gunsmoke. CBS couldn't contact them about rare footage such as blooper reels? When CBS came out with ""The Wild, Wild West,"" they had a slew of bonus features. Same for ""Hogan's Heroes."" Why not ""Gunsmoke""?",1322006400,5,1159,4.824120603015075

The picture and sound quality are excellent and the content is the way television should be done today. I was pleased to see the tribute to the great great James Arness that was included on this edition. It must have been added at the last minute but was fitting to do so. Gunsmoke is my all time favorite TV series but I am finding that the earlier seasons were superior to the later hour long episodes. As good as Festus was in these later episodes, I think Chester may have been even better! All in all, Gunsmoke was a treasure chest of Characters!!",1320710400,10,655,4.377049180327869
4657395,5,B005D7E7PY,"This is considered one of the best if not the best western ever made. It certainly is in my book. Great ensemble cast and acting.
Sadly,the great James Arness who played Marshal Matt Dillon passed away earlier this year. He will be missed.
This was one of the first adult westerns produced and ran for an incredible 20 years. I grew up watching this series but only when it went to color and was expanded to fifty minutes in length. So it is great that I am now getting the chance to see the early episodes with Dennis Weaver in the cast. What a fantastic show this is. Thanks to CBS for releasing this on dvd.",1320624000,9,610,4.267241379310345
4657396,5,B005D7E7PY,"I've been a major fan of the early seasons of Gunsmoke since they appeared in 1955. I have seasons 1 to 4.  Season 5 continues in the same vein. I'm only sorry they weren't made available years ago. The first season was sold
in its entirety, and one could carp that season 2 to 5 have been sold as two half seasons, and of course cost more.  But CBS knows how much old fans enjoyed the show, and suspected this might happen. This is balanced by the fact one can now get the show on DVD at all.  They are excellently packaged, and the image quality is very high.  A real joy for old Gunsmoke fans, and anyone looking for top quality, timeless entertainment.",1318982400,19,656,4.266129032258065

8466360,5,B005D7E7PY,"Great ensemble acting and guest stars. Gritty with generally psychologically dark themes and violent plots. Not for children. For example, one previous episode had a deranged religious fanatic and his two more- or- less deranged sons trying to cut off Chester's hand because he disobeyed an edict of their father. I was squirming in my chair as the one son held down a pleading Chester while the father tried to line up his ax. Many other episodes are equally disturbing but there also is a bit of humor thrown into each episode as well. Highly recommended",1502064000,2,556,4.802083333333333
