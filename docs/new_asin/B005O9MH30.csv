4851587,5,B005O9MH30,I will always cherish this DVD and will show it to my grandson when he is older and can understand the tremendous talent of Rosina Lhevinne.  She is/was remarkable as a pianist herself and as a teacher to many great pianists.  What an inspiration to all of us aspiring pianists!  She used her God-given talents as a gift to the world.,1366243200,4,334,4.442622950819672

8481029,5,B005O9MH30,"A truly wonderful portrait! I've had copy of Josef Lhevinne's book on technique and never fully understood some of what he said until I saw the excerpts of Rosina playing in this documentary and then it made perfect sense. It has changed my playing completely. I never thought a scale could be beautiful until I heard her playing.

It's wonderful to hear the stories told by all these famous former pupils of hers.",1390780800,5,414,4.671232876712328
8481030,5,B005O9MH30,"There are so many wonderful moments of insight into the Russian school which Rosina teaches with style and command.  Some of the greats like Van Cliburn can be seen working with her and realizing the magic of their own discovery that she brings to teaching.  What a wonderful gift for pianists to savor and learn from.  She was a great teacher and humanitarian, whose gift lives on in this video.",1381363200,6,396,4.628571428571429
8481031,4,B005O9MH30,"My teacher was a student of Rosina and Josef Lhevinne at Julliard in the 1930's.  She told me interesting stories about the Lhevinnes and their superb teaching methods and technique.  Clearly this video, which focuses mainly on Rosina's later life as a widow and great teacher/pianist, is a great tribute to her legacy as one of the world's foremost teachers.

I'm glad this video was made and hopefully it will help others appreciate that great teachers amplify musicianship many fold through their dedication and love for their students.",1368403200,5,539,5.1022727272727275
