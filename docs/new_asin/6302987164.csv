7833469,5,6302987164,"The 1961 World Series began just days after Yankees' slugger Roger Maris swatted his record-breaking 61st home run, besting Babe Ruth's long-standing single-season round-tripper mark.

Maris, however, was not a major force in the Yankees' dominating victory over the Cincinnati Reds in the '61 Series. Maris batted just .105 for the five games, but he did hit 1 home run. The other half of the ""M & M boys"", Mickey Mantle, provided even less run production -- No homers and no RBIs in the series (with only a .167 BA).

The Cincinnati Reds were severely overmatched by those superior Yankees in '61, despite the lack of hitting from New York's two main power plants (Mantle and Maris). The Yanks won 109 games during the '61 regular season, with a tremendous .673 winning percentage. The roster of great Yankees' stars went on and on, while the Reds (although a great club in 1961, with 93 victories) featured a line-up with names like Gene Freese, Elio Chacon, Joey Jay, Johnny Edwards, Darrell Johnson, and Don Blasingame.

Cincinnati did have a few top-name stars as well -- Frank Robinson (the 1961 MVP in the National League), Vada Pinson, Gus Bell, and Jim Maloney.

Leading hitters in the Yanks' 4-games-to-1 triumph over Cincy were Bobby Richardson (.391; 9 hits), Bill Skowron (.353/1 HR/5 RBI), Johnny Blanchard (.400/2 HR), and Hector Lopez (.333/7 RBI).

New York pitching also dominated during this World Series, with the Yanks posting an attractive 1.60 team ERA, led by lefthander Whitey Ford, who was perfect (2-0) in 2 starts, allowing no runs in 14 innings.

This '61 Series concluded with Game 5 at Cincinnati's Crosley Field on October 9th (with 32,589 fans in attendance), as the Yankees hammered the final nail into the Reds' coffin with a one-sided 13-5 stomping of Cincy.

This VHS video runs for approximately 40 minutes, and features Mel Allen as narrator. It provides pretty good detail for all five Series games. You'll see legends such as Mickey Mantle, Yogi Berra, Roger Maris, Whitey Ford, and Frank Robinson in action.

But even with Mickey Mantle playing in only two games and getting only one hit, the New York Yankees defeated the Cincinnati Reds in five games. The series was memorable for the Bronx Bombers for several reasons. Series MVP Whitey Ford, 25-4 during the regular season, won two games and continued the bad year for the Bambino as he broke Babe Ruth's 1918 record of 29 2/3 consecutive scoreless innings with 32. Ralph Houk became only the third first-year manager to win the Series, and second baseman Bobby Richardson, who set a record with 12 RBI's the previous year, set another record with nine hits in a five-game Series.
The 1961 Series started out being dominated by pitching and the long ball. Ford pitched a 2-0 2-hit shut out in Game 1 with Elston Howard and Moose Skowron hitting home runs. Joe Jay, who won 21 games for Fred Hutchinson's club, evened the series with a 6-2 victory but when the Reds returned home to Cincinnati the Yankees won all three games. In Game 3 Red's pitcher Bob Purkey gave up only six hits but lost when John Blanchard hit a pinch-hit homer in the 8th inning to tie the game and Roger Maris hit his only long ball of the Series in the 9th to give the Yankees the lead. Ford, who hurt his ankle in the 5th inning and had to leave the game, combined with Jim Coates for 7-0 victory in Game 4. Then the Yankees scored 5 runs in the top of the first of the final game on way to a 13-5 route (with both Mantle and Yogi Berra out of the lineup no less) as scrub Hector Lopez drove in 5 runs.
In winning their 19th world title the Yankees hit 7 home runs to the Reds' three. NL MVP Frank Robinson had his first taste of World Series play but only batted .200 with one home run, but things would go better for him in the future in the other league. However, let no one pretend that taking care of the Reds in five games got rid of the bad memories from losing to the Pittsburgh Pirates the year before.
