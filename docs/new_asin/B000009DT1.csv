His best friends daughter finds out about what is believed to be The Sherriff's brutal act, yet Wayne finds out the truth and brings the real killers to justice.

1197556,2,B000009DT1,"Texas Terror (Robert N. Bradbury, 1935)

John Wayne grew into a fine actor when he started working with John Ford, four years after this movie was made; unfortunately, there's none of that acting talent on display in this mediocre potboiler. Written and directed by Robert N. Bradbury, who made hundreds of these film equivalents of dime novels in the twenties and thirties, Texas Terror features Wayne as a sheriff who is conned into believing he killed his best friend during a shootout with a gang of thieves. He leaves his job and lives off the land until his friend's daughter (Lucile Browne) comes to town and, not knowing what he believes, hires him on as ranch foreman. Needless to say, everything comes out, Wayne and the sheriff who replaced him (Gabby Hayes) identify the robbers, there's a big punch-up, the hero gets the girl, etc. It's quick and easy, transparent, predictable, badly-acted, and lacks the humor and much of the action that made some of the other Lone Star westerns much more watchable than this. **",1206403200,,1028,4.840909090909091
1197557,4,B000009DT1,"Between 1933 and 1935 a young John Wayne starred in sixteen low budget westerns for Lone Star, a division of the poverty row Monogram studio.  ""Texas Terror,"" written and directed by Robert N. Bradbury in 1935, has a rather strange title given that the story emphasizes the romantic part more than is usual.  Wayne plays Sheriff John Higgins who thinks that he has killed his best friend, Dan Matthews (Frank Ball) in a shootout with an outlaw gang.  Higgins quits and becomes a prospector, which probably explains that attempt at a beard, but when he runs into Dan's sister, Beth (Lucile Browne), he does everything he can to help her run her ranch.  Of course, she eventually finds out who he is and what he has done and does not know words vile enough to describe her contempt for him.
If you suspect that it is always darkest before the dawn and that our Hero learns the truth in time to get the bad guys and the girl (in that order), then you know your B Westerns.  There are some decent chase sequences for the time and the genre, with the legendary stuntman Yakima Canutt doing all of the good stuff while doubling for Wayne and the various henchmen on horseback.  You should be able to spot George Hayes as the sheriff and another well known stock player LeRoy Mason as bad guy Joe Dickson.  ""Texas Terror"" is another above average Lone Star Western with Wayne actually given some different things to do this time around.  Not of these oaters, all of which run less than an hour, are great and their value is more nostalgic than anything else, but fans of the Duke should check them out once in their life.",1087257600,3,1614,4.5034246575342465
1197558,4,B000009DT1,"These two films, ""Texas Terror,"" and """"The Trail Beyond"" are two great B-westerns starring a young John Wayne.  I really enjoy these films.  Sure they are not the best written or acted films in the world, but they are entertaining to a very high degree.  Everyone should see how John Wayne started out in pictures and compare that to how he finished his career.  This serves as inspiration to everyone that human beings can improve themselves to an immeasurable degree.",1047772800,2,469,4.825
1197559,1,B000009DT1,"It's horrible what has been done to this movie by adding a music track to the chase scenes. The soundtrack is a recording of electronic music. The result of the soundtrack inclusion is one's experiencing an annoying sensation by the presence of inauthentic sound. I guess one can turn the volume down low so not to listen to a poorly conceived music, ruining another wise good movie.",1453161600,,383,4.731343283582089
1197560,1,B000009DT1,"Bogged down by a tired plot, ""Texas Terror"" (1935) goes through the motions with precious little spark. John Wayne has little to do but punch the clock and hope for better things.  Meanwhile, director Robert N. Bradbury keeps recycling the same Tom Steele script (the audience was probably too bored to notice). One of the Duke's worst ""B"" Westerns.",1436486400,2,349,4.915254237288136

1197562,4,B000009DT1,"If this reviewer doesn't have all of the Duke's westerns- it isn't for the lack of trying.  Also giving a heads up to personal bias: Have a large oil painting of the Duke (not a print, also have several of those), old photograph, several commemorative pocket watches, dozen collector Plates- a lot of Duke stuff from one of a 100 autobiography books to a roll of important paper with the Duke on it- so the reviewer thinks highly of the Duke.

This movie is from the '30's and a good one; having many of the same actors who Wayne carried from movie to movie.  A habit of taking care of his friends that continued into the 1960's and '70's which have his arguably best westerns.  This one has plenty of action, fist fights to gunsmoke with the Duke winning the day.  Enough said without giving away a spoiler,  Watch the movie, it's a good way to spend an hour of your time.  davzway",1402185600,,882,4.374233128834356

1197564,4,B000009DT1,"Texas Terror, 1934 film

The movie shows a small town and the Sheriff's office. One man drew out all his money to buy cattle (now that the rustlers are gone). [Is it safe to carry all that cash? Would a Letter of Credit be better?] Dan rides out of town. Three men plan a crime. A gunshot alarm the people of a robbery. Sheriff John pursues the robbers. They stop at a house; Dan is shot in the back! The wounded robber is given the cash so he can return to town. Planted cash incriminates Dan Matthews. Ed Williams is the replacement Sheriff. John becomes a prospector. He finds a wounded Indian and takes him back. [Note the beard and moustache.] Bess Mathews returns to her ranch. Five men attack the automobile and shoot the driver! John chases them an captures one! Now he is chased.

John places Bess in the automobile and drives fast. Bess tells the Sheriff what happened. John returns the express money to the Sheriff. He tells John Higgins to help Bess for Dan's sake. Aunt Martha will cook. John shows Bess the ranch. She will need hands to work the ranch. There is a dance at night. A woman gossips about John. The Martin boys pay with an old dollar, its serial number was part of the loot. John overhears a conversation between two men. Dixon tells Bess news about her father's death. She notices that ring on John! She follows John and sees him at that safe. There is a milking contest. Dixon takes Bess home. Those two men will be followed to find their leader. Bess talks to Higgins alone and accuses him of robbery and murder. ""I never want to see you again!"" John sees the Martin boys go into Dixon's house. We hear their plans. John follows Dixon out of town. He hears their plan for stealing horses.

John calls on Black Eagle for help. Dixon also gets help to move those stolen horses. There is a running battle. John rides after the Martin brothers to get a confession. He then rides into town to the Mathew's ranch. Dixon jumps out the window to get away. But John catches up to capture him. Will Bess reconcile with John?

This is an interesting story about crimes committed for greed. It is more complex than some others. You see ""John Higgins"" with a beard, perhaps the only movie to do so.",1376352000,,2215,4.421568627450981

At the same time, Dans good buddy Sheriff John (John Wayne) learns that three desperados just robbed the Wells Fargo office.  He sets out in hot pursuit, arriving too late.  Bad Joe Dickson (LeRoy Mason) has just killed geezer Dan and left incriminating evidence to suggest that it was Dan who held up the Wells Fargo office.  Without forensics, Sheriff John thinks he shot his buddy.  Distraught, he gives up his badge, grows a scruffy beard, and goes off prospecting.  Sheriff Ed (Gabby Hayes) takes over minding the town.  A year later distraught John saves geezer Dans daughter from the same gang of cutthroats when they rob the car shes riding in (with STAGE written on the door).  John ominously tells Bess (Lucille Browne) that someday youll hate me.  And she does because the little ninny cant tell good guys from bad guys.

Filled with the usual fist fights, shootouts, rustling, chase sequences, a cow milking contest, and time for dancing.  Nothing special except for the incomparable Gabby Hayes and John Wayne doing his version of sulking.  They don't make them like this anymore and nor should they.",1488067200,,1207,4.8341463414634145
