7935014,4,B00005A46C,"""I Do Believe"" provides an opportunity to enjoy a wonderfully balanced program featuring the Gaither Vocal Band in well over a dozen songs. Other guests include: The Talley Trio with Jason Crabb, The Easters, The Martins, and Russ Taft. Anthony Burger is featured in a masterful arrangement of ""Exodus"" and Jake Hess is featured with the vocal band singing ""Oh, What a Wonderful Time"" as well as a moving arrangement of the song ""If God Didn't Care.""

Among my favorites from the vocal band are: Loving God Loving Each Other, I Do Believe, More Than Ever, On The Authority, The Love of God, and Where No One Stands Alone. Each of the members of the vocal band are featured in at least one number.

The audience is highly responsive, obliviously enjoying the spirit of enthusiasm of the artists and the Christ centered music and narratives. Comedy spots are introduced throughout the concert. Although clever, I personally thought the humor was a bit of a ""stretch"" however it clearly reveals a fun loving side of each member of the quartette, as well as some excellent dead pan acting skills.

Mark Lowry presents a meaningful inspirational segment by sharing a personal testimony as well as being featured with the vocal band in the song ""Make it Real.""

Another enjoyable Gaither Vocal Band concert, great entertainment, and Christ honoring inspiration.",1310428800,,1355,4.955947136563877

A packed house, a full program, and gifted Christian artists singing with conviction combined to make ""I Do Believe"" another memorable Gaither Vocal Band concert. The tape was filmed and recorded in 2001 in New Orleans.

The Vocal Band is made up of Bill Gaither, Mark Lowry, Guy Penrod, and David Phelps. Jeff and Sheri Easter, Charlotte Ritchey, Russ Taft, Jake Hess, Jason Crabb, The Talley Trio, and the Martins add another dimension to the Vocal Band's inspiring performance. Anthony Burger accompanies the singers and is featured in an amazing keyboard arrangement of ""Exodus.""

My favorite numbers include: Hide Thou Me, Loving God - Loving Each Other, I Do Believe, More Than Ever, On the Authority, The Love of God, Oh What a Time, Where No One Stands Alone, A Sinner Saved By Grace, and Make It Real.

Christian entertainment at its best. Inspirational testimonies, a touch of comedy, and fabulous music.",1307836800,,969,4.962962962962963
7935016,5,B00005A46C,"The entire almost 2 hr. video is just splendid, with the guys & their special guests on stage singing, the comedy by the guys, but by far the best is Anthony Burger playing a solo with the 1st rate orchestra of the song the Exodus, I was so moved by it, gives me goosebumps just thinking about it.  What an extremely God given talented pianist he was.  God must have needed him for something very special in Heaven, we shall miss him always.

You will not go wrong with this wonderful video/DVD of I Do Believe.  After watching this awesome program I Do Believe!!!",1155513600,,564,4.394230769230769

Get ready to have your hair stand on end, or your goose pimples get goose pimples!  What a thoroughly enjoyable DVD!  There are three or four selections on this program that will almost bring you to tears, and the title song, ""I Do Believe,"" is peerless.  An incredible mix of humor and beautiful music.",1144195200,3,419,4.402597402597403
