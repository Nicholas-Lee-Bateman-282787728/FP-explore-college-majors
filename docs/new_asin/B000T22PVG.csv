2893057,5,B000T22PVG,"Sixteen episodes is more like two-thirds the normal season, not half. Anyway, with 2 mil per episode, Ray didn't loose out and besides, Peter Boyle was in poor health, and true to his craft, the show went on. And aren't we all delighted with this nice final season. I do agree this shortened season should be offered at a lower cost; but Amazon is selling the new release under 30 bucks, so why complain?",1189209600,5,404,4.472972972972973
2893058,5,B000T22PVG,"The ELR cast, most-definately, succeeded at making the 9th - and final - their funniest!  Every episode had its ""rewind and watch that again"" moments.  Maybe its because the shortened 16-episode season left little room for a sitcom's typical ""boring/filler"" episode, but I don't care!  I could rewatch this season over and over again.

For a set of writers who wanted to end the show after season 8 because they were ""running out of ideas"", they did a fantastic job creatively in year 9!  And they surely shined by making the series finale just another ""typical"" episode, while making it very obvious that they never forgot why the show was titled what it was!",1187740800,,660,4.754385964912281

2893060,3,B000T22PVG,"The one thing that really annoys me about TV series on DVD, is the practice of spreading fewer episodes across multiple discs in order to raise the list price and ""fool"" consumers into thinking they are getting more for their dollar. Here's yet another example of a season series that could have easily been fit onto 3 discs instead of 4, and with a bit of creative planning could've even been squeezed onto 2 without comprising content or quality.

As more and more consumers collect their favorite television shows on disc, shelf space becomes an ever growing concern. This same issue is shared with retailers as well. Producing lavish sets that took up an entire row of shelf space may have been impressive 3 or 4 years ago, but today it just doesn't make sense.

And now, as studios try to push the Blu-ray and HD-DVD formats as the new and exciting media that provides 5 times the capacity of DVD; I say, ""who cares""? We rarely use the DVD format to its fullest extent.

That being said, I love this show, and look forward to its final release on DVD. I just wish the manufacturer would have presented it on a few less discs and saved us all one or two inches in our ever-growing collections. A reduced price for fewer episodes would have been a bonus as well. But then again, the video distributors have learned to count on consumer ignorance to boost their profit margins.",1185667200,12,1379,4.55241935483871
2893061,5,B000T22PVG,"Just as it was difficult for fans to believe when ""Everybody Loves Raymond"" concluded its unforgettable run in 2005, it is also hard to believe that with this upcoming boxed set, all nine seasons will be available on DVD. For those who have loyally purchased these DVD's will be pleased to know that they can officially top off their collections in September 2007--a great way to begin the new school year, for sure!

Although the cast and crew of ""Raymond"" could not cement down a full-season deal for this 9th year, they compromised with a satisfying helping of 16 episodes that were spread out from September to May. Oh, if only ""Gilmore Girls"" had made a similar deal after its 7th season--but for the sake of those who don't know or care about that show, I will stay on topic.

What continually amazes me about this series is that despite being on the air for nearly a decade, the fact that it never lost its momentum really places it in the minority. Sure, most people would agree that the episodes from the middle seasons--such as 4, 5, and 6--were probably the very best, but that's common for almost every television series out there. This 9th season is so special, though, because it launched the year with an out-of-left-field episode that was shocking and hilarious, and it managed to bow out in the finale with plot material that mixed the trademark humor with some well-deserved poignancy. I am so impressed at how they kept the ball rolling with some fresh and genuinely funny episodes that kept fans laughing all the way through. (And think about it--how many shows that last almost ten years get to say that?)

Once again, this DVD set will only contain about half the number of episodes that we enjoyed in the first 8 seasons. Still, it will certainly feel like the same old classic ""Raymond"" as soon as you start watching the series opener, ""The Home,"" where Frank and Marie render their family speechless by selling their home to Robert and Amy, packing their bags, and moving several miles away to their own little fairytale retirement home. Leaving their loved ones proves to be difficult, but it's pretty tough to pass up a place that has heated toilet seats, a 24-hour dining hall, and a group of women who immediately select Marie for the title role in their upcoming production of ""The Unsinkable Molly Brown"" (a very apt casting choice, to say the least). But if you've ever heard the saying ""If it sounds too good to be true, then it usually is,"" stay tuned for a hysterical twist of events just one episode later. From that point on, after the shock wears off, the show returns on track to provide the usual laughter and family friction that we all know and love. The latest snit between Debra and Marie causes Ray to manipulate the situation when he realizes how his wife's anger spices up their bedroom routine, but later on, he decides to show Debra just how lousy it feels to be ""turned down"" (which works like a charm until she uncovers the scam). 13-year-old Ally--who is not such a little girl anymore--shocks her parents when her F in math is accompanied by a very snotty attitude. 9-year-olds Michael and Geoffrey find a new friend in the son of a custodian, but of COURSE, their crazy dad can't seem to prevent himself from making a buffoon of himself in front of the child and his father. Marie considers turning in her apron when Frank adds some ""artificial flavoring"" to his meal for the first time, and Robert continues to struggle in earning the respect of Amy's family, which is not the easiest of tasks when--after catching one of his in-laws in a scandalous act--he is essentially left holding the bag. Through it all, everything culminates in a highly anticipated series finale, where Ray's trip to the hospital for some minor surgery flares into a nightmare when everyone is forced to consider what might happen if they lost their beloved Raymond.

All in all, this is a considerably funny and enjoyable season for any die-hard fan of the series, and it is definitely something you'll want to pick up when it arrives in September. All of the special features haven't really been finalized yet, but it's been reported that there will definitely be the same bloopers, as well as commentary tracks for at least half of the episodes (hopefully, everyone will come in to participate for the finale episode). Some behind-the-scenes featurettes and a tribute to the late Peter Boyle are among the most requested bonuses for this last set, but we will see what they come up with. Either way, there are few people who can deny the show's knack for writing pitch-perfect scripts and bringing together a cast that delivers nearly flawlessly every single time. Though it is sad to see it go, ""the sitcom of our times"" will always be around in DVD's--and if you're looking for high-quality and consistent comedy, you can't find anything much better than this!",1184544000,26,4895,4.714953271028038
2893062,5,B000T22PVG,"Everybody Loves Raymond: Complete Ninth Season marks the end of this excellent television series.  Fortunately, we are able to enjoy the series over and over again on DVD.  This season somehow kept things as fun and fresh as the first 8 seasons.  How the series was able to maintain its excellence for such a long period of time is a testament to the great cast.  The interplay between the actors is excellent and it is difficult to remember that these people are really not related.  It is also rather sad to watch the final episodes as Peter Boyle's health was waning.  In spite of this, he was still great in the show.  This season features the following episodes.  Ironic that the last two shows were as strong as any in the series.  My only complaint is that there are only 16 episodes rather than the typical 22-23.  But that is just a desire for more ELR.

Episode 1: The Home: Frank and Marie decide to move.
Episode 2: Not So Fast: Amy puts her personal touch on their new house.
Episode 3: Angry Sex: A fight between Marie and Debra leads to Ray and Debra's night of passion.
Episode 4: P.T. & A.: Trouble at a PTA meeting.
Episode 5: Ally's F: Ray figures out why Ally got an F.
Episode 6: Boys' Therapy: The guys go to therapy, or do they?
Episode 7: Debra's Parents: Debra's divorced parents come for dinner.
Episode 8: A Job for Robert: Marie wants grandkids from Amy and Robert.
Episode 9: A Date for Peter: Trying to hook up Amy's Freaky brother Peter.
Episode 10: Favors: Marie blackmails Debra.
Episode 11: The Faux Pas: An inadvertent insult.
Episode 12: Tasteless Frank: Frank salts Marie's lasagna.
Episode 13: Sister-In-Law: Ray calls Amy a chatterbox and she finds out.
Episode 14: The Power of No: Ray chooses the NBA over Debra.
Episode 15: Pat's Secret: Ray catches Pat secretly smoking.
Episode 16: The Finale: Ray undergoes a routine surgery.

A stellar 5 star season to wrap up a 5 star series.",1183852800,51,1923,4.542028985507247

2893321,3,B000T22PVG,"I am an Everybody-Loves-Raymond-ophile.  I LOVE, love, love the show.  I love Ray's humor (much the same as my own--Italian, sarcastic and all New York), his family, his friends, the plots, scripts and gags.  However, something happened in Season 9.  If I had read the signs from Episode 1, I would have noted Ray Romano's luscious California tan, Patricia Heaton's alarmingly red locks, Doris' new, relaxed spa-fit aura upon their return from a wonderful Season 8.  What I'm saying is--they relaxed as people, and I think the writer (which included Ray) ""relaxed"" a little too much, too. They forgot the series' core premise, which was the internal struggles set in the larger frame of family squabbles.  Most of the scenes in this season became stages for their conflicts, all played out loud and openly--no more bedroom discussions, where the conflicts played out in the marriage (with the notable exception of the one episode, which I won't mention for fear of spoilers), no more visits to the priest or the principle to try to figure out the chaos, no more self-conscious angst (as in: keeping a journal for black and blue marks ;) ). It's as though they just took everything we knew about the show and threw it into one-act scenes played out in big, circus like acts, with Robert howling his discontent aloud in one corner, Debra unattractively being openly rude and snide (alas, she worked to hide it so well before this), the kids being grown up and snotty and really not adding anything at all. Frank and Marie remain the only constants, but they, too, are dragged into the three-ring act, unfortunately.  That special subtlety that was so cleverly written into the 22 minute format is gone.  It's just a knock-down, drag-out most of the time.  However, all that said, don't avoid this season, because it's the last chance you'll have to spend with the hysterical, loveable Barones. All I can say is, I can't wait to go back to Season 1, and enjoy the true heart of this heartwarming series again.",1394755200,2,2006,4.791304347826087

I think from the last season mine are ""A Date for Peter"" (because Stefania shows up, and Robert gets drunk after referring to her as ""my Stephania"", then tells his wife ""you're my Stephania now""), and ""P.T. And A"" when Debra dresses provacatively after Ray lies to her about what other members of the PTA said about the way she dresses.

All of these episodes in every season address things that happen in families universally.  This is one of the best shows ever to be shown on television.  What's interesting to me is that I rarely watched these when they were initially aired.  I didn't begin watching them until they were reruns.  Now, I am a great advocate.

I wouldn't really recommend it for small children due to some of the adult content. I think parents should watch first, and then decide if you want your small children watching this or not.

My therapist says I should try to enjoy simple things like comedy and maybe I wouldn't be compelled to burn things. Anyway, I haven't really given the show a chance but I think good family fun can suck it. I'm sorry, there's that negativity again, at least I can recognize it so that must mean I'm making progress, even if this show does suck the corpse turd from a drowning victim.

Knew something was amiss when I heard rattling in the shipping box... all the discs in the Raymond package were loose and sliding up and down.. not mention the inside of the case, the plastic liner, which holds each disc, was broken.  Did someone jump on this?  The box was bulging in the middle before I even opened it.  Not sure who the genius was who jammed this item, along with 2 other Raymond DVD sets into the TINY amazon box, but thanks.. really appreciate paying extra for the better DVD set, and receiving it damaged..And since I HAD TO OPEN IT, take off the shrink wrap to see the inside, it cannot be returned.  I would have to say, 95% of the items I receive directly from Amazon, shipped from Amazon, are usually damaged, and the packing material ALWAYS stinks.  Ohhhhh Amazon, where for art thou shipping quality like the ole' days? Remember when it really mattered?

As I have gotten older there are few network television presentations that have caught my attention for any longer than a glance, and certainly fewer that became a weekly part of the living room.  The final scene of the final episode of the final season summed it all up for what made this a magic and fun time, and a comfort of sorts....a family gathered at the dinner table, passing the food, light conversation and then fade to black.  Life would go on just fine at the Ramone homes.  I am so glad that the entire season of ELR is available on DVD, and I found I saved a little money by ordering the whole set.

2893536,5,B000T22PVG,"This is without a doubt one of the funniest shows on TV. Each character is so distinct and will probably remind you of somebody in your own family. Unlike most sitcoms, which seem to take really unrealistic characters and throw them into unrealistic situations, Raymond works taking a normal situation and exaggerating it to show the humor. I pull these DVDs out whenever I need a laugh. They're well worth the cost.",1257206400,,416,4.791666666666667

To give you an impression of how much I'm obssessed with ""Every body loves Raymond"", I got the full 9 seasons from a friend who recorded it on DVD from the T.V. After 2 years of watching it, almost everyday during lunch, I recently bought the full package f 9 seasons from Best Buy!! Now I'll be able to see it more clearly :D

Seasons 1 is so beginner for me after seeing the rest of the seasons, so starting with season 2 will be ok too.",1222819200,3,684,4.135338345864661
2893538,4,B000T22PVG,"As a whole, season #9 was probably the weakest of all the Raymond seasons but I found fantastic that, for once,  we got see one of the all time TV greats leaving with a knock-out-punch-finale, with every character true to their nature in a hilarious way. The first two episodes in season 9 are also rather good but in pretty much the rest of them I felt like the show's writers were trying to extract laughs from the audience as if it was liposuction or something. Perhaps the saddest thing was seeing how fragile Peter Boyle looked at the end but it was great for him to stay until the last episode, I can't imagine how sad it would have been for ELR to have to deal with Frank's passing.
For me it's very simple: 70's: Taxi, 80's Cheers, 90's Raymond. 00's: no idea yet.",1217980800,,772,4.324137931034483

2893542,5,B000T22PVG,I didn't watch Raymond when it was on TV. I do own all nine seasons on DVD. The nineth season is just as funny as all the rest. When you hear someone talk about how funny something is you wonder. I can honestly say Everybody Loves Raymond made me laugh out loud not just smile. It's like Frasier you laugh till it hurts. I do think that short seasons should be put on less discs. I am curious how they are going to market the strike shortened seasons.,1200614400,,451,4.136363636363637
2893543,5,B000T22PVG,"The only thing wrong with the last season of Everybody Loves Raymond is that it is the last season. The season ended with a series of best episode repeats and then one finale episode, so the last season is only 16 episodes.  The producers and writers were afraid that if they continued, the material would stop being fresh, so they ended the series while still ahead.

The season beings with Frank and Marie moving to a retirement community some distance away which at first sounds like the story pattern would change, but an extremely funny twist just made the last season better as Robert and Amy find themselves living under the same roof with Frank and Marie.

The nine year run was enjoyable and unfortunately, a bit too realistic for anyone who is part of a family.  I bought the entire series for my wife and we will enjoy it often. Too bad there isn't a season 10.",1200096000,,872,4.5

2893552,5,B000T22PVG,"I have all the seasons and theres nothing like sitting down on your favorite spot on the couch, grab a snack and turn on any episode from season 1 through 9. EXCELLENT ,FABULOUS, HISTERICAL, TALENTED CAST...I can go on and on...but I think you get the picture..Anyone who is familiar with this TV show has to appreciate the chemistry these acotrs have with one another. And being italian myself, there is so much to relate to.. I actually come from Lynbrook...(the town they live in ) so i get a kick out of hearing them mention my long island town. I highly recommend this DVD.",1193961600,,578,4.514285714285714

I have all the seasons and the last season was an incomplete set.  We were very disappointed that the last season's tape/disc was so short.,1193529600,,275,4.6875

2893567,5,B000T22PVG,"Despite its nine-year run, I believe this show never lost an ounce of its humor and impact! Unlike other sitcoms, the ""Raymond"" family continued to grow and explore new material -- all the while keeping audiences happy with the familiarity they had grown to love over the past eight seasons.

In Season 9, Ally really begins to become a teenager, as she has trouble concentrating in math class because of a boy she likes in ""Ally's F."" Another classic episode, ""The Home,"" has Frank and Marie moving to a retirement community in New Jersey, causing their sons and their spouses to break into a spontaneous dance of joy -- until they learn Frank and Marie have so offended everyone in the community that they've been kicked out!

And, as always, sex is always in the immediate background. In ""P.T.& A,"" Debra gets some slack over her sexy outfits; and in ""Angry Sex,"" Ray accidentally discovers a wonderful bonus connected with Debra's anger at his mother.

The show concludes on a more serious note, as Ray undergoes a minor surgery, causing the family to review their true cohesiveness -- not always apparent under the jibes and caustic remarks.

My only complaint is that it only ran 16 episodes, compared to the usual twenty or so in previous seasons. But, all in all, the season is a winner.",1192665600,,1295,4.716814159292035
2893568,5,B000T22PVG,This show can be watched by the whole family. I also have the other 8 seasons.  This is great to turn to when faced by the usual garbage that is on the TV nowadays.,1192579200,,164,3.823529411764706
2893569,4,B000T22PVG,"What  can I say, It's Raymond and his best. Having lived overseas when the show 1st aired I missed most of these shows. How great it is to own the entire set as of this shipment. Raymond ruled and the service which got me the dvd boxed set was second to none, including price. It is ashame I couldn't get the same service on a drill I tried to order. There are just some items Amazon won't ship to apo addresses.",1192579200,,412,4.08641975308642
2893570,5,B000T22PVG,"Another season of laughs with the Barones.  In today's world, we all need to laugh more.  I recommend all 9 seasons of Everybody Loves Raymond.",1192579200,,143,4.68
2893571,5,B000T22PVG,This season was great as usual but since it contained less episodes than usual a lowered price would have been awesome.,1191369600,,119,4.714285714285714
2893572,4,B000T22PVG,"The shows are great as usual.  I thought the blooper real was not so great, except Ray cracking Peter Boyle up with the Young Frankenstein joke.  I loved it, but there should have been a tribute to Peter Boyle.  He was a wonderful actor, and often the funniest person on the show.  He deserved to have a tribute.  It was very dissappointing",1190332800,3,340,4.419354838709677

8207509,4,B000T22PVG,"I don't watch an awful lot of TV, but this is one funny show I enjoy.  This was my last season DVD to buy to complete my series-set.  Only one problem with this last season: for some unaccountable reason this last DVD is made different than the rest of the series, and I don't like the packaging at all.  The other seasons were contained in nice little plastic boxes that were space-saving at about 1/2-inch wide each on a shelf.  You can open the box, see on the left the episode synopsis of all the encased DVDs, and each box neatly fit 5 DVDs for that season.  Nice.  This one, for some reason doesn't match the style of the other seasons.  It opens clumsily in 2-different sections, the synopses are all cramped under each DVD for some reason, so you have to spread open wide the entire volume 4-""pages"" long to read it all, and it closes to this really thick book that is over 1-inch wide, taking up precious storage space for me.  Why this last season was wrapped different is a mystery as it is very disappointing and awkward to use, the reason for my less-than-perfect rating.  If you have little space to store DVDs you may want to shop around and see if there is a more compact version somewhere.",1514592000,,1206,4.37219730941704
