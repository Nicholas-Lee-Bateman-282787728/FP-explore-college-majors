8094254,5,B000BY2OU4,"Back in the 70's Wim Wenders films were bleak existential road movies in which the characters seemed to be searching for something without knowing what or why. They are also the films on which his reputation will stand (with the exceptions of Wings Of Desire,and Paris,Texas) and depend more on a dark German realism than the multicultural hipsterism  creeping into his work ever so slightly in the 80's and 90's.  The Goalies Anxiety at the Penalty Kick is one of the darkest and most penetrating of Wenders earlier films. and proves without a doubt that he deserved to be mentioned in the same breath as the titans of German cinema Herzog and Fassbinder at one time. Now i'm not so sure.",1424044800,,689,4.68595041322314
8094255,5,B000BY2OU4,"Powerful and absorbing drama about the personal anguish and internal dragons of simple man after he has murdered. His conflicts and dramatis personae are narrated in a fabulous minimalist language.

Watching this film you will notice why Wenders is so close to Antonioni in what existential problems concern. That is why they have worked so close.",1139875200,4,347,5.196428571428571
