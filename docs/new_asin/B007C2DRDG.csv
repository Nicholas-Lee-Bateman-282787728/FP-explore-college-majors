8514149,4,B007C2DRDG,"I love Leonard Cohen and so admire the amazing life he's led.  The only problem I have with the documentary is that it took too big a topic to do justice in the time allotted.  As a Cohen fan I drank in the whole thing and enjoyed it, but I was left feeling that so much had not been included.  For someone just starting to get to know his poetry and music though, I would certainly recommend it.",1408406400,2,396,4.051282051282051
8514150,5,B007C2DRDG,"~ This 64-minute documentary has been released under two titles: ""After the Gold Rush"" and ""Under Review: 1977-2006"".  The ""Under Review"" title is appropriately descriptive of the content.  The documentary covers the music released by Cohen in the 1977-2006 period through a commentary by the narrator mixed with interviews with various well-known music critics.  The comments offered by all parties are honest in their assessment of Cohen's work during this period.
~ The narration puts all of this in proper perspective relative to Leonard's changing life during the 1977-2006 period.
~ Highly recommended for anyone wanting to gain some insight into the man and his music during period covered by this documentary.",1384041600,3,717,5.383928571428571

8514152,1,B007C2DRDG,"I feel like the buyers need to know that

Leonard Cohen's After the Gold Rush
Leonard Cohen's Lonesome Heroes
Leonard Cohen's Under Review 1978-2006

are all the same, just a different picture and title on the front. It is not fair to the customers to market 3 different products that are exactly the same, just different labels.

I have all three and didn't realize it until I watched the latest, Under Review, it seemed very familiar. I then watched all the Leonard Cohen DVDs I've ordered from Amazon. Sure enough, 3 DVDs that are the same.",1361232000,36,543,4.635416666666667
