8597935,5,B001DF4IX6,"'Nine Magical Months' is a great educational video for moms-to-be.  This DVD follows four expecting mothers through the different trimesters of their pregnancy, including a final part in the delivery room to witness a real birth.  It contains helpful information such as do's and don'ts relating to exercise and eating as well as a checklist of what to pack for that big trip to the hospital when the time comes to deliver.  The DVD does a nice job of presenting options for women who might choose non-traditional pregnancies as well.  This would be a great  idea for a baby shower gift and is a must-have for any expecting mom's library.",1217980800,2,638,4.763636363636364
