3952279,4,B002MJV77M,"During a 2005 high school class trip to Aruba, a carefree night out with friends turns tragic when teenager Natalee Holloway fails to show up for her return flight home to Alabama.

When Natalee disappears without a trace, her celebratory island vacation becomes a harrowing nightmare for her family. And with no clue as to her whereabouts, her mother, Beth Twitty (Tracy Pollan), is launched into a frustrating search that spans more than 4 years. Along with her husband George (Grant Show) and her best friend Carol (Catherine Dent), Beth struggles to uncover the truth.

As a trio of suspects are arrested and then released because of a lack of evidence, Beth's quest for justice provides the backdrop for a cautionary tale about the dangers of international travel. Based on the book by Beth Holloway-Twitty.",1390780800,2,812,5.007407407407407
3952280,5,B002MJV77M,This is a great story and a great portrayal. It gives very good details and I thoroughly enjoyed it. A++++,1359244800,,106,4.35
3952281,3,B002MJV77M,"this part one to the story is a necessary part as it gives you the nuts and bolts story of the jist of the natalee holloway unsolved murder case. the better movie is part two with the same cast, which follows the mother's complete obsession with the case years later and her pursuit of the likely killer.

if you followed the case in the media, this tv movie is a literal re-encactment of the story as reported in the media.  that doesn't mean it is unvarnished truth but it is the truth as we know it from all of the news stories.

this is not brilliant movie making but it is a competent, workmanlike job. it is an evening's entertainment. part two is better and this is worth seeing to lead into part two.

one neglected aspect which should have been incorporated into this film better is parents' lack of understanding about law. there seemingly is a belief that when you let your child leave america on a trip, this his rights and privileges under American law will follow him. they do not. your child is subject to that other country's legal system. if you know nothing about that legal system, you are taking a chance that you do not even apprehend. i frankly cannot understand why it has become fashionable to send high school kids to foreign countries on celebration type trips which will have lots of partying. whether the parent likes it or not, that means probably alcohol, drugs, and other risks. it is one thing if they are going to a foreign country for an educational experience but this trip had nothing to do with that.

3952282,5,B002MJV77M,"I think I have followed the Natalee Holloway story since it began, and this is a great film with great acting.

The story is about Beth Holloway a school teacher in Alabama, whose daughter Natalee a medical student takes off to visit Aruba on Spring break and ends up missing, and she is supposed to have been seen with some suspects like Joran Van Der Sloot and Deepak at Carlos and Charlies as well as the casino the night before.

Closes with scenes which were shot undercover by Peter De Vries an investigative journalist who tried to find out what really happened to the girl. This is both funny and sad as he gets a reaction out of the suspect by talking about his plans for partying, using weed for example. It is easy to watch and I would watch it again the acting is top notch and directing perfect.

3952283,4,B002MJV77M,"I got this movie at the flea market for 4.95. This movie was sad and tragic for so many reasons. A daughter who wants to party with her friends in Arbua. A mother not really having the money for her to go. And her dad who was against her going in the first place. You got to be careful who you go out with, party with. Joran looked cool cut but underneathe he was a snake. I gave it four stars because they still investagating and the movie still left out so much. I want to hear more from the father of Natalee Halloway in this film. Her friends as well. What was going through their minds. And whats even more sad another girl lost her life to this snake of a guy. Only God knows where Natalee is and hopefully He'll reaveal it to Natalee parents someday. Be careful who you go out with everyone is not safe to be with as you think they are.",1295568000,4,843,4.053892215568863
3952284,5,B002MJV77M,"This movie is an extremely well done film portraying the events as we know them of what happenned to Natalee Holloway when she disappeared on the island of Aruba during a graduation trip from high school.  The story focuses on her Mother's struggle to find out what happenned to her daughter.  Which is a venture fraught with difficulty as the island authorities are in league with the perpetrator's father and every door is closed to the Mother.  In many instances, literally so.  We are led through the different scenarios and the lies that Joran Van Der Sloot told throughout Natalee's Mother's investigation.  And finally the film closes with the clandestine videos that were taken of Joran relating the tragic night's events by the Dutch crime reporter Peter de Vries.  The actress portraying Beth Holloway does a phenomenal job of her role.  Anyone watching this movie is going to feel some of her pain.  And in closing, all I want to say is that I hope the producers of this movie will do a film about the girl in Peru who unfortunately also met her end at the hands of Joran Van Der Scum.",1290556800,9,1096,4.642487046632124
3952285,5,B002MJV77M,"This is a heart breaking movie about parents whose life are more important then their 18 year kids.  Who else would send their child out of the good old US just for a high school present!!!

3952287,4,B002MJV77M,"Having read the book and followed the case, I can attest that there is quite a bit of accuracy in this very recent film about the tragic case of Natalee Holloway.  Sure, most of the acting is not so great, but Tracy Pollan is fantastic as Natalee's anguished and unstoppable mother, Beth, who will not give up in her quest to find out what happened to her daughter.  The film even includes a reenactment of a recent, possible confession by the main suspect in the case.  It works as a bookend.

Worth consideration.",1258070400,2,515,4.505376344086022
3952288,1,B002MJV77M,"The subtitle implies that this movie will show you the ""true story"" of the families' search for justice.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  This movie (which originally aired on the Lifetime Movie Channel) is a complete work of fiction.  Once you get past that little detail, you are left with a poorly acted, low-budget mess.  Save your money - skip this one.",1255651200,4,368,4.703125

3952290,1,B002MJV77M,"This is not worth 7.00 to purchase. I cannot justify that kind of investment. It's okay and belongs on cable, but to pay matinee prices for it is just over doing it. Most of the audience here relates to the obvious and it just did not strike the chord that most true story (or well written true story cases have been written in the past). LMN needs to clean up its act and hire experienced producers and casting directors and writers who will take the time to not over play the ""good girl"" bad guy"" aspect . It's a cheap take on the entire truth of any case. No one is all good nor all bad. There was just too much of that in this film. There wee no heroes here, the investigators were pressed to blame anyone and nearly arrested two innocent workers (again, for the obvious reasons). The mother was questionable throughout the entire case and the press wasn't in love with her because she was media hungry. In fact, she was SUSPECT for a while until witnesses finally admitted how much this girl actually drank in the bar the night that SHE went off with these guys that she didn't know. Her friends were more ""innocent"" than Natalee was. Please! it was not THAT great of a movie and you can wait for this to air again on LMN. Save your cash.",1431734400,,1243,4.293617021276596

8373911,4,B002MJV77M,"Not a bad made for TV movie based on a true event.  I'd never heard of the Natalee Holloway disappearance so for me this was a good mystery of what happened to an blonde American girl who went to Aruba with school friends to party with their younger than America drinking age laws, and never boarded her flight home?  The movie is good in that it provided a number of scenarios as to why she didn't board that flight (or has been heard from again).  The story mostly follows the mother who as soon as she learns Natalee didn't board her flight, races in her car to a private jet (even dialing 911 while refusing to pull over to unsuccessfully have them tell off the pesky police officer trying to pull her over to back off).  The mother in the movie certainly comes across as very annoying and with an expectation that Aruba and the world should stop and every resource drained from everything else and poured into finding Natalee.  The movie version of her is very unlikable (I have no idea about the real life person). Which you can imagine is no doubt why she starts to get backlash from the Aruban community in the latter half of the movie, especially after she keeps complaining things would be different in America (I'm not sure they would be, how many Americans go missing in America?).  But even with an unlikable main character it's still a very good don't want to get up and leave the room while it's happening in case I miss something movie.

Unfortunately it is one of those movies that has a spoiler scene at the start.  Thankfully I'd forgotten about it until we get to the end, so it didn't detract from the mystery element of the film, that mystery element is what made the film work.  The acting by everyone in this was quite good, although Natalee's mother (Tracey Pollan) talks in a very strong accent, when  Amy Gumenick playing Natalee doesn't.  Being that the mother seems to have been an extreme helicopter parent up until the Aruba vacation, it seems unlikely her daughter wouldn't pick up the same strong accent.

But as far as TV movies go, this was one of the better ones.  There is also a sequel Justice for Natalee Holloway.",1506556800,,2153,4.5038560411311055
