3910216,5,B002DH20YM,"You know how you feel drawn to programs that make you feel like you're spending time with good friends?  The Adventures of Robin Hood DVD series with Richard Greene are just that. These are the shows you want to watch every day as opposed to the ones you only watch once in a while. There's just something about the English countryside setting, medieval time period, superb acting, and well written stories which beckon my 14 year old son and I to spend our afternoon with Robin Hood and his band of merry men, Maid Marian, and yes, even the Sheriff of Nottingham. This is entertainment the way it should still be; wholesome, glorifying: chivalry, respect, and morals--unlike the amoral trash they pass as entertainment these days. I'm very happy to have found this series and that it is made available to us. We have all four seasons. I wish there were more!!",1260921600,12,860,4.657894736842105
3910217,5,B002DH20YM,"I found the dvd for the first season in a discount store five-dollar bin.  Came home, watched one episode, and suddenly remembered all the best feelings I experienced as a kid, fifty something years ago.  I'm pretty sure this show had a lot to do with pushing me toward the Church, but I'm funny like that.  Sure enough, AMAZON carries all four seasons.  I've ordering sets for all my Godchildren and Grandchildren.
""They handled all the trouble on the English country scene [seriously? ""scene""?] and still found plenty of time to sing!""  They didn't just sing in their extra time, mark you---they FOUND the time!
""Yo, Robin!  We gonna have time to sing before we hold up the Sheriff?""
""Oh, we'll FIND the time to sing, Little John!""
I loved those guys---I still do.  No better bang for the buck, anywhere.",1259798400,11,806,4.673758865248227
3910218,5,B002DH20YM,"I would like to state that this series was just as I remembered it.  This was a time when television entertainment was wholesome, family oriented and most of all showed the values of life.  Something entertainment of today lacks",1259280000,9,228,4.82051282051282
3910219,5,B002DH20YM,Well written stories of life in the greenwood with Robin Hood and his merry men.  Sinister plots by the sheriff are always foiled by the better mind (Robin's).  Some stories are more light-hearted and center on life in the Middle Ages.,1259020800,5,235,4.7073170731707314
3910220,5,B002DH20YM,"I bought the 4 individual seasons of this series at a higher price, and felt it was worth over $40 for all of them. This is a great old-fashioned series which has aged very well. The stories are all nice little adventures that still play out quite well in the modern era. There is minimal violence and the actors are all very good in their roles. After watching all of the episodes, I'm impressed by the variety of stories that were told. Obviously, the endings are pretty happy, but that doesn't have to be seen as a bad thing.

Note that the series is in black and white, and there is some sound volume and quality fluctuation, but nothing that makes it hard to understand or unwatchable. If you like charming old adventure movies, I'd strongly recommend buying this collection.",1254700800,88,780,4.571428571428571

3910222,5,B002DH20YM,"I am thoroughly enjoying this series. Additionally, I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys the Robin Hood story. I had found the first season episodes at a retail outlet. I looked at the outlet occasionally to see if any other seasons were available without success. My youngest son joined me in watching the episodes. He enjoyed the episodes so much he researched the serires on line and found the whole series. My son enjoyed the first season enough to request the series as part of his birthday present. The series was very reasonably priced.",1254268800,6,548,4.778947368421052
3910223,5,B002DH20YM,"These are 1/2 hour episodes of the Robin Hood series filmed in England and shown in the US in the late 50s.  They are B&W, and the writing and acting is very good. Did not see this when it aired in the '50s, but really enjoy them now.  Very entertaining, and well worth the price.",1253404800,6,280,4.072727272727272
3910224,4,B002DH20YM,"One of the best shows of the 50's is alive and well.  No one has done Robin Hood any better than Richard Greene and none ever will.
Some episodes have some sound problems but that's probably to be expected with such old footage.  I am just glad to have this stunning series available.",1253232000,10,284,4.339622641509434

Yes, Errol Flynn made a great five-star movie, but Richard Greene will always be the ""Real"" Robin Hood to all of us who remember: Robin Hood, Robin Hood, riding through the glen.

Certainly Richard Greene is one of the best Robins ever, and Alexander Gaugeis probably is the best Friar Tuck. Add Archie Duncan as Little John, Bernadette O'Farrell as Maid Marion, and Alan Wheatley as the Sheriff, are arguably some of the best to ever play those characters.

3910236,5,B002DH20YM,"Even though a series of this quality certainly deserves careful mastering (especially the important first episode which is so dark that one has to imagine what might be happening - thankfully, the picture quality improves quickly in subsequent episodes), it's amazing how well it holds up - the writing, the acting, the social and historical subject matter, the stunts (especially the swordfighting and the archery).",1487721600,,416,5.415384615384616

3910244,5,B002DH20YM,"Okay, I bought this to recapture memories from my youth. Fond memories were vulnerable to a dated series. Well, fond memories remain as this series from the fifties is still fun and very watchable. Richard Greene as Robin Hood is awesome in his lighthearted portrayal. The rest of the regulars are great. It is fun to read the credits though. Edward Mulhare of the Ghost and Mrs. Muir acts in many episodes as several different characters as doe Paul Eddington of Yes Minister fame. Sixty years after this series was made, it remains fun to watch. Ah, memories.",1478304000,,561,4.73469387755102

3910248,2,B002DH20YM,"The quality of the recording is poor.  I was expecting what I have seen on Hulu and Amazon Prime, and this is not good quality at all.  The picture is blurry and you can tell it was not reproduced well.",1468972800,,202,4.025
3910249,4,B002DH20YM,"This black-and-white series was made in Britain, and not available in the US until it came to DVD. It's a sophisticated show, even by today's standards, with a great deal of attention to detail in sets, costumes, and customs of the 12th Century. I think this classic can hold its own in terms of plot development and dialogue when compared to many contemporary series as well, something that a lot of old TV shows can't really do. The hero, while skilled in the use of bow and sword, uses his brain more than he uses weapons, and earns loyalty through generosity and a dedication to justice. Lady Marion, too, is not your standard stand-around-and-scream female character, but an intelligent, capable woman who saves Robin as often as he saves her.

I only wish someone would give this series a proper restoration to recover the original contrast and clean up the sometimes-muddy soundtrack.",1466380800,,891,4.8618421052631575
3910250,5,B002DH20YM,"As I think 13 year old this taught some human values, on the surface. There was always an easy to define issue that got struggled with. Which always had the powerless citizens counter-acting dracion edits by brutal overlords. This was the background of Robin Hood, standing in for all us poor-middle class wanting to act against tyranny, to strike back at our tormentors.! Made looks of kids actually wanting to act like Lincoln's better-half, doing what's right, no dam matter the cost...in politics, religion and even where family are used as pawns. And all those who watched them with me, well they thought the episodes were too short time wise:)",1464393600,,649,4.909090909090909
3910251,4,B002DH20YM,"I have only viewed the first season so this review may need to be updated.
So far I have enjoyed it greatly, as I did when it first was televised back in 1955. I have no issues with black and white programs since that is how I saw television until the mid 60s when color television was more common in homes that could finally afford it.
Despite the age of the series, there doesn't seem to be many issues with either the video or the audio. One thing that I have noticed is that the episodes are not only not in chronological order, but the earliest ones do not have the correct cast lists in all of them. Those episodes look to be the ones that have the sponsor named at the opening title. There aren't many of them, but it was disappointing not to know who played some of the roles
Having found the episode list with release dates on the Internet, the incorrect episode order makes it a bit odd to note King Richard being called ""dead"" in the Holy Land, when he appeared in two episodes previously.
That brings up another point. The final episode of season one in the set, ""The Prisoner"", is actually the first episode in season two according to the release date in the episode list with the plotlines and some featured cast members. With the wrong season one episode as the final, it seemed logical that the correct episode, ""The Scientist"", would be the first one on season two. But that too is not the case. ""The Scientist"" is actually the second episode on the season two first disc. To make things even more scrambled up, the first episode of season two on the disc, ""A Village Wooing"", is actually a season three episode.
All in all, if the episodes not being in chronological order don't bother you, the Merry Men of Sherwood Forest should keep you well entertained. The staff fighting is more fun to watch than the sword play, and Little John and Friar Tuck provide quite a bit of the humor. I am looking forward to viewing the rest of the episodes and will update this review if it is warranted.",1462147200,3,2006,4.395161290322581

3910265,5,B002DH20YM,"This is a great series, action ,adventure, comedy, all suitable for the whole family. I remember watching them as reruns, as a kid. If they would produce this show now, and use the same scripts it would still be great, and for 10 bucks you cant go wrong.",1453507200,,254,4.3125
3910266,5,B002DH20YM,"Very inexpensive and has 143 episodes (complete series).  Picture quality is about as decent as you can expect for a 60 year old TV show; in fact, the quality is pretty good.  Many of the episodes are definitely taken from the American (CBS) prints, as they contain the ""Brought to you by Wildroot Cream-oil"" sponsor text in the show's opening.

The DVD packaging is nice; on par with all other recent Mill Creek multi-disc sets--i.e. hard shell case with DVDs in single sleeves secured inside.  Each disc has a simple menu that allows you to either ""Play All"" or choose a specific episode.  There are no ""bonus"" features, but that would be unnecessary (and probably raise the price).  Each individual DVD has artwork and a list of episodes.  All of the episodes are presented in the same order they aired in the US (not the same order as the UK); the only ""error"" is on Disc 9 (1st disc of Season 4) where a few episodes are out of order.  None of this really matters as each episode is stand-alone (plot-wise).  You can refer to IMDB's episode list to see the order.

Although I am not 100% certain, it appears that this series might have fallen into the Public Domain.  I've noticed that over 60 episodes are available on Archive.org, and the complete series is available on YouTube.  Regardless, Mill Creek has done an excellent job in making the complete series available at such a reasonable price and with very nice packaging.  If you've seen the show and enjoy it, I highly recommend purchasing this set.  If you are unfamiliar with the series, but are interested, I recommend checking out an episode online as a sample.  But by all means, purchase this box-set as it is great quality, inexpensive, and convenient.",1452988800,7,1722,4.674418604651163

3910297,4,B002DH20YM,"I grew up with this TV series and loved it then and still do.  I also have the 26 episode version from Synergy Entertainment/Topics Entertainment.  The short set is all digital remasters and it shows.  This set is from Mill Creek Entertainment, and as with most of their stuff is copies of VHS or other film copies, and it shows.  Had I not had the Topics set, I would have rated this one 5 stars simply for the completeness of the series.

The color on this set is a bit green/grey (not really sure how they did that) while the Topics set is crisp black and white.  That having been said, it's nice to have the complete set.

If you remember this show, or have just found an episode or two, you need to have this in your collection.  Richard Greene is very good as the always good Robin, and Alan Wheatley as the despicable Sheriff of Nottingham are well suited to play against each other.  Bernadette O'Farrell and Patricia Driscoll split the roll of Maid Marian about the half way point in the series.  You'll see other familiar English actors as well;  Archie Duncan as Little John also played Inspector Lestrade in the Sherlock Holmes series; Leo McKern (OK, he's an Aussie) from Ladyhawk, Rumpole of the Bailey, etc.; Ronald Howard who played Sherlock Holmes opposite Archie Duncan and a host of others who you will recognize.

We would say It's family friendly - where the plots of the bad guys are foiled by the wittiness of the good guys. Though Robin Hood is an outlaw in the bad guys eyes, he is loyal to the king, his laws, & loves the people like his king does. Some of the episodes are fiction but others are based on actual events.

Half an hour later, I was wondering why I'd never seen this delight before.

There are 143 episodes, and while not all are high art, they are all something you can share with the family, filled with the legendary Robin of Loxley and his Merry Men, Friar Tuck and Maid Marian, and a host of others living and fighting for the right to be free men and women, sometimes with bow and arrows, and once in a while, with the greatness of their intellects.

Don't let the lack of vibrant color mislead you:  the vividness of the joy the actors have in their parts shines through quite pleasingly.  Give it a chance, and one rainy afternoon, you might be dreaming of Sherwood Forest and taking a few of the King's deer, yourself.",1392163200,2,957,4.451428571428571

Alan Wheatley makes a wonderfully sinister Sheriff of Nottingham and Patricia Driscoll was a beautiful Maid Marian.  Well done, Mill Creek Entertainment for making this available.

The first couple of episodes were a little dark, but I supposed that it was because they were early - maybe copy of a copy - and the settings were not as slick as those done today might be, but the stories were family-friendly and always had a good relationship message at the end, as well as some information concerning English laws of the period.  The characters were likeable, and Robin and his Merry Men seemed more like Peter Pan and the Lost Boys to me as a youngster.  Knowing now that the some of the scripts were written by banned artists from the US during the terrible ""red"" investigations make them even more interesting.

It was a fan favorite among adults and kids alike though after rewatching it I didn't recall it having as much violence as it does - ah, well, it was the 50's. The episodes are complete, in order and the stories and Richard Green are very good for that era of TV weekly series.  But the quality of the video has suffered over the years and little or nothing has been done for this release to restore it. The video is dark and lacks contrast at times and is washed out and hazy at others. It doesn't always run smoothly and there's a fair bit of ""drop out"" spotting- all of which is to be expected from something of this age and recording type and some might argue it adds to the the nostalgia but to me nostalgia comes from seeing and remembering something as close to the way they were as possible. Distributors have been scouring around and gobbling up vintage shows and movies to release to a growingly nostalgic DVD buying audience,  investing little for the rights and even less or nothing at all for cleanup and presentation to make the most money. It's sad to see how little they care about what they put out and how much the buyers care for this kind of access to vintage shows they  love that they're willing to buy whatever quality they dish out.",1373068800,6,1324,4.330645161290323

3910346,5,B002DH20YM,"I grew up in the 50's watching Saturday morning adventure shows and Robin Hood with Richard Green and his foil, the Sheriff of Nottingham, was a staple. It wasn't that I was dying to relive my youth but for $11 for the entire 4-year run of shows I couldn't resist. It's been fun watching these old classics but I didn't realize as a kid how cheesy some of the sets and scenery was in these early TV adventure shows. However, that doesn't takeaway from enjoying seeing them again. A side benefit as a kid growing up in Southern California was that it introduced us to what it was like in England in the Middle Ages. Okay, I study English history and realize that Robin Hood is a grossly sanitized version of what real life was like in 13th century England but for an 8-year old it piqued my interest about history in foreign lands. If you saw these shows as a kid you'd probably get a kick seeing them again but if you're too young to have seen them originally I doubt you'd appreciate them. Kids today would certainly be bored. Not nearly enough enough explosions, sex, mutilations and car crashes.",1360454400,3,1098,4.467661691542289
3910347,5,B002DH20YM,"I absolutely love this show.  I was born in the 80's and have only seen it as an adult so this show has no reminiscing value for me.  Sure there are a few corny episodes(more common towards the end of the series) but the vast majority of the episodes, I love.  Many have very good plots.  My favorite has to be the one where they steal the mint and start producing ""counterfeit"" silver coins of the realm that have higher levels of silver than the ""official"" silver coins of the realm making the sheriff look bad so that he has to pay to restore the coinage to it's full value.  Close behind is the fishing episode where Robin tricks the Lord of the Manor into trading fishing rights on his own property for the release of one of his serfs.  I laughed so hard every time Robin would hit him on the head with a piece of brush to simulate being being led to the secret pond as he leads him around in circles blindfolded to a spot 15 feet from where they started.

I bought all the seasons as they came out and loved everyone.  But after the full series came out and was offered for such a ridiculously low price I decided to buy a backup in case anything happened to one of the disc and it was no longer available.  I don't know if I've ever purchased anything in my life that I got more out of for the price.  Especially since I gave it to my parents to watch and they loved it as well.  This is a steal.

The funny thing is when I first got this show I watched one episode and was annoyed by it being too scratchy and didn't like the sound in the opening.  But it seemed OK and I didn't feel like getting up so I watched another.  After three episodes I was hooked and kept saying I can squeeze in one more episode. If I had felt more ambitious that day I might have gotten up and watched something else.  So glad I was lazy that day.  After a few episodes the scratchiness either went away or I became immune to it as it I no longer noticed it.  Later on at a family gathering I asked everyone if they wanted to watch Robin Hood.  They said sure and I put it in and my younger brother was immediately annoyed by the black and white and said he thought I meant ""Robin Hood Men in Tights"".  He made fun of the show at first but after a few episodes played through and I didn't immediately start the next episode he said ""you gonna start another one?""  I said ""I thought you didn't like it?""  He said ""it's not too bad.""  Yeah it draws you in.  If you hate reality TV and most of the trash that is on TV today then you'll love this show.  If you like that stuff then you probably won't.  The show is totally clean, relaxing, happy/lighthearted/fun, and peaceful to watch.  The show has an excellent cast and I find the reuse of the same non-essential character actors in different episodes as different characters adds to the charm of the show.

If you enjoy this show I also highly recommend The Buccaneers, and Sir Lancelot.  And possibly Wanted Dead or Alive, with Steve McQueen, it's feel is a little more serious most of the time but still a similar feel.  All are excellent!",1359590400,5,3078,4.187074829931973

Riddled with witty remarks and conversation, it can be difficult for some to follow, but most would find it quite smart. A 1950s series, it is in black and white but still quite clear; where violence and action are emphatic in later productions of this legendary hero, those are replaced with far better results here with wit, plot and moral. Many episodes are quite amusing from the point of their contemporary relevance: in some, Robin hood and his band are saving the downcast from a totalitarian regime, quite daring at a time of such political crisis; other episodes present humourous inventions of hundreds of years later: for example, a cannon powered by ""iron substances"" propelled by ""devil crackers"".

Only the ever apparent shuffling of actors can be a reason of complaint. While ten actors are so are found in almost every episode (especially in the first two seasons) playing different roles in different make-up, later in the series illustrious characters like Lady Marion and the Sheriff of Nottingham are suddenly replaced. Admittedly the actors that play Robin's men in one episode, a soldier in another etc., can be a source of amusement; however a word of disappointment might be heard when such lovable characters suddenly look, sound and act differently.

On the whole I highly recommend this for family fun.",1355961600,2,1478,5.103305785123967

It would be worth a fortune by todays standards. Watching it now you can see how non-realistic the inside of the castles were made but as a kid you could not find a more realistic place.

Not only did it do that, but our grandson starting watching the episodes with me and also fell in love with Robin Hood---even in black & white! We loved it so much, we had to find the rest of the seasons. We were thrilled when we found them here on Amazon al together in one boxed set.
We've watched all 4 seasons, and they were great! It just amazes me how the writers came up with all the clever, new plot twists each week.

Over the past six months however, we have watched the entire series and thought it to be wonderful! My brothers enjoy reading about the crusades and their time period, and the movie appears to stick to the facts very closely. Richard Greene does a wonderful job portraying Robin Hood as a fearless and cunning leader against the wily Sherriff of Nottingham and Price John. Multiple times he makes his way in and out of London Tower under the very nose of the Price and his guards, and only rarely is he detained at all, though his identity is often discovered before he leaves. Lady Marion is wonderfully portrayed and her romance with Robin gets them into some dangerous and often hilarious adventures.

The whole family enjoys the stories, and the theme song gets stuck into one's head, and my oldest loves jumping around (particularly after donning his homemade bow and arrow set) and singing the song at the top of his lungs.  :)

The picture quality is pretty good, sometimes a little washed out (we watch movies on a projector, and so are particularly intolerant of low contrast), but almost all of them are perfectly fine, and we've yet to have one that wasn't watchable.

3910371,4,B002DH20YM,"There have been several versions of THE ADVENTURES OF ROBIN HOOD.  You can find the story in at least a half dozen live action films...a Disney animated Classic...as well as a version that is UNRATED!  But to be perfectly honest, NOTHING surpasses the 1955-1959 Television Show starring Richard Greene.  Millcreek Entertainment originally released the first 3 seasons in separate volumns.  I purchased Volumn 1 which contained the Origin of Robin Hood, his encounters with Little John, Maid Marian, Friar Tuck, and The Sheriff of Nottingham.  But after 39 episodes and a few too many glasses of mulled wine, I wanted more!  So in 2009, I discovered that Millcreek Entertainment had ALL 143 Episodes available on extended DVD discs.

While Richard Greene portrayed Robin throughout the entire series, there were a few cast changes---including Lady Marian (Bernadette O'Farrell to Patricia Driscoll) as well as an alternate Little John (for Archie Duncan) in about 6 shows.  Alan Wheatley...who portrayed the Sheriff of Nottingham...seems to be missing during the final 2 seasons. But just about every other actor is consistant...including Ian Hunter who portrays the part of King Richard, The Lionhearted in several episodes. [Don't confuse this portrayal with 1939's ""Tower of London"" where Ian played the not-so-nice King Richard].

Now the technical stuff.  Before the series went into syndication, there were designated sponsors that got a ""brought to you by.."" during the opening and closing credits.  How many men reading this remember using Wildroot Cream Oil on their hair? Or Johnson & Johnson's Band-Aid Plastic Strips? Or Johnson & Johnson's First Aid Cream?  There's a plug for one or more of these products in some of the episodes.  It's too bad Millcreek couldn't have left one commercial in the middle of these sponsored episodes...simply because it's always fun to watch ""the stars of tomorrow"" pitching a commercial product!

Potential buyers reading this should understand that most of the material came from film stock.  So the quality of some of the episodes will vary.  The program was originally shot in black and white at Shepperton Studios in England...and then flown to the USA via Pan American Airlines!  I remember CBS airing the show at 7:30pm on Monday evenings. [This was back in the 1950s when the networks were responsible for 4 hours of programming per night--following the 6:30pm half-hour newscasts]. So you're going to notice an occasional splice or dark spot.  But if you can cope with those minor defects...FOLLOW ROBIN'S ARROW TO A WONDERFUL TV SERIES! Feel free to enjoy the shows with a large cut of wild boar and a sturdy mug of mulled wine-----assuming you have access to both???",1316736000,3,2721,5.159453302961276

Let's just say that I could sing the theme song long before I could sing anything else.  The oddity might be that the sponsor no longer exists (or does it?).  Richard Greene is a fabulous Robin Hood.  Don't confuse him with Richard Todd - that was the Disney movie.  This is the really good series.

3910375,5,B002DH20YM,"This show was magic to me when I watched it as a youngster on morning TV circa 1962. The spark is still there in 143 episodes in DVD format at a very reasonable price. Picture quality is very good and clean. It's a pleasure to see the quality British actors from that era esp. Richard Green who was so good in classic films like Kentucky and Forever Amber, and Alan Wheatley as the Sheriff who received raves from actors who subsequently played that role. Donald Pleasance went on to play Blofeld in the early Bond films, Edward Mulhare of the Ghost and Mrs. Muir, John Schlesinger, brother and sister child actors Peter Asher of Peter and Gordon pop fame and Jane Asher who grew up to become Paul McCartney's girlfriend, all make appearances. You will enjoy the heroic nature of these eps and they hold up in entertainment value and interest even after 55 years.

3910376,5,B002DH20YM,"I really enjoy this series. Richard Greene is the only actor who comes very close to Eroyl Flynn as Robin Hood.  Until reading one persons review, I didn't know that there was a hiatus, I'm quessing that's why a different actress played Maid Marion.  Not that I have any objections, I don't Patricia Driscolle is quite good in the role. The other actress for whatever reason was unavaiable.  It very likely had to do with that hiatus, she must have been doing something else, though the others like Alexander Gauge came back. I would have liked for the series to have closure.  Meaning that King Richard comes back, Robin's estates and wealth are restored, all of the rest of the merry men free, no longer outlaws.  And of course Robin Hood and Maid Marion marry and live happlily ever after!  Oh well, we all know that is what happens after the show went off the air. Of all the actors who played more than one role Paul Eddington played more different roles than the others.  And in the final season, season four on this 11 disc set, had a regular role as Will Scarlet. I recommend this TV show to everyone, add this to your DVD collection, you won't be sorry. This is a contuation of the above review, written earlier.  I sometimes read other reviews, to see what others think, and I find it quite interesting.  Like I'm not the only one who thinks that Richard Greene is the only one of all the other actors to play Robin Hood, who comes a very close second to Erroll Flynn in the role.  This DVD can even be viewed by today's kids, who in my view shouldn't think it as dated, unlike the others, because this takes place during the middle ages.  Even though its produced for kids, it didn't surgarcoat how things were during that time.  It should make us feel lucky that we live in the 21st century.  So much injustice, and the Lords of the Manor abusing right and left their power over the people who work the Lords land.  In one epsoide Friar Tuck, One Lord wants land that the other has, and agreed to marry him to the daughter of a man who worked on his land.  But while not a serf, she also is not his social equal, so marry her?  Oh well it's a show produced for kids so that had to be that way, and not the other one. Once more I recommend this TV show.  Sometimes like  the shows are not  in their proper air time, like the ones that Ian Hunter starring as Sir Richard of the Lea, two examples of not being constistn like this is in the Knight who comes to Dinner.  He had to get a loan from the abbott(a disgrace to his office) in order to get his son away because by accident he killed a son whose father is a crony of Prince John and they were going to have him arrested for murder.  So Sir RIchard used the loan to have him join in the fight in the Holy Land.  But in another one The Bethothal, his son loves music and is not a jouster.  But from the way he and his wife talked he is the only son.  Sir Richard needed to marry his son off so that he can pay his ransom when he lost a match.  Will always recommend this to others.  To one reviewer who said that in this Ian Hunter played King Richard, he did in the 1938 movie version of The Adventures of Robin Hood, but in this he played Sir Richard of the Lea.",1303948800,,3228,4.191247974068071

Produced in England, and starring every kid's second favorite ""Outlaw of Sherwood"", Richard Greene (and he was a VERY close second to Errol Flynn!), this four-season (1955-1960), half-hour series provided 143 episodes of humor, swordplay, and the kind of adventure we all dreamed of. It spawned a fan club that encompassed two continents and thousands of youthful members, made Mr. Greene a VERY wealthy man, and, surprisingly, holds up quite well, over 50 years later!

Truthfully, there are technical problems with this collection; the episode quality ranges from unremastered and scratchy, to poorly remastered and tinted in blue; some episodes are repeated on different discs; and some are out of sequence (the 'Richard of the Lea' episodes featuring the 1938 Errol Flynn film's 'King Richard', Ian Hunter, are very mixed-up and a bit confusing). But the collection is still quite watchable (with improved picture quality in later seasons), and the price is amazingly affordable...and deserves five stars!

Shot on a very tight budget, the program had a 'stock company' of supporting actors, who would play different roles each episode; over the course of the series, Maid Marian would be portrayed by two different actresses (Bernadette O'Farrell, then Patricia Driscoll); there would also be very brief substitutions of Little John and Will Scarlett, although the lion's share of episodes featured Archie Duncan and Paul Eddington in the roles. Two wonderful actors became fan favorites; Alexander Gauge, as a corpulent, very witty Friar Tuck, and Alan Wheatley, oozing villainy as the Sheriff of Nottingham. The series also offered a rising generaton of young British stars, early in their careers, including Donald Pleasance (who occasionally appeared as Prince John), Billie Whitelaw, Ian Bannen, Leo McKern, Jane Asher, Nigel Davenport, Anne Reid, Gordon Jackson, Edward Mulhare, Lawrence Naismith, Charles Gray, Desmond Llewellyn, Michael Gough, Nigel Green, Gary Raymond, Edward Judd, and many more. The talent behind the camera was top-notch, as well, with respected directors like Lindsay Anderson, Don Chaffey, and Hammer Films legend, Terence Fisher, and writers, including Ring Lardner, Jr., Howard Dimsdale, and Jan Read.

Many episodes of the series carried on the Hollywood (and literary) tradition of Robin defending England for King Richard, while defying the ambitions of Prince John, with a bit more 'bite' than earlier incarnations; producer Hannah Weinstein, an expatriate American in England to avoid the McCarthy 'witchhunts', encouraged blacklisted American writers to join her in England, and pen scripts condemning political, religious, or scientific repression by Prince John and his minions; other episodes were straightforward morality tales, often humorous but occasionally more serious, some of which were, in fact, based on the Robin Hood ballads of Medieval England, giving the series a sense of authenticity many other series have lacked, and a timeless universal appeal for generations of viewers!

This series is a joy, one that I have truly enjoyed revisiting over a half-century after their initial broadcast, and can highly recommend for children and adults, today!",1302048000,6,4051,6.177304964539007

Fortunately, Richard is King: he is a brilliant military leader, commands great loyalty, and above all - he is just.  Unfortunately, Richard is in the Holy Land, and in his absence, the unscrupulous Prince John reigns.

If you find yourself tramping down a dirt road through Sherwood Forest, keep a sharp lookout - this greenwood is the home of outlaws wanted by the ruthless Sheriff of Nottingham.  Suddenly you hear a whir and thump; an arrow quivers in a nearby tree!  Brigands surround you; their long bows drawn.  Now what?

If you have been unjust in your courts, have levied arbitrary and backbreaking taxes, have unfairly confiscated your serf's possessions, or you are loyal to the devious Prince John, then they will take all that you have and send you on your way.  On the other hand, you may be invited to a feast in the forest; alas, you may still have to make a contribution. . . .

Blindfolded, you are lead to the camp.  You smell venison; your blindfold comes off.  A bearded giant seats you next to a portly Friar.  Across from you sits a maiden dressed as a page.  She looks adoringly at the curly-haired, dimpled-cheeked Robin Hood.  He stands, raises his cup, and announces, ""A toast to King Richard!""  His merry band shouts back, ""To King Richard!""

the perfect Robin Hood in this 1950's long running British series. After catching a few episodes on TV, we instantly fell in love with the series, and bought this DVD for an excellent price.

3910390,5,B002DH20YM,"Having never seen this series on television and with only reviews as a guide, I purchased all 143 episodes and braced myself. What an absolute joy this turned out to be. Charming characters, distinctive good guys and bad guys, interesting stories and all with a little touch of romance. After watching nearly half the episodes, the series has still not yielded one bad episode or lost any of it's charm. Each episode is a 25 minute upbeat investment that makes you feel good and positive. As an added bonus some of the first episodes have snippets of commercials from the 1950's imbedded in the opening. Great stuff.

The sound quality is respectable, and aside from the black and white tones lightening or darkening slightly with each episode or occasionally taking on a greenish hue, this is highly watchable. The local peasant characters, the castles, the sword fights, and the knights in their period costumes make for a television series that you will look forward to watching. America has westerns and the British have their medieval romps. Robin Hood is a gem that gets the highest recommendation.",1271462400,30,1104,4.935483870967742

  The programs themselves from this long running series, staring Richard Greene, are great. Filmed on location in England, Robin and his Merry Men romp through Sherwood Forestpursued by the Vile Sherrif of Nottingham. Enjoy all 4 seasons of Robin, Maid Marion, Friar Tuck, Little John,The Sherrif,and Derwent.

The transfers of the old 1950's prints are excellent considering their age and it's easy to find individual episodes. This pack of every episode is excellent value for money...it will take me months to view them all. Only a baby-boomer would love them for nostalgia sake. Like Superman, there is a lot of ""suspension of disbelief"" required. It was good, clean, values-driven TV for kids in the 60's.

Each disc has a standard paper sleeve. All of the discs store in one cavity in the case.

3910399,5,B002DH20YM,"Usually, I buy videos of vintage television to see if the quality stands up.  In this instance, I was eager to see the complete series, since I had not done as a child.  Thus, much of this was a new experience.  Crafted to appeal to children,
it may have been, but the production values reflect a high level of maturity.  I was impressed immediately with the quality of the writing and the acting.  There was variety and substance in the themes that surpassed most American products of the time.  Enamored as I was then with westerns, rolling relentlessly across the screen like herds of buffalo, action appealed more than dialogue, though neither
of those things was held to a high standard in the schlock that replaced British imports like ""The Adventures of Robin Hood.""  All the substance of a tumbleweed.
I wish there were more than 143 episodes to savor, now.

3910401,5,B002DH20YM,"This TV series has hung in my memory over 40 years, obviously my first introduction to english culture, long before seeing Errol Flynn in the big screen version of Robin Hood. This is an early review of this series, mind you, before seeing the 90 or so remaining episodes. No matter. If you like ""I, Claudius, "" and ""Poldark,"" you must see this wonderful black-and-white introduction to the British standards of locale/studio dramatizations. With adult eyes, I am amazed at the way the writers avoided trampling the Hollywood scene cliches to this fable, realizing they had more time to add depth and imagination to this Robin Hood, maintaining its plausability along the way. For instance, how did Robin gain leadership over the men of Sherwood Forest? He earned it, reluctantly, by displaying a deeper wisdom in proving himself. Having seen the early (1929)silent Fairbanks ""Robin Hood,"" shot in romantic hues of light and dark, with spare period furniture,it is apparent to me now that the British team of craftsmen may have had that in mind in their location shooting. The noblemen do speak more eloquently than the peasantry, but each has their code of honor or dishonor accordingly. If you have kids and would like to introduce them to the harmless myths like Robin Hood that will remain with them years later, this is a great introduction like Life 101. Episodes will pit greed against obligation; obligations to king or the gang; right versus might. Loyalty to the gang or the family. There is clearly a logic and rationale upon which each episode hangs. We are rational beings is what Robin Hood argues throughout and that right gets contested and we must be fit for that contest daily. There is a greater need for this moral fable today, wouldn't you agree? Richard Greene as this TV Robin Hood, makes clear from the start the importance of words, honor, loyalty; our priorities; and that they fit our actions in determining the outcome of our affairs. And, of course, 90 or so episodes later, we think we have viewed a harmless fable. After college, we call it philosophy without text-editing crib sheets. Of the many reasons to admire this series, the one most impressive is how well this series holds up to the TV period dramas 25 years later.",1263081600,69,2256,4.832041343669251
3910402,5,B002DH20YM,"Normally, Im not much into the older style shows like this. But I really like this one.",1262995200,,87,4.176470588235294
3910403,5,B002DH20YM,"My 5-star rating takes into consideration (1) other television programs during the same time period and (2) how well the programs teach moral/ethical values, in a way that is not 'preachy' to children.
I would emphasize that these episodes are aimed toward children, and therefore adults with IQs over 120 might find these episodes tedious.

Each episodes is approximately 25 minutes. Episodes were interesting, humorous, and well-written. While not overly intelligent, they make much better television entertainment than most shows on TV today in terms of values.

Therefore, I would recommend this collection for individuals with children who dislike the TV programs (for children) today. These Robin Hood episodes do teach values to children and should be interesting. [For example: I have a brother in 4th grade who detests BBC classics like Pride & Prejudice, Bleak House, Oliver Twist, etc. However, he loved these episodes of Robin Hood.]

Of course, the episodes are black and white, and the special effects are quite poor. (ex: The actor who plays Little John wears wears shoes with about 10 inch soles to make him appear taller.) However, I do not really believe the lack of special effects harmed these episodes.

Also, if you wish, you watch many episodes on YouTube to see and hear for yourself before purchasing.

However, at over 3,000 minutes, I believe this collection is certainly a good deal.

Also recommended:

3910404,5,B002DH20YM,"As an American kid this TV series was ten years before my time. I did have Howard Pyle's classic novel ""The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood"" in one of those Whitman books you could buy from a display in a drug store. I thoroughly enjoyed reading that, but I have never seen any filmed versions of Robin Hood until now (not counting Mel Brooks' series ""When Things Were Rotten""). I was tempted to watch Kevin Costner's ""Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves,"" but I never did because I suspected the story would be updated for modern prejudices much like Kevin Sorbo's ""Hercules,"" which one reviewer described as ""a surfer dude on his way to a Renaissance fair.""

When I bought the complete first season of the Richard Greene series for five bucks at Wal-Mart, I figured it would be fun, not knowing that I would be both surprised and amazed at the quality of the acting, the writing, and the way it was filmed. I have since bought the complete four-year series. It really takes you back into a credible medieval atmosphere. It may have once been considered a kid's show, but it surely has kept the adults entertained around our house! It also brought back pleasant memories of a time in our culture when writers took romantic heroism seriously, and didn't have to turn everything into tongue-in-cheek ""camp.""

In some circles today it is popular to criticize Robin Hood as the world's first socialist, because he ""robbed from the rich to give to the poor."" If that were true he would be an evil man. But this TV series sets the record straight by showing that Robin was an avenger of the poor, who only took from the rich what they had previously stolen and returned it to its rightful owners.

And speaking of avengers, I was also a fan of the British television series ""The Avengers."" The women in that show, Catherine Gale, Emma Peel, and Tara King, all had respectable British properness, but underneath all that was this element of delicious mischief. I am now going to have to add Bernadette O'Farrell's Maid Marian to my mental list of ""Hottest British Women.""

I am extremely pleased with my purchase, and my wish for you is to get as much pleasure out of this wonderful series as I have!",1261094400,3,2187,4.6
