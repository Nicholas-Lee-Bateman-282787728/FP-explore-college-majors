The videos are DVDs, but they're just a straight-up copy from the VHS videos.  This means that there is no way to skip around in the menu by topic - heck, there ISN'T even a menu!  The only option is to start from the beginning and fast-forward to any part you want to see.  I doubt that'll really be a problem for other buyers, though, because these videos don't HAVE parts you'd want to see.  Whereas most Standard Deviants videos have cute scenarios which provide additional information and explanations for students, these videos don't have any of them.  All they've got is the straightforward explanation that you could get from any instructor - no additional details, no scenarios with memory aids, no explanations. In addtion, the order the subjects were presented in, and the words used (without definitions, remember) were quite different from the terms that were being used in my Statistics class.

In short, the videos turned out to be LESS than no help, because they confused me in the areas I'd understood before I watched them.  My class was a statistics class for the social sciences, so if you're taking a straight-up Stats class, your results might vary.  Or they might not - we did cover the same material as the regular Stats class, after all.  And the lack of a menu with section titles seriously limits the usefulness of these videos regardless of what class you're taking - to say nothing of the lack of explanation. In my case, I felt totally cheated - the DVDs were a complete waste of money.  They were so bad I can't even advertise them for sale at the local university to get some of my money back, because I couldn't do that to a fellow student.

I hate to leave such a scathing review - please note that the seller was very good, and the DVDs arrived on time and in good condition.  It was the Standard Deviant organization that FAILED on this, not the seller.",1328313600,5,1934,4.571014492753624
