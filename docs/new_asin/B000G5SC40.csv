8128969,2,B000G5SC40,"Having seen the very nicely produced HDNet WMV-HD title ""Shuttle Discovery's Historic Mission"", I was keen to see this title as well. I figured that since it came with a standard definition DVD, it was extra bang-for-the-buck, and it would make a nice demo disc in my home theater.

Much to my disappointment (and surprise), this standard-definition DVD is mastered in a letterboxed 4:3 aspect-ratio, not anamorphic widescreen 16:9 like the original high-definition source! What the...?! To add insult to injury, the 4:3 transfer is pretty p*ss poor at that, with oversaturated colors one minute and washed out black levels the next on an ISF-calibrated HD display. Hardly the quality one should get from a down-converted HD source. Ouch!",1155340800,2,738,5.201680672268908
