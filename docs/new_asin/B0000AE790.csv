7996827,3,B0000AE790,"First of all this movie is a thriller it is not a horror movie. It is basically a hospital based who done it with some weak science fiction elements thrown in. All in all I think the movie is rather good. There are some cheesy parts and if you are looking for a typical horror flick then this is not it. But the story is decent, it is a weird science story about a mad doctor that have found a way to regenerate damage to his body that now run around an kill pepole to get the body fluids he need for his regeneration as well as for revenge on the pepole that fired him, but the story is not a big masterpiece, see the film for what it is, a cheap thrill and a bit of fun entertainment without much dept and you will not be disappointed.",1232928000,,737,3.9864864864864864
