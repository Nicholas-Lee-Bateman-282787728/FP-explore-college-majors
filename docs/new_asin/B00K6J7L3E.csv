6403567,5,B00K6J7L3E,"A very underrated film with talented character actors and a good Ring Lardner story.  Henry (not Harry)Morgan's only starring role, one that mirrors his cynical radio and subsequent TV personality, is a delight.  An early Carl Foreman adaptation and Stanley Kramer production that was directed with surprising inventiveness (for its day) by Richard Fleischer. This film hasn't surfaced for many years and deserves to be viewed by wider audiences that appreciate good post-war film-making.",1414022400,12,488,5.581081081081081
6403568,2,B00K6J7L3E,"There is some quick enough dialogue but the overall movie drags. Henry Morgan's humor is low key and dry, but the characters just aren't interesting as is the plot. Don't waste your time.",1375228800,7,187,4.696969696969697

6403582,3,B00K6J7L3E,"It was interesting to see Henry Morgan in a movie. I gathered, after reading his bio, that he was primarily a ""voice"" character on radio. My recollections of him were from his appearances as a regular panel member on the TV program, ""I've Got a Secret"". Boy, I'm really dating myself.

The premise of the movie was interesting. Henry Morgan played his deadpan character very well. I think he made the movie interesting, at least to me; but, overall, the movie just couldn't get past ""average"".

I watched the movie while eating supper. So, if you have some time to kill, or really bad insomnia, I don't think you'll be completely bored by watching it. I wasn't.

By the way, I don't write detailed, play by play accounts of movies. People that do write those kinds of reviews are called ""spoilers"" and I find those reviews both boring as well as irritating.  That's what watching the movie is about. A review is an opinion, not a script. To each his own.",1445558400,3,954,4.56140350877193

6403600,5,B00K6J7L3E,"A wonderful collection of screwy characters are shrewdly observed by the acerbic Henry Morgan, playing a character who easily mirrors his own radio persona. This story is taken from the novel, The Big Town by the fabulous Ring Lardner. I grew up watching movies from this era, and adore them. Ring Lardner was blacklisted by the House Un-American Activities Committee, which elevates his cachet tremendously in the eyes of this reviewer. It's hard to pick a favorite line from this outrageously whimsical film, but if I had to pick one, I'd say the description of Rudy Vallee as ""a man with looks you could pour on a pancake"" easily stands out!",1427155200,6,644,4.8108108108108105

8656296,3,B00K6J7L3E,"Unfortunately 3 stars is considered as a negative review. So this is New York is a pleasant enough comedy. It is rarely laugh out loud funny but very family friendly and mostly amusing. It is from a slower time and is paced accordingly. My recommendation is that this is a rent once movie though I can see it as having its fans.

Henry Morgan as Peter Finch, our narrator and main star could have made this his movie. He is well supported by a number of names most notably a not so young Rudy Vallee (Herbert Daley) as  Texas wheeler dealer Herbert Daley, a muted Hugh Herbert as the very rich an odd Mr. Lucious Trumbal, and grown up Bowery Boy, Leo Gorcey (Sid Mercer). Even so Morgan never breaks out or above what is a low energy comedy.
The plot is based on the book by the same name written by Ring Lardner. Ring Lardner was a contender as one of the Mark Twains of his generations. A better case is that Ring was writing in the tradition of Twain, if not quite with Twains skill. I found the book slightly funnier than the movie, in part because I did not read it all in one sitting. The movies is mostly faithful to the movie with some action action, justifying the name moving pictures.
Having come into some money and at his wifes insistence the Finches, husband, wife and sister in Law travel from South Bend Indiana to New York City for the purpose of finding a suitable husband for little sister. So the basic plot mirrors How to Marry A Millionaire, but with a greater emphasis on Mid-Western common sense and eye for value. That is Mr. Finch wants to be realistic but the ladies are ready to spend it all on the chances the expected marriage will make good the costs. Early on Mr. Finch will come across as too negative and too ready to feel cheated by the cost of life in New York. As the different episodes that make up the movie roll, he will not be out of pocket so much as forced to contend with a parade of Post WW II high fashion. Some of the best jokes are the high fashion dresses.",1520380800,,2005,4.273684210526316
8656297,4,B00K6J7L3E,"A contented cigar store worker in Indiana is forced by his wife to travel to New York when she and her sister inherit a large amount of money. He tries to keep track of the money, his wife spends with abandon, and her sister looks for a rich husband. This is a breezy comedy which surprises with wit and laugh-out-loud predicaments.
