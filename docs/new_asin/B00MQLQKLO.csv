6599925,5,B00MQLQKLO,"Five-stars for ""The Usual Suspects,"" which is why I bought this 4 Film Favorites package. The entire cast is remarkable. I won't repeat some of the other reviews regarding the surprising plot twists. On a 1st screening, this film* is well-worth the price paid. Spacey definitely deserved the 1995 supporting actor Academy Award.

*  I'll give attention to the other films separately; each needs a little attention including Platoon, which I've never seen (despite being a Vietnam War veteran).",1433462400,9,493,5.227848101265823
