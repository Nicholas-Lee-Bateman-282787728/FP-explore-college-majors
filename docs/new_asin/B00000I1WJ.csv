8588946,4,B00000I1WJ,This one is the ending to Legend Crystania. It was a bit of a dissapointment because they only made 4 tapes. But at least they did not make tons of tapes our you would not be able to see them all. Thats whats good about Legend of Crystania. Theres no annoying transformation like Sailor Moon and Pretty Sammy what is so annoying and it wastes most of the time watching the same thing again and again once would have been better. There's action and fantasy in this one. Even at the ending I found myself wondering what happened to each of the characters after. I recommend this to anyone over 14 cause of the violence. I found it good also that there was no bad stuff if you get what I mean apart from violence. But before you see this one you have got to see the first 3 then you will know what this already happended.,996105600,,818,4.2165605095541405
