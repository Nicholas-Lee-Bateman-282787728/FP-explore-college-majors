8559217,4,B00AYHWCNM,"""Flaming Star"" is definitely one of Elvis' better movies.  It's a good western all the way around.  The focus is on the racial tensions between the Kiowas and the white people settling on their land in Texas.  Elvis is half Kiowa and half white, so is caught in the middle.  His mother is played by silent movie star Delores Del Rio.  His father is veteran character actor John McIntire.  Steve Forrest, plays Elvis' brother,  Alfonso Bedoya is excellent as the Indian chief.  All do a good job.  Barbara Eden has only a small part.  Elvis appears to do his own fight scenes.  I recommend this movie.

""Love Me Tender"".  You already know this was Elvis' first movie.  I saw it on first release in 1956 and liked it then as I do now.  It's a good western starring Richard Egan, and Elvis in a supporting role generally does a good job of acting.  My main distraction was the really heavy eye shadow the makeup artist put on Elvis in certain scenes.  It looks so bad.  I like the four songs.  I much prefer the country sound and the string band over the pop/rock schlock from so many of the later movies. I liked Elvis as a country and rockabilly singer before any of the later pop and rock and roll fans knew about him. I even got to see his outdoor performance with The Jordanaires in Honolulu in November 1957, as well as another one in 1976 a year before his death.  I liked the first concert best.

There are some extras that are not listed on the package:
1.  Commentary by Jerry Schilling (I did not listen to it)
2. Elvis Hits Hollywood - 13 minutes
3. The Colonel and the King - 11 minutes
4. Love Me Tender (the birth of Love Me Tender) - 8 minutes
5. Still Gallery - lots of photos
6. Four Elvis trailers

""Wild in the Country"".  The screenplay was written by noted playwright Clifford Odets so there is more attention to plot than in most of Elvis' later movies.  The story is a drama and becomes pretty heavy-duty soap opera by the film's end.",1408147200,,1954,4.331491712707182
