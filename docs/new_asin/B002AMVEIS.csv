3889415,4,B002AMVEIS,"I'm on board with everyone, and happened to watch this film just as it started, like the first reviewer, not knowing what it was about, then saw the guy walk down the stairs, past the dead bloody bodies and thought, what have we hear? (Interestingly enough, another movie I watched under similar circumstances, many years earlier, was The Bad Seed.)
But the flaw: Jerry did not go so far from the scene of his earlier crime. And it was a big crime. His photograph would have been in the papers for miles. People in his new hometown would have recognized him. Fast. But if you can put that plot point aside, a hell of a scary movie. Even Shelly Hack is good, and the girl, Jill something, is very, very good.",1253923200,3,707,4.404580152671755
3889416,5,B002AMVEIS,"I Saw The Remake Trailer And Smiled

Why? Because I knew because of this we were finally gonna get the original Stepfather on DVD. This movie for me was one of those rare times I came home late put on cable an caught the opening scene without knowing what this movie was called or what it was about. Isn't that great when that happens? Your thinking what is this? Then he walked down those stairs passed the bodies and blood and out the door, I was glued to my TV from that moment on.  This has been one of my favorites ever since. You know what else is wonderful about this movie, the cinematography,the look and feel of this picture. The neighborhood,the fall,the leaves,trees, the homes the street the lighting.  I wish this were coming out on Blu Ray, hey maybe.

Till this day no matter how many times I've seen it I still get soooo humorously annoyed with JIM OGILVIE. He does this incredible job of tracking Jerry down. He knows the damn house he lives in now, walks in the door with his gun in his pocket lol and then is shocked to see him with blood on him.
What a boob! That and the sound of the phone hitting Shelly Hacks face still makes me cringe. Great writing, great directing, and wonderful acting,this film is scary yet so warm and inviting. You actually feel sorry for this lunatic. Must Have!",1250294400,23,1311,4.382716049382716

I'm a huge scarry movie fan, and I must admit, I'm a bit partial to the older films, than most of what comes out today.
That being said, If your seeking a real tale of fright, this is your movie.  It's funny, everytime you get together with people & talk about scarry movies, ""The Stepfather"" is either always the last one mentioned, or not mentioned at all; and I can't, for the life of me, understand why.
It's an original story, not like other scarry movies where the storyline is being used for the 100th time. This movie has everything you could want in a horror film.  It has the right elements of atmosphere, music,suspense, character development, and just the right amount of the red stuff . . . without going overboard!  I haven't seen  many films that actually bring these key elements together just right, and this one does it right.  There are a couple of comical moments, as is usual, but for the most part, this film is dark, serious, and means business.
Maybe that's it, maybe it's to real for people to accept.
I promise,when watching this one, you will not be leaving in the middle of the film for extra soda & popcorn!",1248134400,21,1218,4.443946188340807

I'm a little excited that this film is finally coming out on DVD.

This movie is an overlooked gem.  I saw this in the theaters back in 1987 and LOVED it.  Terry O'Quinn would go on to do other, higher-profile work (most notably the TV series ""Lost"") but it is hard to shake the image of him as Jerry Blake, murderous wolf in sheep's clothing.  It is perhaps the shrewdest acting work of his career.  It makes his turn as John Locke in ""Lost"" look cartoonish.  But hey, ""Lost"" is basically a cartoon anyway. A very expensively-shot cartoon, but a cartoon nonetheless.

O'Quinn would appear in the lesser sequel ""Stepfather 2"" but not ""Stepfather 3"" (yes, there was a third one).  The actor who took over the role for ""S3"" did a pretty decent job of ""channeling"" O'Quinn, though.  He got his mannerisms, facial expressions, and speech patterns down cold.

The good news is that some Hollywood studio is remaking this movie.  The bad news is that some Hollywood studio is remaking this movie.",1248048000,12,1072,4.597883597883598

3889511,5,B002AMVEIS,"DVD Review: Picture quality and sound is good. Also it includes an audio commentary, 2 page thing about the films production and retrospect junk about how wonderful these douche bags think they are for making a movie.

Movie Review: This is a really good horror/thriller based loosely on a real life killer John List who slaughtered his own family because he was a pussy. The idea of adding elements to the character like making him more serial killer like was really neat, the acting was great, the story was excellent and the daughters shower scene when we got to see her naked butt WAS F****** HOT!!! Definitely a step above any b-movie horror movie made.

3889535,4,B002AMVEIS,"This review is an excerpt from my book Killer Bs: The 237 Best Movies On Video Youve (Probably) Never Seen, which is available as an ebook on Amazon. If you enjoy this review, there are 236 more like it in the book (plus a whole lot more). Check it out!

THE STEPFATHER In the 1940s, we fought a viscious psychopath to protect the American Way of Life. Today, if you kill for that vision, *youre* the nutlike Jerry, a platitude-puking, pod-person paragon of 50s values, so square he makes Mike Brady look like Howard Stern. All Jerry wants is a little order in his lifeand mere perfection from his family. There are no gray areas in his philosophy, so any violation of the whitest white deserves the blackest punishment. If one family disappoints him... Well, hell just have to try, try again. It is the American way, after all. So when his faux family proves to have some real valueslike survival, self-reliance and insighthis defeat is a nail in the coffin of those vague, shallow Family Values weve been bombarded with for years. They always were a fantasyand if you live in a fantasy world too long, how can you be sane?

Thanks to scriptwriter Donald E. Westlake, whose literary efforts included both the most savage of hardboiled crime thrillers (Point Blank and the Parker series) and the most humorous of caper comedies (The Hot Rock and other titles in his Dortmunder series), the flick is filled with wickedly witty subtle touches, like Jerrys fondness for Freddy Krueger sweaters, a parody of Rockwells famous Thanksgiving painting, and an homage to two Hitchcock films in the final confrontation. Its a real psycho thriller, providing plenty of suspense and mind-games without the need for graphic gore.",1423267200,,1715,4.829931972789115

3889562,4,B002AMVEIS,"Jerry Blake (Terry O Quinn) is a man obsessed with having the perfect American Dream life: including the house with the white picket fence in the suburbs, an adoring wife and loving children.

He believes he has found it when he marries widow Susan Maine(Shelly Hack) and becomes the stepfather to her 16-year-old daughter Stephanie(Jill Schoelen), but Stephanie gets suspicious with an extremely uneasy feeling when she is around Jerry with his ""Father Knows Best"" attitude: she can see that there is a darker side behind his cheerful exterior.

Could she just be going through the typical teenager rebellion against her new stepfather, or is he actually the same man who brutally murdered his family just one year earlier?

3889604,4,B002AMVEIS,"SHOUT! Factory's DVDs and BluRays are sensational. I can't say it any more plainly than that. The picture on ""The Stepfather"" appears a bit dirty and unpolished, the sound a bit under-produced. Yet even in this state I find the movie a collector's item. Before there was Hannibal Lecter and the American Psycho (and after Henry), there was the stepfather, a perfect role for the breakout actor Terry O'Quinn, who does steal the show here--he is genuinely terrifying here. As a film, ""The Stepfather"" isn't perfect--but it's one of the best of its type, certainly more chilling than gross out, which is saying something. It probably doesn't fit under the label ""horror"" very neatly, but it is subtly disturbing and memorable.
The Shout! DVD also includes a neat making of featurette, which shows author Brian Garfield's thoughts, among other ideas from the filmmakers. It's a keeper bonus feature. Since we are so inundated these days with slasher movies and gross out effects, to say that ""The Stepfather"" is essential is superfluous. But as a suspense movie, it's quite thrilling--if not terribly surprising. The film does, however, have good economic sense, a belief that smaller is okay after all, the intelligence to make more out of less, and it features fine performances and a good script. Director Ruben should have continued making abnormal psychology studies such as this rather than turning his hand to cheap exploitation shockers that inspire bad thoughts and behavior (such as the very regrettable ""The Good Son""). ""The Stepfather"" is violent to watch, but you know who the bad guy is, and you know to be afraid of him. B+",1388966400,3,1635,4.992673992673993

It is an autumn morning in Seattle, Washington. Jerry Blake (Terry O'Quinn) lays his suitcase on top of the toilet lid in the bathroom. He is covered in blood. He removes his wedding ring and glasses and throws them in the open suitcase. He gets naked and takes a shower. He has completely shaved off his mustache and beard and puts on his business attire. He smiles at himself in the mirror. He finds a toy and puts it back in the toy box. He goes downstairs and their is blood everywhere at the staircase, the wall and the living room. His wife is dead and so is the child. Jerry picks up the suitcase and leaves out the front door as calm as could be. He whistles a happy tune and walks down the street. On a ferry, he knocks the suitcase purposely into the water.
  One year later, he still has not been caught by the police. Jerry is now involved with another woman, Susan (Shelley Hack) who has a daughter, Stephanie (Jill Schoelen) in Oakridge, Washington.

3889610,5,B002AMVEIS,"I can't recommend this movie enough.  Terry O'Quinn's performance should rank amongst the best of all time in film.  O'Quinn takes this role in what would be a good movie and takes it to another level.  He makes it a masterpiece of any genre.

The Stepfather's only shortcomings are not doing more with the Jerry Blake character.  He is so brilliant that you don't want the movie to end and it leaves you with a strong desire to see more of a backstory.  The film does a good job of explaining what's going on which sets up its scenes effectively.  However, it would've been awesome to see more of O'Quinn, instead of the plot just being set up by references.

Shout Factory does a solid job with the blu ray release.  However, it does not appear to be remastered.  It is pricey, but I felt it was a must for my collection.  It also includes an interesting documentary on the making of the film.

All in all, I'd recommend this to anyone older than 16.  The foul language is minimal.

Rate: 8

8/12: The Stepfather is what we call every single divorced mother's child's worst nightmare. And that was the case in the late 80's. Moreover, it can be thought of as a Bluebeard type of a film. However, the concept of the stepfather is very simple that it worked wonders. Equally so is the idea of a man who would kill to have the most perfect family possible. Perhaps, he just might be the reason why it fell apart. Meanwhile, many have praised Terry O'Quinn's for his performance, but I think several scenes with him throwing temper tantrums are laughably cringeworthy and embarrassingly unrealistic. Nonetheless, he is effective in his role and shines through many times. Speaking of scenes, how about these transitions? One minute, the stepfather politely asks Stephanie to improve her behavior in school. The next thing that happens, she is wrestling with another girl in the art class. Another one is when Jerry asks for more ice cream and Stephanie goes to look for one, then the next thing that happens is that Jerry goes berserk in the basement. Oh, oh...how about that avenging brother? He spends all the time looking for Jerry, and the first minute he sees him, the brother is dead. It's somewhat a throw away subplot there. I enjoy watching Jill Schoelen do her part as the stepdaughter, and she does very well keeping the tension up to the very end. All in all, The Stepfather is a good Hitchcockian thriller.",1346112000,2,1445,4.756972111553785

3889622,4,B002AMVEIS,"Sleeper hit from 1987 (which earned its share of critical kudos as well) boasts a taut script by novelist Donald E. Westlake and a terrific performance from future ""Lost"" star Terry O'Quinn as an unhinged new stepdad to troubled teen Jill Schoelen and mom Shelley Hack. Seems that O'Quinn has a knack of making his way into single-mother households and enjoying the American Dream, at least until his psychotic tendencies manifest themselves!

Effectively directed by genre vet Joseph Ruben, ""The Stepfather"" is a superior genre entry from the mid `80s, with O'Quinn expertly balancing the story's inherent horror with black humor, and the ever-underrated Schoelen making for a sympathetic heroine. Highly entertaining stuff for genre addicts!

Shout!'s Blu-Ray and DVD editions incredibly marked the first domestic releases of ""The Stepfather,"" and neither disappoints: the transfers are both well-composed and are only limited by the film's modest budget, while the mono sound is perfectly acceptable as well. Extras include a half-hour retrospective on the picture boasting comments from Ruben, veteran producer Brian Garfield, Jill Schoelen and others, along with a commentary from the director and the original trailer.

At long last available in the U.S. in a top-notch presentation, ""The Stepfather"" should be on every self-respecting horror fan's shopping list. Forget the remake and check out the original -- it's a definite treat!",1337817600,2,1440,5.4774774774774775

Unfortunately, Jerry has a dark side to him, and only his stepdaughter Stephanie suspects the horrible truth: that ""Jerry"" is actually a serial killer who married widowed or divorced women with kids, plays the happy stepfather for a little while, before something sets him off, prompting him to murder every single one of them and move on to a new family and town after changing his name and appearance. Can Stephanie convince those around her of Jerry's true nature before it's too late for her and her mother? Or will Jerry's cycle of insanity and murder continue?

Much has been said of Terry O'Quinn's powerful performance as Jerry and I have little to add except that I agree he's excellent in the role. His violent moodswings are truly terrifying to behold and yet, when he's calm, he honestly seems like he's trying to be a loving father.

This is an excellent DVD of an even better 1980's thriller chiller. It contains two extras worthy of note: first is an audio commentary featuring director Joseph Ruben and Michael Gingold of Fangoria. It's quite interesting and informative, even if Ruben understandably forgets some of the details of the movie's production.

Next up is a documentary called The Stepfather Chronicles, which covers, in detail, the process of making the movie, including how the screenwriter was inspired by the real-life incident of John List, who, like Jerry Blake, murdered his old family and moved on to a new one. Here, Joseph Ruben tends to impart much of the same information he does on the commentary (including some things verbatim), but it's negligible and everyone else's contribution to the documentary makes up for it, making The Stepfather Chronicles quite interesting to watch.",1313280000,2,1801,4.996666666666667

Then, he must 'take care of them' the way he took care of his last three families before moving on to another new life in a new town. THE STEPFATHER is often mistaken for a common late 80s Slasher, but its finely tuned suspense and minimal gore prove to share much more with the Psychological Thriller. It plays on realistic horrors taken from true crime resources, where the perfect husband next door is hiding a sinister and deadly double life. There are many sharply written moments in the script where the dialog makes reference to Jerry's double nature without tipping any of the characters off to it, while the other family members are handled evenly in order to balance the daughter's suspicion and distrust with the wife's blinding love and comfort. The lack of motivation and explanation into Jerry's background also drives the audience's morbid fascination with the character. The one distracting element of the film is the contrived detective story headed by one of Jerry's victim's brothers, whose presumptuous conclusions are far too scripted to be believable. The aforementioned strengths would mean little were it not for TerryO'Quinn's commanding performance and his ability to snap from the lovable family man to the inescapable madman in a matter of seconds. O'Quinn truly makes the film in what is still one of his strongest performances to date.

The main character is the true EPITOME of evil and it made me sick to think there might be actual people in the world like that character.

The plot of the movie keeps building until the tension finally blows to it maximum thrilling point near the end (you need to watch the movie to see what happens).

3889652,3,B002AMVEIS,"If you decide to watch this movie, I recommend that you don't watch it alone.  Not because it's scary, but because then you won't have anyone to make nutty comments with.

There are two reasons this film is worth watching.

1.  Terry O'Quinn (Locke, of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Lost/dp/B0019LY5IM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Lost</a>&nbsp;fame) is simply a fantastic actor.  His portrayal of the demented stepfather is so spot on, you don't miss or need any of the clunky exposition most modern horrors would include to give you an idea of why he's so messed up in the head.

2.  The rest of the film is unintentionally hilarious.  How so?  Oh, let me count the ways!  (Beware: key plot points are revealed ahead.)

-- O'Quinn's acting is so great, it makes everyone else look like barely credible puppets.
-- O'Quinn's stepfather is a man obsessed with the perfect family, and when his family (like most) proves to be flawed, why he simply murders them and moves on.  The brother of his most recent victim is the only one pursuing him (a year after the fact), and he goes after him with the zeal of a junkie hunting down his next hit.  One wonders why he's in such a rush, when he's waited a full year to go looking for the guy.  Then, when he finally confronts the stepfather, well, you'll see.  It's bloody hilarious.
-- O'Quinn's new stepdaughter absolutely hates him for no apparent reason.  I mean, we all know he's a killer from the first scene of the film, but she seems to suspect him only because it gives the plot some necessary tension.  Taken at face value, she seems to WANT him to be a psychopath.
-- The stepdaughter is so troubled, she has regular visits with a counselor/psychiatrist/psychologist who is so unprofessional, I kept expecting the movie to reveal that he had an inappropriately intimate relationship with the girl.  Not so.  He's just a really crappy doctor.
-- Every once in a while the movie shows characters playfully gadding about in leaves or having humourous fake fights with each other.  These moments are so contrived and fake, they completely void the character development they are meant to portray.
-- There are at least a dozen scenes that add absolutely nothing to the story and are bizarrely placed.  You'll know them when you see them.

Scary?  No.  Fun?  Sure.  One great actor and a bunch of accidental laughs don't make for a spectacular film, but they do add up to a good night with your friends.",1257206400,4,2495,4.866983372921615

I hadn't seen The Stepfather since I rented it on videotape back in the 80's.

3889666,4,B002AMVEIS,"Ah,yes, it's finally here for mass consumption, the original The Stepfather.  I've been waiting for this one for a real long while.  It's been on my top ten list of most wanted movies on DVD(which also included Howard The Duck, Night of the Creeps, and The Monster Squad---all on disc now, YAY).  This is the real deal when it comes to well made, well acted, ORIGINAL, horror cinema.  This is one of the few horror films, which is like Psycho, that is a character driven tale of suspense.  Right from the opening shot the audience is aware that Terry O'Quinn's stepfather AKA Jerry is a real mean customer as he walks over the bloody corpses of his previous family.  The audience is clued into the malevolence the whole film, unlike the characters which is also a staple rule of Hitchcockian suspense.

All the performances in this film are very good but Terry O'Quinn and Jill Schoelen steal the show.  They are both very good and very believable.  O'Quinn creates magic on screen creating a character who is a horrible, he has MURDERED CHILDREN--GASPS, but manages to have the audience on pins and needles when he comes close to getting caught.  The film and performance manages the miracle of subverting his horrible acts and getting us on his side, similar to Norman Bates in Psycho.  Ah, but then there's the teen rebel stepdaughter played by Jill Schoelen.  She manages to get our sympathy too.  And she's also playing a troubled and troublemaking character.  Jill Schoelen has been around the block as far as genre fare goes, and to me she is one of the great beauties to come out of the eighties(Thank you director Joe Ruben for the unnecessary Schoelen nude scene, no matter how brief).  Shelly Hack(Charlie's Angels TV show, Troll) plays Jerry's object of family desire and she shakes and traces of her Charlie's Angels past right away and pulls off the suburban housewife act well.  You really don't want to see her hurt, even though you also stress over Jerry getting caught.

Now this film is frightening, suspensefull, and in some moments very intense, but my favorite thing about it, besides O'Quinn's masterful performance, is the black comedy.  It's so stark and on the money.  This is totally a reaction to the Reagan era of the early 80's.  Jerry wants the perfect family, yard, the picket fence, family dog, ETC.  Sex is not spoke about and not something that is necessary to a marriage but rather a chore.  He's repressed, homicidal, neat, Neo-Con of the scariest Dick Cheney order.  Even the firm he sells houses for as the American Eagle as it's trademark---the eagle also represents a predator which Jerry himself is as well.  The comedy is never too broad, but just right.  It all seems natural and not made out of bits or shctick.  It comes from the situation and the way crazy 'ol Jerry reacts and switches from balls out crazy to smiling family man of the decade.  Terry O'Quinn can not be praised enough for his performance in this film.  He makes the whole thing worth it.  He was born to play this part.  Now I know some of you smarty-pants film students who take everthing you hear in class or read in those nifty books about filmmaking will whine that there's no surprise or suspense in a film where you know who the killer and where the threat is coming from right from the start.  I see, STOP READING THOSE DUMB BOOKS AND ACTUALLYY TRY TO BE CREATIVE FOR ONCE!  It's much harder and way more fun to portray a film with this structure.  It's a master class in how suspense and audience manipulation works.  Hell, if people just created stores for film without thinking about structure, conventions, or necessary contrivances(like having you hero be likeable and perfect, having a twist, three acts, blah, blah, blah) a lot more interesting and memorable films will be made.

Now, this new DVD, the only DVD now that I think of it, has three great special features.  A feature length commentary by director Joseph Ruben, moderated by Fangoria film critic Michael Gingold, a thirty minute retro making of doc, and the film's original theatrical trailer.  The commentary track is good, but a little too dry.  Thankfully, Gingold is there to moderate as Ruben seems to have a very sketchy memory and doesn't remember all the details.  The making of doc is very comprehenssive and features Ruben, one of the story writers, and the producers, but only Jill Scholen shows up to represent the actors.  I really want to hear Terry O'Quinn's thoughts on his iconic character, though maybe he doesn't think it's that iconic now that he has all his Lost fame in view.  Now the thing that really bummed me out about Shout Factory's special edition is the transfer itself.  It's been remastered but the print isn't cleaned up.  There's still visable pops and blemishes all throughout the film.  I really have liked them to clean the print.  It's has a high grain factor as well.  The sequel looks better on disc then the original and that's a damn shame.  Why didn't Joseph Ruben supervise the transfer himself.  I guess there was enough clout attached to this film to remake it but not shell out the cash to properly transfer it o DVD.  I wonder if they will release a Blu Ray where this problem is rectified?  This transfer issue is the only reason this baby doesn't get that fifth star, because the film in general is an easy five star joy ride.

Bottom line, if you're a huge fan of this film the retro doc is a must, the commentary may be skippable, but just having this great horror film on your shelf, despite this not being the ultimate transfer of it, this is a no brainer must buy now type of thing.  Now get to it, or at least do it before you go through with spending ten bucks on the PG-13 watered down remake.",1256428800,3,5743,4.6300692383778435
3889667,5,B002AMVEIS,"i couldn't be happier that this movie has finally found it's way to dvd. one of my all time favorites and what was becoming the ""holy grail"" of movies to find on dvd. the transfer looked good without any obvious ""cleaning up"" of the scenes for dvd. i wish there were a few more special features but i am happy they included ""the stepfather cronicles"" because i love hearing the behind the scenes workings of my favorites. terry o'quinn does an acting tour de force as jerry blake, the stepfather. he so completely inhabits the role that i am suprised and thankful that he was not type cast after this role.i read somewhere one time that his role as the stepfather was a cross between mr. rogers and mark harmon. i can see that. it may not be hamlet or macbeth but it is damn fine acting. jill shoelen is great as the daughter. i am so happy to hear that the dvd release may have brought her back to the conscience of producers and casting directors. this is a great movie that possibly gets a bad rap as ""horror"" or ""slasher"" neither of which it is. it is a great movie about one mans struggle to make his world the way he believes it should be and treating it, and everyone around him, like an ""etch o sketch"" when they inevitably disappoint him. he simply reinvents himself elsewhere and then cleans up the mess at home before embarking on to his new existence. do yourself a favor and watch this movie.",1255910400,30,1405,4.366412213740458

3889669,3,B002AMVEIS,"Long before everyone knew him as John Locke from LOST, Terry O'Quinn turned in one of the most layered and brilliant performances you will ever see in a horror film. The movie itself is rather short (only 85 minutes) and isn't half bad on it's own, but without his interpretation of this serial killer, the movie would have probably fallen a little flat. Now that it is finally available on DVD, I watched it for the first time last night. Overall, it's an enjoyable little suspense flick featuring a killer who has a unique reason for murdering people, but it's O'Quinn's performance that sells it.",1255564800,2,599,4.714285714285714
3889670,2,B002AMVEIS,"This film was based on the List Murders that occurred in my town (Westfield NJ) in '71, I believe. Actually when I say based, I actually mean Loosely based/influenced by. I remember seeing TSF in the theatre as a kid, & thinking it was kinda cheesy. I'll pick it up 'cause I'm curious to see it as an adult. They also produced an (awful/inaccurate) TV movie not long after List was caught, after being on the lam for about 17 years. List was played by actor Robert Blake, ironically. David Caruso (CSI ?) played chief Moran who actually hired me in my law enforcement career. I read recently that the producers of the original film were surprised at how close some of their scenes/story lines, came to pass when List was finally apprehended long after the film was released. Kinda cool. Enjoy the DVD.",1255305600,2,801,4.569444444444445
3889671,5,B002AMVEIS,"Like most of the other reviews, I too found this jem when I turned on the tv to him coming down the stairs, calmly walking past bodies and blood and leaving the house, leaving me to wonder ""Wow, what is this?"" Let me just say, ever since, this has been my favorite movie. I'm lucky enough to have it on VHS, but I am SO HAPPY its finally coming out on DVD. There's no question where I will be on October 13!

I love everything about this movie except Jim Ogilvie and his idiocy. Come on! He KNOWS where Jerry lives, knows what he's done, and STILL gets freaked when he sees him all bloody, thus fumbling with his gun (IN HIS POCKET NO LESS) like a moron. Just watching that part makes me embarrassed for him.

I'm a huge horror movie freak, and seriously, in my opinion, BEST MOVIE EVER! (but I might be prejudiced since I believe this movie got me started on them all,...) This is one of those movies I've seen like, 20 times, and it's still as wonderful as if I was seeing it for the first time.",1254528000,,997,4.160621761658031
3889672,5,B002AMVEIS,I discovered this movie randomly when I bought it on VHS from a video rental store that closed and sold off its inventory back in 1993. It has been one of my all-time favorites ever since. I have seen this countless times and never get tired of it. Part two is excellent also. Usually I end up watching both in one session.,1254182400,,323,4.225806451612903

8359833,4,B002AMVEIS,"Movie review:
I really like The Stepfather (1987). Terry O'Quinn does a fantastic job as playing the creepy Stepfather Jerry Blake. The film opens leaving no doubt that Jerry is completely evil. When we meet Jerry's new family, Susan (recently widowed) and her teenage daughter Stephanie, you genuinely like them. The Stepfather is a great little Thriller, that I never really hear mentioned among horror fans.

I'd definitely recommend The Stepfather to anyone, including my friends who aren't horror fans.

Product review:
The Shout Factory Blu Ray has decent picture and sound quality. The special features include a  26 minute behind the scenes feature, and trailers for all three Stepfather films.",1504569600,,702,5.306306306306307
