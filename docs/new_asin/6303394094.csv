7845644,4,6303394094,"This video is the first in a 10-video set documenting Rock `n' Roll in America.  It's very entertaining and informative.

The video contains interviews from rock stars of all ages, from Little Richard to Mick Jagger, from Art Garfunkel to Tom Petty.  The video also contains numerous clips of historic performances of artist like Muddy Waters, Hank Williams, Elvis Presley, Chuck Berry, and Little Richard.  Probably the most entertaining part of the video is two back-to-back clips of ""Tutti Frutti,"" one by Little Richard, and the other by Pat Boone.  Wow.

The video loosely chronicles the precursors to rock `n roll, such as R&B, some jazz, rockabilly, gospel, and country music.  The best feature of the video is the sheer number of interview clips from the various rock stars, many of whom have great things to say.

The big problem with this video is that there is no overarching commentary to tie things together.  Without any real narration, the video gives a scattered effect.  It doesn't really answer the question as to what exactly led to Rock `n' Roll, and lacks focus.  Also, the interview clips are all edited to give small sound bites.  It would be great to get more of a feeling of a conversation from these artists.

This video is entertaining and can be used for school purposes, but its focus seems to be more on entertainment rather than information.",1102291200,6,1372,4.836909871244635
7845645,5,6303394094,"I teach a high school History of Rock and Roll class.  This video has proven to be a valuable teaching tool.  Volume 1 focuses on the roots or rock: blues, gospel, country and jazz.  Great film of Muddy Waters and Chuck Berry are flanked by commentary by contemporary artists (Eddie Van Halen, Bono, Tina Turner).  Apart from Van Halen using the S*** word once, this is clean fun suitable for high schoolers and perhaps 8th graders.",980985600,13,432,4.644736842105263
