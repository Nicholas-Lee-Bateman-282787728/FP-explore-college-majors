8452213,5,B00513HJ3W,This is one of the best DVD sets on AGENDA 21 I have seen. This is a 8 disk set of various speakers from the Patriot community. The material was put together in 2010 but all the material is current today and can be used as training aids for various Patriot groups.  There are about 3 speeches on each disk of about 45 minutes each that can be used at Patriot gatherings.  One of my favorites is Tom Woods on State Nullifications of unconstitutional Federal laws. This is a good one for the 10th amendment.  I highly recommend this Freedom Action DVD set.,1344297600,,554,4.359223300970874
8452214,5,B00513HJ3W,"The general public receives screened information from the media. This conference exposes information not available from traditional sources. It covers a number of subjects describing how there is a planned process being implemented in America to replace the US constitution as a governing document with a United Nations program that results in loss of liberty and freedom for US citizens. This program is called Agenda 21, sustainable development. When fully implemented it will control every factor needed for humans to survive - air, water, food, health, land, transportation, laws and rules.",1340496000,,594,5.538461538461538
