8348250,5,B001Z2FACU,"For me, this movie is very different than other Holocaust movies, in that it explores the issue of what happened to Jewish spouses of Aryan women. The story itself is based on a true occurrence, and the movie begins with a wake where the widow is tormented by visions of her past in wartime Berlin and shows disapproval at her daughter's choice of a non-Jewish fiance.

The daughter then discovers there is more to her mother's past than she was ever told, and travels to Germany to discover her mother's past. The story is told in flashbacks through reminiscences, and basically focusses on the plight of Aryan women in Berlin whose Jewish husbands have been confined in a place called Rosenstrasse. I won't give too much away, but I must say that for a slow-paced movie, it is quite gripping as we are kept guessing as to the final fate of the Jewish spouses. As for the acting, the characters from the past did an excellent job, their performances were very realistic, and heart-wrenching, especially the actress who plays the main role of Mrs. Fabian Fischer, the Aryan wife. In the present day, the actress who plays the daughter who seeks to unearth her mother's past wasn't very convincing, but all in all the story itself makes up for other flaws in the movie, and it is definitely watchable for the unique plot.",1357776000,,1320,4.665236051502146
