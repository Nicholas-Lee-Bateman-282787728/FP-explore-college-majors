8468467,4,B005ELVC7A,"It's hard to post an overall review for such varying programs.  They were all good.  The one on the Christmas Peace was excellent, though sad.  It's a repackaging of other programs, so it's not comprehensive about the Christmas holiday, though that shouldn't surprise anyone, given the titles and understanding of History channel ""classics"" collections.  To be closer to comprehensive, there'd have to be good material on Christmas customs through the years in various cultures--even a fast survey of the most unique ones would have been good.  It doesn't even give much history on some of the most common customs.  But I still enjoyed it and have recommended it to others.",1451692800,,673,5.072727272727272
8468468,4,B005ELVC7A,Good historical documentaries on Christmas. Wish there was more like this and maybe more in-depth substance to some of the finer points but all-in-all a good summary of the origins of Christmas.,1420243200,2,194,5.09375

8468470,4,B005ELVC7A,"This set of DVDs is exactly what I was looking for - a good overview of the History Channel Christmas shows.  Each disc has about 90 minutes of material.  The fourth disc had no appeal to me personally, but at this price, I really don't mind.  The shows included are:

Christmas Unwrapped: The History of Christmas: Just like the title says, this is about the history of the Christmas holiday.  Thorough and comprehensive for a 45 minute show, it covers everything from pagan Yule celebrations up to modern traditions.  If you've ever seen The History of Halloween that's narrated by Harry Smith, this is from the same folks.

Biography: Santa Claus: A good look at the Santa myth and how it has changed across different cultures and times.

In Search of Christmas: 90 minute show in search of the CHRISTIAN Christmas.  Really only about trying to find the historical truth of the Christian Christmas story.

The Real Story of Christmas:  Sharing some of the same subject matter as Christmas Unwrapped, this show delves into the origins of specific Christmas traditions.  Of the shows on these discs, this one has the best production values.

Modern Marvels: Christmas Tech: Lightweight episode of Modern Marvels that focuses on things like high-tech home Xmas lights and transporting the Rockefeller center tree.

Christmas at War / The Christmas Truce:  Two specials centering on Christmas during wartime.  Not my cup of tea, but it might be yours if you're a military buff.

Overall, these were fun to watch over the Christmas season and I'm sure I'll enjoy watching them again next year.  Most of the videos are 4:3 but I wasn't exactly looking for visual pyrotechnics from this set.  Yes, it's a cash-in for THC, but it's also a lot cheaper than getting these shows separately.",1325030400,16,1782,4.88
