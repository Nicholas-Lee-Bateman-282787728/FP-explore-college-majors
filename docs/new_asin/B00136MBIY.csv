8518083,4,B00136MBIY,"Tony Cuneo's video is a treasure house of Feng Shui information.  Having spent much time studying secret societies, Tony embellishes the Feng Shui with local color.  There is a great deal of information packed into this video and it needs to be watched several times to get everything out of it.  Tony uses the technique of muscle testing to demonstrate the presence or absence of Chi in an area which adds a lot to the presentation.  I use this video in my Feng Shui Classes and have heard nothing but praise from my students for it.",970444800,14,534,4.53125
