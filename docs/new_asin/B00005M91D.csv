7944943,4,B00005M91D,In my opinion the honeymooners is one of the best classic timeless comedies ever made.,1411516800,,86,4.8
7944944,1,B00005M91D,"Wouldn't buy because the list of episodes on the DVD is not listed in description.  The link to IMDB is no longer any good and when I did a seach there, it told me absolutely nothing about what episodes are on this.  Can someone list the lost episodes on Volume 3 if you get a moment?",1294617600,2,284,4.053571428571429
7944945,4,B00005M91D,"I had never seen the Honeymooners until I met my husband.  I thought black and white shows were sooo boring.  Once introduced to the Honeymooners, I became a big fan.  No actors (okay- very few actors) today can hold a candle to the talent of these characters. I love'em.",1278979200,,271,4.489795918367347

7944947,5,B00005M91D,"I'm a big HMer fan and consider the work between these four actors funny, touching and timeless. If you don't like certain episodes, fine; To each his own. I do have to scratch my head about those reviewers who take exception to the picture quality; That the DVD should be clearer than the original VHS releases.  Are they aware that the ""Lost Episodes""

are ""Kinescopes"" and not ""Film"" like the ""Classic 39"". Up until 1957 most  TV sitcoms and all variety shows were broadcast live with no means to record the transmission. (Networks wouldn't  film most shows due to the expense involved.(Multiple cameras,editing, developing etc.) ""Lucy"" was an exception. ) Standard practice was to use a single ""Film"" camera focused on a studio moniter during the actual performance.  This would then be quickly developed and shown several hours later for the west coast.  These resulting ""Moniter films"" are ""Kinescopes ""and they are no where near as clear as film, the images look crammed  into the screen since the film camera was slightly ""zoomed in"" so as not to get the edges of the live moniter. In '57 video tape was introduced and shows that weren't filmed were at least preserved for posterity on videotape. I doubt any modern technology could undo the qualities of a Kinescope. These are treasures from the early TV age.  I personally wouldn't be so picky about the picture quality. These shows are what they are; Great comedy thankfully preserved in a primitive medium. Think of all the shows that weren't Kinescoped. They were seen once and were gone, lost in the ethos of time and space!  Anyway, I'll take Kinescoped Honeymooners over any number of digitally recorded reality shows today.",1156896000,46,1690,4.901754385964912
