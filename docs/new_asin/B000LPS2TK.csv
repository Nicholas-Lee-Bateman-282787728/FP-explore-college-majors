2712264,5,B000LPS2TK,We love watching Deadliest Catch and were excited to buy the first disc set.  We will purchase Season 2 in the near future.  For now we look forward to watching the new episode every week!,1178409600,,188,4.3428571428571425
2712265,3,B000LPS2TK,I didn't see a lot of heavy weather but I expect they couldn't film in that. I was expecting more I guess hollywood style but reality was bad enough. The content was a bit repetitive though. It coulld have been edited to one DVD of about an hour's length.,1178409600,,255,4.224489795918367

The dvd set has 7 hours running time. The content is excellent. The quality of picture (4:3) is average. There are no extras. I bought it for $16 after price drop. Hopefully, I will see new seasons for similar prices. If you are newbee like me about crab fishing world in Alaska, this is an excellent ride to get as close as real experience. The dvd set is oversized, I wish they make it 3-dvd slim pack that could save storage space for us.",1175040000,11,633,5.663157894736842
2712267,5,B000LPS2TK,"As someone who worked in the Alaska commerical fisheries for years, and on crab boats in the Bering Sea out of Dutch Harbor during the early 90s, I really appreciate this series which has given this worthy, but dangerous, occupation the notoriety it deserves.  This was the hardest, most dangerous work I ever did, inclusive of my period of military service, in which several of my friends lost their lives; it is an occupation that all who have participated in can have great pride in.  One point needs to be made, however, which is that conditions are a little safer than they were before with the advent of the quota system which lets boats choose their weather some (although I think the TV producers may be goading fishers to push the limit more than they otherwise would).  Previously it was a free for fall that started on January 15th. A good book to read in conjunction with viewing this series is Spike Walker's ""Working on the Edge.""",1173484800,34,944,4.640718562874252
2712268,5,B000LPS2TK,"The show that Discovery Channel has produced is one of the most ""can't miss"" shows ever, in my opinion.  The drama that has unfolded shows that all reality tv is not rich kids in California, or people ""surviving"" on some island.

Discovery has mad a winner, no doubt.  I'm already waiting for the 3rd season to start.  It seems it's April debut cannot get here soon enough!",1169942400,16,373,4.522388059701493

2712318,5,B000LPS2TK,"Being a reality based show it is hard to script the action and drama that occurs on a crab boat.  Also, the characters that make up the show are compelling.  These are everyday people who are living their lives on a crab boat on the Bering Sea doing the most dangerous job there is; it is compelling to watch.",1371686400,,309,4.220338983050848

2712325,4,B000LPS2TK,"Weird not seeing the Hillstrand brothers or Phil or some of the others we have grown to love, and without the theme music.

2712326,5,B000LPS2TK,"Here is the season that started it all and also captured the end of Derby style fishing. It's an incredible tribute to the fishermen that set the bar for all who followed.  Here also can be found the unsung achievement of the first filmmakers to face this journey.  What an amazing body of work by the cameramen.  They had to figure out how to get the shots, the sound, and the story while keeping themselves alive.

All those involved were truly the founders of an incredible first series. If you're only able to buy one season, this is the one to have.",1368748800,4,554,4.401960784313726

2712329,4,B000LPS2TK,"I love this show, the adrenaline rush that I get from watching these guys work so hard for something we enjoy so much. Watching this has definitely made me more appreciative when I eat crab legs and not complain so much about the price. But I do see what these guys are getting paid by the pound and then see what I am being charged and think that these guys are getting the short end of the stick!",1367798400,,398,4.115384615384615

2712333,4,B000LPS2TK,I am not much of a critic but as far as reality shows go it has to be the least scripted and true to the genre.,1362182400,,111,3.3076923076923075

2712335,3,B000LPS2TK,Okay but not the most fascinating show around.  I know I won't ever eat any kind of crab caught in this fashion so maybe it is bad for their business,1361577600,,149,3.966666666666667
2712336,5,B000LPS2TK,"I like the show because I love the ocean, and enjoy eating crab.
Sometimes I feel sorry for the crabs.  I appreciate them more knowing
how the fishermen risk their lives.  This season is a great introduction.

I notice less profanity than later seasons.  I like less beeps.
It is fun to see the early days of Capt. Sig and Edgar (who seems like he
has a major attitude).

2712338,2,B000LPS2TK,"I have to agree with the rater about snippets.  The show spends way too much time on hype.  It's like a never ending commercial for the show.  Too bad, it could have been interesting....  I don't understand why most seem to believe you have to scream at people to gain interest.  It definitely has the opposite effect on me.  If you want to watch this show, just mute the sound.....",1343520000,,382,4.385714285714286

I slowly grew to like the characters and then I was sucked in.  After Season 3 I realized I wanted to go back and see Season 1.  I looked on Amazon to get Season One.  Using Amazon made it cheap, easy, and convenient to own. I looked at different big box stores, however they did not always have it in stock nor could their price compare to Amazon!

2712351,5,B000LPS2TK,"This is an addicting little series from the Discovery Channel.  The captains have become folk heroes of sorts.  I turned into Martha Stewart one day and she was interviewing Sig Hansen and his brother while cooking a crab dish for them.

No matter how much the crew earns on these crab runs there is not a viewer on the planet who would say their overpaid.  They have sleep depravation, injuries, work cold and wet, bicker amongst themselves, wrestle 700 pound pots and face the real threat of being washed overboard and freezing in the arctic waters but they struggle onward so we can have our appetizer of crab with drawn butter.

Us loyal viewers learn the jargon of the crews and long to learn more of our favorite captains: Blond and handsome Sig Hansen of the Northwestern, acerbic Phil Harris of the Cornelia Marie, the wiley Hillstrand brothers (Johnathan, Andy and Neal) of the Time Bandit.

This is a show that you never lose interest in watching and is well worth your time and money.  I'm going to give this same review to each season.  bg",1233187200,3,1051,4.612903225806452

2712355,5,B000LPS2TK,"DEADLIEST CATCH is one of the most riveting series on TV.

The work alone is incrediblly dangerous and difficult on heaving decks in freezing seas with wind and weather assailing every footstep. The evidence of this lies in the 90 lost souls over the past twenty years of those who ventured to challenge Alaska's Bering Sea.

But the real drama of the series lies in the characters themselves; the Wizard's captain Keith, Jonathan of Time Bandit, the damaged Phil aboard Cornelia Marie (and his sons), Sig and his family on the Northwestern and so many other brave and hearty souls. They become like part of the family as we cheer their victories, grieve their losses and laugh with them in the joy of their work and play. You come to love Jacob, the great-hearted kid on the Cornelia Marie and to see through Jonathan's quirkiness to his heart for his men and his ship. Sig's toughness metls as he reveals the depth of his pain in losing friends and comrades to the Bering Sea.

This series is a brilliant, vivid, dramatic testimony to the ""men who go down to the sea in ships."" May God bless and keep them.",1230768000,8,1108,4.557788944723618

2712358,5,B000LPS2TK,I love Deadliest Catch and I have been a fan since the begining! This is one of the best shows out there! I love Sig on the F/V Northwestern! There is something about this show that makes me want to go up there and work in Alaska. I am very happy with my order!,1217548800,,261,3.8518518518518516

2712360,5,B000LPS2TK,"This is a really fabulous series!  I bought this first season for my father, who saw this show once and was hooked.  My husband is also an avid watcher.  If you enjoy the show, you may also want to check out the book ""Time Bandit"" by the captains Andy and Johnathan Hillstrand.  It was an amazing read!",1215216000,,302,4.245614035087719
2712361,5,B000LPS2TK,"Seeing these episodes in the warm safety of our living room, my neighbors still wonder why men do this.  My wife asks, how can anybody deal with the extreme risk day in and day out?  What ties the crew together?  What are they really like?

She doesn't hear me explain.  After years of marriage sometimes we communicate better without words.  Spoken or written, I still can't seem to break the cognitive barrier between a woman's perceptions in a cozy living room, and the reality of working in Alaska waters.

After a career in the maritime industry having worked on every Alaska harbor over the last 40 plus years, I have to say The Deadliest Catch is tops.  If it can help my landlubber neighbors and friends actually admit that commercial fishing is a high risk venture, the show is coming through.

There is a book called IN THE COMPANY OF FISHERS being sold on Amazon.  It follows a day in the life of Moosemeat John, Alaska's oldest fisherman as he recalls his triumphs, failures, fulfillments, interruptions, loves and losses.  He is from the generation of men that fathered the crew on the Cornelia Marie and the rest of the fleet.  Read the book and you will learn what is in the blood of these men and why the call of the Bering Sea, Gulf of Alaska, Bristol Bay, and Prince William Sound is unshakeable.  Find out how their women feel about their choice.

The show is excellent.  Some people need to know more about the fleet though. The Deadliest Catch might want to spend a little time showing and explaining the vessels.  How/where are they built?  What does it take to run one and keep it in top condition?  Take us to a shipyard and show us one out of the water.  Have a shipwright talk to us about variations in the designs.  -- Wishing You All Smooth Seas and Fair Weather -- Ken Boire",1212969600,4,1803,4.489230769230769

  You get 5 discs, which contain each episode, commercial free.  There are no out takes, deleted scenes, commentary or other goodies that come with a box set.  But that's fine, because look at the price.  I'm happy with it.  Just don't buy it expecting all that other stuff, and you won't go wrong.",1200268800,6,420,4.581081081081081

Well like everyone else, I saw one episode and I was hooked. Those hard working fishermen. Fine! The next time I saw this show in the listings, I said to Spence, ""this is for us!""

2712375,5,B000LPS2TK,"I laugh at all these shows called reality tv, especially the ones like fear factor or even Man vs. Wild.  Safety and backup plans abound with them, and they are subject to extreme editing.  Most of the people on those shows seem pretty fake anyways, extremely plastic style drones with no substance that create petty drama for the camera.

With this series, it is all in your face and very, very real.  People die out here, and people get injured often.  Simply a great film in a documentary style that shows Crab Fishing on Alaska's high seas in all its guts and glory.  Get real, and then get this because the plastic drones you root for on fear factor are nothing more than pre-fab drama queens that would not even begin to know what it takes to work on one of these boats.  A long tradition of fishing the high seas is seen here in the present day, with a good coverage of all the captains, their boats and crews and their will to survive while still finding some fun in their adventurous jobs.",1186185600,8,998,4.391304347826087

2712380,5,B000LPS2TK,"Those of us who have had family members work on the seas will appreciate this real life show better than others. It is not just the excitement of the risks involved, the dangerous weather conditions, or the roughness of the jobs you see on deck, it's much more. You get to watch real people whose worries and hopes you identify with, and you get to love them by learning to respect them in their sacrifices. In Spain there's a vast retired population that watches others work at construction sites and admires how things get done without their help. This maybe a type of voyeurism, but is something like what I felt while watching this series, without the loss of sleep or the sea-sickness. It is awe-inspiring and humbling to watch these men put their lives on the line for the sakes of their families and loved ones.

There is the added interest of a competition taking place among many ships to see who gets the biggest share, a race against time and the natural elements, a psychological study of leadership and gregariousness, and finally it is an ode to the sea, its beauty and ruthless power, with stories of lost lives, sunk ships, faith and superstitions, love and friendship, hardship and memories. The few chapters I saw on tv were captivating, but now that I saw them on dvd I realized there is much more, there are stories of people, and you want to see how they will make it in the next chapter, what choices -if good or bad- they will make. The cynic may think it's just all about money (so the thief thinks everybody is like him) and that these people are not different from anybody else. The gambler doesn't risk his life, he risks his family wealth. These men risk their lives for the welfare of their families.

One cannot but respect every single one of these men. May God bless them, and may their faith grow as their works, for: ""Thus also faith by itself, if it does not have works, is dead. But someone will say, ""You have faith, and I have works."" Show me your faith without your works, and I will show you my faith by my works. You believe that there is one God. You do well. Even the demons believe and tremble!"" (James 2:17-19) How sad it would be to have toiled so much and lose it all for the lack of faith in Jesus Christ as Savior, and even more being fishermen.",1184457600,9,2294,4.42080378250591
