8016519,4,B0001US6SC,"OK cheesy Spanish language, Mexican-made sci-fi adventure.  Blue Demon, a second-string Santo, battles female extraterrestrial invaders who come to Earth to take men back to their home planet.  You conclude the reasons.  All the action is Earthbound.  The quality of the DVD is OK and the cover art is not bad.  Good for Mexican wrestler fans.",1392076800,,343,5.053571428571429
8016520,3,B0001US6SC,"It arrived with a poor quality; I will need to order it again. Great movie featuring a great legend, Blue Demon, He died in 1988; still remembered by the latin and international people who were lucky enough to watch him perform in movies and the ring.",1374537600,,251,4.478260869565218
8016521,4,B0001US6SC,"Sometimes when you're second best you just have to try harder. This goes for masked wrestlers as well as car rental services. From all reports,Blue Demon was a superior wrestler than el Santo but it was the""man in the silver mask"" who became the pop culture icon and the 'demon in the blue mask' always seemed to be playing catch up. Blue Demon vs. Las Invasoras was a film which could stand  next to the best cinematic efforts of Santo. This film co-stars Regina Torne, who played the villianess in the Mil Mascaras movie Los Canallas,  as the leader of a group of alien invaders from space. They are water-breathers from another world who's mission is to kidnap Earthmen to bring back to their planet to repopulate it. It's sort of a distaff 'Mars Needs Women'.Of course there's plenty of wrestling action both in and out of the ring and the actresses playing the invaders are incredibly sexy. It makes you wonder why any of the kidnap victims would want to have been rescued.",1244332800,5,978,4.614942528735632
