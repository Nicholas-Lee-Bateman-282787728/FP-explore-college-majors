3009836,5,B000XVT7SW,"Cavalleria Rusticana and Pagliacci are often called the heavenly twins, but I don't think that's quite true. I'm not sure if Cavalleria is a great opera, but it's certainly a very good one. True, Mascagni does an admirable job of creating a small town atmosphere where privacy is a rare luxury and religion supersedes almost everything, you can practically feel every cobblestone, every whiff of ocean breeze, every drop of holy water in the music, and the score is filled with beautiful, passionate, dazzling melodies. Still, as far as I'm concerned, the opera never exceeds the sum of its parts. Maybe it's because the opera is ALL about flooding the listener with beautiful, passionate, dazzling music, and this comes at the expense of character development and true drama. It's a shame that Mascagni's masterpiece Iris is so seldom performed, and isn't available on DVD. Still, as I said before, Cavalleria Rusticana is quite good. Pagliacci, on the other hand, is a true masterpiece, one of the great treasures of the operatic repertoire. The opera, with its melodic richness, its orchestral inventiveness, and its solid musical characterizations, manages to transcend the tawdriness of the characters, who spend almost the entire opera hurting one another, to the extent that it qualifies as high art. It may well be the greatest short opera ever written.

This DVD presents a pair of films produced in 1968, featuring stellar casts and conducted by Herbert von Karajan, who also directs the film of Pagliacci. The films, like the operas, are good(Cavalleria) and phenomenal(Pagliacci).

The Cavalleria film faces the same central problem as any film of this opera: What to do with all that time devoted to long instrumental passages? Ake Falck, who directs the film, treats these moments like scenes from a movie by Yasujiro Ozu, filling them with shot after static shot of meaningful scenery, from rustic streets to a beautiful and tempestuous shoreline to a towering crucifix. This establishes atmosphere, like the opera the film does a good job of evoking a specific time and place, but it soon grows tiresome, leaving the viewer to concentrate on Mascagni's lovely music, which isn't such a bad thing. The rest of the film is pretty straightforward, like the opera itself, as primitive as the brutal emotions it conveys, with no abstraction whatsoever, no symbolism. The performers carry the film: Fiorenza Cossotto as Santuzza, sympathetic rather than shrewish; Gianfranco Cecchele as Turridu, fiery and handsome(he looks like a cross between Franco Corelli and Roberto Alagna); and Giangiacomo Guelfi as Alfio, the minatory cuckold. This is a fine performance overall, with von Karajan and his orchestra finding just the right moments to elevate the music to a passionate crescendo while easing up and luxuriating in the more passive moments. The film is unspectacular, but it serves as a competent enough overture for the fireworks to come in round two.

With this Pagliacci, von Karajan has produced a fine example of opera on film, his visual technique matching the color, the choreography, the brutal honesty suggested by the music. His use of close-ups illustrates a true affinity for this medium, as does his ability to coax just the right facial expressions from his performers. Speaking of which, the players are ideal. John Vickers has the perfect voice for Canio, with his ability to sing so beautifully but also with venom. Few can match his technique, or his intensity. He percolates with menace almost from the moment he appears onscreen. He is matched in both the singing and acting departments by Raina Kabaivanska, one of von Karajan's favorite sopranos, young and heartbreakingly beautiful here, cold but also passionate, with  both the graceful movements and supple voice of a bird in flight. The way she flits so effortlessly onstage during the play within a play makes me wonder if she was a ballerina in a previous life. It's easy to see why a passionate sort with a raging temper might kill for her. Peter Glossop delivers a knockout prologue, and his Tonio eschews any opportunity for sympathy based on the character's deformity, he plays the hunchback as someone who would be every bit as grotesque even in a perfect body, unashamedly off-putting, mean-spirited and soulless, like the other major players in this fine but unsettling drama. Once again, von Karajan and his forces deliver the goods, driving the music forward with all the ardor and madness of the story's characters.

This isn't the only DVD to feature a pair of films of these two operas. The other, also on Deutsche Grammophon, offers the filmmaking talents of Franco Zefferelli, the conducting talents of Georges Pretre, and the vocal talents of Placido Domingo. It, too, is a marvelous DVD, but I give the edge to this one, primarily for its Pagliacci which is nearly perfect.

Instead of twins, perhaps it is better to look at these two operas as siblings, Cavalleria the sturdy and unassertive one that never quite achieves an individuality of voice, impeccable to be sure when viewed on its own, but overshadowed to a degree when presented side by side with its outlandishly talented brother or sister. Or we could dispense with all this pretentious nonsense and simply say, here we have two operas, one good, one great. Enjoy.",1218844800,8,5336,5.064846416382252

3009840,5,B000XVT7SW,"When I ordered this DVD several weeks ago, I didn't realize that these were filmed, as opposed to live performances of Cav/Pag.  I have a decent live Pagliacci performance (from the Met, paired with Puccini's Il Tabarro), but there don't seem to be any live, staged DVD performances available of Cavalleria Rusticana.  Upon receiving the DVD, I was initially disappointed, because even though the lip-synching is very well done here, I much prefer seeing a staged, live performance to a filmed, on-location presentation such as this.

Nonetheless, this DVD set gets five very favorable stars from me, not only due to the impeccable sound and picture quality of performances from 40 years ago, but primarily because of the acting and singing of a force of nature named Jon Vickers in Pagliacci.

I was not fortunate enough to have seen Mr. Vickers, the Canadian heldentenor, on stage.  I have his Peter Grimes from Covent Garden on DVD, and his performance there is intelligent, nuanced and oftentimes searing in intensity.  In this Pagliacci, his performance is nearly overwhelming:  I don't think I have ever seen such frightening, impassioned, murderous rage on display before in an opera performance, whether filmed or otherwise.  As noted by Mike Birman in yet another of his spot-on Amazon reviews, Mr. Vickers was the full package, ladies and gentlemen -- and I only wish there was a DVD of his Fidelio somewhere out there.

Very, very highly recommended.",1205625600,27,1461,5.054166666666666
3009841,5,B000XVT7SW,"If you are familiar with von Karajan's brilliant 1965 recordings of Cav/Pag that he made in Milan for DGG, two of the finest recordings yet made of this matched pair of one act operas, then you already know of his affinity for these two verismo masterworks. He seems to extract the beauty and power from their gritty melodrama without wallowing in their undeniably tawdry undertones. Most important, von Karajan takes them seriously. He treats them as if they were major works by Verdi or Wagner and not as the sole success of each composer that they in fact are. This makes all the difference in the world. How much more beautiful is Cavalleria Rusticana when the music is played with such lavish sonority and such broadly defined tempos? Von Karajan offered us his best on his 1965 recording and he offers us his best here, in a production that can only be described as lucious, filmed on the island of Sicily in 1968, its images still looking gorgeous after all these years. This film might double as a time-capsule travelogue of Sicily, the ancient home of Phoenicians and Greeks all those millennia ago. The landscape is eternal and von Karajan captures that same ageless quality in this filmed performance. The singing is lip-synched well, allowing the performers to concentrate on their acting. Fiorenza Cossotto was the quintessential  Santuzza of her era, as she shows here. Giangiacomo Guelfi is a strong Alfio. The rest of the cast is uniformly excellent, the recording and film superb.

Jon Vickers was the finest Canio of his time. If you have seen his Peter Grimes, his Otello or his Fidelio, then you know what power and stature he brought to a role. This film of a La Scala stage production breathes fire. Vickers is riveting in his portrayal of Canio. The DVD is worth its price merely for the thrill of watching Vickers' incendiary performance. Raina Kabaivanska as Nedda and Peter Glossop as Tonio hold their own, as do the rest of the cast. But Vickers is the story here, he is stunning! Von Karajan conducts the Orchestra e Coro del Teatro Alla Scala with great beauty and power, but also with great tact, stepping out of the way and letting the singers act the drama. It is a splendid performance.

The full screen films have been remastered and look fine. Sound in both PCM stereo and DTS 5.1 is crystalline in clarity. The usual DGG booklet, menus and translations are here. The total disc time is 148 minutes.

Cav/Pag was a von Karajan specialty and this DVD shows why his reputation was what it was. The performance by Vickers must be experienced at least once, he was the finest male operatic actor of his era. Here are a pair of exemplary films on a DVD that won't gather dust on your shelf. Most strongly recommended.

8230028,4,B000XVT7SW,"We do not lack good video options for the popular Italian double bill, and a viewer can choose from among two 1970s live performances with Domingo in both CAVALLERIA RUSTICANA and PAGLIACCI (one coupling from Tokyo and one from the Met), and Franco Zeffirelli's filmed versions, also with Domingo. All three of those discs have their virtues. The starriest ""non-Domingo"" option at present is this pair of 1960s Unitel films. No cinematic triumphs, their competitive strengths are the conducting and the filmed preservation of two deservedly famous portrayals and several worthwhile ones.

Herbert von Karajan's contemporaneous studio recordings for Deutsche Grammophon feature a slightly different cast in CAV and a very different one in PAG. Here as there, he makes La Scala's orchestra sound like a major symphonic ensemble some years before the Abbado/Muti era, when such virtuosity could be taken for granted. The playing and choral singing offer a combination of color, beauty, grandeur, and power unmatched on the other DVDs, though the Met may have run it a closer race had their broadcast come a little later in James Levine's tenure. Karajan also turns up for a Hitchcock-style cameo as an improbable villager in PAG.

The CAVALLERIA RUSTICANA is purported to have been based on a stage production by the great Giorgio Strehler. I cannot imagine that ke Falck's facsimile of his work pleased him, if he ever saw it. This is, bluntly, inept moviemaking. When the soloists are not singing (as they often are not in a short opera padded with musical interludes), Falck unimaginatively fills the space with scenic shots -- flowers, rocks, a crucifix -- that do not establish atmosphere and are not effectively timed; there is no intrinsic rhythm to them. You may feel as though you are patiently bearing a slide show of a friend's uninteresting trip, but at least you would be able to tell a friend, ""We've had that one already,"" so you wouldn't see the same plant a third time.

Things improve only a little when the people show up. Lip-synching is poor, and the performers tend to be isolated from each another in one-shots. These are neither strong screen actors nor embarrassing ones, so when left to fend for themselves, as seems to be the case, they do not make much of an impression either way. The CAV film's redemption is in Fiorenza Cossotto's immaculately sung Santuzza, captured in fresher voice than for her Tokyo DVD performance with Domingo almost a decade later (there, her physical acting for the live audience is, shall we say, unconstrained). There was a line here, in the scene with Lola, when I thought to myself that she had it all in 1968, if that is the date of recording. The top is so sweet and free, soprano-like, that one might expect the bottom to go dusky -- not so, it is firm and assured. The musicianship with which she manages her considerable means is exacting as usual, and she convinces in acting with the voice, if less so with the face. The performers around Cossotto merit less discussion. The booklet note implies that Gianfranco Cecchele replaced Carlo Bergonzi, the Karajan audio recording's Turiddu, because Bergonzi was ""never the strongest actor."" If so, Cecchele was not an upgrade in that department, and he sings less well, his mere serviceability making the opera seem more a mezzo vehicle than it should. Giangiacomo Guelfi offers a strong, conventional Alfio; Anna di Stasio makes a striking appearance but has a placid, almost nonreactive presence as Mamma Lucia. On the evidence here, she will not grieve Turiddu much after the opera, if the news of his death even sinks in.

The better opera gets the better film in PAGLIACCI. Karajan himself is the credited auteur this time, from a staging by Paul Hager, and his pedestrian direction is more relevant than Falck's. Jon Vickers's Canio, even in this ""canned"" form, acting in a studio and miming to his own recording, is a portrayal of towering greatness. There is no condescension in it; he imbues Canio with all the pathos and anguish that distinguished his Tristan, Peter Grimes, and Otello (the last perhaps the closest parallel, for what is PAGLIACCI but a shorter, trashier OTELLO in which the wife really is guilty?). What Vickers does extremely well has as much to do with management and implication as it does with his roaring magnificently through the final scene. Early on, even when this Canio smiles at the crowd, you know he is not someone to be crossed. There is a brute strength about him, and a sense of menace never far from the surface. Vickers has a better cast around him than does Cossotto above. Raina Kabaivanska, I believe, would become more vocally fluent within this idiom than she is here, but she has a voice to be reckoned with, and her characterful face hints at Nedda's complex personality. Kabaivanska is especially good at the nastiness to Tonio as well as the marital interplay leading to the denouement, the mounting fear, then contempt and defiance, the desperate attempts to get the show-within-the-show back on track. She credibly fuels Vickers's rage. Peter Glossop is seen and heard in a brief prime as Tonio, making the most of opportunities opposite strong partners (he might have done more with the prologue); the ever-scrupulous Rolando Panerai seems a luxury as Silvio. Karajan, like Muti and few other conductors who have recorded the opera, thankfully assigns the famous last line to the ""controlling"" character, the baritone Tonio, as Leoncavallo intended.

The productions, blamelessly ""period"" in their intentions, are unmistakably of their time. For Exhibit A, look to Santuzza's ""'60s fabulous"" wig in CAV. Picture and sound quality hold up well when their age are taken into consideration.",1381536000,3,5753,4.976091476091476
8230029,5,B000XVT7SW,"Jon Vickers! what a brilliant Pagliacci, so different to the others, his rendition shows a great strength of character, Pagliacci in this recording is more of an inner suffering person, brilliant performance, Kabaivanska is her usual marvellous self a totally reliable performer no matter which role she is singing, as for Peter Glossop his Tadeo is terrific he shows up his mean and vindictive side and also his suffering side, he knows very well that he is never going to win over Nedda but he never gives up, his glee when he tells Pagliacci of Nedda's tryst with Silvio is total satisfaction and and revenge. Jon Vickers performance here impressed me so much that I have ordered his DVD of Otello.
Cavalleria Rusticana is a brilliant performance with Fiorenza Cossotto as Santuzza she is a totally  magnificent performer no matter what role she is singing, Cossotto to my mind was the most brilliant mezzo of her era, the tenor Gianfranco Cecchele (where have they been hiding him?) I have never seen or heard him before but judging by his performance as Turiddu I will be looking out for more performances from him, incidentally if you want to see a brilliant performance from Fiorenza Cossotto find her Azucena in Il Trovatore, she will knock your socks off.

Guelfi's transformation from the benign to the frightenly vengeful Alfio is very convincing. What a phenomenal baritone he possessed. Although mezzos with an extension,and in this case a great one,have essayed Santuzza,I am convinced this is truly a soprano role. However Cossotto copes easily with the role even though it is obvious that the upper register is that of a Mezzo. The minor roles are well done with Adriana Martino as Lola using her sexual attributes to the utmost.
Pagliacci is even better. Peter Glossop is very convincing as the villainous Tonio and his Prologue ranks with the best. I have never liked the voice of Jon Vickers with its strange guttural type sound in the middle,but I accept he was a great tenor, and here, he is a convincing Canio and a frightening one in the final scene. Indeed Raina Kabaivanska looks as if she was actually terrified. She looked beautiful and sang beautifully throughout-her scene with Silvio played by the great Rolando Panerai, being particularly touching.
The sets are very well contrived for both operas and give quite an air of realism. While films can never match the live performance,this DVD would be an ideal introduction for someone anxious to get to know this ""Ham and Eggs"" of the operatic world.",1234828800,2,1549,4.805243445692884
8230033,5,B000XVT7SW,"With rare exception, I not a fan of operas made into movies,
preferring filmed live performances. Well...this is that rare
exception! It is, by far, the best version of ""Cavalleria"" I've
ever seen. The cast was exceptionally well chosen; Cossotto,
Cecchele, Guelfi, DiStasio, and Martino were perfectly cast as
Santuzza, Turiddu, Alfio, Mamma Lucia, and Lola.

Although well sung and well acted by the entire cast, this is
Santuzza's story and Fiorenza Cossotto has just nailed the role.
This was filmed in 1968 when Cossotto was about 32, so she was
young enough to look convincing in the close ups. I believe the
singing was dubbed (which bothers some people), but it was so
beautifully sung, I hardly noticed. Just hearing and seeing
Fiorenza Cossotto singing ""Inneggiamo,"" ""Voi lo sapete,"" and
Santuzza's duet with Turiddu is worth the purchase price!

Cecchele is appropriately unsympathetic as Turiddu
(I've always felt Placido Domingo was too much of
a gentleman to play Turiddu convincingly), and Martino
is wonderful as the spiteful  Lola. Di Stasio, as
Mamma Lucia, is perfect...right out of central casting.
Guelfi, too, looks and acts a convincing Alfio...and
what a voice!

Most reviews have concentrated on ""Pagliacci"" and I don't have
much to add. Yes, it was a fabulous performance...how could it
not be with Vickers, Kabaivanska, and Glossop? However, I don't
think ""Pag"" works as well in a movie format. I would have pre-
ferred seeing this extraordinary performance filmed live.",1233446400,,1497,5.1735537190082646
8230034,5,B000XVT7SW,"These are two outstanding and spellbinding performances from the Italian repertory. Each of the major characters possesses the vocal and dramatic skills to capture the strong and violent emotions associated with verismo opera. The outstanding camera work, especially the close-ups, produce an intimacy and pathos that have a mesmerizing impact on the viewer. Both La Scala productions were filmed in Milan under the technical mastery of Herbert von Karajan.

In Mascagni's Cavalleria Rusticana, Fiorenza Cossotto delivers a deeply sympathetic portrayal of the aggrieved and betrayed Santuzza. It's easy to see why she was considered the greatest Italian mezzo-soprano of her time. Gianfranco Cecchele, as the adulterer Turiddu, performs admirably, both vocally and dramatically, and one wonders why he didn't achieve greater recognition in his day. In the role of Alfio, sung by Giangiacomo Guelfi, we see how anger and revenge consume his unsuspecting and gregarious nature. The religious choruses and famous intermezzo provide a temporary relief from the unceasing and escalating tension.

In Leoncavallo's Pagliacci, von Karajan also served as the artistic supervisor, and he demonstrates his fondness and sensitivity for Italian opera. Canio was one of Jon Vickers most celebrated roles. In his rendition of ""Vesti la giubba,"" he depends on his vocal expression and inward anguish to portray his growing rage rather than and outburst of tears. (Incidentally, don't miss his sensitive performance of the disturbed Don Jose, opposite the sensuous Grace Bumbry, in von Karajan's version of Carmen, also filmed in 1968.) Raina Kabaivanska, the Bulgarian soprano, combines her strong vocal and acting skills to portray Nedda. In the enclosed notes of Richard Osborne, her comedy play scene blends ""poise and barely suppressed panic."" Peter Glossop, without the reserve often associated with British singers, offers a lively performance as the deformed and revengeful Tonio. He introduces the famous prologue by holding up a Kabuki-style emotionless white mask. After Nedda whips and rejects him, his face becomes distorted with anger and humiliation.

In addition to the outstanding performances of the main characters in each opera, the Director of Photography, Ernst Wild, and his camera crew deserve to be saluted, especially for their intimate close-ups. For example, in ""A voi tutti salute,"" the viewer can almost taste the wine before Turiddu challenges Alfio to a duel. Even though there productions were filmed 40 years ago, the picture quality is very good and the original stereophonic recording has been converted to surround sound. Even a casual opera listener will find these performances absolutely spellbinding.",1220659200,3,2725,5.5772946859903385
