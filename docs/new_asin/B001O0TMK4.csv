8328655,5,B001O0TMK4,great dvd sets of classic shows,1434844800,,31,4.333333333333333
8328656,1,B001O0TMK4,"I just recieved the video, there was NO TRAIN AT ALL!  The picture shows a golden train,  I would actually been happy with Bertie as another reviewer mentioned, at least my son would have had a toy!  I was so excited when the box arrived, he was tracking the package along with me he opens it after the initial joy, I get the dreaded ""but where's my shiny engine"" question.  I did not enjoy explaining to my 3 year old that he was not going to recieve it.",1412812800,,455,4.136363636363637
8328657,5,B001O0TMK4,My son love it! Fun for any child who loves trains and especially Thomas and Friends,1271808000,,84,4.3125
8328658,5,B001O0TMK4,"Got this for my nephew, he absolutely loves it! This is the second set we've given him, and he watches them all the time! Great way to introduce the kids to Thomas at a reasonable price!",1270512000,,186,4.194444444444445
8328659,4,B001O0TMK4,"Gave it to a Child who really loves Thomas. Glad it's a DVD, won't wear out because he plays it a lot.",1256256000,,102,3.6818181818181817
8328660,4,B001O0TMK4,"Also a birthday gift they love, but Bertie is certainly not a golden wooden Thomas, I guess they ran out, but that's part of what made me get this DVD in the first place, hence the four star rating.  You're not guaranteed a golden Thomas.",1254268800,,238,4.288888888888889
8328661,3,B001O0TMK4,This video didn't come with the gold Thomas as pictured it came with a Bertie. BIG difference!,1252713600,2,94,4.588235294117647
8328662,5,B001O0TMK4,This is a good little set. It comes with a slimline DVD case for the Thomas movie and it has a Golden Thomas which my two year old loves. Thomas is great.,1246233600,2,154,3.84375
