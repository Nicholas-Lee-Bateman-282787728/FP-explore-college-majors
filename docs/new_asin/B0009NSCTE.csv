2302035,1,B0009NSCTE,been on tv before not funny found boring do not like previews instead proper series. I thought it be with actors in the programmes not silly bits of programmes.,1326844800,,160,4.551724137931035
2302036,4,B0009NSCTE,"While not the most comprehensive collection out there, this is a great compilation of some of the funniest people ever to enter into the Brit-com genre. It's not an indepth look into any of their careers or an overabundance of any amount of their time on the screen, but a good glimpse at who are the funniest and best British actors in the Comedy genre. A good watch, but by no means a recap of their work so much as an introduction to who you should be watching more of.",1311120000,,472,4.2555555555555555
2302037,3,B0009NSCTE,"I thought it was going to be an episode for each of the featured men
Instead it is a well done bio with clips from their shows
Happy with my purchase",1286668800,,149,3.838709677419355
2302038,2,B0009NSCTE,"This DVD was a Christmas gift a couple of years back, and I can remember being very disappointed with it. The host was Lenny Henry, who was undoubtedly good in his own show, but lacked timing and delivery, consequently falling flat on this DVD. Second, there were quite a few so-called 'blokes' missing from this special.

Michael Palin- A very talented all around British actor without whom a lot of John Cleese sketches would have failed to function.
Terry Jones- With Palin, director of the successful series 'Ripping Yarns'.
Eric Morecambe & Ernie Wise- How could you have a television special about British comedy and leave out Morecambe & Wise?
Bruce Forsyth- Come one, let's not forget Brucie, he's been sround for longer than many of these poeple.

They mentioned Nigel Hawthorne, but I don't remember seeing much of Paul Eddington in here.",1284854400,4,848,4.923076923076923
2302039,5,B0009NSCTE,"Great DVD!  If you want to know more about some of the funniest men from British Comedy - buy this!  Also, I recommend the female version!",1265760000,,138,4.269230769230769
2302040,2,B0009NSCTE,"The DVD is just a presentation where a speaker talks about different shows of the British Comedy. I was expecting to see a presentation and then the complete shows, but instead they are just small parts (a few seconds) of the mentioned shows.",1173830400,7,242,4.651162790697675
2302041,5,B0009NSCTE,"I watched this when it was on PBS a few months back, in fact, during the show I whipped out my laptop and went to Amazon to search for it.  It wasn't there, but I'm so glad BBC decided to release it.  Hosted by Lenny Henry, it highlights the best of all my favorite British comedy actors, including John Cleese, Richard Briers, and John Inman.  Great purchase, well worth it, will have you remembering all those great moments watching britcoms.",1125446400,23,444,4.525

8063515,3,B0009NSCTE,"I was very disappointed with this purchase. There was too much commentary and not enough ""funny"" - I should have read the description more carefully.",1475712000,,149,5.0

8063517,5,B0009NSCTE,needed to add to my british collection,1439596800,,38,4.571428571428571
8063518,4,B0009NSCTE,Enjoyable. Was not aware of this title before seeing it on Amazon. All the family enjoyed it,1420588800,,92,4.470588235294118
8063519,2,B0009NSCTE,"I guess Ronnie Barker as the grocer Arkwright couldn't be included because of the lisp, but no one was laughing at the lisp itself. It was just another set up for wonderful misunderstandings and plays on words. Peter Sellers, also, would easily have outclassed some of these others who were featured. This opportunity was not fully realized. Far from it.",1403308800,,354,4.916666666666667
8063520,2,B0009NSCTE,"While the interviews were fine, this DVD is an obvious attempt to garner even more money from unsuspecting dupes like me while simply replaying very short scenes that are on the original sitcoms. If you've seen the full versions you will see nothing new.",1368057600,,254,4.795454545454546
8063521,5,B0009NSCTE,"The Funny Blokes of British Comedy is a nicely done dvd tribute to the men of British comedy. This dvd is filled with interviews, clips from the shows, and fun information. A must have to watch again and again. Be sure to pick up the companion dvd The Funny Ladies of British Comedy as well as Behind the Britcoms: From Script to Screen to round out your collection.",1350777600,,366,4.397058823529412
8063522,5,B0009NSCTE,It is amazing how little we know about our great British comedians.  I did not know that several were in college and left to do comedy.  I'm gllad they did.  This cd give an insight to these great gentlemen.,1350000000,,207,4.256410256410256
8063523,1,B0009NSCTE,"Not funny at all just a lot of talking,the lady's one was better.
We kept that one and had to donate the other one. The Men's one is a waste of money.",1344211200,,150,3.71875
