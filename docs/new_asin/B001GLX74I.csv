3614988,2,B001GLX74I,"""No point asking when it is,
No point asking who's to go,
No point asking what's the game,

-Iron Maiden

That statement could be applied to this movie. For the most part, it just felt like a collection of deleted scenes (animated ones, of course) from the 2nd Star Wars prequel.

SHORT ATTENTION SPAN SUMMARY:

1. Anakin is a Jedi
2. Ahsoka is a Padawan
3. They both are stuck with each other
4. The audience suffers from a cliche overload
5. Anakin has to train Ahsoka to be a Jedi
6. They first get their both mission
7. The mission is to save Jabba The Hutt's son
8. They embark on the mission
9. ...they shouldn't have even tried.

To me, the whole concept was over in the first 30 minutes. I honestly have mixed feelings about this: On one hand, this has good action scenes, and good music, but on the other hand, bad dialogue and a very thin storyline spoil the broth. I'm also NOT sure what to say about the animation. It's like looking at a painting with poo smeared in some spots. It's easy to look at, yet it's hard to enjoy when you can't take your eyes off the poo.

It seems as if they replaced a good storyline with bad dialogue and ADD-infused jump cuts. Overall, this would work as a TV pilot, but not as a movie.",1224374400,12,1262,4.219917012448133

3614992,3,B001GLX74I,"I remember getting this at a closing sale at a local Blockbuster. As it is said in the headline of this review, this movie is not an actual Star Wars movie. It's more of an extended version of an episode of the show of the same name. But it still has a decent story compared to the others, no matter how clich it is, with great animation. The original cast of the prequel trilogy isn't present here (mostly, at least.) You can just watch the trailer to know what all happens, and, honestly, you can just not watch it at all and still not miss a thing in the canon storyline. I'm pretty sure this movie isn't even canon. I'm not saying it's a bad movie, but it isn't like the originals or the prequels or the new trilogy or Rogue One. You can still watch it, but don't expect a good movie, and don't say I didn't warn you.",1496016000,,821,4.1375

3615010,4,B001GLX74I,"As a fan of Star Wars overall, I've read many of the books from the now non Canon expanded universe, and the prequel films were ok, the main trilogy remains a classic and I kinda dig the new Rebels series and was amazed by Force Awakens.  The Clone Wars series was something I watched occasionally but never had time to watch it.  I have the box set now and making my way through it.

This film sets the stage for the series and while it's not perfect it's still very entertaining and it holds your attention with the action as well as the character dynamics and politics.  Not bad for a cartoon show for kids.

I love how this film and each episode of the series kicks things off with a montage of images with a voiceover bringing people up to speed on what is going on, much like a wartime newsreel.

You are invested in the characters even though in the back of your mind you already know that things are going to end badly for a lot of them given what we know from Episode 3 and so on.

The sight of seeing our heroes onboard star destroyers with an army of storm troopers is a bit weird a tad unsettling.

But it is still awesome seeing Anakin in his element as someone who clearly cares about the lives of his men and about living on the edge in the heat of battle.  The relationship he forges with Ahsoka is a bit prickly at first, the disrespectful little know it all snot that is teamed up with a brash and somewhat overconfident warrior.

Its a great pilot film, and as a lead in to the rest of the series it sets up what the series is all about... Showcasing the wider scope of the war and the various people involved.  Its an epic space opera, which is exactly what star wars is meant to be but this series takes that concept and pushes it further.

Highly recommended",1468972800,,1780,4.218289085545723

3615039,4,B001GLX74I,"-- A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away...

I got to see The Clone Wars at a special Lucasfilm premiere event. It was a pretty big deal, and they had a special display area set up at the Presidio offices with original, concept art and maquettes, which are like concept sculptures. Unfortunately, we weren't allowed to take pictures, so I don't have any to show you. However, we got lunch in Star Wars lunch boxes created specially for the event. My friend didn't want his, so he gave it to me. I'd show you a picture of the lunch boxes, but they're in storage somewhere, and I'm not going to go dig around for them right now.

I'm not sure how widespread this information is, but one of the things we were let in on at the event is that the movie actually started out as individual episodes of the series. It was the first story arc. If you pay attention and are familiar enough with the series, you can actually see how the movie breaks down into its constituent episodes. On the one hand, I think launching the TV series with a movie was a great idea; however, I think they probably would have done better to have actually developed a movie rather than to string the several episodes together into a movie.

Which is not to say I didn't like it, because I enjoyed it very much, but the general response to the movie was a little underwhelming and I think part of the reason for that is that it didn't play like a movie. Because it wasn't.

The other failure of the movie was to involve the offspring of Jabba the Hutt. I think that's something people didn't want to look at. One, they don't want to see slug babies and, two, they don't want to view Jabba with any kind of sympathetic light. It's hard not to have sympathy for a parent who just wants his kid back. Personally, I found it an interesting take on Jabba, but I can see how it could cause people difficulty.

All of that said, the movie opens with a tremendous battle scene between the clones and the droids. It's, in a word, spectacular. The movement is very much like a video game, say Battlefront, and it's almost worth the whole movie just for that battle scene.

Also, this is where we're introduced to Ahsoka Tano, so the movie is essential from that standpoint. Anakin doesn't want a Padawan, but they send him one, anyway. A plot between Yoda and Obi-Wan, though they don't admit to it. He's set to get rid of her until he has to work with her during the battle, at which point he changes his mind. His comment to her is something like, ""You wouldn't have made it as Obi-Wan's apprentice but, as mine, you just might work.""

There are some other significant elements as well.

Anakin faces off against Dooku. The Anakin vs Dooku dynamic is important not just in the series but in the movie mythos as a whole. Anakin has to rise above Darth Tyranus in order to become Darth Vader, so it's always interesting to see how that relationship develops.
There is this incredible vertical battle between the clones and the droids during which the tanks walk up the face of a cliff. I know it's animated, but it's amazing.
Anakin comes by his ship, the Twilight.

Basically, the movie serves to set up all the essential elements for the ongoing television series. It's not that you can't watch the series without having seen the movie, but the movie helps, especially for the dynamic between Ahsoka and Anakin. I think, also, if the approach to the movie is that of watching several episodes of the series back-to-back that it becomes much more satisfying. It's all in the frame of reference.

It's not, by any stretch, the best story arc in the series or, even, the best story arc in season one; however, it possibly does have the best battle scenes. I'm not remembering anything more epic than the one the movie opens with, at any rate. It's a solid arc, and it ought to be included in anyone's watching of the series.",1435881600,,3886,4.4299719887955185

3615057,4,B001GLX74I,"This film is essentially a feature-length pilot episode for the computer animated series of the same name, which went on to run for six seasons and in my humble opinion, was the best thing to happen to Star Wars film/television since the days of the original trilogy. However, it must be said that this movie is a rough beginning. The animation is not as good as what the show later developed, and some of material is a bit forgettable. Be that as it may, this version of Star Wars is not only better written and acted (animation + voices) than the prequel films, but gets back closer to the feel of the classic films. In that sense, this is a gateway worth jumping through. In particular, this film features the first appearance of Ahsoka Tano, who enters the saga a young kid but grows into a truly terrific character over the course of the Clone Wars arc.

One condition that is very important, though: This item is not worth $19.99, let alone more than that. It is a single film, less than two hours in length.

There were some negative reviews of this movie, that it was an afterthought.  Maybe my expectations were low as a result, but my family thought it was great.  It was necessary to set up the TV series, especially the main characters.",1421539200,4,552,4.405940594059406

This movie is a great introduction to the TV series and is just as good as the much acclaimed TV series in fact.  The animation is wonderful as is the voice acting.  Very enjoyable and looks and sounds fantastic on blu ray.  This has to rank up there with the best Star Wars movies ever released, because to be honest the 6 live action movies are all fairly weak as storylines go, in fact they are the 6 weakest story lines in the entire Star Wars canon.  The quality of the 6 live action movies ranges from very poor to above average at best.  I enjoyed this movie much more than any of the live action movies.  They really should have done every movie animated.  Star Wars just translates better to animation than it does to live action.  Well Star Wars translates better to novels, comics, and video games then it does to live action movies and anything else.  Don't listen to the critics, buy this movie and enjoy.",1416700800,,1022,4.446236559139785

3615070,1,B001GLX74I,"Star Wars: The Clone Wars is a 2008 American computer-animated space opera film that takes place within the Star Wars saga, leading into the TV series of the same name produced by Lucasfilm. The film is set during the three-year time period between the films Attack of the Clones and Revenge of the Sith. Distributed by Warner Bros. Pictures, which also holds the home media distribution rights to both this film and the TV series, the film premiered on August 10, 2008 at the Grauman's Egyptian Theatre, while screening in wide-release on August 14, 2008 across Australia, and August 15 in the United States, Canada and the United Kingdom. The Clone Wars was an introduction to the television series of the same name, which debuted on October 3, 2008.

The film received a largely negative response from critics but was a moderate success at the box office, earning over $14 million in its opening weekend and continuing to earn over $60 million worldwide. A major marketing campaign included toys, fast food, and comic books.

The beginning of this Film thrusts us into to a great action scene and introduces to a slew of characters with little to know introduction,further into the Film the plot gets a little more interesting when presents the core plot. Things get even more intriguing when we finally start seeing some of the characters we expect to see earlier in the film,i became extremely jaded by the time of the final act even though the closing moments were not that bad,but really predictable.

one plus for the film is that it lacks the the campy dialogue of George Lucas,however the voice acting is really boring and unoriginal.
Character development and chemistry or other big issues in this film,we are introduced to a bunch of new of new characters one of which plays a major role and the character do not get a chance to develop or learn anything intriguing about them as well as their origins.

The characters are a little Anime like and most them are quite good,but the overall animation is lacking. Lucas wanted this film not resemble Pixars The Incredibles because he wants it to be more stylized,i commend his out the box attitude on this,but if you do not want to copy a look you should definitely improve on it,the Animators fall short one that one here,however the action scenes look good.

The Music in the film does not live up the franchise standards,but there are a few unique and likable tunes here,overall The Music is decent throughout.

Star Wars:The Clone Wars is one of the worst films i have seen this year and it had me wishing more of the original Cast of was here to save this dull film. The Script is not up to franchise standards and it is obvious to see the film was made to be a Bung for the TV series it leads to,it is big disappointment for hard core Fans. The best thing that could be said about the film is that it is Child-friendly but  it is the Superman 4 of the franchise,it has bad Animation,repetitive action scenes and the attempts at humor are fruitless. People thought the Star Wars prequels were flawed,they are,but this is a train wreck.",1413504000,,3098,4.673394495412844

Ahsoka Tano makes this movie, and the series is launched, worth watching. Despite all of the complaints about the series (many of which are valid), and the dark direction it took toward the end -- it is ALL worth it, because it is also the story of Ahsoka Tano, in addition to Anakin Skywalker, and that makes it AWESOME.

While I sort of like the girl Jedi Knight in training, she looked like she came out of ancient Egypt--was that on purpose? The film was poorly rendered and looked too much like a video game. Not impressive. Thin on character development, poorly written. It simply needed to be thought through better. The baby Hutt was cute and lent a reason for the whole plot, yet the film lacked a stronger motivation that. The film was too long and seemed to exist purely for the battles. This takes place before The Revenge of the Sith. Did Anakin kill her when he killed all those young padawans? Who knows? It really could have been better.",1393113600,,722,4.4772727272727275

3615103,3,B001GLX74I,"Having first seen this in the theaters I can attest that the film experience was less than spectacular.  In light of expectations (high) it is probably better than most people (including myself) give it credit for, but not by that much.

This adventure, that finds Anakin Skywalker being paired up with his new Padawan Ahsoka Tano, lacks the compelling emotional characters that can make a fantasy film fun or great.  I think that Anakin here is better than Hayden Christensen's version when speaking of emotional depth and characterization but he's still not the engendering of a hero at this point and the Kenobi mentors Skywalker mentors Tano balancing act, while not hindering the characters, just falls flat and that's too bad because that's where this film could have been really fun and moving toward good (rather than just okay).  As it often seems Obi Wan Kenobi is given the ability to be the emotional and mental balance of the film and his poised confidence remains the nucleus around what all of the other characters can look to and draw from (Ahsoka is fine as the new Padawan, not irritating or ingratiating, and you do root for her but she's not allowed to develop into her own).

My main complaint with the movie is that I find the Hutts an irritating lot, whether it's Rotta (Jabba's sluggy offspring) or Ziro (who sounded like a wheezy Isabel Sanford from the Jeffersons).  Still, it has been good to see LucasFilm expand its franchise as this has spun into the almost excellent television series.

Since then,Disney has bought the brand. My kids have grown up to love Star Wars. I now can look at this movie in a different light. It is a pretty good move. It is so much better than Episodes 1-3. It reenforces the fact to let Lucas come up with the idea, but someone else needs to write the story and direct the story.

3615169,5,B001GLX74I,"Star Wars: The Clone Wars is a lighter dose of the Star Wars universe, in that it's a cartoonish CGI film that is made for the kids, but adults can enjoy it as well. It's fun to see all of the familiars, but without the hard-edged evil from a Count Dooku or even Anakin. Here, Anakin takes a Padawan learner under his wing, and throw in some good humor from the supporting cast, and what you get is an hour and a half of an enjoyable kid flick. Yes, there's violence, but this is Star Wars, so it's inevitable. The plot is somewhat strange (Jabba's son kidnapped) but that's okay; it's neat to see what the writers do to expand the boundaries of their imaginations. I thought the voices were done well and were pretty much on par with the original actors from the 6 movies.

I was looking for ways to get him into one of my passions, so I started buying the Clone Wars TV series, and after a few episodes, realized I should watch the movie before going further. I was definitely not disappointed with my purchase.

Pros: Lots of adventure and action, but without any gore. It sets the stage nicely for the series coming after, which is full of good lessons for kids.

Cons: It is definitely geared toward children, so that may be an issue for some. It also is probably best for an introduction into the series, as opposed to a stand alone movie.",1331251200,,699,4.320610687022901
3615175,1,B001GLX74I,"I consider this to be the MOST DISAPPOINTING INSTALLMENT in the Star Wars series.  Myself being an adult in my late 20s, saw this in the theater with an adult friend in his late 20s, naturally.  And I must say it was extremely awkward that we weren't actually 5 year olds there with our moms or dads.  THIS MOVIE IS AIMED AT SMALL CHILDEREN, with simple minds that have simple thoughts.  I'm sure some will argue with that, so as a straw-man argument I will mention their case about the new tag-a-long padawan assigned to Anakin.  She's targeted at 8 year old girls.  So there you have it.  If you are a 3 year old of either sex or an 8 year old girl buy this movie.  1/5 stars.

ICING ON THE CAKE:  there is no grandiose musical, scrolling text scene at the begining of the movie!  totally falls out of line with how the other movies start.

If you want to bridge the gap between Episode II and Episdoe III I suggest the Clone Wars cartoons that were aired on Cartoon Network between 2003 and 2006.  They are aimed more at adults as it was part of the adult swim line up for those years.

3615176,4,B001GLX74I,"As summer feature animations go, this offers a lot to like. Brave good guys, treacherous bad guys, cute and earnest young female lead, a strong parenthood theme, hissing evil female character, and exciting fight scenes. There's plenty of amusing banter between two characters thrown less-than-willingly into the fray together, and victory and feel-goodism at the end. The visual styling works, too. Characters have a chiseled, iconic quality that makes me think of hand carved medieval marionettes, a pleasing bit of anachronism in this far-future setting.

As a contribution to the Star Wars canon, I can't give it such high marks - but at least it doesn't have a Jar-Jar in it. My one disappointment was the robots. Until now, R2D2, C3PO, and their kind have always been non-combatants. They've been in the fray, but only in supporting roles. Seeing them in shooting roles took some of the shine off their metal skins, at least for me.

I'm sure the True Believers among the Star Wars loyalists will spend vast time and effort moaning over it. I kind of like this one, for itself, but I don't think it's worth getting worked up over, not in either direction.

To be sure, it's not great, but it's not horrible. The plot is pretty ridiculous - Jabba's son is kidnapped and the Jedi must rescue him (really, the same Jabba who had Han frozen in Carbonite?). However, the animation is pretty good overall. It's not Pixar, but it does look like Star Wars.

There isn't much character development - Clone Wars is mostly an action film. Despite that, I really do like the relationship between Anakin and his new padawan, Ashoka Tano. Ashoka is a brilliant character whose wisecracking ways fits Anakin perfectly. Obi-Wan isn't as much of a presence, but he gets a fun scene near the beginning. Amidala only plays a small but important role near the end.

It came with a Clone Wars comic book in full color along with the movie.  The book was shrink wrapped to the outside of the box.  It is the same dimensions of the DVD case and as thick or a little thicker.  Very well drawn and a neat story.

The movie was fun to watch.  I saw every Star Wars movie in the theater from the beginning, yeah I am that old.  I played with all the toys, and I even teared up a little when R2 hit the screen in the Phantom Menace and it had been 20 years since I had seen him on the large screen.  But I don't know what planet wookies are from off the top of my head.  I just like Star Wars but I don't know all the history.

I loved this movie and purchased Season 1 to follow up the movie.  The movie has a lot of familar faces and some new ones that were really cool.  Was really well drawn in a Samurai Jack style but not so outlandish, and the story was real smooth and fun to watch even for an old guy like me.

Sure, maybe kids will like it, in the sense that kids like a lot of trash, you can show kids other better things and they'll still like them.

2008 / 98 min. / Rated PG

Let me make this clear; I am an unabashed Star Wars geek. I have seen all six films in the theater multiple times; I've also owned all those films multiple times on multiple formats over the years; I own the two volumes of the Cartoon Network's Clone Wars DVDs and yes, I even own the two made-for-TV Ewok adventures. Not to mention, I own some magazines, books, T-shirts, some posters and a couple of toys here or there. Suffice it to say, I'm a big fan who knows more than they really should about a fictional universe. For me, the original Star Wars trilogy, Episodes IV through VI, is the epitome of film trilogies and will never be equaled or surpassed. Furthermore, as a six-part whole, it's undoubtedly my favorite movie franchise of all time. Yes, I'm not ashamed to admit it; I truly enjoy the prequels, as well. So, it should come as no surprise that if you slap Star Wars on something, I'm bound to give it a go, and Star Wars: The Clone Wars is no exception to the rule.

Heading in, I practically knew nothing about the film other than the fact that it takes place in between Episodes II and III. Essentially, this film is an introduction to the television series that will debut later this fall on TNT and the Cartoon Network. So, let me make this abundantly clear before I continue, this film doesn't add anything of any substance to the previous set of films nor is it essential viewing. However, with that said, the film does supply enough of a quick fix to pacify most Star Wars junkies.

First off, this film should in no way be compared to any of the much superior live-action films that preceded it. This film - which is essentially a glorified pilot episode for the upcoming TV series - is a whole new ball of wax. Directed by Dave Filoni, The Clone Wars predominately centers around Anakin Skywalker (Matt Lanter) and his new padawan learner Ahsoka Tano (Ashley Eckstein) who find themselves on a mission to save the son of Jabba the Hutt (Kevin Michael Richardson) and return him to the Tatooine crime lord. Count Dooku (Christopher Lee) and his sinister minions, including Asajj Ventress (Nika Futterman), will stop at nothing to ensure that Anakin and Ahsoka fail at their quest. Right off the bat, the one thing that instantly hits the viewer is the oddity that a Star Wars film begins with the Warner Bros. logo as opposed to the typical 20th Century Fox logo, as well as the lack of John Williams' famous musical score and the equally famous opening scroll. Being the geek that I am, I was surely a bit bummed that no one in the entre film uttered the words, ""I got a bad feeling about this"". But as I said, this isn't the live-action films, and perhaps it's unfair to have had such expectations. This is its own beast.

Now, much has been discussed about the look of the film and while the CGI animation is far from being on the level of Pixar or DreamWorks, the animation still had a fittingly - and charmingly - throwback type of feel to it. In fact, I ended up digging the look much more than I thought I would. The action scenes, in particular, are actually handled quite well, as they are plentiful and often exciting. It would have been even grander had it been accompanied by John Williams' musical score, but I digress ...

Admittedly, after a bumpy intro, I was surprised the film started to click with me despite the empty and mostly juvenile dialogue exchanges between Skywalker and Ahsoka. So much more substantive dialogue could've been extracted from their unlikely pairing but alas, it was not meant to be - at least, not yet. Not to mention, I would've also liked to have seen more Yoda (Tom Kane), more Mace Windu (Samuel L. Jackson), and yes, even more Obi-Wan Kenobi. The latter is actually well-voiced by James Arnold Taylor who often sounds like Ewan McGregor! Thankfully, I'm sure I'll get much more of these characters later this year.

On a side note, I should mention that I did find it odd that there are certain elements of the film that certainly skew toward an older audience while other elements (mostly, the attempts at humor) try to cater to the kiddie crowd. That's always a tough balancing act, and The Clone Wars certainly struggles with that throughout the film. With that said, young boys will probably be the film's biggest fans, and despite the flaws, adults will - at worst - think its 'OK'.

For me - as a die hard Star Wars fan - this animated excursion frequently put a smile on my face with its lively action sequences, familiar characters and its sense of old school fun. Unexpectedly, the film did manage to conjure up some of that old Star Wars nostalgia. Spotty dialogue and Ziro the Hutt notwithstanding, Star Wars: The Clone Wars is a pretty entertaining movie for what it is and it has certainly piqued my interest for the upcoming TV series which at the end of the day, was the whole point behind this film. So, overall, my admittedly biased rating is *** (out of 4 stars)

By watching them in sequence, it saves the best (the originals) for last.  So I decided to go ahead and buy the Clone Wars movie and season 1.  This CGI animated movie seems like a cross between the dry episodes 1 & 2 and the later more relaxed, and better, final episodes.  So I say its good, but not great.  The animation style takes a few minutes to get used to, but it well done with fluid movements and action.

This movie is best seen as an introduction to the TV series, as others have noted.  I started watching TV season 1 the same day as I watched the movie and, wow, now we're talking!  The TV season 1 is awesome!  Fast past, good stories, lots of action, good dialogue, and I think the animation has been tweeked a bit to give it a better overall look than the Clone Wars movie.  I think it may be the use of light and shawdow effects, something looks a better.  If your going to get the TV series, get this as a 'prequel' - 'nuf said.",1304035200,,1063,4.0625

I go to warner bros support site to see whats up, and it states it was only for a limited time after initial release, and code is expired.  I sent them an email about it.  They should compete with their competitors or not all on these digital copies.  Their helpsite also stated that the expiration date of the digital copy is clearly stated on the exterior of the packaging!!  No ITS NOT.  only after you open it and on the inside only (at least on the one I bought).  Ridiculous.

3615201,4,B001GLX74I,"I scrambled to see this movie when it first came out in theaters.  I was a little disappointed, perhaps I had set my expectations too high?  The other day I picked up Clone Wars on Blu-ray just to add to my Star Wars collection and I'm glad I did!  I gave this movie another watch-through and I greatly enjoyed it!

One thing I think I like about the animated series of Clone Wars is that it introduces a whole new generation to Star Wars.  My dad and I bonded over the original 3 Star Wars movies, then you had the 3 prequels, and now you have a cartoon series that an even younger generation can get into.  The whole story of Star Wars is pretty much politically based, but this cartoon dumbs that down to a level that children can understand better.  I've also found it to be quite educational (God I remember when education was the last thing on my mind when watching Star Wars...)

To me, the only downside to Clone Wars is that it is slightly more childish in nature and it is animated.  However, I think this movie is a great way to continue Episode II.  I'll be honest, I prefer this movie over The Phantom Menace.  Great action scenes and the characters are well written.  This movie has led to me watching the tv series of Clone Wars as well.

If you are a Star Wars fan, I would suggest picking this up.  Maybe its not perfect for the older crowd, but I think a younger audience would truly enjoy this.  Do yourself a favor, if you do purchase Clone Wars, get the Blu-ray.  It has awesome extras and it is just such good quality.

In my opinion it's way better than episodes 1&2 combined, even though they weren't really as great as 3-6. I never saw it in theaters, I just caught an episode of the series on Cartoon Network, so I decided to give it a shot, not to mention that the blu ray was like $5. I've already ordered season 1 on blu ray and plan on getting season 2. There's plenty of action and humor. The battle droids had me cracking up.

While there are those elements they aren't anywhere as bad as the movies.
Granted the Asokha (sic) is fairly annoying she couldn't hold a candle to whiny Anikan.
I was reluctant to get it due to the various complaints I had heard. I felt I would be lost if I got the series and didn't have the movie.
What I found is that the themes that carry through all the Star Wars franchise are here. The whinny kid apprentice is the main one I was afraid of.
Makes me wonder how George really feels about teens and pre-teens. I'm aware that the movie had a fairly heavy hand of Lucas involved. I also know that as the series progressed he wasn't as involved.

And ""Clone Wars"" broadens our perception of thhe time in between.
Jabba the Hutt's son has been kidnapped and Jabba is demanding that the Jedi return him if the Republic wants passage through Hutt space.  So Yoda sends Obi-Wan to negotiate with Jabba and Anakin with new Padawan learner, Asokha, are sent to retrieve the Huttling.  Of course, appearances aren't what they seem as Asajj Ventress and Count Dooku are behind the kidnapping: all to achieve passage through Hutt Space and ruin the Republic.
The visual effects are superb, but this is Star Wars, did you expect anything less?  Although animated, there is plenty of action--lightsabers, blasters, large armored tanks, etc.--that is given great treatment.  The battles are intense, and you don't hover too much on the fact that the movie is animated and not real life.  The characters are beautifully stylized.  The voice actors should be applauded for their admirable work.  And the reappearance of Sam Jackson, Anthonoy Daniels, and Christopher Lee are a welcome treat (particularly Lee since his character never had much screen-time).
About the biggest problem I have is with the character of Asokha.  She is the typical teenager, the Mary Sue.  She knows more than her Padawan status allows, teases Anakin like she is a veteran, wields her lightsaber well enough to defeat three Magna Guards singlehandedly, and has far too few imperfect moments.  I really wanted to like Asokha, but after seeing the above, I could do no more than groan.
Another problem is the weak storyline.  It is contrived for the sole purpose of displaying the gorgeous and well-done battle sequences.  I have a hard time believing that the Hutt space is that critical to the war effort.
Overall, Star Wars fans will enjoy this much more than the average audience and even then, I do not think the quality of this movie compares with the Clone Wars animated shorts.  I would probably give this a 3.5 stars, but since Amazon doesn't allow this, I will round down to 3.  If you want to watch, I would suggest waiting until it comes on DVD.

3615213,4,B001GLX74I,"I thought maybe because this story was created & approved by George Lucas that it would maintain the same quality and character as, say, the Motion Picture Films.  Well, I was wrong.  It is obviously geared towards a younger crowd, and I thought the story was very weak.

It's ok that this movie is targeting 10-14 yr olds, I don't have a real problem with that.  But I was expecting it to contain loads of back-story and a nice filler between Episodes II and III, primarily focusing on the Clone Wars on a large scale.  It did not deliver in this regard.  Instead, some stupid alien padawan-learner girl was the main focal point, and she was not entertaining.

She did, however, hold her lightsaber backwards (like the dude from The Force Unleashed game) which I thought was pretty bad-ass.  And the dude that did the Obi-wan voice for this movie did a good job.  He sounded like Ewan McGregor which helped ease the pain of the corny dialogue and childish references.  Graphics were good too.

3615217,2,B001GLX74I,"Boy, LucasArts sure did drop the ball with this one.

The premise -- creatively, I mean -- couldn't be beat:  exploring the Star Wars universe by means of digital cartoons!  What promise!  This frees the creators from having to depend on the aging (and mortal) faces and voices of actors like Mark Hamill and Alec Guiness.  They had at their disposal the means of churning out an endless series of movies freed of many of the fetters that so famously plagued George Lucas in 1976-7.

Unfortunately, when it came time to select the theme for this inaugural outing somebody saw fit to choose the well worn ""Hey, girls can too!""

Argghghghhgh.  Several problems with this:

1.  It's already been done!  Think about Leia as the spunky princess in Episode IV!
2.  Admittedly, there might be a certain percentage of Star Wars buffs that are interested in such a theme, but they're certainly a negligible minority:  most Star Wars nuts are guys and, owing to the violence and science-fictiony aspects of the genre, always will be!  It doesn't matter how many Gloria Gaynors you cram into these films, you're simply not going to make little girls interested in them, and more than you're going to make little boys interested in playing with Barbies merely because you give her a Jeep to drive!

Thus in the end, LucasArts with this outing let down their fans (again), and fumbled the opening kick in what could have been a remunerative genre for them.",1283904000,2,1443,4.738955823293173

I left the theater wondering whyt he hell I just paid to watch a short story with no revealations.  It was in truth a intro to the Cartoon Network series which you can pick any episode and expand it to create this movie.  Simply its just an episode and not really a movie.  It just takes a long time to watch.  The animation is substandard.  Worth buying to add to the collection...nothing more.  Series is better.",1283644800,2,686,4.459677419354839

3615220,2,B001GLX74I,"The Clone Wars ""microseries"" created for the Cartoon Network have a noble simplicity to them - they are short and crudely animated, but they are fun and full of energy and adventure.  Most importantly, they ""feel"" like Star Wars stories.  I've only seen a few of the shows from the regular series, but they too are fast-paced, action-packed, and generally a lot of fun to watch.  Unfortunately, this movie, which bridges the microseries with the regular series, is a placeholder, uninteresting, and even cringe-worthy in parts.

Intellectually, I can't tell what the problem is with the movie.  Perhaps it's because it IS a movie - the writers/directors/producers of the show are used to 22-minute slots.  Instead of coming up with a deeper story to fill out the longer length, they simply add in more effects sequences.  How many times do we really want to watch Clone troopers (who all look the same) battling droids (that all look the same) in ruined cities (that all look the same)?  The screenplay isn't much better - there is a minimum of information exchange, and some very cringe-inducing ""banter"" between Anakin and his padawan.  At least the battledroids have some nifty one-liners, as does General Greivous.  When Clone Wars works, it's showing us stuff we've never seen before (e.g. commando teams of Clones infiltrating behind enemy lines).

Do yourself a favour - skip this and buy any of the TV series.  I think even small children will find the series (and the actual live action films, for that matter) more enjoyable than this film.

The extras don't give much extra for the Star Wars fan either.  There are recording sessions, and it's always interesting to see what the voice actors look like.  There are also some deleted scenes and a director's commentary.  But ultimately the film rests on the fact that we're seeing Clones vs. Droids again and again, and I just can't accept that of all the evil plots Darth Sidius could come up with to try and gain control of the universe, his best was kidnapping Jabba the Hutt's son.",1281571200,7,2044,4.830459770114943

3615224,5,B001GLX74I,"Over the years I have seen every single Star Wars film in the movie theater, even the special editions during the nineties, and I can honestly say that I enjoyed them all. But when I saw that they made a  Clone Wars CGI animated movie, I thought to myself, ""Why bother?"" So as it goes I didn't bother to see that one in the theater. Recently I began watching all of the old films again starting with episode one to see how well they hold up (I still love 'em.) and so it was that I wanted even more Star Wars to entertain me and soon I decided that I would give The Clone Wars a try.

The movie takes place between episodes 2 and 3 and has some familiar characters such as Anakin Skywalker, Obi-Wan Kenobi, Count Dooku, Mace Windu, General Grievous, Senator Palpatine, C-3PO, R2-D2, and Jabba The Hutt. The plot involves the kidnapping of Jabba The Hutt's Son by Dooku and his gang in an attempt to lay the blame on the Jedis in order to cause the Hutt's to join the separatist's movement against the Republic.

Upon it's release the movie received many negative reviews some of which compared it to a Saturday Morning Cartoon, which to be honest, it basically is. And of course there is now the Clone Wars TV show that followed it now airing on TV. Yet despite all of that, I still enjoyed the movie a lot. It had it's moments and I really enjoyed the excellent CGI animation and thought the battles and spaceships and scenery and characters and lightsaber fights were all very well done. The only downside that I can think of is the character  Ahsoka Tano, who is a Padawan to Anakin Skywalker. She's an okay character and has some good scenes in the movie, but she's a little too cutesy for my liking. Plus, I have to agree with some previous critic's opinions that it seems a little strange to have Anakin mentoring a Padawan, especially when you know a lot of his history in the prequels. Otherwise, it's a very cool Saturday Morning CGI cartoon movie.

I noticed a lot of bad reviews for this movie and I can understand why a lot of people would be turned off by it, but I am not one of them. I can look at this as being a whole different part of the Star Wars universe and enjoy it for what it is. A whole new chapter of CGI animated stories for children to enjoy, and also older teens and adults who still have their inner child within them. I have to admit that my inner child liked The Clone Wars movie a lot and now looks forward to viewing The Clone Wars animated series.",1276473600,4,2483,4.297008547008547
3615225,3,B001GLX74I,"This movie has some good points, such as the animation, and some bad points, like the lack of intro into the story.  This movie was made to introduce the Cartoon Network series Star Wars: The Clone Wars, and that is what it does.  If you like the cartoon series you will want to watch this movie, but it doesn't seem strong enough to me to be a stand alone movie like the original six movies.  It is more like a longer version of the cartoon series.  In my opinion it was not meant to be part of the story of the original six movies, but a side story.",1269993600,,551,4.074074074074074

3615227,3,B001GLX74I,"Reviews for this movie seem to fall into two distinct categories, the five-star 'my six-year-old loves it' category and the one-star 'this is the biggest pile of rubbish ever made and George Lucas should be tarred and feathered for allowing it to see the light of day' category. I fall squarely in the middle on this one. Is it the greatest Star Wars film ever made? Absolutely not. Is it the biggest pile of rubbish ever? Not really.

It just is what it is--a modestly budgeted feature length cartoon designed to appeal to viewers, primarily male, under the age of 12. The animation technique is visually engaging and the story line is somewhat simplistic with fairly predictable plot twists. But taken in the spirit with which it is intended, it does work and it does do more than stitch one battle sequence to the next.

This film was never intended to be on par with the six live action Star Wars films that preceded it, nor was it intended as a season blockbuster. Although it was a theatrical release, Star Wars: The Clone Wars was really just a pilot for a TV series that was already in the process of being made. The idea of kicking the series off with a feature film was almost an afterthought. Although it performed only modestly at the box office, Lucasfilm and Warner deemed it a success in that it met their expectations. It should be noted that this film's release through Warner instead of Fox had nothing to do with its quality. It was a Warner project from the 'git-go'. The Clone Wars TV series was being produced for Cartoon Network, which is owned by Warner; therefore, it stands to reason that Warner would release the feature film.

If you can avoid having unrealistic expectations about this film, you will probably be able to enjoy it for what it is without disappointment, anger, or resentment over what it isn't.",1267747200,2,1838,4.631901840490798
3615228,4,B001GLX74I,"There are stories for children that a person can enjoy them in both childhood and adulthood.  Examples: Harry Potter, the Twilight Saga, X-Men, and, of course, Star Wars.  However, there are also stories that a person can love as a child, but when they grow up, they look back on and wonder just why the heck they liked it.  Star Wars: Clone Wars (the movie) is unfortunately one of those.  In fact, it's the only Star Wars project I'm aware of that I, as an adult, thought was so silly I couldn't really enjoy it.

 Star Wars: Clone Wars is pure action.  It lacks the interesting characters, interesting character interactions (father/son like Obi-Wan/Anakin; romances like Anakin/Padme or Han/Leia; master/servant dynamics like Sidious/Vader or Obi-wan/Luke), the more religious and philosophical undertones the Jedi often refer to; ideas about corruption and redemption; they're all absent, replaced by constant battle scenes.

 The movie also introduces Ahsoka Tano, a 14-year old that's obviously supposed to act as a Mary-Sue for all the children watching to see themselves in.  She's inexperienced and desperate to prove herself yet somehow keeps managing to save the day, all while giving people cutsie nicknames and throwing out witty phrases that weren't actually very witty.  The movie humor was all Jar-Jar Binks humor, jokes purely for children that not only weren't funny, but mostly didn't make any sense.

 However, just because this movie wasn't for me, doesn't mean it isn't any good.  The show has good acting, beautiful visuals, awesome action sequences, and as I said above, the kind of humor little kids really like.  Action fans will probably also like it because the battles are so exciting and well animated.

 And though I doubt I'll watch the movie again, as a Star Wars fan, I'm glad I watched it because there were some things I liked.  As a big fan of Padme Amidala, I loved watching her get her very own action and strategy sequences.  Also, the movie introduces a lot of very interesting and cool characters (various clones and he villain Ventress, for example) that get better development in the Clone Wars series (the series, thankfully, returns to be accessible to both children and adults).  The girl in me has to admit the Huttling was pretty cute, and it was fun to see the softer side of Jabba.  And the action really was great.

 If you're a young Star Wars fan, check it out.  If you're an adult, go ahead if you have to see everything Star Wars, but rent it first.  Two-and-a-half stars for me, four stars overall.",1265241600,2,2556,4.874709976798144

The acting also varies in this picture. While Hayden Christensen was bad in his two, the guy providing Anakin's voice in this is pretty good but some deliveries are flat and and unconvincing. James Arnold Taylor provides the voice of Obi-Wan who actually captures the character very well. Christopher Lee, Samuel L. Jackson and Anthony Daniels return to voice their characters though I hope Daniels and Jackson were well paid for about five minutes worth of dialog. I am glad though that Dooku is in it more but all he pretty much does is stand in front of Jabba the Hutt for the whole picture. The new character Ashoka voiced by Ashley Eckstein is annoying! I wish they never gave Skywalker a Padawan; she dress inappropriately for a Jedi apprentice, I hate the way she handles her lightsaber and I hate those stupid nicknames they give each other (though I am grateful that she doesn't call him SkyGuy hardly at all in the series). All in all it delivers but if I were Lucas, I wouldn't have put this in theatres to make a quick buck.

3615235,1,B001GLX74I,"To put this in perspective,I have always been the one to defend the prequels after it became trendy to criticize them but I have to draw the line at this particular cinematic travesty.

At best, the storyline reads like amateur fan fiction but to be fair, it has potential to keep small children occupied for a while. The action sequences were reasonably entertaining but unfortunately, I was too distracted by the painful dialogue to thoroughly enjoy them. If a movie that bears the iconic name of ""Star Wars"" has a need for comic relief, it could not come from a much more ridiculous source than assembly-line droids whose programming should not include personality of any sort, much less slow-witted ineptitude.
But the annoyance of the droids pales in comparison to that of the character of the young Padawan ""Ahsoka Tano"". From the word 'go', this alien brat exhibits an attitude that should have got her drop-kicked out of Jedi College a long time ago (in a galaxy far away). Her consistent backtalk and unwillingness to follow orders is difficult to picture being tolerated in any military organization but somehow she is given a free pass by the Jedi masters, and recalcitrant pre-teen girls will probably also find her quite inspiring. If 'The Clone wars' were an AT-AT walker, Ahsoko would be the snowspeeder tow-cable that brought it to its knees and crashed it.

For any true and long-term fan of the Star Wars franchise, this movie is worth its weight in Rancor droppings. For the writers of this animated insult, perhaps Vader could suspend Boba Fetts ""no disintegrations"" restriction...",1258675200,8,1601,4.947955390334572

Visually, the movie looks great but some of the characters are very poorly written. The main female character is a brat and the female villain is inept, so the writers need more character development as well as story development.

What I could not understand, is how the Republic (the good guys) are trying to win the favor of Jabba the Hutt, who was one of the villains in Return of the Jedi. In Jedi, Jabba was bad guy who wanted Han Solo dead or alive, and had no problems throwing the good guys in monster-infested traps but here, he is a giant lump who has resources that both the Jedi and Sith want to win their side of the war. I can understand how the Jedi might want to try to negotiate but the point of being a villain is to do bad things. It would make more sense if Count Dooku was trying to take over Jabba's resources by force and the Jedi tried to prevent that, but alas, in the end, it is only a kids movie.

BEN: Yes, I was once a Jedi Knight the same as your father.

LEIA: General Kenobi, years ago you served my father in the clone wars.

These quotes lit a fire under our curiosity, and it burned for nearly 30 years.  Now the excitement and anticipation can be satisfied by...

...the further adventures of little orphan Annie!

CLONE WARS boasts exciting space dogfights and intense light saber duels.  But these things do not make up for where it fails miserably.  Nowhere in this movie do we see the echoes of the great stories hinted in A NEW HOPE.  Nowhere do we see a camaraderie develop between Bail Organa (""years ago you served my father"") and Obi-Wan Kenobi.

Since 20th Century Fox did not release this film (can't say I blame them), the movie opens with the Warner Brothers logo and without the signature Alfred Newman prelude.  There is no written prologue that retreats into the distance of space.  The animation is rather wooden.  This would have been acceptable had the film been made by a studio with a more limited budget.  But it was made by George Lucas who has money coming out of his ears!  Financially, there is no reason why THE POLAR EXPRESS should look better than CLONE WARS.  But even VEGGIE TALES looks better than CLONE WARS.

The plot of CLONE WARS is that the Jedi are summoned to rescue Jabba the Hutt's kidnapped son.  That is the plot of the movie called CLONE WARS.  Can someone please enlighten me as to what that has to do with the Clone Wars?

Jabba junior who inherits the nickname,""Stinky"" is much more annoying than ewoks and Jar Jar Binks put together.  There is even an utterly failed attempt at humor by pointing out that Junior the Hutt made a poopie.  (No, I am not making that up.)  Which, incidentally, is how we arrive at his cute nickname.  Jabba the Hutt's uncle plays a role in the film as well.  Ziro the Hutt does nothing to add to the entertainment value of this heap except to make the viewer wonder whether or not he was based on Truman Capote, for there is an uncanny resemblance.

The music in CLONE WARS almost never sounds like any of the scores composed by John Williams.  Sometimes it sounded like a rock band and sometimes like classical Chinese folk music.

I'm sick and tired of people defending ewoks and Jar Jar Binks by saying it's in there to appeal to the kids.  Where have you been the last 30 years?  It's STAR WARS!  The name alone has kid-appeal and always has.  It has more kid appeal than Fess Parker's Davy Crockett, for crying out loud.  And it had it long before an ewok ever scratched his ear or a Gungan ever ruined a movie.  You might as well complain about Sesame Street not having enough kid appeal.

In a word: Stinky.",1251504000,19,2738,4.4757085020242915
3615247,4,B001GLX74I,"My nephew on my wife's side is an amazingly nifty kid who's also (like me) a huge Star Wars fan. And this past June, he picked out my birthday present from my wife's sister -- the special-edition DVD of last year's ""Clone Wars"" CGI animated film. You remember it, right? The one that got torn a new sphincter by pretty much every critic in Christendom? (Rotten Tomatoes has it at a mind-numbingly excoriative 19%, the same composite score they give to legendary bomb ""Ishtar."")

I will admit that I avoided seeing ""Clone Wars"" last summer when I was in the States on holiday, pretty much entirely because of those damning reviews. Previously, I had seen every single Star Wars film in the theatre at least once; having done so was a point of nerd pride and a touchstone to some of the most magical cinematic moments of my childhood, so avoiding this one was not insignificant for me.

But now I owned the silly thing, and fondness for my nephew, as well as my sense of gift-recipient honor, required that I actually watch it. So I did. And now, having seen it, I have to ask:

Why does everyone hate this film so vehemently? I came in expecting to be deeply disappointed (I am a Star Wars aficionado from way back), and yet I really enjoyed the heck out of the movie. It's briskly and sensibly plotted, packed with pleasing cliffhanger action and supercool Errol Flynnesque lightsaber duels, and relatively pretty to look at -- the color palettes if nothing else are gorgeous.

I'll admit that the animation is occasionally stiff and/or awkward, but hardly always: the action scenes have lovely flow and dynamism (I'm not an animator, but I do enjoy animated cinema in general). And yeah, not all the original actors from the live-action films are back, but frankly, some of the voice actors in ""Clone Wars"" are way better than their non-virtual counterparts (Hayden Christensen, I'm looking in your monotone direction).

I had an enormous lot of fun watching it; more than anything, it reminded me of Bioware's ""Knights of the Old Republic"" computer games in its prettiness and bang-on Star Wars sensawunda.

So why do so many people vituperate ""Clone Wars""? How many actually saw it? Because I gotta say, as a Star Wars otaku I was absurdly pleasantly surprised. In fact, I'm going to watch it again soon.",1248998400,,2307,4.712158808933003

There are deleted scenes, and even scenes from episodes in season 1! (Not to mention a few from season 2!) I reccommend this to all fans of Star Wars!",1248912000,2,604,4.2155172413793105
3615249,2,B001GLX74I,"I remember when I first heard about Star Wars The Clone Wars last, and I was both intrigued and skeptical.  It turns out that there were good reasons for both.  I grew up when the Star Wars Droids cartoon showed up on Saturday mornings, and I remembered how it was difficult to translate the epic nature of the movies into animation.  In some ways, that challenge is still there today in spite of advances in graphic capabilities through CGI and other techniques.

It seems clear that Lucas is targeting children with The Clone Wars movie and animated series because the rendering of many of the characters is rather, well, cartoonish.  The characters where this is most obvious are Count Dooku, Yoda, and Obi-Wan Kenobi.  If the target audience was older, we would see a different style either along the lines of the Marvel Comics animated series such as X-Men and Spiderman or something in the Manga/Anime genre.  The latter would also be any interesting tie in to the more Easter themes that underlie the Star Wars mythology.

In addition to the visual differences, the story for The Clone Wars also seems to come up short of the Star Wars standard.  I think there are a few reasons for this.  It is about 45 minutes shorter than Episodes II and III that envelope the timeline of The Clone Wars.  The plot is fairly simple in that Jabba the Hut's son has been kidnapped.  Obi-Wan is dispatched to negotiate a treaty, and Anakin and his new pupil Ahsoka are sent to rescue Jabba's son.  There is little doubt who is behind the kidnapping based on what we already know happens prior to and after The Clone Wars.  The limitations seem to hamstring the story, and it plays out more like an episode of Scooby Doo.  There are some decent battle scenes, but overall, the story will leave most die-hard fans wanting more.

The characters come out as a mixed bag.  The new characters are hit and miss.  Ahsoka is actually pretty well done.  Assigned by Yoda to be Anakin's pupil, she acts in many ways as a mirror to him.  She is young and brash and even reckless.  The dynamic between her and Anakin really works.  Anakin, however, is not the only one who now has an understudy.  Dooku now has an apprentace in Asajj Ventress.  Unfortunately, she comes off as a rather inept Sith.  However, the biggest character disappointment of The Clone Wars is Obi-Wan.  In addition to being hard to look at visually, the voice job by James Arnold Taylor really comes up short.  While the other characters who have different voices are close enough, there is little doubt that someone else is pinch hitting for Ewan McGregor.  Of all the characters to get wrong, how could Lucas expect fans to accept this version of Obi-Wan?

All that being said, I expect kids will absolutely love The Clone Wars, and they are the true target audience anyway.

The special features were a bright spot.  It was interesting to hear the director and producer explain what they were trying to accomplish with both the movie and the animated series.  The music for The Clone Wars is pretty well done, and I liked learning how it came to be.  Other features include the complete webisodes and trailers.  The total of the special features comes in around an hour, and again, these are fairly well done.  However they are also likely to be lost on the target audience, i.e. children.  If you are getting this for the kids, you're probably better off with the single disk edition.

Much of the movie are scenes with clone troopers and battle droids blasting each other.  We're given some very old characters such as Jabba the Hutt and Yoda.  Anakin though has lost his character, but Obi-Wan, even though he's voiced by James Arnold Taylor in this movie, he sounds a lot like Ewan McGregor.  Christopher Lee is back as Count Dooku, and Samuel L. Jackson as Mace Windu.  The movie is a lead-in to the new series on Cartoon Network, but it's a great movie.  I don't like Ziro the Hutt though.

3615253,2,B001GLX74I,"If this new animated Clone Wars movie is to kick start a series that bridges the gap between episodes 2 and 3, then there are already some major continuity flaws. First of all, assuming the feature film happens right after episode 2, the main characters (Anakin and Obi Wan) already have their Episode 3 hairstyles, which is not believable. How did Obi Wan lose his mullet so quickly? How did Anakin's hair get so long so fast? Their hair should progress into these new styles over the 3 year period, not overnight. Secondly, Anakin is no longer a Padawan and now has a Padawan of his own. Excuse me? The story doesn't even deal with the issue of facing the trials or being promoted to the rank of Jedi Knight. Again, it just sort of happens overnight. Thirdly, Grievous comes right out (in the TV series, not the feature) with no real exposition. Asajj Ventress is in the feature, and has had prior run ins with Anakin and Obi Wan, based on the dialogue exchange in the film. When did this happen? As far as I'm concerned, the cartoon micro-series from 2003/2005 was superior in taking it's time with logical plot / character development, especially season 2 which led directly into Episode III. By itself, though, this new clone wars is very entertaining and well done.",1243468800,6,1271,4.628318584070796

Set between Episodes Two and Three, the film sheds light on events involving some of the most impressive Jedi knights such as Obi-Wan Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker, while introducing Ahsoka Tano, Anakin's first Padawan.

Frankly, I sort of wish Lucas had stopped with the three original films which I think are classic and wonderful. The three newer live-action films left a lot to be desired, I felt, but my boys adore them all just as much if not more than the old Luke/Leia/Han movies I grew up with. With the boys it's all about the action, and The Clone Wars delivers. We saw the preview to this film in the movie theater, and our whole family of four almost jumped out of our seats. How cool! A neat looking cartoon version of the mythical clone wars starring my favorite character, the awesome Obi Wan. Of course, we went out  to see it on its opening day (along with some other families with Star Wars boys) and the kids adored everything about it. My view was that it was neat-o, for sure, but clearly not made for adults. Let's be real, this movie is positioned as the set-up to a new cartoon television series, so it basically seems like a slightly long episode of a tv cartoon. But I like the look of the series with its vivid interplanetary settings and way-cool battle sequences. And being able to see Jedi in action is an overdue pleasure. However, questions are raised which are impossible to answer. I, for one, can not relate to the character of Anakin as a mentor to a youngling since I know that one day he's going to cold-bloodedly murder a whole temple full of them. My kids even asked me if Anakin is going to kill his padawan one day. Yikes!

I had heard reviews both good and bad so I was curious to see what direction the Star Wars franchise was going was going. I was pleasantly surprised to see how good this movie was. I was throughly entertained from beginning to end. IS this as good as Episode 4 - A New Hope which I have literally seen over 1,000 times, no or episode 3 - Revenge of the Sith which I have seen dozens of times, no. but I have watched it several times and it is no doubt now a valuable part of my DVD collection (Star Wars & not). The only drawback to buying the single DVD box is that there aren't any behind the scenes, making of, etc. footage. Just a preview for The Clone Wars cartoon series on Cartoon Network that plays after you first install the DVD and the movie itself. Some bonus features would have been nice. The movie also comes with a coupon inside which entitles the owner of the DVD to a free digital download of the movie but you have to own a Windows PC and I was disappointed that this digital download was not available for download onto my Macintosh and/or itunes which means it can''t be transfered to my iPod which In my opinion makes the free digital download worthless.

My kids love this so I've seen it quite a few times.  I am confused about what age group they are creating this for.  Sometimes, there is death, self sacrifice and other pretty heavy duty topics, and then the battle droids play up the comedy to the 3 year old level...

It had good special effects, nice intertwining plotlines, it filled in some blank spaces in the rich canvas of this generation-spanning series, and it was a plain and simple fine piece of imaginative tale-telling. The criticism I've heard is that it panders to a younger audience, and the voices aren't the original actors (do YOU wanna shell out fifty times more money for the on-screen stars?), and some people even said it's inauthentically canonical since it lacked the 20th Century Fox opening credits! Hey, whatever, it's your viewing experience, as for me I say so it's not sci-fi a la Tolstoy and yeah I can see how hard-core purists might kick but you know, I enjoyed this flick and I'm not going to rag on it.

The story follows the typical father/son Lucas path (what is with George and his daddy issues?), this time with Jabba the Hutt losing his slimy newborn. Anakin Skywalker and his new Jedi apprentice are sent to rescue the Huttlet as Obi-Wan Kenobi chats with Jabba.

Some of the dialogue is overdone or badly planned (for example, Obi-Wan assures his droid that ""...I'm sure Jabba will be in a good mood"" despite the fact that Jabba has recently lost his son!) and some characters remain wooden (Mace Windu badly needs a personality) but there is enough eye-candy and energy to keep viewers interested.

Kids will probably enjoy the film and possibly those who are really young kids at heart.  I personally look to a film for plot, character development, theme, and cinematics.

3615278,4,B001GLX74I,"Fanyboys aside, there is a big discrepancy in the quality of the Star Wars films directed by Lucas and the Star Wars films directed by others.  I give him all the credit in the world for the idea, but Lucas doesn't seem to be the best person to tell his own story.  I really enjoyed the Clone Wars 3D animated movie as well as the series to the point where I think it's superior to AT LEAST half of Episodes 1-6.  Episodes 4 (being superior) and episodes 5 and POSSIBLY 3 being the only ones that can even compete with EITHER of the animated Cartoon Network Clone Wars series.

The reason why this newest film and the two series are so good is because of the fact that the focus is on STORY and CHARACTER rather than spectacle or effects.  Hey, I like seeing ""real people"" onscreen too, but I give credit where credit is due.

I DO tip my hat to Lucas for many reasons, though.  First, he is confident enough with his brilliant original concept to let other talented people extend it to a degree that HE couldn't have even imagined. Not everyone is that humble.  Second, much of the technology in digital film making was pioneered by Lucas.  A lot of the early work in 3D animation and digital editing was pioneered by a division of LucasFilm that eventually became Pixar.  Nonlinear editing was also a brainchild of Lucasfilm in the form of EditDroid.  Nowadays, there are very few films that don't edit non-linearly or use some kind of effects work pioneered by Lucas' company (even if not by Lucas himself).  Lucas is a mediocre (at best) director, but is a GREAT producer and has some GREAT concepts.

The Clone Wars movie and two series are excellent and are not exclusively for kids (in almost EVERY other part of the world animation is not viewed as just for kids as it is in America). Wake up, folks, animation is just another form of film making, another tool to tell a story. No one would say that drawing in charcoals is ""serious art"", but ""painting in pastels and oils is for kids!"".  Great film making is in the generation and deft handling of CONTENT!",1232841600,,2065,4.457446808510638

I really liked the series, so I figured that the movie should be at least as good as the series, and it is. This movie and the series really adds to the star wars universe in a way that you couldn't do in live action. With the success of the movie and series, I really think that Lucas could add to star wars by making Episode VII, VIII, IX in this 3D cartoon format. I read a script from someone online that was written for those episodes, and I think this would be the perfect way to bring back Luke, Han, and Laya. He wrote it himself, and the story was great. Anyway, this movie and the series are great additions to the Star Wars Universe.

I purchased this mainly for my 3 1/2 year old who absolutely loves all things Star Wars (much like his father!) and my expectations were that it was going to be a fun movie that doesn't take itself seriously. I was not disappointed and ended up loving the movie and the entirely new chapter of the Star Wars saga that is virtually limitless.  While the characters don't engage in strong philosophical or intellectual debate, they do show some depth and do a good job of fitting into what we have come to expect from Star Wars dialogue - in fact, in some ways, it's even better than the prequels. The story is good for all audiences and the action is very fast-paced and engaging. Plus, the visuals on Blu Ray just make it that much more of  a treat.

Yes, our beloved Star Wars is getting older with the years, but that doesn't mean we can't accept change that is meant to catapult our obsession to a new generation of viewers. The time frame in the Star Wars universe is  one that is ripe for some intriguing stories and action-packed adventures, exploring characters and places that we have long wondered about.

3615295,5,B001GLX74I,"The Star Wars motion picture saga told the story of one Anakin Skywalker.  The Clone Wars is here to tell the stories of other Jedi and of the clones.  To a lesser extent, The Clone Wars fills in the gaps and answers some of the many questions the motion pictures failed to explain. As someone who has been a fan of the saga since day one in May 1977, I always wanted more than Lucas was ever able to provide on the big screen.

The focus of The Clone Wars is the clones.  This movie, and the 30 minute episodes shown every week on The Cartoon Network, go to great pains to show us the clones are individuals with their own personalities and quirks.  They realize they are just Bantha fodder in the great Republic war machine, yet they fight and die without question.  If you're hurt, just a bit, every time a clone dies... that was point of this exercise.

Not only do we learn of the clones, but also of the other Master Jedi.  The Sith and the Separatists are explored in great detail.  The Separatist droids provide the comic relief.  You'll recognize Lucas's dated corny-ness in every moronic thing the droids say.

If you don't like it, no big deal.  Go watch the original triology on Laser Disc and enjoy.  Star Wars is George's story done George's way... not yours, mine or ours to tell.  The Clone Wars isn't perfect.  Some parts are down right annoying.  I've changed a lot since May 1977... and so has Star Wars.",1230422400,62,1423,4.394636015325671

Sadly however, The Clone Wars ends up being aimed at a more juvenile audience, and the whole thing just comes off as rather lame.  Not to mention that story-wise, things are just pretty boring, and any of the new characters that pop up here we just don't care about.

Jackson as Jedi master Mace Windu; and the animation itself is stylish and well-animated.

The movie tells the story of Jabba's son kidnapped by Count Dooku, since the Jedi are negotiating with Jabba for safe passage through his territory, he intends to use this against the Jedi and blame them on kidnapping the Hutt's son. The story may work for a TV show (as was originally intended) but it clearly doesn't work for film. Add to that the amount of liberties taken with characters and story and the movie fails to deliver, it is not bad, but doesn't feel like Star Wars. Out of nowhere Anakin now has a Padawan learner called Ahsoka, they call each other ""Skyguy"" and ""Snips"" during the whole movie, Jabba's son is never called by his name but ""Stinky"" instead, his father calls him ""Punky Muffin""... you get the picture. If that weren't enough, while the classic star wars music themes are present, they have been rearranged and new music has been composed for it, a huge part of the star wars universe was the incredible and epic score wrote by John Williams, and that's gone too.

The movie (and the series) does not follow the line from the previous work by Genndy Tartakovsky, which told separate stories of the clone wars from different perspectives as this one now focuses more in the relationship of Anakin and his recently found Padawan learner. The animation is average if compared with other releases (for example ANY Pixar film) and the designs are cool, as explained in one of the documentaries, the idea was to have a mixture from the designs used in Tartakovsky's work with the Thunderbird-like marionettes.

I have to admit this looks and sounds amazing on Bluray, after watching the first episodes of the show the movie makes more sense than when I first watched it, in the end, it's Star Wars... I have watched the movie and the episodes with my little kid and he seems to enjoy them very much, obviously, the target audience for this movie and the new TV show are not the fans from old but the younger audiences discovering Star Wars for their first time...",1229385600,,2238,4.576059850374065

3615312,2,B001GLX74I,"I've spent hours in line waiting to see the various Star Wars franchise films.  While ""Clone Wars"" filled in some gaps in the history, the film has several fatal flaws.

The war's between the Republic and the Separatists.  The Republic, led by Kenobi and Skywalker, are trying to rescue Republic forces trapped by the Separatist clone army. They are also trying to rescue Jabba the Hutt's kidnapped son to form an alliance with the Hutt Tribe.

I enjoyed the characterization, particularly the introduction of a female Jedi Knight.  Ahsoka (voiced by Ashley Eckstein) is the typical mismatched pair with Anakin (voiced by Matt Lanter).

I've got a few major complaints. First, John Williams' music is gone.  The opening narrative just wasn't in line with the pyramid shaped crawl the other films start with.

Second, the CGI animation was stellar in places and dreadful in others.  If they can make a spaceship look real enough to look like regular film in places, they can remove the jagged edges from the character's faces and give them more than molded hairstyles.  Kenobi's beard looked more like an Egyptian carving.

Finally, the clones weren't an enemy.  They were more like a clown force.  Their interaction made the whole story more or less pointless.

On the other hand, the cartoon network show is great.  That works, the movie just doesn't.

For a bit now, I've nursed a mad-on at George Lucas and his bungling of the Star Wars universe. But, in retrospect and after some years removed, the Star Wars prequel trilogy doesn't quite seem as awful as I thought (although Jar Jar Binks - grrrr!).&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Star-Wars-Episode-III-Revenge-of-the-Sith-Widescreen-Edition/dp/B00005JLXH/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Star Wars - Episode III, Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)</a>&nbsp;went a long way to atoning for some of the sabotage done. Anyway, given that Lucas had already jumped the shark in a galaxy far, far away, I still wanted to approach STAR WARS: THE CLONE WARS with a less prejudiced perspective, and this mindset pays off. Thanks to my super power of compartmentalizing, I actually had a good time watching this animated feature.

Chronologically, STAR WARS: THE CLONE WARS takes place between&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Star-Wars-Episode-II-Attack-of-the-Clones-Widescreen-Edition/dp/B00006HBUJ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Star Wars - Episode II, Attack of the Clones (Widescreen Edition)</a>&nbsp;and EPISODE III: REVENGE OF THE SITH. It also sets the stage for the new STAR WARS: THE CLONE WARS animated television series on the Cartoon Network. As the movie opens, the Republic is at war with the Separatists. Even as Obi-Wan Kenobi is charged with negotiating a safe passage treaty with the galactic crime lord, Jabba the Hutt, who controls the Outer Rim shipping routes, Anakin Skywalker and his new, enthusiastic Padawan learner, Ahsoka Tano, go on a mission to rescue Jabba's abducted baby. Of course, this is exactly what the traitorous Count Dooku is counting on.

The vast leaps in moviemaking f/x seem to have an adverse effect in Lucas's storytelling ability. As one improves, the other degenerates. There's no escaping that THE CLONE WARS is strictly vanilla. It takes on the sensibilities of those old matinee serial movies, meaning that it's mostly a series of non-stop action sequences stretching out a bare bones plot. Basically, it's platoon after platoon of battle droids getting smashed, with the film occasionally breaking away to feature lightsaber throwdowns. Obviously pandering more towards younglings, it's no surprise that the movie feels shallow and that character development is quickly defenestrated. And, although the film serves to fill in some gaps during the Clone Wars, nothing really significant crops up to contribute to the Star Wars mythos. Not to mention, John Williams' classic theme score is woefully neglected. But, okay, for what it is, the film is nicely done and it succeeds on its objective, which is to draw in an audience for the then upcoming television cartoon series. For older Star Wars geeks, THE CLONE WARS is something to watch with the brain on park. I cringed a bit, though, during the opening moments, when that newsy voice-over goes into its monologue, ala STARSHIP TROOPERS.

Huge chunks of screen time are given to Anakin and his spirited 14-year-old apprentice. They make a hotheaded duo, and their constant, infantile bickerings serve to undermine the film, but, again, the kids will probably beg to differ. I shudder each time Ahsoka refers to Anakin as ""Sky Guy"" (he calls her ""Snips""), although that's just another element of their older brother/younger sister dynamics.

Although many relevant characters from the live action films appear, it's disconcerting that so few of the original actors lend their voices to this film. In Hayden Christensen's case, this is probably a good thing, as less of him equates to fewer apoplexies suffered by the viewers. Samuel J. Jackson, Christopher Lee and Anthony Daniels do show up, and their voices are invaluable. The CG animation here is angular and stylized. In its look, it veers away from the animation style of the 2003 CLONE WARS television micro-series (see&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Star-Wars-Clone-Wars-Vol-1/dp/B0006Z2LMO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Star Wars - Clone Wars, Vol. 1</a>). In a way, it more resembles the marionette style of those 1960s Thunderbirds shows, although, thankfully, the animation here is much, much more fluid. It's no Pixar material, but I kinda dug it.

Boil it down? STAR WARS: THE CLONE WARS offers a subpar story but sort of makes up for it with pretty cool battle sequences and decent animation. I even grew fond of Ahsoka Tano, who, in her eagerness and recklessness, is much like Anakin when he was younger. Probably why they end up getting along. As usual, there's that blend of panoramic space opera and Jedi mysticism. Death rays and magic swords. And the battle robots get the funniest lines.

But what happens to Ahsoka Tano that we don't see her in REVENGE OF THE SITH? Or did I miss something?",1227916800,4,5080,5.554263565891473

That being said, I thought that it was a good idea for Lucasfilm animation to release a movie to promote/kick-off the Cartoon Network series. This movie, however, was not their best effort.  I usually think everything that comes out of the Lucas camp is gold, but this one was way below average. A big miss people

The fight scenes are visually stunning in this presentation, though the dialogue to push the story forward often suffers from being quite stilted.

This is one more example, but I'll be more objective and base this review on content not bias.

In terms of the timeline, this takes place between episodes 2 & 3, but it undermines the Cartoon Networks animated Clone Wars cartoon (which was very well done). In the cartoon, Anakin is still a padawan but eventually becomes a Jedi and the timeline leads up literally to the opening scenes of episode 3. So where does this fit in? It doesn't.

In terms of characters, Anakins padawan is introduced. What padawan? Good question. There's never been a reference to Anakin ever having a padawan. Not in episode 3, not in the cartoon, not in the books. Nowhere. The character herself is an annoying, disrespectful, sophomoric twit. You can argue that Anakin was undisciplined, but Anakin didn't grow up in the Jedi Temple. She's the Jar Jar of the show. The only good thing is knowing that she must die before episode 3.

The animation is fine for TV, but it should never have been released in the theater, As a precursor to the series it works, aside from the fact that it never happened.

The best part of the movie/series are the clones themselves. This really shows them as people and individuals as opposed to the human robots we've come to see tham as. The entire movie and series would have worked better if it had been entirely from the point of view of the troopers, with the Jedi being secondary characters. That would have eliminated any undermining of the storyline, which is what Lucas ended up doing.",1227139200,3,1693,4.633333333333334

Now, let's take The Clone Wars for what it really is. It is merely a feature-length prelude to the kid-friendly animated TV series on Cartoon Network; nothing more, nothing less. Even George Lucas himself admitted in an interview that the Clone Wars feature film was pretty much ""an afterthought"" after he viewed the dailies from the actual TV show.

I, for one, felt that the animation was quite beautiful and pleasing to the eye as far as the backgrounds and layouts were concerned. Yes, the characters did appear to be too rigid and expressionless and everyone's hairstyles appeared to be molded from Play-Dough, but overall, the animation was quite nice; maybe not state-of-the-art, but still quite enjoyable.

Also, it is true that the plot was rather thin, but remember Lucas' target audience for this film and the TV series; kids and pre-teens. My five-year-old loved it and I enjoyed watching it with her. Compared to the actual movies, however, it does leave you kind of flat. Even Genndy Tartakovski's 2004 Clone Wars traditional animated series was vastly superior to this film, but you have to keep in mind the fact that the 2004 series was aimed at a more mature audience (teens and adults IMHO).

Will I watch the series on Cartoon Network? If I'm home and there's nothing else on or nothing else better to do, sure. If not, oh well, no big loss. I won't make it a point to tune in.

So, take this film for what it is; a kid-friendly chapter in the Star Wars prequel saga; just don't expect to experience that same thing that the films offered and you will enjoy it.",1227052800,,1751,4.617363344051447

It's full of action and light hearted jokes and some hip dialogue that only young people use.  The movie starts strong, with a great action sequence with Anakin Skywalker and Obi Wan Kenobi defending a city from the droid army under Count Dooku.  The plot extends to show Dookus plan to kidnap Jabba the Hutt's son in order to frame the Jedi and win favor for shipping routes in the outer rim.

As it moves on the movie keeps its pace and is entertaining, but somewhere in the middle they seemed to realize they forgot about Queen Amidala and new story line is born.  This seems to drag the movie down and slow the pacing.  Not that it's a bad story line but it's not integrated well and things kind of deteriorate.  The animation is strange at first, it looks like the characters are all carved from wood, but you get used to it after a while and realize it's very good.

In all, it's a decent movie.  There weren't any high expectations, it's Star Wars after all.  I will say that in many respects as far as dialogue and acting go, it's quite surpasses the live movie trilogy.  I think good old Uncle George (Lucas) doesn't realize that the die hard fans from the original trilogy aren't that interested in the Adventures of Anakin during the Clone Wars once we found out how he because Darth Vader.

This movie is good rental and a decent venture in an official Star Wars movie that WASN'T directed by Uncle George, who seems to have lost touch with the original audience of his success.  I can only hope that he will let more young directors take the helm and writing duties for future projects.  There is a lot of talent out there who adore the original trilogy and the basics of the new stories that could breath serious life into the franchise.",1226880000,2,2093,4.456692913385827
3615324,4,B001GLX74I,"So, I saw this originally in the theater.  I mean, it's Star Wars, you have to experience Star Wars in the theater.  I can now say I've seen every movie in said way (going back to '77).  I went into it with no preconceived notions about it, only that it was a new Star Wars movie.  I never saw a trailer or anything for this.  It was something I started when the prequel came out.  I wanted to know nothing about the movies before seeing them.
So, ok, this was just an excuse to make a movie.  The plot is cellophane thin.  I am actually all right with that.  The action scenes SCREAM Star Wars, Anakin and the other main characters are fleshed out a little more, and it is all in all good fun.  It is geared for a younger audience, but so were all the others.
Ahsoka is great.  Even at her tender age, she is able to keep up with the likes of the Chosen One.  Yes, there are certain characters that don't necessarily fit in with what most of us see as the Star Wars universe (Rotta, Ziro) but it was necessary for what story line there is.
All in all, I enjoyed watching this and YES I do own this on DVD.  I haven't been able to catch the series yet on Cartoon Network, but based on the movie (weak storyline and all), it has potential to expand, in a good way, the Star Wars Universe.",1226707200,6,1287,4.079681274900398
3615325,5,B001GLX74I,"Its not that this is a bad movie but as a 26 year old man with a love for Star Wars I really didn't enjoy this movie that much.  In fact, I don't see why there was a theater release b/c it looks more like direct to video.  I got the blu ray and was hoping for good bells and whistles but I wasn't impressed.  The audio quality I found was kind of a let down even though lightsabers usually sound about the same but on blu ray you kind of expect more.

I don't know anything about the series coming out and perhaps if I did I would have enjoyed it more.  I did notice Obi Wans beard looked like he took square blocks and glued them around his face.  I did like seeing the clone troopers since the new movies didn't go too deeply into their squad tactics.  I was hoping for more clone fights and battles though.  Seeing them in action, even though it was cartoon like was nice.  I did think the story was relatively pointless and didn't make me get to the end and say ""man that was pretty good"".  Weird seeing the WB logo and no Star Wars intro at the beginning just the name of the movie.  I found a lot of the Star Wars music was missing in fact all of it was but you could tell it was Star Wars for the most part.  The humor of the droid army and pretty much the whole movie was more directed toward a younger audience which was o.k.

My three year old daughter has autism and she gets a kick out of watching movies with flare and vivid colors.  This movie had that in the battle scenes and I could tell that though she can't talk her excitement showed clearly.  She doesn't know whats going on but she has a rare taste in these movies and even though she doesn't watch it like me I know she liked it.  At 1st I couldn't get her to watch the movie all she would do is lay in her bed and look at the movie case.  After that I think she got curious about what the case was and that was my five star rating, seeing her enjoyment.

I watched Star Wars a lot when I was little and its great to see a new generation enjoying it hence my five star rating.  Since as far as I know the Star Wars saga is over I hoped this movie had been better.  It didn't really hurt the series but it didn't really add much to it.  Not the worst movie but not the best so I guess I would say it was o.k.",1226707200,3,2280,3.9344978165938866
3615326,2,B001GLX74I,"I am at least partially to blame for being brutally disappointed by THE CLONE WARS. After watching REVENGE OF THE SITH, I believed George Lucas had finally ""gotten it"" -- finally remembered most of why the original trilogy was so good and done everything in his power to recapture its energy. With TCW I was hoping that momentum would continue, and he would mine the rich storytelling possibilities offered by the wars, whose surface was barely scratched by the prequel trilogy. Wrong!

This movie is a clunker. A lead duck. A turkey. A lemon. An edsel. A dud. It has all the problems of the worst movies of the STAR WARS series -- horrible dialogue, wooden delivery, sluggish pacing, unfunny jokes, stupid characters and a dull, unimaginative plot -- but almost none of its strengths. It's so inert and lifeless it lacks the power even to be truly bad. And no, I didn't much care for the animation, either. If I wanted to see badly-written puppet theatre, I'd put socks on my hands and tell knock-knock jokes.

The plot of CLONES is so ordinary it hardly bears recounting. Something about a plot by the Sith to drive Jabba the Hutt's criminal empire into the Separatist camp, and the Jedi's efforts to prevent this, insomuch as they understand what is going on. Unfortunately, while the movie abounds with action, spaceships, clones, droids, explosions, lightsaber fights, etc., it's not very entertaining, and the ""new"" characters, Ashoka (Anakin's apprentice) and Ziro the Hutt, are among the worst ever introduced in the STAR WARS universe. Of course, it's hard to say which is more unpleasant to watch; the painfully stupid sitcom banter between Anakin and Ashoka, or the horribly executed character of Ziro (I'd say whoever came up with this loser should be fired, but I know it was Lucas himself). Furthermore, the sub-plot seems to exist primarily to shove Padme Amidala and C-3PO into a story which has absolutely no place for them.

I suppose it isn't all bad. The 50s style newsreel intro was interesting;
I enjoyed hearing the great Christopher Lee's basso profundo voice as he reprised Count Dooku; and there were occasional moments when something reasonably interesting or fun happened on screen, but for the most part the film is dull, unimaginative, unexciting, and the sub-plot is even more boring and unneccessary than the main story. It's really a marvel that dialogue as stupid and unfunny as that which appears in CLONES can actually get written, or that a storyline so rich in potential could not move the writers to do anything more than a story about Jabba the Hutt. It comes off as a lame attempt to bridge the two trilogies, and it fails miserably.

Bottom line: You know those WWJD? bumper stickers? This movie should have one that reads, ""What Was George Thinking?"" But I already know the answer: MONEY!",1226707200,6,2831,4.867219917012448
3615327,4,B001GLX74I,"I just finished watching `The Clone Wars' & to be honest it was pretty good. No it's not as good as the movies & it's not as intense as the Samurai Jack-esk `Clone Wars' shorts from 2003 but then again it's NOT supposed to be like ANY of those. It's like comparing apples to oranges.
ALSO keep in mind that Lucas is trying to broaden his appeal to kids with this movie's style & story telling as well as with the series on CTN so it's going to be, over all, a bit more simple in its execution but no less entertaining. Don't watch this expecting an Oscar performance. It is a CGI CARTOON! how frick'n serious/ critical are you supposed to take it? The action has more of an Episode 2 feel to it, for me at least, but the action sequences are just as long, fun & still `edgy' for a kid's CGI cartoon. They flowed well & were non-stop action. Clone troopers got it pretty bad in this movie and the lightsaber fights left me wanting more. They were pretty good for CGI though. It held my interest. The dialogue could have used a little help but what star wars movie couldn't? I wouldn't recommend buying this movie until you see it first but if you keep in mind the target audience is more kid than adult & remember what this movie is supposed to be/ do & you don't take it as seriously as some, then you should have fun & you'll be just fine.  Anakin's apprentice is there for the young girls as well as to be the little miss know it all pain in the butt for Anakin the way he was to Ben (it's called irony). She does shoot her mouth off a bit much so she may be a bit annoying for some out there (I didn't find her that annoying but she could use some work) but comparable to jar jar? Not even close.
`TCW' story line isn't a major one in the Star Wars universe; it feels more like a made for TV movie, but it does initiate the TV series so there is a broader story to set up here as well.
Simple, aims at a broader audience (hint.... kids) & still a fun watch, if only once, in my opinion.

WHile it is exciting to see the stories we never knew, the fact that we know the outcome makes them hard to be engaged in.  Everytime the republic enters a battle, while they may win the battle, we know that eventually the war will be 'lost'.  To also add elements of the original trilogy into this prequel story line lessens the impact.  'your father was a great jedi knight'... but no where does it mention him having a padwan.  That totally useless side story adds absolutely nothing to the movie arc...in fact, it lessens anankin's ferocity.  to leave him without a padwan and constantly have him be encouraged to take one would have been a better subplot.
And PLEASE... the whole JABBA's SON story line is beyond ridiculous.

However when it comes to this animated version of the Clone Wars, I suggest you use the force and pass this dvd by. The animation of this film  reminds me of the WII, Playstation or DS versions of the Force Unleased game. This animation is one step up from Lego Star Wars

The action in this film  is filled with action dog fights in space  and battles on the ground with a pencil thin plot of the Jedis saving the kidnapped Jabba the Hut's child.

So why else didn't I like it? I love the Cartoon Network's original Clone Wars (&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Star-Wars-Clone-Wars-Vol-1/dp/B0006Z2LMO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Star Wars - Clone Wars, Vol. 1</a>) that was done a few years ago. This film is a pilot for the new Cartoon Network series. If this film is an example what to expect in the future I would pass on the series.

The character interplay is weak at best. Ankin and Ben seems more disrespectful to each other, not like in the movies. Ankin is also saddled with his own Padawan. She seems over cocky like he is..and since she isn't in the live action movies...well you can read the handwritting on animated wall

The Vocal talents of Samuel Jackson and Christopher Lee is wasted in this cartoon.

So if you are a fan of Star Warsin general, here is another film to add to your collection. I  won't say it is worth no stars, but I won't say it was five star either.. SO Use the FORCE and make the right choice. However after seeing this DVD, my JEDI sense says AVOID young Jedi

3615337,2,B001GLX74I,"The visuals were bad and the dialogue was straight out of a Saturday morning cartoon.  Having said all that, the acting was better than the combined efforts of episodes 1-3.

The visuals:  The ships and background images looked alive while the characters themselves looked and moved like they were carved out of wood.  Very cheap.

The dialogue:  Anakin calls his new sidekick ""Snips"", and she calls him ""Skyguy""...or something like that.  All of the robots act like out of work comedians dropping dumb jokes all over the place.  I know this movie was really just a setup for the Cartoon Network series, but really!

I really wanted to like this movie, but it fell just short of being mediocre.  As much as I hate to say it, I keep holding out hope, so I'll keep watching them as long as they keep making them.

As a longtime fan of Star Wars, I would like to pose this question to other longtime Star Wars fans:
Is it possible for us to file a class action lawsuit against George Lucas to take the franchise away from him?  I figure there's not much more time before he completely destroys it.  Perhaps we can take Indiana Jones away from him as well.

Note there is bound to be confusion between the former and latter considering the only difference in title seems to be the work ""The"", and this it seems is exactly what Lucas is counting on.  In the remainder of this review I will refer to the work reviewed here as ""TCW"", and the superior  2003 series as ""CW"".

CW was an engaging series of cartoons shown on Cartoon Network.  The writers were given great freedom to work with the characters and universe to produce a work reminiscent of the original Star Wars Movie.  Specifically the stories were clean and straightforward, and the action was intense and well choreographed...in other words CW was fun!  Specifically lacking from CW were drawn out exposition of complicated political sub-plots, and wooden ""romantic"" dialogue between Anakin and Padme.  Now contrast this with the current work TCW.  The dialog is wooden, the action is repetitive and boring, and the storytelling is not engaging.  The final death blow for TCW is the introduction of side-kick character Ahsoka Tano whose inanity and banality rivals that of Jar Jar Binks.

In summary, stay away from ""The Clone Wars"", enjoy the 2003 series ""Clone Wars""",1226361600,12,1851,6.276679841897233

We got to see a Star Wars movie that was not defined by special effects, instead focuses on story and characters.  It also level set expectations for the new series.  Remember folks, the new series is playing on the ""Cartoon Network""...go figure it is aimed at kids.  However, I felt they left plenty for adults without insulting us with sickly infantile characters like Jar-Jar.

Ahsoka acted like a teenager, because she was.  Anikin responded in kind because he was not particularly well developed emotionally (remember, this is the guy who turned into the evil leader of the universe...that does not happen to stable people).

I have added this movie to my collection so I can see it a couple of times and to show my support for the Clone Wars series.

3615343,1,B001GLX74I,"After a prequel trilogy that was mediocre at best, the Star Wars universe has now hit rock bottom with the Clone Wars animated feature film.  Anyone hoping to have their faith renewed in the Star Wars franchise with the removal of George Lucas from the creative helm will quickly be disappointed by this film.  Anyone hoping to enjoy an hour-and-a-half of sci-fi fun will also be disappointed.  Not only do the filmmakers recreate all the mistakes Lucas made in the the prequel trilogy, they make plenty new ones of their own.

The plot of the film places a Padawan learner into Anakin's training.  Their relationship begins with constant bickering and never moves beyond this.  We saw the same thing from Anakin and Obi-Wan in Episode II and if you were annoyed by it then I assure you this is only more of the same.

Even the film's action sequences do nothing to save it from the lack of character development.  All are long, and most of them are boring.  And this is coming from a self-described lightsaber junkie!

As you can tell I take my Star Wars seriously.  Yes I am an adult, but I often enjoy other sci-fi and comic related cartoons.  If you are an adult looking for good animated action I recommend Justice League season 2 as a starting point.

Obi Wan fought the evil alien at the end of the film, she took off, and that's the last we see of her. And Anakin's young Padawan learner just suddenly dissappears too. That is the only gripes i have with the film. Other than that, i thought it was a great anitmated look at the Star Wars world.",1224460800,3,634,4.291666666666667

There were scratches and fingerprints all over the back of the DVD, I was afraid it wouldn't even play. I was able to clean it well enough that it managed to play but did skip a bit in the intro. :/
Other than that I love the movie itself, it's lots of fun to watch!",1521936000,,442,3.868131868131868
8305931,5,B001GLX74I,"My first experience with a used DVD. The one I bought arrived in like new condition. The packaging & DVD are in perfect shape. No scratches or issues with the DVD.

The storyline of this Clone Wars movie is a bit cheesy (aimed at children) & Ahsoka came across as a snooty brat. BUT this movie is *VITAL* because it sets up the whole Clone Wars CGI 6-season series, which we purchased from another source here on Amazon. The series is awesome, even for teens & adults, and this movie is the series opener & introduces Anakin's padawin, Ahsoka. Ahsoka's character development is a huge part of the series & she is now my teen daughter & I's absolute favorite character in the Star Wars universe. Now seeing her start off as a snippy brat in this opening movie isn't so bad since we know her personality/character better & that she matures into a wonderful person. It was exciting to see her return for the Rebels series (spoiler: Ahsoka LIVES!). (The Rebels series finale airs tonight!)",1520208000,,985,4.596590909090909

8305935,4,B001GLX74I,"If you're expecting this animated film to be like the live action films, you've made a mistake and will probably be disappointed. This isn't that nor is it trying to be. This is an action packed adventure and side story to fill in the gap between Episode 2 & 3. It's mostly action and comedy and not much else, but that's what's great about it. It knows what it is and it doesn't try to be anything more. Great for putting on when you just want to watch something with a lot of mostly-mindless action in the Star Wars universe. I enjoyed it but it probably won't be everyone's cup of tea.",1513555200,,588,4.258928571428571

8305939,4,B001GLX74I,"I'm not sure if ALL the novels and comic books spawned by Star Wars are consistent with the six live action films written by George Lucas.  I don't see how they ALL can be. I know there was a lot of vetting done by the Luca organization, but some questionable stuff must have crept in to all those novels/comics as financial decisions trumped Star Wars dogma. But it is my understanding that this animated Clone Wars movie an the animated Cartoon Network series that followed were closely watched over by George Lucas himself and, as such, deserve the attention of true Star Wars fans. They are supposed to chronicle what happened during the Clone Wars.",1505433600,,653,4.678260869565217
