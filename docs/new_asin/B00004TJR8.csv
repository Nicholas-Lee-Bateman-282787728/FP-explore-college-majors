7922863,5,B00004TJR8,"I'm so glad the Oscars turned out the way they did this year because no one is more worthy of receiving a statue than Martin Scorsese. If you ask me, he should get one for his every endeavor as there has never been a more consistent director of genius in the history of the movies--in my biased opinion. His artistic integrity is absolute as the body of his oeuvre is magnificent. I'm not sure how anyone else could have made his landmark successes-- Goodfellas, Casino, Taxi Driver and Gangs of New York--any better. Even secondary works like Mean Streets and The Departed are close to being perfect. For this documentary, they go right to primary sources, actors who have worked with him, as a means of describing him. The views of Jodie Foster, Paul Newman, Robert De Niro, Willem Dafoe, and Joe Pesci are all recorded. I also liked Scorsese's insight that the music in his movies is a separate character in itself. I have never considered that before.",1176076800,,955,4.65680473372781
7922864,5,B00004TJR8,I have presented a research on Martin Scorsese' cinema and this DVD is the best video resource i could ever find. Scorsese' own words on how he developed his style was a great help for me. This is an absolutely great documentary for everyone interested in his cinema.,1098057600,4,267,4.583333333333333
7922865,5,B00004TJR8,"AFI did a great job here on giving brief bio's and other pertinent information on the great modern day directors working in America.  This AFI effort on Martin Scorsese is a well put together DVD on Scorsese's influence and effect on modern day motion pictures.
Scorsese was once bedridden for a long period of time in his youth with a severe case of asthma.  You can see with the time he had on his hands that filmmaking and cinema history became his passion.  Although, most of his films have a rugged, hyperkinetic, and fragmented look to them; Scorsese, in my opinion, has a more thorough vocabulary of shot selection than any director working today.  His shot selection in any film he shoots comes from years and years of studying the masters in their past films.
I strongly recommend this DVD. It is a great buy. Also, Buy it as soon as possible.  I could not find this DVD anywhere!",984441600,10,889,4.566037735849057
