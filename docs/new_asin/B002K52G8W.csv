3939647,4,B002K52G8W,"Kevin Spacey shines in his portrayal of a Los Angeles psychiatrist, Dr. Henry Carter, who's been hitting the booze and drugs pretty hard in the wake of a personal tragedy.  After an intervention by his family and friends falls flat, the doctor's father (also a psychiatrist, and played by the great Robert Loggia), sets his son up with a new patient, a teenage girl named Jemma (Keke Palmer) who has faced a tragedy similar to Carter's, in the hope that the case will help his son re-engage in life and better confront his own grief.  Despite seeing right through the plan, Dr. Carter grudgingly takes on the case and it indeed starts him back on a more positive, functional path, though things don't happen easily.

An ensemble cast, mostly playing Dr. Carter's other patients, also slowly get drawn into the main story, either directly or through the comments they make about their own problems during their sessions with Carter.  An unbilled Robin Williams is a particular standout in his small but memorable role as a movie star confronting his own personal issues (everyone has them in this movie).  Indeed, many of Dr. Carter's patients are in the movie business in some way, bringing about an interesting juxtaposition of intense personal issues on the part of some patients (and Carter) and quirky Hollywood shallowness from others.

""Shrink"" is mostly serious, but it's lightened a little by Dr. Carter's wry, dry sense of humor (perfectly brought to life by Mr. Spacey), which the character can't help displaying even when he's hurting and wants to be left alone.  Keke Palmer's Jemma is also a ray of sunshine in the film, despite the seriousness of her own issues.  And, as previously noted, the occasional Hollywood humor, centering around the often insane world of movie deals and star egos, also keeps things from getting too heavy.

I was lucky enough to see ""Shrink"" on the big screen during its brief and limited theatrical run (thank you, ""Ritz Five"" theater in Philadelphia!), and heartily recommend it for home viewing when it comes out on DVD.",1250035200,46,2065,4.893982808022923

(This isn't an exciting, edge-of-your-seat, car chase kind of movie, so don't expect that.)  Kevin Spacey is a ""Shrink"" whose wife has committed suicide.

3939696,5,B002K52G8W,"A well played look at suicide and it's impact on the human psyche. I was enjoying the movie as it was, but the well intentioned(by the actors and story) but disastrous intervention scene caught me off guard.

I felt like I was kicked and knocked off my feet.

People die, and whether young or old there is usually a good reason, illness, accidents or even a victim of crime. But suicide, what rational person could ever consider such an action.

I am a two time suicide survivor. Long ago my father, not so long ago my daughter. When the details of Dr. Carters wife's death emerged in the intervention scene, well to say emotion evoking scene is a bit of an understatement.

However I am surviving and this film, for me, captured many of the essences and nuances of the road to recovery. Talking about the act(suicide), as in the movie, with someone else who has been there, will be the road to recovery.

Though at times I was left in tears, I was pleasantly surprised on how good of a film this ended up being. There is life after deep personal loss. As in the film Spacey's character Dr. Carter find's the light at the end of the tunnel, so have I. The message is life goes on and there is a period of grief that must be endured, however not kept to yourself.

Well played mix of comedy and drama, at times I laughed, at times I cried. Robin Williams small part, so well played in light of his recent death. Sometimes the student is the teacher, so well played by Spacey's relationship with the young woman Jemma who lost her mother. He was not taking her case seriously till he actually read her file and learned he did not have the monopoly on grief for the victims of suicide.

BTW, I watched this one twice!

Enjoy!",1416096000,,1722,4.376175548589342

3939713,5,B002K52G8W,"The film has a slow start but the tempo mirrors what I remember as the shift in my perception of time when I smoked a lot of product, many years ago. It was uncomfortable but familiar, which is what I think the Kevin Spacey character asks us to consider, a moment in time when we were made uncomfortable by the familiar. Writing post Robin Williams, I find the movie sadly prophetic. But the character of Jemma, beautifully played by Keke Palmer, reminds us that it is not only the rich and famous who struggle with life. I was happy to see Jemma take her place as a rising star but the way it played out was abbreviated and inauthentic, which may be the point. We don't all survive and we don't all have our dreams fulfilled. A harsh reality gently delivered. Dallas Roberts played his part to perfection reminding us that pain is inevitable but suffering is optional.",1413763200,,869,4.506329113924051

Losing ones perspective of powerful healer to an awareness of humanness, lack of effectiveness and loss of meaning and direction in a profession can be a period of knowing how futile human energies are in changing anything!  This drama had deep personal meaning for me after working many years to secure direction and meaning for others ~ I might add this was perhaps the most traumatic period in my personal and professional lives.

3939828,4,B002K52G8W,"'Shrink' is a film that could have been great, instead it is OK. It took the clich&eacute;s too far.

Kevin Spacey is not at his best as a psychiatrist to the 'stars'.  After a recent personal tragedy he has turned into a grizzly bear with a dark beard that is not trimmed, and he is stuffing his mouth full of pills, 'whacky tobaccy' and Scotch. He mostly listens to his clients, but he does try. This is a film full of stars, Robin Williams, as an older star who is an alcoholic, but trying to convince himself he us a sex addict.  Jack Huston, a young new star full of drugs and booze, Saffron Burrows as a starlet getting much older, Mark Webber as a young script writer looking for a break, Dallas Roberts as a more than neurotic, obsessive who manages the stars.

Throughout most of the film, Spacey sleep walks while doling out advice in the daytime, and drinking and drugging in the evening. It is not until a young girl is sent to him, pro bono, to help her figure out her anger that some sense seems to be knocked into heads.  All in all this was a good film, but something was missing. Not Spacey's best, but there you have it.

In fact though Williams is onscreen very little his performance is one of his strongest ever. It was indeed made with a similar style as Shortcuts and Crash. I like those kinds of films. they have this ever present realism to them and you get a glimpse into the daily activities of people who live unusual and interesting lives. Some interesting observations. 1. This film has more F words than Scarface did. At one point I counted 17 of them in less than 3 minutes 2. No nudity, sex, or any real violence, which actually was refreshing for a change. 3. Spacey cried in this and it was a very moving moment. 4.

Hence he finds it difficult to deal with patients with similar problems; any advice he gives will automatically seem invalid.  Director Joshua Pate weaves an ensemble tale around this central plot-line involving a variety of characters, including an adolescent girl with similar problems (Keke Palmer), a perpetually stoned actor (Jack Huston), and a has-been star with an irresistible penchant for making love (Robin Williams in a substantial but uncredited role).  The story weaves its way towards an expected conclusion, with Carter eventually discovering an alternative after having had a brush with death.  Nonetheless there are plenty of incidental pleasures along the way, with strong performances from Spacey, Williams, and Saffron Burrows as a female leading actor trying to cope with getting old.  Gore Vidal turns up in a cameo role as a television interviewer, who apparently knows along with a fraud Carter actually is; when Carter admits to millions of television viewers that he is a terrible shrink, Vidal's George Charles nods in satisfaction.",1365811200,9,1248,5.282828282828283

But after an hour it starts to become doubtful that the threads will be connected, or that the movie has even remembered all of the characters it earlier introduced. Each performance is wonderfully credible and developed, but the excitement of an ensemble movie comes from the dramatic interaction, and this movie doesn't deliver that. It's the exact opposite of Swimming With Sharks, in that, as portrayed here, Hollywood people are: ultimately all looking out for each other; are basically decent; and will overcome their personal problems with minimal effort. Also, the mordant wit dries up a bit in the second half. Even if you enjoy character actors acting you may be disappointed at the wrap-up ending.",1363737600,,864,5.223021582733813

The main problem is that too many characters are introduced who remain undeveloped, so that they seem to be just filling space.

3939863,1,B002K52G8W,"Six vignettes revolve, seemingly at random, around the central character of a clinical psychologist who is depressed, drug addicted, and highly unethical. With a focus on ""the biz"", we follow an agent, a male and a female film star, a valet who wants to be a screenwriter, a drug pusher who supplies several of them with their daily fix, and a disturbed girl who likes to view movies. This self absorbed narcissistic type of film could only be made about Hollywood, but for someone who is not in ""the biz"" it's all very depressing and uninteresting.

The deadly dull topic is not helped by poor performances from virtually everyone involved, although some space needs to be given to Robin Williams who is far worse than most. At least Kevin Spacey doesn't chew up the scenery, as he has in some other films (e.g., ""Casino Jack"", ""Swimming with Sharks"").

The film is directed by Jonas Pate whose main credits are TV. Thomas Moffett is the writer and he plays a writer in the film (how original!). This was his second time out as a writer/actor, and while the writing is terrible, he's not a bad actor and puts in one of the better performances in what is otherwise a clearly unenthusiastic bunch.

The film has 7 producers, which is almost always a red flag. Lukas Ettlin handles the photography, which is up to the standard of the acting. The only thing worse than the script, acting, and photography is the audio, which at times is completely incomprehensible. On second thought, maybe that's not a fault with this particular flick.

I can't tell you how many times I thought about turning this off, but I was compelled by the belief that something this bad had to have an ending that was really good and would somehow redeem the entire film. After all, many of the talents associated with the film have a good track record. Alas, redemption never arrives.",1293321600,2,1858,4.672782874617737

Because, the script is excellent, the typical characters in a typical storyline are in familiar settings, thoroughly transformed. Wilshire boulevard was never like this. Mansions of the famous or the homes of the rich cry to be called those in the film. Dr. Henry Carter's back yard (?) belongs at a trailer park or in the so-so districts of London.

Kevin Spacey is not a memorable shrink, Keke Palmer is not a believable highschool student. Only the dealer appears real, until the end.

So it is people and places and events seen through the smoke of burning weed, and acted and directed beautifully with some very memorable lines.

My major criticism was the large cameo role of Robin Williams. he just did not go with the rest of the characters and was in fact too much Robin williams and too clearly seen. Fortunately the weed smoke came back immediately and his role was very quickly forgotten.

The interweaving stories work for the most part, which says a lot for that type of film. Sometimes movies like this can be contrived, and ""Shrink"" can be, but for extremely fleeting moments. The vignettes are stung together in a way that is only believable for Los Angeles (the ending for sure), and in that it works.

I can start by saying that the movie failed big time on what was probably the centerpiece of the whole thing, which is character development. Being a shrink myself, I'm used to talking to people with mental problems and life issues, so I can confidently say that all the characters (and they are too many) in this movie were far from interesting or realistic. They're all stereotyped, one-dimensional and annoying.

It takes a lot of time throughout the movie to realize there's even a story going on behind all the disconnected characters side plots. And when you do realize there is something connecting all of them, it's not good. Not only it's dumb, but the unfolding of the facts that lead to the end of the movie is completely absurd and forced-happy-ending-like, which is not expected in a movie that is every single second depressing, and apparently tries to portrait the inside of ""real"" people's minds and lives.

Plus, there's too much drugs. And overuse of the f word. Both things completely unnecessary, makes all the characters seem like the same person.

It's just a bad movie. As you're watching it, you just want it to end quickly, and when it does end you don't feel good about it. Don't watch it.",1263945600,4,1247,4.732718894009216

This is the first time, since his Oscar winning turn in AMERICAN BEAUTY, that I've felt the thrill again of watching a character actor at the top of his game.  He plays Dr. Henry Carter, a psychiatrist at the peak of his career in Hollywood, who has been brought low by the suicide of his wife. This is about the worst thing that can happen to a man of his professional calling as it signals his massive failure on every level as both human being and professional.  Worse yet, he comes from a family of psychiatrists! As he takes to pot in a major way and sleeps out on his diving board, his family and friends stage an intervention for him and his fury knows no bounds. However, he keeps seeing his patients and, ironically, it is his patients who begin to bring him back to the land of the living. Robin Williams plays one of these patients, a movie star who believes he is a sex addict instead of an alcoholic, parallel to his own real life at this point in time.  This film reminds me a lot of Lawrence Kasdan's GRAND CANYON, which I also loved.  I recommend this highly.

3939872,3,B002K52G8W,"The 2008 film 'Shrink' is a dark comedy bent on attacking the multitude of facades, private and personal, that separate us from our innermost feelings, needs and desires. Considering the subject matter what better location is there to confront the unreality of life, why Los Angeles of course. And surely what profession among all possible professions would be best suited to serve as the ultimate hiding place for someone hiding from himself? Lets say it together, a psychiatrist. That leaves one final, essential element to complete the equation. Amongst all the great actors who have the ability to emote angst, loneliness and utter desolation who would you think is perfect for the role. You're right again, Kevin Spacey. Wasn't that easy?

Synopsis: Dr. Henry Carter (Spacey) appears to be a successful, self-realized shrink on the outside. He runs a thriving practice and has written a recent best selling book on how to be happy. However when he steps out of the public eye his true nature surfaces. The death of his wife still haunts him. Most people think she died by accident, but he knows it was suicide. He finds himself unable to come to terms with her actions and struggles with undefined guilt and depression. When away from work and book promotions he lives in self imposed isolation, spending his time drinking and smoking pot. He is anything but happy and fulfilled.

As you would expect, his private failures and professional success eventually collide and rise to the surface with disastrous results. As chaos abounds two new female patients come into his life. One is a beautiful woman trapped in a bad marriage, the other a young girl dealing with her mothers suicide. Dr. Carter sees in these two a second chance for redemption and happiness. Helping them just might provide the antidote enabling him to reconnect with humanity and a reason to live.

Critique: This is Spacey doing what Spacey does best. No one can convey inner angst as well as he can, he's Mr. Existential of the 21st century. Unfortunately there's really nothing here that you haven't seen Spacey do before. The same can be said for the rest of the film as well. The production values and cast are solid, it's definitely a quality movie. However like Spacey there's nothing new forthcoming. You know exactly where the storyline is going long before you get there. Rent this one, but buy 'American Beauty'.",1257120000,7,2398,4.901477832512315
3939873,5,B002K52G8W,"As always Kevin Spacey never fails to deliver. Many layers to this movie, makes it an interesting journey for the viewer. Its not your typical movie where everything is spoon fed to you.  You're able to think and feel a little for yourself.  I see other reviewers 'caning' it, but I for one thoroughly enjoyed this movie.",1257033600,4,321,4.614035087719298
3939874,3,B002K52G8W,"Shrink suffers from a plot that isn't actually all that believable and the acting is mediocre or great depending on the individual actor. I found myself becoming increasingly bored with the movie and I was actually tempted to stop watching it--and that's rare for me when it comes to movies! The cinematography and the choreography, to be fair, as well done; and Kevin Spacey gives a great performance as a rather disturbed and drug addicted psychologist to the stars in Hollywood Dr. Henry Carter along with Keke Palmer as Jemma, a troubled teen with a similar problem to Carter's. Jack Huston also does a great job as Shamus, a big new name in Hollywood who's got a real problem with alcohol and drugs.

The movie is like an airplane that taxis down the runway as if it wee going to take off--you hear the jets turn up their power but then all of a sudden things slow down rapidly and the plane comes to a screeching halt. You can almost forget about the plot--it's not well done and it's very contrived although it has a few good moments. Worse yet, there are stereotypes in this movie that don't exactly help--an Irish alcoholic, a Hollywood agent with extreme anxiety, anger and a very bad case of obsessive compulsive disorder and more. Ouch!

However, if you do like this movie, you'll be hanging on to see what happens to Jemma, Dr. Carter, Shamus and the other characters including aspiring writer Jeremy (Mark Webber), Patrick (Dallas Roberts) the Hollywood agent and his assistant Daisy (Pell James). There's also ""Jesus (Jesse Plemons),"" the drug dealer from whom Henry Carter buys his marijuana. Robin Williams is also one of the better actors in this film; he plays one of Carter's patients extremely well and he is somewhat underutilized, unfortunately. There is a very brief appearance by Gore Vidal.

The DVD comes with extras. There are deleted scenes; interviews with producer Braxton Pope and director Jonas Pate; a Jackson Browne ""Here"" music video and the theatrical trailer in case you're interested to see that, too.

Overall, Shrink is little more than an average movie that you might want to skip. If you do decide to see it, however, walk, don't run; it won't be a lasting positive experience for you.",1256428800,,2228,4.794270833333333
3939875,1,B002K52G8W,"Opens with a reasonably appealing concept and impressive characterizations, but quickly degenerates into a mindless, boring and empty shell marked by agonizing boredom and meaninglessness.  You could say that I didn't care very much for this unwatchable film.",1255392000,2,259,5.815789473684211
3939876,2,B002K52G8W,"As the big studios make fewer and fewer legitimate dramas, it was heartwarming to see this indy drama take up big themes in a serious, even earnest, way. (As both a writer and a survivor of the suicide of my brother I was also personally interested in how the filmmakers would depict the emotional/psychological arc of grief-to-acceptance.) I applaud the filmmakers courage in dealing with suicide, grief, and the artistic process, but I just don't think the writer and director were up to the task which they set for themselves. You've heard of a ""noble failure""?  Well, I would call ""Shrink"" ""failed nobility"".

The structure of the film is a ""Crash""-type ensemble of disparate characters making connections as the film progresses.  This is a delicate and vulnerable style and I don't think the filmmakers hid the contrivances of plot very well.  When one of the key plot points involves a lost script and who -- in all of Los Angeles -- finds it, the manipulations were bald and obvious.  (Also, I wasn't counting, but there were 4 or 5 montage sequences which, again, felt painfully manipulative and artistically hollow.)

The characters inched very close to cliche many times (eg. the alcoholic Irish actor, the obsessive-compulsive agent, the sex-addict middle-aged actor. etc -- and this is ""serious"" drama?), but the acting is excellent (particularly the agent and the young girl). However the depth of thought in dialogue and action that the film clearly thinks it is evoking just isn't there.  (Just because you quote Kierkegaard and Mailer doesn't mean you know or, even more importantly, convey their wisdom in your art form.  And did anyone tell poor Gore Vidal he was in a film that name-drops Mailer?)  Also, the 3rd Act ""Let's All Make A Movie"" happy ending (""cinema ex machina"" anyone?), in my opinion, simply wasn't earned by the film.  It was as if somebody lifted the cloud and, suddenly, all the grieving and self-destructive behavior stopped and everyone was bequeathed happiness.  This rarely works work even in fables, let alone in a psychologically realist drama where depicting the process of how hurt turns into healing is the magic of art.

Again, I was rooting for this film, but, in the end, it felt like it was conceived by very smart, talented, ambitious and well-educated adolescents unable to fully comprehend the existential demands of adulthood (or even the artist, for that matter).  Maybe next time.",1254268800,8,2437,4.987654320987654
