8377822,5,B002QK2Y2Y,"Oh come on man this is on great DVD . Sure it's not  Steve Walsh on lead vocals ,but it shows the diversity of the greatest band on earth . No one has ever been to match the classic complexed sounds of Kansas",1400112000,4,208,3.8372093023255816
8377823,3,B002QK2Y2Y,"This DVD is a previous VHS release of ""Best of Kansas.""
I was hoping it was a new release of the original line-up back in 1982 but it isn't.
The box cover states that it is ""Steve Walsh as his best."" Steve Walsh, the original front man is nowhere
on the DVD. John Elephante is the front man on this video. I was disappointed but it is still Kansas and shows
lots of Kerry Livgren which you do not see much of in other videos of Kansas.
 A grainy video but still a must have for any Kansas fan.",1352937600,7,493,3.9797979797979797
