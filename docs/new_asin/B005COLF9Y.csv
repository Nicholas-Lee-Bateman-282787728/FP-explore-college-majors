So it's sitting on display, still in the wrapping, as it has become a collector's item to her. If you like the Bruins, I'm pretty sure that this is an amazing DVD to watch, or to just stare at, as she does. I gave it 5 stars for both uses.",1312588800,,346,3.8194444444444446
4653669,4,B005COLF9Y,"This DVD had a detailed look back at the playoff run. I wanted to re-live the emotions & the ups & downs I went through. This DVD made that happen! I have several champoinship DVD'S & this is one of the better ones. After watching, I wanted to watch it again because I cant get enough of the Bruins Championship playoff run. This might just be me being picky but I wished there were a little more emotion, footage, drama & Bruins highlights. Some key moments were missing. Not to mention, more player interview's. I would have liked them to show off how good Vancouver was to really get a sence of how amazing this was. I wanted those around me to understand what was going on rather than explaining what is going on, so they really get the sence of it.(These are non sports fans). This is something I noticed in most of the Championship DVD'S I have. But this DVD did better than most. I am a critical, with that said but its fully worth buying. It is done well to make any Bruins fan want it. They did a great job with what was covered, I loved it!",1311811200,,1050,4.2288557213930345
4653670,2,B005COLF9Y,"After watching this dvd of the Bruins Stanley Cup championship, I felt that the dvd was lacking in
content. The color and crispness of the disc is great. While viewing the disc, I found that often times the camera shots were extremely close and many parts seemed rushed. The entire regular season is completely gone through within the first 15 minutes of the disc. There were numerous moments in the playoffs that seemed to be barely included, like Thomas' great paddle save as he dove back across the crease. Don't blink or you will miss it in the highlights. Much of the commentary in between scenes is done by players Ferrence or Kelly. How about some of the other players reactions? I don't think Sidenberg is even mentioned. The extras were once again gone thru too quickly!  The parade and the locker room celebrations were special moments that lose something once translated to this disc. The final extra are the top 10 goals, saves and hits of the season. Not by the Bruins mind you but from the entire league. They show 3 different series or 30 different goals, 30 different hits and you guessed it 30 different saves. YAWN!!!  Get rid of that footage and show us more of the Bruins regular season footage. The DVD runs almost 90 minutes but it could have been so much better. They rushed this to the public and what should have been a cherished time capsule is barely considered a local tv news sports highlight real. The Bruins and their fans deserved better!",1311552000,28,1470,4.628352490421456
4653671,4,B005COLF9Y,"Judge David Johnson, DVD Verdict-- Boston Bruins: 2011 Stanley Cup Champions is a fine trip down memory lane, touching on all the notable happenings during the 2010-2011 season. From the team's trip to Prague and the legendary Montreal game which saw penalty boxes filled to capacity, to some pivotal mid-season trades and the storybook Cup chase, there isn't much left unattended.

As is typical with these DVD releases, the majority of the runtime is devoted to the playoffs, with each successive series receiving more and more real estate. In truth, each playoff run is deserving of its own release, but the producers did a good job of telling the stories these games wove: the blood-feud that was the Canadiens series, with Horton's game-winner springing the Bruins from their Game 7 hell; the sweet revenge of the Flyers bludgeoning; the nerve-shatteringly even Tampa series, highlighted by rookie Tyler Seguin's dazzling Game 2 performance and culminating in the finest hockey game of the post-season; and the nasty, hate-filled seven-game title-fight against the Canucks that sported gripping game-to-game drama (the Burrows bite, the Luongo trash talk, the Horton hit).

Boston Bruins: 2011 Stanley Cup Champions features interviews with players, coaches, broadcasters, and journalists to add some color. You also get a generous helping of game footage, candid sound grabs from the players while on the ice (love Ference's taunting), and the post-Cup celebration.

While the feature presentation is well-done, the extras could have been heftier. The locker room celebration is great, but the Boston parade footage is brief, and the featuerettes on the Stanley Cup and the NFL Top 10 plays (almost 30 minutes worth) have virtually nothing to do with this Bruins team. How about some more game footage, the Stanley Cup presentation, or extended interviews? Finally, you get the Bruins-centric ""History Will Be Made"" TV spots, which are pretty awesome.

The tech specs: a so-so 1.78:1 anamorphic widescreen transfer and 5.1 surround.

4653672,4,B005COLF9Y,"Being a Bruins fan my WHOLE life I am very pleased (& still in shock) that the Bruins are Stanley Cup champions! With that being said I am quite happy with this DVD release. The disc starts off with a quick rundown of the beginning of the 2010-11 season leading into the playoffs which makes up the majority of the playing time. This is where my only complaint comes from as I was hoping for more coverage of the regular season but hey after all the playoffs is what matters most! You get a good variety of players, staff, announcers, & some big Boston media honchos commenting throughout & it was particularly great to hear what they had to say in the more riveting moments of the playoffs...such as being down to Montreal in the beginning of the run, the Flyers getting annihilated, Bergeron's exit & return, the exciting Tampa series, Horton's injury & that pathetic garbage talking Roberto Luongo which also helped motivate the team to capture the Cup. The extras appear to be great even though I havn't seen them yet but they include: behind the scenes w/ the Stanley cup, extended locker room celebration, extra Boston parade coverage, season/playoff top 10s & 'History Will Be Made' TV commercials. So there you have it, Bruins fans we got our LONG awaited wish...so go & buy & enjoy this piece of NHL history for many years to come!

*UPDATE*  I watched the extras & the best part is definitely the Stanley Cup segments including the parade celebration. The 'History..' commercials are good (man I didn't realize how many were made for the Bs alone in this year's playoffs!) And as for the top 10s it's cool but gets old after a little while. Still all in all a good buy!",1311033600,23,1679,4.574750830564784
4653673,5,B005COLF9Y,"A must for any Bruins fan!  To see them overcome their obstacles, to come out of nowhere to win the Stanley Cup is very remarkable.  The 39-year drought is over, and this DVD is great to cherish this historical moment.",1358553600,,218,4.425
4653674,3,B005COLF9Y,"But they sure left out all of the biting, diving and hack play that the Vandiver Canookies employed to embarrass themselves as they lost to the B's.",1358121600,,148,4.518518518518518
4653675,5,B005COLF9Y,The DVD is just what it says it is.  I loved it.  It tells the perfect story of the Stanley Cup.,1356566400,,96,3.5238095238095237
4653676,3,B005COLF9Y,"I still can't tell what makes this version the Special Edition. It only has the games won by the Bruins in the finals against Vancouver and Game 7 against Tampa Bay. I'm happy I can watch these games whenever I want, but I bought this edition because I thought maybe it had behind the scenes looks or all games the Bruins won throughout the Playoffs. I was expecting more out of this DVD set so if the regular edition has all of these games then I would suggest you save your money and buy that version instead of this one. Still I am satisfied with my purchase to a degree.",1354060800,,574,4.2272727272727275
4653677,4,B005COLF9Y,"I have the digital version that I love for the convenience, my brother has the dvd. He has additional footage that I do not. It is cool but you buy the dvd for the core content which is amazing.

These are not replays of the games. Rather a recap. I love it. Tells the story going back to the rebuild. Highlights the major events and has footage of the parade. A must have for a bruins fan in my opinion. You learn a lot from watching this, I'm a season ticket holder and there are stories I was not aware of before watching.",1353974400,,525,4.097087378640777
4653678,5,B005COLF9Y,"My husband is a huge Bruins fan, and I am very excited to give him this DVD as a Christmas gift.",1353974400,,96,3.619047619047619
4653679,5,B005COLF9Y,"First I must say the negative reviews here are not mostly directed at this dvd set but at Warner and what they didn't include and the fact that there is no Blu-Ray. I do agree that this could have been released in Blu-Ray and that would have been awesome, the encoding could have been better as they put all the contents in 5 dvds... but it wasn't...so let's move on. Don't let the reviews steer you away from this set.

If your a true hockey fan, specifically a Bruins fan in this case, then this is a must have. I see nothing wrong with the entire dvd set and it's contents. You get game 7 vs Tampa and all winning games in the Finals. The encoding is fine,the picture is not like an old VHS tape, it's more than perfectly watchable. If you have a upscale dvd player or a blu-ray or PS3 that will upscale the picture, it's even better. What your buying is pure Bruins bliss. It's the U.S. feed with Mike Emrick, who we all know is awesome and gets totally into the action. We could have gotten the Hockey Night in Canada feed with Jim Hughson which would have made me kill myself he's so awful. Every part of each game is there. How can you complain? I can't help but still get into every part of each game. Besides the fact I still have 2 HD DVRs filled with Bruins playoff games, and the entire Stanley Cup Series, I've watched this more than a few times and still get into it.

Are you a Bruins fan? Don't you want to see Tim make his Godly saves, ala Grant Fuhr? Do you want to see the Sedin sisters get totally shut down, Boychuck and Ference lay guys out, Marchand pester and get under each Canucks skin, the entire team stand up to the cheap unsportsmanlike play tactics like one of the Sedins that made a run at Marchand AFTER the whistle and when Marchand ducks and flips him they cry because it was dangerous even though Sedin's intent was to cheap shot Marchand, or when Henrick whacking Tim's stick out of his hands because they knew they were outmatched and out muscled, Tim knocks him right on his back, Lucic sticking fingers in Burrow's face and on another occurrence gives him a nice shot to the back of the legs then a punch to the face when he whacks Tim on a covered puck and of course the hit from Aaron Rome on Horton that results in a complete Bruins assalut.

How can you not have this?",1345593600,2,2312,4.238095238095238
4653680,5,B005COLF9Y,I was glad to buy this. Its a good video and shipped quickly. Hours and Hours of viewing and footage.,1345075200,,101,4.1
4653681,4,B005COLF9Y,"Sure beats trying to rip games to DVD yourself,...but the fact that the footage is NOT HD, and that this is not available in Blu-Ray is a major bummer. Having watched the last 2 seasons on HD,....I think I can agree with most hockey fans that it is like night and day. I have no idea how I watched hockey for so many years that way, and there is no excuse to not offer the fans these historical games in the most pristine form as possible. The format is HD, but the footage is not.",1333065600,,481,4.073684210526316
4653682,5,B005COLF9Y,I loved it!....Great highlight of the Bruins 2010-2011 season and their playoff road to the Stanley Cup final.  The DVD is a must have whether it be on DVD or Blue Ray.,1331683200,,168,4.25
4653688,5,B005COLF9Y,This DVD is great for any Boston Bruins fan looking to relive the 2010-2011 Stanley Cup Championship season!

4653689,4,B005COLF9Y,"This DVD set is awesome.  But it could be improved with the addition of highlights from the Divisional Series #1 against Montreal. Don't forget that the Bruins lost the first 2 games at home and came back to win in Game 7 on Nathan Horton's overtime goal . And they then exacted their revenge of the 2010 2nd round win by the Flyers by sweeping their old pals from Philly. The first team in NHL postseason history to win three Game #7s on their way to hoisting the Holy Grail. This 5-DVD box set is still a must have for EVERY BOSTON BRUINS fan!

4653690,5,B005COLF9Y,Loved it! I actually bought it as a Christmas present for my brother but he was kind enough to let me watch it! Great DVD worth the money!,1327190400,,138,3.9642857142857144
4653691,3,B005COLF9Y,"After an exhausting 2010-11 season and an even more heart-pounding playoff run with, what, 3 game sevens (including one overtime win against the Canadiens!) and THIS is the best they could come up with?  I mean, yeah, it's great to watch ANYTHING relating to the B's championship but the fact that they absolutely blew through the regular season and didn't include many of the hard hits let alone the fanTAStic fights was bad enough but... where's Brad Marchand?  Next to Timmy, he was pretty much the face of the Cup complete with Sedin sister poundings and ""creative"" play all around.  No interview, nothing!

Also, I long for the highlight films of yore when they actually showed linear footage and gave you a sense of time and order.  Not this one I'm afraid, it suffers from the short-attention span tendencies of today.

Of course, if you were following the Bruins all season this DVD is STILL a must have, it just could have been SOOO much better!",1326326400,,954,4.716867469879518
4653692,1,B005COLF9Y,"I have been a Bruin fan for 40 years, and totally enjoyed their triumph. This DVD however, made me sick. BORING...really, all you can do is show the entire taped games? I agree with other people's comments as well, I would have loved to see at least some of the Flyers series, so, so, so sweet is revenge! Any ways, congratulations Boston, and their fans (including me), it has been a long wait, and a deserved Cup Championship. To those considering buying this Disc, DON'T, it is very disappointing to say the least. It doesn't even show any locker room celebration, or the parade in Boston. BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO",1325808000,3,633,4.925233644859813
4653693,5,B005COLF9Y,"Outstanding production, great player details, and just an outstanding Blu-Ray.  I'm extremely happy with this one.  It does a great job of recapping the playoffs and shows a ton of finals action.

4653697,2,B005COLF9Y,It makes no sense not to put this one out on Blu-Ray. I'm sure it will be made somewhere in mexico for about a dime then sold for $29.99 in the U.S.,1318204800,5,148,3.65625
4653708,2,B005COLF9Y,"First and foremost, I'm with the other reviewer in wondering where the HD Blu ray is.

Secondly, while finally getting to see the B's hoist the cup was worth the long wait. Game 7 of the Eastern Conference final and the four games the Bruins won in the final vs Vancouver is all we get to relive? What about the emotional roller coaster of the Bruins/Canadiens series or at least the series clinching game 7? How about a couple of games with the Bruins ""exorcising the demons"" in the four game sweep of Philadelphia (the very team that just a year prior came back from a 0-3 series deficit to hand Boston a Game 7 Heartbreaking Series defeat)?

This is kind of a let down. I think I can still get the Games on I-tunes which is probably where I will look unless there is a more complete set released.

A&E got it right with their World Series Baseball DVDs. They were a little pricey when first released, but you get all but 1-2 games of a team's championship run. I have the 2004 Red Sox set, and I wish bluray had been the standard format then when those were released, but A&E should be handling the Boston Bruins Championship DVD/BLUray set. A&E should be handling all the NHL's Stanley Cup Team releases.",1316131200,31,1208,4.408071748878924

4653710,5,B005COLF9Y,after 39 long years the Cup has returned to Boston! excellent dvd and i can now say to my descendants: i lived to see every Boston team win their championship,1314576000,,158,4.3
4653711,4,B005COLF9Y,"How sweet it is. I still get emotional when I hear Dave Goucher say ""The cup is back home"". As far as the disc goes of course I like it but I don't love it. Not enough on ice commentary from the players and the extended locker room and on ice celebrations are relatively short. Like most NHL products the production values are great but as any diehard Bruins fan will attest, you can't get enough of the behind the scenes stuff.",1314403200,,428,4.2317073170731705

4653713,3,B005COLF9Y,"I was disappointed with this DVD.  There wasn't much inside the locker room stuff.  They could have spent more time on each of the games in all of the series.  It seemed like they glossed over a lot of stuff.  I think they might have shown Thomas' famous save of the year, but only showed it once in real time.  At one point, I hadn't even realized they were showing a different game in the series (I think it was the Tampa Bay series).

The player and sports writer/announcer interviews were pretty good.",1313971200,,505,4.376344086021505

4653716,3,B005COLF9Y,"I'll start by pointing out that I bought the Blu-Ray version of this product. As Blu-Rays go, this compares with the best titles I own, in both picture quality and sound design.

As a lifelong Bruins fan, this was an automatic purchase for me; finally my beloved Bruins have brought home a Stanley Cup, that I am old enough to witness and enjoy. I had high hopes for reliving the past season, with this NHL presentation. Unfortunately, this production has a rushed feel to it. Key moments of the early rounds are glossed over, presumably in favor of a more in-depth look at the Stanley Cup final series against Vancouver. However, even that series is given the hurried treatment and overall, the show lacks any sense of the build up towards achieving the winning of the Stanley Cup. Even the payoff at the end lacks impact as there is no proper focus given to the on-ice ceremony when Zdeno Chara finally receives Lord Stanley's Cup.

I found this NHL Films presentation to be lacking in much the same way the Major League Baseball presentation on the 2007 Red Sox fell short. My hope here is that NESN (The New England Sports Network) follows suit and produces their own presentation as they did for the Red Sox, in both 2004 and 2007. In both cases (particularly in 2007) the NESN productions were far superior to the respective official league presentations. I can't imagine anyone but a Bruins fan would even consider owning this. As a documentation of the Bruins championship season it is frustratingly superficial in its' approach. I give it three stars as a Bruins fan but as an appreciator of documentaries I'd give it 1 1/2*'s. I find this retrospective to be lacking as it fails to go beyond the number of goals scored and it only perfunctorily credits the Bruins with winning the Stanley Cup. Bring on the NESN production!",1313798400,,1833,4.6894409937888195

Not only do you get a well-edited chronology of the season's key games (and plays), the the DVD takes you behind the scenes to see the other side of the story.  I admit that I get emotional about our Bruins (just like the Red Sox)... and I found myself cheering plays that I'd already seen... the Bruins' 2011 season story is told that well.  Even if you've memorized every play from every game, you'll still find yourself glued to your screen.  We've waited a long time for this... and, like our Red Sox, the Bruins have justified our faith over the years.

Take a look at the fabulous job they did with the Red Sox World Series' recaps in 2004 and 2007, and you'll know what I mean.  The continuity and flow just isn't the same here.  A lot of good plays from some piviotal games throughout the season are missing, or minimized.  This is worth having, no doubt, but I just wish they gave us more.
