6373396,2,B00JKSZNDM,"Railgun is one of my Top 10 anime out of the nearly 400 I've watched... Got this on Saturday July 5th and just started watching it on the 7th... Got to episode 4 and it started to blink in and out green screen, audio and fairy tail pt 11 trailer... will be returning for another copy that hopefully works (fingers crossed). I'll give it a 2/5 for my love of Railgun but not satisfied until i get a working copy...",1404604800,2,413,4.175
6373397,5,B00JKSZNDM,"A Certain Scientific Railgun S definitely surpasses it's predecessor in terms of suspense and thrills.  The first half of the new season further delves into the Little Sisters master  from the first season of A Certain Magical Index,  and who knew that there was so much story left to be told?  This is definitely an anime to watch out for if you're a fan of character depth and dark mysteries.",1404259200,5,394,4.585714285714285
6373398,5,B00JKSZNDM,"Very short and to the point, Railgun is the most favorite anime series in my library. The interaction with the friends, and the discovery of the sisters led to one of the great fight scenes which is sometimes missing in other shows. Railgun has laughs and times where she displays truly down to earth human emotions that make you realize that no matter who it is, despair can lead to unwise decisions, but when someone steps up to help there can be a brighter tomorrow. This show is tops for me, and I certainly hope that after season 2 parts 1 and 2 there will be a season 3 for I will lay down hard cash to purchase it immediately.",1412035200,,633,4.283333333333333
6373399,4,B00JKSZNDM,Neither volume came with an art box.  Those with OCD may get a little pissed because season 1 has one.  Show is great.  Packaging is crap.  Pretty standard region 1 dvd release.,1409788800,,177,4.4375

6373401,5,B00JKSZNDM,I must say I enjoyed this season more then a first season most as you start to see different side to railgun as well the story starts to cross paths with Index in which I was wanting to see.,1409270400,,190,3.8974358974358974

6373406,4,B00JKSZNDM,"I like it (Loved the others like season 1 & A Certain Magical Index).

Just one thing that seemed a little out of place...
Did anyone else notice the 'unusual' amount of background music? It was kinda off-putting how much of it there was.
I'm going to re-watch the other shows because I don't think i remember them having that much BGM.
I think it was really unnecessary in some of the scenes.

I'm a little curious if the Japanese version had that in it. If anyone knows, please feel free to reply. Surely Funimation didn't add something like that...

Side note: Did anyone else catch the last bit at the end credits? Warner Home Video being part of the Production/Distributer/ or whatever it was. PLEASE, Don't go screwing up our anime Warner. We've already seen (well some of us have) what you do to anime when you ""Localize"" it for a US release. 4Kids dubs anyone? I think we can all agree those were some of the worst edit/dubbed releases of anime the US has ever seen. I can only hope they're not over there trying to westernize their TV industry from the inside out.
Sorry, a little ranty there.",1404691200,,1102,4.472636815920398
6373407,5,B00JKSZNDM,"Academy city has settled down a bit since the Level Upper incident, but it does not mean things are quiet.  New rumors fly as people look around for money cards in back alleys, and also someone cloning a level 5 esper to see if they can be made via science and not by accident.  Of course Misaka laughs at them, even when rumor hound Saten adds her two cents in, until the day she actually runs into someone who looks exactly like her.  Now she is on a mission to save her Sisters and to shut down an experiment that never should have started, but can she do it alone or will help arrive from the most unlikey of heroes.

This plot is a quite a bit darker than the first season, or even of ACMI - this one shows that despite scientific progress, some things should never be done (not the cloning - but how they were used for).  But all the characters are there and the story flows very well, the voice dubbing is spot on, and the action sequences are amazing.  I will need to wait for the second part to see how it all comes together.",1404691200,,1034,4.145

8651896,5,B00JKSZNDM,"As a general rule, I tend to not enjoy anime that seem to blatantly exist for the sole purpose of parading around cute underage girls and putting them in compromising situations, and honestly the first season didn't really do too much for me specifically for those reasons. But I moderately enjoyed the Index series (despite the unneeded fan service) and so I figured I might as well watch the only remaining season of the show that I hadn't watched yet. And despite all of the sexualizing, I do enjoy Mikoto Misaka immensely as a character. Fast forward to the end of the redone Sister's Arc (which this entire batch of episodes basically revolves around) and I'm ready to name this one of my favorite anime of all time. Or maybe one of my favorite story arcs of all time. It's everything Index should have been. A strong lead with fun powers, a compelling heart breaking story that unfolds, and very nice music to accompany all the battles and somber moments. Add in Touma and Misaka's explosive (heh) chemistry and this entire set of episodes is pretty damn close to a perfect anime experience ( at least for me ). This is good stuff people, for anyone worried this might be too much of season one's ""cute girls doing cute things +espers"" then fear not, because it mostly sheds all of that for this great revision of an already pretty great story arc from the original Index series. BUY this and BUY the second half. It's worth the money.",1423180800,2,1441,4.589147286821706
