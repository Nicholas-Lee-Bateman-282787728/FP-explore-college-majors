It's got a stellar cast including Nigel Hawthorne, Leo McKern, Anna Massey, Judy Parfitt and the list goes on -- but best of all, the witty story line is just absolutely magnificent.  It's difficult to explain the plot, but it's at once funny, philosophical, poignant, warm, sad & sweet -- it makes you think about life & the ""chain"" of human relationships -- and if you love London, you'll especially like this film.

I watched this after I saw ""The Knowledge,"" also by Jack Rosenthal, another great comedy about London taxi drivers.  I loved that one, but The Chain was even better!!",1499040000,,728,4.443609022556391
