8462084,2,B0058OR3VW,"I was  very disappointed with this because there wasn't much on Bruce. Considering the cover has Bruce, and Steve on it. I found it very  boring. With the title given I was expecting more Bruce, and the E street band.  Most of Bruce's fans would know how it all started  for him,just read the book called Bruce it tells you all.",1377216000,7,328,4.327868852459017
8462085,1,B0058OR3VW,This is a video of the most boring talking heads pontificating/obsessing about Springsteen. I suppose it has some value as a sleep aide.,1367539200,8,136,4.956521739130435
8462086,5,B0058OR3VW,"didn't have the time to watch it yet, But surely it will be great cause stuff from Bruce is always great.",1352505600,3,105,4.0476190476190474
8462087,1,B0058OR3VW,"This 2 DVD set contains:

""Under Review 1978-1982 Tales of the Working Man""
""Under The Influence"".

It would have been nice to know that up front, like maybe mention that IN THE ITEM DESCRIPTION!  The description also doesn't mention ""THIS SET IS NOT AUTHORISED (as spelled on the DVD box) BY BRUCE SPRINGSTEEN, HIS MANAGEMENT OR RECORD LABEL"".

If you want these two DVDs, this box set offers them at a pretty good price but I found both DVDs to be completely boring.  There are very few clips of Bruce performing and the few that are in there all appear to be taken from real Springsteen DVDs (all of which I own).  For the most part the DVDs contain ""experts"" spewing their opinions.  Others have written reviews on the individual DVDs so if you're interested you can go read them.  From my perspective this was a complete waste of money.",1320019200,67,841,4.56
