It is somewhat entertaining, and you will have a few chuckles.  In the end, it was worth watching, but it's not the type of movie you want to see over and over.",1231459200,,295,3.9491525423728815

2711545,4,B000LP5D7Y,"I saw this movie at a film festival and I have to say that it's good to finally see a movie from an ethnic male's point of view. The story is about four guys who are into hip-hop, women, and hanging with the fellas. What makes this movie is this look into Samoan-New Zealand culture and how males in that culture deal with the pressures from mainstream society and their own community on issues of dating, sex, commitment, etc. The only time we get to see something like this is in U.S. movies like ""The Wood"", ""Hanging with the Homeboys"", most recently ""Better Luck Tomorrow"". So I recommend this movie because it's good to see how other folks around the world deal with the same issues and more than anything it's good to see a movie with an all ethnic cast that has a positive message. Plus if you were thinking about a place to travel, you want to go to Auckland after watching this movie.",1182816000,4,893,4.385542168674699
2711546,5,B000LP5D7Y,"I got this movie one late night on a whim, expecting it to be little better than a home movie.  I was, however, pleasantly suprised.  Being African-American,  I know a very little about Samoan culture.  I did not think that I could relate to anything in the movie.  However there seem to be a lot of similarities between Samoan culture and African-American culture, and, dare I say, that it seems that in part Polynesians are heavily influenced by movies, music, dress, and dance from black Americans.

The story is simple, but enjoyable.  Robbie Magasiva is very, very cute!  I don't think that I have ever seen a movie with him in it, or any other Samoan (Wait, is the Rock Samoan?).  There are also some jokes that I did not understand ( I guess that you have to be from New Zealand to get those).  Anyway, you won't be sorry that you got this movie, even if you do not understand the jokes and did I mention that Robbie Magasiva is very, very cute.",1182643200,6,952,4.419540229885057
2711547,5,B000LP5D7Y,"This is definitely a comming of age movie about the Samoan culture. It pokes fun at alot of the common Samoan stereotypes, without being overly offensive. I found myself watching it over and over. I'm looking forward to more projects comming out from here in the US, and overseas. I think this really sets the bar.",1175558400,2,314,4.625
2711548,5,B000LP5D7Y,"This movie is hilarious! Well worth seeing... only, I saw this in theaters while in New Zealand. And it could just be nostalgia, but I must say that the US release screwed things up by re-naming it Samoan Wedding.

 It rather stereotypes Samoan culture and doesn't represent the movie well at all! Considering Sione's Wedding is more about the antics of 4 Auckland guys who try to get on Sione's guest list... and not Samoan culture. The actors are perfect, as well. They are really funny and have the timing down pat. If you've ever seen BroTown (a cartoon from New Zealand similar to South Park but not as brash) then you'll know what kind of humor I'm talking about.

Overall, great movie! But PLEASE call it Sione's Wedding!!",1174262400,5,729,4.635658914728682
2711549,5,B000LP5D7Y,"This movie is a MUST watch for anyone who has any experience with the Samoan culture. It's not a complete look at Samoan life, but it's a fun comedy with Samoan flare. It leaves you reminiscent for the islands, even though the film takes place in New Zealand.

The original name of this movie is Sione's Wedding, but the name was changed for US release. The basic plot synopsis is that four best friends are banned from Sione's wedding because of all the trouble they cause at any public event they attend. Sione is the brother of Michael, one of the main characters and former best man. The men come to the conclusion that the reason they always misbehave is because they hang out with each other and never bring dates. They make a deal to be allowed at the wedding IF they can find real girlfriends to bring, not just girls stupid enough to say yes to free food and a night out on the town.

Even if you thought ""Samoa"" was a war-torn country in Africa (it's not), this is a movie that anyone who likes to laugh will enjoy. Of course there are a lot of jokes made even funnier if you if you have ever lived in Samoa or been around Samoans.

Derek: T, sup girl. Sole, malo man.
Albert: Who you calling ""sole""?
Derek: Hound dog in the fale.
Albert: Derek start speaking your own language, you come from Glenfield.",1172620800,7,1313,4.351020408163265
2711550,4,B000LP5D7Y,"Sione is getting married. He has decided that he does not want his brother Michael, and his three party-boys mates, to attend.

They have nearly ruined every wedding they have attended. But they are given a chance to attend - they must bring real girl-friends,

not party-girls, to the wedding and they have one month to pull it together. This comedy set in Auckland about first generation Samoan

New Zealanders, starts a bit slow, but by the time of the wedding, it gains speed and really becomes the urban romantic comedy it is

meant to be. If you are not Samoan, nor familiar with Samoan New Zealanders, you might not appreciate the inside humour, but

the writing and acting is good enough to make this light-hearted romp a winner for most. Recommended.",1168560000,17,759,4.71969696969697
2711551,5,B000LP5D7Y,"An instant classic, very funny and heart warming movie. If your not a pacific islander or have never lived on the islands you might not get the humor.",1439164800,2,150,4.392857142857143

2711561,4,B000LP5D7Y,"Samoan Wedding for this North American female created an interesting contrast to Once Were Warriors. Both movies provided a much-needed slice-of-life look at New Zealand culture as lived by those descended from natives of the island. Like Rabbit-Proof Fence does for Australia, these two movies alert the rest of the world that there's more Down Under than Guy Pierce, Nicole Kidman, and Russel Crowe.

Once Were Warriors is a heavy-hitting drama whereas Samoan Wedding is romantic comedy.

Important to the film is a careful mixture of personalities, family dynamics, and maturity levels to guard against stereotype.

Surprising is the close similarities between Samoan culture and African American culture. Those who've seen and enjoyed The Brothers (2001), The Best Man (1999), and The Wood (1999) will enjoy Samoan Wedding.",1356480000,,827,5.4453125
2711562,4,B000LP5D7Y,Saw this movie on television first and loved it.  In Australia it is known as Sione's Wedding.  I enjoy creative smaller independent productions that capture the emotions and lifestyles that are different from my own.  There are many laughs to be had in this movie.,1348704000,,265,4.844444444444444

2711566,4,B000LP5D7Y,"Some of the reviewers have commented that if they were into Samoan culture they might be more interested in this movie. This is more than a little insulting since few would argue that you need to be white to enjoy a movie centered around a caucasian wedding celebration like Father of the Bride. I happen to be of Pacific Islander heritage but I doubt this had anything to do with enjoying this movie.
  The film centers around a group of single men who are reluctant to abandon their single party life and settle down or at least act like respectable wedding guests. Most Hollywood films about guys and weddings are about abject lewdness and debauchery as in the Hangover. Samoan Wedding however, focuses on the conflict between the guys' desire to support their good friend on his wedding day and their reluctance to grow up. This is a theme I'm sure many men can relate to given that in most western cultures young people are encouraged to pursue their own interests and education and statistically people are marrying and starting families much later in life than any other time in history. Although this film is peppered with it's share of drinking and sexual exploits the thing that stands out most is the boys growth in varying degrees into maturity.
  This isn't an over the top Hollywood comedy. It has a lot of heart and the more subdued and realistic comedic situations typical in independent movies. It may take a little bit of effort to adjust to the dialogue which is particular to New Zealand Samoans along with the boys own brand of slang. I've rented this movie at least 3 times which led my husband to suggest that I finally buy it on dvd.",1308960000,,1657,4.625850340136054
2711567,2,B000LP5D7Y,"It wasn't what I was hoping for.  There were some funny scenes, and it was an interesting slice of life in another culture, however, it was a slice that I found unpalatable.  Too much boozing, lack of consideration in intimacy. I would be glad to have most of the characters NOT my neighbors.  I purchased the DVD because I like the Laughing Samoans, I have been to a number of Samoan festivities, and I was looking for something light and humorous. I was going to give it to the Pacific Islander Support group on campus, but decided the negative far outweighed the laughs.",1289779200,,573,4.543689320388349
2711568,4,B000LP5D7Y,"I am from NZ but live in the US.  I had been wanting to see this movie for a couple of years and finally my hubby surprised me by buying it from my wish list.  So I watched it, and though I think the story and acting, and in fact the movie overall are somewhat lacking, I loved it!  I literally laughed out loud through the whole thing.  Coming from NZ and having a lot to do with the Polynesian community, I found it to be hilarious.  I think if I wasn't 'in' on the jokes, it would only be mildly funny.",1275436800,,505,3.911764705882353
