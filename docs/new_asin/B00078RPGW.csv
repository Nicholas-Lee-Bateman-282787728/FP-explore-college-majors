2205102,5,B00078RPGW,"Great show and history lesson all in one.  Great to see so many of the artists I've heard about but have not been able to see.  The interstitial interviews with the artists were a welcome addition here instead of the usual unwanted distraction, perhaps because of the musical documentary nature of the show.  It would have been nice to see more than one performance by each of the artists.  I don't know if that's how the show was live, or if they limited it to one per for the blu-ray.  Most importantly, this show really furthered my knowledge and appreciation of The Blues more than any single-artist concert video ever could.  A must-watch for true blues fans.",1475539200,,664,4.632478632478633

2205104,5,B00078RPGW,"Words prove to be inadequate in attempting to describe the Blues. The live performances and the interviews are golden. This documentary should be in every music library. Lightning in a Bottle is an appropriate title. The Blues is the elder---jazz, R & B, rock 'n' roll, as well as hip hop are the children and grandchildren.  And then there were Blues....",1474675200,,355,4.819672131147541

2205117,2,B00078RPGW,"I saw this program on cable TV and loved it so I wanted to own it, however, I am extremely disappointed with the sound quality. I see that it is available from other companies and would like to know if any of the others are better. Have you had any other complaints?

2205119,4,B00078RPGW,"To say I was looking forward to seeing Steven Tyler and Joe Perry would be an overstatement.  I never owned an Aerosmith album, but if they had played a blues album or two who knows.  Their two songs (one on Bonus songs) on LIGHTNING IN A BOTTLE are well done with the only problem the songs, together, don't last 5 minutes.  But, Tyler and Perry come across the cool showmen in the process.  Tyler blues-shrieks and ""hollers"" like a dude with the best of 'em.  Almost difficult to admit but true.
As for the rest of the show there is also the stunning singing by Natalie Cole (I want to find out if she EVER recorded a blues album now); the great combo of Robert Cray and Shemekia Copeland; Buddy Guy in general (and that great footage of Jimi Hendrix in front row ""skipping a gig"" to watch Buddy play in 1968!); and you just can't go wrong with seeing Clarence Gatemouth Brown do anything (performs - at 80 - Okie Dokie Stomp ... very well... and shows off his violin prowess Pre-show...).
As far as clear cut misfires (in my critiquing eyes) Mos Def (he is a good actor, if you didn't know); and the Fine Arts Militia (thing) doin' (tryin) the John Lee Hooker ""Boom Boom""  (great clip of Hooker from '62 or 64, though).  At least the ""Militia"" is anti war.
I would have preferred another sad, lovely ""Lady Day"" jazz-blues song rather than the Chuck D's and Militias of the so-called blues musical influences of the world (or, of this documentary).
Fogerty is worth the mention playing ""Midnight Special.""
Hubert Sumlin - short one lung(!) - plays his guitar as a long-haired David Johansen does a (good enuff) Howlin' Wolf voice impersonation.
And B.B closes the show (naturally).
I didn't want to mention Cosby makes an appearance (this was filmed in 2004 so make your own observations) and I find it interesting Director Antoine Fuqua made this 3 years after directing Training Day (with Denzel Washington).
Still gotta watch 'action' Director Fuqua's interview which is an xtra on this entertaining Blues music documentary.",1463529600,,2029,4.666666666666667

2205162,5,B00078RPGW,"Movie director Martin Scorsese presents the story of blues music and traces its origins to West Africa. International star Angelique Kidjo begins the evening with a traditional African song in which she laments that ""they took away our people"". She was followed by Mavis Staples amid screen images of the antebellum South. The presentation uses the very successful format of an earlier Scorsese concert DVD - The Last Waltz - in which artists talk briefly about the music and about themselves amid performances. The video is interspersed with snippets of past blues greats.

The concert provides delightful entertainment. Among the blues artists are Ruth Brown, Buddy Guy, Robert Cray, B. B. King and Bonnie Raitt. But the night is not limited to blues. Rock and rollers Steve Tyler and John Fogerty take to the stage and belch classic rock. Solomon Burke adds classic soul music.

The DTS master audio of the disk is quite good and the video quality is better. If this is your music you should be very happy with the concert.",1419120000,,1026,4.890804597701149

2205184,5,B00078RPGW,"I loved it.
But I wish Scorsese would have acknowledged his trip to Mali and the role that Islam played in the evolution of the Blues. The opening piece by a woman who is unknown to me, is a kind of Islamic prayer / call to prayer that very clearly in Arabic (the language of Muslim prayer) praises ""Allah"" (God), and uses the word ""Salaat"" (prayer).  Listen and learn.  ""Camp Town Holler"" perhaps the earliest recorded piece of ""Blues"" is almost identical to the Call to Prayer.  See if you can find recording of it.
For more, look up the piece ""Slavery and Islam: The Roots of American Blues Music"" in Jonathan Curiel's  book, Al'America: Travels Through America's Arab and Islamic Roots. Lots of ""Aha"" moments and a fun read. . .from beginning to end.",1384041600,,754,4.562962962962963

2205206,2,B00078RPGW,"This is one of the lamest excuses for a blues show I've ever seen.

Many of the performances had little or nothing to do with the blues, and even those that did were leaden, stiff, overproduced and over orchestrated, not to mention that there just had to be three or four completely irrelevant guitarists on almost each tune (Odetta was righteously angry, and rightly so, about the band overpowering Ruth Brown during rehearsal).

Natalie Cole? Chuck D? Meanwhile, Dr. John, one of the two inheritors of the entire New Orleans piano tradition (Alan Toussaint was nowhere to be found), is reduced to playing barely audible side man on a few numbers and giving sound byte interviews? Puh-leeze.

Not that there weren't a few highlights, hence two stars instead of one. BB and Gate were their usual reliable selves. David Johansen's tongue in cheek Howlin' Wolf vocal impersonation was fun. It was nice to see Fast and Funky Larry Johnson get his five minutes before slipping back into undeserved obscurity. Honeyboy Edwards is long past his prime but was still good.

The sole shining, spontaneous, ""hairs rise on the back of your neck"" performance was, unsurprisingly, by Ms. Slide Slinger herself, who obviously insisted that the band shut the hell up while she was onstage. She has some serious stuff and she does not fool around. She always goes for the throat from the first note. But two minutes of Bonnie Raitt doesn't make it worth to slog through two hours of this ""Blues for Yuppies"" DVD.",1302393600,,1496,4.83203125

The omission of Albert King is a crime especially when they go into the 1960's and 1970's blues scene.  To not cover one of his songs was a disgrace.  John Fogerty, Macy Gray, Steven Tyler, and the Neville Brothers did not belong in this film.  I like their music, but they are not the blues. Chuck D's ""Boom Boom"" cover was horrible.

  Natalie Cole was excellent and really surprised me with her version of ""St. Louis Blues"".  Copeland and Cray did a splendid version of ""I Pity The Fool"". B.B. King's finale, ""Sweet Sixteen"" was excellent.

To have the old and the young represent the history of blues, the feeling, the songs, the musicians, and most of all these amazing performances.  I doubt if we will see another historic night real soon.  More than 50 musicians have come together at New York's  Radio City Hall.  This is a great even, great music and frankly, an extraordinary evening.  The house band is awesome that includes Dr. John.

The night is a story of the blues that dates back to the 30s.  The songs are tributed to the originator as each performer sings.  You will see photos and archive film of the past from the slave auctions, working in the fields, lynchings, The Klan,  and the early performers of the blues.  Son House says there is only one kind of blues, a male and female in love.

The songs are performed by the early blues performers and the newer ones.  The highlights are:  Ruth Brown with Mavis Stapleton and Natalie Cole having fun with Bill Cosby for a fun song from 1939, ""Men Are Just Like Streetcars"";  Macy Gray in her own rendition of ""Hound Dog';  and performing Slim Harpo's ""I'm a King Bee"".

Another great performance is Solomon Burke, who just died in Oct. 2010; ""Turn on Your Love Light""  and he gets the audience on their feet.  I especially like John Fogerty, ""Midnight Special"".  And what show would be complete without the sound and guitar of Bonnie Raitt, ""Coming Home"".

Someone I had not heard of or seen before is ""David Johansen singing ""Killing Floor"";  that was memorable!

2205230,5,B00078RPGW,"5.0 out of 5 stars Required Listening/Viewing, Dec 16 2007

I will admit/confess that I was never big on the blues. I'm more of a rock kind of guy, but all my heroes were so strongly influenced by the blues - I felt I owed it to myself and to them to listen to the roots of the music I love. I was so underwhelmed by the blues I would hear on record/cd (by the ""masters"", I simply didn't get it. I found the music to be badly recorded, dull, repetitive, somewhat lifeless. Then I saw this dvd for $10 in a wholesale club and decided to give it one more try. Frankly, I thought it was gonna be a BB King dominated show and wasn't expecting too much. But I finally got around to watching it.

OH! Now I get it! Now I see! Now I understand! It's as if I had been listening to the blues on a transistor radio in 1964 and suddenly someone replaced it with an iPod with the best blues music ever performed - by the original artists! This concert ""threw the switch"" for me. I've watched this 10 times and each time it gets better and better and better.

A reviewer previously said, ""If you like Blues Music and at the same time, want to discover the roots of blues, this DVD is a must..."". Good advice. But I would add: if you ""DON'T like the blues"", this might just change your mind! One of the best concert videos I own (and I own many).",1197676800,,1332,4.076335877862595

2205233,5,B00078RPGW,"Overall, this recent concert was good and offered a wonderful group of diverse artists. I had never heard of about a half dozen of these performers and really liked a lot of the ""new"" faces (to me). They ranged from a few old-time gentlemen to a couple of young women. Macy Gray blew me away with her rendition of ""Hound Dog.""

I also had no idea Natalie Cole could belt out the blues as she did. Wow, that was a pleasant surprise, as were the two Aerosmith performers, Steve Tyler and Joe Perry. I thought they were just rock/heavy metal-type guys. Wrong. Kim Wilson on harmonica was great, and Buddy Guy playing guitar is always awesome.

How about the band? There were some heavy hitters in there and they left no doubt what a great time they were having helping out most of these performers.

The only negative to this concert is the ridiculous rendition by Chuck D of a John Lee Hooker classic. He made things worse by turning the song into some really lame anti-war diatribe.  The real question is, ""Why was this included in the DVD while so much other good music was not included?""

Anyway, B.B. King finishes up the disc on a positive note and then Bonnie Raitt and Robert Cray join him as the ending credits roll.

This is more of a concert than a documentary but the songs are short, too short for my tastes since I enjoyed them so much but, hey, there were a lot of ""acts"" to squeeze into this 103- minute DVD, so I understand. I'd rather have paid more and had a two-disc DVD and heard the entire night's offering. That would be awesome.

Speaking of that, don't forget the extra bonus tracks on the ""features"" part of the DVD. There is some excellent music in this, some of it, I found, better than many of the performances on the main concert. The two Aerosmith dudes, Greg Allman and guitarist Warren Haynes, Buddy Guy doing another number and a ""21st Century Blues"" rendition of ""Revelation,"" featuring Chris Thomas King. These extra songs are not to be missed.

What it is is ""real"".  It is an event.  It is real in a way that few concerts ever attempt to be.  It is an event that few if any concerts can ever hope to be.  It is real specifically because it is the people of the blues just as they are.  It is the realities of the personalities, and their lives that made the blues what only the blues can be.  There are moments during this concert, this event, when any true lover of the blues must shed tears of joy.  This reviewer deeply appreciates those who made this event possible.

2205242,5,B00078RPGW,"On February 7, 2003 about fifty famous blues musicians gave a benefit concert at Radio City Music Hall to celebrate 100 years of the blues. Starting with an African piece from Togo, and moving through slave and turn of the century black music, the concert functions as a sort of history of the movement. Except for a few back stage interviews, marvelous black and white archival material, and short interviews, this unadorned documentary lets the concert speak for itself. Listening to ninety minutes of the blues, I was struck by the powerful simplicity of the words, and how merely knowing the words and the music by no means adds up to the blues. Except for John Fogerty, Bonnie Raitt, Aerosmith and a couple others, all the musicians are black, which makes for a strange setting when you realize that most all the people in the audience are wealthy whites (similar to an NBA basketball game in this regard). Yes, BB King gave the final two songs. This film is a music lover's delight.",1169596800,,988,4.716763005780347

Natalie Cole was bluesier than I ever would have imagined. As were Steven Tyler and Joe Perry of Aerosmith. I'd seen David Johansen in his blues incarnation, so I wasn't surprised by his transition from New York Doll to Buster Poindexter to bluesman. Also very good were some folks I'd heard of, but had never heard: India. Arie, Angelique Kidjo. I wasn't as impressed by rapper Chuck D. although his anti-war version of ""Boom Boom"" certainly had its heart in the right place. John Fogerty's version of ""Midnight Special,"" which he had recorded with CCR, didn't really bring anything new to the song, but it was pretty good. Macy Gray, doing ""Hound Dog,"" was better than I'd expected too. I've found her voice a little irritating on some of the songs I've heard of hers, but it's hard to go wrong with a straight ahead tune like ""Hound Dog.""

2205266,4,B00078RPGW,"""Lightning in a Bottle"" is just that, capturing a cross section of the very best of working blues musicians circa 2003. It's a documentary of a special concert held in Radio City Music Hall in 2003, and the concert's musical program is chronologially organized. One of the concert's goals was to educate younger people about the long, rich history associated with the blues, and the chronological order brings it home very well. A special effort was made to include a wide variety of blues songs composed by the creators of the idiom.

There are also some excellent performances, courtesy of the always great B.B. King, Clarence ""Gatemouth"" Brown, Buddy Guy, and Robert Cray. Aside from B.B., none of these artists get much mainstream attention despite representing some of the cream of the blues crop. (I was especially happy to see the always smooth-as-butter Robert Cray). And, they highlight the absence of so many blues greats who are no longer with us, including Albert Collins, Freddie King and John Lee Hooker. Also present are several mostly white rock musicians heavily influenced by the blues, including John Fogerty, Steven Tyler, and Bonnie Raitt. These are the performances I will turn to again in the future, as all of the above possess a fantastic fire rarely seen in the more showbizzy Radio City.

On the downside are the short length of all the performances, the occassional mediocrities, the absence of Eric Clapton, and the absolute desecration of John Lee Hooker's ""Boom Boom"" by Chuck D. I couldn't believe my ears - Chuck D's version was so wretched he made the British Invasion-era version by the Animals seem priceless.

This DVD is well worth a rental for any blues fan, and makes a fine companion piece to the lengthy PBS documentary ""The Blues.""",1123459200,,1774,4.926421404682274
2205267,3,B00078RPGW,"The thing that separates the Blues from many other types of music is that it is an art born of pain and suffering, of a collective experience that includes slavery, Jim Crow laws, segregation, discrimination and poverty.  With all that to face, who wouldn't be singing the blues?  Yet, as with any great art form, the suffering is only a part of the story.  For the Blues derives its true energy and strength from the optimism and hope it exudes, that hope for a better future that resides in the human spirit even in the darkest of times.  Through the years, the Blues has given voice to the powerless and helped change the world in ways that one never could have imagined a hundred years ago.  That is its true legacy.

All of this has been effectively captured in ""Lightning in a Bottle,"" a documentary about a concert held at Radio City Music Hall to commemorate one hundred years of the Blues.  The concert organizers gathered some of the greatest legends still alive today - far too numerous to mention - to play and sing together and to pay tribute to the musical trailblazers who went ahead of them (artists like Leadbelly, Billie Holliday etc.).  The concert itself has an almost ""survey course"" feel to it, charting the development and growth of the Blues from its roots in Africa to its flowering as the premiere art form and avenue of expression for millions of oppressed blacks in 20th Century America.  The performances are accompanied by behind-the-scenes interviews with some of the artists present at the event as well as by old audio and film clips of many of the seminal performers from the past doing their thing in the recording studio or on stage.  Thus, we are given a nicely balanced view of the Blues both past and present.

The musical performances are all first rate, although, in the interest of time, the sets are much shorter than any real Blues fan would probably like them to be.  Still, it's great to hear the old standards being performed by world-renowned artists at the peak of their form.  If you're a devotee, check out ""Lightning in a Bottle.""  And if you're not a blues fan, check the film out anyway.  You might just learn something and have a terrific time listening to all that great music at one and the same time.",1121558400,,2258,4.596009975062344

This is such an enjoyable concert film, that paces itself wonderfully. The rap and the only political statement utterd by chuck d serves a wonderful purpose. It shows that musically rap has no place, is woefully inferior, and can't exist outside of itself. Chuck D and his performance is embarassing, and anyone who views this dvd years from now will see how our culture momentarily slipped and lost it's way. It will be a mystery how such a great evening of  music of was tainted with such a one dimensional,tired, and talentless hype they call ""rap"" It is so completely out of place, historically, and without question musically. The rest of the dvd is a labor of love, and recorded like your favorite cd. A MUST OWN.",1119744000,,852,4.496774193548387
2205269,5,B00078RPGW,"Billed as ""a one night history of the blues,"" Lightning in a Bottle (with Martin Scorsese serving as executive producer) assembles a ton of great performers to retrace the steps of the blues from the Mississippi Delta to Chicago to the rest of the country.  The concert took place in Radio City Music Hall in February 2003, and it packs a lot of music and history into a little less than two hours.  Old clips, interviews, and snippets of rehearsal accompany the performances themselves, offering a blues history lesson of sorts.  I won't pretend to be an expert on the blues; Muddy Waters is about the only blues singer I've ever spent time seriously listening to.  That will probably change, now that I know a little more about the incredible music I've been missing out on all these years.

It would be impossible to talk about every performance crammed into this concert - blues songs tend to be pretty short (especially when you don't include any jam session stuff), so an incredible number of songs were performed on this historic night.  Go check out the soundtrack to see who performed what.  All of the living legends were fantastic, and their vintage blues is still the best blues on earth.  Mavis Staple really gets the ball rolling with her spiritual performance of Blind Lemon Jefferson's See That My Grave is Kept Clean.  David ""Honeyboy"" Edwards (at 88) still shows the world what acoustic Delta blues was all about with his performance of Gamblin' Man.  The incomparable Clarence ""Gateway"" Brown plays Okie Dokie Swamp like only he can.  Hubert Sumlin, despite having recently lost a lung, pours great energy into Killing Floor (although I thought singer David Johansen came off as hopelessly contrived).  Ruth Brown, Mavis Staple, and Natalie Cole (with a little help from Bill Cosby) make Men Are Just Like Streetcars one of the most entertaining songs of the night.  Natalie Cole, I have to say, can sure 'nough sing the blues, as she proves with her version of W.C. Handy's classic St. Louis Blues.

Robert Johnson is represented by Keb' Mo' performing Love in Vain, while Odetta wows the crowd with Lead Belly's Jim Crow Blues.  James ""Blood"" Ulmer (with Allison Kraus) takes us all the way back to 1930 with The Mississippi Sheiks' Sitting on Top of the World.  The incomparable Muddy Waters was well represented by Buddy Guy on I Can't Be Satisfied.  Buddy Guy, as far as I'm concerned, stole the whole show.  How important is this man to the blues and music in general?  He's the very nexus between Muddy Waters and Jimi Hendrix.  Later in the show, Guy returned to perform his own First Time I Met the Blues.  Then, after giving us some riffs of Hendrix's Red House, he is compelled to come back out to perform Hendrix's Voodoo Child with Angelique Kidjo.  Solomon Burke gets the crowd jumping with Turn on Your Love Light and Down in the Valley.  Last but not least, B.B. King puts the final exclamation point on this historic night, making Lucille wail on his classic Sweet Sixteen.

The younger performers feature some hits and misses.  Shemekia Copeland, who performs I Pity the Fool with Robert Cray, is incredible.  The Neville Brothers shine on Big Chief, Steven Tyler and Joe Perry bring their own style to I'm a King Bee, and Bonnie Raitt shows she belongs onstage with Coming Home.  I didn't particularly care for John Fogerty's rocked-up performance of Midnight Special, though, and Macy Gray (after appearing quite clueless at rehearsal) had a little too much fun with Big Mamma Thornton's Hound Dog.  I have nothing but disdain for Chuck D, I have to say; turning John Lee Hooker's Boom Boom into rap is bad enough, but this guy momentarily spoiled the whole evening by using the song to make a political statement.

Don't think of this concert as the blues' funeral.  Lightning in a Bottle is a celebration of all the greats who defined this uniquely American style of music.  The blues will almost surely never return to the heights of the old Delta and Chicago eras, but the classics will always be a part of us, and there is at least some hope (Shemekia Copeland, for sure)  on the horizon for its future.  One of the problems with the blues is the fact that so many people still haven't experienced it for themselves.  This DVD goes a long way toward solving that problem, and with any luck, it will inspire one or more young performers to follow in the giant footsteps of those celebrated here.",1119571200,,4438,4.720779220779221
2205270,4,B00078RPGW,"If you ever wanted to learn about the evolution of the Blues this is it!  Some of the greatest Blues artists that have survived are in this film.  It is part documentary, part performance film.  Some of the performances are exciting: B.B. King, Clarence Gatemouth Brown, Solomon Burke, Odetta, Natalie Cole, Ruth Brown, etc. are all so fabulous it makes you sick that you missed this great concert.  Unfortunately, there is one performance that this film could have done without.  Macy Gray was in way over her head and she may have felt it. Despite this error, the film guarantees a great time for all.",1119052800,,603,4.704761904761905
2205271,5,B00078RPGW,"This memorable concert was filmed at New York's Radio City Music Hall in February 2003. It was the start of the ""Year Of the Blues"". Martin Scorsese, who gave us the wonderful (but a bit controversial content-wise) series of Blues Films (which took over a year to be screened and available here in Australia) opens the show, after the Blues Year he was also a voice in ""Shark's tale""!

There is no denying that this is a memorable and well presented concert. Many of the greatest living Blues players are here as well as those we might refer to as marginal-transitional people with Blues interests. Some we don't get to hear, Robert Jr Lockwood and Jimmie Vaughan are seen, but not heard. the concert itself represents a musical journey through various Blues styles from African songs, to WC Handy, to music hall styles, women singers, the lone Juke Player right up through B.B. King and Hendrix and, yes, Chuck D trying to stop the Iraq Invasion with ""Boom Boom"" Rap!

This DVD is most enjoyable and a great and reasonably priced addition to one's music library. Highlights for me include B.B. King's story about ""Sweet Sixteen"" and his performance. Robert Cray's input, as usual is outstanding with his clean understated guitar work. David ""Honeyboy"" Edwards, who knew Robert Johnson, provides a rare self-penned tune (he mostly did covers during his career), Hubert Sumlin (who has just lost a lung!!; and was smoking in the interview!!!!; and who I got to meet in 1991) plays a great rendition of ""Killing Floor"" with the riff he made famous for Howlin' Wolf. Natalie Cole (a comeback?) does a great update of Bessie Smith's ""Saint Louis Blues""-reminds me a bit of Janis Joplin-remember she started out sounding like Aretha on ""This Will Be"". The tune with Natalie, the great Mavis Staples (who does a great version of Blind Lemon Jefferson's ""Make Sure My Grave's Kept Clean"") Ruth Brown and Bill Cosby ""Men Are Like Street Cars"" is a great humourous blues. It was horrible to hear the Ruth had suffered a stroke prior to this concert and was still superb (see more of this delightful lady in the ""Blues Story"" DVD).

Solomon Burke, who I just saw in Australia, was fabluous as usual. His singing is great and he sure knows how to work the crowd (like all great church inspired soul singers). Clarence  ""Gatemouth"" Brown was an awesome talent. This was probably his last recorded performance. His no pick guitar style was unique and classic. His playing is a highlight of the entire DVD!

Macy Gray does a great version of ""Hound Dog"" in the style of Big Mamma Thronton. It's interesting to see her at the rehearsal a bit perplexed about the whole thing and then transform on stage. Buddy Guy is Buddy Guy, he's great, out front, out of tune, and, to me, stands for what the Blues is all about. He does a rare acoustic version of ""I Can't Be Satisfied"" in dedication to his mentor Muddy Waters. He also does a bit of Jimi Hendrix's ""Red House""-this was great because if purists ran the show this would not have been done. I agree with the previous reviewers the rap, Aerosmith, John Fogarty and rock in general are farther from the blues than Jimi Hendrix, but in a show like this I can stomach anything, for one thing the band is so great.

Another highlight of this show is Odetta, the hippy Black folk singer from the 1960s. She does a great version of Leadbelly's ""Jim Crow Blues"" and even phrases like Leadbelly! A wonderful effort. The documentary footage between songs, the lighting and effects and the interviews are great. The bonus tracks are superb as well.
