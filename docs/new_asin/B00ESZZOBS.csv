While this DVD set looks pretty good for the most part, I'm a little lost as to why they skipped over 1994, 1995, 2000, 2002, 2004, and 2006 were skipped over, especially 2000, which offered some of the best matches and moments in 2000.

A few episodes I was hoping made this set were:

- The First Brand Extension Draft: 3/25/02

- The first episode of WWE Raw: 5/6/02

- The night after Wrestlemania X7: 4/2/01

- The night after the end of the Invasion: 11/19/01

- Kane unmasks: 6/23/03

- Eddie Guerrero Tribute Show: 11/14/05

They say that the DVD is uncut and unedited but that's a LIE. A few superstar theme songs were edited and dubbed over with a generic song (Undertaker's Rollin and Victoria's All The Things She Said). Some things on commentary were edited, certain reactions for superstars were edited and dubbed with either cheers or boos. And of course Chris Benoit's entrance as well as commentary on Benoit on the 2001 episode is heavily edited. Overall, this seems like an enjoyable DVD set nonetheless and is definitely one to add to your collection if you're a fan of WWE or Monday Night Raw",1380758400,21,12195,5.0503489531405785

Lets settle this once and for all because it'll be done in many reviews after this one. This set has many of peoples favorite Raw's missing and it's typical. I think they should have done 93-02 first then followed it by 03-current. Hell, I dare say if they did a set of just 98-01 it would have sold well. I like the set even though it forgets the early years of Raw like most sets. I guess the Best of Season 1 and 2 didn't sell well so they don't want to go there again. I purchased it and cannot wait for it.",1380672000,45,11601,5.0376372190277054

5942911,5,B00ESZZOBS,"I've been a wwf(e) fan since I was about 4 years old and have watched raw on Mondays since it's premiere in January of 1993. This set defines what raw is all about: great matches and memorable moments involving some of the greatest superstars ever from Stone Cold, The Rock, D-Generation X and the Brothers of Destruction in the attitude era, to the stars of today such as John Cena and Randy Orton. This set in my opinion is a must own for all wwe fans",1402531200,,453,4.27906976744186

5942925,5,B00ESZZOBS,"It lived up to the bill meaning getting 20 episodes of raw. Were they the best 20? No, but the majority of the episodes are worth the set. If you are fan of wrestling, it is a must have set that is worth the $ to get.

5942932,5,B00ESZZOBS,"I can't give a review on all the content yet. There's 12 discs! But what I can review is the quality of the box-set itself. Raw 20th Anniversary set has a thick glossy slipcase. Inside is basically a book with the same cover. There are 12-13 pages inside, with all the episodes. On the left will contain a picture that identifies with a moment on that disc and on the right is the disc itself inside the page (slipcase). On the slipcase will be the contents of the disc. The disc is easily removable and easy to slide back in. The pages are good enough quality and are basically standard cardboard DVD slipcovers. It was very easy to flip through the pages and find the episode I was looking for. I think overall it is an excellent design and much better than I expected. Good job WWE.

The video quality is slightly zoomed in it seems. The WWF/E logo is touching the corner of my TV screen, unlike other WWE dvd's.

All the content this set has is already posted, so I decided to review what is holding all the content. Thanks, and now it's time to watch some Raw episodes.",1386288000,4,1074,4.338308457711443
5942933,4,B00ESZZOBS,"I would of rated it a five star set, but the title is a little misleading with it saying ""Uncut & Unedited"". The opening segment from the March 2001 one episode featuring Chris Benoit and Kurt Angle is cut out. As well as Undertaker's ""Rollin"" theme is edited on the same episode. Chris Benoit's entrance in the March 2001 and Homecoming episodes are cut too and any commentary remarks toward him. I expected the ""Rollin"" theme to be edited, as well as positive remarks to be edited. But the ""Uncut & Unedited"" title is very misleading for this set. Especially since $60-70 isn't cheap for a DVD set.

To an extent the commentary remarks doesn't really bother me, neither does Undertaker's theme. Benoit's entrance and the Angle/Benoit promo does though. Personally, I don't really care for the episodes post-15th Anniversary. But that's just me and I'm sure others are a fan of them. I mainly bought the set for the earlier episodes anyways. Even with the faults I still like the set, but it's not perfect. Can't really expect perfection coming from WWE though.",1386201600,17,1062,4.771739130434782
5942934,5,B00ESZZOBS,"I feel very lucky to be able to purchase this set. I never would have imagined that WWE would release 20 full episodes of Raw in one collection. Yes it has a couple edits, even though this is described as Uncut. The aforementioned edits have to deal with Chris Benoit and some of the wrestlers entrance music, more specifically The Undertakers ""Rollin"" entrance that was preformed my Limp Bizkit. I can understand these cuts. Benoit is a black cloud for wrestling and the music was probably just licensed to WWE for a certain amount of time, which is now expired.

This collection comes in great packaging, even though the discs slip into cardboard slots which can scratch discs if not handled carefully. The package is pretty heavy duty and has some weight to it. WWE didn't skip on the packaging and chose quality material.

As for the shows themselves, they are all great in their own way. Any wrestling fan should find something they like in this set. Episodes run the gamut from all eras of the show and really provide a good overview on the last 20 years of the WWE. From comedy, shocking Stone Cold Stunners, smoking hot divas, epic matches, and even some sentimental moments, you can find it all on this set. I highly recommend this to any wrestling fan. 5 stars",1386115200,16,1270,4.615044247787611
5942935,1,B00ESZZOBS,Typical WWE. skips 93- early 96 some the best years in wrestling. i hate it everytime WWEE promotes something its always first episode.. then right to stone cold.,1386028800,4,162,4.821428571428571
5942936,2,B00ESZZOBS,"I'll give it two stars the episodes on here seem great and awesome to relive however, the price for it is redicilous 60 bucks seriously I got ufcs 100 greatest fights back in 2010 that's an 8 dis set could be 69 bucks like the raw set I got it for 25 bucks nice cheap price for a fun set. Hell I got the married with children 32 disc set for 45 bucks less than this. Wwe lower the price this isn't a wrestlemania anthology or anything. I'll buy it when the price lowers if it does otherwise I'll download all these episodes. Save your money people make wwe say we should lower the price maybe more people will buy then!",1385510400,11,619,4.12396694214876
