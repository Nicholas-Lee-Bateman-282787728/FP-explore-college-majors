8583475,2,B00CMJZUCA,"I ordered this laserdisc because I hoped it would be true widescreen and not a little box on my screen. I have this DVD and it looks like someone put a cardboard box on my screen. Why in hell do they master movies like this? Amazon Instant Video has a purchase option on the movie and it is widescreen and looks fantastic. Wake up Universal. Master this one properly or better yet, release it in blu-ray. This is a great movie and deserves better.",1390867200,,447,4.333333333333333
