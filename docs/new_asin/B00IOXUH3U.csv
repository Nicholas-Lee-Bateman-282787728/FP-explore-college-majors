6284513,5,B00IOXUH3U,"I was really surprised by how much I enjoyed this film. I'm not even much of a basketball fan, but the movie is more about the people behind the teams and their fans than the actual game, so I think it appeals to a wider audience even if you're not a big sports person in general. But if you are a sports/bball fan, then this is definitely the movie for you.",1432080000,,358,4.056338028169014
6284514,4,B00IOXUH3U,"Really enjoyed how entertaining this documentary was while kicking back doing my laundry... it's a good time watching really about the game... The film snobs and 1-star haters here might be too stoo-pid to appreciate the work that went into making this documentary thing, but I sure do. A great discovery of an ambitious independent film. Worth the time to watch and gets my thumbs up recommendation!",1432080000,,400,4.985074626865671

8644305,5,B00IOXUH3U,I grew up in eastern Kentucky and now live in Louisville.  I've seen it from both sides.  This is an excellent history of the basketball rivalry between UofL and UK in college basketball.  Great interviews and footage from years gone by.

8644306,2,B00IOXUH3U,"I liked how this movie shed light on a part of the country that is often overlooked.  However, although the movie touched on the segregation, it could have addressed it more directly.  Something about the film seems to hark on an era that divided our country long ago, which I found unsettling.
That being said, if you appreciate the history of collegiate basketball and are a NCAA fanatic, I think you would enjoy this film.",1483401600,,425,4.653333333333333
