The screenplay is boring the dubbing not good and just when you think it might be getting interesting ( leading lady disrobeing ) then that again fails to deliver. To some it up - -  if guests have overstayed their welcome , tell them you have a great new film , then put this on !!!",1205971200,7,389,4.1866666666666665
