The best clip is set in the late 1960s and deals with how the board of educatoin in New York tried to bring different types of children together dispite their cultural differences and the many types of immigrant famililes they came from. The othet ourstanding clip gives you a history of NBC Radio in the 1930s and 1940s - with nothing other than New York as the setting in common.
