8097386,4,B000CCKJCA,"Sir Robert King (David Calder) a rich oil tycoon and a friend of Bond is dispatched at MI6. Now Bond inherits the job of protecting King's daughter Elektra (Sophie Marceau) but what evil plot is he protecting her from? And will he succeed?

This is a formula Bond movie. It has all the toys and witticisms that make it Bond. You may have to get over Denise Richards' stereotype as the bug lady from ""Starship Troopers"" (1997). Good use of Judi Dench as M. I will always think of the real thing looking like her. Anyway the movie has all the twists and turns necessary to keep you guessing until the end. Each Bond actor brings with him a unique acting style and each is Bond.",1501891200,,675,4.357142857142857
