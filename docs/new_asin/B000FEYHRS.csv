8121603,5,B000FEYHRS,"I first saw this movie with my little buddy at the Saturday matinee when we were young kids.  We were thrilled with this magical story and were mesmerized by the Little Forrest Man and the special powers he possessed!  After seeing the film, my buddy and I often re-enacted the fire dance scenes and recited the little man's words verbatim while playing in the woods.  Well... one day I was bitten by the nostalgia bug and memories of the Little Forest Man (aka, Rumpelstiltskin) came flooding back to me!  I decided to search the internet to see if I could find the movie and sure enough, Amazon came through!  Less than a week later a brand new, unopened VHS tape was mine!  I blew the dust off the old VCR, popped in the tape and had a blast watching what was for so many years, merely a memory from my past!!!  Okay, by today's standards, the video quality leaves a bit to be desired but to me, that's all part of the nostalgic experience!  I plan to copy the tape to DVD soon to make sure this gem is preserved for many years to come!",1368316800,,1039,4.292307692307692
