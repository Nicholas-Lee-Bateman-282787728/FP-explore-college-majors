We sing the songs all day long! They finally came out with the dvds!!  You children are going to love it!",1170806400,6,276,4.46
8158160,5,B000KLQUNK,Used to be on PBS... my kids loved it.. Im not sure what happened to it.. it was never that big in Canada.,1397779200,,106,3.652173913043478
8158161,5,B000KLQUNK,Personally these are hands down the best shows on pbs... I remember watching these with my oldest son now eight when he was a tiny baby.. The music and characters drew all of us so much I memorized that birthday song for his first birthday and to this day still sing it him. Broke our hearts when they cancelled it. Now we can show his 14 mo old brother and he's getting into then add much as the rest of the family . Truly a great find and if you do buy it!!,1393977600,2,459,3.946236559139785
8158162,5,B000KLQUNK,"My daughter loved these when she was younger, and still watches them.  I'm saving them!  They are too precious to sell or donate, even though she has almost outgrown them.",1356566400,2,171,4.666666666666667
8158163,5,B000KLQUNK,My kids have always love this show and was sooo sad when the local PBS station stopped showing it.  I had searched other places to find it and although I did find some no place had a better price than amazon.com  and the disc even though it was used looked brand new out of the package I would definitely buy more..,1353110400,,315,4.147540983606557
8158164,5,B000KLQUNK,"My kids (3 & 5) really enjoy this DVD - it's one of our ""long trip"" DVDs. I appreciate that it's educational and entertaining without being obnoxious and repetitive. We have another Big Big World DVD and really love both of them. The songs are fun for the kids and aren't like nails on a chalkboard for us. There are some funny moments in the different episodes - even for adults.",1278460800,2,380,4.366197183098592
8158165,5,B000KLQUNK,Product was just as described. I would not have second thoughts about purchasing from this seller again. Excellent Everything!,1265155200,2,126,5.684210526315789
8158166,5,B000KLQUNK,"This DVD is very fun and it keeps my daughter's attention the entire time it is on...which says a lot being that she is 2 years old!  The characters are adorable and educational.  As a parent, I would recommend any ""It's a Big Big World"" DVD.  All of them are truly priceless.",1213488000,2,276,4.269230769230769
8158167,5,B000KLQUNK,"Great program for kids and not so silly that I can't watch it repeatedly too!  My 2 year old gets the most out of the songs, which are playable (back to back) outside the context of the program.  As she gets older, she will love the storyline too.  I love the simple and clearly stated lessons taught.",1200268800,3,301,4.245614035087719
8158168,5,B000KLQUNK,"My daughter is 11 months old and has LOVED It's a big big world since she was just a few months old.  We own evey dvd.  The things I love about the dvd are: It starts playing on its own so all you have to do is put it in the dvd player, the dvd has several episodes each with at least two songs each, there is a play songs only option in the menu, after the dvd is finished playing it starts again without prompting, it teaches children about nature.  There is nothing bad I would say about this dvd except I know just about every word by memory now.",1185753600,4,550,3.936936936936937
8158169,5,B000KLQUNK,"My 8 month old daughter absolutely loves this PBS show!  The DVD features over an hour of episodes and 5 or 6 different songs.  The characters, lessons of discovery and science, and music are all fantastic.  My daughter smiles, laughs and tries to interact w/ the characters while watching. I am so thankful that it this show is finally available on DVD.",1175731200,3,354,4.67741935483871
