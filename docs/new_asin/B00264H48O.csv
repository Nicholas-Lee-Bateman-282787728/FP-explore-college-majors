3850942,5,B00264H48O,"My family and I have been watching Rugrats since it first started, and we were delighted to find Amazon.com selling these made-to-order DVD sets of the first two seasons of the show. All the episodes are tremendously funny and entertaining and are presented nicely on three DVDs in their respective order of broadcasting. The first season especially brought back many great memories of how clever and imaginative quality animation can be. All in all, it's a great investment and well worth the money.",1247097600,,500,5.036144578313253
3850943,5,B00264H48O,I'm so thankful that this is finally on dvd!!!! I'm so glad this show is finally getting the respect it deserves!!! I will watch every episode over and over again! I just hope the other seasons become avaliable on dvd.,1246492800,2,218,4.475
3850944,5,B00264H48O,"Rugrats was my absolute favorite cartoon show when I was younger and I am thrilled that it is finally available on DVD.  The show itself easily gets 5 stars from me (well, the first few seasons at least, though it went downhill fast when they started adding characters, like Dil and especially Kimi, later on) so this review will mainly cover the quality of the DVD set and not the show itself.  I will just briefly touch on the quality of the cartoons.

For those who may not have seen the show, or the first season of it, the animation is MUCH rougher and shakier than in later seasons, but as always the writing is top-notch, and because of this the show appeals to all ages, not just the young kids it was intended for.  I believe that other reviewers have already sufficiently covered which episodes are on this set, so I won't waste the time or space covering it again.

Now then, onto the DVDs:

This 3-disc set is packaged in a very generic, standard plastic DVD case.  Nothing fancy, but it certainly gets the job done. Same basic story with the package art.  It's very generic, but it does represent the series just fine so I really have no complaints about it.  One VERY small problem I have with the art, though, is that, being the obsessive person that I am, I wish they had used the classic Rugrats logo rather than that slightly different new one (which has never been used in the actual show, only on products like books, toys, and DVDs).

The DVDs are made to order on demand by Amazon.com, and therefore are DVD-R formatted.  I understand that some people have had trouble playing the discs in previous sets like this, but they all work just fine on all of the DVD players in my house.  The product overview says that they may not play on recorders or PC drives, but they play just fine on my recorder and on my Mac.  I do not own a Blu-Ray player, so I cannot say whether or not they play on one, but I imagine that if it is DVD-R compatible, than these discs would play there, as well.

The picture quality of the episodes is fantastic. Honestly it looks better here than it ever did on Nickelodeon.  There are a few odd things going on with the color at times but that is part of the original episode, not this DVD.  The sound is as good as it ever was for this show.  One complaint I have with the presentation is that the opening theme sequence is on each disc only once.  Each episode has the complete ending credits intact, though.

Being the burn on demand set that it is, there are NO extras whatsoever. Personally, this doesn't bother me as I usually use DVD extras once, at most.  I understand that some people fully expect all DVDs to have extras, but for me, it just isn't that big of a problem.  That said, it would have been nice if they had included the pilot episode of the series. (Note: the pilot HAS already been released on DVD, though, on the Decade in Diapers compilation).

Overall, I would have been happy to take Rugrats on DVD in any form, so buying this was a no-brainer for me.  If you are expecting DVD extras, well...don't.  But the episodes themselves are presented well.  I wish they had included the pilot, but since I can get it elsewhere it doesn't bother me too much.  I grew up watching Rugrats and I am very happy to finally own a complete season set on DVD. I hope they get all the rest of the pre-Dil episodes out soon, as well.  Bottom line: if you are like me and grew up watching this show, you will be very satisfied with this DVD set.",1244678400,28,3498,4.325153374233129
3850945,5,B00264H48O,"I cannot even begin to express how joyed I am to have the 1st season of Rugrats on DVD! I have waited for this for YEARS! And I never thought that they would come out with them! When I saw that this was an Amazon exlusive, I literally freaked out. Rugrats was, and still is, my all time favorite cartoon. I watched this as a kid in the 90's. I remember being either 5 or 6 years old when I first started watching this. Now, 15 years later, being 20, I STILL love them! I am absolutely in love with all the old episodes before Dil came along. After Dil, the show kinda went down. I haven't seen some of the ones on the 1-4 seasons in years. Now I can watch them anytime I want and pass them on to my children! The DVD's work great so far. I've been playing them on my Xbox 360 so I don't know how they are on other DVD players. This is a must buy for old school 90's Rugrats lovers! You won't be disappointed!

I chose Super Saver Shipping and this product got here in less than 4 days. I was VERY impressed. Thank-you Amazon for your speediness and thank-you for allowing us fans to buy this wonderful nostalgic classic cartoon!",1244160000,7,1128,4.127272727272727
3850946,5,B00264H48O,"This is such a classic and defining show of the nineties, and while it's a shame to not see a proper release of the show on DVD, I'm glad for the opportunity to at least own the episodes in chronological order on these Made On Demand DVD-R's. This set collecting the first season contains the following thirteen episodes from 1991-1992:

1  Tommy's First Birthday
2  Barbeque Story / Waiter, There's A Baby In My Soup
3  At The Movies / Slumber Party
4  Baby Commercial / Little Dude
5  Little Miss Lovely / Tommy At Bat
6  Ruthless Tommy / Moose Country
7  Grandpa's Teeth / Momma Trauma
8  Real Or Robots / Special Delivery
9  Candy Bar Creep Show / Monsters In The Garage
10  Weaning Tommy / Incident In Aisle Seven
11  Touchdown Tommy / The Trial
12  Fluffy Vs. Spike / Reptar's Revenge
13  Graham Canyon / Stu-Makers' Elves

Having now watched all the episodes on DVD I can say that the audio and video quality is not something you should be worried about when buying these Made On Demand sets. I am very uptight when it comes to the quality of the things I own and I can say that all the episodes were presented in the same, if not better than, quality they originally aired. My only issue as far as any of the Amazon Made On Demand sets is that being a purist I'd like the opening theme to play before every episode and not just the first one on each disc, but that's a very minor issue.

I personally had no issue playing the DVD-R type discs on any of my DVD player's or even on my Sony DVD Recorder. I have purchased several different Nickelodeon series (Doug, Hey Arnold & Rugrats) on Amazon 'MOD' sets now and had no issue with the picture or sound quality on any of them and they have all played fine on my DVD player's.

It feels like we've walked fifteen miles uphill both ways for even the chance to own these episodes on DVD. Just by reading the names of these episodes memories from my childhood came flooding back. I hope that someday Nickelodeon or someone will release these episodes in proper season sets with original artwork and special features, but for now I had given up hope for the chance to own these episodes on DVD at all and I'll take what I can get. Here's hoping that Amazon will release more seasons of Rugrats and my other favorite nineties shows on these sets. Thanks for your time.

*For those interested I've included episode summaries in my comments section to avoid cluttering the review page. Thanks.",1241308800,80,2443,4.3791574279379155

There are no special features of any sort, not even the unaired pliot (making YouTube the only way to watch it). It's not even a real DVD - merely a burn-on-demand DVR. In other words, besides the high picture quality of the episodes, there is absolutely no reason to buy this instead of just simply watching the episodes on websites like WatchCartoonOnline or KissCartoon instead. And before everybody jumps all over me and says I'm promoting piracy, I'm not. I just think if Nick wants us to buy DVDs of its shows, they need to give us more incentive to do so than just throwing the master tapes of the episodes on a DVD and calling it a day. It's a shame, too, since I'm a fan of Rugrats and would liked to have seen some making-of videos, or storyboards, or something.",1446768000,2,904,4.451807228915663

I never missed an episode growing up, because it was/is that good!",1419897600,,378,4.611940298507463
3851187,5,B00264H48O,"I have to say, I received this particular season as a Christmas present in December of 2013, and I'm just getting around to reviewing it now, but I must say, excellent season! In season 1 of Rugrats, we see Tommy celebrate his first birthday, we see the gang go to the movies for the first time, Tommy thinks his dad is a robot, the babies celebrate Halloween, and the Pickles take a vacation to the Graham Canyon, woops? I meant to say, Grand Canyon. We're exposed to Reptar and the Dummi Bears for the first time, as well as some of the popular merchandise for Reptar like Reptar Bars in the Candy Bar Creep Show episode, and Reptar Cerial in the Incident in Isle Seven episode, and we see Tommy thrown in a little miss lovely contest, dressed up as a girl. This is also the only season where we see Tommy go on some adventures solo, without the other Rugrats by his side, this is apparent in the following episodes.
Waiter, there's a Baby in my Soup
Little Dude
Baseball
Ruthless Tommy
Mama Trauma
Special Delivery
Incident in Isle Seven

And I'll admit, while there aren't as many episodes in this season that I'd say are my all time favorites, it did present several good episodes, like The Trial, Touchdown Tommy, and Moose Country. So, if you're either a fan who's always grown up with Rugrats, or, you're discovering them for the first time, then start with this season, as it puts a lot of things into perspective within those first 13 episodes.

I'm kind of sorry there aren't any bonuses on any of the seasons I've received so far, I personally think had they been able to include some special features on season 1, a good thing might have been the ability to watch some of these earlier episodes with audio commentary done by the producers, as I've been lucky to find this on some other TV shows I've collected, so that would have been nice to see with Rugrats, and maybe some Rugrats trivia games, and personally, I think instead of releasing Tommy and the Great White Thing as a bonus on the Decade in Diapers DVD, they should have released it on this 3 disc season 1 set, or waited and released it on this 3 disc season 1 set, as it was the unaired piolot, that got Rugrats off the ground, and crawling with a series.",1419724800,2,2232,4.428223844282239

Unfortunately, I was very disappointed to find out that there were no closed captions.  I bought this for my girlfriend for her birthday.  She loved watching Rugrats growing up as a kid.  My girlfriend is Deaf so she needs closed captions.  When I contacted Amazon, all they would tell me is that the company,CreateSpace, made the DVDs.  They told me they didn't have the equipment to provide closed captions and was afraid that adding it would violate their license agreement.  Closed captions is required by law so the idea of violation of license rights is ridiculous (especially since Nickelodeon values equality for Deaf people as you can see from their show Nick News).  I contacted Viacom to make them aware.  They responded to say they'll do what they can but it's mostly up to CreateSpace.  All people should be able to enjoy their entertainment.  Amazon and CreateSpace needs to provide equality.  Maybe if enough of us will address this to Amazon and CreateSpace, they will make the changes.  For now, only time can tell.

3851206,4,B00264H48O,"So hard to believe that out of all of the classic Nicktoons, they still have not released the official Rugrats seasons. This is as close as we've come so far. It's a Made On Demand DVD, and honestly do not expect it to look anything better than homemade. The DVD menus lack animation or music. It looks like someone downloaded a desktop background, slapped some Rugrats font on it, and half-***ed the menu out of Roxio or some other home use software. The DVD case isn't bad, but still looks homemade. When arriving it came in a Manila envelope without protection so damage may occur in shipping.

That's the bad. There is good though in this. The quality of the episodes is nice. Let's be honest with ourselves, up until now we've only had VHS copies we've recorded from the past or episodes we've found online (I won't judge you) and the episodes are riddled with horrid Nick splashes in the corner, obtrusive overlays for upcoming episodes, or commercials. About ten to twelve minutes of commercials per episode. This is none of that mess. It's great quality 4:3 episodes on DVD. Sure you could download the seasons from Amazon or iTunes probably cheaper than the DVD, but then you have the dreaded mess of ensuring you have and will continue to have to storage for it.

Overall, for what it is its a good buy at a steep price. But who can put a price tag on nostalgia? I've found even today's generation of kids can enjoy this show, and as for us adults it is an experience strolling down memory lane through the days of yore with Rugrats.",1414627200,,1543,4.526881720430108

3851260,5,B00264H48O,"Phooey to Shout Factory for not having home video rights to this legendary Nicktoon, nor its spin-off show All Grown Up (I asked them about it myself). But in May of 2014, the entire 2nd and 9th seasons finally came to DVD, and all 9 seasons drastically went down in price to under $20 each, making them a lot more affordable and accessible to me and my big sister. Her all-time favorite Nicktoon has always been Rugrats, no others as far as I can remember, as mine is a triumvirate of long-running smash hits; Rugrats itself and SpongeBob and Digimon, in no particular order. Until now, I always held back on getting Rugrats on DVD here due to their once-ludicrous prices (like SpongeBob's first 5 seasons used to be), and seasons 2 and 9 being incomplete sets and still at ludicrous prices. This is the season that started something big for Nick, on top of Doug and Ren & Stimpy also debuting on the same historic day; August 11th, 1991. Rugrats remained with Nick, and still does, when Doug switched from a Nicktoon to a Disneytoon, & Ren and Stimpy became an unbearable adults-only cartoon for Spike TV; both decisions made Billy West angry, who played the stars of both shows before Disney and Spike got ahold of them. But Rugrats is the one that truly stands the test of time above all the other Nicktoons that have ever been, or ever will be, in terms of how old & cherished it is. All 13 chunks of shows of the 1st season are in this set, including the debut episode my sister always hated (I can't imagine why); Tommy's First Birthday. Sadly, the show's real pilot episode's not in here, nor in any other season set, only in the Decade in Diapers DVD still in stores. Another thing that bugs me about this set, at least in my copy, during the ending & credits of The Trial, the picture and sound get buggy or glitchified. Still another bit that bugs me is the show's original Halloween episodes (Candy Bar Creep Show and Monster in the Garage); Nick and Paramount somehow neglected to add them to the Halloween & Holiday Celebration releases in 2004 & 2011. Thankfully, they're both in the 1st season set! There's a lot of fun memories to recall in each of these sets, for fans of all ages, even though me and my family still haven't seen every last episode of Rugrats yet, when I made this review. Since the beginning, Tommy's been the big-hearted leader, Chuckie the relentless scaredy-cat, Phil and Lil the fun-loving, bug-eating, argumentative twins; all of their language is baby-talk in ""growed ups'"" ears or those of any big kid or teens, or ""aminals"" like Spike or Fluffy, but not to the TV audience, and Angelica being worse than a ""mean widdle kid"" to all of them, to quote Red Skelton. The picture and sound are very much as they were, as when they were on Nick, sans commercials, bumpers, or the theme to most episodes except the first ones on each disc, very much like SpongeBob's DVD sets, only the end credits remain intact for every chunk of Rugrats shows, but no closed-captioning to be spoken of. (Every episode of seasons 2 and 9 have their themes intact plus closed-captioning.) Better to have Rugrats in seasons sets on DVD-R discs, than not to have them on DVD at all, as with Warner Archive releases in general (aside from the movie trilogy & the 2 Tales From the Crib movies that came to DVD after the original series ""went bye-bye forever""). Believe it or not, all 3 of my favorite Nicktoons ran new episodes from the summer of 1999 to the summer of 2003, though Digimon belonged with Fox or Disney at the time & aired only on UPN from fall '02 to summer '03. If you're wanting to add Rugrats to your collection, for you or for Rugrats of your own, now's the best time to get any or all 9 seasons of Rugrats on DVD! All 3 shows' movies sold separately (in Digimon's case, its 4 TV movies still aren't on DVD in the USA). ""Hang on to your diapies, babies, we're goin' in!"" It's time to ""baldly"" go where no baby's gone before! By the way, the first season is a 3-disc set of all-single-layered discs. Seasons 2 and 9 contain all-dual-layered DVD-R discs, the complete sets that is.",1402444800,6,4114,4.493991989319092

The case rattled when I opened the box and all of the plastic fittings inside were broken. This means that at least one and sometimes two, of the discs inside the case are free to slide around whenever it's moved. The third disc in particular seems a little scratched and there is a slight issue with one of the episodes because of this. Luckily the small amount of static only occurs during the last few seconds of an episode and the credits.

Maybe it's because they don't use the early splat anymore. But anyway I hope Shout Factory can reissue the BOD sets to DVD. If not I'll get them.

The picture quality it just like it is when it aired which is better than some digitally remastered DVDs. My only problem is that the series intro is only played 1 time on each DVD and then episodes go straight to the title card from then on.",1333670400,4,590,4.130434782608695

I took it out of the player and noticed that there are some minor scratches on it. Then I checked the other discs and they too were scratched also. I don't know who is at fault for giving me product that isn't up to a considerable standard!!! I hope others haven't found the same issue and that I'm the only (lucky me) one to have this issue. I did take the time, I had to, and got each disc cleaned from a DVD cleaning specialist.  I hope it can be fixed so others can enjoy them right away!

A side note: The picture quality is very lacking. I would not say it's 1080p what so ever. I do know that this is the ONLY way to watch a favorite show of mine.  They have it from a Direct to DVD sort of thing. My discs didn't look the same as it does in the picture from somebody else, it's the same color just doesn't have Chuckie or Angelica on it. I'm pleased to have the opportunity to enjoy a great show from my youth!!!",1327017600,,1295,4.130952380952381

Sure, they didn't do any remastering, so the picture quality is a bit soft, but who cares ? We weren't going to get the show any other way except CreateSpace, since Nick doesn't care about the huge amount of fans that made them what they are. They either start a really popular show, then stop putting it out. Or they never even start the show in the first place. If you like Rugrats, get the dvd sets.",1283126400,6,521,4.326530612244898

3851344,5,B00264H48O,"As a kid growing up in the 90's watching this show was an everyday thing.
I liked the earlier seasons much more than the later ones, and when i found out that amazon sold the first two seasons on DVD...i had to order it, and i'm so glad i did.
It has all the episodes from season 1, they look amazing (just as good when it was airing on tv, if not better)
Once you place the dvd into a player, it goes straight to the DVD main menu, no FBI warnings,etc (which i really like, all dvd's should do this)
All you see is a ""PLAY ALL, and EPISODES"" selection. There are no DVD extras on this disc, but this is no problem at all for me, but if you were expecting extras with this DVD i wouldnt buy it, but if your like me and just wanted this show on DVD, then this is a no brainer.

THANK YOU AMAZON, for making the deal with Nickelodeon, us fans know that Nickelodeon was never going to make the DVD's themselves but thankfully you guys (amazon) did.",1253836800,6,945,4.053475935828877
3851345,4,B00264H48O,"Season one of the Rugrats on DVD? Awesome! There are few problems with this set. For one, the case isn't what I think a season-DVD should be. Instead of being a paper box, it's plastic. It just isn't what I'm used to. That's the minor thing. The bigger thing that is sort of unfortunate is the price. $29 for 13 episodes is just a little too expensive. Those two reasons (mainly the second) are why I give this a four out of five rating. Other than that, keep them coming!",1250899200,,472,4.2555555555555555

3851348,4,B00264H48O,"Rugrats is an animated series that aired on Nickelodeon for many years, following the lives of baby Tommy and his three friends as they go on adventures and interact with the world around them. As a child growing up in the nineties, Rugrats was one of the first animated shows on Nickelodeon to which I was exposed, and I have so many memories from the series. Needless to say, I was excited when I heard that Rugrats (and other older Nickelodeon shows) would be released on DVD.

Honestly I was a little disappointed when I heard that the seasons wouldn't be released on regular DVD's, but instead DVD-R's. Nonetheless, the DVD's play well in most of my DVD players (including my laptop drive, which is a pleasant surprise considering the case says that the DVD's won't play in PC drives). There was one DVD player in my house that had trouble reading the disc and displaying picture (a Panasonic dual DVD-VHS player), but I don't use that one nearly as much, so I would not worry too much about not being able to play the DVD's.

The audio and video sounds about the same as it did when the series aired on Nickelodeon, and I didn't expect any more or less. It's a classic show, and (at least for the first season) the animation shows its age a little bit. Also, having watched most of the early seasons (1-5), I can't say this is my favorite season, but there are many episodes which I love, including ""At the Movies"", ""Momma Trauma"", and ""Touchdown Tommy"", and I like the rest of the episodes in this set even if I don't love them. However, the DVD's don't offer much else in the way of special content - you are getting the episodes and that's it (but that's all I really wanted anyway).

So should you buy this set? It depends on your situation. If you're looking to get you or your children's feet wet with Rugrats, this is a great, inexpensive set to start out with, considering you are getting more than four hours of great content. If you used to watch this show as a kid but only want to get one season, look at the episode guides on the Internet and the list of episodes on this set, and decide if this set has the episodes you liked the most. If you're a hardcore Rugrats fan like me, don't hesitate to get this set, as I highly doubt that the full seasons will be released in any other form.

All considered, you cannot go wrong with this collection: Rugrats is a funny and unique series that awakens the imagination in both kids and adults - it's the perfect show to watch as a family. Each episode is its own unique adventure, so you don't really need to worry about watching the episodes in any particular order. If you never had the opportunity to watch Rugrats or wish to share the experience with your children, take advantage of this great offer!",1247529600,21,2767,4.419607843137255

For their extra costs online I was extremely angry to see the screen at 4:3 aspect. That's the small blocked screen. If I record their shows they are in the full widescreen. I don't know if the shows are cropped for this reduction but sure am mad. Dont get these online! As for the dvd I won't know.
