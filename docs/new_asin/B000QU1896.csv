8197323,3,B000QU1896,"I stumbled upon this vhs in a goodwill of all places. It appears to be an ex-rental. I had never heard of it, but I've always been a horror fan, and have a soft spot for slashers as I grew up on them. Most people will probably never encounter this movie, even if it gets a dvd/bluray release. It's right on par with movies like graduation day, and slaughter high. The general bones of a slasher are there, including the twist of who the killer turns out to be. The kills are all pretty much done with a javelin, as the movie centers around a group of kids in athletics, presumably training for the olympics, One by one picking off, obligatory nudity, sub-par acting, and corny jokes all in tact. If you're a fan of cheesy slashers, or just wanna watch 'em all, you may actually enjoy this. I've seen better for sure, but I've seen much much worse. It was a neat little treat, especially since I only paid a dollar for it.",1335744000,5,921,4.2988505747126435
