7776746,5,B01H4EXPFQ,Tons of great information about autism for anyone that wants to learn more about it. I like the music and voice over too.  I learned a lot from watching this film. That statistics are very scary and the beginning is a good refresher for those that do not know anything anout autism at all. The middle and end are quite scary when you consider the rates are going up every year!,1473465600,,377,4.309859154929577
7776747,1,B01H4EXPFQ,"I'm only 13 minutes in, and I honestly don't think I'll be able to finish watching this.  The first 5 minutes is just nonsense and credits rolling by.  Once the documentary gets started, it is simply a bunch of visuals of print outs, charts, and graphs flashing on the screen with unrelated sound bites playing together.  There are no people shown.  There are shaky clips of hands, arms, necks, and kids moving around.  But we do not see visuals of people speaking, with the exception of some clips pulled from other sources.  Despite the fact that this was made sometime after 2014 and they make reference to the DSM 5, they still discuss Asperger's Syndrome and include it in the visuals, even though it was removed.  Very confusing for someone who is not familiar with this disorder.  And mixed in with this train wreck are overly dramatic statements and visuals of tornados and other disasters about how the government is not alarmed about autism.

Spoiler alert: I skipped through to the end, and the format doesn't change.  Take a hard pass on this one.  It's like a 6th grader played around with her parent's video making equipment and made a PSA for a school project.",1473465600,8,1175,4.682926829268292
7776748,1,B01H4EXPFQ,"Cost of Autism.
  (2015)

  Visually very annoying, this documentary flashes charts of statistics and newspaper headlines about Autism rates on the screen at such a fast pace I cannot read half of the words before another chart flashes on the screen. I do not watch a video to read! They should have a narrator speak the words, then on the screen print the reference being quoted.
  Then they superimpose several charts of statistics over a moving picture that has nothing to do with what they are referencing. Visually this is almost painful to watch. None of the charts are readable because of how briefly they are on the screen, then the constant motion of the background is so annoying I almost turned it off in the first 5 minutes. Then they make it even more annoying by superimposing 1 chart over another. This is just a jumbled mess of chaotic visuals thet says nothing.
  :5:15 into the film we finally get a newscasters voice stating thet Autism is a neurological abyss with no known cure. While this crap is being spewed, the screen shows extreme close-ups of someones shirt-sleeve wiggling, with more charts of statistics superimposed over it, in such extreme close-up it cuts off 1/3 of the actual charts. Thus we do not even know what the charts are about!
  At :7:00 it finally gets started, giving us a condensed batch of symptoms defining what Autism is. Then they present us with the rate of increase over the years, according to the CDC.
  They state thet part of the reason for the drastic increase in diagnosis is the changing of the criteria for it in the DSM 5.
  I agree, for I was blatantly Autistic all through school and no one had a clue what Autism even was. I diagnosed myself at the age of 45. If I were a child today, it would be immediately recognized and diagnosed because the diagnostic criteria has changed.
  The documentary goes on to talk about the insurance industry, and how Autism Insurance does not even exist in some states. Of course the only thing insurance will pay for is the officially-endorsed ABA, which is evil.
  We see politicians discuss how tax money should be spent, some wanting to cut all funding to anything Autism related, and some simply expressing frustration over the amount of disinformation thet is out there on the subject.
  Then it goes into the subject of vaccines, and how in the USA a child is expected to received an injection of 6 diseases every 6 months for years to come.
  A Homeland Security bill included provisions to protect vaccine manufacturers from lawsuits. Homeland Security???
  Next they tell us about Mercury, where it comes from, and the ways it gets into our bodies. It suggest there may be a connection between Mercury poisoning and Autism.
  Then they show us how which pesticides affect babies in which trimester.
  The soundtrack is so annoying; it is occasionally jolting to such extent I cannot read the screen. They also strobe us in the eye with white flashes between scenes, apparently to hold the attention of idiots, or hypnotize the viewer, or even trigger seizures. It only makes me wince.
  While this visual irritation is going on, a government official states thet he has 17 grandchildren, 13 of whom cannot digest Gluten.
  Then we see some good news: Since Ronald Reagan, every President has signed into law specific acts addressing Autism.
  Of course there were other bills passed too; e.g., tax dollars being used to study why lesbians are obese, why Chinese prostitutes drink alcohol, and the stress levels of shrimp walking on treadmills.
  More strobing me in the eye with white flashes.
  Projections are made thet at the rate we are going, by 2025 50% of all children will be Autistic. I believe it.
  So all of this is information we have heard before; nothing new in this documentary. The only thing new here is thet it was presented in the most irritating way I have seen yet - visual and auditory torture, which made it barely tolerable to sit through.

8764693,3,B01H4EXPFQ,"This documentaries negative aspects were overshadowed by the information being presented to make Autism and its increasing prevalence known to all that are willing to be enlightened. After reading Sabrina Penelope's post, I wondered how bad could this film be if the message of this movie is awareness. The film is low budgeted look and feels, making it a bit harder to watch this documentary in the same way that one would view a higher funded film. This movie exposes various significant findings of autism. I conduct gut-brain & links to autism research. I enjoy seeing and hearing individuals who are also a part of this epidemic. What I did not find pleasant about this documentary is the vocal cues of the narrator when discussing the cost of autism socio-economic aspects. The narrator's vocal inflections inferred that autism was the problem. Where autism is resolute of many factors environmental, genetic, and so on plays a role. This film also made it seem like there should be a 'cure' for autism. Apparently, the neurology impairments that autism spectrum disorder and the many ways this condition presents itself was not understood by the person who wrote the narrator monolog. Some damage that's done can not be 'cured,' management is the solution. The problem is solving some of the factors that play a role in the development of ASD. The film did offer some interesting findings on bills written to research autism. This movie had many great truths, but some of its messages did not convey the point of awareness. The cost is the cost of any condition that is increasing in prevalence. The issue/problem is not the patients and their families financial burden. The issue/problem is getting to the bottom of why this is occurring at the vastly high rates. In my opinion.",1491004800,2,1786,4.93687707641196

8764695,5,B01H4EXPFQ,"For those looking for more information, this is a great film. I notice all the negative reviews, which seem to be more negativity around the fact that they don't agree with what the film has to say not with how the film is made, motivated me to provide a positive review. I have no complaints about this film-5 stars.",1490227200,,317,4.389830508474576
8764696,1,B01H4EXPFQ,I wish I could give it ZERO stars. This is pointless to watch.,1489536000,,62,3.8461538461538463
8764697,1,B01H4EXPFQ,"So annoying.  It's just a bash against big business and vaccines.  Very misleading.  They say how expensive it is to educate ASD kids.  They need a special education teacher (true) they need Para professionals (true) they said you have to hire occupational therapist,  speech therapist,  physical therapist, scool nurse to give them meds...this is where it's misleading. You can't blame the cost of specialist on Autistic units, these specialists already exist in the school system for all kids with special needs.

Watching this is also visually annoying, the flashing of random statistics can give you seizures.",1487980800,4,613,5.322916666666667

8764699,1,B01H4EXPFQ,"This was a terrible documentary that cited junk science publications, such as Natural News. This documentary, if you can call it that, hops on the anti-vaccine bandwagon and makes claims about mercury in vaccines, even though Thimerosal hasn't been used in the childhood vaccines since 2001. The visuals of this documentary are that of a high school project or maybe even lower.
Definitely should be a hard pass on this pseudo-science documentary.",1483401600,10,447,5.222222222222222
