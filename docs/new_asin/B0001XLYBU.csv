2042721,5,B0001XLYBU,"I saw this film while living in Ireland, and it blew me away. Colin Farrell's performance is great, none of this pretty boy stuff, using his real accent and playing a really believable character from Dublin. The seperate story lines weave so effortlessly together. I think that some of the humor is more understandable if you have knowledge of Irish culture, but anyone can really get a kick out of this great film. I'm so glad it's out on DVD now! I've been waiting too long. Also, Shirley Henderson is amazing in this role, she is such a versatile actress.

By the way, some of the lads tried the brown sauce in tea, and it didn't turn out so good. I don't recommend it!",1098144000,21,672,4.419354838709677
2042722,4,B0001XLYBU,"Saw this film playing at some second rate movie theater for around a dollar or so. And for the record, I love second rate movie theaters.

Im also becoming a fan of Cillian Murphy after watching him in Danny Boyle's ""28 Days Later"", am accustomed to seeing Colin Farrell here and there, remember seeing Shirley Henderson and Kelly MacDonald in ""Trainspotting"", and Colm Meaney usually plays interesting characters in all his films. I also drink lots of Guinness, so I figured I'd give this a try.

What I saw was a film based on multiple stories tied together by chance meetings, irony, stupidity, and just plain old luck. Each little scenario affected the entire picture in one way or another. This type of plot and storyline has been done many many times. Some films have had great success and fun with it (""Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels"", ""Run Lola Run"", for example) and some didn't really work, or had too much going on (""Happenstance""). Since the plot is more or less recycled and cliched, the film's success or failure depends mostly on the performances, the characters, and the crazy twists and turns.

With that said, this film was pretty enjoyable, silly at some points, but overall well done. The talent I mentioned above all acted well, especially Colin Farrell, who seemed to be really free and relaxed speaking...the way he normally speaks, I guess. The characters were also interesing enough to keep everything flowing smoothly. Irish accents are fun, too, even though once in a while a few lines of dialogue are nearly impossible to understand. I don't know an overly large amount about the Irish culture, but everything seemed basically believeable. I do listen to Clannad and go to pubs, though, so that earned me some points. The environments were beautiful, from crowded downtown scenes to pubs to the rolling green hills. A lot of the humor I found highly entertaining, although I can see where others may not, because some of it is borderline evil humor. The music fit well, with both UK and Irish artists playing in the background. Colin Farrell's version of ""I Fought the Law"" is fun, too, and is definitely a worthy remake, right up there with The Clash, Dead Kennedys, and Mike Ness versions.

I really liked the Irish twist to the fimiliar plot, and the characters were fun, along with the brown sauce in the coffee and all the Guinness being consumed. I don't know whatll be on the DVD when it arrives in October, but Ill still get it. I encourage you to check out this film.",1093910400,35,2510,4.7368421052631575
2042723,5,B0001XLYBU,This movie is just fantastic. About 11 different stories that all tie together. The acting is superb and I'd say this may be one of colin farrells best movies. The plot keeps you paying attention and it also has some very humorous scenes in it. Check out this movie. Ive been waiting so long for it to be released on DVD.,1093219200,10,321,4.278688524590164
2042724,4,B0001XLYBU,"I've read elsewhere about people complaining of Intermission's ""juvenile humor"" and, yeah, there's certainly a fair bit of that.  But that's overcome by the realness with which writer Mark O'Rowe and Director John Crowley have imbued these 11 intertwined stories that have been crashed together for a very enjoyable ride.
Performances of note:
Kelly Macdonald - I just finished being enchanted by her in the six-part BBC mini 'State of Play'.  Adorable and talented (when I'm not perplexed by that Glaswegian accent).
Colin Ferrell - Turns on a dime in the film's opening shot; it's a stunner and it sets the pace for the entire movie.  His riff on 'brown sauce in coffee' (see the movie to understand!) had me laughing for days (not an exaggeration)
Colm Meaney - Yet another film he walks away with.  His self-conscious portrayal of street detective Jerry Lynch is a perfect mix of braggadocio, insecurity and (unknowing) humor.  The little scene where 'Lynch' overturns a table in anger - but checks to see who's watching first - is a wonderful little touch by Meaney.
Cillian Murphy - Mesmerizing eyes.  And the spoke that turns at least three of these stories.
...and many, many others (Shirley Henderson, for example, deserves some kudos too for a *very* unglamorous role).
Make sure you stick around for the credits to hear Colin Ferrell's raucous rendition of ""I Fought the Law.""",1085616000,11,1387,4.956896551724138
2042725,5,B0001XLYBU,"This film is a small Irish story but so complex & filled with such brilliant characters, it should appeal to anyone with a bright mind. Colin Farrell, the most well-known actor in this film, plays a criminal who wants to settle down & buy lovely kitchen utilities. There's a couple just broken up who keep running into each other; the guy love-sick, the girl sick of love. The unattractive but sweet fellow who gets into it with a furious, ditched wife but ends up happy. The oddly funny cop who wishes for Fame but commits infamy. We both LOVED this movie & will buy it as soon as it's available.",1084233600,,597,4.4363636363636365
2042726,5,B0001XLYBU,"Colin Farrell (Lehiff) sheds the outward patina of glamour and the unnatural adoption of an American accent, in this edgy dramedy, directed by John Crowley with an eager and roving eye: aimed at capturing the stuff that makes us human and susceptible to folly.
In fact, except for about 2 minutes in ""Phone Booth,"" Farrell has never been more human, likable and sexy since his debut in ""Tigerland.""
But ""Intermission"" is an ensemble piece peopled with actors (particularly Shirley Henderson) who continually seem about to fall yet somehow always avoid the big cesspool of doom and destruction. And this is what gives ""Intermission"" its propulsion and interest: we like these people and care about what they care about and more importantly, we want them to be happy. In tone this film reminds me very much of the much neglected, ""Happy Accidents"" another absurd comedy-drama directed by Brad Anderson.
Mark Rowe has written a script of such fierce disrespect towards everything and John Crowley directs with his tongue so resolutely and firmly planted in his cheek that ""Intermission"" turns out to be one of the most refreshingly astringent and invigorating movies...ever.",1083542400,7,1171,5.168421052631579

Irrespective of my English surname, I'm of Irish descent, and have visited Ireland several times. Never, ever did I encounter people of this caliber, even in Dublin bars and nightclubs.

2042737,5,B0001XLYBU,"This is the perfect independent film. Characters who can't win get together and create the most imperfect crime ever. Colin Farrell's character (Lehiff) is a not too intelligent thug with a penchant for punching women in the face. He is also inordinately fond of woks. His nemesis (Colm Meany's character Jerry Lynch) is a rouge cop/wanna-be TV star obsessed with mystical Celtic bands like Clannad. Lynch teams up with a would-be rough-side-of-the-streets documentarian
Cillian Murphy plays a frustrated grocery clerk who, with his pal (played by David Wilmot) get tempted into a robbery scheme by bus driver Mick and Lehiff. This is absolutely not your typical cops & robbers movie. Lost love, found love, crazy love are important parts of this story.
There's a truly existential scene wherein all the would-be thieves are wearing the same blank-faced masks, discussing marital passion. Shirley Henderson (Hamish MacBeth & many other films) is always wonderful but she is especially touching as the sad/angry sister of sought-after Deidre. Believe it or not, all these characters are tied together (along with a rabbit racer, a quadriplegic, talkative old Pub afficianado, a screamingly angry woman in an older people's nightclub & a rock throwing eight year old delinquent) Another unexpected touch is the repeated presence of brown sauce! Only the Irish could come up with a film so complicated, amusing and heart-felt. The soundtrack is great, too. I bought this movie after my husband & I drove 50 miles to see it on the big screen.

First off it opens with Collin Farrell talking and his accent is so thick that I could not understand a word he said and I have family and many coworkers in Dublin so my initial reaction was ""you've got to be kidding me."" Then it moves quickly into violence with him punching a girl in the face...background is gritty and it just didn't get any better from there.

Every other word is ""fook."" All the other dialogue is indistinguishable, like SNL's ""Don't You Go Roun n Roun to Re Ro."" The dark humour just isn't funny to me. I felt bad for laughing when Colin Farrell punches a woman in the face. It's trying so hard to be one of those artsy films with intertwining vignettes, my least favorite type of movie. The characters are mean and annoying, and I didn't care what happened to them. Colin Farrell seems like he's having fun because he's just being himself, a total delinquent. I watched a few painful moments and then just fast forwarded. It just got worse. If you liked ""Y tu mama, tambien,"" and that kind of genre, you'll like this.",1382832000,,845,4.4935064935064934

Even when the good people had bad things done to them it was gross. For example one girl was used by a former bf for money. It wasn't that she was just used like a lot of people in teh real world are . . . ""taken for a ride"". . . he did that, tied her up, and defecated on her chest leaving here there for days before she was found. You don't see this scene . . . you hear about it. It was just perverse. It is movies like this and Angela's Ashes that really make Ireland a depressingly sad pit of a place in my mind.

2042764,4,B0001XLYBU,"""Intermission"" is a riotous Irish comedy that is difficult to understand, but easy to like. Along with the thick Irish accents it has overlapping story lines and frequent time shifts, making in nearly impossible to summarize, except to say that it concerns the lives of a dozen or so middle class residents of Dublin over the course of a few weeks. It has sex, drugs, rock and roll, kidnapping, hostages, fistacuffs, a car chase, a rock throwing kid, and a fatal shootout - what more could you ask for?

The film has a marvelous cast, including Colin Farrell (""Miami Vice"", ""Phone Booth"", ""In Bruges"") as a petty thief, Colm Meaney (Miles O'Brien from ""Star Trek"") as a tough fist swinging cop, Cillian Murphy (Scarecrow from ""Batman Begins"") as a lovesick naredowell, Kelly Macdonald (""Trainspotting"") as the object of his affection, and Brian O'Byrne (""Doubt"") as a luckless bus driver.

If you like films like ""Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels"" (1998), ""Snatch"" (2000) or ""In Bruges"" (2008), you'll like this film.",1314489600,,1021,4.964912280701754

Cillian plays John an average guy who -with his randy sidekick Oscar- creates his own problems when it comes to love when he tests his girlfriend's loyalty by suggesting they break up. Big mistake! Colm Meaney & Colin Farrell round out the cast with their own facets of dramedy which all come together brilliantly in the end.(About as brilliant as Cillian's bright blue eyes... SIGH!)

2042767,4,B0001XLYBU,"Intermission is a comedy drama, which deals with the hard and interwoven lives and loves of small town criminals, dubious cops and an Irish gang. This is probably the reason the MPAA (Motion Picture Association America) rated it with an R and FSK only allowed grownups to watch this movie. The director of this movie is John Crowley, who has done a great job in depicting the unique city of Dublin and Mark O'Rowes script. And although the movie has multiple plotlines Crowley ensures the viewer to never lose track of the story.
The films starts off with a flirty Lehiff (Colin Farrell) bewitching the cashier of a shop, just to punch her in the face and take all the money. In the first and very disturbing scene one can see at the first moment that Intermission is not going to be a film that deals much with traditional Ireland but rather with contemporary stereotypes of the Irish. When Lehiff runs out of the shop, the music starts simultaneously. In this scene and also in many other scenes in which Lehiff appears, music creates tension and suspense. But the music only accompanies Lehiff, otherwise music is played very seldom and if so, only for background noises and not for special effects like in typical Hollywood movies.
Speaking of Hollywood movies Intermission is the total opposite to it. There are no special effects, unmanageable stunts or absurd storylines. This movie rather depicts the normal life of these people living in Dublin. A further difference appears in the area of lights and shots. For example look at another crime/action movie with Colin Farrell like Phone Booth there, the actual crime sequence is very fast cut. In contrast, the crime sequences in Intermission happen in real time and not that fast that nobody knows what is going on anymore. There is also no light on important parts, everything is light up equally and naturally.
In the next scene, the viewer is introduced to two other important characters, John (Cillian Murphy), who is a young man working in a supermarket and who just lost his girlfriend Deidra (Kelly McDonald) and Mick (Brian F. O'Byrne), the bus driver. This scene already deals with a stereotype about the Irish. The Irish are known to be very friendly and open-minded people, but Mick is shown to be very unfriendly and annoyed by the passengers. He and an older passenger have a short conversation, which is full of unfriendliness and swear words. Mick also shows another stereotype concerning the Irish. He listens to two women walking which is very impolite but it is known as ""Irish curiosity"".
Another stereotype that is dealt with in the film is about the Irish and alcohol. When they are all together in the pub, emphasis is put on an elderly man in a wheelchair who is unable to hold his drink but gets younger men to hold them for him and basically ""feed"" him. He is drinking Guinness which also shows a certain pride of his country. Right afterwards the viewer is introduced to the detective Jerry Lynch (Colm Meaney) who takes himself very seriously and does not behave like a real police officer. Lynch is a perfect example of police brutality and disrespect towards criminals, especially when he relieves himself on Lehiff's legs. His attitude towards criminals is strengthened in the boxing scene, when he says: ""People I deal with are piss...waste.""
The film deals a lot with unemployment, poverty and crime in contemporary Dublin society. Above everything there is the trio (Lehiff, John and Mick) that decide to rob a bank, which incidentally is run by Deidra's boyfriend Sam. Through Ben's and Lynch's TV show, one gets to see two other criminals. A character, who shows how Dublin's youngest generation behaves, is the boy who first throws a stone at Mick's bus and then makes his car fall into that river risking Mick getting seriously injured. He seems disrespectful and indicates that the youth is rather badly educated and troublemaking. Through all those characters, Ireland is not represented in a very good way.
But what the characters all have in common is some sign of traditional ""Irishness"". All of them enjoy going to the pub and having a quiet pint with their friends. A further common feature is that everybody started off by being rather lonely and unhappy. John broke up with Deidra and quits his job. His best friend Oscar started an unhappy relationship with an older woman and also paid for the bad deeds he had committed in his life. But the finish promises satisfaction for everybody, who loves happy endings. The only character who pays for the way he lived is the real villain.
Despite the movie, the DVD offers a lot more. There are for example other movie trailers and bonus material on it. This material consists of the original trailer and some interviews with the actors. At first the producers deliver their comments to the movie and how they created it, the second part consist of the actors explain their role and the hidden meanings of some sequences.
Intermission shows the issues and negatives about Dublin's society but it is presented in a very humorous way. It is entertaining, thoughtful and exciting at the same time. The characters are played by very good actors and I can only recommend this film to everybody. All in all the perfect movie for those, who long for a change from the Hollywood productions.",1278892800,2,5331,4.827322404371585

2042774,4,B0001XLYBU,"Although this movie was advertised as being a new break out independent movie, it's not as original as the filmmakers would have you believe. It's main gimmick is that it features a bunch of different stories which intersect with each other at various points, such as you have already seen in ""Love Actually"" or ""Crash"" or a million different other movies.

That being said, it's not a bad little movie. I had quite a few laughs during the course of it, and, although it's not a new trick, it is always fun to see the stories intersect with each other.

Because of the cynical take this film has on love and relationships, it struck me as kind of a darker version of ""Love Actually"". However most of the characters still arrive at some sort of a happy ending.

As a former Star Trek fan, I particularly enjoyed Colm Meaney playing a tough guy police man with a fondness for Celtic music. Funny thing: Colm Meaney's Star Trek character, Miles O'Brien, was easily the most bland and boring character in both ""The Next Generation"" and ""Deep Space Nine."" But Colm Meaney himself can be a great actor, as seen in this movie, and also ""Snapper"" (another independent Irish movie that I saw on Eion's recommendation a few years back).

I'm referring here particularly to the first scene of the film when Colin Farrell, before robbing her, hits the face of a charming young girl he had seduced, or to the interventions of the cop Colm Meaney whose Dirty Harry behaviour is more than questionable.

2042779,4,B0001XLYBU,"As many of the reviews here already indicate, this film is not to everyone's taste. Set in Dublin, it reflects something of the sensibility of modern Irish drama, with its harsh, black-comic edges and its ambivalence about sentimentality. An ensemble piece that loosely weaves together more plot threads than a viewer can hope to follow or account for after seeing the whole film, it has a capable cast skillfully portraying a broad range of characters, not any of them particularly sympathetic, though you find yourself cheering for some of their small victories.

Yes, Colin Farrell is fun to watch as a charming but sociopathic skinhead. But for all their brief and fragmented moments on screen, there are standouts in the rest of the cast as well, including Colm Meaney, whose character seems to wish he were a tough cop in ""Miami Vice,"" the wistful Kelly Macdonald as a young woman who just wants a steady man, even if he's married, and Cillian Murphy as her totally hapless boyfriend with a job he hates stocking shelves in a supermarket.

The movie is a farcical riff on the many different forms of anger. Almost everyone has grievances that lead them to everything from rage to depression, which for many viewers will begin to wear thin after a while. There's exhilarating relief for a while as we are witness to a spectacular bus crash, and later the film cuts back and forth between two simultaneous car chases, each of them ending badly. Finally resolving all this high-powered negative energy is a bit more than this film can manage, and the ending rather unsuccessfully brings us in for a soft landing. But then endings are not easy anyway, and what you remember about the film are its oddball moments, which capture better than anything the desperate measures people take while looking for love in all the wrong places.",1165968000,2,1833,4.834394904458598

Theres an air of disdain and snottiness in the script-writers approach to the characters that makes them feel unemotional, plastic. Colin Farrell's role is brief and he plays the worst person in the film but he manages to inject the role with humanity. You believe he is a messed up sociopath but at the same time feel sorry for him on some level without this emotion being forced out of you.

 Which is good but stands in contrast to most of the rest of the film where the emotions feel forced,over the top and unbelievable. In short theres very few parts of the film where you believe this is anything but people reading lines and playing parts.

This film has been described as a black comedy. Black, yes, but I don't recall laughing at this essentially violent film. If we don't have blokes hitting lasses in the face with their fists, we have cops beating up suspects, kids flinging stones at buses and cars causing wrecks, robberies and kidnappings. And then there is the emotional violence: a bullying supervisor, a deserting husband, people made fun of for the way they look. So this is Ireland? Or a slice of life in Ireland? Well, I hope not. Almost all the characters in this movie seem angry or drifting. That some of them calm down and find a better direction in the end is redemptive for INTERMISSION but the viewer is still left with a bad taste in his mouth. After watching so many of these art house flicks, one wonders if the time would be better spent at the Gaugain exhibit at the museum or on a Louis Auchincloss novel.

2042786,4,B0001XLYBU,"You just don't know what happens next in 'Intermission,' Irish-English film directed by enormously promising first-timer John Crowley (who's been doing jobs for stage before this one), and produced by Neil Jordan ('Michael Collins').  You see sweet talking from Colin Farrell, and then, Bang! something terrible happens.  But wonderful thing about 'Intermission' is, beside that unexpected shocks or tender moments, that it has lots of delightfully eccentric characters and amusing dialogues (with equally lots of dirty words).  It's like 'Trainspotting' in Dublin.

[EMSEMBLE CAST] Among the film's eleven stories, known and unknown faces appear as the residents in Dublin, Ireland, where they encounter mostly unhappy incidents in their life.  Colin Farrel is rakish Lehiff, who is chased after by a violent cop Jerry (Colm Meaney, 'Deep Space 9'); Cilian Murphy ('28 Days Later') is unhappy John who left his love recently; Deirdre (Kelly McDonald, 'Trainspotting') is John's ex-love, having an affair with a bank manager.  And Shirley Henderson (who is Moaning Myrtle in 'Harry Potter' series) is Deirdre's sister Sally, who, it seems, has a mustache ala Burt Reynolds or Tom Selleck.

We see the fates of these characters, all unlucky in love, job, or whatever, cleverly depicted by the sure hand of director, who knows how to spin good stories out of very ridiculous situations.  Some find riding a bus can be very dangerous when a little boy throws a stone at that; or some find brown source tastes very good when put in a cup of coffee.  Screenwriter Mark O'Rowe did a fine job in creating a variety of lively characters that remind you of 'Pulp Fiction.'

[TO COLIN FARRELL FANS -- HE SINGS!] Really.  Though Colin Farrel's character is part of emsemble cast, which means you often lose track of his character, Colin Farrel here is exactly your bad boy image of Colin Farrel with Irish accents, which I find is not as thick as you may think.  And listen to the song 'I Fought the Law' at the end credit, sung by Colin Farrel himself.  Just in case you might be interested.

Though often very violent and even nasty, 'Intermission' is brimmed with energy that keeps the film going on smoothly to the end.  Sometimes unpleasant, but you forget it when everything fits in the right places in the end.",1120348800,11,2306,4.96875

The funny thing is living in Dublin myself I can actually say tha this film is true. This is a look at Irish culture.

I really liked this film and I though it was one of the funniest films i have seen in a long time. I hope there more films like this approaching as they are the new up and coming style in the industry.",1116633600,2,683,4.404761904761905
2042788,4,B0001XLYBU,"You may develop a slight case of whiplash while watching ""Intermission,"" but it will be a small enough price to pay for the pleasure of the experience.  This is a fascinating film that ingeniously weaves together a myriad of overlapping stories whose common thread is life among the Irish working class.

The screenplay focuses on a group of seemingly unrelated people whose lives crisscross and intersect in so well crafted a way that, as the story develops, a fully connected narrative soon emerges.  Through a carefully thought-out structure and pattern, writer Mark O'Rowe and director John Crowley create order out of seeming disorder, and the overlaps never feel pre-fabricated or contrived - until the end that is, and then the contrivance is used for comic effect.  The overarching theme of the piece is an examination of the subtleties and complexities that make up human interactions and human relationships.  There are people here from all walks of life, yet they are basically united in their desire for love, commitment and acceptance from their fellow man.  A few of them veer towards the criminal and/or violent side of life but most are just ordinary Joes (and Janes) trying to make the best of the lives they've been handed.  This is one of those films in which the good people triumph over their failings, the not-so-good ones get the chance to make things right, and the irredeemable ones get their richly deserved comeuppance in the end.

Colin Farrell, playing a violent, two-bit hoodlum, is the only ""name"" member of the cast, but the film boasts a whole gallery of fine actors and actresses who deliver heartfelt, winning performances.  The film is filled with humor and sentiment and just enough action and violence to keep the whole thing contemporary and cutting edge (with the usual nod to ""Pulp Fiction,"" of course).

The real joy of the film lies in putting yourself in the hands of the filmmakers and letting them take you wherever it is they want you to go.  The trip, I promise you, will be a rewarding one.

And you'll barely feel that whiplash.",1110672000,5,2078,4.872159090909091
2042789,5,B0001XLYBU,"It was certainly an ambitious plan to try and somehow thread together the lives of 54 different characters in eleven storylines (according to the rubric on the DVD, anyway!), irrespective of however fleetingly or intimately any particular set of characters interacted. John Crowley directed and Mark O'Rowe wrote the screenplay for this movie, set in Dublin, Ireland, consisting of entirely homegrown actors on their home turf. It was perhaps no accident that Colin Farrell, now established as a star in Hollywood through his performances in movies such as ""Phone Booth"", is seen right at the beginning.

Like many of the characters seen in the movie, Lehiff (Farrell) has a talent for trouble with the law, hence he sings the song, ""I Fought the Law"" (written by Sonny Curtis), at the end of the movie (much to moviegoers' surprise, I imagine). His character is therefore incomplete without doing something criminal, and, indeed, many, if not all, of the characters in the movie seem totally dysfunctional and as incomplete as he is, albeit in their differing ways.

Lehiff's nemesis, Garda (police) detective Jerry Lynch (Colm Meaney of ""Star Trek: Deep Space Nine"" fame), feels incomplete without showing himself off as a man who constantly fights the ""scumbags"" on Dublin's streets, and enlists the help of Ben Campion (Tomas O'Suilleabhain), an ambitious film-maker and the bane of his ""go-softer"" boss who considers Lynch too nasty a subject to be shown on a mainstream ""docusoap"" series on Irish terrestrial TV.

Ben is told to focus his attention on Sally (Shirley Henderson) who helped passengers after their double-decker bus spectacularly crashes on its side. Sally herself feels incomplete because of her ""Ronnie"" (moustache for non-Irish people!) and bitter because of her sister Deirdre (Kelly Macdonald) flaunting her new boyfriend, Sam (Michael McElhatton), a bank manager who has left his wife of 14 years, Noeleen (Deirdre O'Kane), who, feeling totally shocked, questions her own self-worth as a woman and a wife.

Deirdre had been the girlfriend of John (Cillian Murphy), whose arch-nemesis is the overbearing supermarket manager Mr. Henderson (Owen Roe), who feels incomplete without feeling good about lording it over his ""minions"". John feels utterly devastated and incomplete without Deirdre and will do anything to win her back, even though he initially turns to Noeleen, of all people, whom he meets at a singles' club for the middle-aged, owing to his need for ""companionship"" - despite his earlier hypocritical criticism of his ex-girlfriend to her face for doing much the same thing with Sam, upon whom he turns his hatred in a heated phone conversation when he wants to speak to her.

He then gets himself involved in an absurd plan: kidnap Sam, force him to go to his bank, and get ransom money. This plan involves Mick (Brian F. O'Byrne), the man who had driven the bus which crashed, and Lehiff. As might be expected, things go awry when Sam, who has the money, gets assaulted by an enraged Noeleen on the street, so Mick and John flee the scene without their money.

Mick feels incomplete without gaining his revenge on the boy, Philip (Taylor Molloy), who had lobbed the stone into the windshield, causing him to serve and crash the bus he was driving (and for which he got fired). However, again things do not go quite his way, and he ends up learning a bitter lesson. As for Lehiff, Lynch, who feels incomplete without nailing him, corners him in an open field, and the scene is set for a confrontation that ends in a way nobody expects.

One could say that O'Rowe and Crowley may have been a little over-ambitious in trying to make out as if all the people in the film just had to have some interaction with at least one or two other people - it would be interesting to draw a ""spider-gram"" on the back of an envelope in an effort to find out how everyone fits in with everybody else.

Nevertheless, O'Rowe and Crowley are largely successful in producing an enjoyable black comedy, even if one could question the use of so many f-words and c-words (as Lynch likes to do prolifically) in a movie from a country otherwise not seen very often in movies (MGM distributed this one to a wider audience). Equally, one may be a little concerned at the violence (and blood) seen in the movie, as Lehiff shows a shop assistant (at the start of the movie) and Deirdre (albeit while he is masked as he keeps her in the house during the kidnap/robbery operation) what he is prepared to do to people. Yet he is a hardened criminal and the exclusion of his brutal methods would be tantamount to sugarcoating the idea that crime should be ""blood-less"". (People can, after all, end up shedding more blood when accidentally falling off their bicycles.)

Describing the film would not be difficult with words like ""funny"", ""fresh"", ""fabulous"", ""fantastic"" and ""fascinating"". Humor is an element that runs right throughout the movie as the characters have to sort out their otherwise incomplete lives as they have to deal with the harsh realities of being in love, out of love, in a job that one hates, suddenly out of a job, sticking a finger up at authority, taking the law into one's own hands, each wanting a better deal in life than he or she can get at present. In all, it is a very entertaining movie about ordinary people leading ordinary lives with some extraordinary plot twists and turns.",1107129600,7,5416,4.859154929577465
2042790,3,B0001XLYBU,"Intermission juggles about fifteen relevant characters and scenarios during the course of the movie, and then attempts to tie them together at the end.  The humor is very good (revenge on a nasty boss, Colin Farrell's reaction to the ""brown sauce,"" etc.), the acting is very good (Farrell, Colm Meany, Cillian Murphy, and the ex-girlfriend), and even the pacing and creativity is very good.  If this movie had ended with the same confidence and orginality that it began with, we'd have an excellent film.  However, the finale is so cliche and unbelievable that I can't even bring myself to recommend the film.  Two major plotlines, one with Colin Farrell, a cop, and a documentary film maker, and another with Cillian Murphy and his ex-girlfriend, end so horribly cliche that my friend and I turned the film off in disgust, laughing at the idiocy and swearing at the near-destruction of an excellent film.  Let's put it this way...the movie sets itself up to be a realistic yet unpredictable tale of life in Dublin, and following that logic, certain people in the movie should die, certain people should live, and certain people should want nothing to do with others.  The movie washes it all away with a surpringly cliche Hollywood ending that ties strings together that never deserved to be tied.  There were parts in the conclusion that the audience members were clearly intended to rejoice over, but they were so trite that even the actors couldn't completely pull it off.  Rent this movie for the first three quarters, but prepare to be dissapointed at the end if you're an intelligent film goer.  If the stuff mentioned above doesn't bother you, and you enjoy things neatly tied up, then you certainly can't go wrong with this flick, and feel free to add one or two stars to my original rating.",1100563200,9,1800,4.818181818181818
2042791,3,B0001XLYBU,"As I played the DVD, the menu greeted me and the music immediately caught my attention. Somebody is singing The Clash's ""I Fought The Law"" in a heavy Irish accent. I thought it was Shane McGowan doing a solo effort after the Pogues, but after I finished the movie, I was shocked when I learned it was Colin Farrell himself doing the warbling.  This is just one of the pleasant surprises watching InterMission on DVD.  But there are also a lot of unfulfilled potentials.

Likened to ""cool"" movies like Lock, Stock & Two Smoking Barrels and Go, InterMission is definitely engaging with earnest performances by different actors led by known names (Farrell, Colin Meaney), upcoming ones (Cillian Murphy - Scarecrow in Batman Begins, and Kelly McDonald) and the other stars of the Irish film industry (it looks like they're all here). However, the rambling structure (51 characters! Reminiscent of Richard Linklater's Slackers) meanders and is as not as tight as the aforementioned movies. In the end, you'll feel some characters and events are not relevant and the events that transpired are not entirely caused by Murphy and MacDonald's characters' break-up as stated in the back cover synopsis. Sure, everybody is connected in InterMission but some are just there and quite irrelevant. Ultimately, it feels like one big movie about Friendster.

InterMission is a good, fun movie. Don't get me wrong. It has a good soundtrack and interesting characters. It's just not as breakthrough nor fresh (unlike Memento or the similar Go) as the marketers would want us to believe.

Also, this is one movie that's better off seen in DVD. Since you can turn on the subtitles to fully understand the lines delivered in thick Irish accents.",1100131200,2,1724,4.993031358885017
2042792,4,B0001XLYBU,"While Intermission, with its many characters whose lives converge in a tale full of action, sex and absurdity, draws on earlier films like Short Cuts, Pulp Fiction and Go, it has a style all its own. Director John Crowley gives the film a distinctly Irish flavor.  It begins with a Pulp Fiction-like bang, with a hoodlum named Lehiff (Colin Farrell) dishing out a dose of gratuitous violence on an unsuspecting victim. Colm Meaney, in turn, plays a sadistic cop who takes pleasure in tormenting Lehiff and the other petty criminals who cross his path. The plot is too complex to summarize in a short review, but it involves  an extramarital affair that leads indirectly to an improbable robbery plot.

What is surprising about Intermission is the way it manages to sustain coherence, suspense and a sense of humor amidst all the chaos and complexity. Many of the characters are sympathetic despite, or maybe because of their considerable flaws. All of the players distinguish themselves as real individuals, as opposed to the stereotypes that populate most films. Despite the absurdity of much of the tale, each of the characters is brought to life in a way that keeps the film compelling and fun to watch.",1099958400,4,1206,4.901960784313726
2042793,5,B0001XLYBU,"I was getting really tired of Colin Farrel's attempts at mainstream movie-making.  The worst thing that he ever did for his acting was to head to the States.  I had just about lost hope in him when I saw Intermission.  Now I know that he's a good actor, he just doesn't show it.

In this film, Farrel is back to being an Irishman and he's joined by a delightful cast of other up-and-coming actors/actresses from the United Kingdom.  They are all wonderful, especially Cillian Murphy.  He's really hot so you can't go wrong with him.",1098748800,5,532,4.5473684210526315
2042794,5,B0001XLYBU,"INTERMISSION is an unrelenting roller coaster ride of a movie that satisfies on every level.  This is one of the finer Irish films made, due in equal parts to a mind-boggling script, knife-edge directing, and a cast of superb actors who manage to keep us on track while the speed of the movie keeps promising to jump track.

Dublin suburb, many characters at crossroads of filial and relationship convictions, and a bus wreck all intertwine showing how happenstance can completely change lives.  John (the mesmerizing Cillian Murphy) is leaving Deirdre (Kelly MacDonald) to try the outside world of women, afraid of the commitment of a relationship.  John works at a market as a shelf stocker with clueless would-be womanizer Oscar (David Wilmot) and both crave to be out form under the thumb of the pestering owner.  Deirdre is crushed by John's leaving, gets consolation from her mother, but little empathy from sister Sally (Shirley Henderson) who is so against men that she is allowing her upper lip hair to be seen as a moustache!  Mother and Sally witness and save a bus accident caused by a child throwing a stone into the windshield.  The angry driver is yet another discontent young man who subsequently falls in with John and Oscar as co-criminals under the direction of small time crusty thief Lehiff (another feather in Colin Farrell's acting hat!).  How the multitude of little storylines intertwine (Oscar courts Sally, John finds Deirdre's new affair with married Sam (Michael McElhatton) devastating, detective Jerry Lynch (Colm Meaney) chases the group of masked young criminals yet is more interested in a live video of his career than the direction of his job, etc etc etc) is more fascinating than an enthralling jigsaw puzzle.

This film fizzes and sparkles with excitement and super performances.  But be aware: the Irish accents are basically so thick that much of the film is lost to US ears with out some help, so turn on the English subtitles for enhanced enjoyment.

And that's not 'bloggers', just a suggestion to keep pace with the story without straining to understand the dialogue.  An excellent caper and a must see for fans of Colin Farrell and Cillian Murphy!",1098576000,3,2193,4.961748633879782
2042795,4,B0001XLYBU,"""Intermission"" is very reminiscent of other modern offbeat films from Britain and Ireland is the past few (nearly ten since Trainspotting? Already?!) years, the kind of films that seem all vaguely ""Guy Ritchie-ish"" except ""Intermission"" is more based around love than crime and violence.

The structure is particularly reminiscent of ""Go"" (1999), the American film, in which a number of storylines revolving around offbeat, quirky characters all come together in the end. It may already sound like I'm denigrating the film, but I'm not. I'm giving it to you straight - this film's originality is not its strong suit. But most of you I imagine are like me, already knew that and want to see it anyway.

Well, this film delivered pretty much all I expected and I liked it. I was looking for another one of those wonderful British/Irish films where everyone talks in sexy, outlandish accents and working class stiffs get themselves into impossible jams and extricate themselves and find their way through life in the most improbable of ways. Among the storylines - two supermarket stock boys, one of which can't believe his ex-girlfriend who he is still loves is dating a man 20 years her senior, the second a man who is incapable of having an orgasm of late; the ex-girlfriend and her family, with her sister who was screwed over and left jaded by a boyfriend who hurt in her in a particular vicious and unpleasant way, rebelling against men by growing a moustache; a bedraggled bus driver; a small-time thief who has qualms about punching out pretty girls and manipulating his would-be friends; a tough-talking cop who thinks he's the world's biggest badass; and etc. all revolving around a down-on-its-luck Dublin suburb.

This movie doesn't have a huge ""wow"" factor, but I liked it quite a bit and it delivered all it promised. If you like films like ""Shallow Grave,"" the works of Guy Ritchie or Irvine Welsh, I can't you see not liking this movie. I think the photogenic, very attractive acting trio of Kelly MacDonald (very cute), Colin Farrell (patented Irish bad-boy persona in full force), and Cillian Murphy (those eyes making girls and not a few guys swoon) put on the most memorable and best performances of all, but the whole, well-known Irish cast does a fine job. 4 well deserved stars.",1098316800,3,2298,4.872122762148337
2042796,4,B0001XLYBU,"""Intermission"" is a collection of intertwined story lines set in Dublin, Ireland, all somehow connected to the break-up, several weeks before, of two characters, Deirdre (Kelly MacDonald) and John (Cillian Murphy). Deirdre has found a new man, Sam (Michael McElhatton). John is regretting leaving her. John's best friend, Oscar (David Wilmot) is desperately seeking companionship, Deirdre's sister Sally (Shirley Henderson) is avoiding it. Sam's wife is furious. And an egotistical police officer, Jerry Lynch (Colm Meaney), is pursuing career criminal Lehiff (Colin Farrell) and personal fame.

""Intermission""'s cast is a Who's Who of talented young Irish thespians, with a few Brits thrown in the mix. Quirky but somehow true-to-life Irish films about friends and family have somehow become a genre unto themselves. This is one of those. There's nothing surprising about ""Intermission"", but it does take enough unpredictable turns to keep it interesting. True to the genre, the characters aren't smart or even especially interesting on the face of it. But the dialogue is engaging. The situations are funny. These people's anxieties, neuroses, and disappointments ring true. Add a charismatic young cast, and you have a pretty entertaining movie.

The DVD: Bonus features include 2 deleted scenes and a theatrical trailer. The deleted scenes are essentially redundant and not worth your time. Subtitles are available in English and Spanish.",1098316800,56,1442,5.579908675799087

8017952,5,B0001XLYBU,"I rented this recently and realized I had seen it before. I thoroughly enjoyed it again. It's about several Irish couples and their relationships. As someone originally from Ireland, I got all the humor. The Colin Meany character tries to be a tough cop who is way past his prime. He has an obsession with one of Ireland's great folk bands, Clannad, and, in particular, one of their tracks titled ""Newgrange."" The humor is very Irish throughout which can be sometimes difficult to quite appreciate if you are not Irish. A lot of famous Irish actors are in this one. It's the kind of movie one would add to his/her collection to take out for a few laughs. Great film!",1497830400,,666,4.558333333333334

8017955,1,B0001XLYBU,"In the first 17 minutes of this miserably odious film, I saw and heard nothing but disgustingly foul language, crudeness, and almost total lack of decency. There is no evidence of intelligence in the characters portrayed, just a poorly written, foul script. I'm not watching any more of it. Fortunately I did not pay for this dvd; I borrowed it from the interlibrary loan service of the local public library because it includes Colin Farrell in the cast. Colin has appeared in some very good roles, but clearly this is not one of them. He seems to have used very poor judgment in his choice of some of the roles he has agreed to in the past, and in my humble opinion this is one of them. I did read the reviews here on Amazon.com before requesting the dvd from the library, but I saw no clue about the filthy language and indency in the script. I would not recommend this film to anyone who cares for well-made, decent movies. I give this one and Colin Farrell's role in it a thumbs down.",1477180800,,988,4.404371584699454

I am Irish and could relate well to the characters and their way of thinking. Colm Meany is good but becomes a bit overwrought at the end which detracts from his overall performance.  Colin Ferrell played a character outside his norm (at least at the time this was filmed (2003).  The scenes in the grocery store and the opening scene are particularly as is the ""balancing Volvo"" at the end.",1472860800,,509,4.5

8017959,4,B0001XLYBU,"The writer and director really do pull off something very sly here. It's a fine script; we've seen a lot of quirky ones like this, and most of those films get very old very quickly, this script happens to be better than most. And we've seen the actors, though Colm Meany is a bit different here and with familiar actors a little bit of difference goes a long way. (See Kiefer Sutherland in Melancholia. See Kirsten Dunst in Melancholia.)

Still, with all that, through most of the film I was going to give it a thumbs down. Why? Because its portrait of humanity is so unrelentingly negative, our existence, the sorry lives we lead, the sorry state of human beings. But somehow, in the final scenes, the writer and director pull a fast one -- they show that, yes, we are pathetic, and lonesome, and small ... but there's something admirable to us too, to the way we keep going. And the way we do that is why there is good reason to live, why nobleness exists even in the sorriest, in the most pathetic situations.",1465344000,,1012,4.440860215053763
