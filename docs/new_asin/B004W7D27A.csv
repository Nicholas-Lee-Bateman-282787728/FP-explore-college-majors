4485642,5,B004W7D27A,"Step by step instruction to play like Chuck Berry! Wonderful! The video is concise, well-organized, and it's easy to follow. If you know how to play the guitar, this one will improve your playing. It improved mine really quickly.",1373500800,,229,4.897435897435898
4485643,4,B004W7D27A,"The instructor is knowledgeable and patiently reviews the fingering, hammer-ons, pull-offs, etc. of each guitar lick. My only complaint is the difficulty of repeatedly going over a lick to learn it using a TV-based DVD as opposed to doing the same on my laptop with an instructional lesson via jamplay.com.",1361318400,,306,5.14
4485644,2,B004W7D27A,"I would've given this dvd five stars. The guy really knows what he's doing and the music and content is great. I have nothing against Steve Trovato, he's great. HOWEVER, lickLIBRARY is unbelievably CHEAP! They DON'T supply TAB and the DVD plays on my computer, which I use to practice on, WITHOUT a menu button in the player. I've tried several players and they are all the same. HOW CHEAP CAN YOU POSSIBLY BE! Without the tab I have to strain my eyes and constantly stop and replay the DVD to see what his fingers are actually doing. He says what he's doing on the DVD but tab notation would make it SOOOOO MUCH EASIER! AND DON'T LOOK FOR IT ON THEIR WEBSITE EITHER. IT'S NOT THERE! At least as of this posting. Sorry lickLIBRARY, I had high hopes for you guys, but you blew it. I'll look for Steve Trovato at other publishers. You guys stink.",1347148800,3,844,4.382165605095541
4485645,5,B004W7D27A,"Steve Trovato seems to host the videos in the ""Quick Licks"" library that pertain to American popular music like Rockabilly and Country.  Here he demonstrates the licks and riffs of Chuck Berry.  Its a lot of fun to watch and play along with.  These are his licks and the tone Trovato has is killer.  Every classic electric guitar player really should know these or at least a half a dozen of them along with riffs by the likes of the Stones, Beatles and Clapton.

He plays them through at normal tempo, slower tempo then by the individual component elements.  Sometimes even that is too fast and I'm an intermediate guitarist.  That is what the pause button is for! I also think that allows him to pack even more information in the DVD.  These Quick Licks drive me mad that they DO NOT carry tabs for the performances.  Lazy and cheap.  I've taken to creating my own tab for this and its actually been a good learning experience. Lemonade from lemons I guess.

This is an intermediate level DVD.  You should be comfortable around the neck but don't have to be an expert.  You should know that the 5th fret of your 1st string is A and the 10th fret is D off the top of your head along with (half) barre chords.  If you don't then you'll be pausing a bit more often but then you'll be learning the fretboard as well.",1323561600,7,1314,4.37603305785124
8444628,3,B004W7D27A,"Steve Trovato teaches an outstanding solo that he created in order to highlight a lot of Chuck Berry's trademark licks. Steve Trovato is without a doubt one of the finest guitar players anywhere in the country. So what's not to like? They provide no tab which makes for a very cumbersome learning experience. For easy reference, a tab is absolutely essential. But other than that - a great lesson from Steve Trovato. He deserves five stars, but for the overall package three stars at the most.",1465257600,,493,4.744186046511628
8444629,5,B004W7D27A,"I am a little surprised about how many customers whom were negative to this Learning DVD from Steve Trovado. First of all: You must practice a lot! You must  be very aware and exact all the time. I recomend to make your own TAB in six sections. Start with section one, and then two-three, and so on. When you have all sections wrote down, you can start training on the sections over and over again, until you feel more comfortable with them. Then you can put them all together. Play them often, may  twice a day for a week or two. Take a break for a week or two, start play again. After a month or two, you may play the entire solo like a pro. This Johnny B Good Guitar solo is similar with Buck Owens Live in Austin: When you master this guitar lick, you have jumped one important step forward in Your guitar solo playing. Thank you Steve! I give you a five!",1442448000,,859,4.168674698795181

8444631,1,B004W7D27A,This product SUCKS!  Cheap cheap cheap!  The DVD does not include a tablature for the songs.  There is really no slow down on the licks at all. I played in bands for 10 years and this DVD is just CRAP!,1430352000,,201,3.975
8444632,5,B004W7D27A,Very good. The classic Chuck licks well explained with some great little tips to get the real sound.,1426550400,,100,4.611111111111111
8444633,2,B004W7D27A,"Like another poster, I had high hopes for this DVD. Yes, the instructor is good, but NO GUITAR TABS are provided with this DVD so it can be hard following along to try to get it right. I went so far as tracking down the company that produced this DVD to try to acquire that material and they pretty much blew me off. Very disappointed!",1416528000,2,335,4.1692307692307695
8444634,3,B004W7D27A,"This video is good from a general standpoint. The instructor gives a thorough, good run-through of his take on general Chuck Berry riffs, but there are no songs or breakdowns of songs. What he does is play one, long Chuck Berry ""style"" instrumental with lots of Berry-like licks all the way through and then he goes through the whole thing lick by lick slowly and teaches each one, one at a time, which is great. However, I was looking for a video that taught several of Chuck's specific songs and broke them down specifically according to how Berry played them on the original recordings. I was also looking for some oddball (or just not the most popular mainstream hits) songs, which may not have been on any video even like the one I wanted anyway, if it exists (if that makes sense). Anyway, this video is great for learning Berry's style and applying it in your own or other or even Chuck Berry songs, but it's not a Chuck Berry specific song breakdown.",1397606400,2,958,4.543352601156069
8444635,5,B004W7D27A,Steve Trovato has quite a gift for conveying the various licks at a good pace  and as a teacher he had me playing  the chuck berry licks  in a matter of  mins.  The rock an roll quick licks chuck berry style  and also Steve Trovato learn to play chuck  berry  the both  are must for  the  beginner  or  advanced player his skill  using this audio visual method to teach lets you learn at your own  pace.  I was a bit apprehensive before  I purchased  my 1st lick library  being  a very slow  learner but  these DVDs are  quite unique well produced for every level of guitarist.  Danny Gill is also very gifted guitarist and teacher.  The absolute beginners lessons are excellent. The  young guitarist of today are very fortunate to have  this  audio visual medium at  there finger tips.  My order for the Steve Trovato  American Blues 1-6 is next for my library .  Thanks  to Steve Trovato  and Danny Gill and the  Lick library.  Dave,1391644800,,934,4.4156626506024095
8444636,2,B004W7D27A,"I bought this hoping to learn the famous Chuck Berry lick. Unfortunately, the person showing you how to play thus lick was either bored with playing something so simple to him that he just flew over the lick as if everyone trying to learn this lick was an accomplished guitarist. The finger position on the fretboard was very difficult to follow. It was hard to see exactly what string the instructor was playing. He uses terminology that is also great for experienced players who most likely if they were able to follow this instructor would probably not need to be shown how to play it anyway. The reason that most any person buys a DVD like this to learn how to play do they are perhaps not the most experienced players out there like me. It might really help to show a fretboard with the notes played circled with a number in it so it would be easier to follow what was being played.",1390348800,,887,4.414634146341464
8444637,5,B004W7D27A,"Very clear instruction of one of the absolute greatest icons of rock and roll music.  An absolute must for the foundation of playing Chucks music. Wish there was a tablature book to go along with it , but I did buy one on line that kind of follows most of the songs on the video.  Steve Trovato does a great job!",1384560000,,312,4.098360655737705
