8629037,5,B00H0INLII,Love the Asian culture and the way they treat a love story. It's refreshing to see actual courting and friendship develop along with marriage prior to sex. The Asians get it. The acting was great in this drama and I plan to watch all of Annie Chen's work. She is a wonderful actor and so is George Hu. They were particularly wonderful in Love Now. It's great to have an alternative to the trash the US produces.,1489968000,3,411,4.35064935064935
8629038,3,B00H0INLII,"Kind, optimistic, and straight-forward Liang Xiao Shu is a radio DJ and boss at her parent's small radio station. On the day of her boyfriend's birthday, she plans a nice evening with him, only to find out that he is cheating on her. She's devastated. What's even worse, is he straight out tells her that it's her fault. Zhou Zhen, who she met earlier that day, overhears this and comes to her rescue.

Zhou Zhen comes from a family who are former gangsters, but have decided to retire from that lifestyle after an incident years ago. Zhen is a protective and thoughtful man who suddenly gets dumped by his girlfriend, because of his family's background.

Xiao Shu and Zhen encourage and help each other move on from their breakups. There close friendship soon turns into a romantic relationship. But what happens when Xiao Shu finds out about Zhen and his former gangster family? And what will Xiao Shu and her family do when they find out the identity of her little brother's killer is someone close to Zhen?

This is a nice romantic comedy. It has a thoughtful and entertaining story and characters to match. However, I gave it 3 stars, because I was personally expecting a little more out of this drama. But there is good humor, some action, sentimentality, and secrets and surprises in this Taiwanese drama. I recommend giving it a try. (21 episodes)",1388016000,2,1355,4.708860759493671
