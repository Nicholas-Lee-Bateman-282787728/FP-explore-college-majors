8310425,1,B001I45ZZC,"Allegedly based on real events, this cheaply-made effort tells the story of a group of incredibly stupid young people who spend an inordinately lengthy part of the movie doing nothing on a secluded beach, forget the way back, and get lost in a forest. There they are set upon by a group of very weird and menacing backwoods-dwellers.  Poor acting, editing and scripting suck all the life out of what is supposed to be a slasher/thriller.  The only suspense arises from wondering which member of the group is going to survive. But halfway through, you find yourself not even caring.  It's impossible to believe that a real group of teenagers could be such morons.",1241913600,,662,4.7894736842105265
8310426,5,B001I45ZZC,"Brutal, wicked and one hell of a fun ride. If you like dark humored horror this is a film for you. It's the Texas chainsaw massacre meets Peter Jackson. Beautifully shot and bizarre characters. This one will leave you wanting more. Hey, was that a baby? Try this for some twisted fun and show it to the whole family.",1239667200,,316,4.372881355932203
