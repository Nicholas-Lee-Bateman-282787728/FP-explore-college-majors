8115987,5,B000EZKZTW,"If Queen Elizabeth saw this, she'd probably order Francis Drake to burn it up and weigh the ashes.  If God saw it he'd drown it in a flood.  If Mao saw it he'd have it reeducated on a prison farm for 30 years.  If the Pope saw it, he'd ban anyone else from seeing it.  If Chuck Norris saw it he'd spin-kick the TV.

I liked it, though.",1228435200,,335,3.8676470588235294
8115988,5,B000EZKZTW,"I like movies that offer ideas and this is full of ideas.  My favorite shorts on this DVD are ""Awkward Social Situations,"" and ""Small Microphones.""  ""Actor,"" and ""How to Pitch a Movie"" are both really funny too.  I've been to live screenings of this work in New York and the audience seems to like ""Financial Advice"" the best.  So there's a lot of variety and lots of ideas.",1166400000,4,374,4.455882352941177
