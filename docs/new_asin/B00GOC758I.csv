6094985,5,B00GOC758I,"If you like classic 80's romance movies, this is the collection to buy! - I know - I AM THE EXPERT!!!",1410048000,4,101,3.857142857142857
6094986,4,B00GOC758I,"When I am sewing costumes on a rainy day, I love having a movie pack like this to put in and just let play in the background.  I like all the movies well enough to watch them again, they are uncomplicated love stories (some end happily and some tragically), and each in its own way captures a movie style from its era, or ins some cases, that of a particular actor/director.

The best in the set (my opinion), is The Luzhin Defence, brilliantly shot and acted, and the reason I bought the movie set in the first place.  It was cheaper to purchase this set than to purchase the movie on its own, so this is a great bonus pack.

Tempest is the loose-retelling of Shakespeare's play set in 80's New York and Greece, with the always brilliant John Cassavetes and Gena Rowlands and Raoul Julia and young Molly Ringwald making every second memorable.  Susan Sarandon also stars.

The other movies are all very watchable, no stinkers in the pack",1402617600,25,938,4.488235294117647
6094987,3,B00GOC758I,"Major audio issues.  I bought it for no small affair.  Volume at 80 and still unclear.  A great value of movies.  Modern romance works good.  Tempest is seriously one of the worst movies.  Perfect is a bizarre movie of the 1980s fitness boom time.  It's story bogs down but the stars Travolta and Curtis do as best they can with odd formulaic material.  Modern romance has eight or nine funny scenes but is pretty uneven and basic as movies go.  Violets are blue seems awfully pretentious so far.  I haven't seen the Irish or the chess movie yet.

None of the movies have special features.  The Man Who Loved Woman with Burt Reynolds is missing the first ten minutes I think too.  I bought the set because of Demi Moore in no small affair.  I like that weird movie",1504569600,3,764,4.402877697841727

6095007,5,B00GOC758I,"I got this for Violets Are Blue, a film I'd seen long ago and searched for.  Chick flick.  Love Sissy Spacek and Kevin Kline.  In this story, they were deeply in love when young, but each chose a different life path.  She went away and became a reknown photojournalist and he stayed in their small town, married and had a child.  It is years later and Sissy returns to visit her family.  They reconnect.  I won't tell anything more, except your heart will break.",1466985600,9,462,4.428571428571429

6095026,4,B00GOC758I,"I really wanted to get 'Violets Are Blue' and ""Modern Romance' and found this DVD cheaper than buying them separately.  'Violets Are Blue' is great romance, some comedy and brings 2 high school sweethearts back together although 1 is now married; 'Modern Romance' is so very, very funny with Albert Brooks at his best as a neurotic boyfriend thinking he doesn't deserve his girlfriend and is driving her away with his neediness --- absolutely funny and reminds us how we are in a relationship (sometimes).",1443916800,16,505,4.9411764705882355

Good production values, too.  We especially enjoy movies that take place in Metropolitan cities like New York, Boston, LA, SF, Minneapolis, Pittsburg, Phoenix .....as well as areas of northwestern states: Idaho, .Montana, Oregon, Washington.  Of course, there are many areas of the United States that serve as great backdrops for movies. .  . .  .  .",1424822400,12,455,5.013333333333334

You need to sit 12-14 feet away from a 55 inch tv to not see the poor quality.

I bought this mainly because I had not seen most of the movies on it for a long time, and
wanted to see if they were worth buying separately.
I really liked Violets are Blue, but not quite enough to buy it separately - given the high price.

It's a great collection of different sorts of romances, and I recommend it if picture quality is not important.",1524960000,,529,4.227722772277228

I had heard of the chess movie ""The Luzhin Defence""  so I believed that surely among these eight movies there would beat least  one of merit! Well, if you like depressing movies about suicides and totally unpleasant selfish people these are the two discs for you. I watched the first movie about Chess- great ending with him jumping out a window but having the combination that could have won the championship in his pocket. It is the only one that I didn't turn off near the awful beginnings of the other seven. I didn't even want any one to ever watch the DVD's so I didn't even return them- I cut the discs up so no one else would ever have to suffer through any of them- Boy, the understatement is I hate all eight of these movies.
