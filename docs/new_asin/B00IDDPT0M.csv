6259823,5,B00IDDPT0M,"Love this series and so does my 2 1\2 year old. Unique characters, great bible stories, and music that parents and children will love. Can't wait until the next one is released.",1403308800,,177,4.5625
6259824,1,B00IDDPT0M,"Again, again.....same misconstrued stories that are ""new"" for the sake of entertainment. This theme seemed to be talking about faith, but in what or in whom is the million dollar question.

I'm not sure which episode (I bought all three movies in one go - mistake) talked about the ""Good News"", but it certainly was not talking about the Gospel from the Bible; which is the only Good News of salvation one can hope for!

This was a gigantic let down, after looking and waiting for some authentic Biblical family movies!

The ""Theo"" series had way more accuracy and depth to them. We'll stick to those. Thank you! Theo talks about important issues in ways kids can understand, and kids can even relate Theo to be symbolic of God teaching us. I do hope Lifeway will put more quality movies out like ""Theo"" series. I will definitely be buying! Already bought all the ones available for Theo.",1401753600,17,888,4.643312101910828
6259825,5,B00IDDPT0M,"My kids were impressed with Iesodo altogether.  This disc was great too.  The messages are good Bible messages/stories that my kids (10 and 7 year olds) are able to relate to easily.  I was impressed with the music.  The songs made a quick impact on my kids, they were singing along with the songs quickly.  Loved it.",1399248000,,317,4.491228070175438
6259826,4,B00IDDPT0M,"Episode 1: Miracles are Everywhere  A big event is happening! Thousands of birds from all over the world have gathered to meet Iesodo, but food is scarce and the flocks are getting hungry. Iesodo provides in a way no one could have expected.
Scripture: Matthew14:13-21; Luke 9:10-17; John 6:5-15

My Review: In this episode, Iesodo is confronted with the traditional ""Hoopoes"" who do not want any kind of change. They dislike what he teaches and make plans to disrupt when Iesodo speaks to a large crowd gathered to hear him. When Iesodo feeds all of the hungry birds, a lesson is learned in both having faith in his provision of needs and the importance of sharing what you have with others. Faith does need action: You do what you can, and trust God with what you cannot.

Episode 2: The Wind and the Rain  The flock is soaring through the sky on their way back to the Cypress Tree when a sudden storm approaches out of nowhere! Trapped at sea and frightened, they learn that when you have faith, anything is possible.
Scripture: Matthew 14:22-33; John 1:39-42; John 14:12; 2 Corinthians 5:7

My Review: This episode deals with having faith when you are afraid. When caught in a storm, the birds are frightened as they try to fend for themselves.  When Iesodo appears, walking on the water, he tells Rocky to walk out to him. As song as Rocky keeps his eyes ---and faith---on Iesodo, he can do it. A good lesson on trusting Jesus and knowing that you can do all things through Him.
* I really did not like that Iesodo was reading the scrolls of the ""Ancient Sage"", but will accept it as another name for God.

Animation is really good, and kids are sure to be singing the songs. I do like the bonus features on the dvd, especially Tim Timmons. The website is really good. I recommend you check it out for more info, behind the scenes stuff, and the fun and games, including downloadables.

Disclosure: I received this dvd compliments of Word Films and Edify Media for my honest review. All opinions are my own.",1397865600,,2012,4.554016620498615
6259827,5,B00IDDPT0M,It is exciting to see how they tell stories of the Bible using birds.  The biblical accounts were depicted well enough that you understand what Scripture they are referring to.  This is a good way to get your children interested in the Holy Scriptures.  You can read the accounts in the Bible with your children after you watch the episodes.,1397606400,,341,4.65
6259828,5,B00IDDPT0M,"""Where Fun and Faith Take Flight"" is the slogan for Iesodo. And that's a perfect way to describe what you get in these animated episodes: Biblical lessons presented in a fresh, fun way that the whole family will enjoy!

Iesodo episodes tell an overarching linear story. In the first DVD, Believe, you meet the primary cast [Rocky (Peter), Jack and Jacob (James and John), Maggie (Mary Magdalene), Tom (Thomas), Barry (Paul)] and see how each comes to a personal belief in Iesodo (Jesus). The subsequent story lines in each DVD tell different stories from the life of Jesus as recounted in the New Testament.

I like that birds were chosen as the animals in Iesodo. A dove is the natural representation of Jesus, but beyond that, it's fitting that Iesodo's followers, like Jesus' followers, may be referred to as ""the flock"". Iesodo is not the Good Shepherd who takes care not to lose a single sheep from the flock, but he's a peaceful, loving Dove who shows that God provides for even the smallest sparrow.

The Iesodo series offers engaging animation, humor, and music that children (and parents or grandparents) will just plain love. Kids will feel like they are at play rather than at study, but they will be absorbing valuable life and faith lessons. Bonus features make the songs available for play separately from the story, so kids can watch and sing along with the words whenever they like. Additional bonus features include mini lessons/sermons from Pastor and Co-Producer, Tim Timmons, as well as ""Natalie's Nest"", where mothers hear firsthand from the Producer mom who started Iesodo. Timmons' brief talks, which are among my favorite inclusions on the disc, will serve as helpful tools for parents and Bible study or Sunday school teachers.

You get your money's worth with these DVDs: Two animated episodes, mini-talks to go along with them, song videos with lyrics, Bible verses, and other tools to help children (and grown-ups!) get the most out of each lesson. But let's not forget one of the main ingredients:  F - U - N!

5 stars.

Through the work of talented writers, animators, and voices, the Iesodo series brings the message and teachings of Jesus into the hearts of the young and the old in a brand new way.

6259829,5,B00IDDPT0M,"Delightful entertainment at its very best for the whole family!

YOU HAVE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE THIS!!

IESODO or 'The Way Of Jesus' in Japanese is the latest video series based on the most influential figure of our times: Jesus and as you guessed, the most enduring best seller of the last 2000 years: The Bible.

IESODO is a kind and wise white Dove who lives in the Holy Land in a beautiful Cypress tree located on the shores of a vast lake (known to us as the Sea of Galilee).

As leader of his flock, he spreads a message of love and kindness wherever he goes. His lovable bird friends are very different from one another but there is a common point amongst them: Since they have met the Teacher, their lives have changed forever.

Folks, this is a splendid opportunity for any family to teach positive values to little ones of course and you will not want to miss it!

Director Jared Hankins stated:

""People of faith will be reminded and appreciate the reflection of Jesus. People who are not of Faith will appreciate the values, good teaching and entertainment. There truly is something for everyone and for all ages.""

Each episode is based on well known parables, as noted in the special features and displays a keen understanding on how to witness in His name even for the littlest one amongst us!

Included with bibles references, are sing a longs certain to have everyone singing and clapping in tune and fun and games to involve the whole family!

Further discussion guide also available on the website (HERE).

5 STARS!!

6259830,5,B00IDDPT0M,"I received two DVDs in the Iesodo series {Yay-So-Doe}. Iesodo means the way of Jesus. It is mainly for children and it is a teaching DVD about different things in the Bible. The two DVDs I received are called Love and Faith.
  Iesodo is a wise dove and he has many bird followers. In these DVDs Iesodo represents Jesus and the other birds the disciples. there are also birds to represent the evil rulers and even the devil. This format is very entertaining and easy to understand even for the very young.
Each DVD has two excellent stories from the Bible that will teach your child while they are really enjoying them.
  The DVDs are high quality and the birds and scenes are very colorful and fun. Each story has songs included that are very catchy and full of meaning.
  I love them all, but my favorite is The Wind and the Rain in the Faith DVD.
  This is a 5-star DVD and I highly recommend them. Collect all for your children/grandchildren/friends or church.

6259831,5,B00IDDPT0M,"Not since Veggie Tales has there been a great series for parents to provide visual entertainment for their children with great lessons to encourage further communication with your kids. Now there is, with Iesodo, pronounced Yay-Sa-Doe, meaning The Way of Jesus, which is a white dove in the bird world that represent the persona of Jesus. As this series begins, we are introduced to the family of birds that reside in a place called Cypress World on the Sea of Gailee that share two episode in each DVD filled with amazing and beautiful animation and music geared just for your kids.

I was invited to review Iesodo: Faith where you introduced to Miracles are Everywhere. The Hopi's are traditionalists and have their own way of doing things sticking to their traditional way of life. When Finch the Snitch conveys that Iesodo and his followers are doing things differently by spreading the good news, they immediately spring into action to put a stop to things. They send the Finch into action trying to find a way to trap Iesodo but when they arrive to speak to a large flock, it seems there won't be enough to feed them all. What will happen? Will they have enough faith to believe in what Iesodo instructs them to do?

In the next episode, The Wind and The Rain, teaches your children what you can do when you are afraid and how having faith helps to know that you can come through things if you remain strong. When the birds venture out on the Sea and the storms begin to get worse, Maggie comes up with a song to help the birds initially but then the waves and wind toss them overboard. They begin to grow afraid until Iesodo reminds them to have faith. He encourages Rocky to step out on the water and come to him in a miraculous retelling of Paul's journey of faith in Jesus. Anything is possible if you just believe.

I received Iesodo: Faith DVD compliments of Zaya Toonz, Rollman Entertainment, Capital Christian Distribution and Edify Media Inc for my honest review. This is such a brilliant series that you will want to make sure you collect all three, Love, Faith and Believe in the series. Directors for the series include Brian E. Ray whose credits consist of Muppet Babies, My Little Pony Tales and Ed, Ed, and Eddy, as well as Colin Brady, whose credits include Toy Story, Toy Story 2 and A Bug's Life. Brady also served as the former animation supervisor for Pixar Animation Studios. Producer Eric S. Rollman, President/CEO of Rollman Entertainment, formerly served as President of Production for Fox Kids and Marvel, and writer/producer Rob Loos is an Emmy Nominee and writer/producer for McGee and Me! Christmas Lamb, Kids 10 Commandments and Touched by an Angel. The Iesodo series also features the voice of Erin Bethea (Fireproof, Amazing Love) as Maggie. So as you can see this is a collaborative effort utilizing some of the best talents to bring you something wonderful for teaching your child biblical concepts that they will LOVE. I easily give this series a 5 out of 5 stars. My only complaint is that I wish this was available when I was growing up! Run time is about 55 minutes and contains some great bonus features like Bible verses, music videos and much more. This has received the Dove Approved Seal.",1394928000,5,3236,4.673684210526316

8641261,5,B00IDDPT0M,"My grandkids & I love the Iesodo series of movies.  Each video teaches about one of the Fruits of the Spirit or the Character God works to build within a person after they come to Christ as their Savior.

Iesodo portrays Jesus.  Each of the bird characters is a character from the Bible.  Maggie is Mary Magdalene, for instance.  Other characters get introduced over the course of the entire series...Matt is the apostle Matthew, Tom is the apostle Thomas, etc

Their are catchy tunes and easily-memorized lyrics to the songs that weave through the events of the stories.  My grandkids will burst out singing those songs as they are playing, riding in the car, walking around the block; they songs stick with them & may likely be what makes more sense to them later on in years at a time when they truly need to lean on the lesson they teach.",1480377600,,842,4.5364238410596025
8641262,4,B00IDDPT0M,"My friends and I nicknamed this ""The Bird-Jesus Show"" because most of us can't pronounce the actual title, and while my friends thought it was ""cringe"", I personally liked it. Sure, I have very strange and specific personal standards at times, but Iesodo is a show that broke the ""terrible animation and forced dialogue"" trend of Christian cartoons and is actually a show that can be judged on its own merits. Iesodo is not perfect, but it's far better, and somewhat more unique, than some of the other Christian shows out therr.",1475712000,,529,4.760869565217392

They are more true to the Bible then any show I have come across!  My boys are 2 and 3 and they LOVE these shows! I can appreciate VeggieTales,  however we have stopped watching all together. An I was a die hard veggie fan, until these came along. My boys always seemed to pick out the negative parts of VeggieTales. ... the fighting of sumo wrestlers, the sword fighting of pirates, blowing raspberries from the trees...and it kinda told the Bible stories...Iesodo TELLS the Bible stories. The birds represent biblical characters, and it puts in exactly what the Bible says in alot of places. There is no violence,  and the songs are really great, and some super funny! When you can understand where the stories are coming from in the Bible,  then you get it.  Jesus, walking on water in Faith, Zacchius the tax collector in Love, meeting the characters for the first time we see Paul portrayed by Barry, Peter portrayed by Rocky,  Mary Magdalin is Maggie, Thomas is a kingfisher named Tom, and the pelican brothers Jack and Jacob are James and John, in Believe, and satan being portrayed by a black raven, and Joy, the best one! The Birth! What a great job!!! These are the real stories, and I am so thankful I now have a much better choice in Christian shows for my family! If you have Netflix,  and would like to see, look for Believe, that's how I found these shows. ",1442707200,4,1497,4.5390334572490705
