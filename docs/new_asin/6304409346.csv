7869879,4,6304409346,"Thanks to a friend of mine finally cleaning out his garage, I was given a bunch of old VHS tapes including this one which was the second annual WCW World War 3 PPV.  Around this time, Roddy Piper had entered WCW with his sole intention of having a match against Hollywood Hogan to prove who the true icon of wrestling is but was constantly blackballed by Eric Bischoff who was revealed on the previous Nitro to be a member of the nWo while Sting started making appearances in the rafters during shows sporting a brand new ""black & white"" look with both WCW & nWo pleading their case for him to join their groups.

J-Crown Cruiserweight Champion Ultimate Dragon vs. Rey Mysterio Jr. - Before I get started, the J-Crown Crusierweight Championship was a championship from Japan that was created after the unification of 8 different crusierweight titles (including the WWF Light Heavyweight Championship that the company didn't acknowledge at that time). Ultimate worked a ground game here that dominated Mysterio for most of the match using various moves like a headlock, dragon suplex, a version of the torture rack backbreaker that current TNA star Abyss refers to as the ""Shock Treatment"", various powerbombs including a combination of a powerbomb into a top rope stun gun, brain buster, leaping tombstone piledriver, frankensteiner from the top rope, and a big splash from the top rope onto Mysterio on the floor. Rey was able to get some offense in himself like a springboard dropkick from the top rope & later a springboard flip dive to the outside along with a head sissors that drilled Dragon's head into the mat. Although Dragon dominated most of this match, the story behind the match was how Mysterio just wouldn't give up no matter how much punishment he took. This was a great showcase for Ultimate Dragon.
[Wrestling's Highest Flyers]

Chris Jericho vs. Nick Patrick - This was setup after Nick Patrick's ""neck injury"" ending up costing Chris Jericho a victory at Halloween Havoc causing Jericho to make a challenge to Patrick to have him with one arm tied behind his back & it should also be noted that Teddy Long was in Jericho's corner as he had his own issues with Patrick for the past few weeks as well.  This match was exactly what you would expect as Patrick did get a punch or two in but this was all Jericho as he was able to easily toss Patrick around with hip tosses while also dominating with kicks & slaps & punches before Teddy Long got a shove in himself.  It was entertaining for what it was.

Jeff Jarrett vs. Giant - Jarrett promised at Halloween Havoc that ""Giant, you will not chokeslam me!"" which didn't happen so this was the rematch between the two.  Jarrett worked on a ""hit & run"" offense while Giant was able to keep swatting Jarrett down only to dominate whenever he got his hands on him but the bigger picture here was the appearance of Sting from the rafters all the way down to the ring where he gave a Scorpion Deathdrop to the person who had too much to say about him in the past few weeks.

Right around here was the contract signing for Hollywood Hogan vs. Roddy Piper that was only good for setting up a few upcoming storylines like Eric Bischoff's first appearance as a member of the nWo, Piper's ""I taught you how to fight!"" comments towards Vincent (formerly Virgil in WWE), and Hogan exposing Piper's previously injured hip.

Harlem Heat vs. Amazing French Canadians - This was based off the fact that Col. Robert Parker cost Harlem Heat the tag team titles at Halloween Havoc so the stipulation is that if Heat beats Parker's new tag team in the French Canadians, Sherri gets 5 mins. in the ring against Parker.  This was a good back & forth tag team match between both teams with even the steps & a table brought into the ring at one point.  The bigger picture here was the aftermath between Parker & Sherri that was such as beating that the commentators couldn't stop laughing throughout the entire thing.

WCW Crusierweight Champion Dean Malenko vs. Psychosis - According to the commentators, this was the first singles meeting between these two.  Dean grounded Psychosis by working on his legs & head with various submission moves like the STF, an anklelock scissors combination, half crab that stretched Psychosis' spine.  Psychosis was able to pull off some offense during the match but they were called ""high risk"" for a reason as one moment he tripped off the top rope & fell face first into the rail while doing a corkscrew legdrop off the top onto the floor that caused him to barely hit his head on the apron.  Great match with Bobby Heenan summarizing it perfectly when saying, ""that was a victory that this man earned.""

WCW Tag Team Champions Outsiders vs. Nasty Boys vs. Faces Of Fear - The rules for this match was that members of two teams were allowed in the ring at a time while the third time would stand on the apron with the first team gaining a fall wins the match.  Brian Knobbs came to the ring with a bandage on his head based off the Outsiders attack before Nitro the week before causing the Nasty's to take the fight to Hall & Nash before the Faces Of Fear made their entrance.  Knobbs & Saggs were the odd men out as both teams took their shots at them whenever in the beginning.  The Outsiders had the strategy of allowing the other teams to beat each other up only to tag in whenever another team had a control which at one point led to both teams realizing what was going on causing them to tag in both Hall & Nash at one point to fight each other before all chaos with The Outsiders able to take advantage for the win.  This was a big non-stop action brawl but possibly the bigger story here was the issues between the Nasty Boys & Outsiders as you could clearly see both teams going ""stiff"" on each other various times.

World War 3 Battle Royal - For those who've never seen a World War 3 Battle Royal, it's 3 rings with each one having 20 men (60 total) in it doing battle against each other only for when it comes down to the final 10 men, they all move into the same ring to finish the match until one man remains the winner & a guaranteed title shot for the WCW Championship.  This match had plenty of moments such as Chris Benoit's face being completely beaten & bruised from the match against Kevin Sullivan the previous night, the rivalry between the Dungeon Of Doom & Horsemen causing all of them to be eliminated from the match with one of the commentators being taken out in the process, the nWo's unity throughout the entire match, Marcus Bagwell eliminating his partner Scotty Riggs (which was a tease to what would happen the next night on Nitro when Bagwell would join the nWo & attack Riggs in the process), the WCW vs. nWo showdown with DDP staying mutual while the nWo later in the match ganged up on Steven Regal as payback for him eliminating DDP (playing off the story of nWo trying to recruit him), Giant pitching Mysterio out of the ring with one hand, and the final moments with Lex Luger facing off against the nWo.  Although the match seemed like a huge cluster from the 3 different announce teams trading back & forth to the constant 3 way split screen until the everyone got in the same ring, it was still very entertaining & had it's moments from beginning to end.

In the end, this was one of WCW's better cards during this period from top to bottom as we had a taste of everything...great in-ring action from the crusierweights, entertaining matches & moments, segments that pushed storylines, non-stop action brawls, and a good battle royal to top it.  A WCW event I would add to the collection.",1306713600,,7612,4.5508412582297

7869881,3,6304409346,"The last World War 3 was definitely not the best.

- Glacier vs. Wrath (2.5/5)
A short, watchable match with two unexciting wrestlers.

- Konnan vs. Stevie Ray w/Vincent (2.5/5)
This match could have been better, but it wasn't.

- Perry Saturn & Kaz Hayashi vs. Ernest Miller & Sonny Onoo (3/5)
A lot better than the first two matches and the ending is kind of funny.

- Juventud Guerrera vs. Billy Kidman for Cruiserweight Title (5/5)
I had no doubt that this was going to be good!  These two put on a classic cruiserweight fight and it had an exciting ending.

- Scott Steiner vs. Rick Steiner (?)
This is where World War 3 gets really disappointing.  Scott Steiner has his NWO buffs pound on Rick Steiner and it ends up being a no contest.  You get to see Goldberg throw a referee pretty darn far though.

- Kevin Nash vs. Scott Hall (?)
Hall gets a beating from the NWO, Nash comes out and saves him, and Nash walks away.  Therefore, ladies and gentlemen, we have two consecutive no contest's. (Hold the applause)

- 59 MAN BATTLE ROYAL! (4/5)
The reason I wrote 59 is because Hogan (the 60th man) is nowhere to be found.  This is also the shortest 60 man battle royal, clocking in at around 22 minutes.  Never the less, it is still a fun match to watch.

- Bret Hart vs. Diamond Dallas Page for U.S. Title (4/5)
This was a good match, but the crowd didn't seem to be into it at all.  It had a pretty cool ending that seemed to wake up the fans a bit.

WCW didn't do too well with this one, but it is still very entertaining and nostalgic to watch.  Don't shell out too much for this, but if you can find it for a cheap price, go ahead and get it.",1229904000,,1651,4.190476190476191

WCW World War 3 1997
WCW's take on the Royal Rumble match, World War 3, will make its third appearance since its creation. WCW rarely put on a solid top to bottom PPV, but this is one of them. Not all the matches are 5 star classics, but most are fairly good. The World War 3 match headlines this card, and it rightfully deserves to. This event is over ten years old but is still a fantastic event. World War 3 is a 3-ring event. Throughout the night you see wrestlers take advantage of all three rings.

Glacier & Ernest Miller VS Meng & The Barbarian
This was a decent way to start off the evening. Meng and Barbarian control most of the match with their high impact power moves. Miller and Glacier get short lived, martial arts attacks. Meng and Barbarian pull out a sick Back Drop into a Powerbomb.
RATING- 7/10

WCW Television Title
Perry Saturn(c) VS Disco Inferno
Ever since Disco lost his Television Title he has been on a mission to get it back. Perry Saturn plays his ""slightly out there"" persona very well. Disco shows some good fluid wrestling skills. Saturn pulls off some nice highflying moves and some good counters. This match features a fantastic ending that came from nowhere.
RATING- 8/10

Yuji Nagata VS Ultimo Dragon
Nagata takes early control of Ultimo Dragon, focusing mostly on Ultimo's injured arm. The match is pretty basic until Ultimo gains control and kicks the mess out of Nagata. Nagata takes a Dragon Sleeper and gives up, but his manager is distracting the referee. Ultimo pulls off a very well done frakensteiner near the end of the match. In the end, Nagata gets a cheap win over Dragon.
RATING- 7.5/10

WCW World Tag Team Championships
Steiner Brothers(c) VS Steven Regal & Dave Taylor
After the horrible yearlong reign of the Outsiders, The Steiner Brothers have captured the WCW Tag Team Titles. Both teams get equal offence in the match. The Steiners bring the power offence, while Regal and Taylor use their European uppercuts and underhanded tactics. Chaos erupts near the end and you see some great double team moves by the Steiners.
RATING- 8/10

Between these two matches, Gene Okerland and J.J. Dillon discuss Raven not signing a contract yet. Dillon says that Raven has 24 hours to sign one or Raven is gone.

No Disqualification
Raven VS Scotty Riggs
Raven has been trying to get Riggs to join his group, but Riggs just won't join. Raven uses a chair to get an advantage on Riggs. The match turns in favor of Riggs after he uses the chair for his own use. Riggs hits Raven with a Bulldog right on the edge of the steel chair. The end of the match sees Raven hitting the Even-Flow DDT on Riggs 3 times, then sitting and watching as Riggs gets counted out.

Steve McMichael VS Alex Wright
This was originally supposed to be McMichael VS Goldberg, but Wright attacked Goldberg before the match started. Queen Debra had to get someone on the spot to take Goldberg's place and she picked Alex Wright. Wright gets squashed and gets literally no offence in the match.
RATING- 3/10

WCW World Cruiserweight Championship
Rey Mysterio VS Eddie Guerrero(c)
This match wasn't as good as their&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Halloween-Havoc-97/dp/6304821816/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Halloween Havoc 97</a>&nbsp;bout, but it was still a very well done contest. There are a couple of missed spots that pull the match down a bit. Also, the fact that there isn't a Mask Match like their previous encounter, it lacks as much emotion. Still, one of the best match of the evening and almost as good as their previous match.
RATING- 9/10

No Disqualification (Match of the VHS)
WCW United States Championship
Ric Flair VS Curt Hennig(c)
This is my personal favorite on this old tape. Curt Hennig betrayed the 4 Horsemen at Fall Brawl 1997, and Flair has been after Hennig ever since. It really feels like they hate each other in this match. They brawl in the crowd, on the floor, and in the ring. Flair hurts his leg after a dive to the outside onto Hennig. Hennig quickly takes advantage of this and works over Flair's leg. Flair turns it around though and uses a chair on Hennig's leg to weaken it for the Figure-4. You could tell what the ending was going to be though, which brings it down.
RATING- 9/10

World War 3
60-Man Battle Royal
60 men start in the three rings. Once it has dwindled down to five in each ring, they will move into the middle ring and finish the match. It didn't quite work that way, but those were the rules given. To start, only 59 entered the match initially. The Giant eliminates around 5 guys within the first few seconds of the match. The nWo works as a unit and also eliminates many of the wrestlers. The Giant is on fire and eliminates everyone from his ring, including Meng with a dropkick. Near the end, no one from the nWo has been tossed out yet. They aren't entering the middle ring though. WCW decides to takes the fight to them. This is where it gets seriously intense and a lot of surprises take place. The 60th entrant arrives in the form of the WCW Champion Hulk Hogan. Many more surprises take place before the show is over, including an overly stupid ending.

7869884,5,6304409346,"If this isn't the best WCW wrestling pay-per-view extravaganza of all time, it surely doesn't miss by much.  There is just so much to talk about in this one, as not only the wrestlers but also the dream commentating trio of Tony Schiavone, the American Dream Dusty Rhodes, and Bobby the Brain Heenan were in rare form on this November night in 1996 (even though the box says 1997) in Norfolk, Virginia.  Emotion was sky-high, as Eric Bischoff, the head of WCW, had just six nights earlier showed his true colors, which were the black and white of the NWO.  Rowdy Roddy Piper called him out that night, and on this night he came to the ring, contract in hand, to sign a match with Hollywood Hulk Hogan.  The night would end with an incredible 60-man battle royal that left fans breathless and emotionally spent.
Things get off to a great start in the opening match, with Rey Mysterio, Jr., always a crowd favorite, taking on the Ultimate Dragon.  Brother, these guys put on a show.  Mysterio took a beating, as Dragon did everything but throw the kitchen sink at him.  This was a terrific opening match with plenty of oohs, aahs, and oohs.  Next up was a match all WCW fans wanted to see, as WCW referee (and obvious NWO collaborator) Nick Patrick took on Chris Jericho in a special handicap match.  Jericho fought with one hand tied behind his back, and I joined millions of fans in loving every blow and kick Jericho delivered to the turncoat Patrick.  WCW, as Dusty always liked to say, was where the big boys played, and they don't come any bigger than the Giant (better known now as the Big Show); he faced off with Jeff Jarrett in a return grudge match.  I was a big fan of Jarrett at the time, whom an injured Ric Flair had endorsed for membership in the Four Horsemen, but Jarrett never had a chance as the moody and mysterious Sting came down from the catwalk and, just when things were going Jarrett's way, delivered a scorpion death drop on Jarrett, seemingly declaring his allegiance to the NWO.  At this point, Roddy Piper came to the ring to call out Hogan and get him to sign a contract to fight at Starrcade the following month.  Hogan signs the contract, but not before revealing the fact that Piper had had major hip surgery, and the entire NWO basically try to take out Piper and his bad hip right there in Norfolk.  It's an ugly scene, but Piper's willpower and courage only benefited from the exchange.
In later action, Dean Malenko defends his cruiserweight title against the horned Psychosis; I always liked Malenko, but his traditional wrestling style made for some slow and sometimes boring matches.  Still, there is one classic moment when Psychosis slips on the top rope and ends up hurtling himself headfirst into the safety rail outside the ring.  Then you had a triangle match for the tag team title, featuring the NWO's Outsiders, the Faces of Fear, and the Nasty Boys.  There were a few good moments here, but triangle matches are just silly to me.  After that came the 60-man battle royal, the winner of which would get a shot at Hogan's heavyweight belt.  You had simultaneous action going on in three rings, which made it hard to keep up with the action, especially since the three camera angles were far from good, but there were certainly some great moments.  Kevin Sullivan and his gang went to war against Chris Benoit and the Four Horsemen before any of them even got to the ring, knocking themselves out of contention in the process.  ""Stagger Lee"" Marshall, one of the extra announcers sitting ringside for the action, got clobbered himself, making for a classic WCW moment.  In the end, though, it came down to Lex Luger and four NWO guys (Giant, Six, Scott Hall, and Kevin Nash).  Hopelessly outnumbered, Luger sent the crowd through the roof by putting the Giant and then Kevin Nash up in the torture rack and almost overcoming incredible odds to win.  Perhaps the most memorable moment of the contest came when little Rey Mysterio, Jr., tried to jump on the Giant; the Giant caught him, raised him above his head with one hand, walked over and threw the guy out of the ring with no effort whatsoever.
All of this is great, but when I think of World War III, I hear an incredibly excited Dusty Rhodes screaming ""She clotheslined him!  She clotheslined him!  She clotheslined him!""  When the Harlem Heat defeated the Amazing French Canadians, Sister Sherrie got to have five minutes in the ring against former fianc and partner Colonel Parker.  Nothing I have ever seen in wrestling compares with what transpired in these few precious minutes.  Sherri went to town on Parker, cold-konking him a few times, clotheslining him twice, and then flying off the top rope in a full body press.  Dusty Rhodes absolutely went crazy with excitement, as did the Brain and Tony Schiavone.  It's the funniest thing I have ever seen in my life; after it was all over and the camera came back on the commentators, they were barely able to contain themselves.
Basically, World War III gave fans as exciting and enjoyable a night of pro wrestling as I've ever seen.  In Rhodes lingo, there was all kinds of clubberin', filibusterin', flim-flams in the belly-welly, early Christmas presents, and stomping of mud holes in assorted wrestlers all night long.  Dusty and the Brain were hilarious, and even Schiavone joined in on the fun without trying very hard to rise above it.  It was a great night, and I'll be watching and cackling over the Sherrie-Colonel Parker action periodically for the rest of my life.",1068508800,4,5533,4.658436213991769
