7876083,5,6304558198,"This movie begins with the arrival of Goku's evil, Saiyan brother, Raditz. Raditz kidnaps Goku's son, Gohan, and tells Goku to destroy 100 of the species on Earth if he wants Gohan back. Goku is also told to join the few remaining Saiyans. Piccolo teams up with Goku in order to defeat Raditz. I will not spoil the battle between the ""World's Strongest team"" ( Piccolo and Goku) and Raditz. Overall this movie was a great start for the Dragonball Z series!!",1022284800,2,457,4.585365853658536
7876084,5,6304558198,This movie was excellent. I love the Radditz battle because nobody is too strong and the villain is a relation. I personally liked how they didn't go episode to episode in this and kept it as almost a movie. Well that's all for now but if somebody is deciding whether or whether not to buy this video read my review and think again.,1009584000,,332,4.285714285714286

There are countless niggles with dubbing and corny plots, but that is the essence of the series, and there is no better way to enter into the genre than to see the start point.",1003708800,,297,4.228070175438597
