551597,5,6303082637,"Sometimes films that follow a true story often get misinterpreted, and add extra scenes to make the screenplay more watchable, but this film ofters true fact and hardly anything here is not true to the book (Or the documentary for that matter).  A truly riveting piece of cinema, vastly underrated by critics at the time of theatrical release, this picture has it all. A Stirring soundtrack (David Henschel) also adds the to the epic tale of the assasination of Heydrich, and the depths to which the German Army go to to catch the infiltraiters in Prague in 1942. Nice acting for Tim Bottoms and his close friend Antony Andrews.  We now await a widescreen remastered print on DVD please. But for now, settle for the VHS, as It is too good to miss.

This scene will totally mystify the first-time viewer of this film.  However if you remember watching the original film, the dialogue sub-titles explain that Heydrich is donning the Czech Royal Crown.

551921,4,6303082637,"I saw this film many years ago and have never forgotten it. Since then I have seen a number of documentaries about Reinhardt Heydrich, and his assassination, or more rightly his execution by Czech members of Britain's SOE. It would be hard to find braver soldiers in WW2 than the two men who carried it out: Jan Kubis and Jozef Gabk. Lewis Gilbert's film still holds up as a worthy tribute to them, although it is not without the odd flaw.

The story is full of heroism, but also treachery. Timothy Bottoms and Anthony Andrews play Kubis and Gabk, while a youthful-looking Martin Shaw plays the conflicted Karel urda. The whole plan was so audacious you could be forgiven for thinking it was just typical movie fiction, but the film stays much closer to the facts than most `true' war movies. Although the mission was successful, the vengeance of the Nazis was fearsome, and the movie ends as the small band of operatives are trapped in a church by hundreds of German troops. There are conflicting accounts as to what happened in Ss. Cyril and Methodius Cathedral in that final, spectacular battle, but ""Operation Daybreak"" sticks close to the accepted version of events.

The thing that strikes you about the film is its authentic look, with much of it shot where it happened in Prague. The mainly British cast were at pains to capture the essence of their characters, but it is Anton Diffring in the showier role of Heydrich who steals the movie.

There are a couple of misses. The film has a weak score. ""Operation Daylight"" was made about the time synthesiser scores replaced orchestral scores in many films. These days, the best scores are often a blend of the orchestral with the electronic, but synthesisers were all the rage back then. Unfortunately, David Hentchel's score has no feeling for the period and is often intrusive - it detracts from the mood at key moments.

Although mostly in English, the film also has some passages in German without subtitles - although you can tell a lot from the body language, subtitles in those scenes would have helped.

I still feel that this film delivers something unique. With its amazing true story, fascinating backdrop and the honesty of the filmmakers, ""Operation Daybreak"" rises above its flaws, and has an ending that really hits home.",1411084800,4,2292,4.792405063291139

551997,5,6303082637,"The events in Operation Daybreak are true, and took place in 1942 in Czechoslovakia (now two countries, the Czech Republic and Slovakia) after a decision by senior officers in the British and Free Czech armies in England to parachute three Czech Army volunteers into Czechoslovakia in December 1941 with the express purpose of assassinating the ruthless Reinhard Heydrich ,the German (Nazi) ruler of this country which Germany had invaded in March 1939,just prior to the outbreak of a general European war six months later.
The film vividly first portrays how they were successful in their mission with Heydrich's death on 4  June 1942, although they came close to botching it. Second, it shows the brutal and widespread response of the Germans which led to the destruction of two villages,Lidice and Lecaky, and the execution of all boys and men over the age of 14, and the deportation of girls and women to Germany:and finally, after they had been betrayed by one of their own for a reward of 100000 Czech crowns, the last stand of the brave Czech patriots (now numbering seven) in the crypt of St Cyril's Orthodox Church in Prague where they were being harboured by Czech resistance fighters who were hoping to find a way to get them out of the country.
In 1974 I visited St Cyril's which surprisingly was open even though the Czech Communist Party had governed the country since 1948. I went down into the crypt and stood in the half gloom where those brave men had fought and died 30 years before. A plaque near the church commemorates their dedication and bravery.
This picture deserves a wide audience. It tells a story of the resistance of courageous people against the primitive and cruel Nazi ideology and its adherents. It is so well made, on site in Prague, and is beautifully acted.",1385856000,3,1795,4.809061488673139
551998,4,6303082637,Such a pity this film has not been digitized and issued on Blu-ray with historical supporting material.  It is one of the few films of the Second World War which stays close to the truth of the events.  We should continue to remember Lidice.,1382918400,2,241,4.454545454545454
551999,5,6303082637,"I first saw this film when it was released in the 1970's on BBC1 and was fascinated. I then saw it again in the 80's on TV and was hooked on the story it told. Today as a student of modern history and University Lecturer of International Relations, I have a fascination with this period of history. Having studied in Prague and having listened to the tales of what the Nazis did to the peoples of what is now Czech Republic and Slovakia I wanted to buy this film to watch the killing of Heydrick one more time. I also have a historical fascination with Heydrick, as he was probably the man most likely to have replaced Hitler if the Nazi State had succeeded in its ambitions and had not collapsed in 1945. I searched for many years to try and get a copy of this film and finally bought it on Amazon.

This film tells the fascinating story of the assassination of one of the key men in the Nazi regime. It starts in England and follows the story of the brave Czech soldiers who were airlifted into the Czech Protectorate with the one aim of assassination. The story it tells is one of bravery and then mass murder, as the Nazi regime systematically goes about terrorising the nation until it finds the killers. There are some factual errors but they do not detract from the story.

The film itself was obviously shot on a low budget and filmed predominantly in Prague itself. The acting of Anton Diffring is suburb and you do feel he is Heydrick. Despite its low budget the film tells a fascinating story and is worth watching.

One word of advice, as stated by other reviewers, I bought a Korean copy where the German is not translated into English and there are no subtitles, which does distract from the film, as large swathes of Diffring's dialogue is not translated.

Great historically based film which does stick closely to the facts. Recommended.",1375660800,2,1853,4.505952380952381

Perhaps the loss of 12 minutes of running time moves the action forward somewhat, but the film was made with some care and I myself would prefer to see the entire film, without cuts.  That is possible with an alternate version that is available, but unfortunately not with the Warner Brothers release of this very important WWII film.  I continue to be disappointed at the major studio's habit of cutting large and significant portions out of popular films.  This has been done to the DVD releases of The Big Easy and Like Water for Chocolate, and enthusiasts are still waiting for a release of Midway that includes the 20-30 minutes at the start about the Battle of the Coral Sea.

The assassins were the Czech resistance fighters,trained by the British Army,who parachuted back into then occupied Czech Republic (then Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia) and were assisted by the members of the local Czech resistance. The film is set authentically in Prague, which makes it more interesting. Only few people know that the assassination of Heydrich was organized by M16 in part to protect admiral Wilhelm Canaris- German's chief of military inteligence, who gave many useful informations to Nazi German's foes. Heydrich started to be suspicious of Canaris's double game and therefore should be removed. The assassination also should refurbish the Czech people's prestige. But price was too high. The German retaliation was brutal. The whole Czech village Lidice was completely destroyed by German forces. All men older than 16 were murdered and women and childern were sent to concentration camp Ravensbruck where nearly all of them were killed. 3000 Jews were taken from Terezin ghetto and exterminated. 5.000 Czechs were killed to avange the death of one murderous Nazi. The movie doesn't tell about all these events.

Although this version was made in 1975, an earlier black and white version was made by the Czechs themselves in 1968 (I saw part of it on a documentary once) - and it looked as though the 1970s version was filmed in very much the same way as the previous version had been.  Like Tom Cruise's ""Valkyrie"" which has been recently in the cinemas, this is a true story that does not have a happy ending for the guys who were on the mission.  Like Valkyrie - however - the film does tinker with the actual facts .... in real life the assassins were dragged out of the church, tried, and then hung with piano wire.  Far too gory for 1970s film audiences, I would assume .... but the rewritten ending with the haunting music that plays over the final scenes it brilliantly written, filmed and acted (by Timothy Bottoms, Anthony Andrews and a pre ""Professionals"" Martin Shaw) and indeed does leave (even male viewers) in tears.  You also feel sorry for the hapless German soldiers sent into the church in waves to be simply mown down in a hail of bullets whilst their Nazi-supporting commanders waited outside to avoid the carnage. That piece of film music which plays in the final scene is one of the most dramatically poignant pieces of music for film ever written and deserves a CD release all of its own.  Shame on American and British DVD producers for failing to release this classic on DVD - and leaving it to other nations to do so.  Buy this film; you won't be disappointed.",1236470400,4,1829,4.438805970149254

I saw it in 1980, and since then, it has been right up at the top on my wish list of collectible movies of all time.
The transfer seems to have been from a VHS  and hence the quality isn't too great, but I guess beggars can't be choosers when there isn't an official dvd print of this title anywhere in the world.
For those of you who haven't seen it......just blindly pick this title up!!You will never regret it.
And lastly.....I hope the authorities who own the rights to this movie listen to all our prayers and release a remastered version of this classic on dvd so that it will not be lost for posterity .",1233014400,3,774,4.194630872483222
552128,5,6303082637,"The main body of my review below was written before the Warner Brothers Archive Collection DVD release of the film late last year.  My comments as to the DVD are below the review.

The recent ""Valkyrie"" and ""Defiance"" are not bad films at all - but they pale in comparison to ""Operation Daybreak"" in their depiction of  heroic strikes against Hitler and Hitlerism in every particular.  No film about the Holocaust or a Nazi-occupied country has EVER made me feel as involved, as claustrophobically surrounded by the madness of Fascism as this film.  ""Schindler's List,"" ""The Diary of Anne Frank,"" ""The Pianist,"" ""Sophie's Choice,"" ""Defiance,"" - all great movies dealing with lives controlled and stolen by the Third Reich - but compared to this film, they all come across as seeming like, well, what they are....films.  But this movie...wow...it transcends the artful feel of cinema and if ever a film did it, this one does - it makes you feel like you are there!  And the added glory is that this is a true story that follows the historic truth with very little liberty taken.  It is the ultimate study of Heroic Hopelessness.  The acting, the settings, the cinematrography, the absolutely hauntingly beautiful (and unrecorded!) music score, all of it - this is a MUST see.  I won't go into plot detail to spoil it for those who know nothing or little of this true story.  When I first saw it, I knew absolutely nothing about what would happen next.  That is the best way to experience this film (and all films, actually).  Suffice it to say that, as the credits rolled, I wept. I wept more tears after watching this movie than I've shed from all the other World War II films I have seen combined.  And that is saying alot!  And to movie score CD makers:  don't let this emotionally rivetting score remain in unheard oblivion.

As to the WB Archive Collection DVD release:  I just watched it and am glad to have this fantastic film on disc and presented in a widescreen format. The image quality and sound are wonderful.  What is NOT wonderful is the pathetic presentation of this cinematic gem.  I couldn't believe it when I popped this into the DVD player and, lo and behold, no Menu!  No subtitles, no chapter stops, no extras!  While I rejoice in the fact that the film is available on disc...I am also appalled at the shabby presentation - or lack thereof - of this truly great and memorable film.  I always say - if you are going to do something, do it right!  The WB Archive Collection put NO thought or consideration in releasing this film - they just...threw it out there.  I have seen some of the worst movies EVER made get the royal treatment in their DVD presentation.  And here is a movie that - being based on an historical event - has not ONE extra!  There was a History Channel show about these events - and that would have been a fantastic extra (provided WB could have gotten the rights to it.)  But even so, no chapter stops!  Anyway, despite the flaws (the DVD case also has one of the worst covers I have ever seen; it looks more like a cover for a comedy!  They at least should have stuck with the picture on the VHS tape)...despite the flaws, see this movie!",1232841600,39,3182,4.541300527240773

Now we found it hurray :) the DVD works perfectly the movies is great but the subtitles are very poor!

The entire movie is subtitled in korean (both german and english), thats great for koreans.

But they only subtitled the English speaking characters in english, so when the german characters start speaking there is no english subtitles so we have no idea what they are talking about.

Its a sore dissapointment as the german dialogue is just as important as the english dialogue. Why on earth subtitle the English language with english subtitles? And leave the german un-subtitled?

It is yet another story of loyalty and bravery coming out of the war years that will forever leave an impression upon your soul.  I had a chance to visit Prague, just two weeks after first viewing the film, as well as the church and crypt where much of the action in the film takes place, and it is exactly as depicted in the movie.  In fact I am certain that the movie makers were allowed access to the crypt and the church when filming.

552195,5,6303082637,"Simply suberb dramatization of the events surrounding the assassination of much feared Nazi SS-Obergruppenfhrer and Acting Reichsprotector of Bohemia and Moravia, Reinhard Heydrich in May 1942. The raid was carried out by Czech resistance fighters, trained by the Britsh Army, who parachuted back into Czechoslovakia, and were further assisted by undercover members of local Czech resistance networks.

A strong cast of predominantly English actors, with the exception of American Timothy Bottoms as the Czech commando Jan Kubis, and German Anton Diffring as the ice cold, emotionless Reinhard Heydrich all contribute intelligent and believable performances. The film is based on the best selling book ""Seven Men at Daybreak"" by Alan Burgess, and directed by UK director Lewis Gilbert who had previously demonstrated his flair for directing solid WWII drama with films such as ""Sink the Bismarck"" and ""Carve Her Name With Pride"". ( Gilbert was also a key director of three of the James Bond series of films )  Although the film was obviously made on a modest budget, it in no way detracts from the strength of the story and the manner in which the actors effectively recreate the atmosphere of fear and terror that the Nazi's brought to occupied countries.

The film's final half hour is particulary moving and heart breaking as the Czech commando's realise they have been betrayed and the hordes of Nazi soldiers close in on their hiding place in the crypt of an old church. My only small gripe about the film, is that in several sequences there is German being spoken by the actors ( most notably by Anton Diffring ), however no subtitles are provided for the audience ?

Definitely, a lesser known ""sleeper"" amongst WWII movies, ""Operation Daybreak"" is well worth seeking out for fans of intense, character driven drama.",1110326400,8,1823,5.10738255033557
552196,5,6303082637,"This a gripping tale of the assassination of Heydrich. The only problem is that there are no subtitles for the German being spoken so those who are new to the movie will miss some vital lines. One of the main faults with the accuracy has to do with the convoy that  Heydrich had in the movie. He was so vain and self-assured that he never used guards or a convoy. He believed that his Czech's would never do anything against him. In the end his cockiness killed him. This movie deserves to be made into a DVD as the characters are gripping and tragic, and the story well worth the telling.",1096761600,7,589,4.306306306306307

The Prague location shots will only add to your appreciation of the story. The actors play their parts well. Scenary and costumes are very accurate. However, I was disappointed in two aspects of the VHS. First, it does not come with closed captions. Second, hardly surprising, the German characters speak German. The problem is that the listener has no idea what they are saying because there are no captions. Leaves you in the dark as to what is going on. The value of the film results from the accurate coverage of Heydrich as the Devil incarnate. Cold blooded, calculating, he is accurately portrayed as ruthless and vain. Once he is assassinated, the search for his killers will have you fully engaged in the film. See it. Well worth the time.",1003881600,12,912,4.852564102564102

7836445,4,6303082637,"RELEASED IN 1975 and directed by Lewis Gilbert, Operation: Daybreak tells the true story of Britain sending a trio of Czech-born commandos (Timothy Bottoms, etc.) to Czechoslovakia in 1942 to assassinate SS-General Reinhard Heydrich (Anton Diffring), Hitlers buddy, infamously known as the butcher of Prague. Unfortunately, the Czechs paid heavily with the SS eradication of the innocent village of Lidice, as well as (not shown) Lezhaky, the village where the parachutists dropped and received aid in the first act.

The movie plays like a docudrama with a haunting synth-based score, which some love and some hate (regardless, theres some period music as well). The story is a mix of drama, suspense, thrills and tragedy. Its not a typical WW2 movie due to the covert mission. Its more akin to The Guns of Navarone (1961), 36 Hours (1964), The Eagle has Landed (1977) and Valkyrie (2008), although of course the story is totally different.

One element of the plot will tick you off, but it happens (Im not going to give it away). Nicola Pagett is jaw-dropping beautiful. The authentic Czech Republic locations are a plus. This really happened; and the ending chronicles what happened to the Czechs.

THE FILM RUNS 118 minutes and was shot in the Prague area. WRITERS: Ronald Harwood (screenplay) & Alan Burgess (novel).
