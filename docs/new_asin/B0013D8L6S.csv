Mist is a sheepdog puppy who grows up in this film and learns the rules of being a good sheepdog.  She exemplifies the power of focus, courage, and attention, and gently teaches those lessons. Added to this is a setting that will calm your spirit, and photography that shimmers.

Mist gently lifts your spirit.  I highly recommend it.",1211328000,9,565,4.793814432989691

She is 7 1/2 now and still loves them.  They are perfect for her age range.  I don't mind watching them either.  The dogs are real working sheep dogs (you can look up their farm and even visit it if you are in Devon, UK).  The 1 star reviewer must have been watching this expecting this to be for adults.  And he doesn't like the accents.  Um, there are just as much of a variety of accents in England as there are here.  I think some of them are local Devon accents.  They didn't ""come up with them"".

Wow, was I right.  She was GLUED to the television the entire time.  I thought perhaps it was just a fluke so later in the day I played it a second time, and she again sat still and attentive through almost the entire movie.

This isn't a set -- this is actually David Kennard's farm, and the animals in the DVD are filmed at work, not ""acting"".

My grandsons (almost 4 and just 6), who live on a New England island farm with sheep, cows, chickens, and border collies just love this film and so do I.  Containing a series of vignettes of a puppy's life from birth through to working dog, it presents a very engaging story for kids (and their grandparents). Although the narration can be a bit hokey (because it is from the dog's viewpoint), the locations, in the west country of England are gorgeous, the filming is good, and the situations are real.  There is a bit of drama, a bit of humor, a little pathos, and lots of gentle lessons as well as a great and very true life story.  I can't recommend this movie highly enough...it beats Disney's films for kids all hollow (rather violent and contrived).  Please make more.",1225843200,3,818,4.537414965986395

3103006,1,B0013D8L6S,"It's the DVD cover that sold this movie for me. I love puppies and I'm a sucker for animal movies. One of the best being Homeward Bound. But this movie seems more like hours worth of home video footage spliced together with HORRIBLE voice acting and narration put on top of it. The people that voiced theses characters are among the worst I have ever heard. Some of the accents these people came up with were just terrible. It would be much more enjoyable watching this movie on MUTE! But even then it's not very good. The camera work is very amateurish. The picture is often out of focus and they don't even do a good job at keeping the dogs on screen all the time.

This movie is good for ages 2 and under. For everybody else, watch a better movie or buy a dog calendar.",1218240000,3,772,4.2517006802721085
3103007,4,B0013D8L6S,"I watched this movie because I love animals and wanted a break from the violence and gore of most recent releases. It is an oasis of good, clean family entertainment in a market where such products are increasingly rare.

The movie revolves around a border collie puppy born on a spectacularly beautiful sheep ranch near the ocean in the British Isles. As the puppy grows up, there is a question as to whether she can prove herself to be a talented sheep-herder and earn the right to stay with her family. An unusual, and rather old-fashioned, feature of this movie is that while the animal ""stars"" speak to each other in unique voices, there is no computer-assisted mouth movement or other modern CGI features generally associated with movies such as this. The actions (and accents) of the dogs, sheep, and ducks all fit who they are and what they are doing and saying, and the individual personalities of each animal become well developed. Kids will love this. Parents will too.

The plot contains some suspense, danger, humor, and (warning) the inevitable tear-jerking moment when one of the dogs dies of old age (very nicely handled). The scenery is magnificent, as is the photography, and the script, while a wee bit juvenile, is still better than scripts found in many ""adult"" movies.

If you have young children and want to do them (and yourself) a big favor, rent or buy this DVD. It is not as glossy as a Disney feature, but has an old-style beauty that simply glows. You will come to love Mist.",1217030400,23,1504,4.6893939393939394

3337498,5,B0013D8L6S,"I live in the UK, where Mist is shown in ten-minute episodes on the odd Saturday morning.  I've been waiting for two years to be able to send this to my nephew in the States.  It's an entirely engrossing, gentle, and comic ""reality"" show of the very best kind.

This isn't a set -- this is actually David Kennard's farm, and the animals in the DVD are filmed at work, not ""acting"".

For animal-loving adults, David Kennard's books are equally touching and entertaining.",1229126400,2,469,4.614457831325301
3337499,4,B0013D8L6S,"Mist is such a cute movie for kids. I wouldn't really recommend it for adults. It's a little corny but my 3 year old LOVES it!! We rented it and she just didn't understand why we had to take it back! I'm planning on getting her one for Christmas. She even pretends she is ""Mist"" the puppy around the house. So don't expect an Oscar award winning movie but it's great for young children!",1226016000,4,386,4.22972972972973
3337500,5,B0013D8L6S,"MIST is a wonderful movie for young kids.  My grandsons (almost 4 and just 6), who live on a New England island farm with sheep, cows, chickens, and border collies just love this film and so do I.  Containing a series of vignettes of a puppy's life from birth through to working dog, it presents a very engaging story for kids (and their grandparents). Although the narration can be a bit hokey (because it is from the dog's viewpoint), the locations, in the west country of England are gorgeous, the filming is good, and the situations are real.  There is a bit of drama, a bit of humor, a little pathos, and lots of gentle lessons as well as a great and very true life story.  I can't recommend this movie highly enough...it beats Disney's films for kids all hollow (rather violent and contrived).  Please make more.",1225843200,3,818,4.537414965986395
3337501,5,B0013D8L6S,"Not only is the cover cute, but the content is excellent!  The photography makes you feel as though you're there in person watching as another dog would watch and the accent is not a problem for most people and reflects the British Isles setting. There's a scene where puppies are born, so it is great to introduce children to birth. Absolutely adorable....absolutely delightful!",1220572800,4,379,5.015873015873016

3337503,1,B0013D8L6S,"It's the DVD cover that sold this movie for me. I love puppies and I'm a sucker for animal movies. One of the best being Homeward Bound. But this movie seems more like hours worth of home video footage spliced together with HORRIBLE voice acting and narration put on top of it. The people that voiced theses characters are among the worst I have ever heard. Some of the accents these people came up with were just terrible. It would be much more enjoyable watching this movie on MUTE! But even then it's not very good. The camera work is very amateurish. The picture is often out of focus and they don't even do a good job at keeping the dogs on screen all the time.

This movie is good for ages 2 and under. For everybody else, watch a better movie or buy a dog calendar.",1218240000,3,772,4.2517006802721085
3337504,4,B0013D8L6S,"I watched this movie because I love animals and wanted a break from the violence and gore of most recent releases. It is an oasis of good, clean family entertainment in a market where such products are increasingly rare.

The movie revolves around a border collie puppy born on a spectacularly beautiful sheep ranch near the ocean in the British Isles. As the puppy grows up, there is a question as to whether she can prove herself to be a talented sheep-herder and earn the right to stay with her family. An unusual, and rather old-fashioned, feature of this movie is that while the animal ""stars"" speak to each other in unique voices, there is no computer-assisted mouth movement or other modern CGI features generally associated with movies such as this. The actions (and accents) of the dogs, sheep, and ducks all fit who they are and what they are doing and saying, and the individual personalities of each animal become well developed. Kids will love this. Parents will too.

The plot contains some suspense, danger, humor, and (warning) the inevitable tear-jerking moment when one of the dogs dies of old age (very nicely handled). The scenery is magnificent, as is the photography, and the script, while a wee bit juvenile, is still better than scripts found in many ""adult"" movies.

If you have young children and want to do them (and yourself) a big favor, rent or buy this DVD. It is not as glossy as a Disney feature, but has an old-style beauty that simply glows. You will come to love Mist.",1217030400,23,1504,4.6893939393939394

8249830,5,B0013D8L6S,"I got this DVD from the bargain bin at Wal-Mart some time ago.  It is the tale of Mist's birth to becoming a sheepdog in the ""crew"" of this English sheep farm.  It is a human voice-over movie, like Homeward Bound, Racing Stripes and others.  I read one reviewer who didn't like the voice-overs and found the movie boring.  I disagree.  Sure, it's cute as a kid's movie and kids of a certain age would probably play it continuously.  My husband and I don't have children and we thought it was a fun movie.  We also enjoyed Homeward Bound and Racing Stripes.  I replayed just recently and found I enjoyed it as much as the first time I played it.  I have recently added two more Mist DVD's to my library and probably will add the third one I lack soon.  I think it's a valuable volume in my video library.",1462665600,,803,4.258278145695364
