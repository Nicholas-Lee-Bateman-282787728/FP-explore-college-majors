841789,3,6304316291,"LOVING COUPLES is a cute little romantic comedy which is only noteworthy for it's quartet of stars (Shirley MacLaine, James Coburn, Susan Sarandon and Stephen Collins).  It has a lovely musical score and a great supporting performance from Sally Kellerman as the seductive Mrs Liggett.

The plot is thin.  Shirley MacLaine plays the vivacious wife of a doctor (James Coburn) who falls in love with a real-estate agent (Stephen Collins).  MacLaine's husband then proceeds to have an affair with the girlfriend of Collins (Susan Sarandon).

Enjoyable fluff, elevated by it's stars, especially luminous Shirley MacLaine.",1106006400,7,617,5.4526315789473685

Hot Toasty Rag, June 26, 2017

Everyone knows Shirley MacLaine can dance. So what happened? Its a very small part of the movie, but theres a scene where Shirley dances around to a groovy tune with her lover. Either shes absolutely clueless without a choreographer, or the choreographer wanted the audience to think she was completely unskilled. For me, that was the most memorable part of Loving Couples. The rest of it wasn't much better.

In the film, a middle-aged man leaves his wife for a younger woman. In response, his wife takes up with a younger man. Awkward situations, supposed jealousies, and incredibly unconvincing romances take up the screen for 90 minutes. Plus, it's pretty much the exact same plot as A Change of Seasons, also starring Shirley MacLaine, and also from 1980. Skip this one, even if you're a Shirley MacLaine or Susan Sarandon fan; it just isn't worth it.",1498435200,,914,4.852564102564102

7867896,4,6304316291,"Loving Couples is a period piece and a half! A very accurate depiction of life in California at the end of the 1970's. Everyone does a respectable job while none really distinguish themselves. I like this movie because it reminds me of California during a period I spent quite a bit of time there. Lots of location filming. It's a good movie, but I doubt it will make your top 10.",1364083200,,380,4.366197183098592

7867899,3,6304316291,"Dr. Evelyn Lucas Kirby (Shirley MacLaine) is married to Dr. Walter Kirby (James Coburn). Their marriage has become very boring and Walter is rather self-absorbed with his medical career and his status in the medical world. When Evelyn stops to help Malibu Real Estate Agent Greg Plunkett (Stephen Collins) who has had a minor horse riding accident, he flirts with her, and like a stereotypical Real Estate Agent won't take no for an answer. He persistently woos her until she finally gives in. This causes his girlfriend, Weather Girl Stephanie Beck (Susan Sarandon), to visit Dr. Walter and complain. When her suspicions are confirmed the two commiserate over a drink, which leads to them indulging in a little revenge sex. Like changing partners in a square dance they go on this way for a while, with a little Do Si Do from Mrs. Liggett (Sally Kellerman), a rich client of Greg's, who insists on trying out the bed in a house he shows her.

I couldn't believe this movie was made in 1980 because it seems like a throwback to some mid 70's TV show like Love American Style or The Love Boat, where the announcer would pronounce the word ""love"" in a cutsey-wootsey way that would almost make you want to puke. Stephen Collins was a handsome but bland actor who reminded me of John Tesh, but without his devil-may-care charisma. At least Tesh had a new age music career and a fling with Oprah in his checkered past. The other three members of the two revolving couples would go on to be Oscar winners, and receive multiple nominations as well. Coburn won for Afflicted, MacLaine scored in Terms of Endearment, and Sarandon won as the nun in Dead Man Walking. Even Kellerman, who played the libidinous Mrs. Liggett, was nominated for an Oscar for playing 'Hot Lips' O'Houlihan in Robert Altman's MASH. How the mighty have fallen.

Director Jack Smight has done some decent films, but mostly works in TV, and it shows. The funniest thing about him is his name (I smite thee, Jack Smight)--like when you saw that the hair stylist on 'Leave It To Beaver' was Florence Bush. Coburn is a likeable actor, good in action roles or in spoofing them, as in Hudson Hawk, or In Like Flint--but he was 'afflicted' with a very dull character. Dr. Walter Kirby wasn't exactly the juiciest of roles for him to sink his teeth into. Kind of a stick-in-the-mud, wet blanket. Shirley was cute and perky as a neglected older woman. This was kind of a low ebb for her, but three years later she'd win her Oscar, after many nominations, for Terms of Endearment. Susan Sarandon lowered herself to the level of this film--perhaps even lower, if that is possible. She didn't really show any of her potential here.

Bottom Line is that I bought this video at the Goodwill for 75 cents, and still feel like it was a rip off. The most interesting thing about it is how much talent went into it, only to be wasted.
