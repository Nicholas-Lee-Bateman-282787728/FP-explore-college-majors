8405467,3,B003TTZT9G,"If you want  to see a talkie movie with William Boyd, before Hopalong Cassidy, this is one possibility.
It played ok, but the quality (as I believe most 1920's/1930's issued by ""Oldies"") is quite poor. There are hints of ""Hoppy"" in the take-charge attitude by Boyd, in this one, & he comes off as a very cocky, self-centered ladies man. Comes around at the end, but the poor quality of the film is distracting. You will be able to see why it is so in-expensive. Should be better choices for early Boyd films.",1399507200,3,508,4.462365591397849
