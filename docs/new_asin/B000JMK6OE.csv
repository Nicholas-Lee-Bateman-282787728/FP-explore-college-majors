2677836,5,B000JMK6OE,"I'm not a BDSM fan or even in the life style, although I have some friends who are, and they tell me that this film has sparked a huge controversy in that community. I just like good storytelling and good film making and I have to say THE PET excels in both these categories. When you see how easy it is to be taken advantage of, when you trust other people - whoever they are, you will be moved - the movie is shockingly real.

Performances by Pierre Du Lat and Andrea Edmondson are particularly involving, and the score by Chris Walden is mesmerizing. It's a wonderful slice of a very unknown life -- if the bizarre interests you - you'll no doubt get a serious thrill from THE PET.",1165795200,7,684,4.2615384615384615
2677837,5,B000JMK6OE,"I am puzzled by other reviewer's desire to pigeonhole this film into a ""genre"" or ""statement"" about either lifestyle or specifically as the creator's social commentary on current affairs.  I found The Pet a fascinating and tender exploration of the transformation of two very different people through the bond and experience of their unique, loving, respectful relationship against the backdrop of already clearly defined and labeled ""alternative lifestyle"" crowd and the tragic, horrifying reality of modern slavery. One must put aside personal expectations of this film presenting yet another version of a BDSM, D/S or human rights call-to-action and instead quietly observe the complex unfolding of a precious, fragile metamorphosis in the midst of adversity which is rare and beautiful to behold. Step outside of the box and into the humanity of this story!",1165795200,6,861,5.425373134328358
2677838,5,B000JMK6OE,"It's no wonder that some of the previous comments mock and attempt to diminish this film. Its subject matter, based in factual research, is both stomach-churning and thought-provoking. That the human slave trade is alive and well in the 21st Century, in the ""Free World,"" makes us uncomfortable, and we try to deflect those feelings through sarcasm. Totally understandable, but a disservice to this film. This film bravely sought to shed light on this disturbing phenomenon, so that we might discuss it and possibly strategize how to put a stop to it. The credits alone, which list some of the slave trade statistics discovered in pre-production, are worth watching. I look forward to more meaningful work from this talented director, production crew and actors.",1165795200,16,762,5.153225806451613
2677839,5,B000JMK6OE,"An insightful movie that exposes an alternative lifestyle that I am sure many did not know exists.  The movie shows how many of us are involved in some form of ""consensual slavery"" that dictates what we do everyday.  Many of us are satisfied with that arrangement, the status quo, as long as we have ""no worries,"" as the movie suggests.  The fact that the movie does not involve lots of sex and violence allows the above messages to be successfully conveyed to the viewer.  Alternative lifestyles exist, more that I know, and perhaps more than you know.",1165795200,9,553,4.670103092783505
2677840,5,B000JMK6OE,"This is a deeply disturbing film that points out that slavery is still practiced today.  Focusing on the exchange of power between two individuals and beautifully photographed, one is appalled at how easily a person can give up control of one's life and ultimately one's very existence no matter how well intentioned the exchange may be perceived by the participants. Most disturbing to me was the attitude of the wealthy & the traffickers who had no regard for the 'pets' as human beings, but simply as commodities for their own purposes whether it be labor, sex, a pet or replacement body parts(the last two are what this film portrays).",1165795200,12,639,4.862385321100917
2677841,1,B000JMK6OE,"If I could give this film less than 1 star I would!!!  This film has been all over the internet being billed as a film about BDSM.  If that is what you are looking for, please look elsewhere!  Aside from the fact that the acting is terrible, cinematography completely laughable, the film isn't about BDSM at all!!!  That was simply a cover to market the film on BDSM discussion lists.

Seriously, you can find a better use for your $15.00.",1165795200,5,439,4.4375
2677842,5,B000JMK6OE,"I loved this movie - it shows people can be different and because it is not about a car chase nor an over paid Hollywood celebrity and it deals with a dark subject some may not understand it. I found it intriguing - I checked on the conditions and found the facts are there -- IT HAPPENS wake up!

The photography was beautiful - the actors are believable and I applaud filmmakers taking a risk. And although it is not about BDSM it is an intelligent and thought provoking movie!",1165622400,5,479,4.322222222222222
2677843,1,B000JMK6OE,"For all the advertising and hype that went on about this movie, they should have invested that money into research into the BDSM, M/s, Master/pet lifestyle.  Then they should have invested more in someone to rewrite the poorly written script, then someone that knows how to film, and someone to edit properly.

I've seen high school kids make movies that were better made than this.  I'm not sure if the actors could have done better if it was written better but they didn't seem to know what they already were given to work with.

Had this been made better, it could have compared consensual slavery or the life of a human pet with a Master to slave trading but this fell far short of the mark.  I was very disappointed in it.  It took me 2 days to watch it just because of how poorly the film was made.",1165622400,6,804,4.3624161073825505
2677844,1,B000JMK6OE,"This film wins my vote for ""Most Disappointing Film of 2006"".

The actors sounded as if they were all reading in

monotone from cue cards.  The film quality made those

old 8mm films from the 60's look high-tech.

It's not a BDSM film.  It's not even a D/s film.

It's barely a film at all.

For those unfamiliar with the premise, this very

wealthy man's prize-winning Irish Setter dies, and he

sets about obtaining another pet, one who will love

him unconditionally.  He has two goons looking around

Santa Monica, CA for just such a pet for him.  The

girl that they find just lost her cat (it died), has a

scumbag for a boyfriend, and gets her 3 day eviction

notice from her apartment.  She's a flower arranger,

and works in the street market.  Mr. Moneybags finds

her and begins to befriend her, giving her a lot of

money, and a place to bury her cat on his estate.  He

convinces her to agree to a two-day trial as his pet

(big bucks are offered for this trial).  She of course

accepts.  He sets about training her as a retriever.

From there, the viewer is spiralled into the white

slave trade (and the actors, who are supposed to be

very wealthy, prominent folks are about as believable

as if they had cast Gumby and Pokey in there to

portray the Rockefellers).  It gets worse as the

viewer learns that within the white slave trade, these

very docile ""pets"" are also used as organ donors.

The plot is thin, the characters are unbelievable and

shallow, the BDSM is non-existent, the acting is

non-existent... and the message seems to be that,

while Mr. Moneybags is this wonderful person who is

vehemently against white slavery, he's not at all

savvy enough to avoid being hornswaggled by the slave

traders.

Prior to the credits rolling, there's a long list of

countries, and the part they play in the white slave

trade (whether a place of origin for slaves, or a

destination).

The message of the movie has virtually nothing to do

with consensual ownership, and everything to do with

making a political statement against the international

trade of human flesh.  While it's a noble cause, it

falls flat on its face on both counts.",1165622400,10,2167,4.551181102362205
2677845,5,B000JMK6OE,"I can see what all the internet buzz is about, This Indy-drama is a fascinating look into the alternative lifestyle, master/slave relationship and  also, in a very dramatic way, raises awareness about the shocking Global Slave Trade Market.  THE PET is groundbreaking in that it's the first movie to depict this adult-alternative lifestyle of human Pets.  A subtle blend of bondage & m/s is mixed into this beautiful story of how the love/bond between Master & Pet is ultimately their downfall as they encounter international slave traffickers who take advantage of their unique love bond...all this makes for an unforgettable ground-breaking movie experience. This film is beautifully photographed and directed, and is the first film since ""Secretary"" that delves into alternate lifestyle in a truthful way.

I had no idea there was so much good and bad video erotica on the subject (guess I grew up sheltered, and I know my girlfriend did).  We have watched about 15 production and maybe 30 porn films in the genre and I have to tell you, this is by far the best.  The characters are believable in their roles and the situations are (almost) completely believeable.

I enjoyed Red and the others.  I have read through the other reviews and would point out that this was not the production of a major motion studio, was not made by super-stars and was not written and directed by Truman Capote.  It was, and is, a nice production with a decent plot by a small company which did a good job with what it had to work with and, again, is the best thing I have seen so far in the genre.  It is certainly easier to buy, and the characters more believeable in their roles than anyone in Redford's Indecent Proposal, which someone (for no clear reason) compared it to below.

This film demonstrates the difference between erotic videos and adult videos.

It is striking in its direct yet not in-your-face sexual attraction but in a different context, a different lifestyle.  And because of this it is definitely not for everyone (as the mixed reviews indicate).  If you find (or think you might find) voluntary submissiveness in and of itself erotic and appealing then this movie is definitely worthwhile.

2678086,2,B000JMK6OE,"Steve's career as a photojournalist has given him sight of the realities of slavery.  His photography reflects the harshness of brutal reality.  It is no surprise that he seems to have not got a firm handle on the emotions of the lifestylers that chose this way of life.  The lack of interpersonal emotion and, to a degree, the wooden acting can, I believe, be placed at the door of Steve's experiences.  The dialogue should have been co-written as the conversation sequences were wrong and felt implausible and unreal and that problem should have been caught.  The whole project felt rushed and has foot in neither the world of the lifestyler or the enforced slave.

Great locations, quality cinematography and the snow scene was enjoyable, but I wouldn't say that this represents many realities.  The conflict scenes were not choreographed well, nor confrontational tension handled very well at all. Video effects and tension music had to be employed to convey any impact and this gave the project a very rushed feel.  Also, people who are branded usually scream an awful lot more, straight from the heart, and usually pass out with the level of pain; that branch in her mouth would have been bitten in two - one example of taking a powerful situation to emphasise the impact of the circumstances and then only pawing at it half heartedly.

The overall timing and pace of the sequences just felt completely wrong.  Sections where I was looking to invest my emotions were rushed or glossed over, and others which didn't have that much impact beyond sexual tittilation felt dragged out.  In short, they had a wonderful opportunity but I felt they squandered it and I felt cheated as a result.",1215388800,23,1692,4.840277777777778

2678088,1,B000JMK6OE,"Whoever pitched this idea to Tla and whoever approved the idea there needs to go back to film school. The trailer and the first part of the film actually are good, up to a point. A quality independent movie that suddenly degrades into a really cheap B-Movie.

The first part of the film is a pretty good and well thought out plotline of sorts; we get slightly introduced to the underground slave market theme abit, and then it goes to the main character trying to replace his lost pet. After a search, he courts a troubled yet eager young woman that is going thru a hard time and offers her a way out. We also see some inklings of the Underground Slave Trade, while are seamlessly tied into the main story.

Past the ""training"" sequences, the movie takes an abrupt and ridiculous turn, plus adds many confusing elements into a so far okay movie. The Underground Slave Market is portrayed as a ridiculous parody of more organized Slave Auctions in other forms of fiction, with a basement-level ""command center"" and a dismal selection of slaves. A subplot then is injected into the movie where other ""Owners"" wish to breakup the relationship between the man and pet.

I can see where the filmmakers were trying to make a semi-realistic movie, but in an effort to be abit more mainstream, they screwed-up on the story to the point of it being laughable. They try to paint a picture where this sort of thing happens on a daily basis, but fall short where it's needed in visual impact, only opting to allude to the horror via words. I think the movie suffers because of this.

2678089,2,B000JMK6OE,"This will contain some spoilers, but this information needs to be known before you spend your money on this film.  The Pet could have been a nice little film about a power exchange alternative lifestyle, even as unlikely as 24/7 animal/pet play may be.  It had enough budget and was shot well enough.  Even the actors were good enough(some were distinctly better than others though).  Pierre Dulat as Philip was quite good.  Andrea Edmondson as Mary/GG was also decent enough.
My BIG problem with the film is that the makers promoted it as a ""true"" look into a caring, power exchange alternate lifestyle.  The maker's website description is misleading as is the film's trailer.  They tell you the main characters are intruded upon by international slavers.  In fact, the main characters (except for Mary/GG) are all business partners and friends in a kidnapping/murdering syndicate that deals in selling body parts and slave laborers.  Philip's wish that Mary/GG not be sold as such is purely his personal wish.  So, once again a chance to make a film showing the beauty of a loving dominant/submissive relationship is turned into just another demonization of the BDSM community.  By this depiction, you are either crazy, evil or just plain stupid to participate in such a lifestyle.  Yet, the makers promote this film as being about a loving consensual relationship.  Its really just an exploitation film and
when you break down the ridiculous plot, there really is not much left to
like. One example of this plot is after a couple weeks of training, having your Pet be devoid of nearly all cognitive function(they do say that clearly).  So, we have people talking about murdering their Pets and selling the organs right in front of them with no reaction.  Oh, come on!
Non consensual Slave Trade is a serious subject and one that deserves much better than this film to bring attention to it.
Having said that, I did give The Pet two stars.  It is filmed
well enough and it does have some nice scenes in it. Mary/GG and Nicky/Taps(played by Sommer Nguyan)fetching sticks in the nude outdoors
(in real snow and cold) is a standout.  If you do see it, it is clear they did it for real.  The other reason is the always lovely Lydia McLane(under a pseudonym Jane Steele), as Red. She has a particularly nice scene at the beginning of the film.
This is not a film to set as an example of any BDSM power exchange lifestyle.  It is a terribly flawed, shamelessly misrepresented exploitation film.  If you don't care about spending the money and seeing it for the few good scenes it does contain, you might get some enjoyment.

I can report that the actual film has a plot that is convoluted and crippled with an absence of logic.  This effort tries to be many things, including being a lifestyle film with some thrill components, a morality tale, and, partly, a film that dips slightly into the psychological exploration of D/s.  The result is a nicely photographed steaming pile of celluloid filled with bad acting and really bad lines that was incredibly disappointing to see.

At the begining they say that this represents people who voluntarily become slaves- but it looked more like these people were being brainwashed at best. If you are expecting this to be erotic you might be dissapointed.  The slaves are naked but the creeps that keep them treat them more like dogs than lovers.  Actually most people that I know treat their dogs much better.  It is not necessarily well researched either.",1179878400,4,548,4.597938144329897

This is a shocking look at the world of consensual slavery the good and the bad of it. The highs and the danger of being someone's personal slave. IT'S A REAL EYE OPENER. Beautifully photographed and the director has really done his research on the lifestyle.

2678131,3,B000JMK6OE,"This is a strange mix of two, I suspect discrete, worlds, voluntary female submission and trafficking. Concentrating on the BDSM community aspects would be interesting. Perhaps building on the intro clips, showing 'Jane Steele' being taken into ownership. Perhaps a less fanciful use of the principals. Yes, there are petgirls, ponygirls and websites to prove it, but the majority of women who go for this at the Dominance and submission end are of the surrendered wife form; at the Master slave end are of the 'scening' and 'sex club' sort. Some at that end merge into a form of prostitution, but trafficking is a different and abhored world and the suggestion of intermix is peculiar. The typical reality is normal people from all walks of life who enjoy a form of power exchange, either temporarily or, as they put it, 24/7, who are catered for by some websites that were misrepresented in the film. Trafficking has also been much better dealt with in serious, critically acclaimed works, notably in the UK. In essence, the real world, using better scripts, better actors and less hype would almost certainly be better. It was also amusing that they had a brief clip of male slaves, presumably to maintain a nod in the direction of sexual equality. Would I recommend it for other than a few prurient scenes? not really.",1169078400,6,1322,4.853982300884955
2678132,1,B000JMK6OE,"I would NOT recommend this movie to anyone.  Although the preview looked great, the movie itself was horrible!  The plot was ridiculous, the acting atrocious, all in all it was pathetic.  The movie was not entertaining or erotic; it actually left me feeling miserable after watching it!  Put it this way, it was so bad that after viewing the movie I immediately gave it away.  Please, do not waste your time or money on ""The Pet"".

ALSO......

I just read a few of the other reviews, and although most people seem to agree that this movie is trash, I noticed that there are a couple who believe this type of garbage actually depicts a true D/s relationship. I am shocked. This movie has absolutely nothing to do with D/s or Master/slave relationships. To think that some people believe that this is how this lifestyle functions is truly frightening. I have lived a 24/7 lifestyle for the past 6 years and I can tell you that this movie is far from accurate. This is just my humble opinion, however, I have both seen and done quite a bit in this lifestyle. I know that D/s is not for everyone and I would never say that this lifestyle is without its flaws... BUT to even think that this movie come close to depicting a D/s relationship is ludicrous.",1168819200,5,1248,4.495575221238938
2678133,1,B000JMK6OE,"This movie is being promoted in its trailer and on its website as having something to do with the BDSM and consensual Master/slave relationships practiced by some in this community. In fact it is a piece of total BS that is about kidnapping women, selling them, killing them and selling their body parts. The plot makes no sense. All the details about such relationships are wrong. The presentation of ""training"" and its results are laughable. If you want to watch a couple of naked women running around and being treated like dogs for part of the movie, then it may be worthwhile, but unlike the opinion of some others here, this movie has nothing to do with anything that happens in the real world. And the acting, editing, etc. are not even B movie quality.",1168560000,108,760,4.637037037037037
2678134,5,B000JMK6OE,"The Pets' lead Actress Andrea Edmondson offers a very superb acting performance of a submissive woman. Frenchman Pierre Du Lat looks the role very much so, of a man of wealth and power as well. I never knew this type of slavery existed until now. I am familiar with Mr. D Stevens' (world wide) photojournalism work. I applaud Mr. Stevens' effort and commitment to bring his true story to life and share it with the world.

  Obviously, this movie will create an impact on the Global Slavery Trafficking market. We live in a world of heightened awareness on terrorism & priceless measures of security to combat it.  It will be very interesting to see how  the national security of our Government and our Allied Countries take a plan of action to ferret out and apprehend the slave trafficking Lords of this black global market. Regardless of all the pro/con reviews and The Pets' box return, in my book, The Pet deserves an academy award for its contribution to Humanitarianism!",1167436800,8,977,4.757396449704142

This movie does not act as guide for the alterative lifestyles, this movie isn't even good enought o be a B rate drama or action flick. Truely this movie is a waste of time.

2678136,1,B000JMK6OE,"A provocative trailer leads one to think this is about a form of D/s alternative lifestyle. It is not. It actually states that a person's cognitive abilities can be reduced to near nothing with a couple of weeks 'training'. There is near nothing in the way of training shown in the movie. There is no communication, only behavior purchased for large sums of money. This consist of not talking and being nude, leashed, and caged. This does not make it a BDSM story! Then that is even blown when it is revealed that he and his friends are using this method to find people to sell to 'someone' so their organs can be harvested and sold. Only mention of matching qualities for organ transplant is blood type. This does not make it an organ stealing/selling story! He, for no apparent reason suddenly changes his mind and doesn't want to sell her. This doesn't make it a love story! Out of the blue there is text at the end about the amount of slavery in various areas of the world. This does not make it a slavery story!

It is filmed and directed fairly well and looks to be a movie of some type, but if you scratch you will find there isn't really one underneath.

However if if a few scenes of an attractive woman runing around wearing only a collar and a leash will turn you on in either a vanilla or BDSM mannor, then by all means watch it.",1167436800,8,1341,4.338645418326693
2678137,5,B000JMK6OE,"After the initial shock, for the mainstream lifestylers a.k.a. ""newbies,"" who are under the mistaken, but albeit understandable, impression that the BDSm lifestyle, be it leather or non-leather, must, by definition, include a St. Andrews Cross at some private home/club/dungeon or a pair of floggers and leather pants, wears off, many will begin to see just how much of a lifestyle movie ""The pet"" is in both substance and form.

Believe it or not, years from now, this is a movie that will be spoken of in the same regard as movies ""Story of O"" and ""Secretary.""  Why? Compared to the two other movies just mentioned, ""The pet"" comes the closest, ever in My humble opinion, to authentically portraying what one possible 24/7 Master and slave relationship would look like - this relationship happens to use an Owner/pet dynamic to express the M/s relationship.

And I note the Master did have the pet sign a slave contract after all. ;)

Moreover, and contrary to popular belief, there are many different and unique relationships in the lifestyle worldwide that do not exactly fit into a Master and slave paradigm.  For example, one relationship may involve three people, Master A owning slave A, and slave A also being a Master to another slave, slave B, and all of this working harmoniously under one roof.  With that said, ""The pet"" is but one of the many types of relationships that can manifest upon a foundation of BDSm. It is through this lens ""The pet"" is best, if not properly, viewed.

To be quite candid, the acting overall is not going to be up for an academy award this time around - but this actually helps make the movie seem more real. The people who played the Master and the pet did an outstanding job, especially the pet.  Edmondson, the actress who played the pet, is not properly depicted in any of the promotional material, and probably for good reason on a personal level, as taking on this role was certainly a risky venture in the uptight ""fantasy vanilla world"" where no one is as they seem - and having her face plastered everywhere might raise problems with the hypocrites that plague that fantasy world.  If that would not have been a problem for her, then this was a serious error in judgment. Edmondson is stunning to just look at, a solid 9 in My peculiar book, and her face on the cover and posters would have attracted more attention.  Also, for someone who is not into the lifestyle, her acting is so convincing that I am sure watching this movie would move some seasoned Masters to believe Edmondson is probably slaving in her private life - I cannot say I was so fooled. ;)

The actor, who portrays the Master, Du Lat, fit the role of an eccentric man of wealth well and portrayed those of his ilk in the real world of the lifestyle with impressive accuracy.  His love of his previous pet, an actual canine, inspired him to seek out a similar relationship with a fellow human being - and showing amazing depth and understanding of the complexity of the lifestyle, the Master character does not have a sexual relationship with his pet. It is one of service, which can be just as pleasing, if not more so.

An interesting contrast between the subtleties of fiction and reality is the fact the pet was paid/offered large sums of money for her submission/agreement to serve him as his pet  - in reality, and more often than not, no such payment is required, and interestingly enough, a woman will give everything she has and more to be at the foot of a Master. I also appreciated how quickly the pet character submitted and fell into her new role, because, as hard as it may be for a vanilla person/mainstream lifestyler to believe, when a woman finds a Master she can surrender to, she submits wholly and with great haste - something the Master must handle with great care. Towards the end of the movie, and with great credit to D. Stevens, it is made clear that the money is meaningless to the pet and that all she wants in the world is to be at her Master's feet.

In the end, it was the Master's Pride that ripped His happiness away, just as it does for Us all in the lifestyle time and time again in one way or another. For budding Masters and Dominants, the lesson concerning the destructive nature of Pride makes this movie a must see. I also suggest the Shakespearian poem: ""The Rape of Lucrece.""

Although the intent of the movie was to bring the international slave trade to light, which is did and did surprisingly well, My humble opinion is that this movie's greatest impact will be how it heightens a much needed awareness of not only the existence of the lifestyle for vanillas plugged in and trapped in their fantasy based prison, but it will also raise a much needed awareness of the rich diversity that exists in the lifestyle itself in the minds of T/those in the leather and non-leather BDSm communities alike who are similarly trapped in cliques paradigms.
