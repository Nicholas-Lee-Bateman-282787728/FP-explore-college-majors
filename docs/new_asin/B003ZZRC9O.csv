4237459,5,B003ZZRC9O,"Krister Henricksson is a fantastic Wallander, and refrains from Branagh's overacting (and Branagh also changes the endings to suit himself).

If you want gripping thrillers, agonizing suspense, and total authenticity, buy Krister Henricksson's interpretation of the famed Swedish detective, Kurt Wallander. English subtitles do not take anything away from the enjoyment.

Rolf Lassgrd, a great Swedish actor, also has several Wallander films out, and is the favorite Wallander of author Henning Mankell. Again, so far superior to the Branagh versions, it will boggle your mind.",1301702400,3,577,5.776470588235294
4237460,5,B003ZZRC9O,"It's hard to resist a well written (or performed) mystery.  Henning Mankell knows how to write mysteries that will keep you entranced to the very end and the Swedish productions of his novels are equally compelling.  While I love the Kenneth Branagh PBS Wallender's, I believe this series is even better!  It has a very strong cast, with Krister Henricksson as a sensative and thoughtful Kurt Wallander and Johanna Sallstrom as his, now, police officer daughter Linda, leading the cast.  These are well worth reading the subtitles for, and are certainly mysteries I will watch over and over, as well as share with friends.",1299801600,14,622,4.951923076923077
4237461,5,B003ZZRC9O,"Note that this review covers the Wallander series Episodes 4-13, three sets of DVDs.
These dramatisations of the Henning Mankell who-done-its continue with their excellent story telling.  The characters are properly rounded out so that you feel that you ""know"" them after a few episodes. The subtitles are easy to read and (my personal preference) better than having a dubbed version, where the voices do not always ""fit"" the characters.
These Swedish productions are much superior to the UK (Branagh) series, which appeared only to be a vehicle for Branagh.",1297209600,11,558,5.2
4237462,4,B003ZZRC9O,"As advertised, good product, just wish they had an option for English sound track.",1416268800,,82,4.928571428571429
4237463,5,B003ZZRC9O,"This is basic DVD information. The region 1 release of the first season of the original Swedish Wallander was done in installment sets. This is the 2nd set of Season 1. One would assume that means it contains the episodes; ""The Overdose aka The Darkness"", ""The African"" and ""Mastermind"". The Amazon product description above fails to mention.",1413763200,2,342,5.017543859649122
4237464,5,B003ZZRC9O,"A real nail biter, the most suspenseful episode yet!",1410220800,,52,4.888888888888889

4237468,3,B003ZZRC9O,"I enjoyed the first two mysteries on this set, then MASTERMIND came on.

MASTERMIND (presented here in 2:33-1 anamorphic widescreen, not 1:77-1) was actually a theatrical movie.  This story is full of suspense cliches (the policeman forgets to put sugar in his coffee so he goes back to get some and the killer...), sigh!
This episode is more like a spoof of all of the cliches used in suspense movies!  Truly a missed opportunity, it starts out good then oh!
I think they had a 70 minute story and needed to pad it out to 98 minutes.

The first set with episodes 1 - 3 was much stronger.",1404432000,,588,4.416666666666667
4237469,5,B003ZZRC9O,I have watched all of the Wallander series available on streaming but do not like the idea of paying extra for it.  These episodes should be available on Amazon Prime at no additional cost.,1403049600,,189,4.5588235294117645
4237470,4,B003ZZRC9O,"The Swedish version of Wallander played by Krister Henriksson is different then the BBC version.  Krister's Wallander is older, wiser and with less flaws then Kenneth Branagh's Wallander which has more warts and all. Both are entertaining to watch but we did enjoy the Swedish production and highly recommend it.",1400803200,,312,5.24
4237471,5,B003ZZRC9O,"Love Mankell's books. Love Henriksson as the main character. Hope to someday own all of these, which will take awhile as they are a little pricey.",1400371200,,146,4.653846153846154
4237472,5,B003ZZRC9O,This series is absolutely excellent. I would recommend it to anyone that likes detective mysteries as long as you don't mind the subtitles. Possibly my favorite show out there!,1398297600,,176,5.103448275862069
4237473,5,B003ZZRC9O,Great series. Enjoyed it very much,1397952000,,34,4.833333333333333
4237474,5,B003ZZRC9O,I have to pace my purchases as I love everything about this brilliant Danish series!!! Hope to buy more of the latest series from 14 on soon.,1395878400,,141,4.2592592592592595
4237475,5,B003ZZRC9O,"We have seen a lot of this series and the series made after, but this one really hit us. Includes michael nyqvist as the really bad guy, somewhere between Moriarity and Hannibal.",1395792000,,178,4.59375
4237476,5,B003ZZRC9O,I prefer this series over the series done with Kenneth Branagh.  This has authenticity. Great acting with wonderful plot and characters.  It well worth the rental fee.,1395705600,,167,5.148148148148148
4237477,5,B003ZZRC9O,"A great Wallander episode which pits Wallander against a clever and resourceful psychopath set on revenge. When a murdered woman's body is found hanging upside down from the ceiling; a taxi driver is stabbed to death; apparent leaks in the investigation leads Wallander to believe the murderer is one of their own. When his daughter is kidnapped by the serial killer, the investigation takes the cat and mouse game to another level.",1394323200,,432,5.013888888888889
4237478,5,B003ZZRC9O,"This series is fantastic.  Realistic and a good story line.  Episode 6 is especially a cliff hanger which is solved.  The actor playing Wallander portrays the character in Mankell's books perfectly.  We watched the British series done in English by English actors and they just did not portray Wallander as presented in the books.  So, even though it is in Swedish with English sub-titles, it is well worth viewing.",1393632000,,415,4.956521739130435
4237479,4,B003ZZRC9O,Always good.  Much better than most of the American made series.  Hope that there is a 3rd season being made.,1391385600,,109,4.4

what can i do my  favorite detective series",1391126400,,118,4.8
4237481,5,B003ZZRC9O,Scandinavian crime novels are the best this is the epiphany of Scandinavian crime novels turned into video I loved it,1387670400,,117,4.9
4237482,4,B003ZZRC9O,We have not watched it but we believe that it will be as inbteresting as the others we have ordered.,1381104000,,100,4.05
4237483,5,B003ZZRC9O,"and from Linda Wallander, too. This episode was awesome! So much suspense I could hardly watch. The villain ""toyed"" with the detectives, baiting them with their own children. It was horrible and yet I couldn't stop watching. Because I trusted Kurt Wallander to solve the case, and he sure did. Excellent ending.

This was so much better than the book!",1376956800,,351,4.85
4237484,5,B003ZZRC9O,"This was the best episode in the series thus far. The photography was exceptional and lent itself to an overall gripping show. But the story was one that was both terrifying and also kept you guessing until the end. Brilliant performances by the cast and ever-deepening relationships among them. These police officers remain still human with weakness, vulnerability, and also demonstrating incredible courage.",1376784000,2,409,5.507936507936508
4237485,5,B003ZZRC9O,"An absolute gem,  this is one of the very best of suspense films in the great Wallander series. I love each of the Wallander episodes, and this one is outstanding.",1376179200,,163,4.433333333333334
4237486,4,B003ZZRC9O,"It makes absolutely no sense to me that you can get the later versions free and yet these earlier ones cost $ 4.99/piece for a rental?  Come on! It should be the opposite!  In any case, if you want the REAL Mankell's  Wallander, stay away from the PBS tripe and stick with this original gritty series.",1375833600,,301,4.339285714285714
4237487,5,B003ZZRC9O,"I have seen now all the versions of Wallander . I have read all of Mankel's books. They are all good, worth watching. As unusual for thinking, NPR, PBS type folks you will like these, and yet again be resigned , is that the word, to the fact that American commercial TV is so stupid. We bought a region 2 player just to watch some Rolf versions. Now can get at MhZ.",1365638400,3,365,4.083333333333333
4237488,5,B003ZZRC9O,"Best combination of mystery, cop story, and artistic drama I've ever seen.  Way better than Foyle's War, and almost up there with The Wire.",1364083200,,139,4.791666666666667
4237489,5,B003ZZRC9O,"I've come to love the Swedish Mysteries/Procedurals. On the whole, they are grittier and more believable than the typical US product.",1362009600,,133,5.380952380952381
4237490,4,B003ZZRC9O,As someone with a Scandinavian background this series is far superior to its English remake. It would be even better if there is an occasional light moment.,1361750400,,156,4.814814814814815
4237491,5,B003ZZRC9O,"The whole series is worth watching. Excellent acting, great plots and gorgeous Swedish countryside. Enjoyed the Branagh series for Masterpiece but Henrickson will always be my choice for Wallander.",1360022400,,197,5.827586206896552
4237492,5,B003ZZRC9O,This is a brilliantly written Wallander episode. Extremely psychological and suspenseful. The best of the first series of the Swedish version thus far.,1357603200,,151,5.608695652173913
4237493,1,B003ZZRC9O,"does anyone have a problem with the aspect ratio of Wallander ""Mastermind""?. Amazon displays it in stretched out 16:9 where it seems it should be 2.39:1",1356307200,,152,4.884615384615385
4237494,5,B003ZZRC9O,"The Swedish Wallander series is so good, and the episodes in season 1 all include Wallander's daughter, Linda. The Swedish series comes up with its own story lines but is ever faithful to the intent of the novels. My favorite thing about the Swedish series vs the British series is that Wallander is part of a real team of wonderful characters, and everyone is excellent!",1355875200,,371,4.723076923076923
4237495,5,B003ZZRC9O,"I continue to find this series fascinating.  The extra long episodes make each viewing more of a movie than a tv production.  I have long enjoyed quality police dramas and these are the best.  While I'm enjoying these season 1 episodes, I confess that I discovered the series by streaming season 2 first -- the quality of scripts and cinematography are stronger there -- but they are no spoilers for going back to the earlier origins of the story.",1355788800,2,447,4.632911392405063
4237496,4,B003ZZRC9O,"After being tired of the same type of plots, tricks and storylines, The Wallander series (especially the swedish version) brings some fresh air to police thrillers.  Director shows the human aspect of Wallander in a unique, profound and interesting viewpoint while at the same time shows the values, lifestyle and carachter of the sweedish people and its govermment.  Beautifully done. Unfortunately, only could get the first 2 seasons in Amazon....",1354320000,,449,5.4
4237497,3,B003ZZRC9O,"I don't normally review rentals, but I have been enjoying the Wallander series.  This is the least enjoyable episode.  The plot is comical.",1349827200,3,139,5.0
4237498,5,B003ZZRC9O,"The Swedish TV series -- both years-- has all the mood and depth of the Wallander novels. The fantastic cast brings the stories to life, all new, all Mankell",1347148800,,157,4.448275862068965
4237499,5,B003ZZRC9O,"I adore the MHz networks DVDs of international mysteries. This production by Swedish TV shows why it is very difficult to truly understand another culture. The BBC attempt to recreate this show was pathetic. Bramagh just doesn't cut it as Wallander. On the other hand,Krister Henriksson does a superb job of portraying the stoical yet passionate Wallander. He can go from deadpan to violent anger in seconds. As a daughter of a Swedish father, I recognize the personality type so evident in Swedish men. Horrifyingly inarticulate at times, trying to reach out to his only child, a daughter, after years of emotional neglect, I find the performance superb.",1335571200,8,655,5.074074074074074
4237500,5,B003ZZRC9O,"If you like Henning Mankell's Wallandar, these are the best video's available. The scenes of Sweden and the acting are very good. Kurt Wallandar comes alive as a real person rather than a shakespearean character as i done by Branagh. Ant the expansion of thr role of his daughter, Linda is well acted. Her tragic death, the actress playing her,  caused Henning Mankell to cease any more of the stories with Linda Wallandar.",1328832000,8,423,4.794520547945205

We've actually visited Ystad, Sweden, where this was filmed, and stayed in the police station building (which was a train station but is now converted to a B&B).",1477267200,,288,4.979166666666667
8411457,3,B003ZZRC9O,"The stories and writing in this are quite good. For more on that, please read the other reviews here.
My complaint with this particular DVD issue are the subtitles. The English subtitles are part of the picture and thus one cannot select whether they are on or off. This makes it very, very annoying if you don't want the subtitles; they are in quite large font and difficult to ignore. If you cover them up, you'll miss a lot of the visuals. I'm not sure which 'genius' decided to make these DVDs like this - it was either pure laziness to not author the DVDs with optional subtitles or simply an arrogant assumption to think that 'everyone' would want the subtitles mandatory (i.e. no, of course no Swedish-speaking people would ever want to see this, right?).
A great series, but this issue 'suger' (yeah, that's Swedish for 'sucks').",1463529600,,837,4.662162162162162
