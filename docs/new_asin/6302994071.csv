529492,4,6302994071,"one of the better Pauly Shore movie. I rewatched bio dome..and that makes this movie even better how bad that one was. I liked Pauly in this time frame. Maybe being East Coast and thinking this is what LA is all about in my youth? Watching this movie..it is entertaining in a odd way..But the worst part is the very end..whey they try to talk like Pauly Shore..it is a bad way to end the movie. and Tiffani Thiessen kept it PG..and that was sad for my youth..But she does have a nice smile to perk up a room..didn't show her enough in this movie. But she did drive a trans Am..and I always thought that was cool! The plot is the basic..out of element story. I don't get the chemistry of if the main stars had it..it seemed odd..she got mad at what he did..when the ""Friendship"" was based on stalking people at the beach? but it doesn't have to hold anything solid to the plot..but still you would want to see chem..if there is a fight about if they ""like"" or ""love each other.  I would have just enjoyed a movie..with out the love interest that didn't hold water..to Pauly being tricked to being a farmer for a school project. Still..In the Army Now,Encino Man, I think is slightly better.and bio dome is worse..this is a middle of the Pauly Shore movies..",1502323200,,1256,4.367521367521367

Nothing profound here, just a double fish-out-of-water plot with Pauly Shore being Pauly Shore before the shtick got old.  It's funny, for the most part.  Pretty good trick there with the rollerblading feedsack run.",1494633600,,324,5.1923076923076925

The plot was totally predictable.  Its essentially a dumbed-down version of the old Green Acres sitcom:  A totally-wired city boy visits his fiancs family in rural South Dakota and is like a fish out of water.  If we hadnt watched the movie with family members, who inexplicably thought it was great, we could have turned it off after the first five minutes.",1467676800,,532,4.921348314606742

530036,5,6302994071,"Son-in-Law is a long time favorite of mine.  The movie is quirky, funny, and I love how it unites two people from totally different worlds.  Rebecca is a midwestern girl raised on a farm.  She decides to attend college in California - a complete 180 degree difference from the environment she is used to living.  Crawl is the resident adviser in her dorm.  The pair form an unlikely bond and the next thing you know, both are on their way to Rebecca's home for Thanksgiving.  Hilarity ensues as Crawl familiarizes himself with a farm and how everything works.  I've seen this movie a hundred times and I still laugh like I'm watching is for the first time.  If you like stupid comedies then Son-in-Law is right up your alley.",1455580800,3,725,4.565891472868217

I bought this movie as a Christmas present for my dad, and after watching it, again, I was tempted to bring it back home with me. Pauly Shore has a way of making you laugh without even making a joke, he just has one of those voices, ya know? It seems like everything that he says is funny, to me. I got hooked on Pauly Shore movies because of my Poppa, who always watched his movies whenever they were on TV. This is definitely one of my favorite movies.",1454716800,,520,4.21

1. For the DVD quality itself, the widescreen format doesn't automatically fill the entire widescreen TV, it's a smaller box with a giant black border all around it.  I had to zoom in on my TV settings to get it to fit, which caused a fuzzier picture than normal.

2. The movie itself was a letdown, nowhere near as funny as I remember it from when I was a kid.  This is more of opinion though.  If you know you like this movie, I'd still avoid this dvd because of reason 1.",1442188800,,527,4.127450980392157

No matter how many times I have watched it in the past, I still crack  up at the ""Steven Tyler PJs""  and some of the other quotes that are strewn throughout the movie.  Basically, the storyline of the movie (for anyone who hasn't watched this wonderful movies) is that Crawl (Shore) spends the Thanksgiving Holiday with Becca Warner and her family on their small town farm.  While Crawl spends time adjusting to the farm life, he also  teaches Becca's family how to be open with their communication and acceptance of others that may not always be ""normal"".

530744,4,6302994071,"Wow it's been a while since I have seen a Pauly Shore movie.  I forgot about ""Crawl"" and all of his college antics.  Pauly Shore is still pretty funny if you like his style of somewhat juvenile humor and/or have a sense of nostalgia for the 90's (like I do).

Midwest America farm town antics meet California style and how ""weird"" the West Coast was.  Some pretty funny parts, corny/dumb parts, but a fun watch in my book.",1399075200,,422,4.371794871794871

530847,2,6302994071,"This was a purchase for my wife who would rate it about a 4.5.  I liked some of the comedy, but even for the period, it was cliched.

531101,3,6302994071,"The differences between rural and urban lifestyles has been made the source of humor many times before.  Perhaps the peak was in the 1960's, when Paul Henning's' rural based TV programs The Beverly Hillbillies (1962-1971), Petticoat Junction (1963-1970), and Green Acres (1965-1971), drew big numbers.  The comedy Son-In-Law (1993) works both sides of the culture clash street, with Carla Gugino playing a farm girl new to college life, and Pauly Shore starring as a spacey slacker, discovering the thrills and excitement of life on the farm.

Leaving her boyfriend and life on a South Dakota farm behind, Rebecca Warner (Gugino) arrives at a college in California and is immediately immersed in a whole new world.  Confused and upset, Rebecca is about to quit school and go back home, when Crawl the dorm's resident advisor, takes her under his wing, and helps her to adjust.  Rebecca cuts and colors her hair, gets a new wardrobe and her first tattoo, and enjoys time hanging at the beach.

Rebecca invites Crawl to come home with her for Thanksgiving, and that's where the fun really begins.  The Warner's are slightly in shock, at their daughter's transformation, but her parents Walter (Lane Smith), Connie (Cindy Pickett), and Grandfather (Mason Adams), try to take it in stride.  Crawl's presence is unexpected, but being polite, they invite him to stay for holidays, bunking with Rebecca's obnoxious brother Zack (Patrick Renna).

When Rebecca's boyfriend Travis (Dan Gauthier) unexpectedly pops the question in the middle of a public gathering at the local country club, Crawl comes to her rescue, saying that he already proposed, and that he and Becca are engaged.  With an unexpected future son-in-law on their hands, the Wagner's begin the process of teaching him about life on the farm.  With farm hand Theo (Dennis Burkley) as his main instructor, hilarity soon ensues, as Crawl and chores don't exactly mix.

Travis turns out to be a real scumbag, as with Theo's help, he executes a scheme to put Crawl in a compromising position with Tracy (Tiffani Amber Thiessen, Saved By The Bell), another girl that Travis is involved with.  This bit of dirty low down behavior is the only thing that spoils the lighthearted tone of the film, but fortunately the situation is quickly resolved.

With a goofy, good-hearted innocence, Pauly Shore puts his stamp on this type of humor, which seems to work more than it flops.  Shore mostly resists going overboard, and trying too hard to be funny.  Even if you don't like him initially, Crawl gradually wins you over with his charming brand of deadhead humor.  The dude is really more perceptive than some might give him credit for.  While the range of Shore's acting talent may not be great, in this instance it does work fairly well.  One of the warmest moments is when Crawl gives Connie a beauty makeover, which turns her husband Walter into a frisky colt.

Carla Gugino kind of looks like a young Blair Brown, and has some of Brown's flighty charm.  Watching her in this, it's a little hard to picture her in tougher roles (Karen Cisco, Threshold), or as the voluptuous Lucille in Sin City (2005).  Dan Gauthier was thirty when this was made, but is able to pass for someone much younger.  Veteran actors Lane Smith, Cindy Pickett, and Mason Adams, add charm and wholesomeness to the film.

Son-In-Law isn't great, but it provides a few laughs without resorting to tired clichs and trying too hard to be funny.  The movie is available in either full screen or widescreen, but the image quality is not the greatest, with a lack of sharpness in places.

531134,3,6302994071,"I'm not sure I'd describe this movie as excellent, or one of the best comedies. I'll leave that to the classcs that have earned that, particularly through the test of time. However, the word ""classic"" is loosely interpreted these days (See ""TCM"" or ""AMC"")- comedy moreso. And ""The Son-In-Law"" has a comfort food feel about it, in spite of the presence of the obtrusive talents of Pauly Shore, of whom I don't consider myself a fan of, but indeed a fan of a few movies of his. This is my favorite. Direction of this movie does a good job of making you feel the different perspectives of its characters, especially for a movie that really isn't meant to be taken that seriously. I don't think it's any coincidence that this movie finds lots of TV time around the holidays, because it does have a warm, fuzzy, familar feel to it, especially for a ""fish out of water"" comedy. Shore plays that fish well. I had actually hoped for better future scripts to utilize Shore after this. But his run was  very short lived. The supporting cast around him and a well cast Carla Gugino, the simple country girl whom Shore transforms from caterpillar to butterfly, too is nicely cast, including one of my favorite supporting/character actors Lane Smith, who in my opinion has a tendency to steal scenes in the movies he's part of. Long time fave Tiffani-Amber Theisan, and one time fave Patrick Renna, who put out his 2 best efforts of his career (including ""The Sandlot"") the year this movie was released), along with a few other famiilar faces combine for an effective cast that takes a simple plot and script and creates a fun movie that depends on archetypes to achieve it's end. What else would you expect from a Shore movie? Did anyone really expect Academy material from Shore after ""Encino Man""? This is one of those movies that I find myself watching whenever it's on.

When the holidays roll around, Crawl has nowhere to go and decides that frozen turkey dinners are just fine for Thanksgiving, but Becca insists he join her and her family in South Dakota. Crawl is the opposite of anything her family has ever seen and as if that's not enough to make things silly, Becca's boyfriend tries to propose to her, but Becca doesn't want to get married yet and Crawl announces to the family that he's already proposed to Becca.

531239,5,6302994071,"I'm not saying that Pauly Shore is a great actor, but Son in Law is one of the funniest movies I have ever seen.  Shore plays a Shore-like resident assistant named Crawl at the California university chosen for matriculation by Rebecca of some farm (probably not Sunnybrook) in South Dakota.  Her jock boyfriend Travis, who apparently spends all of his free time trying to look more and more like Tom Cruise, doesn't want her to go, afraid she will change out there on her own.  Becca, as Crawl calls her, has a hard time adjusting to college life and is ready to quit and come home when Crawl convinces her to stay and try a little harder to fit in with the crowd.  Soon, shy little Rebecca has been shorn of her long hair, clothed in ""weasel ware,"" and tattooed, allowing her to mingle easily on the beach and at mud wrestling bars.  When she learns that Crawl is going to be alone during Thanksgiving, she invites him home with her.  Her parents and Travis are shocked when they see Becca's new undeniably hot look, but they are even more shocked when a lunatic in the form of Crawl shows up with her.  He takes to country life in his uniquely Shore-ian way, horrifying just about everyone in the state of South Dakota.  This is before Crawl announces that he and Becca are getting married, a lie engineered on the spot to forestall Travis' own marriage proposal to the new and improved Becca.  Dad decides to show Crawl what farming is like, trying to drive him away with the nastiest farm chores known to man, at which point much hilarity ensues.  In time, Crawl begins to win over Becca's family and even becomes a star attraction on the local square dance circuit, inspired by such songs as the theme to Green Acres and John Denver's Thank God I'm a Country Boy.  Travis has his own plans for getting Becca back, though; feathers fly, and not just those from the turkey that gets loose in the house.
Pauly Shore is in full Pauly Shore mode in this movie, but it works tremendously well here.  The acting is great all the way around, Carla Gugino is adorable, Shore is hilarious, and there's not a dull moment to be found from beginning to end.  I've watched this movie several times, with no noticeable decrease in the enjoyment factor from one viewing to the next.  My parents, who haven't been to a movie since I was a kid dragging them along with me, actually borrowed this movie from me; some of their friends had been trying to find this hilarious movie they had seen but could not remember the name of for some time, and I recognized the plot as soon as they got around to asking me about it.  It's a pretty unforgettable movie that appeals to a wide audience.  If you have avoided Son in Law like the plague just because Pauly Shore stars in it, I urge you to reconsider and give this movie a chance.

First and foremost I watch this film because I hope that by doing so I can in some ways become a better person. I look for different points of view, ethical rocks that have yet to be unturned in my every day thinking; in short, I watch this film to widen my compass of moral concern. This is a somewhat didactic view of this work of art, and I understand that there are many other reasons to turn to Son in Law. Perhaps great art, as Kant has remarked, ""reveals purposiveness without purpose"". I do not wish to strip Shore's ingenious film of this function.

My kids wanted to watch this on Thanksgiving, and now that we've finished, I realized that it really is a fairly decent film.  Besides its somewhat predictable plot, the story is quite funny.  Pauly Shore plays a California college student, nicknamed Crawl, who goes home over Thanksgiving with his friend, played by Carla Gugino, to her parents' farm in ""middle America,"" as he puts it.  Crawl pretends to be his friend's fiance so she doesn't have to face her high school sweetheart, and proceeds to help out at the farm.  Throw the California city boy into farm life, and you can only imagine what type of trouble he gets into.
Shore seems to be at his best in the role, and Gugino adds a lot of flavor to the film as well.

7833273,3,6302994071,This is the only Pauly Shore movie I ever liked.  He got this one right.  Carla Gugino is a farm girl going off to California for college.  He plays the advisor who is all California.  She is completely out of her element.. He gets her a make over and the next thing you know she is totally Californian.  Tattoo and all.  When she comes home at Thanksgiving he comes with her.  Then he doesn't blend in with the farm or family.  He pretends to be her boy friend because now she is having doubts about getting married.  And it goes from there.  This is a very funny movie.,1520208000,,571,4.203703703703703
