7020233,3,B00TQGGDXC,"I was excited to see that this film was finally released.  It has not been seen in any form since its initial release in 1956.  Although I am a major Abbott and Costello fan, I was disappointed with this film.  It has a lackluster script and I can see why it was their last film together.  And Lou only made two more appearances before his death in March 1959.  "" Wagon Train "" -  "" The Tobias Jones Story "" -  ( 1958 ) and  "" The Thirty Foot Bride of Candy Rock "" ( 1959 ) with Dorothy Provine and was released two months after his death untimely death .  With that said I love this film because it is their last film and based on that alone, this is a classic to be revered with the rest of their work.",1431129600,3,704,3.9014084507042255
7020234,4,B00TQGGDXC,"This is a review of the new Olive Films DVD release of ""Dance With Me Henry."" It focuses on the regular DVD version and not the blu-ray version. I give Olive Films an ""E"" for effort for bringing back this long out-of-print A&C film.

The Olive Films version is fine in the sound department, however, the picture appears to be slightly grainy on my new Panasonic HD television. There are no scratches or dirt specks in the print, but the picture is somewhat dark in a few parts of the movie. Overall, the print is very watchable and not a bad buy for this type of DVD.

If you want to complete your collection of A&C's movies, or if you like to observe the aging process of comedy teams, then ""Dance With Me Henry"" will suit your needs.

When Abbott and Costello completed ""A&C Meet the Mummy"" in 1955, Universal canceled their contract. After being off the big screen for about a year, independent filmmaker Bob Goldstein approached the team about making a low-budget comedy/drama that would be released through United Artists.  The team jumped at the offer and hoped that ""Dance With Me Henry"" would be their comeback movie.

The film proved to be a box office flop, and ""Dance With Me Henry,"" released in December 1956, became the last Abbott and Costello film.  After an attempt to keep the act together with live engagements, Abbott and Costello officially broke up during the summer of 1957.

There's little to compliment in ""Dance With Me Henry.""  Both Abbott and Costello appear listless and tired throughout the film.  The old magic created by Abbott and Costello in many of their past films is not evident here.  In the scenes in which the two are together, both make little effort to even look at each other. The dialogue from the script is delivered by Abbott and Costello without much emotion and mostly in a matter-of-fact manner.

In many of his scenes, Costello seems to have his mind on something else. Even in the scene where he is arrested by the police, he looks somewhat distracted. Abbott tries to add a bit of the old A&C spark in a few scenes, but Costello's downtrodden demeanor often puts a damper on the proceedings.

Veteran comedy director Charles Barton could not squeeze much humor out of this 80 minute film. The thin plot centers around Abbott and Costello owning and operating Kiddyland, a small amusement park with carnival rides.

Abbott has raked up gambling debts and the mob has threatened to get rid of him, rob Kiddyland, or both. Eventually, Costello is framed by the mob for the murder of the city's District Attorney who is looking into the mob's activities.

One of the few bright spots in ""Dance With Me Henry"" is a cute, perky nine-year-old named Sherry Alberoni.  A former Mouseketeer, she was known by her stage name of Sherry Allen when she worked for Walt Disney.

In ""Dance With Me Henry,"" Sherry likes to hang out at Kiddyland after closing and play detective. One night while hiding in one of the miniature train cars at the amusement park, Sherry witnesses some strange activities which she reports to the police. With her help, the police solve the murder and Costello is cleared of all charges.

Following ""Dance With Me Henry,"" and the break up of the team, Lou Costello did have his moments as a serious actor, especially in one memorable 1958 episode of ""Wagon Train"" entitled ""The Tobias Jones Story.""  And Bud Abbott, years after the death of Costello, did a great job providing the voice of himself in the popular Abbott and Costello animated series of the 1960's.",1428192000,9,3526,4.687196110210697

7020236,5,B00TQGGDXC,"I love MY copy of this [1956] 36th ---long-out-of-print--- final, Abbott & Costello' TEAM film.
<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-30-Foot-Bride-of-Candy-Rock-1959/dp/B004CZZZGI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The 30 Foot Bride of Candy Rock{1959}</a>&nbsp;(ALSO available in its, original, wide-screen) is the film (without Bud) that, literally, killed, the
beloved, Lou Costello.

A trivia note to those that think Lou was ""ungrateful"" in dumping Bud: The pay contract, initiated BY Lou, knew that a great comedian
NEEDS a great straight-man to succeed; the pay-split was, thus, 60% for Bud[1895-1974] and, 40% for Lou [1906-1959]!
In the movie years, 50/50... then, before the split-up, favouring Lou, 60/40. Rest In Peace, gentlemen!

HIGHLY recommended ""Family-friendly"" movie. Not THEIR best, and, certainly THEIR last; finally in its ORIGINAL widescreen aspect ratio!
Oh! I watched this on my 55"" widescreen TV. It is, AS projected, originally, back in '56. The 2005 DVD version I compared it with has a
wee-bit more of the picture on it, top and bottom. I'll get to THAT in a moment. The picture is sharper. I clearly saw the word ""DIXIE"" at
the bottom of a paper cup in one scene. The sound was excellent! The music was a LOT better!
___________________________________________________________________________________________________________
The picture fills a widescreen television VERY nicely.
Getting back to my formatting statement. Early in the this movie, where Rusty Hamer, Lou Costello, and the Priest are talking in his rec-
tory office, the differences between aspect ratios are as follows:

"" Full Screen "" = You can see the top of the door frame. You can see the edge-lip of the priest's desk. Black bars right and left.
WIDESCREEN = Cannot see the top of the door frame. The desktop has no edge. The TV screen is filled without any black bars.

On MY television it is missing about an inch-and-a-half, top and bottom, of the screen. I'll accept the slight loss of video-info since
the evening sequence is SO clear that ""midnight at Kiddyland"" looks more like sunrise than sundown. The difference, literally, IS
night and day. NO important video information was lost. I gave my ten year-old DVD to a friend. T-h-i-s Blu-Ray is a real KEEPER!

But this film is not a Universal film but an M-G-M., and it was the last film the two made. It's lightweight, but appealing, and has some classic Abbott and Costello bits,  plus it features performances by three young actors who fans will remember from television shows.. It's not essential, unless you are an Abbott and Costello fan like me, but I think you'll enjoy it.",1434412800,5,505,4.738636363636363
