356064,4,6301797949,"Heidi is an excellent film, of course starring Shirley Temple as the witty Heidi, about a young orphaned girl who is sent away by her mean aunt to live with her strict and stern, but loveable, grandfather in the Alps.  The film consists of many hilarious moments, like when Heidi is learning to milk a goat and when she tries to yodel in the village.  My favorite scene is when Heidi asks her Grandfather to tell her a story.  He reads her a story about a little Dutch girl with a pair of wooden shoes.  The story comes alive and Shirley plays the little Dutch girl.  The movie is excellent for young children and for people who loved the novel, to me, the picture is much better.  The scenery is spectacular for being a 1937 film and the costume designs bring you into the time of Heidi.  No Shirley Temple collection is complete without Heidi!",980121600,18,845,4.412903225806452
356065,5,6301797949,"Heidi is an orphan who gets sent to live with her grandfather-an old mean man. Grandfather gets to know Heidi and becomes nicer. When Heidi is stolen by her aunt,Grandfather wants her back.",975456000,,189,4.757575757575758
356066,1,6301797949,"As one who finds Johanna Spyri's ""Heidi"" to be one of the best children's books, I find this transition to melodrama dreadful, and totally untrue to the book's text. The independent Heidi, whose warmth and faith are such that she is fearless and completely kind, is reduced to a picture book moppet. Worse yet, characters such as Dete and Fraulein Rottenmeir, who, in the book, are respectively rather self-centred and puzzled at the lower class child, are depicted as totally wicked - ready to sell Heidi to the gypsies! Clara, who in the original is disabled more because of her elders' fear and over-protectiveness than because of her unnamed illness, now is the target of a wicked governess who has a financial interest in keeping her ill and weak.
This dreadful film is suited only to those who are die hard fans of Shirley Temple.",972345600,22,836,4.772413793103448
356067,5,6301797949,"Shirley Temple movies have never lost their charm.  My niece loves them and this is her favorite one.  We have a habit of commenting on the  characters, discussing the plot, and comparing notes on the Shirley Temple  movies.  I have to laugh each time I take a movie over to her house.  She  says:  ""Will you be reviewing this one?""  Well, this movie was so  enchanting, I completely forgot to take notes!

This is the 1937 version,  renewed in 1965 and is a colorized version of the original black-and-white  classic.  It is actually the best-known version of the classic story of  Heidi.

In this movie, Heidi doesn't let anyone deter her from enjoying  life.  Even her reclusive grandfather turns to butter when Heidi steals her  way into his heart.  Heidi is a little orphan girl who is left to live in  the Swiss Alps.  Her cruel aunt not only leaves her with her grandfather,  she also returns and kidnaps her to make some money.  Poor Heidi is taken  to live in Frankfurt with a family she has never met before.  Soon she  makes friends with the invalid daughter who needs a companion.

Amidst all  this confusion, Heidi endures being bullied by an evil governess and still  manages to charm the butler and the rest of the household.  This is not a  sad movie, while it does have a few sad moments.  Shirley doesn't sing or  dance in this movie, yet her laughter will be heard throughout this  delightful movie...as will yours!

356068,4,6301797949,"Temple is wonderful in one of her best-remembered roles as the waif who goes to live with her broken-hearted grandfather (Jean Hersholt) Both bitchy Mady Christians and Mary Nash (as the mean governess) give memorable  performances as does the fragile Marcia Mae Jones as the crippled girl  Heidi befriends and helps to walk again. This was just what the public  wanted in 1937; 63 years later, children continue to be enchanted by this  film which is based on the book by Johanna Spyri. Available colorized.",947980800,14,508,4.9411764705882355
356069,5,6301797949,"Shirley Temple plays as Heidi and I love the grandfather.  She acts so wonderfully I cry every time I see it.  I love the ending, and I would recommend it to anyone.  She transforms her grandfather from a cold-hearted  man to a caring, loving grandfather figure.  This is a great family viedo,  and a special bonus to the fans of Shirley Temple.",946857600,3,345,4.483870967741935
356070,5,6301797949,"The classic European tale, done up vehicle for Shirley is an excellent choice for Temple, allowing for a couple of musical routines done as dream sequences. Heidi is an orphan who warms the heart of her bitter grandfather  (Jean Hersholt) who has not spoken since his son ran away with a girl.  Marcia Mae Jones is touching as the invalid whom Heidi befriends,and Mary  Nash is the nasty governess. Mady Christians plays Aunt DeDe, the cruel  aunt. Children will love this movie and it's available colorized.",944697600,5,508,4.872093023255814

356359,2,6301797949,"Shirley Temple is an excellent Heidi, just like I imagined while reading the book. However I gave the movie only 2 stars due to the dramatic and unnecessary changes to the original story. I hated the way the portrayed Frulein Rottenmeier and Dete turning them into pure villains, they also got rid of my favorite scenes from the book and added twists to the plot like attempts to kidnap Heidi. There are much better screen adaptations of ""Heidi"" than this one, but Shirley Temple is the best Heidi nevertheless.",1490572800,2,511,4.752808988764045

356772,5,6301797949,"Filmed in 1937, time has not diminished the ability of this film to charm the viewer. I first saw it as a child, then again with my own children. We all loved it. Seeing it again, I was not disappointed. I still love this movie!

Shirley Temple is perfection in the role of Heidi, the little eight year old orphan who is taken by her cruel aunt to live in the Alps with a grandfather she has never met. Her grandfather, who has a fearsome reputation with the local villagers, lives in isolation in a primitive hut in the mountains. When Heidi is unceremoniously left on his doorstep, he takes her in most reluctantly, as she is the daughter of his deceased son, Tobias, from whom he was estranged.

Heidi works her magic, and soon enough her grandfather finds himself a changed man, rejoining the community he had once rejected. Her scheming aunt, however, returns and surreptitiously steals Heidi away from the grandfather she loves and who has come to love her. Taking her to Frankfort, she leaves her with a wealthy family as companion to a seemingly disabled child. Once again, Heidi works her magic, but runs afoul of the scheming governess, who has plans of her own. Therein lies the tale.

The entire cast is wonderful, but it is Shirley Temple as Heidi who dominates. There has never been a child actor with the star quality exuded by Shirley Temple. With her golden curls, dimples, charismatic personality, and talent, she instantaneously charms the viewer. She can make one laugh or move one to tears in the blink of an eye. All this is evident in this wonderful family film, which is based on a well known children's book.",1462060800,4,1633,4.624137931034483

357918,5,6301797949,"First, this is a review of the movie, not the DVD.  Second, I have never red the book, so I can't compare it against the original story.
The film is about a girl who is handed over to her grandfather after her parents are dead.  He is a grumpy old man but Heidi soon bonds with him, softening his heart towards her and others.  But then she is taken away and sold to a rich family to keep their sick girl company.  I would call it an overused trope but this is a movie from the 30s and it likely started the trope to begin with.
The grandfather goes searching for Heidi, finds her, and kidnaps her to take her back home.  One horse chase later that makes you think of a bad action episode from ""Chips"" (a gun is USED) and all the loose ends are tied up.  Fun for the whole family.
I've been told that the film and the book are different in many ways but I don't think the lovers of the novel will complain too much about the movie.",1428883200,,931,4.032608695652174

358445,1,6301797949,This is one of the sweetest movies ever made.  Why is there a scary and violet FBI warning that lasts way too long before the movie starts.  This is really insane I've NEVER seen such a horrible and frightful FBI warning to not duplicate in any movie I've ever ordered let alone a child's DVD.  I would return it if it wasn't such a hassle.  I will never order DVD's from Amazon again. This is the second bad experience.,1419724800,2,420,4.2784810126582276
358446,3,6301797949,"This movie was very good, however it was not even closely based upon the book.  I felt like I was watching a completely different movie.  In the book Heidi never gets ""sold"" by her aunt, and the uncle being arrested and having to break out of jail to rescue Heidi made this movie way off base.  If you just want to enjoy a Shirley Temple movie and have never read the book, you would enjoy this movie.  However, if you are familiar with the book, you may wish to watch a different movie.",1419724800,,487,4.204301075268817

358450,4,6301797949,A perfect book for a family tradition...,1419292800,,40,4.857142857142857
358511,4,6301797949,"You would have to be a slab of stone not to be moved by this charming little film. Shirley Temple is magically able to convey a completely authentic, honest, emotional performance as ""Heidi"" -- the little orphan girl who is unwanted by almost everybody, and yet, manages to work her way into their hearts... except, for the above mentioned slabs of stone, of which there are two in the movie: Heidi's evil Aunt Dete, and Fraulein Rottenmeier, the villainous housekeeper for Herr Sesemann, and self-appointed guardian for Klara, Herr Sesemann's ""invalid"" daughter. Neither of these two unfortunate women are able to experience human emotion, nor do they apparently understand the value of human life.

But fortunately, Heidi does, and from the moment Shirley Temple hits the screen, which is just about from the first instant the movie starts, until it ends on her beatific smile, Shirley, as ""Heidi,"" carries this entire film on her delicate young shoulders and never misses a beat.

There are some curmudgeonly critics out there who get up in arms because the film doesn't match the book page-by-page. I say, ""So what?"" For anyone who has ever produced a film from an existing source, harsh creative decisions must be made. Unless we are going to turn a book into a multi-year series, where every moment the author intended is captured lovingly for hardcore fans, a film must select highlights from the book, and must also take liberties (sometimes huge ones) based on what the producers/directors/screenwriters feel best suit a story that will work well on screen. So for all the amazing number of haters of this film who are PO'd that it doesn't accurately portray every beloved moment, I say: Go and make your own film and you will quickly discover that it would be nigh on impossible to achieve the level of perfection you seem to think should be inherent in every film production of every major hit book.

Now that I got that off my chest: This film is simple, straight-ahead and sentimental. And I liked it for those reasons. I didn't have to sit for hours and try to figure out the ""double meanings"" or ""hidden layers"" or ""coded messages."" I put it on, watched it, got sucked into it, fell in love with Shirley's incredible sweet, light, joyful personage all over again, cried my eyes out at how she was mistreated and beamed with happiness when everything finally all works out.

What is shocking, though, about this film, is that there is a fair amount of blatant child abuse, starting with the goat-butting of Shirley into the ground, fairly early on. Apparently she did the scene, but her mother got worried and they finally used a double. It would never happen now. What if she had gotten hurt or injured? It was actually insane that they let that happen and filmed it. That bothered me, knowing that she could have been hurt. But people just weren't thinking that way back then. Also, Shirley is yanked, dragged, pulled away, shaken and more in this film and, now that I am an adult, and knowing that I was treated the same way as a child, I am astonished to think that this is what people do to children. So, I found this disturbing, but I found it realistic, because I personally experienced such abuse for my entire childhood.

I found the relationship between Heidi and the ""invalid"" girl Klara to be totally believable. I find it interesting to know that Shirley's mother was fearful that Marcia Mae Jones (as Klara) was going to outshine Shirley, and I'll admit, she was an incandescent presence on the screen, but I'm sorry, nothing could outshine or take the attention away from Shirley. As one of my young producer friends said yesterday (glad to know that Shirley is still a topic of conversation by people who know anything about film and real stars) that Shirley ""owned"" the screen. Indeed she did.

So, yes, it's in black and white. Yes, it's simple. Yes, it's old. But I would say if you are not touched by this film, it's because you yourself are out of touch with human emotions. I imagine that this generation's young people (who live on their phones/computers and watch sleek TV series on Hulu or Netflix and who are constantly bombarded by sex and violence to the point that their senses are dulled) probably won't appreciate it, but, I'm thrilled that I was able to watch it on Amazon Prime and relive some precious moment of my childhood. I would normally not say this under any other circumstances, but thank God for Shirley Temple. If I ever feel sad or blue or down, I'll watch one of her films and cheer right up.",1419292800,4,4552,4.705144291091593

Since Heidi's parents are both deceased the aunt decides to take Heidi to her grandfather in the Swiss Mountains.

359502,5,6301797949,"Please note: this is a review of the black and white VHS edition of Heidi.

Heidi is a most entertaining film starring the wonderful Shirley Temple although I want to add that child stars Marcia Mae Jones and Delmar Watson do an excellent job of acting as well. Indeed, the whole film is brilliantly done and memorable; its even a great way to remember Shirley Temple who passed away so recently. The plot moves along at a very good pace; I was never bored nor was I confused by any action going too fast. The sets reflect great forethought and a true desire for realistic detail and the use of lighting enhances the film as well. I especially liked the fine choreography and cinematography.

When the story begins, we quickly meet young Heidi (Shirley Temple), an orphaned girl who is travelling to the small German village of Drfli with her not too pleasant Aunt Dete (Mady Christians). Dete has gotten a job in Frankfurt and can no longer care for Heidiand to prove that she doesnt even care about the childs welfare Dete leaves Heidi with her grumpy and reclusive, somewhat antisocial grandfather Adolph Kramer (Jean Hersholt) who has a very bad reputation in the village. However, Adolph gradually comes to be fond of the plucky little girl whose optimism charms him and he begins to teach her things in his own way instead of giving in to Pastor Schultz (Thomas Beck) and sending Heidi to a public school. Its sweet to see Heidi and her grandfather bondand watch for the scene in which little Heidi gets squirted when she tries to milk a goatthat was not staged and Shirley Temples reaction is quite real!

Unfortunately, though, Heidis Aunt Dete eventually reappears and takes Heidi away to Frankfurt where Heidi is to be the companion to a little girl named Klara Sesemann (Marcia Mae Jones) who has fallen the previous summer and is confined to a wheelchairKlara may never walk again. Heidi just cant get adjusted to this new life; she misses her grandfather so! Klara wants to help Heidi return to her grandfather but Klara also wants a companion desperately especially since her very cruel governess Fraulein Rottenmeier (Mary Nash) is no fun to be with at all.

Of course from here the plot can go just about anywhere and were left guessing how things will ultimately turn out for Heidi and the others although I must confess I had an idea of what would eventually happen to Heidi. Nevertheless, no plot spoilers herewatch the film and find out the rest of the plot!

Look also for solid performances by Arthur Treacher as Andrews, Sidney Blackmer as Klaras father Herr Sesemann; Helen Westley as Blind Anna; Delmar Watson as Peter; Pauline Moore as Elsa; George Humbert as an organ grinder and if you look closely youll see Sig Ruman as a police captain in Frankfurt!

Overall, Heidi is a wonderful film for fans of Shirley Temple and the other actors in this film. In addition, people who enjoy dramas with family themes and who want their films on VHS tape will not be disappointed.",1395187200,,2997,4.699047619047619

359649,5,6301797949,"A tribute to the biggest little star to ever grace Hollywood. Shirley Temple Died today at  85 years old. Even in my 1960's boyhood, filled with toy guns, dangerous explosives masquerading as ""fireworks"" and monsters,  I always found Shirley Temple to be captivating and entertaining. Such a positive person, especially considering she played an orphan, or losing one parent and other hardships most of her acting career. Her movie version of Heidi is the definitive version of the story.

There are only a hand full of her films that have stuck in my mind all my life. I will always remember this one and a few others. Curly Top, Bright Eyes and The Little Colonel were a few other that come to mind. They all showed the little mop top at her cutest, very young but so skilled at her craft, she was truly a gifted actress.

This is a family classic that should be added to your Christmas movie collection. It's funny how this film seem to have been forgotten as a holiday film, but I think it stands tall next to other classic holiday fare, It's a Wonderful Life, Miracle On 34th Street, A Christmas Carol to name a few.

The film is full of great characters and charm, it is a pleasure to watch year after year. Shirley is at her best in this beautifully crafted film about love, devotion and the Christmas spirit.

R.I.P. Ms. Temple (Black)
You made a difference!

The DVD has both Black and White and Colorized versions included. I am not a fan of colorizing anything, but since they kept the original intact, I did enjoy watching both, so if you're looking to purchase this film, this is the definitive version and edition (pink cover) of this movie(at this time),

I have read some reviews and I would like to clear some things up. First off, this is the full feature and nothing was cut, second the print transfer is very good. Maybe there is a better print, but I have not seen it.

Note: I had reviewed this film late last year, but deleted and revised it. Not sure why the date is still showing 2013?",1387929600,,2010,4.484931506849315

My daughter had recently read the book ""Heidi"" and was disappointed in how the movie differed from the original storyline.  She has learned that the book is generally better than the movie, but in this case, the Hollywood version was so drastically different that she was not at all happy.  Specifically, there was a frightening kidnapping scene that was not in the book, and while it made for a dramatic conclusion for the movie, it was not enjoyable to watch.  Also - the movie concluded very abruptly, which was also dissatisfying (not that I wanted the move to be longer, but the storyline was rather confusing).  I would have to say that unless you are a huge Shirley Temple fan you will not enjoy this.  NOT for young children, as the kidnapping scene is quite frightening.",1379376000,4,943,4.719512195121951

Yes, this is the one starring Shirley Temple. The DVD has it in the original black and white or a colorized version that is really very pretty. It does not stick all that close to the original book, but the Shirley Temple movies never did. They were designed to showcase Shirley, and this one does a good job of that. She really was a remarkable child.

There is only one other actor you may recognize. Arthur Treacher, doing what he did best: the butler. A really very kind, amusing butler who makes a great foil for Heidi.

The story is thin, particularly compared to the book, and the chase scene is quite artificial. Many things are not only different from the book, but unexplained. The witchy old housekeeper breaks Clara's doll and also Heidi's snow globe. No mention is ever made of the broken doll in all the subsequent scenes, even though it was a very large and obviously expensive one. And one does get a little tired of Heidi and Clara giggling together for little or no reason.

360335,4,6301797949,"Well, if you want to watch a Shirley Temple movie, you can expect two things to happen: One, they (the movie makers) will make you fall in love with this adorable little girl, and two, they will then wrench your heart by putting her into serious trouble.

""Heidi"" is the story of a little orphan girl ... seven years old ... who is deposited (by her mean-spirited aunt) at the home of her paternal grandfather.  The grandfather is a gruff old man who has lived apart from society for some years, and ... not really having a choice ... he takes Heidi in with no more to-do than one would show when taking in a stray cat.

Heidi's innocence and goodness of heart soon win the crusty old man over, however, and his hardened heart is softened.  The two of them then simply live their lives together at the old man's cabin in the Swiss Alps ... and it is an idyllic and happy time for the both of them.

Unfortunately, the mean old aunt returns to the scene and snatches Heidi away (when the grandfather is not at home) to sell her into servitude.  Heidi then becomes a resident of Frankfort (against her will) in a wealthy family's home.  She tries to make the best of it, but longs to return to her grandfather and the happiness of their mountain home.  The grandfather, upon learning of Heidi's disappearance ... and her presumed where-abouts ... decides to set off ... on foot ... for Frankfort ... a city 100 miles away.  Eventually he gets there, and after some contrived drama, he and Heidi are re-united.

Made in 1937, ""Heidi"" is still an entertaining movie.  Shirley Temple stars as Heidi, and she is as charming and adorable as ever.  Jean Hersholt plays the grandfather, and he is excellent at conveying ... in an understated way ... the growing affection he has for the little girl.  But the strength of this movie is in the story ... part of it anyway ... where an old man, embittered by the rejection of his village and the (apparent) rejection of his god, alienates himself from them both.  Then an innocent little girl comes into his life, and her love ... and the love she engenders in him ... cause the old man to seek a reconciliation.  That is the heart of ""Heidi,"" and the universal appeal of this part of the story is what has drawn people to ""Heidi"" these many years.

AS A SIDE NOTE:

It is generally agreed that the Heidi character is Shirley Temple's most memorable role ... and it was indeed an excellent fit for the young actress ... but consider this: Shirley Temple was MGM's first choice to play Dorothy in ""The Wizard of Oz.""  What a great fit that would have been!  If you've ever read the book, you know that the character Dorothy has Shirley Temple written all over it.  But alas.  Due to studio rivalry, it was not to be.",1254096000,,2753,4.4226190476190474
360336,5,6301797949,"""Heidi"" is one of my favorite childhood movies and I watched it with my 4.5-year-old daughter today [in the original B&W]. To my utter delight, she loved it, and sat through the entire movie without so much as a squirm. I attribute this to Shirley Temple's precocious and adorable performance as the spirited and gentle-hearted orphan Heidi, who is taken by her Aunt Dete [Mady Christians] to the mountains, where she is unceremoniously dumped on her curmudgeon of a grandfather [Jean Hersholt]. Though both are initially wary of each other, a mutual and true affection slowly develops until Heidi is whisked away by Dete to the home of a rich man, where Heidi is to be the rich man's daughter's companion. Klara [Marcia Mae Jones], the rich girl, is wheelchair-bound and is delighted by Heidi's down-to-earth nature and funny antics, but Heidi pines for the mountains and especially for her beloved grandfather. The baddie role is played by Mary Nash as the mean-spirited Faulein Rottenmeir who truly does some mean things to Heidi in this adaptation.

But, this is a great family movie with wholesome values and wonderful acting. Even in B&W, the charms of this story are many and I'm so glad to be able to share this wonderful classic with my little girl.",1244937600,,1258,4.851162790697674

360338,4,6301797949,"Some people have said this is Shirley Temple's best film. It's not my favorite but I admit it is very good....and it has some of the most touching, wonderful moments of any of her films.

The mean old lady, ""Fraulein Rottenmeier,"" played by Mary Nash, has too big a role in the second half of the movie making for a number of unpleasant scenes. I had gotten so involved with the story that I couldn't stand to see this mean woman so nasty to ""Heidi"" (Temple). Also, there was only one song-and-dance number and that's not enough for a Shirley Temple movie, in which we come to expect songs-and-dances.

The other characters were fine. Arthur Treacher provides good humor; Jean Hersholt is great as the gruff-then-loving grandfather and Marcia Mae Jones is nice as the young invalid.

This is a true classic story and ends with perhaps the most gorgeous and sweetest smile I've ever seen on Shirley's face.",1235088000,,905,4.679245283018868
360339,4,6301797949,"Shirley Temple is perfectly cast as Johanna Spyri's perky Swiss Miss. She receives excellent support from Jean Hersholt as Grandfather, Marcia Mae Jones as Clara, and Mary Nash as the aptly named Miss Rottenmeier. Arthur Treacher is also featured as the Butler Andrews. Treacher played the Butler, or some similar role, in several films with Shirley Temple.
  There is a lot of drama and action packed into the film's 88 minutes. One may wonder if Heidi/Shirley suffers a bit too much. First, her Aunt Dete dumps her on  her dour, reclusive Grandfather's doorstep. Then, just as she manages to melt her crusty Grandfather's heart and bond with him, Aunt Dete returns again and kidnaps Heidi(!)
off to Frankfurt, where she is to be a companion to wheelchair-bound Clara. Leaving Heidi with witchy governess Miss Rottenmeier, Dete says, ""Sell her to the gypsies for all I care!""
  Heidi teaches Clara to walk again. This infuriates Miss Rottenmeier, who kidnaps Heidi again (!) and actually does try to sell her to the gypsies. Grandfather has been looking for Heidi, however. He is thrown into the Frankfurt jail on Christmas day, but manages to escape in the nick of time. Heidi and Grandfather are chased by the police across the mountains in the film's frantic climax. I don't know if this has anything to do with Spyri's book. Shirley Temple's fans aren't likely to care. This 1937 version is one of Temple's best films. The ""Heidi"" formula was repeated most successfully in 1939's ""The Little Princess."" Here, a particularly determined Shirley is again menaced by witchy Mary Nash. Marcia Mae Jones, in contrast to sweet Clara, plays snobby schoolmate Lavina.",1233446400,,1663,4.9891696750902526

360362,5,6301797949,"I never watched Shirley Temple growing up.  My sister did, but she was not my cup of tea (as is to be expected with any young boy really).  Now that I am older and I have a young daughter of my own I have found that I watch, and enjoy, quite a few films that I would have generally avoided.

`Heidi' is one of my favorites.

The film tells the familiar story (it's been told an upwards of ten times already) of young Heidi Kramer, an orphan who is left at her grandfathers doorstep by her selfish aunt.  Her grandfather is a bit of a grouch, but Heidi's warm demeanor soon melts his heart and he becomes as sweet and gentle as a teddy bear.  Just as the two are forming an unbreakable family bond, Heidi's wicked aunt comes back to whisk Heidi away in an attempt to sell her to a wealthy man in search of a companion for his crippled daughter Klara.  Despite the adamant dissatisfaction on the part of Klara's caretaker Fraulein Rottenmeier, Heidi is permitted to stay.  Heidi longs to go home to her grandfather but is not allowed to leave, especially after her cheerful attitude causes positive changes in Klara.  Adolph, Heidi's grandfather, begins a desperate search for her, but will they ever be reunited?

Well, we know the answer, but getting there is half the fun.

Shirley Temple is a sweetheart, a truly charming and sensational little actress and she paints each scene red with her gigantic personality.  There has not been a child star since that has been able to really excite all the sense like this little spitfire could.  Yes, those Olsen girls tried, but honesty; no.

Temple's mother, like all crazy child actor parents, was afraid that young Marcia Mae Jones would steal the limelight from her daughter, but what happened instead was an equalizing of talent here.  Both Temple and Jones shine brightly and work so well together.  Sure, Temple is the star and that is undeniable, but she is able to allow Jones to get in her dues as well, which is commendable.  Jean Hersholt is effective as Adolph, even if he is not used too much.  Arthur Treacher is delightful as the butler Andrews and Sidney Blackmer is sincere and just plain wonderful as Herr Sesemann, Klara's elated father.  Both Mary Nash and Mady Christians are brilliantly dastardly as the evil Rottenmeier and Aunt Dete.  In fact, the entire cast really works beautifully here.

In the end I have to say that `Heidi' is not just for little girls.  This is a wonderful film for families, for it is a charming movie that the whole family can enjoy; mother, father, daughter and son.  It's sweet, it's boisterous and it's a pure delight.",1222387200,,2616,4.5905172413793105

360431,4,6301797949,"I stayed with this movie mainly because I wanted to see Sidney Blackmer who I knew from the film Rosemary's Baby. Also I was interested in Arthur Treacher who I vaguely recall as the late Merv Griffin's Ed McMann-type sidekick on his tv talk show. And I knew the name Jean Hersholt(isn't a theater named after him in New York?) so I wanted to watch him.
As the film begins though I was very much drawn into the story itself featuring of course the delightful miss Temple. It seems Shirley (Heidi) is being foisted off upon her grandfather by her could-care-less aunt and while the grandfather (Hersholt) feels initially violated with this unexpected arrival, Heidi's sunshiney disposition wins him over after not too long. During these opening scenes, as Heidi and her grandfather get to know each other, we also get to see the blossoming of Hersholt's grandfather from a very quiet and downright annoyed old man into a thoughtful and loving caretaker of his new charge. Pretty soon, grandfather is humming along to the little song Heidi sings and taking her into the village to attend church, something he hasn't done in a very long time.
Ay, but then the other shoe drops. Wicked old auntie returns one day and while grandfather is out chopping wood forces Heidi to come with her to Frankfurt to stay with an equally mean lady in charge of an invalid girl about Heidi's age. I finally got to see Sidney as a much younger man(Heidi being filmed in 1937, Rosemary's Baby, 1968)as he plays the father of the invalid girl Heidi befriends. It's fun to spot the similarities in the face of someone who is 31 years younger. And Arthur Treacher playing a wonderfully fun-loving butler is a real treat. Suffice to say Heidi's grandfather rescues her from the clutches of the terribly mean nurse and Heidi helps her new friend to walk again. But the bottom line with this movie even though it goes without saying is the sparkling presence of miss Shirley Temple. Truely a one of a kind personality in all of moviedom. There is one scene in particular that I would love to see in color(this version I saw was in black & white)and that is where Heidi is being read a bedtime story by her grandfather and dreams she is the little dutch girl from the story. The dream is a nice musical/dance number with Heidi and friends in wooden shoes.",1186876800,,2326,4.634382566585956

360436,4,6301797949,"Shirley Temple's movie career was near its peak when she played the role of Heidi.  Heidi has been interpreted in many different ways over the years.  Some interpretations are excellent.  Other interpretations are poor.  This interpretation is relatively weak when compared with the original book, but Shirley Temple is cute and fans of Shirley Temple will forgive the deviations from the book.

Heidi's aunt takes Heidi to her grandfather after her aunt raised her for six years.  Heidi's grandfather is a bitter old man who is angry at the world for the loss of his son.  However, charming Heidi soon turns him into a loving grandfather who rejoins the world.  All seems well until Heidi's aunt returns and convinces Heidi to join her on a trip.

The trip turns out to be a kidnapping.  Heidi's aunt takes Heidi to be a companion to Klara Seseman, who is in a wheel chair after suffering an accident.  Klara quickly becomes fond of Heidi, to the chagrin of Fraulein Rottenmeier, who is unhappy with Heidi because she thinks Heidi might make it so that Klara no longer needs Rottenmeier.  Heidi and Klara get along well, though Heidi remains focused on returning home to her grandfather and the mountains.

After Fraulein Rottenmeier shows her true colors to Klara's father, he discharges her.  Fraulein Rottenmeier plans to kidnap Heidi and sell her to the gypsies.  Fortunately, Heidi's grandfather has arrived in town and is looking for Heidi.  Will Heidi's grandfather find her in time?  Will Heidi return to the mountains?  What will happen to Klara without Heidi?  You will have to watch the movie and see.

Shirley was about nine years old when this movie was made, but she appeared to be younger.  Shirley is the main attraction of the movie, and because she is so cute I found it easy to forgive the significant deviations from the book.  Most movies based on books take liberties with the story, but this movie takes more liberties than is typical and those distractions can be annoying.  The best example I can think of is the chase scene near the end of the movie.

This movie is about average when compared to other Shirley Temple movies.  Fans of Shirley Temple will enjoy this film.  Fans of the book ""Heidi"" may dislike this movie because it deviates from the story so much.  This version is colorized and the DVD quality could be improved, which could also make some viewers unhappy.  Even though this movie has its flaws, I found it interesting to watch and I will watch it again.

360438,5,6301797949,"Heidi (Shirley Temples) has spent the first few years of her life with her black-hearted and bossy aunt Dete, for her parents died when she was an infant. The story begins when Dete finds a job in Frankfurt, and dumps Heide off on Adolf Cramer's doorstep. Though he is her granfather, she has never known him, and it takes a while for the cranky old man to get used to her. But once Heide - with her charming ways - has won a place in his heart, she is there to stay. And wether she is exploring the mountains with Peter - the ""goat general"" - helping to milk the goats,  gather fire wood, or learning to read, she exhibits uniform cheerfulness, for the mountains, and her grandfather's hut, have become her home. Heidi's love for the Lord even bring her grandfather to ask forgiveness - and to forgive those who in the past he had been at emnity with. I love the part where they are at Church and the congregation sings ""Holy, Holy, Holy Lord"" together. It sent chills down my spine the first time I heard it. Just when things are getting too good to be true, the worst happens:the miserly, manipulative Aunt Dete comes to call, and snatches Heide away. Arriving in Frankfurt, Dete leaves Heide to be the companion of the rich and sickly Klara Sesemaan, whose governess happens to be none other than Frauline Rottenmiar, who becomes convinced that Heidi is bad news as she sees Klara getting well because of her. Meanwhile, Adolf Cramer has come in search of his little grandaughter, little knowing that Klara's father has determined to adopt her when he finds that Klara can walk again for the first time since her fall.

360439,3,6301797949,"When is anything ever faithful these days? I'm quite sure there's a couple of open mouths out there as to why I'm reviewing this. I loved the whole story of Heidi when I was young, and I've collected many different versions over the years. It was my favourite book when I was young, and I used to read it over and over.

I bought ages ago the TV series from 1978, and finally got round to watching it today. And it was really, really bad. I couldn't even sit through the first episode. After switching it off, my mum suggested watching Shirley Temple in Heidi. Since it's only 84 minutes in length, I gave it a go.

I sat through it, but I just don't understand the appeal of Shirley Temple, she looked like a precocious little brat. And she does everything. Sings, dances, talks in this whiny little voice.

What disappointed me was that the film was nothing like the book. It brought some things to life, but Peter did not feature enough, I always imagined Heidi as being dark haired, not a dirty blonde, there's not one, but TWO song & dance sequences in it. Which totally detract from the film. Some of the stuff about Klara was good, as I didn't remember what happened straight away, but the chase between the police & the grandfather was just stupid.

This was originally filmed in black & white, and the DVD version is ""colourised"" for some reason. So some of the colours can be quite dodgy, particularly the greens I noticed (and everyone's lips & tongue are the same colour as their skin!) Frankly, I don't understand why they did this, people are gonna watch it whether it's black & white, or colour.

There are a few funny moments in the film, Heidi desperately trying to yodel, people falling over, and her little sulky face when she tries to get back to her beloved grandfather.

There's a lot of sickly sweetness injected into the story at regular intervals, and it does get a bit too much. Great if you're a fan of Shirley Temple (like my mum), average if you're not (like me!)",1143331200,3,1992,4.458791208791209

360471,4,6301797949,"Finally,after about three years of suffering through a horrible-looking unrestored black & white/colorized version of Shirley Temple's 1937 version of ""Heidi"",Fox and co-partner Legend Films,an excellent company specializing in digital film restoration and digital film colorization,has now brought us for the very first time a brand-new,sparkling,and outstanding new restored b&w transfer of this great film which contains a brand-new color version,and it's the real deal ! Avoid seeing,renting,or owning the original DVD release ( mint green cover ) of this film that Fox has put out from 2002 which used a horrendously bad computer colorized version from 1986 that was also the same transfer later used for the 1994 video release that used a very grainy,dark,and murky print with extensive color shift from color-to-black & white-back to color and a great deal of reddish pink,gray,brown and blue tones. This new version made nearly 19 years later uses a brand new,digitally restored black & white version from a very good 35mm print that barely shows any wear,tear,splices,damages,or smear as well as including a very beautiful-looking new digitally made color version which looks very stunning,realistic,and almost storybook-like,especially the beautiful-looking shots of the Swiss Alps in the opening ! It really does look like it was filmed in Technicolor and is a much better comparision piece over the original color version. The only bonus features that are included,as it did with the original DVD release is an unrestored b&w theatrical trailer with a great deal of grain,dirt,and low contrast. Interestingly,the menu design used here in the new version is the exact same one as the original DVD version. All in all,I highly recommend this,one of Temple's last great Fox films,for any DVD collection and for any Shirley Temple fan and get rid of old colorized VHS and DVD release. This is the real deal here and you will not be dissappointed by the excellent restoration and coloring of this great family film !!",1131926400,125,2024,5.328125

Shirley Temple is a wonderful & talented young lady. This movie does her justice in every way. The black & white movie is  remastered & it looks really good. The color version is just as good. The way they made the mountains so vibrant & clear is really nice. It makes one feel like they are there. The whole movie is perfect. I have the VHS tape from when it first came out & the color isn't very good. My family will cherish it for a long time to come.",1126224000,35,605,3.959016393442623
360474,5,6301797949,"HEIDI has such beautiful color, it truly looks like it was truly filmed in color!!!! The colors are so vibrant, they jump right off the screen! Shirley has never looked this beautiful on film before, its as if this color has made her features come much more to life!!

The mountain scenes are beautiful, where when we see The grandfather or Shirley outside of the cabin, the trees and the sky are so beautiful. The tress are beautiful green, and the sky is beautiful deep blue!!

The clothes that Shirley wears are beautiful with the color and, wait till you see the christmas tree and all its colors!

One of the main reasons as to why HEIDI looks so good is because it was remastered and its truly flawless,its so clear and sharp!! Again, Shirley has never looked so good ,and her adorable beauty truly shines strong! The skin tone is done to perfection and, truly this great Shirley movie has never looked as good as this before!!",1125619200,18,933,4.541666666666667
360475,4,6301797949,"I have numberous complaints from various fans and friends about the quality of the DVD and I am in an uproar with FOX who really owe Shirley's fans better since, Shirley Temple is still a money maker and her movies are enjoyed worldwide-- I see it's no longer avaible so I'm only hoping that they plan to re-release it not poor quality this time. But, if you still want to see Shirley in Heidi which you should I recommend the VHS version I own it and find no problem with the quality of the tape and the picture is perfect.

Shirley sparkles in this movie taken as her age and value depreciated. The story will always remain a classic and in this version of Heidi it does not stick entirely to the story but, enough still to make it interesting. Jean Hearsholt does a wonderful job as the Grandfather who becomes charmed and beloved by Heidi. Shirley also does wonderful as the spunky cheerful natured girl who melts Hearsholt's heart. Stunning scenry and decent dialogue make this movie worth owning! My cousins love it and we watch it over and over again we get a little frightened when Shirley is almost sold to the gypsies... but, we love the scene in which Heidi begs the police not to take her away from her grandfather you see all that talent and acting shine through! And I hate to admit it but, I almost cry each time!

This is the movie I watch again and again... one of Shirley's better movies despite the fact it only has one song really ""In Our Little Wooden Shoes."" This has all the charm and wonderful beauty of a Shirley film, it also manages to be a good holiday film as well. A classic for all fans of the book and a keeper for all old movie and Shirley fans!",1108771200,8,1678,4.340764331210191
360476,5,6301797949,"I thought this was a great make movie of Joanna Spyri's timeless classic Heidi. They got all the characters right, and they at least got the plot right this time. I hope they come out with more books made into movies like this!
Heidi is a little orphan girl left under the care of her isolated Grandfather Adolf Kramer by her neglectful Aunt Didi. Heidi makes the best of staying with her Grandfather and learns to like it. Without knowing, she is bringing the life back into her Grandfather all by just being herself. When both soon learn to love each other, and Heidi gets the town to like her Grandfather again, Didi comes back and sells Heidi to a rich family in Frankfurt, Germany. There, she meets Clara, the invalid daughter of Heir Sessman. Heidi tries to teach her to walk, but she's too afraid, for both of them know that Frauline Rottenmeir the housekeeper doesn't want Clara to get better. The old woman makes Hiedi's stay there even worse by threatening her, and even smashing both Clara's, and Heidi's breakable Christmas presents. Heidi must get back to the Alps of Switzerland fast or else she'll sold to the Gispsies by evil Rottenmier.
Shirley Temple was a great actress for Heidi. If they tried, they couldn't get a better Heidi. She delivers all the time. The noly movie I don't recommend with her in it is the Blue Bird. That was boring as heck. I do recommend Curly Top though, and Wee Willy Winky. Those are both classics along with Heidi. Instant 5 stars!",1075420800,3,1479,4.584905660377358

I can't tell you how nuts my dad got when they switched to the movie.  You just had to be there.
I liked this movie as a kid, but my kids don't seem to care for it?.  I have young sons and daughters and they just don't care for Shirley Temple movies.  I view them a a glimse of an era long gone.",1057104000,,629,3.7196969696969697
360548,5,6301797949,"For the brief space of perhaps a half dozen years, Shirley Temple,with her songs, curls, dance steps, and tears, alone of dozens of child stars, managed to bring adult America back to their respective childhoods.  Shirley had the unique talent to make us remember both the joys and terrors of childhood.  In HEIDI, director Allan Dwan totally involves the audience in the most primal of all childhood fears--the loss of a loving parent. Shirley is Heidi, an orphan who is placed in the care of Adolf, the village curmudgeon who has the well-deserved reputation of insisting on his solitude.  She is dumped on his doorstep, and stares up at this huge,white bearded giant who is her grandfather.  She sees what the villagers do not: a man torn apart by incessant loneliness and hides behind his fears using surliness as a shield.  She knows that her childish goodness will eventually pierce his self-imposed armor.  They grow close, and you can see his layers of solitude slowly peel away.  The joy that Heidi feels, her grandfather feels, and so do you.  There is nothing corny nor saccharine about the tears of happiness that well in the eye.  By the middle of the film, joy reverts to loss, then to the terror that always results when a comfortable childhood is ripped away by a snarling witch who, in turn, delivers her to an even more frightening harpy.  The witch is Heidi's Aunt Dete (Mady Christians), who seeks only to turn a fast buck by selling her to a wealthy family who needs a healthy little girl to be the playmate of a crippled, but decent child Klara (Marcia Mae Jones).  When Heidi is brought to Klara's house, she thinks it is only for a visit, but the audience knows better, and this dramatic irony sets up a confrontation between Heidi and a harpy who ought to rank somewhere in the top two as the nastiest reincarnation of every child's nightmare of the inverse of the more traditional maternal earth mother. This defeminized horror is Fraulein Rottenmeir (Mary Nash), who seems to exist only to torment innocent girls.  As this Fraulein goes about her errands of misery, the effect on the viewer is to remind him of a series of fears about a pervasiveness of evil that he might have thought he had long since forgotten.  In fact, it is this ability of this movie to resurrect the entire spectrum of childhood angst mixed with an equal dose of childhood wonder that imbues it with a timeless wonder that even now can change a scoffing adult to a whimpering child.  By the movie's end, the viewer has run the same gamut of emotions as had Heidi.  Her interactions with the grandfather, Fraulein Rottenmeir, Klara, and Aunt Dete were the viewer's reactions as well.  At the end, the tears of joy have been tempered with the sad knowledge that joy and sorrow occupy the opposite ends of the human emotional chasm.",1042070400,,2831,4.67741935483871
360549,5,6301797949,"There are many memorable scenes in this movie about the little orphan who goes to live with her grandfather in the alps; my favorite is the one where Heidi is abducted by her meanie aunt. As they drive away in a horse sleigh, Heidi turns around and sees her beloved grandfather coming to rescue her. She cries, ""Grandfather! Grandfather!"" as only Shirley/Heidi can. What a little actress. She was so good in this film.
Jean Hersholt as her troubled, recluse grandfather is wonderfully crusty and loveable. When he walks into the church to surprise Heidi, grab your hankie. Who wouldn't want to climb that mountain with Goat Peter and frolic in the wildflowers like Heidi? This is a heartwarming movie the whole family will enjoy.",1027036800,2,729,4.84
360550,1,6301797949,"""Heidi"" is a charming film, and one of Shirley Temple's best star vehicles.  It was originally released in 1937, near the end of Temple's long reign as the Number One box office attraction in America.  In addition to a captivating performance by Miss Temple in the title role, it features excellent supporting turns from Jean Hersholt as the Grandfather, and the wonderful character actress Mary Nash as Temple's vitriolic adult nemesis (she also did a masterful job of menacing poor Shirley in the 1939 version of ""The Little Princess"").  Give the movie ****1/2 for its endearing sentimentality and lush production.
But rate the DVD an utter BOMB, and a dud at that.  Fox Home Video offers two versions of the film on this disc, neither one of which is an acceptable transfer of this fondly-remembered and eagerly-anticipated release.  One is the wretched ""colorized"" version that was released during that dreadful time in film history when modern businessmen dared to tamper with the classic artistry of bona fide filmmakers from the Golden Era (an experiment which critics and consumers alike rejected ... how many black and white classics are being colorized today?).  The other version offered on the DVD is a substandard transfer of a very poor black and white print that is an insult to consumers. It doesn't do the original film justice, and more importantly, it's NOT the best print currently available.  I predict that in a couple of years, Fox will offer a ""newly restored"" edition, and make the public buy this title once again to get an improved copy that should be available NOW.  (Can you say, ""Disney's 'Little Mermaid'""?)
I recommend you wait, and hold on to your money.  Do not encourage studios by purchasing whatever inferior product they toss into the marketplace.  This DVD is an insult to both Miss Temple whose box office popularity saved 20th Century-Fox from ruin during the depths of the Depression, and to the public who wishes to enjoy her unique talents on DVD.",1017360000,162,1991,4.934131736526946
360551,5,6301797949,"It's hard to be picky about any DVD that has Shirley Temple in it and while the quality of this one is not great it is very good, considering the age of the film.  Avoid watching the colorized version-it wasn't filmed that way so why bother?  I have been waiting many years for this reissue and I am not going to complain too much about it.  I have mixed feelings about this; an American treasure such as Shirley Temple deserves much better treatment not only for this film but ALL of her films.  On the other hand, if this is all we're going to get from Fox then let's enjoy it to the fullest.  If you really think this film is grainy, check out Shirley's ""Bright Eyes"", an otherwise delightful film but a bad transfer nonetheless.  I only hope that Fox intends to release other Shirley movies on DVD, such as ""Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm"", ""Curly Top"", ""Little Miss Broadway"", ""The Littlest Colonel"", ""Wee Willie Winkie"", ""Just Around the Corner"", ""Captain January"", and others.  I cannot begin to tell you how much I adore this little actress.  Talk about a bundle of talent!  Her combination of singing, dancing, acting, and just pure charm are qualities that simply are not going to be matched ever again.  Let's not get too critical of the plots and casting, either.  Okay, Heidi is about a German girl(or Swiss, I'm not sure) and Shirley Temple obviously sounds as ""American"" as you can get.  And, her co-star has a slightly Southern accent.  In ""The Little Princess"" she was supposed to be British but the film makers didn't have her hide the fact that she sounded American.  These pecularities occur throughout a lot of her films; that's just the way it was in those days, and it really isn't that different today.  Please don't take these films too seriously, and just enjoy them for what they are-showcases for the best child actor that ever was, and there will NEVER be another one like her.",1015718400,4,1902,4.602373887240356

I did however review the black and white promo for the film and it was very bad - sad. I wonder if the black and white film was as bad as someone had mentioned? He should get a better DVD player or just watch it in color and stop crying like a baby... get REAL!
The color in a few situations (times) did seem to flutter some
but when you consider the age of the film and all who can truly complain? Its sad that films with this heart and true feeling aren't made anymore. The demand is still there but Hollywood has forgotten what it means to take the time to make a lasting film that will stand the tests of time as this one has....
All actors were surperb in their unique roles. I espcially enjoyed the antics of the Grandfather and his gruff ways and the befuddled expressions on the butler Arthur Treacher...  the old woman that overlooked the care of the young girl was a true classic too.
Does she need a girls night out or what? Talk about your biddies!
I can't help but wonder.... was this Arthur Treacher guy anyway associated with a fast food (seafood) place of the same name?

Fact, Shirley Temple was and is still the most famous child star of all time!!!  For years & generations admired and watched her on television and videos.  Now, after a 3 year delay (I can see why now.) Fox releases Shirley on DVD.
NOTE: This Shirley Temple DVD Series is the most disappointing set ever.  The movie Heidi was a direct transfer from a very poor quality print!!!
Summary of DVD: Offered in 2 Full-Screen versions of Heidi.  A grainy/fuzzy Black & White transfer & a primitive computer generated color version.  Very difficult to watch and enjoy with today's high quality DVD's standards & Home Theatre environment.  Fox should be embarrassed at this release!  The DVD quality is way less than television and even inferior to some of the video copies I've seen. Stay with the video!!  Don't waste your time or disappoint yourself.  Rent this DVD at the minimum to see for yourself!!  This DVD series is not the one to introduce the next generation to Shirley Temple!!!
Story Summary:  Shirley Temple is at her best as a Swiss orphan who goes to live with her cranky old grandfather & wins his & our hearts. Shirley proves why she was the #1 Box Office star in the 1930's Hollywood.  In fact all her movies are pure entertainment so again shame on Fox for their poor quality DVDs.  Get the video!

He is a grumpy old man, but Heidi makes the best of the situation and gradually wiggles her way into the man's affections. Just when Heidi and her grandfather are truly settled and happy together, Heidi's aunt returns (on her birthday, unfortunately) and whisks her away to a bustling town, where she must live with Fraulein Rottenmeier and Klara. Fraulein is a coldhearted woman, but Klara is sweet and affectionate as she could be. An accident has left her in a wheelchair, and she is obviously in need of a friend to talk to her and lift her spirits. Heidi ends up being exactly what Klara needs, but forcing Heidi to live there means going against Heidi's will. She does not want to be there, and Fraulein certainly doesn't want her, either. Apparently, Fraulein is Klara's money-hungry caretaker, and the fact that Heidi is contributing to Klara's emotional, spiritual, and eventually physical healing threatens to put Fraulein out of her job.  Unfortunate circumstances force Heidi to stay right where she is. Throughout Heidi's quest to get back to her beloved grandfather, thorough displays of love and friendship come into play. This is an excellent movie for the entire family to watch together.

Now you may wonder, what's Heidi the Alpine Miss doing here in Frankfort anyway? Our film opens with Heidi's being deposited on her paternal grandfather by her shrewish Aunt Dete, who's tired of taking care of her sister's orphan.
