Would recommend the video just wish it was a bit cheaper.",1482105600,,200,4.128205128205129
8319815,5,B001LU93Q0,"This DVD set is great, it really shows the connection from traditional stances into practical fighting. Any martial artist studying striking arts could learn from this. A must have for the kung fu man.",1365638400,,201,4.9411764705882355
8319816,5,B001LU93Q0,"I bought this DVD as a supplement to my own training in the art of Hung Gar Kung Fu. Many of the stances in this DVD are identical to those practiced in Hung Gar and other Shoalin and Wutang styles and can easily be integrated into the training. Anyone who wants to know how to apply a punch or kick practically in any fighting situation should buy this DVD. Disc one shows the stances, footwork, punches, and punching combinations; it also prepares you for disc two which instructs in kicking techniques. Anyone and everyone will find this training useful, even if you are not a Kung Fu enthusiast.",1252281600,2,599,4.555555555555555
