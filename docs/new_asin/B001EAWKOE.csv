8297257,1,B001EAWKOE,"My first complaint is that 20-25 mins of this 50 instructional video is snippets of old cartoons...from opening credit to closing credits. And the artist makes no real reference to the cartoons. There's no introduction, narration, or real indication of why this cartoon was just thrown into the training.  In fact the last 10 minutes  of the video is a showing of a superman cartoon. The other 25 - 30 minutes was offered nothing hidden or innovative, he offered basic tips that you can find in any cartooning book.",1397606400,,515,4.775280898876405
8297258,1,B001EAWKOE,"If you like watch someone draw and the watch old comic movies this is the place for you.  If you want to develop drawing tips, skills this in not for you.",1368403200,,154,3.967741935483871
8297259,5,B001EAWKOE,"I'm a self-taught artist who really appreciated Larry Scholl's subtle, yet important drawing tips all the way through the DVD.

They make a huge difference in determining whether your drawing looks three-dimensional and lively, or stiff and flat.

As a visual learner myself, there's something about seeing him draw as he explained his methods that helped me a lot.

The classic cartoon examples that inspired him that he includes are good references of ""rubber hose"" animation, with Felix The Cat, as well as ""Squash and Stretch"" animation of Popeye.

I could really see what he was talking about with ""action lines"", while watching Popeye too.

There was also a more realistic, human style example of animation, with the rotoscoped, classic Superman cartoon.

The lessons are geared towards every one from beginner, to advanced artists, and when applied will surely make a difference in the final result of your art work.  Speaking of lessons, I also want to get Larry's book, by the same name.

I sincerely hope that Larry makes an in-depth series of DVDs about the subtle secrets of drawing traditional animation art, because he really knows his stuff, and I'll be the first one to get it.",1355356800,,1193,4.959798994974874
8297260,2,B001EAWKOE,"Larry Scholl is an experienced cartoonist. He did his best to teach three important, ""hidden"", cartoon drawing techniques which when used, will make your cartoon drawings more interesting and dynamic. However, I found the DVD to be short on instruction, and long in vintage cartoon movies. The toons selected were Felix The Cat:""Bold King Cole"", Popeye:""Greek Mirthology"", and Superman: ""The Mechanical Monsters"". I'd rather he used the classic cartoon movie time for more instruction. I was somewhat disapointed with the DVD, thus the two star review. There are better cartoon drawing DVDs out there, e.g. Bruce Blitz, Bob Ostrom, and Nils Osmar.",1264550400,,647,5.352941176470588
