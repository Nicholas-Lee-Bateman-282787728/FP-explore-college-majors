5657314,5,B00BNAE03Y,My son was over there and was a gunner on the choppers during some of those missions.  He would always tell me about his job over there but the National Geographic Program was an eye opener.  I am extremely proud of him and all the servicemen and women who were a part of that series.,1373068800,4,284,4.1454545454545455
5657315,5,B00BNAE03Y,"Well made look inside USAF pararescue ops!

Hard to watch at times, very heart wrenching. This series has a lot of meaning to me, my radar squadron controlled the Jolly Greens in Laos back in the day and my son is a rigger for the 58th RQS. A big salute and thanks to the PJ's and everyone that supports them.

5657369,5,B00BNAE03Y,"As a Nurse and with a son in the Australian Army, this was great. If he or any of his mates were ever to be looked after by a PJ I would know they were in the best hands in the worst conditions. Maybe the next Nat geo could be on the Aussies",1386288000,,241,3.5660377358490565

5657373,5,B00BNAE03Y,"I watched this series on TV, and will be buying this DVD.

I can't say enough about these young men who risk their lives for others. They appear to be intelligent, dedicated and caring. Watching this series has renewed my faith that there are some really outstanding young people out there, and I would be proud to have any of them as a son.

When they run out to that helicopter, my heart starts beating a little faster because I know that they're going into a dangerous situation, and I always breathe a little sigh of relief when they get back to base safely. It's wonderful to see how many they save, and it's heartbreaking to hear that some of their patients didn't make it. War is, truly, hell.

I would love to see a follow-up show in which we learn how those men are doing. Are they still on rotation? Are they still in the military? What career path will they have taken? All I know is, the USA is lucky to have such wonderful young people. Thanks, PJs, for all the great work you do.

I just hope all of them make it back safely.",1378425600,10,1039,4.258883248730965

5657377,5,B00BNAE03Y,They arrived on time! The series is a 'must see'!  I watched the series on TV but wanted to be able to share with others. My oldest son is a pilot of the HH-60 from Moody AFB.

8571474,5,B00BNAE03Y,"Hooyah! Step into the shoes of USAF Pararescue deployed in AFG. While this is a very romanticized depiction of what these men do it's a very emotionally driven look at those who give all that others may live.  Enjoy the stories, know that what you see here is a fraction of the efforts and trials these men face.",1469145600,,312,4.379310344827586
