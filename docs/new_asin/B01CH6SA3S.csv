7682993,5,B01CH6SA3S,"Another riveting adventure with Jack, Elizabeth and all of their friends. You will even meet some new characters, or characters you have briefly met in past episodes.
  Love abounds, but so does action, adventure, hope and terror. It doesnt matter what kind of show you like Heart of a Hero has it all.
  My favorite part of this episode is when the little boy Abigail is taking care of wants to be loved and how he goes about it. It is a very touching scene.
  Abigail and Frank have a long way to go in their relationship, but they don't give up.
  Jack and Elizabeth are always sweet together and seem to be getting along very well.
  If you have never seen the series When Calls the Heart {Cant believe there is anyone who hasnt} you will just love it. So much adventure and tenderness. Highly recommended.

7682995,4,B01CH6SA3S,"When Calls the Heart series is a wonderful romantic adventure drama series inspired by Janette Oke's novel and produced by Michael Landon, Jr. Heart of A Hero is Season 3's 3rd DVD. Even though Hope Valley gives Pastor Frank a second chance, his past still comes to haunt him. The Garrison gang is in town and is determined to recruit Frank to help them with their next robbery. Will Pastor Frank's relationship with Abigail (Lori Loughlin) withstand the turmoil? Bill Avery (Jack Wagner) starts to take interest in Dottie Ramsey (a widow). Lee Coulter has an ""accident"". Nurse Faith Carter from Union City (who took care of Jack's brother in the last season when she was working in Hamilton and was fond of Jack) comes to treat Lee's foot injury. She loves her job but her controlling fiance (a banker) doesn't seem to care and he makes her choose between him and her passion. Jesse (a young man who used to help Frank in past robbery) has an important decision to make. Which path will he take? Elizabeth (Erin Krakow) receives a special gift from Jack (Daniel Lissing). A new girl from Hamilton has a hard time adjusting to the new school in Hope Valley and she doesn't make it easier when others try to reach out to her. Will the ""Kindness Week"" assignment in class help? Is her meanness a mask for something much deeper? Henry Gowen's heartless greed rears its ugly head once again when he tries to raise new settlers' rent.

I really enjoyed this DVD. So many things happen but it's entertaining and uplifting. Love. Redemption. Community. Family. Prayer. Kindness. I appreciate all the Biblical values this show presents. I love seeing how residents in Hope Valley stand together to face their fears and troubles. I love the fact that this show is not afraid to acknowledge God and the importance of prayer. When Calls the Heart series is one of the rare shows that the whole family can enjoy together. I highly recommend it!

7682998,5,B01CH6SA3S,"Do you remember Little House on the Prairie growing up? If you are like me, you have a fondness for great family values that series instilled in us growing up. Thanks to Janette Oke, there is such a series available today that is just as great, considering Michael Landon Jr is the director, so the apple didn't fall far from the tree and once again When Calls the Heart is a series, the entire family can watch and enjoy.

Now in its fourth season, When Calls the Heart: The Heart of Faith was originally broadcast as The Heart of Christmas and gave viewers a look back into the lives of some of our favorite characters in Hope Valley again. Hearties take note, Canadian Mounty Jack Thornton (Daniel Lissing) and School Teacher, Elizabeth Thatcher (Erin Krakow) are feeling romance once again as our favorite honey moon couple Lee Colter and Rosemary have returned back to town and bringing with it all the romance one can hope for. Elizabeth is busy with plans for the Christmas pageant with her students and instead of having them audition for the roles, she wants them to encourage the spirit of giving towards one another with the winner being the one who was the most kind in each of the parts for the Nativity Story. When she receives word however that the supply train is delayed it seems as if the Christmas spirit is lost without costumes for the play, food for the feast, or presents for the kids.

But that is the true beauty about community spirit of Hope Valley, thus appropriately named, when the town rallies behind the cause and everyone gets into the spirit including a traveling peddler by the name of Sam, who seems to have just what everyone needs who comes to him. Is he Santa in disguise or is he a thief that is merely taking advantage of the good folks of Hope Valley. It will take a lot of cooperation from the town of Hope Valley to show us all what Christmas is truly about.

I received When Calls the Heart: The Heart of Faith compliments of Edify Films and The Hallmark Channel. The best part about the special DVD is that it also includes some great bonus features including a collector's sepia photograph of Jack Thornton in uniform, as well as a Bible Study Guide in the DVD. The guide itself is more than 30 pages long (including notes) that goes with more than 20 minutes of clips that are also on the DVD. Now that is what the heart of faith is truly all about. This would be a great visual resource to use in teaching a Bible Study on the meaning of faith and what it means as well as how we can share it. It is a full color resource available to download via the DVD! I easily give this a 5 out of 5 stars in my opinion.",1466553600,,2658,4.376518218623482
