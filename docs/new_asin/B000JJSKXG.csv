2674353,4,B000JJSKXG,"You know, I solely brought the movie because of the gay themed issue because I like movies that I could relate to (even though I am not in a gang myself)....however, I expected bad acting and a bad plot as well, but it was surprisingly good, touching, and emotional. The actors were really into each other as well (whether they are gay in real life or not). It really makes you root for the main couple....",1213747200,,406,4.355263157894737
2674354,1,B000JJSKXG,"This galling film-maker takes time (before the opening credits even begin) to plaster his film-festival awards and accolades before your eyes.  I guess the implication is that, if you don't like this film, then you must be wrong.

Well, then I must be wrong, because this poorly-paced, spottily-acted, amature film is remarkably unaffecting and pretty much pointless, unless you enjoy watching rival gang violence and lots of banal dialog.  Then there is the horrendous ending.  The comparisons to Romeo and Juliet are really unflattering to Romeo and Juliet.  This is not Shakespeare, and isn't even mediocre.

I'd skip this one and try something else.  Most gay movies, even cheapie indies, are far better than this.",1171843200,7,718,5.191304347826087
2674355,4,B000JJSKXG,"Gradually movie audiences are turning more serious attention to the little Independent films for quality and meaning in story and in style and in brave confrontation with issues outside the perimeter of the Hollywood style films.  A fine example is this remarkable film by student Tadeo Garcia whose first year in film school produced the outline of this little gem of a movie and whose courageous 'first film' gained the respect of screenwriter Roger B. Domain who helped him transfer the skeletal story into a full length film ON THE DOWNLOW, all on a budget of $8,000.!

From the opening scenes we can sense that we are watching a love story, but it is a story of forbidden love: Angel (Michael Cortez) is escaping his Chicago street gang with the help of Isaac (Tony Sancho) and the two warmly human, supportive, sensitive young youths flee to the territory of Isaac's low neighborhood where Isaac convinces Angel to give up his allegiance to his former gang and pledge to Isaac's gang, a rasty group led by Reaper (Donato Cruz).  Very gradually and with incredible decorum Garcia reveals to us that Angel and Isaac are lovers, the only time the union is shown physically is a prolonged kiss in an open night alley, an event which will trigger the force of destiny: it is enough as the scene is passionate yet gracefully not graphic.

The boys' mothers plead with them to not carry guns and to avoid gang alliance, but at the same time they lovingly accept their sons' sexuality. But life is as it is on the streets of south side Chicago and Angel is accepted into Isaac's gang, having to undergo the cruel initiation beating that accompanies his joining. Reaper is later informed that Angel is an ex-gang member of the rival gang and Isaac is the one Reaper determines should kill the offending Angel.  The two lovers try to escape Chicago but the inevitable happens and the ending is tragic but with undertones that are subtly captured by Garcia's eye, mind, camera, and heart: the final confrontation scene ends with our enabled view of evidence that other members of the gang share the same 'on the downlow' as Angel and Isaac.

Not only are Tony Sancho and Michael Cortez wholly believable in their dichotomous roles, but the entire cast is filled with raw yet gifted talent: Felipe Camacho as the Priest, Beatriz Jamaica as Angel's mother and Carmen Cenko as Isaac's mother, Donato Cruz as Reaper, Adelina Quinones (a terrific screen presence) as Laura, and all the youngsters who convincingly bring the gang members to life.  Yes, there are evidences of low budget constraints, but the overwhelming success of the story of two young men in love against the backdrop of hopelessness of crime is brilliant evidence that Tadeo Garcia is a gifted talent to watch.  Recommended for all audiences.  Grady Harp, February 07",1171843200,3,2827,4.812371134020618
2674356,3,B000JJSKXG,"It is cruel to give this film just three stars, because its heart, soul, and spirit are five stars.  It is a must-see for any one who is looking for signs of intelligent life on the planet.

The credits tout its success in many film festivals.  Only uneven pacing and an ending insufficiently violent to be satisfying mark this as an early work in someone's arc.  This is Shakespearean tragedy, after all.  The stage should be littered with corpses.

Some may want to stop reading here.  Anyone who recognizes to which tragedy I refer, or who has seen West Side Story, may guess some of the ending.

The story is about two families, here as two Chicago gangs that are its members' families.  A member of one gang has a member of the other as a lover, secretly.  The second man wants to leave his gang, and join the other.  If the gang he wants to join discovers him as a member of the other, he will be killed.

There are many other elements from Shakespeare's version included in this film, such as a reference to the famous masquerade ball from Shakespeare, as well as to the dance at the gym in West Side Story.  I'll leave it to others to identify more, or to disagree with me.

I hope that the makers of the film have not read the play to which I refer; that would make the parallels downright spooky and even archetypal.",1168646400,11,1326,4.359183673469388
2674387,3,B000JJSKXG,"It was okay. The plot of the movie was nice. Although it was low budget, that was not the issue. Just a lack of romance which caught me off guard. Overall it's worth watching though.",1310169600,,182,4.228571428571429

2674392,4,B000JJSKXG,"Finally, a story about love between two masculine males in the hood without the obligatory homo stereotypes.

This is a film about two lovers who embrace their masculinity.  I found the story line quite compelling - a hidden and forbidden relationship that draws to a tragic conclusion.

On the downside side, you can tell that the production is slightly amateur and low buget. The pace of the film is a bit slow in some spots - However- it is definitely worth viewing. A tragic romance about two rival gang bangers tastefully done!!!",1237334400,,534,4.782608695652174

2674394,1,B000JJSKXG,"This is the most boring low budget movie I have ever seen. I couldn't get past the first ten minutes which consisted of: two guys following another guy, somebody getting shot and a then, a bunch of cursing. The sound is terrible, the dialogue is terrible, the acting is terrible. Plus, when you sit down with your bowl of popcorn, you have to sit through five minutes of a listing of the different rewards that they have received.

8151359,3,B000JJSKXG,"This was surprisingly good to me. The main guys were very real and authentic. It's about 2 gang bangers who are in love with each other and trying to find a way to be together while living such a dangerous life at the same time.

I just wanted to knock some sense into them so they would get out of the gangster way of life, but they just get even deeper into it. I don't like the ending but I'm impressed with what they did with such a small budget.",1332806400,,450,4.0
8151360,4,B000JJSKXG,"Preconcieved beliefs will force many not to watch this movie. The title and write up alone  will result in  multitudes putting  this dvd down, without giving it a chance. I am one who holds Judeo-Christian, ultra conservative views, but I am not afraid to watch movies or listen to the ideas of others with whom I might not agree. For those who thing this movie is full of gratuitous gay sex, you are wrong. There is not one scene of such. If there were, if it added to the telling of a decent story, then it should not change one's morals. This was a good movie. Now the moral is tolerance. But, I am one who believes that sin should not be tolerated, including the sin of mistreating others because we think or live differently. We can respect each other , even if we do not respect each others life choices.

The movie tells the story of two gay lovers from two different gangs. One leaves his gang to join his lover in the other. Both men seem frustrated with gang life, but it is the life they know. Both men are on the ""downlow"" about their homsexuality and Angel's defection from his former gang, which the latter forces his lover, Jacob, to have to make a terrible choice. The movie centers around the two young men and their relationship. Everyone else dips in and out, showing us, the viewers how we act and what we think of homosexualtiy, as mothers, coworkers, obsevers, religous followers etc, etc. The gang aspect seems to be derived from someone's experience behind the camera. As good as this movie was, the most dramatic, touching moment , for me, was after Jacob commited suicide, after his gang leader killed Angel, when two of Jacob's fellow gang members looked on at the two dead lovers, and then slowly held hands. It is as if Jacob and Angel's sacrifice will make their ""stepping out"" a little easier, in other words, they paid a price, so the handholders will not have to. Though not the same thing, I would equate that to Tennis pioneer Arthur Ashe taking the abuse he did so that James Blake and the William Sisters would not have to. Of course, this had nothing to do with why Angel was murdered, but it was one theme of the movie-the  disrespect some must face for the lifesyles  they live.

This wasn't the most expensive movie to make. I doubt if any viewerw will remember the names of any of the actors, if you asked, but this is a very good movie, more than worth watching over and over again.",1323475200,3,2425,4.448198198198198
8151361,1,B000JJSKXG,"ok, i am a gay male, i lived in big cities, small towns,and everywhere in between,and have yet to hear anyone refer to thier special someone as ""bro"" gay or straight. the story is boring, the actors are boring, but at least i know what to give to someone i do not like for christmas.this is a step down from getting coal,at least coal has use like you can burn it for heat, or it will turn into a diamond, i advise to use it for heat ,you might be waiting for awhile if you chose the other",1317427200,,489,4.0
8151362,4,B000JJSKXG,"The whole overall of this movies was very good. Two Latin gangsters having an intimate relationship without the whole stereotype gay thing was good. They are masculine, they have dreams, they fight and mostly, they love each other.

I don't know too much about the actors but i thought they were good and very HANDSOME. They are trying to keep up with the gang thing, their families and their love to be with each other. One of them comes into a awful decision, to kill his partner when the gang leader finds out he used to be on the enemy gang.

Now, the production was allright, considering it came from an amateur producer, it was good. The producer did leave alot to be desire. More romance, more struggles and a better END. I was so dissapointed at the end. That's why i didn't give it 5 stars. I thought it should've ended way different but it was TIGHT!!! I haven't movies like these in a long time and being able to see a story about two Latinos from the street loving each other like that, They gotta make another Movie!!!!!!

There are many positive responses to it, but I ain't gonna echo them.
