Excellent dvd will use in humanities classes.
Christopher Plummer narrates. Perfect length: 40 min. (IMAX quality)",1487721600,,155,5.782608695652174
7872966,1,6304492421,"Meh, if you like B movies...",1486512000,,28,3.8333333333333335
7872967,3,6304492421,"I had seen this movie in Imax form years ago and thought it okay.  I purchased it as a gift for my daughter, a high school teacher who was intrigued by my photos taken of the famed terra cotta army.  It seemed like an effective way to present the basic facts about Qin Shihuang since it covers all of the basic stuff - the brutality of the wars, the assassin delivering the head of the enemy, the book burning, burying of scholars, and rationalizing such disparities as coinage, weight, axle widths and even writing.  Plus the obsession with immortality and the self poisoning with mercury. The one additional legend that does not get thrown in is about the sleazy nobleman who may have actually been the emperor's real father.  So not exactly great dramatic cinema, but a rather painless way for those not into history books to acquire the basic facts about an important personage in Chinese culture.",1420588800,2,901,4.6835443037974684
7872968,3,6304492421,"The film seemed to follow the ""script"" for the life of the emperor as far as history goes but was overacted at times.  It was in parts, reminiscent of some martial arts films with overplayed drama.  The sets and scenery were good but overall I've seen better versions of the same theme.",1405641600,,286,4.480769230769231
7872969,5,6304492421,"An excellent film. Informative and compelling, and very satisfying visually. The narration by Christopher Plummer must have a special mention: he lends such authority.",1211241600,2,167,6.0
7872970,1,6304492421,I can't believe IMAX allowed their name to be connected to this film. I teach Chinese history and I had high hopes when I bought this DVD - needless to say - I'm trying to figure out a way to get rid of it!,1087430400,7,206,3.7045454545454546
7872971,2,6304492421,I was very disappointed with this video - I've seen much better on the History Channel.,1087430400,4,87,4.5
7872972,1,6304492421,This is not a documentary. It is a poorly made docudrama of the story of the first emperor of China. Only a couple of minutes of archival footage of the Terra Cotta Army at Xian are shown. The audio and video are of poor quality. The film was produced by the National Film Board of Canada and China Xi'an Film Studio. The dialogue is in Chinese with English subtitles and narration.,979430400,22,382,4.394366197183099
7872973,1,6304492421,"I was dissapointed with IMAX's First Emperor of China documentary, it's a very light approach to this great passage in history. Terrible sound where background sounds get confused with actors scripts. Colors and photography are terrible, this is not IMAX's best, neither from the technical nor artistic point of view. Very short documentary I do not recommend it at all.",975801600,10,370,5.183333333333334
