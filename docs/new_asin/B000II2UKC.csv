8145557,5,B000II2UKC,"I've said it before, but I love Bill Plympton's animated work. This one's a lot of fun, even though the story's a tad dark. I'd say it's normal as far as the levels of blood & guts (for Bill) and maybe a bit less on the sexual situations. They're still there, because it's Bill Plympton and without such features it would not be, much like Tim Burton would not be himself without a certain look to all of HIS films.
So, definitely not for the kiddos, but definitely worth a watch!",1480377600,,480,4.285714285714286
8145558,5,B000II2UKC,"It's crazy, big stars [to me] in small roles. DON'T EVEN LOOK AT THE NAMES! LET IT BE A SURPRISE! Anyhow, Bill Plympton is very talented, and somehow turned out something that seems poetic, and is lit in this eternal color. Reminiscent of Grease!",1398297600,,246,4.613636363636363
8145559,2,B000II2UKC,"I got this movie thrown in for free through an online store when I bought Rob Zombie's The Haunted World of El Superbeasto. Just watched it and was bored throughout the whole thing. The animation is alright I suppose but the storyline was weak and found it on the very mild side of 'weird'. Was surprised to learn Sarah Silverman voices the lead female character.

Not bad for free but I probably won't watch it again.",1375056000,,418,4.5
8145560,4,B000II2UKC,"One of the most easily recognisable auteurs working in animation, Bill Plympton has produced a succession of animated features and shorts over the last few years which delight with their unique style and idiosyncratic world view. His is a bizarre world which, unusually for such hand drawn work, normally assumes the presence of an adult audience and where the exaggerations of sex can be sniggered over for all the right reasons. HAIR HIGH is no exception, and continues the animator's regular obsessions with the strained relationships between
sexually optimistic men and women, detailed with black humour all the while laced with some side swipes at the ironies of romance. There's
also plenty of hair spray, horny chickens, a good soundtrack, smoking,and the genital stimulation of frogs. Rudeness, surreality and extremes of physical contortion appear again as part and parcel of the plymptonesque world - which this time includes nods to such disparate films as REBEL WITHOUT A CAUSE, NIGHT OF THE HUNTER and THE CASTLE OF CAGLIOSTRO. HAIR HIGH is voiced by such talent as Keith and David Carradine, Ed Begley Jnr and Matt Groening. Ostensibly a moralistictale of 50's high school love that ends in comi-tragedy, HAIR HIGH actually engages as a characteristic free wheeling fantasy, allowing the animator to indulge in all sorts of off the wall scenes and images propelling the narrative forward. For those better used to the tight pencil work and plot construction of more regularly exposed animation studios Plympton's work, which leaps more immediately from the artist's bizarre subconscious, often comes as a wake up call. In its attempt to drag cartoons out of the juvenile closet Plympton's longer work has been blazing a trail for years. With not a cuddly, wise-cracking animal in sight and a hands-off view with regards to any computer generated figures (or committee-created plots), HAIR HIGH is a must for admirers of Plympton.",1337731200,,1943,5.191082802547771
8145561,4,B000II2UKC,"This film is now available through Bill Plympton's website!
I got my copy and have finally been able to watch this film. I've been a fan of Mr. Plympton's films for a long time. This film has a ""cleaner"" appearance due to his use of cel animation (according to DVD commentary). So, the sketchy appearance of some of his other animation doesn't show here.
I enjoyed the film. I felt that the ending didn't hit hard enough, but at least one reason for that is given in the commentary. As an independent animator, Bill Plympton has full artistic control over his films. On the one hand, this means that the artist's vision is what appears on the screen (if they can afford to present it). On the other hand, this means that some of the artist's choices might only be accessible to a limited audience. But...that's how art works.
Part of the reason I enjoy Bill Plympton's films is because most of his choices entertain me. Most of them.
Overall the story has elements that have been seen before: Kids in high school, the new kid, the thuggish popular guy, his popular girlfriend, a soda shop, the prom...what could possibly go wrong?
Well, there are the additional things that an animator can put into a film since he (or she) controls everything that appears. After all, it's drawn.
So, there's a bit of oddness involving a chicken suit in one spot; and a frog in another; and a skeleton or two.
There's a short ""film within the film"" that perfectly illustrates a Plympton take on a common movie plot; with elements of horror/humor blended with terrific draftsmanship.
This film is nowhere near as bizarre as Mr. Plympton's previous films; The Tune, I Married a Strange Person, and Mutant Aliens. Hair High has its moments, but nothing as far out as the other three films.
Voice talents include: Dermot Mulroney, Sarah Silverman, David Carradine, Keith Carradine, Beverly D'Angelo, Justin Long, Matt Groening, and others.
But, this is NOT mainstream animation.
My DVD has these extras: director's commentary, scene breakdown, some voiceover clips, the anicam film, a film about making the rooster costume, a film premier clip, interviews, and some trailers. There are NO animated shorts on this DVD--at least that I could find.
Overall, I'm glad I got the DVD. Everyone can get one from the website.",1277510400,,2297,4.803030303030303
8145562,5,B000II2UKC,"Bill Plympton should be made a national treasure. He's made quirky independent feature films for years. Now HAIR HIGH shows Plympton in his prime. The, story, design, animation, music, color, and characters in HAIR HIGH are his best yet. HAIR HIGH is funny, imaginative, and has hints of (literal) murky depths behind its candy-colored facade. It is a film that I will view more than once for the full effect.

Why on Earth this film is only available on a French DVD is a mystery to me. I would not run this for small children, but there are plenty of adults who would like this very much if it could actually be seen in the USA. College students would be inspired. This is MUCH better than anime.

Well, we can only hope that this excellent movie is one day available to a wider US audience. Til then, get an 'all zone' DVD player or use the computer. You won't regret this.

Extras include a fine interview with Plympton and the hilarious short film THE GUARD DOG.",1174521600,,967,4.482954545454546
