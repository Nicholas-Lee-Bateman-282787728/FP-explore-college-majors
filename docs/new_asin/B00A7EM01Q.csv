8547853,2,B00A7EM01Q,"I have no problems with the movies, even though they are a bit cheesy and clearly 'low-budget'.  They are still fairly entertaining, and hold their own, especially for kids.  BUT the video quality (maybe in the transfer to DVD?) is simply terrible, with a rather grainy picture.  No wonder this DVD was found at a major retailer's 'bargain bin' for just under two dollars!",1456099200,,372,4.78125
