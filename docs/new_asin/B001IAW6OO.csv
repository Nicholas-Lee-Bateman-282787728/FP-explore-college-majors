I've had to content myself with downloads from U-tube. Please release a USA DVD format.

8310596,5,B001IAW6OO,"Dawn French at her comedic and chameleon-ic best as she tackles roles from a nuclear physicist to a Latin-American maid to a red-hot sex symbol, and more -- all having to do with M-U-R-D-E-R!

I waited for over a decade for this DVD to be released in the USA.  Finally, bought an all-region DVD player, ordered MURDER MOST HORRID, and never looked back.

PROS:  Dawn French, funny, original, entertaining, feel-good fun.
CONS:  Need MORE, MORE, MORE!",1294099200,7,450,4.868421052631579
8310597,5,B001IAW6OO,"...there was Murder Most Horrid, which I was lucky enough to discover on BBC America many years ago. Each episode is complete unto itself and has different characters played by a small stock group, plus a weekly guest star. And the material! Think The Loretta Young Show meets Hitchcock Presents meets Monty Python. Absolutely wonderful, and a crying shame that it's not available in the US.",1277164800,6,391,4.9393939393939394

8310599,5,B001IAW6OO,"This series is so hilarious and needs to be made in a U.S. Format. I think it is the funniest Dawn french has ever done!

I highly recommen it but in U.S. Format!!",1262563200,5,163,3.9393939393939394
