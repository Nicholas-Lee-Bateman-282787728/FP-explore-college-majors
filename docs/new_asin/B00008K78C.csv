7985070,4,B00008K78C,"This Israeli film is in Hebrew with English subtitles. It is a typical 'ethnic comedy' of life among Israelis of Iraqi descent. If you understand the term 'chakh chakh' then you'll understand. Much of the Hebrew is slang and represents a common street humor from a few decades ago.

The story involves Charlie who is a scam artist and his young protege. Charlie falls in love with a rich girl but gets found out. He finally gets serious about something in his life and finds himself wanting to be honest. She has to figure out what is more important in her life.

If you appreciate 'Mizrahi' humor or would like the chance to experience it this is a good choice.",1102723200,3,662,4.508333333333334
