8739176,4,B00BF7OEHW,"This is definitely better than #13 in the series.  The new crew hits a home run.  Well, they at least hit a triple with #14.  While I do miss the old cast from 1 - 12, the new crew seems to have gotten it together for the 14th submission in the Shake Rattle & Roll franchise.  I especially liked the last short film in #14's offerings.  It is a great creature feature with a science fiction twist.  It has a nice old school feel with some new school sfx.",1525478400,,454,4.044943820224719
8739177,3,B00BF7OEHW,It's not the best and definitely not the worst B-movie.  Most stories in the SR&R series were downright idiotic.  I enjoyed the first two stories but hated the third and last one.,1521849600,,179,4.5625

8739179,5,B00BF7OEHW,I love the entire series of Shake Rattle & Roll.  Too bad they don't have part 1 available on DVD as the original/master copy got destroyed on a fire.,1368576000,,150,4.172413793103448
