8725181,4,B003GWRDQI,"I would very much have preferred that the gospel stuff had been left off this collection--or at least put on a separate DVD. I love John Tesh and appreciate that his religion means everything to him, but the quality of the gospel music is so below par and SO monotonous that it takes the enjoyment out of the overall experience. I'm giving it four stars, though, because the other selections are outstanding. The joy and energy he puts into his performances are exhilarating and contagious! John, please have them keep the religious stuff off your future collections.",1488412800,,567,4.855670103092783
