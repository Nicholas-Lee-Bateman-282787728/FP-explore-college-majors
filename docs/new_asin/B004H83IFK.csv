4375496,5,B004H83IFK,"These dvds are great!  We took them on a long trip in the car to Florida for vacation.  They filled our time well.  The Oceans movies are all about stealing and comedy.  Fun, light hearted, and will keep you interest.  Enjoy!",1396915200,,225,4.390243902439025
4375497,1,B004H83IFK,"The dvd was like a bad bootleg. I was attracted to the product for the price, but I was very disappointed.",1392940800,,106,4.095238095238095
4375498,5,B004H83IFK,Great Value. All Three Ocean's movies in one package brand new. All three DVD's are great. It is nice to know that I own the movies and can watch them anytime versus renting them.,1376092800,,179,4.294117647058823

4375503,1,B004H83IFK,I didn't try playing the first DVD in this set (Ocean's Eleven) but the two movies on the second DVD both failed to play all the way through.  Each crashed at the same point in every player I tested it in.,1470096000,,205,4.0

4375505,1,B004H83IFK,I started watching Oceans 13 and in the middle of the movie the disc hung up and wouldn't play anymore so I had to return it. If the replacement disc fares better I will adjust this review.,1469577600,,189,4.135135135135135
4375506,1,B004H83IFK,"Oceans 11 was fine.  However, Oceans 12 and 13 (same disk) froze halfway through on both sides and wouldn't recover.  Reported this once and was sent replacement.  Unfortunately replacement did the exact same thing at the exact same place.  Poor grey market copies.",1469404800,,265,5.093023255813954

4375508,1,B004H83IFK,This was not the film trilogy as advertised. It only contained Ocean's 11 & Ocean's 12. Buyer beware!,1468368000,,101,4.666666666666667
4375509,5,B004H83IFK,"Ocean's 11 & 13 are among my top favorites of all times. OCean's 12 not so much.
Very reasonable price too. I would have loved to have a digital copy of those, but such is not included.
Studuos should start providing a digital copy with every DVD/BD sold , including on Amazon.",1468022400,,277,4.346153846153846

4375517,2,B004H83IFK,"The first two disks were great but Oceans 13 skipped so bad that we had to finally take it out.  We couldn't return it because we didn't watch it until it was past the ""window of return"" but I wanted to let the next customer know that yall need to watch the movies as soon as you get them so that you can return them if they are defective.",1451260800,2,339,3.9130434782608696

4375524,5,B004H83IFK,I'm glad I found this.,1431820800,,22,3.6
4375525,2,B004H83IFK,"Ocean's twelve and thirteen are bad movies, as far as I am concern, compare to Ocean' Eleven, they are bad and very bad. why?  The whole plot was so difficult to follow. I really wish those actors or producer do us a favor and big favor, do make any Ocean movie sequel any more.  The more they make, the more I'll despise them.

In Ocean Eleven, it was much easier to know the plot, it seemed straight forward. however, the twelve and thirteen were much difficult and I found out those acting in these two movies were overacting and too over-dramatic, something may be somebody think is funny, but I don't think that way.

As far as Amazon is concern, I like their service. I don't have any complaining to make.

Thanks Amazon.",1420070400,,727,4.43609022556391
4375526,1,B004H83IFK,Ocean's 11 was a nice disc with cover graphics but 12 and 13 was one disc that can be played on either side with no graphics. Looks like a poor attempt to package 3 movies. Thought it would look a little bit more put together.,1419811200,2,226,4.044444444444444
4375527,1,B004H83IFK,DVDs came in scratched up and don't play correctly... I would really appreciate a refund or another copy of these DVDs.,1413676800,2,119,4.714285714285714
4375528,1,B004H83IFK,They made returning my dvd so complicated that it was not worth the trouble. They also insinuated that I was lying about the damages the dvd had.,1412208000,,145,4.407407407407407
4375529,1,B004H83IFK,The 'collection' only contained 11 and 12.  The Oceans 13 DVD wasn't in the package.,1407024000,,84,4.6
8429370,1,B004H83IFK,"This is one of my favorite trilogies, and I love buying and collecting DVDs and Blu-rays, so I bought this thinking it looked like a great deal. The trilogy comes with two disc. Oceans 11 is on the first. The second disc is double sided with the other two. The quality is very disappointing for a DVD, being very grainy. The double sided disc seems to freeze and skip all of the time. I have never seen a worse quality DVD than this, and I own many DVDs of early movies from the 50s and 60s. Long story short, spend the extra couple of dollars for a better version or consider buying the Blu-ray trilogy pack, which is what I ended up having to do.",1523318400,,648,4.192
8429371,4,B004H83IFK,"Good: The delivery was fast. The package arrived safe.
Not So Good: Both Ocean's 12 & 13 came on a ""Single Double_Layer DVD"". That was neither mentioned in product description. nor on the package.",1518652800,,196,4.794117647058823
8429372,1,B004H83IFK,"The second disk was completely scratched and had fingerprints all over it, if it was still playable I would give it a higher rating but the film skips continuously. If I am able to get a replacement that works I will give it a five-star rating, as it is one of my favorite film collections.",1514160000,,290,4.290909090909091
8429373,2,B004H83IFK,"The Ocean's 11 dvd has markings that indicate that it is indeed 11. Both Ocean's 12 & 13 have no markings to indicate which is which! External packaging is cheaply constructed, thus the inexpensive pricing.",1500336000,,206,4.914285714285715
8429374,5,B004H83IFK,What a great bargain. I love these movies and there-in-one set is perfect,1495411200,,73,4.6923076923076925
8429375,5,B004H83IFK,"Hubby and I have enjoyed the Ocean's Trilogy movies.  Good remake of the original Ocean's Eleven with Frank Sinatra and the rest of the Rat Pack.  Having all three films together makes the viewing experience SO much better.  No waiting to see what happens in the next upcoming account.  Just love that.  The actors are fun to watch.  Most of the stars are so well known, that watching them perform is fun.  Most (if not all) of the minor stars have appeared in more things so it's fun to see how they perform in other types of movies and tv shows.  Altogether an enjoyable purchase.",1494115200,,582,4.476190476190476

8429379,3,B004H83IFK,"Movies arrived sealed, but was not sealed in the typical way with white perforated strip on top of box. ""Disk made in Mexico"" is printed on lower back of disk box. Although I purchased this as NEW, one of two disks had a scratch in it which caused the movie to freeze. I had to forward through that part of the movie. Price was around $8.00 rather than the $21.00 I almost paid for on similar item.",1480032000,,398,4.181818181818182
