2356653,4,B000A3WH9Y,"My 2 1/2 years old loves it - I think a little more than Professor parrot speaks Spanish.  [I must also mention that she has several Spanish language tools like books, classroom style charts with English and Spanish numbers, colors, and shapes and and other DVD/CDs]  We call the time we spend viewing this DVD our ""Spanish Lesson"" and I notice that when many of the words appear on the screen in Spanish she will shout it out before the narrator says it.  I think that it is a good complement to the other tools that we use and I look forward to the other volumns.",1127692800,40,565,4.311320754716981
2356654,5,B000A3WH9Y,"There's a lot packed into this DVD.  The DVD is split into 5 chapters with a specific learning theme.  After each scene, the characters review what was taught and then follow up with a song or a DVD game.  My kids enjoyed the games, the music and the kooky animated Chihuahua that jumps in with the human characters.  In the past, I had a difficult time getting them to study Spanish with books and CDs but this DVD really had them interested in learning more.",1125187200,106,460,4.376470588235295

I like that, as opposed to other children's ASL programs I have seen, this teaches proper ASL grammar and manners.

The little girl loved this DVD!  It was more engaging to her than the books.  She particularly liked the songs which she can recite from memory.  Her vocabulary has improved and she is excited about learning more.  As a native speaker educated in Mexico, I found the accents of both the kids and adults in the video to be good.  I am studying to be a teacher and I can see using this video with children as young as four and up to middle school.",1445990400,,603,4.191304347826087

2356781,5,B000A3WH9Y,I got this DVD for my 5 year old kid to introduce her into Japanese and she really liked it. She had so much fun getting through the games and she watched this over and over again. She learned a lot of words and expressions along the way and that's why I think it was well worth it!,1395446400,,282,3.8793103448275863

2356803,3,B000A3WH9Y,"While ""American Sign Language for Kids: Learn ASL Beginner Level 1, Vol. 1"" does cover a lot of material, it is breezed through very quickly. I understand the concept of wanting to make a DVD which will not bore children with lengthy repetition, but a single half-hour lesson covering letters, numbers, pronouns, family relationships, rooms in a house, titles of people in authority and colors is definitely too much knowledge being thrown at a child at one time. Also, I feel the value for the money is not there, given you are paying for ONE half-hour lesson.

That said, both my young children enjoyed the DVD and will enjoy watching it many, many times. I don't know how much sign language they will absorb, but at the very least, they will learn a little something about the ASL world.",1388620800,3,790,4.683453237410072

2356806,5,B000A3WH9Y,"I wish I had known this whole video was just one ""Chapter."" It was very short for the price, but good enough I will probably spring for future volumes.

2356814,4,B000A3WH9Y,"I've always wanted to learn sign language and finally am giving it a try. This dvd is set into chapters or you can watch it start to finish. My only complaint is you can't see the alphabet signs crystal clear against her yellow sweater, it's too close to skin color. Also they show her from the front and a young child from behind so you can see the hand both ways and the camera doesn't capture the childs hand in a couple shots. These are minor complaints and I will order the next dvds in the series. By the way I learned the abc's,numbers and some colors buy my third time watching! Feel pretty good about it!

2356817,4,B000A3WH9Y,This dvd really helps to learn the alphabet and some words for family members. My children have retained some information from this dvd but I guess I need to purchase the next volume to learn more.,1363219200,,197,4.5
2356818,4,B000A3WH9Y,"I bought this DVD to help supplement some of the ASL I've been teaching to my 3.5 year old.  The alphabet is easy to follow as you can see the way you're supposed to sign from both your perspective and the perspective of the person you're signing with.  It also includes numbers, pronouns, some occupations, family members, and colors.  I also really liked that it included some social etiquette do's and don'ts for when you're speaking with someone who is deaf.  For example, don't be watching another person's signing conversation as that's considered eavesdropping.  The video is better for the 5+ crowd as it describes a lot of movements and is more instructional than it is playful for the younger crowd.  With its more instructional tone, a few parts of it were a bit slow and methodical.  My 3.5 year old was a bit bored with it, so I'll probably hold off showing it to him again until he can understand more of what they're talking about and just continue teaching him myself.  I found it useful for myself though as I was able to getting a better idea of the movements used to sign with.  Great instructional video for older children and adults.",1362355200,23,1154,4.617647058823529

2356831,4,B000A3WH9Y,"I'm glad I brought this DVD after contemplating about it for a year.  What I like most about it is that there are Authentic Spanish people in it - which is Great for a change.  I like this a lot for my 2  yr old, and it's great practice for myself as well - as we are both learning Spanish.  The dog singing I could could  see that being hard to understand for a child learning.  The one of the best parts of this DVD, is when the dog says ""Muy Bien""!  Me and my child both love that part.  What I don't care for about this dvd, is a small child won't be able to do the quizzes until he knows how to work the remote.  But overall, I'm very satisfied, that I brought this, and I love forward to buying all that they put out when learning Spanish.  I give it 4  stars.  It covers a decent amount of beginning Spanish.  Also, my son does enjoy this DVD as well - it holds his attention, and he does understand a good bit of Spanish, we've been learning since he was about 5 months old.",1357257600,,982,3.9489795918367347

2356834,4,B000A3WH9Y,"My kids (girls ages 8 and 10) liked this video and learned what it taught. So by that measure, it was good.

It was pretty short - maybe 20-30 minutes total (I didn't keep exact track). So your kids won't learn tons of Spanish from this video. But it will introduce some words and phrases. They learn family names (for brother, mom, etc.), basic colors, counting 1 to 10, and a few other words like pants, sweater, toy, etc. Numerous phrases were introduced as well, but I don't think you are meant to really learn them all, just to be exposed to them at this point.

The animated characters were rudimentary-goofy, but in a way that my kids enjoyed. The live-action acting was not stellar but was OK overall.

We got this video from our library after trying two or three other series. This video was the only one my kids didn't hate. My girls laughed a lot at the goofy dog dancing.

Is this the most effective approach to teach kids Spanish? I have no idea, but it seemed to work well enough.",1354406400,,994,4.385869565217392
2356835,5,B000A3WH9Y,"Overall, this video is a good tool to learn basic Japanese.  The main characters all speak native or near-native Japanese with a natural cadence.  The little boy was very cute.  My kids enjoyed the songs and animated dog (Akita?) who followed the little boy.  You won't learn grammar, but you will learn lots of useful phrases and words that are common in everyday Japanese.",1354233600,,374,4.796875

There is like no organization or reason to this video.  Yes, it has some basic words for some family members, colors, etc but you can find the same content in a much less annoying form using one of the many free apps available for your iphone.

The graphics are awful.  The sound is awful, some parts very soft some parts very very loud.  The songs are annoying.  The boy main character is annoying and mumbles.  Yeah sure, in real life people mumble and I guess if you really want to learn to speak a language you should learn how to understand mumbling people but I think that's a more advanced skill.  For a kid video, I think it's better to have the actors speak clearly and a little slowly.

My child was not entertained by this at all and even I lost interest before the whole thing aired.

CONS: The computer animated dog is cheesy and not integrated with the live action. The narrator mispronounces words and even mistakenly uses the word for grandmother when referring to the grandfather. The workbook that comes free with the DVD is not a workbook, but a booklet that fits in the DVD case and isn't very helpful.
PROS: The main characters in the show are obviously native speakers and use normal informal Japanese that children would actually speak. It's cheap.

The topics taught were basic, but very useful - how to meet and greet others, words for family members, counting, colors, etiquette and eating/drinking.  The lessons were easy to follow and while there was a lot of repetition, it was not boring.  Unlike other language learning videos, this one uses a story-based approach which gives the lessons some context.  Each DVD chapter was a lesson on conversation or vocabulary but all of the chapters flowed from a single storyline around a kid's birthday party.  After the scene ends, there are reviews, interactive games and songs to help reinforce new words.  The songs are very catchy - I find myself humming them aferwards. There are a lot of unexpected, fun elements to this video that I didn't find other Spanish learning videos (which I found to be very baby-ish with hand puppets and goofy songs).

I'm a new learner but I found the pacing to be fine.  The actors sounded clear and natural.  I highly recommend this DVD for beginners and those who want to refresh their elementary Spanish.",1317686400,,1079,4.820652173913044

I don't know if I have gotten spoiled by the obviously superior production values of Nick Jr. and PBS children's shows...but am not crazy about this series, especially at these prices.

The presenter is a man dressed up as a tree and there's a lot of very cheesy animation and childish music that is embarrassing to an older child. My son is eleven, and although he's pretty young for his age he was way too old for this DVD.

The sound quality is also very poor, during the songs, it's difficult to hear the words (which are awfully high pitched) over the music. When the animated dog is speaking, because you can't follow any lips moving, it's even harder to decipher what's being said. It's often difficult to understand what's going on, but you are encouraged to learn the voacabulary anyway.

Also, I find it curious that they offered (food? or balloons, or what not) to the female or child first, not the head of household male? Is that not the tradition? Or Guests first?

UPDATE: THE KID DECIDED that she is quite enamoured with the little teeny tiny talking dog in this video??? She loves the music!!!! OH my gosh! very cute!

I wish I'd had this DVD during those classes because, even though it was designed for kids, it covers much of the early material covered in class.

2356885,2,B000A3WH9Y,"My 4 yr old son has requested the show be turned off several times over now.  We do not care for this DVD.  Why?

--The sound varies a lot -high in the beginning, very low while everyone is talking (the important part) and average for the song(s) at the end.
--It has several true/false ""quizzes"" that take up A LOT of the video run time.  It asks things like does ?Como te llamas? mean ""How are you""?  To me, that is just confusing to kids who are just learning a language and have only heard the phrase twice.
--It doesn't hold the attention of the kids but for a minute here or there.
--I agree this was a very cheaply produced film and it shows.  I wouldn't care if it still did the job, but it's definitely not worth the money paid for it.  Maybe five dollars max.
--It shows a picture of a train with the word toy under it and says ""juguete"".  This is confusing to kids who can't read.  My son immediatly thought it meant train instead of toy.
--The phrases are said rather quickly, making it difficult to retain.

The only thing the kids seemed to respond positively to was the song ""Mis Colores Preferidos"".  They actually enjoyed it and seemed attentive.

I will leave out the other tiny flaws to avoid seeming like I'm nit-picking.  I was really disappointed and would not purchase again.  We had much better luck with Whistlefritz DVD ""Vamos a Jugar.""",1297555200,4,1362,4.396

2356898,4,B000A3WH9Y,"I'm definitely glad we bought this, and will be buying the second one in this series.  I'm a speech therapist, and agree that the techniques used for language teaching are very appropriate -- lots of repetition, pairing the same words with different contexts, speaking and singing the same words, and having different people use the same words.  Good pairing of auditory and visual strategies.

The production values are not the best, so as an adult I'm very aware that some of the acting is stiff (""Feliz cumpleanos, Carlos"" as Papa is about to fall asleep at the table).  The sound fluctuates in quality and obviously some of it was dubbed in later -- meaning that it sounds as if from a different source.  It also looks like the quality of an old camcorder that we had.

BUT -- my daughter loves it, watches it over and over, and definitely has picked up some new Spanish from the DVD.  The context is very relate-able for her and holds her attention all the way through.",1245888000,2,974,4.595375722543353
2356899,5,B000A3WH9Y,"I recently bought this DVD for my close friend's 6 and 8 year old kids.  They are just starting to introduce Spanish to their kids who are 6 and 8 years old.  They already had several Spanish learning videos and found that most were geared towards very young children and they just weren't learning the language the way they had wanted.  In the other videos, the narrator talks down to the audience, and for entertainment value, they rely on hand puppets and simple songs.  Kids are fairly sophisticated nowadays and these products did not interest the kids at all.

However, the kids enjoy watching this Spanish for Kids dvd.  I saw this in action when I was visiting them early this year.  They get a kick out of the 3D animated dog character and the songs are catchy and modern.  The music is pretty good and my husband and I and their parents even got into the music and danced around with the kids!  None of the actors have American accents which I found annoying in the other videos.  To help parents, the DVD includes a useful learning guide and offers subtitles in English/Spanish that can be turned off.  It also contains games which were a fun way for the kids to test out what they learned.  These games can be skipped for younger children.

The best part is that while the kids are watching something on TV they are essentially learning something useful.  It is great that they are beginning to use what they learned outside of the home.  They always get a big smile from Spanish speakers when they say a few words in Spanish.

Overall, I highly recommend this product.",1234224000,36,1581,4.53356890459364

Here's the bad:  I prefer Professor Parrot by far.  This DVD is much cheesier.  The guy who is the tree is annoying and does not know how to act.  I agree with the other post that says the sound is of poor quality.  I couldn't understand the words of the songs, so I had to pull out the booklet to read them.  My son can't read yet, so he doesn't have the added benefit of reading the words.

Professor Parrot is much more stylistically interesting.  The acting isn't so cheesy.  And I love the warmth of the lady who tells the story of the Three Bears to the children.  I would give this DVD a definite 5 stars.

Now for the good:  My son does enjoy this Spanish for Kids DVD.  He says he doesn't like the tree guy either, but he loves the dog.  He thinks the dog is funny and he likes the balloons too.  He was catching on to the colors because it's repetitive.  He enjoyed the ""test"" questions at the end.  He says he likes this DVD as much as Professor Parrot.

I like that I have the option to just play the video and skip the exercises because my child isn't old enough for the exercises.  My complaints are 1) sometimes the accompanying instrumental music is so loud that its hard to hear the words clearly.  2) It would help if they would put the Spanish text up on the screen (as well as the English, maybe English in smaller text).  That would help when its hard to hear the pronunciation clearly.  3) The acting is awkward. I'm not sorry I bought it and will probably buy more in the series, but I do wish that the creators of these things would look at the product a little more closely before production because it wouldn't have been much more work to make it much much better.",1138320000,104,956,4.3977272727272725

My children work through the Flip Flop Spanish workbook that I authored, and they enjoy the drawing and exercises, and listening to the CD, so I didn't know if sitting and watching a DVD would be too helpful, but it goes great with the workbook, and adds to it with reinforcement (and someone other than Mom speaking Spanish is a big plus!)

Great addition to any Spanish curriculum up to age 6 or so, I'd say.

8074159,3,B000A3WH9Y,"This DVD is ok. I appreciate the actual Latino cast. I ask like there are children in it so my daughter can relate. The activities are fun too.

HOWEVER, its not a very good INSTRUCTIONAL dvd. The younger your child the more you will need to present this dvd to your child for them to understand. Its not very easy to follow. The layout of information presented isn't very effective.",1507248000,,383,4.4714285714285715
