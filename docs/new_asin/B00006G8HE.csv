1755359,5,B00006G8HE,"I've been interested in starting to do Yoga, but was a bit shy about taking a class.  I was also concerned about the qualifications of an instructor in my area.  I bought this set for myself, and I am SO pleased !  I've just started using the first tape, but already I can tell a difference in the tension and tightness in my body.  I love it and can't wait to progress to the others.  I love the gentle, soothing music and pace and Alan Finger's voice fits right in with that mood.",1051833600,5,482,4.139784946236559
1755360,5,B00006G8HE,"I bought these tapes because I wanted to increase flexibility and strengthen and tone my body.  I found by buying these tapes I have strengthened physically, as well as mentally. I had always wanted to take a yoga class but I work the nightshift and have a toddler son, so commiting to a class schedule was difficult. I bought these tapes because of the high ratings on Amazon and great reviews by everyday people like me.  I cannot stress how wonderful these Beginner Yoga Zone dvd's are.  In one month I have increased my flexibility, strengthened my body, and I see muscle tone starting to appear.  The instruction by Alan Finger is so easy to follow, even the first time through.  There are 4 dvd's in the box set and each one is individualized and easy to follow, even if you have never done yoga before, like me.  I see improvements in flexibility and strength each time through these tapes, and that is truly rewarding. There is a spiritual quality you get from yoga that will not be understood until experiencing it yourself. Yoga reminds you how wonderful you really are and to take time for yourself, you really deserve it.  I will be buying more yoga zone tapes in the future, and I encourage you to do so too.",1049068800,20,1221,4.5227272727272725
1755361,2,B00006G8HE,"These DVD's are for people who have never ever done any yoga. They are very simplistic and they are broken into too short of segments. A 20 minute session is just not enough. Also, the poses are so simplistic it is as though you are just stretching instead of doing yoga. I feel that these tapes are too easy even for the most novice of yogis. For a better more complete introduction to yoga one might want to try Crunch yoga DVDs.",1048118400,4,431,4.2682926829268295
1755388,5,B00006G8HE,"Great for beginners!  Mr Finger slowly explains every detail of every move as you're going through the movements:  where you should feel the movements (in the muscles), and where you should be feeling the release of tension physically.

I bought this in VHS format in the early 90's through Avon and loved it, so was delighted to see it finally offered in DVD format.  I have only used the other 3 DVD's in the collection a few times, but always seem to go back to the beginning video. Just to be on the safe side, I only wish they would touch on what people should NOT be feeling through out the movements (pain, muscle cramps, etc), and how to avoid them.

Most yoga videos seem to ""jump right in"" and forget that people are unfamiliar with the movements and poses, so if you're new to yoga, this is where to start!",1346457600,,817,4.3841059602649

1755390,5,B00006G8HE,"This is a gentle way to learn some beginning Yoga poses, and to understand how to breathe, open your body, and meditate.  If you do the entire workout, it's about 55 minutes, but they have also broken it into segments if you just want to concentrate on certain poses.  Alan Finger instructs 2 of his advanced Yoga professionals, and one of them does the more modified poses, which are appropriate for the beginner or the inflexible among us.  His verbal descriptions are extremely helpful and encouraging throughout the workout.",1312416000,,528,4.910112359550562
1755391,5,B00006G8HE,"I purchased this gift for my mother and it is a great beginner's series.  They are great because you don't have to be looking at the TV to do all of the yoga positions. They give clear instructions indicating right and left, etc. so it is easy to learn the positions and not even look at the screen.  I've been doing yoga for a few years and still enjoy this series.  The conditioning and stress release is probably the best one.",1309910400,2,429,4.271604938271605

HOWEVER, the picture of quality of the content is mediocre at best.  As a result, rather than offer 4-5 stars, I can only justify 2-3 (closer to 2).",1298246400,,310,4.4035087719298245

I have had bad posture my entire life and whenever I do certain postures, my back is put into alignment and my posture is effortlessly better for 2-3 days. My husband, also a beginner, loves the DVDs as well. The yoga is slowly-paced, so may not be the best for those who prefer their Yoga at a faster tempo.",1236124800,,407,4.298701298701299

1755427,5,B00006G8HE,"Since getting this product about a month ago i can't put it down, it has changed my life for the better my posture has changed and my weight is controlled. Allan Finger is a very good host and the way in which he teaches you the poses you learn them quickly because it is slow and you are not in a rush. Also you can move at your own pace and in your own limitations. Overall this product is worth buying you won't regret it, your body will thank you later!",1224806400,,457,4.032967032967033

1755429,5,B00006G8HE,"I've only been through Yoga Zone's Introduction to Yoga and it is by far the best basic yoga instruction that I've seen. Alan Finger teaches in a simple, easy to follow manner and his team of Yoga practioners demonstrate the moves from basic to advanced. I've never seen anything like it on TV or anywhere else. Before I got this set I used to have Introduction to Yoga on VHS and I swear it kept me away from the chiropractor. I fully recommend it for anyone seeking to relax muscle tension while improving muscle tone. There's not a better way to start practicing yoga. I'm psyched on trying the other DVDs in the Premier Collection, but the ""Intro"" DVD just rules.",1209081600,,667,4.520661157024794

1755432,5,B00006G8HE,"I had started yoga using various different videos & DVD's, but I wasn't sure I was actually doing any of it the correct way. The Yoga Zone series was a new beginning that was welcomed with open arms. From the beginning, you are walked through breathing & the importance of how it is being done. The poses were taught with things to look for so that you were learning & understanding the correct way to do them. I absolutely love doing yoga with the DVD's & I can feel my body aches improving the more I do the series. I highly recommend this series!",1200787200,,549,4.288461538461538
1755433,5,B00006G8HE,"I bought these DVDs separately, so it's nice to see them together in a set. I'm going to buy them for my sister. I love these DVDs. They are the best beginner DVDs I have seen. If you are brand new to Yoga these are the place to start. Many DVDs claim to be for beginners, but offer very little instruction. Unless you are taking a Yoga class you have to rely on the instructors on the DVD to give as much instruction as possible. Most beginner DVDs fall short in this area. Doing Yoga with poor form can lead to injury. It's important to get body positioning right and not to put stress on joints or force yourself in any position. The instruction in these videos is very good and there are constant reminders to only go as far as you can go. There is also a lot of emphasis on where you should be feeling the the pose which many DVDs overlook entirely. That way you know you are doing it right and are getting the proper benefit out of the exercise.

All the videos begin with a couple of minutes of instruction on full breathing. This is vital to Yoga, so it is important to know, but once you have it down, you can stop using your hands to feel it and use that time to just focus on your breath. The ""Introduction to Yoga"" video is obviously the one to start with. It works on gently stretching different areas of the body and introduces you to several basic poses and gives a brief introduction to the beginning of a Sun Salutation. I would stick with that video until you are comfortable with it. I would then move on to the ""Conditioning and Stress Relief"" video. Here you are introduced to  additional poses and new stretching techniques. Alternate the first 2 DVDs until you feel comfortable with both, then move on to the ""Flexibility and tone"" video. That one was tough for me the first time I did it. There are new poses added and the leg work was tougher. You are holding, not straining, but my legs were quivering like jello. :-) Once you get to doing all three you are good for quite a while. The videos are very different so you can alternate them and not get bored.

Some people might get bored with the instruction over time, but I find that it constantly helps me to correct my form. Often I will hear something much later that I missed before because I was too focused on trying to hold a position and keep breathing. What he was saying just went in one ear and out the other. I also find his reminders to pay attention to certain details very helpful. I don't know how many times he reminded me to keep breathing only to realize that I was actually holding my breath while struggling with the pose. Or to check your alignment and mine was indeed off. They obviously know the bad habits that beginners are prone to doing and try to keep them conscious of good form. That's what makes these such great DVDs for beginners.

All together this is a great set for beginners and I highly recommend them to anyone just starting out in Yoga.",1198108800,3,2953,4.315315315315315
1755434,1,B00006G8HE,"I bought this product because of the glowing reviews.  I used it only once.  The pace was really slow and there was a lack of energy or enthusiasm to keep one going.  I understand this DVD set is old but the ""look"" and ""feel"" of the program were not very inspiring.  I thought I was going to fall asleep.  I would not recommend it even for beginners.",1187395200,,350,4.164179104477612
1755435,5,B00006G8HE,"I'm an athletic male in my mid-thirties.  I've worked out and played competitive sports my whole life, and did all the commensurate cross-training and attention to nutrition in order to succeed.  By most metrics, I'd be considered a very fit person.  I say *most* metrics because the introduction of yoga to my life has been very humbling, exposing weaknesses in my body that I didn't know existed.

Over the past month, I've found myself reaching for the ""Introduction to Yoga"" DVD most often since the Flexibility and the Strength DVDs are a bit too advanced for me.  I've used the Meditation DVD just once.  It's fine, but too passive for me as I need to build quite a bit of strength and flexibility first just to ""graduate"" from the first DVD!

I set aside an hour a day to do this.  I find myself actually craving to go through the yoga rountine.  The first week it made me sore and tired (as one would expect starting up any new ""work out"" routine) but during the subsequent weeks I have felt refreshed and invigorated after each routine.

I recommend this set highly for beginners.",1186358400,3,1089,4.595854922279793
1755462,5,B00006G8HE,"This is a great collection for totally new beginners.  I bought this set so that I could learn yoga with my kids.  I have 3 sons (ages 11, 12, and 13) who are active in youth football and wrestling.  I really feel that yoga can help them with injury prevention and conditioning in sports, and help all of us with general flexibility, health and well being.  We have tried a couple of other videos and this set is the best so far!  The instructor actually intructs you (imagine that!) in detail on each pose, and continually gives cues for your breathing.  It is slow enough to to follow along, and really hold the poses and feel them working.  Alan's intructions let you concentrate on breathing, so you don't have to keep watching the t.v. the whole time to make sure your doing it right.  The other people in the videos demonstrate a few variations of the poses if your not as flexible.  My kids actually enjoyed following along with these videos, and said these were so much better than the ones we were using before.  They said they really understood what they were suppose to be doing, and didn't have to struggle so much. (YEAH!!)  Which, of course, makes it much more enjoyable for me to do it with them. :o)

There are short commercials at the beginning of each video for music.  I either use those couple of minutes to get situated, or just fast forward.  No big deal. The dvd's are each broken up into two chapters. The first runs the whole class from beginning to end, which is about an hour (but it seemed to go by pretty fast).  The second chapter breaks the class down into 6 segments so you can pick and choose where you want to start, skip a section, or customize the order of your routine.  The seting of the class looks warm and inviting, which is pretty nice.  It feels natural, and is not distracting or overly vacation like. It takes place inside a huge room with hard wood floors, neutral colored stone/bricks, and neutral colored walls, with warm lightling.  This was a nice change from the last two videos which were a manicured tropical setting, and a cold, grey drop cloth setting.

I would definitely recommned this set if you are new to yoga like me.  It's also great for older kids.

I am adding to my review that I do not care for, or use the fourth dvd in this collection: Meditation, Two Complete Sessions. I watched it once. It's not my cup of tea. There is hardly any physical activity (I realize that's becuse it's meditation), so I don't use it.

However, if you find the lowest price possible for the set of 4 (like me) it's a usually a better deal to buy the set of 4 than to buy each DVD individually. And if your into mediation you may like the Meditation DVD.  I still love the this collection, just thought I'd clarify.",1185321600,2,2761,4.413043478260869
1755463,3,B00006G8HE,This is ok for beginners. But not for those with a little weight to lose. I was trying to fit this into my schedule for weight loss and toning. Trying to start a new habit. I can't do a third of the positions because the belly gets in the way.,1167868800,9,243,3.88
1755464,5,B00006G8HE,"I love this collection!  I hope I don't sound like an infomercial. I HAD a really weak back before I started these DVD's.  I used to miss days of work because my back would go out and leave me unable to walk without being hunched over and in pain.  Conditioning and Stress Relief is the best DVD of the series for alleviating back pain. I feel really great after a session of yoga and my back pain is gone.  Now I just rotate the 4 DVD's to get a variety of workouts.

I really like the instructor. He has such a soothing voice.  I really like how you can follow along with his step by step instructions without having to keep your eyes glued to the TV, which can be hard at times when you are not pointed at the TV during some poses.

I don't really have anything negative to say about these videos. I think I will reach a point where I will need a more advanced workout, since these are meant for beginners.

I highly recommend this collection to anyone who has never tried yoga before and wants to check it out!",1154736000,13,1014,4.164102564102564
1755465,5,B00006G8HE,"I bought this collection on VHS back in...well, the late 90s. At the time, I was in a serious (ie, disabling) Fibromyalgia-myofasial pain syndrome-complex.  All my life I've been active, an athlete, etc. and suddenly here I was struggling to get up the stairs of my building.

This series gave me the kind of activity I needed-- and the encouragement to let my body just go as far as it could *that day*, and not push too far.

I still use these programs in my daily routines, and although I have several other YogaZone dvds, this collection is still my favorite!

If you're looking for ""power"" yoga, however, you won't be happy with this collection.",1152835200,10,650,4.626086956521739
1755466,5,B00006G8HE,"What I would give to study with Alan Finger!!!

This set was the first dvd purchase that I made of yoga classes.  I'd taken some classes before.  I could tell it was something that could be good for me, but somehow I couldn't get into it.  There was something dead and dry about the way they taught it.  So I stopped doing that and learned about other kinds of bodywork for a while. (well, more like dabbled) But for instance I did some studying on the Feldenkrais Method which was very eye-opening. (I HIGHLY recommend it to anyone interested in bodywork.)  However, I continued to read about yoga even tho' I was not practicing it.  Erich Schiffman's Yoga the Practice of Moving Into Stillness taught me the idea and spirituality behind yoga for the first time.

Anyway, so I decided to try some yoga again a few weeks ago.  I read all these great reviews of this series and decided to go with it.  Now, everything that I thought was not quite right with how yoga was presented in other classes, Alan Finger immediately made me understand what it was.  Even tho' I'm no expert, I can just tell he's a true yogi who lives his art.  You can sense his love and dedication for what he does.  Other teachers that I'd studied with - they'd guide the class thru' the motions, but the instructions were cut and dry.  They didn't truly ""live"" the spirit behind it.  And I don't think you can practice anything without its spirit.  With Alan, everything that he says, how he says them, and what he doesn't say even - carries such truth.  I never really trusted the other teachers, but he gained mine very quickly.

He's very enthusiastic and positive in a very genuine way.  He explains each pose very throughly - THE most thorough instructions I'd ever had, much more than classes I'd taken in person ever!  I love that he makes sure that every pose is done right.  So many teachers tell you what to do, basically showing you an approximation of what you should LOOK like, instead of really giving you instructions on what to do, and then for YOU to find out how much you can do - like Alan does.  His 2 assistants who demonstrate on the videos have that air of being fully engaged in their practice as well.  I'm especially impressed with Lisa Bennetts - not because she demonstrates the ""real"" poses instead of the modified easy ones.  But again the way she does them somehow conveys that she, too, has the kind of true yogi spirit that Alan emits.  I think she teaches in nyc.  Next time I go back I definitely will try to attend some of her classes.

I can't say enough about these dvd's.  My only complaint is that there aren't more of them!

p.s.
now more than two years later (jan 09), i'd like to add some extra comments, not on the dvd's themselves but on alan finger. i attended a seminar that he gave in MA a while back and got to meet him. wow, it turns out that he's very different from how i'd imagined him to be. he was always making inapproiate sexual jokes, jewish jokes (he's jewish) in class, or making petty, embittered comments about other yogis. he also walked around kind of like a movie star or something. he's got his shades on, not really talking to people, but surrounded by an entourage of beautiful women-and i mean surrounded. every walk that i saw him take, there'd be at least 4 or 5 women literally surrounding him. i was pretty shocked and very disappointed in him. however, he did seem like a master of yoga, in that he really seemed very learned. but the spirit that i was expecting from a great teacher and yogi... maybe i was expecting too much. it's not that i was expecting him not to be flawed as a human being. but somehow the flippancy and the disrespect that he's shown was something that was hard for me to accept. he seemed more like a learned businessman rather than a teacher.

anyway, just a little note of my impression that is very different from what my review said. so here it is.",1150070400,14,3926,4.4125
1755467,5,B00006G8HE,"Alan Finger provides top quality instruction and poses are demostrated at both an advanced level and at a beginner one.  I have been using 3 of the 4 dvds regularly; I haven't tried the Meditation dvd yet.  After six weeks, using the dvds 4x a week, I am already seeing amazing results.  More toning in my arms and abs (esp triceps and lower abs, traditionally areas that atrophy easily) and incredible gains in flexibility. Really, incredible, people don't believe how much my hamstrings have stretched.  I used to barely be able to get past my knees, maybe mid-calf if I had stretched very well before hand.  Now, mid-calf is where I start when I'm cold, after these yoga dvds, I can reach to within 1cm of the floor!

I still use these three, in this DVD, the most, because as I go along, my strength accumulates and each practice is different than the last.  Alan Finger is the master of meticulous cueing, instruction, technique, breathing, everything--about yoga.  His teaching style is very friendly and personable.  You will discover that yoga is not about Madonna or pretzels, and boy, will you be glad!  Start with the ""Intro to Yoga"" in this DVD and move forward to the others (in this DVD) at your own pace.  As you progress and become stronger and more confident you will probably continue to use all three, and each time you use each one, you will become stronger, and you will continue to learn more every time you use them.

He also makes note of why each exercise is beneficial to the body and mind.

The movements are so gentle and help relieve so much stress, I really can't believe yoga is considered a form of exercise!  I have tried other yoga tapes in the past - Kathy Smith, I'm looking in your direction - that were too focussed on things like keeping a faster heart rate, but yoga shouldn't be like that.  If you can't breathe comfortably, you're not doing yoga right.  It's great for beginners and for those of us with a few extra pounds.",1060646400,2,577,4.305555555555555
1755493,1,B00006G8HE,"I was so excited try this yoga set - due to all of the very positive reviews I had read here on this site.  I am thoroughly disappointed though.  I found it to be very difficult to follow along - I knew absolutely nothing about yoga and I felt the instructor did not familiarize me enough with the basics of yoga before beginning.  I have to say too, the instructors heavy accent made it very difficult to follow this as well.
I can't recommend this to anyone - I am very disappointed.",1060041600,3,485,4.25
1755494,5,B00006G8HE,"I am new to yoga, took six months class and has been practice for almost a year. I bought several different yoga tapes before (i won't name them) but they are very bery boring, kind of make you feel old when you watch it.
I was so pleasently surprised by how well this set of yoga box is made. The background is nicely layout (in Jamaca) and the instructors are both handsome and beautiful (good for your eyes). They are very very good, the instructions are clear and easy to follow, the movements are in sequences which won't bore you, the shots are clear and you always have two instructors one shows the modify one pose and one shows the one you can work towards to. It's very encourging and cheerful to follow the tape. I don't remember how many work out tapes i have bought, but this set is truly the first one that i felt that i would like to follow and practice every day !
If you are thinking about buying it, buy it ! It's worth of every penny. You will definetly learn a lot from it ! Most workout tapes are big on 'titles' to lure you buy it but with poor quality, but this one you can defintely tell there is a group of very intelligent and caring team that work very hard and have it thought out for helping we Yoga lovers. Thank you Yoga Zone !",1054771200,18,1258,4.159836065573771
1755495,5,B00006G8HE,"In my late 40s, I was terribly out-of-shape and had already taken two months of yoga classes. I realized I needed to do yoga more than once a week to improve my aching body so I asked for this DVD set for Christmas. I started with the Intro to Yoga and worked my way through, saving the meditation one until last. Each CD was very do-able and varied enough so that I didn't get bored. My favorite one is the Conditioning and Stress Release (teal cover). I didn't think I would benefit from it because I don't consider myself stressed, but it helps relieve muscle stress, too, which I suffer from because of long hours at the computer. It has really great neck/shoulder workouts. I'd definitely recommend this set, and I was happy to hear that my yoga teacher thought highly of it, too.",1054684800,14,785,4.458333333333333
1755496,5,B00006G8HE,"I started doing Yoga 3 years ago but I had to stop due to personal matters. I gained a lot of flexibility and inner peace in a short time. Now I live in Japan and I had NO idea where to take Yoga lessons so I decided to go with a DVD. I'm skeptical about getting ""workout"" videos because many of them are just phoney. But after reading the reviews of this pack, I knew I couldn't go wrong...and I didnt.
The asanas (poses) are definitely for begginers but they have their challenges and honestly, they aren't very different than the asanas I was practicing before. The instructions are VERY clear, the instructor is great, he has a very ""peaceful voice"" and urges you to give your possible maximum. Another good thing about this series, is that they have 2 other YOga instructors who will perform the asanas, one in the way if you are more flexible and another in a modified way for those who are less flexible..and the great thing about it, they don't have an idiotic smile attached to their faces like many other models in other workout videos have. All of them look very peaceful and concentrated.
My reccomendation is, if you'll do it by yourself, to get a full length mirror so you can see yourself and prevent from doing the pose in a wrong way, also, if you'd like, get a cd with Yoga or Meditation music.
After the session, you will feel, serene, relaxed, at first a bit drowsy but then you'll feel a rush of energy come to you and in a short while, you will gain more flexibility and you'll be more in tune and in peace with the world around you.
Go for it! Namaste!",1052784000,13,1575,4.342372881355932
