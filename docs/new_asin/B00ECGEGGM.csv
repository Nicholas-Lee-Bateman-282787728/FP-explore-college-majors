5902547,5,B00ECGEGGM,I would buy this if you don't have any of the seasons and because burn notice is so good with the action and drama,1379289600,8,114,3.7916666666666665
5902548,5,B00ECGEGGM,"Bullets are boring. You see bullets on every television show these days. Anybody can win a fight with bullets. Beating your enemy with duct tape however, that's a move only Michael Weston can accomplish. Who is Michael Weston you ask? Well, he used to be a spy, until they burned him. After losing his job, his money, and all his resources, and being stranded in Miami, Michael Weston has vowed to use his skills as a spy to help those in need, as well as to bring down the evil, quasi government agency responsible for destroying his life. Helping Michael along his journey is his sexy, gun running, on again off again girlfriend, and former bomb maker for the IRA, Fiona Glenanne. There's also Michael's best friend, a former Navy Seal named Sam Axe. Eventually they are also joined by another burned spy named Jesse Porter. In addition to the main team, there is also Michael's neurotic (and surprisingly badass) elderly mother, a metrosexual money launderer named Berry, and Michael's screw up brother Nate.

In addition to a fantastic cast, Burn Notice has become famous for its very unique MacGuyver like fight sequences. Whether they're making a rocket launcher out of a pipe and soda cans, a claymore mine out of a microwave and some silverware, or a tracking/listening device out of a tiny pink cell phone, there's just something immensely satisfying about watching Mikey and his crew deal with their enemies via a combination of making weapons out of household objects, advanced special forces hand to hand combat, and general cleverness. More than anything else our heroes outfox their enemies into destroying themselves.

Burn Notice is a great show to just sit back and enjoy the fun fight scenes, the funny moments, and the touching ones as well. And all seven seasons for just a touch over 100$ is an absolute bargain. I highly recommend both this box set and this series.",1379116800,143,1887,4.8390092879256965
5902549,5,B00ECGEGGM,"No thanks to Netflix, I had to buy the whole series on dvd. One of my favorite shows though, so worth it. Nice case for containment, wish it came with The Fall of Sam Axe though....although there is a spot in the case for it so thats a plus. Not bad for the price, but I could have easily binged it on Netflix, again...thanks for nothing Netflix lol. Everything seems in place tho, which is fortunate for me since others weren't so fortunate.",1525737600,3,442,4.337349397590361

5902564,5,B00ECGEGGM,"I love the spy genre. I grew up with James Bond and Mission: Impossible (the original TV series), and while both got pretty outlandish, I preferred M:I more because they seemed more, well, spyish. The end of an episode had them fading into the woodwork, and no one knowing their real names. Burn Notice was a return to that style. It also brought a team dynamic, along with the fact that they were friends and family. Now, I had only ever saw the first two and a half seasons while it was being initially broadcast, so I missed quite a bit. Anyways, I bought the Complete Series to catch up on the eventual fates of them all. WOW! I really wasn't expecting it to go in the direction that it did, it wasn't boring, and with enough hooks to keep me satisfied! Awesome!",1514505600,7,766,4.363636363636363

5902586,5,B00ECGEGGM,"This was a *WONDERFUL* series, and could still be profitably continued --- but only by the same cast.  The one truly bad creative choice made was to telescope the big ""cleanup"" operation into one episode:  they should have strung it out.  And the only poor acting was in the final half-seaon, when everyone knew it was over and sometimes couldn't find the energy to do more than phone in their parts.

But the casting was perfect even with the minor characters, the interpersonal chemistry was superb, and the ""Thousand And One Nights""-style weaving of the plots in and around one another was highly engaging.  Like Jeffrey Wright, Jeffrey Donovan is a strangely under-rated actor.

I *really* wish they'd bring Burn Notice back for another 7 or 10 or 25 seasons.  It was truly superb.  Heaven knows that there is an endless supply of psychopaths, many in high places, that constantly scheme to do us harm, so the team wouldn't lack for work.",1499731200,,942,4.771604938271605

5902601,5,B00ECGEGGM,"Only knowing Bruce Campbell, the remainder of the cast were new and it took a while to get used to them.  What I found disheartening was the blatant violation of CIA protocols in spying and operating on American soil (if you believe the CIA operational guidelines to begin with).  The reoccurring theme of executive betrayal got old by season five, and by season seven we were saddened by the loss of one of the major characters but gladdened at the final end result.",1492473600,,467,4.614457831325301

5902625,5,B00ECGEGGM,"This is how television should be. It is fun, it is fast, it is flashy, like driving a Ferrari on Canaan listening to Bob Welch. It dragged the season that the character Jesse was added. Things went down hill when they blew up the Charger that Michael drove, but it still is a production that you can watch to knowing every line and still enjoy it.
The problem was the last season as it became darker and lost the fun. Killing off characters and breaking continuity of trust betrayed, betrayed not only the characters, but the audience too.
The first three seasons are very good. The last three burn out as where the writers originally found ways to keep people alive, and then switched to find ways to have them die.
Star Trek had the same malady in being good in 3 television seasons, but in movies had to start killing characters.",1477958400,,832,4.480263157894737

5902644,5,B00ECGEGGM,Fantastic packaging and delivery. Wonderful seriers. I'm kind of a nerd. I have watched the season in its entirety multiple times. The box set doesn't have some of the scenes shown on t.v. I noticed each deleted scene. But I got it at a great price and my son and I watch it over and over still. We love it. Keep it on your list and watch the price changes. I got it for $50 before Christmas. It was a one day special. But I want to buy another for a gift and I watch the price fluctuate.

Unlike ""The Sopranos"" & ""Friends"" dvd sets that are very different than just buying each season separately...they are artfully crafted and beautiful in book like presentations without plastic cases!

It is just that after about the 4th season we got a bit tired of it.  It is TV and that does happen.  Some of it for us was that we were pretty used to the cast that started the show and then they introduced a new character and the chemistry did not seem to be there.  Jeffery Donovan had been kind of the lead and the new guy kind of was written to take that over.

5902684,5,B00ECGEGGM,"Great show. My only comment about it is how accurate they were on the ""spy"" stuff they were doing. I'm a telecommunications engineer by trade and grew up reading things like The Poor Man's James Bond, The Anarchist Cookbook, 2600 (when it was still good), and other random things of that nature. They took a couple liberties with some of the computer hacking and left out details that explained how to do really dangerous stuff for liability (and moral responsibility) reasons but they legitimately got every detail possible right on this show. As the series grew you could tell they got sponsored by Hyundai and Microsoft but after a couple ""seems like a commercial"" scenes, you quickly get past it. [When Fiona gets her new Hyundai Genesis it sounds like Michael is reading a sales brochure.  But I digress...]

As far as the box set, it does NOT come with the Fall of Sam Ax (which is in the $5 ballpark as of this review).  The Box set is all 7 seasons sold together in a Burn Notice Slip-Box, the way it should be.",1439164800,18,1019,4.5271739130434785

5902712,4,B00ECGEGGM,"As a self-described USA Network addict, I automatically start watching any new show they put on the air.  The last time I didn't do that was with Burn Notice.  Once I started hearing such raves for it, I tuned in to the season one reruns just before season two started and Ive been hooked ever since.

The series revolved around Michael Westen (Jeffrey Donovan).  He used to be a spy until he got a phone call in the middle of an operation.  Suddenly, he had to get out on his own, something he just barely managed to do.  Next thing he knows, hes been dumped in Miami.  For better or worse, its his home town, which means having to deal with his chain smoking mother Madeline (Sharon Gless), a woman he doesnt necessarily get along with all that well with.  The only people who are still talking to him are his ex-girlfriend Fiona Glenanne (Gabrielle Anwar), a gun runner for the NRA, and Sam Axe (Bruce Campbell), an ex-Navy Seal who also happens to be reporting on Michael to the feds.

With no job history that he can report, Michael has to start earning money however he can, so he reluctantly takes jobs to help those in need.  He takes on your average problems if your average problems happen to be drug runners or gun smugglers or kidnappers or gang members or extortionists or any other number of things.  Along the way, he meets Jesse Porter (Coby Bell), a man in a situation much like his own.  Meanwhile, he also is trying to figure out who burned him and why so he can go back to work for the CIA.  However, that conspiracy may be much more complicated than he ever expected.

For the most part, the episodes followed a pattern.  Two-thirds would be devoted to the case of the week while one-third would be devoted to the latest development in Michael trying to clear his name from the burn notice.  Of course, that formula wasn't always true (mid-season and season finales, for example, were almost always burn notice exclusive).  The two plot lines would overlap each other as the episode progressed.  This meant that there was something for the casual or new viewer in every episode, although you obviously wouldnt follow everything that was happening.  They got away from this in the last season, but it held true for most of the shows run.

This show was something you didn't find much on TV, or at least I didn't  pure action and adventure.  Every episode had stunts and chases and explosions.  Okay, so they might be on a smaller scale than youd find in the movies, but I often felt like I was watching an action movie as I watched an episode.  Occasionally, the low budget would come into play, but most of the time Id believe what I was seeing, too.  While you knew the good guys would win in the end, the odds were often so overwhelming I was left wondering exactly how that would happen.

Of course, when I think about action, I tend to think the characters will be shallow.  Thats not the case here at all.  Granted, there is more time with a TV show to develop characters, but I felt all of the main characters were great.  Even a few of the recurring characters got some development, which made me love them, too.  The main actors were great at bringing their characters to live every week.  I never found a poor performance in the bunch.

And I cant leave out the humor.  Despite the high stakes and the action, this show mixed in a liberal dose of dry wit, either in Michaels voiceover narration or in the banter between the regulars.  No, it wasn't a comedy, but it did help lighten the mood, and I often laughed at a line or exchange.

While they did occasionally leave Miami in the later seasons, most of the episodes were set and filmed in Miami.  The gorgeous weather and tropical feel certainly helped give this an escapist feel that I enjoyed.

Unfortunately, the show did have its flaws.  The first was the on-going story of Michaels burn notice.  Somewhere around season 3 or 4, it got pretty convoluted and hard to follow.  It even seemed like what happened one week contradicted what happened in a previous episode, but maybe that was just me.  Either way, I just gave up trying to follow that storyline too closely and just enjoyed the case of the week.  Eventually, they did get the burn notice back under control and it started making sense again.

The other flaw was probably more personal, but I found it got darker in tone in the second half of season six through the end of the series.  For a show that dealt with some pretty hardened criminals each week, the show had managed to stay light up until then.  However, as the odds went from overwhelming to staggering, I didn't enjoy it quite as much.  I did like how the series ended, on the other hand, and I definitely plan to watch and enjoy it again.

The show lasted for seven seasons on the USA Network, and each season had roughly sixteen episodes (some had more and a couple had less).  This set combines all the previous released, so you get 111 episodes of the show.  Extras include a very few commentaries, deleted scenes, bloopers, and a few featurettes on the stunts and other behind the scenes fun of the show.  There is nothing new if you've been collecting the series all the way along.  The only thing you are missing is the Sam Axe prequel movie which was filmed, aired, and released separately.

Despite the flaws, I really did enjoy Burn Notice.  If you are looking for some fun action with great characters, you will find you enjoy the series as well.  Fans new and old will enjoy being able to watch these episodes whenever they feel like it thanks to this complete series set.",1434240000,21,5594,4.480712166172107

I don't quite understand why it costs more to buy the complete series when there's no special packaging or even something as simple as an extra disc full of special features, which would make buying ""The Complete Series"" worth it.

5902722,5,B00ECGEGGM,"It's rare for a series to start with a good premise and maintain the quality and momentum throughout its existence, but this one did.  The story of Michael Westen, a spy who suddenly discovers he's out of a job and summarily returned to Miami, trying to discover who ruined his career while staying one step ahead (or staying out from behind the eight ball) of whoever is after him.  Plus, there's the contrast of being in beautiful south Florida surrounded by beautiful women while he's trying desperately (at first) to get out rather than deal with his volatile relationship with his ex-girlfriend (appropriate since she loves guns and explosives)  and his strained relationship with his mother. Also, the show brought back the private investigator device by having him help people in trouble with his spy skills (bordering on ""McGyver"" territory) while uncovering who ruined him. That little device falls away in later seasons as the consequences of his effort to get back in the spy game catch up to him, but the series stays interesting with true camaraderie, stunning twists, and more instances of people saying ""Trust me"" than you can shake a stick of TNT at (which you really shouldn't do since it might leak on you).",1429488000,14,1225,4.8798076923076925

5902759,4,B00ECGEGGM,"My wife and I fell in love with Michael and Fi and Sam and Maddie right from the get go. Michael's original story arc--having to do with him being booted out of the CIA (burned) and dumped in Miami--was interesting, but not the driving force of the first few seasons. The real fun came when Michael and his sidekicks took on jobs helping ""clients"" who were in deep s**t of various types. They dealt with all manner of bad guys in ingenious ways, all in the bright sunny environs of Miami (delightful to see on a cold winter night). All through the seasons Michael also provides voice-over tips on how to be a secret agent; fascinating stuff. There was violence and lots of suspense, but the proceedings never got that grim; and we appreciated that. However, by season six things had darkened considerably, after the resolution of the ""burn notice."" Lots of set-piece gun battles and explosions and high body count. Key characters die. And while the proceedings still proceeded in warm, colorful climes, the mood became largely bleak; the show started to take itself very, very seriously; which I tend to view as breaking faith with the original outlook. And while YMMV, this took much of the pleasure out of Burn Notice for my wife and myself. In fact, she said, ""No more"" and skipped all of S6 and most of S7; though she did watch the last two episodes with me. I plan to sell S 6 & 7, in fact; but keep the rest. No desire to see S 6-7 again.  If you'd ask me to rate S 1-5, I would give the show 5 stars; 4 stars reflects our disappointment in what the show became at the end. Re. the top negative reviewer's comments on the look of the show... They shot the first seasons in a small, grainy film format. And I agree, it simply could've looked a lot better on 35mm or HD digital. Stupid and cheap of them to shoot it on that stock. I never understand such frugality, considering all the other production costs.",1418947200,2,1913,4.434659090909091

5902809,5,B00ECGEGGM,"I wish I could give Burn Notice ten stars.  As far as Im concerned, this is the best TV show ever made. (American anyway).  Kudos to Matt Nix for creating and writing an action adventure series that is also unique, complex, clever, funny, witty, humanistic, tender, and oh, so romantic. The charismatic Jeffery Donovan is perfection in his role as a disenfranchised CIA spy; fearless, tough as nails, yet kind, and loving.  Gabrielle Anwar is perfection as the fiery Irish demolitions expert who, even as she blows up buildings and shoots at bad guys, dreams of settling down to a quietly normal life with the man she loves. The always Groovy Bruce Campbell as the wise cracking, Navy Seal side kick is perfection.  The choice of the always beautiful and talented Sharon Gless as a self-centered hypochondriac, sixty-something woman who manages to evolve as a character as she and her son struggle to achieve some sort of reconciliation, was absolutely perfect.  The introduction of Coby Bell as a fifth character who is both funny and capable couldn't have been better.  Its impossible for me to envision anyone else in any of these roles. Unless some mild swearing bothers you (never the nasty four letter words so prevalent on TV today) this is a show you can enjoy with your children and grandchildren as I have and plan to do again.

Wonderful to see so many fine actors featured over the course of their run, as well, and the core cast had a great chemistry.  They never took themselves too seriously. Lots of little inside jokes.  These guys embraced their work and knew how to give a quality ride to the audience.  Some really nice bits of acting, directing, and production through out the seasons. Good story lines.

The first 3 seasons of this show are more on the light/comic side, from season 4 till the last one the tone is a little more ""dark"" as the plot thickens in an umbrella of interesting characters that force Michael to use his skills to the max.  The characters are likable and from time to time they have interesting characters playing villains.  I bought this on sale here at Amazon, saved a ton of money and love the quality of the product.  This is how ""Complete Series"" should be packed and send to customers.  Thank you Amazon!",1399248000,15,633,4.367521367521367

5902881,5,B00ECGEGGM,"Burn Notice : Complete Series set arrived in excellent condition and as a complete ""library"" of DVDs. Priced very reasonable.",1397779200,,125,5.3
5902882,5,B00ECGEGGM,"Burn Notice is a fantastic series for anyone who enjoys good action, intelligent plots, and just a side of comedy. The main character, Michael Weston, is very much a ""James Bond meets MacGuyver"" kind of guy, being a down-and-out former spy who manages to improvise just about anything into a solution to his problems.  The chemistry between the cast is excellent, the writing is always entertaining, and there are plenty of explosions to go around.

But there are plenty of reviews out there about this show; I wanted to discuss the Complete Series box set in a little bit of detail for anyone considering it.  I have to say that out of several other box sets I have seen and owned, this one is very well done.  When you first see the long rectangular form of the box, you might be afraid that they went with the typical method of making a ""book"" of the series with all of the discs held in cardboard sleeves, which is frankly a terrible way to store DVDs.  However, this is not the case with Burn Notice; instead, the cover of the box slides off to reveal a sturdy, top-loading box, containing separate plastic DVD cases for each season (they appear to be the same cases as if you had purchased the seasons separately).  This makes storage and use of the discs much easier and safer than most other box sets, and I appreciate that they didn't just go for the cheapest packaging option.

The DVD cases are stored in two rows, four in one side, and three in the other, with a cardboard spacer filling the gap.  The good news is that if you remove the spacer, you have enough space to store an eighth DVD - making the perfect place to put your copy of ""Burn Notice:  The Fall of Sam Axe"", which is a nice touch to round out the collection.  The bad news is that the box clearly wasn't intended for this purpose, as the spacer is glued in place, and it takes a bit of work to remove it without damaging the rest of the box.  Still, it's really a minor oversight in what is otherwise a great show in a solid box set.",1397260800,62,2012,4.338666666666667
5902883,5,B00ECGEGGM,"Smart, witty, sexy. Jeffrey Donovan is chameleon-like in his ability to change his persona to suit the adventure at hand. Bruce Campbell is remarkably charming as an aging Miami boy toy with special mercenary skills. Gabrielle Anwar is deadly attractive in more ways than one. And Sharon Gless adds that certain spice to the series as everyone's Mom.

This is a sophisticated and clever series that doesn't disappoint.",1397174400,,418,5.147058823529412
5902884,5,B00ECGEGGM,"If you are thinking of buying this Series it is most likely because you like the show.  So I am just reviewing the packaging.  They get 5 stars for the way they packaged this Series.  Each season is packaged in the traditional plastic DVD cases.  Inside each case are on average 3 or 4 discs that snap into the disc holder like most DVD movies do. All the seasons are inside a sturdy glossed box that holds the cases and a sleeve that slides over the box keeping the cases inside the box.
  I have refused to purchase some multi disc series in the past because of cheap packaging that ends up damaging the discs. like the cardboard sleeves do.  I am so glad they did not go the cardboard sleeve route that a few other companies have done just to save a buck.",1397174400,5,758,4.222222222222222

5902886,4,B00ECGEGGM,"I love this show and I am very excited that I was able to get all of the seasons in one set.  The package is well made if a bit large.  The only issue that prevents this item from being given 5 stars, is the fact that this show is only available in DVD,which is the fault of the distributor, and the fact that if this is supposed to be the complete series, where is the TV movie The Fall of Sam Axe.  Otherwise I plan to spend some of my vacation time watching my favorite episodes from one of my favorite shows.",1396483200,2,512,3.9514563106796117

5902890,5,B00ECGEGGM,"I bought this for my boyfriend for our first Christmas. His eyes lit up like a kid in the candy store. Full series, great series, interesting, entertaining, and reasonably family friendly.
I will say the packaging was disappointing, we actually ripped the paper cover on a case trying to get the DVD case open because it seemed like they had put a seal all over the case, including the paper. Normally there's a plastic protection over the paper, and then a plastic seal that you have to take off. It was only on the first season and I had preordered it, so hopefully the quality control has gotten better since then.",1395705600,3,617,4.5675675675675675

If you love the constant twists in plots and falling in love with Michael Westen and his friends and family this series is awesome. I am currently starting the 7th and last season and am looking forward to closure and seeing if they all get what they have been searching for. A very well done show. Now one of my favorites.",1392249600,2,496,4.4021739130434785
5902905,5,B00ECGEGGM,"For dedicated fans or just action/intrigue lovers this is a set to treasure.  Each season contains four discs with titles.  Added bonus:  Each of the 28 discs has clips of episodes with the actors commenting on them, and discussing the scenes among themselves.  Great enhancement to viewing pleasure.  You get a sense of the cast outside of their characters.  Simple to locate any particular episode, wide screen format.  Great gift and a must have for those who enjoyed the series.

This series was one of the very best ever, original, on the edge of your seat TV. Real characters that you want to get to know and love or love to hate. I disagree with the review about the extras for this particular deal. Excellent value allows greater ownability and although the extras would be nice, it doesn't detract one bit from the excellence of this boxed set.

have missed one. What a great cast that worked so well together. When I watched the last show I teared up..
 I became very fond of the chemistry between Michael and Fiona so the final show  made me smile.

Thank you for making a great series. My compliments for Matt Nix and his exciting story line and also
to Jeffrey Donovan for his directing also.

My best to Michael, Fiona, Sam, Jesse and Madeline on any other projects that they may encounter. Also,
congratulation to Micheal and his new baby.

I will miss all of you!

5902925,5,B00ECGEGGM,"My rating is for the show and not this new all-in-one package.
Burn Notice will probably go down as my favorite show on TV not needing a premium pay channel.  It started off in season one being something just a bit different from everything else.  Was it the cast? the location? the extras?  It was a perfect storm of all coming together at just the right time.  I own seasons 1 - 6 already and have pre-ordered season 7.  They must have cost me in total about, (quick math) $150 - $160 in total.  To get all seasons for about $100 is a great deal.  This is providing they follow the same quality standards that they have with all previous seasons.",1380844800,3,648,4.305785123966942
5902926,5,B00ECGEGGM,"I loved the Burn Notice T.V. series. It kind of reminded me of the old 1980s A-Team T.V. series with a spy twist. That is probably why I like it so much :) The typical episode dealt with spy type activities but the major objective was for Michael Westen to clear his name (with the help of his team) after being discredited by the CIA. There are occasional voice overs by Westen giving advice regarding tactics and equipment which give more insight into what the whole team is doing or thinking. I won't spoil anything but I thought the series finale was well done, like the rest of the series.",1379289600,22,594,4.409090909090909

8603801,5,B00ECGEGGM,"Amazing show!! The action is HOT in Miami!!

If you're considering purchasing this box set then I assume you already know and love this show, so my review is more about the actual set. I was very happy when I opened the box. Each season has it's own dvd case with information about the season on the back. The box itself is really pretty on the inside and has the picture of the 5 main characters walking on the outside (the same image Amazon has for the product). I watched the first three seasons so far and the quality is great, even though it's not blu-ray. I was pleased with the video and sound; both seemed to be as good as it gets in DVD. While I was watching I forgot I was watching a DVD because it looked great!

I was really on the fence about spending the money to own this set, but I'm really glad I did. This is an amazing show and this box set doesn't disappoint either.

There's two things that I'd like to mention as possible cons, but neither felt bad enough to lose a star. The first is that The Fall of Sam Axe is not included (I bought it on blu-ray for only $8, so NBD) and the second is that the set is wide, making for awkward placement with your other DVDs/Blu-rays/Box sets. Instead of setting up the DVDs to be in one stack, the box splits them into two stacks next to each other. Depending on how you store your movies and shows it might be hard to find a place for this set, but I don't think that makes the set not worth having!! :)

Overall: If you love this show, don't be turned off by the lack of blu-ray and the long box set. For me, the joy of this awesome show far outweighs these small cosmetic factors.",1530057600,,1642,4.121875

The dents on the cover box are no big deal however it made me look alil closer so when I pulled the dvd cases outta the box plastic pieces were falling out, upon looking closely season 5-7 cases are slightly broken.

It was exhausting but we were riveted the whole time.  When we first started this series i wondered how you could get 7 whole seasons of them doing the same thing every episode, but we were both captivated the whole time.  There are some series out there that have noticeably worse seasons as time goes on, but Burn Notice Keeps on delivering.  After watching all of them, i cannot say that there is a season of it that is worse than the others, they are all great.",1526947200,2,613,4.25
