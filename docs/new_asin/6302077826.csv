422564,5,6302077826,"I never thought I'd enjoy it as much as I did.  Katheryn Grayson and Howard Keel, sing there way into love, and also this films has the lovely dancing couple Marge and Gower Champion along with the ever funny Red Skelton, and beautiful and talented dancer Ann Miller.  The costumes and dance numbers are a feast for the eyes.  It's really a well done remake of the 1930's ""Roberta,"" musical staring Ginger Rogers and Fred Astaire.  In fact I enjoyed it much better.  I think it deserves 5 stars and stands on it's on, as a beautiful musical film of the 1950's  The vocals done my Keel and Grayson are really quite beautiful to hear.  It's well worth viewing for any fan of musicals.  It has a little of everything, drama, romance, comedy, song, dance, and a good plot as well.",1031011200,27,776,4.453900709219858
422565,4,6302077826,"I've always thought this film got a short shrift because it dared to be a remake of an Astaire-Rogers film. But, to be fair, it's a perfectly capable ""Roberta"" remake, in lush color for the first time, and there are a few notable differences in plot. The heir to the salon is a songwriter instead of a football star (which better suits the talents of Red Skelton anyway), the singing designer (Grayson) has a vocal counterpart (Keel), and the dancers-- former sweethearts in the first film-- meet for the first time here. I always thought it was strange that Astaire and Rogers' dances were presented as isolated stage duets rather than integrated into the plot of the story. In the case of Marge & Gower Champion, their dances advance their love story-- first with ""I Won't Dance,"" cleverly staged with dresser mannequins, then with the film's masterpiece, the dreamy ""Smoke Gets In Your Eyes,"" presented in an emptying cafe which magically becomes a starlit dance floor, bathed in midnight blue. It's one of the most romantic dances ever presented on film. Also nice are the Keel/Grayson challenge duet of ""You're Devastating"" and Skelton's piano cut-up of ""Go Tell Aunt Brodie.""  The only disappointment is the gaudy fashion show-- but it was just as bad in the first version of the story!!",1028073600,16,1293,4.850678733031674
422566,5,6302077826,"In this lavish re-make of the Jerome Kern musical ""Roberta"", Kathryn Grayson and Howard Keel are teamed again following their success in ""Showboat"".  In the film, Red Skelton brings his pals, Howard Keel and Gower Champion, to Paris where he has inherited joint ownership in the exclusive French high fashion clothing store previously owned by his deceased Aunt Roberta.  The joint heirs are Kathryn Grayson and Marge Champion who are concerned over the declining business of Roberta's.  To save the shop, an elaborate fashion show is planned with top models and a massive renovation.  The problem, of course, is financing the fete and this is where all of the manipulative strategies come  into play.  Ann Miller hops a flight to the City of Light when she suspects that her boyfriend, Howard, may be falling for Kathryn--and the fireworks begin.
The film is overflowing with humor, wit and top-notch musical performances.  Kathryn Grayson is at her loveliest singing YESTERDAYS and SMOKE GETS IN YOUR EYES.  Howard solos with LOVELY TO LOOK AT.  The two team up for YOU'RE DEVASTATING and the lilting TOUCH OF YOUR HAND.  Ann Miller sings and taps her way through two lively numbers and Marge and Gower Champion warble I WON'T DANCE and whirl their way through a sky full of stars in a breathtaking reprise of SMOKE GETS IN YOUR EYES.  The spectacular fashion review is, of course, the show's finale and what a finale it is with its brilliant songs and dances and a fashion parade that dazzles the eyes.  The entire cast is on hand for this all-out effort.  So, sit back and enjoy the show.  You'll be glad you did.",984268800,57,1617,4.790613718411552

422645,3,6302077826,"A remake of Roberta, while beautiful in color as opposed to the original black and white, it lacks the charm, humor and most of all Rogers and Astaire.  I'm glad I bought it - but I'm sure I won't wear this disc out as I did with Roberta.",1381449600,,238,3.9583333333333335
422646,4,6302077826,"Keel's near  basso cantante voice seems too strong for the slight songs, while Kathryn Grayson can modulate hers to sing beautifully the pretty songs. This is a story of redemption (Keel's) through love, passing through a crisis and so the plot has a strong central narrative. I do find the Red Skelton contribution unnecessary and even irritating - and fast forward to eliminate a byway to a strong central plot. I try to ignore him in the finale as it is a most sumptuous, dazzling mix of sight and sound and motion that is unforgettable..",1379203200,,541,4.6947368421052635
422647,5,6302077826,"This musical has the best of singing and dancing.  Marge and Gower Champion have always been favorites, and they provide both a gorgeous slow dance and a clever, cute fast number.  Kathryn Grayson and Howard Keel offer beautiful singing to well written songs, such as ""Smoke Gets in Your Eyes.""  A truly great movie.",1378512000,,316,4.814814814814815
422648,5,6302077826,This was one of the GREATS when I think of all the musical movies from the 1950's and 60's.  This one is one ofmy favorites.,1377734400,,124,3.96
422649,5,6302077826,"The plot is OK, a reprise of the Roberta story done by Astaire and Rogers, combining the ""the show must go on"" motif with the ""boys meet girls"" idea.  The Jerome Kern music is wonderful, though.  From an Austrian family, Kern wrote luscious tunes that combined European sentiment with a light dose, tasteful of American pizazz.  Keel and Grayson are fantastic singers.  Ann Miller is a knockout in her one big stage number.  Marge and Gower Champion dance in a full-bodied romantic style that can give you goosebumps.  Although they are both truly superb dancers, however, Gower lacks charisma and stage presence and is only a marginal actor.  Red Skelton is often rather hard to take as a comedian, but his acting isn't bad.  There's a sweetness to him that makes you like him despite his sometimes almost Jim-Carrey-at-his-worst goofiness.  Of course, many thought -- and some still think -- he was a comic genius.  Comedy is obviously a matter of taste.  The technicolor is rich, especially in the last big fashion show number at the end, although I think the film's image could be even sharper and would like to see this movie put on Blu-ray. If you like '50s fashions, you'll absolutely love this movie.  What a bevy of formal gowns!  Where in the heck would these be worn nowadays?  The Oscars?  Actually, the fashion show is very timely as it reflects the all-important ""New Look"" being introduced at the time by Dior and Balenciaga, both of whom admitted that they had been inspired by the lesser known but brilliant Charles James. There's especially one light-blue gown that has James written all over it.  After WW II, fabric was no longer being rationed and women started to be lavished with yards and yards of silks, taffetas, organdies, etc.  This was a very romantic time.  This film was perhaps the last fashion-based musical before the grand finale, Funny Face, which showcased the more streamlined modernism of the late '50s and early '60s.  Despite the few flaws mentioned above, this movie is really a perfect storm of early-'50s dance, music, comedy and fashion.  It is a monument to the time in which it was made and should receive greater recognition.",1376006400,,2173,4.821621621621621
422650,4,6302077826,"With singing talent like Kathryn Grayson & Howard Keel, plus Ann Miller, Hollywood's best dancer, and Marge and Gower Champion dancing together, I have no problem overlooking the general weakness of the plot's premise.  And the fashions, although outlandish, are such fun to see, this is overall one fun movie.",1368057600,,310,5.2
422651,4,6302077826,"A film featuring Howard Keel, Kathryn Grayson and the glorious Ann Miller is always worth watching.  The music is wonderful, and there's a bonus extra in some of the best Gower and Marge Champion dance numbers I've seen.",1366156800,,220,4.7894736842105265

There is great singing by Howard Keel and Kathryn Grayson, great ballroom dancing by Marge and Gower Champion, and a great tap number (not two) by Ann Miller.  Red Skelton, who made more movies than I originally thought, provides great comedy.  The film also marks the film debut of the inimitable Zsa Zsa Gabor.

422653,5,6302077826,"MGM's technicolor remake of the stage play ""Roberta"" is quite the extravaganza. Helmed by Mervyn Leroy, it has an impressive line-up of greats: Kathryn Grayson, Red Skelton, Howard Keel, Marge & Gower Champion, Ann Miller, Zsa Zsa Gabor, etc. The songs are the cream of the crop here, all memorable tunes. The art direction is superior; particularly in the finale that's literally bursting at the seams with color. Being a musical, there's a tangled plot of romance as Cupid's arrows fire & misfire, with a terrific running gag involving a temperamental elevator. And for Skelton fans, Red (with Gower at piano) does a comedy routine which demonstrates why he's one of the funniest men ever.
Simply a wonderful MGM offering, and entertaining on every level!",1347321600,,757,5.064
422654,4,6302077826,"Lovely to Look At - the movie

This movie is based on a novel by Alice Duer Miller called `Gowns by Roberta', published in 1933. Otto Harbach used this as the basis for the book of a stage musical called simply `Roberta' that was put on at the New Amsterdam theatre in November of that year. Hollywood rapidly turned this into a movie, again called `Roberta' in 1935 with Astaire and Rogers in the leading roles.

For the remake of the story in colour in 1952, the story was changed somewhat, but not substantially. Rather than Astaire's football star, it was a theatre impresario (Red Skelton) who inherited the business - a Parisian haut couture house - that was being run by two sisters (Kathryn Grayson and Marge Champion), `Roberta' already having passed away by the start of the film. Skelton himself was being `managed' by Howard Keel and supported by Gower Champion: so the three set off for Paris in search of their fortune by selling the business to put on a show of their own in New York. Unfortunately, Roberta's has fallen hard times and there is nothing of value left to sell - there are only creditors. Out three heros set about modernising the fashion house with the expected financial success.

The score was written by Jerome Kern. The book and song lyrics were by Otto Harbach. The musical direction was in the very capable hands of Carmen Dragon and Saul Chaplin. And the stunning dance routines were choreographed by Hermes Pan. Ann Miller, playing Keel's original girl-friend, danced spectacularly in `I'll be hard to handle'; Grayson sang `Smoke gets in your eyes' quite beautifully; Keel and Grayson duetted on `The touch of your hand' and `You're devastating'; the Champions danced `I won't dance' and `Smoke gets in your eyes'; and the story ended with a spectacular fashion show at the re-opening of the fashion house with lovely ladies in gowns walking the catwalk while Hermes Pan choreographed the dance numbers around them. Kurt Kazner and Zsa Zsa Gabor were in supporting roles. A thoroughly enjoyable 100 min of music and dancing, even if the plot was not either gripping or convincing.",1345680000,,2119,4.8

422674,4,6302077826,"Finding a Kathryn Grayson movie on Amazon was such a bonus. Haven't seen Lovely to Look At since around 1952-3. It is great to see these old movies now made available on DVD.

422676,4,6302077826,"A remake of ""Roberta"" this film is rarely seen and has never, to my knowledge, been shown on TV.  Red Skelton does a hilarious routine with the old song ""Go Tell Aunt Rhody"", Marge and Gower Champion do two show-stopping dances.  Kathryn Grayson sings ""Smoke Gets In Your Eyes"" and ""Yesterday"".  Ann Miller is her usual gorgeous self and does some fantastic tapping.  Howard Keel is in full voice as he sings ""Lovely To Look At"" and joins Kathryn in a duet.  You even get Zsa Zsa Gabor in her first screen appearance.
This film is a awash in color, has great choreography, and a tremendous soundtrack, which includes ""Lovely to Look At,"" ""You're Devastating,"" ""Yesterdays,"" ""Opening Night,"" ""Smoke Gets in Your Eyes,"" and several other hits.  Comic genius Red Skelton stars as comedian Al Marsh, who has recently inherited half a dress shop from his aunt. Al needs the money to fund a Broadway production, so he convinces his pals Tony (Howard Keel) and Jerry (Gower Champion) to come along with him to sell his share in the salon. Arriving in Paris, the three men discover that the salon is almost bankrupt. Marsh's partners turn out to be adorable sisters, and Tony comes up with a grand plan to save the salon--turn it into a singing and dancing fashion review.
In the usual musical movie fashion everything works out and all the guys and girls get together in the end.  A great old movie that is very hard to find.
The transfer is clean and the picture is sharp and sparkling.  The sound is clear and even.",1299024000,6,1510,4.608208955223881
422677,3,6302077826,"Lovely to look at is the middle of three pairings of Howard Keel and Kathryn Grayson.  The others (Show Boat & Kiss Me Kate) are classics.  This one has a bunch of great music and a couple great dance scenes by the Champions, but the story is shody and the climactic fashion show ending leaves alot to be desired.  It does have some memorable music by Jerome Kern and great singing by Keel and Grayson, but the chemistry in the film is forced and it seems more like a patchwork of musical and comedy scenes ala Ziegfeld Follies.  At a more moderate price it would be easier to recommend, but for big fans of the leads you probably can look past its faults.",1297468800,3,656,4.308943089430894

Marge and Gower Champion were two of the best dancers ever and do at least three routines here.  Perhaps the starry set at the cafe is the best, in the central part of the film, and it ends as they calmly walk off together. The comedy of Red Skelton and Kurt Kasznar top off this wonderful movie.  Grayson said it wasn't the audiences that changed. The studios changed and began making shorter films which were not musicals, going for more bucks.  Here you get a full approximate 106min. of singing, dancing and even fashion design entertainment.

Lots of stars: Howard Keel, Kathryn Grayson, Marge and Gower Champion, Ann Miller and a hysterical Zsa Zsa Gabor not speaking a word of English. I think the remake has lost some of the pathos of the original since it's missing the subject of the Russian nobility who escaped to Europe, but it holds its own as a slightly zany musical comedy with some wonderful dance numbers.
