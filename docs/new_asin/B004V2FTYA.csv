8442641,4,B004V2FTYA,"Actors and Actresses playing more than one character in a movie can be entertaining. Not so this one.. which tries to make you cry and ends up being a pain in the neck. Dilip Kumar plays his part really well, but I wish he had been more choosy. He plays three characters (Father & Two Sons) and does a good job at it. And thats it. But for a few good song and dance sequences, there is nothing much to rave about. Besides introducing us to the condition of (rare) hereditary blindness that afflicts two of the characters, the story writer wants us to know the cure to such a condition as well - who would want to believe it - snake bite in the eyes in a temple. The story tries hard to reach its goal, and after groping in the dark blindly for a long time, the story does manage to end itself satisfactorily (i.e. providing satisfaction to the viewer that it has ended). The music score is the only good part as always, besides Dilip Kumar. Overall a perfectly watchable movie if you are insomniac(and wish to rid yourself of the condition).",1304985600,,1041,4.343589743589743
