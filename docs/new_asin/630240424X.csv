7825722,4,630240424X,"I have seen all the Porky Movies Thanks to Netflix and I have on DVD Porky's 1, I can't believe there is no dvd Of Porky's 2 or Porky's 3, I would have to buy the vhs or the Ultimate Collection(All 3) on Dvd, I give the First one 5 stars, the 2nd 4 stars and the 3rd installment 3 stars. Porky's Movies never disappoint.",1300579200,,320,3.9384615384615387
7825723,4,630240424X,"I saw this movie years ago on HBO & just recently bought it on VHS.  Porky's II is actually good, in spite of itself.  Pee-Wee & the gang are back for more adventures & more jokes.  Although I missed Porky himself, I enjoy watching this movie.  I especially enjoy the payback paid to the crooked Reverend Flavel, Commissioner Gebfart, the City Council & the KKK.  Porky's II does have a few slow moments, but nevertheless it is enjoyable to watch to get a few laughs.",1094428800,5,467,4.447058823529412
7825724,1,630240424X,"THE ABSOLUTE WORST OF THE SERIES. THIS TIME, THE GANG HAS TO FIGHT RELIGIOUS FANATICS TO DO A STAGE SHOW. NOW, I ONLY HAVE 1 QUESTION, WHY DIDN'T THEY BRING BACK PORKY?!!!!! WITHOUT HIM, THIS MOVIE WAS A TOTAL DISASTER. THE PLOT IS SENSELESS [WELL, ALL THE PLOTS FOR THE PORKY'S MOVIES WERE STUPID], THEY'RE HARDLY ANY FUNNY SCENES, AND IT'S JUST UNNECESSARY TO EVEN DO THIS SEQUEL. ABSOLOUTELY BORING AND UNFUNNY ON ALL LEVELS.",1059091200,,428,4.72
7825725,2,630240424X,"Porky's 2 starts off the day after the first one ends. At first it's funny then it goes down hill from there. If you must see this movie I'd rent it,instead of buying it. The only reason I own it is because I've got the DVD where it has Porkys/Porky's 2.",1050969600,2,254,4.0
