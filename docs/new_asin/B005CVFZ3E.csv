4654738,5,B005CVFZ3E,"This was excellent!  I enjoyed learning not only about the prophesies of Nostradamus, but the history of the man himself.  Most of his prophesies I had already heard, but learning about his personal history was new.",1353456000,,215,4.944444444444445
4654739,3,B005CVFZ3E,"So, did a 16th Century scholar correctly prophesize the end of the world, building on the Book of Revelations in the Bible?  This documentary seems to think so.  As an introduction to Nostradamus, this DVD is excellent.  I particularly appreciated the direct quotation of Nostradamus's writing instead of merely paraphrasing.  The obvious conclusion is that his quatrains could apply to all sorts of events--you're welcome to pick and choose.  Added to the problem is the fact Nostradamus ""encoded"" his writing to stay on the good side of the Church, so specifics are a little scarce.  The fact that the Mayan calendar ends in 2012 is a little startling, and other cultures apparently date ""end times"" at about now, too.  The strength of the DVD is the two experts, David Shayler and Safriel Salem, who describe the evidence for these end times.  They're very convincing.  Less compelling is the narrator, who is onscreen much of the time obviously reading his material.  While it's different, a traditional voice-over narration might have worked better.  Though I don't believe any of this, I respect others' beliefs.  I do take exception, however, at people who think they need to take action to ""help"" the end times along, like God needs a leg-up or something.  I also think that a lot of this discussion comes from the fact that we, the people, ARE destroying the planet at an alarming rate, which lends credence to Nostradamus and his followers.  I'd like to prove the man wrong, wouldn't you?",1351900800,5,1498,4.916334661354582
4654740,4,B005CVFZ3E,"Launching with a dramatic reading about Armageddon, through the advent of the Rapture, this DVD features a number of interviews with various persons talking about the use of psychic predictions and the uncanny accuracy of Nostradamus in particular. If you are interested in this sort of thing, you'll find lots of interesting stuff here.",1340496000,,337,5.2592592592592595

4654754,1,B005CVFZ3E,"I have seen a few documentaries on Nostradamus but this one was very lack luster, boring and at times annoying. The beginning was almost laughable reminiscent of a bad Twilight Zone story telling.",1447632000,,196,4.96969696969697
4654755,1,B005CVFZ3E,"This was horrible. I shut it off before I got finished. Seemed to be a lot of mumbling and nonsense. Glad it was free but it was so boring, so lacking in facts and mentioned Nostradamus rarely. It did not portray him at all. More about the talkers own garbled beliefs. Enough said.",1445040000,4,281,4.320754716981132
4654756,1,B005CVFZ3E,"Cheaply made, poor editing, 2 guys speaking amongst some random images from Nostrodamus' published works. Boring even for a documentary",1444867200,2,135,5.8

4654765,1,B005CVFZ3E,"For me this DVD is not at all what I expected. I was terribly disappointed with this production of Nostradamus ""Prophecies of the Apocalypse"". That's all I'm going to say about this DVD",1412121600,,185,4.636363636363637
4654766,1,B005CVFZ3E,Had my granddaughter over for a few days.  She was fascinated hearing about Nostradamus so I rented this for us to watch.  We never got through a half hour of it.  The worst version of this type I've ever seen.  It was a waste of money to rent it.,1395014400,6,247,3.979591836734694
4654767,1,B005CVFZ3E,Horrible seemed low budget and a. waste of money.  Discovery Channel movie was much better  Regret buying. Couldn't even watch the whole movie.,1389139200,4,143,5.173913043478261
4654768,4,B005CVFZ3E,"For those of you who don't know, Nostradamus predicted future events hundreds of years ago. This dvd details his predictions and background story.  I will definitely be rewatching this movie as there was a lot of fresh material I hadn't heard before",1370736000,,249,4.928571428571429

4654770,4,B005CVFZ3E,Nostradumus always intrigued me. For that matter anyone claiming to be able to predict the future that has any kind of success rate is pretty wild.  After watching this I can't help but think of how someone like Nostradums would be viewed in today's world. It seems we don't know as much about the way things work as we think we do.,1368835200,2,332,4.354838709677419
4654771,1,B005CVFZ3E,"I could not get into this. WASTE OF MONEY! I wish I got a refund. WORST MOVIE I HAVE EVER SEEN.

4654773,5,B005CVFZ3E,Years ago I saw a doc with Orson Welles about Nostadamus and thoroughly enjoyed it. This picks up right where that movie left off and get down to the nitty gritty on this obvious prophet.,1354492800,2,187,4.371428571428571

8465891,1,B005CVFZ3E,This was just terrible. I couldn't get through even ten minutes. It's as if a five year old just discovered special effects in a movie maker program. I suggest finding a history channel documentary on Nostradamus.,1499558400,,213,4.944444444444445
8465892,1,B005CVFZ3E,Absolute garbage,1498694400,,16,7.5
8465893,1,B005CVFZ3E,"This was one awfully horrible attempt at a documentary! I couldn't even get past the first 5 mins, it was just some annoying rambling that had little to do with the predictions of Nostradamus. Honestly not even worth the 1 star but I couldn't rate it any less...DON'T waste your time!!!",1493856000,,286,4.627450980392157
8465894,1,B005CVFZ3E,Kids with a video camera could have made a better movie. Don't waste your time.,1492905600,,79,4.333333333333333
8465895,1,B005CVFZ3E,This was horrible. Looked cheaply made. Didn't really talk much about Nostradamus and his predictions.,1484006400,,102,5.866666666666666
