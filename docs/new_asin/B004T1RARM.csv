8440400,4,B004T1RARM,"Don't Go Breaking my heart is an enjoyable movie that is sometimes a little out there in its quirkiness, but provides some genuine laughs.  Fans of British comedy and romantic comedies should check this one out for themselves.  The main reason I'm writing a review has to do not with the movie, but with the DVD itself.  We had a copy of the movie on VHS and decided to replace it with a DVD in 2013.  Unfortunately, in the first minute of the movie, there is a skip in the DVD.  This skip does not appear on the videotape, so I ordered a replacement DVD.  The replacement had a skip too.  This spot isn't crucial to the plot of the movie or anything, but it is irritating to have to see that skip while watching.  Maybe somebody's fixed it by now, but I'm guessing the DVDs haven't been reproduced since 2013 (it's 2017 now).",1500681600,,826,4.318181818181818

8440404,2,B004T1RARM,"I normally don't mind romantic comedies, but I think this one is fairly awful. The premise is fine, but the plot gets ridiculous as it progresses. I thought it would be much better considering the actors in the cast. I almost felt embarrassed for them.
I only bought a copy because part of it was filmed in the street where I used to live in Hampstead, North London - and I remember getting the filming notice through the letter box apologising for any inconveniences filming might cause for the residents.",1405728000,2,506,4.633333333333334
8440405,5,B004T1RARM,"Its has been a while since I last watched this movie as I only have it on video, but it is well worth getting.  Anthony Edwards is lovely, I would call it a fell good film. I am now waiting for it to be released in the uk. Can't wait.",1313107200,,234,3.68
