I had seen it when it aired on BBC America, but had heard that the original BBC version was so much better. I had been waiting on the edge of my seat for that version to be available in America, and it was very much worth the wait. I suggest you try it, whether you have read the book or not...it is sure to please.",1075334400,2,447,3.618556701030928
1807156,3,B00007DL9J,"Seeing the adverts for this mini-series on BBC America got me unbelievably excited.  The book, by the phenomenally talented Sarah Waters, was so visual, so visceral, and so vibrant that it practically lept off the page.  The characters were among some of the most evocatively described, fascinating fictional human beings to whom I have had the pleasure of introduction.  The story is in equal turns triumphant, steamy and tragic.  When the anticipation was finally put to rest, and the mini-series was aired, I couldn't help but feel let down.  While it was an impeccably constructed production - nice acting, visually enticing, fearlessly provocative - I couldn't help but feel that something was missing.  It simply felt thinner, less engaging.  I suppose this is to be expected, but I would recommend to anyone considering purchasing or watching this DVD, that you read the book first, and watch the mini-series as a companion piece.  You'll be glad that you did.",1073520000,13,967,5.075949367088608

1807158,5,B00007DL9J,"First of all I would like you to forget about the lesbian content in Tipping the Velvet for a minute.
As far as writing, acting and directing goes, it is an above average TV mini series (in three parts) that will truly engage you from the very start.
The attention to period detail,the sets and costumes and atmosphere is quite impressive,whereas the adventures of Nan (Rachael Streling)living in the claustrophobic Victorian age can be seen in more general terms as the struggles of a liberated and independant person trying to pursue her love of cabaret and dancing, trying to find her soulmate, and asserting her identity as a woman and a lesbian in a not so understanding environment,
Why Tipping The Velvet works so well, is because it is written and filmed in such a way that Nan's sexuality does not really matter,as much as the person herself and the total sympathy she gets from viewers.
Director Geoffrey Sax and writer Andrew Davies (based on a bestselling novel by Sarah Waters), successfully manage to tell the story of Nan both dramatically, emotionally and visually with a consistency that never lapses for a minute.
Now to the lesbian content.
I have to say that Tipping The Velvet has the most daring lesbian scenes ever filmed for the small screen.(I hope there will be no cuts for the R1 release-there are none in R2).Each of the three episodes contain Nan's sexual adventures  and expressions both graphically and passionately..her  love for Kitty (Keeley Hawes),her awakening sexual appetite and desires,her submission to a controlling woman (Anna Chancellor) who uses her younger lover as her 'sex slave' in an Victorian underground world of lesbian S&M orgies,her affair with a maid (a rather explicit scene)and eventually finding the stability,contentment and peace of mind she longed for.
Tipping The Velvet works so well on all levels, and no matter how exciting the 'lesbian' angle might be, it is at the end, the story of a free spirtied woman's journey in a world that was hostile to such manifestations of independance. A must buy!!",1071878400,,2062,4.956647398843931

1807177,3,B00007DL9J,"SPOILER ALERT

This was too explicit for me. I don't have a problem with homosexuality, especially in the framework of a love affair, but this was out of my comfort zone. Nan, our protagonist, starts out as a nice girl in a nice seaside town living with a nice family. She becomes fascinated with a show girl and follows her to London to be her assistant. From there she becomes a show girl in an act where she performs as a man. She falls into a lesbian love affair and ""finds herself."" Discovering her lover in bed with a man, she leaves and eventually becomes a prostitute. From there she is ""rescued"" by a woman of means and becomes her live-in pet. She corrupts a housemaid, is thrown out, and finds a ""normal"" woman to love. Nan returns to the stage where her first love finds her. She is faced with the decision to return to her or stay where she is.

So, the story *could* be emotional and meaningful, but it landed as tawdry to me.

The movie is filled with excellent actors. The time period is vibrant and alive due to the great costumes, sets, and settings. I don't know if it's historically accurate, but seeing lesbian love in the Victorian era was interesting. It's just not something I've ever thought about before. So, it was interesting. I just didn't get the human element I was looking for. It felt cold and disconnected. It felt like a sex story, not a love story. Watch it and judge for yourself.",1427241600,,1417,4.421455938697318

1807187,4,B00007DL9J,"I had heard of Tipping the Velvet years ago and finally decided to bite the bullet and buy the closest thing to an erotic film I will ever own.  I assumed the entire miniseries would be devoted to the stage life of these two girls, with a few classy lesbian love scenes here and there to shock the Masterpiece Theater crowd and please those with dirty minds.  I am glad to say I was entirely wrong and the ultimate miniseries was a truly beautiful study of a girl growing up, learning life's hard lessons and struggling with a sexuality not shared by the mainstream of her era.
I won't spoil much, but the journey of Nan is one shared by many girls, gay and straight alike.  She is determined and naive when we begin, and we follow her emotional (and sexual) development through a series of relationships, from her first love Kitty, to her friends (or those who she thinks are her friends), and ultimately to a level of emotional and life stability that she had to learn the hard way.  Regarding the sex displayed (as I say this is not your average Masterpiece Theater drama set in the 19th century), it ranges from tenderly erotic to brutally masochistic.  Nan's relationship with the Anna Chancellor character turns gruesomely kinky, a study in how bizarrely cruel people can be when it comes to sexual desires and what the rich can do to those who are poor and desperate for security.  But while there are parts of this miniseries that are harsh and highly erotic, the overall work is a masterpiece.
With Andrew Davis writing the script and the likes of Rachel Stirling and Keeley Hawes in the leads, this is a true masterpiece, triumphing as a study in homosexuality, gaining emotional maturity, and finding peace in your life.",1395964800,8,1731,4.62214983713355

1807195,5,B00007DL9J,"When Nancy ""Nan"" Astley (Rachael Stirling) is introduced to the world of 19th century Music Halls, she is captivated. Enchanted by male impersonator Kitty Butler (Keeley Hawes), Nan falls head over heels in love and the two women embark on a voyage of discovery that skyrockets them to success in the Music Halls of London.

When Kitty betrays her, Nan is plunged into poverty, and lured by the predatory Diana Lethaby (Anna Chancellor) into the lesbian underworld of the 1890's. Along this twisted path, Nan's zest for life does not waver nor does her quest to find true love.

Based on Sarah Waters' debut novel `Tipping the Velvet', screenwriter Andrew Davies deftly creates a compelling journey of a young girl's exploration of gender and identity. Bathed in erotic sensuality, the film delves into the previously hidden world of Victorian erotica.

Rachael Stirling is charming as the naive Nan Astley who is fiercely attracted to male impersonator Kitty Butler. Keeley Hawes on the other hand, is sexy and alluring as hesitant lesbian Kitty Butler.

1807198,4,B00007DL9J,"This daring addition to the BBC's considerable gallery of costume dramas may be an acquired taste but rewards it's viewers with an almost insanely-enjoyable tale.  The story, based on Sarah Waters' novel of the same name, follows a young woman in 1890's London and her quest for love.

Nan Astley (Rachael Stirling, who in appearance, voice and manner is the very image of her mother Diana Rigg) is a young girl who works at her family's oyster bar in Whitstable.  A evening at the local music-hall jolts Nan's world, as she witnesses male impersonator Kitty Butler (Keeley Hawes - ""The Moonstone"", ""Wives and Daughters"").  Night after night Nan returns in hopes of catching Kitty's eye - and the single red rose which Kitty tosses to a lucky girl in the audience.  Finally offered a meeting backstage with her idol, Nan lands a job as Kitty's personal assistant, and later travels on to London where she becomes part of the act.

""I hate the way you make me feel!""... When Kitty and Nan's attraction for one another can no longer be denied, their sexual affair takes off in earnest, but Nan's heart breaks when Kitty announces her plan to marry their manager.  On the streets, Nan plies her male impersonation skills by turning into a rent-boy, where she encounters Diana Letharby (Anna Chancellor), an aggressive lesbian who takes Nan under her wing as a ""paid whore"", exhibiting the girl to her circle of like-minded friends in all manner of explicit costumes.  After two years Nan emerges from Diana's employ and returns, beaten once more, to the streets where she resolves to seek out the only person who ever tried to be a genuine friend - Florence Banner (Jodhi May), who lives with her Socialist brother (Hugh Bonneville - ""Lost in Austen"", ""Downton Abbey"") in a suburb of London.  As Nan tries to cope with her ever-growing feelings toward Florence, could she ever hope to find love in return?

As long as you keep an open mind, the antics in TIPPING THE VELVET are quite tame.  Screenwriter Andrew Davies (the 1995 ""Pride and Prejudice"", ""Wives and Daughters"", ""Daniel Deronda"", 2005's ""Bleak House"" amongst others) keeps things fairly tasteful for the most part.  Rachael Stirling's performance as Nan is delightful; Keeley Hawes enchants as music-hall nymph Kitty.  Anna Chancellor (Miss Bingley in Davies' ""Pride and Prejudice"") chews the scenery as the sapphic, aptly-named Letharby; and the cast also includes a young Sally Hawkins (""Fingersmith"", 2007's ""Persuasion""), and Benedict Cumberbatch (""Sherlock"").",1332374400,3,2523,5.0215827338129495
1807199,3,B00007DL9J,"I was looking for something unique and intelligent for my wife and I to watch, and after reading so many rave reviews on this story, I took a chance. I loved the overall look of the film, but couldn't quite get behind the believability of the main character, especially in the first segment of the three-part series. And the narration by the main character was overly simplistic at times. It actually became somewhat annoying, as did the flashbacks and some of the wild camera moves that could become quite nauseating. But the single most annoying thing was probably the most petty: how long does a facial wound openly bleed? The main character, Nan, spent what seemed like an eternity with blood trickling down her face. Even after finding refuge with friends in a home that had water and a manner with which to clean-up, there was always a fresh trail of blood on her face. This admittedly petty issue, once realized, was frustrating to witness in scene-after-scene. But in spite of my grievances with this film, it was relatively enjoyable, and far different from the tripe that is typically viewed on American television. While I felt it could have been better, I still think it's worth watching. Just don't hold your expectations up too high.",1326672000,,1247,4.804651162790698

1807201,3,B00007DL9J,"Although I overall enjoyed ""Tipping the Velvet"" for its first-rate production quality with actors who excelled in their roles, I would not glorify a lesbian film where the heroine, in one scene, is slammed across the face by an angry lover and minutes afterwards is engaged in sex with another woman while the blood from her facial wound smears their faces; and in another she makes a living by cross-dressing as a male prostitute performing fellatio in alleys. Nor do I think it speaks well to have the main character weigh the scale between a return to the woman who betrayed her in the past or stay with the one who saved her from the streets and loves her. And there isn't enough space to even begin to dissect the focus bestowed on the phallus in this supposedly enlightened tale about a homosexual woman, other than to say that Sarah Waters has a case of male-envy that she needs to deal with. Too many of the lesbian characters and relationships leave much to be desired and the author's exotic fantasy of Victorian lesbian mores and escapades are, I believe, tainted with the chaos of contemporaneous debauchery.",1319155200,,1120,4.719387755102041

1807203,5,B00007DL9J,"One of the little things to which we must all accommodate ourselves is the endlessly exasperating nuisance of being forced to watch and listen to the BBC proclaiming its virtues and products at the beginning of each show it issues on disk.  Endless repetition, it seems, finally drove home the notion that a mini-series called ""Tipping the Velvet"" might possibly be worth a look.

I looked.

And I was impressed.

""Tipping the Velvet"" is a successful bit of soft-core lesbian pornography cast in the form of a soap opera set in Victorian times.  To any who would deny or debate the validity of that description, I advise that you turn to the featured joint-interview with the (female) author of the original book and the (male) author of the screenplay.  Those two are in no doubt whatsoever about the point.

The story of ""Tipping the Velvet"" focuses on a small town girl who becomes infatuated with a stage performer working in male drag.  The girl, Nan, falls deeply in love with her stage idol, joining her in a male drag double act, and a different kind of double act in private, only to receive a harsh kick in the emotional teeth.  The stunned Nan quits the act, hits rock bottom hard in various ways, unexpectedly finds herself a warm and comfortable birth as the gilded girl-toy of an older, wealthier woman, and then manages to blow that gig.  Rock bottom again.  Pondering life at the bottom of the heap, Nan backs up, seeks out a young woman to whom she had been attracted before, worms her way into that woman's household, and before you can say Bob's your uncle, she's a socialist-oriented, proto-suffragette, making a comeback on the London stage and about to give the hairy eyeball to an offered reconciliation with her first lover.

Soap opera of the soapiest sort, of course, but skillfully done.

If that were all, I'd stop at this point, give ""Tipping the Velvet"" four slightly weak stars and move on.  I am glad to say, however, that there is something more, specifically Rachel Stirling as Nan.  If ever a star turn were captured on a DVD, Ms. Stirling's Nan is it.  Just consider those scenes in which she is supposed to be a popular stage performer: she really can't sing and she doesn't move especially well--but I can't imagine that anyone would care, because you can't take your eyes away from her.  Now, that's a star!

Stirling looks great, whether her boyish form is wrapped in plain country clothes, male drag of sundry types, completely starkers, or ninety percent undressed with ... ahem, attachments.

When she is at bottom and busily engaged in the grungiest of pursuits, she somehow contrives to be both winsome and--dare I say it?--adorable.

All through the three episodes of the series, I found myself thinking that there was something oddly familiar about this performer who was otherwise unknown to me.  I was sufficiently puzzled to look her up on the Net.  She turned out to be the daughter of that delightful actress [aka ""actor"" for those among you of strong PC persuasion], Diana Rigg.  Of course!  The resemblance, once perceived, is obvious, down to body language and facial expressions.  I would even go so far as to say that she is Emma Peel's daughter more than Diana Rigg's.

(While looking up Ms. Stirling on the Net, I stumbled across an article that stated that the ""boyfriend""--their term--of Ms. Stirling at the time of ""Tipping the Velvet"" had broken up with her because he could not stand the lesbian associations from her role in the series.  On the off-chance that there might be some truth in that report, I can only shake my head in dismay and say in the words of that great philosopher, B. Bunny, ""What a maroon!"")

""Tipping the Velvet"" is a soap opera in which the heroine rises to the heights and falls to the depths with the regularity of a sine wave.  It is also the vehicle for a fine piece of star acting.  On the basis of the latter, it fully deserves five demimondaine stars.",1282003200,4,3947,4.678260869565217

Forget all the nonsense about this character was miscast because that is not the way that I visualised her/him when I read the book. Never ever, having read a book, expect to see that same book on screen. It has never happened since movies were invented and it never will. A book is a book and a film is a film. They are two different mediums and should never be compared. This film is an adaptation of a novel and should stand or fall on how well the story is told, and how believable are the characters, the actors performances, the cinamatography and whether the director achieved his goal et al. People have complained that they find Rachel Stirling's voice irritating. Well folks she is playing a Kentish working class girl with a Kentish working class accent. She isn't going to suddenly start speaking like Julie Andrews. Keeley Hawes gives a ""stilted performance"". Keeley Hawes has never given a stilted performance in her life. In the UK this DVD is not for sale to anyone 15 and under so don't settle down on the couch to watch it with your kids. It is not a family film. If you are homophobic, don't watch it. If you don't like overt sexual content lovingly enjoyed and find it distastful and disgusting, don't watch it. Watch a gory mass murder or war film depicting man's inhumanity to man instead. You know, something you find more palatable. This is a story about loving lesbian relationships, betrayal and a young girl's growth into womanhood. Forget the genesis of the film being a novel.

Mostly because of her novels' subject matter being at the opposite end of what the Victorian era would have never wanted you to see, thus forcing much of society to become like an underworld which was known about by everyone, yet was never talked about.  This film was enjoyable, but I must admit, I found the sex scenes to be a tad vulgar.  Unlike Fingersmith, which I thought handled this with a much more artistically stylized mood, Tipping the Velvet seemed to be a bit more in your face when it didn't need to be.  I understand that it deals with lesbianism, and that the crew involved with making this perhaps felt like making a bold statement... but the abrasiveness with which they filmed the sex scenes made this film feel like it went a bit too far into the realm of erotica, which I would never deem Sarah Waters's books to be.  All in all, its still a heartbreaking film. Yet I feel that Fingersmith will always outshine this film by far.

If you want to read the plot, read this and if you want other details skip down to the next paragraph. This is the unforgettable portrait of an unconventional young girl named Nan who works as a naive oyster girl, until she discovers her repressed homosexuality when she falls in love with a successful woman named Kitty who dresses as a male for her stage proffession. The young girl soon joins the act as another male impersonator and they are a major hit. Soon the both of them embark on a tender affair. Kitty eventually becomes enveloped in a marriage of convenience and ravages young Nan's heart. From then on, Nan works as male impersonated prostitute to men looking to have sex with boys, then she becomes the private sex slave to the evil and sadomasochistic Diana where Nan experiences severe emotional abuse. When that ends badly, Nan is on the streets again where she recalls a young woman named Florence; a good-hearted socialist who had the true potential of being a wonderful partner. That's where Nan will discover the power of socialism and learn how to get back to fame.
The region 1 transfer is of exceptional picture quality, there is a very good scene selction, an eloquent photo gallery and a fun interview between novelist Sara Waters and the film's writer Andrew Davies.
The sets, costumes, cinematography and music are gorgeous. The acting, writing and directing are extremely strong and filled with realism, class and originality. I loved the film and the novel. Section III in the film is much different in the film than in the novel, because section III in the novel is great written down, but isn't screen material. I will be brave and say that I love the films interpretation of it much more.
This breathtaking historical ingeniously combines drama, comedy, erotica and romance to vibrant perfection in a way that is both deeply moving and spiritually uplifting.

1807220,4,B00007DL9J,"I'm a sucker for a good romantic tale. It doesn't really matter what sort of story it is, as long as the emotions are honest, there's a good chance that I'll take it in. And controversy doesn't bother me at all either. That all said, I was very surprised at how much I enjoyed watching this adaptation of Sarah Waters' first novel, Tipping the Velvet.

Starting in a seashore town in Kent, we meet Nancy Astley (Rachael Stirling). She works in the family oyster shop, labouring away in the back, opening up oysters and finding life, well, a bit cramped. She has a steady beau, Freddie, but she doesn't feel too much in his arms. Nan doesn't quite know what she wants, she just knows that it's not going to be happening here in Whitstable. But very soon, things are going to be in an uproar, especially when her elder sister's fiance treats them all to a night at the music hall.

There on stage is the beautiful Kitty Butler (Keely Hawes), daring and luscious, dressed as a young man and singing about love. Nan is instantly smitten with a crush, unable to take her eyes from her. She's not quite sure what's happening, all she knows is that she wants a future with Kitty in it. Night after night she returns to watch, waiting for that moment when Kitty flings her rose into the audience and it lands in the lap of a young woman. But, alas, the rose never does come flying her way. At home, Nan is starting to realize that she's just not fitting in, and even her would-be suitor and sharp-eyed sister are starting to take notice.

On the last night of Kitty's appearance in the music hall, Nan finds herself the recipient of that rose, and an invitation to come and talk to Kitty in her dressing room. Why not, Kitty suggests, come to London with her to be her dresser? And Nan leaps at the chance, leaving behind her family, having already shed her boyfriend in a fit of pique.

Things are a bit awkward at first in the room that they share in the boarding house. But Kitty finds herself falling in love, not just with Kitty, but also with the theatre life. And Kitty's manager, Mr Bliss (John Bowe) encourages Nan to try for herself in dressing as a male impersonator and singing on the stage in a double bill with Kitty.

The result is, as they say, a hit. Soon the pretend kisses on stage are resulting in a fiery affair in bed as well, as Nan falls head over heels for Kitty -- that is until a visit home reveals that she simply doesn't fit in any more, and worse, her sister's firm repugnance and rejection of Nan's new lifestyle. Reeling, Nan returns to London, and finds Kitty in bed with their manager, and an impending marriage in the works. Heartbroken, Nan flees and right into the sordid underworld of prostitution in London. It's a lucrative trade, dressing as a boy, and relieving well-heeled toffs of gold soveriegns.

That is, until an encounter gone bad has the unlikeliest of rescuerers. Plucked from rape and disaster, Nan finds herself in the hands of Diana Lethaby (Anna Chancellor), wealthy aristocrat and a very dominant personality. Soon Nan is esconced in a very gilded, very dull cage, where she happily submits to any sort of desire that Diana can dream up. It's a decadent, depraved existance, and the excitement comes to a tumultuous end in a night of violence and abuse.

Back on the streets, Nan is penniless and alone. Can she possibly put her life back together and survive?

This is a strong, powerfully acted and directed drama. Director Geoffrey Sax gives the viewer a story that at times hinges on the pornographic, but never pushes it over into the realm of the tasteless. I'll admit it, I was entranced by Nan's story of survival and love. Adapted by Andrew Davies from Waters' novel, it's full of smart dialog, complex characters, and while not much is left to the viewer's imagination, there's more eroticism in this one than what you'd see in most adult fare. Call it tasteful, smart, soft-core porn if you will.

The acting from Keeley Hawes and Rachael Stirling is what really makes this film work. They're beautiful, seductive, but never quite trashy, and the backdrop of music hall life gives it a tawdry humor that you can laugh at, but not feel bad about. The rest of the cast is good as well, with Chancellor providing a real menace and danger with the character of Diana that was chilling at times.

Other good points are the details in the clothing and set design as well as the on-location shooting. Author Sarah Waters has a small cameo in the film, a rather nice touch. What I enjoyed the most about the film was that there wasn't any excuses made for the characters' sexual orientation, and that it's not there as a sordid bit of titillation for the audience. These women have embraced their lifestyle choice, and are revelling in it, at least as much as Victorian morality will let them. It's certainly is a bit freer than what there is today, without the sermonizing and damnation that the straight world provides in most films.

Yes, it's certainly not for children of any age, and I'd say that most adults would feel a bit uncomfortable with the subject matter, and especially as a sex toy plays a, ahem, prominent role in the film. But it's very tastefully done, and the sex itself is actually a smaller part of the story than you'd suspect. Rather it's the story of coming of age, and the very complicated relationships between Nan and the various people that she meets in her effort to find a home of her own.

Those who are curious may be surprised that male impersonators were a feature of music hall society, and while lesbianism wasn't accepted openly, it was far more common than most percieved notions would lead us to believe. Hawes and Stirling would work together on another BBC production, a modern day version of Othello.

The DVD has a few extras, including an interview with Sarah Waters and Andrew Davies, scene and episode selections, and a photo gallery, along with filmographies for the cast. The film itself is divided up into three episodes, and runs close to three hours in length. It also looks as though there is to be a theatrical version in 2009.

I would strongly suggest that parents be a bit wary in letting their children watch this one, as it is very adult material. The film itself is unrated, but I would give it a very hard R rating, given the topic.

The narrative had three distinct moods--first the rise of passion and loss of innocence, then the struggle for survival and lastly the birth of maturity and independence.

1807224,4,B00007DL9J,"I loved the book and though this adaption was a bit different than the source, it was still a great mini-series and definitely worth watching.

I loved Rachael Stirling--even though her voice did bother me at first--I strangely did get used to it after about 20 minutes (I don't think they even needed to affect her voice--but whatevs). I guess she should have been a bit more butch--but I thought she was great.  Keely Hawes was very good as Kitty Butler, as was Anna ""duckface"" Chancellor as Diana. Also the actress who played the maid Zena: Sally Hawkins--she was magnetic on screen--and I was thrilled to see her playing Sue in the Fingersmith adaptation. The music was a little 'eh'.

 As for the changes Davies made to the material --it worked in some regards (the end setting for example, was much better than the book) but was a little questionable in other areas. For instance--(as others have mentioned)the 'slapstick' humor in the sex scenes--which I can see adding to help offset the racy material when it aired on the BBC--but still, that humor isn't always there in the book and sort of belittles the drama a bit (though it did work in some areas). Another big change was the character of Flo--her personality is quite different in the book, but I did think the Last of the Mohicans girl cast as Flo was very good anyway.

For a BBC production, I was quite impressed by the direction/cinematography & overall talent of the cast--as well as their willingness to put something like this on the TV. Bravo BBC.

Though I will say, I think Fingersmith was probably the better book and adaption--so make sure to read/watch that one next.",1172707200,3,1645,4.694444444444445

I was highly impressed with the cinematography from the first few seconds.  The film quality, style, costumes, and all other aspects of this DVD are fantastic.  The acting is wonderful, smooth, realistic, and I became caught-up in the characters mentally rooting for them and becoming engaged in the story.

This film is full of amazing twists and turns, surprises and real life drama without melodramatic overacting. It is very difficult to express how wonderfully the characters come to life, without giving away aspects of endearing moments in the film.

However, I will add this.... This film contains many elements of intrigue and human interaction; love, betrayal, erotic scenes of steamy sensuality, and many surprising journeys one would not expect in such a tale.

I highly recommend this film.  I would give ""Tipping the Velvet"" seven stars if possible, and it is now my second favorite movie (""Dangerous Liaisons"" being the first fave).  This product is well-worth the price! This is one you will want to watch many times, and introduce to others.

While admittedly in both novel and production the characters are stereotypical and their motivations a little fuzzy, it is still a gripping adventure.  Emotionally expressive, this is a fun roller coaster ride through the ups and downs in the life of a young 1890's English lesbian- you're with Nan all the way!

The costumes are very period.  Even the men's clothing Nancy wears are in the correct styles for 1890's England.  All the locations chosen fit right in with the movie.  To top it all off, the backgrounds and sets are absolutely gorgeous!  Whoever was the set designer on this appears to be very meticulous about prop break-down and detail work; it looks like you could walk into the screen and be transported into a different time.

Aside from the rather stilted acting on the part of the lady who portrays Kitty Butler, the performances were mostly good.  Notable in particular are the lady who plays Florence and the gentleman who plays Florence's brother (this man gave an especially believable performance for a bit part).

On the whole, it's beautifully done and well worth the watching, even with its (relatively few) faults.  I would recommend this film for anyone who is a fan of historicals, love stories, and coming-of-age tales who doesn't happen to be particularly offended by the idea of several same-sex couples appearing in one piece.",1144195200,4,1416,4.932489451476793

I  have a few minor gripes, but please don't let them disuade you from seeing it. It is well worth seeing.

1 - Make up. Nan goes from oyster girl to music hall performer to homeless in this story, and yet her make up doesn't change with her social position or distress. She should be wearing none at the beginning, look glamourous at the height of her fame, and like hell when things go wrong. She looks glamourous from beginning to end.

2 - Tone. Though the novel has a lot of fun scenes and humor, over all it is more melancholy and dramatic than the series. In the book Nan's lows are very low indeed. Other reviewers have compared the series to Moulin Rouge, with its camera tricks and cute cuts. I didn't care for this. It seemed a bit pasted on, and took away some of the pathos of Nan's plight.

3 - The series is exactly one scene too long. If it were to stop at the fade out of the penultimate scene, the story would be perfectly told. The last scene changes the genre from historical fiction to outright fantasy.

But like I said, none of that stuff really matters.

Rachael Stirling was amazing as Nancy and something about her struck me as familiar (her unusual vocal quality, her bearing?).  After some Web research--she is the daughter of Diana Rigg!  Filmed as a three-part story, and made with a very British sense of humor, the film follows Nancy's journey from young woman to adult.  A good bit of Victorian music hall performance technique is revealed and the original songs are quite good.  Supporting players all give excellent performances.  I loved the sequence where Nancy is learning the new routine in Part 1.  The overlapping editing was nicely done.  Actually the only negative about this DVD for me is the fact that it was filmed in 3 parts, rather than as a continuous story.  I can see where this film would not appeal to everyone.  However, it is certainly well made.",1142294400,5,885,4.84
1807237,4,B00007DL9J,"Think Moll Flanders only in gay (and I mean that in a modern way) Victorian England.  This BBC miniseries (3 episodes) tells the story of a young woman in England who can't understand why she isn't all that interested in spooning with her sweetheart until she sees a music hall star -- a woman who dresses as a man for her act -- and develops an enormous crush.  A friendship develops, then a working relationship (she is the music hall star's dresser) and then they become sexually involved.  But life does not go smoothly, and the young woman undergoes a series of adventures, sometimes living the high life among the wealthy and sometimes with no place to sleep for the night.

I don't know how accurate this is historically, but it was quite an eye-opener for me in my ideas about the Victorians (although I'm aware that the Victorians were fond of pornography, so I know that they weren't as proper as they liked to think they were).

But be warned -- there are a number of very graphic sex scenes and the material might disturb some.",1140480000,4,1039,4.53475935828877

This movie contains the right mix of playfulness & viciousness, boldness & innocence, happiness and brooding, tension & release the musical numbers were fun and the sex scenes although short, were creative and as good as most lesbian themed movies. Many period pieces tend to be dark and cold but this was a warm movie with heart that shows, even when bad things happen. I clapped alone in my living room at the end and missed Nancy Astley/King as soon as I turned this movie off. Bravo Bellas. Long live the lesbian character in movies we need to see more of ourselves.

1807239,4,B00007DL9J,"The title of ""Tipping the Velvet"" is a euphemism, and given that this 2002 BBC production is about lesbians in Victorian England you can connect the dots on that one on your own. The story begins with Nan Astley (Rachael Stirling) wishing that Kitty Butler (Keeley Hawes), a male impersonator at the local music hall, would toss her the rose she always gives to one member of the audience at the end of her song. Nan has to keep going back until that finally happens, but that moment is the real start of ""Tipping the Velvet."" The ending comes when it is Nan who has to decide which lucky lady in the audience gets the rose.

When we first meet her, Nan is an oyster girl, working in her family's oyster bar in a coastal town. Watching Kitty dressed as a man stirs feelings in Nan and the two becomes friends, although it takes a while for those feelings to ignite. First Nan is Kitty's assistant, and when Kitty goes off to London to be a success Nan not only goes along but eventually becomes her partner, both on and off stage. But then Nan has the first of several rude awakenings that turns her story into pretty much the lesbian equivalent of Moll Flanders. If you have been looking for something different, then this three-part series would certainly fit the bill. It is certainly a captivating tale, although sometimes it veers too much towards camp or melodrama. Yet we have an affection for our heroine and certainly want her to find happiness on her own terms.

One advantage of the series is that the three parts constitute such distinct periods in the story of Nan's life. Just as we have the symmetry of receiving and giving of the symbolic rose there is a similar correspondence between the end of the first two parts, as Nan gets to be the person who walks in and then one of the people who is walked in upon. The first part focuses on Kitty and life on the music hall stage. The second has Nan starting off continuing to dress as a boy picking up older men and then becoming the plaything of the rich and decadent Diana Lethaby (Anna Chancellor), who throws revelries for her friends that includes at least one object that stands out as an example of why British television is closer to American cable than American network television. The third part brings Nan to the lower class home of Florence Banner (Jodhi May) and her Socialist brother Ralph (Hugh Bonneville). With the Banners, Nan enjoys a simple life until the prospect of returning to the stage brings up new opportunities and old memories.

It does seem strange that there was such a thriving lesbian community, both among the upper and lower classes of Victorian society, but then ""Tipping the Velvet"" is about Nan looking for love and trying to survive in the real world, and not about finding acceptance for her Sapphic love life. Indeed, although she expects to be rejected because of her lesbianism, Nan is really attacked only once, although of course this turns out to be by the one person whose love and acceptance she thought she could count on. The three-part series is based on Sarah Waters' novel, adapted by Andrew Davies (""Bridget Jones's Diary""), and directed by Geoffrey Sax, who is a bit too enamored of cutting back and forth between a pair of reaction shots as a different sort of cinematic double-take. Overall the tone tends to be cute, more than bawdy, although there are some unpleasant moments that help define the dark points in Nan's life before the requisite happy ending.",1135036800,3,3478,4.615508885298869

which was what he himself came up with.

I wish that there had been a little more sex. But, the lack of on

screen love-making, sometimes what we don't see makes it all the more erotic. But, don't misunderstand. There are pleanty of very

tender, and sensuous scenes..This one is definately a keeper.

All i can really say is that even though the storyline was followed closely to the book, and the acting was halfway decent, the main thing that turned me off was the sometimes amateurish look of how it was filmed. And i don't think the film captured the feeling of the two lovers, Nan and Kitty, as well as i hoped. But i do give props to the actress who played Nan, she played her very well. All in all it was just an OKAY movie. The sex scenes were wonderful (though a tad bit tamed compared to the book), the time era was captured pretty well, and i liked how at times there was a cute or clever twist to it. But I think it could have been much better. Highly recommend the book, i think you should read it before watching the movie. It's definitely worth reading.

1807243,4,B00007DL9J,"A three episode British television program set in 1890s Victorian England that is based on the novel by Sarah Waters.  Romantic drama. Contains nudity.

Overall plot: The program follows an English country girl, Nan Astley (a.k.a. Nan King), swept up by a female performer (male impersonator) into the 1890s English world (first in the theatre), then the plaything of a rich woman, and then, bloody and down on her luck, she runs into Florence again.

DVD Features: Contains the three episodes and special features.  The special features are: an Interview with Sarah Waters and Andrew Davies (Waters - author of the book; Davies - screenwriter of the TV series; warning: contains nudity), a photo gallery, and Cast Filmographies.

Credits: Rachel Stirling (Nan Astley; ""Freeze Frame""), Keeley Hawes (Kitty Butler; TV: Zoe on ""MI-5""), John Bowe (Walter Bliss; ""Coronation Street""), Jodhi May (Florence Banner; ""The House of Mirth""), Anna Chancellor (Diana Lethaby; ""Four Weddings and a Funeral""), Monica Dolan (Alice Astley; ""Topsy-Turvy""), Sally Hawkins (Zena Blake; ""Layer Cake""), Alexei Sayle (Charles Frobisher; ""Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade""), and Hugh Bonneville (Ralph Banner; TV: ""The Robinsons""). The director is Geoffrey Sax.

Episode: 1: The show opens up on an English seaside oyster village and an oyster house.  After quickly pointing out the relatives, the narrator (Nan) notes that ""this"" is about her, a young oyster girl (who has a boyfriend but she feels nothing much when she is with him).  The family visits the theatre, and Nan falls for a female performer (male impersonator), and is heart broken when the performer throws a rose, and she isn't the one to catch it. Nan keeps returning to watch the female performer (Kitty Butler).  She dumps her boyfriend (when he says that she would let him do her if she really cared for him) and keeps returning to watch the show.  Eventually she finally meets Kitty Butler, and just like that, Nan becomes Kitty's dresser for the season. And then Kitty gets a contract to perform in London, and asks Nan to go with her (at first Kitty sees Nan as a sister and Nan wants to be her sweetheart, though once Nan puts on male garb . . .).  Once arrived in London, Kitty strikes out at first, but eventually she succeeds.  Then Nan joins the act, and has her beautiful hair cut short.  . . . Alice, Nan's sister, doesn't like the homosexual/bisexual lifestyle.  Caution: contains nudity and female love-making (and for that matter, contains smoking).  (4.22)

Episode 2: Opens with a recap of the previous episode.  And now, the ramifications of Kitty getting caught sleeping with a man (and the man, Mr. Bliss, she plans to marry).  Nan doesn't react well and leaves.  And now Nan's off on her own, off the stage, going slightly insane, holed up in her new room for around two months.  After Mr. Bliss and Kitty finally tie the knot, Nan finally leaves her room for the first time, and then Nan decides to try to increase her meager savings by pretending to be a man.  And she starts in a new profession.  She becomes a male prostitute/street walker (luckily enough, she herself almost never had to get undressed).  She finds a better house to live in, then ""courts"" Florence, the next door neighbor.  And then, she becomes a rich woman's tart (ah well, it is still something like acting).  Caution contains smoking, attempted rape, domination, nudity (episode is very vaguely similar to the book  ""Emma's Secret World"" by Hilary James). (4.28)

Episode 3:  Another recap.  Another new start due to a bad ending.  This time she causes another woman to lose her job.  She has reached a new low, and is now in a poor house.  And her new ""friend"" runs off with their money.  She wonders the streets, blood dripping from the unsealed cuts, starving penniless  . . .  She collapses at Florence Banner's new place, ""married with child"" (actually, it's her Socialist brother, and the child is another's).  Nan decides to try to make herself indispensable, to be allowed to remain in the house.  And when she the baby stops crying in her arms, she is allowed to stay.  Shall this end badly too, maybe with Nan making an unwanted pass at Florence? I know, but I shall not tell (though there is something of going back to the beginning feel to the episode).  Caution contains brief nudity and smoking.  (4.44)

Review: I don't particularly like the odd directing style of the show, the jerky, jumping around style (though it does tend lose its annoyance factor, and this style doesn't occur throughout).  Interesting look at 1890s England.  A quality program with good acting, but then, that's what you expect from British television. The program does well making it appear to be 1890s English countryside, and then London.  A good enough, though strange little program.  There's a strange real feeling to the program, especially in the third episode.  I was actually pretty reluctant to watch this program, but I am very glad I did, now.

It is a beautifully filmed, directed and acted movie following Nan's character through different conflicts and excitements. From falling in love to dealing with struggling on her own to success, Nan has the strength and honesty to prevail and make her own path. Rachael Stirling is someone I've never seen before in a movie and was extremely impressed at how well she drew me into her portrayal of Nan. I enjoyed all the different characters and was spoiled with a cast of such talented actresses and actors, but Stirling was by far my favorite.

1807250,5,B00007DL9J,"I just finished watching ""Tipping the Velvet,"" and I am STUNNED by how magnificent it was! I cannot believe that I waited so long to see it. The only thing I regret about seeing it for the first time tonight, though, is that I'll never get to see it for the first time ever again.

I don't want to say much about the plot; however, I will say this to describe it: Set in the 1890's Victorian England, Tipping the Velvet starts with us meeting 17-year old ""Nancy Asteby,"" a sea-side bred and oyster-shucking girl in who can't understand why kissing her boyfriend makes her feel nothing. When a traveling cross-dressing vaudeville singer ""Kitty Butler"" performs in drag at a local playhouse, Nan develops a crush on her and sets off on a journey. Determined to be Kitty's ""sweetheart,"" Nan follows her and the show to the larger theaters of London. Nan cuts her hair and turns herself into a male impersonator to be a part of Butler's act, and thoroughly enjoys her new butch persona. Nan and Kitty fall in love, but problems arise. Nan's journey takes her from experiencing a plethora of ups and downs, while traveling through the circles of London's lesbian aristocrat society and sorjournes with her understanding the contentment of love.

Tipping the Velvet is based on the novel by Sarah Waters, adapted by and made into a three-part series by the BBC. The quality of the cinematography is superb, better in fact that many movies I've recently seen. The coloring is as gorgeous as the women. In a post-movie interview, Waters comments that she loves the film, but that really intense and excellent scenes were omitted from the movie that were in the novel. That means I'm going to buy the novel and read it for sure.

Go rent this movie. Buy it, in fact, because you'll want to anyway.",1109376000,7,1788,4.651898734177215
1807251,4,B00007DL9J,"Tipping the Velvet was amazing in its treatment of sex and gender issues -- these include prostitution, female to male cross dressing, a queer hedonistic elite underworld, lesbian relationships and concomitant family issues. The film also sticks a bit in at the end about the more general politics of the day (probably early 20th century in England). In the third episode, Nan seeks out Florence, a woman she had once had an incipient attraction for, when she's living in dire poverty on the streets, and has nobody else to turn to. Florence's brother is a a socialist, and along with Nan, gives a stirring speech at the end about how capitalism causes great poverty and inequality (it's said the average age of a poor person is 29, while a wealthy person on average lives till 70). As a socialist, a lesbian, and a student of history I found this, as well as the whole movie, very engrossing.

All said, however, it perhaps tries to deal with too many complex issues without really examining them in enough depth. For instance, at one point Nan is walking around in men's clothing, and besides a few odd stares, we don't really grasp what a transgendered person must have had to deal with during that time period. At one point, Nan and her girlfriend are running away from bigoted men, but phew, they so strangely and easily escape a good beating (and perhaps raping). Life for somebody like Nan, and other queer people during the period must have been a lot more gruesome than depicted in the film.

Still, despite a lack of complexity, I found this to be one of the best queer-themed films out there. If people are looking for better films on issues such as being transgendered and lesbianism, I'd recommend 'My Life in Pink,' a French film about a young boy who's certain that he's a she, and 'Fire,' an Indian lesbian relationship film banned in India because it talks about homosexuality.",1103673600,,1894,4.701807228915663

1807260,5,B00007DL9J,"I loved Sarah Waters's novel, ""Tipping the Velvet."" Director Geoffrey Sax and screenwriter Andrew Davies have captured beautifully and vividly the novel's characters, storyline and the remarkable setting of a Victorian England that few have glimpsed. I say BRAVO! I am usually skeptical about movies made from books. This one is the exception to the rule.

 Nancy Astley, (Rachael Stir), was born and raised in an English seaside resort, Whitstable, where her parents own an oyster restaurant, and Nan can shuck with the best of them. She seems perfectly content with her lot in life, loves her family and imagines that someday she will marry one of the neighborhood boys and have a family of her own. When the Astley family is invited to a perfomance at the town's music-hall, Passion, (with a capital ""P""), enters Nan's life for the first time. She sees a beautiful male impersonator perform at the hall. Not just any male impersonator...but the ever so seductive Miss Kitty Butler, (Keeley Hawes). Nan is entranced and obsessed with Kitty. She longs to meet the object of her devotion and becomes first, Kitty's friend, then her employee/dresser. Her once normal life is turned topsy-turvy, filled with passionate fantasies. The Astley family is delighted with Kitty ""the celebrity"" friend. However, Alice, Nancy's sister, and until recently her best friend, is hostile and suspicious of the relationship between her sister and the performer.

 When Kitty is offered a prime London music-hall gig through her manager, Mr. Bliss, she takes Nan with her. The two live together, sharing a room, a bed, love and sex, and eventually the stage, as Nan is successfully incorporated into Kitty's act - as another male impersonator. Our heroine loses her innocence in the big city, in more ways than one. Adventure, disillusionment and major heartbreak loom on the horizon for our Nan - until she finds herself reaching rock bottom. If you don't know what ""rock bottom,"" sometimes called ""the pits,"" is in Victorian England, you may want to reread Dickens.

 It takes years for Nancy to climb out of the pit she fell into, (or was she pushed?), and fashion a life for herself. Her attempts to earn a living wage are outrageous, fascinating and ingenious. The folks she meets along the way are absolute originals. The take on London's local color, sexual and socialist politics, and social and sexual mores are delicious.

 This is one of the best BBC mini-series that I have seen. The characters are extremely well cast, really three-dimensional. The acting is superb. The lesbian love scenes are extremely erotic and tasteful. But don't shy away from this series, or be drawn to it, because of the lesbian content. This film is much more than a story about women who prefer women. I can't recommend it highly enough. And be sure to read the book too! ENJOY!!

1807261,5,B00007DL9J,"""A Sort Of Pride & Prejudice With ""Naughty Bits""..."" so says Andrew Davies, the screenwriter of ""Tipping The Velvet"", whilst adapting Sarah Walter's debut novel as he describes the smashing success of the BBC made for TV series.

 ""But I didn't want to be her sister, I wanted to be her sweetheart!"" so says Nan Astley, played beautifully & naively sweet by Emma Peel/Diana Rigg's real-life daughter, Rachel Stirling, of her first love, an actress of sorts, Kitty Butler, played by Keeley Hawes. Kitty's act is quite an odd one at the turn of the 20th century. Kitty dresses and acts on stage as a boy, even cutting her hair! How shameful in the day and age this novel and series is set in.

 ""Tipping The Velvet"" has been described as a lesbian historical piece but it is MUCH more than that. When you think of the Victorian era you think of stuffiness and of course, an element of great sexual repression but it must be remembered that during this time, women really moved from the passive to agressive; seeking their own ideals, life and pleasures that lie therein. This was the time of suffrage and Victorian women were coming into their own, with increased freedoms of all kinds, power, education and above all, just plain fun!

 And since Queen Victoria famously refused to admit lesbians even existed, young women like the Nan, Florence and Kitty's of the Victorian world were safe from being jailed unlike their male counterparts...

 Also in the cast is Anna Chancellor (""Duckface"" in Four Weddings & A Funeral) as Diana Leatherby, a sadomasochistic & exhibitionistic lover, and Jodhi May (Sister, My Sister & The House Of Mirth) as the kind, sweet and generous Florence.

 I am not going to lie. There are some very dicey scenes in this made for TV series that won't be to all people's liking, but if you have an open mind, can look beyond just a person's sexuality and see the truth and good in people, then you will enjoy this film as I did.

 Highly Recommended For The Indiscriminate...",1090368000,67,2000,4.682857142857143
1807262,5,B00007DL9J,"I read both 'Tipping the Velvet' and 'Fingersmith' and absolutely fell in love with the rich and detailed stories the author spins.  The books contain so much that I was a little unsure whether a movie would ever be able to match up to Sarah Waters' wonderful writing.
Much to my surprise, the acting, costumes, and story were as carefully and beautifully done as the books themselves.  It's obvious that the screenwriter(s) and director took pains to maintain the integrity of the story, with the same amount of grace and delicacy Waters uses in her book.
I recommend the book first and foremost, but once you finish it, you will definitely want to get this DVD!",1090108800,,663,4.706896551724138
1807263,5,B00007DL9J,"I came upon the DVD by chance, bought it, not realising what to expect. As it turned out, I totally love this film! Beautiful film, wonderful cast, superb acting. I really felt for Nan, the lead character, her loneliness and how she longed for companionship. It's a common feeling. Almost 3 solid hours of film and I love every minute of it. Loved the musical score too. I totally recommend it!",1089936000,,394,4.563380281690141

1807265,4,B00007DL9J,"... what is?  I like this movie.  I plan to watch it again.  I found myself really wanting Nan to find true love.  I identified with her in that regard.  I found the lovemaking in the film very beautiful in places.  I really enjoyed seeing those tender moments between women portrayed so well.  I wish that there was more of it on film.  I certainly hope that we all are not required to traverse the darkness that Nan did in order to find it, but I hope we all do. I am of course speaking of love.",1087689600,,497,4.051546391752577
1807266,5,B00007DL9J,"I normally don't take the time to write reviews but this movie warrants an exception.  I am no critic but I know what I enjoy and this movie was wonderful!  The plot is a trilogy that takes you through the romances and ordeals of the lead character Nan.  Suffice it to say, the story is very good and the love scenes are very tasteful and very erotic.  This movie will make you laugh and cry.  The ending is pleasantly surprising...and phrase ""Tipping the velvet"" is explained!  This one is a keeper!",1087171200,,500,4.43956043956044
1807267,5,B00007DL9J,"I read the book and was a little aprehensive to see the movie, but I am so happy that I did. The trials and tribulations that Nan goes through are both heart wrenching and fabulous, and the ending is sweet satisfaction. I would reccomend reading the book first because it is a little better than the movie, but either way both are still great!",1086998400,,343,4.375
1807268,4,B00007DL9J,"Of course the book is always better than the movie.  But you already knew that.  I rented Tipping the Velvet on a whim, after reading the book, though I thought at the time that the movie may be disappointing and low budget.  However I was pleasantly surprised about the quality of production.
The movie starts on the shores of Kent in a oyster parlour where a young girl is on the verge of coming of age and sexual exploration.  The catalyst for this is Kitty Butler, a music hall performer in drag who iniates a series of awakings for Nan.  They develop a close friendship and evetually Nan moves to London with Kitty to be her dresser.  This begins a labile romp in Victorian England.
The screenwriter stuck pretty faithfully to the book, in fact I noticed some omissions but no creative liberities until the very end and I am assuming it was for dramatic impact.
There were some cheesy special camera effects that ditracted from the movie, but they were minimal. I am heterosexual, but I felt little chemistry (especially Diana) in a few of the frank love scenes, but that could be my personal taste as well.
Other than that, it was a highly enjoyable movie.",1084924800,5,1162,4.5625
1807269,5,B00007DL9J,The quality of the movie and the story line are both just phenomenal. Tipping the velvet shows the torturous path to finding true love and the personal growth and angst that paves the way to true intimacy. The sex scenes are very tasteful and passionate.  There is something for every one; no matter your values.  True love always finds a way.,1083456000,2,343,4.60655737704918
1807270,5,B00007DL9J,"i saw the BBC series on television nearly a year before i read the book. unfortunatley i watched the entire series with my pearents (not advisable) and spent most of my time cringing with embarrasment!
Having said that tipping the velvet deals frankly yet sensitivley with the sex scenes in the series. the scenes remained steamy without becoming pornographicand even my perents were not offended by it!
i absoulutley loved this film, i watched it over and over again for weeks. The ONLY down side to this otherwise fantastic DVD is that the scenery is rather poor towards the end (to anyone whos seen it think of the scene on the bridge!) and the same actors occasionly pop up playing different charecters! but thats BBC drama for you!
All in all this is  must have movie for any body who enjoys a good love story and a selection of heart warming charecters and catchy show tunes (from the geougous keely hawks as kitty butler!) for me the lesbian theme is simply the icing on the cake!
PS. Read the book too! sarah walters has written a lesbian masterpeice! it is (if possible) better than the film! if like me you have watched the film before reading the book youll find yourself recognising moments from the film and knowing what is about to happen next! I found myself almost willing myself to read faster to get to my favorite parts of the story! don't buy one without the other! get the book and the DVD and u won't be sorry i promise!",1083196800,16,1442,4.524904214559387
1807271,5,B00007DL9J,"I read the book about a year before the movie came out.  I'm often disappointed in movies that follow books because they are almost never as good as the original.  Well, this movie was just as great as the book.  Fabulous acting and directing.
A tip...don't watch it with your parents.  It's pretty x-rated at times.",1082505600,,316,4.589285714285714
1807272,5,B00007DL9J,"I stumbled on this exquisite mini-series last year on BBC America, where it was pretty badly hacked up by the censors to conform to ""American"" tastes.  Even so, I was immensely impressed by this show's unique perspective on one aspect of Victorian life.  Now, having seen the original program as seen in the UK on DVD, all of the missing bits make for an even more satisfying and coherent whole.  I won't bother to repeat what other reviewers have said regarding the writing, acting and production.  At the core, this is a love story and pretty shamelessly so!  Bt whether you are straight or gay, I dare you not to be entertained by the unlikely journey of Nan Astley, from Whitstable oyster girl to music hall star.  And by the way, it's pretty damn funny too!  Highly recommended!",1081641600,2,783,4.630434782608695

1807274,4,B00007DL9J,"Gay or not, this will absolutely amuse you to pieces.  It was a cross between Moulin Rouge and Anais Nin. So theatrical and rich in images. The story is a bit epic in that you follow someone through the adult years of their life and what a ride it is. London has never looked more seedy and more beautiful and you get lost in the wealth of the storytelling. Strap it on for a try. Keep an open mind.",1077753600,4,399,4.050632911392405
1807275,5,B00007DL9J,"If you aren't familiar with Sarah Water's novel ""Tipping the Velvet"", you are bound to be surprised at the unfolding fate of Nan, the oyster-girl-come-musical-hall-singer whose unusual tale is the subject of the film ""Tipping the Velvet"".  Fortunately, the surprise is a purely pleasurable one.  This sexy, vibrant film is a fairly faithful adaptation, but treats its source material with a sense of humor and deftness of touch that is unusual in film adaptations of successful novels.  The three female leads are excellent, and the film will likely make a star of the beautiful Rachael Stirling, who shines as Nan Astley.  Excellent entertainment, and highly recommended.",1077494400,4,672,5.311320754716981
1807276,4,B00007DL9J,"This adaption or adaptation of Sarah Walters novel was fairly explicit, for BBC standards, and features two very attractive actresses in Ms. Hawes and Ms. Stirling, who, in particular, was a figure to be pitied at times.  Additional features, including filmography for each of the actors were helpful.  This was a well acted production, dealing with a fairly ""adult"", and probably rarely discussed topic of the times.  It's not that ""lesbianism"" didn't go on, as this movie proves, but it was (as it is to this day) not a topic that ""polite society"", even and especially then, wanted to deal with, as many felt (as an example, the Nan character's sister) disgusted by the fact that two women could have these feelings for (much less explicit relations) with each other.  Good movie, attractive actress, and well written.",1077148800,2,820,4.963503649635037
1807277,5,B00007DL9J,"We all know that a great book hardly ever translates well onto screen because no amount of screen time can compete with the magical words of a talented author and the wonders of your own imagination.  And having yet to read the book, I was cautious about watching the mini-series first.  Book or DVD first?  I couldn't stand the suspense so the DVD won out.  Right off the bat, and not a moment too soon, I was sucked into the fantabulous life and loves of Nan Astley (Rachel Stirling, daughter of 1960's 'Avengers' series star, Dianna Rigg).

This marvelous tale begins on the calm shores of 1890's Victorian England and quickly moves to the theater-world of London.  What is revealed, however, is bound to surprise you because no one's quite painted THIS picture of Victorian England--until now!  The series is filled with unforgettable characters, unbelievably touching moments (which you'll watch over & over), sumptuous costumes, beautiful leads, great humor, terrific drama, and not a moment of boredom.  And A+ on many levels for BBC, including their unabashed support of the subject matter.

This is a single-DVD product with the following bonus features:  3 complete episodes (178 minutes, as originally aired on BBC-UK, different from the 'edited' version shown on BBC-America); an interview with author Sarah Waters & screenwriter Andrew Davies (of 'Bridget Jones' Diary'); a slide-show photo gallery; and, a cast list of selected works.  Though lengthy for a BBC production and not long enough to satiate the most greedy of us, you'll no doubt watch the nearly 3-hours mini-series in one sitting.  Word to the wise: don't pop this in on a week night or you'll face a very tired morning-after at work! It gets 5-stars for its subject matter, acting, costumes, script, music, and it's replay value.

Buy this and enjoy.  I'm off to finally read the book!

**UPDATE!** February 17, 2004---I JUST finished reading the entire book last night and wanted to add info in comparing the book and this mini-series.  One word: Bravo!  While there certainly are differences in translation from book to screen, with some artistic license taken by Andrew Davies (screenwriter) to bring the movie full-circle towards the end, you will finish off the book with a little regret that it's all over, but gladly revisit it on-screen because the two mediums are happily alike!  If you have no idea what I'm talking about, read the book and watch the DVD!  I cannot imagine that anyone pleased with the book will be unhappy with this mini-series, because the script stays true to nearly 95% of the entire text. In fact, some of the scenes in the book and movie (such as the dialogue) are so similar that you'll find your eyes racing across the pages of the book, knowing what you'll be reading next - and not being able to read fast enough to get there! How can you fault that? If you are disappointed with the movie after having read the book, however...well, you can't please everyone all the time. ;) The book and the movie make a wonderful combo for someone who loves period fiction, has an interest in the subject matter, and/or is a fan of the book's author. HIGHLY recommend this mini-series! But DO read the book; it's a real pleasure to spend hours on end reading about Nan, Kitty, Diana, and the lot.
