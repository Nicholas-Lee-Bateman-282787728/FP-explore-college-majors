8546184,5,B00A2FHOKC,"This movie tells the true story about how,  a large part of Indigenous people, live in Australia. This one is about an ex criminal, street fighting, alcoholic man who begins a journey to find himself and what is really important to him. The big city is not the place for him to do this as there are far too many temptations and risks of bumping into old 'friends'. T.J decides to go North, where his ex 'wife' and son live. His son is at the age where he is questioning himself and seems to be following in the footsteps of the Father he doesn't know. The lead actor actually wrote some of his own dialogue and contributed much from his own personal life. The scenery and music are amazing and there is comedy amongst the seriousness of this film, again, in true form of Australian Aborigines. This film went on to assist in the prisons and youth detention centres around Australia, with the lead actor going in and talking with many young Indigenous and non Indigenous youths who had been incarcerated. It is definitely one to watch.",1433721600,,1034,4.529411764705882
