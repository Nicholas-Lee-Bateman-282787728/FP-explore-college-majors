8091008,2,B000BQ7DEY,"I thought that this video was about teaching the alphabet, but it was more of a ""ABC"" slideshow with mostly irrelevant pictures. I imagine it is supposed to familiarize its audience with the letters, but the graphics did not keep my kid's attention in the slightest.",1363737600,,266,4.804347826086956
8091009,1,B000BQ7DEY,"POOR QUALITY AND SOUND, TODDLERS CAN NOT LEARN ANYTHING FROM THIS JUNK! THE LETTERS ARE SHOWN BUT NO SOUNDS LIKE IF THE CHILDREN ARE ALREADY SUPPOSE TO KNOW THIS ON THEIR OWN!!!",1358208000,,177,4.5625
8091010,5,B000BQ7DEY,I bought of couple of dvds for my babies (I have a childcare) and this is the best ever if you want your kids to learn the alphabet. They enjoy watching it over and over.  I would recommend this to everyone who have smaller kids.,1245369600,,229,4.088888888888889
