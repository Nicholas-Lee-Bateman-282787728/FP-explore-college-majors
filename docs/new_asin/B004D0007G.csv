8424640,4,B004D0007G,"OK typical early 50's Jungle Jim jungle adventure.  Jim, a female photojournalist, and a local chieftain go on a trek to search for a missing football hero (played by a real football player) and to find out who is routing native villages and enslaving the locals.  Entertaining, though sometimes silly.  This is supposed to be Africa but the indigenous peoples are Polynisian.  The Columbia Pictures DVD-R is excellent quality.  Recommended for jungle adventure fans.",1438732800,,467,5.256756756756757

8424642,3,B004D0007G,"First of all, if you are going to order a ""Jungle Jim"" DVD you should, and probably do, know roughly what to expect. If you don't know you could be in for a disapointment-maybe. The good bit first. The DVD transfer is very good. Clear picture and sound and 4.3 ratio. There are some highlights, the ""Skeleton Men"", Sheila Ryan's feisty leading lady (her performence is better than the film), and bits of the action. BUT.. Weissmuller is really pretty awful. He just cannot act, and seems to have little personality. The film ""introduces"" BOB WATERFIELD (ex football player) and he is even worse. Lyle Talbott, usually reliable, is definitely in it for the (presumably low)fee. The fight scenes all look as though they were filmed on the same day and are bad. The ridiculous use of stock shots from ""One Million Years BC"" of two Prehistoric monsters!!! is so wrong it must have baffled juvenile audiences even in 1951. (Do watch the trailer-it's good and includes a scene of a man in a prehistoric cossie attacking Jim-It's not in the film). I took a similar chance4 with the BOMBA (Vol 2) DVD and that is better film wise. Now, in truth I did almost enjoy the badness of this film, but at the high price3 and having some experience of the ""Jungle Jim"" films I WONT be ordering any more. But, If you want to see for yourself I am pretty sure this is as good as any of the others, so maybe maybe worth a chance??",1391212800,,1410,4.4689922480620154
