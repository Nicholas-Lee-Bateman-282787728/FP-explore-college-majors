5104401,4,B007PXYWTU,"Alex Toth best known for his comic book work at D.C. Comics & Space Ghost Hanna-Barbera Saturday morning TV cartoons spoke about his work on this film in my ""Jon Fury in JAPAN by Alex Toth"" Published under my ""Paul Power Publication"" banner with Toth's blessings.
This was to be Alex Toth's last interview he passed away very shortly after.
The comic book is a full color 68 page comic book that on sale now.

 The film itself is sort of like the MATRIX in a concept.
I enjoyed the little bit of Jiu-Jitsu in the ""DREAM"" sequences. So glad it is on sale. It is a fun sci-fi adventure.",1334880000,11,584,4.3
5104402,4,B007PXYWTU,I remember this movie from when I was a teenager.  Great to have it on DVD,1407024000,,74,3.625
5104403,4,B007PXYWTU,"Ok. ""Project X"" is not a deep, philosophical film by any stretch of the imagination, but it is fun and not particularly as violent as today's films.

I enjoyed the film. I saw it when it was on the CBS Late Night Movie years ago. Probably that's why the film aroused my curiosity when I had the chance to view it as an adult.

The plot is somewhat a mishmash. Set about a hundred years in the future, Christopher George stars as a futuristic secret agent who has lost his memory (due to an amnesia inducing drug that was given to him if he was tortured) and the far-out and totally hysterical plan by a group of scientists (led by Henry Jones) to recover the secrets George's character lost. And, of course, the safety of the world depends on it.

The late Henry Jones, a sixties and seventies TV and film star, was a far better actor than given credit for. Granted, he was never the ""star,"" but he was a fine supporting player who really brought a great performance to what ever TV and movie production he was working on.

The sixties elements are in fine form here; the psychedelic opening credits, the animation, the cheesy human brain in a transparent globe, the outlandish outfits. They all scream the sixties.

I didn't realize until recently this was a William Castle production. But now that I know, it's so obvious.  But I still find it more original with some of its ideas than more contemporary films.

Hey! If we're tortured and we lose our memory, let's all be reprogrammed with a new identity and personality and given a beautiful new wife.  Who cares about our former lives and family? Sounds good to me.

For Sixties Fans.

5104404,5,B007PXYWTU,"I first saw this film in 1968 at a movie house when I was 18 years old, and it made a lasting impression. Yes, it was shot on a shoestring budget and some of the ""special"" effects were animated by Hanna Barbera Studios (some of the underwater sequences were reused from the Jonny Quest tv series), but that's what helped make it unique for its time.

It also has a pretty decent plot that includes overpopulation, genetic engineering and biological warfare. The acting, while not quite Oscar-caliber, isn't all that bad and includes some of my old favorites like Chris George (""Rat Patrol""), Henry Jones (""Phyllis""), Monte Markham (""The Golden Girls""), and Harold Gould (""Rhoda""). Look these guys up on WikipediA and you'll find they all had impressive filmographies before turning to television.

I bought the film (Blu-ray) because it's impossible to find on television (I think it's been shown twice over the last 40 or so years), which is a shame because it's a perfect late-night or rainy afternoon passtime.

Olive Films has done a good job bringing the print to high-definition quality: the colors are vivid and the look of the original film appears to have been retained. The monaural soundtrack, although good, would have benefitted from (at least) a stereo remix, but the film most likely has a limited market so I'll give Olive a pass on this one.",1365465600,3,1358,4.844827586206897
5104405,5,B007PXYWTU,"Most of director/producer William Castle's films seem to be either straight horror, light macabre or mystery thrillers, and so this unusual science-fiction entry in his long list of films makes me wish that he had done some more in this genre. Although this film suffers, in part, from a lack of a bigger budget, there's certainly no poverty of interesting ideas in the story. PROJECT X is a combination of Science-fiction thriller and espionage thriller, and the two elements blend together rather cleverly. What's also interesting about this movie is that Castle got the services of Hanna-Barbera to do some very fascinating special-effects sequences. I remember seeing this movie at Steel Pier in Atlantic City when I was 15 years old, and always had fond memories of it. When I finally obtained, after hunting this down for years, a copy of the movie on DVD, I played it and was not disappointed-it's still lived up to those memories.",1362614400,15,938,4.943037974683544
5104406,4,B007PXYWTU,Great Sci Fi flick. The film came delivered in good condition and on time. The film itself had a couple elements that were unique still today like smoking our food supplements and thinking so hard your thoughts physically manifest themselves. Sci Fi tends to reflect what the state of the times is going through and this one reflects the 60's. It feels dated be there are interesting ideas there.,1360368000,2,396,4.753623188405797

5104408,4,B007PXYWTU,Normally stories like this are seen from the persective of the lead character where they don't know what is going on until late in the story where they finally see behind the curtain. This movie shows you everything going on behind the scenes from the start. Weird.,1358726400,,265,4.659574468085107
5104409,4,B007PXYWTU,"True confessions: I bought this video after trying in vain to find a copy on Netflix/Hulu/YouTub/Amazon Prime. I have been going nuts since 1970 trying to find out how this movie ended.

I saw the first half of ""Project X"" in November of 1970. Why didn't I see the second half? I had told my folks I was going to be hanging out with friends that night  - but convienently forgot to tell them the friend was named Peggy (insert sigh here). In order to get her in home in time - for me to get home in time - we had to leave the Kambe theater early - but my carefully devised duplicity all came to naught when I got my dad's Maverick stuck in the snow and busted curfew anyway.

Through the pre-video years that followed that first interupted viewing I would search late-night movie listings for this show, eventually forgetting the name and most of the plot line other than it starred Christopher George. Then the Internet struck.  Thank Wikipedia for helping me find the name of the show listed under Mr. George's entry. Thank Amazon Video for finally providing me the chance to see how the story ended.

Is this great cinema? No. I wanted to see/purchase this video mostly out of nostalgia sake, but I find that I like it for the same reason I love the 1966 Adam West version of Batman. (It may be campy but it would be nice to live in a world where a flabby middle-aged man in tights is considered attractive and no one really gets hurt.) ""Project X"" is ""happy"" entertainment but then what else would you expect out of one of Hanna-Barbera's very few live-action ventures? We live in a time when domestic and foreign terrorism scares the ba-jebbers out of all of us...and robs too many of us(and sadly our children)of a decent future.

This is escapist entertainment. It's nice to check out for an hour and half and watch SGT Troy run around with a fabric-covered bowl on his head trying to pass as a ""Sinoese"" peasant.  This is better 60s escapist fare than most with equivalent budgets. There is the obligatory 60's flashing-color psychedelic scene but the setting actually has some internal logic and the show does have a plot you can follow, flimsy as it may be.  I think my only beef is with the really dopey clear-plastic helmets the security officers wear.

Yes, this is chewing gum for your eyes - but at least it's Hubba-Bubba.",1355961600,28,2337,4.492924528301887
5104410,3,B007PXYWTU,"I saw this movie when it came out in 1968, I was 12 years old.  I realy liked it then.  It had action and out of this world effects.  Now as an adult its just so-so.  It did bring back memories of my friends and I at that time.  As I can recall it was a much bigger production on the big screen, or was everything ""bigger"" to me back then?  I'm not sure.  God bless the star Mr. Christopher George.  May him and this movie rest in peace.",1350000000,3,437,3.831460674157303
5104411,5,B007PXYWTU,"UPDATE:Now that I ahve received the blu ray here is a brief review of the actual quality of the disc.  There are now bonus features as this is a bare bones release.  I must comment Olive Films on the quality. For a film of it's age the film is very crisp, clear, and completely acceptable.  The film is also presented in it's original widescreen ratio which is quite refreshing after seeing it in pan and scan format on broadcast tv for many years.
For what you get the price of the dvd is also very reasonable.  Well done Olive.  keep these rare, quality releases coming!

It's about time this classic William Castle scifi thriller from the 60s had was released!  This film should appeal to film buffs of 60sc scifi flicks a well as fans of Irwin Allen as there is alot in this film that was borrowed from IA including the style of SFX to the tech hardware used in the movie.  For me this film is a must have and I never expected
to see it released on dvd let alone Blu Ray.
I'll update my review with a rating on the quality and technical aspects of this release when I recieve it.",1336867200,13,1083,4.248780487804878

8520808,4,B007PXYWTU,"Interesting low budget sci fi from the late 1960's. The clothes, hair styles, cars, and view of future technology come from the 1960's.

8520809,4,B007PXYWTU,"great flick missed this one in my youth I was very young then when it came out. Reminded me of the classic TV shows from that time like Star Trek, Man From U.N..C.L.E. and others. But unless you lived and loved those time you won't like this much cheap, cheesy and campy. But for me I liked it. And I like Christopher George too, the Rat Patrol was one of my favorite from that time period.",1469145600,,390,4.144736842105263

8520812,3,B007PXYWTU,"This video, along with other versions, is cropped to make it widescreen. It was filmed at approx 1.33-1. Though the movie itself is great, but I got suspicious at a few spots where one guys head was lopped off and the view seemed ""short."" I went to a TV edition, which you have to be lucky enough to catch, and the comparison is below. You can see further detail in the full shot.
 A point I feel that is important is that I watch all my movies/dvds through my PC, which is my TV, too. I use players like VLC that can stretch or change the aspect ratio. If you were to change the aspect ratio of the full screen version to 16x10 or even 16x9, you get a stretch with all the detail involved. 16x9 can be a little too wide for some people's perspective, but I defy anyone to use a pleasant 16x10 and find distortion.
  Side point - for us video on demand demanders - Amazon used to post the aspect ratio of all the films. Now, you can't even call or write for the info. You pay. They play.
  More crop info. In cropping the films they have increased the image in spots. That can cause some blur on larger monitors. I went to a lot of trouble to get This Island Earth from England because of the WS aspect. All I got was trim. A trimmed film and a trim wallet.
  You may not have another option to buy this film, so it's a wash. Unless they put out a full screen version, this one will do for most.",1430524800,4,1395,4.069343065693431
8520813,5,B007PXYWTU,"A classic film that is difficult to find, thanks to the unfortunate commonality of title with an unrelated Matthew Broderick film of the 1980s.",1418688000,,143,5.0
8520814,4,B007PXYWTU,"I saw this movie on television when it was first out and never saw it again until just recently.  I looked for it for decades, because I could not remember the name of the movie.  Now that I have seen it again, it did not disappoint me.  Hanna Barbara did the special effects.  The movie sort of reminds me of The Time Tunnel meets Johnny Quest!  The actors are great and the world they set up is very good too.  I looks like it could be a pilot for a series, and it is a series I would have watched.",1417564800,,500,3.95
8520815,4,B007PXYWTU,"For about the first quarter of this  picture , I was not overly taken with it  . At about that point though , cool stuff started happening and those promised Hanna-Barbera special effects started kicking in . I found them really neat , especially as the film progressed . I did feel the film was a little too television-like until things got going . There's certainly a good deal more than initially meets the senses with this story . You'll probably recognize much of the cast from television and film if you're a real watcher and of a certain age . Sold me a copy . It's fun , interesting  , different and entertaining .",1416700800,,622,4.391304347826087
8520816,5,B007PXYWTU,"A really thoughtful story done on the cheap by William Castle. Henry Jones gives a great performance as the scientist in charge of the project, Greta Baldwin is gorgeous, the story is really different, the use of animation is interesting, and the vision of the future presented is unlike anything you've ever seen. You would call it dystopian if you had to live there, but the people in the story take it for granted.

I bought the regular DVD of this one. There isn't anything going on onscreen that you need Blu Ray to fully appreciate. Not even Greta Baldwin.

I think this is the only S.F. movie by William Castle, which is a shame.",1408320000,6,636,4.521739130434782
