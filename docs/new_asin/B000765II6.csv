2200781,1,B000765II6,"This is easily one of the worst movies ever made.  thinking how hard can it be to mess up the mean girls in high school genre, I actually expected this to be rather good since it had both Julie Benz and Jonathan Brandis.  Instead it is a collection of bad acting, slapstick comedy that distractingly is accompanied by Bugs Bunny style sound effects, and super boring plot development.  I ended up watching this all the way till the end hoping that maybe it would get better.  Instead I would say that it actually gets worse.  If you liked Heathers, wild things, or the Buffy TV series then you will probably hate this movie as much as I did.  In fact I would go so far to say that as crappy as the buffy movie was (which preceeded the TV show), that movie is made to look quite good compared to this one.  This movie is THAT bad.  Spend your time on something more entertaining, like sleeping or doing math homework.  You have been warned",1349136000,,938,4.344827586206897
2200782,5,B000765II6,"After I found out that the actor Jonathan Brandis had died, I went looking to get all of his movies that I could find.  This was a great movie and well worth watching over and over.  It was a little cheesy, but had a surprise ending that made the whole thing well worth watching!",1269820800,,279,4.148148148148148
2200783,4,B000765II6,"BAD GIRLS FROM VALLEY HIGH (aka ""A Fate Totally Worse than Death"") is a fun teen comedy along the same themes as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Heathers/dp/B00000IBRT/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Heathers</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Jawbreaker/dp/0767832302/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Jawbreaker</a>.  Perhaps this film is most notable for featuring teen heart-throb Jonathan Brandis (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-NeverEnding-Story-II-The-Next-Chapter/dp/B00005LKI0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The NeverEnding Story II - The Next Chapter</a>, ""SeaQuest DSV"") in his final screen role before committing suicide.

Teen queens Danielle (Julie Benz), Brooke (Monica Keena), and Tiffany (Nicole Bilderback) rule their highschool with an iron fist.  When Danielle sets her sights on football captain Drew (Jonathan Brandis), she enlists Tiffany and Brooke to help in eliminating Drew's girlfriend.  But just as Danielle begins to make her move on Drew, beautiful new exchange student Katarina (Suzanna Urszuly) beats her to the prize!

Plus, to make matters worse, a strange curse has come over Danielle and her gal-pals.  Slowly but surely, they are transforming into ugly old hags and being forced to buy adult diapers at the local supermarket!  What exactly is happening to them...and could Katarina be responsible...?

This mild teen thriller-comedy features some good work from Julie Benz (who also ironically co-starred in ""Jawbreaker"").  Monica Keena (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/While-You-Were-Sleeping/dp/6304765266/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">While You Were Sleeping</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Snow-White-A-Tale-of-Terror/dp/B0000694XX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Snow White - A Tale of Terror</a>) is also fun.  Fans of classic movies will be slightly disheartened to see a clearly-unwell Janet Leigh playing Mrs Witt, the zonked-out patient of a nursing home (also her final film credit); and there's Christopher Lloyd in yet another eccentric professor role.

BAD GIRLS FROM VALLEY HIGH is an enjoyable little movie that would be fun in a double feature with ""Jawbreaker"" or ""Heathers"".  The supernatural elements in the film will also draw comparisons to ""The Craft"".  (Single-sided, single-layer disc).",1182816000,8,2444,7.503496503496503
2200784,3,B000765II6,"This movie is the last film the late Janet Leigh finished before her death.  Appropriately so since Leigh's most famous role was as the victim in the classic PSYCHO.  She doesn't have a lot of screen/scream time in this film, but she manages to make an impression.  Otherwise, this is a dark little comedy in the vein of such films as THE CRAFT and HEATHERS.  Three snooty girls (well embodied by Julie Benz, Nicole Bilderback and Monica Keena) have murdered a hunk's girlfriend and staged it as a suicide, all so one of them can claim the hunk for herself.  On the first anniversary of the ""suicide"" a mysterious stranger from Romania appears and the girls are convinced she is the ghost of the murdered girl.  They set out a plot to ensnare this girl and once again claim the hunk.

The movie doesn't live up to its possibilities, but there are some genuinely funny lines and scenes, and a good examination of the cliche class of highschoolers.  Christopher Lloyd has a Jerry Lewis/Chevy Chase like bumbling role that he carries out with his usual aplomb.  All in all, a fun way to spend ninety minutes.",1129507200,,1105,4.596938775510204
2200785,3,B000765II6,"I love teen movies, no matter how dumb they are - and Bad Girls From Valley High (also known as A Fate Totally Worse Than Death) is pretty dumb.  It's also a little bit eerie, featuring both Janet Leigh and Jonathon Brandis in one of their final films - although it should be noted that this film actually dates back to 2000.  Leigh actually looks pretty bad here, much worse than she did in 1998's Halloween H20.  The presence of Monica Keena was what clinched the deal for me, though, and it's really amazing just how much she doesn't look like the exceedingly fine Monica Keena I saw in Jason vs. Freddy.  There are some who might compare this film to Jawbreakers, but Bad Girls From Valley High is really not in the same league as that Rose McGowan vehicle.  This movie introduces a supernatural element to the story of high school cliquedom, doesn't always have the wittiest dialogue (although a few real zingers slip in there from time to time), and panders to the lowest, most obvious level of comedy time and time again.

Danielle (Julie Benz) is the leader of a little threesome of arrogant, mean high school girls; she and her rich friends Tiffany (Nicole Bilderback) and Brooke (Monica Keena) care only about their pampered selves (although Brooke has periodic misgivings).  Surprisingly, though, they don't seem all that popular.  No one really hangs out with them except a dumb jock and the class nerd, and poor Danielle is getting nowhere with Drew (Jonathon Brandis) - even after she and her pals kinda, sorta killed his last girlfriend.  It's been a year, and Drew still ignores her - but he doesn't ignore the new foreign exchange student Katarina (Suzanna Urszuly).  Since Katarina can't take a hint, Danielle begins plotting her downfall, as well.  There's a slight problem, however.  She and her friends begin experiencing a level of high weirdness in their lives, and we watch the girls rapidly age before our eyes as the film progresses.  This leads to a number of embarrassing little incidents and only serves to make Danielle more desperate than ever.  She'll sacrifice anything, even Drew, to get her youth and looks back.

Christopher Lloyd plays a suspicious teacher in the film, and he suffers through a continuing series of falls and spills of a painful and comedic (at least that was the intention) sort.  These nonstop gags are just way too obvious and overdone, doing the film more harm than good, in my opinion.  The ending of the film is good, though, as it actually manages to pull off a reasonably successful little twist - and doesn't end quite the way you might expect.

I'm pretty lukewarm in my opinion of this movie.  As dumb comedy, it has its moments - but far too often the humor is strained, and the story is unconvincing.  The supernatural aspects of the story reinforce the superficiality of the script, meaning this film really has nothing much to say about high school cliques or the like.  I certainly didn't have any high school flashbacks watching this movie, and I don't think many other viewers will either.  Bad Girls of Valley High is reasonably funny, but I can't help thinking that it could have been a much better, much funnier film.",1120608000,6,3192,4.734177215189874
2200786,5,B000765II6,"This is a very good movie! Somewhat like the movie Jawbreaker, but much better. It also stars the late Jonathan Brandis (RIP), you definitely won't be disappointed if you buy it.",1120089600,,178,4.774193548387097
2200787,5,B000765II6,"This movie was filmed some time ago, and originally titled ""A Fate Totally Worse Than Death"".  It is based on the novel of the same name.  This is one of the last films by Jonathan Brandis, and has been eagerly awaited by his fans.",1106438400,3,231,4.2272727272727275

2200789,5,B000765II6,This movie is great! Finally broke down and added it to my collection.,1422576000,,70,4.461538461538462
2200790,4,B000765II6,"Although released to video in 2005, ""Bad Girls From Valley High"" was actually shot in 1999 and shelved for legal (or financial) reasons. The plot revolves around three selfish uppity girls (Julie Benz, Nicole Bilderback & Monica Keena) who are responsible for the death of a girl (Tanja Reichert) of whom the leader (Benz) is jealous. A year later a mysterious exchange student appears (Suzanna Urszuly) and the girls start to wonder if she may be a ghost of vengeance, particularly as they start prematurely aging. Jonathan Brandis, Chris D'Elia, Christopher Lloyd and Janet Leigh have important peripheral roles.

It's too bad this movie fell into obscurity because it works well for what it is. It's got the pizazz and quirkiness this type of film requires and a number of laugh-out-loud scenes, plus there's no unnecessary raunch or general obnoxiousness, except of course for the main ""Hun"" girl (Benz). Tanja Reichert is a highlight, but she appears so briefly she's almost not worth mentioning; and Keena is a cutie but they don't do enough with her. But Lloyd is his usual entertaining self. Brandis would commit suicide four years later and Leigh would pass away in five.

The film was shot in Vancouver (but the story takes place in Washington) and runs a short-but-sweet 84 minutes.

8044823,5,B000765II6,"A funny and fresh comedy that will find you laughing and delighted with its comedic plot. This movie loosely reminds me of some of the comedic elements in the 1985 movie Weird Science.
Sadly though... as I watch I silently mourn the tragic death of Jonathan Brandis. My best friend- that I never did meet.
Jonathan passed away on November 12, 2003 as a result of an accident. I am so deeply saddened to have lost such a beautiful, shinning star.
