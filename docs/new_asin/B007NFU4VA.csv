8519685,3,B007NFU4VA,"Bought it simply because it had one of Italy's sex bombs of that generation - Edwige Fenech.

  My only disappointment is that all these films do not have any English subtitles, Italian yes but what's the point in that?.. an Italian film that caters for Italians and for a small degree some parts of Europe who might know a bit of Italian thus Italian subtitles? So the 3 stars.

  To fans of Edwige Fenech films of this type of genre, expect the same and not much else.. but hey I'm sure you bought it for the same reason I did - the very sexy and alluring Edwige Fenech.",1364601600,,572,4.25
