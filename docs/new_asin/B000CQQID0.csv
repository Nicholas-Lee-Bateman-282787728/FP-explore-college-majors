2469896,5,B000CQQID0,"A quick tip for all readers: I love Amazon and everything, but Bestbuy.com is currently selling this DVD collection for the incredible price of $39.99, which is barely more expensive than purchasing a single season DVD.  Take advantage before they realize it and hike the price way up.

Mr. Show was one of my favorite shows when it was on HBO.  The comedy is so strange and eccentric that it stands in a class of its own.  Individually, Bob Odenkirk is a very talented comedy writer and David Cross is an equally talented stand-up comedian.  Together, these two comedic minds created a unique showcase of off-beat comedy sketches.  This show also introduced the world to other comedic talents such as Jack Black, Sarah Silverman and Brian Posehn.

Getting all four seasons together is a great deal.  You get to see how the show progressed and became more collected by the time they reached the 4th season.  By that point, the comic duo had perfected their teaming and were shelling out some seriously memorable material.

Great show and a great DVD collection to have.",1139616000,83,1069,4.7923497267759565
2469897,5,B000CQQID0,It's refreshing to see people who can make fun of everything and don't hold any prejudice against any one sect. These guys comedy holds no limits to who or what they target. A must have for anyone who loves realistic comedy. When I saw they were releasing all their seasons in one box set I was sold. If you haven't seem Mr. Show don't waste your time picking out one season at a time to see if your going to like it just buy the whole set because you will end up buying them all eventually. Comic genius's they guys are.,1137801600,15,521,4.1683168316831685
2469898,5,B000CQQID0,"I remember the first time I saw this show; it was after they had already stopped making new episodes, but HBO was rerunning the old ones every weeknight.  I could not believe what I was hearing and seeing.  It was easily the hardest I had ever laughed at a television show.

These guys did edgy, smart comedy before such stuff became fairly commonplace.  I really believe that these guys are going to influence the future of comedy.

This set is marvelous.  Buy it.  It is offensive, it can be crude and absurd, but it is always hilarious.",1135900800,6,539,4.494845360824742
2469899,4,B000CQQID0,"Cheerfully blending a gee-golly, ""let's put on a show"" sweetness with a brazenly filthy sense of humor, ""Mr. Show"" is arguably the funniest and most original sketch comedy show since Monty Python. Bob Odenkirk and David Cross lead a talented cast -- and guest stars like Jack Black and Sarah Silverman -- through increasingly loony sketches that seamlessly blend into one another, stream-of-consciousness style. You could call it ""mashup comedy,"" as much of the series' hilarious punch comes from fusing two disparate elements -- the Pope and the O.J. Simpson trial, for example -- into one bizarre whole. Highlights include the folksy proprietors of a Mom-and-Pop porn shop; an infomercial for pans which rapidly becomes a twisted psychological nightmare; Jack Black in a slacker pardoy of ""Jesus Christ Superstar""; America's quest to blow up the moon; a group of mobsters arguing over what the biggest number is; and a Jerry Springer-like talk show set on a life raft adrift in the ocean. ""Mr. Show's"" definitely not for everyone, but if you've got adventurous tastes in comedy, you're all but certain to love it.",1135641600,19,1115,5.098360655737705

The surreal nature of the sketches and the constant flow from one bit to the next make each episode a marathon laugh session. The commentaries are great and the cast and creators are as honest and funny as you would expect from these comedians.

2469930,5,B000CQQID0,"I have put together who these two comics and writers are completely backwards. It doesn't matter because I love whatever they do. First I saw David Cross play the psychiatrist on ""Arrested Development"". He was my favorite character. I wondered what had happened to him but it turns out I just hadn't been looking in the right places. But in my defense, he is such a chameleon, there is no guarantee on recognizing him from one role to the next. Then I loved Bob Odenkirk on ""Breaking Bad"" as Saul Goodman and am now watching him on his own Saul show which spun off ""Breaking Bad.""

I was absolutely thunderstruck to discover Odenkirk had been writing ""Saturday Night Live"" before that, which I'd been watching and had not realized he even existed. Then I put together that he had a whole other comedy and writing career with David Cross. So, I watched ""Mr. Show"" AFTER all of these other shows.

These are the two most amazing, versatile, imaginative performers. I hesitate to call them comics. That is because on his last two shows I have seen Odenkirk do some really strong dramatic work as well. Plus they both write as well. I don't think I've ever underestimated two performers more. These two guys are solid gold. Watch everything they do including all of Mr. Show.",1450137600,,1271,4.644444444444445

The actual DVD quality is very good to great, speaking in terms of image and sound quality -- some multi-show DVD's suffer due to excessive compression, but that is not the case here.

I am glad that I didn't pay attention to all the bad reviews.

2469965,5,B000CQQID0,"I was turned to this show by an ex girlfriend. I broke up with the girl but I loved the show/ Mr Show is much like Monty Python and SCTV in that their comedy went beyond joke driven short skits and into longer evolving storylines with their comedy. SCTV Network 90 had some comedy storylines (called runners) which spanned much of an entire hour. They even went so far as to do a soap oera spoof which last a full season and a half. Monty Python had entire episodes based on a single storyline or character (Dennis Moore, Bicycle Trip and my favorite (Science Fiction Sketch). Mr Show does not go that far with their sketches but they go into their comedy with the same approach.

While there is SNL alumni here, the SNL influence on the show does not really show itself. This show is an improvement on SNL mostly because it's tape and the writers have time to develop their ideas and the performers have time to really act their parts. SNL is written in a week and the performers are up there doing bits they learned within 72 hours. You have repeat characters but little else.

Mr. Show also is a freer show than SCTV and Monty Python in the sense that they really were not afraid to go very nearly too far in alot of their sketches (it helps that Mr Show was on cable too, Monty Python and most of SCTV was on network television). This puts Mr Show on par with The Kids in the Hall (the show Mr Show basically replaced on HBO after it was moved to NBC). They approach jumping over the line with tortured slave writing comedy skits, CS Lewis Jr (modeled after Hank Williams Jr) singing the praises of the USA on the brink of their plan to blow up the moon and of course the Titannica sketch but they manage to avoid crossing the line.

Finally, the performers are all good actors. Bob Odenkirk, David Cross and the cast all had a long history of performing and in this show, you can see quality acting on their parts.

Bob Odenkirk, David Cross, Mary Lynn Rajskub, Jack Black, and Sarah Silverman are the major stars you'll notice here. There are a few minor guest appearances here and there as well.

Every episode has audio commentary which starts out with Bob and Dave mostly but eventually features much (if not all) of the cast appearing in each episode.

WELL WORTH THE COST OF ADMISSION FOR A ENTIRE 4 SEASON SERIES ON 6 DVDS.

Mr. Show exposes the dark and grimey relationship that America has with sex, consumerism, and entertainment; kidnaps it, holds it for ransom, and makes you pay with guttural guffaws that you didn't think you had the resources for. This isn't spoon fed A to B comedy, while delivering low hanging fruit Mr. Show makes you jump high to catch direction and true meaning. Socially poignant while playing in classical absurdism; Mr. Show is the comedy show for those that appreciate independent thought and laughing like a baby playing peek-a-boo.

Even though there are a handful of obscure and random jokes throughout the series that go over my head I always am amazed at how well Bob and David thought outside the box to deliver something different and hilarious.

Mr. Show is interesting because some of the skits are classics and really hilarious and then some skits are so random that it's weird and not really funny. Skits like ""U.S. customs"" and ""change for a dollar"" are the some of the best of the series and they're the ones that have a ton of hits on youtube. I really recommend this if you like david cross stand up or his albums. You'll also love this stuff if you like SNL style comedy and don't mind language or if you liked laughing at tobias on arrested development.

2469992,1,B000CQQID0,"SAVE YOUR MONEY, NOT THAT FUNNY. If you are looking for something new for your funny bone you haven't found it, yet.

I was totally taken back when I started watching this series. I have a great sense of humor. There isn't much I don't like from the good old Three Stooges, Spinal Tap, Monty Python, to more modern humor ranging from Family Guy, Modern Family and Arrested Development. One of the main reason I bought this was not because of the reviews but because of the actor David Cross. He delivered some great lines in Arrested Development, highly recommend if you haven't seen it. I thought it might grow on me, I remember not really taking to The Office immediately but enjoyed most of the seasons, including the British version with Ricky Gervias. I stuck through 14 Mr. Show episodes and watched every second of the first 14 shows, all at different times and in different moods, believe me I really honestly wanted to laugh. I read the other reviews and sincerely from the depth of my being don't get it. It simply IS NOT funny. These reviews, which are few, when you look at other great shows, are suspect. Maybe the cast and crew wrote them. If you laugh, tell me the episode and time and I swear I will give it a try. I would like at least one good laugh. Really I didn't even crack a smile, not even a chuckle. If you are going to spend your money try Arrested Development first, that show will certainly make you laugh and David Cross is great, even though it is a secondary part. The lines were perfect for him. One more thing, Ron Howard produced and narrates Arrested Development and that certainly could be the difference.

Update: 11/30/12 Still not funny. A few are very good. But to watch and wait for a good bit is not worth it. If you like David Cross, and I do, watch him in Arrested Development, that show is cleverly done.",1281744000,10,1849,4.435294117647059

2469994,4,B000CQQID0,"<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mr-Show-The-Complete-Collection/dp/B000CQQID0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mr. Show: The Complete Collection</a>&nbsp;is a great sketch comedy show that goes beyond the traditional boundaries of the genre.  This show is reminiscent of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Monty-Python-s-Flying-Circus/dp/B0009XRZ92/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Monty Python's Flying Circus</a>&nbsp;in its free flowing style, but is also ground-breaking in both structure and content.  The skits often border on ""stupid-humor"" that can be easily enjoyed by those with a short-attention span.  But when you peel back the layers, it is clear that there are deeper satirical meanings to many of those silly skits.

Bob Odenkirk and David Cross used their HBO show to push the boundaries of what was acceptable in humor and television.  They brought significant writing chops with them, having written for SNL and the Ben Stiller show, and drawing on their connections with the Second City comedy troup.  Some of the stars who get face time here include Jack Black, Sarah Silverman and Brian Posein.

For four seasons, they beat the odds and despite a terrible time slot (Monday's at midnight) gathered a cult following.  While I never got to see much of the show while it was on TV, I was familiar with the show and I jumped at the chance to buy the complete set.  I am really glad that I did.

This show is definitely not for everybody, but for those with open-minded experiemental taste in humor, it is well worth watching.  No taboo is untouched, including sex, race and religion.  So watching this show requires you to reserve judgement.  However, be warned that there are plenty of parental advisories.  There is gratuitous cursing and plenty of sexual skits that are not going to appeal to those who are easily offended.

THE SEASONS

Seasons one and two are crammed into one set, while seasons three and four are each in their own two-disk sets.  Season 1 includes four episodes, and season two includes 6.  Both seasons 3 and 4 are 10 episodes each.  That gives you about 900 minutes of TV, 900 minutes of commentary, and probably almost 3 hours of additional special features among the various disks.  At this point I have watched every episode (some multiple times) and every special feature.  I haven't listened to all the commentary yet.  Suffice it to say that the commentary is also often sarcastic and satirical in nature.  Some commentaries are completely seperate episodes.  Bob and David perform other characters and have other cast and writers join in.

THE DISKS

There are some strange aspects in the way these disks were authored.  For one thing, only the first set (seasons one and two) includes subtitles.  Seasons three and four do not include subtitles.  None of these disks provide languages other than English.  This makes this set impractical for sharing with those who don't speak English.

The menus are also strange.  The first set includes the ""Mr. Show"" icon to show you which item you've selected.  But the other disks include strange colors that make it difficult to know which item is selected before you press enter.

Finally, and perhaps most annoying of all, these disks do not include a ""play all"" feature for the episodes.  For each episode, you must click through the episode list, select your episode, and then click ""Yes"" or ""No"" to hear the commentary.  This a time-consuming hastle.

THE SPECIAL FEATURES

Season one is on one disk and includes ""The Fuzz"" musical about Ronnie Dobbs.  This feature is one of the best.  The only problem with it is that it includes footage that is recycled in a later episode.  This is a common complaint I have about the complete series.  There are a lot of recycled skits.

The ""Before it was a show"" feature is a grainy collection of stand-up footage.  The ""Best of Mr Show"" includes a variety of skits with a faux voice-over news broadcast.  One of the better skits is the ""Titanica"" skit that is also recycled in a later episode.

The original TV spots are also included.  Most of the spots are 30 seconds but there is one extended spot, ""Behind the scenes with Mr. Show.""

There are also hilarious text bios of Bob and David.  The season two disk does not include any special features.

The season three special features include a great onstage sketch with mock hecklers from the 1997 comedy arts festival.  There is also a funny recycling of the ""Drugachusettes"" skit that includes the music but none of the dialogue.  The 8 TV spots that are included show how willing they were to make fun of themselves.  There's a great boxing parody, ""Bob vs. David,"" and the calendar spot pokes fun at the show's unusual time-slot.

The second disk of season three also includes some more text bios and a feature that is a collection of Mr. Show skits from seasons one and two.  As a part of this complete collection it is redundant.

Season four includes a bloopers feature comprised of a lot of re-takes from seasons 1-3 with various cursing montages mixed in.  There's also an unseen version of a Ronnie Dobbs arrest.

The best feature from season four is the ""Mr. Show Jukebox.""  The songs featured in the show are accessible via a menu.  Unlike the episodes themselves, they actually do include a ""play all"" feature with the jukebox.

THE PACKAGING

Most of the time, packaging is an afterthought.  With DVD sets, packaging matters.  This set's packaging has both positives and negatives.  The disks themselves are held in place by locking plastic holders within folding cardboard books.  The disks are protected from being scratched.  However, those cardboard books have to be slid in and out of cardboard sleeves for each season.  These sleeves are easily frayed and not the best design for easy access to these disks.  Actually removing the disks is also hard because the plastic locking mechanisms are almost too secure.  All the seasons fit in a convenient box.  I just wish those cases had been replaced with a better design.

CONCLUSION

This set is a great value for those who enjoy satire and sketch comedy, and aren't afraid of vulgar or politically incorrect humor.  Considering the amount of content, it's a great value.  It can certainly be a gift for anybody that likes unorthodox comedy or satire.  I wish they would have improved the DVD authoring and included more features, but the content is worth having despite those minor annoyances.  Give this show a try.

Enjoy.",1261872000,21,6549,5.048598130841121
2469995,5,B000CQQID0,"Mr. Show show is second only to Dave Chapelle, which means SOME parts are not as funny as Dave, who isn't always funny, either.  Nobody is always funny.  If you can tolerate recent SNL, you probably aren't a Mr. Show fan.  If you consider SCTV, Steve Martin, and Steven Colbert funny, you will like Mr. Show.  If you watch the herd of Americans gobbling up the ideas fed to them by the media along with their Super Double Bacon Burger and get angry or worried, then you will want to watch Mr. Show.
Mr. Show is meta-media.  It starts with all forms of American media -- from TV ads to 1920's songs -- and then duplicates them in funny ways.  Political ads. COPS. Local news. You name it. Like a political cartoon that copies and exaggerates the features of its target, Mr. Show emulates the show, to show you what you have been watching and possibly believing.  One sketch has TV covering TV covering TV, like nested Russian dolls or the Morton Salt girl.
If you can remember the old SNL ad for Triple Track razors, ""because you'll believe anything,"" that's the tone.  Like SCTV's Guy Caballero, the seedy, corrupt, phony, yet utterly beguiling underbelly of the media and our hypnotized gullibility are the targets. The sketches about music awards are especially hilarious.  If you think the French guy's painting, ""This is not a pipe,"" is even kind of funny, you will laugh at Mr. Show.  The angry bitterness of David Cross is mellowed by the cynical, hate-filled Bob Odenkirk.  Ultimately, we are the target of their humor because we have allowed, even encouraged, the inanity and duplicity of the shows we watch.  Mr. Show, like Yogi Berra's estimate of opera, is better than it sounds.  Look for Sara Silverman in the blowing up the moon segment, in which a monkey unpatriotically questions the point of the mission, triggering a media backlash.",1261526400,,1850,4.708074534161491

I really dug Monty Python and Kids In The Hall back then but when I saw the first episode of Mr. Show it struck my sense of humor perfectly, even though I watched Python and the Kids I always found 2 or 3 sketches per show to be boring.  With Mr. Show there's maybe 2 or 3 sketches that are boring throughout the shows existence.  There are jokes here to please everyone, plus the hundreds of little things that can take a mildly funny scene and turn it into comedy genius...probably accidental comedy genius.  Droopy, Senator Howel Tankerbell, Talking Junkie, T.T.O.M.O and Ronnie Dobbs are all here to turn your ""Sun""days into ""Fun""days.

If I had 3 wishes 1 of them would be that Mr. Show was still going strong today.  HBO really blew it by switching the show to Monday nights, it's what made Bob wanna stop doing the show.  David says he was tired of the show regardless of the day change, but I'd like to think if HBO took more pride in their work they'd still be doing the show now.

When watching the show I always wondered who is Bob Odenkirk and why he keeps on popping up in the show. When listening to the commentry I found out about Mr Show.

I watched a couple skits on Youtube and they blew my socks off, especially two skits: Globochem and It's Insane, This Guys Taint.

After getting the box set watching every episode again, it's all gold with very few misses. It's a strange thing to see such a good American sketch show run for such a short time, almost as long as British counterparts. Which means very little recycled comedy and relativley low amount of misses.

It's a very adult comedy with the cast using almost every expletive under the sun with no beeps, another touch of realism. This is definatly a show the FCC would frown upon as every sketch pushed the boundries.
