1331349,5,B00003L9CR,This was an entertaining film that never quit with the humor. Phillips and Leon are very funny. The special effects could have been better.  I like how the cave scene is all dark then the heroes make a niose and the bats  eyes light the cave. SPOOKY!  I like the bat attack scenes because of  how they were filmed.  The film was well edited. The music appropriate and  the overall cast was good.  Could have been longer.  Mr. A,952387200,2,427,4.3164556962025316
1331350,3,B00003L9CR,"""Bats"" is a predictable and campy horror flick with a so-so cast that spouts off mind-numbing dialogue.  However, it's fun, exciting, and (at times) scary.  Not a good movie, but a good escape from the pressures  of life.",952041600,,221,4.7631578947368425
1331351,4,B00003L9CR,i don't know why everyone blazes this film up and down...now it wasn't exactly a masterpiece but it was at least decent enough to get made. those bats were some bad MoFo's and therefore were able to rip things apart with  ease. Lou Diamond Phillips was did a pretty decent job here as did  Leon...this movie was pretty raw since the bats were the main ones that  made this flick with support from Lou Diamond Phillips and Leon,951523200,,426,4.435897435897436

1331354,3,B00003L9CR,"It's hardly a great film, but Bats manages to be fun and fairly exciting without insulting the viewer.  The movie could have easily gone the horror-comedy route but is, thankfully, played straight.  If you are  interested enough to seek out a review of a movie called Bats then you  probably won't be disappointed in the product.  While I would never  attempt to pronounce another persons opinion as incorrect the preceding  reviews do contain some rather misleading information.  Bats bears little  resemblance to The Birds aside from the obvious fact that the antagonists  of both films have wings.  And the heroes most certainly do not simply  ""turn on a cooling device, hop in their truck and drive home.""  I  won't give away the ending but it is certainly more involved than that.  There is also a nifty parody on those lame ""Oh! The monster isn't  really dead,"" endings we're all accustomed to.  I'm looking  forward to the director's commentary on the DVD release.",950400000,2,971,4.888888888888889
1331355,1,B00003L9CR,"Bats, how many words are there to describe it. It was probably the worst movie i've ever seen next to Dudly Do-right. IT was a cheap rip off of of the movie ""the birds"" by alfred Hitchcock. The acting wasn't to  bad but the story line on the other hand was the worst. The ending was  stupid and there was no plot. They just ran around and did what ever, there  really was not point except to get rid of the bats, some stuff was taken  out of nowhere and just shoved into the movie. Well thanks.",947980800,13,494,4.061855670103093
1331356,1,B00003L9CR,"I love the old genre of B horror movies. In this respect being bad is kind of good. The reason B movies are attractive is that the funny lines, poor acting, and camera mistakes all illustrate the movie-making process in a  way that big-budget films hide at all costs. I might even be able to excuse  this film if it had a good ending, but it didn't. They set off some cooling  device and leave the cave, presuming they've killed all the bats. That's  it! No last-minute-bad-guy-scary-shot, no effects at all of the bats dying,  or chasing the protagonists, nothing. Let me say this again...they turn on  the cooling thing, they get in the truck, they drive home. Does that sound  like the end of a good movie?  This films one redeeming moment is the  gremlinesque bat invasion of the town. There is also a cool shot where  thousands of bats covering a truck all look to the camera at once revealing  thousands of red eyes. Other than these small glimmers of a good movie, I  was GREATLY dissapointed. However, I am a movie nut, and it looks like  they're packing this thing with features, so I may have to rent it and give  it a second chance.",947721600,7,1143,4.4326923076923075

1331423,3,B00003L9CR,"Released to USA theaters during Halloween in 1999, ""Bats"" is a nature-runs-amok flick about government-funded mutated bats that have escaped and are harassing the citizens of a West Texas town. The Sheriff (Lou Diamond Phillips) teams-up with a bat expert (Dina Meyer) and her amusing sidekick (Leon) to save the town and, actually, all of North America. Bob Gunton plays the semi-mad scientists who created the genetically-engineered diabolical creatures.

This is a solid creatures-on-the-loose movie with a quality cast and a lot of thrills, but it never rises above run-of-the-mill for a few reasons: For one, there's no interesting subtext. This is a film about mutated bats threatening a town and the people who try to vanquish them; that's it. While there's nothing wrong with such an approach, it can only be successful IF the creatures are interesting enough, like 1972's excellent ""Gargoyles,"" but I personally don't find bats that interesting. Don't get me wrong, the filmmakers did their best to make the creatures as malevolent, hideous and formidable as possible, but they're still bats. Another negative is that there's no female eye candy beyond the alluring main protagonist, Dina Meyer, and they don't do anything with her besides showcasing her stunning face. I'm not suggesting nudity or anything pornographic here -- not at all -- but professional filmmakers are able to take advantage of the female resources at their disposal and this film doesn't do that.

""Bats"" strikes me as a decent TV creature feature -- decent, not great or even really good -- and I find it hard to believe that it was a theatrical release.

The film runs 91 minutes and was shot in Utah.

1331445,2,B00003L9CR,"This movie has to be reviewed taking into consideration it's a B-movie. Even so, it is very annoying. The reason is the token black. After only five minutes of movie, we're already tired of the silly guy's idiotic jokes and comments, all done in a nauseating jive accent. Not to mention that the comments are totally out of place in situations where the characters are dealing with gruesome deaths. You hope the bats will soon kill him, but they don't. As a matter of fact, this review could be applied to 98% of American productions. I believe that this is the reason some tv series are being made set in the past, like Mad Men. This is to avoid this ""obligation"" of casting token blacks. Today, even Django is black. I wouldn't be surprised if for the next Tarzan movie they cast Wesley Snipes as Tarzan, Halle Berry as Jane, Will Smith's son as Boy, and who knows, Giselle Bundchen as cheetah.",1369094400,,896,4.537037037037037
1331446,5,B00003L9CR,"The filmmakers admit this was a homage to Hitchcock's The Birds.  While I did see some scenes that might have been influenced by that classic film, for the most part there is no similarity, just wishful thinking on their part.

BATS is primarily a formula film with stock characters and all the expected damage caused by the titled creatures.  Most of the action takes place at night for the obvious reason.  The bats in question are a bit vague, being portrayed differently throughout the film.  They're described as fruit bats, then flying foxes, also experimental creations that were altered by some unnamed virus, and they are omnivores.  A crazy doctor/mad scientist (Bob Gunton), is responsible for releasing just two of these (for undisclosed reasons).  The tricky part comes from the vast number of bats that show up to wreck havoc on this small town.  They're a bit sly on exactly when the two bats were released, forcing us to take it upon faith that they bred like crazy in the interim; the results now totaling in the b-zillions.  By the time they reach this miniscule Texas town, they're in a real snit.  The military wants to do what they always want to do in these types of films: bomb them to kingdom come.  Sheriff Lou, with the help of a bat expert (Dina Meyer) want to handle the situation themselves.........they want to freeze the bats to death.
The bats are overly manufactured puppets and electronic gizmos, just a step up from the corny bats on strings in old horror films.  There's not a scare to be had in this offering, just a fast paced descent into the ridiculous.  As luck would have it, I thoroughly enjoy garbage like this.  Being a huge fan of the genre involving animals on a rampage, I fell in love with this film immediately.  I had no problem adding it to my collection.  It's not a masterpiece by any means.  It was meant to entertain.  If you like killer animal flicks, you might also like this one too.  But I make no guarantees.",1367107200,,1969,4.60632183908046

1331451,5,B00003L9CR,"There's only so much of a boring Monday night game you can watch before you go B hunting if you're in the mood.  And when you're B hunting, if the name Chief Diamond Phillips doesn't catch your attention not much will. By the title we were automatically thinking of a creature feature along the lines of the legendary Python or Mosquito and being that this one is from 1999 we felt confident that we were in for a treat. It's simple math, Chief Diamond Phillips + creatures + golden era of B = super terrific happy hour. You know you're into something good when you check the Sid archives like five times during the movie to make sure we haven't reviewed it before. And really shame on us because this one wouldn't have lost out to anything on an old school Thursday. Yes that includes pranking the Rubenator.

Within the first two scenes of the movie all of our expectations seemed to be headed towards being met. You had the B hallmark of the opening scene with two teenagers in a car making out when something totally insane happens. These two kids are in their car when a crap ton of bats reign down blows upon them. These things are nuts. They bust through the windshield and tear the kids to pieces. This obviously causes quite a stir in tiny Gallup, TX and the local Sheriff, Chief Ddiamond Phillips, brings in some big guns because he wants to know what's going on and he wants to know NOW! A few bat experts are brought into town and it's quite the lineup. Dr. Alexander McCabe is a world renowned bat scientist played by Warden Norton. Then there is Dr. Sheila Casper played by Lucinda Nicholson, the teacher Brandon Walsh gave a scheff to and her assistant Jimmy played by the one and only Tommy Sheapard. Joining them was a guy from the Centers for Disease Control played by Ramon the pool guy. Right there we were in. So we find out that Warden Norton has mutated some bats to be viscous super intelligent man eaters. Thanks a pantload, Chet. And they also can infect other bats to become this way. These bats would descend and rip out jugulars like whoa. After a horrific attack on the townspeople including poor Ramon, Tommy Sheapard located the bats' hub in an old abandoned mine. At this point the Army got involved led by the Major, played by Eddie the twisted copywriter for the J. Peterman catalogue who wore, quite appropriately, fatigues instead of business attire. Their plan was to freeze the bats to death while inside the mine and then air strike those suckers. So it was up to Phillips and Dr. Sheila to go into the mine and turn on the freezing unit and if that failed, Tommy Shapard was to blow up the mine with dynamite before the Army air strike.

The freezing unit is successfully turned on and works but Sheapard blows the mine up anyway right after Phillips and Dr. Sheila get out. They get Major Eddie to call off the air strike and everybody is happy. You might ask why freeze them out and blow them up? Because its B baby. The lines were blurred at times in this one, though. At some points questions arose if this was a good movie or just superb B then Chief Diamond Phillips would appear, attempting a Texas accent and the answer became quite clear. Or when they went into the mine they wore Kevlar and steel reinforced suits and were still deathly afraid of the bats. These are the kinds of things that separate the men from the boys. This was a truly fantastic B. One of the best as a matter of fact. There was even one heck of an explosion at the end off the movie. We'd put Bats up there with any movie that doesn't have Swayze or McQueen in the credits. Do yourself a favor and check this one out. And Lou, keep cranking them out. You'll get at least one review every time out. More B, Chief Diamond Phillips?",1347926400,,3753,4.412698412698413

1331456,1,B00003L9CR,"Let's just come out and say it, this movie is very not good.  Not a single thing at all makes it a good movie.  The acting is terrible and the effects are worse.  The story takes the prize for being the most awful aspect of the production.  It has every single clich&eacute; possible in a horror type movie film.  I won't expressively list any but just think of one and I guarantee you will hear it in there (if you can make it through the entire thing).  Lou Diamond Phillips shoots at the bats with a revolver and is hitting them with ease.  It is things like these that make the movie so unbelievable.  Which does not necessarily mean a poor picture; it is that the movie takes its self too seriously.  Films like Tremors just have that ridiculousness to them that makes them fun.  ""STAB"" does not have that.  It is a chore to sit through the entire thing.  This is a Sci-Fi (SyFy) channel Saturday afternoon garbage movie at best.  And I'm not even a good critic, I thought Doom was good.  Nobody liked Doom.  The only reason I bought it is because a bat got into my girlfriend's apartment and we both thought that everything bat related was funny.  Sadly we were wrong.

1331457,2,B00003L9CR,"Bats (1999) Lock up the belfry for this particular offering. Let's start with the title. Four letters that tell you all you need to know. No ""Kingdom of the."" No ""Earth vs the."" Just Bats. A nice, direct title for an equally complexity-free film.
  When two genetically enhanced superintelligent mutant killer bats escape scientific custody and begin infecting Texas' normal bat population, it's up to small town sheriff Lou Diamond Phillips and ""batologist"" Dina Meyer to save the day. If they fail, the infected critters will migrate all over North America, spreading death and destruction everywhere they go.
  Aiding our heroic duo are the requisite stock characters for this kind of movie: the Sardonic African American Guy (Leon) who provides necessary comic relief with his stream of sarcastic comments; and the Crazy Scientist Guy (Bob Gunton) who started the whole mess in the name of science.
  As these things go, this is a serviceable thriller. The bats attack with adequate frequency, and the characters fulfill their scripted functions, and are performed earnestly by the actors. The effects are efficient, though unremarkable. In the olden days, a movie bat was pretty much always a rubber specimen on a variably visible string. The really high tech ones were windup and had flapping wings that went ""chaka-chaka-chaka."" Nowadays a mix of digital effects and animatronics brings them to life.
  The last Big Screen bat movie was 1979's Nightwing, with Nick Mancuso and David Warner battling the winged menaces. Both films obviously owe a lot to Alfred Hitchcock's The Birds, but Bats has an equally strong inspiration in 1990's Arachnophobia, which had one large spider mating with a common house spider, producing scads of deadly poisonous little arachnids.
  There are, of course, the expected plot holes. For example, a mine features prominently in the movie's plot. But it is never made clear just what kind of mine it is. A coal mine? A silver mine? A diamond mine? A gold mine? It's not dreadfully important, but is the kind of detail that spells out ""sloppy screenwriting"" when it's not provided. As a sidenote, Phillips assures his costars numerous times that there is only one entrance (and one entrance only) to this mine. But all mines that I have heard of always have a separate shaft to provide air circulation. Things that make you go `hmm.'
  To wrap this up--Bats is a competently made, but not very involving PG-13 thriller that is probably best as a scary treat for teens or older children.",1231977600,,2523,5.009569377990431

The major thing the film has going for it is that at least it knows its rubbish even though it does play it straight, even when the dialog is pure z-movie (""Yes, major - it was us!""). The characters are standard issue: Lou Diamond Philips is the small town Texas sheriff hiding a dark secret (he's an opera fan), Dina Mayer the bat expert whose insistence that she could never willing hurt a bat translates into killing hundreds of the suckers while Bob Gunton's the mad scientist who genetically enhanced the vicious little bloodsuckers. Why? ""Because I'm a scientist. That's what we do.""

Naturally, the bats head for the nearest town showing a revival of Nosferatu (it doesn't state whether its Murnau or Herzog, but clearly small town Texans have eclectic arthouse tastes), and this being Texas, where everybody knows everything about everything and immediately fill the streets with expendable extras for the obligatory Bodega Bay scene. Of course, these deadly bats only need to take one swoop and bite out of the bit players to take them out of the movie, but can swarm all over one of the leading players and leave them only mildly scratched, just as it's a well know movie fact that being attacked by any flying creature brings on a bad case of weird camera effects, and this one ups The Swarm's slow motion with a misaligned lens: once your image is distorted, you'd better have your affairs in order Junk, but watchable junk.",1142985600,4,1708,4.750841750841751

1331464,1,B00003L9CR,"I caught this movie last night on HBO. Unfortunately, I soon came to realize through my side-splitting laughter: This is NOT a comedy. It is actually an attempt at a horror movie. As my laughter slowly subsided, I concluded that this movie would have to make my list of 'all time worst movies', ranking right up there with Tank Girl and Plan 9 From Outer Space.

From what i could gather from the rather drab and non-existant plot, a cave of monster bats have been awakened by a military operation with some sort of super cooling unit. Now, they are mad and hungry and killing people. One thing leads to another, with events that you can see coming a mile away. The ending fits nicely between predictable and utterly stupid. And now, on to those vicious, scary creatures....THE BATS! (Hint: sarcasm)

First of all, if you know anything about bats, you know they use sonar to see. And if you have ever seen the movie Predator, my favorite movie, you will notice the rip offs right away. The bats see in what looks exactly like the Predator's Infrared, not to mention they make the EXACT same clicking sound that was one of the trademarks of the Predator. These 'monster bats' were about 8 times the size of a normal bat, and had to be probably the most poorly animated, goofiest looking puppet work i have ever seen. The 'special effects' were non-existant. Must have been a low budget film, because when the flock of bats would fly by, it pretty much looked like a mudslide with a few flapping animations thrown in for good measure.

What would posess someone to make a movie like this is beyond me. Don't get me wrong, every now and then i enjoy watching a bad movie, just for the sheer appreciation of the work that went into making it so bad. But this movie...I don't think i can ever watch it again. For the first movie i've seen Lou Diamond PHilips be in for the past 5 or so years, you think he could've done something better.

The bottom line is: Whether you are a horror fan or an action fan, a suspense or thriller fan, whatever it is you like about movies....then you will NOT like this movie. It was clearly aimed toward the impulsive desires of every 12 year old kid out there, which is senseless blood and gore. The acting is terrible. The plot is non-existant. The special effects....well...actually....there were none, unless you count the computer effects that an unskilled computer tech could throw together in about 2 hours. Just AVOID this movie if you know whats good for you. Young kids may enjoy it, but if you have any sense and have the capability to determine the qualities of a decent movie, then avoid this at all costs. Go see The Birds or something similair instead.",1102291200,5,2695,4.539094650205762

It is a warm summer night. Two Texas teens are making out in a car in the middle of nowhere. Suddenly, they are attacked by a thousand bats that look like winged gargoyles. Meanwhile, Dr. Sheila Casper [Dina Meyer] is in the Arizona desert with her goofy assistant, Jimmy [Leon], doing whatever a bat scientist does. As she says, ""I'm a scientist! That's what I do!"" Before she can get any bat research done, she is hauled off to Texas by the Center for Disease Control. There, she views the remains of the aforementioned teens and, of course, announces that bats are incapable of doing such a thing. What she doesn't know is that these bats have been genetically altered by an Evil Scientist. Now it is up to her and the local sheriff, Emmett Kimsey [Lou Diamond Phillips], to save the world. Does any of this sound familiar?
I must admit that I am not afraid of bats. All summer long they can be seem flying around my neighborhood at night. I am more fearful of mosquitoes, which they eat, than I am of them. But even if bats did give me the willies, the ones in this movie wouldn't cause my heart to race. It has some of the worst computer generated effects on record. When they swarm through the sky, there is no illusion of depth, which means they don't look real.

This is, by far, the worst performance of his career. I can't believe he even agreed to this ridiculous bigotry-stereotyped role. I expected much better of him.
Overall, the film was not terrible. It wasn't good either. But it is good enough to sit through without changing the channel (I wouldn't pay to see it). The acting actually wasn't that bad, and the writing was decent. The special effects were horrible though. The F/X guys couldn't seem to decide on exactly how big the bats were supposed to be. In the beginning, they appeared to be about the size of normal bats with a 12"" wingspan. But in some of the 1-on-1 attacks on people (this was the worst part of the movie), they appeared to be 40+ lb monsters with 4-ft wingspans! And the close-up shots of the bats were so dumb. They didn't look like bats at all. They looked like plastic toys with moving gears.
Another bad part of the movie was the jumping around of the camera. During the most intense scenes, the camera jumped from scene-to-scene so fast, you couldn't make out exactly what they were supposed to be showing. Calm it down on the camera jumps fellas. Quick jumps don't add to the intensity; they just make you dizzy. This was definitely the dizziest I'd been since forcing myself to sit through an entire showing of Blair Witch without vomiting.
I still don't understand why directors feel the need to personify deadly creatures in horror movies today. The stupid head and eye movements and cunning (crawling up your back) of the bats was simply unbelievable. This reminded me a lot of the worst creature-horror movie, Anaconda. If you thought the bats looked too silly to be real, you'll get a real kick out of that stupid snake. Anaconda was more like a cartoon than a motion picture. And somebody PAID to see that garbage?

But-- surprise, surprise-- this was amazingly not the case.  The bat effects are plentiful and effective, the cinematography and direction are competent, and the acting isn't bad (I especially liked Dina Meyer, whose natural performance actually made you believe she was an expert on bats).  Let's be clear, however.  Don't expect characterizations of particular depth or clever plot twists, 'cause you ain't getting that stuff.  This is basically a 90-minute movie about bats attacking people, but on that score it delivers.  Oh, yes- the movie DEFINITELY gained points for giving us ONE twist, a subversive variation of the old ""last shot of the movie showing us that one of the menaces has SURVIVED"" cliche; just when you think you're going to see that same old scene again, something else happens, and it's a riot.  The DVD has loads of extras, including a hilarious commentary track by the director and Lou Diamond Phillips.  Definitely recommended as a rental, and if you're a big fan of schlocky but effective horror movies like ""Tremors"" and ""Lake Placid"", don't hesitate to buy ""Bats"".

I think one of the biggest perks in the movie was Leon Robinson's character  Jimmy. This guy made me laugh throughout the whole movie with his  wisecracks.
The only thing that really disappointed me was that you  didn't really get to see the bats all that much. Sure, there were several  close-up parts, but for these kind of ""intelligent"" bats I was  hoping to see a little more close-up shots.
The acting was pretty decent  all around, not one of Lou Diamond's best.  The storyline and plot were  pretty decent as well, although most hardcore horror fans are sure to be  disappointed. One thing in this movie that made it good was the ending.  What a teaser! If you see it you'll know what I mean.

This movie is about a mad scientist, whose experiments with bats  goes horribly wrong--(like in most monster movies you see now days).

Granted, I didn't watch this movie with that many expectations, but but even what few I had were dashed.  BATS is just another bad, cliche-ridden film with a stupid script having  people doing stupid things any semi-intelligent person would never do.  Cliches:  must there ALWAYS be one character who  serves the purpose of comic relief?  Even if we must have one, actor Leon,  as Jimmy spouts unfunny drivel I don't believe even he thinks is funny.  No  spoiler needed here, folks: the evil mad scientist dies.  And don't forget  the needed backup generator that of course won't start on the first few  tries!  People doing stupid things:  the zoologist and sheriff on a bridge near the bat nest.  Near dusk. The  zoologist removing her protective helmet in the mine.  Oh, let's not forget  that nobody even thinks of beating the crap out of the ""evil  scientist"" to divulge the information that he has and they need and  won't give up...even after the sheriff loses his deputy/friend to the bats.
  Stupid script:  humans who can outrun bats, especially in a  mine shaft and they're weighed down with protective outfits. the government  official who won't wait until dawn to send in troops, only to have them  slaughtered.  The zoologist who can ""hear"" approaching bats to  warn a town of their imminent attack, yet can't hear when one is mere  inches from her head.  And can even the US army get a paper copy of a  needed satellite confirmation within about 5 seconds?  Lastly (and one of  my favorites), is the ""evil scientist's"" explanation for what  he's done (creating the diseased/mutant bats):  "" Because I'm a  scientist.  That's what we do.""
  Stupid in no  particular category:  the bats. Extremely cheesy and phony-looking, as were  the other special effects.  WHERE did the money for this movie go!
On the plus side, the lead acting is pretty good.  I'm not familiar with  Dina Meyer, but she is quite believable and good in the cliched role of  scientist who must relunctantly come to kill a species of animal that she  admires. And I usually don't care for Lou Diamond Phillip's performances,  but he does a good job with a bad script.  Decent acting  however is not enough to pull this movie up from being a ""C""  movie.  There can be little worse for a lover of monster movies ,even of  the fun/trashy kind (me), than a monster movie that is not the least bit  scary or even fun.

If this describes you, then I am one with  you, brother.  There is always hope, and we've probably sat through a lot  worse with little more than hope and a bag of popcorn to keep us  company.
Personally, I prefer a bit of humor in my not-so-good monster  movies.  I didn't find much intentional humor in this movie - but it  definitely is a movie that invites one to bring one's own humor along.  Given that, a good time can be had by all.
I could start with a criticism  of the science in this movie.  Nah!  They didn't bother with any of that  science stuff, so why should I.  But, I do have to mention that they  definitely have incorrectly identified the species of bats in this flick.  On close inspection, these bats are definitely Mexican Hairless Bats, a  subgroup of the Rubberus Gargoylius species. Fortunately, or unfortunately,  (however the feather tickles you,) fancy camera work keeps most of the  Gargoylius close-ups at bay.
The plot is self-explanitory in the title.  Suffice it to say, that a crazy, evil scientist-type man messes with bats  - bats goes on a killing spree, and have crazy, evil scientist-type man for  dessert.  There is even a robot-like military-type man who wants  everything to go BOOM.  Even though these are such original ideas, the  movie makers went wrong somewhere.  I think the where was when the  production budget couldn't afford to cover their Mexican Hairless's with,  at least, a little felt.
I wouldn't have missed this movie for a million  bucks!  I definitely will buy it.  Why?  Because I had fun.  You should  not miss seeing it either.  Not watching this flick is like forsaking your  own stupid culture.",954374400,2,1843,4.682389937106918

Bats are plaguing Texas, a self-xplanatory title.
The computer-generated bats, who glide swiftly  and attack with cunning, cannot save this film from complete disaster.  Neither can the star, Lou Diamond Phillips.
Phillips not only seems out  of place as the Sheriff of Gallup Texas, but completely off key the entire  film, in his own little world, and relating little to his supporting cast.
At his side, Dina Meyer conveys a somewhat reasonable role of the bat  specialist enlisted to help deal with the situation. Unfortunately, she  does little the entire film and I really don't understand her role when  there were apparently already two bat specialists on the case.
I miss the  old horror days, that took more to wit than making its monsters believable,  and they surely have vanished. In their place we have ""Bats"", and  that doesn't say much for its future, if any exists.",954028800,2,989,4.903614457831325

However you have to admit that the close-ups show such little cuties that only a mother could love them. And the mad scientist makes faces that look like Peter Sellers in ""Dr. Strangelove or ""How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb"" (1964).

At one point they decide that the bats are intelligent (e=(mc*2)). So when they thought about cooling off the little critters. I had this vision that a farmer saying that the bats had snatched his sheep bald. And the next scene is of all these bats wearing cardigan sweaters.

The plot is simple and straightforward; get rid of the bats. Some may say that this is a bat plot. But I say it is good.

By using batteries and fencing to protect a building, the movie looked like a cross between a bug zapper and the old James Arness ""The Thing"" movie where he is the vegetable from outer space. Sometimes I think the actors winged it. The graphics were great. You could tell they were graphics and did not have to guess wither it was real or Memorex.

7919012,5,B00003L9CR,"Bats isn't a film of the highest quality which is understandable since the topic is about vicious genetically mutated bats that try to overtake an entire small town and eventually the world.  What Bats does well certainly doesn't lie in the hard to watch and *extremely* cliched story or the subpar acting, or the fact Lou Diamond Philips feels totally wrong as a sheriff.  Maybe he's not comfortable with that role but he's really lousy in this movie.  Every word he says comes across as bland to me.

What Bats does right is suddenly morph into a *very* action-packed suspense if you're willing to wait through 25 minutes of cliched writing.  I don't quite think this movie is scary.  Again the story and acting are a detriment.  At least the bats themselves are quite intimidating.  So I guess at the very least, the gremlin-resembling bats look a little scary.  This movie gets dramatically better as soon as Lou Diamond Phillips, Dina Meyer (who plays a zoologist) and Leon Robinson's character try to stop a bat invasion at a small town.

What happens when the bats attack is a LOT of destruction!  One explosion after another as trucks drive into parked cars, buildings and people.  Lou hides under a car and tries to shoot the bats as they approach.  Of course he doesn't get attacked whereas the rest of the town does, haha.  Dina heads into a grocery store where one single bat is hanging around waiting for her (with squeaky disturbing sounds to boot).  I like this scene.  The special effects are really cheesy throughout the movie, but I don't necessarily hate them.  The scene with the bats flying in front of the bright moon comes to mind, or the cliched moment that occurs later when Dina and Lou head into a cave and we see the entire colony of bats hang on the ceiling.  Anybody that knows anything about bats knew this scene was coming.

So how do they go about eliminating these bats, you're probably wondering?  Turns out bats don't like cold temperatures.  At least not these mutated ones.  I know where I live they don't really like the cold either.  Some hibernate and some don't, but this isn't about real life bats!  Turns out there's a cooling unit that can be used to stop the bats at once, but Lou and Dina don't have a lot of time to turn it on with the military pressuring them since they're ready to bomb the area in less than an hour.

Of course you probably guessed- Lou and Dina run out of the cave with the bats hot on their trail (which is hilarious since the bats should easily be able to fly up to them instantly) and more explosions follow.  It gets a little ridiculous with the amount of explosive scenes by this point, one after another, but Lou and Dina have to hurry up and activate the cooling unit before the military destroys the cave the wrong way, releasing the bats to not only the nearby town but the world.

Leon Robinson's character is really bad.  He plays an easily scared and jumpy African American assistant zooologist.  Very predictable character.  Bob Gunton plays the crazy scientist responsible for the genetically mutated bats, and a slight twist is that he isn't here to help the zoologists stop the bats but rather, help the bats eliminate the world.  He only pretends to team up with the zoologists.  Wow, he must have been one of those nerds who was picked on by bullies as a kid and spent decades locking himself away and planning to take his revenge on all human life.  At one point he makes a foolish mistake thinking the bats aren't ripping his face part because they're responding to him.

Otherwise it's nice to see the bats pick at people's throats like vultures.  It's nice the bats attack people instantly.  The action is quite high and awesome.  Still, this movie can't escape the low budget Syfy style.  The cliches are abundant.  How about the little boy who stands in the middle of the street shocked and frightened at the bats causing all sorts of destruction, and then a woman walks by, picks the boy up and carries him off.  Or after the bats have taken flight.  We see what's going on in the nearby town- a man eating a meal, a woman hanging laundry in the middle of the night (who hangs laundry in the middle of the night?) and a chef taking a break by walking outside only to get attacked.  Cliched moments like these are all over, but still a pretty good movie.",1482192000,,4347,4.5347043701799485
