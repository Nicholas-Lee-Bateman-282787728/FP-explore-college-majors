It will touch your heart I promise.

I just wish I could find it in a modern digital format!",1484006400,,295,3.983050847457627
7879708,5,6304887035,"I have owned a copy this tape for several years, and found it compelling, informative, funny and sad.  I purchased the recent copy as a gift for a young friend, also an animal lover.  I hope he enjoys it as much as I have.",1453507200,3,222,4.0227272727272725

7879711,5,6304887035,I had been looking for People of the Forest for years.  I used to have it on personal vhs but someone taped over it.  I'm so glad I was able to find it here.  The video quality is perfect.,1373155200,,188,3.769230769230769
7879712,5,6304887035,"This amusingly narrated movie about the life of a troop of chimpanzees is one of my favorite movies of all time.  You can watch this over and over again.  While I'm sure this production is guilty of a touch of anthropomorphization, it's nonetheless a good buy.  I'm here writing this review because I want this on DVD.  This is one of my favorite movie purchases of all time.

If you're sick of handing money to the Hollywood machine for more Ben Affleck movies, buy this quality entertainment.",1093305600,8,494,4.632183908045977
