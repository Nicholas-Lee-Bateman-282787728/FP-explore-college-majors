8700951,2,B00T8N4LA0,"Kill Kate - also known as Checkmate and Deep Cover  is a so-so vehicle for Cynthia Rothrock. Id probably have given it three stars, were it not for its exclusive availability as a censored German release. Ambitious in some regards but disappointing in others, this is almost a throwaway vehicle for Rothrock and not really worth a purchase. Collectors take note: this release does not include the original English audio track, only the German one.

The story: An unscrupulous arms dealer (Stephen Nichols,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Heaven-s-Tears/dp/B0007PRMZ4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Heaven's Tears</a>) enacts an elaborate plot to ensnare the FBI agent (Rothrock) who killed his brother.

The screenplay is the real cincher as to whether youll like this movie. Writer Tony Calabrese seems determined to craft a different take on the standard action flick, but his ambitions are misdirected. For one thing, the story focuses so much on the villain that Rothrock has no opportunity to get her personality across and ends up looking like a supporting character in her own film. Character twists are frequent and the villain displays a bit more cunning than the average bad guy, but none of the characters are particularly interesting. Worse yet, theres an abundance of racist dialogue, misogyny, and sexual scenes that do nothing to further the story. Add to that the fact that the production has that bland, made-for-TV look about it and youll find yourself pressing the fast-forward button a lot.

One of the films few highlights is its action content. Rothrock had previously brought in choreographer Tak Yuen (AKA Douglas Kung) to spice up the fight scenes of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sworn-to-Justice/dp/B00005LP3O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sworn to Justice</a>, and he reappears here in the same capacity to vitalize the fistfights. He does an even better job this time, with some of the fights all but looking like something that would have come out of Hong Kong in the late 80s. Disappointingly, some of the violence has been clumsily trimmed by the German distributors, so you cant even enjoy it to its fullest extent. (SPOILER) For the most part, the editing is limited to gunshots, but it also entirely removes the shots wherein Rothrock kills the lead villain and his lieutenant (Alex Hyde-White,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Pretty-Woman/dp/B00081U7HC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Pretty Woman</a>).

This isn't the worst two-star rating that Ive ever given, but the combination of the films shortcomings and those of the DVD make it inevitable. I cant recommend Kill Kate for anyone but the staunchest German-speaking Rothrock fans, so probably don't bother.",1468800000,,2818,5.880195599022005
