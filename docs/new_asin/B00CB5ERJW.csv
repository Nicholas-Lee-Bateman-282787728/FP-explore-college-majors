5710967,5,B00CB5ERJW,I like to watch Soap Operas to improve my Spanish.  Some of them are just too silly to watch.  This one keeps your attention.  I give it 5 stars for a Soap Opera.,1379548800,,162,3.8484848484848486
5710968,4,B00CB5ERJW,Saw the original.  The edited version was very well done considering the amount of side stories that had to be eliminated.  Enjoyed it very muchy,1378512000,,145,4.76
5710969,2,B00CB5ERJW,"I watched this novela on-line in its entirety.  As well as on television.  The dvd is done very poorly a lot of scenes have been cut out.  If you seen this before the dvd seems like has been put on fast forward.  Major scenes are cut yet mentioned so if you haven't seen this before it would only confuse you and lose total interest in the story.  What a shame since this is the best novela with so many different scenes and characters yet these scenes and characters have been cut out.  Poor Work on such a beautiful Novela!! The only feature I liked was you did not have to watch it with the English sub-titles, since I do speak and understand Spanish, I did not need to use that feature.",1377993600,,690,4.229007633587786
5710970,4,B00CB5ERJW,"Great original story. Lot's of important scenes that were ommitted which was disappointing. I would prefer to pay more to get the full nonedited version, but cutting out a lot of the scenes seems to be a trend.",1377648000,,210,4.552631578947368
5710971,4,B00CB5ERJW,This telenovela was incomplete.  I have been watching the television version and noticed that scenes were missing.  Otherwise it was great.,1377475200,,139,5.571428571428571
5710972,5,B00CB5ERJW,"had to buy this novella.  Best looking couple. the ending is superb. Everyone got what they deserved, esp. the bad guys.",1376870400,,120,4.714285714285714
5710973,1,B00CB5ERJW,"I had watch it before and was dying to have the dvd but they CUT MAJOR scenes.
Very disappointing!!!

If i knew that was the case i should had kept watching it in hulu or online. I don't know if my dvds are malfunctioning but honestly i think they did the work edit job.
Great scenes of camila and daniel were cut.

Anyway.....",1376611200,3,327,4.174603174603175
5710974,5,B00CB5ERJW,"I watched this telenovela first run, and it was a good show.  The story is excellent -- low-key, well plotted, and it moves very fast without much FF-fodder.

The cast is good; both the leads (Silvia Navarro and Cristi&aacute;n de la Fuente) are seriously good and attractive.  Leticia Calder&oacute;n won the Best Female Villain for the year for this role.

It was kind of a sleeper at first, in a way; not a lot of hype, but then people started getting involved in it and wound up very attached to it from what I saw of its Facebook posts.  I would watch it again all the way through.

The setting is wonderful; ranch country, but still in the state of Mexico -- which is a location they don't show much.  Normally, what we see in the state of Mexico is only the Federal District.  Who knew some of it has a rural character.  It's lovely.",1375660800,,840,4.367741935483871
5710975,4,B00CB5ERJW,"I watch telenovelas because I teach Spanish and I need to hear the language every day. So I watch Univision while I'm bicycling. When I've liked a show, I buy the DVD so I can listen to it over and over again. Amor Bravio was fun to watch, and it's easy to listen to over and over again, as opposed to some telenovelas, which are just plain horrible. I did finally figure out that they must put some noxious chemical in their eyes. When they want to cry, they squeeze their eyes shut, and the fluid runs down their cheeks. I never cried the way they do on telenovelas. It's not that I'm not emotional. I could just never produce so much fluid!",1373068800,8,643,4.235772357723577
5710976,4,B00CB5ERJW,"Estoy super ansioso porque llegue la Fecha en que sale a la Venta el DVD de Amor Bravio. Tengo muchisimas ganas de Tener el DVD ya en mis manos y poder disfrutarlo al maximo. Me Encanta esta Telenovela, Es Exelente!!! Amor Bravio cuenta con un Exelente Elenco como: Silvia Navarro, Cristian de La Fuente, Leticia Calderon, Cesar Evora, Flavio Medina, Laura Carmine, entre otros, sin duda es una de las Mejores Telenovelas de los Ultimos Tiempos. La Historia es super entretenida, muy dinamica, te atrapa y te mantiene muy espectante.
Espero que el Resumen al igual que la Duracin valgan la pena y que contenga las partes ms importantes de la Telenovela.
Soy Fan de Silvia Navarro, me parece una Exelente Actriz, por otro lado creo que Lety Calderon hizo un Exelente Papel como Villana con el Personaje de Isadora. Silvia Navarro y Cristian de La Fuente tienen muy buena quimica y hacen una lindisima pareja.
No dejen de Comprar el DVD y de Disfrutar de esta Maravillosa Telenovela que los va a atrapar y emocionar con las Hermosas Escenas de Silvia Navarro y Cristian de La Fuente, asi como tambien van a odiar a Isadora/Leticia Calderon por su Magnifica Actuacion jeje.
Review: Me Gusto Mucho el DVD pero siento que le falto algo. La Edicin es buena pero no es la mejor, se omiten muchos detalles importantes de la Historia. Al igual que el DVD de Teresa en la Escena Final no sale el Logo de ""Fin"". No se porque pero no lo tiene.
En sintesis el DVD es bueno, vale la pena pero para ser sincero yo hubiera dejado mas escenas de Isadora y algunas partes que son mucho mas importantes que las que tiene el DVD.
No voy a decir que quitaria las Escenas de relleno porque no las tiene, toda la Telenovela es buena e interesante pero yo hubiera hecho un Disco mas.
La Duracion del DVD es de 15 Horas y 25 Minutos, tiene la Entrada y Salida Original, y la Musicalizacion es exactamente como se transmitio en Television.",1367193600,7,1913,4.563953488372093
5710981,5,B00CB5ERJW,"Amor Bravio is One Of My Top-Three Favorite Telenovelas and is one of THE BEST Telenovelas. It would be a three-way tie between Amor Bravio, Amores Verdaderos, and Te Voy A Ensear A Querer (STILL Not Available On DVD!). Gorgeous Actors, Surprisingly Good Acting + Writing, and Outstanding Pop Soundtracks made this and the others pop and the secondary and tertiary characters are actually likable and respectable on their own power.  There is some condensation of some material which originally S-T-R-E-T-C-H-E-D Out Over Multiple Episodes but on the whole it's all here and all the parts you really care about are here.  Packaging is about as lazy, cheap, and unimaginative as they could get away with but discs arrived in mint condition with no problems.",1448236800,,756,5.04
5710982,4,B00CB5ERJW,"I can only say that the dvd looks fine and arrived before predicted by seller. I haven't watched it yet. I bought another soap opera La Otra by Juan Soler and just recently watched it, and for my surprise the second dvd was damaged and couldn't watch most of the last episode of it. I was disappointed, but there was nothing I could do because I didn't watch it right away. Hopefully this will be fine.",1443916800,,402,4.302631578947368

5710996,5,B00CB5ERJW,"I gave this condensed edition of the TV series to my bedbound daughter.  She had enjoyed it so much, but I was afraid that they had cut out some parts that were essential to the story.  Whether it didn't make any difference to her because she still had the long version on her mind, or whether she's just glad that at least it was released for sale, it is now part of her video collection that she is very grateful for and so am I.",1393718400,,431,4.0588235294117645
5710997,4,B00CB5ERJW,"Quando monda el coraz&oacute;n (When the Heart Commands  925 minutes)

Wow! Christi&aacute;n de la Fuente is a major find! Of course I already appreciate the talent and beauty of Silvia Navarro, but I've never seen Fuente before. (But I will again!)

We start with two happy couples, both of them stable and in love: One in Chile and one in Mexico. Before we are even halfway through the first disc, their lives have crumbled...by death in a car wreck and in an assassination attempt in which the wrong person dies.

Now our heroine is coping with grief and our hero is in jail for killing his wife. This wrongful conviction seems to be driven by his former brother-in-law; due to political pressure, our hero can't even hire a lawyer! In the meantime, our heroine, three years after the fatal car crash that killed her fianc&eacute; (she was driving), has carefully agreed to a marriage arranged by her beloved uncle. By the way, our hero is the one who lives in Chile and our heroine in Mexico. When the uncle died, the family discovered to its shock, that he left his valuable real estate to the fellow in Chile, who may or may not be his illegitimate son, and he made his highly ethical niece the executor of the will.

By the time our hero breaks out of jail and makes his way to Mexico to collect his inheritance, we have discovered that our heroine is married to a selfish worm, so our minds dash ahead and start to assemble a happy ending, although we have no idea how many challenges our lovers will face!

This has great dialogue, particularly with the two villains, as they manipulate their many victims. These two have particularly satisfying ends! This has nice, intelligent people doing the very best they can as they are confronted by the many trials and tribulations that life has to offer.

Bravo!  (I never saw the telenovela and I am accustomed to filling the blanks when the editing is rough.)",1392681600,,1913,4.605882352941176

5710999,4,B00CB5ERJW,I loved the telenovela.  I'm disappointed that the DVD couldn't be longer and contain more of the full novella.  I understand the reasons because of costs and time but it does make the incredible show choppier.  I'm enjoying it anyway.  I enjoy the actors and the story.,1381017600,,270,4.680851063829787
