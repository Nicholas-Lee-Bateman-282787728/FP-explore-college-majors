8732586,5,B0153W1ZKI,"I absolutely love Pop Physique and have been attending their classes/using their DVDs for years. This is probably one of my favorite workouts of theirs. It's challenging, fast-paced, and effective, and it truly makes you feel good (a little sore, too, which is also good).

I've always found Pop Physique to be a great complement to my running; it works many of the muscles running 'ignores,' and gives me a stronger core. It's been an essential part of my overall training for yearsI honestly feel a (not good) difference in my running if I don't do Pop Physique at least 2 or 3 times a week.",1500854400,2,593,4.59433962264151

8732589,1,B0153W1ZKI,weird video - sorry I made the purchase.,1483747200,,40,4.125
8732590,3,B0153W1ZKI,"I'm addicted to going to barre class everyday, as well as buying every barre DVD. I go to The Bar Method which I've become accustomed to and have all they're DVDs as well. I have to say that while this is a signature barre DVD, there seemed to be something lacking and it seemed a bit rushed. While there are core moves in every barre class, there is always a signature that a specific brand has. I didn't feel that here. And I also felt very rushed. I think I'm going to skip this one for now and continue exploring other barre DVDs.",1482278400,2,534,4.194174757281553
8732591,5,B0153W1ZKI,"This workout is great!  I have have other barre, pure barre, pilates inspired dvds and this is best.  The workout is fast paced so you are getting more bang for buck with your workout.  I am a fitness instructor and I am impressed with the choreography of this video.",1468972800,8,267,4.408163265306122
8732592,5,B0153W1ZKI,i love the pop physique workout and having the video at home gives me an extra option,1468368000,2,85,4.0588235294117645
8732593,5,B0153W1ZKI,"I have done a lot of Bar Method and Pure Barre classes (both live and dvd) and I find them effective but they get boring and they seem almost completely interchangeable. I find Pop Physique to be a little more entertaining, just as effective, and maybe more ballet-inspired (in a good way). This barre workout is refreshing!",1459728000,10,324,4.701754385964913
