368309,4,6301797973,"When Mel Brooks and Harvey Korman are on screen together, I am in constant fits of laughter. The Psycho take off and the Werewolf bits are the funniest of all. I gave it 4 stars because there are a few dry spots,  without much comedy, and because Harvey didn't have as much to do as in  Blazing Saddles. But, on a whole, this film deserves a place on any  self-respecting Mel Brooks fan's video Library.",944265600,2,403,4.346666666666667

368368,4,6301797973,"This film is one of Mel's best overlooked gems.  Overlooked, perhaps, because it came out the same year a little movie called, ""Star Wars"" made a minor splash...

While the film is good, the blu ray print was not significantly better than the earlier DVD print, and has one other significant mistake: the release had no extras.  Specifically, I am referring to the Harvey Korman ""...Ahhh, this is an excellent brandy..."" scene.  While the theatrical version of this scene is intact, there is an even funnier extended version of that scene that was included in the television cut of the movie.  It should have been included.  Better yet, a version that offered both cuts would have been even better.

Still, well worth seeing as one of Brook's classic comedies...",1478822400,,762,4.8604651162790695
368369,3,6301797973,"A little funny, a little silly.  Kudos to Cloris Leachman and Harvey Korman, both of whom were great.  But in the end, there just wasn't that much to work with.  And one joke was missed that the script just screamed for.

(Warning: This next part is a spoiler) The joke that was missed was with Ron Carey's character.  The scene where Mel Brooks almost goes flying off the balcony of a high hotel floor but falls to the floor instead.  Carey's character should have grabbed him, yelling, ""I've got you, I've got you.""  Then dropped him onto the floor and said, ""I don't got you.""  If you've seen the movie you should know what I'm talking about.  It was a running gag for Carey's character throughout the movie.",1475280000,,711,4.4921875

368423,5,6301797973,A great spoof of Alfred Hitchcock's Vertigo. It not only spoofs Vertigo but dozens of other Hitchcock movies. I have seen it many times and I am still finding spoofs of other movies in it. Mel Brooks plays a psychiatrist who is taking over the management of a mental hospital after the last head is murdered. Chloris Leachman's nurse Ratchet has become a part of the English language. This is one of those movies that can't be missed.,1470355200,,434,4.576923076923077

368426,4,6301797973,"Dr. Richard Thorndyke arrives in Los Angeles to take over as head of The Psycho-Neurotic Institute for the Very Very Nervous. Its front gate has a sign stating ""Keep In"". He had an awful flight over and is distressed to find that his office balcony is also very high up. Yes, Thorndyke has ""high anxiety"".

Soon, he is caught up in an investigation. His predecessor died in suspicious circumstances and something strange is going on at the institute. And we're not talking about just Nurse Diesel and her mustache. The wrong person finds out about Thorndyke's phobia and from then on he's in mortal danger.

Mel Brooks dedicated ""High Anxiety"" to Alfred Hitchcock. It is fun to catch the scenes of specific homage to Hitchcock films, especially ""Psycho"" and ""Vertigo"". The references aren't always direct. For example, at one point, Thorndyke (played by Brooks himself) travels to San Francisco for a conference. He books in only to find out that his room is on the 17th floor. Thorndyke tells the clerk, ""I thought I specificially requested a room on a lower floor, nothing higher than 3.""

The clerk replies, ""We had 201 all set for you, Sir, but a Mr. McGuffin called and told us to change it."" Hitchcock, of course, popularized the film term, McGuffin.

The pacing of ""High Anxiety"" is slow. There are some very good gags, though, and Brooks is funny as Thorndyke. 4 stars and a movie to keep.

Mel Brooks directed twelve films in all, acting in all but one of them. Eight of his movies, including ""High Anxiety"" are collected in a slipcase in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mel-Brooks-Bx-Sm-Cb/dp/B000EBIONA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mel Brooks Bx Sm Cb</a>.

368477,4,6301797973,"Mel Brooks is a comedy genius, there can be no denying that fact.  And this movie is one of his best. Where his later films seem to delve into idiocy (""Dracula Dead and Loving It"" and ""Robin Hood: Men in Tights""), his earlier films are both silly and subtle.  This movie is a great example of that intriguing mixture.  Harvey Korman is terrific in this movie, Chloris Leachman is hilarious and Madeline Kahn is flawless (well, she's flawless in just about everything she does!).  What makes this movie great is the loving and respectful way in which Brooks pokes fun at Hitchcock's movies like ""Vertigo"", ""Psycho"", ""Rear Window"" and others, while at the same time, telling a genuinely funny story along the way.  ""High Anxiety"" is one of Brooks' better films, yet it is one that is not well known.  It's a shame, because it is a great movie.",1456358400,,841,4.610738255033557

368572,2,6301797973,"I'm a huge fan of Zucker Brothers style comedy so someone suggested that I watch a Mel Brooks film. I watched High Anxiety on Netflix and I was disappointed. I laughed at only three jokes: the ""keep in"" sign, the conversation about changing . . . the drapes, and the fake werewolf teeth charades. I thought that the latter was the funniest scene in the whole film. I found most of the other gags to be uncreative, bizarre, and/or awkward. There are maybe five minutes of good material in the film.

Admittedly, I have not seen much of Alfred Hitchcock's work, so some jokes probably went over my head. But I thought that the Hitchcock references that I did pick up on were lame. The shower scene was bizarre, not funny. The Birds scene was equally unfunny. One North by Northwest reference was so uncreative and literal that it may just be brilliant. I did not understand the story line either. What exactly was the goal of the insidious conspiracy at the mental institution?

Bottom line: If you're a fan of films like Naked Gun and Airplane, you may also be disappointed with this film. In my humble opinion, it is almost devoid of the hilarious puns, hilarious non sequiturs, and creative slapstick comedy that are more than plentiful in Naked Gun and Airplane. These are just my impressions and obviously many people disagree. You should watch the film and judge it for yourself.",1445299200,,1383,4.663934426229508

I liked the movie because it provided honest to goodness humor while avoiding the senseless 'bloody' shoot 'em up scenes, unnecessary profanity and suggestive 'sex' that are commonly found in movies today. Quality and humorous skits never seem to become dated. The movie is silly enough to hold one's attention; it's basic 'schtick' by Mel Brooks and his hand-picked cast of characters. For some good laughs, I recommend this movie.",1435276800,,576,5.34065934065934
368610,3,6301797973,"Mel Brooks began to run out of steam with High Anxiety. So it is midway between the creative brilliance of The Producers, Young Frankenstein and Blazing Saddles and his later duds. He was starting to recycle gags from previous movies, and I found his performance in the lead role as curiously underplayed. Still, there are enjoyable moments and he surrounded himself with a stellar cast of supporting players, most notably Cloris Leachman, Harvey Korman and Madeline Kahn, all of whom shine here. Most of the Hitchcock parodies work, but the set-ups can be a bit  labored (notably the one parodying the Psycho shower scene). The problem with elaborately setting up a parody is that it somewhat undercuts the surprise needed to make the scene work fully, but then, Hitchcock was working from a blank template as far as audience expectations (the Psycho scene worked, at least for those seeing it upon initial release, because of the shock of seeing the apparent heroine dispatched so early in the movie, er, is it too late for my spoiler alert?), whereas Brooks was working from the audience's knowledge of what Hitchcock had done. ""The Birds"" parody suffered from a similar problem, and the closing parody of Vertigo just didn't work at all, since unlike Hitchcock's masterpiece, it resolved nothing. Still, this is decent fun and even if Brooks was starting to run out of inspiration, his ambition was still high (thankfully, he has had a wonderful late-in-life revival on Broadway ... it would be rather sad if his final legacy rested on films like ""Robin Hood - Men in Tights"")",1435276800,,1580,4.917602996254682

368636,2,6301797973,"Recently, I've found myself really getting into Hitchcock's movies.  So when I found out that Mel Brooks had spoofed the Master with High Anxiety, I had to watch it.  Normally, I don't enjoy Mr. Brooks, but I set that aside to watch this movie.  I should have passed.

Richard H. Thorndyke (Mel Brooks), a psychiatrist with a fear of heights, has landed the job as the new head of the Psycho-Neurotic Institute for the Very, Very Nervous.  When he arrives, he learns that his predecessor died under mysterious circumstances.  As he tries to settle in, he finds that Dr. Montague (Harvey Korman) seems to know the patients well, while Nurse Diesel (Cloris Leachman) runs a very tight ship.

Just before Thorndyke leaves for a conference in San Francisco, Dr. Wentworth (Dick van Patten), another doctor at the institute, dies in a freak accident.  Then Thorndyke is accused of murder.  Is there something sinister going on at the institute?

There are two scenes that specifically spoof Hitchcock.  They are absolutely brilliant, and I couldn't stop laughing at them.  There are also plenty of references to Hitchcockian things that I enjoyed spotting.  At one point, Mel Brooks sings a song entitled ""High Anxiety.""  Despite the fact that he is only a fair singer, I enjoyed the song, too.

If only the rest of the movie lived up to those moments.

Like most Mel Brooks movies, the ""plot"" is really just an excuse for a series of sketches.  I suspected that going in, but I kept watching the film, waiting for the action to pick up.  Even when things do get more exciting, it wasn't enough to fully engross me.

So the success or failure of the film rests on the sketches.  A few made me laugh, but most of them fell flat, producing very little reaction from me.  Even worse, some of them were very tasteless.  Like most Mel Brooks movies, I'm sure it would be rated PG-13 if it were released today.

The acting was pretty poor, too.  Mel Brooks can't act well enough to be the leading man.  I never really bought him as Thorndyke.  But he had some serious competition for worst actor.  The cast is filled with top comedians from the 70's.  Here, they just weren't that funny.  Frankly, I can't think of one performance I believed.  Everyone was too busy hamming it up for the camera to actually, you know, act.

Since the movie was filmed in Los Angeles and San Francisco, I did get a kick out of seeing some places as they looked 30+ years ago.  I especially enjoyed seeing how little LAX has changed.  I also recognized the Hyatt used for much of the action in the second half.  It was perfect for the plot.

Outside of the locations and a few jokes, there is little to recommend High Anxiety.  If you are a Hitchcock fan, you really don't need to watch it.  I honestly think only Mel Brooks enthusiasts would enjoy it.",1430352000,,2822,4.58316633266533

A TWA Boeing 747 lands at an airport. You see the faces of some of the passengers. [Note the differences at an airport from today.] Dr. Richard A. Thorndyke leaves with his limo driver; he is the new head of the Asylum. His predecessor may have died from ""foul play"". This Institute is very lavish. The hospital staff seems odd. [Are these skits still funny?] Thorndyke has a fear of heights! High anxiety? There is a lavish dining room, like an expensive restaurant. Thorndyke asks about the plans of his predecessor. Who's in charge here? A pocket calculator gives the rate of recovery. Later he gets a welcome note. There is a noise from Nurse Diesel's room. [Is this funny?] Why is a patient being kept there at a rate of $12,000 a month? This patient dreams about werewolves and gets pains in his neck! [Just who needs treatment here?] Where are those flashes coming from? There is some unseemly behavior here.

""Mama, I am falling!"" Thorndyke visits the Violent Ward. He meets Arthur Brisbane, the Industrialist. Nurse Diesel talks to Dr. Wentworth; he is unhappy there. As he drives away his car radio plays full blast; will this cause a stroke? Thorndyke goes to San Francisco and finds his room was changed to a higher floor. ""What a view!"" [Those parodies won't mean much to people today.] Later he gets a surprise visitor. ""Close the drapes."" She is Victoria Brisbane. She lights her cigarette. [Remember unrestricted smoking?] Thorndyke speaks to the meeting. A man talks on a pay telephone. [Remember them?] Will he answer that question? What about toilet training? [Is this still funny?] Later Thorndyke meets Victoria at dinner. Thorndyke sings! [This is not the high spot of this movie.] He does not have a wireless microphone. He learns that patient is not the real Arthur Brisbane!

Nurse Diesel has a plan to prevent Thorndyke from going to the police. ""What does this mean?"" [It means this is not a great movie.] Thorndyke must avoid the police now. He visits the Golden Gate Park at the ""North by Northwest"" corner. The birds chase him to a storage shed! Next he goes to a clothes cleaner. Victoria's clothes match her car (or vice-versa). [Recognize that design?] Does that photograph contain a clue? Can Brophy blow up that negative? Yes. ""Very good work."" Can they suppress that photo? A pager summons Frazier for his next assignment. ""Life is good."" Thorndyke makes a telephone, That man is there to attack him. There is another skit at the airport. [Is this funny? No.] Dick and Vicky return to the Institute. Brophy is in the North Wing and tells them of the plan for murder. They climb the stairway to rescue Arthur Brisbane. Can anything go wrong? [Yes, this movie continues.] Thorndyke is cured by a few words from the professor. Brisbane is rescued, there will be a marriage.

The writers of this script copied parts from old Alfred Hitchcock movies. A copy is not as good as the original unless the writer has the skills to make it better. Was this meant as a comic parody? Or of psychiatry or mental illness or Hitchcock movies? I think it doesn't hit its target. ""Foul Play"" was based on ""The Man Who Knew Too Much"" and is a better movie (even with its funny parts). That ""Oh Dennis"" phrase is an echo of Jack Benny. [Remember him? Not if you are under forty, unless you've seen old shows.] That ""tin teeth"" character echoes a villain in a ""James Bond"" movie of that year.

368706,4,6301797973,"Unnecessary but undeniably funny Mel Brooks movie is, ironically, one that can be watched over and over, a film which translates rather dark and seedy subject matter into absolutely outrageous comedy. Not quite as lighthearted as other Brooks movies, but equally as lightweight, this one features a great cast (check out Rudy De Luca as a psycho assassin!) and proves that any movie with Ernest T. Bass in it (okay, Howard Morris) is going to be funny no matter how much its total sum adds up to. In fact, the ensemble cast all works incredibly well with what they are given to do (especially Harvey Korman and an absolutely outrageous looking Cloris Leachman, who is sensational here) and Brooks himself even does capably well in the lead role (his performance walks the tightrope between glib delivery and astute comedic restraint). Really, it's another great older comedy movie to watch along with ""The Man with Bogart's Face"" and ""The Black Bird"" (among others) if you are in the mood for some macabre (or mystery film parody) humor. ""High Anxiety"" proved that Brooks could handle low-budgets and turn a box-office profit at that time of the film's release--reportedly, it made back its initial budget many times over in box office earnings. The film is very funny though, and despite the fact that it is not so much about Hitchcock reverence as it is its own cinematic animal, Brooks does a fine job building suspense in a story that has no desire to be taken seriously at all. And on this level ""High Anxiety"" is an easy film to take seriously as a major attempt at film comedy. If it's to your taste, then you'll love it. B+",1423872000,,1631,4.726315789473684

368724,4,6301797973,"High Anxiety (1977) directed and written by and starring Mel Brooks is an ode to the great Alfred Hitchcock the Master of Suspense and is a bit hit and miss as a comedy - but the highpoints are hilarious and the low points quickly forgotten. My favourite scene is at the start when our paranoid lead (Brooks as a psychiatrist) arrives shattered from a flight taking him to a new job and then believes he is about to be murdered by a woman at the airline terminal. ""The Birds"", ""Psycho"". ""Vertigo"", ""North by Northwest"" and many other Hitchcock classics are borrowed from here, and the wonderful Cloris Leachman brilliantly headlines an entertaining cast, including other Brooks regulars Madeline Kahn, Harvey Korman and Brooks himself who performs a ""number"" at a nightclub. Set in a psychiatric hospital this is a must for Brooks fans and worth a few laughs for non-initiates.",1422316800,,877,4.8533333333333335
368725,4,6301797973,One of Mel Brooks favorites. He copies a lot of Hitchcock here too and had the permission from Hitch who like the premise of making scenes from his movies funny.,1421798400,,161,4.4
368726,5,6301797973,"High Anxiety is absolutely hilarious!  Anyone who's a fan of Leslie Nielson's style of comedy HAS to watch this!  Released in 1977, it's about a psychiatrist played by Mel Brooks who visits a hospital for the mentally ill.  The word ""high anxiety"" comes because Mel has a strong fear of heights and goes crazy clinging to the walls whenever he finds himself in an up high situation.  I can't blame the poor guy there- I'm *almost* to the point of clinging to the walls myself!

However upon arriving to the hospital he soon realizes that the people who work there are more unusual than the patients!  Poor Mel constantly finds himself in the most peculiar of situations and his facial expressions/reactions are always really funny and award-winning!  I like the one patient who acts like a cocker spaniel and pees, humps and licks Mel when they're in the room together, haha.

This movie tends to illustrate mockeries from other films such as the Birds with the famous scene showing birds intimidatingly gathering around playground equipment while Mel's sitting on a park bench reading a paper, along with other movies.  The highlights?  Well honestly this type of comedy fits my tastes so well, it's hard to pick just one segment that was most hilarious to me.  The exchange of words with the beautiful Madeline Kahn first meeting Mel in an apartment room and the curtain closing/crawling scene was really good.  I like the part where Madeline and Mel want to be as obnoxious as possible in public in order to get past security, and also the scene where a killer is trying to murder Mel while Mel is busy talking to Madeline on the phone, and Madeline hears all kinds of groan sounds on the other end and thinks she's dealing with a pervert on the other end.  She even goes along with it to add more to the situational humor!  Of course the newspaper fetching boy with his really whiny voice illustrating frustration and anger was awesome too.

Perhaps the segment I find most interesting is the guy driving home in the rain who becomes trapped in his car while a song playing on the radio literally irritates him to death.  He tries to free himself by kicking through the windows but is unable to do so.  I find this scene interesting because the song that's playing is seriously tame and likeable compared to the annoying vocal melody style that makes up a large chunk of today's music.  The song in the movie actually had tempo changes, a vocal melody and a guitar solo and sounded like a typical late 70's party tune to me.  Imagine if the poor guy had to be exposed to a cookie monster-vocal type heavy metal song, haha.  I'd be squeezing my body through the glove box!  Goes to show what used to be considered annoying in the 70's isn't quite as bad as what we're exposed to in today's world.

The writing throughout the film is incredibly sharp, and all the characters are memorable with their own distinct personalities.  Distinctiveness is important in movie writing in my opinion, to prevent all the characters from unintentionally blending together and being portrayed as utterly bland.  The cranky old nurse, the GROSS relationship between the nurse and one of her employees (a little bondage discipline anyone?  No thanks!) Mel's fear of heights, Madeline's luring attractiveness, the professor's offbeat personality, and so much more.  This film is clearly a winner!  Anyone that likes Attack of the Killer Tomatoes would love this movie as well!",1420416000,,3461,4.7634228187919465
368727,5,6301797973,"This is a great film, and it starts off with a bang with three classic comic scenes at the airport - the screaming lady, the airport hustler, and the airport pick-up (""I got it! I GOT it!! ...I ain't got it...""). Each scene is full of great gags, often Hitchcock-derived (Brooks' character calls Madeline Kahn's character from a pay phone and asks her to meet him at the ""north by northwest"" corner of some intersection, while Brooks has a field day with the birds concept, and the Psycho shower scene too). Brooks and Kahn pull off a fantastic ruse at airport security, and there's a pretty funny obscene phone call scene. Love how Kahn drives a car that matches her Louis Vuitton outfit (I didn't know that they they had LV in the 1970s... huh!). Cloris Leachman nearly steals the show with a fantastically creepy Nurse Charlotte Diesel, and Barry Levinson is fantastic as a haughty busboy who won't get Brooks a newspaper because it's too much bother. Brooks also does a pretty good singing number, ""High Anxiety"". The plot occasionally comes in to spoil the fun, especially the ending, but it's hardly noticable between all of the timeless gags.

This movie is standard Mel Brooks fare, this time containing a handful of satirical reference to Alfred Hitchcock classics: The Birds, Psycho, North by Northwest, and most notably, Vertigo. High Anxiety is right up there with his best work during the 1970s and 1980s -- Young Frankenstein, Blazing Saddles and History of the World, were better -- it is every bit as funny as the Hitchcock movies were spine tingling. Brooks was wonderfully augmented by a supporting cast that will be familiar to viewers of his other movies: Madeleine Kahn, Cloris Leachman and Harvey Korman - as well as Dick Van Patten and Ron Carey (who played Levitt on Barney Miller.)",1413676800,,991,5.0426829268292686

368787,5,6301797973,"This is an homage to Hitchcock starring, written and directed by Mel Brooks. It is one of my all time favorite Mel Brooks movies. What I love about this film is that Brooks is not only having the time of his life being the star of it but he also gleefully sends up ever single film scene of Hitchcock's that was memorable. We open with his arriving at a psychiatric hospital where he is to start work as the new head shrink. That was Gregory Peck's role in ""Spellbound"". He is in a Hyatt hotel with the glass elevators high up for his ""Vertigo"" sequence and of course gets into it with birds from ""The Birds"". He just keeps doing one film after another. The absolute best thing he does though, and you can tell he just LOVES doing it, is that he performs a musical number in that hotel as if he were Frank Sinatra.  It is just fabulous.

He also brings aboard the late Madeline Kahn and Harvey Korman whom he'd used so well in BLAZING SADDLES and Cloris Leachman as his nurse at the hospital. He made this in 1977. It was not very well received at the time as he'd made the public too used to his using other actors in his lead roles. I think people were expecting to see Gene Wilder instead as the lead. But I can't imagine anyone playing all of these zany roles but Brooks. My husband and I have a bit of a split here.  I flat out adore this film and have seen it many times. I laugh like crazy during it and just love it. My husband likes it but has only seen it once and that was enough for him. He thinks it is a bit over the top.  I love it for precisely that reason. If you are having a bad day, watch this film.  You will shortly forget all of your troubles.

368802,5,6301797973,"""High Anxiety"" is definitely not Mel Brooks' most acclaimed film, although it did receive decent reviews when initially released in 1977. Thanks in part to it's theme, however, it's aged very well and nearly 40 years after it was made, the laughs are frequent and raucous. I was 9 years old when ""Anxiety"" came out, and forced my folks to take me to the theater to see it. I loved it then, and love it now. Of course, to be a true afficianado, one must, 1)Be a Mel Brooks fan and 2)Know one's Hitchcock.
  If that's you, then you've undoubtedly already seen ""High Anxiety"". What's your favorite scene? I have to go with the shower scene, in which director Barry Levinson, making a cameo as a very high-strung bellman, brings Mel his newspaper in a very Hitchcockian style.

The problem is Brooks plays a straight man, which makes most of the movie dull and flat (just like the way he delivers his lines).

368919,4,6301797973,"In Mel Brooks' tribute Hitchcock, one has to be very familiar with Hitchcock's films to appreciate the attempts at humor. A lot of the jokes depend on the viewer's familiarity with ""Spellbound"", which is one of Hitchcock's lesser popular films. References to ""The Birds"", ""Psycho"", ""Vertigo"", and ""North by Northwest"" are there, and in the cases of these first two, are very clever and funny. But overall, the humor at times is strained. Brooks seems to try too hard for a laugh by throwing in sight gags and one-liners every chance he gets. This results in many of them falling flat. There was one offensive scene during the opening involving a flasher at the airport. Brooks made this character obviously swishy gay, giving the impression that all flashers are gay. He even says, with a lisp, ""What's wrong? We're all doing it!"" Harvey Korman's character is an offshoot of his Hedley Lamarr from ""Blazing Saddles"", and he's very good at it. Cloris Leachman is totally insane with no limits to what she will do, the source of the biggest laughs. Ron Carey's character gets tired rather quickly. And Madeline Kahn is a treasure, playing the token Hitchcock blonde femme fatale perfectly. Definitely not Brooks' best, but far from his worst. The Blu-ray disc looks great. The extras are entertaining. Brief interviews with some of the actors and crew members, optional pop-up Hitchcock trivia throughout the film, and a few other treats and trailers.",1376265600,,1449,4.967078189300412

Brooks conquers his fear of heights at the end, thanks to some quick psychiatric feedback from one of his professors, and rescues Madeline Kahn's father after a frenzied race up a church bell tower.

368995,4,6301797973,"Ok this review will tell you all I have way too much time on my hands but here goes.  High Anxiety is one of my most favorite movies of all time.  I stumbled into seeing it while in the old Maryland Rehabilitation Center on Movie night.  It was love at first sight for me and High Anxiety.  I especially loved Nurse Diesel my right hand man, woman.  Being autistic if I love a movie I end up knowing the dialogue by heart so when something is missing I know it.  The missing dialogue in this edition of High Anxiety is completely cut out.  Nurse Diesel admonishes Doctor Thorndike in her welcome that Dinner is served in the executive dinning room at exactly 8:30 and those who are tardy ""Do Not Get Fruit Cup!"" she quickly cuts her eyes over toward Doctor Montique who instantly looks sheepish.  Go to later that night at dinner as the camera moves in and breaks a dinning room window pane during the establishment shot for the scene.  Cut to Nurse Diesel in her evening finery topped off by an inverse black sequined nurses cap with a inverse white line across it.  At each place setting there is a large beautifully stacked delicious to look at fruit cup in a silver bowl.  Exactly 8:30 PM comes and passes as Nurse Diesel nods to the wait staff to remove Dr. Montique's fruit cup as he is TARDY hince no fruit cup for him!  Cut to doctor Montique racing down the steps entering the dinning room sitting down quickly.  Doctor Montique unfurls his napkin in a simple quick flourish, picks up his spoon and proceeds to enjoy the fruit cup he just knows is there.  Problem it isn't per Nurse Diesel's strict adherence to the rules. Doctor Montique sheepishly whines after looking at his watch says, I'm only 30 seconds late, his voice then bristles ""YOU'RE SO STRICT!""  I said all this to set up the problem with this cut up DVD, in the real movie their was a scene here where Doctor Montique looks totally crest fallen and forelorn, as Nurse Diesel places a spoon full of delicious fruitcup within inches of poor Dr Montiques mouth only to eat it herself looking quite ghoulish in the act.  In the real uncut movie One of the other doctors at the table say to Doctor Montique that the ""Fruitcup is especially good tonight, to Doctor Montiques pained expressions, he continues The fruit cup is all fresh nothing canned!, even the Strawberries a point where Doctor Montique teeth clinched on a napkin pulls it forcefully from his mouth in sheer resignation.  This entire scene one of the funniest in the High Anxiety movie was cut out.  They market this version of High Anxiety as a complete quality edition and it is not.  This version of High Anxiety is a hacked up mess just like all the other versions.  I have an OLD VHS version of High Anxiety from the 1980's that includes the scene of which I speak that is far better and more fun than this version.

Now for the picture quality I have a Samsung 55 inch HDTV 1080p at 240 HHz and I played this High Anxiety Blu ray on my PS3 and on a blu ray player.  I don't know what the other reviewers are talking about when they say the video quality of this blu Ray High Anxiety is not far superior than almost everything I have seen before.  In bad transfers of High Anxiety here are the things I see most often.  In the opening sequence lines in the psycho swirl pattern title lettering is muddy and indistinct.  In this version the psycho disk swirl lines in the lettering is so sharp I can see where it begins in each opening credit.  In bad transfers the landing TWA plane is faded, the entire image is cloudy.  The facial features of passengers in the plane windows are not distinct and sharp.  In bad copies the No Smoking signs are effectively unreadable.  In bad copies the pilot controls as the lights phase is fuzzy and the panels and dials are blurred.  I found no defects in the quality of the images in these key points.  Everywhere I am used to finding visual blur and other issues in bad transfers were instead beautiful sharp and clear in this blu ray copy.  Yes this copy of High Anxiety was cut up by hacks who have no respect for this awesome movie BUT, the picture quality was beyond awesome.  Also the sound quality is superior to most lesser copies.  My copy of High Anxiety Blu Ray played in all three of my PS3's, both of my blu ray players and on all five of my Samsung HDTV's with the same high image and sound quality.  With the exception of being poorly edited and great scenes left out, this is an awesome print.  Too its credit the editors did leave Doctor Little Old Man's BS statement in response to Dr Thorndike's attempt to cover over his High Anxiety that took guts!  I took a star off for cutting awesome High Anxiety but for the awesome picture and sound quaity and extras this Blu Ray High Anxiety earns 4 stars.  I am happy I brought this because the picture and sound quality improvements make this High Anxiety Blu ray a seriously cut up imperfect but worthy upgrade.",1360368000,,4955,4.428256070640177

However, if you aren't familiar with Alfred Hitchcock's movies you may not get some of the jokes. The movie centers around The Psycho-Neurotic Institute for the Very, Very Nervous. All my favorite, older, actors are in this.  Cloris Leachman, who is an attractive woman in real life, plays a very evil and ugly nurse.  Others in this movie, besides Mel Brooks, are Harvey Korman from the Carol Burnette Show, Howard Morris, who played Ernest T. Bass in the Andy Griffith Show, is an eccentric professor, Ron Carey who was in Barney Miller, plays a very weak chauffeur, and the wonderful Madeline Kahn is the rich daughter of one of the institute's patients. In true Hitchcock form she's a beautiful blonde.  Rudy De Luca plays an evil killer who happens to have braces on his teeth. He also co-wrote this movie with Brooks and Barry Levinson.  I read that Hitchcock enjoyed this movie so much he presented Brooks with six magnums of 1961 Chteau Haut-Brion wine, to show his appreciation.
Even though this is a very funny movie, parts of it may not be suitable for small children.  There is no bad language or nudity but a few scenes, particularly those between Cloris Leachman and Harvey Korman, may be a little more than what you want kids to see.
The quality of the video was good.  In fact I've just ordered another one for my dad.  My mom passed away recently and this was her favorite movie but for some reason he's never seen it.

369050,4,6301797973,"Every Hitchcock fan will love this movie! Mel Brooks manages to sneak in a reference to all the most notorious (sorry!) Alfred Hitchcock movies you've ever loved. Just wait until you see what he does to The Birds! (Or rather what they do to him.)

Dr. Richard H. Thorndyke (Mel Brooks) is the newly appointed director of the Psychoneurotic Institute for the Very, Very Nervous. But he's got a problem of his own: high anxiety, which is used as the name for fear of heights, although the real name for that is . . . erm . . . agoraphobia? . . . anyway, several scenes from ""Vertigo"" are thus available.

Chloris Leachman does villainous hags for Brooks better than anyone. In this one she is Nurse Diesel, the head nurse of the Institute and a most amazing character. I will not say more than to suggest that there's a point (sorry!) to her name.

It turns out the previous director died under mysterious circumstances, officially designated suicide, but which Dr. Thorndyke's chauffeur and assistant Brophy (Ron Carey) is convinced was murder. And he suspects Nurse Diesel and Dr. Montegue (Harvey Korman) of being the murderers. It is well known that Montegue thought he would be named director after the death of the previous director.

Medeline Kahn plays Victoria Brisbane, daughter of a wealthy industrialist who has been held at the Institute for a long time, even though she's certain he's ""as sane as I am."" But Dr. Thorndyke was introduced to a patient he was told was Mr. Brisbane, and the patient believed he was a cocker spaniel. Pitiful, but also extremely funny.

There are plenty of howlers throughout the movie; a nice mix of funny lines and clever sight gags...even action! Further, Brooks manages to send up the Psychiatric community and movies about the Psychiatric community. He beats the Marxes in their own semi-satire, ""Day at the Races"" effort from 1937.

Brooks is excellent all the way through and I've never seen madeline Kahn do better. She's the ""prozac queen""/daughter of a wealthy resident of the Hospital (who is strangely missing in action...got the plot?). Not to play spoiler but she has a scene in a hotel room where she picks up the phone and somehow believes she is on the receiving end of a ""phone sex"" solicitor. It is stunningly brilliant. Check it out!

Downside, meaning the 5 minus rating: Howard Morris, as the Ol' Professorial/European ""specialist"", is a bit too much over-the-top (save for an hilarious fisticuffs bit with Brooks); the ending is THE ""coulda-shoulda"" issue for this Reviewer. sadly disappointing throw-away.

Brooks is arguably one of the top comedians of the 20th Century. Whether it's a satire (Blazing Saddles) or a tribute to classic films (Spaceballs, Young Frankenstein), the humor really works if it doesn't rely too much on toilet humor and clichd gags. High Anxiety, however, features more simplistic humor and it doesn't seem to work well in a tribute to Hitchcock thrillers. The parodies are spoon-fed, while some of the sight gags are poorly performed. The song, ""High Anxiety,"" sung by Mel Brooks, is almost forgettable. Brophy (played by Carey) is more of an irritant rather than a comedic sidekick. On the bright side, however, the rest of the film delivers. Brooks, Korman, Leachman, and Morris give hilarious performances, while Kahn is absolutely gorgeous. The rest of the sight gags, especially those involving the camera, are undeniably funny. A few references to Hitchcock are pretty clever, while some of the music is decent.

As a comedy, it's a couple of notches above mediocre quality. Humor that works exists in only half of the film. This isn't one of the most successful from Brooks, but it doesn't mean that it's bad. It's just second-rate at best.

This movie does not improve on Blu-ray as much as Mel's other Blu-ray movie releases.  The master film seems to be grainier than the other productions.  The 20TH CENTURY FOX logo will just make you scream, it looks like an 8mm home-movie blown up to 35mm. But don't worry, the actual movie is much better than that.

In addition to the film grain, the colors do not jump out at you either.  This may be the way the movie was shot, but it does raise the question whether it is worth upgrading from your DVD to this Blu-ray release.

The big improvement is the addition of special features.  The 30 minute documentary about how the movie was conceived & Hitchcock's imput into the movie's script is well worth the upgrade.

If you are a viewer who just loves to watch the extra bonus material, then it is a no-brainer: BUY THIS Blu-ray!  If you never bother with the extras, then you may want to think twice before upgrading to this.

Blu-Ray (1977, 2010)

Mel Brooks wrote and directed ""High Anxiety"" in 1977 as an homage to Alfred Hitchcock thriller films. Brooks also stars in the film as the new head of the Psycho-Neurotic Institute for the Very, Very Nervous and strange things begin to happen and he must try to get over his issue with heights to clear his name when he is accused of murder.

Mel Brooks plays Richard H. Thorndyke has a phobia of heights and nightmare that are a nod to the film ""Vertigo."" Professor (Lill-ol-man) Lilloman played by Howard Morris is based on a character in ""Spellbound."" There is a lobby from ""North by Northwest"" and Mel Brooks has a shower scene using tons of different shots like in ""Psycho"" letting his character get stabbed with a newspaper and watching ink wash down the drain. An abducted family member follows the story of ""The Man Who Knew Too Much."" Countless references that I will never fully get unless I commit to going back to the source material.

The story is pretty silly blending all these elements together. There is some greater conspiracy at the Institute about a murder cover-up, phobias, kinky staff, and a mysterious blond trying to save her father being kept there. There are many specific references to Hitchcock films and not all will be easy to catch unless you have watched a lot of them. Mel Brooks worked hard to try and make this film as enjoyable as possible for non-Hitchcock viewers as well but without that knowledge, only the physical comedy comes across. The most memorable part is Mel singing ""High Anxiety"" with his best Frank Sinatra impression and getting attacked with tons of bird poop from the ""Birds"".

This isn't one of my favorite Mel Brooks movies. I prefer ""Get Smart"", ""Blazing Saddles"", ""History of the World: Part 1"", ""Spaceballs"", and ""Robin Hood: Men In Tights."" Maybe it is because most of those films were made later and it seems with experience his movies improved a great deal and are edited tighter for jokes. A Mel Brooks movie is a Mel Brooks movie however and as the so-called Master of Comedy if he doesn't get you to laugh out loud at least once, check your pulse because you may be dead.

Blu-Ray Features:

As with ""History of the World: Part 1"", this film features a Trivia track about Hitchcock movies so you can experience this old classic in a new way...by learning stuff! There are fun and interesting facts referencing which characters, scenes, and situations were created from which Hitchcock movies at a given moment obviously but also about the film like Brophy being named after actor Edward Brophy who often played comic sidekicks in films like voicing the mouse in ""Dumbo."" This track is full of very helpful information, especially if you haven't seen any Hitchcock films but the most famous and will give you ideas of others you want to watch.

The ""Am I Very, Very Nervous?"" test says ""Why spend money on therapy when you can take this test to find out how nervous you are?"" After a very long black screen that got my anxiety up that it wasn't working, it turned out to be another track that plays along with the film with a heart monitor in one corner and a score in another. The movie asks you questions along the way for you to answer with your remote and it keeps tally. You have to answer quickly though or you'll miss your chance. Just another fun, silly way to bring something new to a movie seen often and keeping you paying attention. There is also an isolated score track on this film like ""History of the World: Part 1"" so you can enjoy the music without distraction.

""Hitchcock and Mel: Spoofing the Master of Suspense"" Featurette goes over the making of this film and how much Mel Brooks looked up to Alfred Hitchcock and his gift for being able to think about 132 shots and storyboard them in his head and make it happen. Character anxiety was prevalent in all of Hitchcock films and while working on ""Silent Film"" the crew began to watch his films and wanted to use that wealth of material for a comedy. People called it the Master of Comedy meeting the Master of Suspense and Mel Brooks got together with Hitchcock for script approval and even got suggestions from him. Brooks isn't lead actor material but he wanted to make it happen anyway! You'll get some background on what it was like to eat lunch with Alfred Hitchcock and let me tell you, this was a man who knew how to EAT! This is a great little source of background information on the film and has interviews with the actors as they are now.",1273708800,,4520,4.599255583126551

369155,4,6301797973,"Nobody is safe from satire, not even Alfred Hitchcock. But Mel Brooks straddles the line between parody and affectionate homage in ""High Anxiety,"" a hysterical psychiatric comedy that deftly references all sorts of Hitch films -- while keeping in Brooks' trademark slapstick, hilarious dialogue, and weird characters.

Dr. Richard Thorndyke (Brooks) has just been hired as the director of Psychoneurotic Institute for the Very, VERY Nervous, after the sudden death of the previous administrator. Something odd seems to be going on -- screams are heard, a patient signals Thorndyke with a mirror, and Dr. Charles Montague (Harvey Korman) frightens a patient into fits. Then one of the doctors dies mysteriously, while trying to leave the conspiracy.

And when Thorndyke is lecturing at a psychiatry convention, the evil Nurse Diesel (Cloris Leachman) sends a hired killer (wearing a Thorndyke mask) to frame the doctor for murder. Now Thorndyke must elude the police and the killer, clear his name with the help of a mysterious blonde heiress (Madeleine Kahn), and overcome his crippling ""high anxiety.""

As a homage/spoof, this is gold. Brooks deftly weaves together elements and storylines from various Hitchock movies, including ""Vertigo"" and ""Spellbound,"" with some nods to ""Psycho,"" ""North By Northwest"" and ""The Birds."" There's dizzying looks down a wooden tower, newspaper ""stabbings"" in the shower, and Madeleine Kahn's strange not-so-icy blonde.

But it's also a great movie in its own right. Rather than outright slapstick as in some of his movies, Brooks instead crafts a clever thriller framed with delicious comedy -- he even makes fun of some standard filmmaking devices. For example, Thorndyke's hotel suite is switched for a top-floor room because of a call from... ""a Mr. McGuffin.""

And he fills it with hysterical comedic situations, like Victoria mistaking the sounds of a life-or-death struggle for a phone sex pervert, or Thornduke being assaulted by a crazed bellboy. And his dialogue is solidly quotable in this one (""Those who are tardy do not get fruit cup""). The highlight has to be murder-by-bad-pop song, where a man is trapped in a car with the unspeakably bad ""If You Love Me Tell Me Loud Loud Loud.""

Gene Wilder wasn't available when this was made, so Brooks took the lead himself. The seriousness of the character doesn't entirely fit him, but he's a solid enough Thorndyke, especially when he has to give a G-rated speech about penis envy.

Most of the comedy comes from an unfortunately blonde Madeleine Kahn as the chic love interest, as well as a ghoulish Leachman and S&M enthusiastic Korman (""Too much bondage, too much bondage, not enough discipline!""). And Ron Carey and Howard Morris round the cast off, as the photographically obsessed chauffeur and the stereotypical little German shrink (""Who's dead?"").

""High Anxiety"" is an affectionate parody/homage to Hitchcock -- even Hitchcock was pleased by it -- but it's also a solid comedy movie. Definitely worth seeing!",1266883200,,3010,5.217391304347826

Freud is about commerce as much as mommy and male reproductive organ obsessions (""a psychiatrist's most important rule -- never take a personal check!"").  Even the sacred cow of the '80's, Astrology, is targeted:  ""What's your sign?""  ""I'm sorry -- it's UNLISTED.""

As the film begins, Brooks dedicates it to ""the Master of Suspense, Alfred Hitchcock""; and to Brooks' credit, he successfully (and affectionately) satirizes key scenes from Hitchcock classics like ""Psycho"", ""Vertigo"" & ""The Birds"". But ""High Anxiety"" is more than a mere parody: there's the familiar Brooks nuttiness, and a re-assembling of old favorites (Madeline Kahn, Cloris Leachman, Harvey Korman, Ron Carey) mixed in with newer faces (Howard Morris, Dick Van Patten). The late 70's look has dated the film slightly, but it hasn't affected the humor; it is still one of the best comedies around. And Leachman plays one of the scariest looking women in film history---that of the pointy brassiere, sinister Nurse Diesel. As the leading man---the distinguished psychiatrist Dr. Richard H. Thorndyke---Brooks is forced to play it mostly straight through the picture, although he's allowed to cut loose in a lounge singing scene and portraying an old Jewish man (with Kahn) to slip past airport security. Korman's at his weasally best as a disgruntled fellow doctor who's conspiring with Diesel, and Kahn is perfectly cast as the flaky ""damsel in distress"", one of those ""mysterious"" woman types who pop up in suspense films.

Mel Brooks plays Dr. Thorndyke, a psychiatrist sent to work for an asylum out in California. He arrives just after the last guy died under mysterious circumstances and is immediately greeted by his new coworkers and associates including the downright evil and manipulative Nurse Diesel and the submissve but devious Dr. Monatigue. The suspense in this film starts out right away and literally doesn't let up.

After a nice dinner when Nurse Diesel shows how controling she is the new coworkers propose a toast to Dr. Thorndyke. All participate in this toast except Nurse Diesel and the way the scene was done with the music, the costumes and the atmosphere will literally send chills down your spine.

This is a horror movie because the ideas that it explores are terrifying. Thorndyke finds out that Diesel and Montagiue are keeping people at the asylum against their will and bilking their families for money. Anyone in the inner circle who dares threaten the security and the secrecy of the evil scheming of Nurse Diesel is offed and disposed of. This easily could be remade into a straight horror film with concepts like the above mentioned ones. The concept alone is chilling even though Nurse Diesel is a laugh riot with her costume, mannerisms and the lines she uses. To me this movie showcases Cloris Leachman as a class act actress.

All in all ""High Anxiety"" is way more fun and classy then any comedy out today. It's a drama/horror/comedy that is nonstop fun from start to finish and it's not filled exclusively with tip offs to diversity and nonstop sex jokes like so many 21st century films.

Mel Brooks, the clown prince, is at it again!  This time, he stars as Dr. Richard Harpo Thorndyke, The new head administrator of the Psychoneurotic Institute for the Very, Very Nervous.  Thorndyke must contend with the likes of Dr. Montague (Harvey Korman) and his equally demented partner in crime, the devious Nurse Diesel (Cloris Leachman).  Together, they are out to frame Dr. Thorndyke for a murder he never commited.  In the face of this madness, the doctor encounters the alluring and seductive Victoria Brisbane (Madeline Kahn), the daughter of an industrialist who entered the Institute, to be treated for his condition.  What's more, many of the scenes pay homage (if in parody) to some of the most well-known and well-loved scenes from some of Hitchcock's best films (including STRANGERS ON A TRAIN, THE BIRDS, VERTIGO and PSYCHO).  For those of you familiar with Mel Brooks and his brand of comedy, you won't be disappointed.

369304,4,6301797973,"Nobody is safe from satire, not even Alfred Hitchcock. But Mel Brooks straddles the line between parody and affectionate homage in ""High Anxiety,"" a hysterical psychiatric comedy that deftly references all sorts of Hitch films -- while keeping in Brooks' trademark slapstick, hilarious dialogue, and weird characters.

Dr. Richard Thorndyke (Brooks) has just been hired as the director of Psychoneurotic Institute for the Very, VERY Nervous, after the sudden death of the previous administrator. Something odd seems to be going on -- screams are heard, a patient signals Thorndyke with a mirror, and Dr. Charles Montague (Harvey Korman) frightens a patient into fits. Then one of the doctors dies mysteriously, while trying to leave the conspiracy.

And when Thorndyke is lecturing at a psychiatry convention, the evil Nurse Diesel (Cloris Leachman) sends a hired killer (wearing a Thorndyke mask) to frame the doctor for murder. Now Thorndyke must elude the police and the killer, clear his name with the help of a mysterious blonde heiress (Madeleine Kahn), and overcome his crippling ""high anxiety.""

As a homage/spoof, this is gold. Brooks deftly weaves together elements and storylines from various Hitchock movies, including ""Vertigo"" and ""Spellbound,"" with some nods to ""Psycho,"" ""North By Northwest"" and ""The Birds."" There's dizzying looks down a wooden tower, newspaper ""stabbings"" in the shower, and Madeleine Kahn's strange not-so-icy blonde.

But it's also a great movie in its own right. Rather than outright slapstick as in some of his movies, Brooks instead crafts a clever thriller framed with delicious comedy -- he even makes fun of some standard filmmaking devices. For example, Thorndyke's hotel suite is switched for a top-floor room because of a call from... ""a Mr. McGuffin.""

And he fills it with hysterical comedic situations, like Victoria mistaking the sounds of a life-or-death struggle for a phone sex pervert, or Thornduke being assaulted by a crazed bellboy. And his dialogue is solidly quotable in this one (""Those who are tardy do not get fruit cup""). The highlight has to be murder-by-bad-pop song, where a man is trapped in a car with the unspeakably bad ""If You Love Me Tell Me Loud Loud Loud.""

Gene Wilder wasn't available when this was made, so Brooks took the lead himself. The seriousness of the character doesn't entirely fit him, but he's a solid enough Thorndyke, especially when he has to give a G-rated speech about penis envy.

Most of the comedy comes from an unfortunately blonde Madeleine Kahn as the chic love interest, as well as a ghoulish Leachman and S&M enthusiastic Korman (""Too much bondage, too much bondage, not enough discipline!""). And Ron Carey and Howard Morris round the cast off, as the photographically obsessed chauffeur and the stereotypical little German shrink.

""High Anxiety"" is an affectionate parody/homage to Hitchcock -- even Hitchcock was pleased by it -- but it's also a solid comedy movie. Definitely worth seeing!",1177286400,,2994,5.20997920997921

The incredible Cloris Leachman who gave the world the unforgettable Frau Bluecher in YF here delivers an equally impressive performance as the stoic, severe and ultimately sadistic Nurse Diesel and Harvey Korman as her partner in crime, Dr. Montague is, as always, textbook perfect.  Adding to all this is Mel Brooks as ""high anxiety"" plagued Dr. Thorndyke, newly appointed Director of the Psychoneurotic Institute for the Very Very Nervous and the much admired and equally missed comedienne par excellence Madeline Kahn as Victoria Brisbane, daughter of a missing institute patient, Arthur Brisbane.  This spoof/parody/homage of the most famous of Hitchcock's work is an incredibly funny and irreverent (without being vicious or mean-spirited) film and is bound to tickle those familiar with the films of both Brooks and the great English master.

Now, finally, it has arrived (or at least will on 9/5). I know that most Brooks fans prefer The Producers, Young Frankenstein, Blazing Saddles or even History of the World Part I. But in High Anxiety, Brooks satirizes my favorite director, Alfred Hitchcock, to a tee. Roger Ebert, among others, says that this is a misfire. Don't listen to them! When High Anxiety premiered, Alfred Hitchcock himself sent Brooks a bottle of expensive champagne, saying he loved the film and was honored by it. To me, that's the acid test -- anyone who doesn't like High Anxiety just doesn't get it.

369357,3,6301797973,"Just three years after his twin peaks of ""Blazing Saddles"" and ""Young Frankenstein"" (probably his comic apex), Mel Brooks made this fitfully funny send-up of Hitchcock's suspense classics. The most detrimental change with this 1977 comedy is that he lost the wonderfully manic Gene Wilder as his leading man and chose to make himself the star. Brooks is unfortunately miscast as Dr. Richard Thorndyke lacking the enigmatic leading-man charisma so central to most of Hitchcock's classics. To some degree, he knows his limitations since he inserts several irrelevant bits of business that have little to do with the character, like his sudden piano-bar crooning of the title tune or his Catskills-level disguise as the old Jewish man at the airport. However, in catering to his own persona, he compromises what there is of a suspenseful element to the movie.

The plot centers on Thorndyke as he becomes the new Chief of Staff at The Psycho-Neurotic Institute for the Very, Very Nervous. Suffering from an actual condition called ""high anxiety"", he cannot stand heights but perseveres in trying to run the medical facility despite the connivances of the scarifying Nurse Diesel and the weak, bondage-loving Dr. Montague. Thorndyke is then shuttled off to a medical convention at the Hyatt Regency in San Francisco - the ideal setting to challenge his acrophobia - where he meets a mysterious blonde named Victoria and gets framed for murder. It all works toward a climax that plays like a riff on ""Vertigo"".

Brooks produces some genuine laughs along the way - the camera smashing through glass doors in zooming upon a dinner scene, the Los Angeles Symphony Orchestra providing atmospheric thrill music on a passing bus, and basically anything related to the wonderful Madeline Kahn as Victoria. Looking resplendent in a blonde wig, she comes awfully late into the film but makes her moments count, especially her stimulated reaction to what she thinks is an obscene phone call. Alas, there are a lot of bits that aren't that funny - comedian Charlie Callas as an inmate who thinks he is a cocker spaniel, the self-inflicted censorship after Thorndyke's speech and the Jewish couple charade at the airport.

The film also takes quite a while to establish itself and only increases momentum when the action moves to San Francisco. Future director Barry Levinson, one of the movie's four writers, has a hilarious bit as a high-strung bellboy resistant to getting Thorndyke a newspaper. This leads to a funny take-off of the ""Psycho"" shower scene, though I could have done without seeing Brooks in the buff. There is another funny take-off on the schoolyard scene from ""The Birds"" though it honestly feels wedged in for no narrative purpose. There are also references to non-Hitchcock films like ""Call Northside 777"" (the photo enlargement plot turn) and ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"".

Cloris Leachman deserves a medal for looking so horrendous as Nurse Diesel, though she plays the role quite similarly to her Frau Blucher in ""Young Frankenstein"". Harvey Korman has always been more a sketch comic and proves that again as Montague, as do Howard Morris as kindly Professor Lilloman (Little-Old-Man) and Ron Carey as double-speak sidekick Brophy. John Morris's music score is a fitting tribute to Hitchcock, though Paul Lohmann's cinematography seems particularly washed out in the print transfer on the DVD. There are no extras other than the original trailers for four other Brooks films.",1148083200,4,3490,5.117543859649123

For those who have not experienced HIGH ANXIETY, if you purchase this movie to witness that sequence, you will not regret it.

HIGH ANXIETY features Mel Brooks and his familiar cast of comedy allstars in an intelligently written, hilarious spoof of the Alfred Hitchcock mysteries.  From PSYCHO, to THE BIRDS, NORTH BY NORTH WEST and VERTIGO, few Hitchcock classics are spared from Brooks' reworking.  It's all spun together into a nice little murder plot.

HIGH ANXIETY is a must for any fan of Mel Brooks, or of intelligent comedy that makes you think.

Mel Brooks plays Richard Thorndyke, the new head psychiatrist of the leading `Institute For the Very, Very Nervous'.  Thorndyke himself is plagued by bouts of `high anxiety' (vertigo).  When Thorndyke is framed for murder and discovers the sinister cover-ups at the Institute, he joins the leggy Victoria Brisbane (Madeline Kahn) in a race against time to rescue her father from the clutches of sadistic Head Nurse Diesel (Cloris Leachman)!

Brooks and the rest of the cast have an absolute ball.  Cloris Leachman sports a traffic-cone decolletage that would make Madonna jealous, in her inspired performance as Nurse Diesel (and her scenes with Harvey Korman are hysterical; you won't be able to view their performances in HERBIE GOES BANANAS the same way again).

Which is to say nothing of Hitchcock--whose movie plots provide endless fodder for this Mel Brooks masterpiece. The cast is superb, and the movie divine. Granted, this is one review that is not written with those who've never seen the movie in mind.

369458,4,6301797973,"Certainly a great Mel Brooks classic complete with his usual zany cast with the likes of Harvey Korman, Cloris Leachman and Madeline Kahn who have appeared in many of his other spoofs. Mel Brooks plays chief pshychiatrist Dr. Richard Harpo Thorndyke who had one severe phobia, and that was his fear of heights. Resident phsychiatrist Dr. Charles Montague (Korman) and head nurse Charlotte Diesel (Leachman) take advantage of this phobia, especially when Dr. Thorndyke goes to the phsychiatry convention at the Hyatt Regency in San Francisco; ""Seventeenth floor, can't get any higher.""
This film is a parody on many of Alfred Hitchcock's thrillers such as ""Vertigo"" (the main theme), ""Psycho"", ""The Birds"" and ""The Man Who Knew Too Much"". Dr. Thorndyke teams up with Victoria Brisbane (Kahn) who was in search of her father Arthur Brisbane who had been held at the Institute for the Very, Very Nervous against his will along with many of the patients by Dr. Montague and Nurse Diesel who have also attempted plots on the life of Dr. Thorndyke. Like all of Mel Brooks films, this movie will make anyone roll on the floor in laughter from start to finish as a lot of the unexpected occurs throughout such as the rock with a note tied to it come smashing through Dr. Thorndyke's bathroom window from the violent ward at the institute while brushing his teeth or the filming crew doing silly things like breaking a window pane with the camera lens. One of the best parts was when Brooks and Kahn dress and act like an old Yiddish couple attempting to go through  security screening with a loaded gun at San Francisco Airport, ""I BEEPED! I BEEPED!"" This movie is great for Mel Brooks fans and a film that is highly recommended. ""High Anxiety, You Win!""",1085443200,,1746,4.781456953642384
369459,4,6301797973,"For my money, the best Mel Brooks' movies are the ones that he doesn't appear or barely appears in, like THE TWELVE CHAIRS, YOUNG FRANKENSTEIN, and THE PRODUCERS. This film is one of the exceptions. Also, for my money, the best Mel Brooks' movies are those that are flat out parodies of film genres--like BLAZING SADDLES and SPACEBALLS. This film is the highest achievement of his parodic form.
HIGH ANXIETY is Alfred Hitchcock on goofballs. The references are wide-ranging: ""Psycho"", ""The Birds"", ""Vertigo"" (the main parody plot), ""The Man Who Knew Too Much"", ""Notorious"", etc. The result is out and out Brooks' mania, and, of course, a certain reverence to Hitchcock. My only negative comment isn't specific to this film but it does apply: most parodies run out of gas during the course of a feature length film. Once the novelty wears off, the film kind of lags. That's why the best film parodies are usually skits on variety or comedy television shows. Probably the only exception to my theory would be 1980's ""Airplane"". (See my review of that for a further explanation.) Still, HIGH ANXIETY has enough manic energy to sustain it for the most part. It's a clever film and extremely entertaining.",1084924800,30,1200,4.887254901960785

It stars Mel Brooks, the director, but the best acting comes from his girlfriend, Madeline Kahn. This is one of Madeline's best roles, as my brother says. She gets the best lines in the entire movie!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

369463,4,6301797973,"As funny as anything Mel Brooks has ever done, if there's any drawback to this movie it's that it was preceded by his comic masterpieces 'The Producers', 'Blazing Saddles' and 'Young Frankenstein'.  Everything Brooks has done since then has been continuously compared to this zany trifecta and that is both unfortunate and unfair.  His body of work is a frequent staple of late night cable television, a testament to his longevity; many of his spoofs that have followed are equally as humorous and inventive, with several of them still enduring to this day garnering admirers and enthusiasts among those just getting an introduction to him.  A gem of a movie 'High Anxiety' is an affectionate spoof of the unchallenged cinematic Master Of Suspense Alfred Hitchcock.  Brooks takes stabs at but never skewers the Master with his sharp satirical sword as he does everything and everyone else.  He pushes the envelope as far he needs to in getting some genuine belly laughs out of Hitchcock's classic films, most notably 'Vertigo' and 'Spellbound' but managing to include references to nearly all of his works.  Included here is an obvious parody of Jaws, the well-known villain from many Bond films; future film director Barry Levinson, who was also one of the screenplay's co-authors, as a bellboy who has taken one too many orders; comedian and actor Ron Carey as Brooks' chauffeur/sidekick Brophy; and of course Brooks movie regulars Harvey Korman, Cloris Leachman, Madeline Kahn and Howard Morris providing their usual excellent and hilarious comedic support.
While it hasn't attained the same eminent status as his earlier and more polished films did, 'High Anxiety' has still managed to reach another rare pinnacle within a film fanatic; whenever I get into a discussion about one of Brooks' movies inevitably someone will say ""Remember that part in 'High Anxiety' where..."" well, you can finish this statement for yourself.  As any movie buff knows this is the tried and true method of a film worthy of bearing the stamp of ""a classic"".  Whether or not you agree will depend largely on how much of a fan you are of Mel Brooks' style of humor.  If you do watch keep a sharp eye out for a sight gag as he exits the airport in the beginning of the film; it's so subtle and uncharacteristic of a Brooks movie that it is likely to be overlooked.",1039996800,4,2344,4.8841309823677586

His ""usual suspects"" includes Madeline Kahn (""Jeans, I bet they're tight"")and Cloris Leachman (""Braces? You may kill Thorndike"") - as funny here as in Young Frankenstein. Brooks does it all as writer, director and star. His New York accent playing perfectly in the airport scene - ""Celery, you have to bring on the plane? No sir! I don't like the bloody mary they make on the plane with the snappy and the peppy!"" He even belts out the title tune in the perfect send up of a lounge singer.

I don't know any McGuffin!"", etc.  The one scene that was cut from the TV version and is in the video version is an airport flasher, which I didn't think was too horrible not to show on TV.  I just think this was a really strange editing job.  Did I see the director's cut on TV?  Why did they choose to cut all those scenes from the video version?  This boggles my mind as much as the infamous octopus scene that was cut from the Goonies but is mentioned in the last scene when they emerge from the caverns.

369539,5,6301797973,"When I was a kid, I was a Hitchcock addict.  When I saw this movie at 12 or 13, I laughed so hard I cried.  I saw it at the right age, because the humor is pretty sophmoric.  What's wrong with that?  At least it's clever, unlike a lot of the tripe they call comedy today.  This is one of my cult movies.  I must have seen it at least 10 times.  Just thinking about it makes me chuckle.  The comic timing is impeccable.  The cast is wonderful.  Cloris Leachman as Nurse Diesel, with the cold eyes, red bun, hairy lip, pointy boobs, permanent scowel, and overwhelming dominance, has to be one of the funniest characters ever.  Harvey Korman is hysterical.  The cinematography is terrific.  The camera approching the window, looking down from above, and, the best, from underneath the glass coffee table.  There are so many terrific moments in this movie (the look on Thorndyke's face when he's about to land, the woman in the airport, the orchestra, the shower scene, the birds, Brofy's enlargements, and, especially, being ""loud and annoying"") that it's impossible to mention them all here.
I actually came here looking for it on DVD, and was upset to see no record of it.  A director's commentary would be much appreciated.  How about a side-by-side juxtaposition of ""High Anxiety"" and Hitchcock scenes?",994377600,,1303,4.699115044247788
369540,5,6301797973,"I loved this movie when I saw it in 1978 on HBO and was merely 10 years old. I hadn't yet been exposed to Hitchcock's genius, yet I loved the movie even then! Of course now having seen just about every Alfred Hitchcock film ever made and loving quite a few, particulary Vertigo, Rear Window and Shadow Of A Doubt... I now fully understand just how thorough and thoughtful High Anxiety is and what a loving tribute it is.. more than just a simple comic send-up. Mel Brooks jams loads of funny scenes into his telling of the story of Dr. Richard Thornhill (Brooks) taking the reins of The Psychoneurotic Institute For The Very, VERY Nervous as the former head of the place has mysteriously disappeared. The place is loaded with loonies... running it that is.. including Chloris Leachman and Harvey Korman (both at their peaks) and eventually they frame Dr. Thornhill for the murder of another institute employee (of all people... Dick Van Patten!) who's ready to blow the whistle on the shady (and freakishly, fiendishly funny) Leachman and Keitel. Thornhill, on the run, hooks up with the adorable and hugely funny Madaline Kahn (also at the peak of her success) who also happens to be the daughter of the mysteriously missing former head of the institute. Some of the best moments are homages to The Birds, Vertigo and Psycho. But Mel Brooks crams plenty of his own original humor into the film and it hits the bulls eye.. including a scene where he and Madaline Kahn must act annoying and loud to get through an airport security check point. This movie is a joy to watch and it absolutely is as funny 23 years later as it was when it was.. it seems.. overlooked back at the time of its release. Enjoy it!",984182400,2,1705,4.593442622950819
369541,5,6301797973,"For some reason, High Anxiety is not nearly as admired as some of Mel Brooks' other films. I don't think I've ever read a truly glowing review of High Anxiety. No one really hates it, but no one really likes it, either. Roger Ebert explained that because Alfred Hitchcock's films contained so much humor, High Anxiety, as a satire was unnecessary and redundant.
If this is indeed the rationale for High Anxiety's lukewarm reception, then I personally think that ALL of the critics just don't get it. While it's true that Hitchcock films contain loads of humor (Robert Donat's political speech in The 39 Steps, the auction scene in North By Northwest and Alec McCowen's ""gourmet"" meals in Frenzy come to mind), the most vivid Hitchcock moments are dead serious. The burning of Manderley in Rebecca, the fight on the merry-go-round in Strangers on a Train, the bell tower scene in Vertigo, the cropduster attack in North By Northwest and, of course, the shower scene in Psycho are deadly serious scenes. These are the moments that Brooks spoofs in High Anxiety. The humor is dead on, giving the serious Hitchcock buffs several gigantic laughs throughout the film.
Take, for example, Brooks' take on the shower scene from Psycho. Director Barry Levinson plays a psychotic bellboy who is pushed over the edge by Brooks' repeated requests for a newspaper. He bursts into Brooks' hotel bathroom and ""stabs"" him with the newspaper. Brooks duplicates every angle and visual detail of the original, right down to Janet Leigh's fuzzy bathroom slippers. He uses ink from the newspaper to simulate the blood swirling down the drain in Psycho. It's a obvious target, but Brooks presents the scene with such care and such genuine affection for the original that it work beautifully as both satire and an homage.
Brooks recognizes that even though Hitchcock was one of the most innovative and technically brilliant filmmakers of all time, even he, like every other director, relied on favorite storytelling devices. For example, Brooks and Ron Carey are driving down the highway discussing a psychiatrist who recently died under mysterious circumstances. When Carey declares that he thinks it was murder, ominous string music, a la Bernard Herrmann, comes blasting onto the soundtrack. Brooks and Carey look out the window of the car and see the Los Angeles Philharmonic in a bus next to them, providing on-the-spot musical accompaniment. Because Hitchcock was such a master craftsman, these ""cliches"" never got in the way of the audience's enjoyment of the film. However, Brooks recognizes these ""cliches"" and brilliantly spoofs them.
I wish the critics would take another look at High Anxiety and recognize that it belongs right beside The Producers, Blazing Saddles, Young Frankenstein, Silent Movie and History of the World Part I as one of Mel Brooks' best. If any director is a ripe target for satire, it's Alfred Hitchcock. It's a tribute to The Master that hits its target dead center.",981590400,30,2978,5.0425963488843815
