8398951,3,B003KU2ZNW,"Pros:
-Covers war aviation history

Cons:
-Cheaply produced

This documentary seems fitting for a museum display.  It covers the history of military aviation from world war 1 to modern day.  Some of the footage is used repeatedly and a few times it was just a black screen with narration.  I thought it was so-so, but it does not have the polish of modern documentaries.",1403395200,,370,4.71875
