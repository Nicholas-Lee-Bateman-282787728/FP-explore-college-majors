8596276,5,B00DQCRF6Q,"Dr. Yang & Sifu Ben Warner have produced a martial arts work out video that is second to none.  This work out routine covers all the important basics, and can be utilized not just by teenagers but by adults also.  Sifu Ben Warner not only reviews numerous techniques, work out routines, and stances in detail but includes the moral martial arts principles also which I found just as important for teenagers learning how to get in shape studying martial arts.

  I exercise to this DVD on a regular basis when I cannot attend the actual classes, and I recommend this one to anyone else interested in learning from Dr. Yang's remarkable school.  5 stars.",1401580800,2,652,4.675438596491228
8596277,5,B00DQCRF6Q,"I highly recommend this DVD -I bought it and found it to be an excellent gift for my teenage nephew. As far as I can tell its the best in its class for Kung Fu training and generally for generating good physical and mental health in kids. Ben Warner (who now runs the venerable YMAA Boston school) has put together a first-rate program that works for beginning through intermediate Kung Fu training. I found hIs hefty hour and forty five minute DVD was packed with information, techniques and philosophy. Theres a comprehensive workout with concise, simple instructions as well as a detailed section to refine techniques so your teen can6 grow with the DVD as you develop. My nephew loves it. I think its a really good value delivering superior training.",1385769600,3,754,4.763358778625954
8596278,4,B00DQCRF6Q,"They did a really good job filming this. I liked how they broke down each stage so you can pick what you want to work on. This does not replace an instructor but it's a good additive and if you put effort into it you can get a good work out. This is something to play with if you are interested in doing martial arts.

8596279,4,B00DQCRF6Q,"I found this DVD to be one of the best I have seen.  Content, arrangment, and filming are well done.  The workouts are broken down into function:  Technique, Strength, Speed, and Power training. Also a Pre and Post stretching section.  There is a separate Detail section where every technique and stance used is discussed and demonstrated. I found this DVD to be an excellent workout and instruction not just for teens, but also quite a challenge for someone older like myself.  Wonderful product.",1377648000,4,497,4.9397590361445785
8596280,5,B00DQCRF6Q,"The good thing about this type of training is that you do not need special equipment , gear, or background music. All you need is the desire to learn. I teach a kids Shaolin style class and I know from first hand experience that it can sometimes be difficult to keep teens interested and motivated. As always with YMAA DVDs , this one is professionally filmed, clearly divided into manageable sections and stays on track so it is easy to follow along with the instructor. This DVD is rated level II, however, beginners at level one will find some fun drills and advanced students and teachers may even find some new ways to motivate teen students. Strength , speed, power, potential and safety, all packed in one DVD for a very reasonable price.",1377043200,6,745,4.609022556390977
8596281,5,B00DQCRF6Q,"At first I was skeptical that I would be able to learn real Kung Fu in one and a half hours but it's true! all the movies were so right! punches! kicks! blocks! I'm practically a Ninja!

Let me explain you a thing about myself, I am not a teen, although I am what my kids have described as a ""cool dad"" and I wanted to test this video out before I let my kids try it, but something crazy happened after I watched this video, people on the street started noticing my skills! and I was not only being challenged to fights by 78 year old street-fighters, but I was arrested by the cops! My fists had become dangerous weapons and I was required to license them! Please read this review and take it seriously, This DvD is the real thing, and if you know someone who has watched it be afraid because they have become powerful kung fu practitioners.

Final thoughts: Wonderful product.",1376697600,6,878,4.315151515151515
