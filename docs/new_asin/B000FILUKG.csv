8123318,3,B000FILUKG,"I love these old exploitation movies, and I love Rue McClannahan, who was obviously typecast early! I never got to see these types of movies on late-night TV when I was growing up, before home video and internet.  I think they were still banned by the FCC or some other morality group! I started buying these movies from Sinister Cinema back when I had my first VCR....back then a $19.99 video was considered cheap!
Well, my copy of 'Five Minutes to Love' is apparently long gone, so I was shopping around here today for a replacement.
What I am writing about this at all for is that I noticed that Amazon recommended that this double-feature could be purchased together with 'Five Minutes to Love' as if you would then have three Rue McC. movies.  Well- you would still only have 2, because 'The Rotten Apple' is just another title for 'Five Minutes to Love'!",1370217600,2,860,4.577922077922078
8123319,1,B000FILUKG,"Both films are the kind of movie that was probably perfect for the drive-in back in the fifties or early sixties. You could completely ignore it  while making out with your date (or drinking some beer with your high school buds) and not miss a thing. Very low budget, stupid story lines. I'm sure Rue McClanahan would have preferred that these movies had been allowed to remain unresurrected, instead of tarnishing her image after she had passed away. She no doubt had to do crap like this before she established herself as a legitimate actress. The story lines may had been rather risque for the time but are laughable today.  As far as the implied suggestion that these movies are sexy, forget about it. A brief moment of bare flesh in one of the films appeared to be a body part shot from a body double. I guess if you want to see Rue is some old fashioned underwear that your granny might of worn, this might be your thing. The Something Wierd folks should be ashamed of fobbing this trash off on the unsuspecting public just to make a buck",1357257600,,1044,4.460732984293194
8123320,3,B000FILUKG,"These films are maybe not quite as campily delicious as they could be, but they are both worth watching, simply for the fact that each of them star a young and sultry Rue McLanahan, who probably wouldn't want to own up to either of these parts, if you asked her now.  In one of the films, she plays ""Poochie,"" a junkyard tramp who keeps hapless men seductively occupied while the guy who owns the lot strips their cars.  In the other one she plays a hard-luck stripper.  In the world of B or camp movies, these both fall a little short of the upper echelon.  But they stand out because in both of them Rue stands in.",1174089600,8,616,4.239316239316239
