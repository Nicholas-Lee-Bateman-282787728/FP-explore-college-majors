6379394,3,B00JLDT9MC,Although this is based on a true incident from what I read on the internet the facts are not known as to how James Mink got his daughter back.  I thought Louis Gossett was a bit old for this part and the character unwise to just hand off his daughter to what appeared in the story to be a virtual stranger.  So many sad stories from those times.  It's good this movie brings the historical event to the public's notice but would be nice to actually know what happened.  Am not sure if this was his only child but if there are any descendants of James Mink they might be able to trace their DNA to see what the mostly likely outcome was.,1492646400,2,636,4.146341463414634

6379411,5,B00JLDT9MC,Powerful and touching movie. Some graphic scenes though.  A rape scene (only her face is seen during this) and an implied second rape (her screams are heard)  At one point a slave trader rips the girl's shirt and her shoulders are exposed.  A slave is whipped and bystanders are crying.  It is truly a touching story about true love and I could not help but cry during parts especially since this is a true story.,1487808000,2,413,4.466666666666667

6379456,5,B00JLDT9MC,I liked the fact that the outcome of what happened to Mary Mink shows how her father's stubbornness and pride caused him to completely ignore her desire to fulfill her own dream. After all she ended up a slave and falling in love with one which was the opposite of what he wanted for her. Also not considering he knew nothing about William. Very Bad decision.,1464048000,,359,4.454545454545454

I just couldn't understand how her father could have been so trusting of a white man, since this happened while slavery was still rampant in the U.S.  All that I have ever read and understood was the black Canadians were former slaves or the offspring of that horrible system.

6379493,5,B00JLDT9MC,Most emotional moving/enjoyable movie,1454198400,,37,8.5
6379494,5,B00JLDT9MC,"This story reveals the conflict of two laws. Virginia says slavery is legal. Canada says slavery is illegal. Who is right? Who can ""legal"" slaves appeal to? Is the right of the state absolute? Where does morality reside, in the majority or in the human heart?

James Mink's daughter is kidnapped from freedom in Canada and then sold into slavery in Virgina. Mink recieves word. He appeals to Canadian government. They side with their fellow rulers in Virgina. The only aid Mink can find is the Quakers Underground Railroad. They provide training and transportation. Mink and his wife free the daughter at the risk of their lives.

The obvious drama is the fight to free the daughter. The subtext is the amazing support slavery recieves by the Virginia populace. Why? It is the law. This is repeated many times in the story. Mink, and the viewer, can barely believe such wickedness. The devout Quaker's clearly reject Virgina law for ""a higher law"".

Are all these Virginians evil? Story includes a scene of the slave master crying over the death of his ""Mammy"", who was beaten to death. He is heartbroken. Evil? Wicked? What? Where does law end and morality start? Where does morality start and law end?

Other films with similar theme are: ""Amazing Grace"", story about Wilberforce fighting for abolition in England; ""Belle""  about the first ruling against salvery in Britain; ""Polycarp"" which recounts the early Christian rejection of Caesar worship; and ""Hitler on Trial"" relating the effort of a Jewish lawyer to convict Hitler of murder.

 All these are real history. All these present the same question, What is the basis, the foundation of law? Majority vote or minority justice? Can ""higher"" law bring justice that the ""state"" cannot?

This is a fine drama. I wondered: ""If I was there, which side would I support? How much would I risk?"" Thought provoking.",1453680000,3,1864,4.914012738853503

6379532,4,B00JLDT9MC,"This is a good movie, but I was disappointed that the story is only loosely based on the history of Canadian James Mink rescuing his daughter Minnie (Mary in the movie) from slavery on a Virginia tobacco plantation. The escape of another slave who ended up marrying the daughter is a ""compilation"" of historical accounts of escaped slaves, and this never happened in connection with Minnie's escape.

After watching the movie, I researched biographical accounts of the Mink family. Because the account from midway through the movie to the end is fabricated/fictional, I only gave it four stars. Yet, it is a good story, holding the viewer's interest until the film's end.

The movie version has a ""happy ending"". But In real life (according to Wikipedia's biographical information on James Mink), ""after Minnie returned to Toronto, it appears she had a son, [living] with her parents...and then an arsonist [set fire] to the Mink hotel and livery. They lost everything. Eventually, trains transported people and so George and James Mink's business fizzled away. James Mink died in 1866 and it appears he was living alone near today's Windsor Arms Hotel in Toronto. He is buried in the Riverdale Cemetery in the area of Toronto known as Cabbagetown.""",1435708800,11,1249,5.028985507246377
6379533,4,B00JLDT9MC,"A friend of mine saw this movie on cable and told me about it. She was very impressed with it so I ordered it. It is a very good movie and showed an entirely different side of slavery- the father of the girl that was abducted and sold into slavery was a wealthy black man- something we weren't used to seeing. The journey that he went through to find her involved him impersonating a slave and his wife, who was white, impersonated his owner. Fine quality acting by all involved.

6379538,5,B00JLDT9MC,"This movie was very inspiring and entertaining without being preachy.  The great Louis Gossett plays the central role and is convincing as a free black, wealthy entrepreneur during slavery.  I know that it sounds oxymoronic - free, black, wealthy, entrepreneur are seldom used in one sentence to describe any black person before the emancipation proclamation.  This particular character lives in Canada.  A family friendly movie.  However, the viewers should be over 13 because of the nature of the film.  (racism, betrayal, denigration of others based purely on color).
Movie was well worth the money that I spent for it and I would recommend it highly!",1430697600,,654,5.180952380952381

It is a good teaching tool and it belongs in your video library no matter what race you are.  The DVD itself is in execllent condition and was delivered on time.
