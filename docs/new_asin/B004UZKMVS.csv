8442509,5,B004UZKMVS,"The quality of this Celestial Pictures presentation is 5/5.... upscaling this remastered edition looks almost like Blu-ray. (Sadly, the  Weinstein presentation looks like a VCD put onto a DVD in comparison).
This version does NOT have english track
This version IS region 3 as it notes
The audio track is outstanding!",1385078400,,317,5.215686274509804
