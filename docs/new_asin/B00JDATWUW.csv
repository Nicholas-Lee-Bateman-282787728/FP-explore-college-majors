8649806,5,B00JDATWUW,"Mostly accurate historically based on what I have read over the years.  It touches on two issues I've never before seen in a WW I film or documentary.  I've read about them in many books but have never seen them in film before.  It shows the deceit and lies of Edward Grey in the early 1900s in making secret deals with France, and Russia by extension, committing the British people and their government to support these nations, without their knowledge.  These commitments would later help increase the likelihood of a French-German conflict and force England into the war.  The film doesn't go as far as several books I've read on the subject but it does actually touch on the subject.  The film also shows Kaiser Wilhelm to actually be a human being and not simply some war monger or monster raping women and eating children alive, etc, etc.  Every other film or documentary I've seen on the war follows the same government line that Germany was solely responsible for the war.  It's nice to see that apparently someone else has been reading other histories.",1517270400,,1061,4.728260869565218
8649807,5,B00JDATWUW,"It is a great pity that this superb Docu-Drama won't be able to reach a much wider ( and deserving ) public. '37 Days' was first televised in the UK in June of 2014; giving an insight into what was REALLY happening, precisely one hundred years before the real events, leading up to the First World War. This begin's with the assassination of the Heir to the Austrian Empire, Archduke Franz Ferdinand and his German born wife, Duchess Sophie, in Sarajevo, Bosnia. We are then treated to the avalanche of diplomatic activity between all the major powers of that time. All the quotations ( performed by the most excellently cast actors) are exactly as recorded on official documents at that time. There is of course some license taken, but with great scrutiny by the screen writer's, to fill in the unknown details, of personal opinions, and attitudes of the main player's. It also reveals the errors of judgement, and deliberate attempts to sway the minds of those who took the decisions. Highly recomended, to historians and those who love great drama.
