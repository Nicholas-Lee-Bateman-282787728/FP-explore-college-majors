2445495,5,B000BXJ1Y2,"I loved the humor of this too short lived sitcom and I was very surprised, then very disappointed that it was cancelled. This wacko family is a laugh out loud series. You won't be sorry for this money investment, you'll watch it over and over again.",1135641600,4,249,4.434782608695652
2445496,5,B000BXJ1Y2,"This is a fantastic series.  I was so upset when they cancelled it, because I thought it was funny as anything.  Margaret Cho had the best lines and the whole dysfunctional family were hillarious.  This is a must see.  You'll laugh until you cry.  She was so snappy and quick and sarcastic, and just wait till you see the Grandma.  All she cares about is her tv shows.  She's hilarious.
The funniest episode is the Pulp Sitcom with Quentin Tarentino.  Especially if you are a fan of Pulp Fiction you will see so many takes on it.  From the clean up scene, the story of the watch, the diner and the car.  It's quite cool and was probably really hip back then.
This dvd set is a must for all Margaret Cho fans and fans of the show.  It was and still is quite funny.",1135555200,11,763,4.1931034482758625
2445497,5,B000BXJ1Y2,"""All American Girl"" was the first sitcomedy to focus on Asian family in USA. And it starred the funny Korean comedian Margaret Cho. The show didn't last for many seasons, but it was very funny. Especially the old-world Grandma. The show was warm and clever and presented the Asian experience in a way everyone could understand and enjoy. I'll be ordering the set so my grandchildren in USA can laugh and think about what it means to be Korean-American.",1132790400,8,452,4.734177215189874

2445502,5,B000BXJ1Y2,"It's a shame that this show didn't make it beyond the first season. It seemed to have fallen victim to showbiz politics, as evidenced by the final episode's unfortunate retooling. It was a very different sitcom for the time and carried a ton of humor. Margaret Cho made her introduction to the world in a stunningly hilarious way. The show brilliantly portrayed the culture shock of a young girl growing up in America with her traditional Korean family. Another gem to this series is the incomparable Amy Hill, who delivered an Emmy-worthy performance as Grandma. After years of absence from the airwaves, it was very exciting to find that the show had finally been released on DVD. Now I can relive this wonderful, ahead-of-its-time sitcom whenever I want.",1383696000,,757,4.921875
2445503,5,B000BXJ1Y2,"this comedy started out really conservative and progressed to really cool.
by the end it was really cutting edge for an american comedy.  it wasn't great, and some parts were tiresome.  but the overall show was innovative for the time.  kudos for margaret and the cast.

i am a dedicated fan of Margaret Cho and all of her comedy shows.",1365033600,,336,4.55
2445504,5,B000BXJ1Y2,"This show was way ahead of it's time and should have been on the air longer & given time to develop further. Margaret is just plain funny and 'Grandma' is a hoot to watch too! Good, clean 'American fun!'",1363996800,,203,4.230769230769231
2445505,5,B000BXJ1Y2,"I was excited to learn that they put the whole series of All American Girl in a DVD collection.  I was a young teenager when this came out, the characters and stories spoke to me.  I understand that some of the humor came from stereotypes and some dislike that, but stereotypes wouldn't exist if there was some truth to it.  My mom for example, sorta fits Mrs. Kim in the series.  I really thoguht the episodes were funny and well written.  I guess America wasn't ready for an all Asian comedy family.  It is a shame.  I can't beleive this show is almost 20 years old.  I find the series still funny.  I just wish it last at least 3-4 years.  It is a shame.  Anyway, if you missed the show or have vague memories of it, I say get the DVD set and enjoy what could have been a great series.  While Margaret did poke fun at the lack of success of her show, her commentary with Amy Hill on select episodes were great to listen to.",1361318400,,926,4.140449438202247

I not sure about that, but the copying job seemed amaturish with pictal breakdown and a vertical band running through the copy.

2445510,5,B000BXJ1Y2,"As soon as I received this in the mail, I sat and watched every episode.

Was Excited: Someone like myself and like my family were on the small screen. There were house decorations that I had in my house or have seen at the Korean store! Margaret Cho is an icon, my idol, my favorite, and someone I want to call noonah. I loved seeing the other actors too. They seem like long lost family that returned to my life since I was in junior high when I tuned in every night to try and find out when All American Girl was going to air the next month.

Was Sad: Margaret Cho was suffering from diets and horribly negative opinions from various directions but she kept up her beautiful smile. There's one scene where she's holding a fudge bar but she probably was advised not to even lick it! How sad!

Was Disappointed (not at Cho nor other actors): Not even one guest star or extra was Korean. So while viewers griped about that, producers were trying to present this whole facade. However, the actors who played the family especially Amy Hill were really great in performing as Koreans.

Was Angry: The last episode or lost episode ticked me off. They made Margaret Cho go through hell for the show and then transform it into Korean girl version of Drew Carrey show. Maybe that's where they got idea for his show...

Was Happy: This show existed! This show was put on DVD! I own it!",1262304000,5,1377,4.3843137254901965

2445512,4,B000BXJ1Y2,"When All American Girl was first shown in Austrlia is was at 11:30pm and it was often missed, rescheduled for not shown. Seeing the complete series brought back great memories and also showed that the scope of this show was not only funny but also a real sign of the times. The only let-down to the DVD is the extra interview at the end, it went on for too long and said a nothing about the show. Great 90's flashback TV",1251936000,,420,4.197530864197531

2445515,4,B000BXJ1Y2,"I have always been a big fan of Margaret Cho.  This DVD set is difficult to find.  When I found out, I bought it sight unseen.

Unfortunately, Margaret Cho was not funny at all in this show.  But then again it is difficult to imagine Margaret Cho's brand of comedy in a G rated television show.  But Richard Pryor managed to do it with his show.

I gave this DVD set a four star rating because of Grandma.  Grandma does indeed steal the show.  I found myself looking forward to each episode to see what Grandma would do next.  Grandma made me laugh a LOT.  They should have made a series called: ""All American Grandma.""  That would have been a great, long running series.  I would have bought every season on DVD.

Except for Grandma, the show was not funny.  It is easy to see why the show failed.  If Grandma were not on the show, the show would have been cancelled much sooner.

There are three notable episodes in the series.  One episode consists of Grandma, Mom and Margaret going to the Oprah Winfrey show.  Yes, Oprah is in the episode.  Very good episode.  Another episode, ""Pulp Sitcom"" features Quentin Tarantino in which he pokes a bit of fun at ""Pulp Fiction.""  Good episode.  Another episode, the last episode of the series, is also the worst episode of the series.  It was so bad and inane that it made Three's Company look like Shakespeare.  Margaret finally has her own place with three male roommates.  Those three roommates could not make an intelligent decision if their lives depended on it.  Was painful to watch.

Bottom line, buy this to watch Grandma.  You will not be disappointed.",1213833600,2,1607,4.524475524475524
2445516,1,B000BXJ1Y2,"I don't know,,, I remember loving this show when it was on TV. Margaret Cho is one of my favorite comedians. I was so excited when I found the complete series. Well, man oh man what a disappointment. BORING!!!!!!  poor story lines, silly jokes,,,bad acting, except for amy hill who is brilliant (compared to the rest of the cast)
I mean Its got its moments but honestly its pretty bad. Maybe in the 80s it was funnier, but now........no.",1193961600,,437,4.531645569620253

I never even knew about this show when it came out, since I rarely watch tv, and accidentally found out about it.  It is a big hit at our house.  The kids LOVE the grandma and think that Margaret is really funny.  I think that some of the appeal is universal, because I'm laughing, too!",1181779200,,388,4.202702702702703
2445518,5,B000BXJ1Y2,"I've seen this series for years and still have lots of fun memory with it (especially GRANMA!).  Once I've heard that it's available in DVD format....there is no need to think twice!

2445519,4,B000BXJ1Y2,"When All American Girl first came on TV, I was so excited because - FINALLY - a TV show about how insane Asian families can be!

While many Asian Americans protested this show, due to the cast not being completely Korean, and that the show played up certain Asian stereotypes, it also showed how tough it is, growing up between two cultures.

While Margaret Cho's comedy routine is vastly superior to this show (her impressions of her mom are hysterical!  She sounds just like my mom!), this series was great, and I was very distraught when it was cancelled.",1158796800,,558,4.616161616161616
2445520,1,B000BXJ1Y2,"This is a wretched sitcom.  It wasn't very good when it was made, and the production troubles it had are well documented.  As we know, this was Margaret Cho's first (and, to date, only) sitcom, and ABC tinkered with it to the point that it sent Margaret into a tailspin personally.  They forced her to lose weight (which resulted in kidney failure), and they also hired an ""Asian consultant"", as the audience didn't believe Margaret's character was Asian enough.  After the show was cancelled, Margaret spiralled down into drugs, booze, and anonymous sex (by her own admission).  Her concert film, I'm the One that I Want, details what happened to her in sometimes painful detail.  The actual show is garbage, but, perhaps, there is a silver lining to this show being released on DVD.  If they put this manure out, they'll put anything out, and if there's a really obscure film you love, it may someday come out on DVD.",1158105600,2,919,4.70625
2445521,3,B000BXJ1Y2,"This short-lived sitcom was many people's introduction to comedienne Margaret Cho. Though it was supposed to be based on her stand-up act, in reality, it was about as far from her real personality as possible! Added to that, the writing of the show was often banal and inconsistent. In the DVD commentary, Margaret states that the network (ABC) was trying so hard to please different parties (i.e. Asians who thought the show wasn't ""Asian enough,"" and non-Asians who thought it was ""too Asian"") that the show ultimately lost its direction. That explains some of the writing shortcomings.

But with all its flaws, ""All-American Girl"" is still fun to watch for several reasons. One, Amy Hill's portrayal of ""Grandma Kim"" is endearing and very funny. In fact, it will remind many of Margaret Cho's impersonations of her real-life mother in her more recent stand-up shows. Second, there is a quirky vibe to the show that results from its odd array of characters. They range from the talented Judy Gold playing an oddball co-worker of Margaret's at the mall department store, to an 11-year-old Ashley Johnson playing an offbeat nextdoor neighbor to the Kim's (the name of Margaret's family on the sitcom), to Jodi Long portraying Margaret's strict and traditional mother, and B.D. Wong acting as her successful, superior older brother. This variety makes for ""a little something for everyone"" that ultimately gives the show the ability to appeal to different ages, races, and people from different socio-economic backgrounds.

Lastly, ""All-American Girl"" is intriguing to watch simply because it is sooo different than the Margaret Cho many of us have come to love. Given that a good chunk of her autobiography and first stand-up flick (both titled ""I'm the One That I Want"") focused on the trials and tribulations that doing the sitcom brought her, AAG has taken on a second life in recent years. Now, fans can see what all the fuss was all about, see how much she's changed, and enjoy a bit of nostalgia (yes, the show did, in fact, have a notable teenage following when it originally aired!).",1154649600,3,2091,4.9714285714285715
2445522,5,B000BXJ1Y2,"This show was my first introduction to margaret cho. The show is far from her very raw and controversial standup comedy, but it stills carries Margaret's endless wit and sense of humor. It is unfortunate that this show only had one season because it was so unique having a sitcom portray the Asian American Family.

I enjoyed this dvd set and watched the entire thing in one day.",1142899200,2,379,4.573529411764706
2445523,5,B000BXJ1Y2,"I've been a fan of Margaret's ever since purchasing her CD ""Assassin"" from iTunes.  Since then, I've caught up with most of her career.  And since yesterday, I've caught up with... let's say 99% of it by purchasing this DVD box set.

This show is crazy good!  Man, I'm not Korean, but I could relate to a lot of the stuff from the family.  I love it!

To be honest, the lack of bonus features is disappointing.  But I'm not complaining.  The show more than makes up for it.  And besides, it's cheaper than most TV shows on DVD.  At least it was for me.

So go and check this show out!  You won't be disappointed.  I promise.",1140825600,,624,4.186440677966102
2445524,5,B000BXJ1Y2,"Actually, it is not that bad at all.

Maybe the net work put too much emphasis on ""First Asian Sitcom""

so its lost the all the potential Un-Asian audience.

The show is very well written and there is not that Asian at all.

It is just a regular family sitcom that the main cast happened to be an Asian American.

I am sure if the main cast was an Italian American that show would have survived longer.

The last episode was the best episode.

Too bad they have to cancel it. The show was really heading to the good direction.

They built up the new plot and did not have a chance to use it.

The net work should let her do the sitcom again.",1139702400,2,641,4.064

2445526,5,B000BXJ1Y2,I loved this show! I was patiently waiting for it to come out and a bar I go to was giving out advanced promotional DVD boxsets! I was so lucky to get one! It was really a pity that this show was cancelled...lots of good entertainment!,1138147200,2,235,4.130434782608695
2445527,4,B000BXJ1Y2,"I became a fan of Margaret Cho after seeing ""I'm The One That I Want"", which as every Cho fan knows, is a one woman show memoir mostly about the experiences, good and bad, that Margaret had making this sitcom for ABC in the mid-1990's.

I remember ABC hyping this show and putting Margaret out as an Asian cross between Roseanne and Seinfeld, but it seemed to fade fast and I never thought anything more about it until I became a fan of her live act.

Leave it to the good people at Shout! Factory to realize how big and devout Margaret's cult following really is.  Not just that, but Margaret herself recorded commentaries and an interview on the set, which is something I was surprised to find out considering her recollection of the production of this series in I'm The One That I Want.

I cannot wait to see this show, whether it's a great underrated sitcom or a trite mess, I love Margaret Cho and this show is essential viewing for her fans.",1136419200,6,947,4.394285714285714
