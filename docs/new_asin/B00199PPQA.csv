8273019,5,B00199PPQA,"His Holiness the Dalai Lama speaks simply about deep issues.  Peace in its multi-layered complexity isn't just stopping violence on our planet.  Slowly gently we are led to the deepest meanings of peace in our individual and collective minds and hearts.  --- I've bought this DVD a few times and given it away each time.  In my elder years, out of retirement, and back in an urban high school classroom, I find that the concept of inner and outer peace is inconceivable to our youth.  Raised in a country at war on foreign soil and in its own streets, these teenagers experience violence as ""normal"" or at least usual.  --- At home after a particularly disconcerting moment at school, watching HH Dalai Lama weave ancient images of soulful peace . . . I settle, touch my soul at peace, and prepare for the next day of restless children in search of ____.  Perhaps they seek peace without even knowing it has, it can, it will exist.",1344297600,3,931,4.572289156626506

8273021,3,B00199PPQA,"This is fine quality videotaping of 3 public speeches delivered by H.H. Dalai Lama. I was disappointed that it was not teaching for the individual on inner peace. This has more to do with world peace. It is still a worthwhile product, nicely done. H.H. Dalai Lama always has a worthwhile message to share;this is just not what I had been hoping for.",1275177600,2,349,4.555555555555555
