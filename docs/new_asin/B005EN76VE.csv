8468738,1,B005EN76VE,"Four young ladies traveling the countryside (Argentina?) come across a young girl beaten and raped. They take her to the police station and discover a cop was involved. In turn they are raped, tortured, beaten, and some are killed. The revenge part takes place 15 minutes from the end which made what should have been good climatic scenes, anti-climatic.

The opening sound track of techno-death metal was decent, but then they didn't bother to use it. The English subtitles used the British spellings but also too frequently misspelled words such as ""dont"" and ""colledge."" The girls did some fast talking in the beginning as subtitles raced across the screen and then there was hardly any talking. You never got to know the characters in spite of a long poorly shot car drive scene where there was a lot of wasted silence. The film starts out claiming ""it did happen"" which is a credible as a Presidential tweet.

Now if you just want to see young girls get raped without much of a story, this is the film.

I recommend it. The Girls get revenge later. Confession: I haven't watched the revenge ending of this film yet!! But I will someday!",1427760000,,268,4.489795918367347
8468740,5,B005EN76VE,"I'm not the biggest fan of this genre but I can appreciate a good one when I see it. It's raw and unpolished in a way that feels authentic instead of contrived.

With its minimalist dialogue, some awkward amateur performances and bold soundtrack choices it definitely feels like an old school grindhouse flick from the 70's, far more than the slick Hollywood horror movies that profess to be the same thing (ala HOSTEL or HATCHET). And the faded, low-fi look of it reminds me of the old beat-up VHS of TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE I used to rent as a kid.

Check it out if you're into the cheap, grimy end of exploitation cinema.",1384214400,,624,4.513274336283186
