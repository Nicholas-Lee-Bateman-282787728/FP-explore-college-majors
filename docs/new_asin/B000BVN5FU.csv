Like The Snowman And The Falcon, it was like both movie's were made just for him. It was romantic, It was sad, it was mysterious, it was wonderful!",1389571200,,249,4.319148936170213
8093139,3,B000BVN5FU,"Alan Rudolph's MADE IN HEAVEN is a modern example of a popular genre of the 1930s and '40s: the heavenly or angel/devil fantasy. Supporting roles and cameos include several well-known musicians, creator of the single panel newspaper comic THE FAR SIDE (Gary Larson), and Debra Winger as a male spirit named Emmett. This sweet period piece is set in the 1950s.

SYNOPSIS--
Mike drowns after heroically rescuing a family trapped in a car that's plunged into a river. As a heavenly spirit, he meets and weds Annie, a brand new soul who's never been to Earth. When Annie's number is called for being born, Mike gets permission from heaven's boss, Emmett to also reincarnate, but he has only 30 years in which to find Annie. If Mike fails, he'll have to endure an unhappy life with other people that could end with his never again seeing the Pearly Gates.

The two grow up separately and lead remarkably different Earthly lives. As Mike's 30th birthday approaches, he still hasn't found Annie.

8093140,5,B000BVN5FU,"This movie, 'Made in Heaven', (1987-Timothy Hutton/Kelly McGillis)is one that will make you go hmmm,.. think I'll watch it again!
I find it perplexing and peculiar that 'Warner Studios' hasn't released this movie to DVD.  So much junk is being released from studio vaults.. so why not release a movie as well acted and interesting a story as this one. The story's premise, 'that all things', even conceptual ideas.. such as computers, are hatched in Heaven, and that we bring these inspirations to earth when we incarnate, is fun to ponder. The idea that love, people connections, and friendships that appear in our daily lives as 'dejaVu' and/or 'coincidence', are really pre-birth relationships, makes for a great story.  So, 'haven't I seen you before'?,..just might be more than a pick-up line. :)
I know at least 'six' people who would also like to buy this movie on DVD.

Timothy Hutton, is,..in my opinion, underrated in the movie industry, because he chooses stories that are interesting, thoughtful,offbeat..character driven, sorta like life can be.",1242432000,4,1058,5.1395348837209305
