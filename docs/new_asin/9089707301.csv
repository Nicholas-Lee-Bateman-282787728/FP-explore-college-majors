1172996,5,9089707301,"Any DVD that has coral and fish in it captures my attention. I can't think of anything more beautiful with the exception of jellyfish. This DVD is split into several labeled sections so you can go wherever you want. I don't listen to waves underwater, but the people who like waves have that option on this DVD.  My favorite part of the whole DVD is the Reef Movie showing seahorses with soft music playing. THAT caught my attention immediately. Seahorses are so delicate looking - they're fascinating. Especially the lacy-looking white ones. The photography on them is amazing. Coral, fish, seahorses, etc. - Love it all!",1390348800,3,622,4.867924528301887
1172997,5,9089707301,Some ambient DVD's claim to be the best and many disappoint but boy! not this one. I have a couple of those so called aquarium films and they are nothing compared to this. Firstly the images are stunning. You can see that they have used the best equipment out there and it just is awesome. I don't use the other DVD's anymore this is the one! If you like sealife and find aquariums relaxing look no further. FANTASTIC STUFF!,1389657600,,424,4.379746835443038

Very relaxing and you have a choice of background sounds such as water/ocean sounds, music or a combination of both.  I really enjoy it.

1173004,5,9089707301,"You don't have to be an aquarium enthusiast to fall in love with this DVD. Anyone with a love of Nature will be spellbound by the scenes unfolding within the wild and within the natural aquariums featured. Youll notice there are no bubbles from the camera crew, so its like having your own underwater window on a world seldom seen. The camera crew is so patient that you get, in some cases, the sensation of a fixed camera, which means whatever comes into the field of view comes in. And what comes in is often spectacular, like schools of fish so dense they appear as dark clouds that change into fantastic shapes.

There is a sense of community, as well. You don't see big fish eating the little fish; everyone seems to be minding their own business as they feed off the rocks and coral. The Tropical Reef feature really goes into the details of the reef, offering close-ups of plants that probably haven't changed much in hundreds of millions of years, so you get a sense of an eternal scene being reenacted over and over again. And theres something comforting about that, which adds to the meditative peace of this incredible DVD. When the diminutive and shy sea horses entered the field of view, and lingered, I found myself holding my breath so as not to scare them away. And the bio-luminescence of the underwater night scenes is nothing short of spectacular.

This is an experience for all ages. Children will see Nemo and adults will marvel at the panorama of colorful life below the waveswhich means, of course, seventy percent of the planet. After watching this enchanting DVD, you may begin to question why mankind had the audacity to call our planet Earth.

1173005,3,9089707301,don't like narration and music we just enjoy it most for what it is nature has it's own perfect way of potraying life as it was meant to be.,1390867200,,140,3.8620689655172415
1173006,5,9089707301,"This is also a very colorful DVD and the sounds are wonderful. Our grandson has loved each and every one of these. Made me want to buy more of different ones. We thought about the fire place with music to see how we would like that. In stressful times like we live in, we need to find ways to relax when you just can't go sit on the beach. We live so far away from a sunny one. So during the winter months these are great to have. I think anyone with children should have these. They love them.",1390435200,,494,4.0
1173007,5,9089707301,"The Ambient Collection Presents Oceanic Relaxation
 Visiting oceans & coral reefs may be breath-taking to behold, but its not plausible for everyone to visit them. Having tropical fish in your home is also beautiful, but their care & maintenance can be quite pricey. Not to mention, its impossible for the average person to own certain types of fish. Jellyfish for example, are stunning aquatic beauties, but hardly the type of animal one could readily exhibit in an aquarium. Should you be fortunate enough to see them in nature, they're too dangerous to be too close to in their habitat.
 The Ambient Collection has provided 2 DVD collections for safe, budget-friendly, aquatic entertainment. Jellyfish & Tropical Reef & Natures Aquarium are both currently offered.
 Jellyfish, filmed in HD with additional footage provided by Klemens Gann, is 2 hours of glorious jellyfish watching. Turn your television into an aquatic exhibit as you view these dancing beauties of the sea. Filmed entirely in color, youll find yourself losing track of time as you watch their unique bodies & long tentacles synchronize with the ocean around them. This DVD is programmed to play continuously on a loop.
 Tropical Reef is 110 minutes long. The Natural Aquarium scenes are of a coral reef near the Philippines. Here youll view colorful fish in addition to the reefs as they swim & play in their natural home. The Reef footage is slower than the aquarium footage. This portion of the set shows scenes of more unique sea creatures such as the dragon sea horse. Children will pick up on the clownfish made famous by Disney.
 Viewers will also get to view 6 separate sea aquariums from the Red Sea & Pacific Ocean. Pick individual aquariums to view or use the looping feature. Music in the background is courtesy of composer Simon Daum.

7901622,1,9089707301,The sound quality was poor. There was a background sound that interfered with the water sound. I had ordered 2 and played both and found both discs had the same problem.

7901624,5,9089707301,"This DVD is perfect for all aquarium fans who want to watch tropical reefs and extraordinary fish. You can choose between six different reef aquariums, all with a beautiful view on many different fish. Also, you can select a movie, which shows close-up views of unusual sea creatures. You can also freely choose the sound, either you can choose realistic water sounds or relaxing music. Thus, there is something for everyone. I particularly enjoyed the natural aquarium, where quite a lot of small fish can be seen. The different perspectives are varied, since many aquariums can be seen close-up and in others you can view larger areas. I really like this DVD.",1429660800,,661,4.910714285714286
