5942708,4,B00ESZZOLI,This set is worth getting for Claudia Jennings alone. Unholy Rollers is also one of her better outings of which there were all too few.. I had only read about Invasion of the Bee Girls before and this turned out to be a real treat solidifying William Smith's little niche in cult cinema. Decent print too. The other two titles are just okay.,1398470400,5,341,4.428571428571429
5942709,4,B00ESZZOLI,"Invasion of the Bee girls I had seen before, so I knew liked that. Unholy Rollers was good camp, Devils 8 was a good action flick w/ the late and great Christopher George. I thought Viscous Lips was dumb.",1394755200,5,204,4.256410256410256
5942710,5,B00ESZZOLI,"This is a great compilation of movies. A must have for any fan of cult movies, Invasion of the b girls alone is worth the price.",1394409600,4,128,3.9615384615384617
5942711,5,B00ESZZOLI,"First off, to fully appreciate this release, you have to love these types of films to begin with.  They are simple movies with simple stories that do not require a lot of thought or emotional investment.  No deep symbolism, no intellectual deciphering required, just trashy, silly, nostalgic fun.  These 4 films look fantastic, and are all presented in anamporphic wide, in spite of the erroneous box specs for Unholy Rollers.  The audio is great as well.  The soundtrack for Unholy Rollers is a stand-in soundtrack, but it fits just fine, and is not a distraction, and certainly doesn't take away from the film itself.  The only movie that feels out of place here is Vicious Lips.  The story doesn't make much sense, and frankly was a chore to get through, in spite of one VERY funny scene involving a scrolling digital message.  It does have some fun 80's style New Wave/Glam/Pop Metal outfits and enjoyable tunes, though, so it isn't a complete waste of space.  Bee Girls and Unholy Rollers, on the other hand, were just EXACTLY the kind of movie a drive-in film lover is after.  I do wish Roberta Collins had a bigger part in Unholy Rollers, but oh well, at least there's lots of Candice Roman.  It's nice to see a couple of the Bird Cage/Doll House girls in different kinds of roles.  The surprise gem, for me, was The Devil's 8.  Having never heard of it, and not particularly drawn in by the description, I almost didn't even watch it.  But man, would I have missed out!  I watched it last, and discovered it is actually the best of the lot!  This is a fantastic men's prison-break movie with LOTS of explosions and action galore.  Anyway, I am very satisfied w/ this package, and will likely view these films many more times on a lazy Sunday afternoon.",1389571200,16,1760,4.607717041800643
5942712,1,B00ESZZOLI,"First, pictures are not clear.  Second, I cannot recall what I have just seen.  No plot.  Third, its pricing as a whole, is not justified.
Yes, I am disappointed.",1389398400,5,162,4.517241379310345
5942713,5,B00ESZZOLI,"I was very pleased with this dvd set once I got it. Like I heard the full frame listing for Unholy Rollers was a typo. It's in anamorphic widescreen and shares the 2nd disc of this two disc set with Vicious Lips. No extras on the 2nd disc and like I had some fair warning about Shout Factory had to use a widescreen print of Unholy Rollers which contained the synthesized musical score used on the old vhs tape release,but luckily the film itself was not vhs quality. Shout Factory either couldn't afford music royalty fees on the original soundtrack or just couldn't get the music right's owner  to sell them the music rights,so the print is a musically edited print. It runs 88 minutes and 4 seconds while a streaming copy on Amazon Prime from MGM runs 89 minutes and 24 seconds. Again something to do with the music rights,but the print is a nice widescreen print in either form. You just get the original soundtrack if you watch it streaming,so if you want a widescreen dvd hard copy buy the Shout Factory disc otherwise you can stick with the streaming copy on Amazon prime if you have an Amazon Prime account. Also another typo  Invasion Of the Bee Girls is listed as running 85 minutes. That was closer to the run time of the old MGM disc which was cut. This new MGM widescreen print restores a minute and a half's worth of footage. Shout Factory's copy of Bee Girls is close to being the uncut widescreen master(containing all of Beverly Powers' naughty scene toward the end. But the small dialogue bits missing from the old MGM Midnight Movies dvd are still missing at the end). Just checked my dvd twice and compared it alongside a public domain print of Invasion Of the Bee Girls. The nudity is intact,but a line by Victoria Vetri at the end is still cut. Invasion Of The Bee Girls shares disc 1 with The Devil's 8 and when you get to the dvd menu you see a play trailer option listed for Bee Girls. Luckily it's the uncensored theatrical trailer(Youtube for years had a more PG rated edited trailer up). Invasion Of The Bee Girls runs actually 86minutes and 14 seconds including MGM logos,but this is only 14 seconds shorter than the public domain prints I've seen. Also the slightly shorter run time compared to the full frame public domain prints probably is because of the line by Victoria Vetri is still missing. This widescreen print contains all the same footage as the full frame P.D. prints minus some bits of dialogue at the end. So I recommend this set to anyone into Claudia Jennings films and Anitra Ford/William Smith films. Plus you get two more movies in this set which are more obscure than Bee Girls and Unholy Rollers.",1387065600,68,2648,4.53765690376569

8609102,4,B00ESZZOLI,"Picked this up at the local flea mkt - sorry Amazon! But for one problem, I'd give it 5 stars: The teeth-grindingly bad substitute soundtrack for UNHOLY ROLLERS. Why, Shout Factory, WHY?! This synth mess is apparently from an earlier VHS release and mars what would otherwise be an engaging Claudia Jennings vehicle. It's too loud most times, and completely distracts whenever it's there - basically 80s porno music scotch-taped over a 70s grindhouse film. The worst comes during an important character scene in a bar where we're hearing 80s syth sax and piano, but the rockers onstage are playing guitar, bass, and drums. ARGH!

I've frisbeed DVDs out the window for similar infractions (now the current owner of my former copy of THE DELIGHTFUL FOREST knows where it came from!), so why still 4 stars? BEE GIRLS. It's the best kind of sexploitation. It's like watching your favorite 70s cop show, and out of nowhere there's gratuitous naked breastitude. Normally, a TV feel in a feature film is a bad thing, but its made-for-the-small-screen flavor creates a wonderful psychological, nay, psychotronic friction whenever the jiggling starts. It's not PERFECT: The climax isn't as spectacular as everything that leads up to it, and there's a gnarly attempted rape scene that just doesn't need to be there - yeah, it shows what a badass our protagonist is when he arrives on the scene to bust it (and the perps) up, but...it doesn't feel right in the overall (fun) tone of the movie. What movie's perfect? BEE GIRLS is a sexy (in the cheesiest, stupidest sense of the word), trashy and funny look at the sexual mores of the 70s and worth the purchase price alone.

DEVIL'S 8 is godawful, but in a good way. It'll never be your favorite movie, but I'm not sorry I watched it. It felt like it was missing Joel Robinson, Tom Servo and Crow sitting in front of me, and not just because Ross Hagen is in it. Or Joe Turkel. I nearly spit my booze all over my monitor during the end credits when I found the earworm theme music (I'd been singing ""Spanish Bombs"" to it all during the movie, and you will too, or maybe ""...Robin Hood and Little John runnin' through the forest..."") had LYRICS, which serve as something of a map of the characters and conflicts. It'll make you miss the days when the worst bad guys you could think of were hillbilly bootleggers with the local politicians in their overalls' pockets.

VICIOUS LIPS is just plain, unenjoyable crap. It should have been edited down to a four minute rock video - there was enough meaningful dialogue and plot to fit exactly that.

Overall, though? Worth a double-o.",1482105600,,2616,4.717724288840262

8609107,1,B00ESZZOLI,"You know, I have enjoyed nearly all of these ""cult movie"" type of releases that have been hitting the market over the last decade or so, but this one's an exception: Not enough sex and nudity to be titillating; not enough weird indie cheapness to be funny; not enough quality filmmaking to be interesting. I'm trying to figure out why all of these other reviewers are so high on this, because I felt pretty robbed.

""Unholy Rollers"" has no internal logic (shy, chaste girl shows up to a roller derby, then turns into a bloodthirsty wench practically overnight?); ""Invasion of the Bee Girls"" is sorely lacking on promises of sexiness (in nearly every potential shot of nudity, the director cuts camera right before the goods are shown); ""The Devil's Eight"" seems totally out of place here (movie about a bunch of male convicts on the run partnered with three other films about strong, sexy women? how does that fit?); and ""Vicious Lips"" is just downright unwatchable, low-end tripe that tries too hard to be ironic (I couldn't even give you a description other than ""boring"").",1461888000,,1075,4.8108108108108105
