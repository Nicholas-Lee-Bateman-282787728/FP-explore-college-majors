8110334,1,B000EHUH3O,"but horrible bootleg DVD! They are simply stealing the remastered versions from IVL DVDs made in Hong Kong, which were done with incorrect NTSC masters in the first place. If you want the film, simply wait till next year when the legit release is coming out from Image in the U.S. I honestly can't believe Amazon would allow this to be sold on here due to the chance of lawsuit by Image who owns the rights in the US.",1160870400,3,417,4.291139240506329
8110335,5,B000EHUH3O,"One of the best Shaw Brothers and Kung Fu flicks I've seen (& I've seen hundreds).  Awesome choreography and fight scenes, good swordplay, and very cool scenes & settings.  The plot is not typical, and the movie is pretty bloody.  The remastered version is great, with clear audio & video.  A must see for fans of the genre!!!",1149379200,5,326,4.568965517241379
