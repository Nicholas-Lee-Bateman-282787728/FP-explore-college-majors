2054504,4,B00021LL4G,"this is a good movie if you like over developed women in a chessy b-movie and like all b-movies that I have seen the story line suck but the over developed women gettint naked is worh seeing it. women like raven de-lacroix from russ meyer films and angela aymes the woman in the movie bashlor party at the start of the move getting pic of her child. yes that one. it like a cheesy remake of enter the dragon. instead of bruce lee and other men fight in a tournament for some weird bad guy, you have women doing it.",1290470400,,514,4.15
2054505,3,B00021LL4G,"This movie lacks all creditability but it's also an old favorite of mine. I've been hoping it will come out on DVD so I can see it again but no luck on that front so far. I really loved this movie in the 80's, when it stood as one of the few 'women kicking butt' films in existence. Movies like this shouldn't be lost to time and disinterest. However, female exploitation movies have a really bad name vs black exploitation films. Perhaps that because women didn't have a hand in shaping exploitation films that showed them out of the normal constraints of the current social mores. I loved this film as a teenager because woman were doing things that the society around me was saying women couldn't do. Today a woman on a motorcycle with a gun as the hero isn't seen as daring, or unheard of, but whne I saw this film, it was shocking. Bring this movie and others like it to DVD. I'd stand in line for a copy.",1256256000,7,910,4.296511627906977

Being a recluse on his own private island, the only way to get to him is via a martial arts contest. (Sound familiar yet?) She recruits the ample Raven De La Croix and convict Angela Aames to help. Some laughable fights and an almost complete collapse into farce are compensated for by the quasi-occult overtones, camp, bad one-liners, and high T&A value.

2054509,3,B00021LL4G,"Transfer is fine, but doesn't appear to be much of an upgrade from the DVD. No extras. Not even a menu! The definition of bare bones, which is too bad, because the DVD (also from Polyscope, same company) has a commentary by filmmaker Wynorski that is wonderfully insightful.

Also, what's up with the weird cover art? The original art was fantastic, but is missing from both Polyscope versions.

2054513,4,B00021LL4G,"I mean for real sleaze and quasi porn you should go to the Women in Prison movies like ""Women in Cages"" or for those with a strong stomach the Illsa movies.

This is kind of a 70s movie made in the 80s.  It's got spy stuff, martial arts stuff, James bond stuff and Charlies Angels/Jiggle/Playboy stuff crazily crammed into one.  It'd be a PG perhaps a G movie without the bits of nudity and oomph, but nothing too graphic and explicit. Overall its a fun movie.  ""Critics"" screamed at it like it was toxic waste and wished they could give it 20 turkeys, that's how Bad=Good it is.",1447200000,,579,4.333333333333333
2054514,3,B00021LL4G,This is a deliberately tongue in cheek B-Movie with women as the heroes. The plot is thinly scripted. There is some brief female nudity and a lot of shots of the heroines in bikinis. I suspect that this movie is exactly what it set out to be; cheap and mildly titillating. The doomsday device at the end is oddly phallic but the action sequences are amusing enough. As a movie to be watched after a night out at the pub with low expectations I'd say it's perfect. An intellectual challenge it certainly isn't but then it wasn't supposed to be was it?,1447113600,6,550,4.401960784313726

2054516,2,B00021LL4G,"More cliches and bad puns than 'The Muppet Show', but at least that was funny. The synopsis was misleading to me. Somehow I thought we were going into the distant past and we ended up in the 80s. Another movie that falls short of it's implied promise. You would think with all that impressive cleavage that there would be much more nudity, instead we get moldy cheese. The funniest part of this flick is Rober Tessier's (you  know his face, but not his name) disappearing/reappearing eyebrows, you could make a game out of when they will be there and when they will not. In fact he seems to be the only one who can act, everyone else says their lines and then moves on.",1444521600,2,669,4.395161290322581

Pure 80's synth music (which actually gets annoying). The budget was low, but that doesn't always mean a movie will be bad. In this case, it was just bad writing, bad acting, and no real fun to trod through. No amount of women in bikinis can save this film unfortunately.",1425081600,2,419,4.3164556962025316

2054538,4,B00021LL4G,"""The Lost Empire,"" written and directed by Jim Wynorski, is a combination of James Bond films (outrageous villains), Kung Fu flicks (lots of fight scenes), and Andy Sidaris movies (whose motto was bullets, bombs and babes).  This also includes a Women-In-Prison movie scene, featuring a fight between inmates Heather McClure (blonde beauty Angela Aames), and leather-clad dominatrix Whiplash (Angelique Pettyjohn).  That's immediately followed by the obligatory Women-In Prison movie shower scene with Heather.  Melanie Vincz is very convincing as the lead actress Angel Wolfe.  Super-stacked Raven De La Croix (Russ Meyer's ""Up!"") is stunningly beautiful as Native American Whitestar, and appears topless in one very memorable scene.  The three lead actresses are not only gorgeous and sexy, they're equally adept at action scenes and tongue-in-cheek comedy.  The film moves along briskly, and is very entertaining.",1409443200,25,916,5.7481481481481485

Not a bad film, for a mix of Phantom Empire and Enter the Dragon, with a little Big Trouble in Little China thrown in.",1405814400,2,358,4.609375

2054542,5,B00021LL4G,"Yes its 16.9 Anamorphic,Here's what DVD Beaver Review had to say about the technical merit.
 Good film from Jim Wynorski.

Polyscope's progressive, anamorphic widescreen (2.23:1) transfer marks the first time the film has been available on home video in its correct aspect ratio since the film's theatrical release (the import DVDs of the film are sourced from panned-and-scanned masters). The opening looks softer, but the commentary explains that the crew did not have anamorphic lenses for the first day so the footage was framed for scope and converted in post, the colors are vibrant, and the source seems very clean apart from some debris during the reel changes and opticals. The bitrate certainly should have been higher as the encoding is a bit noisy during grainier passages and edge enhancement is sometimes quite ugly. It's still the best the film has looked on home video.

The Dolby Digital 2.0 mono audio conveys the throbbing synth score more clearly than the dialogue, but that is probably the fault of the original mix (the ADR'd voices - including that of Angus Scrimm in scenes with his stand-in - are clearer than some of the on-set audio). Extras include an audio commentary by director Jim Wynorski - in which he explains that the film was planned for 3D only for the crew to discover that the lenses did not work on the first day of shooting and that the stock footage came from unused outtakes from OUR MAN FLINT - as well as ten soundtrack cues. Since the images under the soundtrack cues are static, they probably could have cut down on the bitrate for them and allocated some more to the feature.

2054543,5,B00021LL4G,"Any cult fan worth their salt has seen at least one film by director Jim Wynorski. Chopping Mall, The Return of Swamp Thing, Munchie, Dinosaur Island, Ghoulies IV, Deathstalker II, the list goes on and on and on. The Guy has 96 directing credits in total, and The Lost Empire is his first.

A kick ass attractive blonde super cops schlubby partner is murdered by some hypnotist/ninja guys via spinning ninja stars. They belong to a secretive sect that lives on an island. The only way for her to investigate the murder is to answer an ad in the paper put up by the sect. Theyre looking for kick ass attractive women to join up. Our hero is a shoe in but theres one catch. Entries have to come in three, so she has to find two partners to infiltrate the island, kick some ass and save the day. She gets a Native American and a convict to fill out the trifecta and along with her mustacheoed FBI agent boyfriend (also an ass kicker), they get on the island and give em hell.

Funded by a guy looking for a tax loss (it wasnt), this is the first time a young Jim showed the world what he had to offer. Part fantasy, part Enter the Dragon knock off, part buddy cop flick, and part T & A schlock fest, The Lost Empire gave me everything I was looking for. Ridiculous fight scenes, awful one liners, boobs, blood, broad racial stereotypes, a lazer that looks like a cock n balls, a John Carpenter-esque soundtrack, and a heaping helping of cheese. Angus Scrimm of Phantasm fame plays a small but fun role that gave him the opportunity to deliver some grade B lines and chew the scenery like he was starving. Robert Tessier of Hard Times and Starcrash also gets to deliver some quote worthy lines. Its always nice to see his bald head pop up in flicks since his time on earth was so short. At 83 minutes the film moves at lightning speed from setup to setup rarely pausing for air. The film is about as deep as a puddle and I wouldnt have it any other way. I had so much fun watching this that Im sure it will be shown at my house for friends many many times.

The Lost Empire has charm and cheese buy the bucketful. Im very glad this is finally available on dvd after being stuck in rights-holder hell for many years. Its presented in widescreen and isn't a vhs rip though the overall picture quality isn't stellar but you can bet it hasn't looked this good since 1985. Its a high recommend for 80s adventure fans and anyone who enjoys great B-movies. Did I mention its cheesy? Cuz its cheesy. Nacho convention level cheese. Joe Bob Briggs would tell you to check it out.",1398297600,17,2565,4.328482328482329
2054544,5,B00021LL4G,"If you're a Jim Wynorski fan, this is a must.  The Lost Empire is b-movie balls to the wall.  Babes, fights, jilted dialogue, and that wonderful b-movie touch that can't be reproduced.  Polyscope has also delivered a cleaned up version of the film that looks stunning.  No more pan and scan!",1398297600,7,291,4.647058823529412
2054545,5,B00021LL4G,"The DVD quality is pretty good.  The image is in 2:35-1 widescreen, although I'm not certain if it is anamorphic or not.  Color values vary in some scenes, and the sound is a bit low, but overall this is a significant improvement over the long out-of-print (full-frame) VHS tape.  A director's audio commentary track is included.  I will say that the disc's menu is quite difficult to operate.

The film is about a trio of women warriors who journey to a forbidden island in search of a monstrous tyrant.  It is a spoof, and cleverly lampoons a variety of genres, such as gladiator films, women-in-prison flicks, ""mysterious island"" science-fiction epics, and even Russ Meyer ""girlie"" pictures.

There was a later German Blu-ray that was an improvement over the US release, but it seems to be out of print at present.

It doesn't seem that a Blu-ray version is also being released.",1398211200,2,881,4.788079470198675
2054546,5,B00021LL4G,"How best to describe this long overlooked treasure? Imagine Enter The Dragon... but with busty broads instead of guys. Tough as nails female cop Angel Wolfe (Melanie Vincz) assembles a team of girl fighters; ex-con Heather McClure (Angela Aames) and Cherokee warrior woman Whitestar (Raven De La Croix) (Yes... THE Raven De La Croix... that one!) to infiltrate the sinister island fortress of evil immortal Dr Sin Do (no really... that's his name.) Seems this evil mastermind is running some sort of tournament/training camp for the super women of tomorrow... or some such tosh... Whilst plotting world domination via the use of magic crystals... or a giant laser beam... or something...I mean... who cares about the plot? Bob Tessier is in it playing, I think, two parts (it's not clear really... but upon his death he vows to return anyway.) and what's there to say about the doctor's world destroying super weapon? a giant laser gun?...well let's just say it's design suggests that the good doctor was unconsciously trying to compensate for something.
 This is the debuted film by visionary director Jim Wynorski (vision; get big titted women into the movie somehow.) who also wrote the screenplay. Anyway, the girl's costumes (what little of them there are) have to be seen to be believed and it remains (as far as I know) the only movie where a rampaging gorilla is disposed of via a kick in the nuts.
 Put it this way... if Kenny Everett's `Cupid Stunt' were real... this is the sort of movie she would be in. ""So go see it... it's all done in the best possible taste!""

 We are promised a new deluxe two disc blue ray edition soon... with Raven De La Croix in high def.
