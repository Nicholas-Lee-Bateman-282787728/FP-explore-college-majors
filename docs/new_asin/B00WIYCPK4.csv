8713603,4,B00WIYCPK4,Movie is ok. Nothing special. It wasn't what I thought it would be. But not a terrible movie. I bought it cheap so wasn't a total waste of money. LOL,1458518400,,149,4.0
8713604,1,B00WIYCPK4,"I have no idea how this received the ratings it has so far. I am sooooo glad I was watching it free on Prime because if I would have paid for it, I would be so angry. As it is, I only lost an hour and half of my life. Shocking it was this awful since I recognized some of the actors/actresses but do not waste your time. This is awful even by B movie standards.",1454976000,2,361,3.763157894736842
