8365297,4,B002DKKZ78,"I did not get this from amazon, as the only supplier was rarewaves imports, whose shipping of single-DVD movies  to me has resulted in damage (scratches) due to their flimsy paper packaging.  After several bad experiences with them, I looked elsewhere for months, and finally found it at an affordable price, also in PAL.  The movie did not disappoint, especially if you're as huge a Robert Fuller fan as I am.  It's not his best work, but it's better than average.  I recommend it, if you find it for $15 or less.  Good hunting.",1494633600,,529,4.574468085106383

8365299,3,B002DKKZ78,"I really liked the movie, but when I bought it, it did not show it was region 2 - which is not compatible with DVD players in the US. When I tried to return it for a region 1 Ravewaves does not have Region 1 and to return for credit I have to send the Disc back to GREAT BRITAIN! Custom forms and high postage requires me to watch this movie at my office on my computer (apparently it play any region)",1449532800,,401,3.902439024390244
8365300,5,B002DKKZ78,"Good versus Evil in the Old West, plenty of eye candy and guns.  The late, great Dan Duryea is at his slickest and slimiest here, out to re-steal the Army gold he stole and hid--plus get a Pardon from the Government for all his evil deeds.  The lovely and talented Robert Fuller is a dashing Army Captain on a Mission-Impossible sort of assignment--naturally considered to be a suicide mission, but he wants to clear his dead brother's name and that's that because His Heart is Pure.  He's leading the usual ""band of misfits"" (that is, character actors including the late, great Claude Akins) to bring back the stolen gold in spite of greedy outlaws, marauding Indians, and distracting women.  There is a female actress (not Meg Foster, and not great or apparently late, either) shoehorned into the story line for the sole purpose of--well, I don't know--but she's there.  I don't who the actress is, but she must hold the Guinness World's Record for wearing the most mascara while still able to hold her eyelids open.  Mercifully, in this transfer, everybody keeps their clothes on (for those of us looking for family entertainment.  The movie was a lot of fun, full of fights and shoot-em-ups.  I loved it, and wish Hollywood still made 'em like this.",1444089600,,1253,4.768518518518518
8365301,5,B002DKKZ78,Watched this years ago and still enjoy it today. Robert Fuller is one of my top 5 actors.,1442534400,,89,4.0
8365302,2,B002DKKZ78,My DVD player wouldn't play this DVD so I  haven't got to watch it. I would like to be able to exchange this movie for the same movie with Region 1 in English Language. Thanks.,1420761600,,176,4.0285714285714285
8365303,5,B002DKKZ78,I really don't know why it shows Meg Foster because she is not in this movie.  I really enjoyed watching Robert Fuller and Dan Duryea in this formulaic western but westerns are what I grew up watching with my dad.  I have watched it several times and each time I find something I missed the first time.,1407196800,,302,4.280701754385965
8365304,4,B002DKKZ78,"""Incident at Phantom Hill"" from Universal Studios from 1966 is pretty much standard western fare, actually above average as its has a sense of being an outlaw  from obscurity for a number of reasons.  One is that it is one of the few films Jocelyn Lane had starring roles in about that time and this one released by a major studio.  Other pictures she had the lead role in were Elvis's low-budget success ""Tickle Me"" from Allied Artists and AIP's ""Hell's Belles"" and ""A Bullet for Pretty Boy"" opposite Fabian.  She is rumored to have a nude swimming scene in ""Incident at Phantom Hill"" but neither does this release contain that footage.  Pegasus Entertainment Ltd. presented this inexpensive PAL transfer.  As much as the scene is greatly missed, the western does have a number of other good things going for it including Robert Fuller and Dan Duryea as the villain and a full-blooded script by Frank Nugent and Ken Pettus from a story by Harry Tatelman, who also produced.  Directed by Earl Bellamy, the story concerns an incident at Phantom Hill in Northwest Texas during the Civil War, rumored also to have actually be based on fact, but rather enthralling just the same.  It's shameful Jocelyn did not have a bigger career as she one of the most stunningly beautiful actresses in her day.  As the story goes on in a search for water as well as gold, hoping for a watering hole large enough for the swim scene becomes defeated when the credits roll before anyone gets quenched.  Merde!  The characters all work on their sense of lawlessness, which is pertinent to our times now, as Jocelyn is not kissed once, even at the end when she comes to her senses and helps Fuller kill Duryea who could get away with a million dollars in gold and make her dreams of going back to Hays City where she was driven off by her ex-lover the sheriff who threw her over for a rich banker's daughter and having them crawl for what they did to her come true.  Claude Atkins is killed savagely by the Indians he is greedy to scalp to avenge his family.  The film was filmed in Technicolor and Techniscope in Universal City.",1374278400,3,2107,4.571808510638298
8365305,4,B002DKKZ78,Excellent Region 2 transfer of colour and sound but the only flaw with this transfer is that it is cut by four minutes and does not contain Jocelyn Lane's tasteful nude swimming scene (which was intact on NBC's old SATURDAY NIGHT AT THE MOVIES in the 1960's). Otherwise it is a very good dvd with a fastmoving story!!,1291420800,4,317,4.482758620689655
