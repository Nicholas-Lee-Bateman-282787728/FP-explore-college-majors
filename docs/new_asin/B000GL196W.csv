2614768,3,B000GL196W,"This is NOT a DVD for a beginner, so perhaps my rating would be higher if I weren't one. There isn't any instruction given for proper alignment or pose description.  If you aren't familiar with the sanskrit names of poses, you will be lost or constantly looking at the  television and trying to figure out what is going on. For those practitioners that really know their stuff, this DVD will be a nice addition to your collection. This is a DVD that I would like to be able to follow along with someday, but for now, I need to concentrate on learning the individual poses and how to correctly move from one pose to another without injuring myself. While the flow portion of the DVD is beyond a beginner level,I do think the Yin session would be useful for all levels.",1168041600,28,767,4.432624113475177
2614769,5,B000GL196W,"I purchased this DVD from amazon.com and after having practiced it this morning, I could feel just how powerful this style of yoga is not only for myself but for the planet. I love this DVD-the studio setting was beautiful and the music was perfect. There was obviously a lot of work and love put into it, and having a home practice for 6 years now, I so appreciate that in a yoga teaching tape. Donna has such a wonderful spirit about her, and her teaching style made me feel comfortable in my own skin. She made me feel as if I could do anything but yet she also gave me permission to be compassionate towards myself when I couldn't. Her voice was soothing and her words kind and reassuring. She made me free in my practice of yoga, free from all my negative thoughts that continually seek to keep me from my fullest potential. I recommend watching the DVD at least once, if not twice before actually practicing it, and more than any other yoga DVD I have, I was amazed at how good I felt afterwards- not sore or drained. I do hope she will be putting out another yoga DVD- we need more dedicated teachers like Donna .",1157846400,14,1120,4.312796208530806
2614770,5,B000GL196W,"Flow & Yin is truly a refreshing and balanced practice. As an avid practitioner (owning 80+ yoga practices with studio practice 2x week), this DVD is one of my favorites. Filmed in a beautiful studio environment, students of all shapes, sizes and levels practice along with you. The DVD begins with a 50 minute flow sequence (mainly standing postures), challenging enough for advanced practitioners (as Donna provides variations throughout) and encouraging enough for the advanced beginner (you will not want to give up). The Yin practice loosens connective tissue, as the floor poses are held for a longer period of time than traditional classes. The practice is light on Sanskrit terminology -- and easy to follow for those unfamiliar with yoga terminology.

This is truly an AUTHENTIC yoga practice!! You will become aware of your breath. Donna reminds you to make the pose for you -- there is no perfect pose. She continually makes suggestions and seems to know just when and where to offer them. She offers variations that will suit you at any level of your practice and reminds you to practice them when you are ready. I found myself experiencing calmness throughout this challenging practice. She reminds you of your intention, and if you already forgot -- she is the kind of teacher who has already covered it for you in the beginning.

All in all, this is an enjoyable yoga practice. If you are looking for a great yoga workout -- this DVD will take you to a higher level. If you are seeking to find peace, calm, connection and teaching -- you will find it through this DVD. As Donna makes clear in her liner notes & credits, her intentions are for the benefit of all beings. Just by purchasing this DVD you are doing a great part for yourself and other beings!",1157155200,56,1770,4.7435064935064934
2614771,5,B000GL196W,"I love the fact that proceeds go to help animals and humans too! The DVD is very easy to follow, and Donna has a soothing voice, and describes everything beautifully. This can be done either as a beginner w/modifications or a more practiced yoga person, as Donna beautifully describes how to adjust postures. I love having the option of two styles from which to choose. A perfect DVD all around!",1153353600,8,395,4.6571428571428575
2614772,5,B000GL196W,"I am very fortunate to live in the Phoenix area and thus be able to attend Donna's live classes here at the At One Yoga studio.  She is a very nurturing and compassionate instructor and has a great sense of humor as well.  Her combination of flow and Yin yoga provides a fine balance of active and meditative styles suitable for both beginners and accomplished practitioners of yoga.  She is also the founder of The Karma Yoga Project, designed to provide financial aid to various animal non-profit organizations. This DVD will provide a great introduction to Donna and her style of Yin and Yang yoga.",1153267200,5,601,4.704761904761905
2614773,5,B000GL196W,"I couldn't wait to try this DVD after having found out about the Karma Yoga Project and the instructor's involvement in raising money for charities dedicated to helping also the non-human animals.  I believe that compassion for all beings is vital in the practice of yoga.

I wasn't disappointed one bit.  I loved the beginning, feeling as though my muscles were being strengthened, yet with the guidance of Donna to not feel as though the practice must be perfect and to come back to my breath.  I have never had a yin relaxation/stretching session such as the one in this DVD; I felt so renewed and open after it!  I have been having problems with certain yoga poses, maybe because I wasn't holding the poses long enough to gain enough benefit.  I feel that Donna is an encouraging and inspirational yoga teacher with great wisdom.  She's also very articulate and her voice is soothing, as is the music.

Get this DVD!",1153267200,22,920,4.670807453416149
2614774,5,B000GL196W,"I really like this DVD because Donna incorporates Yogic wisdom with a balanced, well sequenced flow and yin practice. I was able to move at my own pace and felt renewed and strengthened after practicing with this DVD. Go for it!",1153267200,3,228,4.585365853658536
2614775,5,B000GL196W,"Excellent yoga sequence.  You can practice yoga away from the studio without feeling like you are missing something.

2614776,5,B000GL196W,"This yoga video feels more comfortable to practice in my home-or for travel, than any others in my collection. It is challenging in a powerful-yet subtle way! It is indeed a ""balanced practice""..and I especially love the fact that you can choose-tailor the practice to fit your needs, which change from day to day. You get the feeling of practicing in a beautiful studio without ever having to leave the comfort of your own space. This video truly offers a perfect balance between movement/breath-body/mind..creating a healthy space in which to dance with the mind, body and breath. It is well put together..with sequencing, dialogue, setting, music...it is a beautiful blend of the practice of yoga. It is no doubt going to be the video I pull out  of my collection most often, as it simply feels really gOOd!!!!!",1152489600,3,814,4.898550724637682

2614778,4,B000GL196W,"This is an excellent dvd! It flows very nicely and it challenges you to a degree. However, I would not recommend this to anyone who doesn't know sanskrit. If you are a beginner or just not familar with the traditional yoga posture language then you might get a little confused. I recommend also checking out Tamara's Yoga Fusion. She has a great voice, she does speak sanskrit, however, she also gives you the english name for the postures as well. Plus, you can pick and choose from chapters of postures that you want to work on if you don't feel like doing the entire dvd.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/TAMARA-S-YOGA-FUSION/dp/B001DDY6RG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">TAMARA'S YOGA FUSION</a>",1220745600,,736,5.7
2614779,5,B000GL196W,"I have used many different DVDs and CDs.  Very few are stand the test of time.  Donna's is excellent.  She's a compassionate teacher, with a very approachable style. The practice is fairly demanding, so if you're a beginner, this is not for you.
Typically, I do the flow or vinyasa portion of the DVD and then my own seated postures.  Her Yin section is very good, but I simply don't make time for yin on the days I do flow.  Her Yin practice has some shoulder opening poses that are hard to find anywhere else. (If you want a stand alone yin practice that's great try Erin Fleming's CD.)
I've been doing this DVD for about a year and have yet to get bored with her or the sequence.  The vinyasa portion is about 45 minutes long and incorporates almost any pose you might want to do.
The way Donna approaches her yoga is what sets this DVD apart from the rest of the pack: she's kind, understanding, and cheerful.",1202342400,6,913,4.341176470588235
2614780,5,B000GL196W,"An EXCELLENT intermediate practice. The first segment of this video is an intense 50 minute flow sequence. The pacing of the sun salutations is moderate-to-fast, energizing, but not difficult to follow, and not before a nice long dangling Uttanasana (forward fold) to begin to warm you up. Following the fairly traditional warmup come some challenging asanas, (Parsva Bakasana (sideways crow), and a long Trikonasana series that includes Parivrtta Trikonasana (revolved triangle) for example) but instructor Donna Helm-Yost offers them as an option for those who can manage them, leaving plenty of modification options for those of us in the stages of approaching the full pose. Donna's instruction is excellent, helping the student to focus appropriately, never forgetting to work the dynamics of breathing into the postures, keeping the meditative mind throughout. The yin section is also excellently taught. It goes on just a little bit longer than I would find optimal, leaving me sleepy insted of energized, but others may not find this so. Donna has a good voice for teaching; soothing and down-to-earth. Her instruction rocks. The musical selection is inspiring without being at all intrusive. The studio setting is lovely, with lots of people of all shapes, sizes and levels of ability to suggest variations of the postures that might work for you. This has become one of my favorite yoga DVDs, and I reach for it almost any time I have 2 hours to devote to my practice.",1198108800,11,1478,5.136929460580913
2614781,5,B000GL196W,"I must concur with all the glowing reviews regarding this DVD.  Donna is a skilled and caring instructor.  I felt very motivated and relaxed in her hands.  The production quality is terrific and very natural: You feel like you're in the room!

For those who like (need) a challenge, like myself, here it is.  For those who want to sit longer with poses, here it is.  It's TWO practices in one!  You can choose one or do both, which provides an optimal and full workout.

I've spent nearly a year researching and building a yoga library.  In the process I've bought some bummers and clunkers.  This one I'm very happy to have bought.  And the fact Donna donates a portion of every sale towards animals is another reason to feel good.  Consider it a perk.",1185926400,10,753,4.496296296296296
2614782,5,B000GL196W,"This is a truly great video for the intermediate practitioner. The ""flow"" sequence is simply fabulous, much better than what some of the better known names have produced. You have a complete invigorating wonderful workout in about 50 min and believe me, you have sent oxygen and peace to the most remote cells of your body when you are through. The ""yin"" practice is also great working into the deeper you at all levels.

I really cannot praise this DVD enough and I also loved the personal touches and Donna should count me among her ardent fans. I only hope she puts out a new DVD soon and now I know what my friends are getting for their birthdays! If you are serious about yoga, you have to have this DVD, it's a promise.",1176940800,3,725,4.41044776119403
2614783,4,B000GL196W,"This is a nice DVD but the full w/out is a bit adv. for me due to alot of ""vinyasa"" in the flow segment.

2614784,4,B000GL196W,"This DVD served as my introduction to Yin yoga -- very slow, very deep (supposed to access and work on connective tissue), relaxing, and quite different from my regular Kundalini routine.  In short: I like the ""yin"" portion of Donna Helm-Yost's set as a kind of occassional practice, to balance and juxtapose against the more active yoga I do most days.  This DVD is worth the second set alone!",1171238400,7,394,4.695652173913044
2614785,5,B000GL196W,"I really love the feel of this yoga dvd. You really feel like you are part of the class. Since my daughter was born it has been hard to keep an outside practice going. This DVD helps me cultivate a home practice with the company and energy of a great room of yoginis! It is easy and challenging all at the same time. She emphasises it is  not about the perfect pose, but a still mind. This gives me space to practice at my own pace with a lot of unchartered territorty to explore. Love it!",1168560000,6,489,4.09375

8133335,3,B000GL196W,"I gave this 3 stars because it's ok. As someone has previously stated, it is not a beginner's dvd. For a flow series, I personally like when directions for poses are clear enough to make having to watch the video obsolete. This is not so here. I also do not know the names of poses, which this instructor uses a lot. The yin portion of the practice is actually the part for which I what I bought this. It, too, is ok. I recently started a yin yoga class which is offered only once a week, and I wanted to incorporate it more often in my routine. There are fewer poses in the hour than what I am used to,  and one in particular that is very hard on my knees, but overall, it stretches the body parts being used.",1489536000,,710,4.071428571428571

8133338,5,B000GL196W,"I have recently become interested in acquiring more DVDs that focus on Yin yoga, a slow style which includes long holds of poses as a means to target the connective tissues, including the ligaments and joints.  There aren't many Yin DVDs available, and although I was aware of this one by instructor Donna Helm-Yost, I wasn't sure if I would be interested in the ""flow"" portion of the practice, as sometimes flow yoga routines can move too quickly for my liking.  However, I am currently enrolled in a Yoga Teacher Training program, and so I am trying to expose myself to a greater variety of yoga techniques.  Given this, I decided to try this DVD.

The Main Menu offers options for Play All - Introduction - Flow Sequence - Yin Sequence.  The flow is approximately 45 minutes and the Yin 65 minutes, so the entire routine offers a lengthy session (110 minutes) that is comparable to going to an actual class.  For both sequences, Helm-Yost is instructing live in front of a group of approximately eight participants of various levels.  Helm-Yost sometimes demonstrates, but she mostly provides instruction (in both English and Sanskrit) as the class members perform the poses.  I have provided breakdowns of the routines below.  Note that throughout the routines, Helm-Yost frequently cues modifications, encouraging each user to focus on his/her own practice.

FLOW SEQUENCE
Helm-Yost has the class begin standing.  She leads the group through basic breathing, a half sun salutation, and setting the intention.  This is followed by several rounds of Sun Salutation A and then Sun Salutation B.  Coming up to balance on the toes, she has the class come down into a toe squat.  Next is a standing sequence which moves from lunge to pyramid to crescent lunge to twisting lunge.  The group then returns to standing for standing hand to big toe forward bend.  Moving back through toe balance and toe squat, the next standing sequence includes chair, twisting chair, and optional side crow pose.  Following this, the lunge series is repeated on the second side, followed by gorilla forward bend (hands under feet).  Helm-Yost then begins a balance series starting with tree pose and moving into eagle and then eagle warrior.  The flow continues with Warrior B, reverse warrior, triangle, half moon, standing split, and revolved triangle, and then the entire balance sequence is repeated on the second side.  Using a vinyasa to transition, the final standing pose flow includes Warrior A (1), Warrior B (2), and side angle pose.  Between sides, Helm-Yost cues wide-legged standing forward bend, with the option of lifting into tripod headstand.  Another vinyasa is the transition to the floor, where Helm-Yost cues dolphin pose, option to perform forearm balance.  After a brief forearm plank, this practice concludes in child's pose.

YIN SEQUENCE
Postures in this segment are held approximately 5-6 minutes (less if holding on each side).  Helm-Yost directs the group right from child's pose in butterfly, which has the feet further forward and the back more curved than cobbler's pose.  While holding the postures, she explains how to use optional props.  Next was dragonfly, or wide-legged forward bend with relaxed toes and rounded back.  This is followed by ""square"" pose, aka double pigeon, and then reclined Figure 4 pose (optional rock the baby).  Coming to lying face-down, several variations are show for saddle pose, including cobra or sphinx.  After a knee release on all fours and a few rounds of cat/cow, Helm-Yost moves into a series of poses focusing on the shoulders.  This was my FAVORITE part of the practice, especially given that there is so little in Yin that focuses on the lower body.  The first posture is similar to an elevated child's pose with one arm stretched overhead.  Next, stretch both shoulders by keeping one arm overhead, the other twisting under the body (thread-the-needle).  Then, come onto the back for a cross-leg reclined twist with one arm stretched overhead.  For the final relaxation series, Helm-Yost shows how to place a bolster under the hips, either lying with the legs straight into the area or bending them to the ears for snail pose (aka deaf man's pose).  A brief final relaxation in tentacle pose (shavasana) concludes this wonderful practice; Helm-Yost recommends holding this posture 5-10 minutes.

I greatly enjoyed both practices on this DVD.  The flow routine was just that--a flowing sequence that moved along nicely without being fast or rushed.  I loved that it included the option for more challenging postures, but I also think that it would be doable for experienced beginners who are familiar with basic standing and balance postures.  (Note: the only Sanskrit that it is really necessary for users to know when doing this practice is virabhadrasana, or warrior pose--Helm-Yost uses this to cue Warrior A & B, aka Warrior 1 & 2.  Otherwise, she uses MOSTLY English names for poses, such as downward dog, cobra, tree, and eagle, although she will very occasionally state the Sanskrit name as well.)  The Yin practice is simply one of the best I've found on DVD so far, with the greatest variety of moves and a wonderfully relaxing sequencing.  Plus, Helm-Yost offers plenty of modifications to make these postures work for everyone.  Definitely a recommended yoga video!",1425254400,2,5333,5.045714285714285
8133339,5,B000GL196W,"I am at an intermediate yoga level. I really enjoy doing my yoga practice wiht Donna Helm-Yost. Her pace is perfect. Some of the yoga videos are to fast pace for me, I feel like I am always trying to catch up. Donna not only takes her time but she lets you stay in some of the positions so that you can feel the pose and make any adjustments that you need to make.

It is like being in my favorite yoga class. I would definitely recomend this video.",1393027200,,449,4.044943820224719
8133340,5,B000GL196W,"I absolutely love this DVD. The instruction is patient and sage-like, and I benefit both physically and emotionally each time I complete either the flow or the yin series, and having the time to do both back-to-back makes for an amazing yoga class. Helm-Yost's words of wisdom resonate with me often, filtering into my days to help make me aware of when I'm disconnected from a state of peace. For instance, she encourages the practicioner to focus on the present moment by gently being aware of whether we are ""anticipating, remembering, judging, worrying,"" and to redirect those thoughts to the breath. Her word choices are brilliant, and she is a truly inspiring instructor. I hope she will create additional practices on DVD. I'll be the first in line to pick up my copies. Donna, if you read these reviews, I hope you realize how much people like me appreciate and benefit from your efforts--thank you from the bottom of my heart for the gift of this practice.",1342224000,,965,4.7844311377245505
8133341,5,B000GL196W,"I take this DVD with me whenever I travel.  It feels great to do 75 min of yin after a long flight.  The yin is mainly what I use because I go to my studio for flow classess, but her flow is great too; not real hard, not super easy.  I see Donna in class at times in Scottsdale and she is great, but I actually like the DVD better, because it covers more poses.  I strongly recommend this DVD for those looking for a great Yin/ Flow practice to do at home or on the road.",1305676800,2,471,3.8247422680412373
