5184294,3,B008V28ZLK,"My review is going off what I remember about this movie from many eons ago. Once I order this, I may edit this.

First off, the description is wrong. Jethro, obviously, isn't Jed's son, but his nephew. I've never quite understood how Jethro's mother, Pearl, could be Jed's cousin and Jethro be his nephew. Jed attempted to explain it to Jethro once and ended by telling him ""anyway, I think you're a grand nephew"" to which Jethro replied, ""thanks, Uncle Jed, you're a swell uncle!""

That aside, this just wasn't a great movie and could have been so much better.

Number one, Max Baer, Jr. wanted nothing to do with the movie. He felt he had been typecast as Jethro and wouldn't touch it with a ten foot pole. Strike one! His replacement here, Ray Young, just doesn't have the spark that Max had.

Number two, no Granny. Instead of recasting Granny as was done with Jethro, they had ""Granny's mother,"" a role which was never mentioned in the series. Obviously Irene Ryan had already passed away and couldn't be in the movie, but there were more tactful ways to handle this.

Number three, no Mr. Drysdale. Raymond Bailey had passed away before the movie was made. His ""replacement"" was Werner Klimperer, aka Colonel Klink, playing a government agent.

Shad Heller reprises his role that he had in the original series in the 8th season. The 8th and 9th season are generally looked upon as the two worst seasons of the show, so bringing back a recurring character from those seasons is mind boggling.

Shug Fisher returns as well, but he doesn't reprise his role as Shorty Kellems instead playing a judge.

Other actors who had bit parts in the original series appear also. Charles Lane played a rival bank employee in the episode where Jed is made a vice-president so he can go skeet shooting with Mr. Drysdale. He also appeared on Petticoat Junction as did Linda Kay Henning, who also makes an appearance on this movie. King Donovan appeared on a handful of episodes of the original series, first as Jake Clampett, a scammer who attempted to con the Clampetts (you have to watch the two episodes!) and in the 7th season as an Army psychiatrist wanting to prove that Jethro was simply putting on an act.

If you're a die hard fan of the series like I am, you'll rush right out to purchase this. If not, it still isn't a bad movie. I'm hoping this means that we'll soon get more season sets of The Beverly Hillbillies from either CBS HE or MPI. Shout! is also rumored to be looking at releasing the rest of the series as well.",1358726400,8,2523,4.551876379690949
5184295,1,B008V28ZLK,"From MPI - ""This is in production for a 2013 wide release""

""The Return of The Beverly Hillbillies is the 1981 reunion TV movie starring original cast members Buddy Ebsen, Donna Douglas and Nancy Kulp as well as Werner Klemperer (Colonel Klink in Hogan's Heroes), Imogene Coca (""Your Show of Shows"") as Granny's Maw and Heather Locklear with Ray Young assuming the role of Jethro. Also appearing are original series guest performers Charles Lane, King Donovan and Linda Kaye Henning. DVD includes new intro by Linda along with original cast commercials from the 1960s.""

Let me guess - MPI marketing was offered the rights to ""Return of"" at a low price.  They have no clue it's horrible, and figure if it sells well, that might justify the cost of offering Season 4 and subsequent seasons.  Because it's horrible, it won't sell well, and MPI marketing will put it down to lack of interest in the series, dropping any plans for season releases.",1357084800,6,943,4.802469135802469
5184296,1,B008V28ZLK,"I bought this film hoping that it would be just as good -- at least close -- to the original Beverly Hillbillies TV series.  Believe me, this film is no where near as good as the original TV series and if I made this movie, I would have been too embarrassed to air it.  In the film, Ms. Hathaway (Nancy Kulp), now working for the American government, is sent to look up her old Clampett pals in order to get the recipe to Granny's white lightning tonic in order to solve the energy shortage problem.  In her travels, she reunites with Jethro (Ray Young) -- who is a movie producer in this one, Elly May (Donna Douglas) -- now the owner of a petting zoo, and Jed (Buddy Ebsen) -- whom after Granny went to her ""great reward"", divided his dough up with Elly May and Jethro, sold his mansion in Beverly Hills and moved back to the old cabin.  We are also introduced to Granny's Maw (Imogene Coca) and the start of many God awful acting attempts by Heather Locklear.  The story is horrible, I wish it had been set in Beverly Hills, and this to be honest is not a true reunion movie.  Three actors are greatly missed in this film:  Irene Ryan (Granny), Raymond Bailey (Mr. Drysdale), and Max Baer Jr. (Jethro from the TV series.)  Unfortunately Irene Ryan and Raymond Bailey passed away before this movie was made and Max Baer Jr. didn't want to reprise his role as Jethro.  I do like the idea of manufacture on demand DVDs, however, as this would allow many movies and TV series that would not have been released otherwise to be released.  With most of the first season episodes of the Beverly Hillbillies having been released in the form of The Beverly Hillbillies the Ultimate Collection Volumes 1 and 2, and Paramount having released the Official Second and Third Seasons, it would be nice to see the rest of the series -- seasons 4-9 -- either as MOD releases or regular releases.  I suggest we remember The Beverly Hillbillies as it should be remembered -- by the hilarious 1960's television series and not from this horrible ""reunion"" movie.",1351814400,20,2043,4.494594594594594

5184303,5,B008V28ZLK,"Unfortunately the storyline of this early 1980s reunion
of The Beverly Hillbillies isn't as strong as it should have
been but the writer's guild strike at the time apparently
prevented series creator Paul Henning from polishing the
script as intended. Nonetheless, it's nice to see
Buddy Ebsen, Donna Douglas and Nancy Kulp gather together
one last time to play their original roles along with
frequent, familiar guest star Charles Lane plus Linda
Kaye Henning making appearances - along with a very young
Heather Locklear plus veteran comic actress Imogene Coca
as Granny's mother!

The movie looks beautifully remastered with brilliant colors
but the best news is that the DVD features a full-length
Beverly Hillbillies documentary with rare footage and interviews
plus a pilot presentation for a proposed spin-off show starring
Donna Douglas in character called ELLY'S CRITTERS. So, all in
all, very worth the price.",1381104000,2,919,5.337931034482758
5184304,4,B008V28ZLK,"It was nice to see some of the people once again playing their original roles.  Of couse Granny was gone, but Imogene Coca did a fantastic job of playing her mother and they should have left Jethro out of the picture even though Ray Young tried to make himself fill Max Bauer's shoes. For those of you that watched Hogan's Heroes and Colonel Klink, you will be amused for the most part of Werner Klimperer's role, which was funny but just a little bit too drawn out. We don't see too much of Elly, just in the beginning and at the end, but she still looked great. The opening scenes didn't make any sense as they were parts of the show and we had no idea of what was going on. Overall, still a very good and amusing show and the scenery was just beautiful, but it really didn't have the old Hillbilly feel of the original series.  Thank you Paul Henning for using the gifts that God gave you to make so many people happy. +JMJ+",1365984000,,927,4.231638418079096
5184305,4,B008V28ZLK,"This movie is not anywhere near as bad as most people make it out to be.  Is it as good as the original series?  Not even close.  But it's decent, and certainly watchable.  The brief set of included extras add something special to make this DVD more than worth the current asking price.",1364515200,9,286,4.339622641509434
5184306,3,B008V28ZLK,"This movie has been generally derided by everyone, but I didn't see it as any worse than some of the original series episodes from the final (1970-71) season, all of which were pretty poor by the series' earlier standards. The three ""original"" cast members, Buddy Ebsen, Nancy Kulp, and Donna Douglas, are actually quite good, playing their parts as if they never stopped in the first place. They're the best part of the program and I give it three stars for them. On the flip side, Ray Young, the replacement for a disinterested Max Baer, doesn't capture any of Baer's best qualities and in fact doesn't seem like Jethro at all. Shad Heller doesn't seem like an authentic hillbilly to me with his flat-country accent.

The main complaint I have with the story is the character of Granny's Maw, played (terribly) by Imogene Coca. First of all, Granny's Maw was never referenced as being alive on the original series. Because of Granny's own advanced age, her mother's very existence at the point this movie was made stretches the idea of ""suspension of disbelief"" well past its breaking point. Why not Granny's sister, or Granny's cousin? Makes a heck of a lot more sense. It doesn't help matters that Coca delivers all her lines in a raspy screech as if she's reading them off the script and spends the rest of her time on screen mugging for the camera. Irene Ryan had her own special way of doing it, but Coca's imitation is pitiful.

Instead of this marginal rehash, serious fans like me would rather have the rest of the series on DVD. Here's hoping the remaining series are on their way.",1363824000,20,1592,4.661921708185053
