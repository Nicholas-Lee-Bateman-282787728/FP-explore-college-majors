8457061,3,B0054TOTR2,"The historical videos of the symphonies of Bruckner are rare, by which is welcome this Seventh Symphony with the Boston Symphony Orchestra and Charles Munch. The symphony was recorded at the Sanders Theatre of Harvard University on February 18, 1958. Despite efforts to restore, the image and sound are not good, due to the age of recording. Yet this is a valuable historical document of a great symphony with an orchestra and conductor in his golden years. Except for some problems of interpretation, the symphony flows well. Munch time is faster, lasting 52 minutes, when most versions hover around 66 to 68 minutes. We expect more historical recordings of the symphonies of Bruckner.",1324080000,,686,5.079646017699115
