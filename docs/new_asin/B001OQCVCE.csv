3732177,5,B001OQCVCE,"I highly recommend this title.  Raising the Bar is a wonderful series that follows the life of recent law school graduates who prosecute and defend the underprivileged of New York.  The drama unfolds both in the courtroom and in the personal lives of the lawyers.  Writer Dave Feige, a veteran NYC Public Defender draws on his own experience to weave a colorful tapestry that is at times heroic and at times heart wrenching.  There are often no winners in the criminal justice system, and the lawyers need to find the delicate balance between truth and practicality as they advocate for their clients.  Mark-Paul Gosselaar delivers excellent performances as a brash, young defender who gives the job everything he has, yet often ends up in frustration at the injustice of an inherently flawed system.",1255478400,2,800,4.984962406015038
3732178,4,B001OQCVCE,"It is a nice series, not as entertaining as others, but good none-the-less.  I hope they mature some of the characters - some of the idealism grows old and some of the ""I made it so can they"" also grows old.  A little of both goes a long ways.",1252713600,,243,3.938775510204082
3732179,4,B001OQCVCE,"""Raising the Bar: The Complete First Season"" is yet another TV legal drama in the mold of ""L.A. Law,"" ""Law & Order"" and ""Murder One.""  Created by Steven Bochco (""Hill Street Blues""), the show focuses on idealistic public defender Jerry Kellerman (Mark Paul Gosselaar), who learns to navigate the justice system and the personal politics of the courthouse as he struggles to get a fair hearing for his clients.  Jerry and associates Rosalind Whitman (Gloria Reuben), Richard Patrick Woolsley (Teddy Sears), and Bobbi Gilardi (Natalia Cigliuti) often find themselves squaring off against Michelle Ernhardt (Melissa Sagemiller), a prosecutor trying to balance her desire for real justice with her need to placate an assistant D.A. (Currie Graham), whose job is to win cases.  None of the characters is painted broadly here, and there are no bad guys among the principals -- just people working in the legal system who believe what they're doing is right.  Conflict, of course, comes from the cases themselves. The big buzz when this series first aired was the long hair on Gosselaar.  For the second season, his hair style is much more conservative.",1247270400,2,1146,5.106951871657754
3732180,5,B001OQCVCE,"A very surprizingly addictive show. The characters grow on you from the start and make you interested in what will happen next to the characters, personally and professionally. Although it can be a bit predictable at times, it has a freshness to its presentation that will get you through wanting more. I worry that the show walks a thin line of being completely unrealistic as far as case subject matter. "" is everyone going to be innocent and wrongly accused?"" Where are the bad guys?I understand a noble,honest public defender..who happens to only get innocent and wrongly accused clients? That is Matlock/Murder She wrote cheesey and not what I expect from todays law dramas. Out of the whole first season, I think Mark only had one really ""bad"" guy. Still a great show, really clean cut; can only get better.",1246579200,11,813,4.814285714285714
3732181,5,B001OQCVCE,"Rasing the Bar is a great and upcoming court/law drama that I have throughly enjoyed. I highly recommend it to others. If your a Gloria Reburn (ER) or Mark-Paul Gossellar (Saved by the Bell, NYBD Blue) fan you will especially enjoy these characters reprise their career. The new season is now on TNT and it's looking good for a second season. I'm enjoying it and I highly suggest it even though it is only 10 episode pilot type season. Go get a copy today!",1245196800,14,456,4.440476190476191
3732182,2,B001OQCVCE,"The concept is okay if a little worn out: A bunch of attractive young lawyers on opposite sides of the fence; public defenders vs. prosecutors. Mark-Paul Gosselaar is oh so passionate about his clients' innocence and badly in need of a haircut. There are little touches to try and spice it up - the Judge's illicit relationship with a clerk who has a secret and you do get to see a few of the lawyers without much clothes on.

So why did I stop after the first DVD? Part of the reason has to do with the fact that there is only one judge 99% of the time, and this show is not set in some small town where that would actually happen. Raising The Bar is supposed to take place in Manhattan where an actual public defender would have cases in front of dozens of judges.

But more importantly, the break from reality is too complete for me. All the defendants are sympathetic. Every single last one. They are either outright innocent or they had such a good reason for doing what they did that you can't help but root for their side. It's an insult to the watcher's intelligence. Part of the allure of law shows for me is the nuance - this show has no shades of grey. To make matters worse, the prosecutors pull ridiculous stunts to cheat their way to putting innocent people in prison, and the police officers are portrayed as snarling monsters who could have easily been cast for the Sopranos. Watching this show became painful.

If you want to watch a show that's a lot like this one - except that it's actually done right, watch Conviction created by Dick Wolf. The lawyers are just as attractive (one is even the same as in Raising The Bar!) but it's a lot more interesting, nuanced and believable.",1244764800,30,1699,4.404458598726115
3732183,4,B001OQCVCE,"Raising the Bar is one of the best court dramas I've seen in a long time. The writing is terrific, the acting is great, and they do a great job balancing out serious topic with light hearted humor. Some of my favourite scenes stem from the lawyers meeting up at their usual bar after hours. The budding romance between Bobbie and Jerry is also really entertaining because it gives the viewer something to hope for, giving them a reason to tune in next week. The show can get repetitive at times as Trudy's consistant brash unprofessionalism and unapolagetic hatred of Jerry becomes very annoying at times. That said, Raising the Bar is a fine show and an entertaining way to spend an hour.",1238457600,12,689,4.609756097560975
3732214,5,B001OQCVCE,"""Raising the Bar"" continues to raise the bar with its quality of characters and story lines with each episode. There are thoughtful issues, interesting dilemmas to discover, clients and victims with whom the viewer can identify as the talented attorneys on both sides work passionately at their jobs. I enjoy a legal drama as interesting, entertaining, thought-provoking entertainment and this series meets the mark. It doesn't leap high over the mark, but it is enjoyable, good television, in my opinion. I would recommend it to those who like shows about the practice of criminal law and are finding it tough to find many good series available in this genre. And then, there is Season Two to look forward to! I enjoyed this and wished for more.",1441584000,2,746,4.928571428571429

3732216,4,B001OQCVCE,Engaging stories about criminal defendants and the lawyers defending them. The series presents attorneys on both sides of the case with the defense receiving more sympathetic view. The actors begin somewhat woodenly but grow into their roles.

3732251,4,B001OQCVCE,"You get the idea that justice is the relationships between the judges, the prosecutors and the public defenders.  Facts and the evidence doesn't matter.  It makes you think and wonder.  That is what makes it entertaining.",1388793600,2,221,5.083333333333333
3732252,1,B001OQCVCE,"With an assortment of sanctimonious twenty and thirty-something lawyers, set in NYC (occasional stock footage of the city, but not even a pretense of CGI city-scapes out the windows), a succession of nauseating saccharine speeches about how important the system is and how the system is failing vics and perps alike, this second rate flashback is best avoided.",1383955200,3,360,5.224137931034483
3732253,5,B001OQCVCE,"I had some misgivings about buying this dvd becuase someone said it was not interesting, but I went ahead because I like Mark Paul Grosselar and I like legal dramas. However I was not disappointed as it was indeed a great legal drama with an interesting script that was well written and well  executed. It was  great watching Mark play a self righteous lawyer as opposed to his usual prankster characters like  Zack Morris in saved by the bell.
I loved the character developments, and the characters. The only thing I did not like was that the lighting was poor,but on the whole a good one to watch.",1367971200,,599,4.527777777777778

3732268,5,B001OQCVCE,this show actually depicts the justice system for what it is.  It includes all it's many flaws which makes for such interesting viewing.  It also includes a tangled web of interpersonal relationships that go beyond just the workplace but to the bedroom.  My b/f and I were so sad to see this show go :(,1291507200,2,302,4.454545454545454
3732269,3,B001OQCVCE,"Possibly needs another season in order to develop into something?  Watchable but somehow just doesnt grab. Perhaps the use of the same judge in almost all of the cases, or the stupidity of the said judge has something to do with it.  Not sure if I will be bothered to buy the next season.",1281312000,,288,4.314814814814815
3732270,5,B001OQCVCE,I bought the first season of Raising The Bar. The show is really good and entertaing also. The storylines are really creative also love the bond between Jerry and Bobbi.
