8630840,5,B00H8GC7MS,"This DVD contains 3 different edits of Wladyslaw Starewicz 1933 stop motion jewel ""Fetiche Mascotte aka the Mascot"". Originally the film originally ran close to 40 minutes, but the film's distributors wanted something closer to half that run time, so it was dramatically cut to around 20 minutes. In the 1950s Starewicz decided to repackage some of the unused footage as a new short, ""Gueule de bois"" (aka ""The Devil in the Bottle or ""The Hangover""), which ran roughly 12 minutes. In the 1990s Starewicz's heirs began searching out different release versions of the film and using negative material that they'd archived from his estate reconstructed a new version entitled ""Fetiche 33-12"" (after the original release year and the release year of this reconstruction) which brings the run time to just under 40 minutes. This DVD contains all three of these versions. If you've enjoyed any of the earlier cut versions, then you must see this. The quality of the material here far surpasses anything released previously and the new scenes are pretty amazing (in particular a set of stage-burlesques the puppets perform for each other) A short film showing the birth of a puppet animated film is included as a bonus. This DVD is Regon free PAL format. All films are in French without benefit of subtitles (though the action is pretty self-explanatory)",1412640000,4,1347,5.017857142857143
