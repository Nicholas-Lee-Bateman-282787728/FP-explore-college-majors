6030261,4,B00FRQ0HOQ,Sad to see this and Copper both go. BBC has been making a lot of terrible decisions lately. If they didn't have Dr. Who they would be out of business.

6030262,5,B00FRQ0HOQ,"The narrative is set in the late 19th century and the story begins with the tail-end of Jack the Ripper's terrifying reign of murder in the East End of London, however, the drama went on to examine multifaceted human motivations, to dissect the central characters and their lives beyond the police station. There is examination of what it means to be malevolent and/or human. The drama looked at the lives, and social ills of the people who lived in the area, and this was done through making the look and feel of the era in a really striking framework. For me the direction, writing and performance given, came together to make really interesting and finely tuned drama. It is really sad that the powers to be at the BBC could not/would not fight try to keep this very good show going, I am sure it would have sold well in North America and Australia. It seems to extremely poor judgement to cancel the show. I guess in its place will be another repeat set of programming, which seems to be the unfortunate main stay of the BBC today - all rather sad really.

6030263,5,B00FRQ0HOQ,"********Update 26-Feb-2014....Ripper Street has been Saved. Season 3 will be aired on Amazon Prime*******

For those in the states who may not yet know, Ripper Street has been cancelled. Although not given to conspiracy theories, the big picture presenting itself behind the cancellation has an appearance of being contrived or political or possibly both. No one knows for sure. However, there are petitions being circulated to reverse the cancellation. One in particular is aimed at BBC America. I will send those links first and urge people to sign and share, or write BBC America or BBC One or both and let them hear how much you love Ripper Street. After posting the links, I will present Everything I witnessed leading up to the cancellation. Here are the petitions:

To BBC America
[...]
To BBC One
[...]

[...]

Now, many American fans who visited the Ripper Street page (or at bare minimum where able to find it) know the page has not been updated much and no info on an air date easily found. An initial release date of 01-Dec-2013 was announced to the Critics Association back in July 2013 [...]). While the date was published on the BBCA press page, it was not posted to the Ripper Street page. On top of it, it was slated to air on Sunday nights at 10pm against the Good Wife and The Mentalist. The premiere in the UK was slated for 01-Oct only to be moved to 28-Oct. when it did air in the UK, it was a Monday night at 9pm up against I'm a Celebrity, Get me out of here. Many Americans got off the Twitter and Facebook feeds because they didn't want spoilers. I watched the Twitter feeds because I did not care about spoilers. I saw posts by Ripper Street cast and crew who had absolute pride in their work. I also saw complaints from people who would miss the program because of work and would either watch it later by recording or BBC iPlayer. But during this whole time, nothing was updated on the BBC America website...no promos, no hints, and no mention of air date other than the press page. The weekend before the slated US premiere, still no promos, no teasers, no mention of whether Ripper Street would air or not ( this was the weekend of the big Dr Who simulcast...no mention of Ripper Street, but a teaser trailer and exact premiere date for Orphan Black....which won't even air until 19-Apr-2014 ). If you were lucky, you might have caught one obscure tweet by BBCA on 24-Nov saying Ripper Street would not air until Feb 2014. A tweeter named Kathy summed up my feelings entirely [...]

Several days later, without a word on the BBCA website, on 04-Dec-2013 Ripper Street was cancelled due to low ratings and before it ever even aired in the states. How that can happen when a Ripper Street was a joint BBC/BBCA production amazes me.

If you can't see something odd here, check your eye prescription. Please protest the cancellation and air date shell game of Ripper Street. Don't worry about how much time passes from the date this message was posted. Keep signing and sharing the petitions.

UPDATE 26-Dec-2013: BBCA has listed a premiere date of 22-Feb-2014! But their website lists a broadcast time of 10pm and their tv ad says it airs 9pm! Make sure if you are in the states that you get the correct air time!",1387152000,71,3240,4.575862068965518
6030264,5,B00FRQ0HOQ,"I really like this series.  It has a lot in common with COPPER in that it is gritty, has a lot of violence and great supporting cast.  It is set in London in the 1880's rather than 1860's New York, but both have a central detective with a rather unorthodox coroner and beginning of forensic methods.  I think the acting in this series and the scripts are superior, and I am looking forward to more episodes.",1385942400,2,407,4.328947368421052
6030265,5,B00FRQ0HOQ,"There is a lot to admire about these dramas if you can accept the dramatic aesthetic identical to that of the graphic novel or 'co-mix' which is now almost standard for 'action' films or thrillers these days, whether made for the cinema or for TV. This is certainly how most of this series comes across visually and in terms of narrative presentation. I have to admit I usually have a problem with this fast moving style, which is frequently dependent on sensational video editing, gruesome violence, and narrative short cuts or sleight of hand, BUT taking the series as a whole, it is perhaps the best justification for the co-mix style I have yet come across when taken to this kind of extreme where each story has to fit neatly inside an hour.

As in the first series there are plenty of interesting ideas taken from London history of the period. One of the episodes was about eugenics and featured the 'Elephant Man'; another about the London match factory women and the exploitation of cheap female labour; and another about the early electrification of London and the battle between AC and DC along with, in the same episode, a temporary truce with Irish Fenians when Parnell was the great hope for Irish independence. The finale of the series was an exciting sort of Shakespearian car crash with three of four story lines converging and mostly achieving some sort of closure - which is just as well if there wasn't going to be a third series.

My own special interest is in the attempt to achieve a dramatically useful and fairly convincing form of period dialogue which distinguishes itself from the usual embarrassingly flat late 20th century dialogue which is all that we normally get from historical dramas (e.g. the Ken Folett historical 'epics' such as The Pillars Of the Earth and its sequel World Without End, or the over-praised Game of Thrones). For this reason in recent years I have been very interested in, and much impressed by, the period dialogue of 'Deadwood' and 'Garrow's Law'.
As far as I know there has been very little said anywhere about the sort of dialogue one sometimes finds in 'graphic novels', co-mixes or, if you insist, comics. I have noticed that this dialogue is as singular as everything else about this genre and that one could often describe it as stilted and even pretentious by ordinary standards. But every genre deserves to be judged to a certain extent in its own terms and in this graphic medium the language does not jar in the same way it might arguably do elsewhere. I have very little interest in this medium myself but that is due more to either (1)the content or subject matter, or (2)the style of so much of the draftsmanship, than to the medium itself. I see no reason why the graphic novel couldn't have become a real art form - although in my view it hasn't - but it's obviously what we call a 'popular art form'.

In respect of language the 5th episode ('Threads Of Silk and Gold') was again, as in the first series, more interesting than any of the previous ones which may have  had different writers.  I can well see that it was the kind of writing likely to make the average critic respond with the predictable cliche about lines that no actor could speak convincingly and to point to the actors looking uncomfortable to prove his point. But what may escape most viewers is that when the language is working well it amounts to a kind of verse drama.  Admittedly there is something of an experiment about it all but I'd say it's well worth doing, and of course people might well look like this when  choosing their words carefully and trying deliberately to distance themselves in a class-conscious Victorian way from the brutal events and squalid milieu of such story lines.
It's not just a matter of period dialogue for its own sake, nor is it a matter of its historical accuracy. It's more a matter of the dramatic effectiveness of a heightened and more dramatic dialogue which earlier, and yes often more educated, forms of speech make possible. Above all it's intelligent and goes a long way towards convincing you that the 'graphic novel style' that we have here is also intelligent in some way - as for example the recent BBC serial 'Hunted', or 'Dr Who' (both also in the 'graphic novel style) DO NOT. That is one reason why this kind of dialogue offers such opportunities to the writer. It allows the writer to make the characters more articulate and therefore more conscious of the issues which are driving the drama.

But this episode which was the story of a homosexual prostitution ring based on the new telegram service of the Post Office, financial fraud at a major Bank and its justification in order to prevent a larger collapse of the system, both weighed in the balance against any kind of human love you fancy, had much more than period dialogue to offer.
Although this episode was a powerful self-contained story it undoubtedly gained from our having seen the earlier episodes suggesting a relationship might develop between Reed and Jane Cobden the social reformer, and which turned out to be another example of the interesting organic symmetries in this episode.

For a very thought provoking discussion of the subject of literacy, language change and education over the last 150 years see 'Doing Our Own Thing: The Degradation of Language and Music, and Why We Should, Like, Care' (2003) by John McWhorter. He argues and provides evidence for the level of education (or practical aspiration) in the 19thc, and later, as enabling even the 'lower classes' to express themselves in an impressively articulate and even 'literary' way, especially in personal letters; and equally capable of understanding what they heard or read, on an intellectual level more like the Guardian Review than the Sun.",1385337600,45,5779,4.765234765234765
6030266,5,B00FRQ0HOQ,"I love this series, I have ONLY seen season ONE! But if the writing and plot lines stay  somewhat the same any fan of Victorian London will be ever so happy. The three detectives are well acted and quite smart. This is NOT handing the answer's to you on a plate. One must follow the story line and in the first  eight episodes, they took the Whitechapel area out of the Rippers hands and delved into all the other odd things that were happening at that time.  Not to let a spoiler go but an on-going mystery heads through all the detective work. Its almost finished in episode eight. I presume it will pop up next season ?

6030291,5,B00FRQ0HOQ,"Though occasionally gruesome and bloody, this is a very entertaining drama.

The characters are developing through each episode, and their interaction with new ones being introduced hints at more drama to come.

The ways if which Dr. Jackson uses his forensic knowledge to help solve crimes is primitive to say the least, but, since Forfensics was in its very early infancy during the Victorian period, that should be expected. Nevertheless, what he does and how successful it is makes for interesting entertainment.

Though this appeared initially as merely  a RIpper rehash but it's far more than that, because it also reveals a gret deal about Victorian life and times...how policement of the era were treated and the restrictions,both political and social, they worked under.

Inspector Reid is still fighting the determination of his superior to blame Jack the Ripper for every slasher murder happening while struggled with the guilt over his daughter's death and his wife's subsequent withdrawl from him. With no Grief Counseling available, he losses himself in police work, she in charitable ventures. There's more intrigue and delving into the background of Dr. Jackson, with more evidence being revealed that perhaps he isn't a Pinkerton man after all.

6030374,5,B00FRQ0HOQ,"Simply to say -- BRAVO AMAZON! for bringing back the most surprising, consistently wonderful series I've seen in a long time.

Everyone who works on this brilliant television series deserves highest praise. Because it's what I care about most, I'll point out the WRITING/storytelling: rooted in history of the period but without being caricatured or silly, with a unique and poetic (whether or not it's genuinely realistic) fidelity to speech patterns of the era, and a deeply gratifying and scary story-structure (Inspector Shine is an almost otherworldly villain) ...

... And to the ACTING. The performers are uniformly wonderful. But Matthew Macfadyen is, as he always was, an electrifying screen presence. He conveys so much by his quietness and intensity: morality, fear, duty, dread, the constraints of his position, and the desperate sadness of trying to do and be good in a landscape warped by poverty and the heavy social boundaries of the time.

Stories mean a tremendous amount to people; wonderful, generous storytelling is a gift. May Ripper Street thrive in its new incarnation (and hopefully be faithful/consistent with what they've created to far.) Here's to Season Three!",1415664000,2,1189,5.28042328042328

6030396,4,B00FRQ0HOQ,"Oh Ripper Street why do I love you so?  The plots are mostly grisly rehashes of the sort of grim forensic procedurals, like CSI, that we've all become desensitized to in the last decade or so. Like the best of those dramas, say the ground-breaking Prime Suspect, Ripper Street is blessed with excellent acting from the leads and supporting players. The chemistry between the three main leads is what makes the show interesting and worth watching and I confess I get more hooked in by the Man Pain in Tweed soap opera angle than the crime-solving. The historical setting lends a bit of freshness, I think, though there are times when the writers strain credulity by trotting in famous people from the Edwardian era on a biweekly basis.  When the history works best it's dealing with the sweeping changes, and the alternative angle (history from POV of the poor and ordinary) at the end of the 19th Century.  Dublin makes a convincingly gritty Whitechapel and Matthew MacFadyen has enough tortured, hang dog looks to fill another five seasons at least.",1411430400,,1050,4.822222222222222

6030409,4,B00FRQ0HOQ,"In general, I like the show. But come on, how much pounding can Sgt Drake's skull take? Since series one, Drake seems to get a severe cranium cracking in every episode. He should be dead or in a nursing home. I hope Jerome Flynn doesn't get whiplash from throwing his head back and to the sides so often. I guess it's Drake's brain damage that makes him susceptible to falling in love with prostitutes in pre-penicillin times. I find Long Susan and her story a bore, but there's no other way to get sex, violence and some bouncy breasts thrown into the mix in Victorian London without a whorehouse. Homer Jackson is there because he's American, so he gets to have a gun and pull it on people all the time. The cops didn't have guns in 1880s London, but cowboys did. Sure, Jackson is an educated doctor and a Civil War surgeon and then, not so clearly explained, a Pinkerton detective. But he's a cowboy at heart, pulling and cocking his Wild West gun whenever possible. I was glad to see Gayle from Breaking Bad survive this series and get a treasure trove that would make Jesse Pinkman  jealous.  Glad too to see Reid exposed for a hypocrite in the final episode. He's so philosophical about how man is better than beasts, and spouts his lofty ideals, but he gives in to forbidden sexual urges -- just like animals do -- and has poor brain-addled Drake do his dirty work by beating confessions out of suspects. Tut tut, old man. It seems his wife is locked up in a sanitarium somewhere even though she had been far more sane and practical about the death of their daughter than her husband. The journo with the rubber ear needs to pick a side and stick with it. And Jon Snow was right -- his uncle Benjen isn't dead at all. He's in London having a ripping time.

This is music to my ears as I love period peace dramas like, ROME, DEADWOOD, SPARTACUS ect.  Here is the link to Wikipedia's article on the subject. [...]

It really is a pity that the evolution of the human brain had lead most humans to have an attention span of only three seconds and a vocabulary of about 10 words, otherwise more people would be able to understand the dialog in these type of drams and be able to enjoy them.

6030453,5,B00FRQ0HOQ,Ripper Street is full of marvelous damaged characters. No one has clean hands. Some are positively filthy. The series is great fun and as dark and dank as they come. Highly recommended for lovers of Victorian crime and punishment.,1403481600,,230,4.923076923076923
6030454,5,B00FRQ0HOQ,The first season was well enough that I came back for season 2. I'm glad I did. The relationships are developing and the team has credibility.

6030457,4,B00FRQ0HOQ,"This British police series, set in Whitechapel in 1889 (i.e., a year AFTER the infamous Ripper killings) is a fascinating show. It delivers thrills and excitement and thoughtful drama while dealing with contemporary social and political issues of the time (which, alas, are still with us today in almost the same form), such as slums, police corruption, yellow journalism, the Irish Question, end-of-the-world cults, exploiters of women, and more.

The main characters are Detective Inspector Edmund Reid (Matthew Macfadyen), a principled man in a largely unprincipled world, although he's not above using strong-arm tactics on prisoners, courtesy of his right-hand man, Detective Sgt. Bennet Drake (Jerome Flynn), who carried a torch for one prostitute in season one but married another for season 2. They're aided in their investigations by expatriate American Captain Homer Jackson (Adam Rothenberg), a forensics expert before the term was invented, who's the husband of the beautiful madam Long Susan (MyAnna Buring).

Besides the crimes that they endeavor to solve, each man finds himself with moral and romantic dilemmas and entanglements--and, if there's any criticism to be levied at season 2 of the series, it's that (unlike the end of season 1) several plot threads remain unresolved (so you'll have to tune in to or purchase season 3 to see how they all come out).",1403136000,,1375,5.302752293577981
6030458,5,B00FRQ0HOQ,"A very very good show to watch! It takes place in England on the bad side of town where the Ripper murders took place. It wasn't about the Ripper murders but the crime that followed. It has a small sense of humor, just the right amount to make this a good show, hopeing for more to follow",1403049600,,288,4.0701754385964914

I read where they are making new episodes,  I sure hope so.  They got the perfect person for the police chief,  I love his voice he has the sexy voice and just so polite and dignified well anyway I sure hope they will keep it on ( Did his wife and him split ) I know he kind of like that other women but I think thats because things haven't been going to well since the death of their daughter,",1402963200,,642,4.088

6030463,5,B00FRQ0HOQ,"I love the cast and the stories.  I am not real happy with the gaps.  Why did Bennet marry Bella?  Why can't Reid yield a little to his wife emotionally and why did she fall off the face of the earth?

6030464,5,B00FRQ0HOQ,"Only the British and the BBC can do Mystery stories that ring true and keep you glued to your seat.  This series has a fascinating look at the years just after Jack the Ripper's grim work, and the fear of his return to Whitechapel is very real.  The casting, locations and appearance of the area, as well as the stories are very believable.  The series is a lesson in the tough life of the period.  Each episode is a work of art. The series should be continued for several more years.",1402358400,,484,4.285714285714286
6030465,5,B00FRQ0HOQ,Season 1...WOW... great acting..it transports you to that era... those streets... the people of that time. The title misleading if you expect it to be about Jack.....So different and darn good. Season 2 more of the same... terrific really... but did I say HEAVY.  Don't know what else to say. Its a bit of a whippen at the end of each episode. Heavy. I will order season 3 if there is one.,1402185600,,389,4.402777777777778
6030466,5,B00FRQ0HOQ,"If you like stories in the 1880s about police using intuition,and how they used to have to prove the science behind solving crimes because they did not have the tools they have now, then you will love this show.  It is a man ahead of his time with a story and secrets of his own.  He is an honorable man which was hard to find during that era.  Many of the police there in White Chapel on the East End of London have great background stories, and it keeps you interested in the show.  The show starts off immediately after the Ripper murders, and is pretty accurate with how the police blamed every murderer caught afterwards for the Ripper murders and tried to tie them in.  Great show.",1402099200,,687,4.3359375

6030469,2,B00FRQ0HOQ,"Realizing by the name of this series that the story line Jack the Ripper killing prostitutes, I didn't like the level of nudity and gruesomeness that is depicted in this series.  Murdoch Mysteries covers some of the same type of stories but does so in a much cleaner, more intelligent way without the gruesomeness and nudity.  The intrigue of human behavior that leads someone to murder is the most interesting part of murder mysteries.  I don't need or want to watch a series that dwells on the act itself instead of the intrigue that lead to it, and the investigation that followed it.",1401667200,,587,4.679611650485437

6030471,5,B00FRQ0HOQ,It is a series that I have to leave the room at times because the tension builds to the point I can't stand to watch.  All of the actors in this series are top notch and some are even lovable such as the ex pat Yank doctor who has been browbeat in to taking over the post mortems.  All of the main characters at one point or another almost bite the dust and you are compelled to keep on watching to see if they survive.,1401408000,,419,3.9176470588235293

This is a really great show set in a time period that is very interesting. The world is changing and the second season does a really great job of addressing some modern day issues in this setting. From issues about eugenics and disabilities to women's rights and homosexuality, I like the way the show and it's characters deal with the challenges they face.

I'd recommend both seasons, but this one is definitely stronger than the first.",1400803200,,487,4.7176470588235295

A convincing depiction of Whitechapel, England in 1888.
Great episodes with well written stories and high production values.
The price of survival.
The characters are complicated and reveal the good, gray and evil sides that are part of human nature.
Apparently Amazon is backing Season 3.

6030489,5,B00FRQ0HOQ,"I love this show -- the characters are multidimensional, complex human beings with strengths and weaknesses like all of us.  The script is outstanding -- dialogue is true to the times. Drake, Reid, and the others speak Victorian -- they aren't 20th century gents dressed in Victorian costumes.  They live and breathe their parts.  I love the cinematography which immerses me in the London of the late 1800's, the costuming, and the atmosphere. I even love the theme music.  There is nothing to find fault with in this show -- can't wait for season 3!",1400284800,,550,4.757894736842105
6030490,3,B00FRQ0HOQ,"This was recently cancelled then picked up,for a 3rd season by an American network. AMC? Not sure. I would rate it higher accept that without the captions you cannot understand a word they say.

6030491,4,B00FRQ0HOQ,"I would easily believe that, between Season 1 (which I loved) and Season 2 (about which I'm less sure), new writers and ""designers"" were brought in, because the series seemed to falter, particularly in its neglect of the characters' primary relationships.  Not bad, but I'm not surprised it was not renewed for season 3.",1400112000,,320,4.925925925925926

6030493,5,B00FRQ0HOQ,"The individual police cases to be solved are interesting in themselves, but the environs (some years after Jack the Ripper) in Whitechapel give the viewer a sense of the ""movement of the masses"" through the history of London in the Whitechapel area. Many of the plots incorporate historically sound challenges and problems of the era -- the slums, the rampant corruption, the brutality, the filth, and the ""good vs. evil"" philosophical questions and problems that arise as the series  progresses. The cliffhanger leaves one at exactly that point:  Will Police Inspector Reid (Macfayden) who has until now tried to stand for good and for progress against all odds -- has he finally been pushed over to the darker side by circumstances surrounding his Sergeant and his own life mysteries/misery?  I have heard there will be another season.  I hope so.  Macfadyen is usually direct and deeply intense, yet when dealing with the wounds of the world and of his own heart (seeing his daughter disappear in front of him in a shipwreck) the fleeting expressions of compassion and/or sorrow can tear one's own heart apart.  (Watch him in Pride and Prejudice for same, also Spooks (MI-5).) The rest of Ripper Street cast is excellent, as well, Long Susan and the rogue surgeon from America whose ethics may be somewhat questionable but whose skills in the morgue and in the lab quite make up the difference in terms of solving murder and mayhem.  Many, many side plots, all great -- excellent acting all around, setting totally believable, interesting.  In all:  Great show, eagerly waiting for more episodes.",1400025600,,1599,4.981203007518797
6030494,1,B00FRQ0HOQ,"The first season was incredibly interesting and the stories were excellent. The second season is almost as poorly written as the fabled Sherlock Holmes which stars the minimally talented Benedict Cumberbatch. I am aware that Cumberbatch is an idol to many British television viewers but I really do not care.
The second season stories seem to have the writers struggling to find a reason and an opportunity for Det. Sgt. Drake to beat into submission as many defenseless suspects/witnesses/defendants as they can in each episode. I know this is merely entertainment, or what passes for entertainment, but maybe just once they could have some criminal beat Drake within an inch of his life.
The brooding of Det. Insp. Reid is getting old, very old.
Now the positive part of my narrative. I find the lovely MyAnna Buring well worth the price of admission. She is an incredibly talented actress and her beauty would make a blind man wish he could see.
I am sure my failure to purchase a season 3 will not worry the producers of this show. Give me _A Touch of Frost_ any day.",1399766400,,1071,4.732620320855615

6030506,5,B00FRQ0HOQ,"...for picking up the third season.

The character-driven period noir of ""Ripper Street,"" with intriguing plots, excellent dialog, and edge-of-your seat action and adventure is by far one of television's greatest accomplishments. Start from the beginning, because the set-up matters--these are guys who failed to catch Jack the Ripper, and police the part of England (Whitechapel) where those crimes took place. The gritty setting and anti-hero status of the principle characters is absorbing, the Holmesian forensivs is sharp, and the turn-of-a-new century dynamics are relateable in our era. Immigration, discrimination, pollution, terrorism, corruption--it's all there. This is a narrative to savor, and I cannot WAIT for the further adventures of this profoundly troubled gang, who beleives that the world is bleak and godforsaken, and therefore must be fought for al the more.",1398211200,,881,5.674242424242424

6030513,5,B00FRQ0HOQ,"one of the best shows out there. The acting, pacing, cinematography, the costuming are all just freaking fantastic! And I love a show where I am unable to 'read the script' - it definitely keeps me on my toes and the edge of my seat.;)",1397952000,,235,4.2444444444444445

When I heard that the series was not going to come back-- I thought here they go again not giving a series a chance to develop.  Well I was glad to hear that Amazon was going to bring season 3---thus I continued to watch all the episodes.

This show offers a costume drama, a bit of mystery and history, a bit of romance and sex, and some interesting characters.- not really a show for younger kids ( but I guess they see much worse on regular TV-- let alone cable) ,  I have really enjoyed this series so far and I thank Amazon for continuing it.",1397779200,2,649,4.126984126984127
6030515,5,B00FRQ0HOQ,"Ha! I like this show, I found out it was cancelled & revived all in one day *haha* So I look forward to watching season 3. I Just recently found this show on Netflix. Of course Netflix is never up to date with ANY series, it's missing season 2 of Ripper Street. So I came here looking for it, and *YAY!* I found Season 2. I cannot STAND that Sherlock show with that Cumbersnatch?Cumberbitch?Cucumber guy, but this show is alright. Hell if it can keep me interested it must be good.

This show has low ratings on Netflix (2.5 out of 5) for some reason. I almost didn't waste my time but I gave it a shot anyways. I tend to avoid British shows, because some I just don't ""get"". It's due to a lot of the terms they use and sometimes the accents are so thick I cant understand WTH was just said. I didn't have that issue with this show, although I did find my self rewinding a few scenes (one guy spoke so fast and had a THICK ghetto ass British accent *lol*) This is definitely a show for those of a certain intellect. Because there are no extreme/unnecessary nudity, graphic sex scenes, or graphic violent bloody murder scenes. There's also a lot of dialogue between the characters when they're using science & deductive reasoning while working a case. Maybe that's why the reviews are so low over there because certain people figured since it's a show about ""Jack The Ripper"" they were expecting blood & gore. Anywho....This series isn't just about catching an infamous serial killer. It shows the detectives solving other crimes while the Ripper case went cold here & there. Also gives us a glimpse into their personal lives & issues they're dealing with. Reminds me of whats going on in the Hannibal series, another favorite of mine. I won't give spoilers but there's one distinctive ""Hannibal Lecter"" influenced scene. Yanno' the ""Quid pro quo... Clarice..."" dialogue. Let's see if you can guess which episode/scene I'm referring to *haha*

I also love the scenery, props, decor, antique furniture, and homes. They did a really good job at recreating those beautiful antique homes. I have a Victorian home myself (built in 1898), nice to see how the inside may have looked when it was young.",1397779200,4,2193,4.62051282051282
6030516,5,B00FRQ0HOQ,We have really enjoyed the show and really appreciate the lengths that the producers of the show went to to find authentic scenery (in Ireland) that really looks like the Victorian era east end of London.  The plots are interesting and engaging.  Hope there will be more seasons after the current one.,1397779200,2,301,4.769230769230769

6030521,1,B00FRQ0HOQ,"I am a huge fan of season one. It is intelligent. The characters are mysterious and complex. The plot twists and turns are impossible to predict. The show explores the grey areas of right and wrong.

Season two is simply a dull soap opera. The story telling cliches used in typical Hollywood network television abound in this BBC produced show panders to the lowest common denominators of crappy predictable television. The audience is no longer presented with a puzzle to solve. The audience is deprived of the intellectual adventures which come from intricate writing and a mystery to decipher bit by bit. There is exposition explaining the setting and conflict instead of revelation through plot and dialogue.

The only good thing I can say is that the main cast remain brilliant actors despite the sharp decline of great story telling.",1397606400,2,839,4.985714285714286
6030522,5,B00FRQ0HOQ,"Ripper Street Season 2 was even better than Season 1! The first season felt more like a cop procedural show (more along the vein of Law & Order SVU), while season 2 seemed to really dive into the personal lives of Reed and his team. Don't get me wrong, Season 1 dealt plenty with H Division's home life, and was really great, but Season 2 just really seemed to up the ante on the drama and take off. The episodes of Season 2 also had an overarching storyline throughout the season, and introduced another Detective Inspector Jedidiah Shine (Actor Joseph Mawle from Game of Thrones, great performance btw). Inspector Shine played a key role in the unfolding of Season 2, and really changes the shape of how Reed and Team deal with crime.

Really glad that Amazon decided to save this show for at least a Season 3, because it truly is one worth saving.

I'd also like to note that The Blu-ray set for this season does not contain a Ultraviolet copy. When I pre-ordered the show a few months ago, the product page stated that it would contain a digital copy, but alas, tis not so. The page has already been updated to show that it does not contain a UV copy.",1397520000,,1155,4.392523364485982
6030523,5,B00FRQ0HOQ,"The second season of RIPPER STREET is even better than the first.

Set in Londons seedy Whitechapel District about two years after the infamous Jack the Ripper murders took place, the excellent production, shot in Ireland, transports viewers back this other time and place in such a realistic way that one almost feels that he should take a shower after watching an episode in order to wash off the filth and stench from that Victorian slum.

The unsolved Ripper murders are in the past, but the local police still have their hands full with a variety of remarkable cases, which often involve real life personalities and events.  For example, a character in the first two episodes is Joseph Merrick, The Elephant Man (Joseph Drake).

This season, Inspector Reid (Matthew Macfadyn) has a major problem.  He knows that a fellow detective (Joseph Mawle) from another division is a crooked cop and, indeed, a vicious murderer.  Unfortunately, Reid does not have the proof to bring this man to justice and, to make matters worse; the corrupt officer has planted a spy in Reids precinct.

Still assisting Reid is his sergeant, Bennett Drake (Jerome Flynn), now happily married to a former prostitute, and Captain Homer Jackson, the American doctor (Adam Eothenberg who serves as the Inspectors medical examiner.  This season, the doctor not only has to deal with the local crime lord who is shaking down his wife (She runs a bawdy house.), but also a wayward bother; a fugitive bearing a stolen diamond from the South African mines.

RIPPER STREET continues to be an engrossing one-hour series, filled with fine performances and baffling mysteries.

The 3-disc, 8-episode DVD set from BBC Home Entertainment contains a Behind the Scenes featurette.

6030524,5,B00FRQ0HOQ,A very enjoyable TV series. The cast is witty and eccentric. I would call it a British version of Firefly without the sci-fi. thumbs up BBC!,1397520000,2,140,4.423076923076923
6030525,5,B00FRQ0HOQ,I discovered Ripper Street by accident and am very impressed by the acting and the storylines.  British tv series are different in a good way from those made in U.S. I hope this one goes on for many more seasons!,1397347200,,212,4.3
6030526,5,B00FRQ0HOQ,"God, I was SO glad they picked it up for season 2 and hope it has a long run. It is gritty and violent, as the times were. I love the moral dilemmas and, while I know it is so wrong of me, because he is horrible, I am in lust with Inspector Shine, the bad guy!!
I love Long Susan's character and how she has grown. All the characters are complex and multidimensional and I wait on tenterhooks to see where they go next.
Hopefully they will end the romance between Reid and the Councilwoman. So meh. I love that he has been forced to get his hands dirty and see the reality of the world he has tried to keep himself a bit above. What will they all do/learn next?!?! CAN""T WAIT!!!!",1397347200,,679,4.074626865671642

6030529,4,B00FRQ0HOQ,"I love the concept of the story.  Life after Jack the Ripper.  Leaving law enforcement wondering is Jacks reign of terror over.  The actors are superb.

Here is palpable proof that England is not only the land of poets, but screenwriters, producers, directors, actors, casting, costuming, scenery and absolutely making history come alive and reconciling it with the human condition. Shakespeare must have exhibited monumental knowledge and forethought of this series when he wrote:

The brightest heaven of invention,
A kingdom for a stage, princes to act

6030533,5,B00FRQ0HOQ,"The writers and the actors are all topnotch professionals. Ripper Street tries for period authenticity and succeeds admirably. All the characters are finely wrought. The writing is superb, even down to emulating the speech patterns of the day. What I hate about most period drama is that present day social engineering forces present day politically correct agendas on societies and peoples who lived a hundred years ago. Ripper Street  avoids this. You find issues, mores and attitudes in Ripper Street that were extant in that period of time. I for one appreciate that. Ripper Street is strong unflinching drama which so far has refused to be anything else other than an absorbing period drama of Victorian England delineating the issues of that day as seen through the lens of a police procedural. I can't recommend Ripper Street highly enough.

6030537,5,B00FRQ0HOQ,"I couldn't wait for Season 2 and ended up buying it on Amazon via a tv pass. I don't typically like very violent shows and the new season opens with some violence. The intense acting, dialogue and storyline is fascinating and actually educational. Subjects like opium addiction, vestigial tails, and caesarean birth are covered and the Elephant man, Joseph Merrick makes appearances.  Dialogue is based on the writers' interpretation and the actors' rendition of how people spoke to one another in those times.  I appreciate this because it is likely more accurate than what we're used to in tv and movies.  I'm assuming the depiction of police brutality as a fact of  law enforcement is close to accurate.  I am disturbed only by characters that wear the same clothes every day.  They appear clean and groomed but the suits are the same.

Until the day the BBC decides to make a TV series based on one of her police characters, this is about as close as it comes. Loved the first season, and although I have only seen the first episode of Season 2, it promises to be as good as, or better than Season 1. My daughter says it is too ""dark"" for her taste, and there is very little humor to give a lighter touch.  However, the east side of London during the late 19th century was a dark reality.  Recommended for fans of Victorian mysteries, as well as fans of contemporary police and CSI drama TV series.",1395014400,,713,4.274074074074074
6030563,5,B00FRQ0HOQ,"I LOVE this show not just for the action but for the actors, costumes, and interaction.  Seemingly authentic, there is current century CSI techniques thrown in.  It's a kick to watch.",1395014400,,183,4.870967741935484
6030564,5,B00FRQ0HOQ,"You cannot go wrong with yhis show. Gritty at times but excellant cast. You care about the characters. I only hope they don't cancel prematurely, like they often do with great shows.",1394755200,,182,4.71875
6030565,5,B00FRQ0HOQ,"Love the show - plots and characters as well as the historical setting. According to Wikipedia there are 8 episodes. I've only been able to stream episodes 1,2, and 3 in Amazon Prime. I notice the DVD of Season 2 will be released in mid-April. Will the remaining episodes be available for streaming at that time?",1394668800,,312,4.589285714285714
6030566,5,B00FRQ0HOQ,I absolutely love this series.  Getting to see a unique interpretation of London during Jack the Ripper's reign of the streets is awesome.  Early autopsy and forensic theories are wonderfully done.,1394668800,,197,5.32258064516129
6030567,3,B00FRQ0HOQ,"Ripper Street has some interesting characters but the shows premise may not be sustainable. Its worth giving a try, it might be for you.",1394582400,,136,4.708333333333333
6030568,5,B00FRQ0HOQ,"This series just gets better and better. The pacing, dialogue, acting, sets and costumes: All set a standard that every historical TV series should use as a goal.",1394409600,,162,4.821428571428571
6030569,4,B00FRQ0HOQ,Great characters played by great actors. Even though the overall them of the show is serious there are hints if humor. The plots are always interesting and I like how they show the process of solving a crime in the 1890's vs. current modern day crime shows. Plus I find the vernacular interesting.,1394409600,,297,4.622641509433962
6030570,5,B00FRQ0HOQ,Underrated BBC series. Very entertaining with good character development. I was very disappointed when the BBC decided to drop this show. I suspect that many like me are excited to be able to see Season 3 on Amazon Prime.,1394323200,,221,4.6923076923076925
6030571,4,B00FRQ0HOQ,"Episode 1 of Series 2 started out kind of slow, not as good as the episodes in Series 1, but I watched Episode 2 of Series 2 on BBC America and it was really good so hopefully the rest of Series 2 will be good as well.",1394323200,,218,3.6595744680851063
6030572,5,B00FRQ0HOQ,"Love the setting, atmosphere, complex characters and story line. If you like the Sherlock Holmes movies you will enjoy watching this series.",1394150400,,140,5.409090909090909
6030573,5,B00FRQ0HOQ,"A full hour, commercial free, of great acting and story line. Wonderfully written and performed. Don't miss this terrific series!",1394064000,,129,5.5
6030574,5,B00FRQ0HOQ,I was very happy to hear that Amazon picked up the series for a third season as part of their new Amazon produced films for prime.  This series was fantastic and worth your time to watch.,1393977600,,187,4.194444444444445
6030575,5,B00FRQ0HOQ,Lucky for us that this British series got picked up for a third season.  Don't know why but British television is so much better than American shows.,1393977600,,149,4.518518518518518
6030576,5,B00FRQ0HOQ,"It's refreshing to watch this riveting series. It has such intelligent weaving of plot and character, with substance. Stella, the murdered mother, had lived with her own unique beauty and lack of shame. She and the tortured Alexander/John Goode experienced fleeting peace when they conceived their baby. It takes the beautiful ""monster,"" Joseph Merrick, to remind the young father of that moment of joy and show us that life is worth living despite the physical and pyschic pain we suffer,

To learn about the real Joseph Merrick, a man of courage and dignity, read our new biography of him, available on Amazon, ""Measured by the Soul: The Life of Joseph Carey Merrick.""",1393804800,2,670,4.982142857142857
6030577,5,B00FRQ0HOQ,"I love this show because it has everything you look for in a television show. Amazing actors, who portray multifaceted characters. The actors are so good because they make you care about the characters as individuals, and draw you into each of their lives. The costumes and set design is outstanding, it makes you feel like you are right there in Victorian London. I like how each main character is not all good or all bad, but human, they make mistakes, and then try to make it right. I'm so glad Amazon has gotten season 3, I was worried I would never get to watch my favorite show again!",1393718400,,590,4.422018348623853
6030578,4,B00FRQ0HOQ,"What happened to Season 2  Episode 1... the season starts with episode 2?
I saw the first episode on BBC America but not available to buy on site?",1393718400,,146,4.214285714285714
6030579,5,B00FRQ0HOQ,"Just found out that Series 3 has the go ahead after all - thanks to Amazon Studios.  See article in Sydney Morning Herald entertainment pages.  Filming begins in Britain in May 2014.

6030580,5,B00FRQ0HOQ,"Ripper Street will indeed go on for at least a third season, as announced on Feb. 26, 2014, via a streaming deal between Tiger Aspect Productions, Amazon Prime and the BBC.  Great news!",1393545600,13,185,4.606060606060606
6030581,3,B00FRQ0HOQ,"I'm a long time fan of British TV. I follow the work of several of the actors in this show, particularly Matthew McFadden. With all the practice I have had over the years understanding UK accents (well, not Glaswegian) I'm adept at understanding most of the BBC and PBS Brit TV we get here. But not in this show. Way too much whispering or local accents this American can't understand. I have tried Closed Captioning but it distracts from the great visuals in this show, plus CC makes following the twists and turns of a murder mystery far more difficult. I run the audio through my stereo, which is just stereo sound and don't think blasting my ears by cranking the volume is a good idea.

The premise for this show is solid, the actors are good but I gave up watching this as my budgeted time for TV is not all that long and I got frustrated and gave up.

Too bad the sound mixing is the clincher here. BTW, MANY shows have this audio mixing problem where the master was recorded in a high-end studio with the people probably wearing headphones and not taking int account many of us consumers/viewers aren't blessed with such expensive equipment.",1393459200,3,1148,4.514423076923077
6030582,5,B00FRQ0HOQ,"I'm thoroughly hooked on this smart, unique, high-end production, well-acted show and couldn't be happier that Season 2 is now available on Amazon. I was also delighted to hear that, despite BBC's original regretable decision to drop RS, Amazon stepped in and reached an agreement to produce yet a third season! This show has a huge following of rabid fans (like myself), and we couldn't be more grateful to Amazon! All the more reason to be a Prime Member.
Originally, I became a PM of Amazon just to get my books shipped for free. Now I buy everything from toothpaste, grocery items, office supplies, clothing, makeup and everything under the sun from them...at prices lower than at my local stores. Now, as a bonus, I get top-notch shows like Ripper Street! What's not to love?",1393459200,2,780,4.785185185185185
6030583,5,B00FRQ0HOQ,One of the best shows on television. In the US or in The UK. Artful and keeps you thinking. Perfect combination.,1393459200,2,112,4.380952380952381

6030585,5,B00FRQ0HOQ,"I love this show...watched all first season. Time period is very realistic. Characters are complex, not one-sided. Both a good and bad about each one. You will love this if you are a big murder mystery fan as I am. Very Sherlock Holmes feel- referring to the written version not the Hollywood version.",1393372800,2,301,4.69811320754717

We're inundated with mindless sitcoms and reality TV and yet a show of this caliber is cancelled? I signed a petition on Change.org to keep this show running. The acting is marvelous, the stories riveting and go from bone-chilling drama to just a plain old rollicking good yarn. Come on. Keep this show on the air!!!!",1393200000,,459,4.679012345679013
