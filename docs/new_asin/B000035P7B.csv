He portrayed two characters. The affable everyman & then the deceased Gangsta JD. This film holds a special place in my heart & memory bank.

It could have been my own failing in not being able to keep up with where we were in the past/future, but I did have to stop, rewind, watch, and shrug my shoulders, for certain scenes. Then, I just kept watching. Eventually more peices of the puzzle came together forming a more solid picture.

What the producer was trying to do with time and space was difficult. I enjoyed the hard work, stunts, sexy scenes and dramatic acting by the crew. The level of violence was intense. If you are looking for a perfectly created, high budget movie, this is not for you, but if you are good at spotting the good bones of a structure; (the film), you just may dig it man!",1376438400,,769,4.333333333333333

1258339,5,B000035P7B,"I remember in the early Eighties Siskel and Ebert did a special on the dearth of decent roles for African-American actors.  Despite a renaissance of great parts and great films in the Seventies by the Eighties they had dried up.  Richard Roundtree despite his brilliant work in the ""Shaft"" films was not to be seen.  Pam Grier was relegated to playing a killer prostitute in ""Fort Apache-The Bronx"".  Even a known box office draw like Richard Pryor was relegated to playing insulting roles like ""The Toy"".  If memory serves this show aired prior to Eddie Murphy's breakout part in ""48 Hours"" but that was the exception and not the norm.  Which brings us to ""J.D.'s Revenge"".  When this came out in 1976 it was tagged as a black ""Exorcist"".  This is hardly fair because this film contains little of the gore and head-turning of that film.  Yes there is a certain degree of violence on hand here but nothing I would call excessive.  ""J.D.'s Revenge"" is at turns scary,sexy, witty, and contains a certain macabre humor.  What distinguishes this film is the superlative work of Glynn Turman as Ike/J.D.  If Ike's transformation to the psychotic J.D. were less than subtle then the whole enterprise would fall apart.  Turman makes it believable and doesn't play it tongue-in-cheek which gives his character a little empathy and pathos.  Turman's turn brings to mind Jack Nicholson's work in Stanley Kubrick's ""The Shining"" though truth be told Jack played it over-the-top which was probably apropriate for that flick.  Some would tag ""J.D.'s Revenge"" as blaxploitation and that would be incorrect.  It's a first-rate thriller with a little bit o' soul.",1296432000,7,1647,4.934545454545455
1258340,5,B000035P7B,"Okay, I was a kid when I first saw this film. It's amazing how much gets lost in the translation (pardon the pun), from kid ears to adult understanding. Yet, I loved it then and I really love it now. Glynn Turman is brilliant in the role of law student to street hustler possessed (literally). The rape scene between him and his first-rate co-star, Joan Pringle was OFF THE CHAIN (was distrubing to say the least)!!! Lou Gossett Jr. plays the role of a boxer turned preacher, with all the fire of an olden-day minister. If you are into blaxploitation or are just curious about the genre, get this movie. You'll be glad you did.",1282608000,7,627,4.460869565217391

1258342,3,B000035P7B,"JD's Revenge was a horror thriller released in 1976.  Hitting theaters near the wane of African-American themed genre films, it was released by American International Pictures, which had become perhaps the most prolific American studio to produce `blaxploitation' movies.

Glynn Turman stars as Ike Hendrix, taxi driver and law student in New Orleans, who has a live-in girlfriend, Chrisette (Joan Pringle).  A night on the town with another couple brings the group to a stage hypnotism show.  During the show, Ike somehow is possessed by the spirit of J.D. Walker (john smith), a local hoodlum active during the 1940s who met a violent end at a meatpacking plant.  Shortly, Ike begins to exhibit odd behavior--he buys a vintage used hat, has frequent headaches, but soon his behavior becomes sinister as J.D.'s influence comes to the fore.

Terrorizing cab riders and womanizing are among the sins J.D. commits with Ike's face.  Of particular interest to J.D. is the reverend Elija Bliss, who pastors a popular church in town.  As played by Gossett, Reverend Bliss likes to use boxing metaphors in his sermons; his brother Cleotis apparently handles the business affairs for the church, but based on his dialogue he is not remotely the believer that Elija seemingly is.  Indeed, Cleotis `reminds' Elija that the church is just a barely-veiled hustle, and sends some ushers to rough up Ike when he takes Elija's lustful daughter home.

Pros
New Orleans is an interesting change of pace from the most frequent genre settings of New York (Harlem) or Los Angeles.  Bourbon Street and other locales are showcased.  The film handles Ike's internal struggle fairly well--mild mannered and genial normally, smug and swaggering as J.D. By the film's climax the possessed Ike has permed his hair and bought a garish suit to complete his `old-school' look.  The principal and supporting actors all play it straight, which helps avoid a campy feel to what is already a high-concept story.  Some unintentional humor is wrought from a doctor who suggests to stressed-out Ike that he smoke some marijuana to calm down.  The same can be said for when the movie's main couples celebrate an anniversary at a topless nightclub.  Slightly less humorous is Ike's pal coming up with a rather reaching justification for Ike's slapping around Chrisette while possessed.

Cons
The climax of the film sets up a revelation that clever viewers may likely have figured out beforehand.  The epilogue is fairly cut and dry despite the fantastic series of events that just took place.  Despite some mirror-image appearances, there is no verbal confrontation between Ike and J.D., which could have been interesting--instead, Ike just totally blacks out whenever J.D. takes over.  There are also several subplots that the movie seems to ignore.  Despite this, ""JD's Revenge"" is a good B-film.",1269820800,,2859,5.118534482758621
1258343,5,B000035P7B,"This movie is absolutely great!  It's hillarious indirectly, but the plot holds your interest just well enough to watch it from start to end.

1258344,5,B000035P7B,"I wonder if some writer in the 70's saw the movie, ""The Reincarnation of Peter Proud"" and said it wasn't scary enough? The idea of a black...nerdy...law school student having visions of a lady and pimp's murder while he's wide awake must have been very wild in the 70's when all those occult movies were all over the place. JD had only two uses for women....sex and punching bags. When he takes over nerdy Ike, it's time for some changes.....from clothing, talking, all the way down to sex with his lady. Tell him I'll see him on the kill'n floor. He knows where it is.",1259020800,,569,4.428571428571429

Not exactly a blaxploitation work (though originally released from American International, company famous for Pam Grier's movies), ""J.D.'s Revenge"" is a rivetting shocker that has still considerable power to grip your heart.
Set in modern New Orleans, the film tells a story of a law school student working as a taxi driver, Ike (Turnan, superb acting).  One day, just for fun, he and his friends decide to see a hypnotist's show, in which Ike volunteers to be on the stage.  Being hypnotized as part of the show, however, he sees something very weird ... and his plight begins.  Haunted by the repeated nightmarish vision, he starts to behave like someone else.  Or, maybe, he really became another person....
The film uses fine locations of New Orleans, and all the cast give their great performance.  Most notable is Turnan, whose changing personality compels you to keep watching the film; also good is Gosset Jr. (credited as Lou Gosset) as a preacher who has a secret in his past (though his part is smaller than Tarnan)  Though made with low budget, ""J.D.'s Revenge"" entertains you more than you expect.  But note: the film is very violent, and sometimes repellent (one character is physically assaulted, and the scene is painful to watch).  Still, the vitality of the film is undeniable.  My only complaint is its banal title and a little flat ending.  The film's good, though.",1010361600,9,1508,4.874509803921568

Those films made mostly in the 70s that featured an urban setting, starred black actors in lead roles and usually ran to either heavy duty action flicks or twists on horror films. They were pure entertainment made for theaters that catered to black audiences but that found fans among all races. Titles like FRIDAY FOSTER, SLAUGHTER, BLACULA and DR. BLACK AND MR. HYDE were regular features shown in theaters that catered to fans.

J.D.S REVENGE is one among the many films of this genre that was much better than one would expect. It opens in 1942 with a black gangster arguing with a woman who then slashes her throat killing her. J.D. Walker runs in to find her dead, blood on his hands when he picks her up and then discovered by her lover who kills him on the spot.

Fast forward to present day (in this case 1976). Isaac (Glynn Turman) is a law student who drives a cab part time. Live in girlfriend Christella (Joan Pringle) encourages him to get ahead. They head out for a night on the town with two friends and end up at a club where Isaac is hypnotized. Unfortunately that provides a gateway for J.D. to reenter the world and possess Isaac off and on.

Christella and his friends know something is wrong but they cant quite figure out what it is. One moment Isaac is fine and the next he seems like someone else altogether, which of course he is. And when he is he is prone to violent acts of rage.

The story begins to flesh out when Isaac ends up in a church where ex-boxer turned preacher Rev. Elija Bliss (Louis Gossett Jr.) is preaching. It was Bliss who killed J.D. all those years ago. The woman murdered was J.D.s sister and Bliss was her lover. As the possessed Isaac watches he begins to plan his revenge. Just who really killed his sister is yet unknown but will be revealed by the last portion of the film.

There is plenty of story involved in this movie, enough that it neednt have been a Blaxploitation film at all. It stands on its own as a tale of possession, revenge, love, hate and the supernatural. The acting is well done by all involved and shows Turman at the top of his game. For some reason he seemed to find more work on TV than in films and thats sad. He deserved better.

The film doesnt rely on gore to tell the story and uses the abilities of Turman in the shifting role of Isaac/J.D. instead. Some special effects are on hand but they are not used in such a way as to become the centerpiece. It is Turmans performance that makes the film work. The end result is a movie that while part of the whole Blaxploitation genre is among the best that was offered.

Arrow Video is releasing this in their usual manner, which means the best edition you will find. The movie itself is a 2k restoration from original film elements produced exclusively for this Arrow release. There are numerous interviews on hand here, the original theatrical trailer, reversible sleeve artwork, a collection of trailers for the films of director Arthur Marks and for the first pressing of the title a booklet written by author Kim Fields. If you bought this long ago on video or one of the numerous bootleg copies that have existed for some time, now is the time to step up to this edition. It also surpasses the Soul Cinema collection edition released before.",1511308800,,3332,4.461412151067323
7916711,3,B000035P7B,"A possession story that skews closer to Jekyll and Hyde than The Exorcist, 1976's J.D.'s Revenge is certainly an outlier amidst the usual action-oriented blaxploitation releases of the day.  Lead actor Glynn Turman modeled his terrific performance after Spencer Tracey's turn as the tortured doctor in the 1941 adaptation of Robert Louis Stevenson's story.  Here, a hardworking law student / taxi driver finds his personality overtaken by the soul of a 1940s numbers racketeer out for revenge against those who done him wrong.

After participating in an onstage hypnotism act, Isaac (Turman) is tortured by flashbacks of memories that aren't his own.  Inexplicably, the spirit of J.D. Walker, who was set up for the murder of his own sister, has been reborn, forcing Isaac to commit brutal acts against those he loves and hunt down the people responsible for his death 30 years ago.

One of those people is Reverend Elija Bliss (Louis Gossett, Jr.), a former fighter turned evangelist who milks his congregation for money.  As J.D. plots his revenge, he uses Isaac's body to have a little naughty fun, trolling the clubs, picking up women and wielding his signature straight razor against anyone who stands in his way.  Isaac's friends are at a loss to explain his abusive split personality and even the police begin to suspect something supernatural might be going on.  But can they find an answer before J.D.'s revenge drags Isaac down with him?

The script offers one hell of an acting showcase for Turman, who was still getting accolades for Cooley High.  But it also layers in some surprising insights into black male culture, with the character of J.D. serving as Isaac's psychological id run amok, performing acts of emotional and sexual dominance that the mild-mannered student might have been repressing all along.  Director Arthur Marks (Detroit 9000) restrains himself as well, holding back most of the expected sex and violence for J.D.'s hilariously over-the-top mid-film escapade.

The set-up is a bit clumsy, likely due to missing flashbacks cut by distributor AIP before release, making the sepia-toned intro a mystery for a good chunk of the film.  Without any real introduction to J.D.'s character, the audience is never quite sure what to expect.  But for the most part,  J.D.'s Revenge follows Turman's lead, delivering a serious domestic drama that pushes the blaxploitation genre in new and unexpected directions.

Arrow Video's new 2K restoration from the original film elements looks awful good, with natural film grain and enough clarity to spot the individual sweat droplets on the actor's foreheads.  And they go overboard with a 45-minute Making Of documentary that gathers Turman, Marks and editor George Folsey, Jr. commenting on the experience, plus a 15-minute audio interview with J.D. himself, David McKnight.  A still gallery and a collection of trailers from other Arthur Marks' production are included as well.",1510963200,,2947,5.181434599156118
