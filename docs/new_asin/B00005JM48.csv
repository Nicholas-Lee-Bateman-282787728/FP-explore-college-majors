1473206,5,B00005JM48,"HE LOVES ME, HE LOVES ME NOT opened on Valentine's Day. It's the product of a twisted sense of humor. My wife and I loved it.
Audrey Tatou, the effervescent and funny-faced do-gooder of AMELIE, plays Angelique, a talented French art student in the throes of an affair with eminent cardiologist Loc (Samuel Le Bihan), who's two-timing his pregnant wife Rachel (Isabelle Carre). The film's very first scene shows Angelique amidst the blooms in a flower shop picking out the single, perfect rose for her beloved. (Hold this image!) Angelique dreams of having Loc for herself, but feels threatened by Rachel's pregnancy. Then, in short order, Rachel miscarries after being accidently struck by a motor scooter, and then has a serious falling out with her husband. Angelique is elated, and readies herself for a getaway to Florence with newly unencumbered lover. But, after Loc stands her up at the airport, Angelique wallows in the wrath of a woman scorned. Then, one of Loc's female patient's charges him with assault. Fiercely possessive even now, Angelique takes drastic action. However, after Rachel, a lawyer, comes to her estranged husband's aid, Angelique realizes that she's lost him forever and commits suicide by gassing herself with the kitchen oven.
Have I spoiled the plot? Ah, think again! As Angelique's EKG flatlines, the movie literally fast reverses to the opening scene at the florist and another story begins.
Ms. Tatou again shows herself as the worthy successor to the delightful Audrey Hepburn. But if you're a male who, like me, wanted to take her AMELIE character home to meet Mom, perhaps you should rethink. And Le Bihan is excellent as the heartless cad. Or is he? (A cad, that is.)
Not since Nicole Kidman's THE OTHERS (2001) have I seen such a fiendishly clever use of misdirection and altered perspective. HE LOVES ME, HE LOVES ME NOT is a deliciously wicked black comedy. And you'd be surprised how prescription drugs can be utilized as an artist's medium. I cannot recommend this startling film too highly. Don't wait until next Valentine's Day to see it.",1045267200,9,2084,4.974212034383954
1473207,5,B00005JM48,"Audrey Tautou's movie career began a scant 4 years ago with ""The Venus Beauty Institute"" and reached it's zenith, we thought with the delightful, though sometimes mean-spirited, ""Amelie.""
And it looked like her current American release, ""He Loves Me, He Love Me Not"" was going down the same road that began with ""Amelie"": optimistic and waif-like Angelique (Tautou), always smiling, always pleasant, always looking for the good side of things, waiting patiently for the attentions of Mr. Right, who comes in the guise of Loic (Samuel Le Bihan).
Then Angelique's psyche begins to unravel due to several acts of cruelty and thoughtlessness by Loic and director, Laetitia Colombani's sunny and light film begins a slow slide into a creepy suspense thriller. Colombani's touch is so assured and so deft that we hardly notice the gradual, unnerving change of mood and point of view...likewise with Tautou's performance. Angelique is the flip side of Amelie: appreciating the fragrance of a flower has now descended into throwing the flower into an incinerator and watching it burn.
""He Loves Me, He Loves Me Not"" is an unexpected, surprising and perverse pleasure but it is also ultimately a tribute to and an appreciation of Audrey Tautou's talent, resourcefulness and, more to the point the inner fortitude that demands that she move her career away from the tried and true.",1045180800,27,1371,5.125

1473359,5,B00005JM48,"I don't speak French, but the subtitles work well for me.  This movie is intense.  Great twist in the plot",1415404800,,106,4.25
1473360,5,B00005JM48,"Okay -- I'll admit that this movie was terribly marketed in the U.S. as a romantic comedy (""Amelie"" fans, I feel your pain). Stupid move, PR people -- almost as dumb as the film festivals that show this around Valentine's Day. But that's about the only thing out of whack here. Perhaps it will be better received now that it's been repackaged in a more-serious-looking box (with improved subtitles); perhaps the fact that it's been more than a decade since Audrey Tautou burst onto the scene in America (and was being billed as the 21st century Audrey Hepburn) will adjust expectations a bit. Without giving anything away -- the plot's success hinges on surprising the audience -- the bottom line is this:

-- This is not supposed to be funny. Don't go into this film expecting to laugh. Sure, opening the movie with a happy-sounding theme filled with roses and hearts makes you think you're in for a warm and fuzzy time. And yes, there are amusing moments in the first 45 minutes or so, but ""Amelie"" it's not. The second half of the film is no joyride; it's a house of horrors. You'll never think of Nat King Cole's ""L.O.V.E."" or one of the most-iconic, Cupid-based ""I'm in love with you"" images the same way again.

-- Keep in mind the subject matter and the exact situation being portrayed here before you call it ""silly,"" ""unwatchable,"" ""a failure,"" etc. [A lot of other reviewers have used these terms to describe this movie.] What we have here is half ""Gilligan's Island,"" half ""Misery.""

-- Appreciate the unique approach taken to tell this tale, and the way two viewpoints weave together almost seamlessly. When I first saw the movie in 2003, it was the first time I'd seen this type of ""she vs. he"" angle. Yes, it's ""sort of"" been done before. And it's been done a few times since (with variations), but director Laetitia Colombani's effort is still one of the best.

-- ""Liking"" a character is a matter of personal taste [again, a lot of other reviews have ripped the film for this]. The characters portrayed in ""Seinfeld,"" for example, were very self-centered and unlikeable, yet the American public adored them for eight years. The same goes here -- everybody has their flaws, and this movie lays them in front of you like a dinner plate (especially in the first half). Not every love story can be ""Casablanca"" or ""Sleepless in Seattle.""

-- Sure, this is a chick flick -- if your idea of one is along the lines of ""Sybil"" or ""Carrie.""

-- Yes, there are a few inconsistencies, common sense issues, and moments where you want to scream ""WTF! I would never have done that!"" But name one movie that doesn't have instances like these.

-- If this movie were truly that bad, it would have tanked the careers of Tautou and at least some of her costars (Samuel Le Bihan, Isdabelle Carre, Clement Sibony and Sophie Guillemen), to name a few. Every one of the principle characters has continued or gone on to a significant career in French cinema, TV, or theater, to the tune of more than 80 movies, 8 television shows, and 14 Cesar awards (out of 22 nominations).

Does it really deserve a 5-star rating? Honestly, no. In my opinion, five stars is near perfection, along the lines of ""The Godfather,"" ""Twelve Angry Men,"" or ""All Quiet on the Western Front."" But this film doesn't deserve 4 out of 5 stars, which is the equivalent of a B- letter grade. I'd give this film a solid 4 1/2 stars if possible.

Lastly, three requests: First, Hollywood, please keep your hands off this one. You've already tried remaking other French classics, with mixed results: For every ""Three Men and a Baby"" (from ""Three Men and a Cradle""),  there are three or four like ""Dinner for Schmucks"" (based on ""The Dinner Game""). So far, you've left well enough alone. Keep it that way.

Second, somebody PLEASE put this on Blu-ray.

And God, make no sequel to this. We don't need ""I Still Love Loic,"" or ""Angelique: The Later Years,"" or some horrible thing. Let's just keep this whole episode...in the backs of our minds.",1413158400,3,4002,4.6290550070521865

1473472,4,B00005JM48,"After the enromous success of Amelie, the lovely Audrey Tautou starred this dramatic comedy around the obssesive love of an eminent cardiologist by a crazy college student.

The film touches various aspects such as incomprehension of his wife, the unsuccessful attempt of a medical student crazy about her, the singular and desolate world of this lonely young man, and a series of accidents caused to try to ward off love the doctor and his lovely wife.

In this sense, the rotation of the film does not speculate the feverish picture of Adrian Lynne (Fatal Attraction), but about the failed realization of first love, youthful erotic.

Stunning photography, imaginative script, brilliant direction and brilliant performances make this film a remarkable job.",1315440000,,758,5.3

1473554,5,B00005JM48,"I did not expect to like this movie, because I've never particularly liked Audrey Tautou, but that was only the first of many surprises.  Mlle. Tautou plays her disturbing part extremely well.  One is carried along in sympathy with her and her sad plight for fully half the film.  All of a sudden there's an actual re-wind at great speed  -  this might have taken as little as a couple of seconds, but it seems to be all there -  and the film begins again.  At this point one's uneasiness and expectations quickly increase.  Not wishing to give away too much, I can only say that the story as re-told, a la Rashomon, from the point of view of her supposedly caddish cardiologist seducer (what is it about cardiologists anyway?) is a completely different kettle of boullabaisse. A would-be MacGuffin turns out to be otherwise, and the rest is even more of a jolt as it unfolds. Only the very faint of heart will wish to turn away at this point. It is macabre fun at its very best.  A note to film lovers: there's a brief but very telling quote from ""Jules and Jim"" near the end.  There may be other film quotes earlier on, but we were too wrapped up in the story to notice.  Highly recommended.",1313193600,,1193,4.401826484018265

The plot/story is told by all the participants through their own eyes and it would depend on which version you believe.

It is endlessly seductive and surprising.

Essentially, it is two movies, from two polar points of view: the female's and the male's.

It takes a winsome romantic love-story, and turns it on its head.

But even though the plot is fraught with delusion and confusion, the love-story remains charming and alluring, if also terrifying.

The acting is superb.  Casting Audrey Tautou as the female lead was inspired.  She is so girlish and open-eyed that her transformation is all the more shocking.

The sunny photography is also brilliant.  The movie seems set in a perpetual brilliant summer, even at the end when the lead gets away, leaving her pill-art to be scraped off the wall.

Fun and frightening.",1279411200,2,738,4.879032258064516

The young directress, from ""Mes stars et moi"" does very feminine films,
not in the best sense. Perfect setting, chic everything, Art is all around, romance is all
that matters, nutty, hysterical women, catchy pop tunes...
Tatou does Angelique, but supposedly ""mad"" now. As she's not convincing at all, the movie falters.

Beautiful Isabelle Carr, who starred ""Maman est folle"" and played the
little girl in the gifted ""Les enfants du marais"", plays the doctor's wife, a character which never really leaves ground. Interestingly enough, she starred ""Anna O."" where she's, guess what, a loner who becomes in mad love with her doctor. ...

Clment Sibony, who starred ""l'envol"" with Isabelle, is reportedly pretty handsome according to my female company while watching the film. He's very convincing in an
unconvincing role. Nice lodie Navarre, from Reporters (TV) and Love, etc. is wasted
here, her character suddenly gains importance, for then disappearing.
Hlose's character is insipid, which is a pity for it probably was
supposed to serve as counterbalance to Anglique, but goes off the
story at the time it should be more present, that is, in the last 1/3rd
of the movie.

I've been told from a reputable cinema buff this film is a rip-off from
""Fatal attraction"" and the less obvious ""The Crush (1993)"" starring
Alicia Silverstone as a 14 year old, the same mental age than
ngelique.

I never understood the genre of the film. Creative Amazon reviewer
Simon (ON) writes ""romantic thriller"" which is probably even right,

Let start out by saying that this movie struck me the wrong way because I was expecting a comedy. He Loves Me, He Loves Me Not, is clever and well done, but it is definitely not funny.

Audrey Tatou plays Angelique-an art student carrying on a passionate affair with a married cardiologist, Loric, played by Samuel Le Bihan. Or so the viewer is led to believe. For the first half hour of the film we see Angelique buying her lover roses, meeting her lover in the bathroom for an illicit rendevous, and walking with him through the gardens of Bourdeaux. Audrey Tatou plays Angelique in her cute elfin cum ingenue way-laughing and joking with her friends about her affair. I thought this was a romatic comedy in the style of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Priceless/dp/B001CIOCLC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Priceless</a>.

And then things rewind and we witness the scenes from Loric's point of view. To make a long story short, Angelique is a complete nutcase and the whole affair is entirely in Angelique's head. Angelique is following Loric to the bathroom so that it looks like they are having a rendevous.  She is planning romantic trips to Florence and he ... doesn't even know her. It gets very dark when we find that Angelique has run over Loric's wife with her moped and killed their baby.

The plot of He Love Me... caught me off guard. It's not that it was bad, but there was something disturbing about Audrey Tatou's perky personality against the backdrop of this disturbing film. Imagine casting Aubrey Hepburn in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Fatal-Attraction-Special-Collector-s-Edition/dp/B00003CXA0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Fatal Attraction (Special Collector's Edition)</a>&nbsp;and having her act like she's still in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Breakfast-At-Tiffany-s-Paramount-Centennial-Collection/dp/B001HPP2XW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Breakfast At Tiffany's - Paramount Centennial Collection</a>. In the end the disconnect between the personality and the plot adds to the idea that the whole thing is in Angelique's head because she is not reacting with the reality around her. But it throws the viewer for a loop.

A good thriller and a thousand times better than the trite and contrived Fatal Attraction. Just don't be fooled by Audrey's cute little smile on the cover!",1243728000,,2450,5.985714285714286

 la folie... pas du tout (2002) aka He Loves Me... He Loves Me Not was written/ directed by Laetitia Colombani and starred Audrey Tautou. It was made right after 'Amelie' and it looks like 'Amelie', especially in the opening scenes on the beautiful and colorful streets of Bordeaux that prepare a viewer for the light romantic story. Young and pretty Art student Angelique (Audrey Tautou) seems to have found her fabulous destiny and the love of her life in Laic, a cardiologist (Samuel Le Bihan) who seems to be as much in love with her as she is with him. But is he? And what about his wife who is pregnant with their first child? Step by step, the film takes an interesting turn and becomes a story rather dark and disturbing, told from different perspectives, Rashomon - style. What started as a light and sweet romantic comedy, very successfully turned into a well made thriller. The way the young writer/director presented and contrasted two points of view at the same events, is remarkable. We all know from Geometry classes that parallel lines never cross, at least in Euclid's Geometry they don't but sometimes when you look at the lines in space from certain POV, it looks like they cross - I kept thinking about it while watching He Loves Me... He Loves Me Not which I highly recommend.

1473765,5,B00005JM48,"Having just seen this Film last night, it left such an impression on me that I just had to write a review today.

"" la folie... pas du tout"", American title: ""He loves me, He loves me not"" is a film that starts happy, romantic, sunny, delightful and after a while starts to grow to a suspenceful, heavy, even dark, thriller. I will write the next part of my review in a way that I won't spoil the story or any of it's surprising elements, you just have to see those for yourself:
Audrey Tautou plays Anglique, an art student who we find out has a relationship with a married heartdoctor called Loc, who is in a divorce with his wife. She is madly in love and can't stop smiling. But then after a few times of Loc not showing up at dates, meetings and a planned trip abroad with her, she doesn't understand it anymore: She knows he loves her, Why isn't he showing up??

The film itself is a great surprise and I was blown away by how the story is told and how it slowly unrevels. The way the film is shifting from one situation to another is well done and gives the film a nice and solid look. It is all very colorful and well edited. Also the music fits the film and brings a strong atmosphere to live.
Audrey Tautou shows that she is a great actress and can play different roles perfectly. She is totally believable and acts convincing. Samuel Le Bihan as Loc was also a fine casting choice. He fits the role magnificently and plays the doctor in an also convincing way. You will feel for the characters.

What can I say, just see this film. It is surely one of the most surprising films I have ever seen. It's absorbing. It is a strong story that left me breathless and will give you another look at those magical eyes of Audrey Tautou.
Brilliant film. Prepare to experience it.",1185667200,2,1780,4.275964391691395
1473766,5,B00005JM48,"To escape being typecast as cute, Audrey plays a psychotic with a dangerous delusion.  The film presents the story to the viewer from two perspectives, with an ending that reminds one of Alfred Hitchcock.  Ms. Tautou plays her youthful, sweet smile to great effect, and the viewer is manipulated into compassion - for the wrong person.  Even if Audrey Tautou were not in the film, it is worth seeing.",1179100800,,400,4.768115942028985
1473767,2,B00005JM48,"Audrey Tatou is most well known for her kooky role in Amelie, a film that's greatly admired, and that I loved. I also liked her in A Very Long Engagement. I borrowed this from a friend, as I hadn't seen it yet, but then I took ages to get around to watching it.

During the first forty minutes of this film, you will consider switching it off. It's very strange. For starters, the boyfriend appears as a jerk, yet Anglique seems completely besotted, dare I say it OBSESSED, despite the fact he's not only married, and as a child on the way, but seems to treat her with nothing but contempt. And he barely speaks in the first forty minutes. It's a whirlwind romance, and things seem to be happening way too fast.

Don't touch your remotes when it starts ""rewinding"" itself though, this is a very clever thing. The film actually switches points of view, from Anglique to Loc, the boyfriend, played by Samuel Le Bihan, who was also in Brotherhood Of The Wolf.

It's quite a twisted plot, and I really don't want to give too much away in this review. Even from reading the blurb on the back, you don't expect He Loves Me, He Loves Me Not, to unfold the way it does. It does invite comparisons to Fatal Attraction, but it's a lot cleverer than that. It's also the French version of Sliding Doors I guess, it has a couple of similarities in it.

However, it does drag out just slightly too long. When everything is on the screen in front, you're nodding, and waiting for it to end. But it doesn't. I actually ended up hating the Anglique character, and the mood I was in as well, did not help. Samuel Le Bihan does play a brilliant character, although it was kinda irritating in the first forty minutes how he didn't have anything lines to say. The second half is where he comes through.

Looking at stuff on IMDB, it's quite interesting, as one reviewer described it, as how the different titles in different countries, are literally ""lost in translation"". The French title translated straight into English is ""Passionately... not at all"" - the first half from Anglique, the second half from Loc. But the full phrase is actually ""il m'aime a la folie, il m'aime pas du tout"", which means ""he loves me, a little, a lot, passionately, crazily (insanely), not at all"". The German title is ""Wahnsinnig verliebt"", which means ""crazily in love"".

I'm not sure if I would ever watch this again, it is a very strange film, but it's definitely worthwhile picking up on the cheap. Just don't expect another Amelie.",1174176000,,2499,4.529933481152994

I must echo previous comments in praising Audrey Tautou on her seemingly effortless approach to a character who is very easy to play on the surface, but dramatically complex behind the curtain.  As an avid viewer of films foreign and domestic, romantic and thriller, I recommend ""He Loves Me, He Loves Me Not"" to all of my friends and now I'm recommending it to you.",1172448000,,695,4.464566929133858

When he skips out on their promised trip to Florence, Angelique spirals into depression. Then the film jumps back to the beginning, and we see the whole story from the doctor's point-of-view. And what a view it is...

My sister recommended this to me after watching it in her French class. If you're going in expecting this to be a fluffy romance-comedy about two lovers who keep missing each other due to circumstance, be prepared for a huge shock halfway into the film. This film is not what it appears to be (no thanks to other reviewers who have spoiled it), and even after you know the whole story it still works well as a romantic thriller (and how many films do we know that fit into that genre?).

Of course the cruel-yet-fun thing to do would be to pass it off as a romantic comedy to your significant other, then watch their mouths slowly fall open in shock as the story reveals itself. As the film definitely merits repeat viewings, you might find yourself with the urge to play this joke sometime...

This film is built on the fact that audiences want so much to like her, with her large eyes, childlike face and full  girlish figure.  Any man would be in love with her, right?  So goes the first half of this film... this guy is an incredible jerk.  Then the film literally reverses and we see everything from the beginning again, from his point of view, and it is a different story entirely.

  This movie is packaged badly.  I think they were capitalizing on the success of Audrey and ""Amelie""  and it has been packaged like a cartoon.  Even in the begginning, it is nothing like that.  This is the only problem with this film.

  This is a very highly produced, modern melodrama about how our perception creates our version of reality.  The story is the grist of ""movie of the week"" fare, but it is the style, the telling of it, and the performances which make it top notch.  The entire cast is exceptional, there are some wonderful wrenching scenes from small supporting players.

I cannot stand any woman that dates a married man, then whines when he won't spend time with her, and always tells friends that he will leave his wife any minute.  And then when you realize that she's just a nutter, I hatted her because she practically ruined that man's life, killing his baby, ruining his career, and leaving him disabled.

And then the illusion falls apart!  The movie would not have been as effective with a more ""vampy"" female lead.  When the woman comes across and sexually aggressive, you expect the worst from her.

Audrey Tautou is refreshingly different from her breakthrough role in Amelie as the intense but vulnerable Angelique, a promising artist in love with a doctor who refuses to leave his pregnant wife.

Angelique, in turn, remains doggedly faithful to Loic despite the advances of a lovesick friend and the exasperation of her co-worker. The strain begins to wear her down, however, until she realizes that something must be done.

1473839,4,B00005JM48,"This French film starring Audrey Tautou of ""Amelie"" fame begins as  though a predictable romance about a charming young and talented artist who throws away her life while waiting for her married lover.  Angelique is madly in love with Loic (Samuel Le Bihan), a cardiologist whose lawyer-wife is pregnant.  Viewers recognize Loic as the typical lout, the man who wants both the comfort of married life and the thrill of an affair  - and who, when pushed, will always choose his wife.  Angelique is so taken with Loic that she fails to recognize the devoted love of her friend, the cute medical student David (Clment Sibony).  Partway through, however, just as the viewer has settled into it, the story twists upon itself - and ""He Love Me, He Loves Me Not"" becomes a completely different film.

Audrey Tautou plays the waif-like Angelique with such charm and energy that her performance adds another layer to what happens.  Viewers watching this film more than once (as many will want to) will see how her acting hints at what will transpire.  A lesser actress might have performed the role as though there were two separate movies, but Tautou remains true to her character, even if the viewer cannot know what that means.  The rest of the cast is competent, with only Sibony and Isabelle Carr, as Angelique's friend Rachel, standing out.  Like ""Amelie"", this is a star vehicle for Tautou, although viewers familiar with the earlier film will be surprised to see that Angelique is nothing like Tatou's earlier role.

The flip side of this is that nearly any review (including this one) will ruin any surprises that the film holds.  Therefore - PLEASE just watch it and don't read too much first.  Truly, the beauty of this film is its ability to turn the viewer into a liar.  Two contradictory positions seem equally valid, and it is only the last word that leaves the viewer with a sense of which is accurate.

Well, whatever it is, it's a doozey!  The plot and script are wickedly clever.  The actors are all ""spot on.""  The photography, colors, and sets are captivating.  And you will never think of one of Nat King Cole's songs in quite the same way again.  The juxtaposition of that song with the unfolding story is jarringly suitable.

Since the gist of the story has been shared by other reviewers, I will not go into that part here.  Just let me underline what others have said: Audrey Tautou is the perfect foil for this romance.  When you first see her, smiling amongst the roses in the florist's shop, you just know you are in for ""Amelie, Part Deux.""  But wait a minute: the title of this movie is not ""Amelie,"" and Audrey Tautou, in this movie, has moved on -- on to different territory.  She just brought her smile along.

As the second half of this movie progressed, I found myself smiling with wonder at the cleverness of it, delighted with what I saw.  I couldn't help but think of the song, ""I've looked at love from both sides now . . . and still somehow, it's love's illusions I recall . . .""  And if you like surprises, fiendishly clever surprises, you will smile, too.

1473939,4,B00005JM48,"Have you ever realised that a story can be totally different, depending on whom is telling it?. This movie illustrates that point quite well.

""He Loves Me, He Loves Me Not"" begins with a young woman, Angelique (Audrey Tautou), picking out the ""perfect rose"" as a gift for her lover. He is  Loic (Samuel Le Bihan), a cardiologist who happens to be married. Loic promised Angelique that he was going to leave his pregnant wife, in order to be with her. Despite that, he doesn't do so, behaving like a total cad regarding both his wife and Angelique. We get to know all that as we watch what happens, from Angelique's perspective.

But is that true?. Or it depends on the point of view of the person who is telling the story?. The spectator will have the opportunity of finding out, because midway through the movie the director (Laetitia Colombani) changes tracks, ""rewinds"" the story and begins to tell it from Loic's  point of view. We learn, once again, that things are not always what they seem to be.

All in all, I really liked this movie. It certainly wasn't what I expected, but some surprises are good, and this is one of them. After all, there are a lot of good romantic comedies, but not so many movies that start like light romances and end up as more or less dark suspense thrillers. What is more, ""He Loves Me, He Loves Me Not"" has such a rapid and absolute reversal of roles that you won't have neither the time nor the inclination to get bored. Who is good, and who is bad?. Who is more or less normal and who is downright crazy?. Watch this movie and find out  :)

1473940,2,B00005JM48,"Whilst the cinematography, film editing and performance of the actors in Colombani's ""He loves me he loves me not"" is of note, the after taste is unpleasant and the overall feel I was left with was a totally disagreeable and unsettling one, for the following reasons:

Unsatisfying:

Because of the absence of what the ancient Greek tragedy referred to as ""katharsis"", i.e. the purging of emotional tensions . There is no satisfaction of good prevailing over evil or of justice being done. I was left with the same unsatisfactory feeling I experienced after watching ""The Talented Mr Ripley"". This feeling is even more unsatisfactory when it is the result of a very predictable trick from the director to differentiate herself by departing from a classic happy ending and presenting us with a concluding development that is both odd and unpleasant.

Pointless:

What is the message in this film? That there are many weird and psychotic people out there? Ok, thanks. Now what? At least if there were a prevalence of good over evil, the film would have a conventional message perhaps, but a reasonably original platform for transmitting this message.

Weak:

There are at least three scenes in the storyline which are simply impossible to digest.

One relates to Samuel Le Bihan's character getting oddly excited about hearing Nat King Cole's ""L-O-V-E"" song in his clinic. We know that he hasn't clicked yet that Audrey Tautou's character is haunting him, so why does he get so excited?

The next relates to him being so ""off guard"" when he eventually realises what has happened and meets Audrey Tautou's character. I felt so apprehensive of this encounter and Samuel le Bihan's character was so unconvincigly and inexplicably relaxed and indifferent. All this to create a stage that would allow for the very predictable dramatic sequence that followed to take place.

The final scenes were also totally unconvincing. Psychiatric hospitals do not, as far as I know, let you take medication at you own leisure but force you to swallow. I can accept that a patient may avoid consumption of medication once or twice by pretending to swallow, but to avoid this continuously to the rather rediculous extent shown in the film is laughable.

If you are fond of Audrey Tautou who is admittedly very talented, watch "" Dirty Pretty Things"" where she plays a very real and normal (as opposed to unreal and weird in ""He loves me he loves me not"" and ""Amelie"") role in a film with a watertight storyline, deep and meaningful message and a very satisfactory prevalence of good over evil.

He Loves Me, He Loves Me Not tells a two-sided love story: one of budding romance turning into neglect and one of mysterious obsession bordering on danger.

Audrey Tautou stars as Angelique, an art student in love with the cardiologist Loic, who claims that he will leave his pregnant wife for her. She sends him little notes and leaves surprises at his office for him, and he, in turn, plans to take her on a trip to Florence.

However, strange things start happening: Angelique gets in a moped accident; Loic's wife gets in a fight with him and leaves, after having a miscarriage; a woman accuses Loic of assault and battery, then mysteriously dies of a heart attack the very same night. And we begin to think that maybe Angelique isn't seeing this relationship the same way that Loic is.

The film does a magnificent job of showing the two sides to this story, and it becomes more involving as each scene plays out. About halfway through, the entire story gets rewound and told from a different perspective, and subverts everything that has gone before.

The viewer begins to wonder as Angelique's passionate affair begins to appear more and more one-sided. Has Loic (the cardiologist) dumped her? Is he tired of her? And what of his pregnant wife?

The answers to these questions come in a twist as clever and well-directed as it comes--a complete surprise as the second half of the film takes on a whole new tone.

The winsome Angelique first appears peeking out from a profusion of hundreds of vivid flowers, a kaleidoscopic, psychedelic, Walt Disney burst of glorious technicolor redolent of Easter and Alice in Wonderland. With Bambi eyes aglitter, the gamine persuades the florist to deliver a single flower to her beloved, a married doctor about to leave his wife for her.  Outside the shop, the adventure begins as the deliveryman on his moped takes off for the doctor's office while Angelique on her svelte bicycle whirls off in the opposite direction.  We follow her through charming Bordeaux as she bubbles on ecstatically about her Loic, obsessively draws and paints his portrait over and over, receives a prestigious art scholarship, meets with her lover at a reception, tries on a wedding dress, plans a romantic trip, all the while pursued by an obsessive medical student who idolizes her despite her love for the doctor.  As the plot unwinds, Angelique finally falls into a coma signalled by a whirlwind of scenes from her immediate past, culminating in a return to the beginning of the film.  Once again, she persuades the florist to have the rose delivered. Outside the florist shop, she once more mounts her bicycle while the deliveryman mounts his moped.  But this time, we follow the deliveryman to Loic's office.  From then on, every scene is juxtaposed to the corresponding scene in the first half of the film as seen within the doctor's frame of reference. Not a detail is missed as we are cunningly led behind the mirror to relive the past events from a totally different perspective, so familiar yet so different.  And what a shocker it is.

I would recommend this to anyone who likes movies with a twist. This movie is very accessible to non-French speakers because there aren't very many subtitles and the dialog isn't particularly complex. I watched this movie with my 30-year old husband, my 50-year old mother and my 15-year old sister and we all enjoyed it, so this movie good for a wide range of audiences.",1100736000,3,937,4.538461538461538
1473946,5,B00005JM48,"I would first like to start this review with a warning.  This is not a romantic comedy, as you would probably presume by looking at the cover of this box.  That is what I thought when I first discovered this ""gem"" of a film.  I picked it up to enjoy with my wife, and strangely, I found myself enjoying it more than her.

Without giving too much away (or more than already has by others), this is a twisted story where we, as viewers, have the opportunity to see the plot unfold from both of our main characters.  Audrey Tautou takes a devilishly good turn from her innocent character in Amelie to play an artist who falls in love ... or so we think.  As we watch her whirlwind romance with a married man hit their ups and downs like any normal relationship, we get comfortable and stable with the film ... then suddenly it changes.  We rewind backwards and are shown the story through the eyes of her ""boyfriend"".  Our image of this film enhances as we are handed the unexpected.

This was a beautiful film.  From not only the cinematography, but also the characters and the story.  This was a rarity.  It is not often that you find a film of this caliber in today's modern cinema.  Normally, films have a very structured story with its theme defined early within the film.  Not this masterpiece.  If you assume that you know this film prior to finishing it, then you will be the laughing stock of the town.  I have seen several films in my lifetime, and I can honestly say that I never saw this story unfolding.  I was one of those that expected the beginning to be the entire story ... boy, was I surprised.

Tautou carries this film on her bare shoulders.  She gives a stunning performance as a woman with a heart full of love for a man that she encounters.  Her turn from Amelie proves that she is a very versatile actor.  She emotionally pulls you from your seat and glues you to the screen.  Add to this the sheer brilliance of the story; with all of its twists and turns, and powerful cast that only accentuates Tautou's absurdity only helps propel this story from average to amazing.

This is one of those films that I can watch time and time again without it loosing its appeal.  I would suggest it for anyone that has ever had a secret admirer.  For anyone that has obsessed over anyone from afar, this is the film for you.  A-la Sliding Doors, this film was impressive.

1473947,3,B00005JM48,"I unintentionally followed the advice of at least one other reviewer on this page and saw this movie with absolutely no background knowledge of the movie's overall plot.  while the twist was much more visceral that way, I almost wish I hadn't.

basically, this is a three-part love story.  the first part seems to be building to a happy ending, and there's a definitive moment when your whole perception shifts--that's where the twist comes in.  while I agree that Audrey Tautou is terrific in her central role within this movie, I have to say I found the third part, the denoument, anticlimactic.  with such a memorable first section turned so abruptly over itself, I guess there was nowhere to go but down.

I would say the first two-thirds of the movie definitely work well enough to make the whole thing worth seeing.  but if you, like me, would rather have your movies a little more predictable (at least I'm not afraid to admit it), you might well consider going in forewarned.  the very last scene throws on a twist that would have been considered unnecessary in almost any genre of american movie, and while I admit that a french film dulled to suit the lowest common denominator seems horribly wrong, in a way this was worse.  to my mind, it was serving the classic cliche of not letting the movie end properly.

I'll give it credit for being suspenseful, and for turning a movie cliche on its head.  beyond that, I wasn't sure what to make of it (or that I would have seen it were it not in french, which I speak).  the final twist left me with a bad taste in my mouth that has yet to fade, but there are far worse movies out there, usually right in your own backyard's multiplex.",1095811200,4,1690,4.504918032786885
1473948,4,B00005JM48,"There are people in this world who can fool just about anyone.  That is what stands out from this film.  It took the Dr. quite some time to discover who was tormenting him, her friend never caught on, and at the end, she won.  One always hears of mentally sick people not taking their medicine . . . the physicians who expect that the medicine will be taken should be locked up.  They are professionals and should not be fooled.  A very good movie, which is credible and is terrible in what it has to say.",1093564800,,505,4.21875
1474015,4,B00005JM48,"In facial drama Audrey Tautou owns a controlling interest. While ""He Loves Me, He Loves Me Not"" is a romantic comedy that completely eludes and subverts expectations, Tautou plays right into them as an elfin, perky doer of progressively bad deeds, and thus does much of the eluding and subverting.

Tautou is Angelique, and the name doesn't just sound like ""Amelie;"" she's the same prototype: A cute, lonely, falsely chipper waitress prone to mysterious notes and objects of affection, in this case a cardiologist, Loic (Samuel Le Behan). And director Laetitia Colombani does indeed begin the film as a lighthearted, meet sweet romp through Paris. It is everything but.

Quickly - and directly - Angelique's motives begin to unravel. She claims to be having an affair with Loic, and she claims his wife, Rachel (Isabel Carre) is merely trying to ensnare him with a pregnancy. But Angelique seems more wishful than involved. Then wishful becomes obsessive. Then dangerous - when Loic fails to show at the airport for a getaway to Florence, Italy, Angelique is more than crushed, forcing her two best friends (Clement Sibony and Sophie Guillermin) into criminal compromises. A third through the film, after Angelique has caused enough damage for two or three fatal attractions, we see her committing suicide.

Then ""He Loves Me, He Loves Me Not"" does a daring, clever thing: It rewinds itself to the very beginning and shows all the same events from the perspective of Samuel, who, it becomes clear, does not really know Angelique. Nor does he know who is suddenly mailing him paintings and gifts. The movie's second half is not so much a revelation - although we learn how two events (Samuel's arrest and Rachel's miscarriage) came to occur - as an accumulating, suspensful dread. What a pox Angelique has put on this man's life.

The grinning, smirking villain, Tautou is excellent - as distraught here as she was resilient in ""Amelie."" A fine line separates the two characters and Tautou walks it, subtly changing her body language and trademark pouts beyond curiousity and playfulness. It is not reinvention but rearrangement, and it is as hard as method acting, and the mark of a star who can pull it off. Notice how Angelique sits - slumped, a knuckle resting immaturely between her open legs. Or her sudden smile-to-frown moments around Loic. Though we begin to suspect an unhealthy romance, Angelique's pathology resonates better in Samuel's section of the movie. Colombani could have only pulled off such a split structure with a memorable face to attach to Samuel's distress. Tautou is the girl.",1092355200,5,2603,5.0046189376443415
1474016,5,B00005JM48,"""He Loves Me...He Loves Me Not"" is a wonderful piece of misdirection by director Laetitia Colombani.  It starts all saccharine sweet with flowers, perky songs of Spring and love, and a smitten Audrey Tautou.
It's all a great head fake.  As the film turns slowly, inexhorably darker and more malevolent, you're faced with the reality that your sweet little Amelie maybe isn't what she appears to be in this outing.  It's a great against-the-tide career choice by Tautou and the masterstroke of the trap Ms. Colombani's sets for her audience.
Where Colombani's film elevates itself vs. others of this genre is in its unique, impressively designed story construction.  Others on these pages have alluded to the technique.  I'm not going to repeat it here.  It came as a surprise to me during my viewing, and it was like a special treat - my mouth dropped open suddenly as Colombani delivered her unexpected wallop.  Everyone deserves that pleasure.  I suggest you try to avoid extensive reading about this one before you take it in.  Your lack of preparation will be well-rewarded.",1088640000,4,1078,4.944444444444445

Little red hearts and roses dance all over the screen in the films opening credits. I thought with a smile, that I was in for a bit of fluffy romance. The lead female character Angelique was adorable and I just loved her on sight. Audrey Tautou played her perfectly and when things started to not go her way in the love affiar, I thought that she was a bit naive, but I genuinely felt bad for her....however, halfway into the movie, the entire story folds in on itself and rewinds to the opening scene only to follow her lover the cardiologist instead of Angelique,whom we stayed with the entire first half of the movie.
What an eye opener.
Suddenly, everything that you have belived is not so clear anymore and I found my self feeling more and more revolted as things came to light.

But beauty is what it is and sometimes it is what it isn't, be prepared to be taken on a surprising ride. Sometimes love takes on new meaning, especially for the young and easily influenced.

1474139,4,B00005JM48,"L, is for the way you look at me...
A La Folie...Pas Du Tout, or roughly translated, Madly...Not At All-- is one story but with two different POV's.  First, we see things from the point of view of lovable Angelique, an art student who's on the way up.  She's won the Hanska Scholarship to an art academy, which is a big foothold to gaining artistic fame.  She is also minding a large house for the Dubois-Lollins while they are off to Washington.  And yes, those charming smiles that won audiences heart when she did Amelie are in plain evidence here.  The song ""L.O.V.E."" by Nat King Cole, played as her song, is a soothing remedy for what lies ahead.
O. is for the only one I see...
However, she has a crush on a handsome blond cardiologist named Loic Le Garrec, who happens to be married to a lawyer.  She believes that he will leave her and marry her.  She seems oblivious to the attentions of fellow student David, who's in love with her and waiting in the wings.  According to her, she got a rose from him, which she sends him in memory of how they first met.  She keeps sending him notes, and also a birthday gift and makes dinner plans for his birthday, only to be stood up.  A dream trip to Florence ends up with her waiting at the aeroport till closing.  She's totally heartbroken and cuts back and forth between scenes of her running to exhaustion along the barred gate of his house to her angrily destroying photos, shredding a wedding dress, etc.  She is ready for a new start until something happens that brings back her feelings for him, and that takes her down a darker path.
V is very very extraordinary...
Well, from Angelique's POV, Loic is painted as quite a cad, someone who used and dumped her.  But from Loic's POV, we see a different picture of him, as he is a dedicated cardiologist who loves his wife Rachel.  He is however, beset by an unreliable receptionist Anita, who messes up his schedule among other things until she is fired and burned out by incessant patients complaining of heart maladies.  He is actually clueless to the situation: who sent him the rose, the notes, the present?  There are some things that neither she nor the viewer doesn't know about from her POV, but when the viewer sees them, it's an ""Oh, I see"" situation, where the gaps to the half-complete story is told.  And his wife is actually loving and devoted, though naturally suspicious, especially as the notes tell Loic that Rachel won't keep them apart.
Another technique that makes this film work wonders is the occasional brief loopbacks into the past that fill in missing information, which is a result of wrongly drawn conclusions, and other times, tarnishes Angelique's image.

E is even more than anyone that you adore...
Audrey Tautou is best known on these shores as Amelie.  Angelique is Amelie gone down a self-destructive path.  My mother, known my deep fondness for Amelie, told me stay away from this film lest the ideal I built around Tautou be crushed, yet I find her performance winning, making her a capable actress.  However, not much info is given on Angelique's childhood.  Apart from the Mr. Cat doll she made out of string, buttons, and fuzz, there isn't much to go on.  What else about her upbringing made her this way?
The quote shown at the ending not only reflects how Angelique felt but is a note of hope for those lonely romantics leaning towards self-destruction:  ""Though my love is insane, my reason calms the pain in my heart.  It tells me to be patient and keep hoping.""",1073260800,3,3511,4.5702875399361025

1474141,4,B00005JM48,"To reveal anything about the story would spoil the sensation you will get watching ""He Loves Me, He Loves Me Not.""  So, if you really like ""Amelie""'s Audrey Tautou, just watch it without bothering to read anything.  The film is a big surprise, betraying whatever you expect from charming Tautou in strikingly red clothes.
But if you need some information, let me call the film a ""Hitchcockian romance.""  Audrey plays Angelique, an aspiring art school student, who is in love with a handsome cardiologist Samuel Le Bihan.  One problem for Angelique is, he is married.  But she knows he is going to divorce ... but who can tell?
And suppose Angelique, as her name implies, is always pretty and engaging.  So winsome and lovely, she can convince anyone of anything.  Is that called charming?  Or manipulative?  The film traces very unpredictable course of events that started with a single flower of rose, and a little bit of imagination.  Also the film gives clever contrast or double meanings of 'heart,"" which would remain long in your memory.
Angelique is literally 'angelic,' or looks so.  Though the cast of Tautou is decided before the international hit of ""Amelie,"" her sweet image gives an unexpectedly uncanny and enticing power to this film, directed by Laetitia Colombani, herself an actress (and she is only 26 years old!).  ""He Loves Me..."" which came as the result of the reseach for the paper while she was in film school, became this promising feature debut film.
The film's conclusion may not satisfy everybody, and look overlong to some of us, but ""He Loves Me, He Loves Me Not"" is a thrilling experience of watching what a love can achieve with great efforts, or its bizarre and dark flip side.",1066176000,9,1711,4.821917808219178
1474142,5,B00005JM48,"I believe if I should die,
And you should kiss my eyelids when I lie

And, from its exile in the isles of death,

From Creed by Mary Ashley Townsend

When Plato said: ""Love is a grave mental illness,"" he might have been referring to obsessive love. The type of passion that turns you into a prisoner of your own desires. It is the type of passion that can an almost become a ""possessive force"" in your life, so strong, nothing else seems of importance in comparison to the object of your desires.

It is difficult to write about ""He Loves Me, He Loves Me Not,"" without revealing the sheer uniqueness of this fascinating movie. It will not only appeal to the detective in you, it is almost a study of obsessive love as a sport.

The story is set in the city of Bordeaux. French art student, Angelique (Audrey Tautou), is in love with Loc (Samuel LeBihan), who is a cardiologist. The director went out his way to connect Angelique's heartfelt longings for the doctor with his profession and also seems to have a deep understanding of Greek Mythology.

We find Angelique in love with Loc, a handsome man of high social status. She is in turn being loved by a younger man named David, who seems much more compatible. He is her obvious admirer and knight in shinning armor.

Her obsession with the older and more affluent Loic does not allow her to appreciate David's care and admiration. Instead, she seems to show an unsympathetic and almost careless attitude towards David as she also continues to show her loving, yet slightly vindictive side towards her ""true love."" Like many women who stay with men who treat them badly, Angelique seems to feed off Loc's abuse. Or is he really the abuser?

When Angelique receives an art scholarship she is told she will have to follow the rules and create 15 paintings. However, the only thing she seems to want to create are paintings of Loc. The word ""mosaic"" takes on new meanings. The main problem with their ""relationship"" is that Loc is married and his wife is pregnant. As Angelique writes a warning across Loc's car windshield, we start to realize the darkness of her obsession. She has a very evil side and while we want to love this mischievous little creature, we realize she is a danger, even to herself.

When her small income from her waitressing job does not allow her to shower her true love with presents, she starts to find other ways of feeding her obsession. Her love grows to such proportions, she is finally willing to steal to show Loc the depth of her love.

The visual metaphors are worth looking for and contemplating on future viewings. Feeling ""devastated,"" ""uprooted,"" and ""unsettled"" are presented as the outer representation of Angelique's inner world. If you loved Amelie, this movie has much to offer. There are unique moments of stunning beauty, like the storm at the airport symbolizing the inner torment Angelique is feeling. There are also subtle undercurrents and even when a moped and a bike start at the same time and move in different directions, there is a deeper meaning.

Look at how ""the angel Angelique"" becomes Eros when she puts an arrow through a heart. Yet, instead of rising from Chaos into a situation of unconditional love on the light side, she seeks to create more destruction and enters the dark hallways of unrequited love. While she strives for the ""the pure, the good and the beautiful,"" her love takes on a much more sinister aspect. She not only desires, she seeks to control this world she has created.

Even if there was no story at all, I could watch Audrey Tautou in a trance. She is just fascinating in the same way Audrey Hepburn's screen presence can keep your attention for hours. I kept forgetting to watch the subtitles and spent a lot of time rewinding! Audrey Tautou has a magic that is all her own and her radiance takes all forms. One moment she is dreamily peering out from behind hundreds of roses and then I was surprised at the rather demonic look in her eyes as she peers through the blue gate. She seems to excel in roles displaying the vulnerability of love and near insanity of unrequited love.

""He Loves Me, He Loves Me Not"" is a story of a young girl's infatuation with an older man, yet there is a more subtle erotic and vindictive twist. This movie turns from romance to thriller in the most intriguing way. The cinematic beauty is a visual paradise and the metaphors, dark comedy and detective work will intrigue your mind. This is a thriller, a comedy and a romance.

A must-see for all Audrey Tautou fans! If you loved ""The Others,"" this movie will also intrigue you. Throughout the movie, Tautou seems to mostly be wearing a ruby top and purple pants. She is often set against red backgrounds with red couches and the colors in this movie are just stunning. She looks lovely trying on a wedding dress or just looking through travel brochures. I am impressed with every moment of her acting.

I am only left wondering if a few capsules of DL-Phenylalanine could have prevented such agony of the soul or was Angelique's search for the ""love high"" the very cause of her fantasy or ""divine"" madness? Only one man has the key to Angelique's heart. Laetitia Colombani has created a journey that will keep your attention right to the end... twice!

Angelique waits patiently and anxiously on the sidelines while his marriage deteriorates and he comes to claims her. While the audience is treated to what appears to be a typical romance during the first half of this film, the movie is suddenly rewound and an entirely new perspective on the same events is revealed. Multiple perspectives lead to new viewpoints.
HE LOVES ME, HE LOVES ME NOT is a smart thriller movie which certainly caught me by surprise. When I rented this DVD I didn't expect to be treated with a film that delved deeper than a French romance, and I didn't expect to be fooled. Highly recommended.",1064188800,23,932,4.620481927710843

In the beginning, Audrey Tatou is picking out a rose for her boyfriend in a florist.  It then goes on to show her days, sometimes elated and sometimes disappointed by her distant, married cardiologist boyfriend.  She sends him gifts, he stands her up.  They plan a weeklong trip, and he leaves her at the airport.  When he and his wife finally DO split up, she is elated, but he is unfortunately pining for his wife.  She decides her life is over, and turns on the gas.  As soon as her heart stops beating though, the whole movie rewinds and starts from square one.
All of a sudden, everything you saw from her point of view is seen from his, and it's so different than what you'd expect.  This shocking movie goes on to reveal a dark side of the characters, and a strangely sinister plot.  Once your mind gets wrapped around what's really going on, you cannot wait to see what happens.  This is not at all a fluffy romance, but more of a mind-bender (think Vanilla Sky) and actually quite suspenseful and emotional.

1474226,4,B00005JM48,"""He Loves Me, He Loves Me Not"" is a clever French film that begins as a romance and ends up as a thriller. I personally like this kind of story, in which nothing you see at the beginning is what it seems. [The most famous example, perhaps, is Alfred Hitchcock's ""Vertigo""] While this movie might prove too deceptive and cynical [or even a bit cruel] for some viewers, I think it wll prove rewarding for those who like films that `think outside the box'.
The movie begins much like any standard romance. Angelique [Audrey Tautou], a promising young artist, is madly in love with Loic [Samuel Le Bihan], a successful cardiologist. She sends some flowers and a painting she did to his office to show her affections. She is house sitting for a family who has gone away for a year. Her life seems almost perfect until it dawns on her that the doctor doesn't keep the promises he makes to her - he doesn't show up for dates, he refuses to leave his wife, etc. Slowly, she sinks into a depression. She later plots her revenge against her `unfaithful' man. But what is really going on between these two? To say more would be to ruin the story.
Tautou is the French actress who charmed audiences around the world a while back as ""Amelie"". Here, she proves she is more than a big smile, wide eyes and an odd hairdo; in fact, she looks completely different. She is a most accomplished actress. Samuel Le Bihan is first rate as the object of her affection.
The movie is in French with English subtitles. These do not bother me in the least, but I am well aware that some people refuse to watch a movie in a foreign language. I say that that's their loss.",1061683200,5,1642,4.404605263157895
1474227,4,B00005JM48,"The opening credits and the first half of this French film lead us to believe that wea re in for a bit of fluff, French style.  The wonders of love/exhilaration/infatuation/madness...aha....the movie bifurcates!  Audrey Tautou is a terrific screen presence as a gifted young artist and her wholly committed love for a cardiologist well-paced by Samuel Le Bihan is a joy to watch.  At the peak of a love affair the movie rewinds to give us the other viewpoint of the story.  At this point the bed of roses approach becomes very dark and while the film is still excellent, it is not at all what the promos would suggest.  Worth a watch in your home.  The DVD is a good one.",1061078400,8,671,4.5041322314049586
1474228,4,B00005JM48,"When I was sitting in the theater watching this film, I thought to myself: ""Jeez!  If I wanted to see a Julia Roberts romance I would have gone to the multiplex!""  The film's first third plays as a sappy love story.  I was groaning in my seat.
Then something magical happens.  The film ""rewinds"" and plays the same scenario over again -- from the ""boyfriend's"" point of view.  Ahhhh.
There is more to this film than meets the eye.  A sort of French modern-day ROSHOMAN, HE LOVES ME, HE LOVES ME NOT is ultimately a thought-provoking and entertaining film.  It's plot-reversal keeps you on your toes and plays with the idea of perspective.
Audrey Tautou and Samuel Le Bihan are very good in their roles; you get a chance to hate then feel sorry for them depending on which version of the story the film is portraying.
Enjoy it, enjoy it not.",1058486400,2,840,4.4868421052631575
1474229,3,B00005JM48,"Audrey Tatou: the pretty,the cute, gets a chance to play psycho in this fun little thriller.
The basic premise: Tatou plays a young woman in love with a married man, we watch her pine for him, ultimately leading to a horrible, dark depression - and a sick desire to protect him at all costs.  Then, the film rewinds and we see everything from her lover's (or is he?) point of view.  What is fresh and beautifully filmed turns a bit cliched and played out by the end.
I still recommend it, it's fun to watch that sweet Amelie smile hold something entirely new behind it, just don't expect anything new in the ending, unless, that is, you've never seen a thriller before.",1055116800,2,669,4.475409836065574
1474230,5,B00005JM48,"This is a psyco movie. Haven't seen such kind of ""twisted"" movie. The stories from both sides like the zippers that tie prefectly. Tautou has shown her innocent in the first half but psyco in the second part. A typical French movie will end after the first part to let you to think about the relationship of the character, the background.
Many critics or reviewers compare Audrey Tautou to Audrey Hepturn. It is unfair to them. They are so different! If I had to point out some common point, I can only say that they provide happiness to people. Hepturn was a princess, she shown people what is elegant, beautiful and is everybody's dream girl. Tautou is different, she is innocent, cutie, and likes an angel from heaven to make people happy. I would not think of Tautou as my dream girl, would you?",1048982400,,799,4.555555555555555

1474232,4,B00005JM48,"This movie opened a perspective on the power of love which is both refreshing and terrifying. What you assumed about a relationship between 2 people is merely skin deep. I loved the way the story unfolded. The audience is brought into a comfort zone, awaiting for the 'cinderella feeling' to once again fill their senses as the movie opens in what seems like a typical romantic style. Little do they know that after 30-45 min of romantic bliss, this cleverly directed movie will unfurl into a psychotic thriller that is truly distrubing and frightening.",1045958400,,553,4.8936170212765955
1474233,5,B00005JM48,"OH I love Audrey Tautou!  She is so cute!  And she doesn't disapoint me one bit in this movie!

1474234,4,B00005JM48,"Audrey Tatou has a smile that could melt anyone's heart, and even when she plays an obsessed psychotic, you can't help but fall in love with her (even if her antics scare you to death). Tatou plays Anjelique, a French student who thinks she is in love with a married doctor, Loic (Samuel Le Bihan of ""Brotherhood of the Wolf""), whose wife (Isabelle Carre) is pregnant. The first half of the story follows Angelique's attempts to get Loic to leave his wife and run away with her to Florence. When she is stood up, Anjelique begins to go a bit ""nuts"". Then, the perspective shifts, and we see the previous events through Loic's eyes, and the story seems quite different, as we see Angelique's ""love"" more strongly resembling a dangerous obsession.
An edge-of-the-seat thriler with touches of light comedy and numbing romance, ""He Loves Me, He Loves Me Not"" is the perfect vehicle for Tatou. She has a wicked glint in her angelic eyes that usually read as something mischievous but, in a darker context, can be extremely unsettling.
The film begins as lightly as a bubbly French farce, but abruptly turns into a scary essay of madness and murder, with Tautou at its deadly center. Everything depends on whether Angelique is actually involved with Loic or is a prisoner of her own delusions. The second part of the film replays many of the events we've already seen, but from Loic's perspective, which is quite different from Angelique's. For him, there is no affair, nothing but a sometimes pesky little neighbor he barely knows, part of a life now puzzlingly falling apart.
Which is the truth? By the end, director Laetitia Colombani clearly reveals what's going on. But she also demonstrates how dreams can consume us and quickly take over our reality.
This is a surprisingly smart, engrossing and ambitious film by a first time director that displays superstar Tautou's gifts in an eerie new light and brims with intense suspense. Not as scary or funny as it could have been, but a truly enjoyable thriller that had me captivated from first frame to last. ""He Loves Me, He Loves me Not,"" plays like a French ""Fatal Attraction,"" with a few bonus twists and surprises. Tatou and Le Bihan have great on-screen chemistry, turning this charming romance into a mind-numbing psychological puzzler.",1045440000,7,2290,4.844387755102041
1474235,3,B00005JM48,"I saw this movie in the theater here in the US. The movie is over all worht seeing, it's full of nice twists and innovative approch to direction and movie writing. The story it self is not novel, it's just a regular man-woman relationship. However, the approach the director uses is pretty original and captivating. When watching this movie you have to be patient, cause you might think it's just another love story between a pervert man and his submissive mistress, however, if you are patient enough you would be pleasantly surprised. I have to mention also that despite the nice, innovative directorship approach, there were many flaws with the story line and some times it didn't even make sense.
Finally, I have to give two thumbs up to the sound track, I personally thought it was awsome.",1045440000,2,794,4.760869565217392
