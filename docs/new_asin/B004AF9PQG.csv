8420109,5,B004AF9PQG,"I remember seeing this show on our local PBS station years ago.  I thought it was funny then.  Was so happy to see that I could get it on DVD (once I discovered the joy of owning a multi-region DVD player).  The show's characters are hilarious, and the plots are outrageous.  Very enjoyable show.",1371859200,,296,4.425925925925926
