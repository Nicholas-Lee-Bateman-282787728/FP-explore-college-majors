To all of you people celebrating because you think you've won some kind of human rights victory:  You haven't.  All you've achieved is censorship and the deletion of history.  History needs to be studied for what it was.  How can anyone learn from history if that history has been deleted?  It is a crime against humanity to alter history.

Well, it reminds me of my younger days. But the real reason is that it ticks off the PC crowd.

This show isn't racist. Probably a little cornball. People these days get offended over anything everything is either racist or you are prejudiced.
Whatever... bite me and grow a pair. This show was entertaining and had  moral character more then I can say about most folks I know. in the time of 1979 to 1985 I left my apartment open and my  car door unlocked and half the time I was  forgetting my stuff at other peoples houses or  at Jims coffee shop in  Boise  Needless to say  I always got my stuff back and felt safe. Today if you left your doors unlocked you would get robbed blind and people would tell you u got what you deserved for putting  trust in people and leaving your vehicles unlocked. Progress and the new morality isn't always a good thing.

The irony is Warner has now admitted they have profited from racism for decades and never cared. They let the flag fly on the Charger because of greed instead of ethics.... BUT, I say the flag was there because nobody ever considered it a symbol of hate or racism. When the Dukes began in 1980, we had political correctness back then. TV producers were going out of their way to put Black actors in their shows. To attack preceived White Actors, with shows like Archie Bunker and the Jeffersons. You can bet if the flag represented what they claim it does today, CBS would have NEVER used it at all. They did because it didn't. It is only recently that we allowed bigots to change the definition of the flag so they can continue their crusade against any sort of Americana.

Every episode is worth watching.  There are tons of action, comedy, and car chases in this series.  Nothing can beat this classic!

2039744,4,B0001WTWXI,"I was 57 days old when ""One Armed Bandits"" aired, and my parents each recall me watching the show from my playpen.  I remember spending many an afternoon during the summer of 1996 watching re-runs on TNN, and I didn't care when they cycled back around so the show is fairly well etched in my memory after all these years.  In fact, I was surprised at how sharply I could recall lines of dialog from ""Limo One Is Missing"" (one of my favorite episodes in the entire series).  You have to know going into the show that you're going to get some relatively tame storytelling with more than a kernel of cornball.  It can be deterring, but I found the charm of the show transcended those elements and that the fun spirit still comes across all these years later.  It's probably worth noting that I watched most of this box set in the course of the last 15 hours, in between frequent and painful trips to the bathroom.  Stupid Crohn's disease!

That first season was a bit rough around the edges, and might raise an eyebrow among more casual viewers.  There are references to prostitution in a few episodes, and even Bo and Luke partake in beers at the Boars Nest (in later seasons, they'd never actually have a drink).  Boss Hogg and Sheriff Rosco P. Coltrane aren't quite the out-and-out buffoons that they became, either.  Sorrell Booke is rather imposing in his way, and while everyone's eyes were always on the lovely Catherine Bach I think I finally saw this time around that it was James Best who stole the show.  I found myself empathizing with the career law officer whose pension was taken away by public vote.  When you're watching from your playpen, things like that don't quite resonate.

As for the DVD release, I despise flipper discs and it's rather puzzling that Warner Bros. felt the need to split up 13 episodes on three flippers here (especially since there's nothing on the B side of Disc 3!).  I had a problem getting Disc 2 Side B to read, but eventually got it going.  Some of the a/v quality is suspect, but I do believe it's as good as these now-32 year old episodes are ever going to look and sound.  There's only one commentary track to be found, but it's a delight to hear actors John Schneider and Catherine Bach watch ""One Armed Bandits"" together and reminisce.  Schneider in particular did his homework, and keeps the commentary moving with trivia and insight.  The rest of the features include a 30 minute cast reunion (minus the deceased Booke and Denver Pyle, and the conspicuously absent Tom Wopat) trading stories, which is fairly enjoyable.  A brief clip of assorted NASCAR drivers commenting on the show is pretty thin, and the only other feature is a trailer for&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dukes-of-Hazzard-Return-of-the-General-Lee/dp/B000228EQ8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dukes of Hazzard: Return of the General Lee</a>&nbsp;video game.

That's one thing I like about this show and I think you'll love about it too. I will tell you now. DO NOT listen to these people who have gave this a low rating. Those people apparently have no taste in tv. who cares what they think. I'm sure when you watch this, you'll think more differently than they do.

My favorite episode is Luke's Love Story. Luke shows his strong complicated side.
As an adult, I still love to watch it to escape. Yes the plots are predictable, but it was about these anti heroes with a sweet car,who stuck it to the bad guys.
If you are a man, and don't get turned on by Daisy in her bikini,something is wrong for you.

I love the first and second Season. The scenery is so pretty. Sheriff roscoe is more of a corrupt cop that was stiffed out of his pension. I preferred him that way. Cooter is more of a wide eyed devil than in later episodes.(he stoled the president's car) I hated when they had the Coy and Vance replacements stand in,that ruined the show.

When I first put in the disc, it had been about 20 years since I had seen an episode.  When I saw the General Lee tearing down a dirt road, it was like seeing an old friend.  While fashion sure has changed since then, the sense of fun and adventure is still there.  I nearly jumped out of my chair when I saw the General Lee jump a creek and yelled out a loud ""yeehaw""!  If you have any fond memories of watching this show when you were younger, I'd definitely recommend picking it up.

Here is a little summery about it Bo and Luke Duke, two cousins living in an unincorporated area of the fictional Hazzard County, Gerogia, racing around in their modified 1969 Dodge Charger, the Genral Lee evading corrupt Boss Hogg and his inept county sheriff Rosco P. Coltrane Bo and Luke had been sentenced to probation for illegal transportation of moonshine- Uncle Jesse usually made the run, but had fallen ill, and on the very occasion that Bo and Luke had taken his place, they were caught. Jesse made a plea bargain to stop brewing moonshine in return for the boys to forgo jail time and instead be placed on probation.

If I give this series a rateing I would give it a 10. If you like this series you will like The Waltons.",1207612800,2,892,4.406060606060606
2039774,5,B0001WTWXI,"This was my favorite season of the DUKES OF HAZZARD throughout the Dukes whole 7-year run on CBS as well as the season that made this show a big hit back in 1979 when the General Lee was practically brand spankin new and when Enos Strate(Sonny Shroyer) was Sheriff Rosco's fellow deputy for the first time before Enos even got replaced by Boss Hogg's cousin Deputy Cletus Hogg(Rick Hurst) along with the fact that this season shows you how the ongoing dilemma that the Dukes had with the corrupt Hazzard County Sheriff Rosco Coltrane(Jim Best), the greedy scheming corrupt police commisioner Boss Hogg(Sorrell Booke), and Enos got started on top of that.

The 1st Season of The Dukes was also funnier than the rest of the seasons of this show reminds me of the days when the DUKES OF HAZZARD  was an over-the-top series that was on CBS every Friday night at 9PM right after the INCREDIBLE HULK at 8PM, plus the DUKES OF HAZZARD was followed by DALLAS at 10PM in addition to CBS's Friday night line-up back then, which gave me at least 2 more things to look forward to every Friday night.

In addition, this takes me all the way back to memory lane when THE DUKES OF HAZZARD first came out on CBS for the first time back in January of 1979 and was shown at the same time slot as THE ROCKFORD FILES when Rockford was part of NBC's Friday night line-up, which gave the ROCKFORD FILES a little bit of competition against the DUKES OF HAZZARD, since Rockford started getting a slight dip in the ratings when the Dukes came along, since a lot of people found the DUKES OF HAZZARD preferable to the ROCKFORD FILES, despite the fact that this season of the Dukes was only an abbreviated season.

Because for one thing, the DUKES OF HAZZARD was a lot funnier than the ROCKFORD FILES was, since the DUKES OF HAZZARD was like a comedy drama show, but the ROCKFORD FILES was a private detective drama show that was a lot more serious with a lot less humor even though it was usually kind of funny whenever Rockford got busted and/or in trouble, especially by his sleazy ex-con buddy Angel Martin(Stuart Margolin)& when Rockford got his often exasperated cop buddy Det. Dennis Becker(Joe Santos)from the LAPD on a back-burner with his superior officers which were the overzealous Lt. Diehl(Tom Atkins)and the disgruntled Lt. Chapman(James Luisi).

For another, the DUKES OF HAZZARD had a lot more car chases than the ROCKFORD FILES had, plus the car chases on the Dukes were more interesting and more impressive than they were on Rockford on top of that.

For another, the General Lee had outclassed Rockford's flashy bronze Firebird.

For another, Bo and Luke Duke(John Schneider, Tom Wopat) were eyecandy that were also a lot younger, spunkier, and more attractive than the often festidious private investigator Jim Rockford(James Garner) was, despite the fact that the ROCKFORD FILES had enough sufficient ratings for a full Sixth Season on NBC for the following year, even though the DUKES OF HAZZARD K.O.'d the ROCKFORD FILES in the Nielsen ratings, which reminds me that I started watching Rockford less and less when the Dukes came out, since the time slot for the DUKES OF HAZZARD on CBS kind of interferred with the time slot for the ROCKFORD FILES on NBC, not that I didn't like Rockford anymore, despite the fact that the DUKES OF HAZZARD nearly beat the ROCKFORD FILES to a pulp during Rockford's last 2 seasons.

Unfortunately the ROCKFORD FILES started losing a lot of viewers from the DUKES OF THE HAZZARD when the Dukes made their debut on CBS in the Winter of 1979 which initially led to Rockford getting a slight decrease in the ratings and to the ROCKFORD FILES cancellation on NBC in the Winter of 1980, which was a year after the DUKES OF HAZZARD made its debut on CBS, but the ROCKFORD FILES was cancelled due to James Garner developing chronic back and knee problems, not because of low ratings.

Therefore you could say that Bo and Luke Duke were peaking while Rockford(James Garner) was creaking since John Schneider(Bo) & Tom Wopat(Luke)were both very young with lots of energy left in them while James Garner was reaching a saturation point with his Rockford character heading over-the-hill losing his spunk & his edge since age caught up with Garner causing him to run out of gas when the DUKES OF HAZZARD premiered on CBS on Friday January 26, 1979.

Therefore you could say that the Dukes were killing Rockford since Garner got too ill & ran out of steam when the DUKES OF HAZZARD came along while the Dukes were soaring big time in the ratings with lots of steam left ahead on  the DUKES OF HAZZARD since the Dukes were just starting its honeymoon phase of the show while Rockford's honeymoon phase was already long gone along with the fact that you could tell Rockford was getting tired by huffing & puffing away, plus he was obviously dragging along & started limping more and more in the last 2 seasons of the ROCKFORD FILES as opposed to the Duke boys humming along swiftly with no ailments at all.

As a matter of fact, it just so happens that Sorrell Booke(Boss Hogg) had a guest starring role on the ROCKFORD FILES in ""The Jersey Bounce"" episode as Rockford's appointed attorney(Wade Ward).

It was also intriguing seeing
*Joann Pflug in the ""Route 711"" episode before her days as Colt Seavers often skeptical agent(Big Jack) on THE FALL GUY

*Colby Chester in the ""Mary-Kaye's Baby"" episode before his co-starring days on THE YOUNG & THE RESTLESS and TRAPPER JOHN M.D.

*Dennis Haskins in the ""One Armed Bandits"" episode before his co-starring days as Mr. Belding on SAVED BY THE BELL

*Jeannie Wilson in the ""Mary Kaye's Baby"" episode before her co-starring days as Rick and AJ's attorney friend(Janet Fowler) on SIMON & SIMON

*Mary Jo Catlett in the ""Swamp Molly"" episode before her co-starring days as Pearl on DIFFERENT STROKES

*Charles Cyphers in the ""Limo One Is Missing"" during his earlier acting days in John Carpenter flicks like HALLOWEEN, THE FOG, and ESCAPE FROM NEW YORK

*David Hayward in the ""Luke's Love Story"" episode before his co-starring days on ALL MY CHILDREN

*Del Monroe in the ""Limo One Is Missing"" episode after his co-starring days on VOYAGE TO THE BOTTOM OF THE SEA

*Paul Brinegar in the Route 711"" episode before his co-starring days on MATT HOUSTON

This season also takes me all the way back to memory lane when CBS's motto was ""Turn Us On"", since that was the motto on CBS from the Fall of 1978 thru the Summer of 1979.

It did remind me of a simpler time when just silly fun was funny. This is far better than alot of the tv on today. The good guys are GREAT and the BAD guys like BOSS and Sheriff Rasco are too funny not to be loveable. This is good clean fun if you can keep your mind off Daisy Duke who was the cats meow in her time. Waylon Jennings narration was a perfect ingredient too these weekly adventures. I suppose the series antics might have got old after several seasons. But i got season one and enjoyed it very much.

A tip for all people who loves the show as much as I do:If you really are a fan of the original TV show ""The Dukes of Hazzard"" than go and watch John 'Bo Duke` Schneider`s new movie ""Collier & Co - Hot Pursuit"" which is currently running in a couple of cinemas for only a short time.

Also, Boss Hogg didn't have the padded outfit and was his ""natural size.""

  Other than that, the show was the the same as the other characters ironed out their roles and became very comfy pretty much from the get go. There was more ""anti-hero"" from the Duke Boys before later seasons where they followed the law by the book. A very underrated episode was ""The Big Heist"" where there were some dare I say...unpredictable turns throughout the 48 minutes.

Secondly, I find myself laughing my backside off reading posts that seem to indicate that I'm a racist because I like this show.  For those that think the Confederate flag represents slavery, I suggest you go back and LEARN some history and discover the real reasons the civil war was fought.  Yes, slavery was one item, but primarily it was fought over state's rights.  And Reviewer MIKE from NY, do some research before you make statements, you will look much smarter if you do.  The KKK was not created by General Lee, he was actually a proponent of ending slavery.

The Ku Klux Klan was formed by a group of Confederate Army veterans in Pulaski, Tennessee around 1865. A Confederate General, Nathan Bedford Forrest, was the Klan's first leader, whose title was the Grand Wizard. The group adopted the name Ku Klux Klan from the Greek word kuklos, meaning circle, and the English word clan.

Who wouldn't want cousins who could teach you to change the oil in your car, do spins and go ""jukin'"", all without breaking a sweat? :-) I also liked first season Rosco the best..he was a straight-arrow sheriff for 20 years who became bitter over losing his pension, and resorted to recouping what was rightfully his in any way he could. Boss was also much more believable as a corrupt official- the Boss Tweed of the Deep South, and much more formidable an opponent than he became later on- sly, cunning, and almost totally lacking in moral fiber. For that matter, Bo and Luke were much more believable as two guys on probation, who if not for the wise, guiding hand of their Uncle Jesse could have turned their talents in quite a different direction altogether. The episodes had plot and direction, and Boss and Rosco were NOT easy to outfox.

 The series aired between 1979-1985,and was the show for the younger crowd. Even twenty five year later and a newer generation it still holds up well with it's likable characters(non are stereotypical rednecks),heavy comic elements, and some of the best stunt driving to air on TV.
 Based on Moonrunners,a 1975 movie which elements the show was based on, The show followed the adventures of Boegarde ""Bo"" Duke (John Schnider) the reckless younger cousin, and Lukas ""Luke"" Duke (Tom Wopat) the older brainier cousin who fights the system against crooked Boss Hogg (Sorrell Booke) who practically runs Hazzard county, and his bumbling lackey Sherriff Roscoe P. Coltraine (the great James Best), who also stops at nothing from pinning any crimes or Hogg's schemes on the Dukes. Also featured is the boys cousin Daisy (the still sexy Cathrine Bach),their uncle Jesse (the late great denver Pyle) a former moonshine runner who honorably quits in exchange for the boys being on probation when they're caught running shine themselves. Ben Jones also stars as Cooter Davenport,the town mechanic and friend of the Dukes, and Sonny Shroyer as loveable deputy Enos Strate who is the moral center of Boss and Roscoe. The other star of the show,especially to young kids and car enthusiast is The general Lee, an orange souped up 1969 Dodge Charger which the boys drive as well as a pop culture icon( and a center of controversy thanks to the confederate flag on it's roof).
 Premering as a mid season replacement,the 13 episode first season featured some strong episodes (One-arm Bandit, High Octane, Swamp Molly, Luke's Love Story, and Money to Burn) and wasn't as silly and slapstick as later episodes.",1126396800,6,1915,5.06984126984127

It has action, drama, comedy, stunts, fun and laughter for all the family. This first season has some clever plots and storylines and the fine actors of this TV show make them all so entertaining.

I'm very happy with the picture quality of all 13 episodes, which is more or less the same as other TV shows on DVD from the late 70s and 80s. You've never seen ""The Dukes of Hazzard"" episodes look so sharp and of high quality. They've also placed chapter marks after the opening credits and in other convenient places, and thankfully they include the ""teasers"" before the opening credits of each episode.

The extras are great, especially the cast gathering. John ""Bo"" Schneider and Cathy ""Daisy"" Bach do commentary for the first episode ""One Armed Bandit"" and you learn alot of trivia whilst listening to them. It's one of the best DVD commentary's I've ever heard. I also learnt quite a lot about ""The Dukes of Hazzard"" which I didn't know before watching the cast talk about the show.

All in all, 5 stars for ""The Dukes of Hazzard"" season 1 DVD box set. You'll love it! I can't wait to have all seven seasons on DVD of this all-time best show. As Rosco would say ""I love it, I love it ! kew kew kew !""

I used to love this show as a kid - tho that was so long ago I wasn't sure if I'd remember it. I have a few memories of a couple of shows, but only two from season one jogged a few memories but by the end of the episode I felt like I'd seen it for the first time. So I feel like I'm watching a brand new show for the first time and tho I don't see it the same as I do when I was a youngin' I can surely say I am still a fan of the show.

I don't think there is a kid alive from the 70's and 80's and who didn't wanna either be in the passenger seat of either Kitt or the General Lee. It's a show that has good morels and good intentions. It's such a shame that some morons have to put it down because of what the flag painted on the car represented back in the ancient times, but never once has the show EVER promoted ANY thing racial, distasteful, discriminating or offensive. It's a real shame that those morons dismiss a show and never watched it - `cause they probably would have been a better person if they where taught some of uncle Jessie's methods who wouldn't stand for anything illegal or dishonest. So let those morons concentrate some paint patterns to be their decision maker and prevent them from learning from a great show and respecting a true classic American series.

There is not many bonus features. There is a 30-minute (""Give or take a few a minutes, I don't have a watch"") reunion BBQ that I think was in 2004. Not all the cast are there (besides the ones who have passed away) Tom Wopat (Luke) isn't there for some reason. I don't get why they don't keep in touch, they only made a couple of reunion movies a few years ago, yet they act like they haven't seen each other in 20 years. And there is a ""high octane"" thing of a bunch of Nascar driver's who talk about being inspired by the DOH series. (We didn't get the video game preview, but I think I think I can go on living knowing that :)

2039868,5,B0001WTWXI,"In the late 70's and early 80's, television viewers fell in love with The Dukes of Hazzard, a weekly foray into the fictional setting of Hazzard County, Georgia. Cousins Bo and Luke Duke (John Schneider and Tom Wopat) spent each episode trying to do good, while the loveable ""Boss"" Hogg (Sorrell Booke) concocted various schemes for making money and having the Duke boys (who always foiled his plans) thrown in jail for violating their probation (the result of a deal with the federal government to end the centuries-old Duke family tradition of bootlegging).

Joining Bo and Luke are their Uncle Jesse (Denver Pyle), a grandfatherly figure who owns the family farm, and Cousin Daisy (Catherine Bach), whose skimpy shorts coined the cultural term ""daisy dukes"". Along with ""Crazy"" Cooter (Ben Jones), the local mechanic, they create a formidable threat to the money-making shenanigans of Sheriff Rosco P. Coltrane (James Best) and the owner of seemingly every business entity in Hazzard County, ""Boss"" Hogg.

But critics will argue that the true star of the show was the General Lee, Bo and Luke's bright orange Dodge race car with the Confederate flag pasted on its roof...

The Dukes of Hazzard (Season 1) DVD provides a number of famous episodes, including the very episodes which provided each video clip for the opening sequence of the show. With Waylon Jennings's weekly narrations as ""The Balladeer"" (performing artist of the show's legendary, chart-topping theme song), The Dukes of Hazzard provides hours of family-friendly programming as Boss and Roscoe match wits with the Duke clan...

2039879,5,B0001WTWXI,"The Dukes were a weekly treat for any child in the 70's/80's.  It is great to have these shows to watch now as an adult, and know they're still great.  Dukes is a family show, which I am thankful when you see what's on TV these days.  The good ol' boys still rock!  These DVD's will take you back to a moment in your childhood you probably will not want to leave.",1113868800,3,363,4.0
2039880,5,B0001WTWXI,This is a fun set.  We watch one episode every night with your sons and they love the car chases and stunts.  And I forgot how funny Roscoe was.  It's campy but that's what makes it fun.  The color is great and the sound is ok...just turn it up a bit louder.  Over all a great set to own!,1112054400,3,288,3.8135593220338984
2039881,4,B0001WTWXI,"The Dukes of Hazard was a great show in the first season, but I never liked it much after that.  The bad-guys became too stupid, especially when Roscoe started carrying that dog around all the time.  But in the first season, you did get the sense that the Duke boys actually had some formidable opponents, and Boss and Roscoe were corrupt rural politicians smart enough to fleece the whole county unless the Dukes saved the day.

The episodes in the first season had good plots, real dirty schemes by Boss & co. and good action scenes (more than just car chases some real a few barroom brawls are involved).  Mindless entertainment of course, but still good entertainment.

I was about 11 or 12 when the series started, and remember the impact it made on us kids (especially in the rural parts of the US like where I grew up).  And Daisy's legs were the first pair of female limbs I ever became obsessed with.......

But after the first season, the show really slumped, dumbed down and becamse the same formula over and over again. It never recaptured the free spiritedness of those first 13 episodes.  What a shame.

I recommend highly the first season, but wouldn't spend more than 5 bucks on a collection of any subsequent season.",1111363200,2,1233,4.6192660550458715
2039882,5,B0001WTWXI,"I've watched complete season dvd's come out for show after show that didn't have nearly the cultural effect that the Dukes of Hazard had in it's day (I bet you never saw a Cheers lunch box or Sam Malone on a poster!).  Thankfully we finally get to enjoy one of the best shows ever put out!

The first season is an interesting one in that you'll notice a couple things that may take you by surprise.  First, the surroundings.  The first few shows were taped in Georgia (not far from Atlanta) so downtown Hazard on a few car chases will look different from the Hazard shown in the remainder of the series.  The second thing you'll notice is a ""smart"" Sheriff Rosco P. Coltrane.  As you watch the first season you'll notice him changing more and more into the character that we all know and love from the second season to the final episodes of the show.  Boss Hogg's character starts to take on the life that we're more used to as well.  As the shows go on you'll notice him eating more and more often with the helpings getting bigger and bigger.

A special treat for the guys, one of the first episodes is also the famous Daisy bikini show that is on the intro during the rest of the series.

Overall, the first season is a must have to set the stage for the rest of the series.  I, personally, found it very fun and interesting to watch the characters develope and of course, the sotry lines are great and full of fun as well.",1109030400,19,1425,4.299625468164794
2039883,3,B0001WTWXI,"Decent box set, although this show is not as good as I remember. Corny, overacted 70's characters (especially the girls who guest star). The volume is way too low, the picture good. Obvious overdubbing from the original dialogue in at least one episode. Nice to have overall, though. I recall (as a kid) liking the 2nd season too, but after that, it was all downhill.",1107820800,6,367,4.661538461538462
2039884,5,B0001WTWXI,"I watched the Dukes every Friday night when I was little, and I loved it.  It's so much fun getting to watch it again.  It seems that's how most people feel about it, but it's worth repeating.  And the ""extras"" on the disc are fun too - there's a 20 year cast reunion and a commentary by John Schneider and Catherine Bach on Episode one.

And, like many others have also said, John Schneider was one of my first crushes as well (Randolph Mantooth was the very first, though).  This DVD set brings back a lot of memories!",1107561600,5,520,4.26530612244898

2039886,5,B0001WTWXI,"This is an amazing dvd boxed set of one of the best television shows on televeision. This show is much more than a car chase around Hazzard county, it shows many moral messages and also how to drive very well. This is a great gift for anyone or especially to all you Dukes fans out there. Buy this quickly, you will enjoy it very much.",1104710400,5,335,4.1692307692307695
2039887,5,B0001WTWXI,"I grew up on the Dukes and was born they debuted.  I remember watching them as a little kid and loving the show.  It wasn't until I was in high school and they would be on TNN as re-runs that I saw them again.  We would put TNN on in the weight room and watch as we warmed up or cooled down from practice.  Then they took it off the air again and I went about my life not thinking much about it.

Then I saw the first season on DVD and instantly bought it.  It did not disappoint.  Sure it was corny and hokey and and little less intense than I remeber it being, but it was cool!  I loved it and loved every episode and watching it just made time slip away.  It is a timeless classic that make you forget about your troubles.  Just go watch the Dukes!  The car is cool, the the characters are one of a kind and the morals taught are the ones that need to be brought back into our society today.",1104364800,6,894,3.911111111111111

2039909,4,B0001WTWXI,"This was by all accounts a fun show, as a 1979 mid-season replacement & coming on the heels of 1977's ""Smokey & the Bandit"", one can see why it did so well , it was not a show to be taken seriously, the pilot episode ""One armed Bandits"" is probably the best, shot in Georgia, which really shows by the way, unlike future episodes shot on the backlot of Warner Bros, this particular episode shows a more serious side to the Duke saga, Bo & Luke are not the cartoon characters they became later, they both have an edge to them, as well as questionable practices, such as Bo's comment to Luke that one of the kids at a nearby orphange could be his, or Daisy who comes off as not so innocent, or Uncle Jesse who has an edge to him not seen in later shows, Roscoe P. Coltrane who later became a bumbling idiot is a hard-nosed sherriff, very reminisent to Jackie Gleason's Buford T. Justice in ""Bandit"" who justify's his actions regarding his lost pension, & Boss Hogg in this episode acts more like a politican & not the cartoon character he would become, the first season was great, & highly recommended for those who liked the edgyness this show had at first, but by the time you get to the 12th & 13th episode, you can see the edge slipping away, the second season was mired by controversy though, with James Best(Roscoe) protesting the direction of his character(wonder why??) & Ben Jones(Cooter) protesting over his character's appearance(they wanted a clean cut Cooter) to Sonny Shoyer(Enos) possible spin-off show, not to mention the writers & actors strike in 1980 that kept one of the best two-part episodes ""Carnival Of Thrills"" out of season 2, where it rightfully belongs, hope this is on the season 2 set said to be slated later in the year, if so, 1 & 2 are the only seasons to get, the rest that followed were not as good, & are in my view nothing but a cartoon cutout, like many shows, the direction was changed & the outcome a joke to many viewers & critics, they should have kept the edge, but they didn't & screwing John Schieder(Bo) & Tom Wopat(Luke) out of their royalties was the death knell for this show, highly recommend season 1 & 2 though!!!, but that is about it!! unless you like the cartoonish stuff, I would stop at season 2!!!",1095984000,12,2253,4.444444444444445
2039910,5,B0001WTWXI,"The Dukes of Hazzard is one, out of many, shows that are my favorite. This 3 disc collection is a great asset to any collection. The show stars Tom Wapot as Luke Duke, John Schneider as Bo Duke, Cathrine Bach as Daisy Duke, Denver Pyle as Jesse Duke, James Best as Sheriff Rosco P. Coltrane, Sorrell Booke as Boss Hogg, Ben Cooper as Cooter, and Waylon Jennings as the Balladeer.

There are 13 episodes total. Each disc has two sides, except the third disc that only has one side. Each side has 3 episodes. The final disc has the 13th episode and has some bonus features. The bonus materials are ok, they include the 2oth Anniversary Hazzard County Barbecue Documentary, Dukes Driving 101: A High Octane Salute featurette, and a video game preview for, The Dukes of Hazzard: The Return of the General Lee.

This collection has the total running time, not including bonus materials, of about 637 minutes, it is presented in a fullscreen format and filmed in 1979. The ""Dukes of Hazzard Season One"" is a great addition if you like the Dukes and the General Lee.",1095206400,7,1059,4.597883597883598

2039912,4,B0001WTWXI,"First, I loved season one and I'm posting this message in the hopes that Warner Brothers can make all the future releases even better. The extras that are there are great, but they just leaving you wanting more.  With that, here's what I want to see in the future:

1. Better sound - MONO is just not going to cut it. Remaster the sound for 5.1 surround.

2. Widescreen option. These episodes were shot in 35 millimeter film, which is a widescreen format. Go back, pull the original film, and release a widescreen version.

3. More commentary - one out of thirteen episodes just isn't enough. John and Catherine were very good on One Armed Bandits, but it just left me wanting more. How about some of the production people (i.e. producer, director, stunt men).

4. Where the heck is Tom Wopat? He didn't participate at all in any of the extras for the first season. How about some commentary or interviews for the 2nd season?

5. Dust off any old interviews with Denver or Sorrell. They can't be with us today, but surely they talked about the show at some point.

6. Ditto for Waylon Jennings. Something on the Waylors would be nice, too.

7. How about a behind the scenes stunt featurette on all the wonderful stunt work over the years?

8. How about a playable demo of the Dukes of Hazzard video game?

Well, that's all I can think of now, but I'm sure more will come to mind. I hope that WB gets wind of this and adds at least some of these to future releases (especially 1 & 2). And get them out ASAP!",1095033600,11,1506,4.365591397849462

2039914,5,B0001WTWXI,"Another classic T.V. show has joined the realm of DVD in the form of ""The Dukes of Hazzard.""  All 13 episodes of Season 1 are present here in their entirety.  Each runs just over 49 minutes, and the original teasers at the beginning are intact (I was worried they would be omitted as they are in many other shows on DVD.)  The picture quality is largely very good.  I only saw a few spots that contained any glitches, and they were minor.  The sound is good, but a bit soft.  I have to turn the volume up to hear them better, and then when turning the DVD off the increased volume on the T.V. blows me away with whatever DirecTV channel is behind it.  That's just a minor flaw, though.

As other reviewers have noted, there does seem to be quite a lot of cursing in the show and a few racy moments, which surprised me.  I had never seen these early episodes before, as I didn't start watching the show until the third season in 1981.  By then it was toned down to the show that I remember enjoying as a kid, which as I recall contained little to no cursing at all.  Don't get me wrong, the only words they used were the two ""then-acceptable"" curse words for T.V. (you know the ones).  It's a far cry from what we see and hear today, of course.

The extras in this set are nice additions, especially the commentary by John Schneider and Catherine Bach on the premiere episode.  The documentary with surviving cast members (sans Tom Wopat) is good too.

In summary, this box set would be a worthwhile purchase for any fan of this show, or any ""child of the 80's"" like me who just enjoys getting to relive a little bit of his or her childhood.",1092441600,7,1640,4.262135922330097

2039917,5,B0001WTWXI,"An incredible show smashed by all the TV critics of the time, became one of the most popular television shows ever.  This first season shows the importance of family, leadership, and doing what is right.  The Dukes of Hazzard takes the prize in this hit first season and I only hope Warner Brothers continues this series. After 25 years since its debut the show is still making money with great Playstation games and an even better 3rd coming out in the fall.

I recently received it as a birthday present and have been torturing my husband with it ever since. The same show quality, great stories, and hysterical characters now at my fingertips.

The feautres are even better as the whole cast is seen at a down home barbecue reminsincing about the ""good old days"" ( Too bad Tom Wopat was not present). I as well had the pleasure of seeing ""Cooter"" in person at his place in Sperryville VA and honestly, I never met anyone as down to earth as him. The whole show had a few simple formulas really, fast cars, keniving cops who get it in the end, and even faster women and it worked so well. This is definately the best DVD release of a TV show I ever seen, and Warner Brothers please get the second season out in time for the holidays, i can't wait to see those as well.

I am so glad season one is on DVD, it is definitely worth the money for this classic collection!  I hope all the other Dukes seasons episodes will come out also, and I hope they come out real soon!  With The General Lee, Bo, Luke, SEXY and BEAUTIFUL Daisy, Uncle Jesse, Roscoe, Enos, Cooter, and Boss Hogg, I am very happy and excited with this DVD collection!!!",1088812800,7,521,4.17
2039953,5,B0001WTWXI,"I'm a youngin' compared to most of the people who are fans of Dukes of Hazzard. At 17, I've been watching the reruns on tv for the last 2 or 3 years, but could hardly ever catch a full episode because they played the series at 3, when i was still in school.
Now I've got the Firt Season on DVD and can watch Bo and Luke Duke outwitting Roscoe P. Coltrane and Boss Hogg whenever I want. Through in the wisdom of an old coot like Jesse Duke, a crazy car mechanic like Cooter Davenport, a foxy chick like Daisy Duke with million dollar legs, and a love-sick Enos with a heart of gold but a loyalty to the law, and you've got yourself one hell of a tv show.
I cannot describe just how happy i am that they released the first season on DVD. I used to tape the show on tv and my parents would come into my room and say, ""Watching Dukes of Hazzard, huh"" with that shake of the head and smile that all parents seem to be able to pull off.
Anyway, if you have ever liked any of the episodes, or like anything to do with fast cars and chase scenes and just some good old fun, this is not an opportunity you should be missing. Buying this DVD will not only give you hours of entertainment, it will remind you of the 'good ole days' of the late 70's and early 80's for those who actually lived through it. I can tell you, watching this tv show, i wish i was a teenager in the 70's.",1088640000,7,1369,3.981818181818182

2039955,5,B0001WTWXI,"Those were the days. The days when a family could watch Quality TV shows together.
 The days when shows like ""Quincy M.E."", ""Columbo"", and ""The Dukes Of Hazzard"" would all be on in our homes.
  Well, ""Dukes"" fans, you can now relive those beautiful days, because ""The Dukes Of Hazzard: The Complete First Season"" is on DVD!
  Those rebellious, yet harmless Duke boys, Bo and Luke Duke, joined by their cute cousin Daisy, and their righteous Uncle Jesse can once again be enjoyed by us all.
  But we cant also forget the bumbling sheriff Rosco P. Coltrane, Officers Enos and Cletus, the lovable Cooter, and of course Boss Hogg himself.
 All of these characters combine to create an American cult classic TV Show.
 ""The Dukes of Hazzard"" has only grown in popularity as time has elapsed.
  And finally, Warner Bros. presents us with this cool Dukes DVD collection of episodes, ALL of the episodes from the first season, which aired back in 1979.
 We are even treated to a special commentary by BO (John Schneider) and DAISY (Catherine Bach) Duke, as they join us for commentary on the first ever Dukes episode, ""One Armed bandits"".
  This show proves that TV isn't what it used to be.
 On The Dukes of Hazzard, you didn't see people get shot and killed, like you do on tv these days.
 On the Dukes, Daisy could be beautiful just be being herself (of course, her short shorts helped), unlike the sleezy junk that we see on current television.
  There was actually a moral to the story each week on the Dukes, unlike tv these days, most of which,have never heard of morals.
  The Dukes Of Hazzard is one of the all-time great TV Shows for many reasons.
 It was fun to watch. It is fun to watch. The show was pure fun. It still is pure fun. Watching the famous 69' Dodge Charger, The General Lee, jump high in the air, as if it had wings, every week, was and is fun.
 Watching Bo and Luke get themselves into and then out of trouble was and is fun.
 Watching the keystone cop-like antics of Rosco, Enos, Cletus, and Boss Hogg was and is fun.
 Its the timeless story of the good guys staying just one step ahead of the bad guys. But what is so special about this show is that, there weren't really any main characters who could be called ""bad"".
 They all had redeeming qualities to them, even the corrupt Hazzard County Police.
  Just like Robin Hood was considered a ""crook"", because he stole from the rich and gave to the poor, Bo and Luke Duke did the same. Now the Dukes never truly stole anything, they just ""borrowed"" it from the bad guys who stole it, and in turn, the Dukes gave it in such a way, as to make life better for everyone.
  The Dukes were, are and always will be classic  shows because they have the timeless qualities that all classics have.
  A great story that has morals, fun, excitement, laughter, and a story where the good guys finish first.
  Today's tv shows can learn alot from the awesome show that is, was and will always be ""The Dukes Of Hazzard"", one of the greatest shows ever!
  Enjoy this DVD....its not hard to do. Just strap yourself in, and hang on, for one of the most exciting shows in the history of tv.
  Once you visit Hazzard County, you never truly leave it, and it never truly leaves you either.
  Because its a Happy place to be.
 Thus the ultimate reason why the show is so popular.
  After watching the Dukes, you realize how life is about love, laughs and having fun.
 YAAAAAAAAAA HOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!
P.S. Warner Bros, you better not let us down by only releasing just one season of the Dukes. Bring us all of the classic shows with Bo and Luke. If you dont, we'll be after you like the General Lee on its way to the ""Boar's nest""!",1087776000,16,3680,4.42026825633383

Cousins Luke (Tom Wopat), Bo (John Schneider) & Daisy (Catherine Bach) Duke and their Uncle Jesse (Denver Pyle) match wits with sheriff Roscoe P. Coltrane (James Best) and the conniving Boss Hogg (Sorrell Booke) and of course always come out on top in the end.  Country music legend, the late Waylon Jennings provides the memorable theme song and acts as the show's narrator.  The real star of the show is the Duke boys' car, The General Lee.  The bright orange Dodge Charger is one of the most classic movie or film cars in history and half the fun of the show is watching the General Lee fly around Hazzard county either chasing someone or having Roscoe be in hot pursuit on their tail.",1087430400,8,863,4.577922077922078

The packaging for the DVD was excellent & the special features were good too. The Hazzard B-B-Q reunion was a nostalgic reminder of what made this show so wonderful. The audio commentary for the 1st episode was a nice touch (though Tom Wopat was sadly missing for any of the features). As far as the quality of the picture, it was perfect considering the show aired in 1979. The first season was always a good one because of the racy writing, the beautiful scenery in Georgia, & the youthfulness of all involved. It gave people something entertaining to watch on a Friday night & beats all of the shows that are on now for young people. Humor, fast cars, & family values made this show last & I cannot wait for the next season to come out on DVD. Good stuff all around.",1086912000,4,906,4.431137724550898
2039984,4,B0001WTWXI,"YeeHaw!  Any Duke fan will be proud of this very handsome DVD set. It opens up to reveal a very rich and colorful photo of Luke and Bo Duke working under the hood of the General Lee.  The 13 episodes of the first season are on two two-sided discs and one one-sided disc with big photos of Luke, Daisy, and Bo under the disc holders and photos of the other cast members on the sides.  Because the series started as a 9 p.m. program, these first season episodes are a little riskier and harsher than later shows.  The first episode, for example, has Bo (played by an 18-year old John Schneider) telling Daisy that if she wasn't his cousin he'd marry her with Daisy replying, ""That never stopped anyone in this family before.""  When Luke refuses to help a young girl save a local orphanage, Bo kids his cousin, ""at least two of those kids at that orphanage could be yours.""  Such jokes would not be used in later episodes when the series was a prime time hit.  These are also the episodes shot in Covington Georgia.
The 1979-aired episodes include the following: (I) One-Armed Bandits: Bo and Luke use Rosco's slot machines to help a local orphanage; (2) Daisy's Song: Daisy gets caught up in a crooked music publishing outfit; (3) Mary Kaye's Baby: The Duke boys get involved with a pregnant woman, an Atlanta mob boss, and a borrowed car full of moonshine;  (4) Repo Man: A crooked car dealer could land the Dukes in jail; (5) High-Octane: A very 1970s theme about the fuel crisis and Uncle Jesse's patriotic plan to alleviate the problem with his moonshine still; (6) Swamp Molly: Uncle Jesse helps old friend Molly on a last moonshine run; (7) Luke's Love Story: Luke's rival in Hazzard's stock car derby has million-dollar legs and a lead foot...and she's got his heart revved up; (8) The Big Heist: the General Lee is spotted at the scene of a robbery; (9) Limo One Is Missing: Cooter takes the U.S. President's limo for a joy ride; (10) Deputy Dukes: The Dukes are deputize to fetch Public Enemy #1; (11) Money to Burn: Boss Hogg tries to frame the Dukes for stealing government money; (12) Route 7-11: The Dukes become unknowing drivers of an illegal mobile gambling casino; (13) Double Sting: Bank robbers are in Hazzard disguised as Laurel and Hardy and the Duke boys and the police force are in quarantine.
The commentary by John Schneider and Catherine Bach on the first episode is very well-done.  Schneider actually reviewed the show beforehand so he had many interesting things to say.  They talk about the stunt men and where some of the child actors are now.  It really shows how much of a family the Dukes of Hazzard cast and crew was.  I wish there were more commentaries.  The 20th Anniversary Barbecue is a fun time of reminiscences by Schneider, Bach, Ben Jones, Sonny Shroyer, James Best, Rick Hurst (Cletus), Peggy Rea (Lulu Hogg), director Paul Baxley, and the star of the show the Dodge Charger 440 (General Lee).  They talk about the stunts, funny moments on the set, what the show means to them, and the deceased cast members Sorrell Brooke and Denver Pyle.  It is 28 minutes and very lighthearted and entertaining.  Shroyer is a little too silly, however, as the others are a lot more sincere in their remarks.  It is not mentioned why Tom Wopat did not participate.  ""Dukes Driving 101"" includes comments on the Dukes stunt driving by race car drivers Rusty Wallace, Larry Foyt, Robby Gordon, Jason Leffler, Matt Kenseth and Greg Biffle. The video game preview lasts about 35 seconds.  I have forgotten how great the characters in this show were, especially Denver Pyle as Uncle Jesse giving advice to his troublesome (yet well-meaning) nephews.  Anyone who enjoys real-and long-car chases (no computer graphics here), will love this DVD set.",1086825600,11,3769,4.690440060698028
2039985,4,B0001WTWXI,"The Dukes DVD turned out better than I expected. Warner Bros. did this right. The packaging and the video transfer are perfect! The two reasons for a 4 star rating are, Loretta Lynn's name was over-dubbed in the episode Daisy's Song, over the original singers name, Why? Also, from a purist view, the midpoint break is missing. Its the part halfway through an episode, before a commercial break, when Waylon says ""The Dukes of Hazzard will continue"" and they show a shot of the General jumping. Couldn't Warner Bros. add that in for originality's sake. Overall, it was well worth the wait. Having the Dukes on DVD is really great!! Will Season #2 and #3 be available soon?  Lets hope.",1086652800,,684,4.7
2039986,5,B0001WTWXI,"The first season of Dukes of Hazzard is the best of the litter. As with Amazon's editorial review in total agreement with me, The 1st season ""fans fondly recall because some of the programs were shot on location in Covington, Georgia, rather than a Burbank backlot and preplanned studios."" Real houses, real locations, it just feels real as you watch the early episodes. The characters we're also much more enticing early on. Rosco and JD Hogg are much more serious and the stories are more convincing and believable compared to the later episodes. Rosco, as the episodes continued, lost his seriousness and just lost his crucial aspect of being a corrupt lawman. Basically, Rosco evolved into an idiot and didn't stick with his roots of the early shows.  So after about episode 11, The Dukes of Hazzard turned into a comedy ruining he spirit of the show in my opinion.  The physical aspect of the show also took a hit. The quality and locations started to deterioriate over time and they started filming in a studio rather then real life locations. They started to use cheap backdrops behind the vehicles and became more blatent in Season two. It was simply more engrossing to know that all the characters were actually driving vehicles and not sitting in a motionless car behind a projection screen.  I know I'm sounding like a broken record here, but the series just gets worse as it went on. One Armed Bandits, Repo Man, Mary Kaye's Baby and Daisy's Song (filmed in Atlanta) are the best of the crop. 4 hours of great entertainment and why the show became popular. Also enjoyable was the ""Riskay"" tude of the show. You'll hear swearing and sexual innuendos througout the early episodes. Season 1 is definitely a must have. Future releases of the newer seasons however is a waste, it's just not the same. Stick with this collection and you'll be happy.
More commentary would have been nice, but for what they do have between Catherine Bach and John Schneider is nice to listen to. I'm not sure why Tom Wopat didnt' show up for the little reunion documentary, what a jerk for not being there. Just a point of interest, Daisy's Song, (Episode 2) got stuck about a 1/4 way though the episode on my DVD player and froze up me everytime and I'm still unable to finish watching it. It's brand new so I blame Warner Bros. for not doing more quality checks on different players. It probably plays fine on other players, or maybe I just got a defective disc, but it's still disappointing if you have the same player as I do. The brand I have is a toshiba.
I would have liked to have seen a remastered 5.1 Dolby Digital, but what am I thinking, this was made in 1979, so I will dream on. But this is as good as you will get for the Dukes Of Hazzard and the best quality you'll see for such an aging franchise.",1086652800,6,2802,4.544554455445544
2039987,5,B0001WTWXI,"As a kid, I absolutely LOVED this show!  I watched it every Friday night at 8 on CBS!  Now, I can enjoy it on DVD...and the laughs and chases are as good as ever!

I do miss Flash, the dog, in these early episodes...I hope he will show up on the next season.  The best show in this first season has to be REPO MAN....followed by SWAMP MOLLY.

2040020,5,B0001WTWXI,First off let me say Yee Haw. The Dukes of Hazzard is the greatest show ever made. But I have 1 question. Why isn't Tom Wopat at the 20th Anniversary Barbecue. Matter of fact I don't think his name was ever brought up by the ones that were there. I wish they would have had more commentary and invited every living cast member to do the commentary. Cathy and Johns commentary on the first episode was great. I can not wait to the other seasons come out on DVD. I hope they do more special features on future DVDs though. I would like to see how the sets they used look like now days. A feature on just the General Lee. Some behind the scenes footage and such. But even if none of that happened I would buy them just for the show itself. My favorite person on the show was Rosco. James Best played the part perfectly. And one day I will own a 1969 Dodge Charger and paint it orange with 01 on the side and a rebel flag on top.,1086393600,4,925,4.060109289617486

2040023,5,B0001WTWXI,"It still suprises me that I love this TV show, many years after I watched it in the early 80's as a kid.
It seems like every episode uses the exact same plot and basic story outline.
1.  The Dukes meet someone, or an old friend shows up.
2. That person asks the Dukes to help them
3.  Boss Hogg and Roscoe find out what is going on and try and make a profit off of it.
4.  The Dukes foil the crime and also stop Boss Hogg and Roscoe from getting anything out of it..
Also, there is always a couple of car chases and crashes.  And don't forget about the mandatory jumping of the General Lee.
Anyway, it sounds like I am trashing the show while I am actually trying to praise it for somehow overcoming its plot issues and remaining a great show that is fun to watch over and over.  Maybe the lack of an original plot allows the viewer to just sit back and suspend belief while enjoying the silliness and humor.
The extras are not that great because Tom Wopat (Luke Duke) was not a part of it.  I heard that he was busy with his Broadway shows.  Hopefully he can be a part of the DVD of season 2.

2040027,5,B0001WTWXI,"""Welcome to Hazzard County"",says the now-deceased off-screen narrator Waylon Jennings,just before the playing of the opening montage for the first episode,ONE-ARMED BANDITS. GOOD OL' BOYS,written and performed by Jennings is the theme song. We see his guitar and hands(and nothing else of his) in the montage. The ""one-armed bandits"" are slot machines just like what casinos have. Sheriff Roscoe Coltrane(James Best) is considering legalization of gambling. Also he's about to become re-elected Hazzard County Sheriff. Roscoe's sister Lulu(Peggy Rea in a recurring role) is married to Hazzard commissioner Jefferson Davis ""Boss"" Hogg(the late Sorrell Booke). He owns Boar's Nest,a pub and short order restaurant where Daisy Duke(Catherine Bach) works as a waitress. The stars are Tom Wopat and John Schneider,who themselves are country music artists,as cousins Luke and Bo Duke. Daisy,also a cousin of Luke's and Bo's(nobody knows about their fathers),is strongly liked by Deputy Enos Strate(Sonny Shroyer). Between Enos and Roscoe,Enos is the nice one. Enos would only arrest the Dukes when ordered to by Roscoe or Boss Hogg. But,they quickly broke free from all apprehensions. The late Denver Pyle is the Dukes' uncle Jesse,the white-haired and white-bearded patriarch of the family. Also there's Cooter Davenport(Ben Jones) who runs a auto repair shop. He would even escape the clutches of Roscoe. Unlike many other shows,each Dukes of Hazzard episode title would appear at the beginning of every episode. Shroyer did not appear in the opening montage for the first season,since his role then was only recurring. Also seen in the first season briefly was Boss Hogg's cousin Cletus(Rick Hurst) who'd join the DOH cast from 1980 to 1983. From the second season on,we'd still see Jennings' hands in the opening montage but with an electric guitar(an acoustic guitar is seen in the 1st season montage).",1086134400,2,1901,5.425675675675675

The plot is fairly simple, it does not really take a detective to watch the show. You have the Duke boys, who Boss Hogg wants to send back to jail because they keep thwarting his scams. Thier Uncle Jessie, who they live with, was at one time a moonshiner who now is a lawful citizen. Now Boss Hogg is not an angel himself, he is always comming up with a scam to make money, and the Duke boys often find themselves in the middle of it. But all is not lost, because Uncle Jessie, Daisy, and Cooter will come to the rescue to make everything alright again in Hazzard County.
I think what I liked most about this show was, for the half an hour it was on tv, it was a break from reality. You got to see basically good people having a good time. Even Boss Hogg, the ""bad guy"" in the series had a good heart, although he was a little greedy with the fried chicken and money. I laughed every time he smacked Rosco's hand when Rosco tried to take a peice of fried chicken. And I loved the car, watching the General Lee jump creeks, ponds, barns and other cars. Daisy was as sweet a southern bell as any I have ever seen. And Rosco often had me laughing so hard, with his little noises and facial expressions. I highly reccomend this series.

2040100,5,B0001WTWXI,"Finally, the first season of Dukes on DVD.  The characters took some time to flesh out before they became the stereotypical heroes and villians that most viewers remember the show for.  In the beginning, Rosco was more of a corrupt cop and less of a lovable dope, which in many ways I prefer.  Boss Hogg was also a bit more intelligent of a character in the beginning.  And rather than just basing shows on car chases and ""how to frame the Dukes this week"" as in later seasons, the first episodes were intelligently written schemes that the viewer can easily get lost (in a good way) as to what's going on.  The first five episodes were filmed in Covington, GA (before they moved to familiar backlot in Burbank, CA), and you really get the sense that these are southern people in the South, rather than the stereotypical backwoods feeling you get from the Burbank episodes.  That these early episodes focused more on plot is most evident in ""Mary Kay's Baby,"" the only episode in all seven seasons to not feature the General Lee.  And personally, I'll buy this set just to get ""Daisy's Song"": since there were only 13 episodes in the first season, when Columbia House distributed these episodes on VHS cassette at two shows per tape, this is the show that got left out of their catalogue.
Also worth noting is that when TNN was showing the Dukes a few years back, heavy edits had to be made to each show to fit modern commercial breaks.  When I got Columbia House's versions, I found that significant chunks, usually integral to understanding the plot of a given episode, were now present and accounted for.  Having all 13 episodes available without edit is another reason worth picking this up as opposed to watching it on television.
By the end of the season, the characters were already becoming what we remember them to be, in my opinion, for the atmosphere and for the writing, season one is the best of the series.",1082246400,131,1920,4.607038123167156

An unlucky thief has his car towed away while he's robbing Boss Hogg, so he stashes the loot in Daisy's pickup and makes a getaway in the Dukes' family car.

Secret Service agents driving the Presidential limousine through the county stop just long enough for car-crazy Cooter to hot-wire it and take off.

Boss Hogg deputizes the Dukes to escort a prisoner to Hazzard for trial, fully aware that the suspect's pals would stop at nothing to turn him loose.

2040103,5,B0001WTWXI,"Not only the greatest Dukes ep ever, but perhaps the best episode of TV ever. This is the Dukes with a realistic flavor. Those aren't TV sets, they  are real buildings that still exist in Covington and Conyers, GA, today!
If you are a Dukes fan, YOU MUST buy this episode. If not only to see  how it all begins, if not only to see this classic American tale, but  because TNN does such a hatchet job in cutting this one up in re-runs, you  can't follow the plot and many of the episodes', and series', great scenes!  But you can here, and you learn of the story between Bo and Jill Rae Dotson  (Tisch Raye) that TNN doesn't show and are essential to the plot, which is  based on a real life tale of a slot machine racket writer Gy Waldron  discovered doing research creating Dukes. Raye, who would later marry in to  French royalty and retire from acting, two years later landed a guest spot  on Charlie's Angels in an episode entitled, ""Moonshinin' Angels"".  This role unquestionably helped her land that one.
From the opening  scene, where a Hazzard Co. Patrol Car and the General Lee jump over a hill  on Covington, Georgia's Elm Street, to the final joke of Rudy (played by  Jason Lively, the son of Ernie Davis Lively, who played Dobro in this ep  and appeared in three other Dukes eps as two other characters. Jason  himself would be the focal point of the sixth season episode, ""The  Boar's Nest Bears"") squirting flies on the General's rear windshield,  this show is captivating. There is action, four, count 'em, FOUR car  chases! But there is also drama, mischief, and a tale that really leaves no  gaps. So many people think of The Dukes of Hazzard as a slapstick show, but  that dumbed down feel of the show is absent here. Watching this makes you  wonder how good Dukes would have been if they had continued to shoot in  Georgia and followed Waldron's vision, rather than move the show to  California and adopt hack writers from Gilligans Island and McHales Navy to  ""Hollywoodize"" it.
If you love the Dukes of Hazzard, this is a  must for your library. You cannot enjoy the show in its proper context  without seeing the above missing scenes! And if you're a southerner looking  for a feel of rural southern life in the 1970's, look no further. This is  it.
""One Armed Bandits"" is such a quality piece of television  die-hard Dukes fans have been known to memorize every line of dialoge to it  and travel to Covington and Conyers to check out shooting locations! Let's  just say I still remember vividly watching this episode for the first time  on its very first airing on Jan. 26, 1979, and I was seven at the time. For  a memory like that to be imprinted on such a young mind, this episode must  really be something special. You will agree after viewing it. Five stars do  not do it justice. It should receive an infinite amount of stars.",941414400,34,2855,4.4863813229571985

8017485,5,B0001WTWXI,"This series hit the airwaves on Friday Nights in 1979. I didn't look at it every week back then, but it was a very different kind of a show for me. It was Comedy and Drama rolled into one. I hadn't ever seen anything like it. It had a crooked Police Commissioner, a Dirty Sheriff, a dishonest Deputy and one honest Deputy. Poor Enos Strait! He had the hots for Daisy from the start which is obvious in the first episode: ""One-Armed Bandits"".

MY FAVORITE EPISODE IN THIS SEASON IS: ""DOUBLE STING"".

For the Consumer's who aren't aware of it, this season has been repackaged. I first bought this Season during the CHRISTMAS SEASON IN 2008, used. It was missing it's sleeve. The original package folded out, like the packages of all of the rest of the Seasons. The case on this repackaging is in a Plastic box type case with a spindle to hold all of the discs, stacked on top of each other. No wonder this repackaging issue is so inexpensive. Plus the discs are all Orange. Nothing is wrong with that, but in order for me to get to the next disc, I pull all of the discs off of the spindle and place the watched disc at the bottom. This way, I know which disc was last watched. There is an insert which list all of the Episodes with their Airdates and descriptions. I'm not sure, but I think that some of the extras are missing. There was a pow-wow with some of the Stunt People, sitting around, discussing the stunts and how they were done.

The only Extra on this Season that I like is: The 20th Anniversary Hazzard County Barbecue Documentary. This Extra have all of the ""Main Cast""  during this Season, reunited for some delicious Barbecue and reminiscing about the show. Of course Sorrell Booke and Denver Pyle were not there because they had both passed in the 1990's. I believe it was filmed in ""Conyers, Georgia"". It was fun seeing what everyone looked like 20 YEARS after the show had ended. Even ""Lulu Hogg"", played by ""Peggy Rea"" was there.
