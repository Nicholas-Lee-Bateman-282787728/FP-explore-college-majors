8211393,5,6304413483,"If you still have a VCR and you are an opera lover, this is a most have. Magda Olivero just had her 103rd birthday this year (2013) and wasn't invited to sing at the Met till the 70's, when she was 65 years old in this very role. The RAI television broadcast is fully staged and a gripping performance. Bel Canto Society used three different prints to restore this production and adjusted the tuning pitch for accuracy! The sound, considering the year (1960), is excellent! Oliveros 'Vissi d'Arte' is full of emotion and heart-wrenching. The final execution scene is well acted and well photographed! If you are not familiar with Olivero, then here is a great introduction! If you already are familiar with her, but don't have this, then what are you waiting for? The rest of the cast is more than adequate, but this is all about Olivero!",1375142400,,838,4.630872483221476
