8570403,5,B00BLFZYW2,"The US has been turning out rom-coms since the origin of our species and they've become tiresome, boring, formula driven reduxes. The Koreans, Mexicans, Thais and others unfortunately have not learned from our mistakes (unless of course if it's just about making money). The southern Chinese studios however this past decade or so have been showing creative and independent storytelling and studio work. Kudos to them for this rom-com of mismatched partners, of all sexual persuasions, as representative of those efforts. Also, a shout-out to Louis Koo and now Donnie Yen for the courage to jump out of the martial arts action comfort zone every so often.",1338595200,,655,5.130841121495327
