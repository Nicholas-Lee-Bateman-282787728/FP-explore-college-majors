8281187,3,B001B187MA,"I am a true pasty white Anglo Saxon protestant.  I know very little about the Latino/Chicano/Mexican culture.  Since I do not know the politically correct term, I will call this culture ""Lacanican""culture combining parts of all of the labels.

 I have worked with quite a few of these lovely people.  If you are ""Lacanican"", this movie has all of the elements you will like.  It has Low-riders(which must have shocks strong enough to carry elephants in the front seat), it has beautiful dark eyed dark haired women, handsome dark haired men, a Mariachi band, the obligatory car repair shop where the Mexican mechanics  can repair things with nothing else but duct tape, bailing wire and a Philips screwdriver--they are geniuses in my experience.  It has lots of wonderful bouncy Mexican music, colorful scenery, everything you would want.  However, it also has a lots of things that really don't show the best side of this warm and hard-working people. It spends a lot of time with murders, drugs, prostitution with a Lacanican gangster and an African American pimp, and other things that would not show this culture in a positive light. These people struggle with many things in our country, not the least of which is bad press.  Also sadly the good aspects do not outweigh the weak story line and bad acting.  And, unfortunately I bought this movie because Mr. Trejo's image is prominently shown on the front of this movie's container.  He probably is in this movie a total of about 15 seconds in two scenes.

The movie starts out looking like the main character is on death row and just about to do the ""dead man walking"" thing. The star of this movie who has the most lines by far is Pablo Bracho.  He plays a handsome young activist, trying to get more rights for the people of his culture.  His brother is played by Tim Wehmeyer, who looks convincingly Lacanican although his real name does not appear so. Mr Wehmeyer forges through the movie trying to find the evidence that will prove the activist's innocence.  The other performance that really stands out is by the young Lady who plays ""Sasheen Long"" the defense attorney played by Angela Smith. Mr. Trejo's extremely brief appearances and few lines make him out to be Don Reyes,a very wicked drug lord and head of a cartel (and I am not sure if the ""Don"" meant something other than ""Donald"" but it might have been like ""Don Diego De La Vega (Zorro)) .  I know that Mr. Trejo does a lot of charity work, and I think this might qualify as charity or a charity date.

If you do not know what a ""charity"" date is, I am.  I've been on a couple of them. It is when you are convinced by a well-meaning friend to come to an event, which turns out to be a blind date with a not so savory match up.  But, at least I was smart enough to be suspicious enough to have planned an escape route by bringing my own car to the event.  I could then escape with some excuse (nausea was usually a fairly truthful one) and get home before any harm was done to myself or the ego of the other person with whom I was badly matched  I am hoping that Mr. Trejo had planned his own escape from this film and perhaps that is why he is only featured for about 15 seconds--because he exited stage left before harm was done. This could also be part of his magnanimous charitable nature lending both his name and handsome face (YES, HANDSOME--No sarcasm) to this less than perfect production to give this young production crew a leg up.  He would do something like that.

If I were to blame anybody for what this movie was lacking, it would be the person who seemed to have his finger in virtually all the pies--Juan C Vasquez.  He is credited with writing, directing, producing, editing and acting in this film. There were also others in the film that are credited with more than one task.  Mr. Vasquez, I think you were stretched too thin, and perhaps should concentrate your potential talents in one or two of those areas. You are just not quite ready to do the Alfred Hitchcock thing yet.

So, here's hoping that Mr. Vasquez can come up with a better vehicle for Mr. Trejo's talents, so he doesn't have to bring an escape vehicle of his own.",1397865600,,4173,4.5

Extremely low budget, and Danny Trejo is realy only making a cameo appearance.",1376092800,2,246,4.568181818181818

8281190,5,B001B187MA,this film touches on all aspects of how the system tries again and again to keep any ethnicity down....and how much struggle there is to keep moving forward with so much negativity around. its a must see,1228348800,9,203,4.513513513513513
