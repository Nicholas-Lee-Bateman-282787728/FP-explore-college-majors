5696247,5,B00C7MW5SE,love the show ... found this for a good price cannt complain one bit.... anyone who loves scifi like I do needs this in their collection,1377734400,2,136,4.269230769230769
5696248,5,B00C7MW5SE,"I absolutely loved this show. Sorry to see it end but what a ride it was still have ""The Plan"" to watch but I am sure it will not disappoint.",1377216000,,141,3.7333333333333334

5696250,5,B00C7MW5SE,"I was a great fan of Battlestar Galactica and I had already seen these films. I purchased the BluRay copy to watch and I enjoyed them a lot. They brought back the nostalgia of the series and it brought in a new set of characters and a new battleship named Pegasus.

It also brings in more detail regarding the Cylons and their hated of mankind.  These films are worth watching if you are a fan. I enjoyed seeing them again and it was worth the purchase.

If you love Battlestar Galactica then this is a must have for your collection.",1507680000,2,533,4.31
5696251,1,B00C7MW5SE,Neither disc would play on working BluRay player.  Tried DVD player hoping they were mislabled but no joy there either.  Being returned.,1503705600,,136,5.136363636363637
5696252,4,B00C7MW5SE,"I have watched the series a few times and love it. Fantastic series. Have not watched Razor. After watching ""The Plan"" two times, I hope Razor is better.
BUT, If you have not seen the series, Do Not Watch This First. It will ruin your experience of the series. This is like a ""Readers Digest"" version of the series that is not at all satisfying. Too many things missing. BUT, In the first 15 minutes it tells you everything you are not suppose to know till it happens. A lot of which doesn't happen til the latter, and even the last season.
A good addition to a collection? Yes. Worth what I spent on it? No.
But I digress. The main reason I am writing this review is to keep people who have not seen the series from ruining their surprises.
If you have not seen the series, Buy it. Watch it. From episode #1 through to the end. It's great. Buy the box set, it's only 40-some dollars, and
that's Blu-Ray, and worth every penny.
But, don't watch The Plan or Razor First. You'll be sorry if you do.",1496620800,,996,4.247368421052632

5696285,4,B00C7MW5SE,These shows would be enjoyed the most after having watched the entire Battlestar Galactica series.  They provide considerable supplemental detail to the original plot-line and flesh out several of the characters.  As is usual with BG the plots are engaging and the acting is superb.,1453420800,,282,5.2444444444444445

5696292,5,B00C7MW5SE,Very cool,1442188800,,9,4.0
5696293,3,B00C7MW5SE,Little annoying that when I play the disc in my playstation it automatically connected to the internet to download previews of movies. I only got around it by unplugging the network cable temporarily hopefully I won't have to do that for the rest of the discs. My review is not 5 stars because of the way the discs are marketed. I love the show and watched it twice already before getting the set and I notice more stuff every time we watch. Both the Plan and Razor are contained on this disk. Both movies an assemblage of snippets of other episodes but it does provide a back story and kind of fills  in the missing gaps so it's a worthwhile purchase.,1442102400,,652,4.3884297520661155
5696294,4,B00C7MW5SE,"Two movies in one Blu-ray!  I thoroughly enjoyed the Razor movie, the second feature was not so enticing.  It was worth getting, for me (I am a Battlestar Galactica fan).",1441238400,,170,4.633333333333334
5696295,5,B00C7MW5SE,love this movie and its gritty and shows that not all things are great in the space of Battlestar Galactica.,1437523200,,108,4.45
5696296,5,B00C7MW5SE,Great 2 movies of expanded episodes. Great for your sci-fi collection. Would like to get the entire series on BD one day.,1435536000,,121,4.545454545454546
5696297,4,B00C7MW5SE,Love all of these Blu-ray from this series,1435449600,,42,4.375
5696298,5,B00C7MW5SE,"Another great addition to the Battlestar Galactica series.  I truly enjoy this series.  These two mini movies are well written and fit in perfectly with the rest of Battlestar Galactica universe.
In Razor you learn about another Battlestar named Pegasus.  You learn about there crew and eventual see there fate.  This is one of my favorite add on's to the series because it gives you a look at a different group of people experiencing the same devastation that hit the Galactica and its group of ships.
In The Plan you learn why the Cylons hate humanity so much and about there leaders and there quest to destroy those that kept them as slaves.  This gives you a good look at the motivation for Cylon uprising.
I'd recommend this to anyone who has started to watch Battlestar Galactica or those who have already watched it.",1435190400,7,823,4.6875
5696299,3,B00C7MW5SE,kind of confuseing  its ok but i like the original 1978 version much better,1435017600,,75,4.357142857142857
5696300,5,B00C7MW5SE,Just what i needed to complete the set. Own the bsg european set. Great purchase 2 movies for the price of less than one.,1434931200,,121,4.083333333333333

5696302,4,B00C7MW5SE,"Love Razor the same as the rest of the series.  The Plan makes no sense whatsoever.  IMHO, it contradicts some of the main tenets of the series, most strikingly, that Cavil apparently knows who the final five are??  Common, no hint of that in the main series.  The oracle tells us that the ""chosen one"" will discover who the final five are - D'Anna.  I didn't even finish watching because of that glaring inconsistency.",1432512000,2,419,4.608108108108108

5696309,3,B00C7MW5SE,"If you are a fan of the SciFi channel's BattleStar Galactica remake then you will love these movies.  These are expanded editions of the episodes shown on TV.

5696319,4,B00C7MW5SE,"I enjoyed Razor, having seen the miniseries years ago, I missed the first part, so it was nice to see the entire story unfold.  Well written, and a clever weaving of other plot lines in the series.  The usual great stuff from Ronald D. Moore.

The Plan was clever, but I tired of all the ""flashbacks"" to scenes in the original, sometimes it felt disjointed, almost a bit of a forced storyline.  Be prepared the ""unrated"" version has some skin you won't see on SyFy, Still, if you're a BSG addict, it's a good way to understand how certain ""skin jobs"" kept appearing in the series.",1402963200,2,580,4.443396226415095
5696320,5,B00C7MW5SE,"Was a gift as I loved the newer BSG series.  This was intended to add to owning the entire series that my kids had previously bought for me for Father's Day.  It was great to get the special event ""Razor"".  However, if you are buying this, and already own the entire series Blu-ray collectors edition, the second feature on here, ""The Plan"" is already included in your boxed set.  Not a big deal at this cheap of a price (got mine on sale), but thought I would mention it.

In the end, the price was good.  It came in great condition, and was shipped out very promptly.  I really couldn't be more pleased.",1402876800,4,605,4.300884955752212
5696321,5,B00C7MW5SE,"the reason for giving the rating is due to the great price that I paid for the product I received(condition/presentation).

5696324,5,B00C7MW5SE,"The Plan really puts things into perspective - should have seen it first but I guess that would spoil the series, knowing in advance who was what. Razor fills the same role",1396137600,,172,4.40625
5696325,5,B00C7MW5SE,"I loved the series and when I was finished this was an interesting view into another perspective (The Plan).
I watched Razor earlier in the series and it also helped fill in some blanks where I wasn't sure how things had come to be.

Both of these are great.

5696327,5,B00C7MW5SE,"This is the greatest deal EVER!!! Battlestar Gallactica was, is and forever will be the Best SciFi show out there. It's sad that the show did not last longer.  I wish we could re-visit it each year. with a movie, that tells a story about something inbetween epsiodes.  Or something Like, ""The Plan"" From the Cylon Prespective.  Make a Movie of what happened leading up to the war that split the Cylon into 2 different Factions and the end could be a special effects dream of Cylon on Cylon Action.  Have the Movie be a Cylon only version of the Movie.  With the Colonials showing up right after the fight at the end of the Movie.  That would be an Awesome Movie and straight to Blu-Ray/DVD.  Also package up the Mini-series on Blu-Ray on it's own with a great price like this, I would by that in a heart beat.",1382659200,,809,4.3533333333333335
