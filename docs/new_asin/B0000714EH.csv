7973884,4,B0000714EH,"This documentary does a good job in illustrating that Rev. Al motivates the grassroots, can bring media attention to oft-ignored topics, and definitely will not sell out.  This work is filled with satirical cartoons on the Reverend that are hilarious, but they do not take away from the good work that he has done.

It was equally hilarious seeing photos of the Reverend as a child.  Even though he had a natural, rather than pressed hair, he still had those big, pinchable cheeks.  In fact, in the documentary, Rev. Al explains how he met James Brown but never once states that this is how he got the pressed hair idea.  I don't know if he thinks the topic is beneath him or not, but since this is his signature feature, he should have spoken about it.

Former NYC Mayor Ed Koch speaks in this documentary, thus there are black and white interviewees here.  However, no women are interviewed.  Further, though speakers say that Rev. Al fights for blacks and Latinos, not one Latino or Latina is interviewed.  These omissions take away from any idea that he is a coalition builder.

Though there are several photographs and video clips of Reverend Jesse Jackson, neither Rev. Al nor any other interviewee so much as says his name.  The documentary states that Sharpton enhanced his activist skills as a leader of Operation Breadbasket's youth group.  However, no one mentions that Operation Breadbasket was Reverend Jackson's brainchild and the predecessor of the Rainbow/PUSH Coalition.  Reverend Jackson's erasure is highly noticeable, and controversial, in this work.

In fact, I am surprised this documentary did not get Rev. Al in trouble.  He is taped in the past using an anti-white epithet twice (it rhymes with ""slacker"").  Further, he states that he is not suited for political office.  This documentary appeared in 2002 before he ran in the 2004 presidential election.  I am astonished that no detractor used his comments against him last year.

The documentary includes typed statements about how Rev. Al fared in legal cases and other matters.  For those with little education or who read slowly, they will miss the information.  Perhaps one of BET's many excellent news anchors should have narrated this work.

I have new respect for Reverend Al after seeing this documentary.",1112745600,4,2290,4.955380577427822
