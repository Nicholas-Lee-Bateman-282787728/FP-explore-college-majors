8064907,5,B0009PLO42,"i bought this hoping the pal format would play on my computer and it did easily.  wow.  what an incredible musical journey with the master of Klezmer music.  i was mesmerized by his clarinet as i have been on the cds but wasn't prepared for the tour of Auschwitz / Birkenau camps with Feidman playing music by Wagner.  The 60 minute concert is backed by a group of musicians chosen by him and what a treat to hear the concert before a live audience.  Do yourself a favor and buy this if you have the slightest interest in world music/klezmer.  Of course, play it on an allregions dvd player.",1398297600,,591,4.376146788990826
