8526340,5,B0089FEYBY,"Charlie Rose's programs are a beacon  - not just a light - in our present day media world - so full of distortions! Opinions based on true research and the integrity of the interviewee are Charlie's guideline to every one of his programs. But his brain series are especially enlightening. In series 2 episode 8 we are left with more hope for medical application of the amazing results of our brain research teams. For all sufferers of Parkinson, Hutchinson's or Alzheimer's disease it has been the burning question: when will all this discovery find its way into medication and treatment?
The episode 8 program boosts this hope tremendously. Having a sister in advanced stage of Parkinson's and a husband in a very early stage of dementia this program presented truly the light at the end of the tunnel! I just wish many more people would tune in on the Charlie Rose programs and to help spreading the information fostered by him prompted me to purchase the tape.
