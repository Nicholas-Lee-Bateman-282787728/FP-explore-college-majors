of Florida history.",1391126400,,126,5.0
8258362,5,B0015GIYHY,"I'm very surprised this documentary was only given one star. Although the person who paid for wrote and narrated this film is not from Florida, his wife is. When he first visited Florida he seemed to fall in love with it and the people who farm it. Ive lived in Central Florida for over 35 yrs and have seen so much development. This film is touching personal and a wake up call to all of us.",1370131200,,392,4.171052631578948
8258363,1,B0015GIYHY,What happens when a NYer makes a movie about FL? Accents. That is what happens. Watch it on mute for best effect.,1361145600,,113,4.181818181818182
8258364,1,B0015GIYHY,"Oh my, this was such a huge disappointment.  We had just watched Cowboys of Florida and were hoping for a better film on the same subject, only to discover it was just a longer version of that film, which was blessedly short.  Painful to watch, more like a home movie than something that should be on Amazon and sold to an unsuspecting public.",1354579200,,343,4.428571428571429
8258365,5,B0015GIYHY,"This DVD was most interesting.  For anyone visiting, or newly moved here, it's educational for its telling of the history of the true Florida.  Florida is more than palm trees, beaches, and orange groves.  Florida began with ranching and cowboys, from the Native Americans to the early settlers.  The DVD explains how the ""Cracker"" name became synonymous with Florida cowboys (and it has nothing to do with the tobacco spitting guys sitting on a porch step swapping stories!) and more.  There are mini-interviews with the cowboys themselves.  It's documentary style, but loaded with anecdotes and wonderful memories of the cowboys.  At times humorous,touching and always informative, I would recommend this DVD to anyone with an interest in the true Florida.",1290038400,3,758,5.266666666666667
8258366,5,B0015GIYHY,"This documentary film is wonderfully done. It's a quality film that gives us background on the history of the cowboys of Florida as well as a glimpse into their lives today. Face after face tells us of lives that are forever intertwined with nature and a part of our landscape that is rapidly changing. I hope all Florida high schools will share this film with their students!  Anyone with an interest in history will enjoy this one.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Cracker-the-last-cowboys-of-Florida/dp/B0015GIYHY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Cracker - the last cowboys of Florida</a>",1257638400,2,621,6.22093023255814
