8585828,4,B00CSLRH2S,These documentaries are really informative as the one for Prince goes into details of him in the 80'swhile Michael tells the story about his trial and the music and Madonna goes into details of her career,1398038400,4,204,4.694444444444445
8585829,2,B00CSLRH2S,Watching this is a trip down frustration avenue! I didn't notice the disclaimer that says there are no performances or music by the artists themselves. SO the documentary is all talk and no show. Can't believe anyone would dare to do something like this. I feel cheated.,1382659200,8,270,4.76595744680851
