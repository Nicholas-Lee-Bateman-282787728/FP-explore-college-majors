8753099,2,B01CIJYYHA,The DVD did not go far enough into the subject of church and lgbtiq or the bible history that the church feels to be right . Anything different is shund. The SDA church is a sect and has very little to give anyone who is different to them.,1490745600,2,239,4.0
8753100,5,B01CIJYYHA,Excellent film! Thank you Stephen and Daneen for such a great film! Bringing everyone together to talk was such a great idea! Beautifully done. The conversation is started. Spreading it to everyone who is willing to hear about love.,1459987200,4,232,4.9743589743589745
8753101,5,B01CIJYYHA,"I've always found that if you are grappling with an issue, the best way is to bring lots of ideas to the table - lots of ideas from lots of different types of people.  This film does that.  This is not a discussion ABOUT people - it's a conversation WITH people who are seemingly from many different sides of the complex issue of the LBGTQ community.  Enough Room at the Table beautifully tackles the issue of faith on the margins with pastors, lay people and all sorts of LBGTQ people, including the infancy issues of gender transitions.  Well done!",1459987200,6,550,4.525252525252525
