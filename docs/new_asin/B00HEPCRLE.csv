6156740,4,B00HEPCRLE,"Phil Broker (Jason Statham) is a former NARC who must now lay low due to getting the son of a crime boss killed. He is living in Louisiana which allows them to use a better soundtrack and crazy characters. His wife has passed on, he has a daughter Maddy (Izabela Vidovic) and a wanna be formulaic relationship with school counselor Susan Hatch(Rachelle Lefevre). He draws attention to himself while trying to live with a low profile, attention that endangers the life of both him and his daughter.

As art imitates life, James Franco plays the crazy bad guy and Winona Ryder his trashy girlfriend.

This is one of the better Statham films I have seen. It includes the usual tough guy talk, fighting, killings, chase scenes, and explosions. It also includes a colorful support cast with Kate Bosworth and Marcus Hester as realistic people. Bosworth was a pistol.

Worth seeing for fans of action films.

6156741,4,B00HEPCRLE,"According to English journalist Christopher Booker, there are only seven basic plots, but screenwriter Sylvester Stallone (""Rambo"" and ""Rocky"") uses my favorite one (Overcoming the Monster). He gives us someone to root for and then puts that individual in jeopardy.

After establishing our hero's credibility as an undercover agent for an alphabet soup of agencies, this non-stop actioner gets started with a simple little case of grade-school bullying which results in a fist fight; the families quickly escalate the situation and from there on, the action rarely lets up.

We watch:
  * Jason Statham (""The Transporter"") A mystified local cop thinks maybe Phil Broker is in the Witness Protection Program...or something. He clearly is NOT a run-of-the-mill local yokel in the small Southern hamlet where he and his daughter have settled.
  * Izabela Vidovic (Lots of TV) is his daughter Maddy, who, miracle of miracles, does NOT trip and fall when being chased, is resourceful and clever, and knows how to stick up for herself.
  * James Franco (""Oz the Great and Powerful"") is Gator, a down-home bad boy with a hi-tech meth lab that will be his ticket to the big time.
  * Kate Bosworth (""Win a Date with Tad Hamilton!"") is his sister, furious over that playground incident and dead set on revenge.
  * Wynona Ryder (""The Iceman"") is Sheryl Mott, a foul-mouthed barmaid; she delivers a file to a powerful man who needs it, then she watches the whole violent catastrophe unfold.

This has a richly deserved R rating, so expect lots of profanity, broken bones and torture, many intervals of gunfire and drug use along with some highly satisfying blowie uppie stuff. However, I hope you noticed that I said in the first paragraph ""Overcoming the Monster"" so that means a happy ending! Whew...",1387411200,72,1792,4.973154362416107

6156759,1,B00HEPCRLE,"SPOILER ALERT*******

If you do not have a functioning brain, if you are capable of suspending reality, then this is the movie for you.  When some local backwoods loser drug dealer (Franco) just shows up with classified US Govt and Interpol documents that was a bad move on the part of the writers.  Really?  So where did Franco go?  Wally world to the classified documents section?  And the inept local cop was a typical joke.  Usually Statham movies try to stick with things that have a flow to reality.  This movie should be in the fantasy section, not action.  BTW, very little action takes place.  A huge amount of emphasis was placed on running down people who live in Louisiana.  Were I a resident of that state I would sue the makers of this film for Libel.  The acting was adequate for the story presented.  I do not fault any of the actors.  The story was a joke.  DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME WITH THIS TRASH!!!
PS....I threw my copy out.",1520726400,,942,4.458823529411765
6156760,3,B00HEPCRLE,"I didn't like this movie, but I'm giving it three stars because it's okay for what it is. It's a Sylvester Stallone tough guy fantasy.

When I saw a clip of this movie, I thought it might be an action film with some nice father/daughter touches. But it was far more focused on beating up and killing rednecks and bikers. The hero, Broker, is laughably tough. It doesn't matter how many guys Broker is fighting, or how many guns the bad guys have, or if Broker is tied up. He'll always win and he'll never get hurt too much.

It's sort of interesting to see Winona Ryder playing the role of a skank (that's how people refer to her in the movie). This movie isn't flattering to small, bucolic towns in Louisiana. There are violent ""feuds"" that apparently are pretty common. As the gorgeous schoolteacher said, the town is ""a bit like Appalachia and people around here can do foolish things."" The sheriff in the town - who isn't an evil character - allows one of his snitches (James Franco) to operate a large meth lab. It's a far cry from Sheriff Andy Taylor in Mayberry.

Here's something odd: The small town in which this movie takes place, Rayville, is almost three-quarters African American, but in this movie there is only one African American character. He's a good guy, by the way. In the school that the daughter attends, there are only white kids. From what I could find out from a little research, none of the filming took place in Rayville. It would be interesting to know why they decided to pick Rayville, an actual town, for the setting of this movie, when none of the filming took place there.

The end of the film confused me. Broker visits the prison to talk to the drug boss who ordered the hit on him and his daughter. He tells him, with a smile, that he'll be waiting for him when he gets out. This doesn't make sense for two reasons. First, even if the drug boss is in jail, he can order more hits on Broker and his daughter. Broker makes no effort to change his name or hide his identify, and he plans to stay in the same house and the same town, where he and his daughter will be an easy target. Broker is essentially declaring open war on the drug boss and his small army, and I don't care how tough the guy is, he's putting his daughter at great risk. The daughter is completely unprotected at the school she attends.

Second, why would the drug boss have any chance of getting out of jail? He's not in jail just on major drug charges. During the drug bust where he gets arrested, at the beginning of the movie, many law enforcement officers were killed. The drug boss was shooting along with the rest of his gang, so he should have a life sentence. Well, the obvious answer is that they wanted to leave it open for a sequel and they need the drug boss to get out of jail for the final showdown. I guess you could say there's a feud between Broker and the drug boss. If they make a sequel I might watch it if the gorgeous schoolteacher is in it (Rachel Lefevre).",1520380800,,2985,4.342293906810036

6156876,3,B00HEPCRLE,"A movie about a retired DEA agent who moves to a new location with his daughter to start fresh after a job gone bad. He gets mixed up with a local gang and as a result his enemies find out his location and come after him.

This almost feels like it could been 24: the movie with Statham playing a retired Jack Bauer. Unfortunately the story is really bloated with tons of characters who don't really matter in the story getting stuffed into the film. Franco is billed as the villain of the movie and but he really doesn't. He's just a low level drug dealer who contacts Statham's enemies to let him know where he is. After that he is pretty much a middle man character for the rest of the film.

Great actors like Winona Ryder, Frank Grillo and Kate Bosworth are wasted in the movie and don't do anything for large periods of story.

Should have had a lot more action and didn't need to be as long as it does. Movie really feels like it drags at points.",1479427200,,953,4.225274725274725

All the actors are convincing with magnetic personalities which pull you in & keep you interested in their plight and make you wonder how they are going to resolve their ever so complicated lives. The time goes by fast, a telling sign of a very interesting movie. I gave it a 4 because I reserve 5 stars for mega-favorites like Shawshank Redemption and A History Of Violence but this movie is quite capable of providing a good night of entertainment.

6157034,4,B00HEPCRLE,"Surprisingly well made and watchable tale of a retired DEA undercover agent (Statham) who relocates to a rural town, only to find himself surrounded by locals with bad intent and an imprisoned drug lord intent on exacting revenge.

Statham delivers a typical low key and mumbling performance, and is counterpointed by a capable supporting cast including James Franco cast as an aspiring local meth cook with an intermittent southern accent.  Of note also is Kate Bosworth, in a scene eating performance as Franco's loud mouthed yet well-intentioned sister.  Young Izabela Vidovic as Statham's daughter is a study in pint-sized maturity, and is a screen natural.

HOMEFRONT is a fast paced, energetic and fairly believable story with well drawn characters. Recommended, but not for kids. Violence, drugs, and extreme language.",1434931200,,825,5.372093023255814

6157054,4,B00HEPCRLE,"I liked this JayStay actioner but it was slower and less intense (and less brutal, which is a good thing I guess) than a lot of his other harder action movies.  Statham stars as a dad with a daughter, he an ex-DEA agent whos laying low because he offed the wrong bad guys kid.  His daughter, who knows how to defend herself, beats up one of the local bullies who is bullying her.  This sets off a chain reaction where the bullys mom (a strung out and nettery Kate Bosworth who does a great job here) gets her family to tangle JayStay up and cause them lots of problems, mainly by way of her drug dealing backwater bayou brother (played by a sketchy James Franco).  Franco is in no wise a physical match for JayStay and fortunately the movie doesnt try to make us think he is.  Instead Francos connections with the local bad guys and to the crime family that Statham is trying to avoid brings down all of the heat on cueballs head.  The story is a basic one, but the characters are more fleshed out than one might expect, the acting is pretty good, and the narrative manages to keep the tension in place.  His daughter, while she can defend herself fine against her peers, is no match for adult thugs with guns.  Fortunately, her dad is.  You know how it ends.",1430265600,,1259,4.323404255319149

As usual Jason Statham delivers when it comes to both acting and action scenes, but the plot was the weak point of the movie and the pacing was not good nor was the villiant ""impressive"" enough to warrant a thumbs up.  A few of the scenes added zero substance to the movie and the love interest between the father and teacher went nowhere. Also the corruption of the local police officer went no further than being mentioned by Statham's black friend.  Would have been a far better movie if Statham was actually pitted against the biker gang rather than a 2 bit criminal in a small town. Stallone dropped the ball on this movie.",1425945600,,674,4.553719008264463

6157149,5,B00HEPCRLE,"This was surprisingly very good. Jason Statham is right up there with some of my favorite actors such as Liam Neeson & Gerard Butler when it comes to a great action/thriller flick -you usually can't go wrong with either of these actors. Acting is solid and the film is also co-produced by Sylvester Stallone. Surprise cameos also include Winona Ryder and Clancy Brown (haven't seen them in anything in quite a while). I don't want to give it away so all I will mention is that if you are in to the type of movies where the good guy (in this case Statham) just want to be left alone to start a new life and raise their kid, but the antagonists continually come looking for trouble, then this is your deal. Love the confrontation/fight scenes, though I felt a few of them were filmed too fast to see what happened each time, but when it's Statham you know you are getting brute butt-kicking. Highly recommended if you are looking for a great film to watch. Saw OD and now am ordering from Amazon. This is an excellent price for this movie, especially on Blu-Ray.",1420329600,,1060,4.469072164948454

Jason plays Phil Broker who used to be an undercover DEA agent, he moves away with his young daughter but soon his past comes back to haunt him. He and his daughter have a run in with a family which then leads to other dangerous people getting involved.

The film has some excellent action scenes where Jason Statham literally just beats the hell out of everyone but it isn't a constant theme like some of his other movies. There is a bit of a drama feel to this as the story develops we learn quite a lot about his character. It's a slow burner in places but completely intriguing with great action here and there, especially the ending where all hell breaks loose.",1420156800,,743,4.463235294117647

But Statham as retired undercover DEA cop, Phil Broker, is convincing as a protective father and emotionally rousing in the manner in which he uses his wits and marshal arts skills to defeat and rescue his daughter from the bad guys.  I love it when a father fights for his daughter. That aspect alone will keep you engrossed in the butt-kicking action scenes and cheering for the hero.

Jason Statham plays his usual character, a man who just wants to be left alone and after a botched drug bust, decides to leave law enforcement and head into the swamp lands of Louisiana with his daughter. He soon runs into the family of backwoods bad boy James Franco who plays a greasy meth maker with a bad attitude. Franco is called into action by his drug addicted sister after Staham's daughter embarrassed her son and now they want Statham to leave town.
Throw in a semi corruptible sheriff, a biker gang and you have a body count in the bayou.  Like I said your typical Statham movie with a not so convincing Franco as a bad guy. This film would have been different with the roles slightly reversed as the same old characters that Statham plays in my opinion are getting old, but that's just me.",1419033600,,853,4.43312101910828

The only reason I think it did well or scored highly is because of all the cameos that are in it - and the actors are fine. But the reason why the movie is so bad is because the central character is so incredibly stupid making mistake after mistakes. I had to stop watching becuase I ended up hating the character so much I felt that he deserved to die at the hands of the villains.

In this movie, everyone acts fairly rationally based on their character and addictions etc except Jason Statham's character who is just stupid stupid stupid.

6157243,3,B00HEPCRLE,"Sylvester Stallone puts on his writing cap for this 2013 action/revenge yarn directed by the fairly unknown Gary Fleder and starring the Italian Stallion's best blockbuster bud, Jason Statham, and hilariously miscast James Franco as the backwoods baddie.  Franco actually provides one of the most stereotypical and dreary performances of his illustrious career.  Wynona Ryder also gets some limited screen time as the silver screen stoner's thieving, washed out girlfriend that is obviously a huge acting stretch for her.  The story is predictable and limited but delivers on Statham's signature brand of ""bad assery"" with a failed attempt at adding a romantic twist and familial back-story.  In the end, Rocky just tried too hard with too little to work with.  Of all the things he is known for, delicately yet effectively weaving an intricate tapestry of complex, intermingling storylines is definitely not one of his strong suits.  I know shocker, right.  But for what it is worth, if you are in the mood for a satisfying slug fest with plenty o' UFC throw down moves, machismo violence, and classic Expendable like one liners, this is the flick for you.  But would somebody please explain to Hollywood that F bombs do not equate to substantial script filler, I lost count quickly in this cinematic outing.  3 out of 5 Kernels; strictly judging it by a ""balls to the wall"", Statham smack-down, it is worth the price of rental or download admission.",1413072000,,1451,5.0125

I felt like it kind of ruined the story progress more than anything else. It was like they got to the end of filming and had a checklistto go over; ""good guy, check - bad guy, check - drama, check - explosion, check, - J.Statham beating people up in interesting ways, check - J.Franco making that 'I might be crazy' face that he does so well, check - sex scene, oh oops we forgot that, let's just add one here"".... -_-",1411689600,,699,4.384615384615385

6157263,5,B00HEPCRLE,"Home Front
  The movie Home Front is one of the best movies that has ever been made. It is the next stepping stone in this generations movie making. Its plot is really good, the acting in the movie is next to perfect, the movie lacks originality but if you can see past that than it is great.
 The plot of this movie is in my opinion extremely well thought out they went from beginning middle end very well. The transitions were very smooth from one scene to the next.  The beginning was good it was strong because it really made you have good connections with the characters, like it showed how close and strong the family was. The middle was great how it lead you up to the climax giving you many fore shadows that you later realized. The end was spectacular the climax was suspenseful and action packed I would tell you about it but you have to watch it to see for yourself. It literally will make you jump up off your seats because you're so excited. The very ending was a nice ending because everything fell into place.
 There are some pretty big names for actors in this movie. Like the famous James Franco, Jason Statham, and many others. These actors had very challenging roles in the movie. One good example is how James Franco was able to speak in a southern voice and made it sound very real. I truly felt like throughout the whole movie the characters connected with me in one way or another. When bad things happened I felt sad or when the antagonist was losing I felt a sense of joy. Also when there were exciting parts, it made me get excited, so in my opinion I think that the actors did a great job at portraying the movie.
 Home front lacks originality in the script. It is more of a generic type of movie in many ways. Like how they have the good guy and the bad guys. It has the single father with the little daughter because the mother passed away. It has the family moving into more of a rural area because they want to get away from the city life. These are very generic sequences that many top rated movies have. Now I am not trying to bash this movie in anyway, all Im doing is getting to the point that this movie isn't really original it is more generic. So if you happen to be someone like myself who is perfectly ok with generic movies than youll love this movie. But if you need originality in a movie than this is your warning to maybe not go and see this movie.
 Overall this movie was amazing, I would highly recommended this movie to anyone who loves badass characters. A great plot line that is really easy to follow. And a little lack of originality that is made up for with great action scenes. Now let me ask you what the best movie youve ever seen. Well take that movie throw it out of the trash because this will be on the top of your list.",1411603200,2,2780,4.253787878787879

6157299,4,B00HEPCRLE,"Okay. I know: Homefront isn't any kind of raving intellectual challenge.  Sure, we've all seen similar stuff before.  But I just really liked it.  I've watched it twice now and liked it as much the second time as the first.  Jason Statham is always at his best in these kind of one-man-against-the-world kind of movies.  While relatively predictable to a degree--maybe even a strong degree--Homefront was still fun for me just watching it being played out.  It is, after all is said and done, a rather standard revenge movie with the good guy getting to pound, shoot and otherwise maim the bad guys.  It's all done very well with James Franco and Kate Bosworth doing a fine job as the backwoods hicks.

If you like these kind of action flicks like I do, then I highly recommend it.  Home Front is no Godfather or even close to it, but it's just a fun-to-watch action flick.",1409961600,5,873,4.580645161290323

Only ""CRASH"" & ""TRAFFIC""  [recent Film History] have received award accolades, and neither had the number of subtle grandiose Thespian performances that this All-Star mega-drama Thriller generates!

Actor Jason Statham seems to migrate toward action packed melodramatic hero roles, and teaming with Sylvester [Writing & Producing] Stallone: Besson, Boaz Davidson, Robert Ortiz, Avi Lerner, and Director Gary Fleder, ""HOMEFRONT"" easily demonstrates what top-rated Movie professionals can turn out when all things come together...

I especially liked the girl's character. It's good to portray females, and children, as brave, resourceful people who do everything they can to help themselves and others. In the past, females and children in movies were often portrayed as passive helpless victims, often in a really heavy-handed, insulting way, whose only hope was to be rescued by a strong man. I also liked that in this movie, even very violent people can control their behavior to spare others from witnessing cruelty. Everyone needs good role models and movies are an excellent medium to show such models.",1407542400,,706,4.883333333333334
6157368,4,B00HEPCRLE,"Homefront may not break new ground, but Jason Stathams new film knows what it is doing, with lots of action and one-liners like Whatever you're thinking, rethink it. Helmed by Gary Fleder (whose previous works as director includes Runaway Jury Kiss the Girls and Dont Say a Word), Homefront is a slick action thriller even though you have to ignore its totally predictable and implausible storyline.

Jason Statham is a retired DEA agent Phil Broker, who decides to settle in a quiet Southern town with his 10-year-old daughter Maddy (Izabela Vidovic). But soon Phil gets entangled with a local drug dealer named Gator (James Franco). The chain of events leading up to the confrontation between Phil and Gator is unbelievable, but is done with enough fight scenes to keep the film interesting.

Based on a Chuck Logan novel and adapted for screen by Sylvester Stallone (who also co-produced), Homefront slightly reminds us of the old-school action movies in the 80s. I am not fully convinced of the characters and the storyline here, and the climax is pretty muddled, but all in all Homefront is an engaging ride.",1407542400,,1113,4.946524064171123

6157418,3,B00HEPCRLE,"This movie does not lend itself to deep analysis.  The plot is straightforward and there really aren't any major twists.  All of the characters are tropes:  the highly skilled, veteran policeman just trying to live a quiet life (but failing), the innocent daughter, the attractive female schoolteacher, the small town hicks fueled by vendetta, addicted drug addicts, a small scale drug dealer in over his head, a violent biker gang, and a vengeful crime boss attempting to exact revenge from behind bars.

Look, Homefront isn't anything special.  It's really nothing new but, to its credit, it does what it does competently.  The acting is fairly good, the film looks nice (and even has a unique scene transition approach where it shows flashes of the upcoming scene interspersed into the concluding moments of the preceding scene).  The first half is eminently watchable, although not intellectually stimulating.

The second half struggles somewhat.  It has the same pros in its favor as in the first half, but in the last half the viewer is able to see the seams holding everything together too clearly; the movie just becomes too predictable.  It also blunders into mimicking the plot of the movie Taken, albeit taking place here in a rural American neighborhood rather than across international venues.

One aspect of the film that is both implausible and somewhat laughable is how the lead protagonist has such bad luck that he keeps stumbling into meth baking operations--first in his undercover job, then ""by chance"" as a private citizen.  The plot needs this to be the case so that it can tie the two together and have his past come back to haunt him, but it stretches credibility.

So it is what it is.  I'm not going to tear it down.  Viewed on its own terms, it's fine.",1406073600,,1780,4.867109634551495

6157434,2,B00HEPCRLE,"This Sylvester Stallone scripted mess takes action star Jason Statham on a familiar path as a former DEA agent resettling in his late wife's rural Louisiana homeland.  Phil Broker (Statham) becomes disillusioned when his fellow agents gun down an already shot son of a drug kingpin.  Broker had infiltrated the gang and had set up the bust.  Sitting at home hoping her daddy would come back, I guess, was Broker's 10 year old daughter Maddy (Izabela Vidovic).

Broker decides to pull the plug on his career and retire(?)to Louisiana redneck country.  He buys and nice little house off a remote road so that Maddy can ride her horse and fish in a pond.  Well, wouldn't you know, the little town is flush with methamphetamine dealers and the big fish in this little pond is a guy named Gator Bodine (stop laughing).  Gator (James Franco) has the usual cadre of numbskulls working for him.  He's also the supplier to his `Twiggy'-thin tweaker sister, Cassie played by a you-have-to-look-twice Kate Bosworth.

When Maddy pummels a bully in the playground, Broker is threatened by the boy's parents who just happened to be Cassie and her Neanderthal hubby Jimmy (Marcus Hester).  That doesn't go so well for Jimmy, so now Broker is a marked man for revenge.  But Broker is no ordinary bloke.  He's...well, he's Jason Statham.  So how do you think this is all going to go down?  Yep, you're right.  Even when Gator calls in the cavalry - a score of biker goons - they are no match for our hero.

Don't get me wrong, I actually like Jason Statham and I love to see him kick evil-doer butt, but come on.  Give the guy something to work with.  Finally, I got a chuckle out of seeing poor Winona Ryder play a strung out biker slut and sometime Gator plaything.  Brother.  I suspect this film will have some appeal to Statham fans, no matter how bad the movie is, so watch it, if you must, on Blu ray.

The video is in 1080p resolution and has a 2.40:1 aspect ratio.  The transfer is pretty impressive.  Colors are warm and slightly muted for most of the scenes.  Skintone appear accurate.  You can see minimal variation, scene to scene.  A very nice picture.  The DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 track is excellent.  You might want to watch your volume from the opening scene.  It is very loud and it shut down my not quite warmed up amp trying to save my speakers.  The movie isn't all shootouts and bar fights however.  There are quiet moments between Broker and Maddy that are clear and distinct.  The surrounds are often brought into play, especially during the action sequences.  Subtitles are available in English SDH, Spanish and French.  Extras are few; some deleted scenes, an extended ending and a promo.",1405900800,2,2696,4.641949152542373

6157456,3,B00HEPCRLE,"How is it that Jason Statham has such a hard time getting good roles? People like him. He's about as good an action star as his contemporaries. Even this outing, while marginally better than some of his other films, falls short.

Here's the scoop. Statham plays a DEA agent who retires after a particularly nasty, violent sting and moves with his daughter to northern Louisiana where he hopes to live a quiet life. Fat chance. of that happening. It seems Meth is a big deal in those parts and events conspire to draw him into a situation he was trying to leave behind.

Sylvester Stallone wrote the script which was based on a novel. I haven't read the source so I don't know how far the script strayed, but it just wasn't that good. Things start off really well. The opening, partially failed sting. The switch to the more peaceful setting, as we watch his young daughter turn the tables on the bully, play well. But then things head south. The set-up to get the heat turned up held too much coincidence for my liking. That Winona Ryder agreed to such a small, sketchy role was curious. I kept figuring her part would escalate as the movie progressed. That it didn't helped to drag things down. I'm not a huge James Franco fan but this is about as good as I've seen him. Jason Statham didn't move out of his comfort zone but we really don't want/expect him to. There are some other established actors throughout that do well with what they're given.

Director Gary Fleder did a decent job here. Nice attention is paid to the locations and he draws some good performances out of people. I also liked Mark Isham's music score. It added flavor without making itself too conspicuous. To me this failed at the script level. The longer it ran the worse it got. This isn't a bad watch but it's a typical guy flick that doesn't manage to rise above the fray.",1405382400,,1851,4.486646884272997

Great acting. Plenty of suspense. Pretty violent so not for kids. Good Mixed Martial Arts (Brazilian Jujitsu, Kick Boxing and KALI) and lots of Fire Fights.

6157469,5,B00HEPCRLE,"Jason Statham is known for his action-packed/thriller films, and he is a household name in Hollywood and beyond.
However, over the past 2 years or so Statham has made in my opinion some poor action movies, with a very redundant and
almost boring topics...to name some: Safe (2012), Parker (2013), Redemption (2013)...even The Expendables saga is not
really all that good.  The story of Homefront (2013) might be a little clich for some, but overall the movie is interesting to watch.
Franco's and Ryder's supporting roles are very solid, and Kate Bosworth role as a drug addicted, white-trash redneck mother and sister of Franco is beyond belief great.  Its an all American story (southern-gothic, which is s popular genre these days), similar in many aspects to movies like: Mud (2012), Killer Joe (2011), Joe (2013), Out of This Furnace (2013), or the mini-series Banshee from 2013.

Totally recommend this one to Jason Statham or James Franco fans.",1405123200,,951,5.044585987261146

6157516,4,B00HEPCRLE,"When you combine Action with Drama, you had better have a damn good story to go along with the tremendous fight scenes and wild chases, or else you get a film that falls flat. We all know that at this point, Jason Statham is the best Action star you could have, but the jury was out on how effect he could be in a more dramatic role. In Home Front, Statham plays a retired undercover D.E.A. agent, who has recently become a single father. He and his daughter have moved from the big city to the small town, which his late wife called home, in the hopes of building a better life. Everything was going as planned until his daughter, stood up to a bully at school, and embarrassed the son of one the towns most influential families. The simple misunderstanding between children quickly escalates into an all out war, which will force Statham to use everything he learned in the D.E.A. to protect his daughter and his new home. Once again, Jason Statham was terrific in this film. It is mind boggling and seems to be impossible, but every film this man does is better than the one before it. He is on a winning streak, the likes of which I have never seen. Statham was terrific, but oddly, he's paired with an actor who doesn't have much experience playing the bad guy and it showed. James Franco plays Gator Bodine, a small time hood and drug trafficker, who goes after Statham with everything he's got, the only problem is, Bodine really isn't that bad a guy. In fact, when Franco starts cursing and playing all tough, it's almost laughable, not to mention the fact that he doesn't have a tenth of the fighting skills that Statham has. Being that this was a big budget film, Written by Sylvester Stallone (Rocky),  Directed by Gary Fleder (Kiss The Girls, Runaway Jury), and starting the best action star in the game (Jason Statham), it's very peculiar that they would choose a bad guy, who is best known as a comedic actor. While the story was great, Franco simply can not match up with Statham at all. Homefront has almost everything you could want in a Thriller, but the lack of a strong, believable opponent, really calls into question just how believable the film is and makes it somewhat predictable.",1404000000,,2205,4.540201005025126

6157556,4,B00HEPCRLE,"""Homefront"" is an excellent outing.  While the plot of ex-military/police retired in an out-of-the-way locale who runs into trouble from the past is not new, director Gary Fleder invests the characters in Sylvester Stallone's screenplay with depth and propels the pacing from start to finish.  The star Jason Statham turns in one of his best performances as the widower who loves his daughter and is making a new life for them.  Perhaps the surprise of the movie is Kate Bosworth who has the distinction of having been nominated as Best Actress for a Saturn Award (Science Fiction Academy) and as Worst Actress for a Razzie Award for the same film as Lois Lane in Superman Returns (2006).  She veritably steals the film.  As Cassie Bodine Klum, she is a spitfire tigress bent on backwoods retribution.  She spews insults at everyone in her way.  It is an edgy, last-nerve performance worth the price of the film.  Marcus Hester who plays the supporting role of Cassie's (Bosworth) husband, Jimmy Klum, also turns in a great performance as the backwoods husband who is both bully and coward.  Child actor Austin Craig has a great spin as the chubby bully who picks a fight with the wrong girl on the playground that ignites the fuse of action that follows.  Izabela Vidovic as Statham's daughter Maddy shows range and is a charming presence that warms the film.  James Franco does another bad guy role (reference Spider-Man 3) and combines a lethal smile with a stunning lack of character.  Rachelle Lefevre (Twilight/Under the Dome) adds some romantic potential for Statham.  Omar Benson Miller who was on CSI Miami does a great job as the handyman and loyal friend to Statham.  The deleted scenes on the DVD are interesting to show the director's choices on the final ending edit.  With such a strong cast doing top-level work, Fleder keeps the bar high and lifts this action-packed drama above the cut.  Enjoy!",1401753600,,1912,4.854938271604938

  HE IS A REGULAR GUY ONCE HE RETIRES FROM HIS JOB, TAKES HIS YOUNG DAUGHTER AND BUYS A NICE SPREAD OF PROPERTY WITH A BIG HOUSE AND  A BARN, WITH ROOM FOR RIDING THE HORSES HE HAS......BUT HIS PAST WILL CATCH UP WITH HIM.

 STATHAM HAS  MOVED HIMSELF AND DAUGHTER INTO  BAYOU COUNTRY AND QUICKLY LEARNS THE WAYS OF THE LAND IN THAT AREA.  IT ENDS UP BEING SOMETHING HE WAS PREPARED FOR......

APPARENTLY, ALA HATFIELD AND MCCOYS- THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS APOLOGIES OR FIXING MISUNDERSTANDINGS IN THIS PART OF  LOUISIANA.

 NOT TO MENTION IN A TOWN LIKE THIS, EVERYONE KNOWS EVERYONE.....
AND THEIR BUSINESS.

STATHAM IS WARNED THAT IN THIS NECK OF THE WOODS,FEUDS LAST FOREVER AND THEY JUST GET UGLIER WITH TIME.

6157584,3,B00HEPCRLE,"Stallone wrote the screenplay for this movie and I detected nuances of former Stallone movies in it.  Statham is a former undercover cop trying to escape his past and is a recently widowed father protecting his cute daughter (who knows some wicked hand-to-hand combat moves). Relocated to a remote Louisiana town, Statham is besieged by circumstance with the uncanny reappearance of the bad guys.  A new local bad guy is James Franco, who impressed me with the enormity of his badness glands. He is cooking meth to sell & also supplying his strung-out sister. Enter Ryder, lover of Franco, who just happens to be connected to Statham's former nemesis who is still in jail.

Statham's stature is so small that he is barely bigger than his daughter. This combined with his chronic sinus issues makes him a less than credible adversary to big, bad fighting guys. He takes them down - fast - when, in reality, they could lift him off his feet with one arm.

I disliked the movie overall due to its hackneyed storyline. When the name of Franco's character, Gator Bodine, was first mentioned, the first thing that popped into my head was Jethro from the Beverly Hillbillies TV show thereby diminishing the fearsomeness of his character by numerous degrees.  I appreciated Franco's versatility as an actor to play a credible bad guy, despite the unfortunate name, and Kate Bosworth does a fantastic job as his strung-out, confrontational sister.  I would not watch it if I had a redo choice.",1400889600,,1484,4.845849802371541

6157586,5,B00HEPCRLE,"As with most Hollywood action movies it was a bit predictable but they all are because Hollywood doesn't make movies to dazzle your mind they make them to dazzle your eyes and excite you.  The base of the story is one that has probably been done it a 100 action movies, but Jason makes the movie.  Was shot in Louisiana where it seems Jason has shot all of his latest movies, love the fact it wasn't shot in CA.  Lots of cool action scenes and the characters are played out pretty well by the actors overall.  The ending (no spoiler) actually did a double take making you think the movie was about to end when it kept going a bit more to end as we would expect.  I enjoy Statham movies cause he has that average American guy thing about him that makes you feel like, while he is a total Bad A#%, he could be you or anyone you know.",1400803200,,831,4.136645962732919

The plot and acting were good, but I just got SO sick of everybody using the ""F"" word.  I'm not a prude, mind you.  I am a middle-aged English teacher, but I happen to teach high school students who are on parole from jail.  I know people -- particularly this element of society -- use that word as a verb, an adjective, an adverb, and a noun, but not usually all in the same sentence.  Seriously, even if you're a potty mouth, I guarantee you don't use that word as much as they did in this movie.  It was enough to be distracting and even comical in spots.  This would have been a so much better movie if about half of the uses of that word were replaced with ANYTHING else.",1400457600,6,844,4.198757763975156

6157631,4,B00HEPCRLE,"Yes, there are a few flaws, but this movie is entertaining until the very end.  No slow spots.  No corny dialogue.  No forced comedy, like you see in a lot of action flops these days.

The daughter is not annoying or stupidly cute--just the opposite!  She is a character worth following.  She's believable, and that is refreshing.  Great new actress.

There is a pleasant hint of a love interest between our hero and his kid's psychologist, but no subplot that ruins everything with forced emotions and gratuitous sex just so the writers can create another pawn for the bad guys to kidnap, beat, kill, etc.  That lazy trope is avoided here.  In fact, since a relationship is hinted at, you often wonder if she is a plant for the bad guys.

This movie builds and builds and builds!  The tension hikes up logically and tragically.  The action is never over the top.  Every fight is realistic.  Every explosion is inventively induced.

The acting is superb.  Statham is an action superhero, of course, but his acting is top notch in this flick.  Frank Grillo and James Franco are two very different villains that get thrown into this mix, making for an exciting and unpredictable plot.  All because of one woman's lack of parenting skills and backwoods ignorance (Kate Bosworth plays the part perfectly).  Grillo is a frightening psycho.  Franco is a thoughtful, almost likable scumbag.

The characters change in this movie and/or they are portrayed with just enough depth that they feel realistic.  James Franco plays a more down-to-earth villain who you could definitely run into these days.  His humanity pops in and out of scenes, which is a nice touch.  His sister grows as a person.  Ryder's junkie ho is also teetering on the verge of humanity.  Believably.

The flaws?  Well, you might not agree, but . . .

1) James Franco vs. Jason Statham.  The final ""battle"" is kind of a letdown.  You hear so much about Franco's reputation.  It kind of felt like Robin fighting Thor.  Although, again, his character's depth is revealed.

2) The accents.  The movie can't decide if Statham's character is from Australia.  It reminds me of when they used to screw up films starring Arnold.  Likewise, Franco loses the southern accent often.  If you are portraying Southerners, keep the proper accent.  Only Statham's character's work buddy and the town sheriff keep it accurate the entire movie.

3) Long-haired Statham.  It looks so fake that I am pretty sure any MC would laugh and throw beer kegs at him.  They could have done him up better, grown out a beard, anything!  Keep him bald with a beard.  One tug on that shaggy toupee in a bar brawl and his cover is GONE.

4) Chuck Zito.  I am surprised at how much better an actor this guy is becoming.  What few may know is that he is a real deal Hell's Angel with PROBABLY a LOT of criminal experience.  He knocked out Jean Claude Van Damme in a night club.  He is a tough, frightening guy.  Why not use Zito in an epic fight scene!?!  He is a hulk of a guy with a REAL background in violence you and I can only imagine.

So . . . SEE THIS MOVIE NOW.  Is it worth buying?  Yeah, if you love Statham or action films with some thought put into them.  RECOMMENDED!!!!",1399766400,2,3209,4.582300884955752

6157633,3,B00HEPCRLE,"Statham makes the same movie over and over, but it's still fun to watch. One thing that always bothers me, though, is that DEA, CIA agents and ex-Special Forces agents always have an English or Austrian accent. Can't we find qualified Americans to fill these positions?",1399766400,,269,4.869565217391305

6157635,4,B00HEPCRLE,"It's Jason Statham - in motion of course.

Good modern-day plotline.  The bad-guys are really memorable.  (Like terribly, scare-ily memorable...  Perhaps because my wife is a teacher and grew up in Louisiana...)

Statham and daughter are under protective custody, hidden in rural Louisiana, where crime, drug labs, and stupidity run amok.  The badguys (and badgirls) get crosswise of Statham at school, at the gas station, at home, and (whoops) out in the bayou.  One surprise was that Clancy Brown (the ""Kurgan"" from the old Highlander movie) is the local Sheriff.

Lots of action, lots of language, and lots of poor, angry, drug-infused rednecks.  But may be too close to the truth...?

Not a chick-flick.  (Especially if said chick is from Louisiana...)

6157637,4,B00HEPCRLE,"Once again Jason Statham is back  as ex DEA agent Phil Broker trying to make a quiet life for himself and his young daughter and remain unnoticed. Unfortunately when his daughter defends herself against the town bully whose uncle happens to be the towns drug lord Gator Bodine played by James Franco, life becomes just a little more complicated. He tries to keep the peace going as far as apologizing for any misunderstanding but the bully's mother won't let it go. Once Gator learns who Broker is he calls on his sleazy girlfriend played by Winona Ryder to help him get rid of Broker. What they didn't count on was Broker's old enemy coming for him as well and when his daughter's life is endangered, Broker uses his considerable skill to protect her and his friends. The movie did get a bit slow and if you are a Statham fan, you will not be used to him being so tame as he tries to keep the peace. And while there is ample enough action as well a couple of surprises do not expect the high body count we are used to in Statham movies. Still it's worth sitting down to watch with a bucket of popcorn, it is after all Jason Statham.",1399593600,,1133,4.34433962264151

I wish Clancy Brown was more in the story. Clancy brown is one of the most under rated actors out there and his acting is always superb.

6157709,3,B00HEPCRLE,"This isn't a terrible film, but it's nothing special either. There is plenty of action since it is Jason Statham becoming very angry, stomping on the bad guys and saving his family. James Franco plays a great, creepy bad guy and Winona Ryder is busy being a sleazy ""trailer-trash"" gal.  This film won't be winning any awards, but watch it with no expectations and you will not be disappointed.",1398211200,,393,4.695652173913044

Proof:
Usual ex-military and/or ex-cop now retired with wife recently passed away and raising a young child (usually a teenage or younger girl); moves to rural or small town to escape the past. Gets on the bad side of the bad people and this script made sure we knew they were bad. Fights insurmountable bad peoples with help of brave daughter. Tiresomely, been done many times before cheap to make fast food fare for the masses. But, makes money. On the plus side the acting, bad people did their best to be really bad and good guy did his best to portray the best of the good, made viewing this a mindless ""black vs. white"" pablum - acceptable.",1398124800,,828,4.639455782312925

6157725,3,B00HEPCRLE,"I know what I'm getting when I buy these movies.  This is a Stallone product so action is a must and it had the story line that flows and somewhat predictable.  Great characters. Kate Bosworth was extremely impressive in her role,,,really the best of all the actors.  Statham, Stallone's, buddy did what he does well...deliver the action.  Good flick.",1398038400,,351,4.898305084745763
6157726,3,B00HEPCRLE,"I watched this simply for the lead actor. He never disappoints. However it seems odd that an english police officer would be working in New Orleans, LA and his accent certainly stands out against the back-woods accents of rural LA. Although you have a star-studded cast, the only one that made their role believable was Kate Bosworth (an angry redneck wife). Stereotypes of rednecks are getting a little old in film. It seems out of touch in a day where Duck Dynasty and other shows depict the softer side of the rural American landscape. Of course that doesn't make for a good action movie does it? One thing missing from this movie is the human side of the story. This is its shortcoming as the action is splendid but there should have been a reconciliation between some of the characters at the end.",1398038400,,802,4.615384615384615

6157730,4,B00HEPCRLE,"I went into this film not expecting much and I was pleasantly surprised by it. Jason Statham proves once again he's a  ""Bad A $$"" in these types of action movies. It's not original, it's not going to win an oscars, but Stallone can write these formula action movies in his sleep and they're entertaining if you're looking for some simple down home smack you in mouth kind of fun.

Do I need to explain the plot? I don't think so, but in a nutshell tough guy wants to live in peace but resident dirt balls just have a knack for finding him and provoking him. Protective father, ex NARC and recently widowed and moved to a small town full of inbreds....you get the picture?

For this type of film, you shouldn't be disappointed, great production, good action and cast and the Blu Ray looks great.",1397952000,2,794,4.424657534246576

He is capable of taking enormous amounts of physical punishment and immediately turn the tables to kill or maim everyone arounds.  Also typical scenario where he just wants to live somewhere and have a quiet life but the town meanies keep after him until he has to fight back.  Just another ""Walking Tall"" or ""Rambo - First Blood"" type of movie but with mediocre acting and story line.",1397865600,,536,4.680851063829787
6157732,5,B00HEPCRLE,"Jason Statham is his own franchise. His poise, style and presence is unique. This particular movie has the likes of a superhero action figure movie, but with no CGI, costumes or insane budget. Sometimes it is comical how Jason gets so banged up and beaten and he ends up putting on a tiny bandaid to heal him.  But, I was so impressed with this movie at many levels, here is why: 1. Star line-up where everyone delivers. 2. While it is an ""R"" due to violence, there aren't any unnecessary violence, blood or offensive gestures. Somehow every scene made sense and there were no out-of-place close-ups or graphical displays. But  remember, it is an ""R"" because there were a lot of well placed ""behind"" kicking and bashing. 3. There was grace and love throughout the movie. How do you incorporate that meaningfully without seeming cheesy into an action thriller movie? I don't know but Gary Fleder did. 4. Lastly, Sylvester Stallone did the screen play. He really likes movies with purpose and good will. This one was no exception.  An easy 5 stars.",1397865600,,1046,4.704918032786885

I have been following his movies since Transporter.  It is not a family movie.  There was too much video of the drug production and the one sex seen.  For only one scene, this could have been reduced and the amount of drug video and it would have gone a lot further to make this a family movie with young teens.",1397692800,,448,4.151162790697675

Although the story does have its flaws and some improbable moments that push the plot along (such as Gator finding the offical file of Broker in a box at his house), it does provide plenty of action to keep you interested all the way through.  Statham does his typical tough character that he has done before, but he does it very well.  Franco is ok as Gator but seems to switch from violent thug to more of a wimpy drug head at the end.  Would have been better if he maintained the tough persona that he started out with at the beginning of the movie.

Although not my favorite Statham movie (hard to top the original Transporter in my book) it does have plenty of action and just enough to keep you entertained all the way through.",1397606400,15,931,4.358381502890174

Jason is a retired DEA agent living in the country near a small town with his young daughter (wife was killed years ago).  He taught his daughter martial arts for self defense which came in handy when she was bullied by a classmate and she beat the young boy up.  This started the trouble for Jason --- the boys mother has a brother inlaw that is head of the local bad guys/drug dealer and she sics him on Jason.

All in all, even though the ending was fairly predictable, I found it entertaining and worth the watch.

It's Kate Bosworth that steals every scene as the vindictive meth addict who finds some humanity at the end. Izabela Vidovic is entirely convincing as the daughter and James Franco plays an excellent psychopath. It borders on super-hero but I guess we need that when the bad guys are as bad as these, as it sinks into our couch-potato minds that all will work out well in the end.",1397520000,,505,4.382978723404255

You kind of know the deal though...although Statham is actually a quality actor, his bread and butter are action films where he is somewhat troubled or otherwise not in the greatest personal situation, and he has to kick ### to make it better. So....you are definitely getting that here, and the action scenes are really cool. The story itself is fairly well lacking. It does have something of an all star cast, and everybody seemed to get into their roles quite well. Still, all things considered, I would say this is an average film...good for what it is, but not really noticeable overall if you look at the genre taken as a whole.

-The story was quite good. I think even without the intense action scenes, the movie would have still been enjoyable to watch because of the way the writers were able to thread the story together so well.
-While I haven't really cared for James Franco before, I think he did a good job with the psychotic, evil character.

Those were just a few bullet-points I had. Overall, the movie is intense, enjoyable, easily-understandable, and an inspiration to learn how to fight like ""Broker"".",1397260800,,695,4.840336134453781

6157789,3,B00HEPCRLE,It was ok. Typical not close to reality action movie.  Would recommend it though . J.S is pretty bad ass in this one.,1397088000,,117,4.086956521739131
6157790,3,B00HEPCRLE,"Well let me start by saying I liked the movie.
Yes, it has great fight scenes and action.
The first half really tries to give depth to the characters.
Then, in Stallone fashion, it falls into action cliche and predictability.
Listen, I like this movie. Keep it simple and you will too.",1397001600,,285,4.5

I thoroughly enjoyed this movie!",1397001600,,355,4.693548387096774

When does the man sleep? Starting to feel like a Kardashian but with talent; every time you turn around, there he is -  also had a different turn as the really, really bad guy. I can smell the sawdust and hear the hammering of Sly Stallone's creation but it was serviceable at the same and, anyway, it's pretty hard to screw up a Statham action character if you let him do his thing.",1397001600,,548,4.121495327102804

6157800,5,B00HEPCRLE,"Jason Statham has definitely, in my book, made a name for himself when it comes to performing in action filled movies! He is one amazing athlete! Of course, he is more than attractive! I never second guess my decision to see or rent a movie that has his name on it!  I absolutely love him!  Not only because he's gorgeous, but because there is depth to his performances and a certain kind of almost shyness about him.  Homefront as action from the beginning to the end.  A man who is ready to protect the most important person in his life, his daughter, at any and all cost.",1396828800,,574,4.336448598130841

I understand the need to be real and gritty in telling a story like this, but it was just too much. I wouldn't recommend it to a friend when there's so many better choices that don't assault my ears. Hope that helps.",1396742400,,389,4.735294117647059

Seriously, I get that there's trashy people out there that talk like that, but couldn't a movie try to escape it just a little bit?  What little of the plot I observed seemed like a stereotypical hero vs corrupt town rehash; not enough to keep my interest.  Waste of money...",1396656000,4,432,4.296296296296297

He gets in a bad bust and quits and goes off the grid until he is discovered. Bad guys want revenge. What puts this a little above? Of course, Jason Statham, need I say more. Winona Ryder, what a wonderful surprise. Ok, wait for it....James Franco....what a GREAT bad guy. I totally loved and hated (he's a bad guy) his performance was oddly adorable and very menacing, I'm sayin'.  Jason, though, broods too much, sometimes. Did I mention the annoying daughter and I do get you need something to protect, but do they always have to be, well, annoying?  Let's try a son, next time. Best line by Statham is ""whatever you're thinking, re-think it"" loved it.",1396569600,,812,4.711267605633803

It didn't bother me, but kept having to make sure our 6 yr old was outside playing so she didn't hear the language.  I really enjoyed the Winona Ryder in her role.  I didn't even recognize her at first.  I recommend this movie to anyone.  If you like Jason Statham you'll love this movie",1396396800,,424,4.2375

Lately we feel as if his movies are lacking in a well written story line and sometimes feel as though we just wasted time in our life by watching his movie. We actually did not have high hopes for this movie but we were very blown away by the nicely written story line and the cast. Statham was not the only star in this film that we loved. James Franco and Kate Bosworth were definitely our favorites in this movie as well, they definitely sold their roles to the audience. The only complaint we had was that it could have tied together better in the end. Just kind of left off and we were left to wonder if one character made it and what happened to the other family. I would recommend this.",1396396800,,755,4.25

This movie isn't perfection, but if you like Statham movies, it's worth the time. Acting is pretty good, his daughter's part was well played and the story line was pretty good too.

6157859,3,B00HEPCRLE,I thought it was a typical Statham film in that it is action packed and causes the viewer to pay attention in fear of missing something.  Not great for story line but a real shoot-em-up.,1396310400,,186,4.314285714285714

6158020,2,B00HEPCRLE,"No spoilers, the plot and my thoughts.

I love Statham movies. I enjoy car chases, non-stop action and an anti-hero. I easily suspend disbelief when an action hero walks away from a car crash which would result in serious injury or death in real life. This is what an action movie is. The bullets must miss the good guy.

In Homefront I could not get around how weakly this story was put together. Statham is a former DEA agent who was undercover in a motorcycle gang. When the drug deal goes down, he leaves the job. Does he disappear? Kind of. He changed his name, but stayed in state. He moves a town over and keeps his personal files with his identity and passport in his home. This is a lazy narc or a bad writer. You decide.

I also find it hard to swallow when the story tells us a tweaker (Winona Ryder) and a cooker (James Franco) partner to trade the narc's real identity for a larger meth market by calling in the bikers he helped jail. The meth cooker already has the town sheriff in his pocket. Now he wants to start a war? That isn't good for business. Especially if you are using a meth head to broker the deal and act as liaison with the outlaw bikers.

And another meth head, the cooker's sister facilitated this entire silly scenario because the narc's daughter tuned up her son. She wants vengeance so after asking her bro for meth, she asks him to make Statham pay for dishonoring her family. Her husband isn't man enough to properly punish a Statham so Franco has to be able to get her junkie self esteem jacked up through revenge butt kicking.

This movie was ridiculous. I have been under the assumption that James Franco is a renaissance man. I guess Michelangelo made a few bad sculptures and paintings too.",1395446400,,1732,4.41692789968652

6158023,3,B00HEPCRLE,"Homefront is a thriller about a man who will go to dangerous extremes to protect his family. Phil Broker (Jason Statham) is an ex-DEA agent whose desire for the quiet life has taken him, along with 10-year-old daughter Kit, to a small Louisiana town to settle down.

When Kit inadvertently precipitates a chain of clan violence, Broker must draw upon the deadly skills he hoped to keep in his past and deal with local crime lord Gator Bodine (James Franco). Bodine runs a boat-repair business thats merely a front for his lucrative meth lab, and he has the towns sheriff on the payroll.

Though its initially strange to see Franco in a villainous role, he plays it straight, with a crazed, megalomaniacal gaze that has a withering effect on everyone except Broker. As for Statham, this is standard-issue for him, as before long hes taking on the bad guys single-handedly, showing them through bloodied heads and broken appendages that crime doesnt pay.

The story finds Statham as a DEA undercover cop who,with his colleagues,manages to take down the head of a notorious biker gang in a big drug bust. Unfortunately the biker's son dies in the take down and vengeance is now on the menu.
Fast forward two years and Statham is living on an old plantation with his soon to be 10 year old daughter;his wife having past away a few months before. He makes a living now doing house renno's. One day at school his daughter is forced to punch out a bully and he,along with the bully's parents, are summoned to the school. The bully's parents are not too happy,and in fact the mother is overly upset with Statham. Outside the father attempts to teach Statham a lesson but he is taken down in short order.
The mother is not finished yet,as she goes home and enlists the help of her brother. He happens to be the area's king pin drug maker/seller. While Statham and his daughter are out riding he enters their house and finds some incriminating files linking Statham to his DEA days and the take down of the aforementioned biker gang. Before he leaves he slashes a tire,takes their cat and leaves a now-messed up stuffed animal hanging in a tree.
The drug dealer,knowing the gang and their connections,tries to leverage a bargain with them. In exchange for the location of Statham,he wants to be given total distribution rights for his drugs in that area. The gang arrives but aren't too interested in the drug dealer's bargaining rights. They want and get the location of Statham. By now Statham has been put on the alert as to what might be coming and he and his daughter are packing to get away from their home. Before they can they are jumped and a gun fight ensues. Statham's daughter has alerted the cops by cell phone and by the time they get there Statham has all but finished them all off. However his daughter has been captured by the drug dealer's moll and she is heading back to the dealer. When she arrives back at their hideout he is none too happy that she would bring the girl with her.
When Statham realizes where his daughter may be commandeers a police car and races to the scene. Before he can get there the drug dealer's sister(the one who set his involvement in motion in the first place)has arrived. When she throws on the lights to the hideout the light bulbs,which had been previously sabotaged by Statham,explode and set the place alight. The sister struggles to take the girl from her brother and he shoots her by accident. He takes the girl in his pick up and he lets out just as Statham comes in. Statham pursues him onto a moving bridge over a river. Statham has flipped his police cruiser and as the drug dealer approaches he is still trapped. As Statham's daughter's pleads for him to let her father go,Statham becomes free. He takes down the dealer once and for all,as the police look on,on shore. The film ends as Statham and his daughter finally settle in to their new life. However Statham pays a visit to the biker he took down those many years ago,in prison. The biker is speechless as Statham tells him when he gets out,he will be waiting for him.
The film moves along very well and there are very few let ups any where,as each plot detail dove tails into the other. Mr. Stallone and Statham have become very good friends since their collaborations on the Expendables,and this movie was certainly tailor made for Statham. Statham has all his usual moves you come to expect and he even has some chance for some dramatic moments. That being said,I found that Statham seemed to be looking a little,ummm,tired...if that's the word? More times than not it seemed like he was going through the motions. But the plot and editing being what it was,nicely glossed over any weaknesses. Winona Ryder plays the drug dealers moll/girlfriend. I didn't even recognize her right off and cannot say I was particularly impressed by her acting at all. Finally I must mention Clancy Brown's nice turn as the town sheriff.
Technically speaking the film is in its original a/r of 2:40:1 and is clear and crisp. There are no extras,which I thought was somewhat of a cheat. I'm sure there must be some interview material with Mr. Stallone and Statham somewhere that could have been included.
All in all a nice dramatic piece. It is full of action and tension and Mr Stallone has written a nice screenplay,tailor made for its star.",1395360000,,4634,4.645554202192448

Like stretch their acting muscles. About a millimeter. In a bankable direction.
To be fair, if i was a kid today, maybe I would have liked it? Maybe? I mean, Sly is a legend. And the Stogie, well, he's a legend too. All the winding and the innuendo. It's great to watch the boys react to each other's subtle facial cues, it does constitute a more meaningful acting exercise than say, the Expendables. But when does this stuff get to the end of the line? The Cruel Boss punishes the Helpless Innocent who Keeps On Going until finally, against all odds, against all logic, the Innocent Gets His Way and triumphs over the Cruel Boss, before Hasta la Vista-ing him. Somehow, even as a kid, i get the feeling I might have been able to see through it- the manufactured stereotypes, the predictable plot, the utterly wooden acting on the supporting roles. And for guys in their seventies, gosh, one might hope, I might hope, that they might cough up something better. But maybe like a western, it's  the genre of action adventure that refuses to die. And these guys just ride the train.",1395360000,,1285,4.468085106382978

6158071,5,B00HEPCRLE,"Full disclosure:  Both my wife and I really like Jason Statham, even though much of his movie credit is associated with violent action flicks; we thoroughly enjoy watching his impressively staged moves.  This movie is not much of a departure from most of the Statham fare, although it is all shot in the Southern US...and eclectic mix of his near cockney accent with the good old boy redneck drawls of the deep south.  If you are a Statham fan, this too will please.  If you are waiting for Jason to get in touch with his softer side...this one is not it.

The only disappointment for me:  I also am a huge fan of Rachelle Lafavre and would like to have seen her with a bigger part and more full developed interpersonal relationship for her character with that of the one played by Statham.",1395187200,,790,4.489510489510489

His past history unfortunately catches up with him and he is forced to deal problems in a calculated but (UN) Jason Statham type movie way.
I enjoyed the movie from start to finish Stathams action sequences although less of a forefront to the movie and James Franco I think has found a nice niche in playing the bad guy in this one he comes off convincing of a less than favorable character to have to deal with while still trying to have a family to take care of.

6158114,5,B00HEPCRLE,"It's Jason Statham movie time. You've read the other reviews so the plot is somewhat revealed but it doesn't relieve the pressure cooker intensity of this fabulous action thriller.  Directed by Gary Fleder who honed his craft on such up and coming titles as 'KISS THE GIRLS'-1997 and 'RUNAWAY JURY'-2003 piles on the ominous atmosphere with great set pieces. It also helps that he has a great ensemble of actors along for the ride.  James Franco plays his villainous Gator Bodine role as an intelligent misfit surrounded by a den of backwoods denizens under his drug controlled empire unfortunately the great Clancy Brown has very little to do as the sheriff on the take.  Although Jason Statham is front and center , the excellent screenplay by Sylvester Stallone based on a novel by Chuck Logan lets the female roles outshine the proceedings:  Winona Ryder is wonderful as Franco's motorcycle mama partner looking like she just walked off the set of Kurt Sutter's 'SONS OF ANARCHY'; Kate Bosworth emerges as the films scene stealer as Franco's cokehead sister who sets the plot in motion and unfortunately, Rachelle Lefevre who is shining on the Stephen King television hit 'UNDER THE DOME' goes the way of Clancy Brown as having very little to do as a possible love interest for Statham.  It is Jason's show all the way and thankfully the photography by Theo Van De Sande plays up the snap/crackle violence when it erupts. The Blu-ray is presented in a flawless 1080P widescreen transfer  although skimpy on the extras department with a 3 minute(?) behind the scenes blink or you'll miss spot and  a theatrical trailer plus trailers for other Universal releases.  In short, a superb adrenalin rouser for Statham fans.",1395100800,6,1720,4.927335640138408

6158194,4,B00HEPCRLE,"Note: May contain spoilers. Proceed with caution.

Over the years, my strategy with Jason Statham films has changed drastically from I need to see this to Ill just wait for the movie to be released on DVD/Blu-Ray. Although Ive always loved the dramatic tension Statham brings to his violent action-thrillers, the movies themselves have become very hit or miss over the past two or three years. This resulted in me being pleasantly surprised with his last film, Redemption, and I found myself singing a similar tune after watching his latest thriller, Homefront. With a solid cast, a surprisingly tender story, and some intense action sequences, Homefront proves itself to be a worthy addition to any fan of Stathams work.

Phil Broker (Statham) is an ex-DEA agent and ex-soldier. After the passing of his wife, Broker and his daughter, Maddy (Izabela Vidovic), move to Minnesota, where they plan to start fresh. Unfortunately, after Maddy puts the school bully in his place, his parents get furious, and his mother, Cassie (Kate Bosworth), contacts her brother and drug trafficker, Gator (James Franco). What begins as a small family feud soon escalates into more as Brokers past demons come back to haunt him, and in their wake is a stream of death and destruction. With a young daughter to think about, Broker must confront these demons while avoiding unnecessary harm to those around him.

Although it may not be intentional, a major part of the story revolves around family, and learning to let go of minor differences. From the moment he steps into his new life, Broker is told by multiple peopleincluding Sheriff Keith Rodrigue (Clancy Brown) and Tito (Omar Benson Miller), Brokers friend from workthat people in town hold grudges. With the loss of his wife, Broker just wants to have a normal, comfortable living with his daughter, but this family and their grudges make his transition difficult. Originally, Gator has nothing against Broker because he doesnt know who he is, but he feels obligated to help his sister. I found that this aspect of the narrative provides some unique insight into the human psyche and how we chose to justify our actions.

The premise, while simple, manages to make itself so enjoyable because it attempts to bring a more humane element to these extremely violent situations. Similar to Redemption, the narrative never feels like a flimsy set-up used to create just another action film; there are personal differences that manage to get out of hand, and both parties are acting out due to their very different feelings towards their families. Broker is looking out for his family while Gator is acting out because of his. Their motives are different, and this is shown in the way they handle themselves individually and when they're together on-screen.

Still, a Statham flick wouldnt be a Statham flick without some crazy action sequences and some equally crazy schemes, and Homefront isn't lacking in either category. Whether Broker is taking down dudes at the gas station, or plotting on Gators safe house, Homefront is intense, its thrilling, and its a pure adrenaline rush. Part of this is accomplished through some extremely eerie music, which was composed by Mark Isham, but Homefront also manages to have some surprisingly solid cinematography, as well. The shaky cam that seems to plague 99% of all action movies is all but absent in here, and if this annoyance was present, I didn't notice it. The fight scenes may not have broken new ground, but they were essentially more or less what weve grown to love from Statham.

Finally, the performances, while not a major standout of the film, are strong when they needed to be, but they could have been better. Statham himself has characters like Broker down to a science, so he didn't really bring anything new to the table. He did excel in certain scenes, but it was more or less the same old same old, unfortunately. Similarly, Izabela Vidovic wasn't too impressive either. She managed to pull off a decent Statham impression, but the further you got in the story, the more generic her character became. The real accomplishment, for me, was Mr. James Franco. From his very first scene until the rolling of the credits, Franco was this intimidating, menacing badass, and it was so fun to watch. Every once in a while Franco receives a role that truly exemplifies his ability as an actor, and Gator is one of those roles.

Overall Score: 7.9/10 - As an action-thriller, Homefront never breaks any new ground, but that doesnt stop it from being a complete blast from start to finish. The somewhat personal narrative is woven perfectly with the action sequences, which allows the film to progress at a nice pace, and its length feels perfect for the story they are trying to tell. There were certain areas that could have been improved, but for what it is, Homefront is worth the time if you're a fan of Stathams work, or if you want to see James Franco give a stellar performance as Gator.",1395014400,,4982,4.888757396449704

6158196,5,B00HEPCRLE,"Philip Broker (Jason Statham, ""Safe, ""Crank"", ""The Transporter"" trilogy) is a retired DEA agent forced to walk away from a drug bust that went sour, resulting in the death of a suspect's son. He takes his little girl and moves to Louisiana to give her a better life. That promise is short lived when a schoolyard bully tries to take her on, and he loses. The boy's trailer trash parents refuse to let the incident go, and this stirs up more trouble for Broker. They are connected to the local drug scum (James Franco, ""Rise Of The Planet Of The Apes, ""Spider Man"") who thinks his mind games are going to intimidate Broker. A crony (Winona Ryder) snitches on Broker to a biker gang he smashed through infiltration and all hell breaks loose. There is only one problem: Broker intends to give these trash all the hell they want and smash their drug operation at the same time. Only in this case, Broker will make sure that nobody EVER forgets it! Don't mess with Broker's little girl! Believe me, EVERYBODY gets an ass kicking!

6158241,3,B00HEPCRLE,"Let me preface my review by saying I'm a huge Jason Statham fan who has followed his career path since he debuted in 1998 in Guy Ritchie's ""Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels"" and anticipate each new film of his with baited breath.  This film is not on par with his other efforts from last year, ""Parker"" and ""Redemption"".  This is not to suggest that Statham is not trying to extend himself as an actor  because he demonstrates terrific range particularly in the tender scenes he shares with the young actress playing his daughter.  It's just that this film is so clichd and predictable.  There's nothing wrong with formula if it works but Sylvester Stallone's script is so rife with convention that a sense of deja vu starts to permeate the proceedings.  James Franco as the meth dealer appears to be sleepwalking through this one seemingly effected by being in every other film last year and taking too many film classes.  The most interesting thing about his character is his name, Gator Bodine, which suggests Burt Reynolds and Max Baer, Jr.  Winona Ryder is completely clueless as Franco's white trash girlfriend.  The best supporting performance is offered up by Kate Bosworth as Franco's drug addict sister.  A thought.  Statham has established himself as a reliable box office draw here and internationally.  Isn't it time he directed himself?",1394928000,,1354,4.916299559471366

6158356,1,B00HEPCRLE,"I can't believe I'm the first to give it only One Star.  This film is really not a ""thriller"" and the ""action"" scenes are second rate.

Here are the surprises in the movie:

(1) Sylvester Stallone wrote the script, and was one of the producers, and is personal friends with Jason Statham. So how could this be such a bad movie?  (See below.)

(2) The plot holes are big enough to drive a redneck double wide through.  First, Statham is an undercover NARC who decides to go into witness protection in Louisianan?  In a town where everyone is suspicious of all ""outsiders""?  And where a major drug operation going on?  Did no one in the DEA do research on this town?

Second, Statham buys a fixer-upper, but doesn't have the sense to put video cameras and motion detectors around the property?  With today's high tech, as soon as some one stepped foot on his property his IPad would have buzzed and he would instantly see who it is.  This is a no brainier.

Third, who goes off and does not lock their front door?  And not have an internal alarm system with a 160 decibel blaster?  Nope, the bad guy just walks in the open front door and takes his time searching the place.

NOW HERE IS THE REALLY BIG PLOT CRAPOLA:  Forth: This NARC (Statham), who is in hiding, has take his files with him! I mean the files that are used in prosecuting the drug lord he busted -- and he also took his undercover file!  Pictures and all!  And guess where they are?  In the basement in cardboard boxes!  That's right, not in a safe, not hidden behind a wall, but right out in the open in the basement.  Of course the bad guy goes through the unlocked top secret boxes and discovers the real identity of Statham.  Duh.

(3) Poor Winona Ryder.  She is given first female billing, but she is really third.  What happened to her career?  She must have been desperate for cash to take this role.

(4) And what happened to Kate Bosworth?  She is unrecognizable.  She needs to eat a few Big Macs and drink about 6 milk shakes a day.  She is so skinny that she has no breasts.  Maybe that's why she gives a hysterical performance.

(5) James Franco plays James Franco -- that's no surprise.  He plays the same person, with different dialog, in every movie.  And it seems he makes about 12 movies a year.  In this movie, you just don't buy the fact that he is a big time -- super dangerous -- drug manufacturer in the redneck south.  He's a small skinny guy that Statham could lightly bitch slap and that would be the end of it.  Very poor casting choice.

(6) Jason Statham: If you are looking for the Statham in the Transporter series, he's not here.  There are no great choreographed action scenes where he takes on 6 to 10 bad guys.  He can barely handle 3 out of shape rednecks who have no martial arts skills.  And the ending is just stupid.  No tension, no excitement.  Chase the bad guy, get the bad guy, movie over.

I like Statham movies, but this one, and Parker, and The Bank Job should be erased from his resume.",1394582400,5,2997,4.34963768115942
6158357,3,B00HEPCRLE,"James Franco is a great actor, and Jason Statham generally makes badass movies.  Unfortunately, the movie overall added up to meh.  Not bad, pretty watchable, but not especially clever by action movie standards.  This probably would have fit fine into a 45 minute TV show and been pretty exciting.  As a movie it's a thin, drawn out plot line leading to a passable stuff-blows-up kind of ending.",1394582400,3,395,4.850746268656716
6158358,5,B00HEPCRLE,Has action and family values. It is good to see a child who has a parent who is being a parent. It is also good to see a child who follows directions.,1394582400,,150,3.71875
6158359,4,B00HEPCRLE,"Chuck Logan's novel has been transformed into a screenplay by Sylvester Stallone and as directed by Gary Fleder the end result is a tense, rapid paced thriller. Set in the smarmy swamplands of the Bayou, a location that adds immensely to the atmosphere of the drama, this is a film that for some reason was overlooked in the theaters (likely a timing release problem). It is full of fine ideas and is brought to life by a very strong cast of well known and not so well known but very competent actors: with Jason Statham at the helm we can be assured it will be a action packed brutal survey of crime and its manifestations.

Phil Broker Jason Statham is a former DEA agent who has gone through a crisis after his action against a biker gang went horribly wrong and it cost the life of his boss' son. He is recently widowed and is left with a 9-year-old daughter, Maddy (Izabela Vidovic), and deciding to step out of the dangerous life of a NARC agent he moves to his deceased wife's quit town for Maddy's sake. Maddy draws attention when she has a confrontation with the school bully (Austin Craig) whose parents (Marcus Hester and Kate Bosworth - in a surprisingly fine role) cause trouble setting into motion a series of events that ends in his direct confrontation with the local Meth drug lord Gator (James Franco - excellent!) whose addicted sister happens to be Kate Bosworth. Broker's past history with the biker gang also enters the arena, making matters more complex. But he has a mission in his mind to protect his daughter and he is ready to pay any cost that it demands, despite the fact that the local sheriff (Clancy Brown) is in cahoots with the Meth gang. One of Gator's kind, Cyrus (Frank Grillo) and his girlfriend, the sleazy Sheryl (Winona Rider), are brought into the picture to kill Broker, a kidnapping takes place and an attack on Gator's Meth lab ends in a whale of a combustion that only lights up the surprising final scenes.

Yes, this is a rather grisly film about a disturbing subject, but the performances by Statham, Franco, Bosworth, Ryder, Vidovic, Susan Hetch as the school psychologist and love interest, and Grillo are excellent and the supporting cast is rich in terrifying characters portrayed by a fine supporting cast. Action plus! Grady Harp, March 14",1394582400,22,2294,4.661728395061728
6158360,4,B00HEPCRLE,This movie was much better than I expected.  Great acting job by the daughter.  This is the kind of show people need to see.,1394582400,,124,4.125
6158361,3,B00HEPCRLE,"If you like Jason Stathem movies then this is for you.  Same thing.  Something bad happens to him or someone he is involved with, he is a former soldier.  He uses those skills to kill everyone blah blah blah.",1394582400,,208,4.282051282051282
6158362,2,B00HEPCRLE,"Briefly, though very well made within the context of its ilk, Homefront leaves nothing for the range of character possible for
Statham to put his teeth into.  Admittedly, this is why I watched this film and expected more for his talents within the genre he's suited for.  The rugged macho individualist here has only one predictable, vapid, dimension sans resonance.",1394582400,,366,5.083333333333333
6158363,4,B00HEPCRLE,"..and he wrote a pretty good one. Jason Statham was great, as always. As a matter of fact I think he continues to become a better actor, far beyond the MMA stylistics he is known for; reminds me of how good he was in Lock, Stock (1998!, so long ago..). To that point, it is clear that writing makes an enormous difference. Statham shows up, regardless of the script, but in this case he was able to shine a bit more brightly - the writing here was quote good. He may well have a great older-gentleman career ahead, ala Michael Caine. Sure, it's a ways off, but with movies like this he serves himself, and his fans quite well.
There were some holes here and there, such as the complete absence of an alarm in the house of someone under witsec protection, or a former deep-cover DEA agent trying to live a ""normal"" life. Overall this movie was solid, including some very, very good acting by Kate Bosworth. Winona Rider turned out some great scenes as well (good to see her, it's been a while). James Franco played his character very well; not being from the deep-south-along-the-bayou myself, I have no idea of accuracy, but he definitely nailed the stereotype. Regarding stereotypes, it was nice to see the sheriff's character fully redeemed at the end*. Early on we were led to believe he was corrupt and would side with the locals, but slowly his true nature revealed (the dumping of the whiskey poured by Franco). Ultimately good triumphed! Also good to see was the commonplace love-story angle placed on the back-burner. The school psychologist seemed likely to have a bigger role, maybe protecting or watching the daughter. Rather than go that way the story stuck to the main plot points; credit due to Stallone, thus the title of this review. Good stuff!

*the sheriff's redemption here reminded me of 'First Blood' (1982) - wow, has Stallone had a great career, with the original Rocky from 1976 - also his script, and his huge breakout role. He actually started, so says iMDb, in 1970. That's, well, let's see here, carry the one - that works out to 44-years (and counting)! Wait, is that right?! Despite this review, I am not his biggest fan, not even close. But wow, you have to respect all of the work he has done.",1394582400,,2226,4.592964824120603

After his actions caused the death of a biker gang leader's son DEA agent Phil Broker (Statham) and his 9 year old daughter decide to move and start their life over. Things are going OK until Maddy stands up to a bully at her school. This little event starts a chain reaction that involves local drug dealer ""Gator"" Bodine (Franco) and brings up Phil's past that he was trying to run from. Before I start I have to admit that I am a Jason Statham fan so that may affect my review. On the other hand even though I like him he pretty much does the same movie over and over. That said this one is different from the others...for the most part. The movie makes you feel tense and on edge almost the entire time because of the fact that the daughter is in the middle of what is happening. Even though James Franco is the ""bad guy"" in the movie Kate Bosworth is really the one to watch. Her character is the reason I felt tense and is the scariest of all of them. The movie is very believable and the fact that nothing is too over the top makes it that much more tense. A mother upset about her son getting beat up (even though he started it) sets off a dangerous chain of events when she wants revenge. That could happen. Overall, tense and exciting, one of Statham's best. I really liked it. I give this a B+.",1394409600,,1354,4.1915708812260535

Statham's character Phil Broker takes his young daughter and moves to a small town in Louisiana after a drug raid goes bad while he is undercover with the DEA and one of the big shots son gets killed.

He finds more trouble in his new town in the form of Gator Bodine played by James Franco,of course Phil has no problem kicking any butt that crosses his way and the story gets deep when Gator breaks into Phil's house and finds a folder that contains his DEA info and he has ties to the guy who's son was killed In the raid.

This is not your typical Statham movie that is filled with non-stop fighting and shooting. It does have those scenes, but it has a lot more of a good storytelling aspect to it. This movie gives you just enough action to remind us of what we already know, that Jason Statham is one bad man! I hope that he makes more movies like this. The end of the movie leaves you thinking that there might be a part 2?",1393372800,3,487,4.126315789473685

6158508,4,B00HEPCRLE,"Warning: Spoilers ahead!

The first 10 minutes were convincingly scary and realistic. Two primary school students fought with each other. The mother of the boy who was beaten talked her husband and brother into taking revenge by beating the father of the winning kid. Kate Bosworth was very persuasive in her role as the troublesome mother.

Izabela Vidovic was lovely, warm and convincing as Jason's daughter. However, this love angle was just briefly depicted.
James Franco was frightening as a bad guy. Jason and other actors were also persuasive.

Jason's hand-fighting scenes were electrifying, quick and decisive.

The last 20 minutes were full of breath-taking suspense and gut-wrenching emotion.

There are some big and outrageously illogical holes that reduce this movie's entertainment value a little bit. For example Jason was extremely confrontational to everybody to the point of being extremely rude. I am sure no ex-cop wants everyone to hate him like this character.

According to boxofficemojo dot com, below are the financial figures of the film:

Production Budget: $22 million
Domestic:  $20,158,898
+ Foreign:  $11,200,000
= Worldwide:  $31,358,898

In short, it is satisfactorily entertaining if you can ignore the illogical holes.",1392163200,3,1253,5.473958333333333
6158509,5,B00HEPCRLE,"Let me start by saying that Jason Statham and James Franco are two of my favorite actors.  That alone is good enough to merit at least 4 stars before I even see the movie!  The fact that this was written by Sylvester Stallone might turn a few people off.  I mean, let's be honest,...he's not exactly known lately for his uber quality in movies!  HOWEVER, this one is FANTASTIC!!!!

*******WARNING,.....If you continue to read I might spoil the movie (although I will try to leave as much out as possible)!*******

The movie begins with Phil Broker (Jason Statham) as an undercover officer who has worked his way into the role of a leading man in a biker gang known as the ""Outcasts"".  These guys are heavy hitters in the drug trade and he has set the stage for the DEA to make the big bust.  Things go slightly wrong and the leader of the gang, Danny T (Chuck Zito) is captured while his son dies in a police shootout.  Danny T, of course, blames Brocker for the death of his son after seeing that he IS, in fact, an undercover officer.

The movie then skips ahead some time in the future (we'll say a year, give or take?).  Broker and his daughter, Maddy (Izabela Vidovic) now live in Northern Louisiana. (his wife has since passed away)  While attending school, a bully steals Maddy's hat and is quickly beaten down after she gives him, what she calls, ""his two warnings"".  This results in Broker getting called to school along with the bully's parents, Cassie (Kate Bosworth) and Jimmy Klum (Marcus Hester) being called in as well.

At this point, I'd like to take the time to explain just how underrated an actress I think Kate Bosworth is.  She can go from a beautiful college student (21), to this movie, playing a cracked out looking, piece of trash and pull it off flawlessly!  That's a total compliment, just to make sure.  And props to the makeup crew for being able to transform a woman like Kate into this mess and be completely believable.  Back to the review......

Cassie basically goes NUTS on Broker and demands an apology, to which Broker has none.  While leaving, she forces Jimmy to confront Broker, to absolutely no avail.  After they get home and Cassie belittles Jimmy, she calls on her brother, Gator (James Franco) to help straighten out the situation.  At this point, we've seen what type of person Gator is from an earlier scene in the movie (that was ridiculously AWESOME, by the way).  Gator sends two guys to help Broker with his supposed ""attitude"" only to have Broker straighten those guys out as well.  (Again,...AWESOME!)  Here we see the sheriff (Clancy Brown,....better known as CAPTAIN HADLEY from 'The Shawshank Redemption') pulling over Broker and having another ""friendly"" chat.  Broker decides to make piece after discovering his house was broken into (at which point, Gater discovers Broker's former identity) and heads to talk to Cassie and Jimmy.  He apologized, but doesn't realize that it's too late for them all since Gator is now intent on telling Danny T, he knows where his former ""friend"" is.  Gator sends Sheryl (Winona Rider) to talk with Danny's lawyer and set up a deal that will allow Gator complete distribution for the drugs he creates.  Danny T sends his best man, Cyrus (Frank Grillo) to deal with the whole situation.  Afterwards, Cyrus and crew refuse Gators offer an force Sheryl to tell them where Broker is.  Things go wrong at Broker's house and Maddy gets taken by Sheryl.  Gator is far from pleased that she'd bring a ""witness"" back and is about to put a stop to the situation when Cassie and Jimmy show up to talk.  While discovering what is going on, Cassie inadvertently ignites a trap that Broker had set earlier on, leaving Gator without drug organization.

In the final scene, we find Broker (being the complete badass that he is) going to the jail to personally deliver a message for Danny T.

All in all, if you want a great action movie, then this is the one for you!  Great acting and story all around!  Just a really fun movie to watch!",1391558400,21,4015,4.635977337110481
6158510,3,B00HEPCRLE,"Homefront is put together well, it's just a superthin story and you'll realize that after the repeated aerial shots used in the film. It's like they used them as filler to make the runtime reach 90 minutes. Stathem is solid as are the others, but the movie lurches along and then the ending occurs, abruptly. It felt like the movie had only reached the midway mark at this point. Not a bad late night flick, but not the greatest one either.",1391385600,2,440,4.444444444444445
