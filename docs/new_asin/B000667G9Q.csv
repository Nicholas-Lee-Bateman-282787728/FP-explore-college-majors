8039127,5,B000667G9Q,This was an excellent anime.,1451779200,,28,4.8
8039128,5,B000667G9Q,"Of the various ""Zoids"" anime out there, this is the one with the best story, as well as having some of the most memorable characters, other than the Zoids machines, themselves. However, I must admit that my own Personal Favorite is the Bad Guy, Gunther Prozen, and his big moment on the DVD just makes my day! Gotta' LUV those Crazy White-Haired Anime Baddies!",1392076800,,360,4.640625
8039129,5,B000667G9Q,Easier to buy these then collect off cable. Getting them in order helps the series make more sense. Looking forward to getting the rest,1355788800,,135,4.666666666666667
8039130,4,B000667G9Q,"After collecting the Zoid cores, Prozen unleashes the Death Saurer. This is the giant monster that destroyed Fiona's people and haunts her dreams every night. It is loosed on the Empire's Capital. Van and his friends must destroy it before it destroys the world.

This series is really fun. There are lots of cool characters, action, drama, comedy, and a pretty engrossing plot. I'd say that this series borders on addicting. When it was on TV at 5:30 in the morning all those years ago, I actually woke up, watched it, and went back to sleep before going to high school at 8am. It takes a hell of a good show to get me up that early in the morning. The only complaint I have is the price. I started collecting Zoids when it was first coming out. It seems like the DVD's were around $10 or $15 new back then. I've seen the prices of them now, and I think it's ridiculous. They are out of print, and there are more and more people that will hold on to them once they get them. If you find a decent deal on them, I'd jump on it. It looks like the whole series will run about $700. I would like to see them released again since they are rare. Anyway, this series is a lot of fun, and I highly recommend it to anime fans of all ages.",1354924800,,1229,4.163865546218488
8039131,3,B000667G9Q,i am a fan and have been for a long time. i do enjoy owning them on dvd but the dvd lacks a lot. could use more special features and i would have enjoyed a box set much more. too bad amazon and a lot of places don't carry these dvds anymore because i know of lots of people looking for them and they are envious of my small stack that keeps growing among my collection of dvds.,1223683200,,377,3.8461538461538463
8039132,3,B000667G9Q,"First off this is a review of Zoids Choatic Century series as a whole. Second I would have given this a 3.5 if I could.

ZCC is by far the best zoids series in the franchise. That still isn't saying much, this is just your average big robo anime. The voice acting is okay, the graphics again okay, the plot is slightly above average. This is a long series that has a lot twists but its just not the amazing legendary anime everyones making it out to be. Make no mistake this is nowhere near the league of say gundam or EVA. This is your anime you pop in if you have kids or just want something to do du to. Normally I would say save your money but the series cost 12.99 each brand new so try it out if you like then go on if you don't then you only wasted 12 dollors not a terrible waste.",1167523200,,788,3.9559748427672954
8039133,4,B000667G9Q,"It's been a while since I've seen Zoids, and seeing it once again is really, really nice. Therefore, perhaps it's just my imagination when I think some things are different between the DVD and the episodes. For starters, the animation seems a little rockier and a little less realistic. The music, however, was definately fabulous. I liked this collection of episodes because it held the last four episodes of Chaotic Century and the first two of Guardian Force.",1110672000,,462,4.935897435897436
