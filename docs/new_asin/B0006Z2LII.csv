8043807,4,B0006Z2LII,"A fast-paced and sweaty story of three characters Lucia, Chino and Charly set in residential Madrid. Chino and Charly make are street-smart pals. One day, they decide to engage Lucia (Chino's crush) to dupe a wealthy Frenchman of some dope. Expectedly, things go wrong and the trio have to go underground. In the meantime Lucia and Charly start start getting attracted to each other (to Chino's chagrin). A strange triangular relationship develops (mostly driven out of a will to survive). In a police round-up one day (run by Chino's cop brother, Antonio), Charly gets arrested and sent to a 13 month prison term. Surprisingly, Chino becomes a cop and gets close to Lucia once again. Whilst Charly is in prison, Lucia runs petty drug deals to make fast buck for an apartment. However, things turn roller-coaster as soon as Charly gets out of prison. Misunderstandings, yearnings for a better life, and seductions run galore. Relationship between Lucia, Chino and Charly gets strained, but not broken. Their friendship runs stronger than anything else and this is the highlight of the movie. Chino helps Charly get out the drug and police mess and walks out their life. The end is remarkable and befitting.
Good performances by Chino, Charly and Lucia...",1118016000,9,1254,5.033653846153846
