8590667,5,B00004REV8,"This video covers two types of creatures:  saltwater crocodiles (in Australia) and sharks (various kinds discussed).  Note:  Very brief mention of evolution.  For our family, I've done a fill-in-the-blank sheet to accompany each section (there are plenty of facts that can be reviewed).
Saltwater crocs:  Starting with the mother croc swimming from the ocean to the billibong in order to lay her eggs and ending with one of the hatchlings returning to the ocean, this is a fascinating look at the life cycle of the saltwater croc.  Kelli and David (offscreen) discuss various facts about the croc's way of life.
Sharks:  Kelli and David (offscreen) talk about various kinds of sharks, features they have in common, and features unique to certain types.  My son (who's shark-crazy to begin with) enjoys the video footage, while I like the facts!",1246838400,,844,5.065217391304348
