8415049,5,B0043KI2QC,"Really enjoyed this ""Walkumentary"" it's by no means
a Hollywood production but that's what gives it all it's charm
that's what makes it real. A classic for the AT hiker
no matter the decade or for anyone who dreams of
escaping suburbia and hitting the trail. Note I found the DVD on eBay.",1344384000,,288,4.452830188679245
8415050,5,B0043KI2QC,I hiked 20 miles in one day on the AT with Carol Moore when she was thru hiking.  Anybody that wants to hike the Appalachian trail should see the video. It's great!,1307923200,,164,4.125
8415051,5,B0043KI2QC,"As the title, ""Trail Magic"" indicates, this movie captures the spirit of hiking the Appalachian Trail.  The ending is especially good.  Loved the movie, the sub-culture, the whole transforming experience.  I only wish I could have it on DVD!",1306368000,,241,5.128205128205129
