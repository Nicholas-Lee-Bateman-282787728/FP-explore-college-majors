However, the first DVD I received ""Beginning Folk Harp (with the ""Lark in the Morning"" brand on it) was full
of static and audio fuzz. The DVD itself was old enough that the label was completely faded away because it
appeared to be a cheaply made copy or homemade. I tried it on a couple different players, same effect.
Amazon.com cheerfully replaced it (although I was strongly suspicious the next would be the same because it's
a process thing - it wasn't ""damaged in shipping"", for instance).
  The replacement DVD was even worse, it had the same problems above and it also wouldnt load past the menu
or access the rest of the DVD. Other players wouldnt load it at all.
  Still, even so, such things are often out of the musicians hands at this point, but I contacted both
Lark in the Morning music shop and Pam Robertson thru her web page. Neither has bothered to reply at this time.

  So it goes back to Amazon.com for a full refund.
An unfortunate experience, I recommend you avoid.

If you are looking for a competitor product, try the Sylvia Woods DVD. It looks a bit dated, but the lessons
are there in good quality and the DVD works just fine.
This is not a review of the actual lessons provided in either, but of the physical DVD media itself.
