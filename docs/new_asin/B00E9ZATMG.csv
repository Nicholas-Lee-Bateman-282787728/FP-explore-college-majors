8603081,3,B00E9ZATMG,"I haven't watched Kenny Rogers yet, but I am very glad that the other Christmas specials were included.  Here's my thing about Christmas Specials: Generally, if you watch them sitting down staring at the screen like they were a Hitchcock film, you'll be disappointed.  Personally, I like to have them on while doing Christmas related activities: wrapping, decorating, trimming, etc.  For that purpose these are very good.  I think the Liberace and GE Theater shows were taken from old kinascopes and the USO Show from an old print.  The picture quality is not great (not horrid) and the production values are very simple.  Still, there's a lot of refreshing earnestness in these old shows.  Contrary, to what another reviewer stated, I rather like the Liberace special.  His piano playing is top notch and he brings a real goofy enthusiasm to the affair, especially when he introduces his siblings, dog, and mother at the end.  For $5, this disk is definitely worth picking up.",1450137600,3,977,4.9447852760736195

8603084,1,B00E9ZATMG,Bad quality... Liberace Christmas was from the 1950's. Absolutely the worst Christmas specials ever! This is like getting a lump of coal.,1388016000,,137,5.2727272727272725
8603085,1,B00E9ZATMG,The video isn't good at all.  And the audio is stinko.  You would think In this day and age they would make some effort to clear and clean up this rattle bang copy.  PATHETIC ! ! ! ! !,1385596800,5,184,3.6666666666666665
