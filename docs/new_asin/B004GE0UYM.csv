8428626,4,B004GE0UYM,This was a 2-disc set and has been very informative for me since I have ZERO experience with any type of welding. I've watched these two videos 3 times and am ready to get started with practicing but NOT tackle a critical project right away. I'd give it 5 stars but haven't used the instruction yet to see if it is great. I'll update later once I use the info in these 2 discs.,1477440000,,377,4.108108108108108

8428629,5,B004GE0UYM,Received both DVD's on TIG (basic and advanced).  There were good tips and excellent actual videos of the welding process showing details that were very helpful.  Both DVD's are recommended and the seller provided great service.,1396051200,,228,5.305555555555555
