8321051,4,B001MEM7DG,"I previewed this DVD on Mammals before showing it. I thought it was too repetitive in certain areas and Bill Nye did not go into much depth in terms of Mammals. I did show it to my special education students who are emotionally disturbed and they liked it a lot. They were annoyed in one part where there was a naked mole-rat and wanted me to fast forward that part, but other than that they enjoyed the 23 minute DVD about Mammals.",1364169600,,432,4.280487804878049
