8206995,4,B000SVNLJS,"The true story of CNN reporter Jerry Levin who is kidnapped in the Middle East.  The US stage department tells Sis, his wife, to stay out of the situation.  Instead she travels to Lebanon, practices her calling of music therapy with war-traumatized children, meets officials and ordinary citizens, this based on her Jesus-based belief of peace with justice.  (This is not a ""religious"" film"" -- instead a woman quietly working her faith.)

Eventually Jerry ""manages"" to escape (loose handcuffs, an un-locked door, an unobservant guard).

Jerry says,  ""I want to thank my Jewish parents, my Christian wife, and our Muslim friends.""

Watch this, read their book, share then around widely.",1224979200,6,686,5.181818181818182
8206996,5,B000SVNLJS,"While the previous reviewer's title ""Stockholm Syndrome on Steroids"" is cute and catchy, nothing could be farther from the truth about the book (Beirut Diary) and the movie it became ""Held Hostage"". Sis Levin was never held hostage, so how do her words and actions fit into the accusations of ""Stockholm Syndrome""? I am a medical professional who has been on missions in the Middle East and Central America and I found Dr. Sis Levin's accounts acccurate and tremendously profound. It is so easy and even natural to hate and plot revenge.....and those who expound upon the true Christian values of forgiveness and understanding have always been ridiculed. The incredible bravery of Sis and Jerry, then and now, deserves far more than to be sneered at by the obviously jaded previous reviewer.....but then those who seek to improve humanity and lift us as a race of people to a higher plain have always been condemned as ""crackpots"". The Levins are not ""crackpots, they are The Real Deal. I highly recommend this DVD.",1187222400,5,1015,4.906976744186046
8206997,4,B000SVNLJS,"This made for TV movie is based on the true story of American journalist Jerry Levin's abduction by Arab extremists.  The year is 1984 and the Palestinian intruders are destroying the beautiful city of Beirut.  President Reagan orders America's military power into the region and this results in the endangerment of our own citizens residing in the area.  Levin is merely one of a number of American hostages being held for purposes of blackmail.  His wife Sis will stop at virtually nothing to rescue him.  The story sadly soon turns into a quintessential example of the Stockholm Syndrome on steroids.  Yes, she ultimately saves his life---but at a horrible price.  They tacitly agree to become propaganda tools of Jerry's captors.

The Levins are today far left-wing apologists for Arab extremism.  In their peculiar way of looking at the world, real victims like the Israelis are often vilified as aggressors and villains. ""Held Hostage"" is worth seeing as an inadvertent study of how utopian liberals are quick to intellectually and psychologically surrender to the forces of evil.  This is the sole reason I strongly urge everyone to make a point of seeing this movie.",1183939200,2,1174,5.036269430051814
