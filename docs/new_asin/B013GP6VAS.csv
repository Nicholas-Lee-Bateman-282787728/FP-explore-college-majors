7364810,5,B013GP6VAS,"Brilliant, innovative, and totally fascinating!  I'm only sorry I missed the stage production.",1491350400,2,94,6.230769230769231
7364811,5,B013GP6VAS,"So true to the stage production at the National. A real piece of art. Takes musical theater to the next level. Gently strips the facade off bourgeois values. If you think the best musical ever made is Disney's The Little Mermaid or something similar, you won't like this. It's a grown-up story, gorgeously written, beautifully performed. For fans of Sondheim and neorealism. Loved it!",1491091200,4,384,5.015625
7364812,5,B013GP6VAS,"A loving film representation of what was, on stage, one of the most memorable theatrical events I have ever seen.  It is a totally unique ""musical"" where the melodies and rhythms are derived from recorded interviews of the actual residents of London Road.  As good as the film is, the impact of the original National Theatre of Great Britain production stays with me.  The film is wonderfully, lovingly translated from the stage by a first rate cast and production team  ---  a labor of love, I suspect.  An absolutely unique experience.",1490745600,6,537,4.846153846153846
7364813,1,B013GP6VAS,Got it cause it's supposed to be murder mystery...then reporters in TV started singing. Then some other character started to sing. I couldn't keep watching that.,1489881600,4,161,5.230769230769231
7364814,1,B013GP6VAS,"Did not like, only watched 10 minutes, worse $5 I",1488499200,4,49,4.0
7364815,3,B013GP6VAS,Tom Hardy was only in it for about 5 minutes. I don't remember the rest of the movie.,1466380800,16,85,3.7777777777777777
8727624,5,B013GP6VAS,"The low reviews are quite unfair and completely missed the point of this innovative, intelligent, brilliant, wise, moving and ultimately life affirming film. London Road Is a slightly avant-garde gem that is not your run of the mill musical. In the end, it is about how a community chooses to heal tragedy with hope. I highly recommend it for all thoughtful, intelligent, human viewers.",1532563200,,386,5.046875
8727625,1,B013GP6VAS,Tom Hardy was in this movie not more than 4minutes. Very disappointed  If I could get my money back I would appreciate it,1525651200,,121,4.260869565217392
8727626,1,B013GP6VAS,I thought with this excellent cast it would be a great movie? Was I ever wrong? Save your money. Amazon customer service was great and the only reason I gave one star.,1523664000,,167,4.25
8727627,1,B013GP6VAS,I guess that I didn't read the description very well. This was one of the worst ieeas for a movie . A musical murder?? No Thanks.,1522454400,2,129,4.0
8727628,5,B013GP6VAS,"London Road is verbatim theatre set to music, incorporating cadences and tempo from the actual interviews into the score. This is an eccentric, experimental piece of Musical Theatre. I can understand if some people are turned off by that, but London Road really excels at what it's trying to do.",1521590400,,295,4.92
8727629,5,B013GP6VAS,Really quirky.  Loved it!,1511654400,2,25,5.25
8727630,3,B013GP6VAS,"strange film really, not to everyones taste",1505692800,,43,5.285714285714286
8727631,3,B013GP6VAS,"Tom Hardy only has a cameo role.

The police don't care about the prostitutes on London Road, Ipswich, Essex, England until several are found dead.

The police prove inept in catching the killer.

The investigation ends in a tragedy.",1499817600,2,233,4.923076923076923
8727632,1,B013GP6VAS,"Terrible!  It is a musical of sorts, totally caught me off guard.  I shut it off after 10 minutes...not a subject to sing about, was pretty shocked at the presentation.",1497830400,3,168,4.566666666666666
8727633,1,B013GP6VAS,"A full-length musical about the murder of five English whores: what a wonderful idea! I'm surprised more of them haven't been made.

To make sure you know that this is a serious subject, everything is shot through a blue filter. Save your money, folks.",1497830400,3,252,4.7272727272727275
