8187815,4,B000MRTXBI,An very good portrayal of living in a rural area of the prairies in Canada. A young and new teacher heads out west to take on a teaching assignment. Adapting to this rugged and rural area is not easy for him being from a big city. It has a lot of humuorous spots in the movie where you can't help but laugh.,1297036800,,307,3.967741935483871
