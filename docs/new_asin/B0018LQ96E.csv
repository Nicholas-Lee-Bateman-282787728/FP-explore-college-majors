Never knew where this was going. I wish this had the budget to have been shot on 35mm film and also wished it had a wide theatrical release with the same actors. I specially liked the guy that played Trevor and his Fianc. They held this film together so well. They seemed like the perfect couple and you'd never have had an idea of how this was going to end. I cant wait to see what Anson Scoville (great actor and no I don't know him) and Jennifer Marlowe (she has a Jennifer Connelly thing going on here)are going to do next. The writer/director Ryan Rossell is so creative I know he'll have a long lasting career in Hollywood. Anyway, find this, rent it, own it! its definitely worth watching. Do watch the DVD Extras, its fascinating to see and hear how it all came together.",1376352000,,945,4.375
8270012,5,B0018LQ96E,"I enjoyed viewing this movie.  It was remarkable with its bizarre twists and turns.  It delves heavily into how we all might act given the unanticipated circumstances that move the film forward.  It was surreal with its turning ""customary"" into gripping scenarios.  I do highly recommend it, despite not agreeing with all facets of it. Well worth the price.  Jennifer Marlowe gives us a very good performance with her character evolving in the movie. I agree with the other commentary, which induced me to buy this film. Hope to see more of Ms. Marlowe.  Highly recommended.",1265760000,,574,4.927083333333333
8270013,5,B0018LQ96E,"Great film!  I recently acquired this movie after stumbling upon an intriguing ""trailer"" for it on YouTube (to see it, search blackwinethemovie).  I watched it with my husband and two kids (ages 21 and 22) who love thrillers.  The writing was great, with many unexpected twists and turns.  We watched it at least two more times just to catch all the little things we missed the first time. I highly recommend this!",1214179200,2,414,4.708333333333333
8270014,5,B0018LQ96E,"I saw Black Wine at the Chicago Indy Film Festival.  It made me jump, made me laugh, and made me wonder about potential consequences of the characters' actions long after the movie ended.  A very enjoyable film.  I recommend it highly.",1213142400,,235,4.682926829268292
8270015,5,B0018LQ96E,"I was lucky to see this film when it premiered at the Hollywood Film Festival.  The audience was absolutely riveted by the clever plot, and we discussed it long after the movie ended.  I've been dying (no pun intended) for Black Wine to come out on DVD so I could have my own copy, and I'm already looking forward to future projects by this creative new filmmaker.  If you like thrillers, you'll love this movie.",1213142400,2,412,4.466666666666667
