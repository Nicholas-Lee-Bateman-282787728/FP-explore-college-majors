5185250,2,B008VKZX08,This movie is nothing more than a prolonged episode of UFC Primetime. It's just a bunch of clips of Silva training and some behind the scene stuff of him at press conferences etc. No real story and you learn nothing about him or MMA. A documentary is suppose to enlighten this is just more of the same type of thing I've seen a 100x except I had to pay for it. Boring.,1338940800,4,368,4.125
5185251,5,B008VKZX08,"Anderson Silva Like Water spends most of its 96 minutes on the lead up to UFC 117, Silva vs. Sonnen I.  In fact, it could be viewed as the ultimate bonus feature for UFC 117.  It spends a bit of time on his background and his homelife in Brazil.  However, the vast majority of the documentary is about his training sessions, ""day in the life"" type segments, and interviews with a variety of people (not just Silva, but Ed Soares, Dana White, Chael Sonnen, and others).  There's also a segment with Silva coaching one of his friend's matches at a smaller MMA promotion.

Overall, it's an interesting behind-the-scenes look at Silva's life and is highly recommended for any MMA fan, or anyone interested in the life of a professional fighter.  It gives the story of Silva that has been largely untold, as well as a look at all the things that go into the lead-up to a fight.",1338940800,,872,4.487341772151899
5185252,5,B008VKZX08,"An inside look at the story behind the fighter, the man behind the belt. Anderson Silva is the greatest mixed martial artist in the world. Overall a great documentary leading up to the fight that had Silva fans on the edge of their seats. I watched this fight live, and truly thought Silva was about to lose the belt, then the triangle, and tapout from chael. Overcoming adversity is what TRULY makes a champion, and if you have seen the Silva vs Sonnen fight, you know, like it or not, Anderson Silva is a true champion. This documentary shows the story behind THAT story in a gripping and honest way. For Anderson Silva fans, M.M.A fans, fight fans of all types, LIKE WATER will NOT disappoint!",1338681600,7,696,4.531746031746032

5185259,3,B008VKZX08,"Anderson Silva is MMA's greatest champion.  His fighting ability in a variety of disciplines is astounding, which accounts for his long reign as middleweight champion.  This video purports to give us the inside information on this great champion, but sadly, very little is revealed about him.  We know from the video that he has a wife and two children; he appears to be a loving father and husband, but we do not get any insights from his wife or children, nor do we get any insights from people from his hometown.  We actually learn very little about Anderson Silva.  He speaks Portuguese, and is a man of few words.  He speaks nothing of himself in this video.  We see him training for his big fight against Chael Sonnen in August, 2010, but we are not told that Silva had a cracked rib when he went into that fight. The video implies an injury, but it is not stated as such.  We perhaps learn more about Silva from his opponent, Sonnen, who suggests that Silva is a ""gang-banger"", certainly not the image the UFC wants presented.  In the end, we are left in the dark about who Anderson Silva is.

This video could have been so much more than what it is. What this is is somewhat like a reality show in that a camera follows Silva around beginning 60 days before his big fight, but there is no interview with Silva, no background information.  If you knew little about Anderson Silva to begin with, this video adds virtually nothing more.  So while I enjoyed watching it (it could have been edited down in time), I really did not learn anything about the greatest fighter the UFC has ever promoted. The potential was certainly great for this video, but the realization is somewhat disappointing.

Maybe a Sony or TDK blank. Not sure. This is a Lionsgate product?! I'm disappointed with the actual dvd not the documentary.",1360540800,,280,4.30188679245283

5185266,1,B008VKZX08,"Anderson Silva is a great fighter and I'm sure he's a nice guy, but this film was brutally slow.  You don't really learn anything about him (he's got a wife and kids)and all the good footage are clips of his fights.  Ironically, scenes with his enemy Chael Sonnen were the most entertaining.  I'm a fan of both mma and documentaries, but this could have been cut down to an hour and shown on (insert channel here).  Unless you're a HUGE fan of Silva or you enjoy long traning sequences or silent car rides, avoid this one.",1354060800,2,522,4.40625
5185267,5,B008VKZX08,This is a great documentary! Anyone that is into MMA or combat sports would enjoy. Anderson Silva is easily the best fighter the world has ever known. You get to see a side of him in this that you don't see in UFC stuff. Do yourself a favor and learn about the Michael Jordan or MMA!!!,1349049600,,285,4.107142857142857
5185268,2,B008VKZX08,"I was expecting an in depth look at Silva.  You get to see some of his values and his family, but not much by way of words from him, most importantly you hear nothing of his martial arts philosophy, only some excerpts of him training.  I was dissapointed because I expected to see more philosophy, not just training footage.  I really learned nothing new about silva except that he seems to be kind of a jokester with his friends, that's about it.",1347494400,6,447,4.426829268292683
5185269,5,B008VKZX08,"Let me first start out by saying that I'm not into MMA, and prior to this film, never heard of Anderson Silva.  So obviously I'd strongly recommend this to anyone regardless of whether or not they are a fan of Silva or MMA.

Anderson Silva is one inspirational dude...took a minute to see his full character, but from what the film portrays, he's the best kind of warrior...the humble one.

The build up to the end fight was as good as any Hollywood drama, and given I had no clue who would win the fight, I was yelling at the edge of my couch literally:)  Such an epic end to an awesome film.

I can see how if you already knew this whole story, this film might not be worthy of the review I'm currently giving.

I can't tell you how many times I finally hit the ""rent it/buy it"" button on a film because it was released by Lionsgate, but they rarely let me down in terms of what they green light.",1344729600,,898,4.161849710982659
5185270,5,B008VKZX08,"When your documentary's introduction is Bruce Lee's ""Water"" philosophy, you know you have made it in the world of martial arts. This is a behind-the-scenes look at Anderson ""The Spider"" Silva, arguably the greatest mixed martial artist today.

 The film starts with footage of Anderson demolishing a number of opponents in the most brutal and devastating fashion. To those who are not familiar with MMA, this would seem like a black belt sensei taking out his aggressions on a few yellow and green belt students. But trust this writer when he says that all the opponents that Anderson has demolished are current, former or prospective champions and number one contenders.

The documentary follows Anderson after his Abu Dhabi fight against number one contender Damian Maia wherein he was set to defend his title for a record sixth time, an unprecedented feat in the UFC, the organization in which Anderson fights and the global leader in MMA (Think FIFA or the NFL) when an unexpected turn of events occurred. Anderson, long thought to be bored with the current slew of competition that has been put in front of him started toying with Maia, going around him in circles and striking him sparsely (albeit with brute force and startling accuracy) when he clearly could have finished him in the first or second round. He eventually got a unanimous decision victory, but it also earned him the fury of Dana White, the UFC president especially since the event was set to be a showcase for the UFC's new Arab partners. White eventually threatened to cut Anderson from the UFC roster if he exhibited the same antics in his next fight.

Enter Chael Sonnen, a man on a mission to take the belt from Anderson by what ever means necessary, but mostly by getting under The Spider's skin through trash-talk.  The man is the Ying to Anderson's Yang. Whereas Anderson genuinely, on several occasions stated that the most important thing in his life is his family and spending time with them, Sonnen's obsession is getting the Middleweight belt and ridding ""Uncle Dana"" of the cancer that is Anderson.

The film gets very close to the Spider, be it in shots where he hangs around the house with his family, in the gym where we get an up-close and personal with the Spider himself, or as he coaches Dan Dan, his protg (be ready for a very intense Silva in those scenes). The climax of the documentary will not surprise long-time fans as the final fight with Sonnen was in 2010, but you will definitely get goose bumps towards the end.

Verdict:

The film serves as a great introduction to the world of MMA through the eyes of the greatest MMA champion that ever lived. The film is all but required by law for MMA and Spider fans.

Look for:

Sonnen's reply during the big fight's press conference, easily the funniest line in the film.

If you want to learn more about the greatest mixed martial artist of all times this will not disappoint. His time with family, Lyoto Machida (""Machida-San!""), and training time at Black House are very special. His commentary post UFC 117 as he leaves the arena stays with you long after the film ends.",1343088000,,389,5.0
