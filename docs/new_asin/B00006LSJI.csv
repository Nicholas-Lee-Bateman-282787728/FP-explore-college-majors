2756612,5,B00006LSJI,"FIRST THOUGHTS: ONE OF A KIND IN 1980

When this film was first released I recall seeing the ads on TV, and the reviews with film clips. What I remember most is the scene of an hysterical woman on board the plane being shaken by the doctor [Leslie Neilsen] who was called away to the phone. Then another person took over the slapping while the cameras slowly panned toward the now forming line where people were carrying huge wrenches, pistols, baseball bats and crowbars - all oversized, to help aid this poor passenger in her moment of hysteria. This really sets the tone of what ""AIRPLANE"" is all about.

IN A NUTSHELL: TACKY - TAWDRY - VULGAR - CLICHE: BUT TERRIBLY FUNNY ON A GUT LEVEL

When ""Airplane"" was first released in 1980 it was unbelievably funny from beginning to end. Yes, funny enough to forgive the recurring bouts of poor taste that would have sunk a lesser comedy.

WHAT IT'S ALL ABOUT: 5-STAR COMEDIC EPIC FROM 1980

The most economical chunk of comedy ever devised is here on DVD.

------ *- PLOT SPOILERS BELOW *---------------------------------

--*It goes something like this: FUNNY HOW IT DOESN'T SOUND AT ALL FUNNY!

Ted Striker [Robert Hays], is a mess. He is an alcoholic former single-engine fighter pilot who now has a total phobia of flying because of his war-time trauma where most of his squadron died while under his ill-fated command. Nevertheless, Striker boards a jet airliner in an attempt to plead his way back to the good graces of his stewardess girlfriend [Julie Hagerty] who states, ""I can't live with a man I don't respect"".

-- SO THE REST OF THE FILM IS ALL ABOUT STRIKER REGAINING ELAINE'S RESPECT

FORTUNATELY FOR STRIKER: Fate intervines, as food poisoning incapacitates the passengers and crew that had fish for dinner, including the entire flight crew. Now only Striker is available to land the plane. Striker's former commanding officer [Robert Stack], is given the impossible job of talking down Striker, the reluctant hero.

ALONG THE WAY:

We meet a gaggle of disaster movie cliches, that we call passengers. They include the guitar-strumming nun, a sick little girl who needs a heart transplant, the frightened woman who gets it from a line of bat weilding passengers, and two African-American male passengers who speak ""jive"" and who have their words subtitled throughout. We also have Dr. Rumack [Leslie Nielsen] who takes everything literally and who states ""You can tell me -- I'm a doctor"" to equally straight Capt. Oveur [Peter Graves] the overtly pedophilic pilot.

ABOUT THE DVD: EXCELLENT WIDESCREEN TRANSFER + ORIGINAL THEATRICAL TRAILER

BOTTOM LINE: EVERY MOMENT OF AIRPLANE IS STEEPED IN OVERWHELMING SILLINESS!

Excellent comedy, but it does seem a little dated as it has been copied, and lampooned all too frequently, including in ""Airplane 2-The Sequel"". Nevertheless, this is an adult comedy which is literally over all too soon, and where a single second is not allowed to elapse without the presence of overwhelming silliness.",1143331200,,4014,5.031914893617022

2756650,5,B00006LSJI,"Why so few reviews? Because we haven't stopped laughing yet!

The original Airplane is still my favorite of the pair. This was the first big hit from the Zucker (x2) and Abrahams team that would continue to tickle our funny-bones into the nineties with genre homages like Top Secret, The Naked Gun, and Hot Shots. I think Hot Shots was where they finally managed to top the home run hit they scored with Airplane, but I enjoyed their other parodies too.

Airplane is a send up of the classic airline disaster movies (such as The High and the Mighty and the Airport series). Along the way, other Hollywood classics and genres get the treatment as well (such as Saturday Night Fever). Airplane II then takes the airline disaster genre into ""the future"", with a space shuttle being the featured craft in jeopardy.

Airplane is a mixture of movie buff in-jokes, razor sharp wit, goofy puns, and sight gags. What takes things over the top is the stellar cast that is involved in the shenanigans, including golden age Hollywood stars Lloyd Bridges and Leslie Nielsen who would go on to become gut-busting Zucker-Abrahams regulars. Also on board for Airplane are Robert Stack, Peter Graves, and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. Barbara Billingsley, of ""Leave It To Beaver"" fame, has a hilarious and unexpected cameo, and somehow California tax activist Howard Jarvis even makes it into the mix!

Airplane II has similarly inspired casting, with Bridges and Graves returning, joined by Chuck Connors, Sony Bono, Raymond Burr, and John Vernon. Plus there's William Shatner who shows up as the perfect candidate to play the commander of a lunar base. The star-studded casts of both movies reflect how disaster movies of the seventies used a cavalcade of stars as a selling point.

This is a welcome, bargain priced set for fans and newcomers alike. Here you get two hilarious movies on blu-ray for under ten bucks -- who can gripe about that?

Perhaps only those who haven't gotten over Macho Grande...",1498867200,5,1980,4.895522388059701

you get 2 discs in 1 blu-ray case

2756660,5,B00006LSJI,"It's been more than 30 years since the first time I saw ""Airplane"" and it still makes me laugh.  In addition to all the wonderful slapstick humor, this is a great parody of the John Wayne movie of the Ernest K. Gann book ""The High and the Mighty"".  Both movies star Robert Stack in supporting roles, both movies feature flawed men who have suffered personal loss through aviation tragedy, Wayne lost his family and Hays lost his combat comrades.  And the non-visual, non-verbal effect that adds to the parody is the background sound in all of the flying scenes, not the roar of jet engines but the drone of piston powered propeller driven engines.  Gotta love it!

Have not yet seen ""Airplane II"" so cannot comment on that one.  Nor have I ever seen ""Zero Hour"" which is mentioned by several reviewers.",1493424000,3,802,4.612676056338028

When it comes to parodies, Airplane is the king of them all in my humble opinion. It's pure genius, the vast goofy visuals and numerous audio ones as well, that it's tough to beat. I've always found Leslie Nielsen to be the very best of the parody actors. He may be gone, but his humor still lives on, making many people laugh for a long time to come. I wish the sequel was just as great as the first though. It is good, but just not great.

I believed it inspired the short lived TV series 'Police Squad' which was also a silly slapstick series. Overall I thought the original Airplane movie was pretty funny without too many sexual images. (Some, yes, but not too loaded with them). The second was much overfilled with very explicitly sexual images (particularly bare breasts). I don't think it's necessary to use sex as comedy which is one reason why I am unhappy with the sequel movie. Also it was not even close to as truly funny as the original. So, stick with the original for some better laughs.",1441584000,,729,4.703125

2756776,5,B00006LSJI,"AIRPLANE!
Jerry & David zucker's first classic comedy/spoof/parody about Airplane Disaster films from the 70's
after 35years AIRPLANE is still Hillariously funny, you have the cream of the crop in this film
Leslie nielson, Julie Hagerty, Robert Hays, Lloyd bridges, Robert stack, Peter Graves, Lorna paterson
and the incredibly funny Stephen stucker who played the Air traffic controller plus many more cameos
Great comedic performance by Leslie nielson who passed away (Died) about 5 years ago now
Stephen stucker Died back in the 80's from AIDS

as a bonus you get the Sequel aswell AIRPLANE II in this Double pack
similar plot to the 1980 classic, this time the plot is set in the future where the Moon has been colonized
the Plane is Lunar shuttle this time being rushed to Launch from Houston Texas
writer/Directors Jerry & David zucker had no involvement in this sequel
the sequel was written/Directed by Ken finkleman
most of the cast did return back for this sequel even thou there was different Director
so the film is still very funny, but the first one was more funnier

both films have been given new High Definition transfers in 1:85:1 widescreen
so the picture quality does look much clearer & sharp than the old dvd releases
plus the sound quality for both films have been boosted to a new 5.1 Master audio mix
big Difference to the DVD stereo sound mix
both films have their own Disc, so it's 2 Discs in 1 blu-ray case
Disc 1 is Airplane! with the same special feature from the old dvd release
THE LONG HAUL VERSION, if you select this version when you play the film
so while you watch the film, you will get retrospective interviews with some of the cast & crew popping up on the screen
which drags the film for sure the runtime is 180mins
you'll get new interviews with Jim Abrahams, Jerry & David Zucker who give their comments writing the screenplay & Directing
only some of the cast have been interviewed, Leslie nielson, Robert Hays, Peter Graves,
Nicholas pryor, Lee Bryant & Ross Harris who play passengers Jim Hammen, Mrs Hammen & the kid Joey Hammen
Lorna patterson who played one of the stewardess Randy is also interviewed
Lloyd bridges passed away over 15 years ago now
for some reason Actress Julie Hagerty is not interviewed, maybe she wasn't available
stupid idea to insert the cast interviews within the film, i found it annoying
Paramount should have just collected all the interviews and put them together in a retrospective featurette
also Writer/Directors Jim Abrahams, Jerry & David zucker give feature length Audio commentary aswell
which is from the old dvd release

Disc 2 AIRPLANE THE SEQUEL tragically has no new extras at all
Paramount could have got a new interview with Writer/Director ken Finkleman
but obviously Paramount did not make the effort

Definitely worth the money get this Double feature pack, 2 for the price of one
5 stars i gave it",1425427200,2,2892,4.789579158316633

Airplane! Voted ""one of the 10 funniest films ever made"" by the American Film Institute, Airplane! is a masterpiece with off-the-wall comedy. Featuring Robert Hays as an ex-fighter pilot forced to take over the controls of an airliner when the flight crew succumbs to food poisoning; Julie Hagerty as his girlfriend/stewardess/co-pilot; and a cast of all-stars including Robert Stack, Lloyd Bridges, Peter Graves, Leslie Nielsen, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar...and more! Their hilarious high-jinks spook airplane disaster flicks, religious zealots, television commercials, romantic love... the lists whirls by in rapid succession. And the story races from one moment of zany fun to the next! `Airplane II: The Sequel' and there's a mad bomber on board, and the first lunar shuttle is about to self-destruct, the engines are not working and worst of all; the flight crew discovers they are completely out of coffee! It's the high flying lunacy of `Airplane!' and all over again as Robert Hays and Julie Hagerty fly totally out of the ozone to recreate their hilarious original roles. The crew of crazies includes Peter Graves, Lloyd Bridges, William Shatner, Chad Everett, Sonny Bono, Raymond Burr and many others. Can Robert Hays save the day again - without caffeine? Fasten your seatbelts for a ride you'll never forget Airplane II: The Sequel. A post credit scene shows a screen that says ""Coming From Paramount Pictures: ""Airplane III.""""

Andrew's Blu-ray Review: The hundred-gags-a-minute movie parody genre seemed destined to die a quick death when Airplane! came out back in 1980, but it's hung on a lot longer than anyone could have expected. When these things don't work, they really don't work, so it's easy to forget just how hilarious Airplane! was . . . and still is.

No matter which route you choose, you're going to upset the fans. After all, Airplane!' is one of the most consistently funny slapstick spoofs ever made. There's not one single scene in the film absent some kind of ridiculous sight gag, word play, pop culture reference or slapstick moment. It's actually shocking how rapid fire the jokes are, which is one right after another. Just watch the film's sharply paced opening and you'll be treated to at least a dozen good jokes before the 10-minute mark, including one of cinema's best gags, the arguing PA announcers and I chuckle now as I write this just thinking about it, ""Listen Betty, don't start up with your white zone s*** again.""

The plane is loaded to bursting with disaster movie clich&eacute;s including a little girl who needs a heart transplant, a singing nun [Maureen McGovern], a square-jawed pilot [Peter Graves], a brilliant physician (Leslie Nielsen), and an athlete making a quickie appearance in a movie, even though he can't act [Kareem Abdul-Jabbar]. Abrahams, Zucker, and Zucker mock the characters with an ongoing series of bad puns and ludicrous sight gags that quickly demolish your genre expectations.

Airplane!' is a great film, the template for which all films of its type should be based. The Zucker Brothers get so much right with this goofy little flick and it's amazing, and even through some of the film culture references have grown dated, they remain as charming reminders of a time when humour in these sorts of films didn't heavily rely on reality TV and pop culture trends as the ""Date Movie"" type films do. `Airplane!' isn't riddled with ""Hey, look! They're making fun of Michael Jackson"" moments. Those types of gags are there, true, but the film is driven by something much deeper. The men and women behind this film are actually funny. And that makes a world of difference. Airplane!' is a zany little picture that continues to garner hearty laughs now, more than 30 years later. And I imagine it will continue to bust guts for another 30 years to come, probably longer. Regardless of whether you're a newcomer to the series or a huge fan, give this Blu-ray a whirl. Anyway until you get to the end credits, you're be waiting to see how many jokes they can cram into the 87 minutes of Airplane!.

Airplane II: The Sequel' and after the events of the first `Airplane!,' it's a wonder that Ted Striker [Robert Hays] would ever board a plane again. But this time around it's no ordinary plane ride. This is a lunar shuttle, and it's going straight to the moon! The passengers on board are all as wacky as the crew, led by the bubble-headed Captain Clarence Oveur [Peter Graves] and spaced-out stewardess Elaine [Julie Hagerty]. In mid-air, disaster strikes with a computer malfunction, straight out of Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey,' and a mad bomber on board! It's up to Ted Striker to save the day once more! The usual cast of nut balls are called in, including Lloyd Bridges reprising his role as Steve McCroskey, ""I picked the wrong day to stop sniffing chemical glue!,"" William Shatner as Commander Buck Murdock, Steven Stucker as Jacobs / Courtroom Clerk, ""JUST kidding!"" and Sonny Bono as the mad bomber, after dating Cher, wouldn't you be too?. It all adds up to antics so insane that you'll need two viewings to catch them all! Oh wait, I'm thinking of the original. Will Ted Striker save the day? Can the mad bomber be stopped? And what will happen when the passengers find out the plane is completely out of coffee!!!

There are some great performances in this film. Peter Graves gives such a funny spin on Captain Clarence Oveur that he almost steals the show. When a small boy and his dog are brought up the cockpit to see the sights and Captain Clarence Oveur asks him if he likes it when ""Scraps holds on to his leg and rubs up and down?,"" you can't  help but blurt out some laughter. Lloyd Bridges shows why he continued to prosper in a second-wind career as a comedy star in such films as `Hot Shots!' and `Mafia!.' He has such wonderful deadpan delivery that it was a shame to lose him in the prime of his spoof career. His foil, Steven Stucker, reprises his role and the gay tower worker, Jacobs / Courtroom Clerk (or so we'd assume, as he loves to go to sales at J.C. Penny's and is a big fan of broaches). Long before the character of Jack on Will and Grace, there was this hysterically funny portrayal of flamboyancy at its loony best.

Leslie Nielsen's career, rather incredibly, was also revitalised by his role. It's shocking to note that, almost a quarter of a century later, there are viewers who see Nielsen only as that guy with the deadpan expression who'll do anything for a laugh. For many years leading up to this picture, he was a popular, deadly serious character actor; that was the whole point of casting him as an authority figure in Airplane! and the next time you view The Poseidon Adventure [1972] and you'll notice Leslie Nielsen as the captain of the ill-fated ocean liner. He plays it completely straight, although maybe he shouldn't have. But at this point, everything he does (or did) seems thoroughly tongue-in-cheek. And at least we know his name now.

Confession time, I actually like `Airplane II: The Sequel,' the much-loathed second chapter in this hilarious spoof series. In fact, I really like the sequel. No, I'll go one step further and say, ""I love the sequel."" Naturally, I can see why so many people were let down by the film. It's missing some major players, both in front and behind the camera. But really, `Airplane II: The Sequel,'  has some seriously funny gags and the guy shaving while they land, the whole finale with William Shatner, the supercomputer subplot, Sonny Bono as the bad guy. Hell, I love that scene with the Rocky poster in the  background for Rocky XXXVIII and what a fantastic sight gag and one that kind of [sort of] came true.

Airplane!' Blu-ray Video Quality  Finally the 1980s Paramount Pictures title from the current wave that looks relatively good. `Airplane!' sports a very nice 1080p encoded image with a good 1.78:1 aspect ratio transfer that doesn't appear to be the victim of a transfer-destroying level of noise reduction. On the contrary, there's a fine layer of active grain and no evidence of excessively smoothed over, waxy-looking faces. Skin textures are suitably complex, as are clothing materials, the seams in the inflatable automatic pilot, and general objects around the plane and inside the airport. Clarity is rather good, and there are several scenes where the string holding up an actor (Ted dancing at the Disco) or the airplane in exterior shots are readily visible. The image certainly sports a slightly dated appearance, though; colours are strong but not terribly vibrant. However, the brighter hues stand out nicely and naturally, just not with the sort of precision accuracy that might be found in a brand new movie. Black levels are honest, never going too grey and rarely exhibiting excess crush. This is a mostly solid transfer from Paramount Pictures.

Airplane!' Blu-ray Audio Quality  The 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio soundtrack proves quite the satisfying experience. Various elements are surprisingly potent, with no shortage of effortless clarity and natural spacing in score delivery. Popular music is rich and pleasing, too. The Disco sequence featuring Stayin' Alive sounds absolutely fantastic; there's energy to spare, the tune is clear as a bell, and it stretches the front half of the soundstage to its limits. Unfortunately, a few sound effects take on a harsher, crunchier, almost indistinct audible texture. The plane crashing into the terminal at the beginning of the film, for instance, lacks both energy and clarity, somewhat lessening the scene's effectiveness. Still, terminal voiceovers are suitably spacious and, combined with the general din around the airport; the listener will feel fairly immersed in that environment. However, Airplane! is primarily a dialogue-based film, and there's no cause for alarm in that regard; the spoken word enjoys sound clarity and remains entrenched in the centre speaker. This is a quality, but not perfect, soundtrack from Paramount Pictures.

Airplane II: The Sequel' Blu-ray Video Quality  Airplane II: The Sequel' arrives on Blu-ray via Paramount and I suppose for a film that got minimal treatment, doesn't look terribly bad. The 1080p encoded image transfer, presented with a 1.78:1 aspect ratio, has some decent detail levels and the colours, although not entirely vibrant, do seem well balanced.

Airplane II: The Sequel' Blu-ray Audio Quality  The 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio track sounds OK with the same audio coming from both the right and left channels. The dialogue levels sound clear enough and the sound effects, such as bells and crashes, aren't anything spectacular yet adequate enough given the source material.

Blu-ray Special Features and Extras:

Audio Commentary: Commentary with Producer Jon Davidson And Writers/Directors Jim Abrahams, Jerry Zucker And David Zucker: Producer Jon Davison and Writers/Directors Jim Abrahams, Jerry Zucker, and David Zucker deliver an affable but very well-informed commentary, discussing how the project came together, changes made from initial idea to finished product, anecdotes from the set, casting the primary roles, with some emphasis on the appearance of Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, the differences between the television and theatrical versions, the film's premiere, and much more. This is a solid all-around track that fans will enjoy.

Special Feature: Trivia Track: A standard pop-up trivia track surrounding the world of Airplane!.'

Theatrical Trailer [1080p] [3:32]

Finally, often mentioned as possibly the funniest film ever made, 'Airplane!' still delivers a barrel full of gut-busting laughs, but several jokes are starting to wane into hearty chuckles. The wild, zany spoof on disaster films transformed by the ZAZ comedy trio [Jerry Zucker, Jim Abrahams, and David Zucker] into a brand of satirical humour, one which can clearly be seen in many films today. Yet, this 1980 box-office smash remains one of the most admired and funniest of the bunch. The Blu-ray comes with a much-improved audio and video presentation that fans will definitely enjoy, but the supplements are identical to previous inferior DVD editions. Overall, it's a strong package worth picking up if you want a good laugh.

Airplane II: The Sequel' is not in the same league as that uniquely gut-busting trendsetter. But it still stacks up quite well against most parodies and a lot of other comedies in general. Setting this doomed flight on a space shuttle widens the lampoon to include sci-fi movies and opens up a new spectrum of possible jokes, including the ship getting fixed on a collision course with the sun by its shipboard computer, a goof on the HAL 9000. Sure, the jokes are obvious, but part of the film's gleeful appeal is that it revels in that very obviousness. By bringing back dozens of the characters, including many of the passengers, and using an almost identical structure, the sequel might even be considered a parody of the original, rather than just its extension. Easily its funniest element is William Shatner, who takes over the Robert Stack role of the grizzled veteran on the ground trying to talk pilot Striker down. Airplane II: The Sequel isn't quite as original as the first, but few films are, it's too bad that Airplane II: The Sequel remains such a poor stepchild in Paramount Pictures catalogue, but to me it is still quite good and having the 2 films in one package, is totally brilliant. But the Blu-ray is good and will not disappoint any fans of these 2 films. Highly Recommended!

2756850,5,B00006LSJI,"Airplane and Airplane II are two of the funniest movies ever made in my opinion.  If you are unfamilair with these movies get this combo DVD set and see for yourself.  The original Airplane still holds up for a movie made in 1980.  It was directed and written by David Zucker, Jim Abrahams, and Jerry Zucker. It stars Robert Hays and Julie Hagerty and features Leslie Nielsen, Robert Stack, Lloyd Bridges, Peter Graves, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, and Lorna Patterson.

The film is a parody of the disaster film genre, particularly the 1957 Paramount film Zero Hour!, from which it borrows the plot and the central characters,[as well as many elements from Airport 1975. The film is known for its use of absurd and fast-paced slapstick comedy, including visual and verbal puns and gags.  Airplane was a financial success, grossing over US $83 million in North America alone, against a budget of just $3.5 million.  The film's creators received the Writers Guild of America Award for Best Adapted Comedy, and nominations for the Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture  Musical or Comedy and a BAFTA Award for Best Screenplay.  In the years since its release, Airplane's reputation has grown substantially. The film was voted the 10th-funniest American comedy on AFI's 100 Years...100 Laughs list in 2000, and ranked sixth on Bravo's 100 Funniest Movies.

The second film Airplane II: The Sequel is a 1982 sequel to the original Airplane.  The plot of this film is that in the near future, the Moon has been colonized and supports a station on its surface.  A lunar shuttle known as Mayflower One is being rushed to launch from Houston. The head of the ground crew, The Sarge (Chuck Connors), does not like what is occurring, but he defers to the airline's management.  On the flight crew are Captain Clarence Oveur (Peter Graves), First Officer Dunn (James A. Watson, Jr.) and Navigator Dave Unger (Kent McCord).  Also on board is computer officer Elaine Dickinson (Julie Hagerty).  Elaine has long since left Ted Striker (Robert Hays) and is now engaged to one of the flight crew, Simon Kurtz (Chad Everett). Striker has in the meantime been committed to an insane asylum, as he was declared mentally incompetent in a lawsuit following a test flight that Ted piloted and in which the lunar shuttle crashed. Striker believes that the lawsuit was used to silence him, because he knew there were problems with the lunar shuttle that made it unsafe, and he is once more haunted by his actions in ""The War"", specifically the events that took place over ""Macho Grande"", where he lost his entire squadron. When Striker reads of the upcoming lunar shuttle launch, he escapes the asylum and buys a ticket for the flight and thats just the beginning.  I enjoyed both these movies and cannot recommend them high enough.

2756853,4,B00006LSJI,"Airplane! is not just a popular comedy film. It's a benchmark. David Zucker, Jim Abrahams, and Jerry Zucker started a special kind of comedy with Airplane! that was heavy on visual puns sight gags that has endured to this very day with movies like Meet the Spartans and the Scary Movie Series. While Airplane was not the first movie of this kind, it was the first major success.

Back in the 70's disaster movies got a major bump in popularity and both movie and television studios were cranking them out by the dozens. This included plane disasters like the Airport quadrilogy (that essentially launched the 70's disaster movie genre), Terror in the Sky, SST Death Flight, and many more. Airplane! cashed in on that genre by turning it into a comedy based on the classic 59's film Zero Hour! and packing as many jokes, one liners and gags as they can into one film.

When I say packed I do mean packed. I don't think you can go 30 seconds in this movie without hitting some sort of comic device. It parodies Zero Hour!, Jaws, From Here to Eternity, 60 Minutes, The Poseidon Adventure, Saturday Night Fever and likely more that I don't remember or recognize. The movie is outrageous and the comedy comes in all forms. It's such an insane roller coaster ride it doesn't matter who you are, you will find something funny in Airplane!

When Airplane II: The Sequel was announced Zucker, Zucker and Abrahams refused to it simply because they ran out of airplane jokes after putting them all on the previous movie. In walks Ken Finkleman. The plot follows the same formula, only this time with a space shuttle. Unfortunately that also means it follows the same jokes and comedic stylings. What this means is the movie is funny, but it's a ""been there, done that"" funny. While it doesn't reach the bar Airplane! set it's still a worthy film that is funnier than a lot of what was out there. Still the cameo stars and William Shatner do add to the appeal.

This double feature gives you each movie on it's own Blu-ray disk. The visuals are a definite upgrade from the DVD with colors and contrast much sharper. Audio is DTS-HD, but it's also in mono, which is the original format. So it's clean, but not really dynamic. You get the same extras as on the previous Blu-Ray release, which means Airplane II is still essentially featureless. Here are the extras:

AIRPLANE!

Audio Commentary - Producer Jon Davison and Writers/Directors Jim Abrahams, Jerry Zucker, and David Zucker fill out the comments. This is the same commentary that was on the DVD release a while back. Very informative. They even talk about the differences between the theatrical and television releases.

Long Haul Version - Play this mode and you will get prompts along the film to get to interviews, deleted scenes, production notes and more. Kind of disappointing they still won't put this as a separate feature instead of having you go through to movie just to see the interviews.

Trivia Track - A nice touch. You get pop up trivia while watching the movie in this view.

Theatrical Trailer - In high definition

2756856,3,B00006LSJI,I remember this being funnier when I was a kid. Sometimes nostalgia is best left as such the amount of one liners in this is still pretty amazing.,1386201600,,146,4.25
2756857,5,B00006LSJI,"What more about this movie can be said that hasn't already been said about AIRPLANE!? We need more gut wrenching laughs these days like this endearing film first brought us. We need more veteran actors of substance and quality who brought a consistent higher level of excellence to their craft throughout their careers such as found in the cast assembled for this film. They had established their mark on a whole generation of filmgoers and then went on to parody their own screen personifications with such precision, a precision that could only have been achieved from their long and prestigious years of renowned screen performances. And when it came to AIRPLANE! they were given their chance to do it all again, to not only make us laugh, but to make us reminisce along with them and put a smile on our faces for all those years of cherished memories. I wonder if we will ever truly see the likes of this unique film again. So many of those great figures have left us, but there still remains a great big smile on the face of this film. I must say that I did not like AIRPLANE II: THE SEQUEL the first time I saw it in the theater. It grew on me through the years. Peter Graves and Lloyd Bridges are amazing in it. It started out at a snails pace and seemed equally strained for laughter. However, there was a smattering of truly insightful comic genius throughout that made it mildly enjoyable, like seeing William Shatner show up. Then I watched it on video with a group of people once again. For some unknown reason I found myself laughing uncontrollably. As I watched the film again I then began to notice how much it followed the spy genre in parody. Once I began to realize what the filmmakers were doing it all started to take shape a made good comic sense. Not only did it follow the same inspirational format of the original AIRPLANE but it took the same approach with its audience: if this joke doesnt work for you we have plenty more lined up one after another and eventually you are going to start laughing. Whats interesting is that after all this time it seems to finally work. Loved the Jack Jones bit, by the way. AIRPLANE II: THE SEQUEL is much more than just a parody of Hollywood disaster film or a sequel.",1381536000,8,2229,4.479115479115479
2756858,4,B00006LSJI,The first movie is a Must Have for anyone who liked that era of comedy films.  The 2nd is so meh that I had totally forgotten they even made a sequel when I went to buy.  Only made it about 20 minutes in when I totally lost interest and moved onto something else.  Buy the combo pack only if the price difference is negligible.,1378944000,,327,4.078125

THE PILOT TALKING TO THE CHILD WAS BAD TASTE ALSO IN MY OPINION BUT I JUST TRIED TO IGNORE IT AND ENJOY THE OTHER PARTS THAT WERE NOT VULGAR OR IN BAD TASTE. IT IS JUST HARD TO FIND FUNNY MOVIES AFTER THE 60S, THAT WERE CLEAN. IT IS NOT OFTEN I WILL WATCH ANYTHING WITH SOMETHING I FEEL IS VULGAR OR IN MY MIND, EX RATED STUFF, HOWEVER I TUNED OUT THE BAD SO I COULD ENJOY THE REST AND IT CAN REALLY MAKE YOU LAUGH IF YOU ARE ABLE TO BY PASS THE STUFF YOU MAY NOT GO FOR.
