If you like weird. If you like sci-fi. If you like horror. If you like low budget...
This is your movie.

I've seen a lot of low/zero budget films and this is one of the ones I keep coming back to. It's so strange and original with great music and fairly decent effects. It takes a lot of turns and you have no idea where it's going to lead you; but that's the draw. I can't stress how much I dig this flick.

Also: Guitar Wolf. This movie has Guitar Wolf. In Mississippi. Effin' A.",1419465600,,518,4.118811881188119
8175612,1,B00001IVET,"There's not much I can say about The Sore Losers except to stress the fact that it makes no sense whatsoever; the very thought of any part of this movie making the least bit of sense never even occurred to writer/director/producer John Michael McCarthy.  This alien from who knows where named Blackie was sent to Earth by ""the elders"" in the 1950s to kill twelve beatniks, but his allotted time ran out with three victims left to go.  The elders brought him back and confined him somehow, but after forty-something years he has escaped and has come back to finish the job.  He hooks up with a couple of associates, a comic book geek who looks like Prince and a brutal redhead of a woman, but the trio makes the mistake of killing one too many people.  Blackie's in trouble again, but the elders give life back to the redhead's decomposing mother and tell Blackie to kill a certain individual if he wants to be granted a safe return home.  He meets another alien like him stranded on earth and is told that the elders are lying to him.  To kill or not kill the intended victim becomes the question.

This movie never sits still; scenes change, characters change and morph, angelic beings with giant snakes pop up, people die, don't die, and ""undie,"" all without a moment's notice and often in rapid succession.  Even God and Satan aren't safe from the awful clutches of this movie, as they too get thrown into the illogical mix.  Comic books are inexplicably important, and hippies are seemingly public enemy number one.  I won't even try to describe this movie any more than this because I can't and, more importantly, because it simply isn't worth it.  If this movie were a human being, it would be confined in a straitjacket and stuck in a maximum security mental asylum for the rest of its life.  I guess I can begrudgingly credit the ending with what might be called a very tiny bit of a philosophical ending, but in doing so I am being incredibly generous to a movie that goes far out of its way to make sure no one can possibly understand the first thing about it.",1046649600,7,2070,4.505347593582887
8175613,3,B00001IVET,"Like the other reviewers I too had problems with my copy of SORE LOSERS. As I had only seen the film via a poor grade video dub I was greatly disappointed that the DVD (which is soon to be rare) was defective.
A gawdy looking DVD set caught my eye recently. The colorful packaging boasted that it was a 2-DVD set with four films. Shockingly, one of those films is SORE LOSERS. The DVD package is called HOTTER THAN HELL ... The set includes such cinematic trash as Witchcraft X and XI and a shot on video werewolf picture called The Strangers. How SORE LOSERS wound up with these films is anyone's guess.
I picked up the fine priced set and I am pleased to report that not only is SORE LOSERS now defect free but that the picture quality is a bit stronger. For such a price I thought that the film would start as soon as I popped the disc in but to my surprise the DVD sports an attractive menu and chapter marks.
As for the other films, they are not my cup of tea. While I enjoy a good trashy flick with naked women as much as the next guy I like the films to be at least interesting and fairly well done, not one of the other three even comes close.
SORE LOSERS is one of the few seriously low budget films that I have seen over the last 10 years that I have really enjoyed. It's a side of trash culture outside of John Waters. The energetic film is full of old school Kozikish pop culture and fetish queens. The (often nude) women are are not your standard Hollywood fare (thank you), they're more akin to Richard Kern and Eric Kroll fetish models (I'm pretty sure at least one of them is).
I prefer to not say more about the film as I believe it is one best seen without knowing quite what to expect. Just know that if you love beautiful fetish models, old comic books, a bizarre story, and dark humor that you'll probably dig SORE LOSERS.",1017187200,16,1843,4.194366197183099
8175614,1,B00001IVET,My DVD stopped halfway through the movie.  It's a really great movie so it's too bad the DVD is a mess.  I also have it on tape and that does have the entire film on it.  You may as well get the VHS version because even if the DVD did work it has nothing extra on it that would make it any different from a video.,1013299200,6,313,3.712121212121212
