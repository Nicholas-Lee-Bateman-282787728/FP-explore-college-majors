4295553,5,B004A77FNO,"This serial which is reported to be a TV format as opposed to the Sat Matine serials that I was familiar with being the story of Commander Cody and the ""Ruler."" Although the quality is a bit off due to age and lack of full restoration (minor gaps in the dialogue), it was quite enjoyable. I collect this type of serial and it was worth purchase. Don't be fooled by the cover art, it is no annimation through you may think so.",1403481600,9,425,4.195121951219512
4295554,4,B004A77FNO,"Looks just like the episodes I watched on black-and-white TV as a kid. Pretty clear picture considering the length of time that has passed and the equipment it was originally recorded on. I had not remembered that William Schallert was in the cast, probably because he was not well-known in those days, but he became more famous than anyone else in the cast. Really fun to once again watch this show and re-live the old days of TV!",1389225600,4,431,4.538461538461538
4295555,3,B004A77FNO,"I only had a vague memory of these episodes from when I was a child.  It took me quite a while to find these when I remembered part of the name.  The episodes are complete and good quality reproductions of the series.  I think the cover art is very misleading because it suggests an animated series.  This is not animated, but is the series as I remembered it.

The stories themselves are not interesting or dramatic like Twilight Zone, but worth seeing if you have a childhood memory you want to satisfy.",1360281600,2,505,4.445652173913044
4295556,2,B004A77FNO,"I first noticed upon opening the package that the content was divided on three separate discs, so I expected better than average
quality.  But the recorded resolution was extremely low and did not meet my expectations.  The packaging is also lame.  Over-
all, this is a mediocre product.",1357862400,4,287,4.9375
4295557,1,B004A77FNO,"THis is a great fun show, but these DVDs were created using IDVD an Apple software. The episodes which are 30 minutes, have been compressed and squeezed onto 3 disks. The video is quite poor and artifacted. This is the only video available of this particular series. The only other way to see it would be to find it on line and download it.",1301011200,20,340,4.328125

4295559,5,B004A77FNO,"Growing up in Boston during the fifties there was a five o'clock movie every Monday through Friday afternoon. The allotted running time was an hour and a half. Every once in a while the movie would end early and the time would be filled with a chapter of one serial or another. I was hooked on serials. Serials were shown in chapters, usually lasting 15 minutes each. Major movie studios all produced serials as did minor, now long defunct studios. The serials were a great marketing tool. In order to see what happened next you would have to return to the theater the following week.
Republic studios was the king of serials. No one could beat them. The serials faded away by the early mid 50's. As I watched Commando Cody I noticed a couple of interesting things. Each ""chapter"" lasted 25 minutes as apposed to 15 minutes. All serials ended with cliffhanger situations. Each ""chapter"" of Commando Cody ended with the situation being resolved. From start to end it was an ongoing story about nailing the bad guy. I suspect that Commando Cody was Republic Pictures foray into television series.",1498003200,,1094,4.732984293193717
4295560,5,B004A77FNO,Good stuff.  Saturday morning flashbacks are abundant for those of us born in the late 40's and early 50's.  Who was that masked man with the jet pack on his back?  Commando Cody Skymarshall of the Universe!,1497571200,,207,4.54054054054054
4295561,5,B004A77FNO,Very interesting. Very satisfied.,1497312000,,33,7.5
4295562,5,B004A77FNO,"I remember this series from when I was a kid. The picture is clear and vivid, but my one small complaint is that the show is the Republic serial, not the version I remember from TV. The TV version had wonderful music that this is lacking. Other than that they are identical in scenes and dialog. Still worthy of 5 stars!",1497139200,,320,4.262295081967213
4295563,5,B004A77FNO,The best of the Commando Cody serials with Judd Holdren performing admirably in his lead role.,1496620800,,94,4.9375
4295564,5,B004A77FNO,"This was the best of the Commando Cody/Rocket Man movie serials. (And yes, it was a movie serial. It did actually play in theatres before it aired on TV. And, even though, it didn't have cliffhangers at the end of each episode, it did follow a continuous story over the course of 12 chapters.) The Blu-ray version has excellent picture and sound quality.",1492905600,2,354,4.634920634920635

4295566,5,B004A77FNO,"Olive did a great job with this release. If you're into the old serials you'll enjoy the fun of this release, which plays more like a tv show than a serial (but just as fun). The picture and sound are nicely restored. Would love Olive to release ""King of the Rocketmen"" or ""Adv of Captain Marvel"" like this. For the quality and price, you can't beat this old-time fun on Blu. And if you liked this one, check out ""Flying Disc Man from Mars"", also available.",1490572800,2,457,4.325581395348837
4295567,5,B004A77FNO,Rekindling memories from my childhood!,1488758400,,38,6.8
4295568,5,B004A77FNO,Not your typical serial. The history of this twelve part adventure is that it was made with TV in mind so each episode is also a complete story but had the ability to do another adventure with the same story line in mind in other words no cliff hangers. It still plays well and Holdren is a solid Commander Cody in the lead. I like the Blue Ray transfer  and it still is an enjoyable afternoon romp.,1488067200,,399,4.181818181818182

4295578,3,B004A77FNO,"Commando Cody and his small team defends Earth from an alien intending to rule the universe. Intended as a TV series, this is a continuation of the earlier serials style without the cliff-hangers. Cost cutting is evident with essentially two sets; the office and the space ship and no chases. If you like the Commando Cody character, you will probably like this. Image is quite good.",1477008000,,383,4.818181818181818

4295581,4,B004A77FNO,"Ok....First off just so that EVERYBODY knows. THIS is the Theatrical version of the one NBC aired on TV back in the day. It DOES NOT have that Opening where you see Commando Cody coming out the door and rocketing off into the sky with the voice over announcing ""Commando Cody: Sky Marshal of the Universe!"" and the weird radar tower beeping at the end. or it does not have that ending credits shown on the TV version. These can still be found on bootlegs out there in questionable quality. This being disappointing to me as I wanted the TV version I saw as a kid and nor do they give you any extras. The play menu is kind of jacked as you cannot go back to the main menu once the episode in is play...it just sends you back to the start of that episode. With that said the overall quality is EXCELLENT and it is nice to have these in a cleaner format than just bootlegs. Just wish it was the TV version.",1474675200,12,903,4.1657142857142855
4295582,5,B004A77FNO,"My third one, superb transfer. Highly recommended. Olive films keep it coming.",1474675200,,78,5.583333333333333

4295584,3,B004A77FNO,"Multiple freezes and sound drop outs starting at about 24 minutes into Episode 9 Solar Sky Raiders and continuing into Episode 10 S.O.S. Ice Age.  Rinsed disc with water and dried thoroughly but no difference.  Up to this point I was really enjoying this nostalgic serial from my childhood.  I hope the replacement is better from Amazon and will upgrade my review accordingly.  Don't know if the remaining Episodes 11 and 12 have this problem or not as the disc is unwatchable in its current state.

EDIT:  Replacement disc 2 copy played without error.  Not sure if disc 1 stayed ok.  Added 1 star to my rating.

This is strictly a popcorn serial experience, although some dispute it as a true serial.  Unlike some 1950s sci-fi productions that make some attempt at scientific accuracy, be prepared to suspend all science (and some logic) when watching this series.  People living on Mercury complete with trees is one of the more glaring examples.",1474416000,3,948,4.826086956521739
4295585,5,B004A77FNO,This is a great serial/television show from way back. Excellent picture and sound. Never saw it like this before!,1474329600,,113,5.0
4295586,5,B004A77FNO,"Please be aware that most of these reviews are for an older version.

The September 2016 dvd release by Olive Films surpassed my expectations.  The video is of excellent quality.  I don't know if it was sourced from the original camera negatives, but I wouldn't be surprised if it was, the picture quality is that good.  Olive Films went the extra mile and gave us English subtitles for each episode, too.

These are the original 30-minute Theatrical versions, not the 25-minute edited Television versions.  It's great to see this old Republic serial (okay, okay, episodic series) in first-rate quality.  I didn't think that there was sufficient demand for a 1953 serial to justify Olive Films spending this kind of money on a remastered dvd release, but I'm happy to be proven wrong.

Highly recommended.",1474243200,8,805,4.955223880597015
4295587,5,B004A77FNO,"Olive Films has come through again with their clear picture and sound. I have had other copies of this tv series/serial (yes, I know---that point is up for debate) that have been from watchable to downright pretty poor. Those different ones have varied between the theatrical version and the television version, which is a tad shorter in running time for inserting commercials. (One can tell by the openings and closings.) I can finally junk the others and totally enjoy this version. Olive Films has the full, unedited theatrical non-letterbox version of ""Commando Cody: Sky Marshall of the Universe"". It's always amazing how well Olive Films does with their copies of different films and how great their Blu-ray copies have been. Hopefully we see some more (and better) Republic serials in the future in great quality from Olive Films.",1474070400,21,837,5.072463768115942

8419565,5,B004A77FNO,"The quality of this DVD is Excellent, and I love the fact that they did an edit so that the story is not interrupted by those silly false endings so typical of the serials of old. The story lines are silly, but that just adds to the fun. For example, Commando Cody must go to Mercury to save the Mercurians (a very industrious people) from the Enemies of the Universe. Lots of fun!",1512172800,,381,4.232876712328767
