8469300,5,B000UX6TFW,"I have to politely disagree with the previous reviewer of this workout. I have no ballet experience whatsoever, but I do enjoy fitness DVDs that incorporate ballet moves, such as Bernadette Giorgi's workouts, Pure Barre, NYC Ballet, etc. I've been doing these types of workouts for years and have seen incredible and sleek results in my legs.

I was thrilled with Leisa Hart's workout. Easy to follow (perhaps because of my background with other similiar DVDs), I felt that the swift movement added an extra cardio burn that the other ballet-type workouts don't offer. I love this added bonus, and so turn to this workout often.",1246320000,4,628,4.9245283018867925
8469301,2,B000UX6TFW,"I really wanted to love this, but I can't.  I was looking for a ballet workout.  This is one.  I wanted one I could DO.  This isn't it.

Regular features:  warmup (5 min), ballet dance 1 (10 minutes), ballet dance 2 (10 minutes), bar (7 minutes), bar stretch (5 minutes).  Additional special feature workouts:  sexy scarf (5 minutes), intense stretch (5 minutes), bar (6 minutes).

Performance is pretty straightforward, and it's not very dance-y.  But it is very fast, and many of the movements are awkward.  They also require a lot of ROOM.  Think about being in an empty room by yourself.  That's how much room it needs.  I try it periodically, but I always give it up.  Denise Austin has some ballet moves in Pilates for Every Body that give a better workout than this, and so does Michelle Dozois.  Nothing against Leisa Hart, but this workout just doesn't have the ease, the flow, the fun, or the results to really be worthwhile.

Effective workout for grown, non-ballet dancers, where ARE you??",1219363200,4,1001,4.69364161849711
8469302,3,B000UX6TFW,":) im on my bf's account so please don't think im male)(

im a model and a i also do quite a bit of ballet on the side and i must say she is more a model who can stretch. I give this a 3 star because this is most likely targeted for the beginners so enjoy but for us advanced ballet workouters.  there are better  much much much better",1214784000,,335,3.757142857142857
8469303,1,B000UX6TFW,"I reallllly don't like this one.  I didn't care for the instructor, and I really don't think she should be instructing ballet.  It's very, very, very obvious that she isn't a dancer.  I also found the set and the costumes annoying. I own a LOT of fitness dvds; a lot of those are ballet toning or dance aerobics.  I have to say, there are MUCH better ones available.  (And, btw, this is the only negative review I've posted, I wouldn't be posting one now if I didn't realllllly dislike this one.)",1197244800,9,496,4.406593406593407
8469304,5,B000UX6TFW,"i have to agree with the other reviewer. it is a very well done dvd...all of her DVDs are done well. that is no surprise to me. leisa has been doing this for awhile and she knows fitness. trust this ""Sexy"" series to help you get in shape.",1194220800,4,238,3.9791666666666665
8469305,5,B000UX6TFW,Liked it much more than I thought I would...going to try her other ones too.  Very well done and fun.,1193616000,3,101,4.05
