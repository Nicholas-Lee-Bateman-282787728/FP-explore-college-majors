6508774,5,B00LWLZVT6,"**review for DVD only**

With a lot of these video compilations, I see reviews complaining that it should have had clips from this show or that show, that it should have all of one specific concert, that it shouldn't have included one song or another.  I myself had similar thoughts about the CD version, but in that case, it's because all they did was put select songs from the DVD onto one CD so they could avoid manufacturing a second disc.  The only thing I'm judging the DVD on is, how much do I enjoy what I'm watching?  And the answer is I enjoy it a lot.  A whole lot.

The first disc offers all of the music videos in Ozzy's career (minus one; ""Shot in the Dark"" is excluded due to a dispute over rights to the song).  Watching them is like reliving decades of evolution in music styles, fashion, video technology, music video directing....if you're thinking it sounds like a nostalgia-fest, you're on the right track.  Just watching the changes in Ozzy's hairstyles and stage costumes is almost compelling enough to recommend getting this.  I saw these videos on Headbanger's Ball, at least the ones up through the mid-'90's, so many times back in the day; watching them on the DVD put me right back on the couch in 1989, Saturday at midnight, ready with my blank VHS tape to record any video from bands in my cassette collection.  I loved all of Ozzy's old videos, probably ""Bark at the Moon"" and ""Miracle Man"" the most.  ""Bark at the Moon"" has that '80's campy horror vibe, and ""Miracle Man"" was such a great karma moment for Ozzy against Jimmy Swaggart.  The one video in the bunch I had never seen is ""So Tired"" from the ""Bark at the Moon"" album, and I have to say it's without a doubt the weirdest video I've ever seen.  What in the F??  Watch this one and ""Time After Time"" back-to-back and you'll think someone slipped some LSD into your drink.  Stanley Kubrick meets David Lynch meets Howard Stern is about the only way I can describe it.

The live DVD is awesome, as well, and has the same effect seeing all the phases of Ozzy's career chronologically.  The list just goes on and on of cool performance clips, concert footage, interviews from throughout his career, recording sessions, bonus documentaries; it's packed with material.  There's stuff from Rochester, NY from '81, Albuquerque in '82, a clip of Ozzy with a shaved head for the '82 MTV show featured on the ""Speak of the Devil"" album, Kansas City in '86 from the Ultimate Sin tour, Philadelphia in '89 touring for ""No Rest for the Wicked,"" San Diego in '92, Ozzfests....like I said, the list goes on and on.  The DVD's are well over two hours each and include bonus videos and making-of segments.  Besides that, the packaging looks nice with the appearance of a leather-bound book trimmed with gold foil.  The goal was to chronicle all the phases of Ozzy's solo career, and this set does it fantastically.  Very well done.",1413244800,23,2903,4.563706563706564
6508777,3,B00LWLZVT6,"so far this is the best coverage of ozzy solo career  great to see philly in there from 1989 but where is the moscow peace festival footage this was a pro shot concert footage(LIVE Moscow Peace Festival August 1989 1. I Don't Know 2. Flyin' High Again 3. Shot In The Dark 4. Miracle Man 5. Sweet Leaf 6. War Pigs 7. Tattooed Dancer 8. Suicide Solution 9. Crazy Train 10. Paranoid ) one or two of these would have been excellent and do I have to die before anyone release the speak of the devil black Sabbath cover concert with Brad Gillis replacing Rhandy Road on guitar and why can we get any more than a few songs with Randy Rhoads live in concert I personally must have 40 shows on cd with great sound. I think every dvd should get at least one  on here and some great songs from ozzy personal achieves ( I said an interview where ozzy said I have every show video record and I think he said audio/now digital recording)this seams to be realy great but if you look at his career ther is a lot more to choose from I'd love to see bloodbath in paridise 89 from Allentown PaI huge electrical storm showed up in minutes before that song and storm couds rolled in like a heartland hurricain  and the thunder and lightning clamped almost on cue with the main heavy riff to start the song after the opening lead riff after that song ozzy was forced off stage for 40 minutes for the storm was so bad the Allentown fair ground wanted to stop the show because the rain started to pour insainly from the sky from the side wetting the band too! it was evil I this gezzy shiate him self maybe cause he jumped feet off the ground and back with the first thunder claps. I don't think any one remember ozzy was  a the US festival just about when bark at the moon came out, this dvd set is good but ozzy could find stuff that make it great sadly I might rather get some extra great collections better than this in stead of new solo material why is the cd so damn short,and dvds separate not like a box set they are called the same thing this release should be a box set like",1412812800,2,2060,4.168341708542713

I am 100% happy with this and I cant wait for it to come out.",1408752000,3,393,3.8048780487804876
6508781,5,B00LWLZVT6,"Iron Man wrote his opinion about Memoirs of A Madman, Sorry but Iron Man is NOT a true fan!!!!  Iron Man you might consider to fallow Justin Bibber, Just saying",1408579200,,160,4.333333333333333
6508782,3,B00LWLZVT6,"Sorry, but that bit in the documentary really didn't sit well with me. As a fan for the last 25-30 years, I wasn't amused to see Ozzy watching a compilation of his old videos and not only being unable to remember any of the songs, but knocking them like they were garbage he wouldn't even listen to. Sure, it's understandable for an artist to look at some of their past work with some regrets, and unhappiness, but to not even remember it? It shows a total lack of pride in what you do and what you've done and it's a bit insulting to the people who've supported you all these years and whose lives your work has touched. Sure, Ozzy's done his share of drinking and drugging, as is well-documented and many may feel that explains it. But read Keith Richards' book 'Life'. Despite all the drugs and all the booze (and Keith has at least matched Ozzy in those areas, if not outdone him), Keith can still rattle off every last detail about any Stones song, album or recording. Because he is an artist, and his work is his life's blood. Ozzy's obvious inability to remember his own material speaks to what's been rumored all these years - that the songs were all written for him and everything about his music and his image is something of a creation (he truly is the Wizard of Oz!). So I guess after seeing that, it's a little uncomfortable that this is being dredged out to turn a profit. It's like saying, 'here's some crap I wouldn't bother watching, but you idiots will clearly watch anything, so here it is!'
Will I buy it? Yes, I will - this music and many of these videos were part of my childhood, my teenage years, even my adulthood and I will still put these albums on to this day - even if Ozzy himself doesn't. But the product itself - and I am judging by the description here, it has not been released yet - is a bit lacking.
For a completest - and make no mistake, these kind of packages are aimed at completests - it's infuriating. Why do we get an entire disc that is the complete videos and yet 'Shot in the Dark' - for a time his biggest hit - is missing? Both versions, actually! And why do we get a few songs from the Bark at the Moon home video, a few from The Ulitmate Ozzy home video and a few from the Tower Theater 1989 Pay-per-view and NOT THE FULL CONCERTS? None of those are available (legitimately) on DVD and most fans have been waiting for remastered upgrades of all of them.
You know who did this sort of thing right? KISS. Their KISSOLOGY sets featured complete shows in great chronological order and really offered the fans great remasters of material they only saw on old bootleg tapes. Granted there were songs omitted here and there (mainly to avoid repetition, but again - COMPLETESTS!). Still, they did it right and put everything on over the space of three separate sets and did justice to every era.
This has a lot of great stuff, but think what it could have been:
Disc 1- ALL the videos + the complete After Hours program (and the other Randy Rhoads bits and pieces)
Disc 2- Bark at the Moon concert (complete)+The Ultimate Ozzy andrelated TV appearances
DIsc 3 - Tower Theater + complete Moscow Music Festival set +interviews
Disc 4 - No More Tears era show (there has to be one that hasn't been released)
Disc 5 - We Sold Our Souls to Rock N Roll (the unreleased Ozzfest documentary - whatever happened to that?)+Ozzfest Pay-per-view
Disc 6 - Comic-con performance+Scream concert (Again, there has to be one filmed).
And whether you broke it up into separate volumes like KISS did, or just made it one big package, it would be truly worth it. But, much like with the box-set, they just threw something together because they think the fans will buy anything. Thank you, I love you all...",1407715200,29,3728,4.427947598253275
6508783,5,B00LWLZVT6,"UPDATE:  I am mentioning this given the amount of comments pertaining my mention of ""Shot in the Dark"" not included.  For the record, I ALWAYS RATED THIS COMPILATION DVD with FIVE Stars. I just think thought that as a career collection of Videos, understanding that not all of them would fit, at least one of his biggest video/radio hits should be included. As someone who discovered Ozzy before I discovered Sabbath, through No Rest For The Wicked's Crazy Babies and Demon Alcohol, a friend's mention of Shot in The Dark was what made me seek all his previous albums, including his ""previous band"" which as an 80s kid in a foreign country, I wasn't very familiar with.

ORIGINAL REVIEW:
This is definitely a long-awaited collection of Ozzy's visual material that, up until this release, has never been available in one place and much less in digital media.  Some VHS releases have compiled videoclips, concerts have also been released on VHS and laserdisc, so this is a definitive compilation...of sorts.
One of his most successful videoclips (at least a Top 5 of his when it comes to airplay) is Shot In The Dark, off The Ultimate Sin album.  The video is a great performance clip with Jake E. Lee on guitar but it's not available here.  Any devoted Ozzy fan knows why.  The song was written with Phil Soussan, his bass player at the time and after lengthy legal battles, he has secured publishing rights to this song..his song.  But Ozzy's manager (and wife) is known for retaliatory vindictive actions (ask Iron Maiden, yes, one of the greatest bands on Earth, about her pulling the plug [literally] to wreck their concerts) and that is why Shot In The Dark is not to be found on ANY Ozzy compilation or new release, including this great DVD.
I debated whether to rate it 5Star or 4 based on this omission, but anyone knows Shot In The Dark won't be found on any Ozzy product, so I'm giving it Five for What this IS, rather than for what it's not.
Now, on to the positive and the reason as to WHY THIS IS A MUST BUY...
25 music videos including some never before released on home video.  Many of these were only available on VHS almost 35 years ago.
Alternative version of his most successful videoclip (Mama I'm Coming Home) and two behind the scenes making-of segments.
Live performances from a dozen Ozzy line-ups with many of the wonderful musicians he has brought to public fame such as Rhandy Roads, Zakk Wylde, Jake E. Lee and Randy Castillo.  In fact, for DVD, the Amazon description mentions in detail all the performances and songs included, but I'm adding a description of the band members featured in some of these performances.

Great pressing, super flat, not noisy at all, excellent dynamic range overall. I enjoyed this, though the package could have included a nice booklet or something. One other complaint, the No More Tears edit is really unfortunate. Never do that to great classic songs! It is even worse because the edit itself is not seemless and just abruptly changes in the song. I realize this is a deal breaker for some. I still enjoy the song but have also picked up an original No More Tears vinyl as it was necessary. I do not hate the Kelly Osbourne Changes duet as much as others although difficult to like Sharon or Kelly on any level. This version is not the original but it is not supposed to be. Overall nice to include it. Really the only thing this suffers from is not enough discs as many, many classics are omitted including I Don't Know, Shot In The Dark (thanks Sharon), only 4 songs off the first two! Oh well, a 4 lp set would have been incredible but for what it is I'll take it. The sound of the vinyl is impressive if you are wondering.

6508878,2,B00LWLZVT6,I love ozzy and have longed for a similar DVD for a long time. My biggest gripe with this DVD is there is no 5.1 audio mix. Come on sony/ozzy! I know these videos were going to look like grainy 80s quality but the audio could have definitely been remixed quite easily. People do as a hobby on their computers now in days. It's very ironic that sony music's parent company sony which made it's name by selling high end home audio equipment releases dvds that can't unleash the full potential of the audio equipment's power. Where's the synergy sony? Anyway if you have a nice expensive sony home audio system like myself enjoy listening to it in 2.0 stereo. Thanks sony for screwing a loyal customer.

6508899,5,B00LWLZVT6,"I must say, I swore a long time ago, that I would buy nothing from the Ozzy camp. Due to them robbing so many of the musicians involved earlier on. With that said, I jumped on this, because it seemed to be a nice vast collection of all the forms Ozzy has taken. It has quite a bit of material covered by Jake E Lee, which is what sold me on this. All the extra stuff is just bonus to me. Too bad Jake won't benefit from this. I see a couple reviews that gave this negative reviews because of Shot In The Dark not being on here. It's one song with still some court complications going on, from what I understand. Besides that, I already have it in video form. No loss to me.
Jake even appears to get song writing credits for songs from The Ultimate Sin, but not Bark at the Moon.
They even have a video of Joe Holmes filling in for Zak Wylde in 96. Quite a bit of Zak's earlier contributions is covered on here, which in my opinion is his best work with Ozzy. The collection of videos that are covered when Randy was onboard is great. Yeah, it is not the best quality, but let's face it, it was the early eighties and they probably did not have much to work with. So I will take what I can get.
All in all, a great collection for me to own, since I don't really have that much from the Oz. With the Jake E Lee re-emergence to the music scene, they probably seen a good market to sell this by covering a bunch of his stuff on here and it worked for me.",1420502400,9,1450,3.986254295532646

Other than that, this is a good collection. Disc 2 with the various live stuff over the years, spanning Ozzy & Randy in '81 to the 'Scream' tour in 2010 is a lot of fun.

6508956,4,B00LWLZVT6,"The long awaited video collection is here, find out everything you need to know about this new release, the two DVD set ""Memoirs of a madman"". Unfortunately, the video quality is NOT up to today's standards.. People expecting HD quality will be sadly disappointed. The videos are ALL mastered on Video Tape. Even the intro segments are of VHS quality. To be fair, the audio is top notch, and the widescreen videos are Anamorphic, which is nice. I realize that the videos were mostly mastered on Video tape originally, but that does not excuse the poor quality of the Up-scaling, whoever did this just slapped the video on a DVD with no attention to detail. I understand that it would be costly to re-master the videos, but the video codec used is archaic at best, lots of ""jaggies"" and poorly done. I was wondering why no Blu-Rays of this were released, now I know. The video quality is simply not up to today's standards, not even the recent videos. This 2 DVD set is obviously a cash grab on Sony's part. Many of the live clips on DVD quite are poor. I personally have much better versions of several of the concert clips that were taken from official VHS tapes, and carefully remastered using quality video codecs. Why Sony did not reach out to the fans to find the best versions of some of the previously released clips is beyond me.
All that said, the audio is excellent, and the selection entertaining. Ozzy has participated with interspersed commentary clips. This DVD is worth owning, even with quality issues and his biggest video ""Shot in the Dark"" missing. its nice to have ""No more tears"" in widescreen, but its like OZZY is Sony's bastard child, so they spent NO money on this. Sony just used whatever they had without any real effort to have a quality product. Even with the source material that was used, the picture could have been much better. No 5.1 audio was included, but the audio was very well done and is one of the releases better features. Overall, this release is essential to OZZY fans, but it could, and should have been better. Fortunately, the included widescreen clips are Anamorphic widescreen and the clips are all really cool. The footage that opens DVD 2 has been coveted by fans for years due to its inclusion of Randy Rhoades and the original Band. Great bonus clips are included. Over all an essential if (disappointing) release. God Bless OZZY Osbourne!!",1414108800,3,2393,4.672985781990521

""Oh but this time there's a DVD of some videos!""  That would be great!... if it was 2003.  How about putting more/higher resolution videos on a Blu-Ray Disc?  Or an Amazon/iTunes/Play Store link?  For crying out loud, we are moving into the 4k era and you give us a handful of videos in a screen resolution that now looks bad on most middle tier phones.  I think we have to make a stand at this point, Ozzy fans.  Don't buy this, I implore you.  They are abusing the loyalty of the fans and I personally find it disgusting.  With a full catalogue of material that could be digitally remastered for the high resolution audio era that is finally upon us, and a number of ways to deliver better/more video, this is a pitiful insult.
