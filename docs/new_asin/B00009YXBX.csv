1898270,5,B00009YXBX,"Ive been looking for a dvd with the rugrats werewuff episoed for a long time. The second I saw this DVD i bought it. I love all the episoes they're so cute. Im 19, but I love watching this whenever im bored. I have friends over at my apartment and just hanfg out after a study session and watch it, its great for young children, and those young at heart.",1247356800,,354,4.071428571428571
1898271,4,B00009YXBX,"Wounderful DVD, a must buy for any Nickelodeon halloween fan! Although, I do agree with the other reveiw I do think that they should have put the older Rugrats halloween episode on here. Still a great buy though!",1239321600,,212,4.605263157894737
1898272,4,B00009YXBX,"I love this DVD as I am quite the connoisseur of Halloween specials; I can't get enough of them! Hey Arnold's 'Arnold's Halloween' strikes the jackpot with its War of the Worlds inspired storyline; it's sufficiantly moody and fun. Rugrats' 'Curse of the Werewuff' is a new entry into Nick's Halloween canon and a welcome one at that. A show that has become too precious as of late, this stops before going to far with its own ""cuteness"". I still prefer thir original Halloween episode 'Candy Bar Creep Show', but 'Werewuff' is still highly enjoyable! The Fairly Odd Parent's 'Scary GodParents' is equally hip and funny and SpongeBob SquarePants' 'Scaredy Pants' is perfect. Only the strange inclusion of two non-Halloween related Rocket Power stories stops me forom giving this a five-star rating; they have a Halloween epsiode so why wasn't it included? Their two entires seem pointless and only one is anywhere near being holiday themed. With so many great Halloween epsiodes left off the DVD, one has to wonder at this choice.",1062288000,18,1029,4.953757225433526

1898295,5,B00009YXBX,"Picked this up for my niece and nephew for $5 bucks at a local store. I figure for the price, it's good. There are Halloween episodes of some of Nickelodeon's best television shows. I got it for Hey Arnold, Rugrats, and Rocket Power. They're 9 and 6 so they didn't get to experience these shows the way I did. They do know of Spongebob, however, so that was an added plus. I enjoyed watching the older classics and they liked all the episodes too. Not much to it though. If it costed just one cent more, it wouldn't be worth it.....",1444176000,,532,4.2772277227722775
