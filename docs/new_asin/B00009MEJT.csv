1884688,5,B00009MEJT,This is the second season of the series.  This season picks up where the first left off.  The stories are stronger and the cinematography is improving.  You can feel the characters strengthen and develop. The Action continues as well as the romance making this a teriffic series for all.  The emotional level of the stories increases keeping you wanting more!,1077321600,,359,4.933333333333334
1884689,5,B00009MEJT,"Once again, major kudos to Anchor Bay for doing a first rate bang up job  do they *ever* do anything less then perfection).
For those of you not into the series, buy all of them now. Season 2 of this classic series follows Duncon McLeod (Adrian Paul in many more great performances) as he travels and moves to Europe (the beautiful French countryside, actually). Has he keeps up the supposed front of being happy along with his new business partner Richie Ryan and his beautiful girlfriend Tessa, he goes off in search of his formal life friend's killer (in the excellant ""The Hunters"") and finds The Watchers, which is easily the best plot twist in the entire series: A group of men & women who obsurve & record--but never interfer. Moving the plot(s) along perfectly are toher stand out episodes (possibly the series best) along with more great character actors. The Counterfiet part II is easily one of the best genre closing episodes of all time, as McLeod's lovely (then dead) former partner Tessa is recreated from plastic segeory in a sick attempt from James Horton in an attempt to kill him.
All in all, another phenomenal boxset that's well worth having. With them priced down here there's no excuse for any true fan not to own them all ...",1077235200,3,1249,4.677272727272728
1884690,4,B00009MEJT,"If the first season was about finding the show's footing, the second season of Highlander was all about perfection.  Now, Anchor Bay returns to the spotlight with the complete second season of Highlander: The Series in an 8-disc DVD collection.
THE SERIES
The show's first season ended with a semi-cliffhanger, leaving fans praying for a second season to fill in the blank.  Well, their prayers were answered; the first episode, ""The Watchers"", picks up right where the first season finished.  ""The Watchers"" introduced the secret band of men and women who record the Immortals' lives (hence the episode's title), the Watchers, who late become a key part of the series.  Jim Byrnes makes his first appearance as series regular Joe Dawson here in what is definitely one of the greatest episodes of the series.  But if you think that's great, there are even more masterful episodes in this pack: there were great single episodes like ""Studies in Light"", as well as two outstanding two-parters, ""Unholy Alliance"" and ""Counterfeit"", the season finale.
For season two, everything that was wrong with the first season was fixed here.  There are much more interesting characters (Joe Dawson, James Horton, etc.), better swordfights and Quickenings; as well as a huge improvement in episode enjoyability.  Season two also had the greatest amount of changes in Duncan's life; everytime you think it's all good, something horrible happens - but that just makes it more interesting, doesn't it? [8/10]
THE VIDEO
While the first season featured some slight grain, most of that has been cleared for season two.  The episodes are presented in their original full frame format and look terrific.  I can't find anything to complain about. [9/10]
THE AUDIO
The second Highlander remix is, like the first, presented in Dolby Digital 5.1 surround sound.  As you watch the opening sequence, hear the mystic sounds surround you, and then Queen's ""Princes of the Universe"" blast through the speakers, you can help but feel in heaven.  Again, the music and speaking is occasionally unbalanced, but nothing as serious as in the first season.  [9/10]
THE EXTRAS
The second season of Highlander is no disappointment in the extras area.  It again features the Watcher Chronicles, as well as interviews with the cast and crew.  Especially interesting is the audio and video commentaries by Adrian Paul.  There is also plenty of deleted/alternate scenes.  Of note also is the enormous improvement in DVD design over the first season.  The menus are awesome. [9/10]
I have to say, Anchor Bay has never once disappointed me.  And now, with Highlander: Season 2, it remains that way.  This DVD is even better than the first season - and I thought that DVD rocked!
OVERALL SCORE: [9/10]
----------------------------------------------------------------
THE SERIES: [8/10] Everything the first season was, and so much more.
THE VIDEO: [9/10] I haven't got a single complaint.
THE AUDIO: [9/10] The music and speech are now somewhat balanced.  Another rockin' remix.
THE EXTRAS: [9/10] All the goodies from season one, as well as interviews and audio/video commentary from Adrian Paul.  Excellent.
OVERALL SCORE: [9/10] Another outstanding DVD from Anchor Bay.  Highlander has never been so good.

1884691,5,B00009MEJT,"Anchor Bay has done a beautiful job packaging these DVD sets.  Whereas the first season had an entire disk devoted to bloopers and such, this one has several cut scenes (not necessarily bloopers) right there on each disk with the corresponding episodes.  The Darkness, of course is the most gut-wrenching episode of the entire series, in my humble opinion, making this season, in particular one of my favs.  If you're a Highlander fan at all, these DVDs are ""must haves"".",1064534400,7,471,4.8625
1884692,4,B00009MEJT,"There are excellent episodes of Highlander, (Band of Brothers, The Darkness, Avatar,) there are good episodes of Highlander (Run For your Life, Bless the Child, Homeland,) and there are bad episodes of Highlander (The Stone of Scone, Revenge of the Sword and others). People say that ""The Zone"" (an episode in this DVD volume,) is the worst episode of the entire series. I disagree. The Zone, in my opinion, would go into the ""normal"" episode category. It's not good but it's not bad either. It has a cool scene at the very end that sets up some important Duncan/Charlie continuity that becomes really important later in the season. I have no idea what everyone was talking about when they said it was so awful. I saw this episode for the first time a couple of days ago and I didn't see anything wrong with it. I saw ""Pharoh's Daughter"" (another episode on this disc) for the first time the other night and it was MUCH worse than The Zone. The acting (which is normally excellent,) was bad, the villain's sword looked like a toy and the Ancient Egypt sets were cheap, phony and stereotypical looking. Talk about a stinker episode.
  Highlander Season two, overall, is one of the best seasons of Highlander. I think seasons 1,2,4 and 6 are the best of the series. This is worth the price if you are a fan of the television series. The extras are really cool because you get to see new Interviews with Adrian Paul and Stan Kirsch and you get commentary on each episode from the producers. The commentary is full of insight into the series and you can learn a lot of secrets of the series if you listen to it. This volume also has video and audio commentary from Adrian Paul on a few episodes that is really cool. This is a must for all Highlander fans even if you hate ""The Zone"" and love ""Pharoh's Daughter.""",1062720000,5,1808,4.509146341463414

1884694,5,B00009MEJT,"The concept is a bit screwy, but the acting is supreme. And the leading man is positively mouth-watering! There's a lot to like about this series, and every season does get progressively better/more sophisticated. It is acted so well, you do suspend your disbelief. Even if you don't like science fiction, treat yourself to a hero who isn't a macho jerk!",1058918400,3,354,4.819672131147541
1884695,4,B00009MEJT,"Highlander: The Series had a shaky start in its first season.  Changing tone dramatically mid-season (coinciding with a new creative consultant and a move to Paris), the show started to give hints as to its full potential.  The final episode introduced what would become a major asset for the series: The Watchers.  These are mortal men who chronicle the exloits of immortals without their knowledge.
Enter season two.  Building on this premise, an important new character, Joe Dawson, is introduced as Duncan MacLeod's watcher.  Simultaneously, Duncan loses the love of his life and his juvenile friend becomes immortal.  While these changes are extremely helpful to the show, improving the quality from season one, it won't be until season 3 that Highlander truly transcended its film origins.  From then through season 5 this show became something very special, with the character of Duncan becoming more and more defined.
Until then, we Highlander fanatics have this set to enjoy, and with the exception of a few outright stinker episodes (The Zone is the worst of the entire series), it's a good buy.  You can see the show picking up speed and getting firmer footing.  Even though the real magic is yet to happen, this is a set a Highlander fan just can't do without!",1056585600,10,1272,4.962264150943396

1884787,5,B00009MEJT,"This was a powerful season.

The beginning introduces the Watchers.  An organization that has been documenting Immortals for nearly 2000 years.  They'd sworn never to interfere.  Then one of them had gone rogue and recruited other.  These were an aboration, they were outlaws among the Watchers.  Lead by a madman, named Horton, they hunted any Immortal - good or evil.  The Hunters had been responsible for Darius's death, at the end of the last season.

Later in the season, a hunter abducted Tessa.  Used her as bait for Duncan.  He fought the Hunter and won.  Afterward Tessa and Richie were headed for their car, only to be attacked and shot by a junkie.  Duncan had saved Tessa from a Hunter, only to have her killed by someone too high to even remember doing it.  That same episode also revealed Richie to be an Immortal.  He rose from the dead, to the tragic sight of Tessa dead in Duncan's arms.

The following episodes have Duncan teaching Richie the rules of Immortals, and vigorous sword training.  Eventually leading to Richie's first quickening.  Then Richie heads off on his own, until near the end of the season.

Duncan befriends a Watcher, named Joe Dawson.  Joe was actually Duncan's watcher.  He helps Duncan battle Horton and his Hunters in several episodes.  Xavier St Cloud returns this season.  Xavier and Horton form an unholy alliance, united by their hatred of Duncan.  Mortal mercenaries softened immortals up, and then Xavier took their heads.

The season finale has Horton's final attack on Duncan.  A murderous woman was surgically altered to look like Tessa.  She seduced him, and lured him to Tessa's grave.  What she didn't know was Horton planned to kill her, to make Duncan see Tessa die twice.  The plan backfired.  Instead of weakening Duncan, she helped him finally get over his grief, and, in their final battle, Horton finally perished.",1467158400,,1877,4.869841269841269

I have stayed up & got very little sleep because I can't stop watching. Takes  me back... but it's amazing how the passing of time affects how you remember things.

1884871,5,B00009MEJT,"While I am only reviewing season 2, most of the comments would apply to season 1 and seasons 3-5. Season 6 is for diehards only. Season 1 sets the story. In season 2, the story begins to unfold leading to a dramatic change in season 3-5.

The history of an man who cannot die unless his head is removed from his body. There will be a number of flashbacks going back to the 16th century when Duncan McCloud was born with some interesting characters, some of whom will reoccur in future stories. Almost all stories end with a sword fight with the loser losing his head.

McCloud has his faults and he is not the uneducated, limited range individual of his early days but you do see growth in him. As with all immortals, they are foundlings and we never do get an answer of who fathered them since immortals cannot have children.

If you like any of the first five volumes, you will like them all.

The storyline has also impinged on the real world where you occasional see references to ""there can only be one"". One of the specialty ""Magic"" contests involves a game where you are limited to only unique cards in your constructed deck instead of the usual limit of a maximum of 4.

1884892,4,B00009MEJT,"The second season is a little less than the first since the plot sort of changes from ""there can be only one"", to the main character growing to care more about humanity. Also McCloud's attitude towards Richie his student changes to a sort of negative in my opinion. He had Richie around all that time in the first then kinds of turns on him when he turns immortal due to foul play. Also one who has lived 400 years shouldn't be depressed when his girl friend also is killed due to violence. He should have stayed with immortal women. Richie is also a ""dork"" and should have learned something about life by now. Good sword play though and that's what I like about it.",1397952000,,666,4.379032258064516

After Season 3 I was a fan. My favorite episode of Season 2 was the one with ""Rowdy"" Roddy Piper (I can't spell the title correctly) while my least liked was ""Darkness"" and becuse of the DVD format I can skip that. Few people may not know the Jim Byrnes character was supposed to be in three episodes but went on to become a key character in the series.

I have the whole set except Series one. Which I will buy eventally. The reason you buy series DVD's is the free to air stations in Australia are terrible. They have no loyality to their viewers. When they had Highlander on at the end of season 2, which was often shown out of order, the annoucer actually stated that it was the end of the series. Only after cable started showing season 3 did I realised they had lied to their audience. Better to buy the DVD's, no adds and watch in sequence.

1884966,5,B00009MEJT,"Fans of this franchise will recognize the second season of this internationally popular series as a pivotal one.  The first season had found the series 'voice', establishing how the series was going to be different from the movie franchise.  By the second season the ground rules had been established for the most part, leaving the possibilities open to really define the characters and delve into the problems of immortality.  The episodes in this season were able to move beyond the ""swordfight with the guest Immortal of the week"" format and go to more character driven stories.

The season begins with the 'Watchers' which introduces the secret organization that watches and records the lives of the Immortals, a revelation that results in MacLeod getting a new friend and a new enemy. A few episodes later in the heartbreaking 'The Darkness' Tessa and Richie are both killed but only Richie returns as an Immortal.  This season also sees Mac moving to the dojo and meeting Charlie DiSalvo who will be a recurring character.

The later part of the season returns to Paris and the barge where Mac must come to terms with the recent changes in his life: his role as Richie's teacher; the existence of the Watchers and the losses of friend, Darius (Season 1) and Tessa.

In addition to the episodes themselves each episode includes at least a brief interview giving some background of that episode and has 'Watcher Chronicles' giving character bios from that episode.  Three episodes (The Return of Amanda; Revenge of the Sword and Run for Your Life) also include video and audio commentary with Adrian Paul.  The final disc is a CD-ROM that includes a triva game; all the Season 2 scripts and bios on the season's actors and directors.  This bonus disc, unlike some included in some other dvd sets, plays on Mac as well as PC systems - a happy bonus for Mac users like this reviewer.

This is a definite must have for Highlander fans, even the most casual.  As always with this series the stories are, for the greater part, well written and the characters compelling abd the production values are consistently high making this a set that can be enjoyed through multiple viewings.",1203984000,2,2181,4.833333333333333
1884967,5,B00009MEJT,"It may not have the best episodes (season 5 has those), but I found this and season three to be the best overall. Unfortunately, there is one total stinker in this season, ""The Zone"" and a really silly one, though not in a good way, ""Counterfeit, Part 2""",1188345600,,254,4.3125
1884968,5,B00009MEJT,"In this new season, there are a couple of improvements that make the series even more interesting than season one and therefore bring it up a notch compared to the pure action production we saw before. Don't be afraid, you still get to see swashbuckling scenes and the impressive quickenings, but there is also a layer of the script that has to do with what it means to be immortal and how it affects these people.

At the end of season one, Darius, one of Duncan MacLeod's closest immortal friends, was killed in sacred ground. Duncan was deeply affected by this, and is yearning to find the culprits. This leads him back to the US from Paris, where he spent the second half of last season. In his search he meets Joe Dawson, who is a member of the Watchers, an organization that has been observing immortals for centuries and recording history without interfering. Dawson knew Darius and is outraged by his murder too. Things get complicated when it is obvious that Darius was murder by people within the Watchers organization.

The series this season does a great job with character development, and we get to see Richie and Tessa become an even more important part of the plot. The fact that Adrian Paul, Alexandra Vandernoot and Stan Kirsch improved considerably in their performances also help with enjoying the stories that are not directly related to a confrontation.

I sincerely hope that in the next seasons I get to see the quality continue to develop and the depth of the story evolve. Being able to see how seeing people Duncan cares about grow old, get sick and die affected this character added a level of enjoyment for me that the series did not have before. Also, the writers had to be congratulated for the inclusion of the Watchers, since this makes the series more interesting and opens up a lot more possibilities.",1186272000,,1836,4.695652173913044
1884969,5,B00009MEJT,"The heroic tale of Duncan MacLeod of the Clan MacLeod continues in season two of the popular genre series ""Highlander,"" inspired by the classic motion picture. Picking up where season one ended, MacLeod learns more about the mysterious group known as the Watchers, and starts his friendship with Joe Dawson. The highlight episodes of this fantastic season include:

-""The Watchers,"" the follow-up episode to the season-ending ""The Hunters;""

-""The Darkness,"" where MacLeod faces the loss of his beloved Tessa, while the audience finally learns that Richie is indeed Immortal;

-""Epitaph for Tommy,"" which features a powerful turn by Rowdy Roddy Piper as the villain;

-""Under Color of Authority,"" where Richie takes his first head, and comes into his own;

-""Unholy Alliance I & II,"" where evil watcher Horton teams up with renegade Immortal Xavier St. Cloud to take on Duncan;

-""Pharoah's Daughter,"" a tale featuring Romans and Egyptians, and;

""Counterfeit I & II,"" the powerful conclusion to the season.

Together with great extras and superb picture and quality, season two of ""Highlander"" belongs in everybody's collection of action/adventure TV shows!

1884984,5,B00009MEJT,"Season Two marks a turning point in the Highlander series, when the writers finally break out of the territory established in the original Highlander movie and introduce new ideas. The Watchers are introduced, a secret society of people who have been watching and recording the Immortal's deeds for centuries. While I can't help but wonder if this idea was liberally borrowed from Anne Rice's books, the Watchers quickly became my favorite aspect of the show, especially the tentative and growing friendship between Duncan McLeod and his watcher, ultra-cool guy Joe Dawson. It really adds depth to Duncan's character to see him interact with someone not in ""the biz"" from whom he has nothing to hide. In fact, Dawson may know McLeod better than anyone ever has, including Duncan himself. The abrupt death of Tessa during Season 2 may be upsetting to some fans, but her presence in McLeod's life stagnated the character, and now he is free to go out in new and exciting directions.",1120003200,19,980,4.945454545454545

They also have one less disk, only eight in this season, and the eighth disk is all the special features.
 The introduction for each disk is nice, and is an improvement over the simple splash screen from season one. It features a rock version of Beethoven's Moonlight Sonata, with a few clips from the introduction. Instead of a still for each episode, you have to go directly into them to see the stills. However, the extras are still there, Watcher Chronicles, the Q for the Quickening, and all that. There are still three episodes per disk, except for the seventh disk, which has 4 episodes, leaving the eighth free for special features.
 There are more special features on this disk, although it's still lacking a little. Trivia, Director and Actor Bios, Shooting Schedules and the scripts for all the episodes are all on the eighth disk. Cast interviews or character profiles would have been nice.",1081036800,12,1079,4.73404255319149

Watch Richie grow up over night when he becomes immortal and stumbles along the way as he tries to figure out his place in the immortal world.
Season 2 set the bar even higher as the sword fights and quickenings became more and more dramatic, taking on a life of their own as in ""Epitaph for Tommy"" and the ""Unholy Alliance"" 2-part episode.
In addition each episode has a few minutes of commentaries by Bill Panzer or David Abramowitz that gives you a glimpse behind-the-scenes into how and why these episodes were written the way they were. With many of the episodes there is an additional bonus of lost scenes or rough cuts with commentary by Gillian Horvath describing what we are viewing.
