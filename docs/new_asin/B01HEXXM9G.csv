I'd have to say that this having Alexis Tipton, who I think is probably the best female anime voice over actress, makes it even better. It does have a little darkness to it, but the story (to a certain degree) has a little historical relevance/connection.",1538179200,,298,4.4363636363636365

8765271,5,B01HEXXM9G,"When I first saw Maria the Virgin Witch I had been in a dry spell of anime and manga.  Most of the anime I was watching were bland; I am looking at you Absolute Duo; and my favorite ongoing manga series had taken breaks.  I was just kind of desperate for anything.  I saw that Funimation put the entire series of Maria the Virgin Witch on Youtube so I decided to give this series a viewing.  What I experienced is now in my top 10 favorite anime I have ever watched.  This series revolves around Maria a virgin witch that takes place in a medieval setting that felt similar to Berserk. There are many themes that are similar to Berserk especially around religion and corruption of man.  Unlike Berserk that feels like an epic, Maria the Virgin Witch is not nearly as dramatic and is more of a short story but that is not a bad thing.  The tone of Maria the Virgin Witch is overall lighter than Berserk as well. The main story of this series is that Maria wants to help the people around her even if the church sees her as a heretic.  This want to help leads Maria to trying to break up a war that is being fought in the area by the armies of France and England that are fighting because the monarchy of France had died off leading to England wanting to take over France.  The more Maria tries to break up the conflict the more resentment from said armies, the church, and even gods begin to oppose Maria who just cannot turn her back on conflict and loss of human life in front of her.  I greatly enjoyed this series so much I bought the entire manga and the soundtrack to the anime after watching it on Youtube.  I so looked high and low on the internet to find the complete anime series.  I could only find bootlegs until Funimation announced that they would be releasing the series on Blu-ray and DVD and I never hit a preorder button so fast before in my life.",1478304000,5,1864,4.2492917847025495
8765272,2,B01HEXXM9G,"Maria the Virgin Witch failed on so many levels. It could have been truly great if it had not tried so hard to give fan service perversion at every turn. BJ jokes, sodomy jokes, gay rape jokes, straight rape jokes, and similar crass humor, if you can call it that, abound. The idea was golden, but the execution was horribly flawed.

The plot of MtVW is simple = Maria does not like war. She performs tremendous magical acts to prevent battles, fighting, and killing. God does not like her interference in his great design and sends St Michael to punish her. Now, if she has sex, she loses her magical power.

The audio is, from raw recording to finished product, fully high def digital. Audio quality is good, but not superb. The surround mixing is a little soft and does not offer the expansive environment it should. There is also next to no low hertz tones, even during explosions.

Overall, it is watchable if you can get past the low hanging fruit humor (i.e. the Incubus never acquires his spear).",1476489600,2,1004,4.566666666666666

Maria the Virgin Witch is a surprising anime to come out of the woodwork. For a medium known for its creativity and diversity it's surprising to have something so different come out of such a unique medium.

Maria the Virgin Witch is the story about a witch named Maria ho lives during the Hundred Years War. She uses her magic to stop battles and keep people from killing one another. However, given that she is a witch it draws the attention of the church who condemns her actions, merely because she is a witch. From here is it a criticism of the church, God, sex, love, and salvation (among other things).

Already some people may decide if they think this premise is their kind of show or not. I will warn you (those who are indeed religious) the show has such lines as a character forgiving God for his transgressions, accusing the Archangel Michael as being nothing but a tool for God, among other things. I have heard that some people were offended by this show. I personally wasn't, but your thoughts may vary.

The DVD release

Funimation did a good job with the release of this series, though it is fairly bare bones. The coolest thing is that instead of including a glossy cover for the slipcase, it is matte. Which I feel matches the overall feel of the series. The art on the covers and inside itself is all very standard and doesn't include any cool deviations or anything like the releases of Selector Infected or Dance in the Vampire Bund.

The blu-ray rip looks absolutely stunning. Not all shows have a bluray that is worth the money, but this one definitely does. The colors are sharp and visuals crisp. It's just amazing!

Now for the biggest downside of this release: The bonus features. I am glad that this series has the two episodes of commentary, but other than the US trailer for this show and the textless OP, that's it. I would have liked more with the show as it really is a fascinating and introspective show, but I digress. For the price it is okay, not great, but okay.

The actual show

The animation for the show is good, not great, but good. There are definite moments of reused frames throughout the series and the action itself seems rather stilted and expressionless. This is a letdown given that Production IG are the animators. However, with a show as specific as this with an even more specific demographic, I was not expecting a huge budget for animation.

The characters themselves go from great to cardboard cutouts. The main three witches (Maria and 2 friends) are the only ones out of the group that really get any screen time, the priest is a fantastic character. Think Judge Claude Frollo in an anime. And the rest of the characters i nthe series fulfill their purpose of progressing the plot. Again, none are horrible, but only a few are great.

Normally  do not address this, but I feel the fanservice in the show must be addressed. The first three episodes or so have a lot of sex jokes and nudity (I mean come on, with a title like that, what were you expecting?). I feel like these episodes were only inundated with so much fanservice because the creators knew that the show would be hard pressed to get a lot of viewers. And everyone likes boobs right? But I digress, the fanservice became too much at times which did dampen the viewing experience for me.

Overall, I adore Maria the Virgin Witch. I think it is a fantastic and fascinating critique of religion and sex and hope for more anime like it in the future.",1476230400,7,3492,4.54140127388535
