8243361,4,B00120S8X8,"Unless you have a time machine and HDNET, this the only way to see The World's Coastlines from Above: Europe.
However, it is a French production, with a european region code. This will not play on your region 1 dvd player, and you must buy a multi-regional instead. That said, if you've been searching for this program for years (like me), then this is as good as it gets...",1433376000,,374,4.434782608695652
8243362,4,B00120S8X8,I loved these videos when I originally saw them a few years ago on TV. The aerial shots are wonderful. I would never be able to see these sights as beautifully in person! It was well worth buying a multi-region DVD player. I will watch these over and over whenever I feel the need for a quick vacation!,1402185600,,302,4.224137931034483
