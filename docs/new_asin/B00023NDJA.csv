2060374,4,B00023NDJA,"Commander X is the pseudonym used by a person who is reportedly a former U.S. Government intelligence agent from the NSA who worked in a remote viewing project.  He has distributed a lot of information from alleged personal experiences and insider contacts to provide glimpses of what goes on behind the scenes with ETs, the Global Elite/NWO, mind control, secret technologies, and more.  Probably the best part of this video is X's expressed view that we all are connected to the Creator and don't need any religion to intermediate.  The video shows scenes of the speaker with his face blacked out, interspersed with a variety of video clips, photos, fractal and kaleidoscopic art, metaphysical drawings, and more.  The voice is altered and it's almost a cliche that the speaker is upsetting folks in the government/NWO by sharing what he knows.  Obviously, if information is classified then those who have taken an oath to serve government agencies can be dealt with in unpleasant ways for releasing what they have discovered.  Thus, I think it is unusual for people like X to directly present their findings to the public unless it is being done openly as an approved leak or dissemination of confusing disinfo.  The speaker here is disguised [though it would seem to me that it might not be too hard for the government to identify him and track him down].  He admits that he doesn't have all the answers and seems to be a bit more calm than some other people that have presented their ideas about ETs & NWO topics.  Overall I thought this video was interesting, though I found the organization of images presented to be inadequate at times even while I really liked many of the computer generated fractal, kaleidoscopic, and hypnotic images.  This video seems to present information in a more cogent and up-to-date manner than past Commander X books, so if you liked the books this video should interest you.",1119744000,23,1912,4.855384615384615
2060375,5,B00023NDJA,"For those who follow current thinking on UFOs and conspiracy theory, the name Commander X is already legendary. His books and articles have captivated his readership for many, many years, as he provides vital information on the delicate machinations of the New World Order and the UFO/alien presence and their possible collusion in an effort to enslave the world to a degree that is not even imagined by the average person today.
Commander X was introduced to this dark underbelly of covert political manipulation of the public when he worked as a ""remote viewer"" for the U.S. military. The remote viewing project was an attempt to create a kind of ""psychic spy"" who could obtain intelligence information by simply ""seeing"" a given target in his mind's eye. After the remote viewing program was closed down, it received widespread publicity in the early 1990s, but was usually debunked as a woeful misuse of our tax dollars.
But for Commander X, it was just the beginning. From friends and contacts with extremely high security clearances, he began obtaining information that involved not only a secret plan to take away our Constitutional freedoms and impose martial law, but also an even stranger conspiracy between the world's leaders and an alien race who has been trading technology for human ""test subjects"" since just after the end of World War II.
This DVD is the most recent attempt by Commander X to get the truth of this dire situation out to the world at large. We see Commander X standing at a lectern, with his face blacked out and his voice electronically altered to mask his true identity, as he delivers his lecture in a secure online broadcast to a select audience of government and military officials, many of whom are hearing this information for the first time. That may not be as farfetched as it sounds. There was an article in ""The Los Angeles Times"" a few years back that dealt with a secret cable television broadcast to military personnel and intelligence agents in which classified material was often discussed in the form of a daily briefing, like watching ""The Today Show,"" except one would have to have the required ""need to know"" to tune in.
In his lecture, Commander X does a wonderful job of summarizing what is known to date about the New World Order and its minions, most of whom form the neo-conservative movement in the country today. He calls the current George Bush a puppet leader of the movement, chosen because he is ""slow and easily manipulated."" Commander X also gives a detailed examination of the state-of-the-art in mind control technology, as well as the baits that may be used to sell the public on the notion of implanted electronic microchips that can function as permanent I.D. cards and would constitute an invasion of privacy for the masses previously unheard of in any earlier totalitarian regime.
And then there are the Nazis, whose influence, Commander X says, permeates a large portion of the current advances in many areas of technology. When the U.S. imported Nazi scientists in the late 1940s, in order to learn more about the secret weapons they had developed during the war years, a kind of Trojan Horse effect began to take hold, aiding in the spread of a form of covert fascism that is slowly preparing to control the world and create a nightmarish form of oppression that is truly terrible to contemplate.
The lecture delivered by Commander X is inter-cut with graphics and photographic images that help flesh out his words, and in combination with his disguised speaking voice, the effect is mesmerizing in the extreme. While it is not possible in the limited amount of space available here to go into more detail about the facts Commander X presents, it should be noted that the lecture ends with a prayer that we be spared the cruel loss of our many freedoms to a New World Order that is primarily concerned with its own power and wealth. We can only hope that it's not too late for that prayer to be answered.",1083715200,83,3980,4.794759825327511
8021568,4,B00023NDJA,"I took the time to watch this on youtube. The information on this dvd is excellent. The applause seems real,...REAL CHEESY. And not nessesary, were it not a press conference. Ive seen dvds before like this,and none had the amount of good information this has. Its Comander X ,blk room, blk spot over face. They really wanted to hide his face,and what they did , worked. Im going to buy this dvd.",1423785600,,395,4.5
8021569,1,B00023NDJA,"This video is a faked lecture, with applause track, pretending to be some lecture by a famous underground someone.  The conspiracy info is nothing not commonly available on Youtube.  Waste of money.",1295481600,,198,5.15625
8021570,5,B00023NDJA,"If you want a hint of what is going on behind the curtain of deceit and disinformation, then this is the DVD for you. Many people have refused to believe that the information contained in this informative video is true, so they mock and insult it. Don't let these naysayers dissuade you from viewing and deciding for yourself. You will not be disappointed! There is a lot more going on in this world that is being kept secret from a broad range of the population...just look at the current sad state the country is in right now. You will see that this DVD will really speak to you and offer answers to some of the most confounding mysteries of the modern age.",1196726400,,659,4.409836065573771
8021571,1,B00023NDJA,"I couldn't get this DVD to play on my or my freinds player; I think the thick-DVD-lable had something to do with it not working -homemade. While I waited the long month for this DVD to arrive, a friend,in black, lend me one of Commander Xs books and I also searched the interNet for this conspiracy stuff. On the World.wide.web -for free- I found a lot of what CommanderX talks about in his books ,again, for free ! (""Dolce Wars,Richard Sauder"", utube search, etc). Why is Commander Xs stuff so expensive and his books so thin? While I believe there is a Alien Agenda, Government Conspiracies, I have a hard time trusting Commander X is who, he says he is.",1191456000,,656,4.475
8021572,1,B00023NDJA,"This DVD has been presented in such a way that it looks like a deliberate attempt to make genuine covert issues and government secrets appear moronic. It appears to be a reverse psychology attempt to create disinformation to purposely cause the public to lose interest in these issues. It is very similar to the way the government infiltrated UFO groups in the 50's to cause disruptions within the groups.
I'm sure the speaker was paid well by the government to make this DVD.
It is not worth your time or money. There are many excellent DVD's out there which are well done and worth the time to watch such as George Knapp's productions. This is even worse than that government paid skeptic idiot they keep interviewing on TV to slant the program away from credibility... This one takes the cake as THE WORST! And the lecturer is nothing more than a fake to drive people away from the real issues. He adds just enough reality and then adds so much junk to it that you can't possibly believe such craziness. It is just pathetic.",1187913600,3,1027,4.586956521739131
8021573,1,B00023NDJA,"As a believer in UFOs and much of the paranormal, I'm pretty open-minded when it comes to outr subjects that fall outside the mainstream of public opinion.  With almost no knowledge of Commander X, I was certainly prepared to give him the benefit of the doubt and hear him out.  In a matter of minutes, however, the only thing Commander X convinced me of was the fact that he is way out there on the lunatic fringe.  This is the kind of guy that makes all ufologists, including the most serious, scientifically rigorous of researchers, look like fools to the average man or woman.  What do we know about the guy?  Only that he claims to be a retired military intelligence official who was one of the early participants in remote viewing tests.  We don't know his name, nor do we get to see his face in this particular video - ostensibly because government agents are hot on his trail looking to take him out.  I'm more inclined to believe he remains anonymous because some guys in white coats are looking for him.  There is supposedly a small studio audience with him, along with unknown persons watching via a closed circuit Internet broadcast.  Is there even such a thing as a closed circuit Internet broadcast?

You do have to give the guy some credit for coming up with such a huge number of crazy ideas and attempting to connect them all together - despite the fact that some of them contradict one another.  He leads off with an attack on the supposed New World Order, bemoaning the fact that this secret organization has now gained extreme power through puppets such as President George W. Bush, both American political parties, the UN, and basically everyone who has ever said or done anything that even remotely affects the lives of others.  Commander X claims that the NWO is behind basically everything, sowing the seeds of a military theocracy in the United States.  Ted Bundy, the Son of Sam, and the Columbine killers?  All victims of secret governmental mind control.  Islamic terrorists?  Merely government agents creating the conditions for a fascist state that would deny all Americans their freedom.  He goes on to make ever more laughable charges about the secret government and mind control before moving on to UFOs.

According to Commander X, not only did the Nazis have contact with an alien race, their extraterrestrial allies helped the Nazi elite escape to secret bases in Antarctica and South America along with their own working UFOs - and this secret Nazi power base continues to have a huge effect on world governments, especially those in South America.  Byrd's expedition to Antarctica in 1946, he tells us, was actually a secret military operation against Nazi underground bases, a mission that failed badly.  The alien threat, we are told, saw the NWO shift into high gear, as aliens are the only threat the NWO cannot contain or corrupt.  That is why they are always leaking information to the public about them.  The American government itself, we learn, has had a number of secret deals with the aliens but have been betrayed time and time again.  That's why it's hastening its efforts to discover alien artifacts - including those buried somewhere in Iraq (see, it wasn't about oil at all).

Basically, every ""fact"" Commander X makes public is more outrageous and laughable than the last: cell phones used for mind control, the removal of human souls to be replaced by alien essences, etc.  It just goes on and on.  After 90 minutes of this rambling ""lecture,"" I would be hard pressed to believe this guy if he told me two and two are four.

The production value of the presentation is less than impressive, as well.  Alongside his hidden face and electronically modified voice, you get a slideshow of historical as well as weird, meaningless images.  Early on, there's also some obvious canned applause - along with intermittent coughs apparently intended to prove that he does indeed have an audience.  He doesn't.  The kicker comes toward the end, though, when someone off-camera whispers in his ear that the broadcast may have been detected and its secret location identified.  It's a perfectly appropriate ending for such a farcical presentation.",1152316800,15,4189,4.8316970546984574
8021574,1,B00023NDJA,"Sorry, One star, is the lowest rating, I could give.

The information on this DVD is so secretive, even the canned applause, is disguised.

Who is that man behind the big black dot?  Al Frankin, maybe?

I think, the real reason for covering his face, is to avoid being tarred and feathered, should he be recognised by the people who wasted their money on this DVD.

Anyone who is interested in real government cover-ups, would be better off spending their money, on ""Out Of The Blue.""

The shocking truth, is that the production is juvenile, at best, it is filled with mis-information and it's insulting, to all intelligent life, throughout the Universe!",1134604800,20,654,4.794642857142857
8021575,5,B00023NDJA,"This item is the real deal...no question about it. If it wasn't, then why have the distributors of this DVD been threatened, stalked, and blackmailed by the US government while the people who edited and reproduced it have been seized as quietly as possible, held incommunicado, and jailed without a trial? The legitimacy of this document is also compelling evidence for why the original source of this footage has been captured, had his/her history effectively erased from existence and, for all of us on the ""inside"" know, killed. Also, the fact that Amazon.com has received sternly-worded threats from the Pentagon and is now under investigation by the Department of Homeland Security as well as the FBI for distributing classified, highly-sensitive material for peanuts is disturbing as well.

This is all well and good, but people with no radar for sarcasm need not apply. Get a grip, kooks. This crap makes Rapture Ready look marginally sensical.  However, if you find extra-strength paranoia that's bound to be archaic and laughable in a few years as entertaining as I do, skip this one and check out the quaint little 1999 VHS of ""Y2K--Hidden Dangers of Martial Law and a Police State"".  It's a steal at $13.97.  Apparently, good 'ol Billy Clinton had a plan in place to enact martial law and mobilize FEMA in all fifty states once the grid went down and the sh*t hit the fan.  Just a friendly recommendation.",1121644800,17,1416,4.907949790794979
8021576,1,B00023NDJA,"Wow, what a piece of garbage. Get this only if you have money you need to get rid of or an hour of your life you need to waste. This wasn't even bad in a cheesy way, it was just bad. There's no lecture. There's a guy standing behind a black spot pretending like he's talking while there's a bad overdub of the same tired old stuff, with occasional applause and someone coughing to convince you it's real. Save yourself the trouble and watch an old rerun of Hawaii 50. How do you make this thing say 0 stars?",1120348800,18,507,4.1313131313131315
8021577,2,B00023NDJA,"The only reason I gave this DVD more than one star is because of the few facts contained within this lecture. It seems as though this person read a few books and has done a little research on various subjects from conspiracy theories, to remote viewing, and compiled them all in one just to give himself a little bit of credibility so he can make a few dollars.

He wants to give the impression that he is lecturing in front of a group of people when in actuality, he is just speaking into a camera with maybe one or two people with him in the room. In the beginning, there was a round of applause that was obviously an added effect similar to a laugh track system. At the end, he had somebody whisper in his ear and he then said that the lecture needed to end because he had just been informed that somebody has possibly discovered the location of the secret meeting that was taking place. This obviously was bogus considering the fact that an applause track was an added effect that even the most novice producer of movie and or music(such as myself) would recognize.

Furthermore, most if not all of the images used came from other publications and websites and in no way proved any of his points to be valid. Most of them I recognized from simple artwork of others seen on various places. Moreover, they were shown over and over again, a technique used often by those who mislead because they lack the facts to support what they are saying.

He claims to be an ex-military remote viewer and even gave specific locations where he worked, that were also similar to many other remote viewers from back in the late 70's, who have written many books ever since the information has been declassified.

It is of my opinion based on the deception that I noticed while viewing this DVD, that this man is just taking the facts he had learned from various ex- military authors(similar to the false wizard on Harry Potter) and using it to prove his case and create his own identity.

I bought this DVD to see whether or not I would purchase and read any of his books, but anyone can take what I have learned from remote viewing and the underground media, write books, and profit off of those who do not know any better.

I could be wrong, but from what I have witnessed, this man seems to be a fraud.",1119830400,15,2292,4.40661938534279
