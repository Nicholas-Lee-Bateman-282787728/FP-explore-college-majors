8185806,5,B000OONQ7G,"Yamato moves in with his Aunt, who runs an apartment complex and bath house for women. His neighbor, Suzuka, turns out to be a classmate and he becomes captivated by her beauty and determination. He joins the track team to become closer to her and try to understand her. Suzuka is a hard sell with a damaged heart, and Yamato is going to have to get the gold to impress her.

This is one of the best romance animes I've seen. It's a very touching and emotionally heavy story. There are lots of great characters and plot twists. The thing that makes this anime great for me is the character development. You really get a great understanding of the characters and why they think the way do. There is nothing about this anime that isn't fantastic. I think anyone can get a lot of enjoyment out of it. It's a great buy.",1354924800,,815,4.3618421052631575
8185807,4,B000OONQ7G,"If you've been enjoying the Suzuka anime you will most likely enjoy this volume. It contains a major plot twist that helps keep the story fresh after the climax of volume two. The animation and voices (Japanese) are well above average, so it's easy to get into the story without being distracted, but this being volume three of the series I'm sure you've already made your mind up about those aspects. One thing I do find a bit strange is how they have pictures of characters in the original manga style rather than the quite different anime style on the DVD cover. Overall a great addition to this apparently polarizing anime series.",1191974400,,634,4.669642857142857
