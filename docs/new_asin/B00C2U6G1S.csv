8576720,5,B00C2U6G1S,"I am thrilled that Fox has finally decided to release some of Jane Withers' films on DVD!  This is a wonderful film and it is not at all hard to see why Jane Withers rivaled Shirley Temple in the top 10 Box Office stars in the mid 1930's; yet her films have been buried to all but her ardent fans who, until now, have had to seek out second rate bootleg copies.

Withers worked for the same studio that Shirley did, but was put on the ""B"" lot.  Her films were lower budgeted but in many ways are superior to Shirley's films in story content and character development.  Given a little more freedom on the back lot of Fox, Jane herself was often involved in the casting of her films as well as her scripts.

If your only experience with Jane Withers on film was the creepy little brat who terrorizes little Shirley Temple in Bright Eyes, you're in for a treat.  Jane's characters were never that nasty again, but she certainly always played a boisterous tomboy with a knack for getting into trouble and a heart of gold!

This is a story of the supreme sacrifice one friend makes for another in order to save her from being adopted by an abusive family.  I won't go into the plot here, but this is a wonderful and enjoyable film with some twists and turns.  I really just wish the ending could have been a little bit longer! :)  If you enjoy this film, Paddy O'Day is a must see as well!  Thank you Fox - keep 'em coming!",1379635200,5,1418,4.253731343283582
