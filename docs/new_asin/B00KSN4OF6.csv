8661195,5,B00KSN4OF6,"This documentary about Naples could not have been compiled any better regarding both the audio and video composition.  The quality of this DVD is that of the premier features seen on PBS, The Travel Channel, IMAX theaters, etc.  It rivals the Aerial America series and is a must see for anyone visiting the Sunshine State.",1410912000,,322,4.836363636363636

""Naples, FL Paradise Redefined"" Blu-Ray or Standard DVD which I watched this month, I would love to have as a visitor from elsewhere at the hotel or restaurant I was patronizing.  These can be made with a ""Private Label"" for distribution. I am so glad I first visited ABG World Video in 2006 when I was working in the Vanderbilt Beach area.  I have had family events recorded for YouTube. Alex Goldstein has also done the background skating music recently for Olympians Meryl Davis and Charlie White.  Naples is so lucky to have the talent of Alex Goldstein and Marina Berkovitch who exemplify their art with so much integrity, altruism, good will and love.
I recommend ABG World Video without reservation.",1403481600,,722,4.806451612903226
