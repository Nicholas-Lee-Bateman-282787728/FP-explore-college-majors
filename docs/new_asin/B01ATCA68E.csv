8748390,3,B01ATCA68E,"I w as drawn to this movie because I myself am adopted and found my birth mother less than a year ago. My experience was different from Candy's - as every adopted person whom I've met has their own unique story. I like that her experience meeting her biological family isn't perfect and some biological family is more welcoming than others. I didn't like how slowly this movie started. Also, Candy, the main character, isn't the most likeable person. This is why I only gave this 3 stars. Luckily, the movie rallies and the later part is worth the watch. This isn't the best Hallmark movie I've seen, but I appreciate that they made a movie that brings this issue to life.",1526515200,,672,4.516393442622951

8748394,5,B01ATCA68E,"Awesome movie!  Well written with high caliber cast... So often stories regarding adopted and blended families are portrayed horribly but this story is very realistic - highlighting the good, the bad and the ugly of a challenging situation. Great job to all involved and connected. Looking forward to more projects from SWIRL.",1510531200,,326,5.269230769230769
