2740444,5,B000MRA5EM,A beautifully done adventure of amazing ocean creatures.  The visuals are great and it is very informational.  I was in awe as I watched the movie. My grandson is 8 and he loved it too.,1179100800,4,185,4.257142857142857
2740445,4,B000MRA5EM,"The photography is fantastic and I fully enjoyed the DVD, but it sure would look better on a really big screen instread of my 26"" (even though it is an LCD).",1178928000,,157,4.096774193548387
2740446,4,B000MRA5EM,"Movies made for Imax theaters are often great for viewing at home.  I found this out with this movie; I missed it at the local Imax theater, but then saw it on DVD, and was glad I saw it.  The movie looks at life in the shallow regions of the oceans, primarily ocean reefs, so the title Deep Sea is not quite appropriate.  The narration is by Johnny Depp and Kate Winslet, and is quite good in being subtle and not overbearing.  The photography is great, and viewers are shown numerous creatures great and smal.  Many of the scenes are of eating, specifically one creater eating another.  However, there is no bloody gore of sharks munching other creatures, hence the movie is fine for little kids.",1178841600,,698,4.5
2740447,3,B000MRA5EM,"The DVD's description says ""for age 3 and up"" and I agree -- this is a great film to view as a family, to begin discussing how we all need to be good keepers of our earth. Provides good overview of the ""circle of life"" and balance in ecosystems between predators and prey. Since it's a short film, it will hold the attention of all but the most squirmy youngsters. But for adults who have viewed a lot of films about sea life, this doesn't provide many highlights -- with the exception of Winslett's lively narration counter-pointed by Depp's relaxed, hypnotic voice ... and Elfman's clever score.",1178496000,,597,4.588785046728972
2740448,2,B000MRA5EM,music drowns out audio. why have a naration if the music makes it not possible to hear.,1178496000,2,87,4.176470588235294
2740449,5,B000MRA5EM,I thoroughly enjoyed this IMAX production.  I learned about the different forms of sealife and how their survival depends on each other.  It also sheds life on how humans are destroying this marine life by continuing to fish for these exotic fish.  Johnny Depp and Kate Winslet do a wonerful job on the narration.  It is almost like they are just having a conversation between themselves.  It was very informative and entertaining.,1178409600,,431,4.930555555555555
2740450,3,B000MRA5EM,"This film barely rates 3 stars. The photography is good, but the content is limited and the title ""Deep Sea"" is really a misnomer as most of the photography is shot at a depth of 50 feet or less. At 40 minutes, the film is too short to show much diversity and it is actually much shorter because the director also uses valuable footage to make a case that we are overfishing the ocean by showing dead reefs, etc.",1176076800,3,412,4.227848101265823
2740451,4,B000MRA5EM,"Since this DVD is only 40 minutes long I passed on buying it, but it is absolutely worth the rental fee. The footage is up to the usual breathtaking IMAX standards. Crytal clear and with vibrant colors even on the small 19 inch set I watched it on. If you've watched any number of undersea documentaries, you're probably already familiar with most of the sealife that is covered, but again it's the visuals that make this so breathtaking as well as the message that much of this life is being destroyed by man (as usual) and most be conserved. I highly recommend it. The only reason I rate the DVD with 4 stars rather than 5 is that it's not even an hour long and there are no bonus materials what so ever. But the 40 minutes are well worth the a rental.",1175904000,2,754,4.27972027972028
2740452,5,B000MRA5EM,One of the best documentaries Ive seen! Fantastic visuals for all ages! It truly highlights the beauty and diversity of the strange creatures in our oceans.  Truly beautiful!,1175817600,,174,5.214285714285714
2740453,4,B000MRA5EM,"This DVD is focused explisitedly on the ocean where no one has been before to film beautiful creatures of the deep. The IMAX effect though is somewhat lost because of TV size. The film seemed short to me ,although well done. Johnny Depp and Kate Winslet do a good job narrating but in end is message to save our seas , which makes more a documentary than entertaining film.",1175558400,,373,4.420289855072464
2740504,5,B000MRA5EM,"Really enjoyed the voice of Johnny Depp, but he doesn't do the entire job, he shares time with a woman. I think this Deep Sea documentary is well done, lots of cool critters to see and the kids liked it!",1484438400,,203,4.1

2740612,5,B000MRA5EM,"The very first 3D title I watched on my new LG display was
Under The Sea which I gave a rousing review for and which
had set my hopes high for future Imax releases.

Not all the Imax releases have been stellar in 3D.  The best
Imax releases come from Warner Bros. while the only one from
Image worth considering is Grand Canyon Adventure.

I mention Under The Sea 3D early on because Deep Sea 3D
serves as the perfect companion piece to that release.  In fact,
I'm happy to say that Deep Sea 3D may be the better of the two
releases by a small margin.

There are many important elements that make Deep Sea 3D
one of the most entertaining Imax releases.  First, it's an
incredibly well photographed documentary that really brings
out the best the 3D format offers.  Secondly, it's narrated by
Johnny Depp and Kate Winslet.  To top it all off, it offers a
compelling soundtrack from composer Danny Elfman.

Famed oceanic filmmaker Howard Hall takes viewers on an
immersive adventure along coral reefs where you meet the
most exotic creatures that inhabit the underwater sea including
Black Grupers, Sand Tiger Sharks and Barracudas.  Some of
the highlights we see include a battle between a California
Mantis Shrimp and a hungry Octopus; the Humboldt Squid
which rapidly changes its colors; a Sun Star devouring its
prey.

Along the way we learn about the underwater ecosystem
and how it is carefully kept in balance.  We also learn how
man is taking more than the ocean can give.  I was shocked
to learn that 90 per cent of the big fish have disappeared from
the ocean in the past 50 years.

The 3D presentation is an outright treat to watch thanks
to the astonishing camerawork and image detail.  You will
be equally amazed as I was to watch my display transformed
into an underwater world where everything seemed within
reach to touch.  The assortment of dazzling colors of coral
and fish are visually stunning.  There is amazing separation
and depth here and the high definition photography allows
you to get close enough to these creatures where there is so
much detail to digest.  Certainly the day footage looks far
more impressive than the night footage which comes across
flat and presents some very minor ghosting issues particularly
in the scenes involving darting squid.

In Under The Sea 3D I really loved the way fish came right
off the screen, inches away from the viewer's face.  There
isn't anything here as prominent, but there are some really
cool ""In Yo' Face"" moments that include jellyfish filaments
that nearly brush your nose and small fish that scurry in and
out of the viewing screen.

Thankfully, audio quality is equally as submersive. You
really have to give credit to the amount of effect noise
added to this film.  The movement of even the most
minute underwater creature is brought out in astonishing
sonic detail.  I would like to think these were captured
authentically by underwater microphones, but I would
argue that there has been a lot of audio augmentation
done here.  The score by Danny Elfman is very nice with
lots of his familiar signature moments that feature eerie
chorals.  There is rarely a moment where the surrounds
aren't filled with the sound of moving water.

I did find one glaring problem with the presentation and I
had to actually check other reviews of this disc to see if
anyone had noticed it -- and they didnt.  The aspect ratio
changes several times where faint black bars are put on
either side of the screen, or alternating from one side to
the other.  What's strange is that bars are transparent so
the image remains in its proper ratio beneath it.  I am
wondering if this is a mistake in the transfer or something
unique to my hardware settings.  I would sort of doubt the
latter as if it were a settings problem it would be consistent --
and it isn't.

CONCLUSION

Imax scores again with another demo-quality 3D release
that's guaranteed to delight everyone in the family.  I found
this to be slightly more entertaining than Under The Sea
for the overall subject matter, the more lively (but still
sounding scripted) narration by Depp and Winslet and the
underlying score from Danny Elfman.

I am a little concerned about the ratio problem where
faint black bars suddenly come and go at the screen sides.
I don't think the studio will address the problem and really,
it's a minor distraction in the scheme of things.

The only other nitpick I can make is the price.  Once
again we have program content that runs at 45 minutes
and the studio is pricing the title at a $45 MSRP.  That's
pretty inane when you consider full-length 3D features
are offered at the same price point or less.

Place Imax Deep Sea 3D at the top of your list of titles
to purchase for your new display.",1453075200,,4741,4.653846153846154

This is worth having. I love to watch this for the visual effect. The narrative is OK. It isn't for science education. It's the next best thing to snorkeling. It makes me wish there were just a simple underwater 3D blue ray with some nice music.",1389312000,,372,4.391304347826087
2740940,1,B000MRA5EM,"I got this DVD from the library and I'm thrilled I didn't buy it. I hated the music - really annoying, and the narration wasn't the greatest either. I quickly got tired of watching fish eating other fish,etc. Also the jellyfish and sea jellies weren't really well photographed either. The only part I really liked was watching the turtles who go to a certain place where fish eat the algae that has grown on their shells. Then when they're all cleaned up, they're on their way. I've seen other IMAX DVDs but was never too impressed.

If you want to see beautiful underwater photography, look for TONY HELSLOOT'S Ambient Collection. He has many DVD's and they always impress me. His jellyfish DVD alone is gorgeous. He also has DVD's about birds, nature (Fall is my favorite), and much, much more.  Go check his out! So much better, in my opinion.",1389225600,,846,4.633333333333334

There are many underwater epics in 3D but these guys get it right. The color is beautiful and the 3D is as perfect as one can get under the circumstances. You'll forget you have the glasses on. And since you're underwater you'll feel like you need them on anyway! Color is a problem underwater due to the light being filtered. I can't imaging how hard it was to light the subjects as well as they do, and still operate the mammoth rig it takes to capture 3D. Great 3D by people who know how to get the job done.

2740975,2,B000MRA5EM,"For a giant screen (IMAX) production it is a very disappointing that the image quality on all underwater shots is well below the old worned out VHS tape! Severe geometric distortions and colour aberrations aroud peripheral parts of the screen cause eye strain. As the camera pans on all wide angle shots (most of the film) the distortions makes the viewers dizzy.
It seems clear that, despite high cost and recording format of this production, the underwater optics (flat port) compromised the end result to less than standard definition quality, which is not what viewers are expecting from an IMAX film.
Like other viewers, I find the story pretty dumb, aimed at 5-year olds. It's a shame because the underwater world offers some of the most amazing and captiviting stories that audiences would love to hear.",1378857600,,810,4.963235294117647

We went back and forth to choose only one, but they both had great reviews. Finally, we decided to order both, the single disk versions, and we couldn't be happier. The picture and 3D look awesome on either disk, and since they are very short, you can easily watch them back-to-back. We also did demo the disks on some occasions for our guests, and they all liked them so far.

Deep Sea is narrated by Johnny Depp and Kate Winslet, and as other reviewers have mentioned, they did a better job than Jim Carry's voice in Under the Sea. However, both my wife and I liked the colors of Under the Sea better. Under the Sea is more colorful and the ""Potato Cod"" scene is just amazing in 3D.

2741086,5,B000MRA5EM,"lHi Folks,
This is a great film for those of you who want to experience 3D for the Family. IMAX is the very best and the scenes are stunning. Ocean life is beautiful you feel like you a scuba diving and right there in the picture.

If this is your first 3D experience it will blow you out of your shoes. Quite frankly I own several 3D films with the latest being The Avenger's from last year. The Ocean based 3D films are a great learning tool for children. I suggest that parents watch these types of films with their children to explain some of the scenes to them. Anyway at least to this point I haven't found a 3D that I haven't enjoyed immensely.
Hope this helps.
Blessings,
Phil",1363046400,,684,4.2615384615384615

I'd like to be cute and quote some of the genuine stinker one-liners from this script but this movie doesn't deserve that much effort going into a review.

Bottom line: the footage is great, but no better than, say, ""Nature,"" or ""Nova"" or ""National Geographic"" or a BBC nature show.  What absolutely RUINS this film is the narration and Hollywood B-movie sound effects.  I am about 20 minutes in of passive watching but I'm not going to finish it.  And it's not like a BBC David Attenborough film is all that high brow.  Those films also have sound tracks full of emotional cues and also use pretty absurd sound effects (Hollywood alien movie noises when showing jelly fish, for example) but at least the narration isn't so dumb.  And David Attenborough's speaking voice makes everything sound at least a bit more intelligent.  But honestly, no one could deliver the lines from Imax Deep Sea in an intelligent way.  This is just a dumb movie.  Don't waste your time.",1360800000,,979,4.7

I was disappointed this movie didn't get into real deep sea creatures with the lumincent bodies and wicked teeth but it does have a good variety. Kate and Depp where a nicer combination to listen to than Jim Carrey but I felt the 3D footage was better for Under the Sea and would choose it over the two. If you are going to get one nature sea video I would recommend Under the Sea but both are good and give that relaxing atmosphere to wonder into in the life of fish.,1357084800,3,550,4.055045871559633
2741139,1,B000MRA5EM,"This could have been a lot better... after all, they did have an four oceans' worth of animals to work with. My kids were bored by it.

I didn't watch it in 3D, but the camera work was actually quite good. However, the fishes' movements seemed somehow scripted. Would sharks really just swim right in front of the camera, and then swim away right on cue? I'm no expert, but it seemed contrived.

There was absolutely no continuity; the movie jumped from one subject to the next in no order. Each scene was anticlimactic, never really ending but just jump-cutting without providing closure. Some dragged on for way too long and others were repetitive. For example, there are three different scenes in which *SPOILER ALERT* fish clean each other. Meanwhile, the narrators proudly display their vocabulary, using big, fancy words like 'Symbiosis' and 'Relationship,' sure to wow the kiddies.

What really killed it, though, was the narration. It was a really, really cheesy script. I agree with the others who said it was 'Preachy Propaganda.' Johnny Depp halfheartedly mumbled his lines, while Kate Winslet sounded perky but strained. The obligatory preachy, Greenpeace ending was the nail in the coffin. They gave some made-up figures about how many fish we've killed and seemed eager to be done. I know I was.

Unfortunately, the transparent collectivist, ""it takes a village"" theme made this a propaganda piece. Yes, things work together in an ecosystem and there is a balance. Ironically, the agenda is undermined by the script itself. The ""can't we all get along"" premise is negated by the miracle that sea turtles can find a ""living room"" sized area of the ocean to have their shells cleaned by other species.

However, I was really annoyed and tired quickly of the narrated script that droned on and on about global warning, species extinction, and other conservationist activism. It's a shame that demos of 3D DVDs must kowtow to this type of propaganda.

Update: Although IMAX documentaries present strikingly realistic demos of the 3D video format, their commentary drones on and on pushing the conservationist political agenda; it's way, way overdone. Therefore, especially after reading other reviews of IMAX 3D products I have not yet purchased, I will not buy any more of them.",1347408000,4,661,5.177570093457944

The film features a beautiful soundtrack and alternating narration from john depp and kate winslet. They are speaking to you and it works, there are actually one star reviews complaining the music is too loud, actually they are wrong ,this is mellow music and the words come through clearly. This like most imax products is only 40 minutes long but each minute is fascinating and poignant as we learn that 90% of large fish have been taken out of the sea by overfishing, mankind is very good at wiping out everything in his path though. we have known that for years. Still this is a wonderful 3d movie that inspires awe. It takes place in reef areas mostly and not the deep sea.

The picture was excellent in resolution and clarity with the exception of this weird effect I had from the 3d. maybe its because the strength of the 3d? I tried adjusting the 3d output strength to weaken it a bit but little help occured from this.

My only issue arises with the length of the movie, it's simply too short for the amount of money spend on it.  I do understand that it is a documentary and not a real movie, but just as you are starting to get more involved into the movie, the closing credits start to roll.

EXCESS PARALLAX in a few of the scenes make it hard to mentally assemble the 3D.

Far better than Wild Ocean in every respect

The little fish swimming right by your nose. i actually had to fight the urge to hold my breath. you really feel loike u are underwater!

I put headphones on and I lost myself in the beauty for an hour and the documentary part of it was nothing short of amazing as well.  You could see every spec of fish no matter how small, at times it looked like you are in the middle of it all and the coral looked like you could reach out and touch it.

Aside from the price the movie is GREAT! I was lucky enough to get this movie free with my sony 3d tv and it is definitely great to show off to friends! As I said... its about 40 minutes long and includes some of the most beautiful under sea shots you'll ever see.  As far as the 3D effects go, it won't disappoint you! The 3D gives you the depth effect as it should in an ocean setting.  It really looks as though you can walk straight through your tv and swim with the sharks (don't try that at home).  Johnny Depp and Kate Winslet do a great job narrating while Danny Elfman gives us some fun music to listen to!

Overall i give it 4 stars with the price not being an involvement.  It missed the 5 star mark because there were several scenes with heavy ""ghosting"" particularly when a squid locks on to the camera thinking its dinner! The squid gets very close up and becomes very blurry when you have your 3d glasses on! it was enough to make me go cross eyed and have to look away from the screen.

Adults who are real ocean fanatics may find this movie to be a little wanting due to the short duration. But I purchased this for my three year old daughter who loved a copy that I had rented last summer. In general I think that shorter movies are better for kids because their attention spans are shorter.

One of my friends commented that he thought the term ""deep"" was a bit of false advertising because while the film is definitely shot in deep water they don't explore the really dark and mysterious places at the very bottom of the ocean.

From an adult perspective, I am amazed at how many different species they show (beautiful footage), and it is very informative...great for family time, educating children/students, etc.  I gave it five stars because we wanted a DVD that discusses sea creatures, and that is exactly what you get.

HOWEVER, the narration was awful!  We own and rent dozens of DVDs from Discovery, Animal Planet, and National Geographic, and this was the worst narration I have ever heard.  I was surprised, but I guess Johnny Depp & Kate Winslet haven't had much experience with narration...although, I think the script was a big part of the problem (some lines are soooo cheesy).

All of this said, when we saw the movie on DVD, we were all pretty disappointed.  I still thought the movie was beautiful, the music was perfect and the narration was good.

2741395,5,B000MRA5EM,"""Deep Sea"" is a wonderful look at the one world that Man has no domain. As intelligent and resourceful as we are, we still cannot plumb the depths with the ease that the Ocean's creatures can. Instead, we plunder and pollute this wonderous world that we cannot conquer.

This film regretfully, may stand, like others that display the world's beautiful places, as the only record of what it was like before we destroyed it. There are many reviews that are critical of the the narration, or the Director. This film is not about them. ""Deep Sea"" gives us a look at some of the Ocean's most unique creatures, and how they, more than we, have areas where predator and prey call a truce, and do things for one another for the betterment of both species! It also brings to the screen creatures that many may not have seen before (the Sunfish comes to mind, because I, myself had never seen one).
""Deep Sea"" is a feast for the eyes, as there is no trace of our intrusion (yet).

However, the production of this film is really a problem.  A lot of the earlier clips suffer from a blue/red syndrome (poor color balance), perhaps in part due to the 3D production (did it use color glasses?).  The narration is limited in effect if not outright silly in places, and although I admire both Kate Winslet and Johnny Depp on their own, they really didn't fit the material here.  It had a lot of the old True Life Adventure (Disney) feel, I must admit.  The alternation between their voices made no sense at all.  Definitely not a dialog, so why do it?  The music track greatly interfered with the video production, and was very distracting and annoying at times.  I am donating my copy to the local library; maybe somebody else can enjoy it for what it is.

I still thought the photography was amazing and the colors just spectacular. I've never seen underwater footage this good. This also is the first time I've actually heard the sounds that some of these marine creatures make. I just presumed, like many others, there was mostly silence underneath the surface. That's not so; there are some amazing sounds.

More so, there are some amazing creatures that most of us have never heard about or seen. Some of them are downright weird-looking, repulsive yet fascinating. They are so strange you think you're looking at some animated film with cartoon characters.....but these creatures are real. Some of them are frightening and brutal killers.

I've read complaints about the narration by Johnny Depp and Kate Winslet, and have to agree on a couple points. Winslet does make an attempt to put some reflection in her voice but Depp sounds like he's sleepwalking through this. His voice is flat, a monotone, and it sounds like he's reading the material for the first time. Neither of these two add much life to his documentary.

Others complain that it's just under 40 minutes and thus, the DVD overpriced. Well,  I found it very interesting and stunning to view. I wouldn't mind adding it to my collection because this is something I would watch multiple times.",1189036800,12,1412,4.895397489539749
2741401,4,B000MRA5EM,"This movie was fairly entertaining, but better at the IMAX.  My mother is a huge Jonny Depp fan and wanted to see this, but because of a disease she has she could not go to the IMAX.  This was a great alternative for her.",1188864000,,221,4.0
2741402,5,B000MRA5EM,"I decided to purchase this film on DVD since I caught it on sale.  The video is very good when up-converted to 1080i.

As all of my gear is HD, I've never watched it below 1080i and cannot speak to that, but I suspect many of the low ratings are due to watching this title on standard or enhanced def machines (nothing really looks good on those anyway).

In short this title has beautiful visuals, the commentary is much like the commentary on almost all titles in this genre, but the audio is fantastic, it's only Dolby Digital 5.1 (not Dolby TrueHD or Lossless PCM) but it is astounding!

I truly did not expect that good of audio from standard Dolby 5.1, it was refreshing...

The main attraction runs 41 minutes, perfect for those times when you don't have a 2 hour window to watch a movie.  Also included is a Theatrical Trailer.

I would recommend to anyone who likes this genre.",1187481600,2,886,4.432098765432099
2741403,2,B000MRA5EM,"This is pretty enjoyable when watching it in IMAX.  However when viewing it at home, it's really a less than average underwater documentary.  Right from the beginning line when Depp says ""These are not visitors from an alien planet..."", you can pretty much tell this is aimed at a very young audience.  It tries to be 'cute' a little too often, and really doesn't present information in much detail.  Not sure what to expect though when you're covering all aspects of the ocean in 41 minutes.

It has nice cinematography and realistic colors, but nothing groundbreaking.  I've seen better documentaries on discovery.  This is only worth watching at IMAX.",1187222400,,654,4.944954128440367
2741424,5,B000MRA5EM,"I loved it, the water is crystal clear, the different creatures and life that were addressed were fascinating, and educational. The narration was very well timed. The notes of humor were appreciated.
It is a great IMAX film, as always wish it were longer!!!",1186099200,,257,4.863636363636363
2741425,2,B000MRA5EM,"Absolutely cringeworthy commentary from Mr. Depp and (especially) Ms. Winslett. People who write this sort of thing ought to be taken out and shot for their own good. Poor music score too. The pikkies are nice, but not a patch on the BBC's magnificent ""Blue Planet"". The environmental message at the end, while welcome, seems tacked on almost as an afterthought.",1182556800,,362,4.950819672131147
2741426,5,B000MRA5EM,"While nothing compares to seeing this on the IMAX screen, this DVD is the next best thing. It will simply blow you away! The undersea colors and sounds are amazing. I didn't think of the creatures under the ocean as making sounds like animals on land do, but they do! I learned so much about undersea life, all in a context that was not just educational, but often amusing. Danny Elfman's sound track makes it all the more enjoyable - the man is a genius. The naration by Kate Winslet and Johnny Depp is perfectly adapted to what you're being shown. Fantastic for ALL ages!!!",1181692800,,575,4.485714285714286

For an educational video, it is interesting, entertaining and engaging, even for a class of 30 9th or 10th graders- and that's a pretty amazing thing!  It really shows diversity in the ocean and how animals work together.  There is some corny dialogue, but as a science person, I can appreciate that!

The photography is some of the most stunning marine footage I have ever seen.  The filmmakers have done a superb job of capturing some of the most charismatic, sinister, and whimsical creatures that inhabit the oceans, and the information about their life cycles, while not exhaustive, was well edited to maintain interest.  Highly recommended!",1181001600,39,495,5.1625

2741432,2,B000MRA5EM,"This film was released to Imax theaters in 3D. It was probably very entertaining and exhilarating in 3D. But, I'm sorry to say, it's very ordinary in 2D. There is nothing more annoying than watching a 3D movie in 2D. All the carefully staged 3D shots, pardon the pun, stick out like a sore thumb.

And the narration, while performed by the two outstanding actors Johnny Depp and Kate Winslet, is completely one dimensional. Or should I say 1D? Not only is it dull, it's annoying. It sounds like they both read the narration for the entire film and the director, Howard Hall, had buttons for both of their recordings and randomly switched them on and off with no rhyme or reason. There were times, and I'm not exaggerating, when Depp would start a sentence and Winslet would finish it!

And as for the title, ""Deep Sea""? Not once did the film journey deeper than the coral reefs.

There are a lot of excellent documentaries about the ocean to add to your library. This is not one of them.",1179532800,2,987,4.5027932960893855

I wish i would have not been tricked into it, though i should have noticed the signs... its just it shouldnt come up if you search for 3d movies................... thats all i have to say... other than that its a good movie, im just mad they sold it as 3d as it says in the plot!!!",1179446400,11,576,4.106194690265487

8171179,5,B000MRA5EM,"This movie was shot in 70mm IMAX film and is just about the best image quality you could ever get from a camera. The colors and details pop and you really appreciate the hard work that went into capturing these images. I did not watch the dvd or 3D version and I recommend that you not do so either. 3D is not only an insult to film but ruins the aesthetic quality of the 70mm stock. And dvd simply doesn't have the pixels to show 70mm in all its glory.

I would say the biggest flaw is that it's too damn short and leaves you wanting more. I have never seen more breathtaking images of the sea and I need more!!!! The use of 70mm alone makes this a five star product though. I highly recommend it.",1495065600,,698,4.094890510948905
