2771710,5,B000FP5XZM,"STORY: This western adventure is based on the true story of the 1869 scientific expedition of explorer U.S. Major John Wesley Powell (John Beal) travel a thousand miles to map the Colorado River in three boats, including through the treacherous rapids of the Grand Canyon. Civil war veterans of both sides are on the trip, and some old wounds are hard to heal. A nice element of the story is the smaller story of the dog who rescues the major. A group of 10 was formed for the expedition, including Bill Dunn (Brian Keith). The film shows some of the adventure, comradeship and conflict these men faced. Brian Keith is the standout here as the astronomer and is full of personality.

TRIVIA & BEHIND THE SCENES: Directed by William Beaudine. The film was released to theaters on October 18, 1960. The studio was always ahead in cross-promoting their products, and released a behind the scenes feature on the making of the movie to the weekly Disney anthology show that aired October 16, 1960. It was titled ""Rapids Ahead"" and was paired with the True-Life story ""Bear Country"". A big focus of the feature was the new methods of photography used to get the realistic adventure shots in the film. Shot in Technicolor. Original running time was 92 minutes. The movie was edited down and aired on April 4, 1968, and again on August 4 of the same year. First release to VHS in 1986 at the full running time. John Beal who plays the Major, had been a voice actor for the animated segment of Disney's ""So Dear to My Heart"", many years earlier. The screenplay was by Lawrence Watkin, based on the original journal by the Major. Watkin co-wrote 3 songs for the film with Stan Jones. There is a plaque at the Grand Canyon honoring the real Major Powell, and it is shown at the end of the film. In addition to work on the soundstage at the studio, the production filmed at multiple location sites in the Grand Canyon and at Moab, Utah, as well as and at the studio. Moab locations include Arches Park, Dead Horse Point Park, Ida Gulch Rapids, and Whites Ranch, so prepare for some awesome scenery.

2771727,2,B000FP5XZM,"I've watched some bad movies in my time, and when the highlight of your entire 92 minute production is a 5 minute fistfight between two characters you don't really care about, that takes the movie from bad to awful.  Almost all the characters are cardboard cutouts with pretty much no development, except maybe the mountain man character Bill Dunn. The only thing this movie has going for it is the beautiful scenery, which was shot for the film by Otis Marston. I just don't understand how they could make a movie about explored the Colorado River/Grand Canyon so *boring.*",1443744000,,574,4.797979797979798
2771728,1,B000FP5XZM,"it's a Disney and therein lies the problem. This is a great topic, but given who made it, I am not sure I can trust that this is not just fiction. Disney has a track record making fauxcumentaries, e.g. Hidalgo, and now I am very sceptical.",1439510400,,239,4.217391304347826

2771743,3,B000FP5XZM,"Worth a watch if you're a fan of the Grand Canyon and river rafting.  Shooting the rapids in wooden boats was incredibly difficult and dangerous, and it's a miracle that 3 of the 4 boats made it through.  While the long distance shots of the boats were the real thing, most of the in-boat action sequences were shot in a studio with early green-screen canyon backgrounds which look pretty phony today.  I guess the big Panavision cameras used back then were just too unwieldy to put in those boats, or they didn't want to risk getting them wet. Disappointingly, much of the film was shot at Canyonlands National Park, well north of the  the Grand Canyon, and even at ""Wall Street"" in Arches National Park, and only one mention was made of the passage through Glen Canyon- Powell's favorite stretch of the river and still undammed when they made this movie.  Glen Canyon was gentle, slow water, and they could have added some beautiful scenery through there.  What a pity.  Now ""Lake Powell"" is just a big sewage lagoon which actually dishonors the name of John Wesley Powell, who would have hated seeing this canyon ruined by a short-sighted and totally un-American dam.  P.S.- don't miss the cutest Disney dog ever!!!!",1417392000,2,1219,4.7440758293838865

2771762,4,B000FP5XZM,"This movie filled an old itch for me.  I saw it as a child and I am a bit of a history student.  It is quite incredible what Major Powell managed to do.  There is no fairy tale ending in the real life expedition, and much controversy exists to this day.  No matter what, it was something quite amazing to do in 1869.  Now the movie is not accurate in many things, but I treasure it anyway.",1389744000,,389,4.0
2771763,3,B000FP5XZM,"This is allegedly based on Powell's journal.  OK, the journal says these 10 guys started out at Green River, and these 6 guys came out the bottom of the Grand Canyon.  The movie says the same.  Other historical accuracy is skimpy.  Dock Marston, technical advisor (and a friend of mine) turns over in his grave.  Most viewers won't really care about that.  Is it a good story, well rendered?  Yes, to a degree.  Most of the actors are solid veterans who do a creditable job.  Much of the camera work is well executed.  There are some good sequences running rapids.  Alas, the real story is lost in Hollywood triviality.  Human conflict is invented for the suspense.  The fact that this was adventure exceeding the first ascent of Everest, or Columbus' discovery of the new world is lost.  Those adventures had some hope for survival by retreating.  Powell's crew did not have that option once the Grand Canyon itself was entered.  They knew they couldn't retreat, nor go downriver without boats. Their only possible escape was climbing out.  I have done this several times with the benefit of good maps.  It is an adventure.
As light entertainment with no interest in history or adventure, it's pretty good.  I had hoped for more.  I got less.",1386979200,3,1243,4.719626168224299

2771765,2,B000FP5XZM,"for an adventure movie, this one is a real cream puff. the movie title promises great adventure and some history but ends up being a ""looking for benji"". boats running the rapids are not bad but cannot save this movie from sinking.",1375315200,,231,4.523809523809524
2771766,3,B000FP5XZM,"TEN WHO DARED was made as a two-part episode of WALT DISNEY'S WONDERFUL WORLD OF COLOR TV show and expanded as a theatrical feature when Walt was impressed with the spectacular location photography of the Grand Canyon.

The modest production may not have played well on the big theater screen but the movie is on a par with Disney's high TV standard. It's an absorbing, character-driven Western drama with a good cast led by the great Brian Keith in a barn-storming performance.

This long-awaited reissue is somewhat disappointing in that the source is clearly a worn and faded print -- perhaps from a 16mm edition made for school showings -- which especially suffers from the loss of the original's rich Technicolor photography.

The neglect of care for this film may stem from its latter-day critical depreciation as well as its limited commercial life. It is unfortunate that this DVD release is the best quality we are likely to see. What matters most is that we at last have access to a rare feature film from the Silver Age of the Walt Disney era, which has not been publicly shown for four decades.

It's time to forget Leonard Maltin's unreasonable ""bombing"" of this film in his THE DISNEY FILMS and MOVIE GUIDE and enjoy (or not enjoy) the opportunity to see the film for ourselves without undue negative influence.

2771770,2,B000FP5XZM,This film I wanted to see when Disney first came out with it many years ago. It chronicles the expedition of Maj. Powell down through the Grand Canyon on the river. I bought this DVD and was disappointed. It had a cheap feel to it. I believe it was cheaply done and the script writing was done as though the writers wanted to hurry up and go on vacation. So much more could have been told in this historical film and they neglected to do that. It had the feel of a cheaply done 30 minute TV program rather than a full length movie.,1275350400,4,531,4.115384615384615
2771771,5,B000FP5XZM,"This is another great selection from the Wonderful World of Disney TV series of yesteryear and not to be missed for all Disney fans. Though the DVD treatment of this title could have been given greater consideration from Disney, I am still happy to include it in my classic Disney collection.

Like the other studios, they just don't get it... people WANT to see these films again and will buy them - in some cases regardless of re-production results. Why they prefer to have them sitting in vaults gathering decay and dust is beyond me - especially when it is obvious there IS a market for them. Can someone please get Disney to open their eyes - they have nothing to lose and everything to gain. Leonard Maltin of all people should be a better crusader in this!

Considering the age of ""Ten Who Dared"" and like titles of that era one must appreciate the cost and time associated with digital transfer when viewing a lot of these shows but I still believe it is money worth spent for the memories and simplicity of television - again of those days. Disney had a knack for combining true-life events - especially during or after the civil war period - into a dramatic show and I believe the story excelled when a narrator also became part of the movie - whether one of the characters or another.

This is a delightful family film with stunning visuals and a great cast - many of who appeared in various other Disney shows. My advice is to grab this title whilst you can because it will be gone or become like many other Disney live-action shows - too expensive to purchase online or not re-released for many years.

I think it's time someone NEW & with passion, took over Disney's marketing division who really wants to share the 'old Disney' as it was with the world again.
I'm pretty sure the prosperity of doing so would prove a case in point! Lets all get together and make them restore and distribute these famous titles - and there are literally thousands we are all yearning for.",1268438400,21,1986,4.508333333333334
