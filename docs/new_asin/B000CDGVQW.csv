2459072,5,B000CDGVQW,"DEUCE BIGALOW
MALE GIGOLO

I am a big Rob Schneider fan and have been since his SNL days, from his movies like Surf Ninjas to his latest work. With all the films he has done he is most known for his Happy Madison films, the company owned by his friend Adam Sandler. The most well known is most likely this one here, Deuce Bigalow Male Gigolo. In fact this was the first film produced by Happy Madison and I think it was also Schneiders most successful with HM.

Deuce Bigolow is the typical loser who has gone nowhere in life. He has been fired from his job and the woman he wants to date turns him down every time he comes in her store. But things may be changing for Deuce after he meets a gigolo named Antoine. Deuce is a fish guy and knows all about the aquatic, so one day Antoines big fish turns up sick and he turns to Deuce. Deuce knows what is wrong but has to stay with it to make sure it makes it. In doing so he has free range of Antoines great apartment while he is gone. While there he takes a few calls and begins doing what Antoine does, kinda.

So the adventure begins as Deuce meets all kinds of different women and the funniest man pimp ever. The only thing is that he is doing all this to fix the very expensive fish tank he broke at Antoines before he returns. Oh did I mention he may have found love along the way, and what about that cop that keeps following him? All in a days work for a gigolo.

This is an excellent film and very funny even though it may be labeled as a sex comedy. To me it is more of a romantic comedy plus all of the gags with the women are hilarious. I also loved the way the film had Deuce find ways to entertain these women without, you know. Rob is excellent here and plays the role it seems he was born to play. He also co wrote the film with Harris Goldberg who also wrote Happy Madison films The Master of Disguise and the sequel to this film. He also wrote the great Without a Paddle and wrote and directed the wonderful Numb.

The film was directed by Mitch Mitchell who also made Surviving Christmas, Sky High, Shrek Forever After and the third Chipmunks movie. I thought he did a wonderful job with this film as well as those others I listed. This may be his best film even still but I need to watch all of those again. Now everyone was excellent in this film especially all of the ladies. Also Eddie Griffin and William Forsythe were excellent here as well, maybe the best these two have done, at least in comedy.

If you haven't seen this film I highly recommend it as it is one of the best Happy Madison has ever put out. This film was very funny and had a lot of heart behind it regardless of some of the cruder jokes. With this DVD you get behind the scenes stuff and deleted scenes. I still wish we would have gotten a commentary at least with Rob.",1411603200,,2811,4.12043795620438

Rated R.

I thought this movie was going to be a totally nasty comedy but I was quite pleasantly surprised.
Although off color and raunchy, it does feature some clever, good natured humor along with the low brow shenanigans and it has few fun insights into the strange insanity of male/female relationships.
At many times tacky and crude, don't be fooled because underneath you might just find a warm
heart beating away between the chuckles. It's actually part chick flick, too.
This film is definitely not politically correct, but there are some unexpected values hinted at here, even though everything is played for laughs.
It might be best for the easily offended to steer clear of this one, which is geared to the open minded.
No blatant nudity to speak of unless I somehow missed it.
Oddly enough, according to reviews I've read, some women found this movie not only funny but somewhat endearing.",1357430400,,985,4.951515151515151

Rob Schneider does a fine job playing this amiable loser. Several scenes are just laugh-out-loud funny. The female interest, Arija Bareikis, is not someone I was familiar with but I liked her wholesome looks. William Forsythe plays the villain and, of course, he's over-the-top.

As a result, he gets himself into all sorts of trouble.  Things become a bit more complicated when he falls in love with one of his customers...
Rob Schneider, Oded Fehr, and the rest of the cast, have outdone themselves with their performances, which are exceptional to say the least.  All the actors, without exceptions, give it their 100% and it really shows! Very well written and very well presented, the movie is without a doubt guaranteed to provide more than just a few laughs.
The setting, the plot, the dialogues, the humor, and the music are all wonderful!

DEUCE BIGALOW:MALE GIGOLO is a prime example. Along with his other leading roles like THE HOT CHICK and THE ANIMAL all three films are unwatchable and excrutiatingly embarrassing to watch. Why they give the greenlight and the money to finance garbage like this is beyond the comprehension of this reviewer. This low (very low) concept travels into ""sit-com"" territory as Schneider in the title role mistakenly takes on the identity of a high class gigolo and the situations are not very funny and unwatchable.  However, there is a one funny line where one of his ""clients"" is an obese woman.  Schneider/Bigalow is not too thrilled and says to the woman ""I think there's been a mistake!"".  The woman responds, ""Did you say 'STEAK'?"". That one  situation alone is worth a few laughs, but the rest of the movie is completely disposable.",1112054400,,990,4.8

  This man can clean aquariums for aliving and is a fish doctor too.  His neighbor, Antoine Laconte (Oded Fehr) is very well endowed and over-experienced with women.  He is a gigolo.  Antoine must go to Sweden for business, so he asks Deuce to take care of his expensive place for a week.  By the way, if anything happens to his place or his expensive, exotic fish, he will kill Deuce with his Bow Gun.  Well enough of that big talk.  So Deuce gets to live the good life for a week.  However, like ""Ziggy"", anything that could happen...does.  One awful thing happens after another.  Deuce has alot of cleaning up to do and damage to pay for before Antoine makes it back home.  So Deuce decides to try and be a gigolo himself to earn the extra money he needs overnight.
  His first client is a surprise!  She is a well-known actress who used to work with Ted Bessel.
  Amy Poehler (Saturday Night Live 2001-Present) also plays a date who has Tourette's Syndrome and yells every dirty word in the book.
  Norm Macdonald (Saturday Night Live 1993-98) plays a bartender.

2459116,5,B000CDGVQW,"Okay, I'll start off by saying that I am not an ""across the board"" Rob Schneider/Adam Sandler project fan. I didn't care for The Hot Chick or The Animal and Big Daddy got on my nerves. So, I'm not praising Deuce Bigalow blindly.
The jokes are a bit juvenile through this, sure. That's to be expected with a Rob Schneider flick. If you want a wonderful script and Oscar-winning production, this isn't the movie for you (it cracks me up that people complain about the production and script on a movie like this, which revels in the fact that its sole purpose in life is to snatch as much cheap laughter as possible).
Some jokes are even a bit overused and cliched (see Amy Poehler as Ruth, the girl with Tourette's Syndrome), but they make me laugh. The part when Deuce and Ruth are in the convertible and she starts uncontrollably shouting obscenities at the couple in the car next to them shouldn't be funny at all, but I still laugh.
The scene where he's talking to the valet in the mens' room (who turns out to be his dad) while someone experiences a rather noisy, disgusting poop in the stall behind them shouldn't be funny at all, but I still laugh.
The disturbing incidents in which TJ picks up and eats a tomato and a scoop of ice cream from the water in the hot tub that he and Deuce soaking in shouldn't be funny at all, but I still laugh (although it's laced with a slight cringe in these cases).
And, of course, the ambiguously gay fish tank builder (Neil, I think is his name) makes all sorts of comments that lead to chuckling: ""I know, I'm up to my bicep in it!"" or ""Look, I don't wanna flip you over and do you dry here...""
Not exactly comedic genius displayed in this movie, but clever and plentiful enough to ensure laughter.

2459117,5,B000CDGVQW,"I am reading the reviews for this movie and there seems to be a lot of the negative type. Why is that? This is a very funny movie and Rob Schneider fits the role perfectly in my opinion. I guess I can see what other reviewers are saying about how this is a dumb movie, but for me it is a guilty pleasure that never fails to crack me up the whole way through, and I have seen it on many occasions. The story begins with Deuce cleaning a public aquarium(naked all the while). He loves what he does but ends up getting fired. He finds work for Antoine(hope I spelled it right) who turns out to be a gigolo. When he travels to Switzerland, Deuce is tabbed with watching his house while he is away. All goes well until Deuce accidentally knocks over a $6000 aquarium, and soon resorts to being a [male prostitute] to make the money to replace the tank before Antoine returns. What results is a hilarious number of ""dates"" that involve women with abnormalities, until he finally meets one girl he falls in love with. So I won't give away any more plot, but how does it all turn out? Just watch the movie to find out. If you haven't seen it yet, just try not to take it too seriously and let yourself be entertained. As far as the dvd goes, there are hardly any extras. Video and sound quality are great though, so I suggest you give it a chance.

Eddie Griffin is the only funny character in Deuce Bigalow playing Deuce's pimp. Deuce is a fish tank cleaner who accidentally breaks a $6,000 dollar tank while fish sitting a gigolo's house. Needless to say Deuce takes to Man-Hoen' like a fish to water (sorry...). The movie centers around his motley crew of dates like the narcoleptic, the giant and the rather rotund African-American woman. The story is weak and so are the jokes. Rob Schneider is best in cameo role's like the Waterboy ""You can DO IT"" or in Big Daddy as the delivery man.

2459121,3,B000CDGVQW,"Although I didn't think `Deuce Bigalow: Male Gigolo' was underrated at all, it looks like (by the mere 40 reviews) that it has gone somewhat unnoticed.  And although I believe this to be just slightly better than your average comedy, it is still worth seeing.  Rob Schneider drops in a performance that really stands out among his fellow/former SNL buddies.  And that's probably because besides Eddie Griffin, he's the only known actor.  You all saw the previews for this movie before it came out, and probably laughed at those.  But this is not one of THOSE type of movies.  If you enjoy slapstick, dumb comedy there's great chance you'll ""get pleasure"" from this movie.  And even though it's rated R, it seemed to be the choice movie for 16-year olds to sneak into to.  It really seems to be aimed at the younger crowd; I guess ""whoring"" and male prostitutes are touchy subjects with rating choosers.  Hah.
Anyways, the storyline for `Deuce Bigalow: Male Gigolo"" is pretty simplistic at first glance.  But once you get into it, it becomes more complicated.  Schneider plays the title character and is first seen as a greasy, unkempt fishtank cleaner.  He leads a sad, almost pathetic life that leaves him with only his fish as friends.  But when he is asked to watch after a rich (male) prostitutes house and sick fish, he becomes more popular.  Though not really.  After he later destroys the man's fishtank by trying some ridiculous exercise, he is forced to earn the money to replace it (which is a large amount, obviously).  Hence, he takes up prostitution; or man-whoring as T.J. (Griffin) likes to call it.  That's when the comedy begins.  Deuce is forced to visit the homes of numerous handicapped woman who want something from him.  Among the women's handicaps there's narcolepsy, tourette's syndrome, and obesity (you probably saw that one coming).  The woman are all very unique and in turn Deuce must do some ""unique"" things to please them.  And the point of the story is to see if Deuce can (consequentially) help himself; which if you saw the previews, it looked doubtful.  But that's neither here nor there.  I don't like to spoil movies for people and I don't like to say too much; so I'll stop here.  But I will say that the movie is rather clean.  The R rating is misleading; as there are no f-words, no nudity (minus Schneider's butt; which is comical, not sick), and no real vulgarity.  If anything it's somewhat provocative (at times).
Even though this is not one of my favorite movies of all-time, it is still enjoyable and was certainly worth my time.  I highly recommend this movie to anyone in the 12-25 age range who likes comedies.  There are a few parts that might be unacceptable for youngsters and a few that might go over the heads of many 30-year olds.  But overall it's pretty fresh and likable as a whole.  Again, if you enjoy slapstick comedy with a decent (background) storyline you will like 'Deuce Bigalow: Male Gigolo' and laugh at its endless bits of comedy.  But if you don't appreciate slapstick humor and find the prostitution industry to be sick and wrong, you will completely miss its purpose.  Basically: if you lack a sense of humor, don`t watch it.",1050969600,,3197,4.714801444043322

Rob Schnider and Eddie Griffin are certainly funny, but their supporting cast raises the bar.  Their straight men, Detective Fowler and Antoine are SO good.

Deuce Bigalow, The Animal, and now The Hot Chick are all hilarious movies, relying on witty writing and quick comedic timing to pull it off. Rob Schneider just doesn't *look* like a leading character is the problem, he actually looks like a regular guy, unlike Adam Sandler or David Spade--okay maybe they aren't exactly super-man-models, but ya get my drift? Schneider plays Deuce Bigalow, a man stuck in a rut to pay for the damages done to his friend's ruined apartment, and he is given a short time limit. So of course he turns to man-whoring, the obvious choice; however, he-whoring is not all cracked up to be, with clients ranging from an over-weight black woman with a pair of huge kazoongas, a narcoleptic, a woman with tourettes syndrome, a giant Norwegian, and a woman with a fake leg. Of all these women, he finds one who he falls in love with, and is coincidentally the only woman he does his Male Gigolo duties with--you know what I'm talking bout.
It's not just a simple love comedy flick, it's quite witty in dialogue surprisingly. The characters are well portrayed, especially the Tourette Syndrome chick.

Antoine has to go out of town for awhile, but since his fish is sick, he gives Deuce the job of taking care of his fish (and his apartment) while he is away. Problems arise when Deuce accidentally destroys the interior of the apartment and is more than just strapped for cash. So naturally, he takes on the job of a gigolo. After his first gig, he is impressed with the ten dollar fee he is paid and uses ""man-whoring"" (as it is referred to in the movie) as a means to save up the money to repair Antoine's apartment. Along the way he meets a man-pimp (Eddie Griffin) who takes him under his wing, a detective hot on Antione's tail with a ""thin"" problem and a whole lot of messed up women/customers. I've always been a big fan of Rob Schneider. I always thought he was underplayed on SNL and I loved Men Behaving Badly (too bad it got cancelled). He has always had sort of a good natured sense of humor and he is fun to watch. Deuce Bigalow: Male Gigolo stands as his best work to date. I have gotten multiple viewings out of it and I still laugh as hard at some parts as I did when I first saw it (The Tourette's syndrome girl yelling at the family in the car stands out in my mind the most).

It has much more to say about romantic insecurities and the kind of men that women are looking for than it does about male prostitution.

The humor in ""Deuce"" is silly and often crude, but considering the film's subject matter, it's all remarkably good-natured. There are some effective sight gags and equally amusing wordplay.

Rob Schneider, yet another Saturday Night Live graduate, plays Deuce Bigelow, a not very bright guy who cleans pools for a living. The high point of his life seems to be seeing if the babe at the local fish store will get her T-shirt wet when she scoops fish out for him from a large aquarium. One day he gets a decent gig in Malibu where he meets Antoine [Oded Fahr], a gigolo who makes his living off women. Deuce is impressed. When Antoine leaves him in charge of his apartment for a few weeks, Deuce is fine until he breaks a $6,000 aquarium. Deuce must make money in a hurry to fix the damage, and soon Antoine's pimp has the hapless, middle-aged pool man working for him. His customers include an eight foot tall woman, an enormously fat black woman [played by a man], a girl with Tourette's syndrome, and one with part of her anatomy missing.
Deuce's capers are supposed to make you laugh, but the movie wears thin because its basically the same joke over and over. There are plenty of gross out jokes and much bathroom humor. The story throws political correctness to the four winds, which will bring hearty laughs to some but turn others off. The picture is fairly obvious and heavy-handed. In fact, when it's not trying to gross you out, it becomes strangely sappy and sentimental. There's none of the off the cuff lightness of There's Something About Mary here.
Deuce is not a character I can relate to. In fact, I can't relate to Rob Schneider either. He has none of the sweetness of Adam Sandler and none of the borderline psychotic charm of Jim Carrey. I find him merely competent, and in the world of movie comedy, that isn't enough.",1016409600,,2099,4.454545454545454

Deuce is also bugged by a cop who can't stop unzipping his pants. My favorite scene in the movie is where Deuce is playing ""Food Trivia"" with the fat lady.

And the cop. He was funny too. """" Were talking spaghetti string"". You see that spot there. HAHA. Just thinking about that movie makes me chuckle. He also made the movie seem real funny.
Rob Schneider is real stupid in a funny way. The concept really didn't make a whole lot of sense. But it was surely funny.
Eddie Griffin was hilarious. (...)
Another guy that did an awesome job on there part was Oded Fehr (Antwon). He had the funniest parts. Even though he didn't really have many parts, when he did appear on the movie it was hilarious. His accent made everything seem funny. You got to watch it for yourself to see what I mean.
Overall, this movie left me with a sore stomach and a sore throat all from laughing. I think that if your really looking for a movie that will make you laugh for a long time this one is it.

2459136,4,B000CDGVQW,"Movie Summary: Deuce Bigalow male fish tank cleaner is pretty much of a loser. He's not mean or anything, just a big dorky loser. Women pay him no attention, not even the old ladies that slip on the bus stairs. Deuce ends up getting into a little trouble and needs a lot of money fast. He ends up working for a quirky man pimp. He is also dogged by a psycho cop who keeps unzipping his pants. Will Deuce's life keep getting worse, or will he be able to turn things around and make some friends? It's not that hard to guess.
My Opinion: Again, this is another movie where the viewer has to be able to differentiate Oscar contenders from silly light hearted escapist entertainment. In this case, Deuce is a silly sometimes offensive light hearted movie. It was made that way. It's intentionally stupid. The bathroom humor is meant to be offensive. As such, I felt the movie really worked. I thought it was really funny and enjoyed the stupidity and silliness. There is actually a plot, and a good message to the movie. Yes I said a message! The wide range of women that Deuce takes out is very funny. How he deals with each one is very cute. The psycho cop that has skin problems is both gross and funny. ""Hey Bigalow, take a look at this will ya?""
DVD Quality: Widescreen anamorphic, DD 5.1 decent sound and picture quality. The few extras include trailer, making of, and story board comparison.
What You Should Do: See it if you liked any of the movies below. Buy it if you loved them. Skip it if you can't handle silly comedy.

Deuce is in trouble almost from the start of the movie.  He breaks a very valuable fish tank in a home where he is house sitting and has no money to replace it.  His only choice is to work as a male prostitute to pay for it.  His clients turn out to be social misfits, and Deuce, showing amazing empathy, helps them all.  His adventures with these clients make up the core of the movie.
For the reviewer who called this movie ""crap"" and said that only idiots who have never read a book could enjoy it, I have to say a few words.  I am anything but an idiot.  I have read and understood books in both literature and philosophy (among other fields) and have taught graduate level courses in both.

To earn enough money to undo the damage he has caused, our boy, Deuce, becomes a male prostitute, albeit, one who manages to never ""sleep"" with his clients.  The movie is good old fashioned simplistic slapstick built around Deuce's adventures in his new-found profession.
The plot would probably rate zero stars, but the slapstick humor rates a whole bunch.  I saw this with my brother on a ""just us guys"" afternoon out.  We must have been in the right mood, because we couldn't stop laughing, even though we both knew this was not exactly an Academy Award winner just waiting to be discovered.
As I've said in other reviews, my criterion for rating a movie is not intellectual but emotional.  I got hooked into this one.  Not only did I laugh, but I actually cared about how poor old Deuce made out.

2459157,3,B000CDGVQW,"There are some supremely funny visual moments in DUCE BIGALOW that make it  an entertaining DVD well worth your money if you want some up-to-date  laughs.  The plot is nonexistent, but that's not a problem.  What hurts the  movie, and keeps it from being the great comedy that some Amazon reviewers  prior to me are definitely overrating, is that the humor keeps getting  silly.  The director doesn't know when to stop, so he keeps scenes running  until they end in silly and not-so-funny humor.  There's a lack of  restraint here.  It might be worth comparing to BLAZING SADDLES, where the  humor also tends to overstay its welcome, except in that one Mel Brooks  followed up the humor with extreme outrageousness.  There's a big  difference between that kind of outrageous humor and the kind of silly  stuff in DEUCE BIGALOW.  (Not that Mel Brooks doesn't get silly too; his  SPACEBALLS is marred by exactly the same kind of verging-into-silliness as  DEUCE BIGALOW.)  When you see Deuce and his pimp in a jaccuzzi, and the  pimp is eating a sandwich and drops portions of it into the water and then  snuffles it up into his mouth, is that really funny?  The director thought  so, and maybe we should give him the benefit of the doubt--the first time!  But we see the scene again, only this time it's an ice cream cone, and the  vanilla ice cream keeps dropping into the water, and being fished out and  gobbled up. The director apparently believes that if something is humorous  the first time, it gets even funnier when you see it again and again.  And  this, in my humble opinion, is what keeps DEUCE BIGALOW from being a  first-rate comedy.  Bottom line:  it's worth seeing for the laughs; you pay  about a dollar a joke given the price of the DVD, but the jokes are worth  it.",968457600,,1783,4.602564102564102

2459168,3,B000CDGVQW,"While watching `Deuce Bigalow: Male Gigolo,' you may well find yourself laughing out loud from time to time - and hating yourself for it afterwards. For this lame brained comedy, beyond being incredibly juvenile  and silly in its comedic temperament, also manages to be as politically  incorrect as possible, using as its targets the obese, the handicapped and  an assortment of social outcasts and misfits. And, although the ribbing is  generally quite good-natured and even affectionate at times, one can't help  but feel a little guilty about laughing.
The formula for the film adheres  very closely to the one employed by virtually all ""Saturday Night  Live"" or ""Second City"" alumni in their initial forays into  big screen comedies. Once again we have the usual bumbling nerd trying to  win acceptance as a `cool dude,' making a shambles of everything he  touches, yet ultimately managing to garner the respect of his peers and the  love of a beautiful woman. Rob Schneider plays the title role, a  professional fish tank cleaner who, through a complicated series of  circumstances, finds himself delving into the realm of `man whore' in order  to earn some much needed money. The stupidity of the premise and the  situations cannot be underestimated as Schneider is put through a series of  pratfalls, misunderstandings and verbal slugfests that are often quite  amusing almost in spite of themselves. It takes either a certain amount of  daring or a shocking degree of insensitivity (or perhaps a little of both)  to line up a series of jokes and sight gags aimed at people who suffer from  obesity, Tourettes Syndrome, Narcolepsy, blindness and limb amputation -  but this film does it. Somehow, though, the film manages to treat its  characters with such a genial fondness that it never seems particularly  harsh or mean spirited. Whether or not that mitigates the feeling of guilt  resulting from one's laughter must, finally, be a matter of personal  conscience I suppose.
Schneider plays the lead in a nicely relaxed  fashion, not succumbing to the hyperbolic mugging that so many comics are  prone to indulge in when faced with similar roles. And what a pleasant  surprise to encounter Marlo Thomas of all people in an uncredited cameo  appearance - and still looking like a knockout in her sexy lingerie.
`Deuce Bigalow' may not sit well with the easily offended or with those  who prefer their comedy to be of a bit more - um, shall we say - cerebral  nature. Still, unabashed silliness makes for a fun time every now and then  and, in that spirit, this film deserves to be seen.",964396800,,2594,4.919168591224018

This movie came and went almost unnoticed in  the theatres; with a better marketing effort, it could very well have been  one of the big comic films of the summer.  As it is, it is sure to be a  long-term best-seller at the video store, and in my book is worth owning  simply so it will be there, on your shelf, when you want a laugh.",963878400,,774,4.183673469387755

2459177,3,B000CDGVQW,"This movie had a very good premise.  Unfortunately, the script didn't live  up to it.  Schneider did a very good job in his role, as usual.  There were  a lot of interesting characters in this film, but none of them were really  developed enough.  It didn't help that it was only 88 minutes long.  I  would have liked to see a little more of Schneider's character before  jumping into the story...a little more background, but that didn't happen.  It looks like the writer had all these scenes in his head and then wrote a  story around them.  This makes for a very jumpy movie...no real transitions  and a serious lack of character development.  Hopefully, people will give  Schneider the chance to prove that he can do better than this.
Despite  these shortcomings, it was still an entertaining movie.  Schneider is a  very capable comedian (just look at him in BIG DADDY).  The scenes for his  dates with the reject women were pretty hilarious.  The gigolo whose house  he's watch ing was great.  This film is good for a few laughs, but,  unfortunately, nothing to get excited over.",962668800,,1085,4.67379679144385
2459178,1,B000CDGVQW,"I went to see this film with high expectations.  Rob Schneider is usually thrown into very small supporting roles which are occassionally funny, but often consist of very little dialogue, mostly made up of incoherent  jibberish or a dialect unheard of to most.  This is Schneider's first  starring role, but I think I actually prefer the 10 words he spoke in  ""The Waterboy"" to the hundreds he speaks in this film.
Not only  is ""Deuce Bigalow"" unfunny, it's boring and mildly offensive.  It  tries to relay a message to the audience, but the message gets messed up  and comes across as ""Prostitution is funny"" and ""If you're  an outcast, paying for sex is the same as paying for  friendship.""
Rob Schneider fails miserably with this mess.  Characters over-act to try to get a laugh out of the audience and lines are  repeated, hoping to get a laugh the third our forth time around  (""Man-whore,"" for example, is way overused). Characters are not  given time to develop in the short running time and the ending is so  similar to the average Adam Sandler film (who helped make this one), it  seems as though he took the basic plot for ""Big Daddy,"" changed a  little of it, and then kept the ending only supplying in new dialogue.
To watch this incredibly bad film is a waste of time, although if you do  decide to watch it, the film is quite short.  The basic idea isn't bad, it  was just poorly executed.",962582400,,1403,4.554216867469879
2459179,3,B000CDGVQW,"First of all, let me say that ""Deuce Bigalow: Male Giggolo"" garnered far fewer negative remarks from customer reviewers than I expected.  Although this picture is certainly less than politically correct  with some of its humor, I completely disagree with the reviewer who  referred to it as ""mean-spirited"".
Rob Schneider turns in a  fine performance as Deuce Bigalow, a fish tank cleaner with a dead end job  and no romantic prospects until he is asked to house sit for a  ""man-whore"".  After damaging the house he has to make $6,000  quickly and turns to-you guessed it-male prostitution.  This plot opens up  a number of possibilities and almost succeeds in answering the question of  what kind of woman would want the services of a male prostitute.  Deuce is  paired subsequently with an overeater, a woman with a growth disorder, a  woman with narcolepsy, and a woman with Tourette's syndrome.  Along the way  he falls for a woman who also has an imperfection-a prosthetic leg.  Unfortunately this woman doesn't know Deuce is a male prostitute who was  hired to go out with her by her friends.  I won't tell you how the picture  ends other than saying its very predictable.
What I find particularly  noteworthy about this picture is that it uses afflictions as comedy fodder  but somehow manages to do so without ridiculing or denigrating, a nice  touch for this kind of movie.  The humor sometimes frequently gets kind of  childish and silly, but then again those who purchase or rent ""Deuce  Bigalow"" usually know what sort of humor to expect from a movie  involving a former SNL cast member.  It's a good one to rent, but given the  predictability of the plot and the rather tepid level of the gags I would  definitely not purchase this one, especially on DVD.",962064000,,1768,4.796666666666667

2459186,1,B000CDGVQW,"Everything about DEUCE BIGALOW: MALE GIGOLO screams ""putme back in development"".  This is a film that has the kernel ofgreatness about it, but which never gets enough expositional heat to pop.
Obviously rushed through production, the film's editing is terribly uneven, its characters are largely caricatures, and so much of the action is superfluous to the plot that it appears to have been written as filmed, rather than the reverse.  Indeed, there's a schizophrenia to the film-a tension between utter banality and uplifting morality play--that never fully gets resolved.  What Deuce Bigalow needed was less attention to making funny bits and more interest in its thematic whole.
There are gems here, to be sure. The basic theme, that the best kind of sexual attention is non-sexual in origin, deserves applause.  And Eddie Griffin and Arija Bareikis put in utterly likable performances as Deuce's pimp and girlfriend.
But otherwise, characters' uniqueness-be it their homosexuality, height, blindness, handicap, obesity, attractiveness, or even disease-are used more or less cruelly for jokes.  Characters become *labeled* by their differentness, rather than *exposited* by them. Ironically, a film which concludes that peoples' sexual images would be improved by caring partners who could look at them as whole people, is continuously guilty of doing the opposite.
In short, I could not disagree more with the Amazon.com editorial review of this movie. It's nothing like THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT MARY.  In that movie, the plot-and much of the comedy--comes from the characters' well-scripted relationships.  Even the most outrageous scene in that movie makes sense from what we know of Ben Stiller and Cameron Diaz' characters.  Here, the plot isn't generated by Deuce Bigalow, it happens *to* him.  Given that Rob Schneider wrote the film, it's odd that he forgot to write himself a character.",961718400,,1897,5.403389830508474

That particular scene seemed to me, however, to be somewhat  offensive - when Deuce's father enlightens him on his mother's occupation  as a Thai prostitute.  I may of course be wrong, but what I found quite  offensive in this was not only an implication that Thailand was a haven for  this profession, but also the obvious error that the scriptwriter made when  he alluded to the ""bibingka"" as being a Thai delicacy (as far as  I know, it's Filipino).
