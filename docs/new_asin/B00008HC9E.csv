I especially love the friendship and fun the various people and crews make out of their time (and also seeing the different atmosphere's on each boat - we all been there, ugh and yay!)",1344729600,,402,4.465753424657534

7984083,5,B00008HC9E,"Roy Disney is well known in the sailing community, after all he set the Transpac record on Pyewacket in 1999 that still stands. What is less known is that he is also behind of quite a few sailing videos. I believe Ensenada Yacht Race is the first one (I could be wrong), there were few short documentaries and there is also the most excellent history of Transpac.

This is a good sailing documentary. The story is uncomplicated, there are some minor twists and excellent quality camera work throughout as the narrative follows Roys boat ""Shamrock"", Kris Kristovs boat ""Green Hungarian"" and, a novelty at a time, a maxi boat ""Checkmate"" all racing from Newport to Ensenada, a relatively short trip that takes just a bit over 28 hours.

This is a 1970s movie and in many ways it is very authentic which makes it interesting to watch not only because of the sailing, but also because of the documentary aspect of it. The boats, the people, the hair styles, clothing straight from the ""Boogie nights"", bad dental work and most importantly the prices. Yep, it is 1978 all right.

Also, the camera crew was clearly influenced by some other films of the era, which is probably as expected, but nevertheless it was interesting to see elements of ""French Connection"" and ""Dirty Harry"" in a sailing documentary.

5 stars out of 5, it is that good.

Thank you Roy for preserving this little bit of history.",1186617600,2,1395,4.677551020408163
