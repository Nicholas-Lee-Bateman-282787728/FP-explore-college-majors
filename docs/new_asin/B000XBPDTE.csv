The characters all wear gas masks, so you can't tell who's talking and you can't hear about 85% of dialogue.  The movie is extremely long and difficult to watch.

It's almost like a visual jigsaw puzzle, but due to horrible filming and sound, you're missing the majority of the pieces.  Good luck trying to watch this nightmare.",1240531200,2,404,4.47945205479452

I tried turning it up but the underlying hiss on the sound was too much.  The camera work gave me motion sickness and the grainy B/W picture had a nasty habit of cutting to complete black.  At the end I wasn't sure who was whom.....did the bad guy get shot at the ""RV"" point or did he get thrown off the roof.  I gave this movie 2 stars only because I liked the overall idea.  I think the producers of this film should spent more time on the back story of the characters instead of ""stretch"" shots (such as the 5 minute card game).",1235779200,2,640,4.0476190476190474
3000521,1,B000XBPDTE,"Q:  How do you cover up the fact that your acting is poor and dialog worse?

A: Wear NBC protective masks, and don't mike them up.

Q:  How to use up the extra tape in your hand held video recorder?

A:  Film your buddies and you playing cards while wearing pro-masks for several minutes.  Ensure any dialog is unintelligible and cannot progress the plot of your story as a result.

Q:  How to waste hard earned dollars?

A:  Buy a copy of The Veil!

This movie was just awful.  I'm sure the guys had fun making it, and more fun watching it and seeing themselves on thier TVs.  However, like the ashtray I made from playdoh for my Dad back in kindergarten, it is a treasure only enjoyed by those who made it.  Unfortunately, the makers of the Veil decided to market their movie.  I wish I could sell my playdoh ashtray and recoup some of the money I wasted on this DVD.

If you have to watch it, watch it on a DVD player which allows you to fast forward at least 4x speed.  That way you will waste much less of your life....",1234828800,2,1024,4.164102564102564
3000522,1,B000XBPDTE,"Honestly, this has got to be one of the worst zombie movies I have ever watched in my entire life (and I have watched too many of them)! Where to start?

The cinematography is horrible. The movie is like watching a very long, very drawn out, and very poorly orchestrated YouTube movie. Yes. I compared this movie to a YouTube movie. It is as if someone made a movie literally out of pocket. The budget couldn't have been much over 100 bucks.

The zombies. Most of the zombies in this movie are just people, nothing special. No makeup for most of them. No real special effects, unless you count the few zombies that you could tell were wearing Halloween masks. When the zombies were attacked by the main characters (I will get to that after this), the actors playing the zombies were just terrible at acting their part. Possibly the worst acting in any released movie ever.

The main characters. Very vague. There's not a whole lot shown about them, you may as well read the back of the DVD box if you wish to know anything about them. Apparently they're special ops units who know absolutely nothing of how to defend themselves correctly. They make the stupidest decisions, and don't know how to board up the (stereotypical of a zombie movie) abandoned house in which they make their safezone.

I am the type of person to LOVE a bad movie for all its awfulness, but even this movie was too terrible for me. The worst part? It's almost 2 hours long.

I would list ""the only redeeming quality"" of this movie, but there literally isn't one. This movie is absolute garbage, and 1 star was far, FAR too much to give it.

It was made by Brain Damage Films, and for good reason: The writer/director, Richard Chance, suffers from it.",1206489600,5,1725,4.530546623794212
3000523,5,B000XBPDTE,"Some of the comments on here are so off-base and borderline rude, I wonder if and (dare I say?) doubt that many of the reviewers actually PURCHASED (much less watched) ""The Veil"", and have instead pounced on an opportunity to compete among themselves to see who can be the most clever. It is a disservice to the filmmakers and consumers alike, and I hope that such reviews won't keep horror fans from supporting indie filmmaking and giving this particular film a chance (especially as it is reasonably priced on this site).

In a day and age when moviegoers are being handed remake after remake and are being spoiled by CGI (and not in a good way), this film is raw and unembellished by the interference of Hollywood production. I am excited that such movies are still being made, from the heart and not the wallet.

The score should be released on its own separate CD (one day, perhaps), as it is excellent - I will go as far to say that it is just as good as anything Goblin did for Argento. The acting is also very good; yes, there are instances in which the dialogue is muted, but I am convinced that this is deliberate (a sequence in which the the soldiers are playing cards comes to mind), as the director makes sure we hear what we are meant to and when. There are two instances in which this is apparent - when the prevalent zombie wail reaches saturation to the point where the protagonists are driven to the edge of madness - and towards the end, when a plot twist propels the film to a stunning reveal.

Anyone who might be put off by reports of shaky camera work (I myself suffer from motion sickness) should know that unlike films such as ""The Blair Witch Project"" and the recent ""Cloverfield"", ""The Veil"" (made prior to the recent wave of zombie horror) confines these scenes to the beginning, and I feel that even they serve a purpose. Pay attention to the scene in which the virus is unleashed - it's as if the voyeur himself has gone from observer to rabid dog, darting about the quietude of a sleepy English town, infected, looking for something and nothing at the same time. Will he go for the little girl playing by the water? Will he attack the unsuspecting elderly man? Even the makeups suggest a new kind of zombie, pockmarked and foaming (it's nothing we've seen before), and I challenge anyone who wants to deride the result to recall Savini's bluish-green zombies in Dawn with a straighter face.

The film transitions from color to black and white, with interspersions of color in flashback scenes, underscoring the desolation of the new reality of confinement and hopelessless. Nothing is an accident - even the gas masks meant to protect the soldiers from the virus are self defeating, suffocating their owners, robbing them of their identities, and concealing  intent.

Having bought ""The Veil"" and watched it in its entirety, I can honestly say that it is the most refreshing film to grace the genre in quite some time. To its credit and detriment, ""The Veil"" is simply before and after its time, reminiscent of the late 70s and early 80s, when anyone with imagination, heart and a Super 8 (Tapert, Cambell and Raimi of Evil Dead come to mind) made a film. This is a haunting film that makes use of every resource, to good effect. Of course, there are plenty of bad films out there with great CGI, and if that's what you're looking for, I invite you to purchase ""House of the Dead"" instead.",1203897600,5,3420,4.5709624796084825
3000524,4,B000XBPDTE,"Review time!!

1) ACTING: The acting was pretty good for a low / no budget indie. No oscars will be awarded here, but everyone seemed convincing in their roles.

2) PRODUCTION: The filming seemed weird to me. I had a lot of scenes that pixilated on me. I tried the dvd on another dvd player and on my computer, and I still had the pixilation issues. The black & white filming helped make the movie seem more desperate & hopeless, more destitute. The blood and gore was plentiful and many different weapons were used to dispose of the zombies.

3) THE ZOMBIES: Nothing really new here. The zombies seemed to differ in look and ""speed"" from zombie to zombie.

4) THE CAUSE: Man made air virus.

5) NUDITY: None.

FINAL: Overall, I did enjoy this, as the people behind it are obviously individuals who enjoy the zombie genre. Some new ideas were presented to the viewers. I do wish, though, that there was more money involved, as I felt there were some budgetary restraints that hindered the film. Also, the film clocked in at 2 and a half hours, and I felt that some scenes were drawn out and could have benefited from being shortened. And I won't even mention the art on the dvd case. The company behind the distribution of 'The Veil' was responsible for the artwork. A nice entry into the low / no budget zombie indie. Be sure to check out what's behind 'The Veil!'

8227839,1,B000XBPDTE,"""The Veil"" is Australia's official entry into ""worst zombie movie"" and it is a stinker. Filmed almost all in black and white and at night, they saved a lot of money. An airborne virus is let loose in a small town. Some special forces are sent in to kill the infected people who have turned into killing zombies. I would tell you more, but that is basically the bulk of the movie.

1) The main characters wore cartridge gas masks ineffective against airborne viruses. They are extremely uncomfortable and you never drink through them.

2) Some zombies are fast moving, while others had the gout.

3) Most zombies had no make-up. Others wore cheap masks, which looked extremely fake and really having nothing to do with zombies.

4) One female (and a zombie at that) in the whole movie. This isn't a prison film.

5) Rapid fire machine gun special effects consisted of a strobe light and a guy beating on a bucket to make gun sounds. The lights and sound didn't match up too well. The movie would have been better if they showed a man with a strobe trying to beat a bucket to the rhythm of the light.

6.) Big special effect scene was when they ran over a rubber mask filled with mayonnaise that squirted out the eye socket. They showed it twice, must have been the big budget item.

7.) The main characters wore masks nearly the whole movie. They were all about the same size, had the same accent, and wore the same clothes. How the heck was I to figure out which one was talking?

On top of that it was boring. Guys running around in gas masks shooting guys with rubber masks. I would cut my arm off before I would watch this film again, it is just that good.",1309737600,,1659,4.363636363636363
8227840,4,B000XBPDTE,"First off, people giving harsh reviews because of the fact the film is in black and white are total idiots.  Some of the greatest movies of all time were black and white, what difference does it make as long as it's a well made movie.  This is obviously a low budget film, but I have no problem there since they used what they had to the best of their ability.  I love the unpolished, natural atmosphere created here.  I love zombie films and this one had shades of Night Of The Living Dead and almost reminded me of left 4 dead when they are running through the streets at night shooting zeds.  But one thing refreshing here is they actually run out of bullets, guns actually jam, it's way more realistic, the characters don't have unlimited mags that never drain as zombies close in.  Great job guys, make a sequel.",1282348800,4,817,4.413333333333333
8227841,4,B000XBPDTE,"A zombie-flick shot the avant-garde way: The camerawork's unusual and interesting, to say the least, the film is shot in black and white with colour bookends, some of the filmstock is intentionally grainy, large portions of the film are without dialogue, the gasmasked protagonists give the movie an otherworldly feel, ...

If you think though, making an avant-garde zombie movie is necessarily a silly idea, well it is not, as this film is in parts incredibly moody and intense - despite its low production values - and many scenes you have seen way too often in other zombie flicks seem fresh again. That all said, the film's unfortunately less than perfect: With a running time of two and a half hours, it's way too long for its rather feeble narrative, and the fact that all characters wear gasmasks makes it incredibly difficult to follow the plot as such let alone create sympathy for the characters.

Still, The Veil is worth a look, to say the very least.",1277683200,3,963,4.7604790419161676
8227842,1,B000XBPDTE,"I love zombie movies, and I can sit through a low budget one with the best of them. So naturally I thought too many people were being hard on this movie like they were on so many other zombie flicks. However, here is the honest breakdown; It was hard at times to hear what the characters were saying through the bio hazard masks they wore all through the movie.. The movie was filmed in black and white, so there was a lot of dark scenes that were hard to see. The quality was grainy at times, almost like it was filmed on old VHS tape. But perhaps the worst part was the plot.. It starts out with a virus being let loose in a small town. This part of the movie lasts about five minutes.. then suddenly the words pop up, ""THREE DAYS LATER."" And were thrust into the midst of the military clean up guys shooting zombies, then deciding to rest in one of the abandon houses... Then they play cards.. have a few flash backs of what happened before they got in the house, (which we didn't see until the flashbacks.)Then the entire rest of the movie is just scene after scene of these guys running through the streets shooting zombies... OR.. they are holed up in the house at night, some zombies break in and they have to shoot them too. That's all it is folks..no kidding.. SPOILER ALERT PASSED THIS POINT:  The ending of the movie is typical.. one guy survives in the end,makes it to the pick up spot where he is supposed to be picked up by the rest of the military.. and when he gets there, they shoot him. Then we see planes bombing the zombie infested town, and hear radio reports that the virus has spread.... GREAT... with two and half hours of film, they should have concentrated on a story line, not just random shooting scenes over and over again. Some of the zombies were okay, others just looked like plain people.. others were people wearing really cheap rubber masks. I can't disagree with the bad reviews this time.. They were right on the money.",1265846400,2,1956,4.373626373626373
8227843,5,B000XBPDTE,"THE VEIL is a micro-budget zombie-holocaust movie that rises above its limitations. Its epic scale (2 and a half hours in length) allows the ambitious story to unfold in increasingly hellish jolts of panic, death, and doom. The zombie attacks are fierce and unpredictable. The military response is shot in such a way as to involve the viewer in the suffocatingly oppressive onslaught. I love the idea that people can still make movies like this without zillions of dollars for car chases, explosions, or cartoonish CGI. If you enjoy independent horror films, then add THE VEIL to your collection. Also available on DECREPIT CRYPT OF NIGHTMARES...",1257552000,3,646,5.10377358490566
8227844,2,B000XBPDTE,"""The Veil packs more visceral punch than Cronenberg on Amphetamine sulphate?""
more like cronenberg on down syndrome and laxatives overdose!
4 guys (the marines that will clean up the mess) talking trhough gas masks,a beggining with a man on a pier holding a briefcase with the virus?a dreamy sequence of the virus breaking out?people on candit camera doing their jobs,having a walk in the park with their children.and then hell on earth,with our high school loser friends playing the zombies?
the best was the army zombie-giant towards the end?(150 minutes,i thought this movie would never end!).
good intentions and nice diy gore effects,
but please people,dont over praise something just to make it sale.
back in the 80s people made more with far less...what happened to the new generation of camera holding filmakers?is it a budget thing?there is sure love in it,but it didn't came through as it should....either way,another zombie movie on my archive that i won't check out twice.",1245456000,4,984,5.118012422360248
