8465790,4,6304502370,"Bloodhounds II is a good flick for a Saturday afternoon.  Corbin Bernson is pretty much standard issue as Harrison Coyle, the writer bedeviled by a vengeful murderer. Nia Peebles has her moments as Coyle's partner in the  search. Ian Tracey does a fine job as the man living a double-life. His  martial arts ability is terrific to see onscreen. All in all, this is a  must-see for any who enjoy a good murder mystery.",929145600,2,417,4.594594594594595
