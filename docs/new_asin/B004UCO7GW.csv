8441422,5,B004UCO7GW,"I just went trogh the first lighting dvds and they are awsome: very clear ,  a lot of practical advices, If you are looking as a videomaker to improve ypur skillls with lights this might be perfect place to start.",1342569600,,213,4.325
8441423,4,B004UCO7GW,"So both of these programs are a few years old at this point and one of the first things you may notice is that the instructional material itself looks dated - as in the lighting of the guy who is telling you about lighting doesn't look so fabulous by today's standards. The example material and the information presented however is solid and still very applicable.

The audio across the boards is flawless. The teaching style is very comfortable and the emphasis is on fundamentals that really don't change over time, rather than gear that changes constantly. In fact, when you look over all the training material available today, I can't think of a more comprehensive set of training materials on the two most important fundamentals of production technology - lighting and sound. They just don't exist on DVD. So in that regard, someone opting out of film school for the self-teaching route could fill a big chunk of their education by going through these discs several times, taking good notes and practicing on small projects in between. There are a bunch of other aspects of filmmaking to consider - composition, blocking, working with actors, etc - but these subjects, lighting and sound, would be well covered for someone starting out.

My nitpicks - a lot of times throughout these discs, a paragraph of text shows on screen covering a key point as the presenter talks about it - but the words are paraphrased. So I'm sitting there trying to read the words on screen and listen to what the guy is saying at the same time and inevitably stop tracking with one or the other. This may just be me and my learning style, but if I'm going to read and listen at the same time, I want the words to be verbatim. Otherwise it doesn't help to have both.

Secondly, I'm no mathematician but there seemed to be a small inconsistency early in the first lighting disc when presenting the Inverse Square Law. Not a math error per se, but a flaw in logic. If doubling the distance from a light source to the subject decreases the intensity by four times, then the distance the light source needs to be moved to halve the intensity should be 50% of the distance to the subject. The presenter repeatedly says 40% and sites the math of calculating f-stops; 40% increase in aperture diameter doubles the gathering of light. This is true because the area of a circle is roughly doubled by a 40% increase of the diameter. I couldn't see how that translated to the Inverse Square Law though. I sent an email to the guys that put out the DVD, but didn't get an answer. I'm not saying they are wrong, I'm just saying I didn't get my question answered, whereas I would have by taking a class. Otherwise, the overall result is just as good as if I would have taken a class which would have cost a lot more than these discs and would not be repeatable. So that's pretty cool.",1336608000,,2853,4.557504873294347
8441424,5,B004UCO7GW,"Okay, okay, no it doesn't cover everything you would go through in actual film school but, you could not ask for more key information in the amount of time the DVD's run. Which is something like 8hrs. Every minute of it is insanely informative and for someone who has been mostly self taught over the last 5 years, this filled in so many gaps in my knowledge and understanding of both Sound and Lighting. Can't recommend enough. It is a little cheesy, but in good enjoyable way as it is pretty intentional. You might be surprised at how the lessons are executed...",1330992000,,564,4.53921568627451
