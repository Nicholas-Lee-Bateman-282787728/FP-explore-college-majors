8287316,5,B001CEIK3M,"I love slayers. I really love this series. Yet the price is just pretty hard to take. It is kinda a shock. 50 dollars for two, just two episodes...I do not want to kill this great series before it reaches its' prime so I will have to think about this. I am sure many fans will  have to as well. 25 dollars for 30 minutes...sigh. I hope you found this bit of info useful, because I was all set to buy it thinking it was a full season at this price.",1222992000,3,447,3.912087912087912
8287317,5,B001CEIK3M,"Slayers Revolution is possibly the most well planned decade-after sequel series in anime history; maintaining all of the original voice actors from 10 years ago, the same background music we all remember, & the character design changes are so insignificant that even an artisticly trained eye will scarcely notice Lina's breast reduction or Amelia's darker hair. Megumi Hayashibara is of course doing the music, a pitty the didn't also snag Masami Okui, but Megumi has tailored the songs to sound more like her older style.

This season isn't as Dungeons & Dragons oriented as the last three; they essentially tossed a Digimon & Rupan the Third's Detective Zenigatta into the frey, but Xellos came back, so all is forgiven. Humerously, the first antagonist in the first episode appears to be none other than the pirate; Jack Sparrow.

Now for the BAD news: Funimation bought the rights to Slayers! Next to 4Kids, Funimation is the worst dubbing company in history. They have no plans to dubb Slayers Revolution any time soon, but if they do, you KNOW they're going to take everything that made the first 3 dubbed seasons good & throw them out the window, starting by not hiring the same English voice actors we've all been accustomed to, even though doing so ensures collosal failure, just like the dubbs of Saiyuki Reload & Gunlock.",1222992000,6,1333,4.92
8287318,5,B001CEIK3M,"Slayers Revolution is currently being televised in Japan and I was lucky enough to catch a few episodes.  It's a fresh storyline, picking up shortly after Slayers Try concluded.  The writing style is vintage Slayers with all of the hints and nips at depth and complexity of character along a clear plotline that made the first three series my favorite anime to date.  The writing style has been seasoned by the over-the-top silliness of the OVA line, but the underlying plot appears to be more multifaceted than usual too.  The animation style has been updated for 2008, but everybody's still wearing their old outfits -- only major change is that Gourry looks a bit thinner, perhaps part-elf (see Slayers The Motion Picture).  All of the usual voice talent got re-signed for the series, so everybody sounds like you expect them to (so long as you're watching the subbed, not dubbed, version).  I'm eagerly anticipating this release!",1220054400,3,933,4.948717948717949
