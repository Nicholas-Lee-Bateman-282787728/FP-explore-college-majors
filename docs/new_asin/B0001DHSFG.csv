1991947,5,B0001DHSFG,"I love doing pilates at home and this new DVD is a great addition to my DVD collection.  You do a traditional 40 minute pilates workout with great instruction and reminders on how/when to breathe.  After the pilates Ana leads you through a walking sequence that really ups your heart rate (the cardio portion of the workout).  It lasts 15 minutes and she leads you through different movements, lunges, etc.  I really enjoy this workout and appreciate a little cardio after doing my pilates.  I also have the ""Bands"" Gaiam Pilates video and the Mari Windsor Pilates DVDs.",1104710400,7,570,4.775510204081633
1991948,3,B0001DHSFG,"i am new to the whole workout video thing, and i know that ana caban is a good pilates instructor, so i gave this one a shot. the warm up is your typical pilates.... the 100, leg circles, criss-cross, etc, and not very many reps. it just gets you warmed up for about 15-20 minutes. then the cardio segment is low-impact, low-intensity, and VERY repetitive. that segment is 20 minutes. i mean seriously, it's four basic low-impact moves, with two short bursts of high impact. unless you're sleeping, you'll get bored.

so i thought i had wasted a whole 17 bucks on this one, but i'm finding that i end up using it more than my others. i modify the cardio with weights, repeat segments to make it longer, and listen to my own music instead of the ridiculous soundtrack they have in the video. i modify the warm up by doing more stretches. so each time i do it it's a little different, according to what i need on a particular day. who can just follow along with a video all the time, anyway?

i have serious back issues, and this one i feel is a good choice because it's anatomically sound and won't injure you. you just have to kick it up a little when you are feeling up to it, and do the workout as is when you are not. if you're ok with taking that initiative, you will like this video. if you want to just put it in the player and follow along to the end, you may want to pick something else.",1095897600,54,1395,4.201492537313433
1991949,4,B0001DHSFG,"Overall, I'm very happy with this DVD.
The pilates workout is great for both beginners and regular pilates enthusiasts. Advanced users may find it too easy.. I don't know.
Regardless, this gives you a great workout and DOES get your heart rate up towards the end(keeps it up, too).
The cardio does leave a little to be desired, though.
The moves are WAY easy/standard. These are things you already know how to do. The plus side is you won't really need the instruction for this portion of the program.
However, if all you're looking for is a long, great(but fairly easy) pilates home workout with a short, standard, easy to do cardio ending; you've found your ideal DVD.
The instructor is very clear with instructions and great with reminders to breathe, keeping your stomach ""scooped"", etc.

Again, this would make an EXCELLENT beginner's pilates/cardio DVD,and an average(to above average) workout for anyone above that level.
Advanced users may want to pass on this one.
Also.. if you want a LOT of cardio, pass. There is only about 15 minutes worth on this 42 minute DVD. What's there IS effective, however.

*EDITED 04/20/2005(initial date of review was Sept 23, 2004)* to add that this is still my FAVOURITE pilates workout tape. I've had to stop using it temporarily, because I'm pregnant(not supposed to do exercise on your back when pregnant)... but I can't WAIT to use this to get rid of the post-pregnancy weight. I will say I saw a HUGE difference in my body after even 2 weeks of not using this tape. So, the DVD was *definitely* doing its job. Still VERY HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.",1095811200,62,1588,4.7709090909090905
1991950,3,B0001DHSFG,"I had previously bought Ana Caban's pilates beginning mat workout so I thought that this DVD would have the same style movements, just with a more cardio-intensive focus. What I got was not what I expected, though. The DVD is about 45 minutes altogether and it's divided into two main sections: The first section is ALMOST IDENTICAL TO THE PILATES BEGINNING MAT WORKOUT. Therefore, anyone out there who already owns the beginning mat workout (like me) would do better to try a different DVD, because you're really only getting 20 minutes of unique material (the second section). If you don't already own the beginning mat workout, let me briefly describe it: it's basic pilates mat movements that focus on the core muscles, or ""powerhouse"" and incorporate flexibility and balance. The second section is where the ""cardio"" kicks in. These exercises are performed standing up and do increase your heart rate, but there's literally only a handful of different movements. I find these exercises to be rather boring--not just because they're repeated over and over, but also because they're more like basic aerobics exercises than like pilates-inspired moves. For example, the first movement involves bringing both arms from a 90-degree angle in front of you to your sides while transferring weight to one leg slightly and bending the knee of the unweighted leg to a 90-degree angle behind you, then repeating by alternating bent legs. Which pilates movement this was based on, I have no idea. All in all, it's not a bad video though--Ana is a decent instructor, making fewer goofy comments than she did in the beginning mat workout-for example, in this DVD she omitted the ""arf-arf"" seal noise that she made while introducing The Seal in the beginning mat workout. The scenery is also a plus for those exercisers who care about ambience - the workout is performed in a pavilion with a lot of foliage in the background - and the music is up-beat but not overpowering. Each exercise is its own chapter in the DVD, so you can skip or go back to exercises easily. I just wasn't impressed overall because the ""cardio"" part turned out to be only 20 minutes worth of the same 4-5 movements that were painfully repetitive and lacking pilates influence. If you like pilates and are looking for an effective pilates-inspired workout with variety, I highly recommend Liz Gillies' Progressive Pilates series- I own and love the 4 10-minute target-tone workouts DVD, and the For Weight Loss DVD, although I haven't tried it yet, looks equally good.",1094947200,11,2531,4.943661971830986
1991951,4,B0001DHSFG,"I really enjoy the mat segment of this video. It is moderately difficult. The atmospheric setting adds to the relaxation I get from the movements. What makes this a cardio workout as well is the segment performed off the mat in traditional aerobic style, with constant reminders to ""use your powerhouse"". This segment gets rather repetative and is not nearly as challenging as the mat workout. But it adds a nice balance to the pilates workout and gets you up and moving, even if your heart rate may not elevate that much. A good buy!",1090368000,7,534,4.631578947368421
1991952,4,B0001DHSFG,"This DVD offers an inviting backdrop, excellent timing and transitions between exercises. It gives a great 40-minute Pilates routine that differs slightly from others that I have used, with many of the traditional exercises and some less common ones that adds a little variety. The title says Cardio Pilates, but I feel that is dependant upon your over-all fitness level and experience with Pilates. I jog regularly and perform Pilates frequently and didn't find my heart elevated for some of the DVD, but still feel like I got a great workout. If you're looking for a feel good work out and some Pilates variety, I strongly suggest giving this one a go!",1083283200,19,654,4.848214285714286

HOWEVER, after just completing this so called ""workout"" I feel compelled to do so. I don't know how they can call his a cardio work out. My heart rate never got up. The Pilates portion of the DVD is just like any other pilates I have done, nothing special. The cardio is a COMPLETE JOKE!!

1991959,4,B0001DHSFG,"This is a good overall workout that works all muscles and gets your heart rate up without killing you! Really sore abs and arms after the first few uses. I alternate with days using the treadmill, since there is only 20 minutes of low impact cardio on the dvd.

1991960,4,B0001DHSFG,"I bought this DVD prior to reading reviews, which I never do (I usually buy exercise DVDs online from another retailers after reading all the comments and watching clips). I got home, read the reviews, and was sort of disappointed. However, Gaiam never makes very hard ""cardio"" workouts, though they like to tack that word onto all of their products, and I wasn't expecting this to be a hard-core, Cathe F. style program. First, I like Ana Cabon a lot. She's warm, friendly, and makes the moves seem very doable. I should caution that she does not show modifiers for any poses, nor does she explain a lot about form. If you're brand-new to pilates, review some other DVDs first to get a strong understanding of how it works. The pilates segment, which comes first, is excellent. They're pretty standard poses, with a couple new ones that I haven't done before. The cardio segment is shorter (including the cool-down, I'd say around 15 minutes? I didn't time it) and includes some squats at the end.

Here, I differ from other reviewers. In my opinion, you only get out of a workout what you put into it. If you're going to put in a half-hearted effort, then this (or any DVD workouts, really) isn't going to be very challenging. I'm not new to exercise, so to increase the challenge, I simply modify moves. Rather than march in place, I jog in place. Rather than arms straight out during hamstring curls, I lift my arms over my head. I do lunges and punches for the side-to-side arm movements. I squat deeper during those cardio moves, and lunge deeper, to get my heart-rate where I want it. I simply make the moves bigger, deeper, bouncier, etc. When I do that, I break a nice sweat. This isn't going to be your major cardio workout for the week, but it's a nice one for giving sore muscles a rest, or if you'd like some extra cardio time on your pilates day.",1229299200,6,1860,4.519287833827893
1991961,5,B0001DHSFG,"To be honest, I don't do the actual cardio part (which is only about 15 min at the end) so the title is quite misleading, but I'm still giving it 5 stars because the 30 minutes of pilates before the cardio is GREAT.  It has all of my favorite moves in half and hour, but then I turn it off when she says it's time for cardio because I don't think the cardio section is up to par.",1227398400,,379,3.858974358974359
1991962,2,B0001DHSFG,"I enjoyed this DVD up until the cardio portion, which is the last 10 mintures or so.

The cardio portion is seriously 4 steps repeated over and over again - didn't do a thing for me and was very boring.

So I would get this DVD just for the first 30 minutes - a nice all over body pilates work out.",1220400000,,298,3.8688524590163933
1991973,3,B0001DHSFG,"The dvd is split into two sections.  The first part is pilates based (25-30), while the second part (10 minutes)is cardio based.  The cardio was not very effective.  The same move(walking in place) was used in variation.  I did not think the cardio was effective, however the pilates part was similar to a beginner workout.",1215043200,,323,4.818181818181818
1991974,3,B0001DHSFG,"I'm familiar with Pilates, but not an expert. I was looking for a DVD to help make it fun for me, but I got bored after the first 4 exercises.  I'm not sure why.",1211414400,,161,3.735294117647059
1991975,5,B0001DHSFG,"I understand why some people give this video negative reviews, but I think those are due to expectations of the video that aren't possible. The vidoe can't be everything to everbody.
I tend to do my cardio workouts on a bicycle, monitoring my heart rate, etc, and I do separate weight/resistance training and some pilates. But sometimes, I get very bored of biking or I wish to be a bit more active while doing pilates.
This workout moves more quickly than other pilates routines and finishes with a very simple cardio-only routine that keeps me moving continuously.
I LOVE the cardio portion because I am highly uncoordinated and have difficulty keeping up with or correctly doing the aerobics exercises. And the ease of this cardio portion means that I focus just on movement, body, breath, and not on what limbs to move in what direction for whatever sequence I'm on.
I think someone who loves aerobic vidoes woudl hate this. But since I generally want to throw things through the tv screen at the ""typical"" aeroics instructor (due to the annoying way they shout out ""encouragement"" and because I feel ridiculous being unable to do the sequences), I find this vidoe refreshing.
Ana is calm and mostly only talks to give clear instruction and reminders, rather than to shout out continuous phrases about how ""fun"" everything is, etc.
In short, Ana is a great instructor, if you want no-frills instruction (I have never hurt myself or been confused doing one of her videos); the pilates routine is challenging for anyone who understands the movements but isn't a pilates master; and the cardio is simple but efficient for increasing and maintaining a high heart rate. It doesn't replace aerobics vidoes or intense cardio biking, but I don't want it do either of those things, so I really appreciate having this available to me.",1208736000,4,1828,4.862179487179487

1991977,4,B0001DHSFG,"I have been doing pilates off and on as much as I can for the past two to three years and I used to do aerobics/cardio several times a week when I still had a gym membership. The pilates segment is very good. I have only done the dvd once, but it gave me a really good abs workout. The cardio/aerobics section was really more for doing a simple cardio workout for someone who is used to doing only pilates. I haven't been doing cardio a lot recently, so I bought this and it got my heartrate up, but it wouldn't be good for someone who does cardio on a regular basis. I would suggest getting this if you are like me and don't do cardio but would like to start. The cardio segment emphasizes how to use your core in aerobics, but the moves are quite basic. You might use this as a beginner video for cardio and then get something more cardio based as you move on. I would like to emphasize that the pilates segment is great and a good intermediate workout for someone bored with beginning workouts. It introduced me to a few pilates moves I hadn't done before and I will definitely use this dvd several times throughout the week. Also, I love Ana Caban, the instructor, although she does seem to be a bit too cheery during the cardio segment. This might come from the fact that she normally only does pilates videos, but she is always great at explaining moves and motivating you.",1199232000,,1379,4.3076923076923075
1991978,2,B0001DHSFG,"The pilates portion is pretty good - keeps your heart rate up, continuous movement.  The rocking moves are a little odd, but that's just me I guess.  The cardio portion is terrible.  No imagination, repetitive and very dull.",1186531200,,224,4.842105263157895
1991979,5,B0001DHSFG,"I am someone who has to quite high intensity cardio workouts all the time because they are too intense for me.  I am young, and though I am out of shape, it is always highly discouraging to have to stop woring out because I simply can't keeo up with the video, so I eventually just stop doing the video, and thus stop working out.  However, I find that the low intensity of the cardio segment is great for me.  Hopefully, ov er time I will be able to advance to higher impact, but this is a GREAT beginners workout.
Furthermore, i love to work my abs, so the beginning segment, while long and a little bit more advandced than my muscles can handle just yet, is a great workout too!",1185321600,,681,4.223076923076923
1991980,2,B0001DHSFG,"Concept is great but unless you are totally out of shape, this workout is pointless. I give it 2 stars because I think it could be a good workout for someone who is just beginning an exercise routine. Pilates portion is decent but short and the cardio tests your sanity, not your body, it is so boring. Not worth the purchase at all, I never use this one.",1180051200,,355,4.235294117647059
1991981,5,B0001DHSFG,"I first saw a shorter version of this on an Exercise on Demand channel. Thought I'd give the full video a try.

This workout is perfect for me.

Although I hadn't exercised in about 20 years, I used to be in shape. But after having a baby nearly three years ago my body simply never looked back.

When I was doing prenatal pilates I learned that being fit doesn't have to hurt (having been raised in the Jane Fonda era of ""Three more... Two more... And EIGHT more!...""). Now that I'm working on losing 20 pounds, I do not want to ""go for the burn."" I do not want to ache all over the next day. I do not want to spend so many days recovering from pain that I end up never going back to a workout.

For those who want to get in shape, but don't want to break their neck to do it, this workout is great. As for the repetitive cardio movements, they do their job; they get the heart rate up. Personally, I don't want to change movements every eight counts. I like settling into Caban's cardio routine and I like that the exercises repeat movements but reduce counts, so that the rapid changes keep up the pace.

Having the pilates segment before the cardio works great as well. If the cardio were first, I would be too exhausted to do the pilates properly. For me the pilates functions as a nice body toning warm-up to the cardio. (I do think a little ""Pilates Principles"" preamble could have been useful for the masses)

As for the length of the segments, the whole thing adds up to just over 48 minutes. Taking into account the brief introduction, I'd estimate the pilates at less than 30 minutes and the cardio at a little less than 20 minutes.

Someone suggested the New York City Ballet workouts. On that suggestion (and after a little research) I've ordered two of those DVDs and I expect that, once I've built up adequate strength and stamina with Ana Caban's Cardio Pilates workout, I'll be ready to take on the NYCB. But for now I'm more than happy to pop Cardio Pilates into the DVD player at 6 a.m. every morning.

(Side note: I do have to say, Caban's ever-present smile started getting on my nerves fast. It looked as though she'd had an electric shock and her face froze in that position.)",1170547200,3,2199,4.3463414634146345
1991982,4,B0001DHSFG,"Even though I own about 8 pilates videos, this is the one I work out to most frequently. Ana Caban does a good job of keeping the pace up and creating a series of exercises that remains challenging over time. It is also easy to modify some of the content to suit ones needs while still easily following the format. However, the aerobics portion of this video is very weak. I usually skip it in favour of a workout at the gym. It is boring, repetitive and of low intensity.

Despite the fact that the aerobics portion is not useful it is worth owning this video for the excellent and well thought out pilates workout.",1169251200,,616,4.356521739130435

The pilates segment is decent and purposeful, but the cardio is dull and repetitive and a far cry from challenging. As another review already states, you do the same few rounds of cardio moves over and over. While repetitiveness works for some, it doesn't for most. I personally had a very difficult time getting through this whole workout..I just didn't find that I was benefiting from it.

Plus, I just couldn't decide what was more annoying, the music or the instructor's perky grin as she bounced around rather stupidly to the music.

If you want pilates, I'd recommend Denise Austin's ""Pilates for Every Body"" or ""Hit the Spot Pilates"" or either of the New York City Ballet workouts.",1165017600,7,794,4.746376811594203

I have done the Winsor Pilates DVDs and I didn't find this one too challenging, there weren't enough repetitions for me to feel the burn.  The cardio section did get me sweating, but it was so repetative.

I definitely bought this DVD hoping for a full pilates rutine, so I was a bit dissapointed.",1151280000,5,568,4.4326923076923075
1991985,3,B0001DHSFG,"I consider myself a strong intermediate pilates student, and thought the pilates portion of this video to be pretty standard. There is minimal instruction on form and technique (although she does throw in reminders from time to time), so it would not be a good choice for a beginner.  Ana keeps the exercises flowing, which I appreciated, but at times I would preferred a few more reps.

The cardio portion, however, was not so great.  For anyone even the slightest bit beyond very beginner, it is nothing more than a warm up.  Unforunately it comes at the end of the video!  This is not a fusion of cardio and pilates, but rather two separate sections.  The cardio follows the pilates, and actually, I would've preferred it to come before the pilates.  (If I were keeping the video - it's going back to the library - I would definitely do the cardio first.)  As one reviewer mentioned, it is very repetitious (in fact I developed a pain at the back of each shoulder from the repetitive arm work) and not strenuous.  Ana seems sweet enough, and her pilates form looks great, but she apparently can't keep the beat (or she wasn't listening to the same music as is on the soundtrack).  I had a hard time staying in sync with her, mostly when she was marching in place.  She also was off count at times, saying we'd do 8 reps but then would only do 4.

Overall, if you've got some pilates experience and want the cardio more to get the blood and breath flowing rather than give you a great w/o, give it a try.  It's not a bad workout, just nothing I'm interested in keeping.

I'm very flexible but not particularly coordinated.  The cardio part got my heart rate up without making me feel like I couldn't keep up with the odd workouts that some videos put you through.  I read some of the other reviews and if you are in great shape and very coordinated, you probably need something more advanced but if you are excercising because you have to and need to but dreading the insanity that comes with some videos, give it a try!

1991987,1,B0001DHSFG,"I have to get this off my chest. I can't go on hating the fact that I bought this tape and then not share my complaints with other potential buyers! So fans of this tape, brace yourself. I'm about to be brutally honest.

First of all, you've got the pilates. Here's the interesting thing about pilates. It's great when you know what you're doing, but when you're not as strong and experienced as the instructor, Ana Caban, you're basically spending most of this video sitting on your mat feeling bad about yourself. If you've done pilates extensively and already are capable of doing the positions without killing your neck and spine, then maybe you don't even need this tape. For everyone else, keep shopping for a video that'll teach you proper form and give you some strengthening exercises to work your way up to Ana Caban's level.

Now onto the cardio portion, which is the biggest joke of all. First of all, you've got music that suddenly shifts in weird places and throws you off balance. The cameraman also was having a bit too much fun and the swooping crane shots are enough to make you queasy, if not hinder your ability to see what Ana Caban is doing. Then again, does it really matter what she's doing? After all, you spend 20 minutes doing essentially four moves. You march in place, you lift one leg up behind you, you reach for the sky and you reach across your body. Over and over, you just keep doing that. Yes, there's an occasional break where you do some hard to keep up with lunges and 8 jumping jacks, hooray. Then at the end Ana Caban flaunts her ability to lift her leg above her waist for long periods of time, while you the viewer are feeling bad about yourself again. Then that's it. I didn't break a sweat at all and essentially had to take the workout at a double pace while adding my own modifications to get my heart rate going.

So, in a nutshell, this is a video you would buy if you wanted to watch Ana Caban work out. This is not a video for any beginner or intermediate that wants to learn how to do pilates or get a good cardio workout.

What's worse, the instructor has a terribly artificial clenched-tooth smile plastered to her face for the duration.  ""Pilates for Dummies"" is a far better instructional video for newcomers to the world of pilates (do a series of jumping jacks or go for a run afterwards to get in your cardio).

Well, if you're looking for personality, Ana doesn't give you that.  Not pertaining to this DVD in particular, but Ana is all about BUSINESS!

If you want ""personality"" with minimal results, get Denise Austin.

But if you're looking for REAL RESULTS, get ANA CABAN!  Okay, she might not display any real ""personality"" in her videos, but dammit, she gets the job done!  FLAT ABS!

Forget ""personality"".  Watch reruns of Good Times on TVLand if you want ""personality""!  I want FLAT ABS!

Ana is the best I've seen thus far!  I will admit I was not enthused with the redundancy of the Cardio video, but once I tried it and got into the swing, I actually enjoyed it.  It got my heart rate up, toned my arms and it was 100% MINDLESS!  LOL!  :)

Who can ask for more?  Heehee!  Get her Total Abs Workout, too.  It's not for beginners, however.  I still sweat from it and I've been doing Pilates for almost a year.

Great instructor... minus the ""personality"" *snore*",1122422400,12,1091,4.578125
1991990,4,B0001DHSFG,I rarely actually do the cardio part. I find that I get enough workout doing the first 40 minutes of pilates alone. I really like that part so as a pilates DVD I would have to say it is really good but if you want to do cardio stuff it's probably not for you.,1120953600,3,259,3.814814814814815
1991991,2,B0001DHSFG,"I was very excited to try this DVD.  I do a routine of classic pilates and cardio, so I thought this would be a good DVD to add to the collection.  The opening 30 mins is classic pilates, but done very slowly, with no real instruction or tips or modifications to keep yourself safe (such as not to let your back come off the mat, or bend your knees if you can't stretch that far, etc) and moves too advanced for beginners (I don't know too many beginners who can master the teaser on the 1st try).  Also, it's not a full pilates routine, just the exercises she likes.

The ""cardio"" segment is too short (18 mins) and very repetetive.  She also does not keep time with the music, doesn't tell you how many to do of each exercise and gives no real instruction on how to do the moves.  Watching her march is also very annoying, I don't know anyone who looks like that when they march.  Another annoying thing is the fact that she constantly says ""belly"" instead of ""abs"" or ""abdominals"", also ""tush"" instead of ""buns"" or ""butt"" or ""buttocks"".  Just a personal preference, but it annoyed me.  I'm glad I just rented this and did not waste money on a purchase.",1119312000,3,1155,4.334883720930232
1991992,5,B0001DHSFG,"I have 5 different kind of Pilate DVD. Cardio Pilates is my favorite, because it's concentrated on abs, balance and posture very well. I feel really warmed up and my heart are pumping and I feel like I done some cardio excercise. My abs are flatter than used to be. I love this DVD.",1115251200,3,282,4.2407407407407405

8010752,5,B0001DHSFG,"Great lighter workout!
Pros: Easy for beginners and for light workouts for more advanced. Also gets your heart 'pumping' after some pilates moves.
Cons: could be a little more difficult.
I'd recommend this to a friend.",1400284800,,218,5.083333333333333
8010753,5,B0001DHSFG,"I love this video, this is my second copy because I wore out the first one.  Anytime I gain weight I can count on Ana Caban to get me back into a good body.",1396915200,,156,3.588235294117647
8010754,3,B0001DHSFG,"I have 2 other Ana Caban Pilates videos - beginning and intermediate - and decided to see what else she has put out.  I like a lot of variety in my workout, but I'm also super picky about the instructor.  I hate fake smiles, or fake body parts, and intrusive music.  When I find an instructor I can tolerate, I tend to stick with her.

The Pilates part of this video is on par with the intermediate workout, almost exactly the same with some minor variations on the exercises.

The cardio portion was entirely uninspired and uninteresting.  Even Ana seems bored as she plasters on a fake smile during it.  The music is repetitive and dull.  If you are looking for a high energy workout, this isn't it.  If you are looking for a Pilates workout, get the intermediate mat workout.",1389052800,2,778,4.460992907801418

8010756,5,B0001DHSFG,"I've done Pilates before, but I'm getting back into it. This is a great workout video, and I love the combination of Pilates and cardio. I'm a runner, so I'm a huge lover of cardio activities, and this workout increased my heart rate. I'm all about results, and I'm seeing results (within a few days). If you want results too, I suggest you use this video as part of your fitness routine.",1312329600,2,388,4.402777777777778
8010757,4,B0001DHSFG,I thought the pilates segment was great and really noticed a difference in my body after a few weeks. The only things that bothered me was the cardio segment. The instructor is off tempo most of the time and doesn't cue enough.,1311897600,,227,4.428571428571429
8010758,3,B0001DHSFG,"The pilates section is great.  It offers a good variety of workouts and it's intermediate.
The cardio section is pretty terrible.  It just was SO repetitive and boring and EASY!
Buy it only for the pilates.  If you are a beginner at cardio, the second section may work for you, just be prepared to get bored!",1309305600,2,308,4.464285714285714
