4713049,4,B005JL2Q8E,"Written after doing the dvd once through:

I would not rate this an essential for a yoga dvd collection. It rates as a nice-to-have. The pose transitions are interesting and creative without straying so far that it feels like yoga-fusion rather than purist yoga. The routine feels fresh compared to the typical vinyasa/power yoga dvd format of sun salutations followed by the same standard poses. The production values are good. The teacher D'Silva is very competent (although this is called Trudie Styler's warrior yoga, it is led by D'Silva and Trudie follows along). Trudie's form is like that of a committed but not perfectionist yoga student (by no means is she an expert and she does not present herself as one). D'Silva's is excellent. D'Silva is very graceful and Trudie does not lack in grace either.

Some of D'Silva's cueing on form is very good, but he does not cue consistently. If you have some yoga background, this should not be an issue. The workout does not demand an advanced level of flexibility (it can be modified easily enough even if you aren't as limber as D'Silva) nor an advanced level of endurance. It is a good practise for those familiar with yoga who are still developing proficiency, as well as more experienced yoga practitioners who like lighter yoga days to complement their more advanced sessions.

I was looking forward to the music soundtrack on this dvd. It would have been interesting to see Sting's more popular work ""yoga-ized"". I was disappointed. The music to me was mainly unobtrusive. If ""message in a bottle"" is on the sound track like the cover claims, I did not even notice!

I did not do the meditations. I found the practice focused on yoga as exercise with minimal mind-body-spiritual talk-track.",1259366400,7,1748,4.875420875420875
4713050,4,B005JL2Q8E,"True it's not all that challenging, but gentle flow of the poses is very relaxing. It's going to be one of my favorites to use when I want a restorative session.",1257638400,9,161,4.225806451612903
4713051,5,B005JL2Q8E,"I love this DVD! I am an intermediate yoga practitioner for over 15 years. My favorite DVD's are Rodney Yee for energy, Ali McGraw yoga mind and body, and Shiva Rea yoga shakti. Add this to my favorite list!

This is not a power work out, but it is challenging. It has a lot of ""flow"" and is very spiritual. It is very different than just doing ""the same old sun salutation"". I felt like I stretched areas and used muscles that I do not normally use. I can really get lost in the spiritual flow of this workout. There is a quality to Trudie and James that draws you into the workout. I like both the mediations included. I haven't done the 25 min workout yet.

I have already pre-ordered their next two DVD's due out in Dec. Also just purchases Sting's new DVD.",1257033600,35,761,4.241379310344827
4713052,3,B005JL2Q8E,"Ok, so I did this dvd this morning and all I can say is ""interesting"".  This dvd is not your typical vinysa yoga class.  It isn't challenging but you do get a good stretch without breaking much of a sweat, at least I didn't.

Trudie and her  yoga, pilates, dance teacher lead the class outside in lush surroundings.  The dvd has an unusual flow in that everything is done on one side (about 24 minutes) and then repeated on the second side.  I felt like I had hit repeat segment on my dvd player.  The sequence is as follows (might have missed some but basically this is it):
- tadasana to chair, reach out palms and fall forward to standing forward bend; rise to tadasana. Repeat 3x
- child's pose to snake thru to cobra to camel with hands on ankles or floor behind you.  Repeat 2x
- cobra to one handed camel. Sweep around to other side and repeat 2x.
- Down dog to one legged split. alternate legs. Repeat 2x.
- one legged split to pigeon.
- Down dog to warrior variation to wide angle pose variations.
- down dog to triangle to extended side angle. 2x
- runners pose (knee on ground) to warrior pose variation to pyramid pose 2x
- standing one legged split to almost seated twist. 3x
- seated twist. one legged twist. bound forward bend. one legged forward bend. wide legged forward bend.
- hands underneath legs holding feet butterly. holding big toes, wide legs in air butterfly.
- plank to downdog to standing to tree.
- Repeat entire sequence on second side.

There is no savasana.  No inversions.  No backbends except moving camel. No abs. The focus is on the hips and by the time you repeat to the other side, your hips really open up.

The class just ends with a standing centering instruction and then the credits start rolling.

What I liked: The class has a nice dance like feel to it.  All the poses flow together. This is a good class for beginners to advanced beginners.  It is being sold as intermediate class.  The only thing challenging is that you need flexibility in your hips.  Otherwise all of the poses are doable.  With the camel sequence, I put blocks by my feet to rest my hands on.  I would use this class on days when I just want to stretch and not work too hard.  I think it would be a great class for those 50 or older.  Younger yogis may not be challenged enough. The teacher, in voiceover, has a very nice, soothing voice with precise instruction.

What I didn't like:  The camera angles annoyed me in that I couldn't see all of Trudie's body.  The camera focused on the top half of her body.  Some poses make you face away from the screen and since I didn't know the sequence that well, I had to adjust my feet to see the screen. The class was too simplistic for me.  It had great potential but for me it fell short.  She could have included more poses, however, as I said earlier this is a class when you just want to stretch and not work hard.  Also when the class ends it should go back to the menu instead of rolling credits. The menu has 2 meditations and bonus material which I haven't viewed.  Lastly, the introduction is part of the class and should have been separate. As such you have to fast forward to beginning of the class.

There are two classes, 50 minutes and 20 minutes.  The express class leaves out the camel and doesn't repeat the poses.  It is the same as the 50 minute class but shorter.

All in all I think is was a good first attempt at a yoga dvd.  I only gave it 3 stars because I just don't know what the shelf life will be for me before I give it away.  I could do everything without much effort.  Nothing to grow into.

UPDATE: I just did this dvd again for the 2nd time.  This time I knew the routine and was able to enjoy it more with the pretty guitar music.  I also did both meditations.  One by Trudie and and one by yoga teacher D'Silva.  They were a bit talky, but otherwise relaxing.",1256256000,89,3857,4.2720994475138125
4713053,5,B005JL2Q8E,"I have been doing this dvd for well over a year now and have gone from barely able to do the 25 minute short version, to enjoying the 50 minute version 3 - 4 times a week.  This dvd has now prepared me for more advanced dvds which I am thrilled about (I'll be 61 next month).  I still find it challenging and engaging and do not tire of the instructor's voice or the sequence of movements.  My only complaint is that there are two small errors in the program....at one point James says 'left leg' when it should be right leg and at another point, inhale, when it is obvious it would be an exhale.  Minor issues and you figure it out pretty quickly but it can throw you off when you are first starting.

It's rare for me to find something I can stick with for this long and not either grow tired or, or annoyed by.  The beautiful music and scenery compliment a well thought out yoga flow routine.",1447113600,,895,4.174418604651163

Once you get the hang of it you're really able to just relax and let yourself go into the poses very naturally while feeling muscles you never knew you had! Definitely got me in the best shape of my life and gave me a great ""yoga body"". Also his voice is vert soothing to listen to which is a big thing for me.

4713064,2,B005JL2Q8E,I love yoga because of its relaxing effect. I did not find this video to be relaxing at all. The moves went too fast and a lot of the poses were difficult. I paid a very cheap price for it and I am glad about that. I don't recommend paying anything more than $1 for this dvd.,1408492800,,275,3.8421052631578947

4713067,3,B005JL2Q8E,It just didn't do much for me as a yoga work-out..I did it once and wasn't interested in doing it again.,1397779200,,104,4.0
4713068,4,B005JL2Q8E,It is easy to follow. The different workouts can be used by a majority of people. I am really impressed with the chair  workouts.,1394841600,,129,4.375

4713070,1,B005JL2Q8E,"The verbal cues are not clear, and if you try to follow by watching the instructor and Trudy Styler, you will end up on the wrong leg or side. The entire practice is done on one side and then again on the other instead of alternating with each pose. I tried to adjust and got totally confused. Getting frustrated defeats the whole purpose of doing yoga. I threw this DVD in the trash.",1392076800,,384,4.273972602739726

4713072,1,B005JL2Q8E,"It is for people who are already very advanced or are instructors. I can't believe it gets 4 stars.  There is amazing yoga, but for those who have average yoga skills, it is too difficult. If you are a beginner, do not do this video because you will become discourage, and that is not what yoga is about.",1389052800,4,304,4.241379310344827
4713073,5,B005JL2Q8E,"This is a great yoga flow workout!  Trudie Styler has two workouts: a 25 minute one and a 45 minute one.  This is great because you can do the short one when you are pressed for time--I like to do it in the morning before going to work.  The music is gentle acoustic guitar background music that is not overpowering.  The yoga is done in Sting's Tuscan villa garden which is very nice.  Trudie Styler doesn't say a word.  Instead her yoga guru does all the talking as the two of them do the yoga flow.  I would say the workout is at an intermediate level.  There was only one pose that I couldn't do: the Binding Pose (Marichi Asana).  I could not bend as far as the two of them in some poses, but I just went as far as I could.",1388793600,3,728,4.034965034965035

4713075,5,B005JL2Q8E,"Nice balance of physically challenging and spiritually centering!  I think a lot of people forget that the purpose of yoga is not just to provide a vigorous physical workout, but to unite mind, body & spirit.  Trudie Styler and James D'Silva do that beautifully here.  James' gentle instruction and Sting's acoustic guitar add to the serenity.  Il Palagio provides a visually soothing backdrop.  Some have said this workout is repetitive.  Basically it is a 25 min workout that is done twice - once on each side.  I don't mind that b/c repeating the poses allows me to spend time perfecting them.  How does one ever develop skill in the poses if you don't spend time in them?  I consider myself an intermediate level yoga enthusiast and I feel invigorated yet serene and centered when I finish this workout.  Highly recommend!",1386288000,,826,4.835714285714285
4713076,4,B005JL2Q8E,Trudie has a nice style and easy approach. It is a good yoga dvd for a change of pace. I really enjoy this dvd.,1379289600,,111,3.6666666666666665
4713077,3,B005JL2Q8E,"At first I thought it was an animated yoga video- it looked a little fake. Overall, it was good yoga but I didn't really like that the instructor doesn't talk to you (there is a voice-over).",1373673600,,190,4.305555555555555
4713078,1,B005JL2Q8E,"I found the workout to be unrealistic, dangerous, and difficult, as aesthetically pleasing as it may have been. There were two people doing the poses, and while they occasionally suggested ways to adapt the poses for those with lower flexibility, they never actually showed anyone doing the adaptations. Also, they didn't mention how to position your feet or hips when switching poses enough, while the positioning of the feet and hips is what facilitates balance and prevents injury. Every time I have used this video, I have gotten injured.

Also, too much additional materials on the DVD aren't related to the practice of yoga. There's a lot about Sting, a lot about their beautiful Tuscan villa and the need to preserve the surrounding countryside, but not much about yoga. Except for a few vague, new-agey sounding interviews and meditations, of course. Honestly, the DVD would have been better off without any of the additional materials.

I really like Sting. I have a lot of his music. But I just don't like this workout video.",1372464000,4,1035,4.942528735632184
4713079,5,B005JL2Q8E,I love all of Trudie Styler's videos!  You will feel great and energized after using her videos.  I haven't felt this great since my 30's.,1364428800,,138,4.48
4713080,5,B005JL2Q8E,Like the other Trudie yoga video--Great work out video.  I use it almost daily and find it helps me stay in shape.  Would definately buy it again.,1361750400,,146,4.37037037037037
4713081,5,B005JL2Q8E,"Trudie Styler's Warrior Yoga has everything I want in a yoga routine.  The workout is calming, strengthening, and thorough.  The routine is perfectly symetrical so EVERY move is the same on both sides of the body.  James D'Silva is always encouraging and keeps your attention on you and your body for that day.  It's also really nice to have a 25 and 50 minute option.  LOVE this workout!",1357084800,,388,4.647058823529412
4713082,2,B005JL2Q8E,"I love the Gaiam yoga dvds, and I love Sting & Trudie, so I was excited to find this dvd.  I admit that I am disappointed in it.  I did not realize that Trudie doesn't do the instruction.  It's led by her teacher, who I'm sorry to say has the personality of a ball of lint.  Trudie doesn't speak, so I'm wondering why she's even in the dvd?  Good publicity for Gaiam, I suppose.  I was quite bored by this dvd and I'm glad I only borrowed it from the library.  Two positives:  the music and the scenery are beautiful.  If you are looking for great yoga dvds, I recommend any of the Rodney Yee ones.  He's excellent.",1354579200,3,615,4.135593220338983

I have a hard time finding ones that I like, that move at the slower more meditative pace I like, but this is the one!  I like that James talks you through each move.  I like that he reminds me to breathe, cause frankly, if he didn't, I would forget and hold my breath.  I've practiced yoga on and off for 10 years and needed something for home use when I don't have time to go to my favorite class at the Y.

Pleasant,friendly and polite. I like that. Scenery is lovely, not overstated, not boring. Trudie Styler looks like a real woman doing the poses, not a model. I like that also. For me this is a keeper.",1325289600,3,352,4.348484848484849
4713087,4,B005JL2Q8E,"Okay I found this on sell at target one day and bought it along with a yoga mat.

I performed it two to three times a week depending on how busy I was. I must say after doing it; I felt refreshed and strong.

The real trick with this is to do it weekly. This is not a one and done type of practice. Each time you do it you will feel the effects of it.

I would consider myself to be an intermediate yoga follower at this point. I now spend a lot of my time doing cardio like dancing and swimming.

Though I would consider trying this again with another one of her many dvds in the future.

I did also purchase the pilates dvd from her and I liked it as well.

I recommend this for anyone wanting to get a crash course in how to begin yoga. It will really give a good overall view on how to get started.",1317945600,,802,3.8597560975609757

I would have rated this dvd 5 stars, but for the fact that Trudy and her instructor turn their backs to the camera, which means the watcher does as well.

I knew before I tried it that they worked through one side of the body and then repeated on the other side, so wasn't surprised by that.  I also knew from others that this was more of a stretching type yoga practice as opposed to a strength type practice and was very pleased to find it met my expectations there.

After they completed the second side, I felt nicely stretched out, especially in my hips.  I did parts of the practice with my eyes closed and just enjoyed it - I liked his voice as he guided through the poses. When I was finished, I felt relaxed, restored and stretched.

The only complaint I had was that it would have been nice if he had reminded us what side we were working because at one point I actually wasn't sure - somehow got confused.  But I watched them and figured it out.

This DVD was nice for winding down the week.  I wasn't expecting any fancy poses but just a nice relaxing yoga practice.",1298592000,3,1004,4.247368421052632
4713093,4,B005JL2Q8E,"Thank you to Beth Cholette, YogaGirl & J Bug for your detailed reviews that tells you the content & poses this dvd contains.
I can only add my opinion that I found the 50 min practice to be fluid in how each pose is connected, intuitive to what pose should come next to maximize flexibility that feels right to the body, relaxing with James D'Silva's voice over, but repetitive. He would have you go in/out of the a couple of chained poses several times, then move on to another set, then repeat those poses again & sometimes even a third time. Though some repeating is good to open up the body, my boredom limit is usually 3x on any single pose or chained set (I rather hold a pose or go slow in/out then go in/out fast like aerobics).
I felt instead of repeating so much, there could have been other poses done such as inversions as others have said, etc. to make it even more complete, such as a shoulder stand, boat, bow, half moon, reclined twisting poses, etc.
It's still relaxing & fluid & look forward to more yoga from James D'Silva.",1289001600,4,1042,4.376288659793815

Warrior Yoga features Trudie Styler, wife of the musician Sting, in a workout led by trainer James D'Silva.  It is set outdoors to music provided by Sting.  The Main Menu of the DVD offers the following options:  Full 50 Minute Practice - Express 25 Minute Practice - Trudie Styler Meditation - James D'Silva Meditation - Bonus Materials.  The yoga routines are taught by D'Silva via voiceover, with both the Full 50 Minute Practice and the Express 25 Minute Practice containing the exact same footage (the 25-Minute version eliminates pose repetitions as well as one short series).  A unique aspect of this practice is that you will move through a long progression of poses entirely on one side of the body (about 25 minutes total in the longer practice) before switching to the other side and repeating.

Some of the poses that are included in the posture flows are chair pose, high lunge, pyramid pose, down dog, mini-cobra, cobra, camel variations, crazy dog, pigeon pose, warrior 1, reverse warrior, triangle, side angle, wide-legged standing forward bend series, low lunge, standing splits, seated twist, Sage 3 twist, Sage 3 forward bend, wide-legged seated forward bend, wide-legged seated balance, and tree pose.  Neither the 50-Minute nor the 25-Minute practice includes relaxation posture.  However, either of the two meditation practices can be selected directly from the Main Menu.  Each one is just over 5 minutes in length, with the first showing Styler seated while D'Silva provides voiceover instruction, and the second displaying D'Silva alone with Styler's voice featured.

Overall, this is a beautifully filmed, fluid, graceful yoga practice.  D'Silva's approach to the routine is unique and clearly influenced by his dance background.  The practice is very accessible and should be doable to most with some prior yoga experience.  It is important to note that because D'Silva is constantly moving you one from pose to the next, he spends little time providing form or alignment information.  In addition, he does not suggest modifications for the few more challenging postures which are included (e.g., no alternate is given to binding in Sage 3 pose).  However, for yoga practitioners who have reached at least an advanced beginning level, this DVD provides a lovely, distinctive practice experience.",1265587200,4,2493,5.179551122194514
4713099,4,B005JL2Q8E,"I bought this a few weeks ago and finally got around to trying it out. I really thought it was a great workout. I have dabbled in yoga for years and I felt just great while I was doing it. I do have a some advice though, take the suggestion they give at the beginning and watch it though at least once before actually trying it out. It made a great difference to me. You do the whole routine one one side and then the other, which was a bit odd and a bit of a hill to climb once you get to the second side after you had already done a lot of work, and it seems to end a it abruptly. But over all I enjoyed it and will do it again!",1265068800,2,630,3.708955223880597
4713100,1,B005JL2Q8E,I bought this DVD after seeing Trudie on The Martha Stuart Show.  I was so excited when I got it in the mail yesterday to find only disappointment at it's best.  I did the 50 minute workout and the few yoga moves that were on it were very advanced - I'm not that flexible - I couldn't even do them.  The rest of the DVD was just meditation.  The camera angles were very hard to see a lot of the poses to even do.  Don't waste your time or money on this horrible yoga DVD!,1265068800,8,471,3.9157894736842107
4713101,5,B005JL2Q8E,I really enjoyed this practice. The moves are different and they flow together seamlessly. Very relaxing scenery and music.  Not power yoga.,1264636800,,140,5.363636363636363
4713102,4,B005JL2Q8E,"I was initially looking forward to this workout and it's not bad I just wish I'd been warned about how it is taught. For some reason instructor James D' Silva teaches the entire 12 or 24 minutes (depending on which workout you choose) from one side, complete with a standing cool down before switching and doing the entire practice again. It feels like the DVD players jumped and started again (I actually checked it) because although only a few of the exercises actually require doing the other leg/side the entire session is repeated pose for pose. I think most of you will find (like me) that after a couple of times through WARRIOR YOGA it's really hard to stay motivated and not look for an excuse to stop after the first side has been completed.

The DVD contains 2 workouts; the 50 min WARRIOR workout or the 25 min EXPRESS workout. They are both exactly the same except in the Express you won't do any repeats or the Camel section. James D'Silva instructs while Trudie Styler follows in an outdoor garden setting at Trudie and Stings Tuscan villa. On the plus side I enjoyed Mr D' Silva's instruction, his cuing is fluid, calming and precise although because of the way it's taught I needed more reminders about which leg to move foreword or back and found myself unintentionally switching legs.

I would rate this at an intermediate-beginner's level; all the poses are quite basic with a smooth flowing, dancey feel to them. You also get sting's music on the menu page, 2 guided mediations and a bonus section including interviews with James, Sting and Trudie plus the making of Sting's album If On A Winters Night.

Some of the poses used are; Forward bend to Chair then Warrior reaching. Cobra, Camel, Down dog to one legged split. Pigeon, Triangle, Warrior2, Standing one legged split, Seated twist, Bound foreword bend, Butterfly, Plank, Standing centering as cool down then repeat entire sequence on second side.

8475877,5,B005JL2Q8E,"I used to do this on Gaiam years ago and absolutely loved it.  With recent health conditions, I wanted to go back to challenging myself to increase my strength and flexibility with more advanced yoga, and the first thing I thought of was this video.  Gaiam.com no longer carries it, so I was very excited to find it here.  This is a very challenging yoga sequence, but it's by no means advanced, nor is it one of those that feels like you should know how to do this already or is somehow condescending.  It's just a peaceful cadence of instructions that doesn't have to fight with the music, lots of modifications you can use as needed, and a flow sequence that feels like it makes sense to your body.  I am so glad to get back on track with this DVD.",1520985600,,751,4.297872340425532
