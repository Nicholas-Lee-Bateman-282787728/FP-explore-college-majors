4077822,5,B0036K9CIW,"I've been using David Dorian-Ross's workout with very good results, now I can have his AM Chi and several other excellent sessions all on one DVD. This is a great source of material for the new student, easy to follow and easy to learn. I've had a few other GIAM products and have been very happy with their quality. The DVD has great scores, beautiful location shots and great information.
I've seen some very amateur productions in the past, this is not one of them, you can use this every day and never grow tired of it.",1300579200,56,523,4.402061855670103
4077823,3,B0036K9CIW,"Nice, well produced video.  But I find it a bit lacking from an instructional standpoint.  For example, the instructor doesn't explain the breathing until you've been doing a move several times.",1298419200,13,194,5.225806451612903
4077824,4,B0036K9CIW,I am a beginner with Tai Chi. The verbal instructions as well as the movements of the models are easier to follow along with than other Tai Chi videos I have tried in the past. The music and setting add to the sense of calm. There is variety with five different workouts available.  I enjoy these peaceful workouts and find the short sessions to be a refreshing break in my day.,1296864000,19,378,4.323943661971831

I have been practicing a version of Qi Gong for sometime now, and enjoy that very much. There are pieces to the different exercises that I like, but I found many of them are more time consuming that I want at this time. I will keep the video, and in the future, will view again and hopefully start practicing. If you are limited for time, but want a video that offers easy, flowing movements (which this video does), I would look elsewhere first. Then try this.",1428192000,,576,4.342592592592593

4077845,3,B0036K9CIW,"David Dorian Ross deserves 10 star for his exceptional instruction technique.  He mirrors the movements so you can easily follow his movements.  Daisy is very good also, but does not mirror the steps making it difficult to follow her otherwise clear instructions.

Francesco and McPhee I find more annoying than relaxing.  McPhee's voice grates the nerves.  Francesco's technique is awkward  & much less polished than Daisy's.

Such a shame GAIAM did not use only David Dorian Ross and Daisy.

Still worth the purchase as there are 5 routines to choose from.",1424476800,,558,5.054945054945055

I've tried learning and practicing Tai Chi before, but I always had a really hard time with it, and could not catch on. The first time I did a workout in class to this video I fell in love. I am a level 1 Reiki master, and so I am use to how chi feels, and I can feel it coursing through my body when I do a workout from this video. I'm so excited to have it in my home, to practice every morning and night if I want. :) This is easy to follow, and you can really feel it work if you open yourself up to it.",1408838400,2,665,3.79136690647482

4077865,2,B0036K9CIW,"I am just beginning a Qigong practice and this DVD was recommended to me. I think overall it's quite well done but in some respects it could have been better.

The PM segment is poorly filmed with too many distant shots and reflections from the water and sun which are very distracting at times. I also thought the music was a bit loud in all the segments, in relation to the voice overs/narration.

On the plus side, the settings for all of these segments are SO beautiful. The movements are relatively very easy to follow, except for when they are specific to one side and then the other, and you have to adjust for that when doing them with the instructors facing you. On the Energy segment, the instructor does compensate for this with the reverse directions so that they are done as you see them.

 I think this is a good starting point for my practice but I will probably look for more DVDs for this type of exercise, in the near future.

PS: After trying these routines a couple of times I am now downgrading my rating to 2 stars instead of 3. Very hard to follow when not seeing a ""mirror image"" when doing side-specific exercises. If the instructors had only taken the time to do these with the instructions reversed so they could be followed as seen on the TV screen, not trying to remember throughout to change sides to opposite, it would have been so much better. The only exercise dvds that I've tried that do show a mirror image are for the Jane Fonda Prime Time Series and that is so helpful. One of my fav exercise dvd series' albeit for a different type of exercise.",1405036800,4,1583,4.407534246575342
4077866,4,B0036K9CIW,Loved IT,1404518400,,8,3.5
4077867,4,B0036K9CIW,"This is a useful series of workouts. I say that with the context of several books, about 5 years of practice and several other DVDs and teachers. Qi is a subtle thing. Different workouts do different things for different people.
David Dorian-Ross's last workout on this DVD is noteworthy. Lots of wide open 'windmill' arm movements which help open channels and circulate qi and have a clearing effect thats hard to put into words. Feels psychologically freeing, opening and positive as a body meditation.
He combines it with good, deep stances for both legs which is where the power and raw qi comes from. Along with consistent focus on twists which are said to wring stagnant qi out of the torso and spine. Its a well thought out workout and is only about 20 mins long. So accomplishes a lot in limited time.
The other workouts are solid for destressing and getting rid of negative energy. The other teachers are solid and clearly have studied and experienced the power of tai qi over many years. Each workout has moves which are useful. If not daily, as a weekly workout to mix things up. Or to give you ideas for mixing and matching to make your own workout. One caution: don't do the 'am' or energy workouts too late in the day, it'll interupt your sleep. Tai qi is deceptively seen as a relaxing/calming workout. When done right, the slow deep stance movements generate an intense amount of energy.",1397001600,4,1403,4.661290322580645

4077870,4,B0036K9CIW,I was a Tai-Chi student in a martial arts school for over a year.  This video applies many of the same moves and principles with a feel more for wellness and health than the competitive nature of most schools.  It seems more in line with the purpose and meaning of traditional martial arts.,1396483200,,290,4.452830188679245
4077871,5,B0036K9CIW,"I have experienced wonderful benefits from Tai Chi.  This DVD offers 5 types of Tai Chi practice.  I especially like the energizing and cleansing lessons so far.  I haven't tried two of the five yet. The DVD back cover gives  a brief explanation of what each exercise section is suppose to accomplish. I would like to have known if it was best  to do one each day for five days, or if it's better to do more than one a day, etc. One day I practiced the energy and detox in the same day.  I accomplished so much, I couldn't believe it.  I feel great after doing the Tai Chi.  Also, you can experience the benefits when you do the exercises indoors as well as outdoors.

4077876,5,B0036K9CIW,"I purchased this because I already had Francesco Garripoli's ""Qi Gong for Stress Relief"" and ""Qi Gong for Cleansing"" on separate DVDs.  I had to send a computer to the shop for repair and failed to remove the ""Qi Gong for Cleansing"" DVD, called the shop, they said they didn't have it so I thought it was gone.  I ordered this as a replacement for that DVD because the one I was trying to replace was out of stock at the time.  Sometimes, things were to the good though.. because I got 5 routines .. all of them easy to follow, filmed at beautiful locations, with great audio and visual.  And best of all.. it was less than the one DVD I was trying to replace.  As with all Gaiam productions, I was well pleased.",1392336000,,712,4.2444444444444445
4077877,5,B0036K9CIW,"$100 of bulky VHSs ( 5 tapes at $20/ea) are now encapsulated in this one $8 DVD.  I don't generally allow myself to hoard or stockpile, but I'm buying a spare (and donating the VHSs to charity).

Oddly, in the re-packaging, AM & PM programs (but not the Energy) were renamed ""T'ai Chi"" when, in fact, they are qigong (also spelled chi kung).

AM, PM, and Energy are filmed at a Maui ocean (during morning, evening, and afternoon respectively).
Stress is at a white-wooded forest.
Detox (also called Cleansing) at a meadow amongst (pine?) trees on a mountain.

The programs include a great variety of teacher & exercise, nice music, beautiful scenery, good instruction, and programs that suit Absolute Beginner (PM) to Advanced Beginner (Energy).

If you'd like a great qigong/ chi kung sampler pack, this is an EXCELLENT place to start.  If you don't like ANY of these, know you gave it a fair go & should look elsewhere.

When I do qigong a few days in a row, I find that the slow, simple movements (often accompanied by suggestions to notice this or that) lead me to have better posture, greater flexibility, more ease of movement, and feel more calm in my daily life.",1391472000,6,1170,4.650485436893204

In reviewing the contents I have to admit the exercises seemed beneficial, easy to follow instructions and a pleasant ambiance. It strikes me this particular work out video would be really good for someone who hasn't done a lot of exercises and/or has a physical limitation or simply wants an introduction into this type of exercise.

4077884,5,B0036K9CIW,"My husband and I do this at home and I have to say that we saw results the first week.  We only do the AM and Energy Tai Chi videos and that takes about 46 minutes. We do these in the same time period and at least 4-5 times a week. You can do just one and than another later on in the day. Now that may sound like a long time but it just seems to fly by!  Our balance has really improved and my knees have quit hurting.  My husband was shuffling and he is not anymore!  He also was bending forward slightly and his posture has improved.  It really seems impossible that something that is fun and soothing can makes such quick changes to our bodies. We do these side by side and it is surprising that we are watching the same video at the same time and yet we each interpret the moves a little differently.

There are other Tai Chi  selections on this DVD but we have found that the above mentioned Am and Energy are just right for us.

4077887,4,B0036K9CIW,"This DVD has two videos by the Garipali's on stress relief and detox (organ cleansing). It turns out that I had these from separate videos I purchased at the Garipoli web site.

There are also two videos by David Dorian Ross (AM Chi and Energy Chi) and one video by CJ McPhee (PM Chi).

I found these videos to be good but they could be a lot better for the way I would use them.

The way my wife and I use videos such as these is to learn, practice, and follow along standing in front of our large screen TV.

The practices are fine. The Garipoli's are elegant, like dancers, and their videos, especially the organ cleansing one, are beautifully choreographed and each movement flows effortlessly into the next.

The only complaint that I have is that none of the five are especially suited for the way we use them.

The Ross and McPhee ones are done in Hawaii and have good exercises that are probably more Tai Chi but they are close enough to the older Qigong to be beneficial to us.

The McPhee one is the least good followed by the Ross ones and the Garipoli ones.

the audio on the McPhee video, especially, does a poor job of explaing the practice. The audio is often out of sync with the action, transitions from one pose to another are not clear, and there is less verbal instruction as to what to do that I am used to. If she were to redo the audio so it is more effective and keep the same video, then it would be 5 stars.

Ross does a little better, and the Garipolis do a little better than that. But the Garipolis spend time with too much talking at the beginning. Once they get going, it is a sight to watch and flow with them.

We have videos from Lee Holden, including ""Qigong For Seniors"" and ""Deeper Flow"". Both are excellent. We also have ""Fire & Water"" from Matthew Cohen and an enigmatic but captivating female companion that are excellent as well.

Lee Holden is especially good. He will tell you the name, tell you how to do it on one move. Maybe on the next move he will tell you how to breath. On the third move, he might tell you what the move does. When the move is about to conclude, Holden says so and makes a good transition to the next move. It is easy to learn this way.

McPhee does not always tell you the name, says less than she should about how to do the move, says less than she should on the breath, and really falls down on the transitions. I often close my eyes or have squinty, soft focus eyes doing the practices. McPhee will transition to another move without a word. You really have to watch her closely.

If you watch her video enough times and close together, I am sure you'd get it eventually. We aim to do Qigong six days a week and to a different video each day for every two weeks. Even weekly, it takes a while, but you can let the lessons sink in this way.

I'd still recommend these videos on the DVD. The Garipolis' video are inspiring.",1383350400,2,2892,4.234545454545454

4077889,5,B0036K9CIW,Well explained in areas of what the movements are doing for you body.  Gentle enough for someone healing from injury/surgery.,1377734400,,125,5.25

4077892,4,B0036K9CIW,I like that David-Dorian Ross and C.J. McPhee use the proper hand (for the person following) even though it's his/her right hand when indicating our left. The other two on the video were difficult to follow. Everyone should think about the person who will be standing in front of them watching and following their instructions especially in T'ai Chi. It's really appreciated.,1371513600,,375,5.064516129032258

4077894,5,B0036K9CIW,"This DVD have excellent breathing exercises included with all the CHI.
I attend a Senior Center Activity Director used my DVD until she oreded her own for the Center.  The exercises are very easy and calming.  I thing everyone should own one of these.",1370304000,,251,4.681818181818182

But the DVD is in excellent shape considering it's been used.",1368489600,2,170,4.7
4077896,5,B0036K9CIW,This DVD has all the exercise you need to start and finish your day. Especially good for seniors. At 71 I use it everyday.,1365379200,,122,4.125
4077897,5,B0036K9CIW,"This DVD has 5 chi workouts, all of which are wonderful stress releasers.  I am so glad GAIAM decided to combine all these previously released workouts onto one DVD.

The five workouts:

AM Tai Chi - 23 minutes
Instructor: David Dorian Ross

PM Tai Chi - 24 minutes
Instructor: CJ McPhee

Qigong Stress Relief - 26 minutes
Instructors: Francesco & Daisy Lee-Garripoli

QiGong Detox - 36 minutes
Instructors: Francesco & Daisy Lee-Garripoli

Energy Chi - 23 minutes
Instructor: David Dorian Ross

The chi workouts are filmed on a beautiful beach in Hawaii and the QiGong workouts are filmed on a Colorado mountainside.  It's beautiful scenery.

Why I love these workouts:

* Even though they are very gentle workouts, I feel so energized after I am done.

* The PM Tai Chi, Qigong Stress Relief and QiGong Detox workouts make me feel so relaxed.  I have a wonderful night's sleep after doing any of these.

* All have just the right balance between instruction and workout flow.  It's hard to find Tai Chi workouts that are true workouts and not just instructional.

* The beautiful scenery is so pleasant to look at and always leaves me feeling very peaceful.

* The soothing voices of all the instructors.  I feel relaxed just listening to them.

* The wonderful Eastern-inspired music really adds to the workout ambiance.

* My shoulders feel so much looser after the workouts.

* My balance has improved with the Rooster and the Holding the Urn poses.

* The variety of workouts. I do these workouts several times a week and don't get tired of them since I do different ones each time.  I love these workouts so much that I usually combine 2 of them for a longer workout.

Some things to note about these workouts:

* The 23 and 24 minute workouts are really only about 20 minutes of exercise time.  The remaining time is the credits at the end.

* The QiGong workouts (Stress Relief and Detox), are not mirror-cued, so it can be a bit confusing until you've done the workouts several times.

These things to note are very minor annoyances and didn't detract from my enjoyment of this DVD.  I highly recommend it to anyone, no matter what fitness level.  These workouts are so good at relieving stress.  The AM ones are also great for a gentle energy boost.",1364169600,57,2260,4.6455696202531644
4077898,4,B0036K9CIW,"For begineers , explain so good is slow and easy to follow I like it
and for sure buy the next dvd , come on time",1362268800,2,113,3.3846153846153846
4077899,5,B0036K9CIW,"This DVD has it all. There is an AM routine for facing the day and a PM routine for just before bedtime. There is also a routine for increasing energy, a fourth routine for relieving stress and a final routine for cleansing the body. I highly recommend Qi Gong and Tai Chi. Their health benefits are not felt immediately, but they will eventually kick in. My only criticism is the two routines hosted by Francesco and Daisy Lee Garripoli. Whereas the other routines allow us to ""mirror"" what we see on the screen, the Garrapoli's instruct us to go to the righ or left and they go to their right or left. The routines are less easy to follow and learn. Other than that this DVD is excellent. I especially recommend the cleansing routine hosted by the Garripoli's.",1360713600,4,762,4.528985507246377
4077900,5,B0036K9CIW,I love that there are different sections for different needs.  I can use the relaxation techniques after a diffucult time and find it very soothing.  I also feel stronger after each workout.,1360540800,,190,4.90625
4077901,2,B0036K9CIW,"I am pretty new to Tai Chi so I have watched only a few intro dvd's so far. I can just say that most other Intro's are more interesting, made me feel better, and made me feel like I got a lot more out of them.  Best person is Christopher Pei, but this fell way way short.",1359936000,2,271,3.754385964912281
4077902,2,B0036K9CIW,Not a program I would use myself or with my students. Easy to follow. Perhaps it would be good for a basic intro.,1359849600,2,113,3.9565217391304346
4077903,1,B0036K9CIW,can't play it on my dvd player or computer. doggy product. Other gaiam products don't seem to work either. Disappointing I spent money on it,1354665600,3,140,4.64
4077904,5,B0036K9CIW,"I have quite a collection of Chi Energy exercise DVD's and use them religiously. I just bought this and it is by far my favorite. It seems there are more beginner Chi dvd's. This one assumes that you have some knowledge, but if you are a beginner, don't be shy to go ahead and try it. It's not an advanced or even an intermediate, it just doesn't go through lengthy explanations of the movements. I like those types too since technique is important in any discipline. But the photography, images, information as to names of movements and their implications as well as, mental imagery in 5 Day Fit Chi is excellent. The music is fitting and soothing. A lot of thought, time and money went into its creation. This deserves five stars. I paid $15.00 at Barnes and Noble so this price is a steal. But no regrets from me as I was in the store and wanted to try it right away. I did and it was worth every penny. I will use this often and expect good results.",1342828800,38,953,4.3
4077905,5,B0036K9CIW,"I was surprised at how easy this DVD was to follow. I needed some activity that would help with exercise but not hurt arthritis. This was just the thing. Gentle but makes you feel good at the same time. Beginners,this is your DVD!",1338595200,6,230,4.372093023255814
4077906,5,B0036K9CIW,I'm really enjoying this video!  I love having multiple workouts on one DVD and also being able to take advantage of the 2 different styles of exercise.  It's also nice having the workouts broken down by specific benefits received so I can do the routine that I feel I need most that day.,1334793600,2,288,4.415094339622642
4077907,5,B0036K9CIW,Contains 5 different workouts that are presented in an easy to follow manner.  Descripes breathing techniques well.  Would highly recommend. Would like to see the addition of an app that could be followed on smart phone.,1334707200,,220,5.083333333333333
4077908,5,B0036K9CIW,"I was looking for quick (under 30 minutes)Tai Chi workout DVD and this is exactly what I wanted. The instruction is clear but not intrusive. The background - a beach and  woods - and the music create a serene mood. There are three Tai Chi sections and two sections are Qigong, which was new to me but very energizing. It is nice to have the variety of workouts to chose from. I would recommend this DVD to both new and experienced Tai Chi practitioners.",1333238400,5,453,4.392857142857143
4077909,3,B0036K9CIW,I own several Tai Chi dvds and am always looking for ways to change up my practice.  This dvd was lacking in so many areas- it did not flow and the practitioners did not engage me the way I was used to.  This was not for me but it does deliver what it says it does- 5 different Tai Chi based workouts.,1329091200,10,301,3.838709677419355

They also say the names of the movements and the purpose.  You can even do it with your pajamas on!  It is great for days when you are not able to go to the gym, want to take a break, or want to supplement your gym workouts with the mind body connection.",1328918400,13,425,4.072289156626506

4077913,5,B0036K9CIW,"I bought this DVD after owning Tai Chi DVD's featuring two of the teachers featured on this one.  Each of the teachers has something special and unique to offer and it is a benefit to have them all on one DVD. The workouts are each very clear and easy to follow. The benefits of a reqular practice are well documented and continue to build as long as you continue the practice. This DVD is a terrific way to get started. Each workout instruction is approx 30 minutes, and many of them have smaller chunks that are easy to learn and practice on your own. The instruction was performed outdoors in various beautiful natural settings- mountains in Colorado- beaches in Hawaii. That is an added touch that makes the DVD even more relaxing. Once you learn the routines, it is a blessing to take them out in nature and practice there.",1319068800,36,828,4.52

4077916,4,B0036K9CIW,"First off, Amazon is excellent to deal with.  Because of the Canadian Postal strike Amazon cancelled my shipping charge.  I love dealing with Amazon.  As for the DVD, I was very impressed with the Tai Chi AM and Energy Chi with David Dorian.  I thought they were excellent.  I was disappointed however with the PM Tai Chi.  Whoever wrote the script didn`t give enough explanation on how to do the moves.  CJ McPhee would be going through the moves the whoever was doing the dialogue wouldn`t be explaining how to do them.  The Qigong sections with Francesco Garripoli and Daisy-Lee Garripoli I have on other DVDs and I know they are excellent.",1310256000,4,643,4.678571428571429

The workouts are gentle, easy to follow and leave me feeling great. If you are already immersed in Tai Chi and related subjects you might find the disk too elementary.
