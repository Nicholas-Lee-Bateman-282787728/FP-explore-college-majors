7958037,5,B000062XO0,"This is one of my favorite Wilde plays, and this production, which features a very young Jeremy Brett, is one of my favorite presentations.  Like so many of Oscar Wilde's plays, An Ideal Husband revolves around a past event that comes to haunt the characters in their present lives.  As with others, it also questions some of society's most precious ""engraved in stone"" standards.  In short it questions the habit of throwing out the baby with the bath water.  Perhaps because Wilde lived an unconventional life himself, he was inclined to question the tendency of society to castigate and ostracize the misfits within it.  Here he questions whether a youthful wrong turn should negate an entire lifetime well spent.  It also questions the sometimes impossibly rigid standards by which we hold other people, especially those closest to us.

Because the feature is somewhat old, it has the ambiance of a live stage performance.  The sets are in fact sets and not real rooms, hence the character and creativity of the set designer is well displayed as in actual theater.  There are points of entrance and exit for the actors, and rooms are seen primarily from one direction as they would be on a proscenium stage.  The fancy technological sound wizardry that makes modern TV series seem like we are right in the middle of it is lacking, so the feeling of ""stage"" is enhanced.  At least in so far as the audience participates in suspending belief and provides emotional feedback to the actors, live stage is a more active experience.  For anyone who has never attend a stage performance, this is as close as it gets outside of a theater.",1281312000,9,1634,4.796428571428572
