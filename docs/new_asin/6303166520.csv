591265,5,6303166520,"This is by FAR the BEST film in the Leprechaun series.  What surprised me most when first seeing this film was how it takes the horror genre one-step further than your typical slasher film.  Some have noted Scream or even  Blair Witch Project but my feeling is that they have yet to see this film  which was saddly IGNORED in theatres!  The character archetypes are  prevalent in every which way but loose.  I guess Karl Jung hasn't seen this  ditty either!  Shevonne Durkin as the cunning and docile Bridget is SHEER  genius.  She commands the screen as soon as she walks on the screen turning  heads and hearts in both directions.  I can't seem to find any other films  out there starring this bright new star.  A young Garbo comes to mind when  mentioning her name.
For all you Twin Peaks fan out there you are in  for a real treet when you feast your eyes on ""Lucy.""
Remember  though....this is a GR-8 date flick.  Cuddle up close and sit tight as the  Leprechaun wreaks havoc on everyone in sight.  A sure thing if your looking  to get a ""little closer"" on your next trick.  BEWARE  MATEY......I'LL EAT YOUR NOSE!  HAHAHAHAHAHAHA",953683200,4,1134,4.522388059701493

591316,1,6303166520,"Like the original -- same mood, different plot.

 This time the Leprechaun wants a bride. Every 1000 years on his birthday he gets to choose a main squeeze and the beginning shows him selecting a particularly voluptuous blonde hanging up clothes. He enjoys tormenting his ""slave"" with this news, but the slave frees the girl from the leprechaun's greasy grasp and ends up not too pretty for it. Pissed, the leprechaun has to wait yet another 1000 years (I'd be ready to spit nails too!)

 Down the line, within the same bloodline (as was his promise to the slave) he spots and finds Bridget, a descendent of the original girl and sets out to make her his own. Set in modern times in a regular town, the leprechaun runs into a bit of resistance in terms of the girls boyfriend Cody, who runs a scam haunted tour business, and his uncle Morty, who's a drunk but a sweet one. Nonetheless the leprechaun nabs his prize and locks her away (thankfully - she's not the best actress so the less screen time the better) while he has to return to, guess what??, get back his gold. Greedy cityfolk!

 There are a few inconsistencies from the original to this one. While before he could be destroyed with clovers, obviously he stronger now and needs iron to kill him. Nevermind that he was locked in an iron case the first time and managed to escape.

 The main character, instead of expected girl, tends to be Cody. He's not bad on the eyes and his acting's better than hers so I was all for this plot decision.

 Some of the scenes were amusing, especially with the leprechaun in the bar, tricked into getting dead drunk by casual drinkers nearby and Uncle Morty. There's also one cool deal involving a young man wanting to get into Bridgett's pants but runs into the little guy instead. I won't tell specifics but it's a violent, unusual death -- although details aren't shown. If they WERE shown it instead of edited it would have been a very graphic, gory scenario.

 There's comedy like in the first but in a way it's now relied too much...Oh, what am I saying??? That's all the leprechaun movies rely on! But the first still managed to be more plausible.

 If you liked the first you may enjoy this one but avoid any future sequels at all costs!!! You have been warned...",1379635200,,2266,4.508557457212714
591317,3,6303166520,"Apparently the Leprechaun broke the curse in the well from the first movie. He's miraculously back in Ireland here, on his 1000th birthday, in which he can claim his bride. Hold on, didn't he say he was 600 in the first movie? It's olden times here (?!) and he has found his bride. Only it turns out that she is his slave's sister. All she has to do is sneeze 3 times without someone saying ""God bless you."". WTF? Said slave saves her, and the Leprechaun has to wait another 1000 years.

Cut to the present time, which really throws the universe out of whack. Cody runs a ghoulish Hollywood tour, visiting death sites of the rich and famous. Ian works at the go kart track and is really into Cody's girl, Bridget. Turns out Bridget is a descendant of the original bride-to-be. Ian gives Bridget a ride home, only the Leprechaun is one step ahead of him. Ian goes to fondle Bridget's obvious stunt boobs, and face plants into a lawn mower. Pretty funny stuff. Cody has to evade the police, who think he's killed Ian, and in the meantime rescue Bridget from the Leprechaun. Uh, I miss the shoe-shining disorder.

591318,4,6303166520,"Unlike the ususal appear and destroy formula, this little buggar appears and destroys those who gets in his way from his quest to find a suitable bride, plus regain a lost gold coin. The story surrounds a fake hollywood tours hearse ride in which one of the young workers obtains the coin by accident in a scuffle between leprechaun and comtemporary bride to be, who is of course, unwilling.
The movie revolves around her becoming captive in strange leprechaun cave hideout, and her young beau in pursuit to save her from bonds. Although she tricks the leprechaun into thinking she needs freedom from bonds to prepare for wedding, she actually prepares for his demise as he is away in hot pusuit for his coin.
The movie sticks pretty much to the whole dilemma incorporating many good scenes in regards to St. Patricks day celebrations during the annual holiday in drinking bar scene.  Warwick presents his staple for good acting under garb as demon type leprechaun. The demolition scenes are none too bloody, which means the story is more important than the gore.

591320,3,6303166520,"Oh boy! Whenever Sid gets a chance to review a movie with a fellow elf in it, he's all over it. In Leprechaun 2, Clint Howard gives the flick instant Unintentional Comedy status, and Jack Klompus from Seinfeld carries the ball the rest of the way to North Pole paydirt. The leprachaun was terrifying to all the tall people in the movie. He used his supperior mind powers to snag a hot piece Sid the Elf style, baby. Of course, he had to rack up a few bodies along the way to getting his hot bride, but it was all worth it in the end when he asked her, ""remember what a bad little girl you've been?"" Yes, I let him have that line. The elves must stick together.

Now, as far as the other characters in the movie go, they were as goofy as you want in an early-90's Unintentional Comedy. They all provided Sid great joy when he thought the leprachaun was going to get them. But, hollywood is so biased when it comes to elves, so I felt for the leprachaun when he was having dificulties. Two highlights to this movie: the Irish Elf jumping out of an Irish stocking, and an exploding elf. So, if you love elves and decent Unintentional Comedy horror, Sid says, Leprachaun 2 is for you!",1189987200,,1180,4.267857142857143
591321,4,6303166520,"This review refers to the edition found in Trimark's ""Leprechaun: Pot of Gore Collection"" boxed set.

THE WHO'S WHO: Starring Warwick Davis, Charlie Heath, Shevonne Durkin, Adam Biesk, Arturo Gil, Linda Hopkins, James Lancaster, Sandy Baron, Clint Howard. Score Composed and Arranged By Jonathan Elias. Directed By Rodman Flender. (R) For Mild Violence, Mild Gore, Very Mild Profanity, Suggested Drug Use, Nudity and Very Mild Sexual Content; 85m.; 1994.

WHAT'S GOING ON IN HERE?: On his one thousandth birthday, the Leprechaun (Warwick Davis) is able to take a bride. But the woman (Shevonne Durkin) he chooses is the daughter of his captured slave, William O'Day (James Lancaster). Before the Leprechaun can secure his new bride, O'Day upsets his plans and ensures that his daughter won't have to wed the nasty pint-sized villain. Angered, the Leprechaun places a curse on O'Day's bloodline. A millennium passes and now the vile Leprechaun has arrived in modern day Los Angeles to claim O'Day's ancestor (also Shevonne Durkin) as his replacement wife. But her current boyfriend (Charlie Heath) may have something to say about the Leprechaun's matrimonial choice. Director Rodman Flender takes the reins of the series from Mark Jones (who stayed on as a co-producer for this film) and crafts an admirable sequel to a unique original. The balance between laughter and mild suspense is still present, as well as strong characterizations from the starring roles. Charlie Heath is easy to respond to in his role of Cody Ingels. He has a winning personality and he comes across as genuine in his performance. Sandy Baron grabs most of the non-Leprechaun induced humor as Cody's legal guardian, Mortimer. But the best of the bunch is Shevonne Durkin, playing Cody's love interest (and the Leprechaun's) Bridget. While her acting can be fairly one-dimensional at times, her beauty and charisma overcome any impediments her limited talent places before her. The relationship between her character and Heath's also adds some intimate warmth to the film that strengthens the viewer's connection to them. As would be the case with all entries in this long-running series, Warwick Davis steals every spotlight he's given. His achievement excels amongst the ranks of horror movie anti-heroes, placing him on the same shelf with evil incarnates such as Freddy Krueger and Charles Lee Ray (better known as Chucky). Once again, Gabe Z. Bartalos does a commendable job creating the Leprechaun's make-up. From the first time you see him on camera till the last, you never feel that the make-up is a noticeable distraction. Rather, it's an addition of Davis' personality, an extension of his talent that fits him perfectly and is never lapse in its detail or its believability. Joining the credible make-up effects are a few truly extravagant low budget special effects, including my personal favorite...a battle between Cody and the skeleton of William O'Day deep in the halls of the Leprechaun's lair. The one major flaw of this film lies in Jonathan Elias' mediocre score. Instead of following up on Kevin Kiner's brilliant work from the first film, Elias takes his score in a completely generic direction. Trivia buffs take note: the African-American leprechaun in Brennan's Pub is played by none other than Tony Cox, who would go on to star opposite Billy Bob Thornton in ""Bad Santa"" almost a decade later. Die hard trivia buffs will also know that Cox did stunt work for the original ""Leprechaun"" movie. Also, actor Arturo Gil (who plays a drunk at the pub) did some stunt work for this film. Overall, this is one of those ""direct descendant"" sequels that retains the first film's feeling while developing a new storyline for itself. Though we've grown use to the idea of a Leprechaun terrorizing victims, we're still entertained by it. The series would start to go downhill a few years later, but this second ""Leprechaun"" outing still packs a punch for genre purists.

THEY SAY THEY'RE SPECIAL BUT...: As amazing as it sounds, this film actually has a 1.85:1 widescreen transfer. Only three of the six ""Leprechaun"" films can boast that, although why the original film isn't one of them I'll never know. While there are a few speckles of grain here and there, the widescreen presentation is clear for the most part and should delight fans of the series. Considering this movie only has an ultra stereo track accompanying it, it can be quite exuberant and full from time to time. Effects and dialogue are well defined and the musical backdrop stands out proudly against the rest of the film without obscuring the forefront. There are also French and Spanish subtitles which are a Halloween-style orange and have been placed well within the frame of the film. The front cover for this plastic case finds the Leprechaun backed by a city skyline at night holding a white candle in his hand. The back cover, much like the one for the original film, is a mishmash of photographs, information about the movie and the twenty-four chapter stops for this eighty-five minute film. The disc itself carries over the bleak nothingness of the first ""Leprechaun"" DVD. There's no painted photograph and no silver image imbedded into the top. There's only that annoying little white stripe surrounding the center hole that identifies this disc as ""Leprechaun 2"". There's another small ""Trimark DVD: The Ultimate in Home Entertainment"" booklet (exactly the same as the one in the initial film's case) residing opposite the disc. As with the first chiller, the only special feature on this DVD is the trailer (1:06) which is interesting, although it's far too short.

THE YOLK'S ON YOU: It's not much of a hidden feature, but it'll have to do. On the main menu for this disc, highlight the Trimark symbol in the lower left hand corner. You'll have access to trailers for the films ""Leprechaun"", ""Leprechaun 3"" and ""Leprechaun 4: In Space"" (4:25).

THE LEWD AND NUDE ALERT: Bridget (Shevonne Durkin) bares her breasts in her garage as part of a Leprechaun trick to lure the unsuspecting Ian (Adam Biesk) in. That's the beginning and the end of the sexuality ""Leprechaun 2"" exudes.

THE GORE REPORT: True gorehounds will find two worthwhile moments of bloodshed in this film, mixed between the secondary occurrences. The first sees a talent agent (Mark Keily) having his finger wrenched off by the Leprechaun when the Leprechaun goes for the man's gold ring. The second, and by the far the best, showcases an espresso caf waiter (Michael James McDonald) having his face steamed off by an espresso machine after he makes fun of the Leprechaun (Warwick Davis), who's recovering from his alcoholic binge at Brennan's pub moments earlier.

SAY AGAIN: ""Drink what you want. Drink what you're able. If you're drinking with me, you'll be under the table."" - The Leprechaun (Warwick Davis)

THE FINAL SAY: Yes, I recommend buying this DVD. The best route would be to purchase the first five ""Leprechaun"" films in the ""Pot of Gore Collection"" boxed set, however this solid sequel is able to stand on its own as an individual entity. For less obsessed ""Leprechaun"" fans who weren't sure about the remainder of the series, buying this one separately might be a preferable option. Either way, you can't go wrong with this entry.

591365,3,6303166520,"The initial response to 1993's ""Leprechaun"" (starring a confused looking, pre-""Friends"" Jennifer Aniston) had hardly died down when the geniuses at Trimark unleashed ""Leprechaun 2"" on an unsuspecting public. How could a sequel follow so closely on the heels of the original? Inquiring minds want to know, but don't push too hard in your quest for an answer to this mystery of the ages. The ""Leprechaun"" franchise ultimately totaled six movies released within ten years (the latest installment will appear on video store shelves in December 2003), so the powers that be must have given this horror series a high priority from the start. Maybe the producers of this franchise keep making the films because they hope Jennifer Aniston will return to star in another entry, just like Jamie Lee Curtis did with the ""Halloween"" movies in recent years. If this is the case, the guys behind ""Leprechaun"" better keep dreaming. Aniston would probably rather sell pencils on a street corner than appear in another one of these pictures. The original ""Leprechaun"" film possessed a few interesting ideas, but the grim law of diminishing returns knows no pity concerning movie sequels. This means ""Leprechaun 2"" suffers from major problems either minimized in or completely absent from the original.
Warwick Davis returns as the foul mouthed imp in ""Leprechaun 2,"" a movie that finds the little man concerned about securing himself a bride. According to the film the leprechaun can only marry once every thousand years or so (I know; he said he was 600 years old in the first installment. What do you want from me? I didn't write any of these movies.). Since it is quite difficult to find a woman when your face looks like a burnt pepperoni pizza, Leppie decides to use those old Irish charms of magic and trickery when he spots a fair haired lass hanging laundry out in the middle of a forest (!). Things don't work quite as planned, so the leprechaun keeps track of the offspring of his fetching lass through the ages. In fact, a map at the beginning of the film tracks the descendents down through time, even showing a point when one of the women sails to America. The thousand years are just about up, meaning the diminutive beastie must once again find and marry for love, and this time the potential bride is Bridget, a blonde airhead who looks suspiciously like the leprechaun's original cutie from the beginning of the film. Imagine that!
On this outing the leprechaun has some competition. Bridget likes Cody, a guy who works for one of those ""dead celebrity"" tours in Los Angeles. Unfortunately for Bridget, Cody's loyalties lie with his job and his deadbeat, drunken boss Morty. When good old Mort ties on another massive drunk, Bridget's boyfriend takes over the tour and drags her along. The inevitable blow up occurs, with Bridget taking off with another guy who is willing to spend some time with her. Bad mistake. Leppie suddenly appears on the scene and dispatches her new found lover with gruesome haste, and then abducts Bridget right out from under Cody's eyes. This leads to several scenes concerning Cody and Morty attempting to battle the leprechaun and find Bridget. During these pitched battles, we watch Leppie get drunk, learn that wrought iron burns leprechauns, and see Morty give birth to a huge pot of gold. If that isn't enough for you, we even get to watch the sprite ride a souped up go cart (shades of the first film, to be sure, but this time Leppie actually runs someone down). The movie ends with a showdown between Cody, Bridget, and the malevolent elf in the leprechaun's lair.
My biggest problem with ""Leprechaun 2"" concerns an issue that really starts in earnest here and becomes a greater problem in subsequent sequels: the people who make these films keep changing the rules of the game. In the first film, the pot of gold and a four leaf clover played a central role in the plot. In this sequel, it is a bride and the dangers of wrought iron that inform the bulk of the movie. We see even more outlandish changes in the other films. I guess the makers of these movies think that sticking to just pots of gold and clovers could bore an audience, and maybe so, but introducing all of these different leprechaun traits often makes the films difficult to follow.
Even with this significant problem, I still found it impossible to completely dislike ""Leprechaun 2."" The Morty character, played with over the top hilariousness by the late Sandy Baron, really clicked with me. Every time this guy appeared on screen I laughed at his antics, and it was a little hard seeing him go the way he did. Warwick Davis is good as always, cackling and wisecracking his way through the role of the evil demon. The actress who played Bridget is memorable solely for her terrible performance. This gal couldn't act if her life depended on it, and it shows in every miserable scene. In fact, I think this is the worst performance in the entire series and that is saying A LOT (see ""Leprechaun 3""). Look for Clint Howard in a small role as one of the tourists taking Cody's tour.
Once again, the DVD picture transfer looks pretty good for such a cheap film. A trailer for the film appears on the menu, along with several other trailers for some Trimark films. ""Leprechaun 2"" is a little gorier than its predecessor, and is also a little sleazier considering that the pint sized monster is trying to land a babe. Far from great, but also far from a complete waste of time, this movie will work for you if you've got a bit of time to burn and nothing better to do.",1068768000,,5570,4.707991803278689

Ive only seen the first four Leprechaun movies and this first sequel is definitely an all-around improvement, likely because the filmmakers had over twice the budget. The first movie was hindered by a limited location (a rural ranch house) and a monotonous story that got dull and redundant after 40 minutes. Leprechaun 2, by contrast, is compelling throughout for what it is, a low-budget horror/comedy. Davis is consistently amusing as the titular imp, Heath & Baron make for quality protagonists and Shevonne looks great (although shes not the best actress).

The film runs 85 minutes and was shot in Los Angeles.

7840466,3,6303166520,"This sequel makes me miss the rigid acting in Leprechaun (1993). Although Warwick Davis remains forever a pleasure on screen, his surroundings, supporting cast and writing have collapsed around him like a straw house!

We begin in Ireland 1000 years ago, as our Leprechaun (Warwick Davis) celebrates his 1000th birthday on which he may magically choose his bride by saying ""God bless you"" after she sneezes thrice.  Stupidest ritual ever!!!!  But his marital prophecy is foiled and he curses that on his yet next 1000th birthday he'll marry her fairest offspring.  Barf!  This sounds awful.  And why is he dressed like a green wizard!?!

So here we are on St. Patrick's Day 1994, his 2000th birthday, and the mythological wee person emerges from a tree in Hollywood, California. To preempt your question, I have no clue whatsoever why he was in that tree or for how long or how he got across the Atlantic Ocean.  Perhaps he teleported--as we learned he can do in part 1 when he has his gold and, thus, his powers.  But waitdidn't we last leave him dead in a well in South Dakota????

I'm left to wonder how this creature of Irish folklore emerged from this tree in 1994 when, in 1993, we last saw him melting to death after a kid slingshot a four-leaf clover down his throat.  Remember that?  Because evidently it slipped director Rodman Flender's (The Unborn, Idle Hands) mind.""

A lot seemed to slip his mind.  Like when the Leprechaun refers to St. Patrick's ""feast day"" on his 1000th birthday in the year 994which predates it being known as a feast day by about 700 years! Moreover, if his 2000th birthday is in 1994 then this Leprechaun was born in the year 7 BC (and not 6 BC, since there is no year zero), 401 years BEFORE Saint Patrick (AD 365-461) was even alive and before some pretty important Christian stuff happened regarded naming saints and all that jazz!  So not only are the writer and director rather uninformed Christians (and historians), but they also seem to have made a ""part 2"" that behaves as if ""part 1"" never happened.

What's more is that the practice of saying ""God bless you"" in response to a sneeze is not recorded prior to the year 77 AD. However it's expected to predate the earliest recorded (or ""written"") history, so we'll let that one slide.  But hold on, according to the Irish Folk story ""Master and Man"" by Thomas Crofton Croker one of the purposes of saying ""God bless you"" is to serve as a shield against evil.  Other variations are to protect the sneezer from momentary vulnerability to the Devil as the soul can escape during a sneeze, or that the sneeze itself is an effort to expel the evil (this Wikipedia article explains some of it).  It seems that no matter which historical variant of the phrase we choose, it makes absolutely no sense for the Leprechaun to say this to complete a prophecy in which an innocent virgin's soul is forever claimed against her will by an evil Leprechaun.

Well, in either case the Leprechaun's back and in control of his pot of gold.  And now, why ISN'T he dressed as a wizard?!?  Not that he ever should have been, but CONSISTENCY, people!

His magic permits him to control prehensile tree roots, cause hallucinations, and manifest telekinesis.  At one point he uses his powers of illusion to make a horny teenager think an exposed lawnmower blade was a pair of bare breasts so that when he goes in for a motorboat he got the wrong kind of motor in his face!  Unfortunately the kill occurs off-camera, thus highlighting the destitute budget--which accordingly reflects all other aspects of this film's production value.  But there was one entertaining on-screen kill when a snippety barista (Michael McDonald; Mad TV) gets steamed to death with a bloody blistered face.

The Leprechaun finally claims his bride in magical bondage (via three prophesied sneezes and a ""blessing"") and takes her home to his tree in Hollywood.  Yep.  Evidently he has lived there for a while, creating yet more discontinuity with Part 1.  His lair is a labyrinthine subterranean Hobbit hole.  He just needs to reclaim a gold shilling before he can consummate the marriage.  And things get festive when retrieving his gold is literally down by removing it from someone's stomach.

Doing away with four leaf clovers and shoe-shining compulsions, the movie crescendos into a lackluster finale culminating in an explosion when the Leprechaun is defeated by his ancient weakness, wrought iron.  His explosive death pales in comparison to his melting scene in Part 1 and after our protagonists escape his lair the movie ""just ends.""  Watch out for a cameo by MTV Lifetime Achievement Award Winner Clint Howard (Lords of Salem).  While this movie has its bad movie delights here and there, recognizing Clint might just be one of the more satisfying highlights for you.",1460505600,,4822,4.774427020506635

I have been a fan of this series since the very first film; I always thought Warwick Davis was excellent in each one even if the film was as good. Recently after buying the new Blu-Ray box set I started watching all of them again. Since I have already reviewed the first film and it is Halloween time I thought I would run through them. As it turned out I didn't remember this one as well as I thought I did, still it was good.

The story follows the Lep way back in the day as he is trying to get a bride. On a special night if a woman sneezes three times before someone can say ""god bless you"" she is his. Obviously someone has ruined it for him every time because in the present [90's] he is still looking for the one. When he is brought back he finds the one, a descendent of the last one he had chosen from the O' Day family. Naturally her boyfriend does not like the situation so he along with his uncle tries to stop him.

Now right off this film felt different then the way I remembered it. Also the shoe shining thing is gone here replaced with the Lep not being able to touch iron. A little change there from writers Turi Meyer and Al Septien who also wrote ""Sleepstalker"", ""Candyman 3"", and ""Wrong Turn 2"" together. I thought over all this was a good addition to the franchise but it is far from the best in the series. Director Rodman Flender [Idle Hands] did a good job over all here as the story moves at a good pace. The acting was hit and miss with the majority being B level acting, but I really thought aside from the brilliant Warwick Davis that Sandy Baron was great as Uncle Monty.

The film is fun and does have its share of funny moments and the film feels very 90's horror which I now realize I miss. This was a fun movie over all and Davis as always was brilliant. I would recommend it if you are a horror fan or want a new series to start. Now on to the next.",1414713600,,1899,4.083109919571045
