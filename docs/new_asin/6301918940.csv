7816752,5,6301918940,Tom begins this video in a gym where he has frames prebuilt for interior and exterior doors and windows.  He even has a rough in that is intentionally out of level and plumb.  He then proceeds to fix all the issues involved.  This is an excellent video for newbies and even experienced installers.  He gives lots of tips and techniques.  Shows doors sagging and how to resolve the situation.  I've been sharing it with all my friends.  Don't install a new door without it.  Videos are a lot easier than books in order to get the big picture.  This is well worth the money.,1114905600,5,572,4.423076923076923

Seeing him walk you through the steps of things like changing blades, making adjustments, making different types of cuts, and showing you many of the things that can be done on a bansaw, is much better than reading about it. I only found two of my questions left unanswered after watching this video, not bad huh?  For a person just buying a bansaw, I say ""buy this video, it will be money well spent.""",978307200,,471,4.476744186046512
