8214600,1,6305459150,"Now we all know *N Sync has the greatest fans in the universe, no doubt about that. But because of the wrap we are given as the best fans, we expect our fellow fans to make GOOD *N Sync videos, right? WRONG! This video is like a girl who video taped an *N Sync party at her house with some of the not-so-brightest fans. They ask *N Sync questions that anybody who has stuck with them this entire journey of ""celebrityism"" would know. Please don't waste your money on this unauthorized video buy something that will please you like Making of the Tour (that was the best) or Live at Madison Square (if you hadn't already recorded it off of HBO :) or even *N The Mix (which shows our 5 favorite guys before they even knew what was to come of them with No Strings and Celebrity). Just please don't buy this--spend your money on another AUTHORIZED video or and import CD.",994982400,3,866,4.319018404907975
8214601,3,6305459150,"This video was pretty good but (sorry if I sound picky) the quality of the graphics and the voice of the person really stunk. The whole video takes you step by step how to have an *N Sync party. And they ask questions about  *N Sync (That I am very proud to say I knew all the answers of) There is  one really annyoing girl at the party that really bothers me but who cares!  They don't play ANY of *N Sync's music which really stinks! They show some  really cute clips of the guys talking which is cute but over all I kinda  wish I hadn't bought it. But I love collecting *N Sync stuff so... (I wrote  a poem for you) If you like collecting *N Sync stuff too, I'd get this if I  were you! Arent I such a talented poet!  Hee hee, see ya later!",942105600,33,743,3.9395973154362416
8214602,1,6305459150,"I totally love *N'SYNC, but this video was, just plain stupid.  The guys wern't ACTUALLY in it!  So listen closely, don't buy!",942019200,21,126,4.681818181818182
8214603,1,6305459150,This video totally sucks if i could i would give it 0 stars!! All it is is watching gurls scream adn laugh over nsync...and all of the trivia questions something that every nsync fan already knows...im telling you  right now don't buy any nsync videos unless they are offcial!,935020800,,276,4.63265306122449
8214604,3,6305459150,I'm a huge fan and this is a nice idea for a party but the pics and info is nothing new to a true fan. Very boring watching girls giggle at stuff you already know. Stick with 'N THE MIX. Stay 'N Sync!,931996800,,200,3.6744186046511627
8214605,5,6305459150,"I ave not seen this video or even heard of it, will someone email me at shannross@usa.net and tell me what is on this video. Thankx! Later dayz...",930873600,,146,4.25
8214606,3,6305459150,Ok I haven't seen this video and when i looked at the reviews 2 people said it was good and 2 people said it was boring so can someone please email me and tell me if it's worth buying it. Or if I'm just better off  buying other things with their faces on it. Thanx Peace and Hair Grease  Later Dayz Stay *NSYNC,930614400,,310,3.9047619047619047
8214607,3,6305459150,"This video was not what I expected at all!  I was expecting a lot of *N SYNC footage, not just a bunch of girls having a slumber party!  I'm a huge *N SYNC fan, and love anything involving them, but this video was pretty  boring.",929232000,7,229,4.044444444444444
