3776434,4,B001RJ1Y5I,"A widowed Chinese father visits America to see his daughter for the first time in years.  For reasons we gradually discover in the course of the film, they are not close, and the daughter, having installed him in her apartment, spends more time away each day, politely avoiding discussing her life with him at all, keeping her emotional distance.  We see the father, despite his broken English, take walks, strike up casual conversations with a few Americans, like an unemployed girl lounging by a pool in her bikini, who explains she wants to be a ""forensic scientist,"" to which he replies he was a rocket scientist back in China, a claim we will find out a great deal more about later in the film.  The father begins meeting an Iranian woman of his own age in a nearby park each day, discussing their respective family situations, which parallel each other in some unfortunate ways.  Beginning to snoop on his daughter a bit, the father finds some surprising things about her life, but angers her in the process, which finally forces them to confront each other and attempt to right some misunderstandings.  Sadly, they still cannot reconcile, and the daughter packs the father off on a tour for his remaining time in America, the movie ending as he asks her not to see him off, neither of them liking good-byes.

This movie shares some qualities with Ozu's best films from the early fifties, especially TOKYO STORY, not the visual style, but the intensely observed family dynamics.  But here, in modern America, lacking extended families, Wang uses chance encounters with characters like the Iranian woman to achieve a less-profound but still emotionally moving effect.",1245628800,7,1672,4.907801418439717

3776448,5,B001RJ1Y5I,"This is an amazing movie.  The viewer feels the depth of the chasm that exists between a widowed Chinese man visiting his grown daughter in America--even though the dialogue is almost entirely in Chinese with English subtitles.  Both the father and the daughter have had difficult lives--the difficulties of which each keeps from the other.  How the two slowly comes to terms with each others lives and disappointments makes for an emotionally intense story.

The film has a few light and subtly comic moments as well, including a visit by young Mormon missionaries that come by the apartment and attempt to explain to the old Chinese man (with limited English) what they regard as the universal truths espoused by their religion.

I also enjoyed the conversions that the old man had on a park bench with an older Iranian woman who also has an Americanized grown child.  Despite the broken English that was their means of communication, it was striking how well these two older people understood one another.",1413504000,,1008,4.93491124260355

One learns a lot about China and this family's ability or difficulty in relating to each other. I enjoyed watching it.",1332288000,,278,4.9361702127659575
3776451,5,B001RJ1Y5I,I enjoyed this movie very much.  It really was heart-felt and expresses a good concept of relationship between a father and a daughter.  The father from China and the daughter becoming Americanized.  A good film also to improve your Mandarin Chinese Language skills.,1327968000,,266,5.1395348837209305
3776452,4,B001RJ1Y5I,"This film is one of the best on humanity, exile and loneliness. The story of two American immigrants who came from the farthest corners of the globe and speak two entirely different languages ties humanity in the strongest way. As Rumi said in his poem, the language of the hearts is far more expressive than what the tongue utters.",1306368000,2,332,4.6440677966101696
3776453,4,B001RJ1Y5I,"Mr. Shi (Henry O), a retired Chinese rocket engineer, travels from Beijing to meet his daughter Yilan (Fiehong Yu) living alone in America for the first time in 12 years. Mild-mannered Mr. Shi is a pretty outgoing person, ready to learn and happy to chat with other residents, including ""Madame"" (Vida Ghahremani), an elderly Iranian lady he met in the nearby park.

Still there is some tension between Mr. Shi and Yilan, who suggests he go on a tour around the country before winter comes. Or maybe she just doesn't want him here. The father is genuinely worried about his daughter, recently divorced. Mr. Shi really wishes her happiness - which means remarriage, perhaps - but his eagerness only makes the situation difficult.

""A Thousand Years of Good Prayers"" is based on the novel by Yiyun Li (which I haven't read), but the cinematic adaptation and its low-key approach would remind us of a classic film ""Tokyo Story."" Like Yasujiro Ozu's touching drama, Wayne Wang (""Smoke"") takes time to show the personality and the history of Mr. Shi through a series of dialogues with every slight facial expression, so that we can gradually understand the deep-seated issues between the father and the daughter.

""A Thousand Years of Good Prayers"" was shot in Spokane, Washington, and for the making of the film Wayne Wang hired non-professionals for the supporting roles such as the girl at the poolside or the ex-CIA condominium guard. Some part of the dialogues exchanged between them and Mr. Shi is based on their real-life experiences.

Nothing ""big"" happens in ""A Thousand Years of Good Prayers."" The 83-minute film resolves with a slightly melodramatic touch, but thanks to the excellent acting from the two leads, the film remains engaging throughout. It's good to see Wayne Wang back in form. A bit too slow and talky sometimes, and maybe not as great as his masterpiece ""Smoke,"" but this character-driven drama is still worth watching.",1264809600,3,1941,4.963076923076923
3776454,3,B001RJ1Y5I,"A thousand years is a short story which appeared in a book collection under the same name. I recommend reading this collection of short stories. Now it has been turned in to a movie. In this movie, a man, Henry O visits his daughter, played by Faye Yu who has been living in America for a long time. Henry O who plays this man is visiting his daughter after 12 years to help her recover from a divorce. The loneliness, isolation and the bewilderment of arriving in America has been captured well. His interactions with Americans, highlight his faith in humanity, but his daughter chides him and asks him not to rush in to judgments about the nature of Americans. His daughter is aloof and finds his presence stifling. A lot is revealed during the movie and even simple gestures between the father and daughter have meaning. He finds its distressing that his daughter his having an affair and is curious to know what went wrong with her marriage. He tries to make amends with his daughter, presumably because he was away so long from her, but his daughter is indifferent and finds him unwelcome in her new life. It is a good look at the traditional relationship that exist between children and parents in Asian cultures and although fathers are expected to be perfect, they can have feet of clay. I wish that the conversations between the Iranian and Henry O would have been subtitled but they are not, perhaps the director was trying to prove a point that language barriers can be broken. The movie does some justice to the character in the book, but the book focused more on the old man but the movie seems to focus on the daughter alone. However, it is is a good movie and I recommend it.",1259971200,,1690,4.526143790849673

8338093,4,B001RJ1Y5I,"""A Thousand Years of Good Prayers"" (2007 release; 83 min.) brings the story of Yilan and her dad. As the movie opens, we see Yilan, a Chinese woman who moved to the US many years ago, picking up her widowed and retired dad at the Spokane airport. It's his first visit to the US, and he is here to help Yilan get over her recent divorce. During the day as Yilan goes to work, he snoops around Yilan's apartment, and goes for walks in the park, where he gets to know people. Yilan is clearly not happy with her dad's visit. At this point we're maybe 10 minutes into the movie. What caused Yilan's divorce? Why is the relationship between Yilan and her dad so strained? Why was she named Yilan? To tell you more would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for your yourself how it all plays out.

Couple of comments: the movie is based on Yiyun Li's short story (she also wrote the film's script), and directed by Wayne Wang. The movie's plot (if that is the word you want to use) is deceptively simple (observing people in their day-to-day routines), as it turns into a psychological study of a complicated father-daughter relationship, with an immigrant aspect on top of that. (That alone was enough for me to want to watch this movie, as I'm a legal immigrant myself--originally from Belgium.)  At one point, Yilan's dad keeps nagging her to express her feelings. Responds Yilan: ""Growing up in a language where you never learned how to express your feelings, how can I now?"", wow. Please note: this is a talk-movie, not an action movie, so if a slow pace is not your thing, save yourself the trouble and watch another movie. The acting performances are outstanding, in particular the two leads (Henry O as the dad and Faye Yu as Yilan). The DVD comes with a couple of extras, the best of which is a 10-12 min. interview with Yiyun Li.

Bottom line: if you are in the mood for a psychological drama that is GALAXIES away from your standard Hollywood summer fare like Jurassic World or the latest Avengers, I'd encourage you to check this out. ""A Thousand Years of Good Prayers"" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",1437350400,,2117,4.536649214659686
