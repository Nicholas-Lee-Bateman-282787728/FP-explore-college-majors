88211,5,0790732521,"If you haven't seen this film yet, you must.  This tells a true story of some history rarely taught in schools today.  Michael Collins is an excellent piece of work!
In regards to the Irish Flag, in a way, it does  represent the separation of the North and South.  The Green is a  representaion of the Catholic, Gaelic speaking Republic and the Orange  (which came from William of Orange from who later came the  ""Orangemen"") represents the Protestant North.  The white between  signifies peace between the two sides.
Anyhow, buy the movie, watch the  movie, enjoy the movie.",943574400,6,575,4.775510204081633
88212,5,0790732521,"This film brings home to us that the loser of this war was (and is) Ireland herself.  ""Michael Collins"" is art, and it does all that art can do.
I'd like to address something a thoughtful viewer wrote  here: ""I am always skeptical of love interests in  historical/biographical films of this sort.""  OK, I buy that.  But  Kitty Kiernan, Mr. Collins's actual fiancee, becomes in this movie the  symbol of Ireland herself/itself.  The Irish people traditionally have seen  their beloved land as mother, sister, ""Dark Rosaleen""... and Miss  Roberts's role never panders to viewer's prurient interest.  She is the  Ireland that both warring ""brothers"" love, and fight for, and the  Ireland that loses them to each other... that's a tragedy of war, this war  and others...
  The end of the film brings home to us that the loser  of this war is Ireland herself.  Film cannot *be* life; in that  sense it can never be totally accurate. Film can only convey to us what we  the audience can recognize.  The flags, the accents, the love  interests--they are not history but devices to convey history on a flat  screen in two hours.",942105600,16,1120,4.7486910994764395
88213,5,0790732521,"It's tough to rate and accurately review a movie that means a great deal intellectually and emotionally. It was October of 1996 when I watched this film at the theater and I walked out forever changed. Prior to viewing the film, I had no idea about the life of Collins and I did not realize how young Irish independence truly is. Both the tragic elements of Collins's death and Liam Neeson's stirring performance led me to learn more about the life and times of Collins by voraciously reading anything I could find on the topic. It can be a rare thing for a historical film to pack a punch that seems relevant to modernity, but _Michael Collins_ does just that.
The plot, essentially, is this: A young man named Michael Collins (Liam Neeson) and his close friend Harry Boland (Aidan Quinn) are working for the cause of Irish independence. At the beginning of the film, they are taking part in the Easter Rising. A vivid and riveting portrayal of the executions faced by the Rising's leaders is juxtaposed with Eamon DeValera (Alan Rickman) writing a letter to Collins explaining ostensibly why he would not be killed (he was of American birth). Michael travels around the country and works tirelessly with Harry for the cause. He is thrown in jail, he is beaten during a campaign speech and he meets an intriguing woman, Kitty Kiernan (Julia Roberts). Collins falls for her but Harry does too. Initially, she is dating Boland but in time, her heart goes to Collins. During this romance, Collins is both running from death and ordering it for his opponents. He taps the resource of Ned Broy (Stephen Rea) a veritable double-agent working as a G-man. Collins is chosen to negotiate on the Irish side of treaty talks, though this event is covered rapidly in the film. He returns home and is engaged to Kitty only to find that he and Harry are on the opposite sides of whether the Anglo-Irish Treaty should be ratified. There is plenty of drama and some comic relief here and there. I won't go into the details of the ending, though I am sure most people reading this review already know or can guess how the story concludes.
If you are interested in Irish history or ""war films"" in general, _Michael Collins_ is a film for you. If you view it and find yourself as drawn into the actual biography of Collins as I did, I highly suggest you pick up a good book on the subject. Though the film makes for an excellent introduction, it can in no way compare to the wealth of real, tangible information out there.",941328000,22,2503,4.589285714285714
88214,4,0790732521,"If you thought that oppression in the 20th century was limited to dictatorships or 3rd world countries, you thought wrong.  Starkly depicted is the truculent domination of the British over their close neighbors, the  Irish.  Neeson is perfect as the charismatic, determined, and troubled  leader of the Irish movement (I know, people will argue and say it was  Griffith or De Valera, but Collins was responsible in no small way for  Irish Independence).  Moving, compelling drama with perfect soundtrack,  marred only by horrible accents from Roberts and Quinn.  I highly recommend  this film, especially if you know little about the history of Eirann.",912729600,4,652,5.242718446601942

88236,5,0790732521,"Fascinating look at the turbulent period of the early ""Troubles"" in Ireland, the revolutionary era from the Easter rebellion in 1916 (where the film starts) through the period of guerrilla war between Irish nationalists and the British Crown and the following civil war between the newly created Irish Free State government and refusenik Irish republican diehards.  I recommend it despite some  minor historical inaccuracies, it does stay true to the overall attitudes and events of the time even it many episodes need be compressed or merged for cinematic purposes.

Excellent performance by Liam Neeson, even down to the Cork accent; evocative Irish locations; detailed costuming; smart script; skillful directing -- an outstanding epic in the old David Lean style. The only weak note is the seemingly obligatory romantic triangle between the male leads and female lead, played woodenly by Julia Roberts.

(Ned Broy did not die in actuality).  Liam Neeson is terrific, and does a good job with a West Cork accent considering he's from the North.  While the jury is still out to this day as to whether Devalera ordered Collins' assassination, Dev later practically took the blame himself. Numerous newer biographies of Collins and Devalera, as well as histories of this period, have been published since the Good Friday Accords.  Those I have read so far seem to back up the accuracy of the movie and the allure and intelligence of the man.  this is a must see for anyone interested in Irish history, or who is just looking for a good movie to watch.",1478563200,2,845,4.576158940397351

So is Alan Rickman - his character lacked development.  So many great stars wasted, but Neeson carries the movie.  The movie underlines the violent forces that resulted in a free Ireland.

However, two of Collins' most trusted comrades were caught the night before the Squad did its work against the Cairo gang. Collins was indeed very close to Harry Boland but was not present when he was killed.)

88265,4,0790732521,"Michael Collins, 1996 film

This takes place in early 20th century Ireland. Michael Collins was an Irish patriot who worked for Irish independence. He speaks to a crowd about resistance to British rule. The Irish Constabulary attack the crowd and club Collins, the crowd disperses. Men attack a police post by firing the thatch roof, the disarming the police as they emerge. A man follows him, then gives him information about a meeting of politicians. Can this man be trusted? [The dark scenes are a distraction.] Collins asks this source to get him into the Castle (the headquarters of the British rulers) so he can inspect their files. Collins asks his men to get complete files on British administrators. He wants a warning to be given to collaborators that they will be killed. The British arrest a suspect for questioning (by intensive means). One collaborator is shot in the streets! The police raid a house, men escape over the rooftops. [This reminds me of WW II movies about Nazi-occupied Europe.]

The newspapers report the escape of Eamon De Valera. He wants recognition of Ireland by President Wilson. [Isnt this an assumption?] A young boy warns the men of a police raid on the home where they stayed. A car bomb kills some English officials. The British send a new force to Ireland to fight the terrorists. [One mans patriot is another mans terrorist.] Violence continues. Churchill picked the elite of the British Secret Service to go after Michael Collins and his boys. They want a picture of Michael Collins. A servant collects papers from a wastepaper basket to provide confidential information. Collins plans an operation with a dozen men. None are to sleep at their usual place this night. Doyle, the source, is followed to a hotel; it is raided. Doyle is tortured to get information. That night men are killed. British troops attack a rugby match in a stadium, then machine gun the players and spectators! De Valera returns from America. There is a slim chance for talks with the British.

There is a discussion about tactics and warfare. An attack on the Customs House fails, there is retribution. There is talk of a truce for negotiations between Ireland and England. Collins is chosen as a representative. [Nobody knows what he looks like.] There will be an Irish Free State, part of the British Empire. Its the best they can do at this time. Its a first step. This is not good news. There is conflict over this treaty which partitions the country. Collins says the alternative is a war for which they are not ready. The Treaty is passed by a narrow margin. This creates conflict among friends. In 1922 the Irish Army takes control of the government. The British flag is lowered, the Irish tricolor is raised.

But a civil war breaks out between opposing factions (The Troubles). The Army is divided. Can fighting be prevented? Collins supports the treaty. A government building is shelled by artillery. Armored cars patrol the streets. [Have things changed?] The Army shoots at civilians who return fire; or the other way around. One man seeks shelter underground. There is a tragedy. There is a proposal for talks, it will take place outside Dublin. Will Collins go to Cork? Yes, in spite of the danger. He wants to stop the bloody mayhem. Collins awaits an answer; a meeting is arranged. But men prepare an ambush of the motorcade. Shots are exchanged, Collins falls, shot dead. Kitty hears the bad news, she will not need a wedding gown. Collins was age 31. There is a big funeral for him.

I don't know much about Irish history, I wonder what was omitted or added for drama. Its a good story and worth watching. I read that Erskine Childers was shot in reprisal; later his son became President of Eire. Note how military power creates political power. Thats why 19th and 20th century aristocracy always wore uniforms to show their status.",1473552000,,3868,4.801801801801802

88268,2,0790732521,"An interesting spin, but not really representative. If it were fiction it would have been ok, but to sell it as factual is a misrepresentation.
It is in fact the sickening story of terrorists and how they achieve their ends, although this film attempts to sanitise the overthrow of the democratic process and murder of police and civilians during 1916 and after. The problem may have been initiated by the unionists arming
themselves to oppose home rule in return for which the republicans similarly purchased arms from germany. Of course it might be pointed out that Germany's exploitation of the UK's nationalist issues was excellent use of opportunity; thank God they did not win though.

Collins had been living in London for most of his life and returned to Ireland to avoid being conscripted into the first world war. Many like him had no income and so took the money collected in the USA to help destroy the democratic process even at the cost of Germany winning the first world war. How deluded they were to think had Germany won Ireland would have not been next for the picking. 11 million dollars was collected by DeValera in the USA and yet none of the American involvement in this tragic period in history was mentioned, or the ethnic cleansing of unionists. His legacy was bitterness, division and hatred. Had Collins done his bit and fought alongside 200,000 irish soldiers for the freedom of Europe, Ireland would have achieved dominion anyway (and possibly remained united) as the legislation was passed in 1911 but postponed due to the war. Canada and Australia obtained dominion but that was not enough for Ireland, it had to be bringing up children in a state where hatred of the rest of the british isles was written into the educational system. So what did Collins achieve really ? His story is part of the birth of the Irish free state, which would have happened anyway but he has been conveniently airbrushed to make the cronies of the IRA terrorist state look good.

Would have benefited from more folk dancing for gullible the american audiences. Essentially follows the Sinn Fein narrative which is falsehoods perpetuated to create the lie that Ireland needed armed struggle to separate from the UK; it did not, it was already won by the IPP who were the real heroes, but are alas forgotten.",1473292800,,2317,4.804511278195489

Julia Roberts' lines were flat and her character felt shallow and more used  by the director to advance the plots regarding the male leads rather than to give her a full-bodied emotional life.",1463097600,,540,4.604166666666667

I had family members who participated in the rising and was interested in knowing a bit more.  Although not 100% accurate it does portray the fact that Michael Collins did more to help found the Irish Republic than Eamon De Valera.  Sad because my family were devout followers of De Valera but after doing much historical research, had De Valera not walked out and accepted the treaty that Collins brought back and acted as a loyal opposition party inside the government.  The Irish Civil War may never have happened and so many of my family would have not perished in that epic struggle a hundred years ago.  So what I have come to acknowledge, much to a better perspective and against family tradition, is that Michael Collins was right and that Eamon De Valera was wrong.
The movie is a good primer to Irish history that has excellent actors.  But to get at the truth, please do much more reading and research.

If you've never been to Ireland or have never studied its rich history, watch this movie at least twice to gain an understanding of some of the nuances that are portrayed of a people desperate for self governance.

88311,5,0790732521,"I won't debate ""Michael Collins"" as a movie (it still stands up after 20 years having just re-watched it) - but I will rave about the 2K restoration on this new March 2016 Warner Brothers ""20th Anniversary"" BLU RAY reissue.

First up the picture is clearly frame-by-frame restored and looks fabulous. There are even scenes indoors with Stephen Rea in Dublin Castle amidst his intelligence papers and the crowd sequences with Alan Rickman (brilliant as the political eel that was Eamon De Valera, Ireland's first President) where the word 'beautiful' leaps to mind. Much of the movie is filmed at night and in foggy streets - so the restoration was always going to be a challenge to keep that fuzz and grain at bay while at the same time retain the natural colours of the film intact. And this transfer has achieved that. When you watch the 9 or 10 short deleted scenes (mostly containing Liam Neeson and Aidan Quinn as Michael Collins and Harry Boland larking about) - you see the untreated film stock with its scratches and lines and realise what a great job has been done on the main event.

The extras include:
A feature-length Commentary by Director NEIL JORDAN
In Conversation with Neil Jordan (new)
The South Bank Show Special from 1996
Theatrical Trailer
Deleted Scenes (about 10)

The new ""In Conversation With Neil Jordan"" has him reminiscing (in Warner Brothers seating) about the making of the film and 20 years of hindsight (Ireland was only just emerging out of the Troubles with both the IRA and The UVF having cease-fired when it was being made) - but it's criminally short and not particularly informative. A hundred times better is the near 50 minutes of ""The South Bank Show"" filmed in 1996 just after the launch of the movie. It features properly in-depth interviews with Director and Writer Neil Jordan, Tim Pat Coogan the Irish Author of Collins' life, Unionist peacemaker David Ervine and England's film and book critic Tom Paulin. It also has Producer Stephen Wooley fondly discussing the use of Dublin as a set (the whole city  unprecedented access) - the 5000 extras who turned up in period costumes for the shoot - short interviews with Neeson and glimpses of on-set shooting (Julia Roberts, Stephen Rea, Ian Hart and Brendan Gleeson). It goes into Collins' early 20's life as a worker in England for the Post Office, his grounding in Accounting so that he managed the finances of the revolution and in particular the paradox of the man - part gentleman - part ruthless killer - and probably the inventor of modern-day guerrilla warfare. It talks also of his eventual assassination by his own army in Cork at the age of 31 and how Jordan re-wrote the Croak Park black and tan murders and that controversial 'was De Valera involved in the assassination, possibly ordered it' scene (which Jordan argues was never his intention).

The BLU RAY of ""Michael Collins"" of course also avoids that crappy 'flipper' of a DVD we've had to live with all these years where you had to turn the damn thing over to view the remainder of the movie. And in 1.78:1 Aspect Ratio  the BLU RAY fills the entire screen with a lush picture that thrills all the way to the end (""Michael Collins looks way better than its $28 million-dollar budget). The 5.1 Audio rattles those explosions and gunfire shots around your room with renewed force and you also get to appreciate the stunning commitment of the actors involved (Liam Neeson and Aidan Quinn have been lifetime friends ever since).

Part of their respected and applauded 'Warner Archive Collection' series of BR reissues - ""Michael Collins"" is a triumph on BLU RAY. If you love this movie - you need to own it on this format. And that truly beautiful version of ""She Moves Through The Fair"" by Sinead O'Connor as the credits roll still moves me to tears...

88331,5,0790732521,"""Michael Collins"" was a life long dream project for director Neil Jordan and when he finally got the chance to bring his version of the IRA leader and political martyr to the screen in 1996, the results were mixed at best. Part biography and part history lesson, the film comes off more as a gangster film with it's emphasis on violence, vendettas, betrayals, vengeance, assassinations and urban guerrilla warfare. That's not to say that it's bad, quite the contrary. Jordan's film is beautiful to look at but contains many alterations and inaccuracies that may leave some viewers puzzled. Warner Home Video(through it's Archive Collection) has now released ""Michael Collins"" on Blu-ray for the first time and the results are once again, simply spectacular. Released last week in time for not only the film's 20th Anniversary but the 100th Anniversary of the 1916 Easter Rebellion(where the film starts), Warner's has re-mastered the film in 2K from an interpositive taken from the original camera negative and this new Blu-ray transfer(Bitrate: 30.99)  was supervised by director Neil Jordan. The results are a beautiful presentation from start to finish. Jordan used Oscar winning cinematographer Chris Menges(""The Killing Fields"", ""The Mission"") to photograph the many Dublin locales where the majority of the film takes place and his use of desaturated, rather than bright colors gives the film a more authentic look. The Dublin locations have never looked so dreary and foreboding, resulting in a certain sadness throughout the film. This may have been Jordan's intent all along in his version of Ireland's War of Independence(1919-1922). However, whenever the film moves outside of Dublin the Irish countryside looks simply beautiful with it's lush green fields looking especially eye popping on Blu-ray. There are no vertical lines, specks, damaged or torn frames and anyone purchasing this new Blu-ray will be pleased with the results. The acting is top notch with Liam Neeson giving one of his best performances in his role as the charismatic but doomed Michael Collins. He gets great support from Aidan Quinn, Stephen Rea and the late Alan Rickman. That being said, Julia Roberts is badly miscast as Kitty Kiernan, the woman who loves(and becomes engaged to) Collins shortly before his death. To her credit, she doesn't have much to do in the film except to act as a love interest to two of the main characters. The Audio(English DTS-HD MA 5.1; Dolby Digital 5.1 for Japanese and Dolby Digital 2.0 for German and Spanish) is clear and free of any noise artifacts(hiss, pop, crackle, etc.) but viewers may want to use the individual subtitles as some of the dialogue is hard to understand when spoken by some of the actors. As mentioned above, Jordan made many alterations to the real events depicted and even some inaccuracies none more so than to Stephen Rea's character(Eamon ""Ned"" Broy) who is tortured and killed in the film but in reality lived until 1972. Those negatives aside, ""Michael Collins"" is an engrossing film from start to finish and the Warner Archive Collection has given it new life on Blu-ray. ""Michael Collins"" is 132 minutes(Aspect ratio: 1.78:1) and contains the following subtitles: English SDH, German SDH, Spanish, Japanese, Czech, Korean, Mandarin, Polish, Thai and Turkish. Special features include: (1) Commentary by Director Neil Jordan, (2)  ""The South Bank Show""  documentary hosted by Melvyn Bragg with a Neil Jordan Interview(51:11 minutes), (3) Deleted Scenes and (4) the Theatrical Trailer. The Blu-ray disc itself is housed in a solid standard Blu-ray case(not an eco-cutout case). ""Michael Collins"" is an absorbing and important film of historical events that are even more relevant today than when they actually occurred over a hundred years ago. It comes highly recommended.",1459296000,3,3824,5.204545454545454

In fact pretty much everyone in this film is great with the exception of the hopelessly miscast and wayyyyy out of her depth Julia Roberts.  Neeson pretty much was born to play the role of Collins, but Aidan Quinn and Stephen Rea also shine.

Given my Irish background, the history is familiar to me, and although Neil Jordan time-telescopes a bit and changes a few minor things, it is largely accurate.

Director Neil Jordan was at the height of his fame following his great success with ""The Crying Game"" when he was finally able to convince film investors to fund ""Michael Collins,"" a project which was 10 years in the making. I knew little about the history of the struggle for Irish independence but after seeing this film, it propelled me to do a little research. As a history lesson Michael Collins does well in covering the main historical points but Jordan does little in presenting the British point of view.

The film begins with the Easter Rising of 1916, a violent protest in Dublin which resulted in the defeat and arrest of the leaders amongst the Irish rebels. What Jordan doesn't let on here is that the rebellion was not at all popular with the Irish people and the tide didn't turn until the British executed the majority of the rebels following the rebellion.

Liam Neeson does well in playing Collins as a dynamic, strong character but Collins was around thirty when the events of the film takes place and Neeson was about 14 years older. If you're willing to forgive the age difference, Neeson is quite believable as the fiery Irish leader who is still regarded as a George Washington figure amongst the contemporary Irish populace.

Jordan is at his best when he dispassionately regurgitates the sequence of events that led to the establishment of Ireland as a free state and the resulting civil war. Of particular note are the gripping scenes of escalating violence: Collins is a beaten by the Royal Irish Constabulary after speaking at an election rally; Collins recruits a squad of killers who murder 14 members of the MI5 ""Cairo Gang"" and the ensuing act of genocidal revenge taken by the ""Black and Tans"" paramilitary force at a soccer match; the IRA attack on the Custom House which Collins opposed as he knew the British would easily win; the attack on Collins after the treaty with the British, at an anti-Treaty Republican rally; the offensive against the ""The Four Courts"" by the anti-Treaty side of the IRA, despite Collins' bitter opposition; and the ambush of Collins, resulting in his death.

Also of great interest is the conflict between Collins and Eamon de Valera (played by an effective Alan Rickam) who early on felt that Collins was acting on his own. The actual split between the two leaders is foreshadowed when de Valera goes to meet President Woodrow Wilson in order to gain recognition of the IRA's objectives and takes Collins' best friend and constant companion, Harry Boland, with him. Eventually de Valera orders Collins to negotiate the treaty with the British over his objections that he's not a diplomat. And it was de Valera who split with Collins over the terms of the treaty which broke Ireland into two and still had the new Irish Free State swearing allegiance to the Crown.

What's most fascinating about Collins is that initially he was regarded as a terrorist by the British but after negotiating the treaty between Ireland and the UK, he was now regarded as a ""moderate."" In fact, during the Irish civil war, the British supplied arms to Collins' forces who eventually defeated the anti-Treaty faction. Jordan argues that Collins' targets were either brutal forces of the British intelligence service or Irish collaborators, not innocent civilians. Whatever the case, Collins, who was yesterday's terrorist now became today's dignified statesman.

Jordan unfortunately leaves out the British side of the story. Instead, they're all evil or supporters of evil. Jordan is not adverse to twisting historical facts to make the British seem worse. The scene of the massacre at the soccer match is exaggeratedno armored vehicle entered the premises and machine gunned people in the stands. A British Court of Inquiry found that the actions of the paramilitary group ""was carried out without orders and exceeded the demands of the situation."" The commander of the Dublin District stated that ""the firing on the crowd was carried out without orders, was indiscriminate, and unjustifiable, with the exception of any shooting which took place inside the enclosure."" Nonetheless it was also true that this inquiry was suppressed by the British government. The King of England and some British politicians expressed their horror at the Bloody Sunday massacre and such a public relations disaster did much to strengthen the hand of de Valera's government, eventually leading to the peace treaty between Ireland and England.

The killing of the double agent Irish detective who aided Collins, Ned Broy, also appeared to be designed by Jordan to manipulate the audience into hating the British even more. Broy is actually a composite character of three people. While people were tortured by the British (particularly those who were involved in the assassinations of British intelligence agents on Bloody Sunday), Broy lived well into his 80s.

Jordan's decision to take a few liberties with historical events and characters doesn't seem so bad in light of his overall success in depicting the chronology of events in the Irish fight for independence and its aftermath. Nonetheless, aside from Collins (and perhaps de Valera) most of the other characters in the drama are unremarkable and certainly Julia Roberts has little to do as the love interest between Collins and sideman Boland.

While necessary, after a while, many of the violent goings on in Michael Collins, felt more like a docudrama. Only when the conflict between de Valera and Collins heats up, can one say that the narrative becomes truly compelling. Again what's missing is the British point of view (and perhaps a singular antagonist) which could have added to the efficaciousness of this well staged period piece.",1448755200,2,5769,5.02510460251046

I spoke with another Irishman in a pub while we were there and Michael Collins is his hero.  Now I understand why.  To be so young and yet such a charismatic leader is astounding.

Liam Neeson and Julia Roberts were brilliant in the movie.  The character Julia played was a farmer's daughter from the county my father was born in.  This all brings tears to my eyes.

I watched this after seeing the movie THE WIND THAT SHAKES THE BARLEY- which takes place after Collins had agreed( reluctantly) to a treaty with England.

It makes a little more sense to see this first- then see THE WIND THAT SHAKES THE BARLEY if one wishes to stay in historical year order.
This movie moves at a swift pace and Liam Neeson passes well for the real Collins, looks wise.  Julia Robert's character as well as Aidan Quinn's both really existed and things pretty much unfold the way they did in real life.",1433635200,6,868,4.40625

88874,5,0790732521,"The film, ""Michael Collins"" brings the troubled history of Ireland into realistic clarity unmatched by most studies of the causes that led to the outbreak of the armed uprising against Great Britain on Easter morning, 1916. Superbly acted by Liam Neesan in the role of the heroic leader  of the Irish struggle for independence, viewers are led, first, to the violence in which the Irish revolutionaries, most of whom were scholars, poets, and teachers, who were overmatched by the firepower of the British army and forced to surrender. The execution of the leaders of the uprising, was swiftly followed by the guerilla war with British forces in which Collins' skills at secret operations to outmaneuver the British spy agency, coupled with his strategic military prowess drove Great Britain to the negotiating table. The film is highlighted by the conflict between a schrewd Eamon Devalera, played  by Alan Rickman, who sends Collins to negotiate the treaty offered by Great Britain and then in a sinister move accuses Collins of treason to the Republic, selling out to Britain in order to settle for the much less goal of an Irish Free State. The film captures the tension of that conflict and its leading to the civil war during which Collins, the hero of the guerilla war, is assassinated by the followers of the anti-treaty forces. The drama of this important segment of Ireland's modern history and the Irish Republic, independent of Great Britain,  are augmented by the presence of Aiden Quinn as Harry Boland, Collins's close friend and aide in the mayhem of the conflict leading to the treaty,and the vivid performance of Julia Roberts as Collins's girlfriend, vying with Harry Boland for her affections, and later Collins's fiance at the time of his assassination. .",1398643200,,1776,5.034013605442177

Julia Roberts is out of her depth. Poor accent, little sense of her love conflict.

Some people love to read history, others do not. If you have wondered why the Irish, after basically ""winning"" the Irish War of Independence, then had a quick civil war and why to this day Northern Ireland is part of the UK, this is one of the movies you should see. Also, if you want to be freaked out by seeing Severus Snape as one of the heroes of Irish Independence, here's your flick.

My favorite part is really the first half: it's gripping, starts out with the Easter Rising (song: Foggy Dew, best known version by the Chieftains with Sinad O'Conor singing) in 1916, mentions in passing that most of the men in the Frongoch internment camp for months after that were teaching each other the principles of Revolution, and continues to follow Michael Collins and Eamon De Valera and their friends through the Irish War of Independence (1919-21), in scenes which are by turns scary, hilarious, or tender. The War of Independence ended with British withdrawal from the south and British administrative partition of the country -- and that was the source of the trouble that led to the Civil War (1922). And that is where our heroes are thrown into conflict with one another.

The representatives who negotiated the peace (oh, no! Our romantic lead is the negotiator!) agreed to the partition, and allowed Northern Ireland to still be a part of the UK, while the south became a Dominion of the British Empire called the Irish Free State.

You see what happened? A large number of their mates back home in Ireland were powerfully angry, felt betrayed. One side thought it was the only way to end the war, and they might as well start with what they were being offered and work toward full independence and reunification later, the other side said there would never be a better time than now, and that this was a waste of all the lives that had been spent in the struggle. Very dramatic, ultimately very violent, and our film's hero, Michael Collins, must confront his closest friends over this -- and in some ways he's defending a position he never wanted to occupy in the first place.

If you want another moving, although more fictionalized, view of this time in Irish history, see The Wind That Shakes The Barley (made ten years later, but based in the same time period, it won a Palm D'or at the Cannes Film Festival). The two together do an effective job of showing the powerful motivations and justifiable positions of both sides (actually there were more than two sides, but it settled out into ""mostly"" two) in the Civil War, although of course the British don't come off well in either -- what were you expecting?!  This movie does not explain the origin of The Troubles in Northern Ireland, really, except to include the partition as a fact; it mostly focuses on events in the south.

89074,4,0790732521,"Well, I know that I risk an ""unhelpful"" mark from anyone who is mad that I don't think this is a 5-star movie, but, the truth is, I love Liam Neeson, I love Julia Roberts, I love Ireland, but this movie didn't click for me so much. Too much of the filming is too much in the dark..., yes, folks, we have been able to light up the night for a long time, and a lot of the in-the-dark shooting was historically imprecise. They had no reason to keep the lights off to beat each other up. Its a filmmakers thing, I guess, even modern mystery stories have the good guy running around with flashlights instead of turning on a light switch.
Anyway, politics between the Easter Uprising and the first independence (which didn't come around til 1922, about when Michael Collins was shot) were really confusing. There are a lot of players (just look at the size of the cast of this little film, and they didn't include all the players...) and even scholars of Irish history can get confused by who's who and which of the many little pockets of rebellion (yes, folks, Michael Collins' group was also fighting with other Irish groups) are involved... So, it would be easier to see who's who and who's talking with the lights on. It would also be a little more historically accurate. I haven't read too many accounts of the time which involve punching the wrong guy in the dark. And I don't need to have a filmmaker representing dark times with dark filming.
I also found that I needed to explain some backstory to people who were watching the film with me because it wasn't adequately explained in the movie. For one example, DeValero, an American citizen of Irish ancestry, and his positions didn't make good sense to some very bright people who didn't already know that little part of Irish history (no, I don't mean its an insignificant part, but it is only a 7 year period....). I think just a little rewriting could have made it more understandable.
Well, I love Liam Neeson and his acting... Julia Roberts' part, the love-interest of Michael Collins, is small, but she's great, even if the accent needed a little more work... Aidan Quinn is archetypical great Irish actor. Ian Hart does intense parts intensely, and is good looking to boot.

89142,5,0790732521,"This is a fantastic movie. Passionate, energetic, compelling, and tragic. The script crackles along with wit and pathos, the acting is superlative (esp. Neeson, who, I read, waited some 10 years to play the part while Jordan wrote the script and chased funding), the directing outstanding. Truly magnificent.

The historical era it covers is a tough one, not least for an Irishman like myself - the birth of the IRA, the guerrilla army of the Irish Republic which had been declared at the Easter rising of 1916 (with which the film opens). Despite that rising's failure, the survivors continued to behave as if the Republic was a reality and when, in the 1918 elections, the Irish people overwhelmingly endorsed the Republic, the elected officials refused to go to London, but formed a secessionist government in Ireland, complete with a Taoiseach (Prime Minister) Eamon De Valera, and a cabinet of ministers, including Collins. Collins was tasked with organizing the Republic's ""army,"" the IRA, to fight the inevitable British backlash. And so the War of Independence started.

All of this is wonderfully portrayed in the film, though some of the complexities are glossed over, as they must be for a film. Collins is shown as the man he was, a brilliant organizer and leader, a master of counter-intelligence, and a ruthless opponent of British rule, but one who despised the lengths he was forced to go to fight the superior British Empire and bring it to its knees. A warrior who longed for peace. Stirring stuff.

The most controversial aspect of the film is undoubtedly the Collins-De Valera relationship. Collins is depicted as fiercely loyal to ""his chief,"" but De Valera, himself a pedant and micromanager, is jealous of Collins' dashing style, the natural loyalty he evinces in others, and his growing popularity. So when the British offer to negotiate, De Valera sent Collins to lead the team - in the full knowledge that whoever was in that role would have to return with a compromise solution, since the British would never recognize the Republic outright.

And so it turned out. After three months in London, where he cut a figure in society circles, Collins returned with a Treaty that De Valera instantly lead the charge to denounce. Pushing matters to the extreme, De Valera openly incited armed resistance to the pro-Treaty side, and a civil war ensued (1922-1923). Collins defended the treaty as giving Ireland ""the freedom to achieve freedom,"" while his purist opponents demanded the Republic be defended and fought for. Collins lost his life in that pointless war, and with him Ireland lost one of her most gifted sons.

My father liked to tell me a story about Collins. My dad used to go up to Belfast for golf games with friends, many of whom were Protestants and fiercely Unionist (that is, they supported the Union of N. Ireland and Britain and opposed the Republic). One night, he said, after a few quiet pints after a game, one of these Unionist friends leaned over to my dad and said ""I tell you, this would be a different country if Michael Collins had lived."" My father almost fell of his seat (not from the pints of Guinness). Here was a Unionist praising the former head of the IRA, the man who had led to the establishment of the Irish Republic (which was finally made official in 1937), which the Unionists opposed. My father asked how this could be and all his friend would say is ""Great man, great man.""

That is even some Unionists in the North of Ireland could see that Collins was a man of principle, a pragmatist, and a person they could deal with. The same could not be said for the pedantic, nit-picking and fiercely Catholic Eamon De Valera.

The final quote in the film says it all: ""It is my considered opinion that in the fullness of time history will recognize the greatness of Michael Collins, and it will do so at my expense"" - Eamon De Valera, 1966.",1350518400,,3898,4.774480712166172

89162,5,0790732521,"I've watched this movie time and time again, and each time there's a nuance I catch that I didn't catch before by one of the truly brilliant actors - Liam Neeson, Stephen Rea, Aidan Quinn and Alan Rickman. At times is can be hard to watch, it's not just a story but a depiction of a time in history of Ireland, the brutality may seem unnecessary to some but the truth of matter is that Ireland was subjected for centuries to the most brutal of regimes as time and time again the British sought to erase the Irish culture, language and traditions and if not their culture wouldn't be erased then they sought to eradicate the Irish themselves. So, will difficult to watch at times, and for some, unbelievable, history books show the truth of the matter was much even more hateful and barbaric.

I do like how the movie subtly addresses the weakness in DeValera - his fear that Collins would achieve what he himself wanted to. What's unspoken is that Collins watched over DeVelara's family, putting his own life on the line for them time and time again, and yet DeValera did him in. History has shown that the deal was done by DeValera to partition Ireland even before Michael Collins set said for England for negotiations. For wasn't it clear that it was DeValera who was the ultimate politician and not Collins? Who choses to send a soldier to negotiate a peace treaty? Only a devious politician seeking to undermine a brilliant and brave general who was a leader among men. I firmly believe that DeValera's new ranking in Irish history is where it belongs now - below that of Michael Collins.

The one blight on this film was the producers idiotic casting of Julia Roberts. They didn't need her 'name' for this film - they had brilliant actors already in place. She's awful, her portrayal of an Irish girl insulting, her acting capabilities are quite sub-par highlighted by the excellent actors she does scenes with. She's like long one big long nail along a chalkboard.

89163,4,0790732521,"This is a very engrossing film about the Irish decolonialization.  Neeson is Collins, an early member of the IRA, who developed a new technique for warfare, the subversive war:  rather than a front and large forces clashing a battle, he brought the war to the individual enemies who were key to colonial power, i.e. informants, local police, and British intelligence officers.  It proved extremely effective.  Once independence was essentially won, according to the film, Collins became a man of peace, negotiating a compromise (leaving Northern Ireland to GB) and selling it to the public in a ratification vote.

The film then turns entirely to politics, where Collins is outdone by treachery.  THis in many ways is the most interesting part of the film, where the once-united IRA breaks into squabbling factions as a sign of the political maturation of the country.  It is very well done, surprising, yet understandable and completely believable.

If there is a weak part to the film, it is the stereotypical romance rivalry involving Julia Roberts, which is a blot of ridiculous melodrama in hollywood style.

I'm no slouch in my Irish history department. That being said, never let history get in the way of a good story, especially if it's being filmed.

Rather than debate the historical inaccuracies, or the lame love story subplot, or Julia Roberts performance, ""Michael Collins"" is a good, solid film, raised up by Liam Neeson as the Big Fella, Alan Rickman as Dev, and solid supporting turns by Aidan Quinn and Stephan Rea. It also looks darn good. Plus it's a serious attempt to unravel 20th century Irish rebellion and civil war. It ain't ""Braveheart"" but it tries hard.

For all it's strengths - and there are many - it doesn't really measure up as an epic. To mention this film in the same sentence as ""David Lean"" is laughable. Rent ""Lawrence of Arabia"" (no slouch itself in historical inaccuracies) or ""Bridge Over the River Kwai"" and THEN watch this film. Not.

Acting aside, it drags on. Attempts too much. Doesn't deliver. Rent ""The Wind That Shakes The Barley"" instead. What ""Michael Collins"" attempts to explain, ""...Barley"" delivers with a gripping story, great acting, and real shots to the heart.

Michael Collins is as much a stew of lies and fairytales as is any movie made by Stone.  the story of the origins of the Irish Civil War is a complete fantasy.  Collins did not head the irish delegation to the talks that led to the Treaty of 1922.  Most reviewers have correctly identified Julia Roberts' laughable performance as the weakest part of the movie. I am no great admirer of Dev, but the sinister caricature presented in this movie is grotesque.  Some reviewers seem to have fallen for the lie that a British armoured car entered Croke Park during a football game and began firing on the crowd.",1299801600,8,800,4.482758620689655

She played her part well. I didn't recognize her for half of the movie.

This role was tailor made for Neeson. I don't think there could of been any other actor that could of done it better then him. He really did the part very well.

89181,4,0790732521,"For a film that is overly long in parts, drug out in others and at times a tad confusing (if you are not familiar with the subject matter) the riveting performances help bolster us along, keeping us more than entertained.  I am obviously not as enthusiastic about the film as a whole as some people here, but I do admit that it is certainly worth your time and Neeson's brilliant performance should have netted him an Oscar.

The film revolves around the Irish Republic and their war with British troops in Ireland.  At times the film can be hard to follow, mainly for those of us not familiar with Irish history.  As far as the history part goes, I was blind walking in.  Either they didn't bother to broach this in my school, or I wasn't paying attention (which could have very well been the case, since history was not a favorite subject of mine).  I'm a little disappointed in myself at that, since I am now rather engaged by history and wish I knew a little more than I do.  That said, the film does a good job of attempting to illuminate us all, even the ones who don't know right from left.  While it never gets down to spelling everything out for us, it does try and give us enough backdrop so that we can draw our own conclusions.  This works and then again doesn't work.  We are drawn into Collins' world (albeit not as richly as I would have liked), but the film does tend to get tiresome at times.

It feels, at moments, to be long winded.

The romantic sub-plot seemed like an afterthought for me.  I wasn't too keen on its inclusion and actually feel that, had it been stripped, the film would have progressed along at a more admirable pace without losing any of the back-story needed to keep the audience informed.

One thing that cannot be knocked is the tremendous acting by (nearly) the entire cast.  Even the small roles filled by the likes of Stephen Rea are fleshed out thanks to some dedicated performances.  Julia Roberts, while suffering from my least favorite `plot point' in the film, delivers an admirable performance, and doe-eyed Aidan Quinn serves as a nice contrast to the righteous indignation dripping off of Neeson.  I actually love Alan Rickman, but I do find it slightly off-putting that he is generally typecast as the `creepy bad guy'.  Yes, his voice is eerie, but some of his best performances come when he is playing totally against type (see his stunning performance in `Sense and Sensibility' and even `Love, Actually').  This is not my favorite performance by him, and in fact I found the `obviousness' about his characters loyalties to be a deterrent to the film itself.

And then there is Liam Neeson, who just commands every frame with a thick fervor that is just engrossing to witness.  He takes this character and makes him so rich and so relatable and in the end so endearing.  You want him to win!

In the end this is definitely a film to see, especially if you are a history buff and or a fan of this genre in particular.  The film maintains a serious and almost espionage tone, which is enjoyable, and the performances by nearly everyone in the cast is more than enough to satisfy the audience.",1276732800,,3147,4.529203539823009

Like why Liam Neeson's Collins and Aidan Quinn's Harry Boland are such great friends and why Alan Rickman's Eamon de Valera fear the both of them working together on the Irish Republican cause. So, my Irish history is rusty and this movie helps fill in some gaps, but I think more of the history of these folks struggle should have been shown.

Julia Roberts' Kitty Kiernan is character who needed further development or she should have hit the cutting room floor. Why is she involved in the cause? Who does she love Michael or Harry? Is she a country lass or a city woman? Why is she in the film again? To me, it seemed like the actors were not as immersed in their roles as they should have been.",1266710400,,871,4.3765432098765435

Alan Rickman plays an unsympathetic Eamon de Valera (does he EVER get to play a sympathetic character?) in fact it's reaching the point were he plays almost every character as the a pseudo version of Alan Rickman.

The picture itself is epic and beautiful it seems to emphasize the dark, this is very proper since it is a dark tale of a tough time of struggle violence and murder.

The tone and the color of the movie subtlety changes when it seems peace has come but starts to change back as the Irish civil war breaks out and it reverts back to the same tough time of violence and murder but directed even more by the Irish against the Irish.

The story here is more Collins than Ireland's so he is the protagonist and is made so. One can debate how much history there is in it but to critique it for being so is not really proper.

Liam Neeson, did an outstanding job in portraying the Irish leader, Michael Collins, intelligent, highly motivated and passionate about what he was trying to attain, almost to a fault. (Note:  of course I expected no less from the actor - excellent in whatever he portrays).  The movie sheds light on a bit of Irish history regarding the IRB and IRA; the fight to break British total rule over Ireland, and Michael Collins efforts to accomplish this.  The movie should be watched closely , noting, that there was a split among the Irish people and in the end, it was the Irish against Irish (which seems to be ongoing, to some extent,even today).  I had seen/rented the movie before, but it's the kind of movie I can watch again and again.  I enjoyed it that much.  So, I decided to purchase the DVD from Amazon for my own library. When I received the DVD, I immediately watch it over again,twice.  If you are interested in anything regarding a bit of Ireland's history, or the history of the IRB/IRA,I recommend you buy this movie.

89189,4,0790732521,"Michael Collins is quite possibly Irish director Neil Jordan's most powerful film. The problem is that the film was not widely seen on its release in 1997. Over time the film has lost some of the controvery surrounding it and viewed in retrospect stands as a tribute to Jordan's storytelling art.

Liam Neeson portrays the Irish revolutionary and statesman Michael Collins at the pivotal timeperiod 1916 until 1922. The film covers ground between the Easter uprising and the leader's death six years later. The cast is excellent and features Aiden Quinn as Harry Boland, Alan Rickman as Irish Republican President Eamon de Valera. If there is a weakness in the casting it is in the part of love interest Kitty Kearnan played by a very American sounding Julia Roberts.

The film has been criticized because Jordan changed some events to make the story flow better. I don't see this as a problem. All history involves revision depending on the author's take on the story. Many will compare this film to Mel Gibson's Braveheart but I feel that this is overall a better film.

A minor issue comes in the presentation. The film was an early release from Warner Brothers and the movie is contained on a double sided single layer flipper disc whicc calls for flipping with only about 30 minutes remaining in the film. The disc contains an episode of the London Weekend Television series The Southbank Show which is a quite good special feature. The documentary runs for about 50 minutes and covers both Collins' life and the production. For an evening  of historical drama you can't beat this one.

Maybe that's true he did. In any event, this is a motion picture that barely made a ripple in America but was received by most of my family in Ireland with about the same surge of grateful joy that Braveheart got in Scotland.

Collins' bravado, good humor, ingenious strategic savvy and ultimately his pragmatism in doing what needed to be done in his meetings with former enemies is all covered here, as is his treacherous murder at the hands of his own one-time comrades in the IRA.

First, the cast is excellent with the likes of; Liam Neeson (as Michael Collins), Aidan Quinn, Alan Rickman, Stephen Rea and Julia Roberts. There's even a short appearance at the end of the film by Jonathan Rhys Meyers. With such a cast in place it's no wonder that the acting superior and highly believable.

89252,5,0790732521,"Rarely does a movie have as much historic accuracy, political insight, character development, and dramatic action as does this film.

The film covers 6 highly chaotic and transitional years in Ireland, from the 1916 Easter Rising in Dublin to the 1922 assassination of Michael Collins in Cork County.

Many Americans, even if they are of Irish ancestry, know little of Irish history, particularly the relationship between Ireland and England. Since the reigns of Henry VIII and Elizabeth I there has been domination of the Irish people by the English government. After almost 400 years of domination, the rise of the Irish Republic was an amazing accomplishment. Much of that accomplishment must be attributed to Michael Collins, the founder of the Irish Republic Army, and the master strategist in the first 6 years of the rebellion. The film takes us through the final hours of the Easter Rising where the English military suppresses one of the first uprisings and challenges to their authority. The film shows the firing squad executions, one by one, of the leaders of the uprising. The film takes us to the guerilla tactics of Michael Collins, with an emphasis on killing the English leadership in Ireland. As the English send more and more ruthless enforcers of England's power, the IRA carefully kills them and creates chaos in their administration. Michael becomes a national hero but his first diplomatic mission is in some ways a set up. This leads to the political intrigue within the film.

The character of Eamon De Valera, the man who was repeatedly elected President of Ireland, is indeed complex as the film demonstrates. De Valera sends Collins to negotiate with the British under the explanation that Collins has earned this priviledge andthat the English wish to know who is so they can negotiate face to face. Michael is not able to negotiate for the independence of all of Ireland, primarily because the English wished to hold Northern Ireland where the majority of English protestant settlers had lived for generations after generations. However, De Valera refuses to accept a partial victory, undermining Collins' leadership and popularity with many of the Irish people. Very crafty thinking and manipulating were involved in this sequence of events. Was De Valera actually that Machiavellian?  The film would indicate so.

The acting is superb, with Lian Neeson, Alan Rickman, Stephen Rea, Ian Hart, Aiden Quinn, and Jonathan Rhys Meyer offering first class performances. Julia Roberts takes an understated back seat which serves the film well. Neeson is indeed highly powerful as the robust manly decisive Collins, a man who goes from being a street fighting terrorist to a hero and statesman. Rickman is super as De Valera. He plays De Valera as calculating, never revealing his whole hand, and extremely strategic. Especially strategic was De Valera's trip to the USA to gain funds and support from Irish Americans. Ian Hart plays Collins' right hand assistant through thick and thin. Hart is superb here. Aiden Quinn plays Harry Boland, a friend of Collins' who competes with him for Julia Robert's affection and then turns on him during the Irish Civil War. A young brash handsome Jonathan Rhys Meyer plays the young assassing who kills Collins as he comes to Cork to negotiate with De Valera. There is so much history to relate that the director and writers wisely de-emphasized the romantic in favor of the historic.

While it is not all inclusive to the trials he faced in the establishment of the Irish Republic, as well as the war against the British Occupation, it does cover the main players in the movement up to his assasination. I was rather disappointed that they did not elaborate more on the treaty talks with the British and the key players involved in the Irish envoy to London, as well as the people involved in the treaty talks for the British. Overall, the movie was very moving and very entertaining, however understanding the Irish movement will require further study by the individual.",1151280000,3,658,4.780701754385965
89256,5,0790732521,"Like Braveheart, Michael Collins captures all the passion and drama of the struggle for freedom and independence from an oppressive ruler (in both cases, the British.)  Also like Braveheart, this movie tends to excessively glorify the hero and demonize the villains.  Of course, it achieves the effect of distinguishing the good guys from the bad, giving the audience a (clear) side to pick.

It is beautifully shot, well-scripted and suspenseful.  It's also fairly accurate historically, the costumes and sets are spot-on, and there is adequate (and appropriate) lightheartedness.  The battle scenes are riveting and the movie is loaded with (true) cloak-and-dagger bits.  The love triangle between Michael Collins (Liam Neeson), Kitty Kiernan (Julia Roberts) and Harry Boland (Aidan Quinn), though somewhat indispensable to the ""Big Fella's"" story, muddles things in spots.  Neil Jordan managed to make the romance fit in the story without forcing it or resorting to too much sappiness.

For the most part, the acting is very good.  Neeson plays the ""Big Fella"" about as well as one could imagine.  Stephen Rea is nothing short of awesome and shows why he is, unfortunately, one of the most under-appreciated actors around.  The rest of the cast performs adequately or better.

All that said, its weaknesses are fairly apparent.  One, Mr. Jordan surely could have found an Irish actress to play Kitty Kiernan.  Instead, we're subjected to Julia Roberts' lousy Irish accent.  At that time Michael Collins came out, Roberts was in a lot of movies and picking her - a Yankee, no less - for this part seemed as yet another instance of having her forced upon the viewing public.  Two, the movie oversimplifies issues regarding the Irish struggle for independence.  Of course, a movie is not necessarily the venue in which to explain all sides to an issue, but if you knew nothing of Irish history and saw this film, you'd think that Ireland's troubles solely resulted from the arbitrary actions of her oppressive English overlords.

Michael Collins is a fantastic movie, one of my all-time favorites.  Even with its flaws, it's a classic.",1149552000,6,2135,5.118497109826589
89257,3,0790732521,"I think this movie can be summed up in two simple words: long and violent. But fascinating nonetheless. Neal Jordan takes a somewhat biased look at the life of Michael Collins, and I think he tried his damnest to keep to history. But something missed it's mark in the movie, I can't quite sum it up. It may have been a couple of cliches I could have done without. Example: an impending death. Cut to a loved one either wandering around ignorantly or rushing to the aid, although we know it's in vain. Collins' death scene, in particular, was ruined by cutting back to Julia Roberts trying on wedding dresses, and then suddenly staring in the mirror. SHE KNOWS. Or it may have been Julia's run of the mill performance with her VERY BAD irish accent. And surprisingly Aidan Quinn slipped quite a bit, though his acting was passable. Other than Ms. Roberts, the casting was stellar, Liam Neeson, Aidan Quinn, Stephen Rea, and the always wonderful Alan Rickman. The extras aren't too bad, the always present biographies, and filmographies, and a nifty documentary on the real man himself.

Michael Collins is a good movie to see if you want to gain a little knowledge of Irish history. However, there is unfortunately little else of note that makes this movie worth sitting for two hours. Aside from the very talented Stephen Rea's work, the acting is terrible. Aidan Quinn seems to forget at times that he's supposed to have an Irish accent, and even when he remembers his accent sounds terrible.  It is an important story, but difficult to translate to film, and Jordan did what he could with his resources. In the hands of a lesser writer/director, the film could have been disastrous. If you really have nothing else to do, it wouldn't hurt to watch this movie, but don't expect a masterpiece. Julia Roberts was a huge miscast in this film.. very poor choice.

89260,4,0790732521,"This powerful epic bounds you along with constant energy.  The fast pace of this movie often makes it difficult to follow at times.  Often this film feels like an action movie, and a slightly slower pace might have improved its production. One could also benefit from a healthy background of modern Irish History as well in order to follow the film better, and to see where it goes off the mark.  Almost all historical epics like this take liberties with the interpretation of events.  This movie certainly does so with a heavy hand at times.

Neeson is first-rate as Michael Collins, no doubts about that.  He portrays the energy and strength of the ""Big Fellow"" with great gusto.  Its probably one of his best roles.  Alan Rickman plays a very dark De Valera, and thats where the film gets into some difficulties.  Implied here is that De Valara sought to destroy Collins.  While this is exaggeration the film shows how divided Irish sentiment was over the creation of ther Irish Free-State in 1921-22.  The film does a very good job at portraying these events in rapid, hectic fashion, which again can be difficult for the average viewer to follow.

The British are as usual portrayed as Nazi's, or something quite close to that.  The heavy hand with which the director shows the British side of the story is indeed unfortunate.  Something more balanced in this regard would have made the film more mature in its outlook.

All the actors save Julia Roberts put in fine perfomances.  I don't know why the ""American Beauty"" is portraying an Irish femme in this film.  A fair actress from Erin's shores surely could have done her role more justice.  The production qaulity is first-rate, and while there is some distortion of history, the average viewer will certainly get an idea of the complexity of Irish history from seeing this good film.  Some reading on The Irish War and the Irish Civil War of the 1920s would also help.

This movie is based on true history and fact when it comes to ireland becoming indpendent from england and how evil and brutal the english really are and how the irish including myself were affected by that cruelty so badly that it caused a whole war in ireland against the british nazi occupation of the emerald isle. this is true to the heart. England had never been in ireland or involved with ireland there would have been no IRA. England created the violence in ireland not the other way around. Eamon de valera said and i quote ""better to die as martyrs for freedom than to be the ones who make martyrs like the english"" ' He did not have the stomach for violence and hatred but he had more heart about how to handle the situation.

89265,5,0790732521,"Some ""Collins"" updates are worth mentioning, esp. for film historians, e.g., the presence of a very young Jonathan Rhys-Meyers in a brief but pivotal role in this film, an early major break in his career. Also worth mentioning that this winter, Neil Jordan is back with a film, Breakfast on Pluto, with many of the Michael Collins cast, including Brendan Gleeson, Liam Neeson and Stephen Rea, the latter a standout in that film as well as in 'Michael Collins.' Indeed, Mr. Rea's work in Michael Collins is worth re-viewing as great understated acting -- his Ned Broy is really quite touching (compare with Rea's role as a detective in ""Citizen X"" -- he's good in those parts).

(Update, April 2006: Stephen Rea appears in the new release ""V for Vendetta"" -- as a detective.)

It's also worth analyzing this story, as a story, in the post-9/11 world. Although the movie says little about the vicious war in the countryside, between the Black and Tans and Collins' flying columns -- mind you, it does have him telling them to fight on their own terms, a central tactic in any unconventional (asymmetric) conflict -- it does have him emphasizing the need to capture arms to sustain the struggle. (Touched on later when his agents return from a hit, show him the newspaper headline, Detective Riddled With Bullets, and his angry reaction, "" 'Riddled?' 'Riddled?!!' What're you goin' round riddlin' people for? 10 or 20 bullets when the one will do? ... They don't grow on trees!"")

This sort of conflict -- whether or not you want to call it ""terrorist"" -- does get argued out in the film, and not just as a depiction of a brutish military response by the Black and Tans. Eamonn de Valera is also shown as an advocate for the old conventional clash of arms, e.g., the attack on the Customs House, arguing against a Michael Collins wanting to ""play by our own rules."" The film rightly makes a central incident of the killing of the British detectives, for Collins seemed to have grasped that detectives, in an urban war, are not just combatants but central to this kind of conflict. Bloody Sunday, the day Michael Collins effectively blinded the British Secret Service, and a central sequence in this film, seems to have been a turning point, leaving the other side with nothing but the Black and Tans -- the sports-field reprisal was perhaps not historically accurate but as a metaphor it works. In a conflict like post-9/11 any intelligence -- police intelligence, financial intelligence, ""names, addresses, clubs, society columns, where they bank, down to what they eat for breakfast,"" (Collins' comment) is crucial to success for such a movement. Or to hunting it down.

In fairness to Julia Roberts, it's worth noting that she was hobbled by a peripheral role, subdued dialogue and the hideous fashions of the day -- not to mention the centrality of the friendship, and falling-out, of Harry Boland and Michael Collins. (She might have had a far meatier role if Mr. Jordan had cast her as the fiery rebel Countess Markiewicz, arguably the La Pasionaria of that day).

89268,5,0790732521,"An excellent movie even if some important facts e.g. 1918 election which legitimised the Old IRA back then were omitted.

We were a colony in the sense that we had never consented incorporation into the UK. The Irish Parliament that voted the Union through in 1800 was exclusively a Protestant one, the Catholic majority (80%) having been banned from it. Also, the parliament was bribed with money, land and titles to get it to vote for Union. And the Loyalist UVF also brought in arms and ammunition from Germany through the port of Larne, Co. Antrim, including over a million rounds of ammunition and 35,000 rifles. The difference being that the British army left them alone when the guns were being brought in but opened fire when the Irish Volunteers (previous name of the Old IRA) brought in arms - far fewer by the way. And anyway, the UVF was formed before the IRA to resist Home Rule by force, so it wasn't just our side that was setting up armies to resist UK law. Also, you say the Home Rulers were elected and that the IRA ""seized power"". In fact, in the 1918 elections (unfortunately not covered in the movie), the Home Rulers went from 73 MPs to 6, and SF took all the lost seats. So there was clearly a democratic mandate to break away from Britain.

Collins was not a terrorist because the mark of a terrorist is the intentional targeting of innocent civilians, which he did not do. In fact after independence and during the Southern Civil War against the Anti-Treaty IRA, the Irish Government actually established security-forces to protect Southern Protestants, e.g. in Co. Louth. I reject your claim about 140,000 Protestants being driven out. 50,000 of those who left were in the British army or in the families of their soldiers and were relocated to Northern Ireland. After the US became independent, a lot of former Loyalists left for Canada. After colonies become independent, many of those formerly loyal to the old regime tend to leave the country. The same happened in the former Soviet states where millions of ethnic-Russians have moved to the Russian Federation, e.g. in Kazakhstan, the Russian population has fallen from over 50% to 30%. So this is not unique to Ireland. Many Protestants did leave Southern Ireland after partition, but in the main this was voluntary and based on a feeling of not being at home in a state where they would be in the minority, and because they were mainly Unionists who wanted to live in the part of Ireland remaining in the UK. If we were to follow your line of reasoning, does this mean that Northern Irish Catholics were well treated by the Belfast Parliament from 1922-72. as the Catholic population there has grown from 31% to 41%? Certainly most historians would strongly disagree, considering the gerrymandering, discrimination in housing, burning down of Catholic areas e.g. Bombay Street in the 1960's, and the continued ethnic-cleansing of Irish Catholics from places like Carrickfergus, Larne and Ahoghill in Co. Antrim. As late as 1993, Catholics were only 7% of the RUC (the police), and the Loyalist terror group the UDA, which has killed hundreds of Catholics, was a legal organisation until 1990. The British security forces in Northern Ireland colluded with Loyalist terror groups to murder Catholics, as shown in the Stevens Report. The Stevens Inquiry was commissioned by the British government but several attempts were made to sabotage the investigation, including arson.

The primary reason for the decline in the Protestant population in the South is a consistent pattern of Protestants marrying Catholics, with the children having tended until recently to have been brought up as Catholics under the Ne Temere Decree of the Catholic Church requiring this. As the Catholic Church's influence has dissipated in recent years following scandals, the Protestant population is growing again. This graph [...]

illustrates the decline in the Southern Irish Protestant population, and contrasts with your assertions on 140,000 Protestants leaving the State shortly after independence. As shown, their % of the South's population started at 10% (300,000). 140,000 would constitute a 50% decline to 5%. However, the 5% figure was only reached around 1950. This does not support the theory of mass-expulsions in the years immediately proceeding 1921 and independence, therefore.

Regarding Irish people who fought in WW1, most Catholics doing so did this because the Home Rule leader, John Redmond, argued it would influence Britain to look more favourably on the demand for 32 county Home Rule instead of partitioning Ireland, as well as Redmond's drawing of parallels between Ireland and Belgium - countries that were both trying to attain their freedom (from Germany in Belgium's case). Hence, in both senses, Catholics joining the British army felt they were fighting for the ""freedom of small nations"". They were certainly not fighting to preserve the oppressive British empire.",1131667200,12,4959,5.057457212713937
89269,5,0790732521,"Ireland was in fact NOT a colony. Irish voters were six times over represented in the British Houses of Parliament. A colony cannot vote in home elections. The IRA were a separatist movement who were an offshoot of the IRB - puppets of the Catholic Nationalist movement created effectively by the Irish Catholic church.

The film ""Michael Collins"" was in fact a an exercise in propaganda. The IRA were armed by Kaiser Wilhelm with money collected in the united states. $11M to buy guns collected by

DeValera - a U.S. citizen. The home rule bill for Ireland was aleady passed so effectively home rule would have occurred immediately following the end of the great war. Redmonds

Irish Parliamentary party represented the nationalist element and following the IRA's taking of power (the biggest mistake

of any British government) 140,000 protestants were driven from their homes. The result being the escalation of antipathy and the permanent partition of Ireland. The architects of Irish Nationalism were in fact the Catholic Church.

The Collins film also insinuated that ""they would be sent to the Somme"". Conscription didn't happen in Ireland - so that was another misrepresentation. To the Irish soldiers of the British Army who volunteered to fight for the liberty of Europe this film was a massive insult. Padraig Pearse was in fact preparing to put Kaiser Wilhelms nephew on a throne and proclaim him King of Ireland; draw your own conclusion as to what they intended to be the outcome of WWI.

The Home Rulers were democratically represented and Collins was a terrorist. No doubt about it. You go into  someones home and blown their brains out when they are not armed its murder. No amount of re-writing of history can say he wasn't a terrorist and they then caused a civil war and plunged Ireland into the dark ages until DeValeras death. DeValera was also the man who sent his condolences on the Death of Adolf Hitler. Again draw your own conclusions. If thats not the actions of twisted fanatics what is.

89270,5,0790732521,"I disagree with the person saying that ""Ireland was not a colony"". A tactic of imperial powers has historically been to legitimise their rule over a colony by officially annexing the territory into the state. That allows them to say afterwards that such a place is not a colony but part of the overall stste etc. England (the predecessor the Britain) conquered Ireland in 1169 because a traitor called Dermot McMurrough (also known as Dermot na Gal - Dermot of the Foreigners) invited them in during a power struggle with the High King of Ireland Rory O'Connor.

I also object to the claim made by a user from Houston TX that Collins was a terrorist. Most countries on the map today would not exist today but for insurrection against an imperial power e.g. South and Central America broke away from Spain, the US broke away from Britain, African countries often only became independent after revolts. In the main, the Old IRA (1919-21) as distinct from the later IRA's (Anti-Treaty IRA, CIRA, RIRA, PIRA) did not target civilians. It is true that collaborators with the British government were targetted. However, the same was true in Vichy France where the French Resistance attacked collaborators with the regime.

Kevin Costner's attempts resulted in some equally simplistic scripts that enshrined cliche over history before Warners decided to drop his version in favor of Neil Jordan's long-planned film. Even if they were motivated more by the success of Interview With the Vampire than the material, they made the right choice: Michael Collins is easily one of Jordan's very best films and a strikingly intelligent piece of political cinema. There are changes for dramatic purposes, but these generally seem made for sound reasons and don't change the essential truth of the Irish Republican hero who became a scapegoat for de Valera's failure to gain a Republic and ended up being assassinated by his former colleagues in Ireland's forgotten and bloody civil war.

Clocking in at little over 130 minutes, Jordan keeps a sense of momentum that occasionally loses the odd detail that would be helpful to audiences unfamiliar with Irish history (such as the way the popular hatred towards the rebels who fought in the Easter Rising was turned around by the disastrous decision of the British to execute its leaders) but which still manages to find room for character as well, personalizing the tragedy surprisingly effectively. One of the last historical epics to use real sets and real extras instead of CGI, the film feels grounded in reality while still being an enthralling and cinematic political thriller. Sinead O'Connor's screaming over the assassination scene is unhelpful, but even that can't destroy the film.

Keeping his promise to cast Liam Neeson despite heavy lobbying from Michael Collins lookalike Kenneth Branagh (who lacks the presence necessary for the part), Jordan gets good rather than great performances from his leads, although Alan Rickman nails de Valera's  reptilian and hesitant delivery and Ian Hart impresses as one of Collins' lieutenants. The unwelcome presence of Julia Roberts threatens to turn the film into Hollywood but thankfully her extremely limited abilities aren't stretched to breaking point. Probably the only film about the IRA that protestants and Brits can see without bringing Molotov cocktails to the cinema, it's release fell foul of America's constant denial of the complexities of the situation, Ireland's denial of the civil war and the rest of the world's horror at the IRA breaking their ceasefire without warning and killing a little girl in the process.

It is simply a major achievement in cinematic art.

The brief life of Michael Collins (he was killed when he was but 31 years of age) completely changed the history of Ireland and the British rule of that country. Collins introduced the democracy of the Irish Republic and ended a long era of fighting and rebellion.  A man of passionate convictions and mesmerizing idealism and compassion, Collins' memory is still regarded by both the Irish and the British as a 20th century hero.

The brilliant script is placed in the exceptionally competent hands of Liam Neeson as Collins with top flight support from Stephan Rea, Aidan Quinn, Alan Rickman, Jonathan Rhys-Meyers, Charles Dance, and yes, even Julia Roberts!

Collins' actions were pointless as Ireland would have had

home government without the 80 subsequent years of Bloodshed

caused by the stream of propaganda aimed at self justification.

2. Collins only returned to Ireland as he was due to be

conscripted having been living in London for 12 years. It

was alleged that he could have gone to live with his brother

in Chicago .. could he have afforded the ticket to go ?

3. Ireland was NOT a colony but part of the UK so effectively

the implications of Irish ""separation"" from Britain were

wide ranging. There have been similar nationalist movements

since from Wales, Scotland etc.

4. The film ""implied"" there was conscription in Ireland

- there wasn't at any point.

5. The film ""implied"" there wasn't a democratic process -

there was.

6. It failed to point out that the guns supplied to the

pro-crown loyalists and similarly the nationalists came

from the Kaiser in an attempt to keep Britian out of the

First World war. So the current situation in Ireland

was not forced by the IRA but more as a consequence of a tired

nation just wanting to settle a thorn in its side. Ireland

wasnt being oppressed in any way.

7. Ireland was part of Britain (see note 3.) and is still

represented on the Union Flag.

8. It failed to point out that the incident in the

gaelic football match was a direct knee jerk response to

the murder of the ""alleged"" Cairo gang who it was never

proved were anything other army officers.

9. Sinn Fein never won the 1918 elections. They were ballot

box rigged and the opposition were intimidated into not

standing against them by murder and so forth. Only Sinn Feins

bully boys had guns.

10. It failed to point out COMPLETELY the unionist perspective.

11. The main issue in the insurgents being executed was

that they themselves agreed to being treated more harshly

on the grounds that their men be given clemency.

12. The executions of 14 leaders of the 1916 rising were

fair and square. Their actions as traitors to their government

could have seriously damaged morale in the coming battle

of the Somme and they were most likely executed for that

reason alone, not out of spite as it seemed to imply.

13. It also failed to point out that the 11 million dollars

raised in the united states by DeValera to arm and pay these

men salary during the unfolding events.

14. No mention whatsoever of the Irish Nationalist party

and the fact that Irish MP's were several times over

represented in Westminster.

Good film .. but extremely one sided. Written from the

Nationalist perspective.",1118534400,7,2826,4.65173116089613
89279,5,0790732521,"Recently I have read reviews on this film on amazon which made me laugh out loud. this film has no similarities to 9/11 whatsoever. Michael Collins was in no way a terrorist as all his actions were aimed at the British occupational troops and not the Irish people. In fact if certain people had consulted their history books before writing, they would see that it was in fact the British(the supposed bastion of democracy of the time) who comitted the various attrocities such as the cold blooded murder of 12 innocent people on November 21, 1920 who had no connection to the ""war of independence "". It was only later that the IRA moved into terriorism. The sub-sequent attrocities carried out on innocent people in the UK and the North would never have been advocated or supported by the original founders of the organisation. So folks please stop with these ignorant and laughable reviews. Oh and by the way, I really enjoyed the movie and thourhaghlly recommend it.",1118102400,4,968,4.767857142857143
89280,2,0790732521,"First of all, a few misunderstandings which a few previous reviewers highlighted:

The Old IRA of the War of Independence were not 'terrorists', as you may find out by looking up definitions of terrorism. Guerrilla wars may involve terrorist actions; however, the war is not directed against the population (naturally enough, because they are supporting the movement) but against the force of occupation. There is (contrary to the assertions of some posters here) no comparison to be drawn with September 11. However, this film blurs these obvious distinctions.

Collins was never, as Jordan misleadingly implies and indeed declares, the leader or creator of the IRA, neither was he the inventor of modern guerrilla warfare. His role in the Irish war of liberation was certainly considerable, but considering the nature of the guerrilla campaign in Ireland, one man was never likely to control it.

This film cannot decide whether it is a 'biopic', a drama or a thriller, and the story, burdened with this indecision, becomes sloppy, confused and sometimes ridiculous. Jordan appears to think that the period of 1919-21 is directly analagous to the later war in Northern Ireland. He seems to suffer under the apprehension that he cannot sympathise with the IRA who fought one of the 20th century's most notorious terrorist gangs, the Auxiliaries/Black and Tans, because to do so would be to sympathise with the modern-day Provisional IRA. On the other hand, he sympathises with his protagonist.

Much of the story's confused feel is owing to this; some also to the fact that he also feels that the antagonist demanded of a drama cannot be English. Hence the raw deal served out to de Valera. It has been suggested that making de Valera's character so despicable eliminates the chance that both Collins's and de Valera's characters would become more complex in relation to the other's. If de Valera is a one-dimensional villain, so Collins too remains static, never generating much sympathy in spite of Liam Neeson's admirable attempts. Similarly, characters such as Harry Boland and Cathal Brugha are mere ciphers of Collins and de Valera's conflict.

The decision to exclude negotiations with the British, possibly necessary in view of Jordan's decision to prevent anyone other than de Valera becoming an antagonist, is a serious gap in the audience's understanding of the issues involved. (You can't just say: ""Ah Mick, you signed the treaty! You accepted partition!"" and leave it at that.)

Jordan's portrayal of the decision by Collins to accept the treaty as a heroic attempt to promote peace merely adds to the confusion. He apparently has no problem in using English heavy artillery against his compatriots (and on the order of the British government, let us not forget), but when they fight back, it is a dreadful crime, laden with furtive connivings and hints of murder. Jordan's claim that he did not intend to link de Valera with Collins's death is unconvincing. If the character termed 'Collins' Assassin' is seen acting with de Valera's permission and under his orders, what conclusion does he expect the audience to draw?

There is a frantic energy to the direction which engages the attention, and occasionally the admiration. It raises the speculation that had Jordan (evidently following genre conventions, but not sure which one to stick with) made a decision as to what kind of film he was making, and perhaps decided not to try to explain 20th century Irish history in the gaps between intelligence intrigue and an appalling love story, we might have had a decent film. As it is, the good scenes are too few and far between to make it worth watching, unless some nice cinematography can be said to rescue it.",1114214400,5,3728,5.042207792207792
89281,4,0790732521,"Michael Collins is a fine historical film that essentially captures the life and times of the Irish hero who founded the Irish Republican Army and became the first man since George Washington to force the British Empire to the negotiating table.  The production values are very high and the acting is very good.  There are a few liberties taken with historical accuracy but most of these are for dramatic effect and do not detract from the overall historical perspective of the film.

The film has gained additional importance since 9/11 and for this reason should be viewed by all Americans concerned with our current conflict in the Middle East.  There is no way of getting around the fact that Michael Collins was a terrorist and that he founded the first modern terror organization.  The film can be used as a study of how terror can successfully be used to obtain political ends, in this case independence for Ireland.  It also demonstrates just how difficult it is to defeat an insurrection of this kind, even for the greatest military power on Earth.  The film thus becomes a very important warning for the American public, and policy makers in Washington, concerning our current war in Iraq.  Collins is presented as a sympathetic character who most Americans will root for; certainly not a bad guy like Osama bin Laden.  But remember, there are a large number of people in the world, especially in the Asia, for whom Osama is a sympathetic hero.  Both he and Collins fight the same kind of war against similar enemies.  Will Osama, like Collins, win in the end?  I certainly hope not, but then I am speaking from the perspective of a 21st century American.  And if I were an early 20th century Englishman or American, having just fought a bloody world war to make the world safe for democracy,  I certainly might have regarded Collins as representing the antithesis of my values.

So my advice is definitely to view Michael Collins.  It is an excellent and exciting action film with a very sympathetic hero who was largely responsible for founding the Republic of Ireland.  But then keep in mind that we are now engaged in a life and death struggle with enemies that have similar aims, use similar tactics, and, like Collins, will stop at nothing to achieve their ends.

A little bit about my own background, I am a non-Irish American (unless you go back about 300 years) who has lived and traveled in Ireland and has close ties with that country.  I have also read a great deal of Irish history.  I think this gives me a different perspective on Ireland's conflict with the British Empire from someone who is either Irish or from a family recently immigrated from Ireland.  Having read the other Amazon reviews of this movie, I am somewhat amused with those (few) who seem to have hated it.  They seem to fall into two major categories.  The first are the die-hard Sinn Fein-IRA types who cannot forgive Collin's compromise with the British.  The other categories are those die-hard Unionists who cannot forgive the fact that Collins beat the British Empire!  Get a grip guys!",1105228800,2,3086,4.74484052532833
89282,4,0790732521,"This movie was one of the suggestions I selected from an Amazon ""page I just created""  list.  Having an Irish background, I am sad to say I did not know who Michael Collins was before I purchased this movie.  So I took a look at it from both an educational and entertainment point of view.  In the end I felt it did both, educate and entertain.

Overall I thought the casting was just OK.  I liked Liam Neeson and Aidan Quinn, however I didn't care for Julia Roberts as the Kitty Kiernan character for some reason.  I liked the story-line, but I am not sure as to the historical accuracy of this portrayal.  The overall story seemed to have a few gaps in it.

If you enjoy movies like The Patriot, Braveheart, and Gladiator and are looking for entertainment versus authenticity then this is a movie for you.",1101254400,6,807,4.398648648648648
89283,4,0790732521,"In an episode of the 1980's cop drama ""Miami Vice,"" Liam Neeson put in an appearance as an IRA terrorist-or at least I think he did if memory serves me correctly. Perhaps his depiction of an Irish tough on television laid the foundation for his work in Neil Jordan's 1996 bio pic ""Michael Collins."" The 1990s saw several films about the ""Troubles,"" the word often used to describe the unremitting conflict in Northern Ireland, arrive in theaters. Maybe the hopes of a lasting peace in the troubled region during the last decade, as the IRA agreed to lay down their arms on several occasions, inspired Hollywood. I don't know. Whatever the case, armchair fans of Ireland had plenty to look at in the Cineplex for a few years. While I haven't seen most of these films, I have seen ""Michael Collins"" several times over the last eight years, and it is difficult to imagine any of these other pictures surpassing this one in any way, shape, or form. Jordan's picture is an inspired piece of work, a beautiful yet politically complex look at how the IRA came to function as an urban guerilla operation in their efforts to secure a unified Ireland free of British oversight and influence.

The film starts on a dramatic tone as Irish rebels battle British troops in the Easter Uprising of 1916. This rebellion fails despite the fact that most of England's resources are tied up in the war raging on the continent. Most of the upstarts-including Michael Collins (Neeson), Harry Boland (Aidan Quinn), and Eamon de Valera (Alan Rickman)-march off to lengthy prison sentences. The perceived ringleaders aren't as lucky: the British line up most of these chaps against the wall and gun them down. Eamon de Valera is one of the few higher ups to survive in large part because he was born in America. With their leadership decimated, Collins and his associates await their release dates so they can continue the fight with the British. It doesn't take long for the rebels to reconstitute a command structure once they get out, but the failed revolt has left its mark on many of the participants. Two schools of strategy emerge concerning future operations for freedom. De Valera and others seek to once again arise and duke it out with the English just as they did in 1916. Collins knows this option will lead to another loss and further prison sentences. He supports taking the war underground by resorting to guerilla warfare in the streets and alleys of Ireland. By striking and then hiding, Collins believes the Irish movement has a much better chance of forcing the British to the bargaining table.

Collins gets his chance to launch a bloody campaign against the British when the Irish leadership heads off to jail again. With the assistance of Harry Boland, he persuades groups of young toughs to raid armories for weapons. He also manages to acquire the secret loyalty of an Irish cop working for the British, Ned Broy (Stephen Rea), to allow him access to the mountains of police files on Irish resistance groups. With an inside view of what the English will do before they even do it, Collins's campaigns of violence become amazingly effective. His boys wipe out a special detachment of Brits sent in to quell unrest. They assassinate police officers and officials. Collins is generally safe from the authorities due to a host of reasons, the least of which include his support from the people and the fact that the cops have no clue what he looks like. How the British didn't know Michael Collins on sight considering he spent time in jail is something I can't explain, but nonetheless his terror missions serve their purpose. The British seek a resolution to the conflict, and Eamon de Valera charges Collins with the task of acting as the Irish emissary. This decision is an adroit political move on de Valera's part, and one that has lasting and violent consequences for the future of Ireland.

I liked everything about ""Michael Collins"" even though the movie suffers under the onerous burden of two key problems. First, the entire subplot involving Harry Boland, Collins, and an Irish lass named Kitty Kiernan (Julia Roberts) tends to grate. I'm sure the studio insisted on putting a romance theme in the movie in order to sell more tickets and to temper the strident political message, but doing so detracts from the power of the film. Second, historical accuracy occasionally flies out the window in lieu of dramatic license. Witness the sporting event where the British drive an armored car onto the field and promptly gun down the athletes and fire into the crowd. The documentary on the film appended to the DVD discusses this depiction in some depth, and even Jordan admits the event didn't happen exactly the way he portrayed it. But what's good works wonders. Neeson is magnificent as the revolutionary both brutal in his outrages and horrified at the results. Rickman plays de Valera with a sinister silkiness. These two actors are so good at what they do that Rea and Quinn often fade into the background. The locations and set pieces look authentic.

Unfortunately, the extras don't live up to the film. You get a trailer and the aforementioned documentary (which does run for nearly an hour, at least) and that's it. I would have taken the DVD release of this film as an excuse to add a bunch of information about the Irish struggle for independence. C'est la vie, I guess. Whatever the case, the movie is definitely worth the price of the DVD. ""Michael Collins"" is a film I watch whenever I get the chance, and I will continue to do so well into the future.",1095552000,40,5571,4.769948186528498
89284,5,0790732521,"Not being Irish, and being ignorant of the true history of the IRA and the conflict between England and Ireland, I cannot hope to offer any guidance as to the historical accuracy of this movie, nor its bias (or lack of it), but if you watch the documentary on this DVD you will see that the Director (Neil Jordan) himself says that some of the incidents in the movie were slightly changed. However that is to be expected of most movies that try to present history in an entertaining way.

And entertaining it is. Divorced from the reality from which it is based, the movie makes excellent drama; you have the classical David and Goliath scenario here with the British Empire being brought to its knees by a handful of very amateur assassins. I thought Liam Neelson was great as Collins and so was the 'supporting' cast, with the exception of Julia Roberts. I don't think you can help but make comparisons between this movie and Braveheart. While I was watching it, I imagined Collins being the modern day Irish equivalent of that old Scottish hero.

As other reviewers have mentioned, if you want to know more about the history of this struggle, it would be best to hit the history books rather than the play button. But if you want an entertaining film that gives you a rough idea of who Michael Collins was and what he stood for; this is as good a film as any.",1090972800,5,1362,4.487903225806452

89286,5,0790732521,"I'd usually steer well clear of films with alot of death in them (half because it turns my stomach, and half because it's so fake) but Michael Collins has to be an exception. This film is just so *real* in some parts. You can credibly believe the cruelty being doled out by both sides - neither Irish or English side is idolized as being the righteous one - and the pure shock will have you shaking just as much as the characters on screen.
The relationships here are beautiful, whether they're platonic (Michael's dealings with Harry, his best friend, and De Valera who in certain places would have you believe that they are like brothers) or romantic (with Kitty Keirnan) and the reactions of the actors are fantastic - especially De Valera (Alan Rickman)
However, if you're looking for historical accuracy... read the history first. The film takes plenty of liberties, to the extent of having one attack in Croke Park (Pairc Ui Crochaigh) that never actually happened and inaccuracies in the manner of some deaths.
And good gracious, someone kill Julia Robert's voice coach!

89287,1,0790732521,"Set just after the 1916 Easter Rebellion in Dublin, Neil Jordan's film follows the life and times of Irish revolutionary Michael Collins (Liam Neeson), detailing his relationships with Kitty Kearnan (Julia Roberts), Harry Boland (Aidan Quinn), and Eamon de Valera (Alan Rickman).  It essentially covers the period leading up to the Civil War in Ireland, and ultimately Collins' untimely death.
It must be said the movie proves to be an opportunity missed, considering the budget and all involved.  While it is usual for historical epics to have inaccuracies, ""Michael Collins"" is rather a disaster. After a very self conscious opening scene, the film seems to loose it's way and trods a distinctly uneven and incomprehensible path.  It tries to hard to be all things: epic war film, romantic movie, and politically descisive.  It fails on all counts, essentially because it is biased towards one side of the argument, and ridicules the other.  The script seems to make no attempt at exploring the intricacies of the politics involved which led to Civil War, and the picture ends up like something a not very knowledgable schoolboy would write in primary school.  Despite Liam Neeson's historonics, the casting in disasterous - particulary Aidan Quinn as an americanised Harry Boland, and Julia Roberts resembling a cross between Maureen O'Hara and Tinkerbell.  What ultimately comes across from the acting is a cast who just want to pick up their pay check as quickly as possible and move as swiftly as they can onto their next, more serious, production.
The film is particulary offensive to those brave men and women who would not accept half measures, and took the view that the Anglo Irish Treaty was not the Republic of Easter Week 1916.  Certain historical figures are missing, especially Arthur Griffith and Cathal Brugha (although Gerard McSorely appears in a brief scene with a ""mcsorely"" wig on his head which looks like something one would find in the middle of a cow field.
The Boland familly in general were outraged by the production, and the film did extremely well in Ireland, but flopped like a pan cake outside our four green fields.
It also suffers from the tendency to point to the indigenous population saying ""Isn't this cool, we're all so important on this production.  Yes I played such and such in the movie"".  I myself turned down any part of it with utter contempt, as I have taken the view that regardless of what side one was on during the Civil War, all concerned were heroes with no villins.  Was Robert E. Lee any less in greatness then Grant?  Both men are held with equal respect by the American populace.
RTE produced a much rounded and interesting production ""The Treaty"" which deals with the period in a more mature, intelligent way.  The great Brendan Gleason appears as Collins, and the equally excellent Barry McGovern as de Valera.
""Michael Collins"" is a total fiasco and an embarrasement",1080432000,20,2928,4.9389002036659875
89288,4,0790732521,"As Michael Collins is going to be one of the three individuals in the Irish independence movement from the Easter Rising to the formation of the Irish Free state that I'll be examining in my senior seminar paper next semester, I refreshed myself in rewatching this movie.  Director Neil Jordan (The Crying Game) paints a vivid portrait of the history of the final and crucial Irish Revolution against the British Empire and the man who made it possible, Michael Collins, ""The Big Fella,"" (1890-1922).  If one was to make the comparison of the Pen, Voice and the Sword made on the three main people who united Italy (Mazzini, Cavour, and Garibaldi), Collins was Ireland's Garibaldi, but also its Christ.
The movie begins with 29 April 1916, the last day of the Easter Rising, where the undermanned Irish surrendered to superior British artillery.  Collins and his friend Harry Boland are captured and fortunately avoid the fate of others like Sean MacDiarmida, and socialist intellectual James Connolly, the latter who is badly wounded and is executed strapped to a chair.  Eamon de Valera, future president of Ireland many times over, has his sentence commuted, partially because of his New York birth.
Collins learns from the mistakes of the Rising and with the help of Harry and Joe O'Reilly, sets about creating a band of assassins who use intelligence, wear the uniform as the ordinary man on the street, and the element of surprise to gun down members of the Royal Irish Constabulary and G-Men.  Both groups are considered collaborators with the British, traitors to Irish independence.  Before long, British elite police auxiliaries, the notoriously brutal Black and Tans are sent in, and they too become targets for the IRA.
There is a standout scene reminiscent of the final scene in the Godfather, where Collins' gunmen take out members of the Cairo Gang, British intelligence specialists who operated in the Middle East and were sent to deal with the IRA, quickly followed by the infamous massacre at a football game, where 14 people, including footballer Sam Hogan, were gunned down by the British searching for Sinn Feiners, and over a hundred wounded.  Bloody Sunday indeed!  While not condoning the British treatment of the Irish, it shows how retaliatory violence leads to the deaths of the innocent.  But as history has shown, there was no other way for the Irish, except by fighting.
Many aspects or themes from Tim Pat Coogan's biography on Collins have either been altered or not emphasized, which is understandable for a movie with limited running time.  For example, Ned Broy, the G-man who secretly helps Collins, survived instead of being tortured and killed.  Three Irishmen were tortured and executed the day before, and Jordan clearly decided to use their deaths and Broy as a composite character.  Another is the band of assassins Collins uses to carry out his hits.  Coogan's book refers to them as the Twelve Apostles, which using a Christ-like metaphor to Collins as the saviour of Ireland.  That isn't alluded to here, which is unfortunate.  And the action slows down in the final quarter hour, a contrast to the first two hours.
The leads do well, Liam Neeson (Collins), Aidan Quinn (Harry Boland), Julia Roberts (Kitty), Alan Rickman (de Valera), and Ian Hart (Joe O'Reilly).  The latter two would be reunited in the first Harry Potter movie as Professor Snape and Quirrel, respectively.
Those who know the story of Michael Collins will know how the story ends, but there is cutting back and forth of scenes of Kitty trying out her wedding dress to the final ambush, with Sinead O'Connor haunting rendition of the traditional ""She Moved From The Fair"" making it all the more poignant.  And de Valera is portrayed as someone who wants independence but with strategic violence, not the bloodbath Collins spreads, and but in the end, a Machiavellian manipulator.  Indeed, he did say that Collins legacy came at the cost of de Valera's own standing, and that is definitely true in this movie.",1069459200,8,4021,4.967213114754099

Plot-wise, you will learn a lot about the Irish rebellion against the British. The story, I found on some googling, has some crevices (e.g., Ned Broy was NOT murdered by the Tans as shown in the movie, in reality he survived the whole thing and went on to become the first head of the Gardai, the unarmed Irish police force.)
Yet, the superbly executed plotline unravels with an exciting pace, and is easy to follow. I was riveted.
Acting-wise, tight convincing performances all around, seems they couldn't have selected anyone better than Liam Neeson to portray Collins, although Julia Roberts was a bit expendable (and what's with that ill-achieved Irish accent!) Alan Rickman as de Valera was stunning as usual.

89292,5,0790732521,"Digging back into their roots, director Neil Jordan and actor Liam Neeson have respectively delivered their most memorable and deep-cutting works to date.  Michael Collins has nagging flaws, but in the sweep of the passionate filmmaking and performances, all else is moot.  You will be carried forth by the conviction of the story.
Neeson was simply born to play this role.  An actor of tremendous power, Neeson is here given a role that's multi-dimensional enough for him to show his formidable chops.  The Michael Collins character is alternately a boyish, dashing ladykiller and a tactician with a steel will, and just watching Neeson tackle the character's inner and outer demons is worth the price of the movie.  He indeed projects the power and charisma of a great leader in his ""our refusal"" speech.  There's more -- Aidan Quinn gives his best performance as friend-turned-enemy Harry Boland; Alan Rickman utilizes his deadpan comic timing and hidden deviance to perfection as Eamon de Valera; Stephen Rea is great as usual as English traitor Ned Broy.  The one weak link is of course Julia Roberts, as Harry and Mick's love interest Kitty, with her bad Irish accent and vacant presence.  She's paralyzed by the scope of the historical drama and comes off stiff as a result, injecting the character with neither warmth nor power, and none of her signature girlish exuberance.  However, this was one case where the filmmaker's sacrifice of a character was to the benefit of the film.  In directing the film, Jordan sliced down Kitty's importance and makes her mostly a footnote; the result is that we are now free to interpret Mick and Harry's split as a philosophical and political one, rather than the ol' romantic triangle.  And for the better.
The cinematography is terrific, and the script ranks among my favourite of the '90s.  Jordan is deeply tapped into the behaviour and concerns of these characters, and he fills every minute with humour, danger, urgency, and personality.  The writing translates onto the screen beautifully, giving the audience an insight into not only the sociological scape of the film, but also the psychological.  And the pacing and editing never let up -- from the perfectly chosen ""in medias res"" opening to the brilliant ""Bloody Sunday"" assassination montage.
A great neglected classic.",1033862400,114,2328,5.060209424083769
89293,3,0790732521,"I would almost give it 4 stars, but there are some things which can't be excused.  First of all, if you are interested in Irish history- rent it.  Of course it will give you a biased viewpoint on Michael Collins- its hollywood.  But if you study Irish history, you will find that care went into this film from the details- notice the pin that Alan Rickman as Eamon De Valera wears to show he speaks and supports Irish/Gaelic language.  Real footage plays at the end (I won't give it away for you) with music that will make your heart swell whether you supported Collins or not.  From the very beginning, the movie has the feel of the times.  Excellent uniforms, costumes, scenery.  Great lines delivered by Rickman and Neeson.  Neeson and Rickman portray the parts of Collins and De Valera- in appearance, in mannerisms, in speech- excellently.  Stephen Reyes also gave an excellent performance, for however brief his part, he delivers a believable character.  Downfall- Julia Roberts, not entirely her fault though.  Her Irish accent (also attempted in ""Mary Reilly"") made me cringe.  This movie should be about Ireland's struggle, not romance-caught-amidst-the-war.  Are we supposed to care about her choice between two men (and are we surprised that she chooses Collins?).  It doesn't blend in with the storyline well at all.  That's entertainment, I guess.  And there's one scene with Roberts, Neeson, a rose and a bed, which flashes between violence and then back to Robert's dialogue to her love.  It is one of the worst scenes in a movie I've ever seen.  I don't know whether to laugh through the melodrama or fast forward it.
Whatever your viewpoint on the war, this film can still be of benefit.  I am always happy to see any movie on Irish history and culture, and Michael Collins is a figure in it, like it or not.  The division between Collins and De Valera is well done by script and actors alike, and will give a better understanding of the main forces behind the strife in Northern Ireland to the present.",1025913600,9,2020,4.75

How historically accurate it is is debatable, but bear in mind this is just a movie. If you would like accurate historical facts, there are many books right here on amazon.com that provide just that. But this is just a movie, and as such, should be taken with a grain of salt.
This is a downright good film about a brave and passionate Irishman who loves his country and independence and will fight for them until death. (Which, of course, is his fate.) Collins struggles against English imperialism as almost all Northern Irishmen do, the difference being that Collins has wit and an extra boost of courage and will.
The cinematography is beautiful - very well done. The story moves along at a good pace and the rest of the actors are pretty good, too, except for Julia Roberts, whom I think should not have been in this film. Aidan Quinn is Collins' sidekick who seems to have a trivial role, but is good nonetheless.
Is Collins a terrorist? Is his character as portrayed in this movie a hero or a bad guy? Who actually killed him? (We see a young boy kill Michael Collins, but who put him up to it?) The answers are arguable and you will not actually find them in this movie. However, my amazon friends, this is a very moving film and one worth seeing more than once. I recommend it highly!",1025481600,5,1686,4.389776357827476

89297,3,0790732521,"""Michael Collins"" was a financial disaster and aesthetically left much to be desired. Cinematographer Chris Menges may have admirably put together a beautiful looking film, but the overall quality is less than a typical made for TV production. Neil Jordan was not up to the task as the movie's director, and it seems that he lacks the background to tackle a serious historical project. I say this as an admirer of some of Jordan's other superb efforts. Liam Neeson did an adequate job as Collins, but mostly the talents of Alan Rickman, Aidan Quinn, Julia Roberts, and Stephen Rea were unable to overcome the weaknesses of a mediocre script.
Why would any rational and decent person consider Michel Collins to be an Irish national hero? My most serious criticism deals with the less than frank handling of his career as a terrorist. Far too much time was spent on his later peacemaking efforts. Unfortunately, Collins will primarily go down in history for furthering the terrorist mindset that threatens modern day civilization. Many terrorists throughout the world studied the work of Collins. He is one of their Messiahs. We should never forget that Collins murdered innocent people to achieve his political aims. Previous to Collins and a few others in the early part of the twentieth century, such activity was considered monstrous and unthinkable.
Why did the makers of ""Michael Collins"" downplay the terrorist aspects of his past? This question demands an answer especially after the horror of September 11. The movie deserves only three stars. Those who might wish to learn a bit more about terrorism might find ""Michael Collins"" worthy enough to invest a few hours of their time.

Michael Collins is a good primer into the mind of terrorists and worth viewing for people who want to understand why people do unthinkable things to make their point known.  Terrorism is the tool of people to weak to engage in a war yet desire to have their pain and anger acknowleged by the mighty. While on a much smaller scale, it Michael Collins gives a perspective that is relevant to todays events.  I thought about this movie many times since the Trade Center bombings.  The film does not sympathize with those who commit random acts of violence and Michael Collins pays a great price for breaking from the hardcore wing of the IRA to create a first step compromise.

Liam Neeson does a fine job as Collins, but there are two BAD performances in the film which hurt its overall effectiveness. First, Julia Roberts does a terrible job as the woman Collins loves. Bad brogue and just bad attitude. Then Alan Rickman, who I thought did splendid work in ""Sense and Sensibility"" is perfectly horrid as Eamonn DaValera. The scene where he makes an imprint of his jail key is so ludicrous, it looked like camp. Also, the film suggests that DaValera had a hand in Collins' murder, which undercuts the importance of DaValera himself as an Irish patriot, long-time President of the country.

After countless reading, I watched Michael Collins last night feeling as if I was watching the movie for the first time. Liam Neilson(sorry for the misplelling) was born to play this role and does it brilliantly. He portrays Collins's character in the light he was famous for, courageous, witty, keen, and always one step a head of the brits and even his comrads. Although I tend to agree Julie Roberts is a bit of a miscast, and I would have loved to see a truly Irish actress tackle the role of Kitty, such as the beatuful actress who played Murron in Bravehear, but all in all Julie Roberts did an admirable job.

89304,2,0790732521,"It all looked so promising - at last, a big-budget movie about Ireland's history and actually directed and screenwritten by an Irishman! Tax breaks from the Irish government and thousands of Dubliners willing to work for free as extras gave it an added boost.  So what went wrong? First of all, we have the Oirish cliches. Take this one. Mr Collins makes a speech on a donkey cart. There were such things as platforms in early 20th century Ireland, but let that pass. Then the polis come. Collins gets down from the cart and headbutts someone. Mob take out many hurleys and start headwhacking. The whys and wherefores are a mystery here. It's the modern version of the obligatory barfight scene. Irish public are violent louts whose innate thuggery must be harnessed by a fellow thug in order to behave loutishly towards bigger thugs?

Did anyone actually read the facts about the IRA campaign of guerilla warfare? We get the idea that the whole war, though outwardly aimed at England, is just an internal squabble - which is exactly how the English tried to portray it.

And then the story. It is well known that most real lives don't translate very well to the screen, so subtelty and imagination must be applied liberally. Unfortunately, Collins's true story doesn't lend itself very well to a movie, as the story of, say, Patrick Pearse or Eamon de Valera would. Their lives had real cinematic qualities - heroism, political vision, idealism etc, that is lacking here. Instead of fictionalising the character, which is usually necessary for a successful dramatic narrative, Jordan used the actual facts and twisted them, which only usually works in history, when the historian isn't very particular about the truth. Thus, instead of being a valuable asset to the republican movement, Collins *is* the republican movement. One doesn't wish to underestimate Collins's role, but it was almost exclusively in intelligence. Think of how interesting a film based on Collins's espionage might have been, instead of the fruitless insistence that he was the Big Fella, he really was!

Instead of the statesman that he was (recognised all but officially as the President of the Irish Republic in America, where he toured and raised funds in 1919-20), de Valera 'becomes' a mere conniver, whose only interest is...well, it's not explained, really, but we just *know* he's evil. To set the record straight, all Jordan's insinuations about his motives are wrong. He did not suddenly jump from being a little, egotistical man, to one known internationally for his integrity and his opposition to imperialism - and fascism - overnight. He also had a much greater involvement in the War of Independence than he's given credit for, and neither he nor Brugha approved of Collins's occasional 'revenge' killings. And so on.

As for the acting, the standard was poor. Neeson was alright, but the others were, frankly, atrocious. (Poor aul' Harry Boland, portrayed as a weakling by Quinn, was most definitely *not*  killed in a sewer but gunned down in a hotel room by a murder gang. And why was Dev, in his 30s at the time, made to look old enough to be a grandfather? That's apart from the fact that they really should have given him a moustache to twirl to make him the complete stage villian. And let's not mention the woeful miscasting of Julia Roberts...)

89309,4,0790732521,"What a shame that whenever this film is mentioned nowadays, it's almost always referred to as a Julia Roberts flop.  It's actually scarcely a Julia Roberts film at all. Her role is quite minor-and it's commendable that she  took it on, really, since she was already a star. I gather she was looking  for serious roles in meaty films in an effort to beef up her acting  credentials.
And this certainly was a meaty film.  It is, in fact, a  much, much better film than I had ever imagined from the reviews of the  time.  I only regret never having seen it on the big screen, because its  epic sweep and beautiful cinematography would have been all the more  impressive.
Americans, including Irish-Americans like myself, have only  the vaguest notions of Irish history.  We learn the basics in school, and  probably, most educated Americans have an idea of approximately when and  how the Irish Republic was established.  We may also know that six counties  in the North remained under British rule and are still part of the UK (at  least, I hope we do--after 30 years of reports on the  ""troubles"").
""Michael Collins"" goes some distance  toward filling in those informational gaps.  I am aware that many critics  have challenged writer/director Neil Jordan's interpretation of Irish  history (in particular his making Eamon De Valera, the President of the  Irish Republic, something of a villain).  To that, one can only respond  that historical dramas are by definition an interpretation of history.  I  see that a few of the reviewers below have mentioned that this film  inspired them to seek out more information about Irish history.  Those of  us that do will eventually get a more balanced view, perhaps. It was not  Neil Jordan's job to provide us with that perspective.  His job as an  artist was to tell as engaging a story as he could. On that score, he has  succeeded very well indeed.",960076800,57,1894,4.761609907120743
89310,5,0790732521,"Neil Jordan's Michael Collins is a fast paced intelligent work about a  early twentieth century Irish poltical activist and military leader. The  film has romance, pace, action, wit and humour. Neil Jordan is probably one  of the best script writers in terms of quantity and quality of product now  working in world cinema. It's his intelligence and unique way of seeing a  situation I find is refreshing. Dressing up a future President of Ireland  of Ireland disguised as a whore is witty and fair comment on the corruption  in politics in Ireland at the moment. Taking up the story of Michael  Collins after a failed rebellion in Dubllin, Ireland, against British  Imperial rule at the time, 1916, Jordan quickly introduces the characters  of the film. Harry Boland, a Dub amusingly played by Aidan Quinn (Fans of  Quinn can see him also in the fine This is my Father which he made with his  brothers) Eamonn De Valera, a political intellectual leader of the  republican movement well caricatured by Alan Rickman, and Kitty Kiernan,  played by Julia Roberts in a performance which will steal your heart. A  fine supporting cast led by english actor Ian Hart gives this film top  quality drama. The performance of Liam Neeson in the role of Collins is one  of the best of his career so far with the flair of his Oscar Schindler  character and the strength of Collins Cork origins mixed with poignant  reflective moments, this is terrific natural playing.
Basically the story  is of Collins out-witting the British administration and winning a  negotiated settlement. A lot of Collins' characteristics are picked up in  the movie. His cycling around Dublin under the very noses of the security  forces, his playing with De Valera's children and wrestling with whoever  was about as a bit of a joke. Unlike the revolutionary leaders who are said  to have copied Collins, like Mao Tse Tung and Ho Chi Minh etc., Collins was  more likely to say ""are you on for a pint ?"" than any guff about  the good of the movement. His tactical talent and strategic skills are  shown but his skill at managing the large amounts of intelligence  information isn't as well appreciated in the film. His realization that a  republic was better forged under steady transition, and more logically  needed to be worked out as to its practical meaning, was a foundation stone  of the current Irish state. Further his belief that a democratic decision,  a popular vote, was the crux of any situation and to be defended despite  any loyalties to the contrary. This latter point is made dramatically in  the film as Collins and Boland find themselves on opposite sides having  been pals. (For more information on Collins try Tim Pat Coogan's  ""Michael Collins"", a better read is  ""De Valera"" by the  same author.)",959817600,12,2785,4.832271762208068
89311,4,0790732521,"Michael Collins is the kind of political epic that wins Oscars. The only strike against this big, blowzy Irish potato is that it exalts a man many see as villain.
There are no easy answers bestowed on us in Michael  Collins, nor should there be. But the questions pondered come in such a  sumptuous package that it's easy to get lost in all the free-flowing Irish  nationalism.
History does agree that Collins was a patriot trying to  free his homeland from stiff-necked British control. While the sun was  setting the Empire, its wee neighbor was testing its limits and then openly  rebelling against the Crown's sovereignty.
Starting in 1916 with the  famously bloody Easter Uprising and ending with Collins' ambush and death  in 1922, Neil Jordan's detailed and dizzying trip does much to shed light  on what's a historical footnote for most non-Irish Americans. I just wonder  how it will play in London.
Liam Neeson brings an amazing vigor and  poignancy to the title role as Collins goes from minor revolutionary to big  man of the little isle. And as with most martyrs for the cause, there's  ample time in the movie's two and a half hour running time for Collins to  ruffle opposing feathers. Interestingly, one of the first is that of  Republic President Eamon DeValera (a rightly stoic Alan Rickman). Both  desire a free Irish state, but while De Valera prefers diplomacy, Collins  is ready to kick some arse if he has to.
Michael Collins plays fast and  loose with many of the facts, and the subplots, including a love triangle  between Collins and Harry Boland (Aidan Quinn) is bland and  inconsequential.

Drama, after all, is oftentimes inconsistent with the tides of history. Which was  why I was so impressed to read a magazine article some time ago touting the  film's attention to detail and accuracy. I made a special note of wanting  to see ""Michael Collins"". Am I ever glad I did. This is a  wonderful, wonderful movie.
""Michael Collins"" is the story of a  member of the Irish Republican Army who succeeded in leading Ireland to  independence, but at great cost. A participant in the famous ""Easter  Rising"" of 1916, Collins was arrested and became a leader in the Irish  independence movement. Collins was an extraordinary leader who devised  guerilla warfare tactics to fight the English army that would later be used  by the Viet Cong, and daringly rescued Eamon DeValeria, the man who would  become the leader of Ireland and whom many believe was responsible for  Collins death. Collins also negotiated the treaty which ended 700 years of  English rule in Ireland, and as Commander of the Irish Provisional Army was  forced to fight against guerillas opposed to the treaty (which left the  northern six counties a part of England and delayed full independence). The  irony was that Collins was forced to hunt down and kill the very men he  trained. Many in Ireland look on Collins as a hero, others as a traitor.  His death is, like the Kennedy assassination, a great controversy- nobody  has the faintest idea who killed him. As historical figures go, few are as  controversial or as romanticized as Collins. The film covers the 1916-1922  era of Collins life, from the Easter Rising until his death.
Writer &  Director Neil Jordan clearly has passion for the project and it shows.  Collins is a real hero to Jordan and the director goes to great lengths to  be as accurate as possible and to show us Collins in action.
Perhaps  Jordan's best move was in casting Liam Neeson in the part. Neeson is a very  talented actor who delivers a terrific performance in the title role.  Neeson's Collins is firey, angry, passionate, hates war, longs for peace.  It is hard to imagine anyone else in the part.
The rest of the cast is  good- Alan Rickman is impressive as Eamon DeValeria, a difficult role to  play given how much DeValeria and Collins are at odds with one another in  the end. Aidan Quinn, Julia Roberts, and Stephen Rea are all also good in  their supporting roles as Collins best friend, the woman the two men  compete for, and the English agent who provides Collins with critical  intelligence.
In terms of location and cinematography, it is hard to do  better than this. Jordan has painstakingly recreated Ireland & Dublin  of 1916-1922, and it looks stunningly beautiful and stunningly realistic.  One actually feels like you are seeing the real Ireland of the early part  of the century instead of a recreation.

Collins had to invent a new mode of urban warfare after the failure of the 1916 Easter Rebellion. Neeson also brings to life Collins' attempt to live a normal life while running an underground war.
