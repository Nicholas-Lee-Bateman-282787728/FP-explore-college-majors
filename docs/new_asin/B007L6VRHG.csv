5094207,5,B007L6VRHG,"The trend for today's movies is to reveal the entire plot from start to finish including all the best lines compressed into a 2 minute 30 second trailer. The trailer for this film is awesome - fast paced, great music track (we're on a road to nowhere), and really funny. Well all of that stuff happens in about the first 20 minutes of the film. Then this focus/Indian paintbrush film settles into an examination of two questions: What if you found out you had 21 days to live? Along with the rest of humankind?

The basic plot of this movie is: man with long history of woman problems gives up on romance after his wife leaves him and he finds out the world is coming to an end, people try unsuccessfully to set him up, he meets a much younger female neighbor who has a sleep disorder and awful judgment in men, they pick up a dog and go on a road trip each on a quest for that one last thing they want to do in this life. And they get to really know each other along the way.

It is at times serious and contemplative and other times shifts to gallows humor. The exterior world which starts out with crowds and rioting fades away as the film progresses to focus solely on one man and one woman. The relationship that builds over the course of the movie between the main characters, Dodge and Penny, along with the dog they pick up along the way dubbed Sorry, is sweet and believable.

If you like Steve Carell's brand of humor or films that cut past the BS and examine the stuff that matters, give this one a try.",1341446400,68,1514,4.25
5094208,3,B007L6VRHG,"OK, the world is going to end in three weeks, destroyed by an asteroid Mathilde.  (There is indeed as asteroid named Mathilde, but it's only (!) 31 miles wide.  Why the size inflation?)  Most people seem to be unsure of what to do, though the rioting you'd expect in the cities does take place.  Some people continue to go to work cleaning houses or selling insurance for the coming catastrophe.  (Though it's never made clear how this huge this 70 mile-wide killer asteroid is going to impact life on the planet, though some believe survivalists who think they can stay in a bomb shelter and form a new civilization with what's left.  Which is it?)

The problem with the film is two-fold.  The largest problem (and pretty much fatal to the film) is there is very, very little chemistry between the two leads, Steve Carell and Keira Knightly.  They play neighbors in an apartment complex who really don't know each other well at all.  (This is a tip-off, I suppose because there should have been at least a spark between the two when they lived near one another, before all the sturm-und-drang of the end of the world stuff.  But no, not at all that I could see).  The second problem is there is little romantic comedy when played against the 'end of the world'.  Maybe it's just me, but I don't find the death of millions to be conducive to lots of jokes and light banter between characters.  A difficult problem that the film just can't surmount.

Now I know this is not a documentary film, or a serious drama; it's supposed to be a romantic comedy of sorts, and a 'let's settle old scores family' film, but in order for me to buy into the film, I have to know how big of a threat the asteroid is going to be. Let's just say that it's the end of ole planet Earth.  And there is some reference made to a non-existent space shuttle trying to save the planet that fails (didn't the script writers get the memo??? There is no space shuttle program any more!).

There are some pleasures to be had by the film; first and foremost, it does get you thinking.  If the world is going to end in a month, what would YOU do?  Have end-of-the-world flings?  Try something new?  Leave your spouse for an old lover?  The supporting characters are adequate to file out the film.  They include William Peterson (CSI: Las Vegas) in a shocking role, and Adam Brody as the apparent lover of Penny, Keira Knightly's character

So is it worth the $10.00 at the multiplex to see?  I'd say no.  If you want to watch an OK film, wait until it comes out on DVD.  There are some interesting ways people deal with such distressing news.  But the power is on until the very end, even television is there if you are obsessed with knowing how much time you have left.

Two-and-a-half stars for 'Seeking a Friend for the End of the World'.  It could have been much better, with a better match with the two leads.",1341100800,3,2881,4.422053231939164
5094209,4,B007L6VRHG,"The cumbersome title alone would seem to spell doom for this take on Earth's destruction.  With a huge asteroid hurtling toward the planet, humans have 3 weeks to say their goodbyes and plan for their ultimate demise.  Steve Carell reprises his sad-sack persona as Dodge an insurance salesman.  When he and his wife hear the news in the car, she jumps out and runs the other way.  Now alone, Dodge meets a neighbor he never knew.

Penny (an adorable Keira Knightly) has just broken up with her live-in boyfriend and is devastated given the time left.  Penny is a bit loopy and has been hording some of Dodge's misdirected mail.  This includes a letter sent to him by his long lost high school sweetheart wanting to reconnect.  The two make a pact (Penny has a car) to search out the woman.  In return, Dodge has a contact that can fly her to her parent's town (commercial air travel has been shut down).  The middle section of the film is pretty standard movie road-trippin' with a funny stop at a T.G.I. Friday's style restaurant where the theme appears to be ""party-on.""

Ultimately this is Knightly's movie as she transforms before our eyes from a pot smoking 28 year old laissez faire artist to a lonely woman who hasn't met the right man.  As one of her generation's most talented actresses she manages to pull of this transition with deft agility.  When she gets access to a military satellite phone she calls her family.  We only hear her side of the conversation but Penny's face tells the story.

Some will not like the tonal change of the film as it moves from groups of people doing things they never have before.  Ranging from rioting and destruction, to middle-age suburbanites shooting up heroin to see what it's like, to mindless sex.  Ultimately the movie is about love, friendship and who you want to be with at the end.",1341100800,,1837,4.603076923076923
5094210,3,B007L6VRHG,"There's a unique and more courageous movie lurking on the fringes of screenwriter and first-time director Lorene Scafaria's whimsical, melancholic take on Armageddon, but this relatively low-key 2012 drama has a change of heart at the two-thirds mark that makes the inevitable ending feel almost conventional relative to its idiosyncratic start. Instead of dealing with mankind's fate in a special-effects-laden extravaganza, Scafaria blessedly reduces the scale to ponder how a small circle of people respond to the prospect of impending oblivion. In this respect, her humanistic approach is similar to Lars von Trier's recent&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Melancholia/dp/B005TJ7EFG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Melancholia</a>&nbsp;where the focus was on two sisters with opposing sensibilities. This film focuses on a more unlikely pair - Dodge Petersen, a menopausal, emotionally wounded insurance salesman and Penny Lockhart, a free spirit hypersomniac with a passion for classic vinyl records. The plot starts simply enough when a radio announcer nonchalantly announces that the last-ditch attempt to avert a seventy-mile-wide asteroid named Mathilda has failed.

Dodge's wife runs away immediately upon hearing the news, while their friends decide to end their days with uninhibited debauchery, excessive amounts of alcohol, and heroin injections. At first, the nearly catatonic Dodge doesn't alter his daily routine as he goes to his office and finds people disappearing and committing suicide in the face of the disaster. He eventually decides to seek out his long-ago love Olivia, and his bohemian neighbor Penny wants to help him in exchange for the possibility that he can find her a way to get back home to her family in England. The movie then turns into a road trip where, of course, they meet up with a series of eccentrics, all the while forming an alliance that turns unsurprisingly into love. The early scenes like their encounter with the hedonistic, lascivious staff at a TGIF-like restaurant are quirky, unexpected, and funny in an absurdist way. However, when Dodge starts to recognize his do-or-die attraction to Penny, the transition is barely apparent, and the rush of romanticism never feels quite authentic, especially in light of the ensuing episodes which become increasingly predictable.

It's quite possible that Scafaria intended the shift in tone to be subtle to the point of non-existent, but it leaves a bit of an emotional vacuum which the actors have to fill in with their performances. By now, Steve Carell is no stranger to the sad loner character he portrays here, having done similar duty in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Little-Miss-Sunshine/dp/B000MR1V22/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Little Miss Sunshine</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dan-in-Real-Life/dp/B003PLTRA0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dan in Real Life</a>, and last year's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Crazy-Stupid-Love/dp/B003Y5H574/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Crazy, Stupid, Love</a>, and there is definitely a feeling of retread in his work here. Yet, his innate likeability and common-man sensibilities eventually won me over. In a change-of-pace from her more histrionic roles, Keira Knightley captures Penny's sprightly mannerisms nicely, although I have to admit her off-kilter performance sometimes feels like an impersonation of Kate Winslet's Clementine in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Eternal-Sunshine-of-the-Spotless-Mind/dp/B001TAJGO6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind</a>. While a nice rapport develops between Carell and Knightley, the romantic sparks never really ignite in any compelling way to make us feel more resonantly about their characters' fates. Still, there is a lingering sweetness to the whole enterprise that's hard to resist, and I found myself hoping there was some other way to end a movie that telegraphs its intentions from the outset.

There are lots of recognizable faces in small roles and cameos sprinkled throughout - Rob Corddry as Dodge's nihilistic neighbor, a nicely comic Connie Britton as his horned-up wife, Melanie Lynskey as the wanton woman who they throw to Dodge to provide instant gratification in the remaining days, Patton Oswalt as another neighbor taking full advantage of the open floodgates for available sex, Adam Brody as Penny's over-sensitive current boyfriend, Derek Luke as her humorless survivalist ex-boyfriend, William Petersen as a somewhat suspect trucker, T.J. Miller as the stoner-friendly restaurant host, and Martin Sheen as Dodge's estranged father. The music on the eclectic soundtrack is well chosen from Frank Black's ""In My Time of Ruin"" to the Hollies' ""The Air That I Breathe"" to Herb Alpert's ""This Guy's in Love with You"". It's worth seeing just to see a different take on a hopelessly curious premise, but the execution is not as uniquely individualistic or emotionally resonant as I was hoping it would be.",1340841600,13,5145,6.182960893854749
5094211,5,B007L6VRHG,"Not your typical comedy, romantic comedy, love story, or hollywood movie. When it's done you will spend the evening dreaming about where you should be going next, because life is too precious to drift aimlessly through.",1340755200,,219,5.111111111111111
5094212,4,B007L6VRHG,"""Seeking a Friend For The End of The World"" a nicely executed tragicomedy romance movie. Steve Carrell is the master of dark humor. Black humor is used to lighten up the overall mood of the pre-apocalypse. This movie shows that even in a short period of time, people can still have a life-changing experiences and find true love. Depressingly funny and highly recommended.",1340582400,,372,4.920634920634921
5094213,5,B007L6VRHG,"Viewing, ""Seeking a Friend for the End of the World,"" was, to me, like finally coming home. You have your motor running, trying to keep up with everyday life and then you're slammed into a wall realizing life is closing in, the days counting down, confusion sending the weaker of humankind into a riot to end their existence. Yet, if you're lucky, there is still enough time to place pesky issues on a shelf and put the needs of another before yours so that a bit of light and joy is there to greet you. I think I laughed when I shouldn't have, but the actors were setting me up to do just that. The soundtrack is fantastic. And ""Sorry"" was more than one work spoken in haste or sorrow.",1340409600,,686,4.2846153846153845
5094214,5,B007L6VRHG,"Earlier this year there was ""Melancholia"", the ambitious and at times entertaining but also pretentious take on ""the end of the world"" as envisioned by director Lars von Trier, and now we get a completely different perspective on the very same topic, as written and directed by Lorene Scafaria.

""Seeking a Friend for the End of the World"" (95 min.) starts off brilliantily. In the first minute of the movie we see Dodge (played by Steve Carell) and his wife sitting in the car, listening to the radio announcement that asteroid 'Matilda' cannot be stopped and will hit earth in 3 weeks, ending life as we know it. Dodge's wife looks at him, and then leaves the car, literally running away from him. What a beginning! Dodge eventually meets Penny (played by Kiera Knightley), and regardless of their age difference, they strike a friendship. Dodge and Penny hit the road, among others to look up Dodge's HS sweetheart and to find a plane for penny so she can rejoin her family in England. I don't want to give away much more of the plot, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out, but let's just say things don't pan out exactly as Dodge and Penny thought they would.

This is an outstanding movie from start to finish. In the midst of all the numbing summer blockbusters that Hollywood unleaches upon us, here's actually a movie that actually speaks to me. At times I laughed, at times I teared up, and the movie went by in the blink of an eye.  I don't know that Steve Carell has ever been better than here, playing the ""Joe Six-Pack"" average guy with even more restraint (and that's a compliment). Kudos also to Kiera Kightley. Likewise for the oustanding soundtrack (I may never listen to the Hollies ""The Air That I Breathe"" in the same way again). But the ultimate credit must go to writer-director Lorene Scafaria, making her directing debut here. Can't wait to see what she will do next. Meanwhile, ""Seeking a Friend for the End of the World"" is HIGHLY, HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",1340409600,144,1997,4.619718309859155
5094215,5,B007L6VRHG,"""Matilda"" is an asteroid who is coming soon and it's predicted that within three weeks, the world will come to an end. The clock begins to tick fast as everyone reacts in a different way. One couple in particular had opposite reactions, the wife left in a panic which most would panic, but the husband decided to take a road trip to unite with his high school sweetheart. A neighbor gets in the way of the Master plan as time is not on their side. This is a comedy, drama and romance blended together, presenting a good cast of characters, lots of entertainment as well as laughter. Very Enjoyable and Highly Recommended!",1340323200,3,621,4.553571428571429

Some of the early material is pretty rough in language and subject matter, but if you give it a chance, you learn that that is the context for what is a central event of the story. It is not a raunchy movie, as it turns out, but is actually rather deep and poignant and sweet, touching, moving and thought-provoking. It pretty much gets at the human condition and what matters.

I felt that some moments were wasted for comedic value, but by the end, the more serious tone of the film became defined and it finished very strongly. The most intriguing part was by far the relationship between the two main characters. The theme of ""opposites attract,"" while slightly clichd, was used with great purpose, ultimately creating a more fulfilling storyline and multifaceted characters.

When Steve Carel sees deep deep in the eyes of Keira Knightley without a single blink for a long long time, everything changed. I mean everything.
Nothing doesn't matter anymore.
The fact that the world will end in a few days, the fact that he lost his wife, the fact that Kiara also was lost in love, there is a huge riot and everyone just wants to damn the world cause they know that there is no tomorrow.
Love conqures everything right?
Age doesn't matter too.

Steve Carell is about 50 and Keira Knightely according to this movie is 28. What do they care?
First it was just a light sex since Keira just was dumpped by this guy and wanted to cry in Steve's arms that's it. She knew that Steve wanted to find his wife since he is still in love with her and there is still dreg in him. So all she wanted is just a little solace.

Then there came this huge storm called love.
Since there is no tomorrow, this love should burn bright as twice, three times as usual right?
So it burnt it went.

Steve was afraid and when he visited his dad which he never did he was about to leave her to her dad with his dad's famous airplane and let him take her aride and let her go that way.
Yes he was afraid that he might ruin the very last moment spending with her. What if it is not beautiful enough, what if, what if?
But when it came to be the very last time, she came along like a magic!
She appeared as if from one of those movies.
She said why did you leave me like that?
Then they became one of a kind for the last moment of this world.

Anyway, this is a good movie to feel. It balances reality with wishful thinking/fantasy. It's a compilation of Knightley's Attonement and Carrell's 40 yr old virgin mixed with some Armageddon.

Of course, I'd watch anything with Keira Knightly in it.  There were a few moments when she really had me tearing up with her. Steve Carell's deadpan, sweet but socially awkward, existential misfit is also really adorable.  So is the dog, who is aptly named ""Sorry,"" the message on a note someone leaves for Carell's character when he wakes up in the park.

So at the end of the world, when people are looting and rioting, getting high, or taking stock of supplies in their bomb shelters, this movie really asks of its audience to ponder what they would do with only less than one month before the end of everything. Heavy stuff.

The trivialities of life really float away.  So what if the cell phone towers no longer work? (Le gasp!) So what if you hate your job, you're single or you're mired in regrets of what ""could have been"" in your life?  It really only comes down to your own truths, whatever they may be.

Two lonely people accidently find each other and take a journey that takes them across the country and back into each other's arms.  Through their journey they got their mugshots taken, meet up with old flames, run into odd characters, and had to bury a guy--twice.  Their travels was a series of snapshots through society; the wicked, the pitiful characters, the dutiful cops, the brave, the crazy militarists, the weird hippy-free-love cult, and the nobly normal were all in this movie, like a montage celebrating what it is to be human.

There was awesome wit and humor in the movie and it was really well written in my opinion.  That people still went to work even though it was all meaningless (and a title like CFO was up for grabs for anyone who wanted to volunteer) was really a poignant jab at the inane routine of corporate America.  The fact that the Prius (an environmentally friendly car) is practically useless at the end of the world and there is no gas; but a fully filled Smart car (the most insensible car that was ever made) got them where they needed to go was hilarious.  The fact Carell's character toted around his adopted dog ""Sorry"" was really allegory for every regret he had in life.  The fact that Knightley's character only thought to bring vinyl records with her when she escaped the riots, even though she had no way of listening to them, was ridiculously cute.

Yeah it was the end of the world, and the movie begins with a newscast saying there is no hope for anyone anywhere, and so the first minute of the movie already gives away the ending.  But the movie wasn't about death.  It was about cherishing the the things in life you really love; like dogs and vinyl records.  It was about leaving the past in the past, cherishing the present and standing side by side with someone you actually want to be with at the end.

I'm going to go hug my dog and find my vinyl records now....",1450742400,2,2876,4.483685220729367

5094553,4,B007L6VRHG,"This was a generally low-key, optimistic, hopeful romantic comedy about the last two weeks of life on planet Earth.

The movie opens with Dodge (Steve Carell) sitting in a car listen to a radio broadcast describing how an accident has destroyed the ship tasked with diverting a meteorite from its path toward the Earth. The wife looks at Dodge, screams and runs away, never to be seen again.  From that point, we follow the obviously depressed Dodge as he negotiates the last two weeks of humanity.  We see him attend a party where his friends decide ""what the heck? Let's try heroin"" and an office meeting where the few remaining employees of Dodge's insurance company are being offered open positions, such as Chief Financial Officer.

Dodge meets up with his somewhat crazy neighbor Penny (Keira Knightley.) The two have separate objectives - she wants to get to England to see her family and he wants to see his high school sweetheart - and they go on a road trip to attain their desires.  Since it is a  road trip, there are absurd and nice vignettes, and some interesting cameo appearances, and, of course, love blossoms.

The end of the world in this movie is really quite civilized.  Unlike other ""end of the world"" movies where violence and insanity are rampant, in this version, the electricity stays on and indoor plumbing continues to function all the way to the end.

The end is surprisingly warm and hopeful.

For such a ""downer"" subject, this is nice movie that will love you feeling strangely upbeat.",1440720000,,1516,4.751908396946565

No one will catch us if we fall. But at the same time existentialism is the most humanist of philosophies. It is up to us, only us, to find meaning in our lives. And the payoff is that if we do so, we can attribute it all to ourselves. When the end of the world comes, as it must for us all, we will be able to say I did X, not X happened to me. C.f.

5094555,3,B007L6VRHG,"Road pictures are a staple in films. Like any other genre they achieve varying degrees of success. This one is watchable but it probably won't stick with you.

Here's the scoop. The earth has about three weeks before it gets whacked by a giant meteor. Sad sack Dodge (Steve Carell) finds out all too late that a woman he loved many ears prior wants to hook up again before all goes black. He has little time and is angry because he could have acted sooner had his neighbor, Penny (Keira Knightley), given him the letter, that was put in her mailbox, sooner instead of holding onto it. But because she's such a mess with issues of low self esteem, he melts inside and figures he can get her to England to see her family and, on the way, find his girl.

This is an okay watch. But things go wrong at the script level. First is Carell's character Dodge. He's so down trodden it's no wonder his wife left him and it IS a wonder he hasn't already committed suicide. Then there is the relationship between him and Knightley that is supposed to escalate as the movie progresses. It's a weak progression. I'm guessing that writer/director Larene Scafaria was going for something more subtle as opposed to succumbing to Hollywood type ""aha!"" moments  that dot many of these kinds of films. Nice try, but it didn't work. These two reach their ultimate friendship but I just didn't feel it. It needed more. And the dog. He was little more than a prop. I don't why Scafaria bothered. I liked her script for ""Nick and Nora's Infinite Playlist"" much better.

One of he best things going is one of the final scenes when Dodge faces his long absentee father played by Martin Sheen. This is probably the best exchange in the movie and the strongest scene for Carell. But all the acting is good and the production is as good as it had to be to get the job done. It just wasn't a great job.

Anyway....This is a decent watch. I wasn't looking at the clock which is a good thing. It didn't overstay its welcome. So enjoy it. Just don't expect a life changing experience.",1440720000,,2050,4.441489361702128

I 'thought' I read that it was a romantic comedy, but it is anything but that, well, it is, and it isn't, I don't think I have seen anything like this before, it definitely surprised me, and that is a good thing. Steve Carell is a really good comedic actor, but he's equally as good when it comes to showing what he can do in a dramatic part as well. He can flip back and forth between the two, in one scene, that is not an easy task for most, but he does it flawlessly. This guy can act!
As far as Keira Knightley goes, to be honest, I am not sure if I have seen her in anything that I have watched, if so, she did not make an impression on me. THIS movie however, she did really well, I started out not caring too much for her part, but by the end, I really appreciated her acting skills.
My wife and I both loved this, we didn't have great expectations, but it affected us both, me maybe a little more, I guess because I was more in the mood for something like this, I don't know really, all I know is it punched me in the heart.
The bad part is, I really love Steve's comedies, his style, so, now, the cat's out of the bag, everyone will want him to do more serious roles, so maybe his movies won't be comedy related, at least, as much. I know that he has done other dramatic movies, and I have seen some of those, but they were not in the same class as this was, in my opinion.

5094700,3,B007L6VRHG,"Everybody dies. I think the film title pretty much tells you that from the get go. How you get there is what this movie focuses on. Seeking a Friend for the End of the World is a quirky film that asks the question, ""What would you be doing if you only had a few weeks to live?"" with some interesting results. It's part dark comedy, part romantic film and part drama. The movie can be a difficult pill to swallow considering the premise, but it is interesting enough to watch at least once in your lifetime.

The movie starts off with the already established apocalypse coming in the form of a giant meteor guaranteed to snuff off all life. Dodge (Steve Carell), fed up with where his life is at the end of the world, decides to seek an old high school sweetheart with the help of his neighbor Penny (Keira Knightley). The movie essentially chronicles their adventures in the final weeks of existence, including the places they go and the people they meet along the way. In that way this is a road trip type film. With that you won't see much in the way of plot twists or big tentpole type story development. It's a rather intimate affair where you are essentially traveling with them.

The interesting aspect of this film is where you get to see people's reaction to the impending doom. Some go about their day as if they can ignore the problem and it will go away (a few just don't know what's going on). Some embrace the end and do what they can to celebrate what life is left, either by partying or facilitating the party. Some riot. Some panic. Some buy more insurance coverage. It's a fascinating mix into the human psyche behind dealing with the despair of knowing there is no way out of it. You are everybody else you know and don't know will die in a very short time. This is really one of the bigger draws to the movie, and makes for a compelling observation into the human condition.

What's more you also see Dodge's evolution through the whole situation. He starts out going through the motions, then is faced with more letdown on top the whole end of the world bit. Then Dodge finds purpose in his final weeks, and it puts him in completely unfamiliar territory for maybe the first time in his life. Almost like the pending meteor actually pushed him out of his comfort zone and gave him a new lease on life... albeit a brief one. I won't give away the ending (well you know the ending, but I mean how Dodge faces the end) as it is rather touching in spite of the bittersweetness of it all.

The problem with a movie like this is in spite of the charm and clever psychoanalysis it's a somber film. That shadow of the world ending is hanging over the entire movie and never lets up. You can't help but feel all sorts of things like how the whole endeavor is pointless, and you will asking lots of questions like, ""Why isn't he doing this?"" or ""What about that?"". I suppose that's the whole point of the film. To make you think. To make you feel. To put you in that somber and futile position and make you explore the situation in your own way. Still if you go to movies to have a good time this isn't exactly light popcorn fare.

This is a Universal disk, which means the studio finds ways to annoy you with promotional flags and the such. Still the video looks great in high definition, and the DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 is smooth, if not taking full advantage of the surround sound experience. The extras are small and not all that impressive overall. Here's what you get:

Commentary - This commentary is packed with voices. Writer/Director Lorene Scafaria, Producer Joy Gorman, actors Patton Oswalt and Adam Brody, Gail Scafaria (the directors mother??). Enjoyable and insightful commentary.  I can't help but wonder why Steve Carell and Keira Knightley aren't commenting though.

A Look Inside Seeking a Friend for the End of the World - Short and redundant promotional behind the scenes featurette running at about five minutes. Nothing really to see here.

Music for the End of the World: What's On Your Playlist? - I can't get over it. The featurettes on this disc get more and more irrelevant. Now you have the actors telling you what music they want to hear at the end of the world. What's next? A feature on what food was catered while filming?

Outtakes - Various misspoken lines and a few technical glitches. A couple funny things in there, but mostly your standard actors missing takes.

Seeking a Friend for the End of the World is not everybody's cup of tea. It's mostly a funny movie, but with a huge dark cloud hanging over it. If you like movies that make you think this should be on your list. If you HAVE to have a happy ending then you may as well avoid this film or just stop watching once the duo gets back home. This is a film that doesn't use traditional film convention, and as such is a mixed bag for the general audience. However I think it's worth watching at least once... love it or hate it.",1427155200,,4933,4.445796460176991

5094757,5,B007L6VRHG,"It's not a comedy.  It's marketed as one and certainly contains moments of comedic relief, but by no means should one watch this movie in the hopes of getting a lot of laughs.

I get the impression that the original draft of this script was probably one of the more depressing things written in quite some time, and that an effort was made to lighten things up a bit so that the film wasn't overwhelmingly depressing.  Most of that comedic relief stops by about halfway through the film, at which point we're left with two very likeable characters trying to find some sort of solace as they approach the literal end of the world.  Some aspects of the romance that develops between them is predictable, but it never feels false or forced.  In fact I liked both of them so much that I was happy to see them happy, if even for just a moment.  Without ruining anything, I can only say that film was ultimately completely heartbreaking.

There's no shortage of films about the end of the world.  This one differs in the sense that it doesn't attempt any action-packed heroics at the last minute to save anyone, it doesn't try to offer any deeply philosophical answers about anything, it just shows two people trying to find solace in an impossible situation -- which is really all that life is about anyway -- annihilating meteor or not.",1420675200,,1332,4.567226890756302

5094821,5,B007L6VRHG,"Seeking a friend for the end of the world
a review
 Just in case you value such things, spoiler alert.  Although what I have to say shouldn't actually come as much of a surprise.
 Seeking a friend for the end of the world is an end-of-the-world movie in which the world actually ends.
 There are actually a number of complicated love stories in this romantic comedy about the end of times.  In the premise, an asteroid is Earthbound and the team sent to destroy it has failed (a knowing wink to the legions of movies about catastrophic asteroid impacts).  One protagonist, Dodge, has been living heretofore a meaningless and unsatisfying life.  He works for the insurance industry at a banal job; his wife leaves him at the start of the film; even his attempt at suicide early in the story is a failure.  He wakes not only still alive, but saddled with a dog some stranger has left him.
 The other protagonist, Penny, is more hedonistic but her life is, ultimately, equally banal.  Her primary relationship is with her record collection.  This is partially a movie about missed connections: Penny missed her last chance to visit her family in England, and a mail mix-up combined with her lack of responsibility cause Dodge to miss a letter from an old girlfriend.  It also has much to do with banality, empty hedonism, and what really matters.
 Initially following the news of the impending disaster, Dodge continues his job as if nothing is different.  Others party, using drugs and engaging in casual sex.  There are, after all, no more consequences.  One man, shunning suicide as sinful, takes out a contract on his own life.  One police officer pulls over Penny and Dodge for speeding and winds up impounding their vehicle, locking them in a prison cell.  Work and rules are thus demonstrated as banal, as are wish fulfillment and self-indulgence.
 My own favorite scene takes place at a restaurant chain called Friendsies, where the servers have taken over.  They come to work not out of mindless rote or an inability to adapt, but because they love one another and enjoy feeding people.  The servers are portrayed humorously as having very permeable boundaries, sitting in the booth with Penny and asking to touch her hair; Penny is unaware anything is inappropriate.  That the night devolves into yet another drug-addled orgy perhaps is not surprising, but this time genuine love and even agape are involved.  Here is a turning point in the story.
 Predictably, there is a love affair between Penny and Dodge.  Penny is trying to make up for her irresponsibility by helping Dodge track down his former lover but he has lost interest in this mission, knowing he loves Penny.  Meanwhile, he makes a number of sacrifices to help her get home to England, not the least of which is resolving some issues with his estranged father.
 At the end of the film, however, Penny is unable to complete her journey, preferring to return to Dodge and spend her last moments on Earth with him.
 ""I thought we were going to save each other,"" she says.
 ""We did,"" he replies.
 Aside from the ability to draw laughs from the strange situations surrounding the actually quite inevitable end of life, the film is remarkable in that the world actually does end at the end.  It is not a Hollywood movie and so does not have a Hollywood ending.  Watching the scene fade to white as the world is annihilated is actually uncomfortable because of the hundred clichs we have all seen in such movies.  Last-second interventions, unlikely victories, deus ex machina.  I found myself watching even through the credits waiting for the savior to work its magic, and it never came.  Things were allowed to end as they naturally must.
 Right now we are in the midst of calamity.  In movies, even this movie, it is some rogue space object that can and must be stopped that does for us.  In actuality, it is our own behavior, or at least the behavior of psychopathic corporate, for-profit interests.  We could do something about climate change.  Like an asteroid, breaking it into smaller pieces might not be helpful but we could change the course of the phenomenon with sufficient will.
 But we are hedonists, like Penny, or workaday slobs like Dodge, or rules-obsessed officers of law like the cop who arrests them.  Otherwise our reactions to knowing the end is coming are to escape - through drugs or sex or movies.
 We could save ourselves.  My least favorite thing about the film is the implication that becoming good people is the best we can do, become good people and die as such.  We could become good people and therefore take some action.  Unlike Dodge's mixture of cough syrup and window cleaner, our suicide is looking to be pretty successful.",1413417600,,4726,4.757687576875769

Please stop now and just sit down with one or more people you care about and watch this film on a good sound system if possible because the soundtrack adds a great deal to it and is extremely important to the film. Oh, and if you're worried about Steve Carrell, don't be--he's fantastic. The reason for the four stars instead of five: Keira Knightley overacts in places, and should have dialed back on the exaggerated facial expressions and ""reactions."" Even so, however, it's a fine film. This might remind those of a certain age of the book ""On the Beach"" as it displays the variety of ways people respond--or do not respond at all--to the world's imminent end.",1408406400,,986,4.666666666666667

5094918,5,B007L6VRHG,"An important take on finitude and commitment to other people.  This isn't just about what we would do IF the end was near.  It is about what we ought to do because it is ALWAYS true that we are finite, dying beings.  Steve Carell and Keira Knightley are a wonderful pair together, and they work through a shocking end to middle-class life.  What they find out, given the disruption of middle class existence, is that what really matters is how relationships begin and how they continue in the present with the ever-present thought that each moment is an eternal commitment.  [Note: this movie REALLY is not just about an asteroid.  Or, rather, not all asteroids come from outer space.  Sometimes we make our own.]

The lessons I see here: we are not just the results of our imperfect upbringing.  We are not just our class consciousness.  We are not just our failures, our emotions, our drives.  We are our being toward one another.  We are the ability, through disjoining ourselves from nostalgia, resentment, and loss, to see each other now as carving out a future together even facing the end of the world.

What is the perfect response to ""I'm scared!""??  The perfect response is this (if you really mean it): ""I'm really glad I got to know you.""

There is a lot of existentialism and psychoanalysis in this movie's script.  ""You've got a lot of guns and a lot of potato chips.""  It nicely segues away from one typical genre (Rob Cordry's knee-jerk, expletive-laden dark comedy) to a very difficult to play combination of romance and reflection.

There are not many films like it lately.  It is definitely a much different, much needed take on an old novel On The Beach.  There is hope for the flowers.",1406332800,2,1706,4.6610738255033555

When Steve Carrell's character is laying in bed at the end talking to Kiera Knightley's character and she says she wishes they'd had more time, that maybe they should have met each other soon and he responds by saying no, this was the way it was meant to be and he just has that look of love, acceptance and peace.

5094925,5,B007L6VRHG,"Imaginative movie, great story, eccentric characters... and in consideration of the varying reviews, this isn't a film for everyone.
What would YOU do if you had just three weeks to live and there wasn't a way out of it? Some would hire a hit-man so they wouldn't see the end coming. Some would shoot up heroin to Radiohead and curse out their kids; or stock up on guns and potato chips; or just have an all out drug and sex orgy in the hope of dying euphorically happy in a frenzy at Friendsy's. Then there's Dodge and Penny (played by Steve Carell and Kiera Knightly) who just want to hold tight to those they love during their final moments.
It really is a sweet and touching story of two people discovering love stripped of pretenses, expectation and safety nets. As one reviewer pointed out, this movie is quite the existential exploration and journey illuminating the idea that a lifetime of mediocrity, and/or whimsy becomes meaningless when the last final moments are spent fully awake and embracing one's desires.
Do not expect a mindless movie with an applesauce script and storyline. In essence, this really is a thought provoking film that centers on the heavy subject of facing one's death and finding meaning in one's life. However, it is served on quite an enjoyable platter presenting some great characters, funny scenes, and tearful moments. Hats off to Carell and Knightly (also Martin Sheen and William Peterson, among others who pop up) who make their job look so easy in emoting these two wonderful characters that will stay with you when the screen fades to black.
PS - if you happen question or get into the debate about whether or not ""that"" plane would make ""that"" trip, just let it go.... it's a movie, not a re-creation of an event.

I loved the calmness of most people, despite the city rioters (heck, cities have rioters when verdicts don't go their way...you know who you are....). And I loved the music...especially the beach scene where people are lined up to be baptized.

All in all, a beautiful movie. The ending is perfectly romantic even if sad. For me, this movie is probably spot on as to how most people would behave if they had 3 weeks to live.

If you are looking for Big Momma's House type humor, this isn't the movie for you. The humor isn't slapstick and obvious. It's ironic, and thought-provoking.",1401840000,4,794,4.462068965517242

I'm glad I saw this on HBO, so I didn't have to put out any out-of-pocket change to see this dog.

And scientifically speaking, they send a ""manned"" rocket to the meteor/asteroid? And only to meet it three weeks before it hits Earth? To do what? Explore it? REALLY!!!

Even when the movie came out, a little before the DVD came out, NASA is already tracking large asteroids which could potentially strike Earth. And they have enough precision to track it years in advanced before the impact event. Enough time to send robot probes to the asteroid to slowly nudge it off-course or do something else early on so that it wouldn't strike Earth. (As per Michio Kaku at CUNY and other scientists on the Science Channel) BTW - a meteor impact destroying the dinosaurs is still controversial.

My point - destroy the Earth with something more realistic, like a series of supervolcanoes exploding all at once worldwide. The first starting with Old Faithful at Yellowstone National Park. At least it would be a more exciting movie, with the Earth trembling, volcanic debris raining from the heavens, volcanic gases poisoning the atmosphere, people running around in panic, it'll at least be as exciting as the ""Last Days of Pompeii"".

The soundtrack is great and perfectly suited to the movie.  I've seen it several times on HBO and purchased the DVD, as I know I will want to see it again.

There were 2 flaws (for me) in the film that nearly cost it a star but the rest is so good that I decided to overlook them.  The first one comes when a woman is reporting on traffic during a newscast...her comment is predicable and her delivery painfully unfunny.  The second comes from a buddy of Steve Carell's character during a party with friends.  He drunkenly goes on and on about his new status with women, owing to the end of the world and lower standards for some, and the scene should have ended long before it did.  Yeah, we GET it already.

I think my generation is seriously lost when it comes to pretty much everything, love being the most. This movie shows you how age difference, and all the other superficial things do not matter. Love is unpredictable and doesn't fit into the categories we all try to stuff it in. It certainly isn't going through a million pictures on match, or hair color, eye color, job and age range. There is an unspoken connection between two people when they meet that's pretty magical that this movie taps in to.

The story is one that touches us all because it is about literally the end of the world! We all face our own end in some way. To share the experience in this film with these actors is a gift. It also includes great humor and even those who take the end extremely seriously in the film are very entertaining. I think there is much truth in this film. There are suprises, too. All in all it is a film with a heart and soul as it deals with ""the end"" in an entertaining and profound way. It also does not shy from the negative way some humans deal with the soon to come end, as well.",1385337600,,708,4.064285714285714
5095063,4,B007L6VRHG,"SEEKING A FRIEND FOR THE END OF THE WORLD is a definite genre bender.  It's a comedy with a definite dark edge (the end of the world, anyone?).  It's also a tender, poignant love story portrayed in a heartfelt manner, a love story centering around impish free spirit Penny (Kiera Knightley), and moody, despondent, down-to-earth Dodge (Steve Carell).  Talk about bad hair days.  On the day Dodge and his wife learn that super asteroid 'Matilda' is going to strike the earth in three weeks, ending human life, his wife literally bails.  Facing Armageddon alone, Dodge is depressed and in despair; the only sympathy he collects is from a stray Heinz 57 mutt.  Meanwhile, humanity has transitioned into a handful of layers:  the hedonists, who are going to party until the party's over; the deniers, who continue to live their lives like they always have; and those who cannot handle what's taking place, and select suicide.  Into this mix comes Penny, a neighbor of Dodge whom he barely knows, who has some of Dodge's mail going back three years. . .including a letter from Dodge's high school sweetheart, where she proclaims Dodge is ""the love of my life.""  And Penny, whose family is across the pond, wishes to get back to them to spend the last remaining days with her loved ones; thus a road trip is in order, a journey to find Dodge's old flame, and a journey to seek a way to get Penny aboard a plane (the airlines have shut down).  And the road trip depicts the overall charm of SEEKIING A FRIEND FOR THE END OF THE WORLD.

There are some true comedic moments in this film, yet the underlying love story, an evolving affection between Penny and Dodge as they embark on their trip, trumps the comedy.  The emotional climax begins when Dodge and his father (Martin Sheen at his best) reconcile, having been estranged for years, and ends with Penny and Dodge holding one another as Matilda literally can be heard entering the earth's atmosphere.  It's a dark, bittersweet ending; kudos to director Lorene Scafaria for not coming up with some lame ""solution"" (e.g., Matilda miraculously misses the earth).  A tad uneven with a tendency to meander, SEEKING A FRIEND FOR THE END OF THE WORLD will still put a smile on your face--and a lump in your throat.  Yes, opposites do attract; and I'll never listen to The Hollies' ""All I Need is the Air That I Breathe"" ambivalently again.

While it does ask viewers to contemplate what is truly worthwhile, the primary characters were rather pathetic devices for moving what might have been a profound story forward. I appreciated the ending scene, which might have been the most authentic moment between the two main characters, but this was a movie that was too frivolous to take seriously, and not funny enough to be taken as satire.

I love Steve Carrell, both as a comedian and a dramatic actor. Keira,I had a love hate relationship with until I realized how adaptable and effortless she can change her roles and be just as comfortable in merchant ivory as well as quirky comedy. A true chameleon,a versatile actress.

This is probably one of the most truthful movies I have ever seen about the end of the world, and how people/society would react. Just as we all are different in how we handle stress or loss or being spontaneous..so shall we all have varying paths to take when death is inevitable. There will be riots, and panic, desperation, fear, sadness. Some people will have massive amounts of energy and go seek everything they always wanted to do. Some will shut themselves inside and deny its all happening. Some will want to kill themselves, or do really dangerous things that would otherwise be thought of as illegal, or morally wrong.

Its a free for all. So what does a man who never felt free in a pre-asteroid world do? His wife leaves him as soon as the news tells of the harbinger of death. He still goes to work because what else is there? His world is empty, meaningless ...but below that surface is a want to tie things up with lost family, lost loves, the loss of himself. In that journey he is joined by a young woman who is also seeking a way home, a way to love in the end.

It is creative and imaginative...not your typical ""end of the world"" movie.  It isn't all doom and gloom with good doses of comedy.  Kiera Knightly sparkles as Penny who doesn't go anywhere without her collection of record albums.  She is fun and tries to be carefree (as much as you can be carefree knowing the end of the world is in a few weeks) as opposed to Dodge (Steve Carrell) who has had his heart broken when his wife left him.  The ways in which people in general (in this movie anyway) handle their mortality is interesting, surprising and some of it is common.

5095157,5,B007L6VRHG,"Every once in a while, great stars join together to do an Indie film. THIS, is one of those films. And after watching this, I see why they did this movie.

So the movie starts with a 40 year old Carell and his wife sitting in a car, listening to a newscast that the shuttle mission sent to destroy asteroid Mathilda, has failed, and that the world will end in 3 weeks. Carell's wife looks at him like he wasted her life, and runs from the car. That simple 60 seconds sets the tone for the rest of the film. After wasting a week moping, Carell meets Knightly, his downstairs neighbor who has a `long sleep' disorder. From the start, they seem to be total opposites. She is flighty, and he is a calm, suppressed man mired in a suppressed job selling insurance. If I give you ANY details, it ruins the desire to see this film. Let's just say, they find they fill holes in each other, and as they road trip to see people before the end, they discover they fill those holes. Watching them grow is like a fine wine....it just gets better.

I am having a hard time reviewing this movie because I loved it (telling everything ruins it), and the viewer really needs to experience for themselves, how you get totally drawn into Carell and Kightly. The even pace of Carell and the oddness of Khightly (and trust me, she is odd) is like a goulash that finally comes together, but only with days left before the asteroid strike.

One of the best scenes is the party where Carell's friends try to set him up with an easy chick after his wife leaves, and he won' go for it because he `isn't ready'. The other is when Carell and  Knightly go to an ex-boyfriend's of Knightly's who has a titanium bomb shelter believes he and his friends will repopulate the world after the strike. The irony being, they are all men, and the world be be scoured. This movie is filled with irony of how people try to cope with the end of all things.

I give the writers big kudos for not having the `Hollywood Ending'. Trust me, the last 60 seconds of this movie, will bring you to tears, even if you are a strong person. It's worth it for the message it brings. Life is too short. If you find what brings you happiness, keep it, and keep it until all things end.

Again, it's hard for me to do a review and give away all the nuances of a movie. Part of watching a good film, is allowing it to unfold and discover. If you want action, this is the wrong movie. If you enjoy characters who grow, and you care about them, this is a perfect movie.",1373846400,2,2508,4.247379454926625

Some of the choices (by various characters in this movie) are sad, some are funny, and some are emotional.

5095162,4,B007L6VRHG,"Note: May contain spoilers. Proceed with caution.

It's the end of the world!... for the 100th time in three years. Yes, while the whole end of the world theme has been pretty overdone recently, none of those films even come close to the beauty of this one. As the credits started rolling I found myself in tears and I wasn't able to regain my composure for a good fifteen minutes. Still, as I continued to fight back tears for the remainder of the night, I found myself unable to take my mind off of what I just watched. The emotion was so raw, the romance so pure, it was unlike anything I have witnessed in a movie. Don't get me wrong, there's been films that have made me emotional, but what went down with Seeking a Friend for the End of the World was an entirely different experience.

As the movie begins you quickly get caught up on what's going on. At this point we meet Dodge Paterson (Steve Carell) and learn that the mission to take down the asteroid known as Matilda has failed. Not only that, but the people of Earth only have three weeks left to live. It doesn't take long before Dodge meets Penny (Keira Knightley) and pretty soon they're off on their adventure together. You see, they both have different goals. Dodge wants to reconnect with the one that got away while Penny wants to get back to her family. Along the way an unexpected romance surfaces between these two individuals and the audience sees that, in some cases, opposites really do attract. Carell's character is a man we've seen him play many times before; unsure of himself, a little hesitant about interacting with people, etc. Penny, on the other hand, is this raw, unkempt woman who was never able to find her path in life.

One of the things I really loved about this movie was seeing just how different everyone reacted to what was going on. Some people started riots, some partied, worked on their bucket list, continued with their daily routine (work, mowing the lawn, etc.), went back to their families, or hid in a shelter. It gave me a weird feeling because how are you even supposed to react to something like that? There isn't a guideline on how to live when you know that the end is coming; you just have to figure it out yourself. It was all very dark because some people gave up while others seemed to be in denial.

Now I would have never thought that a Carell/Knightley team-up would work, but I would be lying if I said it didn't. While these two don't have what would be considered ""normal"" chemistry, it works given the context of the movie. Because their time is coming to a close they no longer have the same judgmental attitude that probably plagued them in the past. Instead, they got to know each other on a purely fundamental level and they're genuinely interested in learning about who they are and where they're from because they were previously living on completely opposite sides of the spectrum. With that said, towards the end I felt the advancement of their relationship felt a bit rushed, but it was something that had to be done to achieve the beautiful ending we were given.

Which brings me to my last major point about the plot, Seeking a Friend for the End of the World is not a comedy. Well, not really anyway. It can be funny at times, but it's not meant to be laugh out loud funny. Instead, most of the laughs come from seeing just how different everyone is reacting to their current situation. Whether it's Dodge's cleaning lady who won't stop cleaning his place or the cop who's still taking his job too seriously, it's the social aspect that makes you chuckle right before it gets you thinking. Also, the ending is harsh. The conclusion to the story isn't happy and it's basically there to make you feel sad. The emotional impact wouldn't have been possible without that weird chemistry between Carell and Knightley that I was talking about earlier. If anything, Seeking a Friend could probably be labeled as a RomCom that relies heavily on Drama. It's very heavy and touching, but with light comedic elements to not make it feel like a burden to watch.

The casting in the film was very well done. On the main front you have Carell and Knightley, but the movie is also filled with more than a few minor appearances. It would be a chore to list them all, so I'll just name a few. Along with the two leads you get appearances by Patton Oswalt, Martin Sheen, T.J. Miller, Melanie Lynskey, and Rob Corddry. Carell and Knightley, of course, steal the show, but it was nice to see a few familiar faces. Carell plays the same character we've seen him play before, but Knightley's performance helps add some spice to the mix. This has to be the first role I've seen her in where she wasn't playing a serious character, but she pulled it off wonderfully. After watching the movie I can't picture anyone else playing Penny.

Finally, the music in this movie is fantastic. Between the soundtrack and the score, composed by Rob Simonsen & Jonathan Sadoff, your ears are constantly being serenaded by beautiful sounds. The score was beautifully composed, bringing an added touch of emotion to each and every scene. Then the soundtrack - which consists of music from The Beach Boys, The Hollies, and The Walker Brothers - seems to add this somber peacefulness to an otherwise dire situation. I don't know, it all just seemed to fit perfectly with what was going on in each scene.

Overall Score: 8.75/10 - I find it difficult to sum up my feelings for Seeking a Friend. It was better than I anticipated while at the same time giving me something totally different than what I expected. I wasn't expecting it to move me the way it did, but I'm kind of glad it did. It's pure and it's honest and the ending is heartbreakingly beautiful. I can't recommend it enough.",1372982400,,5779,4.555341674687199
5095163,5,B007L6VRHG,"This review is about the movie itself, not the DVD. I had high hopes for this film when it was first released, but all of my friends told me that they heard that it was awful, so I did not go see it. Now, I wish I had gone to see it in the theatre. This is now one of my favorite movies of all time, because it is brilliant. It is essentially a buddy / odd couple dramedy set against the end of the world as a compelling backdrop. It is very bitter-sweet. This film takes you through the broad range of the emotional spectrum from enthusiasm, excitement, fear, fun, happiness, joy, love, nostalgia to sadness. The movie starts with Dodge (Steve Carell). His wife leaves him when they find out that the world is going to end, as in an asteroid dubbed 'Matilda' will destroy the Earth in a cataclysmic collision in three weeks time. Dodge is an introspective middle-aged man. While everyone else is just partying and enjoying their final three weeks, Dodge seems to just want to spend his remaining time doing something meaningful and special. He meets his neighbor, Penny (Keira Knightley), who is very outgoing and talkative. Despite their age difference and the vast differences in their personalities, the two strike up an unlikely bond. They escape out of urbania when a riot breaks out and go in search of Dodge's long lost love and Dodge has also promised Penny that he will get her on a plane so that she can spend her final days with her family in England. I do not want to give any spoilers, but the ending is truly delightful.

In a sense, this film kind of fits into the Visionary category, because I came away from this movie with more than just having been entertained and escaped from everyday life. This movie tackled a really huge question... What is the meaning of life. Usually philosophical films that take on that whopper of a question are fairly serious (not counting Monty Python's The Meaning of Life)... And Seeking a Friend For the End of the World breaks the mould by being really funny in a clever, intelligent, ironic, satirical, subtle and witty kind of way. I think this film is very charming.

The difference between this movie and the average Hollywood blockbuster, is that this story actually has heart. At times I laughed hysterically and at others I cried my eyes out. The performances here by both Carell and Knightley are fantastic. Keira Knightley especially shines. The soundtrack is also amazing.

In my personal opinion, Seeking a Friend For the End of the World is lightyears ahead of other end of the world and natural disaster films (because it has heart) like Armageddon, Dante's Peak, Melancholia, The Day After Tomorrow, This is the End, Volcano, 2012, etc. The only end of the world / natural disaster film that even comes close to being on the same level as Seeking a Friend For the End of the World is the Core... Another movie which I love while most people thought it was average. I highly recommend this film for someone looking for something that differs from your average ho-hum Hollywood flick.",1372982400,2,3049,4.632162661737523

5095187,5,B007L6VRHG,"Seeking a Friend for the End of the World by Lorene Scafaria has become one of my favorite movies.  This jewel of creative thought was shamelessly pulled from the theaters before it could find an audience.  Drivel and schlock fill the cineplex and apparently there's no room for something different.  The early reviews were mixed and mostly centered on what it wasn't, causing its early ouster. I feel compelled to defend what it is.

This is a darkly comic yet heartfelt look at other side of a pending apocalypse.  Blockbusters like Armageddon tell what our bigger than life heroes might do to save the day, but what about the rest of us, just waiting for the end?  What do we do?  What would you do?

The story is about a sad sack who laments his misspent life and flighty homesick free spirit, thrown together in the final days.  Each deciding to help the other they embark on a quest to find his lost love and get her back home.  The genius is in their encounters and the back round satire, both subtle and not.  The last third is for anyone with a beating heart and the ending is spot on perfect.

I found the critiques totally off the mark.  One complaint was about its ""jarring tonal shifts."" Yes, the end of the world can be a bit unnerving.  Some didn't like Steve Carell, but nobody plays a deflated sole better. And there is no shortage of Keira Knightley detractors. Well, they are just flat out wrong.  Think Keira and Steve don't belong together?  They don't. That is entirely the point. This movie makes you feel.  It makes you think.  It gets more captivating with every viewing.  And that, my friends, is the true essence of art.

Watch it and let its slow burn win you over and then afterward see if you don't ask yourself, what you would do?",1371340800,8,1761,4.460815047021944

5095191,5,B007L6VRHG,"(Please note this review does contain spoilers, but they are vague. You won't know exactly what happens, but you'll grasp the premise including the final scene, so please take note)

I normally have a great deal of understanding for differing opinions of various films. Except here. I can only reasonably conclude that people who detest this film either have no connection to their emotions, or more likely, are conditioned to bawk at any film romance as a manipulative contrivance.

Seeking a Friend for the End of the World is a film I viewed with no expectations other than hoping to be at least somewhat entertained. I certainly didn't expect to be emotionally floored, holding back the welling tears as the final scene unfolds and then...fades.

The film's weakest parts are thankfully in the first third. After that, the film picks up steam and emotional gravitas almost exponentially, scene by scene as it transitions from black comedy to an absolutely devastating love story. I'd argue both Carrel and Knightley give the performances of their careers, as they build a kind of unexpected chemistry you will NOT see coming during the film's initial third.

The basic premise, of course, is that the world is ending. What does one do if given only weeks to live? Better yet, what SHOULD one do? Carrel's life is on the outs, regardless of the asteroid but is given the chance to rekindle a lost romance with an old flame. Knightley's quirky optimistic nature is also threatened by her desire for something more meaningful than her self-absorbed boyfriend, and her very understandable desire to see her parents once more, back in England. Through comedic yet understandable events of the impending apocalypse, the unlikely pair are brought together and decide to help one another attain their final wishes.

To its credit, the film never submits to cliched, saccharine rom-com norms. It's much more intent to layer a kind of subtle propulsion of depth and charm, once again scene by scene, as Carrel and Knightley start realizing the only answer to what to do with the last weeks of their life is be around one another. During the final act,(after Carrel realizes the only thing he's searching for has been with him the entire time) Carrel offers a gesture of breathtaking selflessness that you won't see coming, and you're left wondering how the film could possibly end. Thematically tying it all together, Knightley returns by also sacrificing her initial intentions. Her emotions pouring out of her eyes and body language as she realizes the soul mate she's never had has found her only days before the world is to end.

I've mentioned it once, but trust me. The final scene is devastating yet absolutely beautiful. Purely, subtly, charmingly spellbinding. The pair lay in bed, as the asteroid makes its final approach. Knightley beginning to tremble with fear, her brimming optimism completely gone, replaced with only the realization that she's found real love much too late; completely juxtaposed by Carrel's tonal shift to a stoic guardian, tenderly caressing her hair while gazing so intently, it's almost as if he's looking through her, all to happy to have finally found someone to give his empty life meaning. It's touching. It's heartbreaking. It's everything a romance should be on film, and here it's so affecting I had to fight back the tears.

Somehow these two found an on screen chemistry (without seeing the movie, it seems impossible for Steve Carrel and Keira Knightley to have romantic chemistry) that carries the film, propelled by stellar performances and motivated by highest of stakes. If the world is ending and you've only weeks to live, you best spend it meaningfully. The explosion of emotion the final scene portrays, and in fact the entire film, is simply profound.

Highly, highly recommended. Check all preconceived notions at the door. And understand you're watching a love story. A real, human love story.",1370908800,4,3945,5.021406727828746
5095192,4,B007L6VRHG,"""If you're just tuning in... the  final mission to save mankind has failed."" Oh, crap. That's something you don't want to hear from your television news anchorman. A 70-mile-wide asteroid hurtles toward our planet, poised to arrive in three weeks' time. Our would-be saviors - them experts and scientists and world leaders - have tried everything and now given up the ghost. If you're raring for a wild sci-fi disaster film, give yourself a time out. This film isn't about heroes and last-minute saves. It's about folks like you and me and how they react to the end times. It's also got this flavor of an indie rom-com. In SEEKING A FRIEND FOR THE END OF THE WORLD Steve Carell doesn't hop on a space shuttle to plant a nuclear device on the asteroid.

He instead adopts a dog and plays his harmonica and goes in search of his lost love. Steve Carell plays Dodge, a sad-faced insurance agent (which is all kinds of ironic), whose wife, once the bad news broke out over the car radio, lit out of that car as if she were a Stark and the Rains of Castamere just started playing. Carell's movie wife is played by his real-life wife, Nancy, and I'm 71% positive her abrupt flight doesn't reflect their real-life relationship. There I go spearheading rumors. They're fine.

As the clock winds down to Armageddon, Dodge quietly goes about his everyday routine, even as the world falls apart around him. But here's his catalyst in the shape of adorable downstairs neighbor Penny (Keira Knightley), whom Dodge finds slumped over outside his fire escape and weeping. Penny has tried (and failed piteously) to catch any one of the last few flights out to England, her home. And there won't be anymore flights out ever. He lets her into his apartment. They get to talking. He mentions knowing a pilot who could fly her out. And when the riots come, they embark on a road trip, she hopefully on her way back home, he hopefully to reconnect with his one true love. Cue the dog left in his care and the harmonica he sporadically plays. These cute embellishments, I suppose, make him a bit more endearing, this emotionally-stunted man done with selling insurance.

There's a raunchy apocalyptic comedy coming out tomorrow titled THIS IS THE END, and I'll probably go see that one. I'm assuming that movie strikes a very different tone than this one, even though both films play for laughs. There's a pensiveness to SEEKING A FRIEND..., a sense of melancholia. I think Carell and Knightley have a surprising chemistry. Her role calls for a certain free-spirited flourish. He is an existential wasteland on legs. They are diametric opposites, and that's why the interplay between them is so interesting. It's weird to match up Carell and Knightley as a romantic couple. But because their performances are so good and level, and because their scenes together are sweet and played without that knowing wink - and because the premise IS the end of the world - in which anything goes - well, I bought it. Keira Knightley, by the way, proves she's got what it takes to be a fine comedienne. I prefer this Knightley to her high-brow period piece incarnation.

At the end of the world it's not an exaggeration to say that there's this palpable elegiac feel, of things slipping away, of this sense that this is the last time you'll be doing whatever it is you're doing. As Dodge and Penny navigate their road trip, they run into people made strange by their impending extinction. It lends insight into how disparate groups of people would cope. It gives the film opportunities for hilarious celebrity cameos (Patton Oswalt, not so much, sorry). The funniest set piece is Dodge and Penny's stop at Friendsy's, a restaurant chain that's devolved into a hedonistic den of impromptu hugs and orgies. Shame on T.G.I.F. for rejecting the filmmakers' request to use their good name.

In watching this, I wasn't expecting that sudden stab of heartbreak, but there it was. The final moments are devastating, and yet there's this last fleeting glimpse of a glorious smile. At the end of the world, I guess it's the best happy ending one could hope for.

5095225,4,B007L6VRHG,"Steve Carell plays Dodge. It's a character he has played many times before: the nice guy who's been passed over. The good guy who's never got a break and who spends his life waiting for something wonderful to come along, which of course it never does - until now. Kiera Knightley plays Penny. A British expatriot living in the same apartment building with her doltish hippie boyfriend who sponges off of her. Penny and Dodge have absolutely nothing in common, until the arrival of an impending Extinction Level Event. An astroid is about to hit the earth ending life for most, perhaps all of humanity. People react the way you'd expect: the buttoned up types become instant hedonists, the crazies act even crazier and the depressives feel vindicated, but are even more depressed. Lastly, there are people like Dodge's housemaid, who continues to come to clean even as the planet is about to get pulverized. The film is about the unlikely pairing of Dodge and Penny, who have some adventures trying to connect with people from their past in distant places. There is a comforting ending notwithstanding the mass deaths of the entire cast at the end, which the director wisely leaves to our imaginations. This is a bittersweet film, with no pretensions of Oscar nominations. It's largely predictable. The real pleasure comes from the October-May relationship between Dodge and Penny. For him, it's the first time in his life he connects with someone he truly loves and is loved in return. For Penny, who's a bit of a ditz, Dodge's earthy pragmatism grounds her and gives her the comfort she needs, but didn't think she wanted. There is a juxtaposition of humor and pathos in this film, which works well and that's due entirely to Carell and Knightley. It's kind of nice to see a good guy end up with a sweet girl, even if it happens late in the game. Better late than never.",1370217600,,1871,4.742331288343558
5095226,5,B007L6VRHG,"I disagree with the comparisons to Melancholia - that's a very superficial analysis. These both deal w end of the world scenarios but that's where the similarities stop.

'Seeking a Friend' is really charming, and that's owed a lot to Carell and Knightley. And Sorry, the dog. Wherein Melancholia made me hate every character because they were so unempathetic, 'Seeking a Friend' does the exact opposite. I genuinely liked both of the characters, which made me keep wondering 'what will happen? Is everyone really going to die? Gee, I hope not' whereas in Melancholia it was an 'eh.'

It's a charming and cute movie, I think that's the best way to put it. Its goal is also to make you think about what is most important to you, and what will you regret doing or not doing at the end of your life. Melancholia didn't make me think that way afterwards, but this one definitely did.

I give major props to any movie that can leave you thinking about it long after you've watched it. I keep thinking about what I want to do, and what I'll regret having not done when I reach my own 'end of the world.'

5095264,4,B007L6VRHG,"I'm a *guy* for crying out loud- I shouldn't like Seeking a Friend for the End of the World!  It's somewhat romantic and a slow-moving one at that!  And yet... I do.  I do like the movie.  Sigh, haha.

Even though a movie focusing on the end of the world should absolutely focus on the obvious emotional points such as fear, sadness and devastation, this movie takes the concept and uses it in a different way.  Not just different, but somewhat creative and refreshing.  An old concept with a new spin I guess you could say!

For a while however, it's hard to look beyond the slow-moving plotline and even harder to look beyond the fact that Steve Carell is starring in such a movie.  He's a comedian for crying out loud!  But... get this, Seeking a Friend for the End of the World *does* actually utilize comedy but it's done in a subtle way.  This is part of the cleverness I mention above.  It's a fairly original concept that I was actually getting absorbed into last night, and enjoying it.

While I'm definitely glad the writers chose to include elements of people breaking out into the streets and being destructive knowing their lives are soon to be over as a result of an asteroid heading for the planet that will destroy everything and everyone, later on when Steve ventures off into the country it's somewhat weird and perhaps eerie that everything out there has remained perfectly normal and calm.

Anyway, it's about Steve wanting to hook up with an old flame from years ago, however a new girl suddenly enters his life.  A girl that apparently can sleep for days, haha.  Despite Steve knowing he only has less than 21 days until the world is destroyed, the search for his old girlfriend is now somewhat complicated due to the arrival of this new girl.  Steve has feelings for her as well.  Along the way Steve and the girl (played by Keira Knightley by the way, who's an amazing actress) go on a roadtrip to search for the girl.  They get involved in their own dilemmas along the way.  Typical adventure stuff here (despite much of it being funny and awesome) but... keep watching.

I never understood where exactly the old girlfriend was when Steve and Keira eventually end up at her house and spend the night, but... who cares.

This next part contains mild spoilers (since you can put the pieces together and figure out what happens at the end) so you might not want to read on.  You've been warned.

There's two things in the second half I absolutely LOVE!  One is the use of the Hollies classic ""The Air That I Breathe"" one of the most tear-jearking and beautiful ballads ever written, played in its entirety (amazingly enough).  How many times is a song played the ENTIRE way through?  This is used for one segment involving a plane ride.  One of my personal favorite moments in the movie.  So beautiful and touching.

However the ending... oh man, the ending.  Knowing in the back of our minds that all civilization is about to cease due to an approaching asteroid, without spoiling what happens, the ending is *superb*.  Incredibly sad.  The look in Keira's eyes bothers me quite a bit because she's so emotional with both happiness and sadness taking over her feelings during one particular moment.  You *badly* want her to live but... ugh.  So sad.

5095291,5,B007L6VRHG,"SEEKING A FRIEND FOR THE END OF THE WORLD is an odd, quirky and touching film.  It is NOT a raucous comedy (despite the presence of Steve Carrell and folks like Rod Cordry), but it is pretty funny throughout.  It is NOT a romance in a traditional sense, yet it is an unusual love story.

The movie starts as the world learns that the last efforts to stop a huge asteroid from slamming into it have failed.  Three weeks is all the planet has remaining.  Immediately upon hearing the doomsday proclamation, Steve Carrell's wife leaves him.  We learn their marriage hasn't been great for a long time...but the sudden abandonment leaves Carrell a bit stunned.  We sense he has probably been unhappy for a long time, because he continues to go through the motions of his life even as chaos slowly descends around him.  It's as though the world has finally caught up to HIS condition...fatalistic and seeing no real reason to care about anything.

Then he meets his next door neighbor (Keira Knightley) a British girl who has just broken up with her boyfriend, and with the end of the world coming, wishes she could get back to Britain to see her parents one last time (which is tough, because airlines are grounded).  The two head out into the world, with Carrell offering to get Knightley to someone he knows that owns a plane...and her offering to help him find his ""first love""...the girl that got away.

Along the way they have many amusing encounters...most notably at a Chili's-like restaurant that has decided to ""get creative"" with its menu.  They encounter zaniness, they encounter suicide, and they encounter families that are simply together to enjoy their last few days of beauty and togetherness.  And not surprisingly, a bond grows between these two unlikely companions.

This is a thoughtful and sad movie.  Yes, there were plenty of funny moments, but writer/director Lorene Scafaria is interested in much more.  Trying to make a movie about the end of the world is daunting.  HOW would people act?  What kinds of crazy things would happen?  Scafaria has actually come up with a wide variety of possibilities and she gives us little peeks at each of those, mostly through Carrell's bemused and sad eyes.  (The best is his maid, who keeps coming to work and gets upset when Carrell tells her she doesn't need to clean his apartment anymore.)  But in the end, her wry, funny and sometimes affecting musings on how human along America's east coast might react in the face of the apocalypse are only background to the plight of her two leads.  Their problems, in the great scheme of things, are pretty small...but we learn to care for each of them deeply.

There is the potential for quite a ""creepiness"" factor in partnering Carrell and Knightley.  But Carrell gives one of his best ""serious"" performances here, and although Knightley is occasionally a bit antic and scattered, she generally matches him.  Their relationship, as it progresses, feels logical and right...and we root for them, even as we might worry that Carrell is becoming a bit too much like a Woody Allen character (as in, interested in women far too young).  They make it work as best as a relationship like this could work.

And in the end, I found the movie to be surprisingly effective and touching.  Clearly, this movie will not be for everyone (as its poor box office performance attests), because it is very unconventional in many ways.  But I liked it very much because it WAS surprising.  Scafaria was bursting with ideas for this film, yet it never feels cluttered.  She is able to make most of her observations or assumptions quickly and adroitly.  The film is also full of cameos from some great actors (Patton Oswalt, Connie Britton, Derek Luke, William Petersen and especially Melanie Lynskey, who is terrific in her little role)...each of these experienced performers (and more) are skillful enough to take their brief moments and make something of them...to add to the experience rather than just creating ""oh, look, he's in the movie"" moments.

5095324,3,B007L6VRHG,"Right off the bat, ""Seeking a Friend..."" dispenses with the notion that Earth will be spared an impact by a massive asteroid.  As the opening credits roll, the viewer hears that Man's last hope has failed, and now that everyone must begin to prepare for the inevitable.  This setup is actually the best part of the movie.  Unfortunately, the rest of the movie does not effectively support the setup.

Unlike other cosmic-impact disaster movies like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Deep-Impact/dp/B0023S50DO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Deep Impact</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Meteor/dp/B001NTZHDW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Meteor</a>, where efforts to stop a doomsday impactor get intertwined with human dramas, the human drama takes center stage in ""Seeking a Friend...""  Steve Carrell plays a man whose wife is cheating on him.  He finds this out in a most unusual meet-cute, in which his neighbor, Keira Knightley, gives him mail that has been misdirected to her.  In what are supposed to be the last three weeks of humanity, Carrell and Knightley make a connection, one so strong that he is willing to let her go so that she can see her family across the pond in England.  Not only does she come back - after being given a lift by Carrell's dad, played by Martin Sheen - but she makes it back just before the impact to share sweet nothings with Carrell.

So how exactly does the movie cheat?  Well, if you don't want to know, don't read beyond this sentence.  There's a major spoiler that must be revealed.

If you've decided to read on, here's the spoiler.  The asteroid arrives a week earlier than anticipated, meaning that everyone loses in the end.  It's almost like the people who created this story didn't know exactly how to end it.  Memo to the makers of this film - this is NOT how you end it.  It felt very cheap and very shallow to me.  As such, the movie loses two stars just for that.

It is actually quite refreshing to watch a disaster movie where the disaster is secondary to the plot, as it is in ""Seeking a Friend...""  And for what it is, it's not a bad movie.  But it could've been much better than it was.",1364083200,,2231,5.144444444444445

5095384,5,B007L6VRHG,"Thanks to those pesky Mayans, it seems like we've been plagued over the last few years with several End Of The World films. Like the dreaded asteroids or solar radiation or Rapturous events, you can't escape them. And with many of them, it's hard to enjoy them. We have been getting them from the big Hollywood side (Roland Emmerich's embarrassingly awful 2012), from the art-house side (Lars Von Trier's meandering MELANCHOLIA), and now with Lorene Scafaria's directorial debut, SEEKING A FRIEND AT THE END OF THE WORLD, we get a bit of both in one of the strangest and strangely charming films of 2012.

We begin with a radio broadcast of a failed space shuttle mission to destroy the giant asteroid that spells doom for the entire planet. Dodge (Steve Carell) sits in his car with his wife (a cameo by his real wife Nancy) and hears this, and without warning or explanation, she leaves the car towards parts unknown. Now alone and awaiting the apocalypse, Dodge continues his workaday humdrum, going to his job as an insurance salesman, and receiving calls about the ""Apocalypse Package"" (which covers you in the event that all life on Earth comes to an end). He goes back to his apartment and ruminates about his first love and how he wants to see her before the end. He even goes to a kind of end-of-the-world party with his friends (played by a number of comic and character actors such as Rob Corddry, Connie Britton, Melanie Lynskey, and the hilarious Patton Oswalt), which ends disasterously. He goes home to find the free-spirited Penny (Keira Knightley) weeping outside on his fire escape, regretful about her parents back home in England she won't get to see since all commercial flights are now grounded. They soon embark on a mission for the both of them to get what they feel that they need before it's all over; he will try and get her on a private plane, and she will accompany him to try and meet the former love of his life. In the midst of all of this, they meet and connect with strangers and friends, go to a very sexually liberated ""family"" restaurant, and they make a connection of their own despite their best intentions.

The thing about this film is that nothing really unfolds as you might expect. From the commercials and trailers, you will likely expect a dark yet raunchy screwball romantic comedy about the apocalypse, but writer/director Scafaria has something different in mind. She tells a story that has elements of the screwball rom com, but it ends up being much sweeter, with much more depth and personality rather than taking the quick way out. Carell gives what is probably his most soulful performance to date, which is something of a challenge when you have a big name comic actor like Carell, who can do the super-broad comedy, but who has also shown before, with roles in films like LITTLE MISS SUNSHINE that he has more depth than you'd predict. He plays on the archetype that he presented so well in THE 40-YEAR-OLD VIRGIN, but with more dimensions, and it never really hits a false note. Knightley continues the terrific post-PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN performances we've been seeing from her since she finally up and left that franchise. Like her work in other indie fare such as A DANGEROUS METHOD and NEVER LET ME GO, she's on fire here as the passionate and devil-may-care Penny. She's utterly charming and hopeful, despite the impending doom, and it's so easy to see why Dodge wants to help her. Other performers we see here in more decent-sized cameos, such as William Petersen (in a hilarious role as a stranger who's looking for a very unpredictable end), Adam Brody as Penny's amazingly egocentric former/current boyfriend, Derek Luke as a former boyfriend and super-survivalist, TJ Miller as the wild maitre'd of the restaurant, and Martin Sheen as a surprise character all make the most of their time on-screen and turn in very good work.

Scafaria has only one other significant credit to her name, being the screenwriter of the very quirky NICK AND NORAH'S INFINITE PLAYLIST, but she has a great assuredness not only writing but directing this film as well. Visually, the film is very well made, as well as musically, with a generous helping of songs peppered throughout the soundtrack. The film does change rhythms around the middle of the second act from more of a comedy and into more of a romance, and it might leave you feeling a little confused if you're expecting something typical of most films of this type. But if you're into something that will not only make you laugh, maybe cry, and make you wish you had (or glad that you DO have) that very special someone to share it with, then SEEKING A FRIEND AT THE END OF THE WORLD will make you a very satisfied viewer, and also leave you wondering that if you only had three weeks to live, how you might spend it. Hopefully, you'd spend it as Dodge and Penny do.",1362873600,,4876,4.69392523364486

5095387,2,B007L6VRHG,"""What a film did I just see? After a long night and a curious mind for alternative comedy, Seeking a Friend seemed like a good option not in preparation for last year's apocalypse but for my personal amusement. The trailers and its concept promised quite a lot for a wild ride but the film as a whole was far from spectacular. No offense to the director/writer but this film lacks the kind of satirical bite and chaos it could have took. Instead, it takes a very liberal, slow-paced, disorganised, and disoriented approach to an escape plot with a cold Steve Carrell and a tricky-to-point-out Keira Knightley. It does not know exactly where it is going other than include random jokes, too much drama and depression, and ambiguity. The saving grace that the film holds are few but mostly involve its ambitions to have the kind of indie/hipster film spirit of its core and some of the occasional and holistic naturalism of its dialogue and humour in the first 10-15 minutes. In many ways, it is probably one of the most honest and surreal comedies ever done and might be one of the most challenging and experimental films done too in recent cinema. While I do not recommend apocalypse films due to the pseudo-scientific basis and superficiality behind it, Seeking a Friend does not take itself so seriously about proving something more than lampooning and illustrating chaos through human eyes. But among its pluses, the negatives weigh even larger on the scale. It is hard to recommend a film like this when one realises its objectives can seem tiring once it reaches a certain point in the film. Dark comedies generally tend to have an impact on presenting humour amid disturbing, forbidden and tragic situations but this film only shows its grim overtones incidentally soon sliding back to boredom. If you want subtle comedy and entertainment, watch Doomsday Preppers instead.""",1362873600,,1879,4.893416927899686

In Seeking a Friend the basic plot (the world is ending in 3 weeks, let's do the things we never got around to) should be fairly easy to build into a good story.  Instead, there are completely illogical, poorly contrived plot angles that are poorly acted.  The poor story and dialogue and unconvincing nature of these plot angles were so extreme that I couldn't not ignore them.

5095524,4,B007L6VRHG,"Like it?  Love it?  I am somewhere in-between.  I am not sure what it is about this movie that got me to watch it twice, but I am definitely drawn to it.  While the premise may seem ridiculous, spending your end of days with a complete stranger, somehow it works.  It is not wholly impossible that the earth could be struck by a life destroying meteor, it's happened before, but it is not something I think about.  Although, the cosmic explosion over Russia last week that injured about 1000 people gave pause for thought.  Anyways, there is a sadness to this movie as the main character played by Steve Carell looks back on his life and sees how empty it has been, from lost love, to a loveless marriage, to ending up alone. He then befriends his younger, spirited neighbor, played by Keira Knightly, and in this relationship that spans a couple of weeks, he is more alive than he has ever been in his adult life.  She awakens in him the man he once was.  But their love is brief as the movie comes to a close, in what was for me, a very real and haunting vision of what that end might be like.

Unlike many Hollywood movies that never go beyond cheap sentimentality, this movie digs a little deeper and addresses, in a humorous way, how people might actually behave if the world was ending. The main character doggedly presses on with his life as long as he can, but then realizes that there is more to existence and goes in search of that deeper connection to other people with the help of his next door neighbor, who it turns out knew more about his old life than he did.
Along the way, the two run into a strange array of people, some in denial about the pending disaster, others gone wild in the face of their impending demise.

Yeah, this was great.  Oh, and I'm from the part of the country it was supposed to be set in, and it looked nothing like here.  Was it shot in San Bernadino?

Watching poor Steve's safe marriage end the second that the announcement of the Earth's impending doom is made - funny but oh so dark. I truly wonder how many people would experience or would do the same thing were such an announcement to be made... Anyways, the movie left my wife and I feeling pretty down - not how a comedy is supposed to be, but at least I didn't feel like I'd lost 2 hrs of my life, and it inspired some conversation after we shut it down.

5095613,5,B007L6VRHG,"Perhaps this movie just caught me at the right moment but I enjoyed it very much. It is sort of a unusual road movie that examines just what it is that is really important in our lives. I agree that the tone is a little uneven and it meanders a little at times but the central performances are very strong, it has a mood all of its own and a very beautiful soundtrack.

Highly affecting. and I think the end of the world would be like this. Some people would go mad but the lights would stay on and most of us would just go on living our lives, and doing the things that make our lives meaningful (our relation to other human beings mostly). This film brushes against something deep and magical about human existence.

I can see why some people are disappointed though. The UK packaging has a quote on the cover ""The Apocalypse has never been so funny"" There is comedy in this movie but only as part of quite a rich mix of other things, If you are looking for Date Night or The 40 Year Old Virgin, well, it definitely isn't that. If you want a thoughtful and gentle film about what it is that makes us human and our crazy place in the universe then I would definitely recommend this.",1360108800,,1183,4.230088495575221

It raises many questions ( in my opinion) about the nature of man and what we find important in our lives no matter how seemingly menial. A love story between Steve Carell and Keira Knightly plays out until the very end leaving a sense of fulfillment and yet never getting that fulfillment themselves.

5095644,3,B007L6VRHG,"This movies starts off as a funny and slightly wacky take on an end of the world situation. It has some serious parts too, and a surprisingly sweet love story, which took me by surprise. The acting was uniformly good, and the story, while choppy in places, was probably realistic for that certain segment of our population. Most of the people in the film go for hedonism, drug abuse, interpersonal abuse, violence, despair and suicide. The main characters choose something better. Even though the world will end in three weeks, no one ever has a thought about God, but this is a Hollywood movie. They don't like it when people cling to God and guns.

There is a May-December romance here, which is also typical of Hollywood, but with Matilda the comet coming, no one is going to get any older, so it didn't seem to matter. In summary, this is a well acted film for an evening's entertainment. It doesn't explore any profound questions about the meaning of life, but that was ok.",1359590400,2,978,4.620689655172414

5095647,3,B007L6VRHG,"Some filmmakers embrace genre conventions and give a twist or two to create something new and refreshing. That's exactly what ""Seeking a Friend for the End of the World"" is trying to do, with a story about a middle-aged man Dodge (Steve Carell) and Penny (Keira Knightley) a young British woman living in the same building, as a gigantic asteroid is heading towards the Earth. With only 21 days left to live, Dodge and Penny hit the road to seek Dodge's high school sweetheart.

No, the quirky little film is not ""Melancholia,"" and some call ""Seeking a Friend for the End of the World"" an ""apocalyptic romantic comedy."" There are not many ""apocalyptic romantic comedies"" out there, and not surprisingly, Lorene Scafaria's feature debut as director (she also wrote the screenplay) was not a big hit at the box office, despite the inclusion of stars Carell and Knightley. So is the film that bad?

No, I will not call it a bad film, and there are some touching moments and great soundtrack music (including Walker Brothers), but besides its lengthy and unappealing title, ""Seeking a Friend for the End of the World"" has several problems. For one thing, the director seems unable to decide where the film is going. Part road movie, the film is too episodic, introducing many characters (some by Nancy Carell and Martin Sheen in a cameo role), but none of these episodes is really interesting. The film's tone shifts restlessly from offbeat comedy to bittersweet romance, leaving almost no emotional impact. Genre-bending is one thing; indecisiveness is another.

Some viewers may think the unlikely pair of Steve Carell and Keira Knightley will not work. Actually, it does, though not perfectly, and I couldn't help thinking that with different players or director their relationship could have been more credible. To me Dodge and Penny look more like a brother and sister - or just friends. Judging from the film's title, I think maybe that is the point.",1359331200,,1952,4.909090909090909

5095695,4,B007L6VRHG,"I knew I would be seeing this movie when I first saw the trailer last year.  A romantic comedy-drama set in the twilight of humanity that stars everyman Steve Carell and equally appealing Keira Knightley was irresistible to me.  So I'm glad I got to see it, and I'm giving it four stars because it has some truly poignant and heartbreaking moments mixed in with some elements that didn't really work for me.

The premise is simple:  an asteroid is going to hit the Earth.  The last effort to prevent that from happening has failed.  The human race has three weeks before Armageddon.  Steve Carell plays an insurance company employee who watches with amazement and disbelief as things that he thought would last forever --like his unhappy marriage-- dissolve.  People react to the forthcoming end of days in a variety of ways, mostly seeming to indulge in all the vices they might have deprived themselves of if the world had been a going concern.

Carell's character is thrown together with Knightley's.  She's a kooky British expatriate some people have dismissed as just another ""manic pixie dream girl"" (but I don't agree with that characterization...after all, she's a young woman and some people really are any and a bit off-kilter).  They both go on a quest together before their lives end and somewhere along the line begin to fall in love.

The movie had some great elements to it:

1.  Some of the depictions of how people reacted to the situation of the world coming to an end were hilarious and I could readily see them happening.

2.  Carell and Knightley had some genuine chemistry together despite the fact that he is old enough to be her father.  The last scene where he comforts her as doom descends on high is heartfelt.

3.  There is a nice scene where Knightley talks on the phone to her parents in Britain where she shows how good an actress she is since she's projecting emotion and really makes you believe she's saying goodbye to her family (when in reality, the actress is just speaking into the phone and pretending).

4.  Steve Carell really is well-cast as an ""everyman"" who can't quite believe what is happening in front of him.

5.  The bit about the way that Carell's character's cleaning lady kept showing up to clean his apartment and said she'd see him ""next Tuesday"" (after impact) was pretty insightful.  Some people really would just live in denial about their forthcoming end until the end.

But there were some structural and conceptual problems with the story as well...

<spoilers>

1.  Since the world is going to end and the two lead characters along with the rest of the human race are going to die, it's kind of hard to get attached to them (I did a bit but it wasn't as complete as characters in other stories).  After all, even in the movie ""Titanic,"" only one character and the love affair itself were doomed...Kate Winslet's character lived.

2.  I couldn't help but think that the movie overplayed the idea of everyone descending into an orgy of sex, drugs, and violence.  I'm sure a lot of people would do that, but I have a feeling that a lot of people would be trying very hard to survive the disaster; others would be trying to get things right in their lives; and many others would simply spend time with their families until disaster struck.  Late in the movie, we see Carell and Knightley's characters spending time with other people on a nice beach...no orgies, drug taking, violence...just people trying to enjoy some of the good things before the end.  I wish they had shown more stuff like that happening in the movie along with the madness.

3.  Another thing that bothered me about this story was the whole idea that the human race would more or less give up on trying to ward off disaster after the space shuttle blew up as was announced in the opening scene of the movie.  I really would like to think that the various nations of this world would be doing anything and everything until the very last minute to try to keep the asteroid from slamming into the Earth.  For example, what about the thousands of nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles in the US, Russia, China, and other countries?  I would hope they'd used to destroy the asteroid.

4.  Another thing I didn't buy was the sudden announcement that the asteroid was arriving early.  I'm not an astronomer, but I would imagine that if an asteroid was heading toward the Earth on a collision course, it would be entirely predictable about when it would strike (with maybe some slight time changes but not suddenly arriving a week early like it did in the movie).

5.  A minor annoyance was that I don't think the aircraft that Martin Sheen's character (who played Carell's character's father) would have been able to reach the UK from the East Coast.

6.  I could buy the idea of Carell and Knightley's characters coming to care for each other a lot given the time that they spent together and the circumstances they were in, but some of the ""you were the love of my life"" declarations seemed a bit unlikely.

<end spoilers>

But despite these flaws, I'm glad I watched the movie.  People who find the issue of what would happen on Earth if a global catastrophe loomed interesting might find these two books very well worth reading:

<my alternate ending>

I can't help but wonder whether the movie would have been better if at the last minute, a last ditch effort to divert or destroy the asteroid had succeeded.  I think the movie would have had some fun with showing how people adjusted to the fact that they were not all going to die and came to terms with the things they had done and said when they did.  And it would have been nice to have seen Carell and Knightley's characters still together somehow.

So in my mind, that's what happened.",1359072000,,6068,4.855890944498539

5095749,5,B007L6VRHG,"As much as this tries, by taking schtick and working it into the tragic backdrop or by taking well-known comedic actors including some known mostly for television, this cannot be a comedy. It can't even be as funny as action-adventure films that work in cutesy lines that get a gaffaw. There are funny moments in the film, but it is overall a somber look at mortality and love. Steve Carell, who can pull out all the stops of his comedic repertoire with aplomb, can't make you laugh from the belly in this one, but he can break your heart. As such this expands his range of acting exponentially. He seems to devote every nerve, every muscle, and every motion into the feelings found in the film. He isn't the Forty Year Old Virgin Anymore, or the boss in The Office. Here, he is a leading man with a well-established and always talented Keira Knightley. Her playing against him in their respective roles accentuates the romance that ignites in this film, as the slowest fuse to the largest explosion on earth. Martin Sheen contributes.

This film has heart. It's all heart. Deliverance is lost, and then found.",1358640000,,1110,4.663265306122449
5095750,3,B007L6VRHG,Not particularly well done and boring at times.  Keira Knightley is wasted in her role and Steve Carell is well Steve Carell which means he plays a variation of the same character as in every movie he has been in. Connie Britton does a good job in a brief appearance but she wisely and quickly bolted from this melodramatic and meandering movie. [SPOILER ALERT]: The lackadaisical approach to the direction and script is perfectly captured in the scene where Steve Carell's character's father takes off from the U.S. in a single engine (small) plane for the U.K. with Keira Knightley's character (I can understand their desperation).,1358640000,2,633,4.971698113207547

The performances are very good, the script is smart, but it never quite comes together in the way I think the director/writer intended.  There's just something about the tone of the film that seems off.  It bounces around between many doomsday-themed films and can't quite decide if it's black comedy, rom-com, or wacky road trip.  You might say there's nothing wrong with trying to be all of these, but it only seems to dilute the impact of the central story.

Steve Carell does a wonderful job of serving his full range of acting skills - from the flatness of Dan in Real Life and Little Miss Sunshine to the liveliness and comedic shining of The Office and Date Night. Keira Knightley does a great job of balancing Carell as his equal, not support. I saw myself and everyone I know in the film, at times for better and other for worse but that's what a good movies of this sort should do - make you examine your life and not remove you from it like a generic action/comedy would.",1358208000,,660,4.373983739837398

These colors paint such a vivid picture of which the depth not only of the brushstrokes themselves, but that of their intent provide such a marvelous landscape. It isn't all pretty.

And despite the attempts of other philosophical reviewers, Seeking A Friend For The End of The World is not a ""deep indie film"". As an audience, we want to connect and empathize with the characters, relate to their story, empathize their pain and celebrate their successes. This is not that kind of movie.

As far as direction and cinematography goes, Seeking A Friend does not at all feel like a world becoming depraved by its inevitable, looming destruction. Steve Carell's character, Dodge, does not successfully portray a victimized last-second loner, and Kiera Knightley's character, Penny, does not at all successfully portray a carefree, unsuspecting match for Dodge. The audience can see the director's intention from beginning to end with no surprises.

It had everything going for it for a great movie. I always like seeing how people deal with their own demise and this was on a world scale. The plot just wasn't there. It kept jumping from cameo to cameo and the characters made horrible decisions. By the end of this movie I was rooting for the asteroid.

It was very slow moving, dull, depressing, and after about 50 minutes, I couldn't take it anymore and we turned it off.  I honestly don't know how some reviewers found things to laugh at in the movie.  If you're looking for a comedy like ""Date Night"" or a movie that makes you truly laugh, you'll be severely disappointed.  If you're looking for a dry film that critics love and that gets nominated for awards, perhaps you'll like it.",1357084800,2,625,4.4

It's not a comedy, because nothing funny ever happened.  It was just a boring waste of a couple of hours of your time and the talents of some very good actors.  Mostly, I blame the story.  It was a meandering trail to nowhere, full of implausible twists, unnecessary holes, and side plots that lead to dead ends.  Unlike many other Steve Carrell vehicles, it was not particularly charming or quirky, and it lacked the depth and realism that lends other similar movies a likable quality.  The only possible explanation I can come up with is that the filmmaker is trying to use her medium to make a point about the human condition: that our time on earth has been a useless, pointless, poorly-contrived waste of time.

He like anyone reacts with despair and is unable to move forward. Slowly he's character changes due to people and events around him. The change is apparent in how he deals with his father.

What do you do when life has no meaning and the world is about end? The film catalogued the human strategies of coping with this. One guy tried to sleep with all women in town, another was trying to be by himself, etc. It was interesting and entertaining though melancholic. It had actors we do not normally see and therefore refreshing. This new film hasn't the charm of the old film. On top of it, Steve Carell and Keira Knightley do not work well together. Keira overplays terribly and Steve is a miscast. I do not recommend it. Watch ""Last Night"" instead.",1356998400,4,731,4.545454545454546

5096164,2,B007L6VRHG,"""Seeking a Friend"" is the movie we all should want to see, given what's happening in the world around us.  It's not hard to imagine that we're facing one horror or another - in fact, too often, we are not *imagining* it - and you have a sense that this movie will be about finding love in the face of death.  One of the great themes and problems of our existence.  The Dramatic Question of so much of what haunts us mortals.  ""Seeking a Friend"" wants to answer that Question.

And it does.  But the problem is, by the end of the movie, who really cares?  You want to care.  Who doesn't like Carell and Knightly?  But they are uninteresting in this movie, and they just can't sustain the weight of The End of All Life on the Planet.

Where to start...
  1) The script is silly.  Childish, really.  Not ""innocent"", which would be a great counterpoint to imminent death, but immature.  Characters come and go without any purpose.  Penny's (Keira Knightly) boyfriend?  A whiny splinter without any substance.  Corporal Speck the Survivor?  ""Penny deserves a chance to be the mother of a new race..."" or something like that.  Really?  You want us to believe that this elf-girl is a ""survivor"" because she's...what?  She has an LP collection?  And Speck has a collection of high efficiency, 2-person cars?  A retired Marine corporal...right...with enough titanium blocks to build a shelter for a bunch of his bro's..sure.  The effeminate maitre d' says nothing important.  The wait staff comes out of the Land of the Lotus Eaters at a roadside Chili's.  Frank (Martin Sheehan), the estranged father who walked out on Carell years in the past, is going to fly Penny to England in a Piper Cub?  (I'm not too good with single-engine planes).  The speeches are vacuous, the characters trite, the settings unrealistic (does *everybody* have a single-family house in perfect condition, typically with a high end gas stove for professional chefs?), the backdrop of changes in 'the real world' laughable.  (It's good to know that there will be water and electricity until the day before we all perish).  OK...I can suspend my disbelief as well as the next person.  But don't establish a context of ""the end of the world by fiery death"" - which prepares me for one way of looking at the rest of the movie - and then leave folks in their humdrum existence.  Oh, right, the dental hygienist injecting somebody with heroin at the sister's party is supposed to be the metaphor.  Nope.
  2) Steve Carell has a problem.  He is becoming typecast as an ineffectual, guilt-ridden, observer of his own life.  He doesn't just have a past.  He is a prisoner of his past.  He won't confront it, just like he won't confront ""Olivia, the love of my life"", in this movie.  (He does write her a letter, he says, after wasting precious days seeking her out; he avoids meaningful life once again.) Yes, we are all products of our experiences.  But poor Steve (the character Dodge) is blind to himself.  Yes...the name ""dodge"" works (he dodges life, he dodges Olivia, his life is a subterfuge, whatever), but it is not just his name - after all, he might change and really grow up.  Carell's constant character is the pit he always tries to climb out of.  Carell does this in a lot of his work.  He doesn't *mutter* to himself, which at least would show some anger and a profound battle to win the treasure of his own life.  He damn well *murmurs.""  He is always carrying on a conversation with a not very likable twin, a critical dark self beating the stuffing out of him.  Now, I think Carell is a talented guy.  I actually think he would be a great villain in a spy flick: he can easily establish that 'Otherness' that spells violence and danger.  But I have had enough of the tender, sensitive, fake, fatuous Carell.
  3) It is very nice indeed that the movie gives work to some neat character actors: Rob Corddry, Patton Oswalt, and Connie Briton, for example.  That's worth a star.
  4) And I like that the movie has a dog in it, even if the dog is rather irrelevant and just an afterthought.  But the dog gets to eat a microwave pot pie, I think it was.  That was OK.  Another star.  I have a dog.

I was surprised to find that this movie was both heartwarming and heartbreaking. It's one of those you should watch when you have the time, and only with other people you are comfortable crying in front of.

(*Possible spoiler alert*) I spent the second half of the movie with varying amounts of tears streaming down my face as I watched the characters build a friendship and try to seek out the people they care about, while both they and I knew that the apocalypse was approaching. I would not call it a comedy, though there are funny moments (mostly dark humor, as you might imagine).

We missed the part of the description that said drama and romance. When we saw that it was Steve Carrell, we figured it would be quirky, and it was. We thought it would be more comedic than it was. While parts of the movie were a bit slow and predictable, the saving grace was the end of the movie -- it was one of the sweetest endings I've seen in a long time. I would watch the end of the movie again, just to hear some of the last lines. So, did our world end today? Not so far, but it's only 10:53pm.

For a movie about the realities of ""apocolypse"" times, it was surprisingly upbeat and not nearly as depressing as it could have easily been.  Loved it, glad I rented it first, but will be buying it now.

Update: After having read some of the negative reviews I have realized what people's problem is when it comes to this movie. They wanted Michael Scott. This isn't a hilarious movie. It's about facing your imminent death and what you would do with your last moments in the event the world was going to end. Had they all survived in the end, or had he run off with his *lost love* there would be complaints that it was too clich and contrived. It was a good movie, if you don't type-cast and take it for what it REALLY is; a story about what people do when faced with death.",1355788800,,1035,4.302564102564102

5096430,5,B007L6VRHG,"In the car with his wife, he listens as the reporter announces the end of the world in 21 days. His wife immediately bolts, jumps out of the car and is gone, gone, gone. The poor fellow must spend the last of his days in a dark gloomy cocoon of his own. Nothing shakes him out of it. People are splurging the rest of their lives away and indulging in every possible vice, others are venting their impending doom by going out on a full blown riot seemingly against nature itself. All this is going on around him and nothing seems to be able to shake him from that dark cocoon but matters of love and happiness. Job promotions are offered to the first takers, a cleaning lady keeps coming back oblivious to the looming apocalypse--

Everyone is doing what they enjoyed most. But not him, he is alone. This, I think is the main theme of the movie and the title nails it right on...Seeking A Friend For The End Of The World, a romantic journey in self discovery. He, (Carell) in his final days is on a Journey of Self-Discovery during which he teams with a companion de misre, (Keira Knightley). companion de misre

What I found reflective here is their serendipitous realization that not I only have they spent their entire lives not doing what they wanted most out of life and, but that the one person who would have brought true happiness to their lives lived just a floor away, just a stairwell away. And even though their las days together leading to that realization is in the shadow of impendent death, it did not matter, even death itself did not matter because they were together . . .till the end. And in the few moments they were together, they were the happiest they'd ever been and nothing mattered, even death...They were happy in death. WOW! Makes you want to find that one person who makes nothing else matter. We should all have such a companion de misre to go through life with.

 I found this movie to be very romantic in a deep dark way, a bittersweet tear jerker,  that left me with a fuzzy heartwarming feeling. This here is a perfect mix of melancholy, humor and intimacy.
This is the type of movie you want to bring a girl to on a first date because it is wistfully funny, and reflective. It makes you wonder about yourself and what you want in romantic relation, what you value in life and a good conversation starter when you walk her along the beach under the stars, or in the park after the movie. Makes you think once you've left your date if she is the one for you like Keira was for Steve Carell.

5096491,5,B007L6VRHG,"Charming indie movie that proves story and great actors can make a wonderful film- even without enough budget for special effects. Heck- even without ""proper"" locations (the California settings local to the filmmaker and clearly and free of expensive location fees and management costs in no way passed for the northeastern U.S.). But none of those zero-budget conditions detracted in the least. Kind of whittled away all the bombast, and made the actual story stand out more, in fact. A plus!

Keira Knightley steps out of her usual China Doll Glam roles to give a heart touching portrayal of a real girl (i.e., unmarried young woman) caught up in an approaching doom. Other cast members are equally apt in the same scenario. For example, Steve Carell plays it straight to great effect, and Martin Sheen is the perfect dad. Other A-list character actors flesh-out the supporting roles. I don't know what encouraged them all to take part in this project, perhaps it was simply that they saw a chance to be real and creative and touching? (Notice I did not say ""artful,"" as that would be too pretentious- but it's true anyway!)

This is not at all a typical big-budget disaster movie- and while some of those can be good, solid ""human"" films, of course- such as 1998's ""Deep Impact,"" some of them can be so lost in all the CGI that they come off as overwrought cartoons with little meaning. ""Seeking a Friend..."" has great meaning. I liked it in the theaters, and was pleasantly surprised to find that I have watched the Blu-Ray several times, enjoying it each time. it is engaging, sweet, and poignant. it does show how an artistic vision and a handful of great actors are really all that is needed to wrap an audience up in a most worthwhile story.",1355011200,,1749,4.712418300653595

If we don't turn things around quickly on this planet...it is going to get very ugly over the next several decades. (See recent Price-Waterhouse-Cooper Study.)  Global warning, too many mouths to feed, species extinction, corporate dominance.... there is not much reason to think any of these horror shows are going away. Even well-informed Americans tend to be in impressive denial about the future predicted by current empirical evidence.

For people carrying a deep sadness about the state of the planet, this film has special significance.  Ultimately, in retrospect, a meteor may turn out to have been preferable. I think Seeking a Friend was intended as a coping manual, for those of us not cocooned in denial.  The writing and acting are superb, very understated, ie. not with a bang...but a whimper.

This movie actually does a decent job, showing that some folks might engage in mindless rioting, others engaging in serial orgies, some might stay at their jobs and pretend nothing is happening and others to see that special someone from their lives.  In any event, it was a good depiction of how people might face the end of the world.  Of course, the main characters fall in love.  The ending has to be a disappointment-either some unlikely miracle will save the main characters or they will die a horrible death with the rest of the world.  As a result, I felt pretty empty at the end of this one.  It is not a feel good movie.
OK, now for a bit of nerding out.  Matilde is indeed an asteroid.  That it would collide with earth is 0% probable-it's orbit does not cross that of earth(but at least an asteroid collision is more likely than a random gas giant hitting the earth as in the hideously boring movie, Melancholia-after all a small asteroid did hit the earth about 60 million years ago).  Also,the movie begins with an annoucement that the space shuttle mission to the asteroid belt has failed.  First of all, the space shuttle could never get out of low earth orbit.  It just wasn't built for more than that.  Also, for those who have been asleep the last four years, Obama has killed the shuttle program and the entire US manned space program so that our astronauts can only get to space by hitchhiking on Russian spacecraft.",1354233600,,1493,4.526119402985074

An asteroid is approaching earth, and cannot be stopped.  Everyone does what everybody is supposed to do at the end of time.  With only weeks left a man's wife abandons him.  After taking some time to speculate the man Dodge (Steve Carell) finds that an old school sweetheart has written to him; so he decides to go on a road trip to reunite.  He takes along an abandoned dog and an apparent ditzy and confused female neighbor (Keira Knightley.) She takes along a handful of vinyl albums.

We know the formula is weak seen it before.  In the film does start out rather slow, plodding and lame.  But it is not the end of the film, which we all know how it ends as all films of this type.  It is the journey itself, including the things they say and the people they meet that add stars to this review.  I was really impressed to find out who played Dodge's father Frank.  The end of the film was tastefully done.",1353801600,,945,4.2824858757062145

This was more of a dramatic role for Carrell and Keira Knightly has to be one of the best criers out there.  The movie is about a huge asteroid heading for earth and they have a month or less before it hits.  The story is about two people who live in the same building and they eventually meet each other, and their lives begin to intertwine.  Neither of them wants to be alone at the end of the world and they try to help each other get home before the end. They both end up loving each other and spending their last moments on earth together.  Except for the foul language used mainly at the beginning of the movie, the rest of the movie had clean language and there was no sexual content, that I remember.

The humor is only present to add poignancy to the dramatic, much like the gate keeper in Macbeth. But, too often, the humor is botched or spoofed with too much emphasis. For the most part, the movie is designed to make people think, 'how would they go down in the BIG END?' Obviously, not a lot of people ponder this, so the movie makes them think the difficult thoughts. As you might expect, such a movie gets mired in its own Plato/Ion conversations or moments, and thus drags. If you are after entertainment, keep looking; Steve Carell is only here as some tasty fish bait for the gullible and to help make us think that the movie's humor is humorous. Keira Knightely is here 'cause she had some gambling debts to pay off and needed a side paycheck. If you are here for something that does not entertain you, but rather puts a little juice into your cerebral-battery, have at it, enjoy.",1353715200,3,976,4.4581005586592175
5096701,3,B007L6VRHG,"Well, after watching Melancholia, which was really a waste of life, I can notch the stars up two points to Seeking a Friend.  There never seems to be enough wondering by humanity when it will actually happen, if it will happen in our lifetime, and how we'll get through it.  Humanity will either go crazy or it will do a hell of a lot of reflection and repentance before life ends.

Whatever the outcome, Seeking a Friend was a different take on two people's lives who cross during the end and fall in love.  The usual scenes of despondency, why bother caring about anything, and riots are in the film. Each character reflects about choices, family members, and lost loves as they prepare for the inevitable.

The movie really didn't move me until the end when they are in bed waiting to die. Their position reminds me of the two skeletons discovered by archeologists in Italy facing each other as they perish - the lovers of Valdaro. Better to die in the arms of someone who loves you than to die alone. All in all it's mildly entertaining, depressing, and makes you ponder what you'd do in similar circumstances.",1353715200,,1114,4.577889447236181

5096704,4,B007L6VRHG,"I thought a bit about whether to give this movie a 3 or 4 star review. Despite it's shortcomings I went with 4 because the ending closed strong, some great music, and the fact that it kept everybody talking afterwards.

The biggest problem with the movie was balance. The movie was laugh out loud funny at points. It had lots of madcap moments about the absurd ways people behave when the world was ending. But it also wanted to be an indie drama about people coping with the end of the world, with lots of good music playing. I enjoyed the comedy, and I enjoyed the dramatic ending, but I did feel it wasn't fully developed.

One scene that I actually quite liked was of the restaurant that just kept running. It was funny, and I did get a slight sense that this was their family, and they were going to go down while being together and making others happy. But I do wish the screwball aspect had been dialed down one notch and the friendship aspect had been dialed up one notch. This may have been made especially apparent due to the presence of Gillian Jacobs. I usually see her on Community, the single greatest example of mixing screwball nonsense with emotional depth and warmth.

Lastly: (SLIGHT SPOILER) I appreciated the fact that the world, in fact, did end. Which is what pushed it up to a 4 star review for me. Even though the drama wasn't as fully fleshed out as I would have liked, the ending didn't sell out the emotions that the whole movie was going for. It left everyone talking after the credits, and even the next day. ""What would you do?"" That would have never happened if the asteroid had missed.",1353715200,,1618,4.441077441077441

Steve Carrell comes across as extremely creepy, as he does in most movies when he's not being overtly funny.

Plot holes galore.  Truthfully I looked my wife in the eyes after this one and said, ""it's bad when i'm regretting that i didn't let you rent magic mike instead.""",1353369600,,485,4.670588235294118

The lead characters were honest in their protrayal and in the people they played. I'm not going to ruin the movie with a description of the action, especially since it what takes place in the minds and hearts that really makes this movie what it is.

It was typical of humans, and relentless in it's honesty of what we could expect if such a situation were ever to occur in reality. The range of human emotions and reactions portrayed in this story covers the widest range of the probability of how things would be in this situation. The main characters make sense of what is really important, and how we might react to those truths.

I gave 4 star instead of 5 simply because of the language and some of the actions portrayed in the story, although I believe all of them were honest. However, I don't care to be entertained by them, hence the one-star-lower rating. Watch the movie with your heart, and not just your eyes, and you will enjoy it immeasurably.",1353196800,,1099,4.545454545454546

There is an odd building of the relationship, not sure the chemistry between the characters is convincing , but who knows how chemistry is sparked when impending doom is in the background. I recommend this movie for a few laughs on human behavior and a good movie to discuss and reflect on your behavior in an impeding doom situation.

And the acting is what raises this above either silly comedy or the maudlin apocalytic film.  The comedy is in the small touches -- handing out job titles at Carell's dead end office, or the fact that he and others actually show up for work AND a humdrum staff meeting.  The sadness of discovering who you really are and finally getting the courage to become that person while facing impending doom is a beautiful dramatic point.",1352851200,2,558,4.653061224489796

This movie has two personalities, it starts out as a dark comedy and finishes up as a pure drama.  As a fan of end of the world type fiction and comedy, I thoroughly enjoyed it.

People who shared a building for quite some time but never knew each other meet only as their prospects for the future are entirely washed up. Their story plays out in a scene after scene display of how people all over handle the impending demise of the planet. The interactions are insightful none the less as they show some of the truest nature of humanity when hope has dwindled. All in all this movie develops quality characters you can't help but be entertained by and inspired a little as well. I loved this movie, it exceeded my expectations. Both Steve and Kira performed excellently, though I didn't doubt they would.

For an ""end of the world"" theme the development of how two people live out their lives is full hearted and optimistic.  The momentum for how the story develops is based on a journey to get to an important location and along the way the two characters live through some wild times.

If you like Steve Carell's brand of humor and performance - genuinely funny, self-deprecating and poignant - you'll appreciate Seeking A Friend. No, it's not a laugh a minute like Date Night or some of his other movies but I like it even more for its sweet and sad moments. So tender and a completely different brand of apocalypse movie. It's not perfect. Some parts are a little slow but completely worth it. Watch it if you need a good laugh, or a good cry. Highly recommend!!",1352073600,,610,4.359649122807017

What's it about?
As an asteroid nears Earth, a man finds himself alone after his wife leaves in a panic. He decides to take a road trip to reunite with his high school sweetheart. Accompanying him is a neighbor who inadvertently puts a wrench in his plan.

What did I think?
I am not a Steve Carell fan, but I liked him in this.  Keira Knightley was sweet, adorable, and funny in this film...reminiscent of the first ""Pirates of the Carribbean"".  If the world was really coming to an end, I think it would be more like that.

And it was, in small vignettes and occasional lines. But there were  boring and sappy ones in equal measure. We had to keep getting up to turn down the music - especially during closing histrionics - but I guess that's a matter of taste. I wish we'd seen more of the dog, who had the best role.  As I said to my friend (sought out for an end of the day movie),  ""Hey, I'm really sorry about that one...""",1351814400,,536,4.287128712871287

First, the casting was horrible and set the movie up to fail.  Carrell is 50, Knightly is 27...watching them together was completely unbelievable. No chemistry at all. On top of that, the acting was too much to swallow and we never believed the characters.  The whole time it just felt off.
I read the bad reviews and thought that maybe we'd see something in it that others didn't, but no...this movie earned the bad reviews.
If you insist on watching it anyway like we did, get it from the library but I wouldn't waste money on it.  You'll already likely feel you wasted your time on it when it's over.",1351728000,2,685,4.456

During his attempt to have some sort of normalcy, such as having his apartment cleaned every week and going to work, while the clock ticks down, he meets Keira Knightley.  She is a neighbor in his apartment building.  He finds her crying on the fire escape, outside his window, one night after breaking up with her boyfriend.  Her one desire before her life ends is to get back to England to see her family one last time.  The two of them make a pact to see that each of them gets their last wish before the world ends.

This is the kind of film that sticks with you for a while and makes you want to enjoy life. I'm not much for romantic films (or ""chick flicks""), and the ones I can enjoy usually kill it for me in the last 10 to 15 minutes.

And yet, it seems SEEKING A FRIEND FOR THE END OF THE WORLD is one of those movies people either get or don't.  Why else would people take the time to write a one star review about a profoundly great film?  But........., what do I know?  A lot of people think THE BIG BANG is hilarious.  A lot of people like canned laugh tracks in their sitcoms.  And a lot of wanna be critics think BATMAN movies are high art.  So, if you're looking for the Steve Carrell from Anchorman or The Office, or you need your comedy spoon fed, then its possible this movie might not be as profound as the formulaic scripts you're accustomed to.

5097110,1,B007L6VRHG,Just rented this movie and watched with my husband.  Not what we were expecting. The beginning of the movie is useless.  The drug use and references really didn't add anything to the movie and at times were plain stupid.  The directing and writing wasn't terrible but the story could have started in the middle. I wouldn't pay to watch this movie any time soon.,1351641600,,361,4.609375
5097111,4,B007L6VRHG,"Well, at least it's a mostly decent one.

Seeking starts off really well, and the first half hour or so is truly funny, due almost entirely to Steve Carell. Yes, he plays the exact same likable schlub he plays in pretty much every movie or tv show he's in, but he's the master of it, so who can blame him. He sells it perfectly here, and his coworkers play off it well.

The highlight of the film, and the last truly funny part, is the party, which has some classic lines courtesy of writer/director Scafaria. The bucket list and Radiohead lines are especially classic, and the dvd extras show Oswald riffing on some good bits, worth watching to be sure. (As are the brief making of and other outtakes; you can see that the fun feel of the film mirrored the making of it.)

But then it all goes downhill pretty fast, mainly because Knightly is in way over her head comedically. So it turns into a pretty straight up chick flick, which is fine if you dig that, but I like more laughs mixed into that salad. There's a few, but precious few compared to the start here.

But, there's a lot of heart, and even the truly silly ending shows that Scafaria is at heart a real romantic, and this is her baby, so well done to her for getting it made and having it be as good as it is at times. It's really a three star film as a whole, but she gets the fourth star for sheer good heartedness, which you can feel in the careful and thoughtful way the film feels as it winds into its sappy finale.

All in all, a decent date movie, and for the truly great laughs in the opening and the rather sardonic take on modren American office and suburban life, worth watching for those who like their romance mixed with some occasionally edgy laughs.",1351641600,5,1728,4.288343558282208
5097112,5,B007L6VRHG,"I was not originally planning on writing a review for this movie, but I really thought it was a good movie, well worth watching, so I wanted to do my part to get the star count up. The movie is kind of a mix between a black comedy and a tragic romance. The movie lacks a single tone. Some might say that this movie lacks unity, or that it does not know what it wants to be, but it struck just the right chord for me. I think the combination is perfect.

It seems like I rarely really laugh at comedies anymore, but this movie had some truly hilarious moments. It opens with a radio announcement that the last mission to save humanity from an asteroid hurtling toward the earth has failed, but that the radio station is going to continue bringing their listeners a countdown to the apocalypse, along with all their favorite classic rock hits. That opening sets the tone for the first part of the movie and all the absurd behavior of the human race in the face of their imminent demise. Highlights from the comedy side of the film include the relationship between Dodge (Steve Carrell) and his housekeeper, and the scene in the Friendly's (whoever the actor was who played the host did a brilliant job). I rarely see comedy that I think is this good, but this movie is more than just a comedy.

Now I must give my SPOILER ALERT. The rest of the movie is about the relationship that forms between Dodge (Steve Carrell) and Penny (Keira Knightly) as they attempt to track down Dodge's high school sweetheart and get Penny back to England to see her family. In some ways we have seen this part of the movie before. The two strangers who set out on a mission together, both looking for something, but who wind up finding each other instead. While this is somewhat of a formula, it is a formula I happen to like, and I think this movie did a good job with it. There is also a story about Dodge's father who apparently abandoned him when he was young and their reconciliation which adds an emotional layer to the film. Dodge and Penny wind up spending their last days together, and I am glad the movie did not back away at the last minute from the end of the world. The last scene, I thought, was particularly well done. The romance may not be entirely believable, but I am inclined to suspend my disbelief for this movie, since I think the rest of the movie works so well.

I think the movie might also be viewed as a meditation on what is really important in life. There are so many people hanging on to things (jobs, relationships, old wounds, etc.) that they are not really happy with. This movie, by forcing people to decide how they want to spend their last three weeks, also forces them to decide what is important to them. There is a scene on the beach, where a group of strangers have gathered and are just having a good time, that I think makes a point also made in Ecclesiastes ""All is vanity. So eat, drink, and be merry"" (I am paraphrasing). We all return to dust, so there is nothing to do but enjoy life. That seems to me, anyways, to be one of the messages of the movie.

I have to say, the only thing that really mystified me about the movie (I remind everyone my SPOILER ALERT is in effect) was the decision to have the asteroid hit a week earlier than expected. It seems ridiculous to think that the scientists would have been off by a week. I could understand if it served some purpose in the plot but, as far as I can tell, it does not. So why ask the viewer to believe something so implausible if there is no purpose? If anyone can shed some light on this particular aspect of the movie I would love to hear it. It is not really a big deal. It certainly did not ruin the movie for me. I just do not understand it.

In summary, I will say that I think this is one of the better movies I have seen in awhile. It has quite a few laughs, but has a serious side as well. It is a sad story, but avoids getting overly heavy. If this movie had just been a comedy I do not think I would have liked it as much, and if it had just been a sad love story I also do not think I would have liked it nearly as much, but the combination worked just right for me. Perhaps it will work just right for you as well...",1351555200,9,4210,4.205445544554456

5097170,4,B007L6VRHG,"Steve Carell revives his dead pan character and teams up with Keira Knightley who creates a character with emotional baggage. They are Dodge and Penny who live in the same apartment complex but who have never met...until they both experience break ups. A meteor named Matilda is headed toward earth, one that even Bruce Willis can not destroy. It will be the end of the world. As the countdown continues, people react differently. There are suicides and hedonism...kids drinking, people doing drugs, and riots. There are those that still live simply.

Much of the film is consumed by Dodge and Penny traveling to Delaware so he can visit his high school sweetheart one last time. The film is basically a romantic comedy with some hit and miss moments. More enkoyable than many of the other end of the world films that have come out over the last few years.

5097173,4,B007L6VRHG,"I'm sure you've seen this movie before.  A poor schlub meets a quirky and beautiful girl who upsets his boring life and pushes him to discover more about himself.  There are a few things that set this film apart from your standard Manic Pixie Dream Girl fantasy, however.  The first is the setting; the last month before the end of the world provides a great context for people outside the main characters.  The second is Steve Carrell's dedication to his depression.  This isn't the story of a man who learns to love life, it's more the story of a man who manages to find a reason to stay alive just a bit longer.  And finally, Keira Knightly isn't just some magical creature--she has her own flaws and desires (more in the mode of Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind than Garden State).

I think this movie could be most directly compared to Wristcutters: A Love Story.  The same basic quest is there, the same troubled relationships, the same road trip through an increasingly odd landscape.  But while Wristcutters has the benefit of its magical realism and unique take, Seeking a Friend is stuck somewhere between its clever premise and need to play to a wide audience. It gets weird, but never quite so weird as it could.  There's always some element of humor to break up the tension when some of the real issues of life at the end of the world arises.  The side characters are met and discarded in quick order; there are some interesting reactions, but the plot never strays long from its 'depressed man meets girl who hasn't lived enough yet' core (which often has as much chemistry as you would expect if these two met in real life).

That said, this isn't just your standard Hollywood popcorn fare.  There is some actual emotion that comes out of this movie, and some greatness that comes when it isn't afraid to be downright sad.  It's biggest problem is that it can manage laughs, and it can manage tears, but rarely is it ever able to combine the two rather than just alternating between them.",1351382400,,2008,4.588235294117647

The writer director took two of my favorite actors and turned them into total dunces. No one says the things this woman writes. Keira Knightly was directed to be yet ANOTHER version of Natalie Portman's Garden State character, you know, quirky/lovable-even-though-she-doesn't feel lovable...uggg, giant fart noise...that character was annoying and so was this one. Steve Carell's talent was squandered and the failed attempt to set the film on the east coast might have been the most distracting element of all...she had them bury a man's body in the bakersfield hills for god's sake...I only pray that these 2 talented actors were well compensated and that this writer/director never gets a shot at making another screen play again.

5097176,4,B007L6VRHG,"Near the end of the movie, it's announced the asteroid will arrive a week ahead of schedule. How could the world's astrophysicists be so grossly incorrect in their estimation of when the planet gets hit?  If they were wrong, the planet would simply be missed.  Right? The earth moves around the sun at about 18 miles per second, the diameter of the planet is about 8,000 miles.  The asteroid itself is stated as being about 70 miles wide.  Just a little bit of math here, and that provides about an 8 minute window of opportunity for the earth passing through the trajectory of an asteroid to be hit. But the astrophysicist estimations are off by about 10,072 minutes.  What is up with that? We've landed multiple space craft on different planets, right? Why couldn't our collective scientific intelligence get correctly something as insignificant as when the planet is going to end.

So was a whole sub-plot happening that isn't revealed in the film.  Did all of the world's astrophysicists, politicians, mass media and others conspire to lead the planet into believing they had an extra week to live? Why would they do this and for what gain?  And if they were conspiring to make the rest of humanity think there is an extra week before impact, wouldn't even amateur astronomers pick up on this, alerting the world of the conspiracy?  If they were, surely see some characters may show signs of hope for a mistake.  But that doesn't happen.  Everyone assumes it to be true.

The end of the world has become a common theme in recent years sometimes post apocalytic such as [ASIN:B002ZG997C The Book of Eli]] with Denzel Washington, or pre apocalyptic such as Von Trier's Melancholia, Emmerich's blockbuster 2012, an action movie on a grand scale, or my personal favorite&nbsp;&nbsp;with Denzel Washington, or pre apocalyptic such as Von Trier's Melancholia, Emmerich's blockbuster 2012, an action movie on a grand scale, or my personal favorite&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Another-Earth-Two-Disc-Blu-ray-DVD-Combo-Digital-Copy/dp/B005LZW8FO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Another Earth (Two-Disc Blu-ray/DVD Combo + Digital Copy)</a>[Blu-ray + DVD + Digital Copy]in which another earth appears in the night sky but may not be apocalyptic at all.

A news announcement of terrifying proportions sets in course a sequence of events in the life of Peterson Dodge played by Steve Carell. His wife leaves him immediately. Peoples behavior changes. He meets Keira Knightley's character, somewhat of a free spirit.

Both initially have plans which do not include each other. He wants to reconnect with a high school sweetheart, and she wants to go back to her family, except the airlines are shut down.

Yet, as time goes by and they help each other to get what they really want, they realise they both want the same thing, and that thing is closer than they realised.

To tell you more would be unfair. SFEW has good and weak points. It's engaging enough and I think could have been better. I wish there was more oomph in the movie. Carell plays his character Peterson Dodge as subdued and perhaps a little depressed at the beginning which is understandable yet there is no huge contrast in his behavior later in the movie when things are going better and they are having their adventures.

Two emotionally poignant scenes later in the movie made the entire experience worthwhile for me. After he carries carries her sleeping, and a later surprise. I thought wow.

If I knew I was going to die tomorrow, how would I want to spend my last day?  This is a *serious* take on that question.  It's well-written and nicely acted.  Whether or not there's a ""Hollywood ending"" at the end of the movie is somewhat debatable.  I wouldn't say the writer completely chickens out at the end, but in some ways, some might argue the ending was predictable.  It was still a great ending, though. :)

After a last ditch attempt to save the world fails people of Earth are told that they only have a few weeks left before the end of the world will take place. Everyone begins to look at what's important to them and how and what they want to do with thier final days. Dodge (Carell) wants to return to his first love and see her again for the first time in a long time. Penny (Knightley) wants to find a way to return to her family back in England. Together they try to help each other find what they need, and along the way find more then they were expecting. Going in I wasn't expecting this to be a laugh-out-loud type comedy but I was expecting some funny parts. I did think the movie was good, but not a comedy at all really. This is one of those movies that make you think how you would react in a situation like this but also one that is hard to imagine yourself in. The acting in this is great and the movie keeps you interested but it is also VERY depressing throughout most of it and you will be close to the point of being emotionally drained by the time the movie is over. At least that's how I felt. There has been quite a few end of the world movies that have come out in the last few years and I would compare this one more to ""Melencholia"" then to any of the others. This one is not as ""smart"" as ""Melencholia"" but it had the same world is ending and we can't do anything about it feel. If you liked that one you will probebly like this one more, I know I did. Overall, not what I expected but an OK one time watch, too emotional and depressing to watch over and over I think. I give it a B-.",1351036800,12,1691,4.035714285714286

When Dodge needs a ride by car to find his long lost love, the promise of a friend with a plane is enough to convince Penny to throw her hat in with Dodge to reach a mutually beneficial arrangement.
Prepare for some medium pitch amusement with a witty and romantic undertone... this movie really has no surprises so don't expect any. If you can stomach the usual indictment that mankind, faced with its potential destruction will be reduced to rampant drug induced, sex crazed orgies or the need to run riot in the streets... as the back drop to a sappy ""you complete me"" romance movie... then this flicks for you. If you expect more than Steve Carell sporting his stupid grin while simultaneously tripping through the usual juxtaposition life scenarios he is usually cast in... you will be awfully disappointed.
Rated R for some instances of bad language, sexual situations (no nudity), drug use, alcohol abuse and alcohol use by minors, as well as one or two graphic violent death scenes (minor blood)... this movie could easily have been edited to a PG13 and lost none of its 'punch'.",1350950400,4,1448,4.7272727272727275

Some moments are poignant drama, others will make you laugh, and some may even draw a tear. Its plot is simple enough, but leaves one to ponder what is most important in life. I loved the mini-adventure, that drew laughs from truly humorous moments and circumstances rather than going for cheap jokes or slapstick. I'm so glad that I watched it.

Even though Steve Carrell made his fame with his comedic talents, he gave a powerful performance in this beautiful movie. In a race to tie up loose ends before the end of the world, Dodge and Penny find the kind of love thats eternal in what may be the last great (and annonomous) love story on earth. The unspoken tenderness between Dodge and Penny is so powerful that it drew me into their world. I felt a tremendous sadness for them and at the same time the elation and peace that they found each other in such a desperate hour. The peace that Dodge and Penny had at the end was beautiful. The beach scene will go down as one of my favorite movie scenes ever. It was the closest Hollywood has ever got to our true place in the world.

5097300,1,B007L6VRHG,"So I thought this might be funny or romantic or have something to say, but it so didn't. The movie starts with a bang. Steve Carrell sitting in his car getting the first reports that efforts to head off an asteroid from destroying the earth have failed. His wife just runs off. Now Steve Carrell goes into his ""I don't know how to act mode"" and stares slowly at everything and talks slowly at everything. So he goes home and while everyone freaks out, he notices that his neighbor has a fight with her boyfriend. They kind of go on a road trip thanks to riots taking over residential neighborhoods and there is a few strange scenes where, I think, we are supposed to think it funny that people kill themselves rather than waiting to die.

Of course Carrell falls for Knightly, but the weird thing is that they had no chemistry. Knightly plays her role like a total silly simpleton who kind of deserves to die and Carrell comes off as feeling anything for her exactly because of that, an escape in the last days of his life. Not at all any true love. Honestly, she is so young you could see it might be like a child replacement because mentally and physically she is much younger than him. But all during this courtship this entire time... nothing happens. They go to visit his one great love and his dad but it is plodding and there is just no point at all. I kept thinking why can't they do this to keep from dying or why can't they do this to keep from dying. Why isn't anyone trying to do anything?  Oh yeh I am supposed to be paying attention to the romance.

I don't think it is a secret to say that they didn't chicken out with a happy ending... and while I was glad of that -- I also thought, what a serious bummer. It didn't work on any level for me. Acting, story, romance, meaning... etc.",1349654400,5,1798,4.2823529411764705
5097301,4,B007L6VRHG,"What would you do with less than three weeks to live? Give up? Commit suicide? Take whatever you want from whoever you wanted and wave goodbye in the final moment? Think about it.

  The first thing we hear during the film is that an asteroid is headed toward Earth and the last effort made to stop it has failed. We hear this over a car radio with a man and woman in front listening. The man, Dodge (played by Steve Carrell) says nothing as his wife (played by Carrell's actual wife Nancy Carrell) leaves the car without a word. Dodge, an insurance salesman, returns to work the next day for lack of a better idea. The office is nearly empty and, while starting his car to return home, a coworker lands on Dodge's windshield. His friends have embraced their fate by throwing a party in their home filled with drugs, alcohol, and free love. Dodge flees the party in terror and returns to his empty apartment. On another night, he wanders a local park, drinks Windex and passes out. When he wakes, he finds a dog tethered to his foot with the word ""sorry"" written on a Post-It note on his sweater. He takes the dog home and reminisces about a lost love until he's interrupted by his neighbor crying on the fire escape. The neighbor, Penny (played by Keira Knightley), had just broken up with her boyfriend who caused her to miss the last plane home to her family in England. Despite their proximity, they've never spoken. So Penny (Knightley) takes the opportunity and hands Dodge some mail  that was meant for him but placed in her mailbox. Among the many letters he didn't get, there's a letter from the same former girlfriend Dodge had been thinking about. A riot breaks out that evening causing Dodge to leave town and invite Penny along, claiming he knows someone with a plane who can bring her to her family. Along the way they encounter others making a final journey while they, meaning Dodge and Penny, develop a close relationship of their own.

  This is not your typical comedy, obviously. Nor is it your typical end of the world film. In your typical end of the world film, e.g. Armageddon, Deep Impact, 2012, the world doesn't end. The last great hope of humanity works and everyone lives happily ever after. And your typical comedy isn't this gruesome. I call it that not because gory images are a constant in the film, but because they appear unexpectedly and startle the other characters and the viewers. Still, Knightley and Carrell play well off each other and their story is believable enough. As for the supporting cast, Martin Sheen, Derek Luke, and T.J. Miller among them, they all bring something to the story.",1348272000,,2632,4.611111111111111

I rarely see a movie in the theater twice, but I felt ""seeking a friend"" deserved my money twice. And I don't understand why it did poorly. but it wasn't promoted very well.
Expect some good laughs, some romance(it's basically a romantic comedy), some tear jerking, sadness, happiness, and just about everything I'd want in a movie. I don't care about car chases or CGI. Which are fine...if the movie has a good premise, script, plot, etc...
I keep checking for the DVD release because I want to see it again.
You know the premise. There is an asteroid heading for earth that will cause the end of the world in 3 weeks. I love how they took this very depressing idea, and made it into something really special.

Dodge (Steve Carell) has been living a mundane life until an asteroid is predicted to destroy the earth in two weeks. In the first scene, his wife leaves him because their marriage wasn't working anyway. He goes to work because he doesn't know what else to do.

Some people are trying to get in everything they ever wanted to do during their lifetime while others are committing suicide. His friends are having End-of-the-World parties and want to hook him up with someone to spend his last days with.

When rioting begins, Dodge and a neighbor he's just met leave the city and begin a road trip. He wants to find his high school love. Penny's (Kiera Knightley)family is in England so she goes along since she has no one else.

Over all there wasn't much humor, but there was romance which was nice. Still the movie can only be described as a downer.",1344643200,5,979,4.48314606741573
5097305,5,B007L6VRHG,"As soon as I saw the title for this movie, I knew it was going to be a great film.  It's really an exploration of Existentialism.  Whether we die from a meteor crashing into the Earth or we live out our lives in peace and good health - we all must eventually die.  So this film is really the sped-up version of the important responsible decisions and acts of genuine authenticity that we have to face in our lives.

There's two things you'll find interesting in this film.  One is how others around the central characters deal with their imminent demise.  There's nihilistic hedonism.  There's people who simply cannot process what's happening and just carry on with their now meaningless lives (that is, acting in ""bad faith"").  There's the anti-humanist, devout believer who's content in their prison cell - satisfied that the world is finally coming to an end.  There's people who commit shocking suicides, and those that hire someone else to put them out of their misery.  It's not exactly a comedy.  Like Dodge's friend's wife tells him, ""You're not getting out of this one.""

The second thing that you'll find interesting is how Dodge finds a type of ""salvation"" inside all this doom.  And I won't spoil that for you, but I'll just say that it's going to require an active, authentic decision on his part about how he wants to spend his last moments.

Also, thank-you so much to the film's writer(s) for not chickening out and giving this movie a fake, ""Hollywood"", happy ending.  I highly recommend this movie.  It will wake you up to life and its amazing possibilities.

P.S. ultimately, Existentialism is a failed philosophy, but that doesn't make it a bad one.  The last half of the 20th century was filled with European (Continental) philosophers explaining exactly *how* Existentialism is failed.  But I will leave that as an exercise to the truly curious and thoughtful.",1342742400,54,1883,4.791925465838509

Instead what I got was heartfelt, somewhat sad, comedic love story. Steve Carell and Kiera Knightly were absolutely perfect in these roles. My suggestion is to either watch the trailer and then watch the movie or go into it having an open mind without watching the trailer. No spoilers below, just opinions.

The reality is 95% of the movie coasts along with some pretty funny moments and some moments that may even have you reflecting on your own personal life.
Then the last 10 minutes of the movie hits and I believe that's where I came to absolutely love it and was even actually blown away.

After the movie was over we were still discussing it an hour later because it had us thinking so much. Steve Carell and Kiera Knightly were so freaking good and were so believable in their roles.
