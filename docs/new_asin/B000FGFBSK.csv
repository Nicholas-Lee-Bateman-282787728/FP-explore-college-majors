There was several in mine.",1231200000,3,100,4.315789473684211
8122060,4,B000FGFBSK,"The picture and audio quality of the episodes on here is very good.  The only bad thing is the episodes don't contain the original theme music. However, they contain an instrumental version of ""The Ballad of Jed Clampett"".  If it weren't for the theme, I would have given it 5 stars",1166486400,3,282,4.509803921568627
