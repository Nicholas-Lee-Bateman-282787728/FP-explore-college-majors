5743345,5,B00CWBPQ22,"Like many, many, many, maybe millions of people, I like Tyler Perry.  He makes plays and movies that makes me laugh and when people in this world are doing so much to one another, it is NICE to take my sees off of the world and watch a play or movie that Mr. Perry has made that makes me laugh.  But do not get me wrong I do not like ALL his movies or PLAYS, but the plays that makes me laugh and teaches some very well needed lessons, I watch over and over.  I hope and pray someone will tell Mr. Perry to remember that people need to laugh and not be focus on what is happening in this world that God created for the people he made, and I know it is hurting God's heart that they are doing BAD things.  I have added this dvd to my other Tyler Perry collections of dvd's, I now have ten (10).  My favorite is ""why did I get married, the orginial play.  I did not like the ""second  why did I get married. Maybe one day he will make a play about the Bible, I think God laughs because I beleive he is laughing at the devil because, He sees that the devil is going to lose and Jesus is going Win.

That's what Taylor Perrys is about people! He has an ear for how real folks speak dialogue and a he has a mouth that is one of the prettiest I've seen in ages.
