467604,5,6302413559,"I had seen part of this movie, but not all of it until the other day.  I can see why alot of people consider this Elvis's best role.  The music is great and original, and Elvis is playing a surly, rebellious young man with attitude, and he gives a great performance.  I have recently read a couple of books about James Dean, and have watched a program in the past year where Frank Mazzola (""Rebel without a Cause"" cast member) said when Elvis hit it big and went out to Hollywood he asked Mazzola all about Dean, knew all the dialogue from ""Rebel"" etc.  Watching Elvis in ""Jailhouse Rock"" I couldn't help but think of James Dean and how I bet Elvis loved playing that part since he idolized Dean who had died tragically in a car crash before Elvis became a big star.

Elvis was always known for being polite and well-mannered, but he plays a rude, big-headed punk very well in this film.  He was in his prime - looked great, sounded great and did his best James Dean.",1092787200,6,967,4.314917127071824
467605,4,6302413559,"Elvis came of age as a dramatic character actor in his third film, utilising his innate animalism as the primary character's motivation. As Vince Everett, a violent young man imprisoned for man-slaughter, Elvis plays the character with ease, at once tender, surly, arrogant and humble. The film studio's motivation may have been to exploit the rock'n'roll bandwagon for all it was worth (this was 1957 after all - rock was just a ""passing fad"") but Elvis rose to a greater challenge - to prove that he could pass muster as a big-screen actor, AND fly the rock'n'roll flag. He succeeded - brilliantly.
Even if the direction is a little staid at times, and the storyline was an old one even then, the film brought rock'n'roll squarely into the adult marketplace, where it stayed.
Alex Romero's imaginative choreography of the title number(with not a little help from Elvis himself), risque dialogue (""that ain't tactics honey, it's just the beast in me"") and the bleak, anti-social central character (the Hollywood stereotype of youth during the 50s - see ""The Wild One"" and ""Blackboard Jungle"") combined to create an iconic portrayal of the ""Rock Rebel"".
""Jailhouse Rock"" remains the template for the cinematic fusion of rock music and drama.",1072483200,5,1241,5.029126213592233

467607,4,6302413559,"Slap my hand for being slow to get around to it but I have only recently seen JAILHOUSE ROCK for the first time - in fact at the 25th anniversary of his passing.
Elvis's acting is nothing less than superb in this film. It shows how gifted an actor he REALLY was and how insultingly poor most of the latter scripts were, to effectively lower a talented actor to the level of the writers plots. (The quality of many movie songs is also an insult. I can only have nightmares about any songs that may have not have been good enough to made the cut.)
JAILHOUSE ROCK reminded me what a phenominal ""mover"" Elvis was, in the league of the finest dancers or athletes. Sadly the memory of his many gifts are often clouded by over the top impressionists and silly glitzy Vegas trinkets. The man was a formidable singing AND acting talent and this film is the proof.
My general feeling is pan and scan stinks and should be avoided at all costs. Enjoy the full width version and see exactly what the director captured as Elvis gave possibly his best film performance ever.
If only we could go back in time...keep Elvis clean of drugs, keep the scripts to this level, and put Col. Parker on a slow boat nowhere.
If I can dream.....",1029801600,37,1217,4.389380530973451
467608,5,6302413559,"""Jailhouse Rock"" really turns Elvis loose on the big screen in his third motion picture. It is, without a doubt, one of the best of the best from the King! Great soundtrack, great storyline, and great acting all make up this spectacular rock'n'roll classic to be seen by every Elvis fan everywhere. The ""Jailhouse Rock"" sequence was even choreographed by Elvis himself!",1029369600,2,369,4.967741935483871
467609,5,6302413559,"I have watched this movie numerous times.  Each time I watch it I see something new. I have found that the movie echoes to some degree the life of Elvis from the time he began a recording carrer on through his movie days. It also shows how two - faced the music industry could be.  For those of you that have only seen the movie once or twice, I urge you to watch it un -interrupted. Maybe you too will see what I am talking about. I promise that you will not be disappointed. Others say Elvis can't act. Watch this movie and YOU be the judge.",992304000,,543,4.065420560747664
467610,5,6302413559,"This was one of Elvis Presley's best movies. Elvis Presley proofed that he can do drama with this film.
You'll never find a movie like it. This was Elvis Presley 3rd movie.
How could anybody not enjoy this movie. Even if they are not an Elvis Presley fan.
Vince Everett (Elvis Presley) is a truck driver. One day he is in a bar. When a woman beater shows up. Vince protects a woman. And Vince gets into a fight with the man.
Vince ends up in jail. He is put in a cell with a country music star named Hunk Houghton (Mickey Shaughnessy).
One day a show is done from the jail. Vince gets a part in the show. Soon after he gets a lot of fan mail. Hunk is in the jail postoffice and is waiting to count his fan mail. But finds lot of the mail is for Vince Everett.
So he gives the mail to the warden (Hugh Sanders). On the day Vince is freed, Hunk tells him that he wrote a letter to a shop owner (Percy Helton) for a sining job. But the job is beening a bar boy. So Vince goes on stage and sings Young and Beautiful.
He meets Peggy Van Alden (the late Judy Taylor). She tells him to make a tape recording.
Soon after he gets a manger (Vaughn Taylor). And he has another hit with Treat Me Nice.
Sadly Judy Taylor was killed in a car crash after the movie was completed.",984355200,4,1264,4.01984126984127
7826066,5,6302413559,"I loved this movie AND the tape. It came in a rental case, and it blacked out once or twice, but that is not what I care about. The main thing was the tape. This WAS the original 1980 VHS, with the right logos and everything. The seller did point out that it was an MGM/CBS Home Video release, and my son is collecting those tapes right now. As you can see, he loved the video, (especially the previews at the end). This seller was honest, and I highly recommend him.",1521504000,,467,4.142857142857143

7826072,5,6302413559,"The movie was in excellent condition when it arrived. This is one of Elvis' first movies and it blossomed his way to stardom. The songs are the style of the 50's which was the beginning of the rock n' roll era. Elvis shows his unique style of dancing in this movie which was one of his trademarks of his early years. He really gets into the songs, like ""You Ain't Nothin' but a Hound Dog"". A classic scene in this movie is where Elvis and a large group of men from the jailhouse do their dance. This is one of Elvis' #1 hits and it is a gem of a movie.",1363478400,,552,3.981981981981982

7826074,5,6302413559,"This was Elvis' finest film although he never would see it during his life due to the terribly tragic death of his co-star Judy Tyler. She recently wed after the film and was killed with her new husband in a car crash very shortly after the film wrap. Elvis, who was very fond of her, (she made only one other film-Bop Girl) vowed never to watch the film as it was too painful to see the late Ms Tyler- so full of life- with so short a time to live.  It is sad that one of the few films worth viewing, was never seen by Elvis due to his deep and lifelong pain over Judy Tyler's tragic death. She was 23.",1206662400,9,603,3.9834710743801653
7826075,5,6302413559,"This is Presley's third and best film which was released in 1957 just as he was reaching his peak. It is in ultra-cool black & white which just seems to add to its value. It has great dramatic appeal and is best remembered for its great songs, and for scenes that typify the Presley personality. One song is the incredible Jailhouse Rock musical sequence, with all of the blistering excitement and energetic dancing by the man who did it best.",1108512000,6,443,4.55
