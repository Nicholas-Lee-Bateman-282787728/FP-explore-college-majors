Metal - A Headbanger's Journey begins with footage from 1986 with kids gathering for a rock festival. They're partying, playing air guitar, dressed in the proper attire of black t-shirts or no shirts at all, but most of all, they just look like they are out for a good time. But, someone is out to ruin their fun...

The film switches to the September 19, 1985 Parents Music Resource Center (PMRC) Senate hearings. The group published their ""Filthy Fifteen"" list of songs, along with their interpretation of what the lyrics are about. Artists included Venom, Mercyful Fate, Def Leppard, Prince, Sheena Easton, Vanity, Madonna and Cyndi Lauper, among others.

Looking precisely like he just left the stage, singer Dee Snider, addressed the Senate suits, including future VP Al Gore. It's interesting to note that in part of Snider's speech which wasn't included in the film, he explained that he was raised a Christian and follows many of the same ideals, doesn't drink, smoke or do drugs and is a married father of a three-year-old. In other words, he was showing that beneath his mountainous blonde mane, he's actually not unlike most adults, except that he sings in a heavy metal band.

Since I seem to be the only person addressing this committee today who has been a direct target of accusations from the presumably responsible PMRC, I would like to use this occasion to speak on a more personal note and show just how unfair the whole concept of lyrical interpretation and judgement can be and how many times this can amount to little more than character assassination.

The hysteria surrounding the questionable lyrics was described as being the ""moral panic of the day."" Despite the farce of the hearings, the music industry adopted the PMRC sticker rating system, which actually caused sales to increase in the case of some artists - forbidden fruit.

Sam Dunn introduces himself. He's earned a Masters in Anthropology and his thesis was on the Guatemalan refugees, but he always wanted to do a study about heavy metal. He's a skinny, long-haired fan and looks indistinguishable from the masses of metal fans from 1986, most of whom also probably grew up to be...responsible, normal adults. Sam's a scholar and his approach to looking at metal from an intellectual point of view doesn't always work.

Take the interview with the band Mayhem.

They basically spewed forth swears and boasts about how they are the best band in the world and said absolutely nothing of substance. Dunn included the clip but mentioned that beer and interviews sometimes don't mix. A more serious documentary would have cut this footage out. So, don't go looking for something to base a thesis on, but do be prepared to be entertained and mildly educated about various aspects of the metal world.

Mars Bonfire, the stage name for musician Dennis Edmonton (1943), was the person who wrote the Steppenwolf classic ""Born To Be Wild"" which mentions the term ""heavy metal"" for the first time. I didn't know he was a Canadian or what his name was. Now I know.

People weighed in with their opinions of the first heavy metal band. Some cite Blue Cheer but most mentioned Black Sabbath. This led to an interview with Black Sabbath guitarist and leader Tony Iommi. According to Wikipedia, ""The tritone, as its name implies, is a musical interval that spans three whole tones or six semitones. The two most basic types of tritone are the augmented fourth and the diminished fifth.""

Wikipedia also cites examples of where we hear the tritone, known as the Devil's interval, in songs such as Black Sabbath's ""Black Sabbath"", Metallica's ""Enter Sandman"", Jimi Hendrix's ""Purple Haze"", Sibelius's ""Fourth Symphony"", Liszt's ""Dante Sonata"", the music of Slayer and King Crimson and believe it or not, in the Simpsons theme and the musical West Side Story. Iommi simply thought the ""tritone"" sounded evil and wrote lyrics to go along with the sound. Later on, Black Sabbath really took advantage of the demonic imagery in order to make a lot of money and have a schtick to really make them stand apart from other bands.

This led to a discussion of the classical influences on heavy metal, something that was obvious to me, but was totally unknown to a long-time rock fan who I mentioned the film to today. To illustrate the point, they play Bach on a harpsichord and seamlessly seague to Eddie Van Halen playing Bach-like material (if not Bach) on his electric guitar.

The film also discussed the other major influence in metal was also discussed, the blues. Tony Iommi actually mentioned that Sabbath were essentially a blues and jazz band at the begining, and were also influenced by the dire working class, poor neighborhoods that they grew up in.

Other themes and connections to metal, such as sexuality, how dressing like women is actually extreme masculinity, religion, church burnings in Norway, violence and gore are explored in the movie. Tom Araya, the lead singer in Slayer, raised a Catholic, quipped that religion was the biggest brain washing tool in America and that art is a reflection of society and that they're just picking up the darker reflections. He also mentioned that ""everyone knows what's wrong, the things you do not do. The people who don't understand that aren't connected with themselves spiritually."" That's quite a profound statement from someone who likes to have provocative song titles simply because it will get them a lot of attention. Slayer are simply trying to stay in the spotlight just like every other band, and who can blame them?

Alice Cooper was interviewed a few times and he proved to be one of the most interesting people Dunn spoke with. Regarding Satanism, Cooper said, ""If you're looking for Satanism, don't look to rock'n'roll. It's all Halloween."" He went on to recount how when he meets black metal bands in Norweigian shopping malls, how they seem like the most harmless people, yet he marvels at the one up-man-ship they have between them, to be more extreme than the next band.

Dunn's trip to Norway to explore one of metal's recent and most notorious sub-genres, Norweigian Black Metal, was quite interesting and somewhat sad at the same time. He noted that Norway is 87% Lutheran but their biggest cultural export is, ironically, Satanic Black Metal and he describes it as punk meets Wagner dressed as Alice Cooper. There's no way to discuss Norway's metal scene without talking about the burning of churches by some metal musicians. The bands see Christianity as something that was forced upon Norway about 1000 years ago and it's the big bad guy. They see Satanism as something for people who are born to be kings, strong, and free. It's not for the timid or weak. By this definition, a church minister said that the Satanists will always be in small numbers since most people are not like them. As far as Alice Cooper is concerned, however, it's all so Spinal Tap to him.

Cooper was one of the most reviled performers in popular music in the seventies by those who didn't understand him. He went on to say ""There's more blood in MacBeth than in my show, and that's required reading in school.""

The topic of suicide rears its ugly head but Dunn doesn't get too much into the stories about bands being sued for causing kids to commit suicide, which is a pathetic accusation in the first place. It's noted by UCLA musicologist Robert Walser that the most powerful predictor of whether someone will commit suicide is the feeling of helplessness...but no one listens to metal to feel helpless.

The documentary is a terrific starting point to gaining an understanding of what makes metal fans such a brotherhood. It intelligently discusses the differences between the major categories of metal and it may surprise you by how many sub-genres he identifies. There is so much to the world of metal, so many more people who could have been interviewed that I hope more intelligent films of this ilk are made.

Dunn also peppers the film with insightful analyses and commentaries from members of academia who are knowledgeable about metal, journalists, a musicologist and industry insiders, including Brian Slagel, Bob Ezrin, and Malcome Dome. Ronnie James Dio and Bruce Dickinson were very interesting to listen to as were Cannibal Corpse, Angela from Arch Enemy, Geddy Lee, Lemmy and the world's most famous groupie, Pamela Des Barres. The who's who of who didn't appear in the film is astonishing, such as Metallica, Judas Priest, Ozzy Osbourne, and so on. I'm hoping that someone makes a follow up.

My rating for this film is 4/5. Look for the double DVD version on sale soon.",1147132800,54,8657,4.887525562372188
2517622,5,B000EGEJIY,"I saw this movie in New York City April 21. I must say that I was refreshed to see a movie that didn't focus on the ""meathead"" stereotype that Metal as a genre has. I was pleasantly surprised to hear intelligent interviews about reasoning, history, folklore and roots of metal. It is good for fans to see their favorite Metal artists talking in an intelligent fashion, which shows that Metal isn't just a no brain, long haired world. Every Metal fan should see this, especially young kids whom think that this genre is all about violence, gore, and satanism. Metal: A Headbangers Journey is the ultimate study in a genre many misunderstand, and many partake in.

The movie also features great footage, editing, found footage, and obviously the music featured is spectacular.

Great job, I will have the dvd the day it comes out!",1145836800,8,828,4.743055555555555
2517623,5,B000EGEJIY,"I saw this awesome documentary at the Gene Siskel Film Theater in Chicago a couple days ago, and I feel that Sam Dunn has done an incredibly accurate analysis of the evolution, misconceptions, and ideas involved in metal culture. Though lacking in extensive detail for time's sake, Mr. Dunn has still worked to debunk many of the common stereotypes and misconceptions about the brotherhood of metalheads, both past and present. My favorite interviews include those of Ronnie James Dio- the guy seems so nice, and has a great sense of humor....and my other favorite is with one of the guys from Gorgoroth. The guy is so drugged up or brainwashed by something, that he barely can answer a question. I picked up this DVD and it's definitely going to be a an awesome thing to show to my metalhead and non-metalhead friends. Incredibly entertaining, and highly recommended.

2517644,5,B000EGEJIY,"The metal head in me is very disappointed that this documentary never even came across him until very recently. Metal - A Headbanger's Journey, is a 96 minute documentary directed by hardcore metal fan Sam Dunn. The movie is very well made and executed as Sam goes on a personal journey that takes him to London, Germany, Norway, and back to the US where he's originally from, as he delves very deep into the roots of metal and even addresses much of the backlash the music form has received over the years. Very well rounded metal fans more than likely won't learn anything new at all. However, the intermediate and beginners will learn plenty. There were things I didn't know which added to my overall enjoyment though.  The film was originally released in 2005, it was later re-released in 2006 as a two disk edition.

Sam Dunn had his act together for this one as he made this movie so fun to watch along with being educational in regards to heavy metal. There's some good footage of early and at the time current bands, along with some music of well known songs such as Motorhead's Ace of Spades and We're Not Gonna Take It! by Twisted Sister , but it's the interviews that shine as they feature faces like Tony Iommi, Dio, Dee Snider, Lemmy, Rob Zombie, Girl School, John Kay and just so many others.

The interviews are the cream filling of this treat; I enjoyed all of the commentary and background, but Sam Dunn didn't only bother with the actual music artist. He reached out to the fans for their take on what metal means to them, and this part of the film resonated with me the most because many of them echoed my love for the music. There was a 34 year old fan whom proudly expressed his love for metal, and pretty much gave the finger to friends and detractors alike who criticizes him for it. I love how deeply the music genre has reached out to so many people. Dunn interviewed true fans of the art, and completely did away with the trend followers which lends a strong credibility to the film.

The history lesson is fun, and it was great to learn more about certain bands such as Slayer for example, and their anti-religion beliefs. There was coverage and interviews on different girl bands and girl fronted groups such as Girl School, Arch Enemy, and Doro. Plus the metal festival that takes place in Germany was covered with a hilarious interview taking place with Mayhem.  However, it's the Norwegian black metal scene that stole the show as these guys are real Satanist with something to say.

This film is just fun, fun, fun, and my only gripe is that there was plenty of room for more. Thankfully the second disk is very strong with extras featuring extended interviews with many people, more coverage on the Norwegians, and The Definitive Heavy Metal Tree which features every influential band placed in their respected categories such as power metal, doom metal, black metal, and thrash. This portion is excellent for those just getting into the metal scene, since it makes a great checklist on where exactly to begin and move to.

Metal - A Headbanger's Journey is the best music documentary I came across. Perhaps it's more because over the last couple of years metal has reached out to me in  a way no other music form has ever done. I was originally brought up on Rap, but I can honestly say it didn't give me the same drive as this. There was something clearly missing that I could never put my finger on; I finally found that missing something in metal, and I highly recommend this feature to everyone with even the slightest amount of interest in metal.

Pros: Very informative and anyone can get into it.

Cons: Left me wanting a lot more",1430265600,4,3671,4.565349544072948

2517658,5,B000EGEJIY,"This film is certainly a great introduction to the world of Heavy Metal for anyone who is a layperson to the genre. The film does not, for obvious reasons of length, delve too deeply into individual subjects, though it does give the primary and more relevant information to each chapter of the film.
If you enjoyed this film and wish to gain further information on the subject of heavy metal, I strongly recommend Sam Dunn's documentary series ""Metal Evolution"", in which he explores the origins and nature of the individual genres of heavy metal like NWOBHM (New Wave of British Heavy Metal), Glam, Thrash, Grunge, Nu-metal, etc.",1375920000,,630,4.897196261682243

2517660,5,B000EGEJIY,"I first saw this documentary when it was aired in May of 2005 on VH1, and although I was only 12 years old then and 8 years have passed, watching Metal - A Headbangers Journey stil brings tears to my eyes! After I watched this documentary by Sam Dunn, it not only peaked my interest in heavy metal, but gave me a thorough introduction to this beautiful genre of music. I have been a quote-on-quote ""metalhead"" since I saw this film, and I have yet to see another movie/documentary come close to this one.

Sam Dunn, using his anthropology background, seeks to discover the roots of metal, trace its history up to the present day, all the while exploring the topics that have made heavy metal so controversial: Sexuality, violence, religion and death(among other things). I love all the interviews that Sam made a part of this film! He speaks with metal pioneers like Tony Iommi of Black Sabbath, and Bruce Dickinson of Iron Maiden, and then he also talks with up and coming metal acts such as Corey Taylor from Slipknot, and Angela Gossow from Arch Enemy (Which is my favorite metal band by the way). The great thing about this documentary is that Sam attempts to give a history of heavy metal both for fans, and for those people who may be critical of heavy metal in the first place. By this film's end Sam tries to tell the listener that although metal has a bad reputation , and appears sinister on the outside, it gives some people a way to escape daily life and a place to belong.

Overall, Metal - A Headbangers Journey is an excellent film on the history of Heavy Metal, and it will always have a special place in my heart. If you are a fan of metal, or even someone who is just curious about this genre of music, you must own this film!! As Sam Dunn says at the end of the film, ""metal is something you either get or you don't, if it doesn't make the hair on the back of your neck stand up, or give you a surge of power, then you might never get it, and that's ok, because we(metal fans) are doing just fine without you!""",1368144000,2,2029,4.336842105263158

They've even been given their own television series ""Metal Evolution"" which I don't get to see often but when I do I enjoy it quite a bit. One of the best things about this doc is all of the great interviews shown in the film such as Vince Neil, Tony Iommi, the late great Ronnie James Dio, they even traveled across the globe to get footage at Wacken and interviews with the Norwegian black metal bands.

For the length of time available to cover a genre, and sub-genres, and sub-sub-genres in a category of music that's so far reaching, those on the outside can't even begin to understand the complexities, it's my opinion that this was spot on.

I found myself nodding my head, and smiling, at so many things said throughout the film. The comment about 'metal for life' (think it was Rob Zombie's 2 cents) is truth.

This DVD never ceased to give the kind of awesome goosebumps you get everytime you hear your favorite song - that is, if you like metal.
My only wish is that next time he includes the likes of Metallica *no need to explain why, even if you aren't a Metallica fan, you know they've contributed to the movement greatly* - and Drain sth, who, in my opinion, is the best all-girl metal band there ever was... and I'm still sad that they haven't considered a reunion, yet.

Not really, I'm not a fan of 80's metal that much. So that section I found hard to get into...I was just waiting for Thrash and Death Metal. Big unfortunate...I like metalcore. Bands like Trivium, God Forbid, All that remains, Killswitch Engage, Chimaira...bands like that. And this didn't go into those at all. Some of the interviews to I felt, didn't show metal as metal. The band member being interviewed explained his story and what not but...it was kinda like...""I love metal."" As opposed to going in depth and explaining..metal gives me this euphoric feeling throughout my body. And it tickles my penis...which in turn tickles my fancy. I felt that at times the documentary didn't show the true real deep down love for metal. But it did at others. I don't know...I can't really explain but I didn't find myself LOVING it.

I have watched this film and its accompanying bonus feature disc more times than I have counted.  It is fairly thorough in its approach, highly entertaining, and most informative.  Thanks to this film (or no thanks, depending on who you ask), I got turned on to Norwegian Black Metal.  I also learned that Ronnie James Dio has a great sense of humor, Tom Araya is a very articulate man, and that Alice Cooper is as cool as I've long believed he is.

2517688,3,B000EGEJIY,"Most absurd was the minimal coverage of Judas Priest.  They mention them for less then 20 seconds as if they had very little impact on heavy metal.  They aren't called The Metal Gods for nothing.  Judas Priest pioneered metal with their classic songs victim of changes, sinner, hell bent for leather, breaking the law, and screaming for vengeance.  They continued their legacy with great metal albums like defenders of the faith, turbo, ram it down, painkiller, and angel of retribution.  Judas Priest are NOT known as a gay band as some other amazon poster proclaimed.  Other phenomenal bands that received little or no recognition are Danzig, Alice Cooper, W.A.S.P, Metallica, Megadeth, Scorpions, Accept/UDO, Ozzy, Yngwie Malmsteen, Manowar, White Zombie, Ministry, King Diamond, Mercyful Fate, and Godsmack.  The director needed to focus on their accomplishments and contributions to metal.  Instead you get meandering interviews.

Iron Maiden received the most coverage which I thought was silly because Iron Maiden are known for borrowing their theatrical ideas from Alice Cooper.  Their music is a synthesis or spin off of Judas Priest and Rainbow.  Iron Maiden are a great band and have left their charismatic mark on metal; however, Judas Priest and Alice Cooper are the true pioneers.

Dio gets honorable mentioned which he deserves.  Dio has been around for ages and many metal bands have borrowed from his style.  It was also very enlightening how the director covered death and black metal bands; however, they didn't include Therion which is probably the best band from that sub-genre.

I hope they do a sequel.",1248220800,,1625,5.196153846153846

He plays the part of the dumb blond rocker with his speech folded up in his back pocket. The discomfort on the faces of the senators is brilliant.
The film gives a great overview of the history and sub-genres and the controversies that have followed. I still get pissed off every time there is a serial killer that happens to listen to metal everyone tries to blame the music. Why don't we do that when the killer listens to classical or jazz?

Anyway if you have kids who listen to metal and you are worried that they are going to turn out bad because of metal watch this film. It might help you relax.

2517718,4,B000EGEJIY,"Metal - A Headbanger's Journey is an insightful look into the world of heavy metal.  If you take it light-heartedley, this doco gives a wonderful ""overview"" of what metal is all about.  This in no way should be taken as a ""complete history of"" or the be all and end all film about metal, but merely as an introduction to the many social aspects that turn people towards (and in some cases against) metal. It's produced quite well, and overall a lot of people will be quite satisfied watching some of the more ""famous/commercial"" stars of the metal/hard rock world tell their opinions on the various aspects of what makes metal, metal!

This however, is perhaps the film's greatest downfall, in that most of the bands concentrated on are the more commercial ones, and even in some cases, not metal at all, I mean really why are Slipknot, Korn and Rage Against The Machine included.  It's like they were dumbing it down so the general public would watch and go ""oh so that's what it's all about"".

Another aspect that could of enhanced the film, is to take opinions of European and other non North American metal fans, as i'm sure most people would agree, there is quite a divide between the American ""scene"" and the European one.  His visit to Norway and Wacken was good, but he still left out a hell of a lot of info about Swedish death metal, German thrash and English death and doom and the effect it had on the metal psyche in those parts of the world.

I dont' see how you can neglect entire sub-genres of metal and try to give an explanation of what metal is all about.  I can guarantee that Alice Cooper's take on metal differs significantly from say, everyone else.  If Alice Cooper thinks metal is just an act, that's because to him, metal was just an act.  Would people like Dead or Rob Darken think that?

This basically comes down to what I said at the start, if you take this light-heartedly, this is great, semi-factual family entertainment.  Gaahl's ""Satan"" is the funniest thing i have ever seen.  I know this is not meant to be a history of metal, but if you think this is the ultimate guide to what metal is all about, aka its stereotypes, its sexuality, its whatever, you're probably reading this listening to Slipknot in the background right now.",1203120000,,2265,4.535626535626536

2517720,3,B000EGEJIY,"Sam Dunn, the director and tour guide through ""Metal,"" has lovingly constructed what comes across as a defense and an ode to heavy metal. As such, it doesn't constitute a documentary about heavy metal, much in the same way that ""Endless Summer"" is not a documentary of surfing. But it is nonetheless entertaining, with a satisfying, no-nonsense education on the exclusive genre. Tip of the hat to Dunn for giving face time to the stars of black metal, my particular favorite -- we need some of that in America, pro wrestlers who actually attack and kill each other from time to time, or the occasional exploding baseball.

My patience wears a bit thin when Dunn seems to be lobbying for a higher seat in the musical spectrum, almost beating it into your head that it is a wholesome diversion, and if you don't like it, that's fine because we're one big happy family on the outside. The same positive characteristics attributed to metal -- sense of community, outsider music, rebellious, confidence building, pushing the boundaries, nonjudgmental, even spiritual -- can be applied to any other musical genre (excluding adult contemporary). You ask the people about the music they cling to and adore and they will say pretty much the same things as the fans selected here.

I'm not sure how metal fans on a whole will take Dunn's journey. I think it will be split down the middle, but as I'm only metal-curious, it was quite satisfying and, seeing as somebody stole my copy of ""Reign in Blood"" years ago, I'm going to add it to my torrent queue or something. I wish Dunn had spent more time on the whole homoerotic subtext in much of heavy metal, as well as the religious aspect to metal. I personally think the whole greasy weightlifting, Mr. Universe thing is a bit nauseating: physical projections of psychosis, bipolar sores puffing up under the surface layer like jelly bubbling in the toaster. I think most of the pundits used in ""Metal"" are crackpots, the ""Dear Abbys"" of hard rock. I also found it disgusting the way Dunn let a little cinematic ""poot"" squeak out at the end of the film, let it hang in the air and assault all our senses: that heavy metal is a ""pipeline to god."" I'm sorry, but that's a bit too ""political"" for me. I'll just continue to genre-surf as I have been and let no particular brand be the ""Master"" of me.",1198454400,5,2335,4.63768115942029

2517727,5,B000EGEJIY,"As someone who came of age in the hardcore punk scene of the 1980's, metal was a music genre that I was familiar with but had only a mild interest in. However, I loved this movie!

Sam Dunn, the director, is a young anthropologist who sets out to explore metal as an important global subculture. He creates a ""Roots Of Metal"" graph which shows how the music has evolved through the years, with different bands listed in a variety of metal subgenres such as Shock Rock, Death Metal, Glam, Thrash Metal, etc. He also conducts some excellent interviews with metal icons such as Tony Iommi, Lemmy and Bruce Dickinson. I especially enjoyed the interviews with Ronnie James Dio. He came across as a very bright guy and I liked the story about he adopted the ""devil horns"" hand sign from his superstitious Italian grandmother who used it to ward off the ""evil eye"". Another cool part was his tracing the metal ""tritone"" note back to the Middle Ages when it was apparently considered a form of ""devil's music"".

But along with all this is plenty of great music and concert footage as well as interviews with regular metal fans and even a trip to Norway to meet some members of Black Metal bands, including one who spent time in jail for burning a church. In fact, this documnetary covers it all, from Poison to Cannibal Corpse and everything in between. This is worth watching by everyone from hardcore metal fans to the merely curious.

This is probably the most fun I've ever had watching a documentary, and I love documentaries.  The trouble is, most are depressing and tragic.  ""Metal"" is anything but.

I know hardcore metal fans like myself will love this flick, but I also think the casual fan will be just as in to it.  It's well paced, comprehensive without being exhaustive, and touches on almost every subject/ band you'd hope for.  My only personal let down is that Pantera and Dimebag (R.I.P.) aren't given more than a graphic on the metal- family tree (nor Metallica, Anthrax, Testament, or Sepultura for that matter...)

But hey, I'm nitpickin'.  Sam Dunn's journey is one that will resonate deeply with any heavy metal fan.  The interviews are absorbing, the editing and pacing are spot on, and Dunn's own passion for the subject really shine through the length of the film.

Rob Zombie's bits are classic, by the way.  ""You never meet a kid who's like ""Yeah, I was into Slayer for that ONE summer...""

A lot of ground is covered in this film. Someone else mentioned they could watch 10 hours of this and I agree. This could be made into a TV series and explore metal in even more detail. Sam constructs this awesome chart catagorizing all the types metal and their place in metal's family tree.

Ronnie Dio took a liking to Sam Dunn and I can see why. He's not your heavy set, dumb full of attitude headbanger - he's the guy we are or knew at school - that simply loves music and knows how to dig into the facades of different stories.

The interview with Dee Snider is a classic. They cover an important aspect of heavy metal I have never understood myself which is why tough men like to dress up like women in metal...the most masculine and brave thing you can do!

It chronicles the history and beginning of today's many popular metal genres including Heavy Metal, Industrial Rock, Black Metal, Hair Bands, etc.  I love watching this DVD as you get to see interviews with band members that helped make metal great and find out what they were thinking back in the day.",1168732800,2,345,4.548387096774194
2517734,5,B000EGEJIY,"For heavy metal fans, this DVD is a must have.  I was blown away in the first five minutes.  Sam Dunn has managed to take fans on a wild and woolly journey that spans time and space to present a solid and educational history of this often unfairly denigrated form of music.

Dunn presents a helpful schematic to assist us in finding our way amongst the often confusing twists and turns of metal in all its forms.  And he does not shy away from its darker manifestations (such as the Norway church burnings and accusations of glorifying suicide), something which I truly applaud him for having the courage to do.  As is usually the case, there are always those on the fringe who cast a negative pallor on metal as a whole.  But in this documentary, one learns that, for the most part, the satanic allusions and images are theatre--nothing more, nothing less.  Besides, it is fun to take a peek at the dark side on occasion!

The interviews are tastefully done, as we get to hear some famous names speaking as individuals, not performers.  Dunn seems to be able to ask just the right questions, even when facing some very intimidating characters.

I love every minute of this documentary, and have watched it several times already.  When I need a boost, when I want to know that I am not alone in my adulation of this art form (and despite its critics, it does have some classical origins that may surprise some people), I simply pop this DVD in my player and transport myself into another world.

Congrats to Sam Dunn for an excellent endeavor.  Metal will never die, despite all the criticisms and accusations.  And that perhaps is the greatest message this documentary provides for both fans and detractors.",1167264000,2,1708,4.631229235880399
2517745,4,B000EGEJIY,"I just had the opportunity to view this recently, and was pleasantly surprised by most of it. That is to say, most of it contained experiential fact and personally relative observations, although the subject of Satanism is gleaned over far too superficially, with only far too brief commentary by Reverend Baddeley. The presentation is divided into several segments according to categorized designations and tour travels.

The roots of the genre are discussed from bluesy inceptions to its more perfected evolutions with Black Sabbath to Dio to Judas Priest and Iron Maiden, under the heading of several catagories with a rather incomplete listing of bands. What particularly interested Myself was the subject of 'Black Metal', citing Venom {who coined the term}, Mercyful Fate {King Diamond's seperate band by the same name was also brought forth in this period}, Bathory, and Celtic Frost {in My opinion, more could have been added to that list such as Possessed and early Slayer, circa Haunting The Chapel through to Reign In Blood; Destruction, Exorcist, and Infernal Majesty} in the graph - all of whom are still performing, with greater stage shows overseas; and that is another dynamic noticed herein, in that the energy-filled, invigorating, vice-laden way that it used to be like in the states is apparently present in Europe, as displayed in the 'Wacken' Festival in Norway; and all of the earned ire from christians as well, as evidenced with Europe's own recent foray into the Satanic Panic paranoia, to the thrill and eustress of church-burning devil-worshippers and cowering christians alike.

Just a couple of points of contention:

Possessed is most definitely Black Metal, if that is to be catagorized as relating to The Occult and direct references to Satan, whether or not it is ideologically accurate is another matter altogether. What is imperative in the consideration of musical genres, is the entertainment factor, not whether or not it is expressing actual philosophy. That is what lectures, learning academies, and one's own personal study is for, not concerts and record albums, neither horror movies nor horror-fiction books for that matter. The key words are 'theatrical' and 'entertainment', not 'educational', for the most part.

I also noticed there is an odd listing for so-called ""Stoner Metal"", which very well could apply to every catagory, if one is to contemplate the usual activities associated with the types who generally listen to Metal {as seems to be the case with all other genres as well, as it seems to just be a preferred herd proclivity, musical preferance notwithstanding}, but not in some cases. To clarify, Candlemass would definitely fit into the 'Power Metal' category, even though they coined the term ""Doom Metal"" to describe the band.

Highlights include Sam Dunn's interviews with Ronnie James Dio, Alice Cooper, Dee Snider, Bruce Dickinson, Tony Iomi, Lemmy Kilmeister, Rob Zombie, Tom Araya and Kerry King.

In My estimation, this anthropological documentary captures the underlying sociological elements of this subculture, from the carnal and lusty, to the horror-shock theatrics which always gains attention. Out of its millions of fans, a few commit suicide despite the music, while multitudes besides have actually been prevented through the use of this aggressive and therapeutic form, where frustrations can be shouted into the air to the lyrics, and head-banging, fist-pounding, slam-dancing is a veritable alternative to the such afore-mentioned anti-productive cessation of life. As with the lyrical content, discrimination is necessary, and should not be taken by wrote, but is generally intended for amusement only. It is asserted that Metal can actually be life-affirming in its adrenaline-rush, and as with everything else, a balance is imperative to maintain perspective.

Metal: A Headbanger's Journey is an overview by an actual Metal fan about his own scene and lifestyle, thereby, the 'expert' - and despite some of the innacuracies inasfar as the ""lists"" and ""catagories"" go, the film footage and interviews are of worth. So whether or not you appreciate this music, it does provide a real view into the genre for both an anthropological sense, and if so inclined, an evocative one.

2517747,5,B000EGEJIY,"Thirty-something anthropologist Sam Dunn earned academic street cred with his thesis on Guatemalan refugees, and then set out to study the culture he truly loved--that of headbanging heavy metal.  Dunn himself has been a headbanger since age twelve, and he would have majored in metal studies at college if it had been in the curriculum.  His documentary is a rock solid examination of the culture of heavy metal.  It opens with the definitive question:  Who was the first metal band?  He builds consensus on the best candidate, simultaneously paying tribute to the important influences that pre-dated the birth of metal.

Dunn explores all aspects of heavy metal culture, from gender and sexuality to censorship to basic musical constructs of a heavy metal song and band.  The story of heavy metal is told via band interviews, concert footage, early fan home videos, fan interviews, festival experiences, and even Senate hearings (the Parents Resource Music Center debacle in the 1980's).  Dunn interviews a veritable who's who of rock musicians and critics, including Chuck Klosterman, Dee Snider, Rob Zombie, Alice Cooper, Geddy Lee, and Ronnie James Dio.  The purchase price is justified alone by Dio's comment on his Italian grandmother's role in the genesis of the devil horns symbol.  The DVD release includes a bonus documentary about the Norweigan black metal scene, filled with insightful commentary from the authors of Lords of Chaos.

Perhaps the most important legacy of Dunn's film is his Definitive Metal Family Tree, a masterpiece which traces metal sub-genres throughout the last four decades.  Metal, Shock Rock, Hard Rock, Glam Metal, Stoner Metal, Thrash Metal, Black Metal, Grindcore, Grunge Metal, Industrial Metal, Hard Alternative, and many more all have their place in Dunn's metal tree.  It's an ironclad tree which features several hundred bands all in their proper places.",1160611200,7,1900,5.293333333333333
2517748,5,B000EGEJIY,"MAN!! This documentary RULES!!!!

It's starts with the song ""number of the beast"" by Iron maiden and a bunch of kids in a stadium concert in 1986 dressing all black, drinking, smoking and shounting to the camera ""HEAVY METAL RULES!!!"" and not only that, Sam Dunn interview many classic singers, some of the new bands and even Noruegian bands.

The themes that Sam Dunn talk about are the origins, sound, musical roots, enviorment, culture, fans, censorship, sexuallity, satanisium and death and violence. He is very specific with his themes and make very interesting points of view. But what makes this documentary cool is that Sam Dunn travel to many countries for his interviews and there a lot of concerts scenes, some music videos scenes and the creepy images of cool album covers.

Im not gona tell you everything, but Im telling you!! If you are a fan of Heavy Metal or rock you will not be dissapointed by buying this cool and specific masterpiece!!!

P.S: The ONLY thing that I didn't like was that Sam Dunn didn't talked much about the 70's and 90's, he was more for the 80's. But that's it!! I still enjoying this documentary and I do not regret of buying it.

2517749,1,B000EGEJIY,"Things this ""documentary"" does well:

1) Establishes a connection between Heavy Metal and forms of art music such as Classical, albeit vaguely.

2) Attempts to give a quick historical analysis of metal. Unfortunately, this history is full of misinformation, and so, is misleading.

Things this documentary does badly:

1) Views heavy metal as just another type of music for entertainment rather than a genuine art form. This is what leads to the rest of the documentary's downfall.

2) Over emphasis on metal bands that have been a commercial success, and not necessarily those who have made a significant MUSICAL contribution.

3) Taking the views of such MTV product bands as 'Lamb of God', 'Cannibal Corpse', 'Rage Against the Machine (a rock band)', and 'Slipknot', some of whom don't even take themselves seriously, with no justification given as to why these bands are even worth looking at, while overlooking the many innovative bands that these outfits have ripped off.

4) Claiming that metal has something to do with 'politics' and engaging such bands, even though 'political' metal bands are the very antithesis of anything metal has stood for and makes it just another product.

5) Very little real analysis on the recurrence of other forms of art from humanity's past that are found in metal.

6) Lack of opinions from intelligent metalheads. The interviews with new comers to the scene in the form of overfed and 'depressed' 13 year olds and drunken youth at concerts are borderline embarrassing if one is trying to establish metal as a genuine art form.

7) Barely any mention of the MUSICAL contributions of Judas Priest and Metallica, not to mention a plethora of other bands in the more underground black and death metal scene. These are once again overlooked in favor of bands that have been a commercial success and have thus sacrificed their MUSICAL integrity in favor of a fat wallet.

8) Claiming that metal is 'a pipeline to God.' Metal has nothing to do with the worship of a spirit, but the strengthening of one's own spirit.

9) Wasting too much time on interviewing rock stars such as Alice Cooper and Dee Snyder, who obviously feel left out of the present extreme scene because they keep emphasizing what they did for metal (which is not much at all actually.) And who wants to hear how many times Gene Simmons sued people? How are these things even important?

10) Shying away from topics such as Nationalism(not racism), and belief in self over religion, while Dunn tries to distance himself from these things as though they are not what made metal unique in the first place.

11) Cluelessness about the Black Metal scene, and success in making it look like a haven for idiots. What's the earthly use in interviewing Gaahl who was just a kid when the scene first started, without even examining WHY it started? Cradle of Filth is listed as a Norwegian Black Metal band, while some important Norwegian bands are not even mentioned.

12)Many more things, too much to be mentioned here. Don't buy this DVD if you know nothing about metal, because you'll get the wrong impression about this amazing and unique genre.

Don't buy this DVD if you know about metal, because any information in here is already available on the web. If you happen to come across it free, then give it a look, but don't take it very seriously. An excuse that is being made is that the producer didn't have enough time to cover all this, and wished it was 8 hours long. Thing is, it would have been 8 hours of more of this rubbish, that's all.",1159228800,21,3545,4.76797385620915
2517750,5,B000EGEJIY,"Horns up to Sam Dunn and co. for not only finally putting together a definitive documentary on my favorite genre of music, but for also having the excellent taste to do it right. It covers everyone from SABBATH to SLAYER to ENSLAVED, hits on Satanism, censorship and sexuality, and does a fantastic job of showcasing just how deep and varied metal really is. Worth the viewing alone for the metal genealogy chart. Where the film falters, however, is in trying to objectively explain the music's appeal - it sometimes feels at once passionate and defensive. Still, required viewing for anyone who knows the unfortunate difference between Ride the Lightning and St. Anger. 4.5/5.",1158537600,24,677,5.0
2517751,3,B000EGEJIY,"I'll get right to the point.  If you're a huge fan of NWOBHM and earlier metal then this isn't that good of a documentary.  If you like Slayer, Slipknot and the newer, harder metal then you'll probably like this alot.  I was pretty bummed that they didn't spend more time on the NWOBHM scene or heavy metal in other countries other than Norway and US.  I'm really into alot of metal bands from Italy, Spain, Argentina, Japan, Russia ect. and it would have been cool to see what the metal scenes are like in those places.  I understand that the movie would have to be 400 minutes long to get all that stuff in there but it would have been nice.  Also, where was Metallica?  The greatest metal band ever, when Cliff was alive, and they barely get mentioned.  Same with Judas Priest, all that was mentioned about them was the lame suicide lawsuit against them.  Too many amazing heavy metal bands not mentioned in this movie.  All in all though, a very interesting look at metal that is sure to please many.",1158451200,2,1004,4.437158469945355
2517752,5,B000EGEJIY,"I'm 42 and been a metal fan since hearing ""Smoke on the Water"" the first time as a kid.  Though my musical tastes have expanded to include quite a few other genres, I still find myself throwing metal cds into the player a few times a month - sometimes old stuff, sometimes new.  But I still love the power & intensity.  Director Sam Dunn knows this passion well, and does a bang-up job exploring the genre, its performers, and fans.  When Sam describes his childhood air guitaring to Iron Maiden before moving onto death & speedmetal as an older teen, I chuckled out loud... for me it was KISS as a kid, then moving into the harder, darker Iron Maiden as a teenager.  Like a lot of viewers, I especially enjoyed the segment on Norwegian black metal.  Been a fan of goth metal for years so it was interesting learning a little more about the more extreme form of dark metal.

As for the inclusion Rush's Geddy Lee -- their first 6 albums are metal any way you cut it.  They were definitely considered metal when I was a teen.  Way to go Sam Dunn!",1158105600,3,1045,4.317948717948718
2517753,4,B000EGEJIY,"First let me say I'm not a big fan of heavy metal rock. I like Twisted Sisters and (if you remember) Blue Cheer and MC5, but today their songs may not be heavy metal-ish enough for die-hard fans of the heavy metal music. Still I found this documentary very engaging and enjoyable with inspired commentaries from the interviewees including Dee Snider and Alice Cooper.

Some of the avid fans of the genre might be disappointed to find that the film is short on concert footages. Though the film contains the live performances from the various artists, the documentary is more interested in showing the surprisingly complex nature of the much-maligned music, beginning with a teasing question: what is the first heavy metal band?

Well, the question leads to another question, the roots of the metal, and directors Sam Dunn (a 30-year-old anthropologist and himself a metalhead), Scot McFadyen and Jessica Joy Wise travel with a camera to New York, LA, Canada, England, Germany and Norway, to find out what makes people love and hate the heavy metal music so much.

The results are hugely entertaining and informative documentary about the music with the interview footages with Tony Iommi, Dee Snider, Alice Cooper, Rob Zombie, and Bruce Dickinson to name a few. The highlight is Dee Snider recounting the days of the Tipper Gore's campaign that resulted in the `Parental Advisory' sticker, and his famous Senatorial hearings in 1985. The film includes the archive footages of Snider giving a witty testimony before the senators obviously upset by his unexpected counterattack. (Note: In 2002 an enjoyable made-for-TV film `Warning: Parental Advisory' was shot starring Jason Priestley and yes, Dee Snider. You should see it if you have a chance.)

`Metal: Headbanger's Journey' is not without flaws, though. The directors try to encompass a broader range of the genre than they can, and some themes need more time to be explored. One good example is the shocking incident in Norway, where a rock band is reportedly accused of instigating the people to burning the church. The theme of death and Satanism, frequently seen in the heavy metal music scene, also deserves more attention. Do they really mean it? Or do they just using it for self-promotion? Alice Cooper seems to know the answer (listen to his very amusing commentary on it), but the film probably intentionally refuses to delve deeper.

Still `Metal: Headbanger's Journey' is very entertaining and informative at the same time. Made with enthusiasm and love for the music, it will appeal even to a non-fan of the metal music.",1156809600,2,2587,5.020979020979021
2517754,5,B000EGEJIY,"I stand in total agreement with the average reviewer of this movie. It's a flick I can watch over and over again, so enough said. I have noticed certain contention regarding the inclusion of Geddy Lee in this movie. Now, granted he nor Rush are heavy metalers. However, Rush, with its hard rocking edge, is pretty much a ""next door neighbor"" to metal as the band and the genre co evolved in the same time space. If you notice too, that those who go to see Priest, Maiden, Scorpions, etc. perform in concert, generally attend Rush concerts as well. As far as I'm concerned, including Geddy Lee wise a wise move on behalf of Sam Dunn as I and many metalheads appreciate his perspective on music. Now, if Bon Jovi were featured (as I've seen him in other metal/hard rock documentaries and inclusions), THEN you would have a solid argument.",1156723200,,836,4.58

I am well versed in my knowledge of metal, but someone who is not may be left scratching there heads at what the hell some of the artists were talking about.  My only cheif complaint was the fact that the narrator jumped from genre to genre and left many influential bands off this DVD.  To talk about death metal and rarely mention Mercyful Fate..and to not even mention the band Death( the band that started it all in America) should be considered blasphemy in the metal community.  I am by no means trying to bash on the narrator, however he should have titled this journey part 1.  He then should have focused more time on one or two genres of music instead of trying to pigeon-hole them onto one 96 minute DVD.  Overall it is still a good DVD.

Be sure that you are aware that this isn't the ""history of heavy metal"" exactly - although there is a general flow through it.

To the people who are bashing it for not having a thesis..give it a rest. It's a glimpse into the culture of heavy metal.

2517768,3,B000EGEJIY,"""Headbanger Journey"" is supposedly made by metal fan
who was also grad student in athropology. So technically
sbdy that should have approched that subject with some degree
of scientific objectivity.
Alas it is a lukewarm, badly shot and amateurish effort of
sbdy that is so deeply in love with subject he can even for
a single moment detach himself from it.
His basic thesis is:
""I loved it as 12yo - and it still gives me that
empowerement rush and if you don't like it then
well... screw you!"".
Rest is strutting around pretending to be Mr Antropologist
and asking lame and sycophant interview questions. Best part
was probably Alice Cooper poking fun at Norwegian ""Death Metal""
groups - how he loved to check their pics in magazines - posed
to look like tough soldiers of Satan and in real life they are
total Spinal Tap - ""oh pleez Mr Cooper - how nice to see you -
my 65yo mother is right there - she would love to have your
autograph"".
I won't pretend that I like heavy metal. Musically it is boring
- how long can one listening to minor penthatonic scales coupled
with desperate attempts to shock with lyrics, loudness, album
covers etc. But I do not hate it either - when I was 12yo I loved
Deep Purple and Black Sabbath. So yes - I KNOW it is ""empowering""

2517771,4,B000EGEJIY,"I thought Sam Dunn (and the others involved) did a great job.  As mentioned below (in other reviews), the film is not a history of metal, rather it provides an anthropological study of the metal culture and its misinterpretation by society.  Funny enough, Rob Zombie seemed to communicate that the metal community, in some respects, embraces this misinterpretation which (potentially) acts as a barrier, a Chinese Wall, preventing the outside world from tarnishing the community's sacred space.  Although I can't fault Dunn for not elaborating, I would have enjoyed seeing more coverage of speed/thrash (and early ""black"") metal (possibly in the context of exploring white metal and its culture).  I especially enjoyed Dunn's connection of metal and classical music, and its virtuoso style(the Bach to Van Halen sequence was great).  I forget who said it, but one expect mentioned, ""if beethoven was around today, he'd probably be in Led Zepplin.""  Awesome.  One reviewer mentioned the Mayhem interview, noting that had this been a documentary, in the pure sense, the Mayhem interview would have been excluded; I agree.  However, in some respects, I feel that the interview's inclusion serves to reinforce the ""metal mindset"" -- just as metal fans have a good time and have fun with the music (taking its ""deathly"" serious nature with a grain of salt), it appears, to some extent, that Dunn mimiced this and took the liberty to have some fun with his anthropoligical analysis of the metal community.  Although critics would point to Mayhem and comment about the destructive nature of heavy metal, Dunn simply notes something about how beer and interviews don't mix.  Rock on.  I think metal fans will enjoy this DVD (I caught myself headbanging on my couch); also, those unfamiliar with the genre will likely find the film to be educational and enlightening.  Pick up the DVD and check out some books on metal (by deena weinstein, ian christe, etc).

Oh yeh, before I forget, some memorable points were when the tour manager said ""some people wake up and have to have coffee. I wake up and have to play slayer.""

2517772,3,B000EGEJIY,"Ronnie James Dio has a minor obsession with Gene Simmons. This is just one of the revelations contained in METAL: A HEADBANGER'S JOURNEY. This documentary from Sam Dunn, Scot McFadyen, and Jessica Joy Wise posits itself as an anthropological study of Heavy Metal culture and its perceptions. Narrated and starring Dunn, the film traces the roots of Metal (Black Sabbath) and explores several of the modern subgenres (Cannibal Corpse). Dunn travels far and wide to interview idols, stars, and various ""expert voices"" to provide an interesting, albeit cursory, look at Metal and its various incarnations.

With scraggly hair, ratty goatee, and immense collection of band t-shirts, Dunn is anything but a novice on the subject. It's a bit like N!xau hosting a documentary on the bushmen of the Kalahari. Dunn positively fawns over some of the folks he interviews (especially Iron Maiden's Bruce Dickenson, yes, thee Bruce Dickinson) but does a solid job with the rest of his subjects and helped immensely by eloquent rockers such as Dee Snyder and Rob Zombie. The film is loosely divided into subsections, any of which could have been a full length documentary in and of themselves, especially the chapter on Norwegian ""Black Metal"" artists and their love of burning down churches. I was particularly fascinated by the portrayals and perceptions of masculinity among metal mavens from the ubermasculine to the ultrafemme.

You can definitely tell that this is a Canadian film as no one else would consider having Geddy Lee in a documentary about Metal. The film may not be the most comprehensive journey one could take into this world but it's definitely a fun one!",1149292800,3,1662,5.084249084249084

2517774,5,B000EGEJIY,"I'll keep my review fairly brief. This movie is very well done and is a comprehensive look at the heavy metal genre. Though it does go into a brief history of heavy metal, that is not the focus of the film. The film is meant to show people that there's more to heavy metal then the stereotypes that have been given to the genre. If you watch the mini-documentry on the Norweigian Black Metal scene featured on the second disc, you see that a lot of people complained about the length of the original film. In all honesty, if this was the history of heavy metal, then i'd agree that they could've done A LOT more since they really only scratched the surface when it came to the history (I personally wished they did a lot more with the thrash metal movement as well as make mention of more modern metal bands) BUT since the focus of the film is to debunk stereotypes and explain the genre in general, I felt that the goal was executed in the time presented.

Overall, I highly recommend this to fans of the genre as well as to those may not be fans of the genre, but wish to at least understand it a bit more.",1148601600,5,1108,4.226415094339623
