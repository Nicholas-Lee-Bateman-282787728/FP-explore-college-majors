7938509,5,B00005J779,"First make sure you realize this dvd is highlights, NOT the full televised tournament. Once you are mentally prepared for what your buying, you cant beat this series, the tournament is told like a soft historic story but it lets you enjoy the shots of the legends , the features were fun as well, Press confrence, the opening and closing ceremonies.

2001 tournament itself. An amazing contest between the then worlds greats. who wouldnt want to see the No. 1 and No. 2 player go toe to toe for the green jacket at the worlds best course.",1399766400,,538,4.546391752577319
7938510,2,B00005J779,"More like a promotional video for Augusta National and golf history than a tournament golf recap featuring tiger woods ""playing golf"". I've had several of these types of videos and they are nothing like watching the modern live broadcast of a major golf tournament. I love watching pros playing golf but these types of videos are more promotional video style than anything else. It's better than nothing and does show Tiger in his prime at that time. Steel shafts and real ""woods"". For that reason it's worth watching. But that's all.",1384646400,,534,4.8791208791208796
7938511,4,B00005J779,"I purchased this DVD because I actually missed the last six holes of the Sunday round of this tournament and I had to see how it concluded.  If you're interested in finding out exactly what's on highlight DVDs like this, the Golf Channel periodically airs ""classics"" with footage taken straight from these DVDs.

So how does this DVD stack up?  While the footage is taken from TV coverage, you rarely hear actual live television commentary since a new narration is used.  You shouldn't expect the same sort of dramatic tension that you might experience watching an exciting golf tournament live (I mean, the identity of the champion is given away on the cover of the DVD case...), but you can expect to find a well made selection of important and great shots from the tournament.

The coverage of the tournament begins with a quick review of the Par 3 Tournament and the honorary starters on Thursday morning, and then begins with the tournament proper.  The first three rounds are covered rather quickly, so you will only find brief highlights, but there are abridged clips of interviews with various players and summaries of the leaderboard after each of the first three rounds that will give you an idea of the road to the final round.  The coverage of the final round is more thorough, especially on the last few holes.

This DVD should be thought of as a historical record summarizing the 2001 Masters.  My only complaint is that the main feature is too short - there definitely could have been more footage, even from the last day, of one of the most important professional golf tournaments of the modern era.",1244332800,,1615,4.739285714285714
7938512,4,B00005J779,"I thought the coverage of the tourney was great and the full post interview was interesting, would've like some more players thoughts I guess though.  However, the picture quality is fairly poor even by DVD standards.  When the ball is a square, literally, on the screen during a putt you know the resolution is bad.  Besides the annoyingly bad picture, it great to watch Tiger win his fourth straight major.",1204934400,,408,4.8
7938513,4,B00005J779,I enjoy the Masters series.  Love the theme music too.  Tiger won!,1034035200,,66,4.416666666666667
7938514,4,B00005J779,"I like having sporting events on DVD vs. VHS.  Quality of this one is good.  Don't expect too many 'extra' features.  If you want a good recap of the 2001 Masters, this will do.  The post tournament conference with Tiger is pretty interesting too to watch.",1004659200,,256,4.5
7938515,5,B00005J779,"I have every Masters highlights tape since 1990. Each one of them  is excellent, and the quality of the production unmatched. And as always, the action from the Masters never disappoints.",993427200,2,187,5.032258064516129
7938516,5,B00005J779,"I have seen this video and I thought that it was really great. I forgot to tape the Masters and next to the live thing, it is the best. It shows great shots.",989020800,,157,3.787878787878788
