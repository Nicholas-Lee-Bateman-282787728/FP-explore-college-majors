8155544,4,B000KBJ3WK,"Impressive and horrifying at the same time. A stark reminder of what the Treaty of Versailles produced in Germany less than 20 years later. This appears to be a Leni Riefensthal production as it compares well with her earlier ""Triumph of the Will"" work on the 1933 Nuremberg Nazi party congress, but this time things are much more militaristic. Actually a superb bit of propaganda which when viewed by the French and British governments likely encouraged appeasement as the heavy-handed enthusiasm of all the participants makes for a scary viewing experience. Germany appears ready for war. The overall film quality is not as good as it should be - given the high quality of German optics and film at the time I expected better, which cost it a star. Nevertheless, if you want to see what the citizens of the world saw of Germany in the mid-1930s, this is a good example. Propaganda, but very effective. Makes an interesting comparison with films of the Soviet May Day parades in Red Square during the same time period.",1513641600,,1019,4.795454545454546
