4124079,5,B003H8F2WI,"The plot? The family of a deceased author refuses to give a biographer authorization to write the author's biography. The biographer travels to Uruguay to try to persuade the family.

This movie deserves five stars because its characters are well developed and because everything was original, in a pleasing way. Or if it was not absolutely original, it at least avoided triteness. For example Omar, who appears to be the main character, turns out to be the least attractive character. But you need to be a discerning judge of character to recognize his faults, or indeed to recognize that he has faults. If you are not careful, you may find yourself thinking he is a typical protagonist, one of the good guys.

Other examples of the movie's avoidance of triteness: no violence, no guns, no spies, no car-chase sequences, no superheroes, no aliens, etc. Only one scene might be called an action sequence, and even it is humble in that respect. Nevertheless, from beginning to end the movie is interesting. The location of the story--Uruguay--is fresh. The cowboys (gauchos?) are different from American cowboys. Even the color of the alcoholic beverage is new, a cherry red.

The cinematography and sound are excellent. The acting seems perfect, though in this regard I am not a perfectionist.

Though I gave you a synopsis of the plot, the story is all about character. Who is right? Who is wrong? Who does the right thing? Who does the wrong thing? Who deserves whom, and who does not deserve whom? Go ahead and ignore the old dictum, ""Judge not, or you will be judged."" Tear these characters to pieces, and I do not mean the actors and actresses, I mean the characters. Or commend them. Judge them! If you can do that, the movie should earn your appreciation.",1294185600,2,1762,4.805280528052806
4124080,2,B003H8F2WI,"A waste of 117 minutes

A self absorbed work of monumental disinterest.

Omar Metwally is just not likeable. Why the women in this movie have any interest in this milksop is beyond me.

I kept looking for some kind of climax to the never ending psycho-babble and finally found it in Omar's splay footed run to his lover's arms. You'll have to wait till the 116th minute but it is a hoot.",1290988800,3,387,4.347222222222222
4124081,3,B003H8F2WI,"Positives:
Interesting concept of how much is the public allowed to know more about the life of, and lives surrounding, a public figure. To what extent does a biographer be permitted to pursue that story.
Excellent location filming; good sets; adequate and at times quite good acting; mostly good script in showing the characters' personalities.

Negatives:
Did not pursue the potential philosophical discussions of the rights of privacy vs. the public interest with any depth and meaning.
A lot of pointless and distracting scenes such as the bathing suit scene; manuscript burning and many more.
The final half hour or so just seemed weak; poorly edited and rushed.",1287014400,,667,5.175925925925926

4124083,5,B003H8F2WI,"I won't go into the plot and the faithfulness with which it treats with the details of the book from which it is derived. I have not read the book.

James Ivory does not disappoint. This is a movie which struck so many chords with me. Having visited Buenos Aires and other parts of Argentina a few years ago, I identified with the sense of elegance which the film telegraphed both in terms of the gorgeous scenery and the people that it depicted.  I recall walking in Recoleta and seeing middle aged very well kept women sporting their furs with a casualness which had long been abandoned in cities like New York years ago, in response to the vociferous anti-fur lobby. But then and there I thought Buenos Aires seemed stuck in a time warp slightly out of touch with a reality that the rest of the world had long since embraced.  So too in this movie. Here was a group of people tolerating each other and existing in a world not sustainable anywhere else or in any other context.  The author seeking his approval for execution of his precious biography of a deceased author, had a girl friend, Deirdre, who was almost literally disparaged for being too much of the real world and out of sync with the artifice of the gracious but dated Ocho Rios estate and its well-heeled inhabitants. But it was the navigation of that world with language and costuming that was so elegant and measured, that sets this film and its great cast led by Sir Anthony Hopkins, Laura Linney, Omar Metwally, Charlotte Gainsbourg and Hiroyuki Sanada, apart from the ordinary and the mundane.

This film despite being an ode to an upper class existence that most of us will never experience, confers credibility on it and makes us ordinary folk very much interested in how this all turns out for these sorry bunch of misfits bent on validating each other's existence in this finely wrought but fragile world.",1283212800,17,1882,4.622754491017964
4124084,2,B003H8F2WI,"This film is based on a novel by Peter Cameron. I have not read this book, and it seems to me that reading it is a prerequisite to understanding much of the movie, particularly the jumbled conclusion. A young American college professor, Omar Razaghi (Omar Metwally) is under pressure to finish his thesis in order to keep his job. He wants to write a biography of an author, Jules Gund, who committed suicide because he could not finish another novel after his one great success. Gund lived on a huge family ranch, apparently first settled by his parents, in Uruguay, five thousand miles away from Omar's college. Although the ranch is most impressive, it's been a long time since that novel's success and money is tight.

Omar wants to get the authorization of the late author's family before writing the biography. Three people control Jules's estate: his widow, his older brother(Anthony Hopkins), and his mistress. Omar's pushy girlfriend pushes Omar to go to Uruguay to get the coveted approval, even though he has received a letter from Uruguay indicating that the family is not willing to grant authorization. Incredibly, he just shows up at the remote ranch uninvited. He has never met anyone there.

Most of the above surfaces in the first scenes of the film. The film quickly proceeds to flounder. I soon found myself not caring about Omar or his Gund project. This film has some of the blandest acting that I have ever seen. I could imagine director James Ivory telling the actors things like, ""Could you tone that down a bit? A little more subdued, please."" Laura Linney, however, does add some heat to the mix in her portrayal of the widow, particularly early on. Hopkins has had a long and distinguished career, but his is a tepid role in this film, and his performance is not inspiring.

I suppose the scenery is pretty nice. There are some undeveloped but interesting references to the Gund family's German roots. There is an atmosphere of genteel decay. Some remarkably dull jewels. We learn a little about bee stings. There's a gondola imported all the way from Venice. Omar gets stuck in quicksand (or is it just mud?). He dashes about in the rain. . .",1283212800,4,2171,4.753315649867374
4124085,5,B003H8F2WI,"Peter Cameron's elegant, wistful novel THE CITY OF YOUR FINAL DESTINATION has been well transitioned to the screen by Ruth Prawer Jhabvala and director James Ivory: in so many ways this film brings a host of fond memories of all of the films made by the members of Merchant Ivory films. It has the same sense of grace of transporting one culture into another, of examining interpersonal relationships as they are tied to etiquette and tradition and family, and the chances we take in the name of self-fulfillment and love.  It is a mood piece and a delectable offering for the brain.

Omar Razaghi (Omar Metwally) is a postgraduate student and instructor at a Colorado College, living in a tenuous relationship with Deirdre (Alexandra Maria Lara), and delaying his desire to write his PhD thesis -a proposed biography of deceased novelist Jules Gund. He is unhappy with his life, frustrated that his thesis committee will not approve of his dissertation unless he has the family of Jules Gund's permission to write the biography. After a little nudge from a colleague he decides to travel to Uruguay - without Deirdre - to gain permission from the Gund family to proceed.  Deirdre, hurt because Omar wants to go without her, insists that Omar travel to Uruguay: this may his only chance to step out of the life whose rut he is in and move on to higher means.

Omar journeys to Uruguay where he meets the Gund 'family' - Gund's gay brother, Adam (Anthony Hopkins) and his lover of 25 years  Pete (Hiroyuki Sanada); former wife Caroline (Laura Linney); and Arden (Charlotte Gainsbourg), Gund's mistress and mother of Gund's daughter, Portia.  Though greeted with hospitality it is clear that the family, as executors of Gund's estate, refuse to give Omar permission.  Omar is invited to live with the Gund's  until he can make arrangements to return to the US, but the visit is extended, allowing for changes to insert in the family unity as each one slowly agrees to allow Omar to write the biography.  Omar has a fall, is recovered by Arden (Deirdre flies to Uruguay for support but senses the change in Omar's feelings with Arden),  and  during his recovery Omar awakens to what he really wants in life - love, beauty, and the freedom to express himself in all matters.

In the manner of fine story telling, there are excellent moments of passion, and comedy, and a fine dissection of family life in all its permutations.  The cast is uniformly excellent, composed of such a stellar group of actors.  This is a quiet adagio of a film, filled with charm, elegant cinematography by Javier Aguirresarobe, and fine music - both from the classics and from contemporary writing by Jorge Drexler.  This film retains the 'Merchant Ivory': and that says enough!  Grady Harp, August 10",1282694400,33,2776,4.812631578947369

This movie does have many different layers to it.

I had never heard of this movie before so I am very glad that I found it. The human interaction in this film is intriguing.  For my liking, Hopkins could have gotten a little more screen time, but some of my favorite movies of his, he has very little screen time. A perfect example is Silence of the Lambs where he has very little screen time.

Blandullo delivered a fine performance as Omar.

I do recommend this movie.

My reviews are my opinions of the movies I have watched and just my opinion. Everyone is different and could have a different opinion of a movie. How boring would life be if everyone had the same opinion of every movie?

4124211,3,B003H8F2WI,"Doctoral student Omar Razaghi is set to write a biography of Latin American literary luminary Jules Gund, who died in an apparent suicide. He needs permission from his brother and his widow. So off to Uruguay, to meet the family. This group is quirky and living in a little isolated colony, a hermetic environment where they all stew in their own juices about their relationship to each other and the departed Jules. The group includes his brother, the brother's lover of 25 years, Pete, his widow (played admirably by Laura Linney) and Jules' young mistress and their daughter Portia. Omar must get approval from all three brother, widow, and mistress or the biography will not be authorized. Pushing him all the way is his ambitious girlfriend Dierdre. When Omar falls out of a tree and is stung by some bees and ends up in hospital, the mission takes a left-hand turn. Suddenly, it's not about Jules Gund, but about each person and their innermost desires.

The script is from Peter Cameron's novel and is very good. The acting is of course, top notch with such a cast. This isn't a major story but it makes for a good 2 hours of entertainment and the soundtrack has some beautiful music, including the overture from Bastien and Bastienne, a rare operetta by Mozart.",1378166400,3,1269,4.742081447963801
4124212,5,B003H8F2WI,"My wife and I absolutely love the rich textures, relaxed pace, and solidly unique character personalities in the movie.  The script is well adapted, intelligent, insightful in its clarity and simplicity.  Even the subtitles are beautifully scribed.  For example, in one scene you read ""horse clopping,"" pause, ""cows lowing,"" pause, ""horse whinnies,"" pause, ""brakes screeching,"" pause, ""door squeaking,"" drawing your attention to barely audible sounds you may miss merely watching the movement of the characters through a scene.  We often watch movies with the subtitles onscreen, finding that good ones actually add to the experience of the film, helping overcome and balance personal viewing prejudices.

Make no mistake the movie is very slow paced, which I actually find appealing. The characters are all expressed with an almost whisper-like quality, as if to keep their world private and secret.  If you enjoy a relationship movie that has a location or scenery based flavor to it, movies like The American, The River Why, Lantana, and The Shipping News, you'll enjoy The City of Your Final Destination.",1373068800,7,1108,5.339080459770115

In this movie, she seems to be at ease, though she had previously been under great stress, and tells the story of it with good effect (like saying ""Where would I go?"" with this acute pain that says 'nowhere, of course' where she doesn't actually say that, and doesn't have to).

Now Omar Razaghi (Omar Metwally) wants to write his biography. He writes to the executors of his estate, but they refuse their permission. Omar's ambitious girlfriend pressures him into going to Uruguay to talk them into changing their minds.

Gund's brother Adam (Anthony Hopkins) is in favor of the project, as much because it might raise interest in ""The Gondola"" and they'd make money. They need money. Gund's widow Caroline (Laura Linney) is dead set against it. The third executor is Arden Langdon (Charlotte Gainsbourg), Gund's mistress and the mother of his daughter Portia. She is against it at first, mostly because Caroline is, but eventually comes around.

They all live together on the vast estate that the Gunds inherited from their parents. Adam's lover, Pete, is the manager of the estate and has been pestering Adam to let him make the land profitable. He has plenty of good ideas, but some cash will be needed to make any of it work. So Pete, of course, is with Adam in being in favor of the biography.

4124224,4,B003H8F2WI,"There's not much action in this film. It has the feel of a staged production, which isn't necessarily bad. It opens its paneled door and invites you in as a guest at the presumably Uruguayan estate of a deceased author who was a Salinger-like recluse known for the one major book he produced. His wife, his mistress, his brother, and the brother's partner, continue to live on together in their South American Garden of Eden retreat. (How such a large estate can be maintained with so little hired help remains one of the few mysteries of the plot.)

There are some tensions between these people who sometimes seem to exist as out-take chapters from the great man's writings. There is an undercurrent of residual jealousy between the man's lawful wife and his mistress. Some additional disagreement is triggered by the intrusion on the estate of an aspiring young American writer intent on writing the biography of his author-hero. Then a bit more potential bitterness is added to the olio when the young writer's girlfriend arrives from the States to tend to him in the wake of an accident he's suffered - and to derail any budding romance he might be entertaining.

These differences don't generally come to a boil though, or even a simmer. For the most part, the characters remain marinating in their own privileged lives of civilized comfort. Since this is a James Ivory production (the remaining member of the famed Ivory-Merchant team), you know the setting will necessarily be a civilized one.

This movie tries to make a gondola that's housed in an out-building on the estate into a central character. The gondola was imported, at great risk and expense, from Europe by the author's parents. They rescued it as part of their attempt to rescue themselves from the Nazi onslaught in Europe. But the repeatedly invoked image of the gondola in this film sort of falls flat. The script was based on a novel by Peter Cameron, and I sense that the gondola might have been a more integral symbol in the book - a symbol of displacement - a symbol of withdrawal from ordinary use and usefulness - a symbol of risk and removal in order to maintain some sane sense of continuity. But all these possible meanings for the gondola get a bit lost in the necessarily brief 2-hour format of a film. Here the gondola itself comes off more as an intruder in the film - and worse yet, an irrelevancy.

Nevertheless, as a whole, this is a worthwhile watch. The actress Charlotte Gainsbourg is memorable and appealing as the author's gamine mistress. Anthony Hopkins lends his usual note of classicism to his role.

Maybe not much happens in the course of this film. But it will probably linger with you, putting you in a mood of calmer hopefulness that some people, somewhere, might yet prove to be civilized.",1298419200,3,2795,4.742798353909465
4124225,4,B003H8F2WI,"I am immensely pleased to have found this film. Many of the performances (Anthony Hopkins, Hiroyuki Sanada, Alexandra Lara, and Laura Linney) were inspired but some (Charlotte Gainsburg) were not. The story is engaging but there were many aspects of the plot that did not make real practical or emotional sense.  The motion of the plot is a bit formulaic. The story drew me in in spite of the gaps, however. The cinematography is lush and beautiful.  I particularly liked the warmth of the relationshiop between Hopkins' and Sanada's characters and the coldness at the heart of both Linney's and Lara's portrayal of their characters. When all is said and done, as E.M. Forster said: ""only connect.""",1294617600,3,698,4.957264957264957

8396829,4,B003H8F2WI,"This is one of those movies that's like a big slice of pie, scooped onto your plate for you to enjoy without wondering what was on either side of it.  It gives just enough story as a basis to drop you into a segment of someone else's life.  You see really nothing of what went on before, or what comes after.  You merely see one slice of pie.  And it tastes good.  That's all I ask when I'm served.

I'm often reminded of a quote from Hartley upon viewing films such as this: ""The past is a foreign country; they do things differently there.""  But instead of ""past"", I put ""the lives of others.""  This is one of those films, which presents a situation of characters that are foreign to me.  They don't think like I do; they don't live like I do.  But here and there peeks out a sentiment, or longing, that I have felt, that I can understand.  And I always think this is the best achievement of these kind of films: to present people so completely different from yourself, yet managing to find a string or two to tether you to them.  It isolates the things people have in common, from the kaleidoscopic clutter we surround ourselves with.

The basic plot is merely a ""MacGuffin"" in Hitchcock terms.  Merely the pretense upon which to hang a story.  A guy wants to write the biography of a deceased author, and travels to Uruguay to get the consent of the trustees of his estate: his brother, his widow, and his mistress.  Then it's virtually nothing but his interactions with them and their world.  Chance circumstances can alter the course of our lives.  In fact, when you're just drifting, it takes the introduction of chance to alter them.  You begin to ponder the idea that one's life is guided by nothing more than a set of chance happenings, be they cataclysmic, or merely gentle nudges.

I liked this film.  It has pretty settings and photography; the acting leaves nothing to be desired; and all else is wonderfully done.  It's a slow film, one which many would consider boring.  One has to definitely like this type of film to enjoy it.",1525564800,,2044,4.450134770889488

8396837,4,B003H8F2WI,"Seeing another pairing of Anthony Hopkins and James Ivory, I certainly could not pass this one up, and I'm glad I didn't.  Omar Metwally is excellent, as are all the actors.  The characters are well-layered with the exception of the monotonously controlling girlfriend, but there's enough richness in the other characters to provide counter-balance  What this film does its best at displaying is the fracturing of personalities and relationships -- one person knows you as this; another knows you as that; and still another knows you differently from the others -- it takes many people to put together the puzzle of a human life; and their own struggles impact how they see you so that they may not know you as well as they think they do via their tainted view of their own lives and the world.  I noticed some reviewers complained about the pace or that the film doesn't make sense.  Let's just say that if you're familiar with Ivory or Merchant-Ivory productions, you will not go into this expecting explosions, car crashes, lots of skin or profanity.  Ivory's genre has always been character studies and human interaction; and he is a master of his genre.  So if you favor typical American commercial films, you probably will not enjoy this.  Not everything will be tied up with a neat bow at the end, and it is up to you to work out what is in the box.  While this is not my favorite Ivory film, it did not disappoint.",1489276800,7,1422,4.633466135458168
