6797753,1,B00PCSVMCK,"The other reviewer had it quite right - this is a disastrous microbudget train wreck. As noted, just because one can operate a camera doesn't mean one should. The CGI is laughable to the point that I initally thought this was a comedy. The five-star review was noble in it's defense of her friends on the filmmaking team, but ultimately does a disservice to anyone who paid money to rent this sub-SyFy Channel video. I rented this on Comcast awhile back and had all but forgotten it until I was rudely reminded by another reviewer that I should offer my viewing experience to other potential viewers so that they might avoid this video. I do vividly remember scenes in which I could barely hear the dialogue over the background music. Wait to catch it on Netflix or Amazon Prime...or not.",1424131200,11,788,4.635714285714286

A scientist is hired by the government to create android fighting machines to combat rebel forces. When the android is to be destroyed, it goes on a killing spree.

Years later, the android project is again attempted by the same scientist who creates the android in the image of his dead wife. The rebels capture the android and reprogram it to think for itself and to have feelings.

This is one of Chris R. Notarile's best films. The cinematography, editing, effects and locations are so thought out and the storyline, while not unique, is a cohesive, different take on a familiar theme. All of this done on a very small $17,000 budget.

As for the acting, Notarile has managed to assemble the best of his troop of actors and they really deliver. Samantha Talbott plays LIA both in life and as an android flawlessly. Kasey Williams, Hector De La Rosa and Dana Jesberger shine in their roles as the leaders of the rebels, while Rick Zahn and Mark Hawk make their characters appropriately unlikeable. But it's Roberto Lombardi, as Dr. Peter Hess, who carries this film. He alternates between a mad scientist with a hatred for the rebels and a tortured man who mourns LIA. The scene where she dies is one of the best and Lombardi's emotional performance sets the stage for what comes next.

Don't believe the trolls, haters and self appointed expert cinephiles. See movies and make up your own mind.

1) Other than there being androids in this film, it is nothing like The Terminator.

2) There are no fake reviews. Mine and the other positive reviews are from fans. The other reviewer published his review.

3) Anyone who thinks their opinion should be regaled as fact has a serious ego problem.

You'll notice the bad reviews never give any specific examples. They just use their review as an excuse to insult people. How disrespectful and juvenile.",1424131200,7,1872,4.7708978328173375
6797755,3,B00PCSVMCK,"The questions that Artificial Intelligence brings about are as potent today as they were in the days of Karel apek and William Gibson. Does artificial intelligence, in essence, equate to being alive? Could artificial intelligence lead to artificial emotion or artificial ideology? If artificial intelligence is severed, is it considered murder any more so as abortion?
 Were it to grow exponentially through education as human intelligence does, could it become so self-aware that it turns against us with deadly force in the name of its own superiority?
 These questions, along with fertile narrative, scientific and visual potential, paint a tempting backdrop for those choosing to venture into the realms of Science Fiction.
  Just ask Chris R. Notarile.
  His 2013 film Perfect: Android Rising (retitled ""Battledroid"" here) is the independent writer/directors third feature film and it proudly shows. Hes learning, consistentlyand thats a good thing.
 Following an extended prologue set a decade prior, the year is 2059. Retcon Labs Chief of Staff Dr. Peter Hess (Roberto Lombardi) has been called forth to create a solution to the problem of rebel resistance fighters (Kasey Williams, Hector De La Rosa and Dana Jesberger) who have chosen to wage urban warfare against the Republic of America, which has replaced the former democracy of our nation with a vicious near-dictatorship made dangerous by manipulated perceptions (more on that later).
 His answer is built in the form of LIA (Samantha Talbott), a self-sufficient android warrior capable of wiping out the resistance. Under the command of General Arken (Rick Zahn), shes sent in to neutralize the rebel threat and maintain the Republics interests of absolute domination.
 But when an unexpected circumstance severs LIAs programming, the resistance embarks on a race against time to learn more about her operations in an effort to gain an advantage and finally turn the tides of war in their favor.
 Perfect: Android Rising is a mindful cautionary tale under disguise as a brisk, efficient tech-savvy actioner, as is the case with most suitable Science Fiction. The action scenes move with momentum, the cast makes the film even more memorable than it might have been without these specific actors and the writing is among the most solid Notarile has provided to date save for his incredible work on the short-lived and notoriously dismantled Deadpool web series.
 One of the more peculiar and fascinating elements of the film is that it portrays a unique dystopian future where civilization has not been compromised as a result of cybernetic progress. Androids may be more prevalent, but humans are still flipping the switches and pulling the strings of the world.
  Puppet Masters and the games they play.
 This brings about the films central themes of control and individuality amidst a world of conformity and suppression.
 Obviously we have the concept in its broadest example with LIA being put under the control of her government handlers, monitoring her from a distance like flesh and bone Gods unwilling to put blood on their own hands.
 The lines between good and evil are skewed as the road the film travels is one paved with noble intentions that yield varying results. Hess is not a purely malicious individual, demonstrated by the heart it takes to create LIA in his wifes image. The Tracker is merely a follower of orders. Even the team of resistance fighters eventually breaks the barriers of protagonist and antagonist as every main character winds up shedding the conventional labels of good and evil to become the same thing.
 Human.
 LIA undergoes this character arc in the literal sense. But in their own way, every other character follows suit. They abandon the titles that genre fiction would bequeath them and come out at the end as human beings. No more, no less.
 And as humans, we don't concern ourselves with such designations. We don't go forth in the world to purposefully commit evil or lead by the example of good. There are no Heroes and Villains. There are only our own individual intentions, our own personal agendasthe results and consequences of which we can neither foresee nor control. It is those results that determine and designate good and evil in hindsight and retrospect. Hess work is done so with the hope of putting an end to war, never bothering to consider the impact his choices can make.
 Remember this night the next time you play God.
 While his creations commit atrocity, should he be held responsible if his agenda was altruistic in the first place? To create LIA to bear the resemblance of his wife says what about his character? That despite what monetary or professional gains he could make in the concept of building a piece of equipment for military use, theres a crucial piece of him that made this decision from more intimate, vulnerable place.
 LIA couldve looked like anyone. But he chose her for a reason. And that reason is a sympathetic one.
 How could he be so evil then if he behaves this way psychologically, clinging onto his love the only way he knows how?
 The moment that supports this is the end of the film itself, where LIA questions Hess about this very idea.
 For all his tech-based bravado in presenting LIA to the President earlier, Hess is reduced to a primal humanalmost an infant in his dependency. His last words, quite poetically, are I don't understand.
 Hess has transformed into the personification of man. And in this future world, where technology has grown exponential and sentient, transference has occurred. Machine has become the parental authority and Man has become the simpleton child.
 All LIA can do with this newfound authority is embrace and comfort Man in assurance.
 On the flip side, it can be equally argued that another thematic thread depicted here is the idea that even in a world populated with machines made in mans image, man itself might be the most dangerous machine of all. This idea is clearly portrayed by the character of the films one true villain, General Arken.
 While human personality comes with the territory of the grizzled combat vet, Arkens exchanges and goals through the film are nearly robotic in their own perverted way. He sees LIA not as a potential vessel for enlightenment or understanding but as another soldier.
 Human soldiers are the Androids of our age. Theyre dressed to type, packed into sardine cans and shot off to the thick of a hell we cant imagine, all so they can pile on top of one another as corpses dropped in the name of freedom and providence. Were it up to Arken, hed be more than happy to have an assembly line of LIAS, fully functional and fully disposable, like a constant unstoppable typhoon that wouldnt give until the enemy was eradicated.
 By the end, hes more of a robot than LIA, barking orders as if hes reading from a scriptor, more accurately, as if HE were the one downloaded with commands to follow blindly.
 The technical constructs of the film are handled with a delicate but firm hand, tempered by experience while simultaneously mastered through circumstance. The definition of a low (meaning no) budget filmmaker, Notarile has refined guerrilla filmmaking down to a veritable science that works for the kind of stories hes most interested in telling. His work is quick and dirty, getting the job done with just the right touch of panache and attitude, particularly in his writing.
 Theres a snap to his dialogue that a lot of independent, amateur or web-based filmmakers don't quite seem to nail. Even if a given story might take turns towards the predictable or contrived, Notarile masks that effectively with a rhythm and tempo in the dialogue that seems to stem from his roots as a Jersey boy raised in the high-octane pace of both Jersey and New York. Theres a definite punchy, impatient, bad mofo attitude that flows through those burgs and Notarile keeps his finger on the pulse effortlessly.
 Notarile also plays around with some tongue-in-cheek jabs at contemporary society (a blink-and-youll-miss-it headline declares a lead in the murder of infamously ridiculed Twilight actress Kristen Stewart) and criticisms of current American Science Fiction films (most notably Avatar).
 Given the morally ambiguous state of the films landscape, the cinematography of Perfect is virtually white-washed into neutral tones. Vibrancy of color is abandoned, giving way to a visual cue of the neutrality populating the narrative. Nothing is black and white but grey and uncertain. The camera is also used to great effect. Knowing his proficiency for handheld realism, Notarile fits right at home amongst the rubble of his future world, giving the film a power and kineticism that it benefits from. At some point, given more money or more time or (most likely) both, it would be nice to see Chris change things up somewhere and rise to the challenge of operating stabilizing equipment. In the go, go, go style of guerrilla, I get that its not practical. Nevertheless, I yearn for the day when Notariles eye gets to play around in the sandbox with Dolly tracks and Crane Arms.
 The visual effects are a step up from earlier efforts like the short film Android, which, funny enough, is revisited and expanded upon as part of the films opening with the earlier Genesis model android (portrayed with cool calculation by the director himself). Standouts include the polarity force field surrounding Genesis during his incarceration. The depth of field with the flowing particles is spectacular and the combination of effects and lighting nails the visual tone of that scene and what it represents with the actual discussion between Genesis and Dr. Cole. There are also a great number of blood gags and splatters that are very graphic novel in nature and immensely effective as a result.
 The films score, composed by Elliot Butay, is some of the best orchestral material in a work of Notariles. I especially enjoyed the tempered synthetic strings of the main titles and the various balances between somber orchestral movements and synthesized tech-beats, acting as a musical counterpoint to the conflict in the film.
 The cast is a pantheon of Blinky Productions alumni, some of which Ive come to know as friends and acquaintances via social media.
 What can I really say about Roberto Lombardi? When he nails it, he nails it and the best part is that he always does. To date I think Hess is the most developed character Notarile has written for him and he runs with the material, taking it to a place of relatable humanity and genuine depth. The flashback scene between he and Samantha that sets up their relationship in playing chess feels authentically natural. Couple that with the double-take realization that he was daydreaming while now playing chess with LIA, a great transition narratively, and it illustrates a real man rather than a genre stereotype of the eccentric doctor. Lombardi makes it more than that, more than what a lesser actor wouldve done. Hes given top billing by the End Credits and for good reason.
 The 2nd standout for me was easily Rick Zahn as General Arken. Beyond the Kubrick fanboying of hearing someone utter the phrase in the shit (first heard by my ears in 1987s Full Metal Jacket), Zahn has personality to spare as the General. He plays more to type but, as I said, his character needed to in order to fulfill that thematic intent. Between Notariles dialogue for the character and Zahns no-nonsense delivery of it, the character is made quite memorable, even more so than I anticipated.
 The remainder of the cast is all strong, so don't misunderstand that Im singling out those two first. They just happened to be my favorite performances and the performances more than speak for themselves.
 Samantha accomplishes quite a task in portraying LIA primarily (her personality shines as Hess wife and again, that flashback scene really shows how natural and light hearted she can be, which goes a long way). From Lance Henriksen to Peter Weller to Schwarzenegger himself, weve seen cyborg characters before. What Samantha brings to it, I think, is an effortless grace. Shes not overtly feminine as a robot and yet theres a tenderness there that makes her interesting to look at and follow, to see what she may or may not do.
 The other female leads are quite formidable with Kasey Williams as Cass and Dana Jesberger as Avis. Williams definitely brings her inner Linda Hamilton to the party (Notarile has a tendency to do that with his strong female characters doesnt he?) and she definitely has the edge necessary to give Cass the authority she needs as a character. Avis is played with a real street-urchin vibe and Jesberger works well in bringing that social angle to the urban backdrop.
 Both Shawn Parr and Hector De La Rosa bring the testosterone levels to the party with gusto, having a ball as bonafide action stars in their own right. Both men could easily lead in action vehicles (as Notarile has already demonstrated with Parr as the Punisher and De La Rosa as Snake Plissken in earlier fan-made pieces). They each have a gravitas and presence thats unmistakable. Where Parr plays well in the stealthy, silent bringer of death angle, De La Rosa is a grassroots everyman. Both the roles of the Tracker and Brooks respectively make great strides in fulfilling these duties.
 I also really enjoyed the quirky personality of both Nick Grock as goofy, easy going yet savvy Wyatt and Andrew Roth as bumbling, neurotic programmer Jensen. Notariles response to Im a Mac (Wyatt) and Im a PC (Jensen) perhaps? Certainly could be seen that way.
 All in all, Perfect: Android Rising is a seminal work for Chris and the gang. They really pulled out all the stops even more so than on either Methodic or Stand Off and, to date, this is easily my favorite feature of theirs.
 If this is an indication of the trajectory these talented filmmakers, artists and actors are moving along, then I think the best is even yet to come. Blinky Productions supporters are in for something tremendously well-crafted here and that can only mean that the future of Notariles work, unlike the one depicted here, is looking quite bright indeed.",1416700800,9,14183,4.94741270509045
6797756,1,B00PCSVMCK,"This is a very low budget film. It takes place 40 years into a future that hasn't advanced in anything other than making androids. There are a group of rebels who what to return America to freedom, although the film never shows you exactly where people aren't free.

Genesis (Chris R. Notarile) is an android who speaks with a cheap voice enhancer normally used for demons. He is built to go after the resistance, but went amok and had to be put on ice in a top secret location at the 77 Hudson St. Public Parking Garage in Jersey City. He escapes, does one more job and then it is 10 years later (cars still look like they are from our era) and he has fallen off the plot.

Another android is made (Samantha Talbott) to take its place. This one is the perfect fighting machine too. ...sorry it hurts to go on. The film oozes with laughable writing.

Just because you watch the SyFy channel and go to Comic-Con doesn't mean you should be making movies when your mommy gets you a camera for graduating the ninth grade. Not worth a free look.
