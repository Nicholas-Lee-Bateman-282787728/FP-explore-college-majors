8194007,5,B000Q1K4KE,"08/15 is the German equivalent of American GI epithet ""SNAFU"" and the title of this 1950's West German anti-war series (also the name of a WWI ubiquitous machine gun). The trilogy takes a young soldier from pre-war to post WWII, and is part of the catharsis Germans went through to process their role in the war. Well-detailed and entertaining, it is NOT the equivalent of something like ""Band of Brothers,"" of ""The Pacific,"" rather a period piece starring many veterans, employing the film technology of the day. Highly recommend these movies, as well as ""Dogs, Do You Want to Live Forever?"" a similar movie about Stalingrad.",1332720000,,626,4.915094339622642
8194008,5,B000Q1K4KE,"wow this was more than i expected. it follows a group of soldiers from the barracks to the pow camp. its funny, its serious, its dramatic! some times its hard to believe this trilogy is over 55 years old the way it makes you laugh and cry with the fellows of battery 3. it gets across the message of how bad they thought the war was. it shows that the german soldier was human just like our boys and was not the monsters we were taught. i would recomend this movie to everyone. it does not premote the nazi agenda, but shows contempt for it. it shows that people will do what they have ,but can still keep there humanity!",1297900800,4,621,4.183333333333334
8194009,5,B000Q1K4KE,"This is the 3 part story of a small group of German soldiers in training just before WW2, at the eastern front, and in the last few days of the war on the western front.  They struggle with bullying and corruption in a German version of Catch 22 as they try to do their duty.  It is in black and white.  Language is German with English Subtitles.  It may be the best German made WW2 movie...only Das Boot comes close.",1237420800,8,417,4.175
