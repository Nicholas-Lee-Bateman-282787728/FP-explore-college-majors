It's as good an 60 minutes.",1382486400,,109,3.9545454545454546
8197110,1,B000QRIKH2,"Was very disappointed in what the feature story was..Very brief and was more seeking the documentary on Bullying. It alluded to that same feature in the preamble but it is not the same film. It then went on with other 20 20 segments which had no bearing on the topic of Bullies. A disappointment for me as an instructional tool for my students.

8197111,2,B000QRIKH2,"I purchased this dvd thinking that it was about bullying, but in reality, only the first 10 minutes are about a few stories of victims of bullying.  There is no discussion of what contributes to bullying or how to deal with bullies - the video simply presents the stories.  The rest of the stories on the DVD are unrelated to the title of the DVD",1326844800,4,346,4.3076923076923075
8197112,2,B000QRIKH2,I am a K-8 School Counselor and purchased this thinking the entire DVD was about Bullies. It actually is only a 10 min. segment which is somewhat outdated (didn't even mention the impact of the internet). I also purchased 20/20 DVD The 'In Crowd' and Social Cruelty which is better.,1220486400,15,282,4.66
