567502,5,6303082750,"This movie is absolutely terrible.

I love this movie so very much.

PLOT:  A drilling team in Denmark hits a weird substance and, when they investigate, find out they've drilled into a frozen tail of a prehistoric reptile.  While studying it, a scientist accidently lets it thaw, where it grows into REPTILICUS!  A giant dragon that spits acid slime and is demolishing Copenhagen!

As you can tell, its your basic Godzilla knock-off formula.  But don't take that to mean Reptilicus is anything resembling an ordinary giant lizard movie.

Where do I even begin?  How about Reptilicus himself (herself?)...  in most Godzilla/King Kong rip-offs, your monster in question is usually played by some guy in a ratty monster suit, or maybe is a stop-motion animated creature, right?  Reptilicus is very clearly a hand puppet or (when you can see all of him) a marionette.  Yup, visible strings and all, an honest-to-God marionette.  He lookes kinda like an Ancient Chinese style dragon, with really tiny arms, so there's no way he can swipe buildings with his hand like other movie monsters, they just kinda bump him sideways into the models.  Effects being what they are, he also doesn't really interact with the military fighting him.  You just see shots of the military, then shots of Reptilicus, back to shots of the military, etc.  They're never on the screen at the same time.

In one scene, Reptilicus eats a guy, and since its a hand puppet they have a photo of the actor overlaid on the screen, but then they ANIMATE the photo so he wiggles back and forth while he's floating into Reptilicus' mouth.  It (sadly) only happens once, but its freakin' incredible!

Reptilicus isn't just dangerous becuase he's big, though, he also spits acid slime!  These scenes are great, because instead of throwing goop on the military, they just overlay an ANIMATION of green slime on the film and add a ""BLORT!"" sound effect!  I swear I'm not making that up, it happens a half dozen times and each time is priceless!

Now that the monster is out of the way, lets talk about the other stuff.  This film was supposed to be Denmarks big breakthrough into the film industry, so officials and citizens of the country were very generous and accomidating to the filmmakers.

For instance:  The actors were all Danish and didn't speak English, so they learned their English lines phonetically.  That didn't turn out so good so they were all dubbed over, BUT since the voice actors had to try to match the actors lips, so the dubbing sounds like a terrible Godzilla movie even though the lips actually match up.

Another example:  Literally thousands of Copenhagen citizens were used as extras.  They all volunteered, and eager to be in a movie, dressed very well.  You will see more people fleeing (again, THOUSANDS) than you will in any Godzilla flick, all running from a dragon hand puppet.

Yet another example:  The Danish government was happy to volunteer its military equipment for the movie.  You'll get to see real tanks, cannons, flamethrowers and even a battleship setting off actual depthcharges... all to kill a crappy dragon marionette.

There's more to see (including a completely gratuitous ""come visit Denmark"" travelogue scene inserted without warning randomly in the film), none of it boring, all of it fast moving, all of it hilarious in its sincerity.  A classic of so bad its good films, Reptilicus needs to be seen at least once, and easily holds up to repeat viewings.  It easily deserves a spot in your DVD collection, probably right next to Plan 9 From Outer Space, Robot Monster, Troll 2 and Super Inframan.",1358121600,3,3612,4.844771241830065

567504,4,6303082750,"What to say...I am Danish, living in the US, so owning this for me is mandatory.

Between the Danish cast not being able to speak English, the effects being horrendous and the culture clash between ""classic"" cheap horror and our sleepy little country, it makes for a film that stands alone in its bizarre misguidedness.

Even ""Godzilla"" had a decent build-up prior to the big scenes; this one, through terrible acting and directing, just makes you either laugh or shake your head, and that is before the 'thing' actually shows up.

For me, as a Dane, it is so strange to see Dirch Passer, a well-known Danish comic, playing the dumb janitor. I have known his performances since I was a kid, and to see him in something like this is just surreal. To an international audience, he is just some goofball; in Denmark he was an institution.

If you love bottom-of-the barrel filmmaking, you must see this at least once. The DVD is beautifully transferred, great color and sound.

AIP cut this out because they thought it looked silly.

If that head been a yardstick for criterion, then there would have been little movie left.

567545,2,6303082750,"REPTILICUS is a classic of '50s horror schlock, being Denmark's unfortunately memorable contribution to the ""Radiation is Coming to Get Us"" giant monster movie genre. Lest we forget.

Produced in 1962 (as with 1961's GORGO, the fad for rubber man-eating reptiles crossed the Pond a bit late), REPTILICUS represents the literal and figurative tail end of this category of movie.

In terms of storyline, script, casting, acting, special effects, and production values, REPTILICUS is an embarrassment primarily because it's so obviously supposed to be a serious entry into the monster movie canon. The Danes no doubt wanted to make their own version of THE BEAST FROM 20,000 FATHOMS. Sadly, what they got was REPTILICUS, courtesy of American International Pictures.

There's nothing worse than an unintentionally campy movie. To be honest there are few movies worse than REPTILICUS. Still, I recommend it if you just love this sort of thing. REPTILICUS has always been a ""C"" movie cult favorite, and was the usual television fare at the Clampetts' and the Monkees'.

REPTILICUS suffers right from the outset from its improbable premise. Copenhagen, after all, doesn't strike anybody as the type of place a monster would want to attack. Maybe if this movie had been set on the south side of Chicago it would have had a fighting chance.

A group of prospecting Danish oilmen recover the frozen tail of a mysterious creature from beneath the ice. Taken back to Copenhagen (nobody is sure why) the tail is allowed to defrost and begins regenerating into the monster. Reptilicus manages to escape, and goes on a happy rampage through Denmark's quaint capital city.

The gravest danger to Copenhagen is that the Danes may all laugh themselves to death at the sight of this silly-looking creature, a swaying rubber snake's head with little angel wings on a broomstick, usually seen in the distance. (Reptilicus' grandson appeared in Andy Sidaris' HARD TICKET TO HAWAII without the wings.) Unforgivably poor animation of the beast spitting green acidic slime is mated with atrocious sound quality and none-too special effects. The monster's roar is reminiscent of banging tin cans. Reptilicus proves he's one bad dude by eating a farmer, or at least a badly-drawn transparent cartoon of a farmer, somewhere along the way. Reptilicus' mouth never moves during the process.

Copenhagen's population is comprised of a horde of blonde girls just waiting for macho American men to rescue them from the monster and the local males who are all, well...so, so blond in this movie.

The casting is the high point of REPTILICUS. Nobody anybody knows is in this movie. Let us give thanks it stayed that way. Voluptuous Danish actresses make this film well worth watching if your taste runs to the Nordic. Thank heaven for their nifty accents and bustlines.

Thank heaven as well for the corny, mostly dubbed, thickly accented dialogue that is just so much fun to pick apart. None of the all-Danish cast could speak English. Since REPTILICUS was slated for an American audience, the actors learned their lines phonetically. As a result, the cadence, pronounciation, and emphasis of the dialogue was utterly  incomprehensible. AIP, belatedly realizing they'd made a mistake, hired English speakers to voice-over the cast. The result is the worst dubbing in film history, hands down. The dubbed voices just could not be synchronized with the overwrought facial contortions of people trying to speak unnaturally, and so the cast looks as if they all suffer from uncontrollable tics. (The Director sued AIP for this, claiming they'd ruined his movie.)

The acting is downright terrible. I haven't seen so many stiffs outside of a morgue. The American general (played by a dubbed Dane) suffers from a behavioral impulse disorder and is manic depressive. He practically strangles a Danish scientist who disagrees with his ""Blow It To Hell"" strategy for dealing with Reptilicus. None of the men on camera seem to be able to figure out what to do, either with Reptilicus or with the script.

Director Sid Pink interrupts the action at this point to edit a full-length official government ""Come To Denmark"" travelogue filmstrip into the picture, just in case you've suddenly decided that you can't wait to visit the Tivoli Gardens, big-breasted blondes, or Reptilicus' house after seeing this movie.

Suffering cramps from too much belly laughter the Danes decide they can't cope with this unnatural disaster (the monster, not the picture...well, yeah...) on their own and call in the UN for military backup. We are then treated to a few minutes of stock footage of a tank battle.

The military does get the drop on Reptilicus eventually. Shortly after blowing off one of Reptilicus' stumpy little arms, the still-unstrangled Danish scientist realizes that any Reptilicus fragments will regenerate into other Reptilicuses (or is it Reptilici?).

So the order is passed: No More Shooting At Reptilicus, Boys. Of course, blond moment, nobody bothers to go searching for the missing limb, which starts to regenerate into Reptilicus II.

Eventually, Reptilicus commits suicide after attending the premiere of this film. The stump of Reptilicus II joins a cult, turns his back on the Hollywood life, and eventually reemerges to publish a healthy lifestyles book, THE HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN DIET (not available anywhere; unfortunately, the same can't be said for this ridiculous flick).

I wanted to rent The Beast because of its stop-motion special effects.  Reptilicus literally had the worst special effects of any movie I have ever seen.  The monster made a guy in a Godzilla suit look like something out of Lord of the Rings.  It was an inanimate rubber monster on, perhaps, one string.  No part of it moved, except that it would occasionally bob up and down or move on or off screen as if pulled or pushed.  In more than one scene it simply sat there.  As if this were not bad enough, there is the crudest-ever animated green slime that took me a while to understand was supposed to be coming out of its unmoving mouth.  Worst of all is a scene in which the monster eats a person.  We see the person screaming, then a cut to an incredibly bad cartoon person superimposed in the general area of the monster's mouth, again unmoving.  Fortunately, the movie put me to sleep.  I needed the rest.  It's a mystery to me why this was in the video store and no Harryhausen movie as far as I could tell was there (nor, for that matter was the original King Kong).",1097366400,3,1185,4.336363636363636

Living in the ruins of once was a frosty, nordic version of Plesentwille, I may be quite inhabil to give a truthfully review about the dokosoap of CPHdestruktion.
The sad facts is, this film is the very reason why danish films forever after is doomed to dwell among the chruel shaddows of realism!
Cant understand why Reptillicus failed to hit blockbusterlevel: Exellent acting ( If you could understand the exact dialog and level of voices your feet would crumble), super special effects ( if you blink very fast you almost can't see that the monster is manuvered around the streets on top of a constructionvagon!) and even SINGALONG-SONGS!!! Whoa! This was a strict demand from Scala studio ( a former major danish moviestudio who amazeing enough produced the movie ) cause in 1940-70 there had to be songs in EVERY danish film.
The ""funny-carakter"" in the movie is, belive it or not, the most fameos danish comedian at that time, and they had to put him in the movie, horrorfilm og not!
The film flopped totally, and at Scalastudio you litterelly speaking got fired to mention this film! True!
But anyway, patriot or not, I love this silly film. Just the scene from ""Langebro"" ( name of the bridge that goes up ) is a masterpice. Lots of totally unpripered ekstras ( not stuntmen, mind you!) is going faceforward down the icy wather, no safty just do it. Yep, welcome to the nonexisting stuntschool of Denmark!
So don't mind my lousy spelling, just run to get it, your view of monsterfilms will never be the same again!

567581,4,6303082750,"'Reptilicus' is the rarest of the Grade Z monster movie, alone in the genre of Danish giant lizard attacks Copenhagen with green 'acid slime' type movies, to my knowledge. True to form, the Danes call for UN intervention and after many wacky miscues finally discover an adequate method of pest control. This film achieved a very large cult following in both Denmark and the US in the 1960s, and clips from `Reptilicus' were frequently used on the sitcom ""The Monkees"" and elsewhere.
The film begins with Danish copper miners exploring for mineral deposits and finding some strange reptile flesh, which when taken to the laboratory eventually transforms into Reptilicus, a lizard with a nasty attitude. The UN spends the last half of the film chasing him around with tanks, ships, etc.; only when scientists and the military get together can they find a solution to their infestation problem.
This is typical early 1960s fare: silly monster, silly dialogue, lots of padding (yes, even musical interludes) and ludicrous special effects (especially the `acid slime' and the farmer getting eaten scene) combine to make this a classic. Considering when it was made and the novelty of it being from Denmark, this is a decent drive-in movie. It is a little more ponderous and stuffy than some of the contemporary monster movies from the US, so it doesn't rate five stars for camp value, still, a pretty fun picture to watch with the right frame of mind.",1076112000,7,1446,4.930327868852459

Eventually the creature finishes growing in one quick spurt and breaks out to terrorize the city and countryside.  It is up to a Brigadier General assigned by the UN and some local scientists to find a way to stop the creature.

I group of men are prospecting for copper when they unknowingly unearth a piece of the long dormant reptile's tail. Once it is safely tucked away in a freezer at an aquarium, one of the scientists (Dr. Dalby) unknowingly allows the tail to thaw out when he falls asleep at his desk. Somehow, the door to the freezer pops open but it is never explained how this happened. I guess the good doctor didn't close the door properly after snipping off a piece of the tail for further study. Anyhow, the tail thaws out and Reptilicus regenerates to terrorize all Denmark.

Eventually, General Grayson and his trusty bazooka manage to shoot a tranquilizer into the monster's mouth that knocks it completly out. This will allow the monster to be killed. As the film ends you can see the missing appendage throbbing on the sea floor, threatening to regenerate and wreak havoc all over again.
As I said earlier, this is a terrible film but it is so bad that it is wonderful. It ranks as one of the absolute worst giant monster movies ever made. Thank you, Sidney Pink!",1026172800,4,1444,4.5576923076923075
567589,3,6303082750,"This is actually a very, very bad movie, but it's great, great fun.  You've seen clips from it on so many different T.V. shows, you probably already know the title monster, even though you never knew where he came from.
Sid Pink produced this little B-movie gem, the same man who brought you The Angry Red Planet and other similarly cheap space-operas, and he produced it in Denmark  -  with a Danish cast  -  and released it through American International Pictures, which should tell you absolutely everything you need to know about it.
But if it doesn't:  Denmark drills up a bit of raw flesh during a probe for oil, which turns out to be from the title dinosaur beastie.  They eventually pull up a whole tail, and freeze-dry it for later study  -  or a midnight snack, I'm not sure which.  Needless to say, the spectacularly unfunny janitor forgets to turn the freezer unit back on after a power outage (how unfunny is he? his major bit of comic business is sticking his hand in the electric eel tank), and Reptilicus spoils by morning.
No, we couldn't be so lucky.  Reptilicus re-grows from his severed tail, and of course gets up and goes for a walk across the Danish countryside after a while, hawking up acid phleghm and disintegrating lots of idle gawkers.  The military, needless to say, just has to get in on the fun  -  here's all this great carnage and destruction, and they weren't even invited!  -  and blasts bits and pieces of Reptilicus all over the place, so we can have a sequel (which, probably thankfully, we didn't) after one of the lizard-bits regenerates to become Reptilicus II.
What makes this one such a kick in the pants is the Danish production  -  which is too silly to describe, really  -  and the title monster  -  which is even sillier.  Reptilicus is an obvious marionette dragon, that moves very unconvincingly across the countryside like a stop-and-start inchworm, head bobbing up and down and making a throaty ""caw"" like some kind of demonic buzzard.  And I'm not kidding about the acid phleghm.  You really gotta see that.
This is a Mystery Science Theater event, waiting to happen.  Don't let them beat you to the punch.  Take Reptilicus home with you, and enjoy countless man-hours (that could be spent doing anything more productive, like, I dunno, counting smashed spiders on the ceiling) snarking at the cheesy beastie, while you snarf down your favorite bag of chips.",1022630400,2,2411,4.692124105011933
567632,3,6303082750,"It is hard to live in Godzilla's shadow (now there's a scary thought...) and Reptilicus pales the moment you compare it to Japan's favorite city stomper.
The film begins with a crew drilling core samples in Denmark, when they discover blood and flesh on the drill. They soon discover the tail of a large fossil reptile buried in ice for millions of years. Of course, the scientists dig it up and place it in a freezer.
A scientist falls asleep one night and leaves the freezer door open, and the tail thaws out. They soon learn that it has been healing and regenerating itself. And, in typical monster movie fashion, they decide to try and grow it further, leading to the eventual birth of Reptilicus, a long serpantine-like beast with tiny wings and feet.
Reptilicus attacks Denmark and trashes homes in the usual monster movie fashion. The effects here are either ok or horrible depending on the scene. At times, the monster looks like a cheep toy and the ""green slime"" that he spits out is visually hysterical (but still not nearly as funny as the ""paper-doll-like"" cut and paste shot of a man being eaten).
Unlike the Asian movies that use hundreds of miniture tanks and jets, this film has great stock footage of tanks, ships and depth charges which make up for some of the poor monster shots.

This early 60's monster flick was shot and produced in Denmark, the last place you'd expect to find a film like this. There is little dubbing, as the film was mostly shot in english, so watching people speak is not nearl as funny as the Asian movies.
The sets look like an IKEA showroom, and nearly everybody is named Sven, Petersen or Hendersen. There is a wealth of b-roll footage of Copenhagen and Tivoli (from the 60's that is) providing a nice tour through Denmark. The soundtrack itself is also quite good, right down to a jazzy little number, ""Tivoli Nights,"" in which you'd expect to see a young Sean Connery stroll in as 007.

567635,4,6303082750,"When you think of silly monster flicks made around the 1950s and early 1960s, you think right away of those Japanese films where some monster attacks Tokyo. Reptilicus falls exactly in that same mould except for one major difference: the film is not Japanese at all, but Danish, with the help of American International (the same guys that later brought you those Frankie Avalon/Annette Funicello films like Beach Party). Just imagine everything you expect from those Japanese flicks, but it's set in Denmark, and the monster, this time, a serpent/dragon like monster that regenerated from a tail that got dug up by an oil rig, that attacks metropolitan Copenhagen. With the exception of where this movie was filmed, it has everything you ever wanted from a Japanese monster flick: really poor special effects (lots of them looking like people standing next to a screen, or animation that obviously looks like it was drawn on frame by frame), bad acting, panicking crowds, what more could you ask for? Of course, since this was released by American Internation, AI wasn't exactly known for top quality films (I doubt there's a single soul out there who likes those Frankie and Annette beach films), and while I can't say Reptilicus is a quality film, but it deserves a four star because it has a lot of appeal, and I love how it's the biggest ripoff of those Japanese monster films coming from a non-Japanese film. By the way, it also has a plot too, and I was really surprised I was able to sit through it all, but I did. So if you want a cheesy film, give this a try.",1004832000,2,1568,4.664259927797834

Much of the feature's charm is in the gentle humor mixed in to the science fiction plot.  The director didn't take the subject too seriously, and it shows.  Also interesting is the contrast between the subdued and quite satisfactory acting of the Danish cast and the schlocky overacting of the American lead.  If you are a true fan of early 50s-styled monster movies, you will find Reptilicus very satisfying.  Otherwise, wait for this one to pop up on television.",1000425600,,732,4.808

Sid Pink got his ticket punched when he made ""Angry Red Planet"", which single-handedly saved AIP's bacon. Sid travelled to Europe looking for distributors for ""Angry Red Planet"", and met Danish film wheeler-dealer Henrik Sandberg, who invited him to Copenhagen, and the rest is history. His AIP bosses gave him the go-ahead for a monster pic that would feature the ""beauties of the Danish countryside"". Pink also had permission to block off Copengahen's main square whenever he wanted, plus all the unpaid extras he could use. (In one scene, a local bicyle club rides their cycles off of a raising drawbridge for no other reason that it would look neat!) Even the Danish Army and Navy were at Pink's disposal: tanks, cannons, and a cutter throwing live depth charges.
Just to keep interest up, a Danish-language version was filmed at the same time as the English. Ann Smyner, a Danish actress, got top billing but SHE looks ridiculous in a jaw-dropping array of ""country girl""-style dresses that make Mary Ann look like Ginger.  Mimi Heinrich, another Danish ingenue, comes across MUCH better. Carl Ottosen, a Dane whose English was about as good as my Uzbek, plays the American general who takes over the Danish military (obviously HE got dubbed in). The entire cast seems to have learned their lines phonetically, giving them the aspect of having been recently thwacked in their collective heads by a two-by-four. But all this pales when the marionette ""Reptilicus"" comes into it's own. Only ""The Giant Claw"" can boast of a sillier-looking monster - this thing is downright pit-i-ful.
And yet - how can anyone resist this glorious mess? An entire scene devoted to a local singer belting out ""Tivoli Nights"" as the monster approaches the city, not as filler, but because Pink was so much in love with Copenhagen! A dirt-dumb janitor who decides to stick his arm in an aquarium just to see if that eel really *is* electric (and yup, it is....).
You can catch scenes of this astonishing movie in old episodes of ""Beverly Hillbillies"" and ""The Monkees"", among others.
