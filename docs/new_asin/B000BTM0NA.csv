8092521,2,B000BTM0NA,"I was so disappointed when I watched this video. I was looking for more culturally diverse videos for kids and I ordered this. The first story was good with African super heroes based on animal powers; however, the following stories were different and included extremely violent scenes including rogue soldiers and warriors that were inappropriate for children. Not appropriate for young children or anyone who is turned off by gratuitous violence and sexual assault depicted in animation. Two and a half stars.",1401753600,,511,5.2439024390243905
