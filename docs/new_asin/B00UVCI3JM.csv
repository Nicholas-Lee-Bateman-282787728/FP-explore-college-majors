7071536,4,B00UVCI3JM,Great slasher/horror movie homage to the great 80's. The dvd includes the awesome video to the song screams and whispers by the Rock band impending circle. If you are into slasher/horror movies done right you will most definitely enjoy scarred AKA (Kandie land).I imagine the negative reviews on here are from individuals that have never watched a slasher/horror movie nor have any appreciation or understanding what makes them fun to watch.,1458864000,4,441,5.225352112676056

7071541,5,B00UVCI3JM,For an independent horror movie this was really good.  A throw back to the 80's with cool kills and beautiful women.,1444953600,4,116,4.523809523809524
7071542,5,B00UVCI3JM,"Wasn't sure when I was told about this but what a cool movie. The killer Jonah is awesome, the women hot and the story cool. Couldn't be happier. A must watch!",1444867200,2,159,4.161290322580645

whats not to love?
give this movie a try!!!",1444780800,2,215,4.2682926829268295
7071544,1,B00UVCI3JM,"Bad. Just. No. I should have guessed from the description that it would be so horrible. I can't believe people actually spent money making this garbage, I could have produced this muck in my garage for a hundred bucks.",1443484800,7,218,4.615384615384615
8708524,1,B00UVCI3JM,"A couple dopey guys and a few vapid models travel to a remote countryside location for a photo shoot. About 45 minutes of bikini-clad filler occurs, and then finally the slasher ""plot"" officially begins. Jonah Kandie (a low-rent Jason Voorhees) picks off all our unlikable characters one by one (in a very dull, almost PG-13 fashion). Perhaps the production couldn't afford proper gore shots, but that's the only reason anyone's watching this movie. It's extremely disappointing to see very little blood (and it's especially infuriating when most of the violence occurs OFF CAMERA). The lack of originality really stings here, as we're subjected to the same old dumb, tired BS cliches: A car doesn't start, cell phones have no signals, etc. The best thing about this movie is the cover art. After you've seen that then you can skip the film.",1529798400,,841,4.971631205673759
8708525,1,B00UVCI3JM,A bunch of unattractive guys get together to shoot some reasonably attractive models...and that's just the behind-the scenes!,1526947200,,125,6.0

8708527,1,B00UVCI3JM,"So bad! Music was crap. Sound was crap. Acting.. casting.. story.. crap, crap, and more crap. Really bad.",1510790400,2,105,4.888888888888889
8708528,3,B00UVCI3JM,Expected better ending,1506902400,,22,6.666666666666667
8708529,3,B00UVCI3JM,Not too bad for low budget horror....acting is not great. Production is low budget but concept was good...,1504051200,,106,4.944444444444445
8708530,5,B00UVCI3JM,"Scarred is another great movie produced by Fright Teck Pictures.  If you love scary movies then, check this out.",1467849600,3,112,4.894736842105263
8708531,2,B00UVCI3JM,"Four models, a photographer and a token fat guy go off to ""the lodge"" for a photo shoot, except they camp out in small tents instead. Whatever happened to those large green canvas monstrosities anyway? There is the story of Jonah Kandi who apparently died with no one bothering to find a body. A midget claims he is still alive.

This is a slasher film, so I can't imagine there be much of a plot spoiler except for ""final girl."" The film had a low budget sound system that was choppy and ill suited. Too much outdoors sound at beach, too much munching when midget was eating, and other sound had an echo effect. Typical slasher with various implements including a chainsaw and other questionable brand new items.

Appears to have originally been released in 2013 under the groan title ""Kandi Land"" without much fanfare.

Guide: F-word, sex, nudity (Jessica Lauschin) Minus a star for crappy sound.",1463356800,2,898,4.707006369426751
8708532,3,B00UVCI3JM,"If you like slasher movies you will like this. Very true to it's style and format. Well done, worth a watch when you are in the mood for gore.",1462752000,3,142,3.9310344827586206
8708533,1,B00UVCI3JM,Shame on the reviewers that gave this more than one star. Awful acting terrible production true garbage!,1462752000,,104,5.176470588235294
