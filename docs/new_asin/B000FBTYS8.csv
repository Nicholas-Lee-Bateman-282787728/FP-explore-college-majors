8120464,1,B000FBTYS8,This movie cost $12.99.  What the heck!  I thought this price should be around $5.99 to $9.99.  Because this short film that does not have captions or sub-titles.  I do not give star but it requires me to rate one star for bad price.  Do not waste your money for this suck!,1392336000,,273,4.173076923076923
8120465,1,B000FBTYS8,This extremely short film has NO captions or sub-titles.  The entire plot will be lost on deaf viewers.  This bears mention as the message that this film is trying to convey is INSENSITIVITY TO THE DEAF!,1182988800,9,203,4.611111111111111
