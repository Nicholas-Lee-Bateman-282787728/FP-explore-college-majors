8574574,5,B00BVR2B30,"Wow, a professional DVD that covers all of the bases.  From someone that just received a CCW, considering a CCW or someone that has had one for years this is the DVD for you. After watching it, I bought four more copies for family and friends.  I'm not one that makes copies, the creator of the DVD does not get paid when you make copies and they deserve it and it's money well spent.  You need a gift for family or friends this is the one!

I wish is was in a digital download version to put on my IPad.",1423699200,,504,4.01
