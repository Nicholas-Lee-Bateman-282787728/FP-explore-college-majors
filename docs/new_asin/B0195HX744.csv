8744036,5,B0195HX744,"Good quality release, both of the films are presented in 2.35:1, 16x9 enhanced and not in 4:3 as Amazon claims. Good English audio quality too. This dvd has trailers for both films and a nicely edited slideshow. Django the Bastard is a big upgrade from the spaghetti western multi-film pack I own. Boot Hill also looks very good, I have never seen it in widescreen before. My only nitpick is that I wish this had subtitles to go along with the Italian dubs, but it doesn't ruin the dvd.",1485302400,4,486,4.47191011235955
