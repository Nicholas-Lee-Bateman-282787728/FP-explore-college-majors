8029988,4,B0002OXV7S,"I tried this several years ago when I had just begun doing Pilates and I put it aside; it was too fast-paced and assumed too much understanding of the basic moves. Now that I am far more comfortable with Pilates and more familiar with the moves, I appreciate what a good workout this provides. If you are a newbie, do not even think about this. I prefer a slower-paced program with more time to ""get it right."" However, I do like the fact that I can do the first 25 minutes, skip the leg exercises the next 20 minutes and still get a decent morning workout.",1404864000,2,557,4.264150943396227
8029989,4,B0002OXV7S,"The dvd moves along nicely and is a little more advanced.  Some of the moves he goes too quickly through, so I felt I wasn't getting enough out of some of them.",1391040000,,160,4.0
8029990,3,B0002OXV7S,"I really liked this DVD the first time I did it, but after that I became a little less excited.  The production quality isn't great, but that really doesn't bother me much.  I really liked the high number of exercises that are included in this video.  However, I wish some of it would have been slowed down so I could really feel the burn.  I like how quickly he moves to the next exercise without the incessant talking that some workouts have.  If you want a quick 35 minute workout with many many exercises you'll probably enjoy it.",1369180800,,534,4.408163265306122
8029991,5,B0002OXV7S,"I have over 10 Pilates DVD's and this is my go to workout when I need a good core workout.  The instructor assumes that if you are using this advanced DVD, you know at least the basic terms.  This is important to know because if you are new to Pilates, please try a different beginning series.  This is not the place to start..

I like this series because it follows the traditional Pilates sequencing and also reminds the user of the correct posture and body movements.  Some movements may seem unsafe, but if your core is strong and you are experienced, this DVD is perfectly safe.

If I only have a 20 minutes, I stop just before the leg exercises...if I have 45 minutes, I complete the whole session.
 Well worth the money.  In fact, the best bargain in the Pilates DVD film genre.",1359331200,,785,4.402777777777778
8029992,5,B0002OXV7S,"I'm an intermediate to advanced 25 years of cardio-with-weights exerciser and picked this up from a sale bin.  I usually prefer cardio with weights over Pilates and Yoga because they're just not demanding enough.  Not this one.  As the first reviewer said, you do get breathless going through all the exercises.  It's an hour long, but moves from one exercise to another at a good pace, so the time goes very quickly.  And I feel wonderful when I'm done.  One of the women in the video does ""beginner"" type modifications, and there's a bonus 12 minute standing workout which comes in handy some mornings.  I'm definitely glad I purchased this.  I do have a few other Yoga and Pilates workout videos, and this instructor seems much more of a pro than the well known video instructors who aren't specialists in these areas.  I've studied dance with professionals, and he is on that level.  I don't know what the second reviewer is talking about.  She/he has written the same thing on all of Mr. Urla's videos, fyi.",1327017600,2,1012,4.693181818181818
8029993,5,B0002OXV7S,"With original music by Kevin Kuhn and an instructor who presents true Pilates challenges, this workout is an advanced exercise routine with enjoyable jazzy music to fit in with the New York Penthouse location. Wood floors, mats and candles set the studio mood and if realistic dance studios appeal to you, you will feel right at home.

The two sections present a mat workout and a standing workout with an exercise band. The exercises seemed to be very true to the basic exercises I've learned over the years. Beginners would find it very difficult to keep up with the rapid pace and lack of detailed instruction. This is definitely intermediate to advanced and will be loved by anyone looking for additional strength training and balance challenges. The main exercises
include:

Hundred
Leg Circles
Abdominal Series
Swan
Neck Pull
Spine Twist
Side Kick Series
Teaser
Kneeling Side Kicks
Pilates Push-Ups

To be quite honest, I was out of breath in places. This workout might look fairly tame at first, but it is super invigorating once you get going and the main hurdle for anyone who is intermediate is to keep up with the speed of the exercises. This is a fast-paced creative dream. If you are looking for a playful yet serious workout, this might intrigue you. For serious students of Pilates who want to enhance their routine and feel like they have accomplished a dancer-style routine.

If you are feeling the winter blues approaching, this will wake you up and make you feel alive! After trying this workout, I'll definitely be reviewing the entire series. This will tighten and tone your entire body and enhance your mood.

8029994,1,B0002OXV7S,"This is a remake with a new title of Urla's NYStyle Pilates dvds and videos released earlier this year on this very site. As a Pilates instructor who studied with Romana it is clear that this is far from the 'real deal' Urla claims it to be on his description. While the settings and actors are 'pretty', the constantly skewed camera angles are distracting as is the music. There are drags on the tape and obvious voice over corrections that add to the distraction of constant cuts of the camera shots. He claims to be a seasoned instructor, who should know that clear and simple makes Pilates easier and more effective. I'm not a big fan of Windsor Pilates, as they look for a shortcut to fitness, but this is the other extreme - too much talking and not enough workout",1099785600,6,770,4.468085106382978
