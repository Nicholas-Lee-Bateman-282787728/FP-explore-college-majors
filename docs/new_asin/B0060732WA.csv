4912299,5,B0060732WA,"According to several websites, this DVD is supposed to include two Best Friend Necklaces.

The current photo in the product page does not mention the necklaces, but there is no mention that there are two different versions of this DVD.
I thought the original pre-order photo said it included the necklaces (Best Buy and Target's photos refer to them too).

When I received the DVD, there were no necklaces to be found.

Did anyone buy this DVD from Amazon (pre-ordered or not) and receive necklaces?",1329436800,,499,4.847058823529411

4912402,1,B0060732WA,"sure these are all episodes that have already aired and sure i didn't want to bring a dvd player with us on a 3 hour flight. i purchased it any way since this version was advertised with a digital copy that can be burned from a laptop and copied to a tablet. my daughter will gladly watch episodes that she's already seen so long as her mmch friends are on screen. i wasn't able to burn the windows media option since there's a hiccup in the data cd that is VERY sensitive about which version of media player runs on your windows machine, so i burned the iTunes copy that was offered only to find that it wasn't compatible with my android tablet. double drats. the dvd and data cd included in the package will now serve as excellent drink coasters for my daughter's mommy and daddy. too good to be true usually is -- except it cost me much more than i normally spend on coasters to protect our furniture.",1358812800,,904,4.292397660818714

4912406,5,B0060732WA,"Little kids seem to love these Mickey Mouse Club videos even though they are overly didactic and somewhat repetitive. The animation is cute, and the characters are fun, and our small grandchildren ask to watch them over and over. They are not videos that have any entertainment value for adults (such as Backyardigans that at least has fun music), but that's OK. These are for the kiddies, after all. I would say this appeals to toddlers and pre-school kids. I do wish the makers of products for children would concentrate on making them fun and creative and stop hammering the kids over the head with the alphabet, numbers, colors, etc. Also, stop with the constant quiz mode - ""Which one should we choose?"" or ""Which one is smaller?""",1357084800,,735,4.75

4912408,5,B0060732WA,"So first things first, have you signed up for Disney Movie Rewards? Go sign up disneymovierewards.com and then everytime you buy a disney movie you enter in the code and get points to spend on free stuff, like more movies, gifts, sticker books, lots of fun stuff. Ive gotten lunchboxes etc, - thats not the point, and I don't get points if you sign up, I just think if your checking out disney cartoons you should know. Anyways, I LOVE that they are making Minnie Mouse staring videos, I have a little girl and love that Minnie has her head together and can solve problems, my little one is just starting to love Minnie and Mickey, and this is another great girl power cartoon, and not something where she needs to be rescued. Yeah Minnie! She has help from her friends, great team work video. I buy these for car trips for the car.",1351987200,,832,4.409090909090909
4912409,5,B0060732WA,We don't have the Disney channel so I was browsing Amazon for a Mickey/ Minnie DVD. I grew up on and loved Mickey Mouse and wanted to share it wit my 2 yr old daughter.

4912410,3,B0060732WA,I was really surprised to see all of the positive reviews once I received the dvd for my little girl. It's the same old episodes she has been seeing on tv (almost none actually about Minnie as the main character) and she didn't even finish watching it. She and I were both pretty disappointed in it. It's simply a compilation of random episodes and titled I Love Minnie.,1340928000,11,370,4.455882352941177
8490149,1,B0060732WA,"Bought for granddaughters birthday and when it was opened would not work in the dvd player, did not alert me that it was not compatible in ours dvd player and since bought it early the company would not honor it since just pasted the return date. How Amazon would allow it to ship to an address that is to be delivered in the United States and knowing it would not work really bothers me.
