8705467,5,B00UDHR788,"All of these videos by Ray Rogers are excellent!  He shows 'Noobs' like ME how to build several types of forges and how to use them step-by-step.  I even learned how to build a blower for the forge.
Ray's other videos taught me how to make a 'kit knife' and KYDEX sheath for it.  I learned how to properly size holes for pins and screws and taps without guessing.  He tells you what tools and supplies are needed and where to get them. Ray's extensive experience in knife making lets him pass his knowledge and tips and hacks that will save you $$$.",1494460800,,549,4.300970873786408
8705468,5,B00UDHR788,"With the information Ray provided in this DVD, I was able to build a forced air burner for my homemade propane forge from items available at a local hardware store (Lowe's).  The forced air burner significantly increased the temperature range of the forge.  In the DVD, Ray also covers the steps and materials for building a propane forge from scratch as well as building a venturi style burner from readily available materials.  He also covers other forge related topics, including the important topic of how to safely light a propane forge.  Everything is explained in terms that are easy to follow and understand.  This is a great video for anyone interested in learning about propane forges and burners.",1447372800,4,707,4.9576271186440675
