155461,5,0792844041,Ian McKellen in all his depth and glory. He's charming and devilish. While he's done a lot of Shakespeare this may be his best suited role. The supporting cast is great. The fantastical 20th century war-time setting works better than the production decisions in a lot of other modern Shakespeare renditions.,1479427200,,307,5.03921568627451

155463,5,0792844041,"The greatest Shakespeare on film there is. From the chilling opening showing the murder of King Henry, to the second scene which manages to clearly delineate the relationships among all the principal characters without a word of dialogue, all the way to the end the movie moves like a speeding freight train to its conclusion.

There is a point at which stage villainy becomes so bad that it lapses into humor (think Simon Legree) and McKellen's genius is to put that principal to work in this production. His Richard is so evil, so reprobate, that he is at points grotesquely, yet laugh out loud, funny. For example, as we are watching Brackenberry about to cart Clarence off to the tower, suddenly Richard's face intrudes from the side and he says ""Plots have I laid."" It could have come straight from an old episode of Flash Gordon.

The scene in the basement morgue where Richard woos Lady Anne is a classic. Surrounded by mangled corpses, one of them Anne's husband, Richard falls to his knees and pulls a ring off his finger with his teeth and places it Anne's. It's so startling you sit there with your mouth open. Then he boasts, ""I'll have her, but I'll not keep her long,"" and we watch him dance and caper up the stairs chortling, ""Shine out, fair sun, till I have bought a glass,/That I may see my shadow as I pass.""

So many great bits, just one example: when the Lord Mayor comes to demand that Richard take the throne, Buckingham is quick to snatch the dust jacket off the dirty novel Richard is reading so Richard can then pretend it's a prayer book.

Since the film is set in a fictional Fascist country in the 1930s, you may be wondering how the production would handle Richard's most famous line: ""My kingdom for a horse."" I won't give it away, but the way the writer and director preserve the line so that it make absolute sense in context is utterly brilliant.",1469750400,,1880,4.536873156342183

155477,2,0792844041,"King Richard III didn't live in the 1930's, and William Shakespeare didn't write in the 20th century. This historical figure lived in the the late Middle Ages, and Shakespeare wrote in the very late 16th and early 17th centuries near the end of the Renaissance. To snatch an historical figure 550 years out of his historical context and a corresponding play 450 years out of its theatrical and artistic context I believe loses the entire point of Shakespeare's original play. Taking bona fide masterpieces of theater and setting them down into another period is certainly in vogue these days, and victims have included other masterworks, including those by Wolfgang Mozart/da Ponte and even Richard Wagner. It is a practice I question, if only to say they simply are not the original works as intended by the artist-creators. They may be compelling and interesting but exist as a new work with elements of the original but they are NOT equivalent to the original. In this case, Richard III is set in the early 20th century during the period when the Nazis ruled Germany.

Now, certainly any artist is free to do whatever he or she wishes with a play or opera which is in the public domain. But just because these things can be done, the question is whether they should be done, or at least to acknowledge they are fundamentally altering the original. Unfortunately however, this practice of ""contextual re-appropriation"" for lack of a better term is often rationalized in such a way to make it more real for contemporary audiences. Again, that's fine, but it is a morphing of the original work into something else. Making Richard III into a European Nazi-sympathizer of the 1930's is reshaping Shakespeare's original vision into something quite distinctive from a 16th-century interpretation of a 15th-century historical figure. The bottom line: no matter what it is, and not matter how well it works on its own terms, it is not really Shakespeare anymore. Now granted, I am not saying it should never be done, but it is not Richard III as conceived by William Shakespeare.

Consider the following: Could Tennessee Williams' A Streetcar Named Desire be transferred to early Colonial America? Or how about Neil Simon's ""The Odd Couple"" set in Elizabethan England, with Oscar as a tavern owner and Felix as a cobbler? Gilbert and Sullivan's ""The Mikado"" could be easily set in a host of other eras, such as the Middle Ages or even Antiquity. Or maybe a film version of Mark Twain's ""Tom Sawyer"", keeping all the dialog, but set in the ghetto of New York in the 1970's. Again these ""morphings"" could possibly work on their own terms, but they wouldn't be Williams, Simon, Gilbert-Sullivan, or Twain anymore. They would be something else, and I think something would certainly be lost by placing them outside their contexts. Part of what makes them rich and appealing has to do with their original eras. Funny, though, no one would dare do this to Williams or Twain, but Shakespeare, Mozart and Wagner are constantly being re-contextualized.

Maybe for myself after watching this film is that I never saw King Richard III of England. I saw a new character possibly inspired by Richard III but not Shakespeare's Richard III. Richard III lived in the late Middle Ages. He didn't have access to machine guns, tanks or telephones. He wouldn't have understood the terms fascism or communism. And he certainly would not have been smoking a cigarette. And to add one further point, there are a myriad of films set during World War II. Is it really necessary to take a Shakespeare play and put it there as well? As it is, there are not as many big-budget productions of Shakespeare plays produced after 1970 set in their original context as their should be, barring the wonderful BBC productions. There are plenty of films depicting Europe before, during and just after the Nazis.

Because I prefer my Shakespeare, my Mozart and my Wagner produced in ways more closely adapted into what the authors had intended, which includes their historical context, I am not a good judge of this kind of material. Richard III to its credit may work on its own terms. But the use of the original Shakespearean language for a setting in the 20th century doesn't make much sense to me, and I don't really see the point. West Side Story, which was Romeo and Juliet set in 1950's New York, is a perfect example of how Shakespeare can be updated without messing with the original. Instead of the actors saying lines in Elizabethan English, new dialog was written which was contextually more appropriate for the mid-20th century, particular white gang members and Puerto Ricans in New York City. I think I would have preferred a newly written work with the plot inspired by Richard III rather than thrusting Shakespeare's blank verse across several centuries and putting it where it really doesn't belong.",1433808000,2,4874,4.86867469879518

155487,5,0792844041,"I only pretend to love Shakespeare on film -- in reality, I'm usually quietly suffering the shame of boredom and detachment that comes from thinking that this is something I ""should"" be enjoying.

That said, McKellen's astonishing take on Richard III is the joyful exception.  Knowing now that, in reality, King Edward VIII (the one who abdicated the throne for the love of Wallis Simpson in 1936) has been discovered to have been quite friendly with a young up-and-comer named Adolph Hitler in the run-up to World War Two casts an especially mischievous light on setting Shakespeare's tale during that time.  I can't say for certain that McKellen and his collaborators were thinking about this relatively recent revelation, but the movie works incredibly as an alternate-history take on Great Britain's participation in that war.

Shakespeare's traditional fourth-wall-breaking monologues are served especially brilliantly here, in McKellen's meticulous performance.  I would recommend putting any resistance to Shakespeare aside and making room in your life for this unique film.",1406246400,,1081,5.4879518072289155

155493,4,0792844041,"This is perhaps the most entertaining and intellectually rich adaptation of any of Shakespeare's plays; originally a stage production put on by director Richard Loncrane and star Ian McKellen.  Not only does the cast give stellar performances (except for the blatantly stiff American interpretation given by Downey Jr.), the visual elements at work, both in scenery and camera work gives an enticing view into a intriguing classist world where the actions of one can alter the entire world.

As Shakespeare put the focus of his works on the on goings of the noble, royal, and burgeoning upper class, the film brings  history of Britain into it's interpretation: incorporating reminiscent of the Blitz, as well as Britain's ongoing political turmoil regarding the acceptance of fascism.  For the most part, the dialog is drawn straight from the original text, giving the whole film the feel of Shakespearean stage as it is known today.  The classic elements are given the added impetus of excellent cinematography, the camera acting as much as a window into these lives as much as the view into the strange sub world of asides.

Ian Mckellen's portrayal of Richard is perhaps his best in terms of Shakespearean performance.  Having stared in several filmic adaptations of the Bard's work, this was a film and a role that he himself was intrinsic to design and portray.  Perhaps too strong a stand out, as other actors had to come in try to fit into their assigned roles rather than having the same option to design.  I do have to note that, after lending the film to an older friend, she was not surprised to find out Mckellen is gay.  The actors sexuality not withstanding, Richard is shown as a man whose power is not only of the mind but in a crippled body which can be seen limping into battle, often leading other troops into the fray.

I'm a 90's kid.  The heavy emphasis of action in the film didn't deter me as much as enthrall.  This, I know, is not every film goers opinion, and may find the film with too many explosions.  Further, this is not an entry level Shakespeare film.  The characters willith being touched with grace of tounge and long of wind and zero damneths be given if thine ears are untrained and brain spoiling. However, it can still be followed; and anyone who is beyond the ""10 Things I Hate About You"" level will find an intriguing and exciting film.",1392249600,,2379,4.72639225181598

155500,5,0792844041,"I had just finished directing a stage production of this famous Shakespeare play when I decided to compare it with various professionals who had committed it  to various videos. Frankly, after wading thru several truly heavy and bombastic presentations, I stumbled over the MGM version starring Ian McKellen in the title role. It was - and remains - marvelous! The time has been updated to the 1930's, and England had just passed beyond a bloody civil war. Edward sits on the throne, and his brother, Richard, plans his undoing. Where this version differs from others is that McKellen does not beat you over the head with testosterone. His performance is subtle, presenting almost delicate hues of interpretations to an iron-willed determination. I loved it! I understood it! The cast also boasts the presence of a young Annette Bening and a decidedly boyish Robert Downey Jr. (And, as gifted as these performances are, they pale compared to McKellen.)
I can't recommend this version enough. I think even old Will Shakespeare would have purchased a copy of this one.

Why the decided to set it in the 1930 era I am not sure. This is Shakespeare's view of ambition, lust and murderous treachery. There are other views you can read about later.

I have to confess I know the play; if I had not known the play it would be easy to be lost. I still did not know the parts of some of the people.

I have a hunch we have not seen the last of Richard III. No telling what can be dug up now days.

Amazingly, the movie stays true to Shakespeare's words and story amid the 1930s, and the dialogue does not sound quaint or preposterous amid the 20th-century settings and costumes. McKellen's Richard dominates the film, of course, an anti-hero who breaks from his villainy to address the audience through the ""fourth wall"" and make them complicit in his trail of murder and power-grabbing.

Once Richard starts killing, of course, he can't stop...everyone he deals with has to die -- even his most loyal supporters. At the end, Richard is on his own, and truly ""on top of the world.""

155509,5,0792844041,"Ian McKellen plays Richard III in this amazing and inspiring version of the Shakespeare play.  Always my favorite with its action and wit, I found this version to be quite a lot of fun.  Compared to the Laurence Olivier version, which acknowledges the play format from the beginning, Ian McKellen's version takes the play and makes it into a complete film format.  While the story stays the same, good king Edward IV is dying leaving his wife and two sons in the good hands of his cousin, Richard.  Quite alarming for the widow and she is proven to be correct.  Richard iII not only manages to kill the boys in the Tower but take the throne for himself, at least for a short while.  The setting is different for this version of Richard IiI, the clothing, sets and hair all appear to be from the 1940s.  In fact, Ian McKellen's costume for Richard III is a Nazi uniform and a Hitler style mustache.  The stand out is the performers.  Ian McKellen is amazing as Richard III and Annette Benning does a great turn for Elizabeth, Edward VI's wife and mother of Edward V.  Maggie Smith and Kristen Scott Thomas as well as Robert Downey Jr. are in the cast.  I felt that this film made Shakespeare more accessible and comprehensible.

The locations chosen are familiar to most British viewers and yet - different. I have been by Battersea Power station many times but never has it creeped me out until now.
The cast is superb, even, (gasp) American actors in major roles of a Shakespeare play. I refer to Annette Bening and Robert Downey Jr. But on that, it is Ms Bening so all is possible.
So many names, so many parts. All good. Nigel Hawthorne as George, Duke of Clarence needs special mention. Our sympathy for this loyal Royal brother is tested when we see how, in the end, his it treated. This is a great moment for the late Sir Nigel H.

This is not as far-fetched a what-if as some might think; historically, there were a number of very vocal reactionary Fascist sympathizers in the UK and USA before the on-set of the Second World War--some of them very well known and even highly respected. Indeed, Richard's murderous machinations seem terrifyingly natural in this context, brought to lavish life with beautiful cinematography, pitch-perfect period settings, costumes, music, vehicles and war machines. Ian McKellen is superb in the title role--I actually like his portrayal better than Laurence Oliviers 1953 outting, which remains a bench-mark of traditional staging and production.

This nation is involved in a civil war. Who will triumph? Suddenly there is a rumbling sound and a tank crashes through a brick wall then soldiers shoot the men inside the building. There is a new monarch in the country by right of conquest. [How it really works.] There is a celebration for the new royalty and his supporters. [While set around the 1920s the speech is from the late 16th century (by Shakespear). Anachronistic? The night scenes hide the modern world.] Richard plots to create conflicts so he can profit from this. [Still true, see `Cointelpro'.] A widow visits a hospital to view her dead husband. Richard visits her to propose marriage. [They were childhood friends in real life.] Anne rejects him (at first). The new King Edward has health problems (from smoking?). Richard meets his servant James Tyrrell.

Clarence makes a speech in his prison. Richard pays off two men. There are speeches at a royal dinner, and personality conflicts between the Queen and Gloucester. [No knowledge of manners?] The news of Clarence's death affects the King adversely. Edward soon dies. His son will become the new king. Later there is news of the death of Rivers. The Prince of Wales arrives in London. A Lord who will not support Richard is quickly condemned and hanged. [No Bill of Rights then.] What about the princes in the Tower of London? Richard uses the press to slander the dead Edward. Richard poses as a religious man who is hesitant to take the throne. [A great actor?] King Richard speaks to supporters in a hall. [Resemblance to 1930s Germany?] Anne gives herself a shot while riding in her car. But the two princes still live. Buckingham wants time to consider this request. Queen Anne is sick and near death.

There is growing opposition to Richard in the land. The princes are gone, Anne will join them. There is bad news: Buckingham has gone to join Richmond in France. Richard's mother curses him, then leaves. Elizabeth complains against Richard. What will he do? Marry her daughter! Lord Stanley is sent to raise troops for King Richard. He learns Richmond has landed in England with a strong army. Buckingham is captured and strangled. Richard will depend on Stanley's forces. But he has a bad dream at night. ""Be not afraid of shadows."" [Is this scene suggestive?] The railroad coach is bombed. Richard's jeep is wrecked (""Get a horse!"") and he runs away. Richmond follows in pursuit and shoots at Richard. Is this the end of the story?

While the story is set in modern times, the language is still four centuries old and needs to be updated. The outdoor settings are contrived for the illusion of the 1930s. Note the various styles of helmets used by the soldiers. I suppose this production was considered clever, but it seems to have been a flop at the box office; the ultimate critic. Perhaps it would have been better if it was really modern (set in the 1990s) and based on a business rivalry? Aside from Oliver Stone's ""Wall Street"", Hollywood is usually unable to dramatize the real world of business.
The allegation that Richard III murdered the two princes in the Tower were known false in the late 18th century when Hugh Walpole wrote his essay. Their existence would have prevented Henry VII from becoming king, for example. Henry Tudor married the princes' sister to cement his claim to the throne. Shakespeare was a playwright-propagandist for the flawed Tudor dynasty.",1335398400,,3436,4.808798646362098

Recently, when I learned a ""modern"" version of Coriolanus was being released, I thought of this movie and decided to buy it.  After all, I was inexpensive, enough.  This time, it was like a whole new experience.  I sat there, enthralled by what I was seeing.

155519,5,0792844041,"Richard Loncraine's Richard III is an inventive adaptation of Shakespeare's famous play by the same name.  Instead of a late medieval setting, we're greeted with an industrial, 1920s-1940s aesthetic (beautiful cars, haunting smoke stacks, bleak factories etc).  England itself has been transformed into a Fascist state (the emblems, the flags, the uniforms).

I've always been receptive to unusual adaptations of Shakespeares works (Titus, for example) -- I feel that Shakespeare's plots, characters, and themes are so archetypal that they function in just about any setting.  In this case, much of the original plays has been modified and manipulated for cinema.  Purists will obviously be bothered by the drastic reconceptualization.  However, this is an visually fascinating, extraordinarily well-acted (the all-star cast lives up to the billing), and visceral experience.

Plot Summary (limited spoilers)

I suspect most of you are familiar with the plot of Shakespeare's play.  But if you're not, here's a brief recap.  The evil Richard (Ian Mckellen at his best) desires the throne above all else.  Along with his various henchmen, he slowly has his rivals murdered (including two of his young nephews whom he had sequestered in the tower) and schemes and double crosses and, unsurprisingly, dies in battle.

If there's a flaw in the film, it's the magnificent beginning sequence: the quiet, then the deep breaths, the soldiers with gas masks, the tank crashing through the wall, the the fatal gun shot...  None of the following scene live up to the shocking beginning.  The film ends on a somewhat rushed note.  I feel that the battle sequence could have been played out a tad bit more....

Final Thoughts

My favorite aspect of the film is above all the re-imagined setting.  This definitely gives the film an unusual feel.  One does not imagine a strange Fascist alternative England where the people speak the lines of Shakespeare.  The uncanny feeling is perfectly matched by the dark undertones and the extreme sadistic edge of Richard.  The scene where Lady Anne (Kristin Scott Thomas) enters the moratorium and cries over husband's body only to be wooed by a few moments later by her husband's murderer Richard sums up the experience...  writhing undercurrents of dread.  Everything combines perfectly -- Richard III shines through in all his dark glory.

I recommend Richard III even for those who are uncomfortable with a re-imagined/manipulated Shakespeare since it functions as a film rather than a spruced up theater production. It is a truly wonderful experience....

155520,4,0792844041,"Overall:

At 104 minutes and changed in setting to England in the early 1930s, this film makes little pretense to be Shakespeare's Richard III, with the exception of maintaining the dialogue from the Folio text. As for the quality of the film, I do not believe that modernizing the setting enhanced the film adaptation much, except perhaps for people who would be bored by setting the film in the 1400s. Therefore, it may have created a broader appeal to a cinematic audience. Perhaps, also by starring Ian McKellen as Richard III, the film will appeal to Lord of the Rings fans and/or fans of McKellen's performance as Macbeth in the minimalist ""Macbeth.""

I personally have based my 4 star rating on how well the film communicates the THEMES from Shakespeare's original play, as well as the acting performances [McKellen is excellent]. Of course, as I have previously written, this film adaptation compares Richard III with Hitler and England with Germany  (ex: the red, white, and black flags, the military attire, the chants, etc).

Below I have listed some technical issues pertaining to the adaptation (for those who really want to know how this film adaptation differs from the Folio text).

Characters Eliminated:
- Dorset
- Gray
- Queen Margaret
  (Duchess of York and Queen Elizabeth speak some of her most famous lines)

Alternations:
- Lord Hastings is the Prime Minister - not the Lord Chamberlain
- Some words and sentence structure are changed [of course, nearly 2/3rds of the dialogue is eliminated]

Film opens with Richard's attack against King Henry VI and Prince Edward. [In total, there is 9 minutes of introductory shots/material not included in the actual text of the play.]

Act 1, Scene 1 is greatly condensed.  [All act and scene number refer to the Norton Shakespeare based on the Oxford text.]
- Film clearly portrays from the beginning, Richard's brilliant verbal abilities to woe a crowd when he delivers his first lines in a public speech.
- Film shows Richard using the restroom to urinate while continuing the less favorable portions of his introductory speech.

Act 1, Scene 2 is greatly condensed.
- Anne hovers over the body of Prince Edward in the morgue.
- Richard pulls a ring from his mouth for Lady Anne to wear after proposing to her.
- In 1.2. 215-250, Richard gives a condensed version of his victory of Anne speech as he walks through a hospital while seeing many wounded people about whom he does not seem to care.

Film adds a scene between 1.2. and 1.3 in which Richard burns Clarence's letter of pardon, which King Edward IV had signed.

Act 1, Scene 3 with the exception of some of the first 20 lines is excluded until later in the film.

A scene is added between 1.3 and 1.4, where Richard meets James Tyrrell. As Tyrrell feeds the pigs rotten apples, Richard asks Tyrrell if he can confide in him.

Act 1, Scene 4 is split by Richard telling the murders (Tyrrell and one another) to murder Clarence quickly. Film then covers some of 1.3. 25-85 before shifting momentarily to the murders again, who have arrived at the Tower of London.

Film then returns to 1.3.85-110 & 285-320. [Note: Queen Elizabeth speaks some of Margaret's lines, such as those when Margaret warns Buckingham against Richard.]

Scene shifts to 1.4. 104-260. Clarence is in bathtub. Murders dunk Clarence's head under the water while slitting his throat with a knife.

Short scene is added where Richard receives Clarence's broken glasses, a sign that Clarence has been murdered. Another short scene is added to show that Richard does not talk with his wife Anne.

Act 2, Scene 1 is considerably condensed.

Act 2, Scene 2 begins at line 38.

Act 2, Scene 3 is excluded.

Act 2, Scene 4 is largely excluded. (The few parts that remain are considerably altered.)

Instead of Act 2, Scene 4, a short scene is included in which Rivers is stabbed through the chest from under the bed as a woman is (probably) giving him oral sex.

Act 3, Scene 1 is changed and considerably condensed.

Act 3, Scene 2 is greatly condensed.

Act 3, Scene 3 is excluded.

Act 3, Scene 4 is condensed.

Act 3, Scene 5 is condensed.
- Richard views 9x12 inch black and white photos of Hastings' head in a noose. [Recall that in play, Hastings is beheaded.]

Act 3, Scene 6 is excluded.

Act 4, Scene 1 is reduced and included before Act 3, Scene 7.

Act 3, Scene 7 is reduced
- Richard's prayer book is not really a prayer book.
- Richard's two priests are two attractive young ladies.
- Lord Stanley [played by Edward Hardwick] urges Richmond to flee England.

At the end of 3.7, Richard publicly accepts the kingship in front of a massive audience. The scene is very Nazique.
Act 4, Scene 1 is greatly reduced.

Between 4.1 and 4.2 while traveling in an automobile, Anne injects herself with a needle. [One gains the impression that Anne is a drug addict.]

Act 4, Scene 2 is slightly condensed.
- For example, Richard calls Tyrrell right away rather than relying on a page. [Also, unlike in the text of the play, Richard already knows Tyrrell at this point.]

Act 4, Scene 3 is slightly condensed.
- Princes are suffocated.
- It appears that Richard admits that he is going to kill Anne. [Note: In the text of the play, one does not really know whether Anne just died or if Richard was the cause.]

Act 4, Scene 4 is relatively condensed (begins around line 145)

Act 4, Scene 5 is slightly condensed.

Act 5, Scene 1 contains only line 1 before Buckingham is strangled to death.

Act 5, Scene 2 is eliminated.

Act 5, Scene 3 is slightly condensed.

Act 5, Scene 4 is eliminated.

Act 5, Scene 5 is largely eliminated
- Ghosts do not visit Richard. Instead, Richard, as he dreams, hears the accusatory words of those he had wronged.
- Unlike in text of play, Ratcliffe appears genuinely loyal to Richard.
- Richard's forces are surprised attacked by Richmond's forces.
- Richard and Richmond get into gunfire fight with one another, exchanging bullets.
- Richard commits suicide by jumping off a building, just before Richmond can shoot him with a pistol.

155523,5,0792844041,"Richard III / 0792844041

For various reasons, I didn't realize that this version of Richard III was an adaptation to the 1930's until the DVD menu screen popped up and the iconic 30's music started up. After getting over my initial surprise, I was skeptical - I'm actually extremely fond of Shakespeare adaptations, but this seemed over-the-top. I'm happy to say, however, that I was wrong - this is a wonderful adaptation, with a few minor limitations.

First of all, I'd like to note that this movie does not have any captions, which *really* frustrated me. If you're hard of hearing or just unused to Shakespearean English, that alone might make the movie hard to follow. We had to back up the DVD on several occasions to catch words that were slightly mumbled or garbled, but in general this wasn't a noticeable problem.

Secondly, the acting is truly superb. Ian McKellen is always wonderful, of course, but he does an absolutely terrific job of portraying the villain as Richard is written in the play, while still providing the charisma to lend credence to Lady Anne's agreement to marriage, and the general failure to catch on to Richard's plotting and schemes. The supporting cast, too, is superb, and it's hard to imagine a better acted version of this wonderful play.

As for the adaptation, I thought Shakespearean dialogue over a 1930's setting might be jarring, but for the most part the super-imposition is clean and satisfying. Quite possibly the only time I felt jarred out of the adaptation was during Richard's notable cry for a horse - uttered from atop a stalled jeep sporting a large, mounted gun. Such moments are very few, however, and this adaptation is deeply enjoyable and worth a look.

I should note, though, that this movie does sport some mild violence and frightening scenes, so if you're looking to introduce youths to Shakespeare, this might not be your first choice - but then the original play wasn't particularly muted or cheery either.

It was okay, but I'm not crazy about it.  The interpretation itself was serviceable:  as Richard gets more and more evil, the set takes on the trappings of an overtly fascist state.  Nice visuals, but I'm not sure what more can be made of this:  I submit the circumstances that enabled the depredations of this foul toad and those which installed the mustachioed one in 1933 are only superficially similar, so I'm not sure what deeper point can legitimately be made.

Part of the problem with Richard III, I have always felt, lies not in interpretations and actors, but in Shakespeare's text itself.  Richard's hijinks are so kooky (e.g., hitting on Ms. Neville as she accompanies the corpse of her husband) that they border on the comical, so it's hard to take the play seriously.  It probably should have been a comedy.  But after you get about halfway in, the laughs have stopped and it's a just one dreary chronicle of vile deeds without relief or apparent purpose.  Not sure what I'm supposed to conclude, other than ""evil is evil"".  And other scenes go on way too long:  e.g., the one where his mother curses him.  Yow!  We got the point pages ago.

Also:  hate to say this, but even the brilliant McKellen was too old for this role.  Oh come on.  The play starts just after the Battle of Tewkesbury, which was in 1871.  At that time, Richard was 18!  Sir McKellen don't look no 18.",1257724800,,1489,4.50561797752809

But even if you are unfamiliar with a more traditional Richard III, you will find this story compelling and exciting.  Richard is one of the Bards worst ""Bad Guys""...a real stinker.  Like Iago in Othello, he must show one face to the public, but in private be ruthless and murderous.  It takes a very strong actor to carry a role like Richard III and Sir Ian is certainly of that caliber.  This film is visually stunning, fast paced and shocking.  It does not have to add anything to the story for shock value, it is all there in the original Shakespeare.  This could be a ""Guy"" film...there are sexual situations, Annette Benning, Robert Downey Jr. and many things blow up.

155527,5,0792844041,"This is a 1995 cut down version of Shakespeare's popular play Richard III.  The condensing of the play and some of the characters was probably not popular with Shakespearean purists and those who are familiar with, and love, the full play.  The setting has also been changed from the last half of the 1400's to about the 1930's and the images strongly and deliberately resemble the nazis of WW2.  The ending has also changed.  Sir Ian McKellen's performance is outstanding and the change of the opening line from a monologue to a speech is brilliantly inspired as is the change of venue when he talks about King Edward bedding other women.  The film's concept was based on a stage production directed by Richard Eyre for the Royal National Theatre, which also starred McKellen. The production was adapted for the screen by McKellen and directed by Richard Loncraine.
The play also stars Annette Bening, Jim Broadbent, Robert Downey Jr., Nigel Hawthorne, Kristin Scott Thomas , Dame Maggie Smith, John Wood and Dominic West.  I have nothing bad to say about this version of the play, other than to state the acting of the two token Americans (Queen Elizabeth and her merged family members) painfully stands out as being over the top.
I think this is a brilliantly clever introduction to Richard III.  The cutting down and re-staging the play means it is instantly understandable and accessible to people who are just starting to expose themselves to Shakespeare's plays.  I would recommend this version of the play to everyone and am very glad to finally be able to purchase it.  I will watch it regularly and commit some of the opening scene to memory.

The 1930's sets, backdrops, and music are over-the-top in their presentation, lending a surreal, supremely fascistic aspect to this history play. It translates well.  McKellen's delivery of Richard's famous lines is spot-on. Watching Maggie Smith is a joy, as usual, and veterans  Kristin Scott Thomas, Edward Hardwicke (better known to Americans as Sherlock Holmes's Watson), and Nigel Hawthorne perform admirably in important supporting roles. On the down side, Annette Bening and Robert Downey, Jr. are almost comically miscast, their presence jarring and shallow.

155532,5,0792844041,"When it comes to updates of the Shakespeare plays , Richard III is probably the best of the lot. While it might seem like an unusual concept to take the classic play of deceit, betrayal, seduction, and cold-blooded murder out of the 1400's and into an alternate history 1930's version of England, the cast and production designs make that concept seem not only believable but so realistic you might find yourself wondering if this could really have happened if events had played out like they do in the film.

Ian McKellen plays the title role, the youngest brother of the royal family of the York's, who is determined to take the throne at whatever cost. McKellen's performance is chilling to say the least. From the moment he is introduced in a classic introduction to the battle sequence at the end of the film, McKellen makes the character of Richard seem to be the most evil villain ever to grace a movie screen as he is able to literally become the character in the vast web of deception via acting like he has no interest in taking the throne. McKellen sells Richard and he grips your attention to where your focus is entirely on him, making the trailer line about Richard being the ""greatest villain of all time"" ring very true and it's a shame that McKellen didn't even get an Oscar nomination for his performance.

Annette Benning plays Queen Elizabeth, the American wife of Richard's brother Edward. Many have complained about Benning in the role for various reasons including the fact that she is American and some question her acting ability. Benning, in my opinion, succeeds in making the idea of an American queen seem realistic and her acting talent matches up against McKellen in every scene the two are in together. Also keep in mind this is an alternate history, so an American queen of England isn't that unfeasible. Robert Downey Jr. plays her brother, Rivers. Rivers disappears about midway trough the film, but for the first half of the film, he is Richard's biggest enemy and his obvious dislike of Richard is evident in Downey's performance and the scene where his character meets his demise is shocking to say the least. Jim Broadbent plays the role of Buckingham, Richard's biggest supporter, with unnerving calm and his conniving attitude makes him almost as big of a villain as Richard. Kristin Scott Thomas is superb as Anne, the widow of one of Richard's victims who eventually falls for Richard and lives long enough to regret it. Her confrontation against Richard in a morgue towards the film's beginning stands out as one of the film's best scenes.

The concept of being updated to the 1930's is no more evident then in the production design. There is no doubt that we are in the 1930's and the filmmakers appear to have gone to great steps to make it evident that this is very much an alternate history. As I am sure others have commented this England is not the England we all know and love. Instead, one constantly gets the feeling that we are instead in a Nazi version of England. Everywhere in the film, in the costumes especially, the aura of Nazi Germany can be felt. Virtually all of Richard's costumes are based off German uniforms of the Nazi era, as are the uniforms worn by his supporters in the film's final half. If anyone doubts the influence of Nazi Germany on this alternate history version of England, look at the rally scene shortly before Richard is crowned. It doesn't take a lot of imagination to realize that this scene is a case of dj vu: it is almost identical to the well known documentary footage we have all seen of Nazi rallies right down to the flags that, while containing a boar instead of the swastika, still makes one think that they're in Nazi Germany.

Also, Trevor Jones score is a must hear. The beautiful song at the beginning of the film sells the idea of the 1930's very well. The score, while at times going out of the 1930's, does the job of keeping the feeling of tension throughout the film and is another example of the talent of Trevor Jones.

The DVD release is a bit of a disappointment though. It's pretty standard fare from MGM with only a theatrical trailer for special features. It's shame considering how good of a film this is that there is no audio commentary or making of documentary.

Few films have the power to hold the attention of a viewer from beginning to end, especially when there is a large amount of dialog. But with the performance given by Ian McKellen, production design, battle sequences, and the score by Trevor Jones, Richard III easily counts not only as a must see but as a modern classic.",1204329600,,4599,4.643734643734644

Now, I realize that I used the word ""broad"" in my title, and while I originally intended it as word-play and to communicate my overall boredom at watching this film, I would be remiss if I didn't comment on what my subconscious wanted to say.  Annette Bening is not a great actress.  She's  not as horrible as Irene Jacob in 'Othello' but she does very little that's good.  Kristin Scott Thomas, however, deserves accolades for her understated performance.

Wonderful idea to set RICHARD III in the 30s, and to parallel his rise to power with the rise of Fascism in Europe.  Somehow, they managed to rise above the obvious, mostly by being so cold-bloodedly realistic about the time, the social class, and Richard's personal nastiness.  The language remains intact, though there are judicious cuts, but the production has the rare distinction of looking like a film, as opposed to a filmed stage play; that's hard to do, but it succeeds very well here.  The result is outrageous.

McKellen is wonderful in every sense of the word, playing everybody's favorite villian; the man you love to hate.  But, but, playing deftly, intelligently, and with taste and a light, sardonic touch.  To my mind, this is one of the few successful film versions of any Shakespeare play, on a level with Orson Welles' OTHELLO for inventiveness and verve; or Olivier's HAMLET, or the Zeferelli SHREW.

155535,3,0792844041,"I had long wanted to see this adaption of one of my favorite plays, intriguingly set in World War I Britain, and thought it would be the perfect way to introduce a friend of mine to Shakespeare. The film begins with great promise, with an exciting opening sequence showing the end of the War of Roses and Henry VI and a thrilling take on Richard's opening monologue. Within thirty minutes, however, the film begins to drag and lacks any driving action throughout. While individual scenes feature stand out performances and excellent use of the language (the immortal Sir Ian shines, of course, as a true master of his art), there are often long breaks between scenes and long periods without dialogue. Just like on the stage, long silences in Shakespeare tend to make the whole thing fall flat and the audience (me, in this case) begins to find it all a bit tedious by Act 4. I tried to remain hopeful, however, as the film seemed to be ramping up to a final showdown, and I was eager to see Sir Ian's deliciously evil Richard get his just reward at last. The ending, when it finally arrives, is jarringly abrupt (cutting the last scene of Shakespeare's play entirely), and so bizarre and unsatisfying that I found myself watching the credits in disbelief.

In general, an example of project with high quality individual elements (a solid cast, a fairly good cutting of the text until the end, and a fascinating concept and setting) that just weren't combined skillfully enough to make the film rise above the level of mediocrity. Those with a love of the play and of Shakespeare in general will find much of it interesting, but, as I discovered, it is not a good choice of a film to win over the Shakespeare disinclined among us.",1175558400,3,1730,4.635179153094462

Although I have never read this Shakespeare, I have read others (Hamlet, Macbeth), I really liked the transition from play to film. McKellen's Richard was totally evil, but interesting to watch.

Ian McKellan's Richard is nice and evil.  For some reason, he's good at these sneaky, twitchy parts, and in this production he lurches around in his fascist uniform like a good (oops, evil) Richard should.  I always wonder why people are taken in by RIchard - he's so transparently wicked.  But I guess that's how they liked their propaganda villains back in the day.  The sets and overall look of the piece are wonderful.",1157587200,2,698,4.672131147540983
155539,3,0792844041,"I enjoy this movie much more than the three stars I give it might suggest. I've watched it several times, and every time I get a great deal of satisfaction from Ian McKellen's performance. He's a gleefully malevolent Richard, by far the best thing about this production. Most of the supporting cast is quite good (with a couple of notable exceptions), the costumes and sets are beautiful, the technical quality of the production and the DVD are quite good.

The movie is, as you surely know, a production of one of Shakespeare's greatest tragedies set in a 1930s sort of England. Richard is certainly one of Shakespeare's most interesting characters - far more interesting than that Danish twit, Hamlet, as malevolent as Iago but occupying the central position in the play (""Othello"" is a wonderful play, but one can only wonder how much more wonderful it would be if Shakespeare had named it ""Iago"" and banished the Moor to the play's fringes as he does to Clarence in ""Richard III"") - MacBeth and his Lady pumped up on evil steroids. The play is, of course, Tudor propaganda (it's likely that Richard didn't really kill his nephews, but at any rate he was quite a decent king, and royal nephews of that age never had any reason to expect much good from their uncles anyway), but the shade of the real Richard should be glad that Shakespeare didn't simply make of him a villain, but one of the most interesting and vital villains in all literature. I'd be honored to be slandered as Richard is if in the process I were made to seem half so interesting.

So why only three stars? First (and least importantly), Anette Bening as Edward's Queen Elizabeth is, in my opinion pretty weak, and Robert Downey Jr. as her brother makes her performance look brilliant by comparison. Neither one should share the screen with McKellen, though when they do he treats them with an entirely appropriate and magnificent contempt. They're there to be devoured by him, but they should be substantial and meaty morsels; instead, they're a couple of cheetohs. Second, as good as McKellen is in this film, his performance is too jokey, his character too extravagant in his evil. It's impossible to believe that Clarence or Edward could trust him (unless Clarence and Edward are both royal imbeciles) or that he could successfully woo Lady Anne (in a morgue, over the body of her dead husband who Richard has freshly killed). Too woo a lady you've just made a widow takes extraordinary tact and charm, and not the charm of a merry demon. The only believable response from Lady Anne to Richard's proposal in this film would be to scream and run. McKellen's Richard is just too over the top. Third, the 1930s setting, a potentially interesting conceit, becomes instead a ham-fisted commentary on fascism. The adoption of black uniforms by Richard's entourage, Richard's moustache, the red banners with white circles and a black boar's head in the center - it all beats one over the head. Shakespeare wrote these characters as real people, and the film maker works valiantly to turn them into caricatures. They deserve better. Evil may be banal, but Richard certainly is not, and there's nothing more banal that turning a villain into Hitler.

I'd just love to see the actors in this film (excepting Bening and Downey) reprise their roles in a more traditional version, with McKellen just a bit more subdued. This version is fun and entertaining, but it manages to do something that I would have thought was impossible to do to the source material - it makes it merely fun and entertaining.  Yes, by all means watch it, and even buy it. I'm glad I did. It's much more than a guilty pleasure, but it's much less than it should be.",1155254400,5,3704,4.737984496124031
155540,4,0792844041,"William Shakespeare's ""Richard III"" was one of his earlier plays. (Possibly the 6th of his 37) But it has held the stage virtually since its creation. Giving you a brief rundown of the events leading up to this play, Henry IV of Lancaster seized the crown from Richard II. Henry IV did have some trouble due to his shady seizure of the crown, but he held onto the crown and his son Henry V succeeded him. Henry V is most known for his rapid conquest of France. Then came his son Henry VI. While Henry VI was pious and benevolent, the house of York rose against him. (Hence the War of the Roses) Despite York's death, his sons (the eventual Edward IV) and (the eventual Richard III) defeated Henry VI. (Hence, the opening of this movie.)

The War of the Roses is paused, but not exactly over. This is one of Shakespeare's longest plays, and overall, these people did a good job of fitting it into 2 hours. (To be sure, there were some things I missed, such as the curses from Henry VI's widow Margaret, and the 11 ghosts that haunt Richard III, and the speech that Henry VII makes ending the War of the Roses.) But it is still a great movie.

Taking Shakespeare's plays out of their time does not always work. But in this case, the modernization only intensifies the brutality and terror of this situation. Ian McKellan is nothing short of magnificent as the Gloucester who plots, plans, and murders his way to the crown. When his brother Edward (who happened to be Henry VIII's grandfather and Elizabeth's great grandfather) becomes king, Richard wastes little time in plotting his moves.

From the start, Richard makes an ally of Buckingham. Richard begins with murder of his older brother Clarence. (One thing I missed from the play is how Clarence's prison guard showed some pity when Clarence spoke of his nightmares.) After the death of Clarence, the moderately benevolent Edward IV (played fairly well by Wood) dies leaving his 12 year old son Edward and his 9 year old son Richard in the evil Richard of Gloucester's care. Anette Benning plays Edward IV's widow (and King Henry VIII's grandmother) convincingly.

One by one, Richard's enemies 'disappear.' While Hastings's death is only mentioned in the play, it is done on screen with in a most chilling way. Eventually we come to the crime most associated with Richard. (The murder of his 12 and 9 year old nephews.) While Richard III was innocent of many of the crimes Shakespeare places on him, he was undoubtedly guilty of this horrible murder. And that one horrible double murder, made it possible for Shakespeare to convincingly pile upon Richard a slew of vile deeds of which Richard was innocent. (Talk about 1 rotten apple spoiling the whole bunch!) Even Richard's friend Buckingham bolts at this. (Quite possibly he did in history as well!)

Maggie Smith gets kudos for the rages of Richard III's insane driven mother. It is of course an exaggeration when the director has Richard appear similar to Hitler, (with the flags, the screams, and the mustache), but the director probably could not resist.

One major difference between this movie and the play is that in the play, we don't see Richmond (Henry VII) until the final act. In the movie, we see the eventual Henry VII from the start. (In history, he was of course hiding in France until he felt the time was right.) Dominic West does a nice job as the eventual Henry VII. One nice bonus is that we see the wedding of the eventual Henry VII to Elizabeth of York.

Young Elizabeth doesn't talk much, but she has the one scene where she shows sorrow over her dead father well. The final battle between Richard and the eventual Henry VII is also done well. As I said, I did miss Henry VII's speech that ends the War of the Roses, but overall, the director and actors did a GREAT JOB.",1152662400,,3803,4.6251851851851855

Ian McKellen's performance is top notch.

The supporting cast, minus Annette Bening and Robert Downey Jr. is first rate as well.

I generally find productions of Operas and Shakespeare cast into post period settings as coming across as structurally contrived and the settings themselves as an overall distraction rather than an enhancement. Pleasingly, Richard III works well and is the exception to the rule. The pseudo fascist garb, aristocratic thirties social venues and bleak industrial backdrops are interesting and blend well with the drama.

Downey's performance is of such little consequence that I guess they just threw him in for box office appeal.

Annette Bening is flat, almost without depth. I would've thought a British trained actress of her stature to register something special. Oh well.

The pacing is a bit frenetic. I don't feel that they give the audience time to digest what was being said. Of course, that said, it is very difficult to successfully translate Shakespeare to the screen for an audience that has the attention span of a house fly. These days I feel lucky that any productions of Shakespeare are filmed with a first rate cast and director. This one, with a few minor exceptions, is a success",1142380800,3,1252,5.024154589371981

155547,5,0792844041,"Ian McKellan played Richard III on the stage in London, then touring the world, under Richard Eyre's direction and the Royal National Theatre of Great Britain's auspices. Like many great productions of Richard III in the past, there was an anticlimactic sense about things when the lengthy run ended - McKellan compares his production (justifiably) to those of Henry Irving and David Garrick, but longs for the lasting legacy of Laurence Olivier, who translated his successful stage production into a lasting cinematic production. Richard Eyre issued the challenge to McKellan to produce a screenplay, which he did, in collaboration with Richard Loncraine.  Loncraine then produced the film, again starring Ian McKellan as Richard III, updated into a National-Socialist timeframe.

It is true that Shakespeare is the 'author' of Richard III - of course, much of Shakespeare's authoring involved heavy borrowing, redaction and crafting. This is not to take anything away from Shakespeare's achievement, but rather to prove the adage 'good writers borrow from others; great writers steal from them outright'. However, every production of a Shakespeare play requires modification of some sort; bringing Shakespeare productions to the screen (indeed, bringing any stage-play to the screen) requires a recrafting to suit the medium. McKellan and Loncraine rearranged and edited expertly the play to suit a film.

Richard III has been an enigmatic and controversial character - Shakespeare's play is probably more in keeping with Tudor propaganda against Richard III (from whom they took the throne) rather than actual history; Richard's malformed physical form and malicious character may be fictions, or at least great exaggerations, designed to serve the purpose of bolstering Tudor legitimacy. McKellan points out (a theory not unique to him, by any means) that the Tudors had as much to gain from the disappearance of the princes in the tower as Richard himself; had they survived and been recognised as heirs of the throne, Tudor legitimacy would have been much less credible.

McKellan's Richard has disability physically, but the real deformity is of the will and the spirit.  The Prussian-inspired military garb of this production hints at but also hides his physical disability for the most part.  There is no real hump, stammer or limp that many portrayals of Richard might have.

McKellan describes the decision to update the tale of Richard III into more modern times as one to provide clarity of narrative. Indeed, for this production, Richard is seen as a storm-trooper similar to the militant cadres of Germany in the 1930; his grasp for power is very similar in tone to the rise to dictatorship of any number of fascist leaders, but the Nuremberg-Rally character of Richard's accession leaves little doubt as to the parallel. On stage and screen, in a drama such as these, people need to be readily identified in their roles; Elizabethan dress (or earlier dress) is confusing to the modern eye, but the difference between costuming for military, aristocracy, etc. in the modern time is readily identifiable. The exact historical situation is not directly relevant - given that Richard III already takes liberties with the actual history of the time, why not take more in the name of accessibility to the audience?

Richard III had to be cut to make it on the screen, in order to be turned into a visual rather than auditory experience, given the sensibilities of modern cinema-goers.  McKellan and Loncraine originally wanted to film around the Houses of Parliament, but for various political reasons that idea was quashed.  They used the Parliament building in Budapest, modeled after the Westminster building, and did so to great effect.

McKellan certainly steals the show here, but there are worthwhile briefer performances by the late Nigel Hawthorne, Robert Downey Jr., John Wood, and Annette Bening.  Maggie Smith, as the mother of Edward IV and Richard III, turns in a stunning performance as usual, nearly upstaging the other actors in every scene in which she appears.

The music is serviceable, useful as a backdrop but never really stands out.  This is appropriate to Shakespeare, even up-dated, 'postmodern' Shakespeare, in which the play's the thing.  The visuals help to pull the story along, but in true Shakepearean mode, the dialogue and acting are the driving forces here, and they succeed brilliantly.",1120176000,27,4432,5.240112994350283
155548,5,0792844041,"Ian McKellen does an incredible job creating one of the most despicable characters ever on stage. There are lots of other good roles played, but McKellen's Richard dominated every scene.

The scenes supported him well, too. The script translated smoothly into a fictionalized London, somewhere between the two World Wars. This worked exceptionally well in a few places. For one, it was the last period when horse were still in common use. Without that fact, ""My kingdom for a horse"" would have fallen flat. It was also around the time when Hitler was starting to come to power, even if only later history knew what that truly meant. The director used that double anachronism with frightening effect, covering Richard in the uniforms and militaristic pageantry of that evil time.

I have to admit, this is not a play I know very well in any other presentation. It's not a part of English history that I know, either. In other words, I'm not a person who would normally have been drawn to this play. It drew me, though, and drew me in. Perhaps some absolute purist would only let this script be played in its native period - I am glad that the director did not suffer such narrowness of vision.

This is an exceptional staging of Richard III. It's the one to pick if you have a reluctant viewer. The British actors handle the language beautifully (even if some of the Americans don't), and the visual presentation is flawless.

Being German, I am quite sensitive when it comes to Nazi decorations and images. However, after reading loads of secondary literature on Richard III, I realized how close the image of Richard in Shakespeare's time was to our image of Hitler. The fact that Richard is a perfect Machiavelli-Charakter reveals best in this version and one can easily feel the terror that developed in the British's minds during Richard's rule. Still, there is a trace of sympathy which you will eventually feel for the character of the 'hunchback'. This shows a bit how little certain we can be whether Richard III actually was an evil man or whether he was only made an evil man by historians...

Locraine directed a very unusual version of this well known Shakespeare's tragedy in the middle of the War.

This Shakesperian rapture brights all along with lighting grandness, showing us once more that Shakespeare's gaze is nowadays, more actuallized than ever.

The human being just only has changed the medium of making the war but in what the basic instincts who feed his soul and thoughts keep absolutely intact. And that is not precisely an aspect to be proud but it reveals by itself the huge ethic deficit we still have.

Watch for this fabulous and ravishing stage. Ian Mc Kellen is splendid for this role, making us to forget by brief moments the colossal and much more classic approach of Olivier of 1955.",1115856000,,828,4.892857142857143
155551,4,0792844041,"Few things in entertainment can be more deceptively sure than a remake, ""re-envisioning"", or an otherwise re-interpretation of a classic. In film particularly so.

An example: George A. Romero brought to screen *Dawn of the Dead*, part II of a classic horror trilogy filled with blunt but entertaining satire on American commercialism. 25 years later Zack Snyder and screenwriter Peter Gunn created their own ""Dawn of the Dead"": it is actually an Americanized remake of Danny Boyle's *28 Days Later *, resembling Romero's film primarily in title and cameos. Because Snyder and Gunn synthesize just about every horror movie of the past thirty years into a 97 minute MTV music video, it is wildly popular. But neither Romero's story nor his theme survives, and I really don't like it.

The same has been said for film renditions of plays. No Shakespeare expert, I am dimly aware of the curmudgeon opinion that the best celluloid translations of the Bard's great works were those filmed when color was an expensive novelty and televisions hadn't left the laboratory. So when somebody in the 1990's comes along and attempts to modernize a play written before America had seen its first English setters, there's sure to be some criticism.

Fortunately, for my tastes at least, Sir Ian McKellen and director Richard Loncraine come through where many other filmmakers fail. They manage to update a classic work while maintaining at least a ghost of the original ideas. All heil the deformed fury of *Richard III*.

<Rise of the Edwardian Reich>

Fascism seems to suit this play. Sir McKellen and Mr. Loncraine marry Bill's black drama of medieval British power play to the English fascist movements. Mixed with the assassination-fever that rocked Imperial Japan shortly before World War II, and an amazing collection of wartime weapons, costumes, and sets, the film is as poisonous as it is mesmerizing.

Indeed, even today's Americans may be put off by all the Nazis speaking the Bard's tongue. Attacking Shakespearean English royalty with Soviet tanks and Mauser handguns is certainly anachronistic--even absurd. To British WWII historians, though, this film may stir echoes of Sir Oswald Mosley and his British Union of Fascists. A Parliament politician (1918-1930) he amassed an army of some 30,000 followers by 1934. One famous disciple was ""Lord Haw-Haw"": Anglo-American William Joyce who defected to Nazi Germany and broadcast pro-Nazi propaganda. The filmmaker's style, then, is not without substance.

<Der Shakespeare>

`Course, I know my WWII better than my British plays. Still, I checked out a paperback copy of Will's *The Life and Death of King Richard III* after I saw this film. So far as I can tell, McKellen and crew cut, mixed, and pasted swaths of prose to account for Shakespeare's language while using exclusively non-verbal references to the airplanes and radios buzzing around the characters. The makers do so best at the beginning. Richard Gloster's opening soliloquy is repeated intact here, but with a few simple zooms and cuts, the picture dramatically demonstrates that film can both match and enhance the power of a revered playwright's hallowed prose.

Unlike the Bard, the filmmakers lovingly depict the consequences of Richards' ire. No marching prisoners off stage here: McKellen follows the aforementioned murder festival of Japan's pre-war hierarchy. *Richard III* gives us switchblades and shanks, cut throats and backstabbed bellies. Dukes strangle while Prime Ministers hang. Around it all ring the shots and bounce the shell casings of just about every automatic weapon made between 1900 and 1945. There's a reason for that ""R"" rating.

I'm sure pacing reasons exist for some of the plot switching, but the film may throw off those more familiar with the play than me. Sir Ratcliffe is as murderous and complicit as anyone in the original. Here Ratcliffe is a glorified squire, standing by to the end like a male Eva Braun to McKellen's Hitlerian Richard. It's Sir Tyrrel-here a common soldier-who eagerly takes all wet work. Played by Adrian Dunbar, Tyrrel makes Himmler proud as he butchers his way through Royalty as much for personal pleasure as for the favor of his Lord Protector. Necessarily then, the film sequences of murder switch around from the play-which pretty much means every other major scene I am aware of also changes, the 1930s setting aside .Characters whom Shakespeare slaughters survive here, while McKellen kills off kin who lived.

<The Triumph of the Will>

Lest I frighten anyone off, the violence is as tastefully done as far as one can use that word for ""R"" films. Some scenes are beautiful in their fatal simplicity: a red scarf falling into the camera, darkness, then looking down upon the form of a gasping face pressed against the crimson fabric--Tyrrel strikes again. The film's cinematography is no mere showcase for circuses anymore than it is self-indulgent art house expression: it is as murderously savvy, as corrosively charismatic as its' titular villain.

Sure: it digs jackboots and smog stained brick walls; and likes Cold War tanks mixing it up with World War II halftracks, while Robert Downy Jr. tries to bring 1930's American playboy cheek into a 16th Century British Royal Family (a brave attempt to account for the New World in Shakespeare--but as Queen Elizabeth's brother?). While it's no more the original play than any other film translation, in my opinion McKellan's *Richard III* reflects the plot and thematic essentials, more or less preserving the characters and the scope--unlike some recent ""remakes"" I have mentioned.

McKellen and company at least in places show that Shakespeare can be modernized in sight while preserved in speech. It is a worthy addition to the Bard's filmography, from my Generation X perspective.

DVD Note: It looks and sounds like a decent video transfer, but comes on one of those annoying dual-sided disks (not to be confused with dual layer) for widescreen and full screen editions.",1092960000,3,6006,5.145641025641026
155552,3,0792844041,"Three stars for courage. But, for me, it didn't work. Shakespeare's play is cut to the bone. The struggle to find adequate 1930s parallels to the extreme convolutions of the Wars of the Roses (all concerned with hereditary power), and the rise and fall of the Bard's version of Richard Crookback, is just too much. There is certainly a tendency, in general, for history to repeat itself, but attempting to combine Hitler, Mussolini, Franco, Stalin, Oswald Mosley (for all of whom hereditary power was completely irrelevant), and the Duke of Windsor, into the mythical figure of Richard of Gloucester, is misguided, to say the least. Much of the point of the play lies in the fact that Richard was systematically murdering his nearest family members. This resembles the modern Middle East far more than pre-World War II Europe. Incidentally, the setting is NOT Nazi Germany, Edwardian England, nor WWI, nor did the actual historical events take place only ""a hundred years earlier"", as one reviewer seems to think. Much of the film was shot inside and outside the Brighton Pavilion --- hardly Art Deco! Another major objection to this production and its version of the original script (which was not ""a novel""!) is that it appears to be driven by a desire to be as unlike Olivier's stunning interpretation as it possibly could. In fact, it is haunted by Olivier's film, in a highly negative way: this counterpoint motivation destroys its integrity, since it is not basing its thrust on the words Shakespeare wrote. I just couldn't take the sight of McKellen sitting in a jeep, and bawling out: ""My kingdom for a horse!"" One reviewer has pointed out that Richard's seduction of the Lady Anne is probably the most impossible scene that Bill ever penned. Yet Olivier, because he makes Richard so incredibly fascinating, repulsive and compelling, and almost understandable and pathetic at the same time, delivers it in a manner that will probably never be equalled for theatrical bravado. McKellen is simply repellent, and the seduction couldn't be less convincing. The psychology of Richard's bitterness at his physical malformation --- ""sent into this breathing world scarce half made up"" --- is not sufficiently stressed by McKellen, so he cannot elicit any sympathy for his villainy from the audience. The idea that the characters smoke so much in order to symbolise the fogginess of their words is interesting. However, in any film from the 30s and 40s, with a contemporary setting, the characters smoke practically all the time. In fact, King George VI, as decent a king as ever lived, died from lung cancer brought on by cigarettes. As another perceptive reviewer remarked, the intensity of the design of the costumes and settings, while extremely impressive, tended to overwhelm everything else on the screen. As noted, that seems to be the dominant trend in most film-making these days. All design and very little substance. In fact the complete opposite of any Shakespeare play, where the plot and the words are everything, and the scenery is completely irrelevant. The only modern film-maker who manages to combine brilliant dialogue with matching sets is Tarantino: he actually writes like Shakespeare. It's blank verse, not prose.",1091836800,19,3238,5.076923076923077

  In this one little bit of dialog, they manage to concisely describe the temptation of Christ -- ultimately, he was not tempted to do evil, but rather to do good, which would none-the-less have precluded him from being the saviour. Would you have ever expected this from an X-Men movie?

155554,5,0792844041,"Ian' McKellen's amazing adaptation of Shakespeare's ""Richard III"" shows just how good Shakespeare can be, even for a modern audience that is not trained in the Shakespearean vocabulary.
Directed by Richard Loncraine, and adapted from his triumphant stage production, this ""Richard III"" is set in a pseudo-Nazi-era England, and the Wars of the Roses are seemingly set as the preliminary days of WWII.  In a great opening scene, Richard leads the forces of his brother, King Edward IV (John Wood), to victory over the rebel forces -- following a tank smashing through a fireplace and planting a bullet in his rival's head, all the while breathing through a gas mask like a 20th-century Darth Vader.
The royal family is seemingly happy, ""Now is the winter of our discontent, made glorious summer . . .""  But Richard is a villain -- in a wonderful soliloquy that starts as a homage to his kingly brother but evolves into a private rant in a bathroom, Richard confesses that he is a villain.  ""Plots have I laid!""
Capitalizing on the trust given him by his brothers, Richard sets off on a mad quest for power that sees him arrange for the murder of his brother, seduce the widow of his dead rival (""Was ever woman in this humor wooed?  Was ever woman in this humor won?""), and ultimately seize the throne.  But for Richard the quest for power is the game -- he seems happiest when winning but almost morose having won his prize.  He wins a bride but ignores her.  He wins the throne but does not enjoy it, and seems to go out of his way to find others to seduce, including Elizabeth (Annette Benning, in dubious casting, but she gives it a good shot), and men to kill, such as Anthony (Robert Downey, Jr., proving once again that he can do just about anything).
In addition to the American cast members (McKellen succeeded in not casting too many Americans in an effort to create box office, unlike Kenneth Branagh in his full-length ""Hamlet""), ""Richard III"" has the usual cast of recognizable British actors -- Nigel Hawthorne (Clarence), Kirsten Scott Thomas (Lady Anne), Maggie Smith (Duchess of York), and Jim Broadbent (Buckingham).
Spinning this tale of murder and corruption in a Nazi-esque England was pure genius -- Richard's murderous successes gain a momentum that is reminiscent of Hitler's and Stalin's respective power grabs, and we get a true sense of danger from Richard's ascension.  (Plus it allows for some great costumes!)  It is chilling to watch the dominoes fall, one after the other, just as Richard has planned.
Of course, we know that all ends well and that Richard is defeated, but his fall has never been so perfectly staged.  Refusing to be captured by Henry, Earl of Richmond (Dominic West), Richard climbs out onto some rickety ironwork.  In a nice, but surprising editorial choice, Richard throws out a line that is not in Shakespeare's play -- ""Let's to it pell-mell; if not to heaven, then hand in hand to hell.""  He leaps into a raging inferno below him, and the camera tracks him down, his beaming visage showing that Richard is dying just as he lived -- as a villain in love with his own villainy. Al Jetson's ""I'm Sitting On Top of the World"" is the perfect icing on the cake.
What a gas!  Shakespeare has given us one of theater's great experiences -- watching a man who loves being bad be about as bad as you can get.

The language threw me at first (I believe they kept almost all of Shakespeare's original dialect) but it seems so natural in this film. It was a great cast, with Maggie Smith as the grieving queen mother, who has to see and face her son, knowing the awful things he does, things he doesn't even deny.

155557,4,0792844041,"The greatest aspect of this film is its look.  With extravagant costumes and glorious set designs, there is ambitious detail in every scene.  The problem with a film looking this gorgeous is that many of the performances are often overwhelmed with the color and sparkling detail surrounding them.  As a result, only two performances stand out.  Annette Bening has seldom behaved so furious in any of her other roles, and it was a breath of fresh air to see any of the characters fight back against the tyranny and betrayal of Richard III.  Her performance is excellent, and glows accordingly.  The other great performance is, of course, Ian McKellen and his diabolical and just plain evil portrayal of the title character.  He oozes with lust and is oftentimes disgusting to look at as a result.  This is another notable performance in a long list of superb roles for Ian McKellen.  There is a small role for Maggie Smith which she relishes, yet she has only one fantastic scene where she reprimands her son Richard for being the foul human being that he has become.  I thought she was going to spit.  The rest of the cast is either forgettable or wasted.  Kristin Scott Thomas has the famous scene with Ian McKellen where Richard III woos her character while she mourns her husband's death.  She knows full well that is was Richard who killed her husband. I have never been able to believe this scene, regardless of the performances.  If she truly loved her husband as much as she says, and loathes Richard with as much passion, she could never be tempted to either forgive his actions let alone lay them aside and go to his bedchamber.  Surely, she is in a weakened state, and perhaps susceptible to persuasion, but that is simply too much to ask.  Robert Downey Jr. has a throwaway performance.  He is a great actor, but the role he has here is limited and really could have been portrayed by any decent actor.  Overall, the film is gorgeous to look at, and is certainly worth watching for the grand acting of Ian McKellen and Annette Bening.",1082419200,2,2045,4.649025069637883
155558,4,0792844041,"I had to watch this film for a class, and going into it I had no idea that Ian McKellen had acted in any film interpretations of Shakespearean classics, let alone write the screenplays for such interpretations.  During the opening credits, my perception of McKellen was severely changed, and I began to look forward to the film I had been secretly dreading all day.
 Loncraine and McKellen's ""Richard III"" takes place in England in a more modern day setting.  England doesn't appear to be a peaceful country controlled by democracy, but more of a fascist nation ruled by a power-hungry aristocracy.  The opening scene alone is reminiscent of World War II and a Nazi regime, and this theme continues throughout the movie.  Personally, I think the Nazi theme may have been a bit overdone, and the coronation scene, to me, seemed to be an insult on the audience's intelligence.  Rather than just allowing the audience to make their own comparisons between Richard's rise to power and Nazi Germany, we see incontrovertible evidence that Richard represents Hitler, even down to the close-up of his Hitler-esque moustache.  However, I don't think this was the most major theme in the movie, despite the constant reminders.
 Throughout the film, almost all the main characters constantly smoked.  There was a lot of smoking, even for English aristocracy.  It seems that every time Richard was shown, he was either smoking a cigar or chain smoking cigarettes.  However, he wasn't the only character that seemed to have a horrible addiction for nicotine; almost every character was constantly smoking.  I think the director was trying to portray the deception and lies that were involved in the play itself by the constant smoke coming out of each characters mouth.  Every word Richard said was either followed by or preceded by a smokescreen, and often times his face was partially hidden behind a cloud of smoke.  Richard didn't simply smoke; he also provided cigarettes for other people.  I'm pretty sure I remember him giving a cigar or cigarette to Buckingham, and possibly to Tyrell as well.  To me, this reinforces the idea that Richard and his friends relied on deception and murder as their way of solving problems.
 Overall, I enjoyed the film a lot, the decisions the director and writers made to change Tyrell's character and to cut some of the play seemed to make sense.  I liked how Richard's asides, for the most part, were strictly between the audience and Richard; McKellen would look directly at the camera to enforce a sense of intimacy with the words he was saying, even though this technique is pretty unpopular in current films.  My favorite part of the movie was probably the final scene - Richard's death.  It was shocking and brilliant...Richard falling into flames was very hellish, and the upbeat music that accompanied his death reminded me that his death was beneficial to England and that things were looking up at the end of the play and movie despite the tragic nature of the ending.",1069372800,10,3006,4.914851485148515
155559,3,0792844041,"My husband bailed out when the singer started in on ""Come Live with Me..."" I stayed with the film and enjoyed the fun. There's not much sense of the sad history of the Lancaster-York rivalry, with the original sin of the deposition and murder of Richard II leading in an almost fatalistic way to rebellion, wars, and cold-blooded murders, all the way down to the innocent victims in the Tower. (For that, go to the BBC version.) That's a quibble, however; this is a ""variation on a theme,"" and I can't quarrel with the simplifications.  What I mind more is the loss of so much of the poetry. But if Clarence is going to be interpreted as a kindly, inept soul, ""False, fleeting, perjur'd Clarence"" has to go. Giving the lords' line ""How have you slept, my lord?"" to Elizabeth of York the morning after is a little bizarre, but it works in the context.

Annette Bening, even with an American accent, is spectacular as the strong-willed Queen Elizabeth. Likewise, Robert Downey Jr. is forceful but grossly underused as the queen's brother Rivers: he really deserves a Shakespearean film of his own. Maggie Smith has a small part as Richard's mother that she makes the most of despite the fact that she and Ian McKellan seem too close in age to be a mother and son. Kristin Scott Thomas, as Richard's wife, stands around and looks gorgeous, but delivering her lines while smoking a cigarette doesn't make her a great actress.

To quell the outraged Bard purists, I'll admidt this is just one way of viewing the film: Richard III is a brilliant play per se and any version with Ian McKellen would be welcome. But watching the Duke of York's humourously cackling villiany in the setting oif an alternate fascist 30s Britain is sheer joy...this classic tale adapts well to its Moseleyesque sets and design, which threaten to dwarf a nonetheless brilliant cast (even the Americans are excellent - no xenophobia implied, but the accents you guys have don't always cut it in English drama). The music is perfect also, jaunty 30s big band jazz and the climax sees Bosworth replaced by Battersea Power Station, which is sheer genius...'My kingdon for a horse,' yells Sir Ian, clutching his machine pistol like the blackguard he is.
Aside from the superb speculative setting, worthy of comparison with the great alternative history SF novels (Pavane, The Alteration, The Man In The High Castle, Bring The Jubilee), McKellen himself is brilliant, projecting the black humour of Richard's cartoon nastinness superbly, capering and grinning like the mad anti-Quasimodo he is.

155566,5,0792844041,"Set in an alternate reality version of 1930s Great Britain, this updating of ""Richard III"" works brilliantly. Though it cuts out nearly half the original play, none of its power is lost. Famous scenes are reworked in the most interesting ways. Some would argue that the changes reduce Shakespeare to populist entertainment, but it should be remember that the Bard's most loyal audience members were, in fact, the masses. If he were alive today, I imagine this most innovative playwright would find traditional stagings of his plays to be often a bit creaky.
The great Ian McKellan, who also starred in the revisionist stage version, is astounding as The Duke of Gloucester / Richard III. This most monstrous of Shakespeare's characters plots the demise of almost the entire royal family in his relentless quest to be king, and McKellan plays him to the hilt. ""Richard III"" is not so much a tragedy as it is a melodramatic thriller with comic overtones. Richard is no noble character overcome by one fatal flaw. This guy is bad to the bone and knows it. What makes it all so interesting is that only he and the audience knows just how dangerous he is. He has almost all his victims convinced that he's a benign cripple. Even his co-conspirators in rebellion don't understand his power.
The dream cast also includes Maggie Smith, Nigel Hawthorne, Jim Broadbent, Kirsten Scott Thomas, Annette Bening and Robert Downey Jr. A great deal of the credit for the successful transition of the stage version into a film also goes to cinematographer Peter Biziou, production designer Tom Burrough, and art directors Richard Bridgland and Choi Ho Man.

Ian McKellen deserves special honors for his portrayal of Richard III as both ruthless and oddly sympathetic. We can't help, but wonder, for example, if Richard's lust for power isn't the result of the lack of affection from his mother. The actor who played Buckingham was well-cast--talk about the ""banality of evil"". Kristin Scott Thomas gives a very fine performance as the tragic Lady Anne. Her portrayal of Anne as a woman who turns to drugs to escape her unhappy marriage gave the character a lot of motivation for her actions that is missing in the play. One of the things that is mentioned in the play, but really comes across on screen is the inability of the women, in a world when matters of life and death are decided by men, to protect their loved ones. Elizabeth Woodville (Annette Bening) is a devoted mother, but she is helpless to prevent the imprisonment and assassination of her two young sons. Robert Downing, Jr., by the way, does a nice turn as Elizabeth's good-natured, but dissolute brother, Rivers. The only thing I missed from the film was the mention of Owen Tudor which occurs at the end of the play. Tudor is a minor but important character because the irony of the whole play--the civil war, the in-fighting between families--is that a complete outsider (Owen) will eventually triumph and found the Tudor dynasty.",1018828800,6,1642,4.764912280701754

This when even today one has to look around the world and see the tyrannies and dictatorships that still exist in the Third World and elsewhere",1000771200,,1228,4.93719806763285

The first line of Shakespeare's ""Richard III,"" spoken by Sir Ian McKellen approximately 10 minutes into the movie, sets the tone for this unusual telling of the tale.  Shakespeare's drama is set in England ... but not an England that you might know.  This is England as it might have appeared if the Fascist sympathizers had come into power.  Interestingly enough, the politics are very similar to the Wars of the Roses, so this odd juxtaposition works incredibly well.
The casting is, of course, superb.  McKellen is delightfully wicked as Richard.  Annette Benning makes a superbly sympathetic Elizabeth Woodville.  I found all of the players to be quite credible in their roles.
An interesting aside for Shakespearean scholars:  the song being performed at the movie's opening by the chanteuse at the ball is ""The Passionate Shephered to His Love,"" which was written by Christopher Marlowe.  Marlowe is one of the frequently-named possibilities as the true author of the Shakespearean catalog.
Overall, this is one of the best performances of ""Richard III"" that I have seen.  For admirers of Shakespeare, Ricardians who want to investigate every possible performance or book concerning the last Plantagenet king, or for historians with an interest in either the present or the past era, this is a film not to be missed.",996019200,4,1365,5.058035714285714
155576,1,0792844041,"Well, 2 stars might be more accurate, but given the large number of 5 star reviews this horrible adaptation has already garnered I think a 1 star review is warranted.
Annette Bening, and most of the other actors, deliver their lines in this film so atrociously it is a wonder they were paid in dollars and not rotten tomatoes(no more needs to be said of the acting, it's just that awful). While I don't question the amount of Shakespeare they cut from the script, I do think they could've done much better in choosing which lines to cut).
This adaptation also, like many better films, transcribes Shakespeare into a more modern setting. However, the Naziesque setting has the filmakers selected has no point. Zero. Why bother putting Richard in a tank? Take Branagh's Hamlet and compare it to Gibson's. The late 19th Century costumes and palace that Branagh's Elsinore has is a tremendous aesthetic improvement to the drab, yet historically accurate, Elsinore of Gibson's adaptation. This new Richard III on the other hand, is no improvement at all upon Olivier's. Another Shakespeare adaptation, Titus, gets away with a very crazy modernization because the director was actually competent.",977961600,18,1190,5.0456852791878175
155577,4,0792844041,"Generally speaking, I do not like it when people take the works of Marlowe, Shakespeare, and Dickens out of their times. But this is  one time the content of the story did not really suffer too much. The script was for the most part left alone. Gloucester (later King Richard III) is captivating as the most demonic and evil character Shakespeare ever created. Just as when we read the play, we can easily be won to Richard III's side despite his evil. Maggie Smith demonstrates her mastery of Shakespeare as Richard's furious mother. As in the play, the action never stops. Despite the fact that much of the scenery is anachronistic, it is done well. My only real complaints are that they deleted the scene where Richard III is haunted by the 11 ghosts as well as King Henry VII's speech that ends the War of the Roses.",975024000,5,820,4.54054054054054
155578,3,0792844041,"Make a film of a Shakespeare play for the popular audeince, and you have to make deep cuts. Olivier's ""Hamlet"" loses two subplots and two great soliloquies, as well as nearly half of everything else - but it still works. Any production of ""Richard III"", for any audience at all, will usually make some pretty drastic excisions as well, as the original script has some serious klunkiness which can be thus mended. Again, Olivier's film is a case in point. The film on this DVD has gone at it not with a scalpel but with a cleaver, leaving us with a more or less clear picture of the gross outline of the story, but with little wealth of detail to let us know exactly why it's happening. It's as though we see a passing glossy trace of the play, rather than the play itself. McKellan is brilliant as usual, in the material allowed him. Other characters sink into the fog - Buckingham in particular. Ralph Richardson's Buckingham is one of the most memorable elements of the Olivier film. After watching this version, I would not be surprised to hear somebody say, ""Buckingham? Which one was he?"" A relentlessly good-looking film, of course, which seems to be more and more what moviemaking is only about. Interesting for McKellen fans, and for comparison with the Olivier, which, I'm afraid, remains the standard despite any technical limitations of its day and budget.",974851200,5,1367,4.7238493723849375

Bach perfomed on weird electronic instruments or steel drums or with a bunch of guys on sticks is an example of this. Richard III done in an imaginary fascist England of the 1930's is another. The clothes (wonderful!), cosmetics, body language, furniture, everything  dovetails flawlessly down to the smallest detail. Ian McKellen, as Richard, is one of the most convincing villians I have ever seen. The language is so wonderful, it would -- almost -- be worth having fascism it that was what it took to get leaders who spoke instead of grunted.",973382400,3,738,4.548872180451128
155580,4,0792844041,"In this version of Richard III the action has been movied to England in the 1930's. The move to this time period is flawless. While not as good as Titus (which is similar) this is a great film with fine performances. Maggie Smith as the Duchess of York steals this movie with her expert handling of Shakespeare. The scene she has with Ian McKellan (Richard III)by the stairs is amazing. Maggie Smith should have been a candidate for an Oscar for Best Supporting actress, a truly flawless performance. Annette Bening is very moving as Queen ELizabeth. Her best scene is in front of the building where her sons are being held prisoner by Richard. Krisitn Scott-THomas is riveting as Lady Anne. Ian McKellan is astouding as RIchard III. This is probably his best performance (even better than his performance as James Whale in ""Gods and Monsters."") THe costumes and sets are also expertly done. Richard III is a near masterpeice.",972000000,5,926,4.79375
155581,5,0792844041,"Although I'm a film devotee, and love Shakespeare on the stage,  film versions of his plays usually bore me to tears -- but not this one!  To begin with the centerpiece of the movie, Ian McKellan's performance is magnetic, magnificent, and thoroughly engaging.  He doesn't overplay Richard's physical disability, and despite his unprepossessing appearance, he can be almost appealing when he wants to be.  It's a portrayal you won't easily forget.
The rest of the cast -- with a single exception -- is almost his equal.  Jim Broadbent beautifully underplays the shallow, traitorous Buckingham.  Maggie Smith's few scenes are powerful and heartbreaking.  Annette Bening more than holds her own -- you get the feeling that this woman is intelligent and persuasive, despite her countless travails.  Adrian Dunbar in the small role of Tyrrell is slimily personable.  Only Robert Downey Jr. is sadly miscast; he manages to butcher the language every time he opens his mouth (and I'm generally a fan of his work).
Too much has been made of the resetting of the play in an imaginary 1930's fascist England.  With good actors and an imaginative director, Shakespeare works equally well in unconventional settings and traditional ones.  I WILL say that Julie Taymor must have seen this film before embarking on her own ""Titus"".  The similarities are remarkable, and I'm surprised that no one has commented on them (that film is also recommended, by the way).",970617600,5,1449,5.093220338983051
155582,4,0792844041,"Every since Orson Welles and John Houseman started the trend of updating Shakespeare, there have been several innovative interpretations of the Bard.  More so that the drug lord culture of 1996's ""William Shakespeare's Romeo & Juliet,"" this 1995 version of ""Richard III"" cast in Edwardian England is a successful addition to the tradition.  Of course it has one big advantage over other such films in that it is based on the captivating stage production by Ian McKellen and Richard Eyre.  Certainly McKellen is totally comfortable in his role, adding a 20th century venire of evil to the calculating Duke of Gloucster on his way to the crown.  This Richard is readily accessible to a contemporary audience.
But there is one extremely important caveat to enjoying this film: you have to be familiar with the original play, otherwise you will totally lose the irony of the alterations.  For example, in the play Richard woos his intended bride as she follows the casket containing her husband, who had been slain by Richard, who at one point ponders whether a woman had ever been wooed let alone won in such a manner.  In the film version the scene takes place in a morgue, with the dead husband lying on the gurney.  The scene is gruesome, something you would expect in a splatter flick rather than Shakespeare, but has a certain validity given the original scene.  It is, after all, just a question of setting.  But if you are not well versed in ""Richard III,"" you simply can not appreciate the McKellen version.
Of course, this is a marvelous opportunity for teachers who can screen the film, or key scenes, after students have read the play.  Imagine the discussions you can have on the range and validity of interpretation available.  You can do the same sort of thing with ""MacBeth""/""Throne of Blood,"" ""King Lear""/""Ran,"" or the Olivier/Branagh versions of ""Henry V.""  Or you can just enjoy this film at home and mull over such wonders on your own.",970012800,47,1951,4.808383233532934
155583,5,0792844041,"Ian McKellen's ""Richard III"" is a brilliant 20th Century adaptation of the Shakespeare original. McKellen sets the murderous intrigue and civil strife of the play in an imaginary fascist period of  English History. In doing this, he removes the story from its historical  context and demonstrates the timeless nature of its themes. The original  story was set during the War of the Roses, a bitter succession conflict  which took place in pre-Tudor England. None of the medieval butchery is  lost on us when we see it take place in a fascist context.
The central  theme of Richard III is not ambition or ruthlessness but the power of  momentum. Richard relies on both physical and rhetorical momentum for his  success. Physically, he must always be on the move. Once his movement is  stopped he is doomed. Richard makes this abundantly clear in the play and  in the film when his transportation is destroyed at the Battle of Bosworth  field and he can no longer move. Richard says ""a horse a horse,my  kingdom for a horse"" meaning that without movement he loses the battle  and with it his life and his kingdom. This signature death speech is even a  bit ironic in the film since it is Richard's jeep that is shot out from him  which means that he is speaking metaphorically when he refers to it as a  horse. What could be more fitting for a fascist leader?
Momentum is also  crucial to Richard's rhetoric. On two occasions in the play, Richard must  convince a woman whose husband he has murdered to marry him. Richard  accomplishes this the first time by matching each of the widow's arguments  with a witty retort until she has none left. But Richard is later unable to  do this with the second widow. He begins his confident stream of witty  retorts but is flustered by and then outdone by her. Rhetorically he has  lost his momentum and with it his power to dominate and control.
Momentum is as crucial to modern despots as it was to the tyrants of  Shakespeare's time. Hitler mesmerized a generation of Germans with speeches  whose content made little sense but whose momentum carried the day. And  like Richard III, Hitler was only successful as long as his army could keep  on the move. I wonder if any Panzer driver stuck in the mud and snow of  Stalingrad in 1942 found himself muttering ""a horse a horse, my kindom  for a horse""?",959212800,45,2340,4.639024390243902
155584,1,0792844041,"a great waste for acting talents and resources. Richard III converses and winks at the audience... not funny at all. not historical, humorous nor believable plot. the costume design was nominated for Oscar...not an enough  reason to watch such an empty shell",959212800,2,258,5.142857142857143
155585,4,0792844041,"A great movie, and a great adaptation of a brilliant play.
Easy to see why Al Pacino chose to do his own homage, with curiously similar timing to Ian McKellen (coincidence?). The story is very much in line with that of  the Godfather, or any epic centering on one man's burning ambition.
The  lead role is demanding. It requires a great acting talent to make the  viewer believe that the Duke of Gloucester can kill a woman's husband and  father, openly admit it, and then seduce her. The lines are  chilling:
""Was ever woman in this humor wooed? Was ever woman in  this humor won? I'll have her... but I'll not keep her  long""
McKellen does pull it off - just - with his Machiavellian  charisma. And Scott Thomas gets the opportunity to spit at him, and call  him all those great Shakespearean insults.
Transposing the setting to a  mythical 1930s fascist England is a great idea, which does work well. Along  with Luhrman's Romeo and Branagh's Hamlet, it highlights just how timeless  Shakespeare's insights into human nature are.
The film has no great flaws  - though it will likely never eclipse Olivier's stunning performance (so  cleverly parodied in Rowan Atkinson's Blackadder).
For me, the highlights  are the opening scene, where McKellen delivers the ""Winter of  discontent"" as an after-dinner speech; and the battle at the end,  where justice is finally served.
An intriguing, well-executed experiment",957916800,,1413,4.919491525423729
155586,4,0792844041,"When I see how wonderful this Richard III is, it immediately makes me question what in the world has Kenneth Branagh been doing all these years? Certainly nothing as imaginative, as provocative as this.
Deprived of  Shakespeare as a child, I have been forced to catch up piece meal through  film. Al Pacino's ""Looking for Richard"" gives attention to Richard III,  from a far different perspective, but both that film and this agree that it  has all the key elements of great drama: evil ambition, betrayal,  rivalry.
The casting is tremendous with Ian McKellen (from his own stage  play) and Kristen Scott-Thomas in the leads-thankfully there is no Kenneth  Branagh to be found. And is this guy Jim Broadbent any good, or what? For  my money he steals every scene he plays in ""Little Voice"", he's subtly  brilliant here in a lesser role. Only Annette Benning seems a little  overmatched in her portrayal of Queen Elizabeth, but that's hardly  surprising.
The accessibility of the current version, the setting in  1930's Fascist Europe, gives the story a vibrancy that is present from the  first frame to the last.

7792526,2,0792844041,"Did not care for it. (1) Ian McKellan was too old for the part. Richard was 30 years old; McKellen 55 when the film was made. The success of the play rests on the initial wicked seductive charm of the character, but McKellan is not charming, ever, in the film. He is about as seductive as a corpse. Although he is a great actor, perhaps because he is gay I just don't think he can pull off what it takes to seduce a woman. In fact, as a screenwriter he was probably responsible for eliminating lines that would have helped the cause.  In Shakespeare's play, when Richard manages to become king this is when his charm evaporates, with the audience and with the supportive characters. McKellan when crowned is too unbelievable. It is impossible to believe that a depraved old gay cripple could rally an army of lusty fascists. (2) Hearing Elizabethan English in a 19th century setting doesn't work, it is too distracting. (3) If the Elizabethan English of Shakespeare's play was retained, then why were some of the best of Shakespeare's lines and speech omitted? It is also very suspicious that the strongest woman character in the play was eliminated from the film. Fie on it. (4) The murder and battle scenes--well, we have seen it all before--knives suddenly appearing in chests, men on fire, all the cliches in place.
