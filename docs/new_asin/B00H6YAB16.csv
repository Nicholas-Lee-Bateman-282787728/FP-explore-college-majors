6134998,3,B00H6YAB16,"I just looked at the back of this box set The Kommandant Kollection of Hogan's Heroes at the store the other day. I noticed that there is new bonus material. I already have the individual season sets that we're in the slim cases. So what does that mean? That I have to buy this entire collection just to get all this new bonus material that I would really like to see?  I DON'T THINK SO!

Paramount just knows how SHAFT the die hard customers who already bought the entire series before this release only to put out a complete collection with new bonus material that you can't get anywhere else. Pathetic!

How bout this PARAMOUNT! Why don't you release just the bonus material by itself so that people like me can own it. But we all know that is not gonna happen. Hogan's Heroes was a great classic TV show. Just wish the new material would have been released earlier. Because of that, NO SALE HERE! That is why I gave this product 3 stars.",1259539200,13,941,4.365714285714286
6134999,5,B00H6YAB16,"For fans of Hogan's Heroes (1965-71), it is indeed fortunate that the program weathered the initial criticism and controversy, and went on to become a successful series for CBS for six seasons.  Created by Bernard Fein and Albert Ruddy, Hogan's Heroes featured Allied prisoners conducting clandestine operations from Stalag 13, a German prisoner of war (POW) camp.  In the initial season, various approaches were explored.  Much was learned, and changes were made that resulted in a better and funnier program.  When the writers had direction, and toned down some of the over the top wackiness, the stories became more credible, and Hogan's Heroes began to rise to new comedic heights.

The program's wonderful ensemble cast, was headed by Bob Crane as Colonel Robert Hogan, Werner Klemperer as Luftwaffe Colonel Wilhelm Klink, and John Banner as Sergeant Hans Schultz.  It was often difficult for everyone to get screen time, but the core group of POW's, French corporal Louis LeBeau (Robert Clary), RAF corporal Peter Newkirk (Richard Dawson), and US sergeants Ben Kinchloe (Ivan Dixon), and Andrew Carter (Larry Hovis), soon developed into memorable characters.  Leon Askin as General Burkhalter, evolved into a semi-regular, followed later by Howard Caine as Gestapo Major Hochstetter.  With a large cast and guest stars frequently in the mix, Hogan's Heroes featured a rich variety of acting talent, guided by a creative team that included principal writers Richard M. Powell and Laurence Marks (MASH), and directors Gene Reynolds (MASH), Bruce Bilson, and Edward Feldman, who was also executive producer.

The 1960's was an amazing decade, full of turbulence and change.  When Hogan's Heroes debuted in 1965, World War II was only twenty years in the past, and many still had deep feelings of hurt and loss.  It was understandable that some found the idea of a comedy set in a POW camp, to be offensive, or in questionable taste.  Others mistakenly confused POW camps, which housed military prisoners, with the extermination camps of the Holocaust.  Interestingly, actors Askin, Banner, Clary, and Klemperer, were Jews who had fled Europe to escape the Nazis.

The primetime comedy lineup in 1965, was an eclectic mix from many genres that included Gilligan's Island, My Favorite Martian, McHale's Navy, Bewitched, The Munsters, The Addams Family, Mr. Ed, Andy Griffith, and The Beverly Hillbillies.  Also debuted in 1965 were That Girl, Get Smart, My Mother the Car, and I Dream of Jeannie.  With TV comedy exploring so many wacky frontiers, why not a sitcom set in a stalag?

Allied prisoners digging tunnels were featured in The Great Escape (1963), a hugely popular film, based on real life events detailed in a book by Paul Brickhill.  The film took certain liberties with the truth for dramatic purposes, and Hogan's Heroes similarly mixed elements of fact with fiction, and then took matters to a radically ridiculous extreme, featuring an elaborate secret underground installation and tunnel system.  Early on, reality was stretched a bit too far, and things got a little too loose, such as when a plane was launched from the camp, artillery guns fired happy birthday flags, and a tank vanished inside the camp.  Even a parody can be taken to extremes, and adjustments were made to find an appropriate balance between reality and fantasy.  When the proper framework was established, and suitable writers found, Hogan and his men could achieve almost anything short of winning the war.  The relationship between the prisoners and the Germans, evolved from being a childish game of superiority, to one with a higher level of respect.

Some aspects of life in Stalag 13 that had a basis in reality, included the scarcity of food, and the importance of the Geneva Convention and Red Cross packages.  POW's typically had only their one uniform to wear.  Prisoners had roll calls, faced punishment for subversive activities, and developed elaborate security and warning systems to cover their escape activities, which were typically coordinated by an escape committee.  German soldiers did fear of the Russian front, and there was an `underground' system that aided Allied soldiers.

A big part of the series was the Hogan/Kink relationship, where Hogan continuously manipulated Klink by playing on his fears, ambition and vanity.  Klink was usually putty in Hogan's hands, but those rare occasions when things did not go Hogan's way, were usually a very interesting times.  Klink's incompetence so greatly aided the Allied cause, that it was hard to regard him as the enemy.  Werner Klemperer won two Emmys for his performance In the role.

John Banner was simply magnificent as the portly Sgt. Schultz, a man with a resolve as firm as jell-o, who could be pressured or persuaded with food, into doing almost anything.  Banner was perhaps the most naturally funny of anyone, and often got many of the best lines, the classic 'I know nothing . . . nothing', being just one.  Banner could take over a scene by outrageously overacting, or just by reacting in the background.  It is impossible to conceive of the program, without this gentle man's singular talents.

For many in the cast, Hogan's Heroes is what they are most remembered for.  Larry Hovis had a special talent as the goofball, demolition expert Carter, who did a hilarious impersonation of Hitler, and other Germans.  Robert Clary as LeBeau, was often found putting his culinary skills to use.  Handsome Ivan Dixon, was one of the first African Americans to be featured as a regular in a television series.  The episodes where Sergeant Kinchloe was spotlighted were always excellent.  Later known for hosting Family Feud, Richard Dawson was Peter Newkirk, a wisecracking hustler type, who fancied himself a ladies' man.  When Dixon left the series, Kenneth Washington replaced him in the final season, as Sergeant Baker.  Cynthia Lynn was Klink's secretary Helga for the first season.  Sigrid Valdis took over as Hilda, for the run of the series.  Valdis married Bob Crane in 1970.

Leon Askin, much like John Banner, was a comedic jewel as General Burkhalter.  With an acidic voice, and a commanding presence, Askin delivered some devastating zingers, usually involving some massive putdown of Klink.  With Stalag 13 and the nearby town of Hammelburg, the hub for underground operations and sabotage activities, it was natural that the Gestapo (geheim stazpolizei) took an interest in the camp.  Howard Caine became a semi-regular as the sneering Gestapo Major Hochstetter.  Hochstetter was a serious and dangerous threat, and dealing with him was always a challenge.  The Gestapo often clashed with the Luftwaffe, adding a few more sparks to the fun.

Bernard Fox as Colonel Crittenden, Kathleen Freeman as Gertrude Linkmeyer, Arlene Martel as Tiger, Nita Talbot as Marya, Dick Wilson as Fritz Gruber, and Jon Cedar as Corporal Langenscheidt (and others) were among the best of the reoccurring guest characters, with Noam Pitlik,  Victoria Carroll, and Dave Morick among the many who made multiple appearances in various roles.  The program featured a list of distinguished guest stars that included John Hoyt, Gavin MacLeod, Harold J. Stone, John Dehner, Whit Bissell, Harold Gould, Alan Oppenheimer, Frank Marth, Paul Lambert, John Stephenson, Ben Wright, and Theo Marcuse.  Some of the fine actresses who appeared include Antoinette Bower, Ruta Lee, Marj Dusay, Marilyn Mason, Barbara Babcock, Joyce Jameson, Lynn Peters, Jean Hale, Fay Spain, Claudine Longet, Sabrina Scharf, Mariana Hill, Leslie Parrish, Karen Steele, and Brenda Benet.

Robert Clary has written a memoir entitled `From the Holocaust to Hogan's Heroes', and Cynthia Lynn has also written a memoir 'Escape to Freedom'.  Brenda Scott Royce's out of print book, `Behind the Scenes at Stalag 13' has some good information, although the episode summaries could have been much more comprehensive.

The Kommandant's Kollection is the most complete set of complete series.  This new compilation appears to be a repackaging of the previously issued season sets, plus one new disc with additional bonus material.  The set maybe rates a B minus, for packaging.  To try and save space, the discs are separated into individual season sets, that are housed in folded cardboard sleeves.  The sleeves have a light brown sepia tone, and feature some cool photos.  The DVD's slide into cutout slots, and if they are not securely wedged in, the discs can fall out.  When you first open the set, check to see that none of the discs have become loose in transit.  The width of the outer box is only 2.5 inches, but it is slightly deeper than the most  DVD boxed sets.  It comes with a sliding plastic sleeve, which helps keep the season sleeves from sliding out.  With care, hopefully the long term durability of the set will be good, as paper sleeves don't offer very much protection against damage.

Fans may be curious about the content on the New Special Features Disc.  The remembrances of Richard Dawson, and co-creator Albert J. Ruddy, are of particular interest, as sadly so many in the cast are no longer with us.  Much appreciation to the late Sigrid Valdis (Patricia Crane), who graciously shared her memories and thoughts, in the previously issued sets.  A brief summary of the major items on the new bonus disc follows:

The Informer - Extended pilot episode :  The pilot has a lead in segment that features Fred MacMurray from My Three Sons, and an intro of the episode by Bob Denver and Alan Hale Jr. of Gilligan's Island.  The original pilot ran about 26 minutes, the extended version is 33 minutes.

Clip from Hollywood Palace:  The cast of Hogan's Heroes make a brief appearance with host Bing Crosby.  Hogan's Heroes was produced by Crosby's production company.  (5 minutes)

Richard Dawson Remembers:  Probably the best of the extras, features a very humble Richard Dawson reminiscing about his life, the show, and his fellow cast members.  Broken up into three segments, the total run time is about 44 minutes.

Conversation with Albert S. Ruddy:  The series co-creator Ruddy, recounts how he and Bernard Fein, total novices to screenwriting, managed to get Hogan's Heroes on network television, and how CBS was sued for plagiarism by the producers of the movie Stalag 17. (12 minutes)

The Safecracker Suite:  Al Ruddy explains how after being banned in Germany for many years, Hogan's Heroes was finally allowed to air there.  The dialog in the episodes was altered by the Germans, to be more ""appropriate"" for a German audience.  This is an example of an episode given this treatment.  A curiosity perhaps, but probably not of great interest to many.

With a fabulous cast, and solid writing, Hogan's Heroes is a truly unique classic comedy, from that very special decade, the 1960's.  For some, it may engender memories of a time when sacrifice and working together for a common cause, was not such a strange concept as it may seem today.",1258588800,258,10987,5.07808142777468
6135000,5,B00H6YAB16,"I received an advance copy of this set and it's spectacular and is reason for any Hogan's fan to be excited, unless of course you already shelled out money for the earlier releases.

Packaged together for the first time, the 28-disc set includes all six seasons of the smash-hit series, as well as an arsenal full of extras including home movies, bloopers and audio commentaries.  The set will also contain an entire disc of new to DVD special features, including an extended version of the pilot with rare introduction, a new cast interview with Richard Dawson and a photo montage including unseen images set to a performance of the show's theme song by Bob Crane and his band.  Brand new ""Kommandant Rank"" graphics and packaging have been designed for this special set.

Garnering two Emmy nominations for his role, Bob Crane stars as Colonel Hogan, who together with his fellow Prisoners of War at Stalag 13 cleverly outwit their German captors.  Firing off a non-stop string of one-liners from behind enemy lines, the ragtag team - including
Richard Dawson, Robert Clary and Larry Hovis - lead a relentless comic assault on their Nazi captors, conducting espionage and sabotage campaigns right under the noses of their warders.  While the enemy is often gullible, easily fooled or downright incompetent, the real strength of Hogan's men are the elaborate ruses and sometimes dangerous lengths they will go to complete their mission.  Werner Klemperer earned back-to-back Emmy awards for his role as the German Colonel Wilhelm Klink.  Airing from 1965 through 1971, HOGAN'S HEROES garnered three Emmy nominations for Outstanding Comedy Series.

HOGAN'S HEROES THE KOMPLETE SERIES, KOMMANDANT'S KOLLECTION arrives armed with a disc of new to DVD material, including:

The principal ensemble cast work well to sell the shows unusual premise (which would have easily failed in less capable hands).  The recurring characters were excellent  in particular, General Burkhalter and Major Hochstetter.

Seasons two trough four are the best.  Season five, the last with Ivan Dixon, is overall not as convincing as the previous; while season six emphasizes the silliness of Larry Hovis light-hearted character too often.

Otherwise, its a fine show and surely one of the most unique and well executed American comedies on broadcast TV.",1457827200,,659,5.219047619047619
6135020,5,B00H6YAB16,"I actually had to buy this collection twice. The first copy was ruined by a Coby DVD player. I realized that I should appreciate this for more than I did originally. Some of the names used by the characters in the show actually go back to before World War I.Henry Davison actually knew who they were. You want to know something about Republican politics when Johnson and Nixon was president?Look no further. They actually allude to Reagan,Bush,Bush,and Trump. Even Jeb Bush gets mentioned. There is a down side to this. Kommandant of the Year(Original Airdate-10/1/65)was the assassination of Alfred Herrhausen(CEO Deutsche Bank)on November 30,1989 by the Red Army Faction. Drums Along the Dusseldorf(Original Airdate-3/30/68)was the murder of Joe and Anna Trustey at the Timmerman Airport in Milwaukee,WI on July 29,2015. The experimental jet fuel was in the spare jet still in the hanger back home in Massachusetts. The Empty Parachute(Original Airdate 12/05/69)was the Bear Stearns Bailout of $10.00 per share in J.P. Morgan Chase stock. There are other numerous instances of hijinx and mayhem. I'm sure I won't recognize all of them so I urge anybody that has the where with all to find other instances. Some might be just as high profile. A likeness of this reviewer can be found in Man in a Box(Original Airdate 12/28/68)I seem to be at a table trying to enjoy a beer. While I'm obviously neglecting sports and entertainment figures that are alluded to in this show;there was one banker that lived. That is in The Prisoner's Prisoner(Original Airdate 10/22/65).That was Neal Finnegan. He used to work for Worcester County Bank(N.A.) and he was picked up by Dime Savings Bank in New York City. This show is also sprinkled with insults directed at one particular American family,but Hollywood has been doing that for decades. This show has the unmistakable veneer of Republican politics;the better for them to hide behind. It is well made and production values are A+.To say I love it is a left handed compliment. I usually call a spade a spade. Understand this show for what it really is and you might say you love it too warts and all. It's interesting if Robert Crane's life would of turned out differently if Mrs. Yawkey didn't sell the Red Sox to John Henry.",1456099200,,2267,4.93717277486911

So far I have had no problems with any of the discs.  Packaging is better than average for budget packing.  No scratches, all discs have played fine so far, audio is good, video is good.  I currently into season three.

Only thing I don't like is the menu that started with the season two discs.  It is an obnoxiously load, has nothing to do with the series, prison style bunch of noise that is played while the menu is up.  Not sure what they were thinking.

So, it looks like Paramount did at least ""attempt"" to improve things during it's production run of this DVD set, way back when.
The first version we received, at least HALF of the discs were loose and flopping around inside the cardboard sleeves that slide in to the red box.  As such, pretty much every disc was scratched - and a few wouldn't play.  We returned for a second attempt, this time from Amazon proper (not fulfilled by another vendor), and we found the DIFFERENT and improved sleeve design!  Yes, still not a fan of the whole sleeve thing, but at least, with the second design, the discs were HELD in place, not moving around, and not scratched.  The second, newer, design has cardboard flaps (see picture) that fold down over the bottom disc, held in place by little velco fasteners, and these flaps keep the bottom of the two discs in place, and not touching any other disc.  As such, this second packaging actually does protect all the discs, thereby protecting them in transit.
Now, once you have the discs, up to you if you want to purchase a different holder (perhaps something like this,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/10pk-STANDARD-BLACK-14mm-6-DISC-OVERLAP-DVD-BOX-WITH-HINGED-INSERT/dp/B0089Y566W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">10pk. - STANDARD BLACK 14mm. 6-DISC OVERLAP DVD BOX WITH HINGED INSERT</a>&nbsp;), but know that there ARE in fact two red-boxed packaging versions and with one of them, you should have all 28 discs arrive, unscratched, and ready for watching.

People complained about the packaging of this product, damaged discs and return problems.  Agreed that the design of the disc sleeves is not the greatest and some discs did slip out of their sleeves during shipping.  But I ran all the discs that had come out of their sleeves during shipping and no damage done.  And if you use care when removing and replacing the discs in the sleeves (as you should with all DVD's) you shouldn't have any problem with them.  I've purchased many other box sets with far worse packaging than this.

6135058,4,B00H6YAB16,"This show has little to do with World War II, German POW camps, or war history except it uses these elements as a kind of superficial setting. It is pure fantasy created strictly for laughs and amusement. But maybe a tragedy like World War II needs to have its lighter side and in that sense Hogan's Heroes fits the bill. My guess is that this show was inspired partially by two films, both of which idealized certain aspects of German POW camps in their own way: ""Stalag 17"" and ""The Great Escape"". However, the sense was that in both films the Americans and British were somehow really in charge of the German prison operations. The English-speaking peoples were ultimately the superior over their German-touting captors. Hogan's Heroes takes this idea, turns the German colonel in charge of the camp into a wining idiot, the guards into nincompoops, gives the Americans and British superior intelligence, and adds a laugh-track. The result is Hogan's Heroes, and oddly enough it works on its own terms.

This show is essentially a comic strip with live actors. All the characters are rather cartoonish. The lovable but scatter-brained Colonel Klink, played with bumbling foolishness by the great Werner Klemperer, is no match for the sly and shrewd Colonel Hogan, played by the immortal Bob Crane who will best be remembered for this show. In many episodes, the Americans, British, and French POW's played by Larry Hovis, Richard Dawson and Robert Clary outwit, outdo and humiliate their Nazi adversaries. The POW's don SS uniforms, constantly bribe and flatter the top guard, Sargeant Hans Schultz, and intercept numerous messages. And the most fun is when Klink will be visited by the high command and he turns to Hogan for help. It seems Klink's line, ""Hogan you've got to help me!"" recurred throughout the show. Of course the biggest mystery of the show is why Klink doesn't just shoot them? In fact Werner Klemperer played a German/Nazi judge defendant in the award-winning ""Judgement at Nuremberg"" which has to be a 180-degree shift from Hogan's Heroes. In Nuremberg, Klemperer's character sent many innocent people to their deaths.

The show which lasted for a remarkable 7 seasons is nearly a theater of the absurd. The little situations are good, clean and inoffensive fun, unless of course you are of German descent. That I can't help. But I guess that's the price Hitler's Germany paid for trying to conquer Europe: they get mercilessly and shamelessly spoofed for the rest of eternity. But after the laughter's over, we should not forget that the Nazi ideology caused the deaths of millions of people and the suffering of millions more. The only consolation is that if Klink had been in charge, maybe this could have been avoided. Oddly, Klink's character appears to be a victim as well. In one memorable line, Klink says to Hogan, ""Col Hogan, if you ever escape, be a good fellow and take me with you!"" Not even Klink liked the Nazi high command.",1433462400,,2962,4.886679920477137

6135083,4,B00H6YAB16,"I saw this box set and thought why not go back in time to my childhood of the 70's where Hogan's Heroes was in syndication and played almost constantly on local Chicago stations. For the price I was glad I did and for the most part it has been enjoyable, but after watching a few seasons, you wonder how the show made it as long as it did. You notice that plots and character actors are recycled often and you wonder why there never was any summer in the 6 seasons of HH. Kind of a hard trick to pull off, especially since the series was filmed on the famous Desilu lot, ""40 acres"" in southern California, where The Andy Griffith Show and other classic shows were filmed. I'm sure at times it was almost unbearable for the actors in the heavy German uniforms during the hotter months. Lol.

To get back to the reasons why the series still has fans to this day is pretty simple when watching any episode. The great John Banner who played Sergeant Schultz was a scene steal-er for sure and I still laughed out loud at his antics. The talent the producers of this show assembled for this series was spot on. Bob Crane always gave me a creepy vibe, but was good at playing Hogan as the rest of the cast was in their roles. Werner Klemperer was fantastic at playing the role of Col Klink and in my opinion, he along with John Banner really made the show work. This show came from a different era in not only TV, but this country's time as well. It's silly, kind of dumb at times with the impossible plots and story lines, but has a charm to it that a number of the shows back then did, but would be lost on audiences today. People today may forget that in 1965 TV was still finding it's way and a lot of shows were still in black and white, like the Hogan's Heroes pilot is in this box set.

Great addition for any classic tv fan who enjoys the silliness and almost campy story writing that was a staple of quite a few shows back then. I'm glad for the memories it brought back and will hopefully enjoy this box set for years to come.",1426550400,6,2029,4.2

Hogan's Heroes is a great show that has held up pretty well, considering it was shot almost 50 years ago. I've read claims that it's somewhat based on Billy Wilder's Stalag 17; but I think it more closely resembles a comedic spinoff of The Great Escape. Whatever its origins are, it's comedy gold!

But I must say I am disappointed in this set overall. The cardboard DVD cases do not securely hold the DVDs... more than half of them were completely loose when we first opened the set up, and many of the DVDs were scratched on arrival. So far none of them have been scratched so badly that they won't play, so I have not yet filed a complaint; but I am monitoring each disk as we work through the series.

6135131,5,B00H6YAB16,"For you ""Young Bucks"" out there Stalag13 was the HELL OF ALL HELLS for P.O.W.'s IN POW CAMPS DURING WWII or World War 2,  for the younger generation. You MUST REMEMBER this series ran right ""smack in the middle"" of the Cold War buildup, so Anti-Soviet sentiments ran high during the ""airing"" of this program. Not only that but it was just 20 years or so and the first few seasons weren't so ""warmly welcomed"" in this country especially for those who'd been P.O.W.'s in this HELL HOLE. Also while I was in Western Germany, in bases that I operated out of the German Populations outright resented the program as it was aired on AFN in Germany, But now a days it's all but forgotten, and that's a shame, it was a well written script ""every episode"" is very ""tastefully"" done, even when it takes ""Cheap Shots"" at the Feur, which is practically every episode. 99.9% of the original cast are deceased now, with the exception of Richard Dawson, also as host of Family Feud, amongst other things. The Packaging of the discs isn't the best so when you receive your order ensure that you go through each disc & CAREFULLY INSPECT each one for SHIPPING & HANDLING DAMAGE, the folks @ Amazon.com are good people they'll make things right with you. PREPARE TO BE ENTERTAINED & ENJOY!!!!!!!!!!!!!",1419465600,3,1281,4.618421052631579

6135152,5,B00H6YAB16,"Love Love Love Col. Hogan and the gang at Stalag 13. Have enjoyed this simple, lighthearted show since childhood.
A great value for about fifty bucks! Some people complained about the packaging, I think it's fine. I didn't buy this to collect but to watch and my wife and I do so very often, smiling, laughing, enjoying the endearing Shultz, grimacing at the pathetic Klink and how he's so unbelievably gulable, stupid and annoying. Hogan's master plots with Labeau, Kench, Newkirk and my favorite, Sgt Carter, all pulling off these witty schemes.
A simple minded story that always leaves us chuckling and feeling light hearted. After watching something heavy or dark we may watch an episode of Hogan's Heros just to brush off the heaviness, darkness or evil. It always works. It's good simple and silly therapy for a stressful and hectic world.
Hogan's Heros is one of those shows that no one believed would make a whole season much less six season. A hit that's constantly in reruns, I love it.",1412985600,,996,4.796511627906977

A mind-staggering tunnel system under the prison camp, secret radios to receive orders from London, a seemingly endless supply of disguises to use outside of camp... And who could help loving the German barracks guard Sergeant Shultz??? ""I see NOTHING!!!"" ;-) Stalag 13 Kommandant Colonel Wilhelm Klink - could the Americans have had a better ally???

6135168,5,B00H6YAB16,"Hogans Heroes premiered in 1965, a mere twenty years after World War II and the Holocaust.  Therefore some people were not ready for a comedy about soldiers in a German Prisoner of War Camp. The truth is, the show is ingenious and well played regardless of the subject matter.  The allied prisoners in this camp are using it as an underground base of operations against the Nazis.  The Germans who run the camp are portrayed as either incompetent (Colonel Klink), or lackadaisical (Sergeant Shultz) which makes it easier for the POWs (led by Colonel Hogan) to maintain the upper hand while all the time appearing subservient.  There are listening devices hidden in teapots, tunnels to the outside of camp, and a seemingly endless access to whatever resources they need (all unbeknownst to their captors).  The show was cleverly written and entertaining for all six seasons.",1407974400,,873,4.993103448275862

Finally got a chance to watch the series and although the claims of flimsy sleeves and disks flopping around loose were true I was lucky and got through Season 5 with no issues.  Disk 1 of Season 6 Failed, then Disk 2.  Disk 3 is working fine and I still need to watch Disk 4 and the Special Features disk to ensure they work.  Of course it's been over a month because I didn't have time to sit and test/watch them all in 30 days so I can no longer return.  Looking at the 2 disks that are not working they have some scratches on them.  So now I have almost what I paid for minus half of Season 6.

6135227,1,B00H6YAB16,"""Hogan's Heroes"" fans looking to pay a small price for the entire series take heed. STAY AWAY FROM THIS SET! The one star rating is in no way a reflection of my opinion of ""Hogan's Heroes"" itself, but of the packaging. The system looks handsome from the outside & the extras are nice. The huge problem is the cardboard booklets which hold the DVDs for each season. I have so far had to replace seasons # 4 & now # 6 because the DVDs get scratched VERY easily when they are slid back into the slots which hold them. Whoever designed the packaging for holding the DVDs has no clue how easy it is to scratch DVDs even while being extra careful. If anyone does buy this set, be prepared to store the DVDs some other way where they won't be damaged. I wish now I had bought the six seasons of the series individually. They are secured in plastic albums in the original season releases. For the money you think you will save buying this set, you will end up spending more when the DVDs get damaged by replacing the season sets which get damaged.

6135254,4,B00H6YAB16,"Bad:
Like others have said, the cardboard package the set comes in leaves something to be desired.  There are separate cardboard sleeves for each season.  Inside each season's sleeve some of the discs fell out of their pocket and rattled around during shipping.  I did as someone else suggested and placed each disc in a separate plastic dvd sleeve to protect them for future use.  A 100 pack of these sleeves is less than $10.  Two of the 28 discs showed damage, yet they seem to play okay when I tested them.  As long as they package the series this way I figure I got off okay.  Could have been a lot worse.

The quality of the recording shows up on the tv screen.  I remember watching this series when it was telecast originally, and all we had was B&W set.  The picture quality on my set look very good.
The series tickled me then, and I find it at least as funny, if not better after all these years.  No special effects, or blood and gore.  I'm guessing this series won't appeal to many of the younger crowd.  The emphasis is on strong acting performances, and comedy.

To sum it up, there's only 2 things I'd change,  if I could.  One would be to have the factory where they're made use better packing.  Yes, that would increase the price. (boooooh!)  The second is I wished the series had lasted more than 6 seasons so there would be more episodes to enjoy.

I've been keeping this set on my radar for several months, and the price has risen $15 in three months.  Don't wait, buy it as soon as you can.  Likely won't get any cheaper.",1389657600,,1542,4.321678321678322

Each season's multiple discs are then stored in these skinny thin cardboard folders with only envelope slips for holding the discs.  The result (besides being ugly and not standard multiple disc spindle cases) is that removing the discs without tearing the ""envelope"" is a pain and worse multiple discs had fallen out during shipping and got scratched.  Very sad as being a fan of the show and it finally getting to DVD - they decided to ruin it with this obviously substandard and cheap packaging.  if you only care about the video and don't mind getting scratched discs (I returned as two were showing problems) - go for it - else stay away until they do it right.",1389571200,8,904,4.660377358490566

6135270,1,B00H6YAB16,"On December 21, 2013 I received a complete series of Hogan's Heroes, only to find that it's missing the plastic title sleeve to protect it from damage. My experience turned to disappointment. I opened the box and some DVDs fell. They were laying on top of one another when I opened some cases. While shipped, the discs most likely were bumped out of their cardboard sleeves and got scratched. Then the discs that were still in their cardboard sleeves were forced backed and forth during being shipped and caused scratches to certain ends of the discs. I believe the people who designed the series case and sold it without the plastic sleeve are at fault. The DVD holders were in the form of cardboard sleeves, which only damaged the DVD's. They should have used standard design of the plastic center holder to reduce any damage towards the disc's.
I thought I would have received a complete series of Hogan's Heroes without any damages to it. I didn't receive my money's worth. This was an improper design to ship the DVD's. In addition, I would not recommend this product. This is also seen the M*A*S*H Martinis and Medical collection.",1387584000,15,1136,4.742424242424242

However, CBS/Paramount in it's infinite wisdom and chasing of the American dollar decided to place these 28 disks into CHEAP as possible, thin cardboard sleeves, one for each season and the 4 or 5 disks inside simply slide into slots.  All fine and dandy if I am at the factory and can get a set right off the assembly line before the set has a chance to be handled by any one or shipped any place..

But that's not how it works.  The customer has to sit back as these disk sets go through multiple shipping movements...  shipping to warehouses, dealers/retailers and then the shipping to the customer to name a couple.  By the time the customer gets this set it has been handled and shipped several times before it arrives at the customer's door.... all scratched and disks flying everywhere because all you have to do is pick the set up and turn it upside down and half the disks will fall out inside their sleeves ready to be scratched even more.

Shame on CBS/Paramount for trying to save a nickel here and there and skimping on packaging of this set.  It's embarrassing how cheaply done this set is.

I received my 28 disk complete set yesterday and found that 15.... FIFTEEN... of the 28 disks were just rattling around inside their sleeves and would fall on the floor soon as you open a particular seasons sleeve.  ALL FIFTEEN disks are scratched moderately to severely. There is nothing to hold the disks in their cases... oh that's right... there are no cases... only paper cardboard sleeves with slots.

The absolute worst packaging I have ever seen in a DVD set plus 15 of my 28 Disks are scratched to pieces when they are supposed to be new.  That's an over 50% failure rate on the product I paid for.

I'd give it zero if I could.  AVOID this item at all costs until they change the packaging.
I can't even put the disks in my own empty DVD cases I purchased a while back because 15 of them are scratched up!

6135304,4,B00H6YAB16,"I will be copying some of my review from another review cause I feel it will help with things. ------Having read the reviews here I chose to purchase on sale at a brick and mortar retail store. I can tell you having only gotten to see a few episodes of the series total that the show itself is hilarious and entertaining. The packaging that this set has must of been approved by someone shouting ""I see nothing"". Each season is in its on cardboard sleeve. The slots that hold the disc damage the discs when you take them out and put them back in. Then the slots that don't hold them, the discs are sliding all over the place which also damaging discs. ------OK now for not copied part. Now with the review above I feel is correct and they should have put in a better protection container or sleeves. I so far have had no problems with the playing of the videos so far. The disc are scratch on a couple of them due to the packaging. In many cases in the past dealing with DVD or CD's I feel the scratches don't cause any harm just the smudging from handling with the fingers. These sleeves make it impossible to avoid this most of the time. So if you don't mind when you get this Komplete Series, just put all discs in a new, more protective case(s). This show is great and the memories I have watching back when I was a kid with my big brother is great. Unless I find any repairable problems with the rest of the discs, I will be keeping my set. Cause when it comes to the scratches, I see nothing! LOL. Ok so I had to put a pun in there. Have a great day.",1376524800,,1556,4.138613861386139
6135305,5,B00H6YAB16,if you like good old-fashioned comedies this is a must have item. This show is a classic that ran for six seasons which is longer than America's involvement in WWII.,1374278400,,165,4.533333333333333

Although there is another complete set through regular DVD packaging - it turns out that set is a little higher in price than this, so this is a little more cost effective when considering which set to purchase.

Only drawback to this, is that the holders that organize and hold the DVD's themselves are made from cardboard and may not hold up and last through the test of time.  Perhaps it was a cost saving measure for manufacturing they felt had to be done.  However, with an item like this, I feel it should be made to withstand at least some measure of the test of time as Hogan's Heroes is truly a collectable and therefore should be treated as such.",1373587200,4,852,4.273291925465839
6135307,3,B00H6YAB16,Does anyone know which season the episode about when in the beginning of the show everyone is standing outside and someone announces a bomb scare. Everyone starts running and Sargent Schultz knocks Col Klink down and his face ends up buried in the snow. I want to see this episode. Can anyone help me find it?  Does anyone know which season and which episode?,1373155200,,359,4.609375
6135308,5,B00H6YAB16,"I have to say, being into the third season thus far, that this is one of my most favorite sets.  I was pleasantly surprised to find out that Hogans Heroes was not only FUNNY, but even funnier than I remembered.  It is rip-roaring fun.  Yes, the scripts are silly at times, yes, Klink should stop listening to Hogan, but what fun would that be?  This show makes no pretense to be anything other than what it is.  Poking fun at the former Nazi's.

It should be noted that the men portraying the lead Germans (Schultz, Klink, Burkhalter, Hockstetter) were all Jews.  In fact, John Banner, an Austrian, had lost his entire family to Nazi concentration camps, while Robert Clary (LeBeau), a Jew as well, had been interred in a concentration camp, and lost family in them.  Klink is portrayed as the worlds worst violinist, when in reality, Werner Klemperer is an accomplished violinist, Casting was superb, with minimal bad acting.

Its been noted many times that Schultz knows whats going on (in fact he ends up on a bombing mission with Hogan and crew), but whats less known is that Klink knows too, at least a little, though he is convinced there are no tunnels.  (Truth being, anytime the Nazi's start digging for some reason, Hogan and crew have to rush in and fill in a tunnel.)  Priceless scenes usually include Schultz, like when they open the tunnel right in front of him.  The look on Schultz's face and his reactions are hilarious and seem genuine.  Many times Schultz heads to Klinks office, in spite of his ""I see nothing, I know nothing"", only to have Hogan feed him some line that will cause him to end up on the Russian front.  He changes his mind QUICKLY, survival being Schultz's first instinct, ahead of food.  I actually think this show might not have been very funny without Schultz.

Watch for the palm trees.  It's always winter at Stalag 13, but you will occasionally see the California palm trees as well as the studios silver water tower.  Also, in spite of this series being about a POW camp in Germany, it is filled with beautiful women.

Price was easy on my wallet, and shipping was fast.  I know I'm going to watch this series again and again.  Some comedy's make you laugh, but some of the scripts on this series will have you belly-laughing, especially when something ""bad"" happens and BOTH Klink and Schultz have heart attacks at the same time.

PS - It's been reported that there will be a Hogans Heroes movie out soon.  Thanks to this show, I'll be first in line.

I had to add a note to my original review.  I've noticed the cardboard packaging scratches the DVD's.  I was very surprised.  Just pulling the disc out one time puts several scratches on the disc.  This is unacceptable.  Love the show and know I will be watching it again and again, but each time will put more scratches on the disc.  I would suggest tipping the top of the disc towards you slightly as you carefully remove it.  I'm keeping my review of the show at 5 stars, but I SHOULD take one away because of the packaging!",1372809600,4,3023,4.522140221402214

They are of good quality and bring back the memories we share as we watched the original series on our then, recently purchased, color, mind numbing, idiot box.  At the time of their over-the-air showing a VCR was not, if I remember correctly, available to the general public, therefore we missed programs here and there, due to work or going out to party.  Now we can watch them when we wish and are able to see all parts of the series that we had previously missed. The packaging, from what we can see, was not intended  to completely protect the disk, but if kept properly in their original box and not handled roughly, they should last many years.  The lower cost that they are now being sold for more than make them worth the money especially if you wish to step back into a simpler and less complicated time.",1369267200,2,890,4.36969696969697
6135316,5,B00H6YAB16,"""Hogan's Heroes"" was a staple of late 1960's comedy. Although frequently predictable due to the characters being so perfect in their formulaic roles (Klink is the bumbling, insecure camp commander, Hogan is the suave, smart hero who always outsmarts the bad guys, Schultz is the kindhearted and daft guard who could always be tempted with strudel, etc.), the show was brilliantly written and extraordinarily well acted for a sitcom.

This set has all six seasons, and the quality is generally decent but is somewhat variable due to the nature of the original archive material. I actually found season six to be the worst of the set largely because of substandard audio. I couldn't begin to comment on the episodes (there have been entire books written on the subject) other to say that they vary between good and sublime. After watching the entire series over the course of a couple of weeks of winter treadmill training I decided that season four's ""Klink vs. The Gonculator"" is my favorite episode of the entire series. I am unsure why I like that episode so much, but it's pure television genius.

The cast and writers deserve much of the credit for the lasting quality of this show and its lasting sociological impacts on American culture and vernacular (""I know nothing!"") The set does have a couple of extras, including commentaries and interviews with cast and series co-creator Albert J. Ruddy. Of the extras I found the recollections of Richard Dawson most interesting and poignant. Particularly touching is his story about how he came to learn that Robert Clary was an actual concentration camp survivor; once you hear him tell it, you'll never be able to look at either of them the same way again. This brings up a very important point: many people have been critical of the show over the decades for being in poor taste, but understand that the show is set in a Prisoner of War camp, not a concentration camp; there is a huge distinction, and Robert Clary would be the first to explain that. Sadly, Clary is the last surviving star of the series, but the others will live on in living rooms everywhere for years to come thanks to the good humored nature and fundamental brilliance of the cast and show.",1369094400,3,2214,4.778067885117493

6135334,2,B00H6YAB16,The 6 seasons of Hogan's Heroes are some of the best television in the 1960s. Problem is this collection contains packaging that damages the disks. They are stuck in cardboard slots that scratch the disks. When I received the boxed set half of the disks were out of the slots banging around in the box. Fortunately they all played well but I had to buy plastic holders for the disks to prevent further damage to the disks. When you add the cost of these to the cost of the boxed set you realize that it's cheaper to buy the individual season rather then this complete set. The bonus disk is terrific but not worth receiving damaged disks as is inevitable with this set.,1363046400,6,669,4.4471544715447155

6135336,5,B00H6YAB16,"As strange as this may sound (and yes, it sounds strange to me, too) this gift was a birthday present to a little girl who just turned 9 years old. For reasons I'll never be able to explain, she's fallen in love with this show, but the time of the show on TV is such that she often misses it. For that reason I thought it would be a good gift for her -- and I was right! She was so happy to get it; even better, I waited until the last minute to order it and feared it would arrive late, but in fact it arrived even earlier than originally promised. She's now happily working her way through the episodes -- and I may even borrow it back after she's done watching them...",1362268800,2,671,4.014925373134329
6135337,5,B00H6YAB16,"Love the show but the some of the disc where glue to the packaging.
You might want to talk to the manufacturer on how they make the packaging.",1362182400,,142,4.107142857142857
6135338,5,B00H6YAB16,"Like so many of the other reviews - I received my 'Kommandant's Kollection' promptly, but it was rather loose in a box, with 1 1/2 semi-inflated bags of air attempting to keep it from sloshing around.  It didn't.  90% of the discs were jostled loose (although, none look to be scratched), and even if they weren't...sliding in & out of the cardboard sleeves will certainly scratch them up in no time.  They should put them in cases like the X-Files or Six Feet Under...

Anyway - aside from the packaging/packing...I watched the first two episodes, and it is quite a nice transfer...  I haven't seen this show for years, and it is certainly clearer than I have ever seen it!  It is also still as comical to me today, as it was when I was a kid.

Far-fetched?  Certainly!  Fun??  You bet!!  I've always found it curious that Werner Klemperer, Robert Clary, and John Banner's families all fled from the Nazi occupation...and they ended up in this show.  I've heard it told that Werner Klemperer only agreed to play the bumbling Col. Klink if they A-L-W-A-Y-S made him look like a buffoon, and if he ever felt they were giving Klink the upper hand...he would quit right then/there.

In my opinion, Hogan's Heroes, Get Smart, Green Acres, I Love Lucy, and shows from that era are some of the finest comedies there will ever be.  Hogan is a personal favorite, and this collection doesn't disappoint!

Maybe if it ever makes it to Bluray, it will be packaged better...

UPDATE:  I've finally started watching (and actually looking at the discs) - Season 1 has 3 damaged disks - granted, it's only parts of an episode on each, but it halts playback on each.  I called Amazon CS, and they are sending out another collection for me to pick & choose the good discs and return the damaged ones.

Still hate the original packaging, but it's how the problem is handled that is important.  Amazon always has done a great job of support for anything I've ever purchased - and this is no exception.

UPDATE II:  I have now gone through 54 disks (27 per set x 2).  I still have a couple of defective ones, which I'm getting a THIRD set sent...hopefully this time will be the charm.  I HIGHLY recommend putting each disk in your player, and running each episode (on 2x speed - makes it quicker to get through them all)...and see if it stalls, skips, balks...  It's a pain, but the only way you'll know before your return window closes...

UPDATE III:  I have received the THIRD set of disks (thanks Amazon!).  Most of the disks actually stayed in their folders...but even those are scratched.  I'm not holding out hope that the ones I need are playable, but i'll test them.  I have sent a complaint to CBS Corp - on their feedback form...  It's not the right vehicle, but hopefully, they will pass it on to the right place, rather than putting it thru the digital shredder...",1362009600,,2857,4.543137254901961
6135339,5,B00H6YAB16,"WOW !!!  What a show. This show could of went on another 5 years. Simply well made, well acted, and the funniest of episodes.  Its hard to believe that someone could laugh so much in 25 minutes. There isn't one series or sitcom on today that comes close to the talent and credibility of this show. Its no wonder that shows like this comes back in syndication showing reruns of the past. Todays actors and shows are money made, not quality made. This show was made when actors believed in what they were doing and proved it weekly. I spent about 55 on this set and except for the cheap packaging it came with (and I do mean cheap, dvds fall out of there cheap cardboard slots all the time) it is still an incredible good deal for a great great show.  6 seasons in all included in this set. Picture quality and sound were good and it was worth the money. CBS-Paramount should be ashamed of themselves for the lousy packaging they did on this set cause its really BAD.

Its packaging must be a runner-up to the Stargate SG-1 series packaging for most lousy packaging of any series EVER!!!!! I am just not clear on why Amazon hasn't acted on these repetitive complaints to protect their consumer community from such flagrant violations of their customers by these companies, Hey Amazon, remember the old addage ""an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure"" but I guess such a large company can afford to rest on its laurels, too bad.",1358985600,11,806,4.8478260869565215

You turn the season set upside down all the dvds will fly out the top of the sleeve. Very bad choice. If they would have came with a jewel type insert in the holders to secure the dvds, I would give a 5. Grew up staying up late at night with dad on school nights, to the anger of mom when they showed these in the early 80s. Back when you got like 3 stations on an antenna on a pole and they all went off air at 1 AM, lol. I still have that jet flying through the clouds burnt into my brain that they would show right before going off the air, haha. Kids these days just have no idea. Anyways, great show, dad was a ww2 vet who stormed Normany, survived, and went all the way to Berlin and back home. He sure got a laugh out of these shows, even when they originally came out.

This product's packaging looks extremely classy, but it does nothing to protect the discs themselves. This should and must be priority number one. I see this more and more with DVD collections. I prefer cases that securely fasten the discs in the case and are durable enough to protect them. I hate envelope style casing. When I opened the package, one of the discs had glue all over it and would not play. The paper sleeves aren't good at holding the disks in place and they fall around loose.  When the product arrived, every disk had fallen from the sleeves. They were all scratched before I could even play them. I like for my DVDs and Blu-rays to be protected.

I also like the original ""CBS presents this program in color"" announcements before the shows, as it brings back memories when color TV was not yet the norm. I'm looking forward to watching the bonus disc with the extra features.

I don't really share the concern other reviewers have with the packaging. The cases are made of cardboard and are designed to look like a military issue or theme. I don't see it as any different than putting a disc in a cardboard sleeve. Just exercise a little care (which you should do anyway) with the discs when removing and reinserting them into the case and you'll be fine.

6135377,5,B00H6YAB16,"While I am not a fan of the cardboard sleeves, I do love this series and love the fact it's all here in one set. I prefer the single dvd cases with the muli-trays..that can hold up to six discs. The cardboard sleeves do line up to make a picture if that means anything, and yes the discs do shift a bit in the sleeves, but mine arrived unscratched, and now that they are settled, I doubt it will be much of a problem later, that being said, I really do love this show. It's a show that at first glance seems ridiculous. You have allied p.o.w.s carrying out covert missions from inside a natzi prison camp. However, the show works. The humor, the timing, the seriousness all works well together. Sometimes it's totally silly and implausible, but the cast is having so much fun it's hard not to go along with it. The interesting thing to me, was that Klink and Schultz were not your typical nazis, Scultz was simply biding his time until it was time to go back home. Klink wasn't really enthralled by all the propaganda, it seemed as if he could care less about impressing his superiors. a lot of people tend to say he was a bumbler, but in fact Klink was smarter than those above him in rank, he simply didn't wish to be there. He had better things to do with his time, he simply did not have a choice. The show, for all of its humor, managed to show real people responding to real situations. Klink's main concern was not being sent to the russian front. he could care less about third reich propaganda. Everyone here was not where they wanted to be. However, Hogan's Heroes was right where they needed to be. Where they could do the most good. I remember watching this show in my youth thinking how funny and well written it was. Upon seeing it available on dvd in a full season, I jumped at the chance to watch it, half worried that it would not live up to my memories. In fact it was better. Now that I'm older I understand the nuances of Schultz's character. I used to think he was annoying, but upon seeing the series I found him quite entertaining, and very interesting. The character dynamics on this show were simply amazing. There aren't too many shows written this well anymore. So anyone who is a fan of comedy and anyone who likes war time shows. I'd recommend this. In fact I'd say skip the Tom Cruise movie Valkyrie and watch the episode of Hogan's Heroes which showcased the same real life situation. The movie failed to do that event justice, but Hogan's Heroes managed to make it funny without overshadowing the overall weight of the situation.

6135383,5,B00H6YAB16,I watched re-runs of this show as a small boy and loved it. When they finally released the series I bought them as they came out. It is great to have it in this package. I watch this with my son now who is the age I was when I first saw it. He loves it just as much as me and its a wonderful way for us to bond. The show has wonderful settings that look as real as can be although it was filmed at Desilu studios. You'd never know that the set was around the corner of Gomer piles' set. I was fortunate enough to find a rare arial picture taken in the late sixties of the Desilu studios before it was torn down. What a shame. Think of having preserved those sets for future generations to tour... Oh well progress has its downfalls. I know this show will make everyone laugh if taken as a lighter way to remember the pain and suffering that really was experienced. We'll never see this kind of humor as everyone now watches not-so-real reality shows...,1326585600,,952,4.151351351351352

6135398,5,B00H6YAB16,"HOGAN'S HEROES is one of those programs that neither jumped the shark nor became dated by the passage of time. Debuting only twenty years after the end of World War II, the show was an odd mixture of equal parts of sincerity, authenticity, and screwball comedy. Although HOGAN'S HEROES is now derided by many professional critics as one of the worst television shows ever produced, that assessment is grotesquely unfair.

These critics point out that HOGAN'S HEROES mocks the experiences of wartime Prisoners of War and Concentration Camp inmates. How it does this is not entirely clear, since the Germans are the only objects of mockery on the show and the Holocaust never gets a direct mention.

For six seasons (1965-1971), HOGAN'S HEROES entertained us by pitting the sharp Colonel Hogan (Bob Crane) against the buffoonish Colonel Klink (Werner Klemperer) in an unequal battle of wits. Hogan's men, though apparently POWs at the fictional Stalag Thirteen, were in reality a crack intelligence team that carried out missions to destabilize Nazi Germany. Colonel Klink was inordinately fond of boasting, ""There has never been an escape from Stalag 13!"" But why escape, when you can come and go at will through your own secret tunnel that reaches back to the Allied lines? As a matter of fact, Hogan's men even worked hard in one episode not to be transferred to another camp.

The show had many elements of slapstick and some thoroughly unbelievable moments. Often, the show stretched the viewers' suspension of disbelief to the breaking point, particularly when `new prisoners' (i.e., people being spirited out of Germany by the Underground) came and went without explanation or question by Klink and his men or bald evidence of the team's elaborate espionage was uncovered. These moments resulted in doubletalk marathons that were legendary.

It wasn't all fun and games though. The show did not shy away from addressing the prisoners' food shortages. Their dependence on the Geneva Convention was constantly addressed. There was a real sense of unease evident in the prisoners' relationships with the guards, including the very real risk of punishment if caught at their underground activities. Most of the `real' elements of the show were lifted from the fine war movies of the era, such as THE GREAT ESCAPE, BRIDGE OVER THE RIVER KWAI, and, in particular, STALAG 17, from which so many elements (most notably the Chief Guard Sergeant Schultz) were taken that the producers of that film sued the producers of HOGAN'S HEROES and won a still-memorable copyright infringement lawsuit.

In spite of (or perhaps because of) the comedy, the show evidenced a real respect for the travails of men who had been real POWs during the War. One of the great ironies of HOGAN'S HEROES is that virtually every actor who played a recurring role as a German Officer, was in real life, Jewish. Not only were Werner Klemperer (Colonel Klink), John Banner (Sergeant Schultz), Leon Askin (General Burkhalter) and Howard Caine (Major Hochstetter) all Jews, but they all (along with Robert Clary, who played Cpl. LeBeau on the Allied side) were survivors of the Shoah. Werner Klemperer even had a clause in his contract stating that the show's writers were never to allow Klink to ultimately outwit Hogan. My father, who had been in Dachau, loved to watch HOGAN'S HEROES and laughed heartily at its inspired silliness; he, a Korean War veteran, also loved M*A*S*H, God rest his soul.

Kommandant Klink was a self-important, insecure, pompously Prussian monocle-wearing clown. Hogan played upon his insecurities like a piano.  Schultz was an easygoing chief jailer whose sympathies clearly lay with the Allies (unless his superiors were around). His, ""I know nothing! . . . I hear nothing! . . . I see nothing!"" characterization inspired Artie Johnson's ""Verrrry interesting!"" German soldier on LAUGH-IN and later Christopher Lloyd's own thoroughly bewildered Sergeant Schultz in Mel Brooks' TO BE OR NOT TO BE.

Robert Clary and Richard Dawson were to go on to stardom in their own right, Dawson as the original host of FAMILY FEUD, famous for kissing every female who ever appeared on that show. Bob Crane died in the late 1970s under unusual circumstances.

HOGAN'S HEROES may not be as sophisticated as the comedies that followed it, but it is an affectionate homage to the real heroes who gave a measure of their lives, whatever it may have been, to the defense of freedom.",1298678400,5,4460,5.040705563093622

6135411,1,B00H6YAB16,"I bought this DVD set as a gift for my boyfriend who is a DVD-phile and loves vintage television shows that he grew up with.  To begin, the show, Hogan's Heroes, was on his ""wish list"" so I thought I would surprise him. Sadly, the only surprise was his disappointment and his (and my) waste of time and effort tying to put together a ""damage-free"" set....  After three (3) attempts, he never got to see so much as one complete episode.  Hence, my rating of one (1) star....  The first set arrived in a shambles...... The AMAZON.COM packing was adequate but still many of the DVD's arrived loose from their storage sleeves and were scratched.  Consequently, some of the discs would not play.  The loose DVDs were the result of very poorly designed packaging by the manufacturer.  The set comes as a box with multiple cardboard booklets holding the DVDs.  Unfortunately, the cardboard sleeves/booklets offer no protection and invite scrathes and wear to DVDs over time.  The real tragedy is that even a little jostling during shipping will make the discs slip out of their cases and become scratched.  The second set (to replace the first) was an unbelievable fiasco.  The set arrived crushed from poor packing and almost all of the DVDs were loose and scratched.  However, the strange thing we noticed was that this set arrived without its plastic ""wrap-around"" sleeve (with the picture of the super-imposed German Pickelhaube helmet and the WWII American Air Force Colonel's cap) that surrounds the carboard box nor did it have any cellophane wrapping.  My boyfriend is of the opinion that the shipping warehouse tried to pull a ""fast one"" by sending a set that had already been returned....  Judging from the condition of the DVDs and missing inserts, I can't say he was wrong to think that....  The third set (and final) was a reinactment of the first two sets.  This time, the set was wrapped with cello but, curiously, the plastic ""wrap-around"" sleeve (with the super-imposed German helmet, etc.) was missing again....  The final set also suffered from multiple loose and scratched DVDs.....  This expereince was, in a word, ""pathetic""....  Is AMAZON.COM (or Paramount) "" by recycling"" returned DVDs?  I don't want to say but the condition and missing packaging elements of the two replacement shipments look very suspicious....  The real root the problem is the poorly conceived packaging by the manufacturer.  Anyone with the IQ of a turnip can see it is woefully inadeqaute for the safe shipping and storage of DVDs.  Paramount (the manufacturer) should be ashamed.... Also, AMAZON.COM needs to take a hard look at its shipping methods.  Far to many DVD sets I've ordered for myself have arrived crushed or damaged due to inadequate packing and...well....just plain stupidity....(For example, sending expensive and fragile DVD sets in padded envelopes?!?!?!?!).  For those of you contemplating ordering this DVD set, consider yourselves warned.....",1274832000,190,2955,5.055785123966942
6135412,5,B00H6YAB16,"Great service by Amazon with the order being despatched without delay (seems to be a regular ""plus"" feature of theirs).  Even by surface international post to New Zealand the order arrived quite promptly.

The box is about 2 inches thick -- and holds 6 folders, with varying numbers of discs each that fit into ""slots"" in side of each folder.  This is quite sensible inasmuch as it can keep each series intact and in order.  The box itself is a little flimsy and could be broken rather easily, but on the other-hand, I would expect most users to handle it fairly carefully, in which case it should last quite well.  The box has a protective clear plastic sleeve which has been overprinted with the relevant graphics and titles.  Looks really good.

So far I have not had any trouble reading any disk and have had a lot of enjoyment.  For the record, these disks are Zone 1 (so I believe), whilst I am using a multi-zone player in an otherwise Zone 4 area.

Only one notable adverse point is the lack of synchronisation between the video and voice tracks.  What happened???  The difference is not great, but it is noticeable and just a bit annoying if I let it irk me.

Since I love all things Hogan I had to have this.  I know some people will think I'm stupid for doing it however.  The set arrived in perfect shape.  It consists of a red cardboard sleeve that has all 6 seasons stacked in it.  The edges of the sleeves that hold the discs form the image of the guard tower when arranged side by side in order, kind of cool I think.  The sleeves are basic once you remove them.  They are cardboard with images from the show, and have slots inside for the individual discs.  The back flap has a list of the episodes and/or special features listed for each disc.  There is one drawback on the back of the plastic cases for the discs that came in the individual season box sets it lists the name of each episode, a short description of what it is about and the original air date.  The sleeves in this set just list the name of each episode, and the air date.  I guess that's not a big deal, but I wish they had added that.  There is a clear sleeve that slides down over the red box that has the Hogan's Heroes logo on it and the iconic image of Colonel Hogan's cap resting on top of Klink's WWI helmet, that appeared in the opening credits.  The discs that come with this set are the exact same ones that came in the individual season sets, they even have the same photos on them.  Then there's the Kommandant's Kollection disc.  This disc has a lot of extra stuff on it that any Hogan's fan will love.  There is a photo montage set to the theme song performed by Bob Crane's band.  There is an episode ""The Safecracker Suite"" that is shown in German with English subtitles so you can see how the show is shown in Germany.  There is a lengthy interview with Richard Dawson discussing the show, there is also several other extras that are really neat.  I know most people who already have the complete series individually in box sets probably will not buy this, but a Hogan's Heroes fanatic like myself will love it.  I'm going to save this as a ""Kollector's"" item and continue to use my individual sets for viewing.

will help jog your memory. While it wasn`t one of the very best tv comedies, it was very good and never failed to produce some
very good laughs. Back in the 60s and early 70s there were many good comedies, and if a show was to survive more than a couple
of seasons it had to be good. So they put everything they had into a show. Good acting, good jokes and gags, ect.
One of the shows strongest points was its depth of characters. It didn`t depend on just 2 or 3 main characters to make the show.
While Hogan, Schultz, and Klink were the center characters all of the supporting characters were very good and played by fine
actors. Even those who only appeared occasionally, like Leon Askin as the acidic General Burkhalter and Kathleen Freeman who
played his husband hunting sister, were good comedians and excellent actors.",1264291200,3,953,4.514450867052023

I do miss the television decency censors.",1523491200,,421,4.648648648648648

They just could have done a whole lot better.  I cannot comment on the quality of this product b/c I did not view it.",1499817600,,251,3.69811320754717
8630367,5,B00H6YAB16,I am writing this because of some of the other people who wrote they were unhappy with packaging and said discs were scratched and such! Well that is bogus!!! It was very nicely packaged and i was very impressed with the way the DVD sleeves are! Yes they are not plastic but over all it is very nice and organized!! If you are a fan of this show as i am this is a must for your collection!!,1498953600,,390,4.012820512820513
