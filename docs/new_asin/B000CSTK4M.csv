8101943,4,B000CSTK4M,"Before they became cartoon icons, the Looney Tunes were just little babies in diapers trying to figure out the world with the help of Granny. They played together, they learned together, they even have little adventures together. The usual antics of the Looney Tunes such as dynamite, shotguns, and other slapstick moments have been replaced with bouncy and playful comedy as well as the development of these little kids imaginations.

I realize that the show is rated TV-Y and that its intended for children with single digit ages, not Generation Y members like me. I have nothing to gain from the lessons taught in these episodes because Ive seen it all. But darn it, those little Looney Tune babies are so cute! Teeny tiny little animal children bouncing around and playing in little cloth diapers! I usually get this giddy when I visit the Humane Society and check out all of their kitties and puppies.

I wish there was a Humane Society for the Looney Tunes, because Id scoop up Baby Bugs Bunny and rock him back and forth until he fell asleep and drooled on my arms! Aww!! Id give Tazz a belly rub, Id give Sylvester an ear scratch, and Id even play with Daffy Ducks bill! This show gets a passing grade just for the cuteness overload. Death by cuteness: what a way to go. Hehe!

From an educational perspective, the lessons learned by the little Looney Tunies at the end of every episode are actually useful to human children. Share your toys, exercise your imagination, be nice to each other, try new things, these are all ideals that parents try hard enough to pass onto their children. And now you have a cute and cuddly show like Baby Looney Tunes passing on these important values that permeate all belief systems.

The one lesson out of the items Ive listed that I believe is most important is to exercise your creativity when you're young. It all begins when you're a little guy and you see something in a book or TV show that excites you and inspires your imagination.

Theres another lesson Id like to add to that: don't let anybody ridicule you for having a vivid imagination in the first place. Growing up to be a dull and boring person stems from such negativity. Look at the Looney Tunes all grown up now: do they look boring and dull to you? No, and its because Granny nurtured their little minds every step of the way and never told them they couldn't do something (unless it was dangerous to themselves or other people).

Ive earned the reputation of being a giant man baby around the house. I watch TV-Y and TV-Y7 rated shows and I find cuteness in everything those shows provide me. If you gain the same reputation for watching Baby Looney Tunes, embrace it. Embrace your inner child and never grow up. The real world is a cold and lonely place. But inside your overactive imagination, theres a spiritual force that will never let you down.",1471564800,,2865,4.596868884540117
