2875631,5,B000RW3VDO,"Two quick things.  This film is called ""Shooting Dogs"" in the rest of the world.  That title refers to the UN soldiers not being able to use their weapons to protect anyone, but they could use them to shoot the dogs to keep them from feeding on the dead bodies that were rotting everywhere around Rwanda during those horrible days.  Also, the characters of the Priest and Joe Connor (and maybe others) are fictional creations through which a true story is told.  The events happened as depicted at the technical school.  In fact, much of the film was shot at the actual school where these horrors occurred.

The time frame of the film is only a few days in April 1994, but the tension is so great that it seems as if it lasted forever.  I don't want to tell you exactly what happens in the movie, but it is a film about choices.  Everyone in the movie has alternatives and what they choose to do will leave you horrified, pained, and, in some cases, amazed.

There is one bit of video that I believe is actual news footage of an American (I believe) diplomat trying the most awful locutions to try and avoid saying the word genocide.  Young people who were born in the late 1980s or early 1990s are young enough to not even be aware of the slaughter of 800,000 people in 100 days in 1994.  There are several good movies on the subject and I recommend that we educated our young people on the subject.  What recommends this film, in my mind, is the fact that we see how closely the Hutus and Tutsis lived and worked at the school before the slaughter began.  Everyone who sees the film will wonder how people could turn on each other like this.  The movie also gives the lie to the phony concept of race.

John Hurt is terrific as the worn out but still devoted Catholic priest, Christopher.  Hugh Dancy also gives a sensitive performances as Joe Connor.  The whole cast does a great job.  Beware for kids who are too young.  There are scenes of violence and dead bodies, but no close ups of the slaughter.  This is not an exploitation film.

Just see the film!  Excellent and searingly memorable.

This opportunity to get insight should not be bypassed for those of us who wish to know more of what actually took place in Rwanda and helps lift the fog away for those of us living for away from its occurrences. It also shows how very tribal this continent is and how difficult it is for a by-stander to penetrate let alone change the mentality of its indigenous populations and its views on one another - and raises an important question:-Should we involve ourselves in this or remain on the side lines? From a purely humanitarian point of view the answer should be an unequivocal 'yes'. -However,from a historic point of view what can the 'West'(maybe not correctly labelled) possibly hope to achieve when battling such hard and deep-rooted issues as racism? Or when happening on a foreign continent where so different values are represented, given that many countries still have so much to go through before they start taking their own populations seriously, putting different backgrounds and ethnicity forward as positive features and as features of wealth, rather than a short-coming.

2875637,5,B000RW3VDO,"Like its predecessors, Hotel Rwanda & Sometimes in April [a HBO presentation], Beyond the Gates is a searing account of the horrors of the Rwandan genocide of 1994 that claimed over 800,000 lives. Yet, this movie is on some levels more poignant as it examines people's faith in the face of human hatred and man's inhumanity towards another.

The movie centers around Father Christopher [John Hurt in an amazingly inspiring performance] who is the parish priest based at the Ecole Technique Officielle, a technical school that is also the base of a UN peacekepping force that is mainly there in the capacity of observers. John Hurt plays the role of the priest here with a strong touch of humanity, humility and love for his parishioners. There is also Joe Connor [Hugh Dancy] who plays an idealistic young teacher who finds himself confused and helpless when the horrors of the genocide become more apparent to him.

Of course, for those familiar with the history of the Rwandan genocide, there need be no elaboration on what the outcome in this movie is...to avoid giving too much away in terms of plot, the main story here deals with what happens to those seeking refuge at the school when the majority Hutus begin to exact horrific vengeance upon the minority Tutsi population by butchering, maiming, and murdering them with machetes - a death so horrific that we cannot but flinch and look away from the brutal, macabre scenes where no one is spared, be it children, women, elderly nuns etc.

In spite of the horrors of the story unfolding in this movie, we the viewers get to see human grace in the face of great evil, and this is something to take heart in. This is a definite must-see for all of us, especially given the horrors of man vs man, even till the present day, where genocide still happens, and when powerful nations continue to remain impotent in putting a stop to such atrocities.",1191456000,14,1899,4.731117824773414

2875639,5,B000RW3VDO,"To acknowledge the fact that genocides are still active in our supposedly enlightened times is terrifying, yet through films such as BEYOND THE GATES, HOTEL RWANDA, and SOMETIMES IN APRIL we are gradually bring informed about one particular genocide - that occurred in 1994 in Rwanda - and hopefully will make us as a global population more proactive in stemming the possibility of further acts of brutality and disregard of humanity. Writer David Wolstencroft and director Michael Caton-Jones have created one of the most powerfully poignant films about the genocide of the Tsutsi people by the Hutu people and by placing the film exactly where the genocide happened have added an intensely compelling atmosphere to an act that never should have happened.

In 1994, at the Ecole Technique Officielle, a school for the Rwandan children run by Europeans under the tutelage of Father Christopher (John Hurt) and with idealistic teachers such as the young Joe (Hugh Dancy), the incipient intertribal rioting between the Hutus and Tsutsis is 'monitored by the impotent United Nations led by Capitaine Delon (Dominique Horwitz). After the current leader of Rwanda is shot down in a helicopter tragedy, the Hutus begin killing the Tsutsi, butchering them with machetes and leaving the bodies to rot in the streets. The Tsutsis flock to the Ecole, looking for asylum and protection, and Father Christopher and Joe do everything in their power to provide food and shelter and safety. One particularly gifted student Marie (Claire-Hope Ashitey) works closely with the two men, gaining their admiration and love, and representing the desperate need of the Tsutsis. The UN forces refuse to fire on the invading Hutus and finally evacuate all white Europeans to be flow to safety out of Africa. It is this final abandonment of the Tsutsis that underlies the ensuing slaughter of those who sought help within the Ecole walls. And with showing the decimated Tsutsis the film ends with a few follow-up scenes that are deeply touching and immensely disturbing. It is clear that the film reveals how the world ignored the tragic genocide of 1994 and a more poignant statement has rarely been captured in writing, filming, direction, and acting.

John Hurt and Hugh Dancy are brilliant in their roles, but it is the performance of young Claire-Hope Ashitey that rivets our attention: she is a wonder of an actress and deserves awards for her intensely realistic performance. The film's story is already known (hopefully) so there can be no spoilers here. And therein lies the agonizing reality that the world stood by and let this happen. Every world citizen should be required to see this powerful film in hopes that such atrocities will be prevented in the future. But then there is now Darfur.....

Based on a true story about the ETO massacre, there are harrowing moments in the film with passing scenes of murdered bodies on the streets. I'll never forget how a father pleaded with the UN soldiers to kill all of them with guns rather than machetes. He even pleaded to kill the children rather than them face the machete.

2875646,5,B000RW3VDO,"This movie is not quite a documentary film, which carries a different sort of technique of getting the point across. Nor is it a ""Hollywood-ized"" actor-centric/ego-centric mess. It focuses on capturing the events as inspired by people who were present during the actual genocide. The main gist behind this film is how politics are often out of sync with actual events. The movie does so by presenting a movie that contains a lot of historical content.

The pace of the movie is slower than you might think, although you know the end result is near and coming quickly. It shows the human struggle for morality. It even achieves this through the main characters' struggle with being virtuous despite everything going to hell around them. Why be good in the face of such evil? Where is God in this mess? And do I owe anyone anything?

It also is a lot less about suspense. There is no real suspense, but yet there is a tremendous amount of fear and your nerves are tingling. This is - at least for me - because you know that it concerns something that actually happened.

Appropriately, it is not about gore. It discourages me when I see an overabundance of gore to ""entertain"" American audiences. There should be no entertainment in someone else's death. This movie is disturbing at times, but it is done artistically, in such a way as to get the message across without over-emphasizing the brutality of physical killing. It emphasizes the brutality of doing nothing when action is required. It also emphasizes how you can't be willy-nilly in regards to ethics, for choices have consequences.

In conclusion, if you are using this for educational purpose, you may want to find out preliminary information first. It does not really go into why this situation is happening here and now in 1994. It doesn't show how the conflict ended either. It is just there to get you to think about the political and ethical questions still relevant today.",1431302400,4,1938,4.776119402985074

2875656,5,B000RW3VDO,"This 112-minute docudrama (edited from the R-rated theatrical cut to soften some language and violence) depicts the 1994 Rwandan genocide in uber-realistic fashion. The DVD also includes a theatrical trailer and 38-minute making-of feature that emphasizes the film's noble intentions. Here we learn that director Michael Caton-Jones shot the film on its real-life Rwandan locations (unlike ""Hotel Rwanda"" which was filmed in South Africa with South African actors) and used genocide survivors in his cast and crew.

The story is a lightly fictionalized account of a Salesian Catholic mission where 2,000 Tutsis took refuge from Hutu militias under the temporary protection of occupying Belgian U.N. peacekeeping forces who were themselves powerless to enforce peace. John Hurt conveys courageous determination in his role as Father Christopher, a Catholic missionary priest and head of the school who tries to give the refugees hope despite seeing the situation very clearly. Hugh Dancy plays an idealistic young Peace Corps-style volunteer who teaches at the school and whose naive idealism leaves him helpless to do anything effective. Both men face the moral dilemma of whether to stay in Rwanda and face death or be evacuated with other Europeans and Americans fleeing the country.

This 2007 film (titled ""Shooting Dogs"" outside the U.S.) was produced by BBC films and has a distinctly British flavor. Other key characters include a female BBC reporter, the Belgian U.N. commander at the school, and a convent of African Salesian nuns. There are not significant amounts of onscreen violence or blood here, at least not much beyond a PG-13 level, but the imagery and content is horrifying. It's a more unflinching and less hopeful look at what happened in 1994 than the inspiring ""Hotel Rwanda"" with Don Cheadle, but its exploration of God's allowance of suffering makes it a deeper and more complex film. Hurt shines as the heroic priest, giving a believable portrait of faith under fire, seeking out ever-desperate ways to minister to his Rwandan flock even as the secular West abandons them.

Critics gave overwhelmingly favorable reviews to ""Beyond the Gates."" It also won the ""Heartland Truly Moving Picture Award,"" given at the Heartland Film Festival to many of my favorite movies. It is certainly worth a look as a compassionate exploration of the darker side of human behavior.",1400198400,,2390,5.267716535433071

I liked Hotel Rwanda, but thought that it seemed sanitized or watered down.  The Genocide was horifically violent, and while many filmmakers or documentarians acknowledge this, they hardly display it.  This film was honest with the fear that Rwandans felt during those 100 days, the frustration that the UN soldiers felt about not being able to defend the people who came to them for protection, and the lack of international response to the situation.  I thoroughly enjoyed John Hurt as the priest who manages to maintain a brave face in the face of death, and Hugh Dancy was excellent as the teacher faced with the choice of escaping to safety with the UN forces, or staying to face probable death with the people who have become his friends.  Overall, I would recommend anyone who is interested in learning more about the Genocide to see this film, but I must stress that THIS IS NOT A FILM FOR CHILDREN.

2875675,5,B000RW3VDO,"This is a small budget BBC film that explains the heart break of the Rwandan genocide as succinctly as possible when telling only one aspect. In the Uk it was released as `shooting dogs' as the UN were only allowed to shoot the dogs that had taken to eating the corpses of the victims, the Un were not allowed to use their firearms to defend the victims. One of a catalogue of disasters that added up to the 1994 genocide.

The film stars John Hurt as a Priest based in a UN school where new teacher (Hugh Dancey) is building up a positive reputation and has a star pupil who he wants to encourage. When the fighting breaks out they are convinced that the UN will protect everyone in the school and those who flock to them for protection. However, as anyone who knows anything about this tragic affair, the UN not only pulled out but only offered succour to Europeans; actually it was only French and Belgians at first.

The priest and the teacher face the dilemma of staying with their charges or escaping with their lives and both choose different courses of action both with life changing consequences.
Shot on actual location and actually featuring some of the actual survivore4 as both cast and crew and deals not only with the Rwandan genocide but asks us to examine how we would react when faced with evil of such magnitude. Brilliantly directed by Michael Calton-Jones and BAFTA nominated this film does not pull its' punches and is far better than the similar themed `Hotel Rwanda', though that was admirable in that it was Hollywood making a film about uncomfortable truths so should be lauded for that too.

This movie shows a historic reality that the black Hutu tribe unleashed a genocide against the black Tutsi tribe,which included the hacking up of tutsi children and babies. Just as Germans killed the French and the French killed the Russians ETC , warfare and genocide have occured within all of the races. They were all white but that did not stop them from slaughtering one another. This film should be watched by all,especially by those who think that when such events happen that they can be neutral and be okay. It must be watched by those black people who champion racial conflict between blacks and whites. Not all black people are their friends and not all white people are their enemies. When we all realize that we are all just human and we all have been guilty of persecuting others at some time in history,maybe we can begin to grasp for brotherhood and peace. Maybe we will reject the demagogues. This movie will help the viewer to see that even a poor Rwandan Hutu will mutilate his' neighbor,that he does not have to be a white SS trooper.

  ""Beyond the Gates"" is a Michael Caton-Jones film ""based on real events and made at the locations depicted"" in the film.  It recounts certain of the events of the 1994 genocide in Rwanda at a specific location in Kigali, Rwanda, and affecting specific persons.  It stars John Hurt and Hugh Dancy.  John Hurt plays Father Christopher, the Roman Catholic priest at the Ecole Technique Officielle, a secondary school run by Europeans, and Hugh Dancy plays John, an idealistic young teacher at the school.  These two main European characters are entrained with the United Nations forces who are observers of the peace stationed on their school grounds.  Other important non-Rwandans depicted are a journalism crew consisting of a female reporter/interviewer and a cameraman.  The complexity of their interactions in the face of the initiation of the Rwandan genocide gradually revealed the extent of the massacre.  Their reactions to the events they learn are going on around them mirror the difficulty of getting accurate information, believing what is occurring, and the gamut of human responses available under the circumstances.  The portrayal of the effects of the Hutu and Tutsi interactions in the days leading up to the coup which initiates the Rwandan genocide lays the matrix for the genocide in the African country of Rwanda and bares the realities of identification papers, deliberate enrolments of Tutsi in lists for location and identification by officials (and those who would kill them), and the gaps between ostensible neighbors, classmates, friends, and families.

  ""Every man is given the key to the gates of heaven.  The same key opens the gates of hell. - Buddhist proverb"" opens the film as white lettering on a black screen.  This is followed by ""This film is based on real events and was made at the locations depicted.""  Then a brief introduction of the situation of Rwanda in 1994 is on the screen, appearing a sentence at a time, accompanied by the sound of insects chirping as the soundtrack - ""RWANDA 1994: For thirty years the majority Hutu government has persecuted the minority Tutsi people. ... Under pressure from the West, the Hutu president has reluctantly agreed to share power with the Tutsis.  ...  The UN has deployed a small force around Kigali, the capital, to monitor the fragile peace.""  The sound swells to a human voice in lamentation conjoined with the sound of one running and imagery of only the feet and sandals and skirt of one running.  This fades into the depiction of a convoy of military vehicles travelling through a jeering crowd of cavorting men with machetes and guns.  All is obscured by the dust of the vehicles and the screen fills with the dust.  From within this dust the title appears over the indeterminately visible faces of the jeering men with detectable implements of killing, mostly machetes, some maces, and spiked balls on poles. Eventually, the dust obscures all but the title, ""BEYOND THE GATES,"" and the dust fades into black, with only the title visible, which now appears as white against a black screen. In this opening montage the story is told in its simplest formulation: all humans arise from the darkness of non-existence, run their course, and fade into the dust again.  We learn in the course of the film that what they do in the life they are given determines what lies beyond the gates of death.

  The world-weariness of Father Christopher is belied by his Eucharistic ministry, his assistance at the birth of child in the midst of the chaos within and without the school, and his substitutionary sacrifice of himself to save some children from the massacre after the UN forces leave the school compound.  This is set in comparison with John's fleeing the coming death despite his rashly given promise to remain and against the life of one of the children saved by Father Christopher, who remembers him saying, ""Sacrifice is the most you can love someone.""  She observes, ""All this time we have been given, we must use it wisely.""  Indeed, we shall all pass beyond the gates of life into dust.  Beyond the Gates moves the material into the eternal realm, engendering the will to live sacrificially, wisely and like Christ in all that occurs.

  This film is worth your time in the watching and in the reflection it will undoubtedly provoke.",1271289600,,4636,4.915167095115681
2875679,5,B000RW3VDO,"I had never heard of this movie until I was browsing the video section at the library and came across it.
I had just watched ""Ella Enchanted"" earlier in the week that also has Hugh Dancy in it. The roles Hugh plays in these two films show a complete difference in character. Many actors seem to be hired because of a past playing similar roles.

In Beyond the Gates, Hugh showed his ability to act, and to really hold back when the roll required it.

Beyond the Gates was heart-breaking, eye-opening, and well-done. Knowing that this film was based on true events and that many of the crew who made the film were there during this ""act of"" genocide, and experienced great loss in their families, gave it even more of an impact. And these events all happened in Rwanda less than 20 years ago.

When the UN military was leaving the school and the Tsutsi gentleman asked the Commanding Officer to shoot the children rather than allow the Hutu to kill them with machetes, I almost wanted the CO to grant the request. Prior to this scene, the CO almost came across as callous and unfeeling, uncaring, evil. He refused to grant the request. And the actor brought it across like he was considering it, but ultimately couldn't bring himself to shoot children. What kind of horror does a man, a father, have to face in order to even have to consider asking that his children be shot to death, because it would be less painful than the manner they were certain to die by later?

I would not allow children to watch this film, as it contains a great degree of senseless acts of violence.
This would be a good film to show in a college level class, or even high school (with parent permission) in World History classes, sociology, psychology, or philosophy even.",1263945600,,1750,4.5284810126582276
2875680,5,B000RW3VDO,"A remarkable movie based on real people (or at least one). John Hurt's character is very similar to the actions of Father Vjeko Curic. A Catholic priest, Father Vjeko refused to leave Rwanda during the genocide and saved thousands of lives, both Tutsi and Hutu, at great peril to himself. After the genocide ended he stayed to try to help with the ""reconciliation"". Sadly, Father Vjeko was murdered by persons unknown in 1998.",1263600000,,426,4.8493150684931505
2875681,5,B000RW3VDO,"This hooked me from the start and never let go. This is not a Hollywood take on the Rwandan genocide, and that's fine. It is superb in its own right. It somehow manages to pull no punches without hitting you over the head. But it does grab your heart. Incredibly powerful, engrossing and disturbing. Don't see it if you need some light entertainment. But see it.",1259971200,,362,4.5
2875682,5,B000RW3VDO,I was satisfied with my purchase of this movie.  Very moving movie about the genecide in Rawanda. It is how the French or Belgum came to this country and stuck their nose where it wasn't wanted and cause mass killing.,1259539200,,217,4.425
2875683,5,B000RW3VDO,"""Beyond the Gates"" (aka ""Shooting Dogs"") is a shattering true-life drama set during the Rwandan genocide of 1994 - a holocaust in which over 800,000 unarmed Tutsis were brutally massacred by their gun- and machete-toting Hutu neighbors simply for being ""different.""  This harrowing and heartbreaking film focuses on a Catholic priest and a young American teacher who find themselves caught up in a human tragedy of unimaginable proportions when a large group of terrified Tutsis flee to the school for safety and protection (a comforting but, as it turns out, utterly impotent U.N. ""peacekeeping force"" has also set up shop there).

Comparisons to the earlier, better-known ""Hotel Rwanda"" are as an inevitable as they are irrelevant, for ""Beyond the Gates"" is a searing and unforgettable movie in its own right, filled with indelible imagery and pulse-pounding suspense.  The brilliant screenplay by David Wolstencroft (based on the book by Richard Alwyn and David Belton) focuses as much on the moral dilemma taking place within the souls of the two white men as it does on the unspeakable tragedy occurring in the world outside.  Both men, utterly powerless in the face of such a monumental event, are forced to question whether the religious dogma that they espouse so readily in times of peace has any real efficacy or relevance in times when the very fabric of humanity seems to be coming apart at the seams.  Director Michael Caton-Jones has provided scene after scene in which characters - both major and minor - are forced to re-examine their commitment to themselves, the people around them and the belief systems they've adopted to get themselves through life.  The movie also points out just how shamefully the outside world acted in turning a blind eye to what was happening in that country, refusing to step in at any point to try and bring the situation under control, and then  proffering lame excuses to justify its inaction once it was all over.

With many actual survivors of the holocaust working both behind the camera as technical assistants and in front of it as extras and minor characters, the film brilliantly recreates the events with devastating immediacy and accuracy (the movie was also filmed at the actual locations where the incidents themselves took place, greatly enhancing its verisimilitude).  Moreover, John Hurt as the priest and Hugh Dancy as the teacher deliver soul-searing, gut-wrenching performances that get to the heart of what it truly means to be one`s brother`s keeper.

Acts of such unmitigated savagery and brutality, especially when conducted on this massive a scale, are so incomprehensible in their horror that it would be virtually impossible for any single work of art to successfully grasp the meaning behind them.  But by personalizing the issues and placing the events within the context of a series of universally identifiable moral dilemmas, the makers of this extraordinarily fine film have perhaps come as close as is humanly possible to achieving that end.  Don't miss it.",1212883200,3,3035,5.109090909090909
2875684,5,B000RW3VDO,"This is a devastating film, which accurately recreates the nightmare of the Rwandan genocide.  The bottom line is that one man was a true hero, and that person could have been you or me! The question we should all ask ourselves after watching Beyond The Gates - when is it worth laying down our life  for another human being(s)?

I have to admit, I only watched the beginning, a few segments in the middle, and the ending. It was too upsetting to watch it from beginning to end.  I did, however, have enough motivation to act, and I have written a carefully written letter to someone currently serving in the U.S. Senate to:

1. Substantially increase aide to Rwanda.

2. Treat political refugees from around the world equally and with same high regard our government has given Cuban refuges

3. Issue a public apology to the people of Rwanda on behalf of the United States for the inappropriate behavior of the Clinton administration during the genocide.

4. Advocate for a similar apology from the United Nations for their inappropriate behavior.

5. Strengthen United Nation institutions so their cowardly behavior in Rwanda is never repeated again, a situation clearly shown in devastating fashion in ""Beyond The Gates.""

6. Have the U.S. Department of Education compile age appropriate curriculum to teach specifically about the Rwandan genocide and how governments can work to prevent, or intervene in, future genocides. I believe young people hear about what happened a long time ago, during World War 2, and they develop a false sense of security that an event like the Holocaust has never happened (or will ever happen) again.

Even though I'm only one voice crying in the wilderness, I'm glad I have the nerve to hope for a better world!

2875685,4,B000RW3VDO,"I enjoyed this movie. It is a moving story of a secondary school in Rwanda, which during the 1994 massacres became a refugee point for more then 2,500 Rwandans and many whites protected by UN forces. Soon after the white people were evacuated. The Rwandans were then abandoned by the UN soldiers, and then murdered.

The story revolves around a priest and a teacher. The priest decides to stay, rescues a few people and while doing so is killed.  Unfortunately when I did some research on the net on the movie, I discovered that this was fiction, the white priest went out with the whites.

The acting was acceptable probably the best is John Hurt who made a moving performance.

The filming was adequate. Still with all this horror you would have thought a modern movie could have done better.

I did like the bit at the end where it showed some people who worked on the movie who suffered in the massacres although interestingly none of them were actors.",1209168000,,956,4.6

2875689,5,B000RW3VDO,"The '05 release `Beyond the Gates' is not a film to watch if you're in the mood for an evening of light, escapist entertainment. Based on true events during the Rwandan genocide in '94, this film delivers a riveting, disturbing and profound examination of human nature, hatred, suffering and the innate desire to find God in the chaos when He's no where to be found. Watching the UN official refusing to acknowledge these horrific circumstances as genocide clearly shows how far removed from the truth the world has strayed.

As I sit at the computer writing this review I see in my mind's eye the dark, beautiful African face of Clare-Hope Ashitey who played the part of Marie, student and love interest to Joe (Hugh Dacy), an occidental teacher who came to Africa hoping to ""make a difference"". When Marie asks him ""why did you leave us"" her question is nothing less than an indictment of mankind.

My Highest Recommendation.",1204243200,12,927,4.7875
2875690,4,B000RW3VDO,"Simple, easy review.

A quiet movie of 2007 that has (and should) sneak it's way into the hearts of many.

A tale of the horrific genocide trappings of Rwanda.
John Hurt is outstanding as Father Christopher, running a school which is governed by the Catholic Church and protected by the United Nations.
The school becomes a refugee camp for those who are trying to escape the genocide! The school houses 2500 refugees...

As the school yard is locked down, one young teacher finds himself in a personal struggle to save himself or the students he has grown to love.

A great movie, also Called ""Shooting Dogs"", is quite heart stopper that should come out of the shadows of ""Hotel Rwanda"".  (Will state not equally as good, but a very close one... and it needs to be seen).",1199664000,,772,4.605839416058394
