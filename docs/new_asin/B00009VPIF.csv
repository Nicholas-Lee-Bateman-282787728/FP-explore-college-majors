1891089,1,B00009VPIF,"DARK MOUNTAIN(1944)---Robert Lowery, Ellen Drew, Regis Toomey, Eddie Quillan, Elisha Cook, Jr.
A deservedly obscure little ""B"" movie starring Robert Lowery as a forest ranger who is in love with Ellen Drew.  Quillan plays Lowery's moronic fellow forest ranger and he is as annoying as hell!!!  Toomey plays a crook who traffics in wartime ""black market"" goods.  Typically, Cook plays one of Toomey's henchmen who talks too much and is killed off.  Drew is initially unaware of how Toomey makes his money and, although she loves Lowery, she opts to marry Toomey because he can give her the ""good life"" that Lowery can't on his meager salary.  Lowery accepts her decision with good grace and assures her that, if she ever needs him, he'll ""be there"".  When Drew discovers the truth about Toomey, she is appropriately horrified and wants to get away from him.  Because of Cook's ""big mouth"", things get hot for Toomey and he has to ""go on the lam"".  He forces Drew to accompany him to a cabin in the same patch of woods that Lowery ""works"".  Toomey threatens to kill Lowery if Drew doesn't play along.  Dim-witted Lowery eventually figures it all out, rescues Drew, and they look forward to a happy life together ""in the pine forest""!  This is one of those films that is so bad, it's fun to watch, occasionally, just for laughs---and, mercifully, it clocks in at just over an hour!  It is part of a 10 movie set entitled, ""Tough Guys And Gals"", from Alpha Video.  TRIVIA NOTE: Lowery's biggest claim to fame is playing Batman in the 1949 serial.",1259366400,,1542,4.687732342007435

7993169,4,B00009VPIF,"I really enjoyed this short film, probably because I'm a lover of national forests, their fires, and the many stories in those settings.  This is light entertainment, and the plot conforms to the genre with few surprises.  The ranger is a man of great character, as shown when he defies authority on a fire line and rescues two horses from peril.  The gangster is exactly what we would expect, while the woman and her motives are murkier.  There are several scenes at a remote post during fire season where the hero and his comic sidekick wile away long hours on Dark Mountain, probably fire watching.  Tension builds as the woman and her gangster husband hideout in an unused cabin.  The end had a chase scene, complete with the dog.  As other reviews have commented, this is a typical war-time film.  I was impressed though, with the filming of the opening fire scenes; for its time, they were very convincing.",1479254400,,912,4.6918238993710695

7993175,4,B00009VPIF,"ALPHA VIDEO offers bargain priced, often hard-to-find vintage movies that are ideal for those willing to skip DVD extras. Their transfers show no evidence of restoration, so quality varies from one title to the next, with ""fair to good"" being the average.

DARK MOUNTAIN (1944) is a PARAMOUNT programmer, a minor crime drama that stars Robert Lowery as a forest ranger and Ellen Drew as the woman he loves.

Lowery waited for a promotion and pay increase before asking Drew to marry him, but he was a month too late, for she has a new husband, Regis Toomey. He's a manufacturing goods wholesaler who's apparently quite well off, even during wartime rationing.

We soon learn that Toomey is a crook, a hijacker that sells stolen merchandise to the highest bidder. Anyone who gets in his way, he kills. When Drew learns the truth about Toomey, she seeks out Lowery at his new mountain post. He puts her up at a vacant cabin about a mile away, but Toomey followed her there and now he's hiding out from a police dragnet.

Toomey threatens to murder Lowery if Drew tells him her husband's in the next room, so she has to stay quiet. But Lowery's no dummy; he has a feeling that Drew isn't alone in the cabin.

The story's climax is a chase down a winding mountainside road that includes a truck carrying a load of dynamite.

A darn good little picture and Toomey is outstanding as the villain.",1396483200,4,1391,4.566265060240964
