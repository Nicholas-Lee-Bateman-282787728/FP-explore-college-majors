4990292,5,B006HGXGWK,"Seeing the first version of Tainted Milk on the big screen was fun, with an audience cringing around me was great but I had no idea what the quality of the animation really was. On my HDTV it looks amazing. very busy, crazy art direction. Definitely dark and hard to take all in one bite but truly amazing. It's like seeing Holy Mountain or El Topo for the first time. Bombarded with constantly evolving original concepts it's difficult to keep on track plus constantly being shocked and such keeps the muscles tense. It was exhausting. Blown away",1329955200,5,547,4.649484536082475
4990293,5,B006HGXGWK,"The most original animation, scratch that, movie to come in a long time.  It will shock and awe...but it goes deeper than that, deep into your pyche and distors it up.  Besides having mind bending visuals that you will never be able to forget, it has some of the smartest and darkest dialouge imaginable.  There is simply just nothing like it.

This is a movie that everyone should try to get through...its a cult classic in the making.

Go get it.",1329955200,7,448,4.481481481481482

4990296,5,B006HGXGWK,"Apparently i need to be careful how i word my review. This is a very explicit movie with lots of very graphic scenes. A dog from the ""underworld"" manipulates a bunch of townspeople in a very damaged town with damaged people. Lots of very intense scenes of psychadelic effects and flashes. The movie is done in an old version of like computer graphics,so it may mess with your eyes. This is not for the weak at heart this is for the open minded people who want too seee a very dark & creative movie.

4990300,5,B006HGXGWK,"Where the Dead Go to Die

Remember how dark and bizarre Xavier Renegade Angel could be at times? That's what this reminded me of, only much, much darker. The anachronistic animation was grating at first, but it actually opened up a special kind of craziness that couldn't have been achieved with any other medium. ""Hell on film"" is a very apt description. It's uncomfortable, hypnotic and ugly. You come away feeling soiled, but not in a Slaughtered Vomit Dolls kind of way.

This film is equal parts art and horror. It depicts a specific psychological landscape that most people will not want to visit. IMO, Jimmy Screamerclauz could not have done a better job.",1395705600,,662,4.798245614035087
4990301,4,B006HGXGWK,"Sick, twisted, animated fun. this movie is a mind F%$#. seriously it's unbelievably trippy. You have to see it to believe it. It's hard to explain.",1384560000,,147,4.6923076923076925
4990302,2,B006HGXGWK,"I'd like to start this off by saying; I do not feel good about being negative about this film.  Mainly because, I have a good idea that this film was pretty much by just some friends doing what they can and make a disturbing film.  Really the only reason I've finally gotten around to writing this review is in the hopes that the creator sees it, and uses the criticism if he does another picture.  Because there was potential here, and some promise, there just wasn't enough to garner the entirety of the film.

The voice acting is terrible.  Unless you have found something worse (hard to imagine) this will be the worst voice acting you'll hear.  Again though, for most of the actors on this film, I can imagine this was there first time doing voice work so I am willing to overlook it to a point.  It's still bad, but understandably bad.

The animation...look, I can understand it was cheap.  The director most likely just went with the cheapest animation program that worked.  I can get that, but, if models are clipping through each other and the environments, and that most models don't have a walk, they more or less just glide; you go back and tone it up.  I'm sorry, again completely understand if it was what you could afford, but those are basic 3D animation principles, and at least need to look decent.

There really isn't a plot, at least one you would expect from an anthology.  There are three separate stories, with the vague implication that they are connected, but outside of two of the stories clearly taking place in the same town, you won't notice it.  One story is about a kid is tricked by a demon dog that his unborn brother is going to be the antichrist, the middle story I go into more detail below, and the last is about a deformed kid who loves a girl trapped in a kiddy porn ring.  That is it.

These stories (at least the first and last one) are merely means to set up the film's biggest flaw.  Now, I don't have a problem with blood, gore, and/or sex in film.  One of my favorite films is a Japanese Exploitation films called Horrors of Malformed Men.  However, even if you want to make a film that will be nothing but graphic images with the intent to disturb the audience, you have to give breathing time.  You have to balance the disturbing with the normal so that what is disturbing stays so.  This film does not have that.  It is nothing but disturbing images, themes and situations.  You will never feel like anything is really that disturbing because you have nothing it counteracts to.

However, with all that said and done there is still some good in the film.  It is broken into three stories, and the middle one, ""Liquid Memories"" is actually the best part of the film.  It is about a drug addict who finds that, through extracting a liquid from the back of the brain, can alter his memories.  The actor playing the voice of our protagonist for this segment is the best in the whole, and the premise alone has such potential that the faults of the movie have trouble bringing it down.  The big thing though is that this segment gives context to the disturbing images.  It doesn't help much but at least makes them not as random.

Where the Dead go to Die had promise, mainly from the middle segment, but was so bogged down by flaws and the sheer focus on disturbing imagery that ultimately it falls hard.  Where the Dead go to Die gets a two out of five, mainly because of that middle segment and a few scenes that work throughout.",1365811200,7,3475,4.433753943217666
4990303,5,B006HGXGWK,"Yes, this video is by far the worse imaginable thing that humans can try to create for now, but it has such bad graphics that probably kept it from being banned in the U.S. or am I just speaking to soon and it actually is banned, either way i think everyone should watch it for just the allusions it gives to a degree as to what you are seeing has actually happened and that is what makes it so damn terrible when viewing, just do not watch this if you have any mental instability what so ever, do not watch this if you think you have stability mentally either, if you are not careful it will haunt you for the rest of your life, especially since it is based in reality, but it will not tell you this, you have to know the articles of what it was based upon, and who it was made for. It gets an A for effort and if it ever becomes a live action budgeted movie, it would be the most horrendous and most celebrated thing to ever hit the horror/gruesome thing to come out in theaters, I doubt most people can even keep there sanity after watching this version. Last warning ever if you have kids do not see this movie at all. If children where to see this it would be the end of there little fragile minds.",1358985600,3,1203,4.101694915254237
4990304,5,B006HGXGWK,Three wonderfully macabre twisted tales that intertwine to create an odd surreal vision of pure insanity and torture that infects the mind and corrupts the soul with hypnotic diluted doctrines of draconian origin.,1353801600,,213,5.484848484848484
4990305,5,B006HGXGWK,"First I just want to say, I cannot believe how many people take the time to purchase or watch this film and they can't determine whether or not they are going to love or hate it before doing so. Just upon seeing the trailer, I knew it would likely be a disturbing one-of-a-kind experience that just might take things to a level of darkness I hadn't been to before - and it was exactly that. Who are these people complaining about horrible animation and a horrible story - did you NOT NOTICE the style of animation before you PURCHASED the movie? Did you not READ the synopsis before you purchased it? How do you not understand that the BUTCHERED style of animation goes perfectly in accompanying the BUTCHERED atmosphere, portraying the BRILLIANTLY INNOVATIVE (not terrible) plot concepts dealing with a BUTCHERED psyche. Hint to people who gave this one star: get better at knowing yourself. Get better at knowing what's for you, and what's not. This movie is a sheer masterpiece of it's own kind, I have never seen anything like it. It's perfect for what it is. For me personally, it is my FAVORITE FILM of 2012 thus far.

This is what the Silent Hill film should have felt like. Perhaps not with such over-the-top, disturbing content and subject matter - but the atmosphere and creativity of this film is 100% dead on - couldn't possibly be more shocking, discomforting, confusing, or eerie. It just reminds me of the very first time I played the first couple of Silent Hill games - that's why I was talking about the film as well. Not many things that exist match this level of creative darkness.

The actual subject matter truly takes it to the next level in a few areas as well - we'll just say brutal gore and sexual scenarios involving people who should not be in sexual scenarios with each other. That is the aspect that reminded me of Gummo and other similar films by similar filmmakers such as Harmony Korine or Larry Clark. Couldn't get much more offensive or disturbing.

Now, one of the only flaws in the entire movie is a few of the voice actors are a little hard to deal with - but that's not enough to even force me to give it a 9 instead of a 10. This is a one-of-a-kind experience, and it's surreal - bad voice acting just adds to the absurdity of it.

The concepts are extremely innovative and thought provoking - offering perspectives you most likely would not have thought of before involving God, death, and .... well, the damaged psyche.

I would never recommend this to anyone - but, if you're looking for trouble, you will find it here.

  Found the movie twisted and underwhelming, the film is also trying ( very ) hard to manipulate and push their fantastical and religious beliefs ( and I'm not even that religious ) onto the viewer like a lame politician.
  Plus it's not even scary.
  I believe this is more of a propaganda film with an incoherent agenda.

  I bought this because of the high ratings and comments given by your wonderful buyers here at Amazon - oh my goodness that was so totally wrong.

  I'll take this afterwards and sell it at a second hand store near here to recoup my loss.",1344211200,5,769,4.446043165467626

I get there is a sub-genre for truly depraved cinema, some could even be described at ""art"" (Fellini) others are just disgusting or taboo but still pretend to be doing it in the name of some greater message.
This is NOT art. This is hell on blu ray, it is vile and horrible only to be vile and horrible. It's not art, it's as if some very disturbed people tried to think of the worst scenes possible and then animated them worse than Any sat morning tv show. the person who created this or helped make it must honestly be demons, because the guy who made ""slaughtered vomit dolls"" made a deal with devil to make his films, and they didn't make me feel half as sick as this shit.

4990310,3,B006HGXGWK,I love animation and I love dark themes but with this movie you really had to try not to take it seriously or you could very easily be appalled.

4990311,1,B006HGXGWK,"This movie if you call it that, was trash in every sense of the word. Lets start with the fake d! ck cheese reviews giving it 5 stars. First off some chit stain typed the animation was ""primitive"", that would be too nice. Its misleading since when I read ANIMATION I think old school 2D Disney. Nope, this is horrible computer generated graphics. I mean its not even good,bad, its just bad. An arm will bleed into the head or other graphics just don't work. Here is a tip for voice casting too since this was made in some guys basement on a Commodore 64, when you cast an actor for a little boy, USE A WOMANS VOICE! That took me out of the movie right off. Oh and making a loud scary voice saying the same thing 20 times in a row is not scary its annoying.
 This was a waste of 15 bucks and just a horrible mess. We get it...you're into Satan. I was hoping for something good and this is coming from a guy who dug A SERBIAN FILM and Human Centipede 2.  Please, FOR THE LOVE OF GOD, avoid this POS of a movie.",1338508800,7,1008,4.060301507537688

It took me about 6 months after initially reading about this entry into the genre to fully muster the ambition and set some time aside to watch this piece... solely due to the face of its own obscurity.  I really haven't heard anything about this piece anywhere else besides here on Amazon.  Normally, when I read 5-10 reviews of a product and all give it 5 stars, it immediately sends up a red flag that the product has been reviewed only by its own bennefactors.  However, luckily, after viewing WTDGTD, I can say that this is no scam.  This is sheer depravity.  For those of whom are always seeking the most jarring experience available... I would suggest purchasing this piece.  However, I would like to also add (no matter how cliche it sounds.) that this is not for the squeamish.  In fact %95 of those whom consider themselves to be seasoned, highly tolerant horror fans will find this much to ambiguous of a storyline and much too disturbing to suffer through none the less.

4990314,5,B006HGXGWK,"I'm going to start off this review by saying I don't really care for animation.

Yes, I said it.  With the exception of a few of the films I grew up with, animated films do not interest me.

So with that said, a film like Where the Dead Go To Die would typically go totally unnoticed by me, which is a real pity because it's depressingly wonderful.  It's surreal, violent, and at times outrageous.  When it first started the look of the animation got to me.  It's very primitive(think ReBoot.)  However as the film progressed I realized the look of the animation fit the tone perfectly...Some of the images presented in this movie are completely deranged, the fact that it's looks like a kids movie is completely jarring.

I'm not going to go into too much detail about the film as I think it's best to go in knowing as little as possible, but I will tell you this...There is a talking dog who is interdimensional. A group of troubled kids.  Enough bestiality, murder, and all around violent material to offend the most seasoned gorehound.  Did I mention the talking dog?  He likes to convince children their unborn brother is the Anti-Christ.  I couldn't make this stuff up, I'm not that imaginative, so my only advice is to run out and pick this one up!

Onto the disc itself.  Unearthed did a great job with this title.  The film looks and sounds great (there's also a blu-ray available)  It is presented in anamorphic widescreen with 5.1 sound, some of the extras include..

-Commentary with the director
-Deleted scenes
-featurettes
-A Short
-Trailers

Unearthed Tends to put a lot of work into their releases and this one is no different!

I mentioned earlier, going into this movie I was not a fan of animation...Now I realize there are some stories that are completely suited for this medium.  There's no way they could have pulled this off using actors.  Congratulations Jimmy Screamerclauz, you've successfully changed this stubborn man's opinion.",1332460800,18,1957,4.747774480712166

8498452,5,B006HGXGWK,"I'm going to start this review by being very blunt: if you are not a fan of experimentation in art forms, and prefer a story that is more direct, straightforward, and ""entertaining"" (as vague as that term is)... you probably should not buy this film.

Ok, now that we have that out of the way... for the people who DO appreciate the Avantgarde and the experimental: you're in for a treat with this one. James Creamer, AKA ""Jimmy ScreamerClauz"" is a master craftsman of the grotesque, the surreal, and the utterly terrifying. Where The Dead Go To Die is actually composed of three short films: Tainted Milk, Liquid Memories, and The Masks That The Monsters Wear. They are loosely tied together by the character Labby, a demonic talking dog who takes various characters on trips through hellish alternative dimensions where they come face to face with their inner fears, repressed memories, etc.... or something like that.

There are many feelings throughout this movie of ""extravagance for the sake of extravagance,"" and Creamer himself has admitted in an interview that he was working on most of it high as all hell for a large percentage of the time. Yet for those who like to dig deep and make film analyses... you will see underlying themes here. There are motifs of religious theology, child abuse, reincarnation, and memories, and somehow they all combine into a picture that, while not overly clear, is certainly intriguing. The film is very violent and gory, but in a way, the animation (which many people seem to criticize?) reinforces this power. The cartoonish, video-game look of it is not a medium that we would typically expect to see such excessive, horrifying things portrayed in... and that only serves to make the visuals and events of the film even more disturbing.

To say that Where The Dead Go To Die is not for everyone would probably be the understatement of the century. It is visceral, it is haunting, and it is extremely psychologically unsettling. But if you like that, and are down for an artist taking you through a psychedelic ride to Hell and back, and really trying to show you something that you haven't seen before, give this movie a try, because I really don't think you'll be disappointed. Recommended especially for fans of Eraserhead, Antichrist, Santa Sangre, and similar experimental horror flicks.",1448841600,,2338,4.898989898989899

 I don't know, in retrospect, if I enjoyed it as a whole. I did however enjoy the ride of watching it- what a crazy, twisted, macabre ride it was! I would be laughing one minute, then intrigued or disgusted the next. In many ways I felt like I was watching a student art project. I loved the mixed media, but while some of the visuals left me in awe, seconds later it would switch to rough computer animation that completely changed the experience.
Although there were a few moments that i perceived to be no more then pandering to be as shocking and vile as possible, I greatly appreciated that I felt like ANYTHING was possible. In the terrifying, dystopian world presented, I didn't know what to expect next. Even when the characters were trying to be ""good"" the results were extreme, bizarre, and sickening.
