8507071,1,B006ZL1POI,How do good actors end up in lousy movies! I watched three of the six movies and just CAN NOT get myself to waste any more time watching the other three!,1392768000,,153,3.967741935483871
8507072,5,B006ZL1POI,At about 6 bucks this was a very good purchase and all the movies are pretty decent. IMDB rates two in the 5's and the other four in the 6's... none were bad... in my opinion... and several were really good like ORDINARY DECENT CRIMINAL & EXISTENZ. I was going to watch them all then sell it with some other collections but I'll be keeping this one for at least another viewing some time in the future. I'm not sure what another reviewer was complaining about but these are Blu-ray and there are 2-discs with 3 movies each... which is what I expected.,1388275200,,551,4.359223300970874
8507073,3,B006ZL1POI,Everything ok but it will be better if come 6 bluray. In this came only 2 with 3 films each bluray,1361836800,3,98,3.7142857142857144
