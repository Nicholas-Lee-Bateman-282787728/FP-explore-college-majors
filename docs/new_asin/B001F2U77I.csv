8300688,3,B001F2U77I,"I wanted to get a library started for my Blu-Ray player and thought this would be a good way to kickstart the library.  I did not realize the made for tv movies had choppy parts where the commercials should go - and in movies that spread out over 2 nights (like 10.5) the movie ending showed, and a bit later the second night part of the movie was shown.  It is okay - but if I had paid full price for the cube, I would have been sorely disappointed.",1252713600,10,450,4.044943820224719
8300689,3,B001F2U77I,"A 10 pack of B-flicks.  For forty-bucks, you can't really complain too much.  You get 10 BluRay films... for forty-bucks.

First, none are worth paying more than five-bucks for.  But since they're four-bucks each... not too bad.  These are straight to BluRay movies.  Skipped the theaters all together.

Only buy if you're a collector of movies.  The average viewer shouldn't buy these.",1250121600,9,386,5.112903225806452
8300690,4,B001F2U77I,"This set is actually quite good if you know what to expect. These are not movies that flopped in the theater, and they are technically not made for video, unless you count made for cable as made for video. Here is the low-down on what seven out of the ten films in this set are: they are Hallmark movies, made for the Hallmark channel. Generally, Hallmark does a good job with movies, especially with movies based on classic stories. If you're expecting 50 movie pack type drive-in schlockfest films, that's not really what this is. The ""theatrical"" films are not huge hits, but they are not terrible if you know what to expect. Grant it none of the three theatrical films is an Oscar contender, but they do have appeal. Howard Stern fans will probably like Beer League, as it was made by one of Stern's ""gang"" Artie Lange, and Mortuary was made by Tobe Hooper whose original Texas Chainsaw Massacre was far better than the schlocky remake (which SHOULD be shovelware)so it does have a connection to a Horror legend, and the Robin Williams film is not his best, but it has its silly charm. The reason I gave this four stars is this: If they took out the theatrical films and replaced them with Gulliver's Travels, Moby Dick, and The Odyssey, this would be a five star set, considering the price. All three of those films were fairly close to their source material, (although not exact, but what movie is?)and I would love to find ANY of these movies back in print in ANY form. The DVDs are long out of print and quite costly. Of course if they had included the awful Monkey King or Noah this would have been a three star set.
So these are Hallmark movies; nothing more, nothing less. If you enjoy the Hallmark Channel and Hallmark's made-for-TV fare, you would probably enjoy this. I find it to be good for the price, but I still wish Moby Dick, The Odyssey, and Gulliver's Travels were all here as well. Of course the picture quality is not up there with most of the theatrical blockbusters you will find today, but remember, these movies were made for cable, not the big screen.",1249689600,5,2080,4.519893899204244
8300691,1,B001F2U77I,"When the primary attraction to a product is that you are getting a $150 ""value"" for $42.50, you likely aren't. Ask yourself how they can afford to stay in business, if this truly is a $150 ""value"". In my opinion, this 10 disc set isn't even worth $10.

The included titles, hardly are ones to take advantage of the benefits of Blu-ray in the first place, let alone ones that are considered highly desirable. At $3.53 per disc, you would be better off looking for inexpensive DVDs, and making sure that your Blu-ray player will also play DVDs. Then, buy the titles you actually want, as opposed to the titles that are being ""dumped"" at a ""fire sale"".

The whole purpose of Blu-ray is to offer the capability of having more special features, and higher quality for today's 1080p TVs and projectors. This set defeats that core purpose pretty handily. Never mind the fact that all of these titles are movies that didn't sell well to begin with.

The included titles are:

 1. The Big White
 2. Category 7: The End of the World
 3. Mortuary
 4. Mysterious Island
 5. Beer League
 6. Blackbeard
 7. The Poseidon Adventure
 8. Final Days of Planet Earth
 9. 10.5: Apocalypse
10. The Curse of King Tut's Tomb",1229212800,102,1200,4.5514018691588785
