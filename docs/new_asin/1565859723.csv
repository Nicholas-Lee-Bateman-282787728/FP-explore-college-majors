186629,5,1565859723,"I am a reapeated viewer of these DVD's and their supportive materials and cannot get enough of the package.  I find the teacher very captivating, informative and entertaining.  I would be looking him up at the library over and over again.  Linwood Thompson, keep on producing more materials.  You got yourself a loyal follower!",1338768000,,327,5.0
186630,5,1565859723,"Everyone loves this course. It is by far The Teaching Company's best course!! Linwood Thompson uses funny and interesting factoids to teach World History. His unusual style captures the students imagination. By the second lesson, the kids are asking, ""Where's the funny guy? Can we do another lesson?""",1336176000,2,301,5.291666666666667
186631,5,1565859723,"We used these videos when we studied ancient, world, and American histories, primarily to liven things up in our homeschool.  They would not replace a good history text, but it's amazing how much material is packed into each creative lesson.  The teacher, Linwood Thompson, is entertaining, dressing up in period costumes and speaking with different accents; we greatly enjoyed his performances. These 3 videos have a total of 30 half-hour lessons beginning with ""Civilizations of the Fertile Crescent"" and ending with ""The American Revolution.""  I like how there were lessons on Africa, China, & Japan which are usually shortchanged in traditional history books.  I think he treated the (possibly) controversial areas fairly and without bias.  Would definitely recommend the series.

Just a comment to the producers/directors of these series:  Please have the teacher look at the camera occasionally so the TV-viewing student feels included in the ""class"".  When the teacher looks all around, from side to side, and never pauses to look at the camera, the viewer feels ignored and that's (hopefully) not how it would be in a real classroom.  But we loved the videos anyway!",1326931200,5,1174,5.235294117647059

7796587,5,1565859723,My instructor takes a bit of adjustment as I am a mature learner However once I adjusted to the change of presentation I found Im learning in a different manner He is knowledgeable and entertaining at the same time,1511222400,,214,4.512820512820513
7796588,4,1565859723,Educational and well done but the dude needs to stop dressing in character. You can tell he's so distracted by his accents and theatrics that he starts slipping in the actual teaching. If you're not 14 you may get annoyed by his approach.,1491868800,3,238,4.558139534883721

7796593,5,1565859723,"Item ordered was as promised. Not the company's fault but in my ordering frenzy I missed the warning which stated that not all parts would be included, so the first thing I ordered only had the DVDs which was fine but the second item I ordered only had the book which is not what I wanted. As I said, the company was totally honest about this but this is just to remind other buyers to be careful when ordering; you can't be sure of what you get.",1419292800,,446,4.137931034482759
7796594,5,1565859723,"My son is a visual and auditory learner.  We read about Linwood Thompson on one of the homeschool forum sites and I picked it up at Amazon to try as a supplement to his Streams of Civlization class.  This was the hit of the year.  Linwood Thompson is outstanding!  So much so, we purchased his other set (I reviewed it as well--- found on Amazon: Early American History: Native Americans through the Forty-Niners (Great Courses: Modern History 2003)  We used The Fertile Crescent first then I quickly realized they would not last the year-- even as I purchased as a supplement.  My son could not wait to watch the next dvd.  It is quite fun seeing what character he will portray and dress up as.  We would get a good chuckle out of half the accents he used.  He is truly an amazing teacher and any child lucky enough to have him teach in person is lucky indeed.  I found what he said to be balanced and I agreed with what he taught. Loved it.  Wish he made dozens of these -- I'd snap up every one. I'm so glad I heard about these. This was a lucky find for sure.  You can't make a history course out of it (there's not enough there).  But, as a supplement--- they are awesome!",1404518400,4,1177,4.271493212669683
7796595,5,1565859723,Very creative.  Makes learning fun with each character for different periods of time. I would recommend for any age to learn more history and see a true actor.,1391731200,,159,4.678571428571429
