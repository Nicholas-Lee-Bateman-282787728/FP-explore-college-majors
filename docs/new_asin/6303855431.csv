They're slow they use dumb moves, the actors  overact the pain and all the fights in the seacond half of the movie are so  poorly choreographed that I want to fast forward and get back to the plot.  I think they switched choreogrophers somwhere in the middle.  It is a  good movie with some good fights and some bad ones. bits of it are  creative. other times it's unbearably boring",962928000,,556,4.401960784313726

7853461,4,6303855431,"""Expect No Mercy"" is a genuinely entertaining piece of Canadian cheesiness that is long on action and short on acting. The extremely barebones DVD (there are no real extras, clicking on ""Trailers"" just goes to a list of other titles available) contains a hilarious camp classic that explored virtual reality when nobody quite knew what that meant. I give the filmmakers a thumbs up for concept, but the execution is laughable at times. Opening with a mega-mullet in outer space along with some terrible computer effects, we quickly learn two important things about future fighting styles: first, it's a good idea to bring a bullwhip to a gunfight; and second, professional assassins bring iguanas to their hits.

The plot concerns the ""Virtual Arts Academy"" which uses comical virtual reality violence to teach assassins their trade. You will love this place and the paunchy fisticuffs contained therein. If you think the academy looks like a community college with a tad of set dressing, you will be unsurprised that the credits reveal that it's the University of Toronto, Scarborough Campus. The ridiculously mulleted leader is Warbeck (Wolf Larson) and he espouses much that is insane capped with dialogue like ""it is better to create and injury than to suffer one"". Deep. Billy Blanks is secret agent Justin, who along with his friend secret agent Eric (Jalal Merhi) is sent to infiltrate the academy. Right away I loved the academy's lunchroom where a pointless brawl quickly asserts Justin's dominance. Of course there's a hot blonde girl working for Warbeck and everyone comes to understand that the academy is just a cover for assassination for hire. Well, duh! The entire premise is an excuse for Blanks to destroy adversaries with his considerable martial arts moves. After a dose of tranquilizing darts, the protagonists have virtual reality helmets strapped on and are put in ""combat mode"" where the terrible digital effects ""work 'em till they drop"". Of course once the blonde learns the truth about Warbeck, she sees the light and joins the good guys (I bet you couldn't see that one coming), takes off their VR helmets, and tries to bust them out of the sociology buildingI mean the academy. There is no explanation of how they get out, but they take a truck and escape. During the escape the three good guys show up during a hit on a guy named Goldberg (Who is he? Who knows? Who Cares?) and they vow to save him, even from the menacing assassin who has once again brought his iguana along for the kill (and even kissed him this time!)

Eric and Justin get Goldberg, but the bad guys manage to capture hot blonde Vicki (Laurie Holden) in the process. She's feisty, but the guys know she needs rescuing. This gets into the part of the movie dedicated to nonstop and sometimes nonsensical action; plot doesn't matter, just sit back and enjoy the mayhem. Warbeck has a screaming fit in which he explains his world view, and we learn the academy is rigged for destruction with emplaced bombs (why?) and poor Eric gets mauled but improbably rallies for the big showdown. After some comical dialogue (""It's all over for you, chump! It's time for some steam cleaning!"") Justin and Warbeck get to the one on one duel you know is coming, but it's immediately clear that Warbeck isn't in Justin's martial arts league (Blanks really is good) and despite a finale that involves a bullwhip and about 300 roundhouse kicks, good wins over evil. We get to see the old bullwhip dangling blonde rescue ploy (I really must congratulate you, movie, this was an unexpected treat), the building blows up and the ending proves the most ridiculous spectacle of all.

Side notes: the bad guys had guns, why didn't they just shoot the intruders? I also note that in the credits the ""Woman in Porsche"" was played by Basma Merhi, who quips ""this is my husband's car!"" as her actual husband steals it from her. You know it's a great film if I watched the credits this closely.

""Expect No Mercy"" wins no prizes for plot, scrip, or acting, but for pure B-movie fun with loads of action, it's one of Canada's greatest accomplishments and I recommend it to fans of cult movies everywhere.",1473552000,,4172,4.806406685236769

7853466,3,6303855431,"It's with mixed feelings that I write my review of the last of three cinematic team-ups for martial artists Billy Blanks and Jalal Merhi. In the three years they teamed together, if nothing else, they provided the DTV action scene with sustenance and created an image of themselves as two of the more consistent action heroes of the low budget section. With that said, I wasn't a fan of their last two movies and won't rave about this one either, but in retrospect, it's the best of their three collaborations for focusing on what sorta-kinda worked in their last two and remaining interesting even during the more questionable parts. In short, it's probably the best film that Blanks and Merhi could ever make together, but that's not saying much.

The story: assigned to infiltrate the mysterious Virtual Arts Academy of the eccentric Mr. Warbeck (Wolf Larson,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/L-A-Heat/dp/B000BFH2RI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">L.A.

Computer graphics nowadays are so advanced that watching the low-budget offerings of 1995 is shocking. The blocky CGI backgrounds present in the virtual reality fight scenes are cool in a retro sort of way, but the gimmick gets really old after a while for a couple of reasons. Not only are the fight scenes in the VR world the worst of the bunch (thanks to a deficiency of camera angles, a complete lack of atmosphere, and a weird sparkly effect on the fighters that blurs everything they do), but the whole VR concept has minimal impact on the rest of the movie: Warbeck makes a few grandiose statements about the computer being the future of the world and stuff of the like, but nobody ever fights to the death in the virtual world and it's questionable if any of the characters seem like better fighters after training in it. It's a novel idea for the time (if we choose not to remember&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Lawnmower-Man/dp/6304604572/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Lawnmower Man</a>), but it really seems like the only reason it's there is because writer J. Stephen Maunder wanted a gimmick to spice up an otherwise clichd storyline.

Apart from the primitive 3D animation, the production looks pretty good - minimalistic and kinda underpopulated (shades of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/TC-2000/dp/6302814316/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">TC 2000</a>?), but solid. I can't say the same for the action content, though. Jalal Merhi will always be known as one of the most lackluster onscreen martial performers, but Billy's stuff is usually pretty good...except in the movies he did with Mr. Merhi. The choreography could be better all-around, but it's the cutting and editing that really breaks a lot of the fight scenes: the filmmakers seemed to believe that showing a tight close-up is more exciting than pulling the camera back to show off the form of a kick, punch, or throw, even if it's something remarkably cool like someone delivering a flying kick down a flight of stairs. Luckily, Billy's athleticism shines through: despite needing to brave his way through an embarrassing stickfight, not even the damn post-production editing can completely ruin the coolness of some of his moves, especially during a four-on-one randori. His battle with his real-life brother Michael (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dragon-Fire/dp/B00006II6F/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dragon Fire</a>) steals the show for its back-and-forth fluidity and the eventual death by steam. Jalal Merhi doesn't have any fights worth mentioning, which is in accordance with his character: he's the costar by definition only, with next to no personality and very little plot significance. Personally, I think this is for the best. The fact that Wolf Larson clearly pantomimes his way through the final showdown is disappointing, though.

""Expect No Mercy"" is only a two-star rating, but my three stars represent a general improvement over the faults of the earlier films. Seeing lots of Billy and generally little of Jalal goes a long way, but it's the bunch of little enhancements like marginally-better fight scenes and even the mildly amusing tidbits like the weirdo VR animation that put this one a step above the others. Watch some clips online before considering a purchase.",1278288000,,5251,6.218707015130674
7853467,3,6303855431,"Forget Tae Boe. Billy should have kept doing karate movies. This movie was filled with action. The fight scene at the end between Billy and his real life brother was great as was the grand finale between Blanks and Wold Larson's character. Neither Blanks  nor this movie would have ever been nominated for an Oscar, but for sheer entertainment and great karate action, Blanks, Charles Daniels and Michael Worth are second to none. Most of  the time they will have a good story wrapped around these great  fight scenes. So what separates Blanks from the other thousand karate movies out there? Personality. He can also act. This was a good movie. About what I expected since what I expected was not a dull moment. Wold Larson  is also very good as the villain. He is a great in roles where he has such fight scenes as I have seen him in a karate movie before. This movie was only missing in the romance department. Other than that it shot no blanks. Great for us American star karate movie fans.",1236384000,,994,4.5363128491620115
7853468,3,6303855431,"Here we have another production with the ever famous duo of martial arts actors Billy Blanks and Jalal Mehri - great martial artists who are laughable actors that when paired together create a so bad its good movie.  On top of it, this movie deals with martial arts combat in a virtual reality system - oh dear.  Someone was smart to let Anthony De Longis and Michael Blanks (Billy's brother) be in this film because they save it - and so does the non-stop action.

I figured that any virtual reality action coming from a 1996 B-martial arts flick would be a joke, and yes it is bad.  Thankfully the entire movie doesn't really revolve around that.  There is a virtual reality martial arts academy, where students train through this program, but the academy is actually used as a front.  The academy's leader ""Warbeck"" (Wolf Larson) thinks he is God, and runs a secret assination program with some of his fines men - Damian (Anthony De Longis) and Spyder (Michael Blanks).  I never knew De Longis could fight, but he does ok in this film, and steals the show at times, being just dirty in the film.  Michael Blanks is always a treat for me.  Though he rarely has a line, he always plays a villain (Dragon Fire, Circuit, Bloodfist 6)  He has longer legs than his brother, and the results are impressive leaps and kicks that look great.

There is so much action in this film its crazy.  Unfortunately, some of it takes place in the virtual world and looks like pure crap.  Most of it does take place in the real world.  The movie even begins with some great action, and again, the charcaters Damian and Spyder get to show off as the bads guys.  Later in the film, both Billy and Michael fight each other in what is probably the best fight of the film.  It's a 4 minute fight that looks pretty good, and Michael Blanks kicks his brother's butt pretty good for awhile.  Jala Mehri gets to fight Anthony De Longis on a rooftop in the end, which is an ok fight.  The final fight is Billy Blanks against Wolf Larson.  In addition to being a pretty bad actor, I didn't think Larson was all that good of a fighter and even though its a lengthy fight of several minutes, the final fight could have been better.

Yeah, this is a pretty bad movie that's very cheesy and all the usual American B-movie stuff.  But it somehow still manages to be very entertaining, with tons of martial arts action and some great villains.  Its a pretty easy watch when you just don't want to think.",1191024000,2,2468,4.437777777777778
