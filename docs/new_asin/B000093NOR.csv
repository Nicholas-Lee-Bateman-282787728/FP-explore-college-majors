They have puzzle games after each episode too. Great if your child likes to learn. Still has good morals though.",1365033600,,257,4.26530612244898

7988974,4,B000093NOR,"The videos arrived promptly and were in great condition. However, the episode about the storybook adventure where the nice lady turns mean is not appropriate for young children. This also goes for the episode about the dust monster on volume 2. It scares my 2 year-old.

But these episodes are easily skipped.",1355356800,,309,4.9423076923076925
