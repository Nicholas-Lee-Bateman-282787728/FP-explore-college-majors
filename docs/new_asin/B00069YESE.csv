8040863,5,B00069YESE,"After several years of looking for it in Peruvian movie stores I had finally to buy it in Amazon. It's is called the end of the trilogy of Francisco Lombardi (after 1. La boca del lobo and then 2. La ciudad y los perros) however I think it's his best movie (Tinta Roja is also a good film). The most important of that movie is the fact that mixes fiction with reality (all scenes that focuses on the TV news are real). I think for some Fujimori's fans would be offensive, however the movie shows a truly plot that would have happen according to all the things that were exposed on 2001 since it was shown the first ""Vladi-Video"".

In fact, I love this movie since I was finally able to see it in an original DVD (curiously the copy I got was from Venevision International). There is a lot of Peruvian slang and interjections. But you'll get the point after watching it from beginning to end. It is also curious to have a character related to one TV news narrator/newscaster who gets a terminal disease just after the fall of Fujimori regimen (Ruben Garcia). I remember there was more than one channel and also journalist that offered blind support to Fujimori and all that he did.

I would recommend it to anyone who wants to remember (to know) what happened these days of Fujimori falling. When you ask about this movie nobody remembers it. I watched only once on TV but there was no copy available to buy. I think it is not the best Peruvian movie however you'll be able to see real scenes of our history mixed with an interesting and suffered plot of all the fictitious characters involved.

In the movie you'll see two old men in a hospital: a Fujimori's fan and the other against him since he sympathise with APRA and Alan Garcia. Both of them are very well realised. Because it was very difficult to many Peruvians to know that the main assessor of his political Idol (Vladimiro Montesinos) was involved in several corruption acts. These both old men represents the way that people elevates their political affiliations just maybe at the same level of religion. Curiously the movie doesn't show Alejandro Toledo news at any time what would be taken as if Lombardi would sympathise with him.

But it was also a prophetic movie because after Alejandro Toledo, Alan Garcia was president again and that is also incomprehensible for many Peruvians. After Fujimori, Peruvian politics turned into a really strange way. Maybe now Peruvians don't vote for the one he wants, but against the one they hates.

I write this comment just a week before the 192th Peruvian Independence Day. I hope the best for us since, at this time, uncertainty is the only we have if we talk about politics and politicians.",1374364800,,2699,4.602910602910603
8040864,1,B00069YESE,This movie was nothing more than propaganda for Alejandro Toledo (the president of Peru in 2003). I really hate it when films are used for political misinformation.,1236816000,,164,5.111111111111111
8040865,5,B00069YESE,"This is one of the best films I've seen. I knew just a little about the political situation (and it's history) in Peru - as another reviewer has written, the movie is not centered on that, it's about people's lives (and deaths). This is a movie that stays with you a long time - some uplifting moments, some tragic, justice and injustices. I got this to practice listening to Spanish but it's a very fine film in any language - really a work of art.",1207526400,5,449,4.294117647058823
