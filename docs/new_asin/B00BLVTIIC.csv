8570628,3,B00BLVTIIC,"Wow. I am a huge fan of the movie Rainbow Bridge, which alone puts me in a select group; THIS disc is only for people who wonder what has become of the far out dudes from Rainbow Bridge. There is only about 20 minutes of actual interviews; the rest is some public access TV type filler. What is in the interviews is somewhat interesting. I'm glad I watched it, but I think few would agree with me.",1494547200,,397,4.1688311688311686
