7859358,5,6303944809,"This episode is one of the best ever written in start trek.  It explores not only the depth of Picards character but also the nature of family.  When Picard first returns his bother is jealous and annoyed, and taunts him over what he sees as weakness, and Picard's initial defensive reaction only encourages this.  When his brother eventually realizes how much pain he is in, probably when he finds Picard getting drunk, the dynamic changes very quickly although this change may not be obvious to the person watching.  I like this episode because shows how families can pull together when necessary in 3 different story lines.",1137801600,,626,4.877358490566038
7859359,5,6303944809,"I was drawn to this episode because it is so different from most TNG plots: no alien encounters, no epic battles or encounters with strange phenomena. In fact, there is no space travel at all! It is one of the few episodes I've seen that actually takes place on Earth, and you really get to explore a different, not-often-seen side of Picard and Worf.
The stories take place right after the Borg attack and the subsequent rescue and ""deprogramming"" of Picard. In search of perspective on the incident he travels to his home town in France and stays in his parents' house, now occupied by his brother, Robert, and his family (who, like Patrick Stewart, all have English accents!! Does anyone else find humor in this?). Robert feels Picard has lost touch with his roots, his heritage, that he has sacrificed his values to go gallivanting around the universe. Picard feels that Robert, who runs the family vineyard, is antiquated, foolishly resisting to acknowledge technological progress (Robert doesn't even have a food replicator in his house - how primitive!). Robert is not thrilled that his son wants to join Starfleet when he grows up; Picard thinks it's a great idea (or at least doesn't object). A war of wills develops, soul-searching ensues, and Picard eventually comes to terms with his ordeal with the Borg.
Worf also does some soul-searching when his human foster parents visit him on Enterprise. At first he dreads their visit, ashamed of having them discover his recent Klingon dishonor and embarrassed by their behavior around him. He feels distant from his parents, and vice versa, but some help from Guinan and a heart-to-heart talk with the folks help mend the relationship.
There is another minor, though heartfelt, storyline in which Wesley Crusher views a holographic message left by his late father shortly after Wesley's birth.
Overall, this is a great introspective, character-driven episode that really showcases the acting talents of Patrick Stewart and Michael Dorn. And as with all of the great TNG episodes, it is an allegory for our time, telling us that sometimes going boldly where no man has gone before simply means going home.",1020124800,5,2160,4.986149584487535
7859360,5,6303944809,"This episode places Picard back in his hometown in France where he must come to terms with his emotions. He was mutilated by the Borg, forced to do battle and contribute to the deaths of thousands of Star Fleet members. At  the same time he must come to understand his brothers feelings of jealousy  toward him. The acting is superb and the ending is incredibly satisfying.",961632000,7,373,4.636363636363637
