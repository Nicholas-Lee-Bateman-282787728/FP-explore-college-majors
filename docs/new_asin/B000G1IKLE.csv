2597421,5,B000G1IKLE,I have loved this movie since the first time I watched it a few years ago.  I can watch it over and over again.,1359331200,,111,3.625
2597422,5,B000G1IKLE,"The only movie from Bollywood I had ever seen was a by chance pickup in Blockbusters of Monsoon Wedding. I was looking up something on Google and ran across a Netflix ad free for 30 days yada yada . Ran across Hindi films to review started looking for Monsoon wedding to view it again and saw this great looking guy on the cover of this movie . Akshay Kumar. The rest is history. Three or so months later and a bunch of bollywood buys off of Amazon and I have still held this one in my head as a real romance novel come to life , well real as in humans acting it out.

The intro to Aki's character depicts him  as a simple engineer and customer svc rep manager for Toyota . He is on his way, late of course, to his engagement ceremony which is engaging; pardon the pun. After the party the pain begins. He is dragged down the walk way towards her house and you start to get a true taste of Bipasha's idea of their future in their non-romantic marriage. Later the plane ride to hell. No children for quite a while bomb dropped on him, no real discussing it, no touchy feely emotions etc. You begin to feel sorry for this character who is so lovable ,romantic at heart, cuddly wants children and is family driven . It's hard to watch her cut him into pieces. He's attracted to her and she acts coldly logical all the time. She would be a perfect corportate wife. Aware of appearances and organized with an eye to the future of her ""House"" (dynasty).Big time fashion model/ desinger . He's lovable, she's not. At least I don't have to feel guilty for not liking Bips in this one..I swear that woman is so wooden if you threw a match within fifty feet of her she'd burst into flames. More of the same in this one. Feel free to hate her till the very last scene. Enter tall willowy beauty katrina kaif with sweet disposition , soft hearted ,trusting, lonely mostly friendless in this country Canada and similar interest, but engaged to a powerful work-aholic. Keep running her gorgeous lonely character into your very handsome nice guy over and over and you begin to get the impression that fate is toying with them. Fate is not very kind at first. Here's your soul mate. Try not to fall in love with her.

 Memorable poignant moments, A slightly villainous fiance for Katrina and a loving supporting family that is slowly beginning to wonder what's going on for Akshay to have to deal with . He's engaged after all . Every time they turn around here's this sweet girl they all really like but she is not his fiance who they are also fond of .  The musical numbers are really modern tempo great club style choreographed numbers. Awesome one of Aki on his motorcycle with katrina draped over backwards while they are riding . Wonder if they really did that scene without a stunt double for her. Couple of songs done in the Hindi romantic style in pretty locals with water and mountains. Great scenery pics.

 The very able Anil Kapoor is perfect as the power driven fiance for Kaif who wants everything his own and no sharing. This makes him somewhat sympathetic as well but scary possibly mafia connected too . He's the more ruthless version of Bipasha's character. He's good at ruthless. Come to think of it his character  and Bips would be perfect for one another.",1336953600,,3261,4.432387312186978
2597423,5,B000G1IKLE,"i think its a beauifully written script and i just absoutely love the movie, i recommeded every to wtch it",1278633600,2,106,4.35
2597424,4,B000G1IKLE,"We have 2 pairs of engaged couples: Alshay Kumar with Bipasha Basu, and Katrina Kaif with Anil Kapoor. They are from Mumbai but spend time in Canada (most of the movie). A member of each couple is very tied up with career and fate brings the other 2 (Akshay and Katrina) together. These two are much better matched but also are people of integrity. So will they end up together...?
Hardly a new plot but that doesn't generally matter for those into romantic movies. What this does have is good connected chemistry between the stars (who later reprise this connection in Namaste London - also recommended). There is a slow build of what becomes a convincing connection. The shots linger meaningfully and we care about their progress. There is an unlikely change if heart in one character that was unconvincing given what we'd been told of their history - but this is Bollywood and is a good intention if unlikely.
There is also some beautiful cinematography around Canada. The songs are fine when on but I didn't take any away with me.
Akshay is really good in this and consistently so. Katrina is also even though she doesn't always bring off this level (especially when playing opposite real life boyfriend Salmon Khan in Yuuvraaj - though this latter movie is worth seeing for other reasons). I have now decided that I really like Akshay in these sort of roles but don't relate to his comedies (perhaps with the exception of Singh is Kingg).
Anil and Bipasha don't have as much of a role. Bipasha does one-dimensional model and Anil has little opportunity to do more than ego-centric businessman. However as the symbols they are meant to be they do OK.
I passed this over several times till a Sri Lankan friend recommended it as one of her favorites. Worth seeing for romantics.",1233014400,4,1780,4.708333333333333
2597425,4,B000G1IKLE,"Pretty Good - but I ended up liking the ""villain"" the most at the end.  It was pretty enjoyable though - I started to get a little annoyed with the characters at the end though - the hero and heroine were too wishy-washy for me - they were a little pathetic and overly, morosely dramatic.  But I loved the ending scene - the bad guy was, too me, in the end the best guy.  I love it when a bad guy becomes a good guy - although it's a little bit not so great when he's better and more noble than the hero...  I also thought he was better looking, though shorter, than the hero.",1221091200,,576,3.982608695652174
2597426,4,B000G1IKLE,"Here's the set-up for HUMKO DEEWANA KAR GAYE (Love Connects): Aditya (Akshay Kumar) is a car engineer and test driver for an auto company in India. He's engaged to Sonia (Bipasha Basu), a somewhat cold, very career oriented fashion designer. Aditya, or Adi, is a sentimental fella, Sonia is eminently unromantic. After several revealing conversations, it quietly dawns on Adi that he and Sonia don't seem to want the same things in life, and he begins to have bad vibes about their impending nuptials.

After their engagement party, Adi and Sonia part ways temporarily for business reasons. She, to work in Paris; Adi, newly promoted, is reassigned to Canada. There, he meets Jia (Katrina Kaif) and is instantly smitten. The next few days or weeks, they continue to accidentally bump into each other. Eventually, they begin hanging out, and there's an obvious spark there. But Jia is herself engaged, to a wealthy, workaholic businessman who barely pays attention to her. So, Adi and Jia end up spending even more time together and, yup, they Fall in Love. But, still, both being already engaged, they try to ""do the right thing."" And, then, because, it would've been all too simple and practical for them to openly declare their love and break off their engagements, the script comes up with a plot contrivance to tear them apart. Still, the ending's pretty obvious and inevitable, but the getting there is predictably rife with tears, stoic suffering, crazy melodrama, and an outrageous coincidence. But, hey, it's all par for the course in Bollywood.

If you're familiar with Bollywood offerings, then there won't be anything new here for you. The story delves into Bollywood's favorite theme, that of all-consuming love versus sacrifice and obligation. HUMKO DEEWANA KAR GAYE, released in 2006, is an average soaper made better by the chemistry between Akshay Kumar and Katrina Kaif. You easily buy into their friendship which turns into mutual attraction which then becomes love. Half British and a model-turned-actress, Katrina Kaif is a natural beauty, graceful and unaffected. Still fairly new to the acting biz, she isn't really challenged here, acting-wise, but she holds her own with the veteran Kumar. Her Hindi lines, however, are dubbed. Apparently, people at the top had doubts about her proficiency with the language. Akshay, as Aditya, immediately gets you on his side with his easy going charisma. And he's got that wistful, heartbroken look down to a T. They make a good pair, and they're even better in their later re-teaming in 2007's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Namastey-London-DVD/dp/B000R939DY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Namastey London DVD</a>. Anil Kapoor, who doesn't show up until halfway thru the film, brings his patented intensity as Jia's controlling fiance. Bipasha Basu does okay with her supporting role of Aditya's all-work-and-no-play fiancee.

The negatives? Well, with the Bollywood assembly line putting out a gazillion movies a year, originality is hard to come by. No surprise, then, that this film piggybacks NOTTING HILL in several scenes and CRASH in one scene. Also, the car rally sequence embarasses itself by inserting grainy and pretty obvious clips of racing stock footage. But, discounting the movie's climax, the most superduperovermelodramatic moment has to be when a hysterical woman bogarts a microphone on a Canadian football field in front of thousands of fans to beg her husband's forgiveness. Again, that's Bollywood. Basically, when you sit down to watch a Bollywood flick, you've got to come with the proper frame of mind and accept certain things at face value (the over-the-top dramatics; the unabashed romance; at times, the crude humor; the tendency for coincidences; and the song and dance acts). These films are definitely ballparks away from the typical and more ""sophisticated"" Hollywood product. But, if you get hooked, brother, you GET hooked! I buy a lot of dvds and, at this stage, half of my purchases are of the Bollywood persuasion.

By the way, there's a heapload of musical numbers here. However, most of the songs tend to blend into each other and are mostly unmemorable, and I only sat thru 'em because most featured Katrina. The more entertaining ones are ""Fanah"" and ""For Your Eyes Only."" Sad to say, but the best song may have been the briefly played tango ""Santa Maria (Del Buen Ayre)"" by the awesome Go Tan Project. To cap off this three-and-a-half-starred dvd, there's a ho-hum ""Making Of"" featurette (21 minutes long) and a deleted song in the Special Features department.

And if you do see HUMKO DEEWANA KAR GAYE and you think that Katrina and Akshay are good together, then, trust me, you'll be blown away by their sizzling chemistry in NAMASTEY LONDON.",1185926400,8,4790,5.223667100130039

It was packaged carefully; nothing damaged. The DVD case not as thick as most cases, but fits well when there's hardly room on a shelf.",1395705600,,313,4.396551724137931
