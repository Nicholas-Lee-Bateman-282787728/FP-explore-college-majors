7983071,4,B00008G7BM,"If you're reasonably open-minded and curious, I think you will enjoy watching ""Mysterious Forces Beyond,"" a video presentation hosted by Nick Mancuso regarding dreams, miracles, and angels.  I watched all three episodes from start to finish, and found them to be informative and quite interesting.  I was particularly impressed with the expressed views on dreams... where anything can happen, and visions, ideas, warnings, nightmares, as well as pure nonsense all play their part in the theater of the sleeping consciousness.  With all due respect to the believers, I did not find miracles and angels as captivating because the stories that were told are too fantastic to be accepted as true without further scrutiny and some scientific backing.  A skeptic would call them ""elaborate hoaxes"" or ""hallucinations,"" whereas an unquestioning believer would say they are creations of a divine force.  Maybe someday, in the distant future (hopefully sooner), evolution of the human mind and physics will bring us closer to the truth.  Personally, I think that an extraordinary claim requires extraordinary evidence in support of the claim.... Blind faith alone may or may not be enough; for example, it might work in various aspects of psychological thinking and behavior, but will not work where -- in the process of believing and acting on the belief -- the laws of physics are violated, such as jumping off a tall building because the jumper believes he or she can fly (we all know what will happen).",1335571200,3,1497,5.139917695473251
