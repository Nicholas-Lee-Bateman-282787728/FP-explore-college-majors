Doris will always be the sweetheart of song!!!",1355011200,3,442,5.152777777777778

3525728,5,B001D5C1EY,"While the settings changed several times over the seasons which was a bit confusing, who cares, it's Doris Day.  She is always fun to watch and her smiles brighten my day!",1280620800,16,171,4.516129032258065
3525729,5,B001D5C1EY,"Doris Day never wanted to do television. Upon the death of her husband in the spring of 1968 she found out by her lawyers that he had signed a contract with CBS for Day to do a TV series and a bunch of specials, all without her consent. To say Doris was disinchanted is an understatement. Day thought that after all the films and albums she made she was set for life financially, but realized her husband (who was also her manager) had squandered her entire life-savings. Doris did what she had to do; she fulfilled her contract with the network not only because she felt she had to since there was a contract involved, but she desperately needed the money.

 ""The Doris Day Show"" went on the air in September, 1968 and lasted five years at a time when broadcast television was changing rapidly. The networks, most notably CBS, was doing away with rural sitcoms like ""Green Acres"" and creating shows like ""All In The Family"" and ""The Mary Tyler Moore Show"" that appealed to an urban audience. This explains the reason why Doris' series went through a bunch of changes nearly every year it was on. The show simply never found its identity. One year the sitcom took place on a farm, then its locale was changed to San Francisco. One year Doris had kids, the next they were never mentioned again. I believe this is the reason many cable networks like ""TV Land"" have never broadcast Doris' sitcom. Unfortunately for this reason many have never seen the ""Day Show"", but thanks to DVD viewers can watched these episodes time and time again.

 I can't say I love ""The Doris Day Show""; it's no where near the classic that Lucille Ball's sitcoms from the sixties are, but it's still an enjoyable and great way to pass 25 minutes and to view a wonderful, former movie star in the last big thing she did. The episodes are forgettable, but Doris more than compensates for the mediocre material.

 Doris' series never won any big Emmy Awards, but it garnered respectable ratings during its original run. The following are the show's Nielsen figures:

Season 1-#30
Season 2-#10
Season 3-#20
Season 4-#24
Season 5-out of the top 30 which is the main reason CBS axed it in the spring of 1973.

 This box set contains all 128 episodes of ""The Doris Day Show"" cleaned from their original prints. The crowning jewel here are the wonderful audio commentaries Day did for select episodes while being in her eighties. Her memory is quite impressive!",1280102400,22,2427,4.625581395348838
3525730,1,B001D5C1EY,"I love Doris Day, that is why I purchased this set. I had watched some of the shows when I was young. This show got high ratings, when it was aired, but is rejected by TV channels now. I know why, after watching it again. Doris is lovely, but her then husband signed her on for this series without her knowledge. He died and left her in debt; she did this series to make money. She never wanted to. It shows, in the first season, she looks ridiculous on a farm, while wearing pounds of make up. They used filters on the camera lenses in an attempt to mask her age, she was too old to be playing a mother of young children.

Their grandmother, yes. I grimaced when watching the first and second seasons. It was obvious that Doris wasn't happy doing this series and wasn't suited for television. She's an excellent actress, but her acting was dull and uninspired here. Her children apparently died in later seasons, so did her father. However, John Dehner livened up the cast and it was actually not bad. I'm not sure forgetting your children and your father is good , though.

This series can't be recommended as entertainment, unless you enjoy seeing a middle age women pretending she's young and you like fashion shows. I still love you, Doris Day, but this was awful. For a series about truly young single women, try ""That Girl"" or ""Mary Tyler Moore"". I doubt that Doris is proud of this show.",1252800000,18,1395,4.4453125
3525731,5,B001D5C1EY,"I love this show, it was never in reruns so when it came out on DVD I was stoked! I watched this show every week when it was on the air and who didn't want to be Doris Day living in San Francisco in a Fab apartment working for a hip magazine with a wardrobe change in every scene.

The show went through several changes over the five years it was on. Season 1 and 2 Doris is living on her Dad's ranch in Mill Valley CA with her two boys, She starts working at ""Today's World"" magazine in season 2. In season 3 Doris makes the logical choice to move into San Francisco with her two sons into a FAB apartment above an italian cafe.

Season 4 is where the show really changed. In an effort to change with the times, Doris is now a single career women dating Doctor Peter Lawford and there is an entire new cast at the magazine. She still has the same apartment but she is now a writer for ""Today's World"". This same format is carried into season 5.  There is no real final episode to the series which is the only fault I have with it.  During Season 5 Doris is still dating Doctor Peter Lawford as well as politico Patrick O'Neil.

Yes the show is simple and the format change in season 4 is awkward but the outstanding production values (movie quality) and the 70's fashions and sets are great, its simple and funny entertainment of a better time in the history of TV.  Doris never looked better and I still want that apartment, red convertible and unbelivable I Magnum wardrobe.  A must for Day fans. The quality of the DVD transfer is great and looks just like new.",1230681600,52,1565,4.231543624161074
3525732,5,B001D5C1EY,"I got season one of this show when it showed up deeply discounted at Costco. This show ran from 1968 until 1973, and I hadn't seen it on TV probably since its initial run. The show aired at a time when American culture was going through a great transition. When Doris Day first went on the air Bonanza and The Andy Griffith Show were the top television draws. By the time it went off the air it was All in the Family and M.A.S.H. Thus it is amazing that Doris Day stayed on the air for five years during this time when her clean-cut image probably drew ridicule that seems odd today, and then walked away from her show - the show was not cancelled due to poor ratings. In fact, it did quite well throughout its run.

It will take you back to a simpler time, but then so did Doris Day's films and I still find those enjoyable. The show did make a major change in season three to accommodate the changing times. Initially it had a rural setting with Doris' two sons playing a major part in the show. In 1970 the show had her moving to San Francisco - alone - and never really fully explained what happened to her sons. Today, at a time when children are encouraged to have curfews and depend on mom and dad until they are 25, the whole counter-culture movement of the 60's/70's getting to the point where it effects The Doris Day Show seems strange, but believe me, it's an enjoyable strange.",1219449600,26,1390,4.285171102661597
3525753,1,B001D5C1EY,Why do no other reviewers address the fact that MPI has issued speeded up (TIme Compressed) episodes on all 5 seasons of The Doris Day Show. I love the series itself but will not purchase due to the time compressed episodes.,1451865600,,224,4.487804878048781
3525754,5,B001D5C1EY,"The Doris Day Show is a gentle, subtle, old-fashioned TV series. When I got into Doris Day some years ago, I had no idea she had her own show. When I started reading about it, the reviews weren't too promising. Not all of them were bad, though, some were exactly very rewarding. Some criticized the show as being bland and very old-fashioned, but the main complaint was about the constant premise and cast changes. Reading those bad reviews didn't stop me from wanting to watch this show, however, so I went ahead and ordered it.

The Doris Day Show is your typical sitcom. Its not laugh-out-loud funny; its very gentle, much like Day's comedy movies she did, but maybe even more laid back and soft, though. Its pretty family friendly, and at times it can be a bit cheesy. It is noticeable, too, that filters were used to photograph Doris Day, who was in her mid-forties when the show started, in an attempt to disguise her age. In the first season, Doris Day stars as Doris Martin, a widow of two young sons, Billy (Philip Brown) and Toby (Todd Starke). In the first episode, Doris and her sons move back to a rural ranch north of San Francisco, and spending several years in the big city. There, they lived with Doris' widower father, Buck (Denver Pyle), his ranch hand Leroy (James Hampton), and their live-in maids, Aggie (Fran Ryan), and after the first ten episodes, Juanita (Naomi Stevens). In the second season, Doris begins to commute to the city for work. She finds employment as a ''executive secretary'' as Today's World, working for Michael Nicholson (McLean Stevenson). Her best friend is fellow secretary Myrna Gibbons (Rose Marie), who works for Ron Harvey (Paul Smith). In the third season, Doris, tired of commuting from the country to the city, moves into a apartment in San Francisco, which just happens to be located directly above an Italian restaurant owned by Louie (Bernie Kopell) and Angie Pallucci (Kaye Ballard). This season also introduces Doris' nemesis Willard Jarvis (Billy De Wolfe), who moves in next door. In the fourth and fifth seasons, Doris suddenly becomes a swinging, single career woman. Her two sons, her father, and nearly all other cast members from the earlier seasons (excluding Kopell and Ballard) are gone, with no exact explanation given as to why. Doris still works for Today's World, now as a reporter, under the supervision of editor Cy Bennett (John Dehner). Doris' new best buddy is Jackie Parker (Jackie Joseph), Cy's dingy secretary. Willard Jarvis (still Billy De Wolfe) becomes the owner of the building where Doris lives, and Doris begins an on-again-off-again romance with Dr. Peter Lawrence (Peter Lawford). The only constant this show has is Doris Day as Doris Martin, but you still don't know if she's going to be ''Mrs. Martin'' or ''Miss Martin'' until you know when and where she's which one after multiple viewings or by having knowledge of the show.

Can you follow all this? This is the only true downfall to The Doris Day Show. No wonder it wasn't a success in reruns. Audiences (especially those who only tuned in occasionally) couldn't have possibly followed the inconsistency of the many different cast of characters and premises, especially if the episodes were aired out of broadcast order. It has been suggested, by other viewers and fans, that each season skipped perhaps two or three years of the show's story, but if this is true, it is never addressed on the show. When looking at what TV was in the late 1960s and how it changed drastically in the early 1970s, one can easily tell why The Doris Day Show changed so much year after year; they wanted to keep the show in style. In 1968, when the show debuted, rural sitcoms like Mayberry RFD and The Beverly Hillbillies were popular, but they soon became passe. Then, Here's Lucy was a mega-hit, influencing The Doris Day Show to make Doris Martin very Lucy-like and molding John Dehner to be her straight man, much like Gale Gordon was to Lucy on her shows. The success of The Mary Tyler Moore Show probably had the biggest affect as to what The Doris Day Show should be like. Mary Richards was a single and independent career woman, so that's perhaps why Doris Martin became one too (without any explanation), but the success was not duplicated. It seems that every season of The Doris Day Show was a different show. The first episode of the first four seasons were like four different pilot episodes, setting up the premise for that season. Only season five continued the story that had come about in season four, but amped up the romance in Doris' life (hence the revolving door of many different ''boyfriends'').

Now, I love The Doris Day Show, but as I've said above, the inconsistency of the show is its only drawback. If you're a true Doris Day fan, or simply a fan of classic TV, you will probably like it (but not all Day fans like it); but if you don't like shows that have problems establishing themselves with some sense of continuity, you probably won't like it at all. There is no depth here really, the writing is only decent to put it nicely. I do recommend it, but I must strongly encourage you to take into consideration what I've stated above.",1446940800,2,5194,4.724366041896362

3525760,2,B001D5C1EY,"Personally, I was disappointed as the series went on. The first season was the best, but there was still a worldly (secular) mindset. As the series went on, I found myself skipping episodes because of drinking, or wrong relationships, or worldly behavior. I did enjoy particular episodes scattered throughout, but if I would have known what the overall series was like, I wouldn't have bought it.

3525789,5,B001D5C1EY,"Television today leaves a lot to be desired, especially if you agree that TV choices can have a significant impact on the viewer. So instead of letting the profiteers and culture gods in today's Hollywood have free reign in our house, we decided to only watch shows that are uplifting and funny without constant vulgarity, sexual innuendo, and extremism. And that's where old TV shows like The Doris Day Show and That Girl and Hart to Hart and the like come in.

The Doris Day show is simply wonderful because, well, it's Doris. The plot lines are creative and funny, the supporting cast and guest stars are perfect, and you get ... Doris. And, wonderfully, you get Denver Pyle, too. It's a heck of a duo. And if you think that kids today wouldn't like this show, I would challenge that. Our experience is that once they watch an episode, they get hooked not only into Doris, but other old, good, and wholesome shows, too.",1391731200,10,922,4.587878787878788

 As far as poor acting, an actor is really limited by the scripts and the directors. If you like good morals, lack of low-life language, and lack of over-sexed pictures you will probably enjoy the films too.",1367712000,9,429,4.417721518987341
