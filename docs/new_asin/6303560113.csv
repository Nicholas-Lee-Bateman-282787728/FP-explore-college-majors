678317,5,6303560113,"Carole Lombard is fabulous & beautiful in this 1934 Paramount Pictures love story co-starring Fred MacMurray.
This VHS Black / White Standard picture (before WideScreen) is of great quality and clear sound.  An original trailer is included.
Summary - a manicurist (Lombard) is seeking to marry a millionaire.  Broke Playboy (MacMurray) is also seeking to wed a wealthy spouse.  As all depression black comedies they end up following in love no matter how hard they resist.  Hollywood, Love & Fate of the 1930's guarrantees the audience to get a great story and a happy ending to boot.
Lombard & MacMurray are fabulous.  A fine performance by Ralph Belamy helps support this great story.  This Lombard at her best.  Enjoy.",1048204800,4,721,5.008403361344538
678318,4,6303560113,"With Mitchell Leisen directing, and Carole Lombard and Fred MacMurray starring, it would be impossible for this movie to be completely unsuccessful. The script, unlike later ones produced for Leisen by the likes of Preston Sturges, Billy Wilder, and Charles Brackett, is somewhat weaker than what he would work with later in the decade. But the principles are all so strong that they are able to transcend the weak script and achieve something much, much better than it ought to have been.
The strength of the film is without question Carole Lombard. My personal opinion has long been that she was simply the finest screen comedienne that Hollywood ever produced. Remove her from this film, and it would have been decidedly second rate.
The most fascinating scene in the movie occurs when Fred MacMurray and Carole Lombard are in her apartment when a gentleman who has a date with her knocks on the door. MacMurray, pretending to be her husband, answers the door. The part of the gentleman caller is played by none other than William Demarest, who would, of course, later costar with Fred MacMurray in MY THREE SONS, playing Uncle Charlie. To make the story complete, a year after HANDS ACROSS THE TABLE came out, MacMurray and Lombard would make a second film together, the less successful THE PRINCESS COMES ACROSS. One of MacMurray's costars is William Frawley, who was Demarest's predecessor on MY THREE SONS.
I found the Ralph Bellamy character to be highly problematic. A rich man confined to a wheelchair who is clearly in love with Lombard, he goes from trying to propose to her one minute to encouraging Fred MacMurray to propose to her (and being delighted at their engagement) the next. His character just muddies the narrative of the film, and as much as I usually enjoy Ralph Bellamy, the movie would have been stronger without his character.
In short, a thoroughly enjoyable film, but not a complete success. Definitely not the best work by any of the major participants in the film.",1007942400,5,1997,4.876470588235295
678319,4,6303560113,"A fortune-hunting manicurist and a playboy on his uppers make this a charming, stylish lighthearted comedy/romance.  This little flick from 1935 offers sparkling performances all around - especially from effervescent Lombard, that beautiful screwball queen of the thirties. Carole has to decide whether to choose rich yet wheelchair- bound Bellamy or poor, handsome MacMurray. The dialogue is excellent in this cute love story which features strong characterizations and believable twists.  The stars make a delightfully well-blended team in the Vina Delmar story, given a sparkling Norman Krasna-Vincent Lawrence-Herbert Fields screenplay in which the pair followed the manicure with a romantic fling and enjoyed it so much that they ditched their prospective spouses and stayed together forever.  Ralph Bellamy and Astrid Allwyn ably portray the dull rejects.  This highly praised and profitable film established Leisen as a comedy director of distinction; the influence of Lubitsch is cleary discenrnable.  The movie also boosted Lombard to the top echelon of Paramount stars, and it pointed the way to MacMurray's long and successful career.",958694400,,1145,5.711764705882353
7849907,5,6303560113,"A great film with a jaw-dropping close up of a kiss between Carole Lombard and Fred MacMurray..long, slow involvement here, beautiful beyond expectations. The Ralph Bellamy adjacent plot works so well, with Carole mesmerizing him with her fast patter and flirtatious activities.

Very funny..Carole giving Fred a manicure..also, the opening subway scene..hilarious.

7849911,4,6303560113,"Watching carol lombard is always a treat! Even when the material is mediocre she is still riveting and talented,and when the material as in this screenplay is good and deeply layered her performance is always compelling! Truth be told in her movies you recall her all too vividly when the movie ends,even though macmurray is good as her comedic foil. The movie is really a lower class story of struggling manicurist not looking for love but money,that's all she believes in and love seems an empty trifle. Such alienation is all too common in today's world making this story set against depression type circumstances realistic. It is gritty at times...but there are also two competing lovers,neither of whom interests her,some funny scenes at which this actress is all too good. Also the one character who is rich at the story's beginning,loses everything,but has trouble with the idea of work,and this story also interplays throughout the story,and we are lucky to find this film among the retrospective volume of 6 of her films recently produced. The finale seems to be a happy gloss on the film,and isn't in tune with the psychology of the heroine all the way along,but its a comedy. A good performance by lombard!",1332460800,,1217,4.912621359223301

7849913,5,6303560113,"Hands Across the Table is a fun little film about a gold digging manicurist named Regi (Carole Lombard). She meets a rich man, a cripple who adores her company. Because of his inability to walk, she disregards him as a love interest, but she does spill her problems to him. One of them begins when she meets Theodore Drew III (Fred MacMurray), a formally rich man who lost his fortune in the stock market crash. Now he and Regi are in the same boat, hoping to marry for money. But they have another thing in common; they're falling in love with each other.

Who knew that MacMurray had so much personality, and who would have guessed he'd have so much chemistry with Lombard? The two absolutely sizzle on the screen. Each are hilarious and romantic at the same time, making a film with an average story become outstanding.",1174608000,2,822,4.554054054054054
7849914,5,6303560113,"This romantic comedy has a sweetness and charm which finally put Carole Lombard on the ""A"" list and cemented her stardom. Too tame to live up to the screwball comedies it is often compared to, it has sort of been forgotten.

This was an important film for others as well. Lombard pleaded with Ernst Lubitsch to let Mitchell Leisen direct and her great instincts for talent put Leisen on the fast track also. Cinematographer Ted Tetzlaff became her photographer of choice, and looking at how lovely she is here, you can see why.

Lombard is manicurist Regi Allen, looking for a rich sugar daddy. Ralph Bellamy is  paralyzed ex-pilot Allen Macklyn, a millionaire who takes a shine to her and becomes her friend. He has romantic notions as well but in a better than usual role for Bellamy, it is he that helps her discover that love is more important than money.

Fred MacMurray is terrific as Theodore Drew III, who has the society name but no longer the money to go with it. Regi doesn't know this, of course, and when she discovers he's engaged to Vivian Snowden (Astrid Allwyn), the ""Pineapple Queen,"" that's when the two really begin to fall in love. There is a real sweetness and charm to scenes between the two as he bums a place to sleep from her and she tucks him in at night.

But Vivian discovers Ted's crazy phone call from Bemuda was actually made from New York and sets out to put a stop to it. Ted, however, knows it must really be love when he finds himself thinking about looking for a job! Lombard and MacMurray had such an easy repore it's no mystery why they were so often together in her movies from this period.

Both fun and charming, ""Hands Across the Table"" has a certain sweetness that gets under the viewer's skin and makes the slight story very enjoyable. A fun ending is right in line with the easy charm of the rest of the film. Though some screwball elements are in place here, those expecting that type of farce will be let down. Those fond of romantic comedy, however, and Lombard in particular, will love this film.",1171843200,7,2046,4.501347708894879
7849915,4,6303560113,"This is a good screwball comedy that sacrifices over-the-top humor for a more tenderly romantic approach. Manicurist Carole Lombard decides that marrying for love just leads to heartbreak, so she'll go after money instead. She meets the wealthy though crippled Ralph Bellamy and plans to marry him if he asks. But then she meets playboy Fred MacMurray, whose wealthy family has been flattened by the Depression and who shares the same cynical views as Lombard about marriage, and before Bellamy ever gets a chance to pop the question, she and MacMurray are an item. He was about to marry the rich Astrid Allwyn (for her money, of course), but with one thing leading to another, Lombard and MacMurray end up planning to marry each other. Some of the incidents are a bit of a stretch, but the story moves along quickly and has its share of humorous, snappy dialogue. Lombard and MacMurray are excellent together, and the results are a very decent light-hearted comedy.",1150070400,3,966,4.896341463414634
7849916,4,6303560113,"Although ""Hands Across the Table"" doesn't take the broad strokes other 1930s comedies may have taken it prove to be entertaining nonetheless.
 This is one of those typical depression era films where the characters say they want to marry for money instead of love.
 Carole Lombard does a wonderful job playing the role, though I'm not sure if she comes off as witty as she did in ""My Man Godrey"" or ""To Be Or Not To Be"" But her charm is clear throughout. I'm tempted to wonder how Joan Blondell would have taken on the role. Though I don't think Blondell made the impact Lombard did.
 In the film Lombard plays Regi Allen a manicurist looking to fall in love with a millionair. So she goes on about her work daydreaming of the day her man will come.
 That man is played by Fred MacMurray. He is one of those rich people who acts anything but rich. He has no snobbish attitude and wants to lead a carefree life.
 But the film doesn't end there. Just to stir things up we have Ralph Bellamy as Allen Macklyn. A millionair who makes his feelings towards Regi known.
 The movie was directed by Mitchell Leisen (To Each His Own, and The Big Broadcast of 1938,Bob Hope's first film) and it carries a very suggestive tone. A lot of things are hinted. Two characters live together out of wedlock. You may be thinking so what? But, this was 1935, such things were just not shown onscreen.
 Bottom-line: Charming 1930s comedies. Lombard and MacMurray have lots of chemistry and offer plenty of laughs. Fans of old-fashioned comedies will enjoy it.",1080345600,6,1536,4.543478260869565
