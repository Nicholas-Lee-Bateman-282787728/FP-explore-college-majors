8375880,5,B002O1IUGO,"This is the story of William Cushing, a Civil War Naval hero.  There have been 5 Navy ships named to honor this man.  My husband was on the 4th one--the USS Cushing, a destroyer.  The number of his ship was 797.  Only one man has had 5 ships named after him in the Navy.  That gives you a clue as to what he accomplished in the Civil War.",1376265600,,338,3.911764705882353
