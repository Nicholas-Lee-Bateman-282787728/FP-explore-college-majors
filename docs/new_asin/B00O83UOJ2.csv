8682454,5,B00O83UOJ2,"I had tried to stream this film, but could not find it on Netflix or Amazon. As an Alan Arkin fan, I remembered this film from decades ago and how much I enjoyed it. It is the true story of a Lithuanian defector who jumped aboard an American warship from a Russian ship, but was returned to the Russians because of bureaucratic and military indecision by the Americans. A truly heartwarming film !",1521676800,,397,4.4520547945205475
8682455,5,B00O83UOJ2,"I was in this movie as I played the head Russian thug who beat Alan Arkin up. My wife looked for this forever and finally found a copy from some lady in Moose Jaw Canada or some place like that, I will have to get one from here and compare the quality. The one I have still has markings of place commercial here.",1496707200,,312,3.9682539682539684
8682456,5,B00O83UOJ2,"This is a moving true story of a man who lived in tyrant, but loved liberty such that he risked all. Alan Atkin does a superb job portraying this man.",1480550400,,150,4.033333333333333
8682457,4,B00O83UOJ2,"The Defection of Simas Kudirka has been always seen as a movie whose main topic is the struggle for individual freedom and its relentless suppression in the former USSR. Nothing to object so far. Neither to Alan Arkin's genius for performing any kind of character much more than convincingly: almost tragic in here; comic at The Russians Are Coming the Russians Are Coming (1966) and Papi (1969); vicious at Wait Until Dark (1967); somewhat cartoon-like at Rocketeer (1991); etc. Nor to his gift not only to imitate foreign accents, but for indeed pronouncing foreign languages correctly (The Russians Are Coming, Papi, The Defection). Not to forget, though, the performances of Donald Pleasence as Captain Popov (the good Russian), Marvin Silbersher as Commander Burkalis (the bad Lithuanian), and specially George Dzundza as Communist Party delegate Gruzauskas (the vicious Lithuanian).
Now, the struggle for individual freedom and its relentless suppression in the former USSR is not the only struggle for freedom to appear in this TV movie. The Lithuanian problem (the Baltic problem, if you want) is present as well, even if briefly. Around minute 50, Commander Devon (Richard Jordan), after learning that Simonas 'Simas' Kudirka lives in Klaipeda, asks him: Lietuva? In Russia? And Kudirka answers emphatically: No Russia! Klaipeda contrary. Russia take Lietuva. Lietuva prisoner. In spite of Kudirka's broken English, there is no possible mistake: Lithuania is not Russia!, Klaipeda opposes Russian power. Russia invaded Lithuania. Lithuania is an occupied country. Simas Kudirka yearned for his own freedom, but also for that of Lithuania. Hiatoricaly, that was a warning. During the 1970s and early 1980s more and more incidents happened. When perestroika arrived, the World got surprised. None so blind as those who will not see; none so deaf as those who will not hear.",1472860800,,1880,5.35472972972973
8682458,5,B00O83UOJ2,"I was interested in both actually seeing this movie for a long time as I lived briefly next door to Simas Kudirka in the late 70's.  He did tell us a bit about his life and defection, but I had no idea all he went through until the movie and the book.  Nicest family you'd ever want to meet.",1442016000,5,291,3.9152542372881354
8682459,5,B00O83UOJ2,"An incredibly accurate portrayal by Alan Arkin of Simas Kudirka, a Lithuanian seaman who sacrificed and gave his all to obtain freedom. The Lithuanian diaspora was infuriated that America handed Simas back over to the Russians. Through Simas, the viewer sees what a man is willing to do after experiencing barbarism of Soviet rule.",1428624000,5,331,5.148148148148148
8682460,5,B00O83UOJ2,Five stars!!! I played the driver in the end bringing Simas and his wife to visit the ship. (I was crew member of the ship) Had lunch with Alan Arkin on the ships messdeck one day. He told me about the stunt tricks when filming Freeby and the Bean. Making the movie was a great experience.,1426809600,4,289,4.178571428571429
8682461,5,B00O83UOJ2,"I saw this movie on tv in the early 80s and have been looking for it.  This is a phenomenal movie that should have been showing at the theatre.
Alan Arkin nails it!!  Absolutely fabulous!",1420243200,5,187,4.314285714285714
