8086570,4,B000BGR0O2,"Tatsumiyajima is an island off the coast of Japan. It is a self sustained island that is a source of hope in a world overrun with alien invaders called The Festum. The teenagers that live on this island pilot mechas called Fafner. Fafner is the only means for destroying The Festum. Kazuki is the greatest warrior among the Fafner pilots. He has a strong sense of justice and loyalty to his loved ones. He risks everything, along with his friends, to protect humanity.

There are a lot of mecha series out there. This one is above average. It doesn't reach the level of Evangelion, but it's a heck of a lot better than Gasraki. I think that it is most like RahXephon. If you've seen RahXephon, then you can get a pretty good idea of what this is like. It has good animation, voice acting, and a suitable soundtrack. There is plenty of action and drama is Fafner as well.

After hearing all of that you're probably wondering, ""why not 5 stars then""? The reason I can't give it 5 stars is b/c some of the characters seemed very distant. Even though the characters feelings and love for each other was a major theme, the relationships between them weren't developed very well. I think that the psychology of the Fafner pilots was focused on too much. The thing that would have made this series great was stronger relationships between them. This is the reason It wasn't great. Don't get me wrong, Fafner is definitely good, but it lacked the most important thing it needed...character development.",1358467200,,1494,4.633962264150943
8086571,5,B000BGR0O2,"OK people, what is Fafner?

Before I get into the story, I will try to answer a hypothetical question first: Who should not and who should watch Fafner.

To begin with, if you are a die-hard fan of Evangelion or Gundam etc. than most probably you will not want to watch this one because it has some similarities with the previous mention animes indeed; and you most probably will `blow away' a great anime like this. On the other hand, people who would like to watch a very good anime, with strong storyline, twists, romance, lots of action and of course Mechas (belongs to the so called sci-fi category) than you should watch this one.

Let us proceed to the storyline:

It starts with the life of people, teenagers going to school, adults to work etc. by introducing the viewer to their everyday life. The place where the story starts is called Tatsumiya Island. To make the long story short, aliens attack earth and obviously the Island gets under attack, devastating their lives and throwing the teenagers into battle; basically, because they are the ones who are able to fly the Mechas. Additionally, power games will start to evolve, exhausting battles all over the globe will occur, between sort of government and military parties etc. and all the teenagers are caught in the middle of all this. As the series proceed, many questions will be raised (which will be answered - directly or indirectly - in the end of the series), the bounds between the main protagonists will become stronger (and of course romance), the viewer will witness all the emotional rollercoaster that these youngsters will go through and some of them will even die.

This sums up the story. I could get into more details and tell you what will go on in every episode but I refrained myself from doing this because I believe that if someone decides to watch the series than I would give away the entire suspense and twists of it.

Overall critique about the series:

If you are into Mechas for a while, then most probably you have watched Mecha series and are familiar with the common pattern that this kind of animes are following: teenagers are the ones who can fly the Mechas, alien invasion, battles, romance, power games etc (as for the good guy vs. bad guy, in the Mecha series this usually presents a grey zone). Therefore, why should someone watch Fafner? If you are not into animes for a long time, should you watch Fafner?

The answer would be yes. First of all, because of its animation, which is very good. Second, because of its storyline, which although is based on the common pattern that is been explained above, yet, it manages to bring forth new ideas, a solid and strong storyline, many twists and mainly till the final episodes you will not be able to foresee its final conclusion. Even if you are a die-hard fan of Evangelion, RahXephon etc. this one is definitely worth a watch from you. As for the action, the series are packed with it. Third, because of its dub; in other words, if you belong to the category of people that instead of Japanese would prefer the English dub, it is very good done and professional orchestrated. Thumbs up!

Apart from it, if you buy the box set or the complete collection, then the box is exactly the one you see in the picture, which is very strong, like a shelf and doesn't brake easily. As for extras, the usual stuff like previews of other animes, not credit opening/ending and so forth.

To the most obvious question: Buying it or not? To be honest, if you can afford the money than I will definitely recommend these series to you, if, you can not afford the money than try to rent it and watch it.

To conclude these series are highly recommended!

I hope that I could help you...",1169769600,,3721,4.587349397590361
8086572,4,B000BGR0O2,"Dissatisfied with life on the island and growing uncomfortable with his role as a Fafner pilot, Kazuki Makabe chooses flight. With the manipulative Kariya in tow, Kazuki steals his Mark Elf Fafner and heads for the mainland seeking answers. Along the way he is witness to the devastation left in the wake of years of conflict, a civilization torn asunder by the Festum threat. His journey into the unknown is brief, however. Kariya once again reveals her true allegiance, delivering Kazuki and his Fafner into the hands of the Neo UN. Though a prisoner, Kazuki continues to learn more about the world he and the others had been shielded from all their lives. He learns that the Neo UN is far from powerless, deploying Fafner models of its own and drawing up plans to use its Human Force to strike at the heart of the Festum. He also has an unexpected reunion with Michio, a Neo UN pilot who once lived on Tatsumiya Island with his researcher father, revealing that many who might have lived under the Arcadian Project have done more than simply leave home. But the greatest mystery of all awaits Kazuki in the depths of the Neo UN base that acts as his prison. There, Michio's father conducts research on a new model of Fafner, the Mark Sein, using the remains of the Mark Elf. Assisting and observing him is a woman who bears a striking resemblance to Akane Makabe, Kazuki's deceased mother...

Though armed and well defended, the Neo UN base is soon the target of the Festum. Striking first from within and then with a massive invasion force, the enemy's attack comes so swiftly that few are truly prepared. Soon Kazuki is forced to fight for his life along side his captors, a struggle which draws him ever closer to the heart of the facility where the new Fafner sleeps and waits.

The Neo UN leaders have little concern for what transpires at the base, however. While the base suffers beneath this crippling assault, another invasion, this one perpetrated by the Neo UN itself, is underway upon Tatsumiya Island. Frustrated by Alvis' stubbornness, the Neo UN deploys its armada to occupy the island and lay claim to all of its secrets. Faced with the threat of all out war, Commander Makabe must choose whether to resist the invasion or surrender peacefully. His eventual capitulation belies another purpose, even as the Neo UN storms the facilities of Alvis in search of Tatsumiya's Fafner units as well as the island's mysterious core. While the hangers are easy to claim, the core chamber is unexpectedly empty, its former occupant choosing to set foot upon the stage.

Volume 4 offers up more of the mystery, action, and conundrum that have become staple for the Fafner series as a whole. The four episodes on this disk are some of the more action oriented of the series thus far, and also the most enlightening. At last the impact of the Festum, and their identity, begin to see light. We learn about the genesis of the Arcadian Project, the reason the children are `born' they way they are, and take a glimpse into the consciousness of the enemy. Like Star Trek's Borg, the Festum exist as a collective that does not accept divergence within the ranks. While it is refreshing to finally receive some answers, at times it feels as if the producers are offering nothing more than token hints at what really is going on behind the scenes. Explanation can be so hasty that another viewing is required to pick up on details often missed the first time around.

While the constantly shifting plot and lack of clear explanation may continue to vex some viewers, it is becoming clear that patience with Fafner will prove to be fruitful the longer one remains loyal to its calling. The series is truly hitting its stride now, and it will be interesting to see where it goes from here.",1164844800,,3786,4.688721804511278
