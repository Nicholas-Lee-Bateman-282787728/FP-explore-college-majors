7817031,5,6301910842,"Orient Express VS The Rockers- All I can say about this match is wow. This is one of the best tag team matches you'll ever witness. Check this one out and be amazed.

Sherri begs Warrior to give Randy Savage a title shot but he says nothing, then she gets on her knees and begs. Still nothing and then he pushes her over. Savage runs to the ring to attack Warrior but he's gone.

Barbarian VS Bossman: I love the Barbarian or any wrestler in that mold in the early 90's like Haku, Barbarian, Warlord to name a few. They always made wrestlers look tougher. This was a entertaining match but hardly a classic and dragged in some places and the ending was stupid.

Sgt Slaughter VS Ultimate Warrior: Warrior could have pinned Slaughter in under a minute but Sherri interferes and so does Savage. Call for a DQ? Nope! Warrior rolls in and gets beat up by Slaughter. A slow paced match and if you now wrestling, then you knew Savage would cost Warrior the title in the end.

Mountie VS Koko B Ware: A typical WWF PPV would always put a crappy match before the main event. This is Mounties debut and a typical WWF early 90's jobber match; Very entertaining though.

Savage is on a rampage to retain the world title. Then interviews with wrestlers over about the Rumble, fun stuff.

Million Dollar Man and Virgin VS Dustin and Dusty Rhodes: I could careless about this match even though it's a Million Dollar Man match. A decent match with a surprise finish of Milion Dollar Man winning in it. Virgil turns on Million Dollar Man after the match, setting up the feud.

Royal Rumble Match: A very good Rumble with Hulkster winning in the end, brother!

Overall, a excellent Rumble to own.",1252886400,,1679,4.481967213114754

January 19, 1991
Miami Arena
Miami, Florida

The Rocker V. Orient Expess
Kick ass opener that actually was the match of the night. Great Tag Team Match and it shows why the Tag teams were so good back then. Awesome macth with the Rockers winning. ****1/4 I little side note: If the Rope didn't broke in the Match between the Hart Foundation & Rockers in October of 1990, this match would have been for the WWF Tag Team Championship and I think would have changed Tag Team Wrestling forever...I'm dead serious when I'm telling you this.

Big Boss Man V. Barbarian
The match was ok but the crowd was VERY into it. Which leaves me to believe one of two things...the crowd was actually very into or more likely, the crowd was so dead during it that they dubbed in crowd reaction. Boss Man wins. **1/2

WWF Championship:
Ultimate Warrior (Champion) V. Sgt. Slaughter
ok Championship match with Savage interfering and helping Slaughter win the title. **1/2...The Crowd in Miami was shocked, so shocked that they wouldn't even let Slaughter eat dinner at a restaurent because of the heat he got. Scary.

Dusty & Dustin Rhodes V. Ted DiBiase & Virgil
I remember this match being longer, but it's good that it wasn't. Hey...It's Goldust!!! DiBiase & Virgil win and both the Rhodes head to WCW a little while later. ** This is were Virgil leaves DiBiase

Royal Rumble Match:
awesome Rumble with a very weak final three...Hogan...Eathquake...& Nast Boy Knobs... Hogan & two of this buddies. I wonder who was going to win? Of course Hogan wins because he never loses because he's selfish. ****

Overall, a good rumble for the rumble match, tag team opener, and for the shocking title change",1138924800,,1696,4.712837837837838
7817033,4,6301910842,"This is my second favorite Royal Rumble event in history. Here are the matches.

1. Shawn Michaels and Marty Jannetty vs. Tanaka and Kato 8/10

Good opener. A lttle too long but has a lot of action.

2. Big Boss Man vs. The Barbarian 5/10

I thought this match was going to be good but it was actually pretty boring. I think it is because I do not like either of these guys.

3. Sgt. Slaughter vs. Ultimate Warrior 7/10

Good match, but Sgt. Slaughter did not do any wrestling because Macho Man involved himself in the match almost the whole time. I REALLY got mad at the ending because Sgt. Slaughter becomes the new WWE Champion.

4. Ted Dibiase and Virgil vs. Dusty Rhodes and Dustin Rhodes (would later become Goldust) 8/10

Good tag team match. I was amazed by how good it was. The ending was great with Virgil leaving Ted Dibiase.

5. The Royal Rumble Match 10/10

The second best Royal Rumble match in history. There was a lot of action happening with the the ring always half full. This was The Undertaker's first Royal Rumble  and was doing well until he was eliminated by the Legion Of Doom (Hawk and Animal). Macho Man did not enter in the match, and Rick Martel set a record by being in the ring for like 52 minutes until he was eliminated by the British Bulldog. Hulk Hogan also cleared the ring (as always), and eliminated Earthquake to win it.",1106524800,,1358,4.392
7817034,4,6301910842,"This was, in my view, the best of all Royal Rumble tapes. The preliminary matches were good, the World title match saw a title change and reinaugurated a new era of Hulkamania by getting the belt off of the Warrior and onto Slaughter. The interviews were good.
This took place just days after the First Gulf War began. The tape begins with the national anthem and prominent red, white, and blue colors. The entire pageantry and presentation was excellent.
So why not five stars? Only because it could have been better early on. Make no mistake, it's worth it, but it's not quite a five-star. The Rumble itself, however, was one of the two best ever (the other being in 1992 for the title).
By the way, one person scheduled to appear did not make it to the Rumble. I won't spoil the ending for you; rent it and watch to find out. He was supposed to come out 18th so you must wait until the end. And then, you're sort of surprised still",1063843200,,934,4.373563218390805
7817035,5,6301910842,"""Royal Rumble 1991"" was a hell of a show. The card leading up to The Rumble match was a lot better put together than in previous years as we got a World Title match with champion Ultimate Warrior taking on Sgt. Slaughter. The backstory was that Slaughter had promised ""Macho King"" Randy Savage a title shot if he won. During the event, Savage's manager, Sherri tried to persuade Warrior into doing the same. Warrior refused and this resulted in Savage interfering in the match and allowing the anti-American Slaughter to win the belt. This would lead to the explosive ""Wrestlemania"" match between Hogan and Slaughter.
1991's ""Royal Rumble"" match was my favorite one. It featured the Immortal Hulk Hogan, The Undertaker, Earthquake, Smash & Crush of Demoltion, Jimmy ""Superfly"" Snuka, Shane Douglas, Saba Simba, and many others. This Rumble proved that it was indeed, ""every man for himself"" as Hogan and his ally, Tugboat did battle. It also featured the finale of the the feud between Hogan and Earthquake. This was classic WWF at its best.
The matches coming up to The Rumble were also pretty good as The Rockers took on The Orient Express in a great textbook tag team battle. The Big Bossman's feud with The Heenan Family continued as he faced The Barbarian. Dustin Rhodes made his WWF pay-per-view debut as he joined up with his father, Dusty as the father-son team took on ""Million Dollar Man"" Ted Dibiase and his bodyguard, Virgil. This match ended with the emotional moment where Virgil had finally had enough of Dibiase and took him out with the Million $ belt.
Another great thing about this Royal Rumble was it featured some excellent commentary with Gorilla Monsoon doing play-by-play while ""Rowdy"" Roddy Piper worked as the color man. Piper was very underrated as a broadcaster and he brought some humor to this show. While some may argue not having a heel in the booth hurts in the long run, there is no proof of it here.",1062288000,,1934,4.776119402985074
7817036,5,6301910842,This was one of the best Royal Rumbles. This is the first time I had seen PPV in miami.  I was 9 years old....the day of the ppv. It was just one of the coolest ppv's.,1027468800,,167,3.638888888888889
