5241118,5,B0091AUVRM,"If you have seen Alien, Aliens, Alien 3 or Alien Resurrection, Well, maybe you can go against the grain and just watch Prometheus first. But I wouldnt.",1401321600,3,151,4.62962962962963
5241119,5,B0091AUVRM,"Whats not to love?.......Ok, other than Alien resurrection? Lets face it that movie was an abortion.  However having the choice between the theatrical version and directors cuts of Alien and Aliens makes this box set worth all the while.  With Blu-Ray making everything pop just a bit more this is great for any die hard fan of the series. Hell yeah I'll admit that i liked Alien 3. Having all of the extra bonus features in these movies is pretty sweet too, I must say.",1401148800,12,470,4.517647058823529
5241120,5,B0091AUVRM,"The first thing I watched was the Making of Prometheus;  I spent hours watching the video footage and going thru the included image libraries and embedded optional content.  It was literally several hours covering every aspect of the creation of Prometheus from its concept thru final production.  The 4 original alien movies came in theatrical versions and subsequent special editions.

This is not 5 separate movies thrown together in a fancy case,  the entire set of movies are nicely tied together with an Alien ""MU-TH-UR""  themed movie control and content interface that seamlessly connects the 5 titles along with all featureless and extensive extras and image libraries.

This is a ""Must Have"" for any Alien enthusiast - I am surprised that I have not seen this marketed domestically.  It is a top quality product and it played in my inexpensive USA Sony Blu Ray player even though a warning on the product details page says it will not.

This appears to be an import from Ireland, all the content is in English and this the Fox logo is on the box - this is a prized addition to my collection.",1400284800,40,1100,4.747368421052632
5241121,5,B0091AUVRM,Very good set with all movies. The only one that has all the Alien movies and Prometheus. Very enjoyable compete set.,1390867200,5,117,4.619047619047619

5241123,4,B0091AUVRM,"Movies  and extras are great , PRICE WAS GREAT  ,  My problem with  the set is that  it  comes in a giant Blu-ray  storage case  that holds 8 discs  ,  and it came broken.",1383609600,15,171,3.764705882352941

5241128,5,B0091AUVRM,"Planned on buying Prometheus only but when I saw this inexpensive package of 5 movies I bought it right away. For the first four movies the package includes the Original Theatrical Release plus an Extended or Special Edition (directors cut for example). For ALIEN, Ridley Scott gives a brief introduction on why he wanted to update the film. I enjoyed all extended versions and plan to watch only them in the future. There are three more discs for EXTRAS, something I always appreciate for things such as Making of the Movie, and commentaries, etc.",1506297600,5,548,4.840425531914893
5241129,5,B0091AUVRM,Great price for the anthology. Alien ressurection is terrible though. It's a disappointing end to the saga,1504656000,,106,5.294117647058823

I loved it, highly recommended for super fans and movie collectors",1503705600,,78,5.0
5241131,3,B0091AUVRM,"Can we really classify Prometheus as an Alien Franchise movie? Really it was the worst of the bunch, and when did we finally see the alien? This will never be a collectors item. Stick with the blu-ray Alien Anthology box set. It will be worth something when you open it. this money grab here? I think not. Lets not forget the long history that Alien has with Predator? Seemingly their fight goes back as far as time itself, which does not quite jive with the lame humanitarian story that Prometheus is selling.",1502755200,,510,4.554347826086956
5241132,1,B0091AUVRM,"Overpriced and misrepresented by Amazon. Contrary to the notes on the item, there is no digital code for the Alien Anthology. Will never buy any movie other than Blu-Ray, because of misrepresentation.",1502668800,,200,5.28125

5241137,5,B0091AUVRM,I  nearly returned this DVD after seeing it was from Ireland - I am SO GLAD that I didn't! It is NOT region locked. You can play all the DVDs in the USA. We used our PS4 to play them. The quality was great and there were no issues whatsoever. That was my mistake thinking the DVDs wouldn't play in the USA,1498435200,6,305,3.9193548387096775

Horrible quality everything.
Not at all happy with my purchase.",1494460800,2,121,4.304347826086956
5241146,1,B0091AUVRM,"US (REGION 1) BUYER BEWARE:  This product is only region 2 although the description says all regions.  What does this mean?  It means that when you attempt to play any of the discs in this set, the disc either will not start, or will pause and skip halfway through viewing, which makes the set useless.

I contacted the buyer, and they just told me that they are in compliance with Amazon's policies and they will not give me a refund.  Shady.  Seems like too good of a deal and it is.  What a waste of $30!",1489104000,9,507,4.21875

I did watch two of the blue ray, and quality is exceptional. Watched on my very expensive HD Sony television, have to say WOW! great picture; watched on my inexpensive television just to make sure quality is in the blue ray, picture still looks really great. Each blue ray gave a message at beginning that my dvd needed a card, I bypassed this by hitting ""continue"" and it played without any issues.",1476403200,,569,4.643564356435643

5241170,5,B0091AUVRM,This set is a fantastic value. You're getting five movies and all the extras from the Alien Anthology set at 20 bucks. These are region free discs to boot. Don't bother with any other set or single discs if you're an Alien fan. The only downside is Prometheus still sucks.,1467590400,,272,4.46
5241171,5,B0091AUVRM,Its Great if you love Alien and don't even own any of the movies already. The Booklet is pretty neat but watch out it is paper slip covers so you can potential scratch up your discs.,1466035200,,182,4.083333333333333

5241199,5,B0091AUVRM,5 Stars!,1455235200,,8,3.5
5241200,5,B0091AUVRM,"Regularly 38 bucks, I picked the set up for merely $21.  For four Blu-ray discs, that's only $5.25 a pop.  That's magic in my book.  Being a very long time Alien(s) franchise lover, having the Alien(s) set plus Prometheus, including DVD and digital, when the math is all do be, this us practically a give away.

The set is fantastic from the standpoint of having everything available to the buyer.  Ridley Scott's classic is a thriller from the moment the disc loads up.  Should you have ""Screamorama"" (surround sound) or a sound bar, as with any Dolby 5.1 movie, the audio is worth the proverbial price of admission.",1454803200,,617,4.666666666666667
5241201,5,B0091AUVRM,"This is a very good deal! I bought this last month and it was at $21. I had to get it.

The quality of the packaging was nice. All the Alien films had their own disc inside a hard book-like box. The book is very nice as it has it's own art pertaining to each movie. You also have 2 more discs with extras.  Prometheus came in its own Blu-Ray box, but still came with the Alien Anthology.

This is the best gift for an Alien fan. 5/5 stars.",1454716800,,439,3.9101123595505616

5241204,5,B0091AUVRM,"I'd been waiting for the price of the 'Alien' quadrilogy package on Blu-ray to come down, but when Amazon also threw in 'Prometheus', all for $20.99, it was a no-brainer. Five movies on Blu-ray for 21 bucks? You got it. Plus the two extra discs of special features included in the quadrilogy, that comes to about three bucks apiece, for movies that I love (Prometheus has two discs, but the other is just another disc in regular DVD format so I don't count those). That's a bargain in my  book. I won't spend much time on the  technical aspects, sight, sound and feel (from the sub-woofer) are all state of the art, and its a beautiful thing to see Alien, especially, brought up to the director's original vision. All five of these are worth buying on their own, so this bundle made it  easy for me.",1454630400,,799,4.458904109589041

it is not anywhere in this description on this that the only Digital Copy is only for Prometheus.

One thing to note is that only the Prometheus comes with the Digital Copy code and as of Today (1/11/2016) I was able to claim it from iTunes ""DIRECTLY"". The word ""DIRECTLY"" is very important as I was going no where with the instructions written on the Inserts that contains the code. Their app. just kept on stating ""The code you entered is not valid for your region"". Seriously?? Fox get your app straight!! If you are to redeem it on iTunes, just go to ""Redeem Code"" on iTunes menu and type the redemption code directly. It will ask you to insert the Digital Copy disc. Once you insert the digital copy disc and quit the auto-playing DVD app. (that is if you are on Mac) then iTunes would display a new page where you type your redemption code once more. Now it would transfer movie from the disc and you would have Prometheus on your purchased movies' list on iTunes.",1452470400,,1033,4.470899470899471

I mainly wanted it for A nice box set to sit on the shelf and I have a case. Granted I needed the movies but the Alien Antholgy set will be more display worthy. All I have to say is if the box isn't included then they should state that.,1435622400,3,407,3.689655172413793

5241267,4,B0091AUVRM,"Fun movies if you look past how they've aged (which honestly only the first has aged poorly), however, the disc for Aliens skips at the very beginning and end of the movie. It's odd that only that one was effected despite the disc being fine.",1430870400,,242,4.4
5241268,5,B0091AUVRM,"I have to say I am a huge fan of the Alien franchise & this box set is amazing! All the movies look great. Spending the whole weekend going through everything and not stopping was epic.

I grew up in the 80's and the Alien movies are something I could not stop watching because I loved the lore behind them. When Prometheus came out I was at odds with it because it was confusing to tie to Alien but now I understand how it can work together with Alien.

I believe that in Alien that frist Engineer we see was the cause of everything going Worng in Prometheus, he could of not went along with wiping out humanity let the red become infected but in doing so was also infected and took the ship that we see in LV-426. The ""Space Jockey"" does not look like he died from a chest burster . He looks like he died like the others in Prometheus the ones you see with holes in their sleep pods.

I digress, this box set is really worth getting on Blu Ray. You will not regret getting it. It works great on my Xbox One and my home theater system. You won't be sorry you bought it trust an huge Alien fan.",1430784000,,1094,4.079069767441861

I have been a fan of Ridley Scott's work for years, and of Jodorowsky's Dune.  This set helped to bridge the connections so that I understood how Sci-Fi developed from B-Movie to blockbuster (post Star Wars) in the late 1970s.  It is interesting to see the theatrical release as well as the director's or special edition cuts, and note how studios manipulated director's efforts to produce what they believed would be a more profitable film.  I am eager to see if a sequel to Prometheus answers more questions than it generates.  Overall, an excellent collection of > 50 hours of video, all produced very well.",1425600000,,733,4.824

I've seen Alien probably 20 times and never noticed the scene where they cut one of the knuckles of the face-hugger and it's acid for blood spills on the deck. If you'll notice, the white deck is really Styrofoam and the acid is probably gasoline or hot oil. You can see the porous nature of your average coffee cup or ice chest. I always wondered how they did it. The picture in the disk is so clear that these little secrets are revealed.

This is the director's cut so a scene that wasn't in the theatrical release is in this one. It adds about 6 extra minutes to the film and kind of answers one of the mysteries of what happened to all of the crew of the Nostramo.

I got all of these films at a special price. I jumped on it when it was offered last Christmas. I'm glad I finally got all of them in BlueRay.",1422489600,12,881,4.146198830409356

I don't know about the rest of you, but I need subtitles (even though I am not deaf) to fully catch what the characters are talking about.  So, a major disappointment there considering these are blu-ray.  However, I must make a special mention to the EXCELLENT service that Amazon is providing!

5241362,4,B0091AUVRM,"I ordered this at the end of October 2014 from CGMovies and Games as it's an 'Item Under Review' currently from Amazon.

Described as Prometheus to Alien: The Evolution Box Set (9-Disc Set) [Blu-ray] including embossed horizontal box, t-shirt, poster, cards, etc.

What I got is the 8 disc blu-ray set in a small plastic blu-ray box. Inside the box is a small Alien Anthology guide and an unattatched plastic 4 leaf binder to hold the 8 discs. The physical object is not an impressive one and the loose binder holding the discs is a little shoddy.

You do not get any of the swag extras pictured in the above photos. The 9th disc you do not get is the Prometheus 3-D disc.

All that said I was not disappointed by the discs themselves. The price was reasonable for all the films and bonus materials which was the incentive for my purchase and I don't have a 3-D television so I didn't care about that disc anyway (although currently it is cheaper to buy the Prometheus Blu-Ray&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Prometheus-Blu-ray-DVD-Digital-Copy/dp/B005LAIHY0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Prometheus (Blu-ray/ DVD + Digital Copy)</a>&nbsp;and the Alien Anthology Blu-Ray set&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Alien-Anthology-Blu-ray/dp/B001AQO3QA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Alien Anthology [Blu-ray</a>] which includes everything in this set for a total of about $35 - and this set has already gone up $10 in the week since I ordered it) . All details about the discs themselves described above and in other reviews (other than the 3D Prometheus) are accurate and they are chock full of extras and docs and look stunning and played perfectly well in my rather old blu-ray player as well as my PS3.

Despite not getting all that swag pictured above (and paying an additional $15 - now $25 over buying them as 2 sets) I'm still quite happy with the purchase (though that embossed box would've looked cool on my shelf!); I was more interested in the films and the extras discs which are pretty amazing and will supply many many hours of enjoyment down the alien rabbit hole.

5241376,5,B0091AUVRM,"I saw Alien in theaters.  It was just a mind-blowing experience.  There was just nothing like it at the time, all cutting edge special effects, it was a rocket sled ride to... where nobody could hear you scream, the catchphrase of the film.

I built up my VHS collection, naturally adding Alien.  I was disappointed with the quality of VHS because I couldn't read the text messages from the computer and the narrative text was unreadable as well.  When Alien was released on DVD, I purchased the Trilogy, resisting the temptation to jump on Resurrection when it came out.  I waited a long while.

Then, Prometheus was released on Blu-ray, along with Resurrection.  I don't have a lot of Blu-ray films and have always been skeptical about how much additional clarity the studio would add.  Just because it's ""Blu"" doesn't mean it's ""better.""

I have to say I'm thrilled with this collection.  Watching the original Alien, I felt like I was viewing it on the silver screen once again.  To each segment was added an alternate director's cut.  Again, skeptical about viewing something contrary to what made the film great (search for ""Han Shot First"" and you'll know what I'm talking about)  The alternate cut of Alien added the missing cocoon scene while Alien 3 took on a whole new persona.  I thought it was wonderful as-is, but to see the original, longer cut, the tone of the movie is different, smoother action - it made more sense to me re-cut and we are treated to many previously cut scenes.

The DVD version was better than the VHS.  The Blu-ray version is just a must-own and far superior than the DVD quality.  Even if you've never seen the Alien saga, it's one of those films which, when its title is spoken it's done so with admiration.",1411776000,2,1746,4.650326797385621

The Bad: THere aren't individual cases for each movie ( only Prometheus ) - The Alien set is one of those Cardboard Box Sets that folds out and has selves- so if you want to take all the movies and put them into dedicated blu-ray cases, you will need a nice color printer and third party empty blue ray cases on hand.

The extended versions of the four alien movies really made the movies a lot better, it is too bad they had cut some of those scenes for the theater, but I guess back then the movies would be too long.  If you were a fan, then this bundle is a must, cause watching them with the cut scenes put back in, gives you a new feel for the movie.  Prometheus is the only one that didn't have a straight watch the movie with the cut scenes put back in.  To see the scenes you have to watch them separately, which I found was odd.

5241487,5,B0091AUVRM,"The Alien anthology is one of my favorite sci-fi horror franchises!

Alien manages to instill a very real feeling of dread through a simple technique that modern film makers could learn to remember: The monster is scariest when it is hinted at, our minds fill in the blank and make it oh so much worse than you can imagine!

Aliens was my go to movie as an adolescent, action and suspense in one neat little package. The special effects were groundbreaking at the time and are still pretty good by todays standards, not seen the Blu Ray version yet so maybe in HD they will not look as good.

Alien 3 was a strange old film, I'll be honest that whilst I enjoyed the film nothing really shouts out at me as the WOW moment of the film.  Well, aside from the end, they had set up a no-win situation and did not cop out at the last second and have a big happy ending like I was expecting.  The trilogy ended the only way it could...

Then along came resurrection... Diminishing returns had set in!  I have had this set on DVD and now on Blu Ray.  I have seen resurrection once in my life.  At the cinema when it came out.  Maybe I need to give it another chance... I'll get there I'm sure :)

Prometheus is a good solid Sci-Fi romp that claims that questions will be answered.  Personally I feel that these were the questions that no-one really cared about!  We find out a little more about the aliens that we saw in the opening of Alien but that was never really something that I cared overly about to be honest.  That said, Prometheus is a decent film and I am looking forward to watching it again.

The presentation of the anthology is truly lovely, a very rigid and beautiful cardboard book with inserts for the disks, it doesn't look like it will cause any issues with scratching the disks, always a good thing!  Prometheus is a standard Blu Ray disc case but it DOES come with the UV copy that the Anthology does not.

All in all a great little set and I was over the moon to get it for the ridiculously low price of $20!",1403568000,4,2023,4.2539267015706805
5241488,1,B0091AUVRM,I have no idea how great the quality of these productions are because they refuse to play in my Samsung Blue-ray player. From what I researched in trying to resolve this problem is that the films likely will not play on any player that was manufactured prior to 2013. Mine is a 2011 Samsung and nothing in this set works after the point of getting to the initial menus - no picture at all. The general reasons I have found have to do with the copy protection that Fox Studio uses and that older Blu-ray players are not current with this scheme. So now I am stuck with a set of otherwise awesome movies that I cannot return. DO NOT LET THIS HAPPEN TO YOU!,1403568000,5,654,4.24

5241493,5,B0091AUVRM,I've always loved the Alien movies (some better than others) but usually see them on regular broadcast television along with dozens of commercials.

This perfect package from Amazon has given me such a geek-thrill of perfect look and sound for all these films in various complete formats. A thrilling and welcome set for my collection!,1403136000,,401,5.0
5241494,4,B0091AUVRM,"First of all this is a great set. If you do not have the set already in other forms, this is a great one to own.  I won't go in to the specifics since many reviews already do. I will however discuss the packaging. Not the packaging from amazon (which was good) but the bundled portion. The liner notes sheet which is glued to the back of the cardboard case is horrible. The glue they used bled through the sheet and ruined it. the sheet is also very off center and on an angle, so part of it is folded over the edge where it should not be. That means that it causes issues when trying to take the booklet of discs out. There was also a scratch on the binding part of the case which holds the discs, despite being wrapped in plastic. All of the edges of the book which holds the discs are warn away partially and colored white. So I gave it 4 stars for the flawed packaging issues but looking at just the discs and compilation of movies, it would be a 5.",1402963200,2,953,4.069148936170213

Fantastic packaging of the Alien movies and Prometheus thrown in as a separate movie. The set was delivered on Sunday (Fathers Day) at no extra charge (score one for Amazon Prime!) and I watched the 1st Alien that day. The movie was so crisp and clear, the audio so good it was like watching it new all over again. I can't wait to go through the series again AND all the extra features!!
A good deal at $80, a STEAL at $20, if you're a fan, THIS is the collection to consider for your library.",1402876800,3,653,4.109375

5241498,5,B0091AUVRM,"Everybody knows how great ""Alien"" and ""Aliens"" are, but I have to say I enjoyed the others in the series as well. All of them are first class. I wouldn't trade  these Blu-rays for anything. ""Prometheus"" is a film I consider a modern classic, easily good enough to join the Alien series. But there's one thing--if you can, you should get the 3-D version of Prometheus. We and the kids and friends have watched it a number of times and enjoy being ""in"" the film more and more--safe and sound from the ravages of our ""creator"" and the aliens. We wish they would consider doing post-conversions on the Alien films, up-to-date post-conversion being excellent. All these films are must-haves, but 3-D raises them to a new level of enjoyment. Get a passive 3-D set and watch. Well worth it.

Love this package, especially at this special price.

5241499,5,B0091AUVRM,"This is a set that is just too sweet to pass up, especially for the low price of $19.99!! The Alien Anthology and Prometheus should be in everyone's Blu-ray collection. The Alien Anthology is, hands down, one of the absolute best box sets that I have in my Blu-ray collection!! Especially with 8 cuts of the four Alien films, as well as over 50 hours of special features!! And while I do have the Prometheus 4-disc Blu-ray 3D combo pack with an extra special features disc, this two disc combo pack that is being sold with this bundle contains a generous amount of special features as well, including deleted scenes.

5241500,5,B0091AUVRM,"I've had the Alien set since it came out and it took days to watch the films, first without and then with the commentaries, and go through most of the extras.  Even if you just dig one of the films (the first is my favorite), the feature length documentaries you get with each film are worth today's stupendously low price of twenty bucks.  The audio & video presentation is stunning. Even with each of the four films in the Alien set containing the original theatrical cut and an extended cut, the quality and massive amount of extras you get with each film are impressive.  The price makes this a no-brainer. Even though I've had this Alien set and Prometheus since they debuted on Blu, I'm getting two more for gifts.  I'm going to look like a rock star when they open the box.  Even for a guy like me who LOVES the first film, really likes the second, wants to like the third, understands he'll probably never like the fourth and has a tremendous love/hate relationship with Prometheus, it's a wonderful set that belongs on just about everyone's shelf.",1402617600,5,1056,4.5661375661375665
5241501,5,B0091AUVRM,"This blows my mind. I've been wanting and waiting to replace my old, worn out DVDs (three without proper covers) for a long time now, and when I saw the entire set, director's edition of Alien, special editions, plus Prometheus all on Blu-ray for a measly $20 I was instantly sold! Unless you've got a better set (I'm not sure a better set exists), you'd be crazy not to pick this up while you've got the chance.",1402617600,4,412,4.363636363636363
5241502,5,B0091AUVRM,"If you even have even a passing interest in this series, you'd be crazy not to pick up this set while it's on sale. I've spent $75 on these two items separately and it was still worth it to me. Alien is a masterpiece. Aliens is the best way to follow it up. Say what you want about Alien 3, yeah it's a total buzz kill coming off of Aliens but it's still an incredible film. David Fincher perfectly captures Ripley's worst nightmare. Alien Resurrection gets called the worst of the series, but considering the caliber of this series, it's still a fun and enjoyable movie. I'd call Prometheus the weakest of this set, but again, still enjoyable, and a visual delight. The extras on this set are better than any other set I've seen. You've shown some interest in this set by making it all the way to this part of my review, while browsing the review section of this product. Do yourself or a friend a favor and get it already.",1402617600,7,924,4.3468208092485545
5241503,2,B0091AUVRM,"I have seen all of Alien and Predator. Both are fun to watch. I don't have any bluray for any from this series. I would love to have all of Predator and Alien in one package, and I will call it a super bundle :}, this bundle is available On DVD ""Alien - Predator Total Destruction Collection"". Till that time, this bundle is strictly Ok to buy for a deal price (it was available for 19$ for a limited time), but it is not going to complete your collection.
I also recommend to have digital copy with this bundle.

Now let's see what it offers. It offers a Alien Anthology + Prometheus bluray. In fact it is just a bundle created to sell some remaining stock of old anthology, most of like there was one Wolverine trilogy with 4th Wolverine movie bundle.. Which is now no longer exists because now 7th Wolverine came recently.

Now I tell which one is better Alien bundle (till a new Prometheus II doesn't release). Search on amazon for """"Prometheus to Alien: Evolution"""" which is with better artwork and almost half price 5 movie set.

Now there were negative comments on my review when I said ""I will call Alien + Predator"" a super bundle. I was told there is no relation between both, :) funny, I think they should go ahead and read this ""[...]"". Alien and Predator are crossover series and it is definitely and equally entertaining. Off-course nothing can match with original Alien, Alien and Predator... but movies are for entertainment, and all these movies provided that. I am waiting for this super bundle with a great price so that I can enjoy these entertaining moments once again...

Happy watching...

I also recommend to Amazon that people should rate a product based on its use and not based on other factor such as special price for a day. Now if I go through all other review who rated this bundle as 5 star, are mentioning a special price... today as I am writing this review price is 80$, now will you pay 80$ for this bundle, answer is no. But I am not complaining about the price. My review is simple, this product is a bundle and a better product with a better price is available. So this product does not deserve 5 star rating anymore.",1402617600,3,2156,4.461928934010152
5241504,5,B0091AUVRM,"This set is incredible. You are getting a huge value.

Prometheus
Full length feature with bonus content.
Released Oct 9th
2-disc set Blu-Ray/DVD/Digital Copy

 The films themselves are presented in both their theatrical versions and extended ""special edition"" versions, Even Alien3 comes in a half-hour longer version. They even decided to  re-record bits of dialog and sound effects to enhance the audio from the restored portion to match the rest of the film. While having these discs you have the choice to watch either version. Very often movies label directors cut and it only equals a few extra scenes. Here, you can see an entirely different tone to the movies, especially with 'AlienS'

Sound

Each film gets the DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 treatment. Alien and Aliens theatrical cuts are also available in Dolby Digital 2.0 and 4.1 channel mixes.

I am not an audiophile but I have to say that the sound isn't as amazing as I would have originally hoped. This just might be the original films I'm talking about. I don't think there is anything wrong with the transfer of the earlier films I just expected to be completely blown away and I wasn't.

Video Quality

I have been watching these movies since they were on VHS. This is by far the most impressive set I have ever seen. The picture quality definitely beats the Alien Quadrilogy DVD set. The biggest difference with the five movies is definitely seen with Alien and Aliens, due to their age and room for improvement.

Small Cons

One con for the Alien Anthology portion of this set is that the discs rest in paper slipcovers. These seem
Flimsy and definitely look like they will tear. It is also hard to feel that they are protecting the underside of the discs which can move and spin a bit.

Prometheus

The Blu-ray for Prometheus is included here as well.

Included is the two disc version that includes DVD/Blu-Ray/digital version.

Since this disc is a recent release there isn't anything changing here. The picture is beautiful and the sound is amazing. There is also enough extra content to keep you engaged.

Overall

This is a fantastic package. It is amazing to get five movies for such a low price. One thing to note though is that these discs are generally at a lower price point right now. You can get Prometheus brand new for 5 dollars and the Alien Anthology is around 25 dollars.

If you are a fan of the series and you don't already own these then this is the time. This is a very nice amazon package that can save you some money.

I doubt you will regret purchasing this fantastic package.",1402617600,117,3388,4.889667250437828
