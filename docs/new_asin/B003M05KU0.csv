4154189,5,B003M05KU0,"Leelee Sobieski is one of my favorite actresses, very easy on the eyes.  Leelee you broke my heart when you got engaged!!!!  Seriously however, Leelee has gravitated toward the Indie films of late & I expected this to be a quirky comedy.  But to my surprise I found this to be a heartwarmingly film about following your dreams.  Much better than I expected.",1296691200,2,357,4.619047619047619
4154190,4,B003M05KU0,"I heard of FINDING BLISS after hearing a Q&A on the creative screenwriting podcast and was interested enough to import it.
Often I import indie movies and they really disappoint - but this film I really enjoyed. There are slight problems, but I know from hearing the Q&A this was down to budget/time limitations, and anyway they are small niggles. If this had been written by and directed by a man there'd be an outcry against it - but written and directed by a woman? I thought it was pretty fresh, brave and funny, and it's a shame it didn't get a bigger audience.",1293580800,11,566,4.451923076923077
4154191,4,B003M05KU0,"Lee Lee Sobieski is one of my favorite actors, and it's a pity she hasn't had more commercial success with her films. Many of her films are indies and I'm amazed by her ability to play various sorts of characters as evidenced by her work in movies like ""Eyes Wide Shut"", ""Uprising"", ""The Glass House"", etc. Here, Sobieski plays Jody Balaban, a fresh graduate from NYU's Film School who shows promise but finds that talent and enthusiasm do not necessarily translate into instant success.

Frustrated by her inability to attract prominent studios' attention, Jody eventually lands a job at Grind Studios, which is in the business of making porn flicks. Jody is initially disgusted by her job, which entails editing porn movies, and is also haunted by her history of failed relationships. Jody's character is one who suffers from sexual hang-ups and thinks she is a ""lousy lay"". When she meets fellow NYU alum and high achiever Jeff Drake (Matt Davis), she is shocked to find he's become an adult film director, albeit a successful one. There is some sexual tension between the two which gets developed over the course of the movie, and I thought it was credibly done. The strong chemistry between the lead actors also helps advance the romance sub-plot.

I felt this was a nicely done independent movie with the right elements, i.e. an engaging and interesting plot, funny dialogue, and great casting. Oh, and watch out for Denise Richards in this one - she was quite a surprise! The other cast members, especially those that played the roles of adult film actors were also believable - they portrayed their roles with credibility instead of coming off as caricatures. This is an honestly funny movie that deserves a wider audience.",1282780800,20,1731,4.884353741496598
4154192,5,B003M05KU0,"This film hit it out of the park on so many levels! The story is amazing, deep, touching, laugh out loud funny and yes sexy. The writing was the most original I have seen in years! Really good stuff. The acting was really solid throughout great performances by all. I love that I bought this film because I can show it to all my friends male and female will both love this film. It is really a lot of fun to watch!",1282435200,10,414,4.060975609756097
4154193,3,B003M05KU0,"This was quite a surprise. I thought it was going to be decent but it turned out even a bit better than that.

Leelee Sobieski plays a film school grad who can't get arrested in Hollywood. She ends up taking a job as editor with an adult film company figuring she can use their facilities and gear to shoot her own script after hours. As she's afraid of sex ( or afraid she'll suck at it) the set up is a bit obvious. But what surprised me was the quality of the script. Given the set-up, much of the story was paint by numbers, but the dialogue for much of the film was more clever and funnier than you'd find in much higher budget outings. Some of the characters were written very well. Unfortunately, some of the story is simple minded and you really don't buy it, but the parts that are good are so good they help carry the weak stuff.

Another thing that got me was how well they depicted what goes on during a shoot and in post production. The script writer knows his way around and gave a decent feel for what actually happens during editing, sound editing, scheduling etc. The budget is not very high, with the proceedings being limited to a few sets. Some of the lensing though was better than I expected. Some of the shots were genuinely good.

The cast had a few surprises. Leelee Sobieski has been in her share of movies and seeing Denise Richards is always a treat. But many of the other characters do a better than average job.

This is no great movie by any means but there is enough going on here to keep most movie goers entertained. I gave it 3 stars, but 3 1/2 is not at all out of the question.",1281312000,,1614,4.23051948051948

4154199,1,B003M05KU0,"This flick surely reflect on our society where zero imagination considered a plus, politically correct speech and action dominate and mainstream became mainsteam. If I actually try to say about this movie what I think it will be my last review. The movie not even trying anything except showing zero imagination and I guess nobody heard word benchmark in movie's colleges. In addition though movie supposedly done in porn industry we don't see anything and I mean anything. If you into porn I recommend consider some of John Leslie flicks or Brigitte Lahaie. But this one--avoid as plague.",1365552000,,589,5.020408163265306
4154200,5,B003M05KU0,This is a great movie I liked this movie and I watched it about 4 times already so I don't mind saying so,1363305600,2,105,3.608695652173913
4154201,4,B003M05KU0,"This is a romantic comedy that uses the pron industry as a background so guys will watch it. It is less erotic than what one would expect. There are only a few brief nude scenes and none with the major stars. The adult aspect is the crude porn language and simulated sex scenes.

Leelee Sobieski stars a Jody, a naive near-virginal woman with her own sexual hang-ups. She ends up editing adult videos for director Jeff Drake (Matt Davis) who wants to show adult movies in main stream art theaters. He utilizes Jody's perspective for editing and writing. He is also an alumni from the same film academy. Jody has her own script, which is perhaps too autobiographical, about a girl who wants to wait for sex. She uses the studio...and their actors to make the film. It seems every porno star wants to be a legitimatize actor and would do anything for the opportunity.

The movie was mildly funny. The humor was front loaded as naive Jody discovers the porno industry and learns its terminology. I may never use an ATM again.  Kristen Johnston was a treat in her brash role as usual, Jamie Kennedy was a flop, and Mircea Monroe is always pleasing eye candy.

F-bomb, sex, nudity including full frontal male (Jamie Kennedy or body double).",1336348800,3,1235,4.6255707762557075
4154202,3,B003M05KU0,"Leelee Sobieski is a would-be filmmaker who can't get funding to make her dream script, but (though the usual contrived situations) gets a job editing porn movies and then...you can pretty much work out every plot beat from there. It follows its formula with energy and really believes in itself, but it will never surprise you.",1303516800,,328,4.875
4154203,4,B003M05KU0,"Others have covered the plotline quite well, so I'll just say that I saw this in its brief theatrical run and thoroughly enjoyed it.  That said, I would be particular as to whom I would recommend it.  Set in the porn industry, it's certainly not for the conversative viewer or those who are uncomfortable with the subject of sex, dealt with in an adult and fairly explicit way.  Nice performances by some of my favorite actors, although I wish the likeable Jamie Kennedy's character was less moronic, to the point where he seems borderline mentally disabled.",1302652800,3,558,4.791666666666667

8399934,4,B003M05KU0,"If Hallmark Channel, Disney Family or someone similar decided to make a movie that took place in the adult film industry, it would likely resemble this quirky charming indie.
The adult film biz is an interesting setting for an otherwise conventional coming of age film. I don't mean conventional as a slam. The story isn't boring, but it's familiar enough that the ...unique elements... are grounded in a comfortable narrative. The adult film setting proves a good metaphor for breaking out of other self imposed preconceptions. All the characters are treated respectfully, and though Jamie Kennedy's character is rather cartoonish, I think we've all met at least one person who was a bit like a friendly yellow lab trapped in a human body. :) Even that character is treated with respect.
  This may never make anyone's top 100 list, but it's a fun little film with a fresh twist in the premise. It's unique, and a fun watch. Thanks to the cast & crew for taking a clever idea and producing this quirky little gem.
  I'm so glad I stumbled across this.",1475452800,2,1052,4.763736263736264
