6872365,1,B00QJAZ4T2,"""Robot Revolution"" ranks as an abominable sci-fi thriller that has an interesting premise but suffers from pedestrian production values and amateur acting. In the near future, a blond Mobile Infantry Police woman, Constable Hawkins (Virginia Logan), with her anonymous android partner prowl a New Jersey apartment block to arrest notorious terrorist Damien Roth. They fail to find Roth. Instead, they locate a diminutive, bespectacled nerd of a woman who has concocted a lethal weapon that features nanobots. Vaguely, ""Prometheus Trap"" director Andew Bellware and ""Boom Boom Dolls"" scenarist Steve J. Niles draw on Michael Crichton's bestseller ""Prey"" and the big screen flop ""Dredd."" These two frequent sci-fi collaborators must be rabid fans of John Carpenter because ""Robot Revolution"" contains most of the earmarks of an early Carpenter classic. This 84-minute sci-fi film takes place in a contemporary society with next to no futuristic equipment. The most impressive example is a monstrous robot cleaner that resembles a gigantic insect, not a very practical robot but an atmospheric addition. Our plucky heroine recalls Snake Plissken with her black eye patch and outfit. Did I mention she totes a mighty big pistol? Bellware confines the action to one apartment building with endless roving exterior shots of the edifice. The nanobots infiltrate all the machinery, and eventually infect most of the humans in the apartment block. The infected humans behave like zombies; they bleed from the mouth and the nostrils, but they don't bleed enough to be remotely disgusting. One of the most irritating things about ""Robot Revolution"" is the horrible cinematography. Even when no machines are present, such as when we are shown the building exteriors, everything appears botched, with horizontal lines streaking the picture, as if there was something affecting the equipment. This lackluster movie boasts minimal surprises, and its bare-bones budget and lack of invention hampers it. Nothing about any of the characters make them sympathetic or antagonistic.  In other words, you don't have reason to root for the heroine or hate the villains.  The widescreen compositions aren't bad, but the characters are nothing memorable, especially the robot. As usual, there a lot of exposition, but most of it is incoherent. Only die-hard sci-fi fans may salvage something from this nonsense. If you're looking for a gory, shoot'em up saga with lots of profanity and nudity, you will definitely be disappointed by this one.",1428710400,,2516,5.399491094147582
6872366,4,B00QJAZ4T2,"This is an independent sci-fi film that is really quite interesting and very original. That is why I like independent movies. Sure, you do not have a big budget, so don't expect Michael Bay action scenes (and please stop giving movies one star because of that). But that's what I like, because it forces the film makers to be creative. This one had that for me, with some fun mixes of things like zombies, government conspiracies, technology dependence, and our need for friendship/companionship all themes touched upon in unique ways. Cool robots and weapons, but a story about humans which was filmed from an interesting perspective of the robot most of the time. I think it's worth a watch for something different if you like sci-fi.",1428105600,,736,4.849206349206349
6872367,1,B00QJAZ4T2,"This was a very poorly made and cheap movie.  I fast forward through the movie, sorry I purchased it.",1427068800,2,101,4.315789473684211
6872368,2,B00QJAZ4T2,"The film drops you into the future in a controlled society due to outbreaks of war and terrorism using nanobots. In this case it is best to read the DVD cover prior to watching the film so as to understand some of the background. People have an ID chip implanted in their heads at age 16 making it easy for one-eyed Constable  Hawkings (Virginia Logan) to identify them with a small scanner. Hawkings works with a robot/android named Argos or Argis. About half of the film is what our robot sees, giving it a modified hand held camera feel, one that has numbers and tiny print off to the corner so we know it's him.

Our law enforcers enter a high rise apartment building constructed of white painted cinder blocks and sparse furnishings. The movie takes place inside this New Jersey building.

The script used the modern terrorist aspect to mimic their terrorist group as being peaceful Osirans (and Horus) but in reality are making nanobombs in an uncontrolled environment/workshop. There didn't seem to be a message or theme to the madness, possibly because the story was poorly developed.

Hawkings looks interesting for a ""Mobile Infantry Police"" sporting standard issue clothes that reveal her midriff, but don't expect anything more. Her character was less developed than her uniform. We do get to meet some mildly interesting characters on the way into the building, but they never took advantage of them, rather turning them into ""flesh puppets"" i.e. zombie types.

The film wasn't half bad up onto the point they had 7 people in a room basically doing nothing for a far too long period of time. After this the film lost me as far as entertainment value and continued on a downward slide.

This is a somewhat low budget film, that used some decent effects, including a cleaner robot that didn't seem to be CG. The shooting was framed well, the sound was good, I never saw a microphone.

For those who like low budget android movies filmed in Jersey City, NJ there is also ""Battledroid""in case you thought this was the worse android film from New Jersey.

6872369,1,B00QJAZ4T2,"I have seen quite a few bad movies in my lifetime but this one is without a doubt the worst movie ever produced.  I don't know what the writers, producers and directors were trying to accomplish but they failed on a grand scale.  Do not buy this movie.  If you do it may allow them to make another one.  Heaven forbid.",1426204800,3,318,4.163934426229508
6872370,1,B00QJAZ4T2,"In short,I can not think of one level upon which this floater did not suck. Many times you will get a movie where the acting is so sub-crap,but the FX will compensate,In this case,it was like a race to see who could suck worst.",1426118400,4,227,4.181818181818182

6872372,1,B00QJAZ4T2,"Worst movie ever.  So bad! So Very Bad that it made you laugh at just how bad it was.  Both my sons were raging at the crappy abstract storyline.  Scene pans of city every few minutes.  Looking out the poorly crafted eyepiece of a robot.  Graphics were very bad.  Movie was very bad.  Acting was very, very bad.  Made me laugh, because it was so poorly directed, crafted, written, acted.  Wondered if someone's first attempt at an independent movie.  You know those oriental movies where the words and the mouths don't actually sync up - well those type of movies are superior to this one!  If you purchase it, don't say I didn't warn you!",1425945600,7,639,4.469565217391304
