8226441,5,B000X1FDA8,"I enjoyed this movie because it showed what the actual family had gone through with this sudden change of personality in the husband/dad. David James Elliotte brought out the excellence of his acting by keeping the focus of the character that he was given to act. His acting also brought out the real ""nightmare"" for the family who had to go through the struggles to predict and understand one of their family members. Yet, the kids and mother never gave up on their loved one  - husband/dad. Very touching.",1317081600,3,507,4.696629213483146
