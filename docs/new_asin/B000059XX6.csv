7934249,5,B000059XX6,"Based upon a couple of short stories (""Anacleto Morones"" and ""Comala"" published in ""El Llano en Llamas"")of the celebrated Mexican writer Juan Rulfo, ""El Rinc&oacute;n de las V&iacute;rgenes"" (not ""ricon"") shows one of the last works of Emilio ""El Indio"" Fern&aacute;ndez, one of the top Mexican movie directors of all times, who plays the role of Anacleto Morones. The work of Fern&aacute;ndez is truly a remarkable one as well as the one performed by Alfonso Arau as Lucas Lucatero, his assistant. Needless to mention Carmen Salinas, Pancho C&oacute;rdoba and most of the actors and actresses that play in the movie, that shows how use to be the life in little towns of central Mexico, and the religious fervour and believing needs of some of the inhabitants. For those interested in Rulfo's literary work transplanted to the screen this is a must see; you really will enjoy it very much.  Also those interested in female beauty, will enjoy very much the appearence of Rosalba Brambila as the young ""daughter"" of the self-called ""Saint"" (Anacleto), particularly in the underwater shots. Definitly: five stars.",994032000,2,1110,5.132596685082873
