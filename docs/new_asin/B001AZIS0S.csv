3476396,4,B001AZIS0S,"Personally I can't stand Dora but my 4 year old niece loves her. So, if she's entertained (and quiet) when this is on I'm happy.

3476399,3,B001AZIS0S,"The main reason my daughter was so excited about this movie was because of the pegasus shown on the front cover.  She's so into horses and if they fly or have a horn...even better.  Well, guess what...NO Pegasus in this movie!  She kept asking where it was and when the movie was ending and still no pegasus...the tears came (she is a dramatic 4 yr old, but I was even disappointed for her).  As it turns out, the pegasus is only in the ""Special Features"" section as a music video which is about 3 minutes long.  What a disappointment.  As it turns out she still enjoys the movie (it also comes with 2 other episodes: Dora's Jack-In-The-Box and Bark, Bark To Play Park), but I make sure we watch the music video a couple times before I turn it off.  She's accepted it now, but still I wish I would have known before her Grandma bought her this movie.",1224979200,19,850,4.3081761006289305
