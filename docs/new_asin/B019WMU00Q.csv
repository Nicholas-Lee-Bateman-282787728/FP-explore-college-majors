7586411,5,B019WMU00Q,Very touching film made by the British when they arrived at the Holocaust Camps.,1461456000,10,80,4.785714285714286
7586412,5,B019WMU00Q,"This movie was chilling.  Very factual; I think that's what was the most frightening was that this is a DOCUMENTARY. All the Holocaust deniers should watch this.  You read about the concentration camps, but this really brings to life the heinous, callous disregard for human life.",1460332800,9,280,5.065217391304348
7586413,2,B019WMU00Q,This is a prime example of everyone has their own taste in movies. I didn't like this one. I know the story already. I've seen all the news reels already. If you didn't pay attention in school then go ahead and rent it. Other wise don't waste your time,1455408000,4,252,4.163265306122449
7586453,5,B019WMU00Q,Well documented...amazing how inhumane the human race can be.,1484784000,,61,5.888888888888889
7586454,5,B019WMU00Q,"Chilling documentary on man's inhumanity to man. While jewish prisoners were being tortured and killed, non caring Germans were a stones throw away partying, vacationing and enjoying life. Difficult to watch, but important to see. American and British soldiers liberating concentration camps and leading a humongous effort to bury thousands upon thousands of unnamed victims into mass graves, while lining up the German people to walk through and witness this horror so nobody could ever deny it actually happened.",1484352000,8,514,5.518987341772152
7586455,5,B019WMU00Q,"Really hard to watch but worthwhile considering the historical context of the program. It was devastatating to see the destruction of all those human lives. Particularly moving was when they entered a warehouse in Dauchu that contained mounds and mounds and piles upon piles of human hair, teeth, shoes, clothing. It was very impactful. This is nothing I would allow anyone to see younger than a very mature fifteen or sixteen.",1483920000,9,427,5.028169014084507
7586456,4,B019WMU00Q,"Well produced with lots of unique footage. It takes a different angle by focusing on the development of a documentary. Just wish they showed more, and continuous, segments from the documentary so that one could get a better feel for the product they were talking about.",1483920000,,269,4.869565217391305
7586457,5,B019WMU00Q,Intense footage of the aftermath of WWII. It is very graphic yet educational.,1483488000,,77,5.0
7586458,3,B019WMU00Q,I give it 3 Stars cuz I don't remember watching the f****** thing maybe I was drunk or something,1482883200,,96,4.105263157894737
7586459,5,B019WMU00Q,I knew a woman that survived the camps. This was absolutely horrifying. The things we fight for make sense...even though war does not make sense. Sometimes maybe....killing for the better of mankind is what needs to happen,1482624000,,222,5.027027027027027
7586460,5,B019WMU00Q,"The truth, the reality is not polite. The truth makes many dig desperately for lies, falsehoods, deceptions, and manipulations in order to protect their world of illusions. That anyone could doubt the Holocaust makes me wonder what mental weakness or sickness would cause such a fatal error. That anyone would allow for that pretended excuse should make the basic human fearful and angry. Regardless of race or creed, we owe one another the freedom, dignity and respect of saying, ""This is evil !""  This happened! See this reality and beware! This is your history and belongs in your Bible. To mislead one another is a great wrong.
WWI was an open sore on the body of a world exhausted with war. Regular men an women wanted to live daily lives of community, freedom and peace INSTEAD of an unwanted sentence of deprivation, suffering and eventual death on a battlefield just to prevent ""enslavement"" by another race, creed or nation. A delusional but amazing man named Adolf Hitler led the humiliated and punished Germany back to war and not just war but some demonic acting-out of hell-on-earth for those they played ultimate deity for.
A fine documentary: Night Will Fall.
Now for today's warning. Many people do not want to see films of the Holocaust or even think about it. Many people do not want conflict and America only joined the World Wars completely when ""it had no option"". We can't afford to be polite in deathly wrong situations. Know that people are playing deadly games with important and sacred issues. Racism, sexism, and unfounded hatreds are not toys for politicians. I don't have time to waste here. Democrats have been misleading us for TOO LONG. Better clean it up before it's too late. Sexual confusion is not a skin color and can't be confused with racism or bigotry. Men and women are different and can't be equal. They must both have respect and love. Democrats have been talking more about skin color than anybody else, and for them it's really some kind of SKIN GAME. They give not one damn about anybody but their self. I can't make a dime here telling the truth. It just seems a waste to let the knowledge and truth of our past and sufferings to be for nothing. Let's not be doomed to repeat the garbage of human weakness and evil.",1482105600,2,2262,4.697732997481109

7586472,4,B019WMU00Q,"Very good but not as good as the original ""A Painful Reminder"".  I have it on VHS but I'll never understand why channels like A&E, History Channel, HBO, Discovery, etc. don't produce many older films on DVDs.  There has to be a way to satisfy copyright laws.....so many great films that people should see....it's a shame!  This film should be seen in every school in the USA.",1477353600,5,375,4.567164179104478

7586475,1,B019WMU00Q,"The disk is defective.  It plays halfway and freezes.  I tried twice to fast forward, but it advances a bit then returns to the starting point.  I am very disappointed.",1470873600,,168,4.533333333333333
7586476,5,B019WMU00Q,"If you get off on torture porn like ""The Green Inferno"" by filmmaker Eli Roth, this disturbing movie might cure you of the affliction, because ""Nights"" raw footage of dead, dying, or decomposing concentration-camp victims is a reminder that gore and brutality aren't just the province of Hollywood special-effects wizards. Ostensibly, this film is about an unreleased documentary briefly overseen by Alfred Hitchcock in 1945, but what lingers is the horror of Nazi Germany.

7586477,3,B019WMU00Q,"Confusing and sad.  There needed to be a heavier fiber used with this information.  There needed to be a greater importance added to the fact that, such ignorance does not go lightly as much as history would like to repeat itself in darker and more evil ways there must be a deeper ray of hope spread.",1470528000,,301,4.357142857142857

7586481,5,B019WMU00Q,"A must see, especially theses days untruths prevail. Generations of those under 50 years of age need to know what inhumane card took place against a whole race of people....not so different than what is and could happen again. Thank you forsaking this important film available.",1465862400,3,277,5.043478260869565

8746221,5,B019WMU00Q,Unique and very impactful treatment of both the Holocaust and documentary filmmaking. Explains the how's and why's of why you haven't seen it before. This treatment is open to showing brutality that is suppressed even in 21st century media.,1519171200,,240,5.17948717948718

8746224,5,B019WMU00Q,"Informative & educational documentary film.  It was all so horrible...I remember learning all about it as a child in the 50's & 60's.  That kind of evil is difficult to endure watching, & it is about as real & tragic as it gets.  jlp",1497484800,,233,4.25

8746226,5,B019WMU00Q,"A heart wrenching documentary of the horrific war atrocity that was the mindless, robotic, attempted extermination of an entire race. The footage is graphic and of exquisite quality. Though difficult to watch, it is compulsory viewing to remind those who would doubt the savage potential of the human being - in this case - the nazi.",1494806400,3,333,4.964285714285714
8746227,5,B019WMU00Q,"Even after years of amateur scholarship on the Holocaust, I was stunned by the footage and the story of this unreleased documentary. Kudos to the Imperial War Museum for preserving this precious document. You will want to look away, but you won't be able to do so. The cynical decision by the former Allies to shelve this documentary is appalling, and a valuable lesson in looking past the surface of political pronouncements.",1494460800,3,426,4.930555555555555
8746228,5,B019WMU00Q,"For some strange reason, this documentary has received very little coverage in the media. It is unbelievable that something so important is being ignored, forgotten, and denied.",1491609600,3,177,5.592592592592593
