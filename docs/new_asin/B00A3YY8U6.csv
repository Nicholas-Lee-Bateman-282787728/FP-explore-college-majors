5381469,5,B00A3YY8U6,"I've been trying to play bass guitar for years now, I've spent money on too many so-called learn to play bass guitar video's. Those other video's were confusing and boring to say the least about them.
 But thank goodness for Fibar, I've learned to play my bass guitar using Finbar's techniques , Finbars way of teaching is the best I've seen, He makes playing bass fun and his techniques are straight to the point.
 If your serious about learning to play a bass guitar these DVD's are a must.",1355788800,6,492,4.51685393258427
5381470,5,B00A3YY8U6,"Fin Bar is a great instructor, the lessons are broken down so that it is easy to learn
I would recommend this to anyone just starting out, these disc will give you a huge head start.",1380153600,,182,4.083333333333333
5381471,5,B00A3YY8U6,Thanks for the free lesson I love to learn some more .. just get the Epic Beginner Bass Mastery 5 DVD Course I recommend this ...,1379548800,,129,4.0
5381472,5,B00A3YY8U6,"I have no music education and zero bass experience. Moreover, I really don't want to go to a teacher or take a course. Those videos did the most important job - get me through the initial phase.

I've started by watching a lot of learning guides on YouTube and was not quite satisfied. Some people fail to distinctly show what to do, which is probably okay for folks who have some experience. Some have poor quality. Some just talk to much.

Then I came across Finbar. I liked how clearly he explained things. Everything is described and shown step by step, so I understood everything. And the best part - I was actually able to play something from the start. It was primitive, but still it was music.

What I did not like is that I had to order the course in DVD. I don't even have a DVD slot in my PC and it's next to impossible to seek on something like PS3. Had to convert it to a more versatile format.",1376956800,3,907,4.23121387283237
5381473,5,B00A3YY8U6,"Finbar is a fun and an excellent teacher.

This was easy to get through and very easy to understand.

Highly recommended for any newbie bassists like me!",1374451200,2,153,4.62962962962963
5381474,5,B00A3YY8U6,"Epic Beginner is the very best bass course that I know! Thank you very much, I have no further comments :-)",1371772800,2,107,4.142857142857143
5381475,5,B00A3YY8U6,"The teacher is very good , and he can communicate very well. The topics were very well selected. I wish the author can publish more contents for next level.",1369094400,2,156,4.413793103448276
5381476,5,B00A3YY8U6,"I've been playing bass guitar for about 13 years now, having played in rock & metal bands as well as with church music teams constantly throughout. In that time, I've never had formal training but rather picked up habits--good and bad--from fellow musicians, relatives, and watching favorite bassists like Geezer Butler, Phil Lynott, and Steve Harris.

While I'd honestly consider myself a decent bassist who can play several styles with competence, I probably learned as much over these last few weeks digesting the Next Level beginner bass set as I had in the decade prior, both in playing technique and hard knowledge of the instrument itself. I added new skills to my repertoire as well as improved stuff I didn't even know I was doing poorly! Some YouTube videos do a nice job of teaching certain songs or instructing in a particular technique or style, but I have never come across such a comprehensive instructional set before. There are a few aspects that help this series excel at teaching bass:

Content -- While I of course expect any DVD set to go over basics such as hammer-ons, pull-offs, and plucking, I wasn't expecting such extensive coverage of bass maintenance and tweaking. That and other areas I've been neglecting as a musician, and it was very helpful to learn so much about the inner workings of my guitar.

Style -- The teacher Finbar is extremely easy to understand and makes sure the viewer comprehends the material fully before moving on to a new concept. In addition, he builds on concepts slowly and often provides brief recaps on terminology in case the viewer's forgotten since it was last mentioned.

Editing -- The quality of the video editing, while basic, helps augment the material and eliminate confusion. Throughout the videos, relevant tablature or captions are overlaid the picture so you won't have to pause the movie to look up a reference or refer back to something earlier. Closeups and dynamic zooming give a good overview of what the instructor is doing while making sure we have enough detail to follow along on our own basses. The audio is also very clear (sounds like the bass audio has been fed straight through to the feed and adjusted for great sound, no crummy webcam audio here).

At my moderate level of skill, some of the material did amount to a review, but it's such a good reminder for any bassist. As someone who has taught others to play the greatest modern instrument, I really appreciate the clarity and depth of the instruction on offer here, and I anticipate using these discs extensively with future students. Beginners and even mid-level players can't really go astray with this set.",1365206400,10,2651,4.856194690265487
5381477,5,B00A3YY8U6,"I have tried to learn by myself before by going through those ""Teach Yourself Bass"" books that can be picked up at music stores. But these don't hold a candle to Finbar's bass lessons. Finbar does a great job of breaking down each subject and getting to the meat of the issue. With his easy and straight forward lessons learning to play the bass is really easy. I especially liked the exercises that he gives to help learn or practise the technique hes just explained. As for the lessons they go from explaining the parts of a bass onward meaning anyone can learn from these even if you only got your bass yesterday and have no clue whats happening. They have really improved my bass playing as a whole just by learning some of the simple things such as muting the strings or the vibrato to give a bit more character to my playing. I would really recommend these DVD and encourage you to take a look you won't regret it.",1363046400,2,920,4.385964912280702
5381478,5,B00A3YY8U6,"Finbar does a great job breaking it down for the beginner as he doesn't assume anything and covers everything.  Get ready to start actually playing bass if you aren't already because these lessons will get you up and running quickly.

You keep learning new things with each viewing and he makes learning so easy!

With a family at home, I can't find the time to get out of the house for lessons and these DVDs make it so convenient--then factor in the value and it is a no-brainer.  Plus, it is fun for my kids to learn to play (mostly via osmosis at this point) as well as they watch and listen to me play and view the DVDs.  Just go buy them!!",1359072000,2,645,4.211382113821138
5381479,5,B00A3YY8U6,"This 5 DVD set is awesome! The man is easy to understand, gets to the meat of things quickly,and teaches you a lot for very little money! Set up your bass one time and its paid for. The first two times I had my bass restrung an experienced guy did this and after watching finbar,I now know the correct way to do it by myself and so can you. It's a simple thing when explained properly, gratifying too!

  This is not just for the beginner/novice bass player. I'm an intermediate player, 3 yrs, an old school dude showed me,and I learned a lot from finbars very own channel :), and I also practiced my tail off. I can rock the blues pretty damn good,and there is still a lot of stuff for me in this set. Learning notes is especially helpful and very easy to understand as is fingering,slap and pop..ect.

Parents if you a looking for an instructional DVD set for your kids I would recommend this as a very good choice. Its not some rock stars glossy DVD or some burned out hippy running through riffs but a professional musician who delivers his lessons in a respectful, but cool straight foreward way that is relaxed and easy to follow that is also fun. As a dad I know my kids won't get bored or confused when and if they do pick up the bass.

If you buy this set you will not be disappointed,I am very happy to have it.
 Thanks, 3cyl",1358726400,3,1335,4.2362204724409445

8546586,3,B00A3YY8U6,"The DVD's don't seem nearly as comprehensive or step by step as the description or reviews suggest.  Only a few short topics per DVD.  Seems like there should be a few beginner DVD's between DVD 1 and DVD 2.  Probably could have fit the whole collection on one DVD.  The first DVD is basically ""here's the Bass and it's parts"", but it quickly jumps to, ""learn the notes on your own"" and all the remaining lessons assume that you already know how to play the bass to some extent and you are just trying to improve your techniques.  I would say this set might be for a ""beginner"" who plays the bass, but don't expect to learn to play from this set.  Probably great for honing your beginner/intermediate bass technique, but that is not how it is described.",1475280000,,753,4.420289855072464

8546589,4,B00A3YY8U6,"Nice beginner course, with a focus on technical aspects: how to mute, scales, simple but good exercises. I would have liked a few simple songs, though. In all fairness, FinBar provides some riffs on Youtube, but not complete songs. All in all, a good beginner course on playing the bass.",1408147200,,287,4.76

8546594,5,B00A3YY8U6,"He has been trying to learn off of Utube for the last year. He said Finbar is the best instructor! He had been trying to find Finbar DVDs locally (in Canada) but could not find any. I kind of told him a white lie when I said I could not find one anywhere, but I knew it would be a great Christmas gift. He is really excited about the DVDs so I know it will help him learn the bass. Shipping was fast and discs were well packed.",1388620800,,427,3.8636363636363638
