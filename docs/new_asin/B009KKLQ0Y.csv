5344354,3,B009KKLQ0Y,I thought I was somewhat  good at yoga. This DVD is very challenging. The first part is easier then the rest. I guess I have a lot to work on. I will keep working at it and get my moneys worth.,1393632000,3,193,3.707317073170732
5344355,5,B009KKLQ0Y,"Kathy Smith is one of the most versatile exercise instructors on the planet.  She is a natural at yoga and yoga instruction.  Out of the many Yoga DVD's that we have used, I would say that this offers nice and clear yoga instruction. This is for advanced, intermediate and beginner alike.  Also, this DVD combines good music to keep you focused on the yoga pose that you are flowing into.  Highly recommended.",1384560000,8,409,4.638888888888889

8542515,4,B009KKLQ0Y,I do this a couple of times a week.  The only thing I question is why is Rod Stryker (?) part of this?  And the 2nd workout is hard for me.,1437523200,,139,3.4516129032258065

8542518,4,B009KKLQ0Y,"Got out of condition after long illness and this is perfect for getting back into routine. My flexibility was gone and I had gained weight and thought it would take me forever to be able to work out well again. This routine is great. Cathy Smith is great at explaining moves and chooses uncomplicated ones. Though, having trained in yoga before, I am aware of some moves she should be more clear about. In tree pose she teaches foot on inner thigh with know alternative for foot on calf for those not flexible enough and she doesn't warn not to place the foot on the knee. Otherwise, I like the progression. After just two weeks, three times a week in the mornings, I feel much more limber and stronger. I now feel that I can quickly get back to the condition I was in before I was sick.",1421712000,2,787,4.324324324324325
8542519,1,B009KKLQ0Y,"this is exactly the same as the other yoga sculpt that I purchased.  The summary is different so I thought I was getting two different workouts even though they have the same name.  I have owned MANY Kathy Smith workouts over the years, but was disappointed that these two were the same.  Glad I didn't spend a whole lot of money on them.  As far as the workout goes, it was about the same as any of her workouts.  She is a great teacher and role model.

As far as speed and timeliness of receiving the purchase, it was prompt as always.",1403136000,4,537,4.215686274509804
8542520,5,B009KKLQ0Y,"I am not much of a yoga enthusiast but the work outs on this dvd are really awesome for a beginner like myself.  Kathy is always, thorough,and professional as she takes you through the moves.  It is challenging and effective.  I would highly recommend this for anyone who desires to become more flexible and improve their strength.",1402444800,6,331,4.771929824561403
