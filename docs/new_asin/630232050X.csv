455120,3,630232050X,"This documentary on the Republic movie studio reveals that they released few classics, or if they did, they aren't mentioned here. Republic was only  a small operation formed in 1935 yet it managed to stay productive until  1959 when it was wiped out by the advent of TV. It thrived in the 30's and  40's when it's major output was weekly serials featuring Dick Tracy and The  Lone Ranger, and westerns starring singing cowboys like Gene Autry and Roy  Rogers. These films were indicative of the studio's limitations since they  were made on a shoe-string budget, generally with time for only one take.  The pompous narrator, who sounds like he's calling a baseball game, tells  us that because of their success, the studio was able to create minatures  that ""the major studios envied"". Hmm. Since a film could be made  so easily it allowed for experimentation and also tended to attract people  who no-one else wanted. Republic promoted the bumpkin Judy Canova and other  obscure vaudeville performers, gave a career to Czech ice skater Vera Hruba  Ralston, and dabbled in propaganda pieces like The Red Menace. Orson Welles  made a black and white Macbeth in 1948 which the studio spent months  re-dubbing since he had insisted on authentic Scottish accents, which they  found to be inaudible. Nicholas Ray directed Joan Crawford in the  sado-masochistic  Johnny Guitar in 1954. John Wayne made 33 films at  Republic, including John Ford's The Quiet Man, which is shown in lush  colour.  This documentary is perverse in the way it tends to skip over  known titles and performers and dwell on the little known. Uncovering  material is one thing, but giving undue attention to mediocrity is quite  another.",960768000,2,1706,4.946996466431095
7824673,1,630232050X,"This is as superficial as it gets. Nothing more than a random clip collection. No history, no behind the scenes. No critique of the serials, the studio, or anything else. Some new interviews, but about 5 mins worth of new material total. For example, the legendary Lydecker brothers did most of Republic's great special effects. Whole books have been written about them! They are mentioned once here, in passing. Oh, come on. That's par for the course in this terrible video. You'd learn more about Republic reading the Wikipedia entry. If you want to see the serials, see them for free on YouTube, don't waste your money on this.",1469318400,,630,4.7889908256880735

Would have been nice if I could have bought it in a digital format.",1363737600,2,275,4.3076923076923075
7824678,4,630232050X,"It has a lot more than the book form of Republic Pictures. However I was a little bit disappointed in the detailted description of their films which were made in the 50's. I feel that's when they produced their best movies such as The Quiet Man,The Last Command,Johnny Guitar etc. Also the aftermath of their closure. A lot more could have said why the empire collapsed and what's happenning today 2012. All told I would rate it 3.5 out of 5.",1330128000,,442,4.469135802469136
7824679,5,630232050X,"This is a TERRIFIC video detailing the life of the ""thrill studio"" of the 30's - late 50's, REPUBLIC PICTURES. Best known for their serials, REPUBLIC PICTURES story also reveals a bit about their magnificent ""B"" westerns and then their gradual move into ""A"" films and finally to their decay and close.  When Repubolic Pictures closed their doors, it was the end of an era.  Excellent video, well worth the time and money spent.",1311552000,2,427,4.756756756756757

7824682,4,630232050X,"The Republic Pictures Story is a story of the B western, serials, and, with the exception of John Wayne/John Ford features, scores of otherwise unknown movies shot on a shoe string and designed to fill the B part of a double bill. Republic Pictures pioneered and perfected what is now the manner in which TV shows are produced. This tape is narrated by Ed Herlihy, famous announcer and newreel narrator. While whimsical at times, this is an informative and entertaining story of how the little guy in Hollywood found it's place and prospered in the 30's, 40's and 50's. I recommend it if you're over 60.",1183766400,5,603,4.69811320754717
