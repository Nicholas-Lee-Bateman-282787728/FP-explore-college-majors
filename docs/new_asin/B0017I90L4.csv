However as with all things, the passage of time has not been particularly kind on the women of Wisteria Lane and their age has REALLY begun showing!

That apart, the series is enjoyable to watch and just like Marc Cherry said in his interview - on the extras DVD of Season 4 (or is it 5) the tornado epidode is really great, as are the special effects.

Keep it up, Marc.

When do we see series 6?

8266028,5,B0017I90L4,I love the box sets. So nice to sit and watch the whole series at one time instead of waiting a whole week to see what happens. Really fun bunch of Women.,1231286400,,154,3.84375
8266029,5,B0017I90L4,"When this show came out in 2004 my oldest son started to watch it and kept telling us (his parents) we ought to watch this show. We kind of hate to watch a show like this that is a weekley series and have to wait 7 days for the next show. We had to do that back in the 70's with shows like Dallas, Knots Landing, Facon Crest, Etc. because there were no VHS, DVD, and now DVR. Setting through all those commericals and waiting week after week after week. So we did not start watching Desperate Housewives for the fear of being in the same old rut as we were with the shows mentioned above. Well after my son's nagging us over and over, we bought the first 4 seasons of the show on DVD. OMG.
This is without a doubt the best show we have ever watched. We are buying the seasons of Dallas and Knots Landing as they become avaiable to watch and have for our own collection. Back to Desperate Housewives. We watch 3 eposide's every night. We are on season 3 now and will begin season 4 soon. We love this show. It is hard to tell you which lady we like best on the show. My wife and I don't agree on this part. I like all 5 of them. If I had to pick a favorite, it would be Felicity Huffman.
They are all just wonderfull. Buy the DVD set. Can't wait until the 5th season come's out on DVD.
