I adore Alessandra Ferri, and if you want to see what she is all about, you don't need to look any further than this performance. Ferri has been called the last dramatic ballerina.

She is able to register all of Giselle's emotions in act 1, the

simple, shy girl who easily falls in love immediately with the handsome stranger. Her face mirrors everything, shyness, happiness, vulnerability, etc.

Her mad scene takes what can be a very gimicky device and turns it into something absolutely heartbreaking.

Act 2 is breath taking. All the magic of a haunted scene is

created. The Myrtha and her troups are frighteningly shadowy.

Ferri seems completely ethereal. Is she there or is it just an illusion?

Murru's partnering of Ferri is magical. The lifts are like

he is raising a cloud.

Ferri registers almost no facial emotion in Act 2, unlike Act 1 , but her tenderness and love for Albrecht come through none the less.

The actual dancing? OK, perhaps Ferri is not the strongest

technician but in view of her tremendous overall performance, that seems like just a tiny quibble. Murru and the rest of the dancers are fine and the corps work in Act 2 is very good, if not flawless.

The performance seems to me to be a good recreation of the original mid 19th century French style; the mime is very well

done, particularly Berthe's description of the horrors of the forest at night.

What more can I say? This performance is magical.",1096156800,6,1566,4.664233576642336
7916398,5,B000031EGF,"I cant agree with the other review for the lighting. Everything is visible in the Action II in the darkness and the wili's group dancing is very impressive. Since the DVD version is hard to get, VHS version is worthwhile to collect.",1093824000,,232,4.5476190476190474
7916399,4,B000031EGF,"I have seen many versions of Giselle, but I hardly remember anyone who  portrayed Giselle better than Ferri did. She is one of the best Giselle.  In act 2, she proved it's possible to speak all human feeling through  dancing. No word was needed. Of course, there was some flaws in this video.  I agree with the other viewer  about lacking of camera work. But, for what  it's worth, I don't regret to have bought this video.",965001600,10,423,4.428571428571429
