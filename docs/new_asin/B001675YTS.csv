The history was not new to me, but the story of the humanity of the individuals was often a revelation that made the names people and their accomplishments more to wonder at.  I highly recommend this book to those who enjoy a great story, history or otherwise.
Best regards,

  Still I hadn't seen that year's show either. There's no better way to vicariously get into all the AKA breeds then in one of the Westminster Kennell Club Dog Show DVDs. If you're really clever you'll see it(and record it)on your TV sometime in February. The small print on the Westminster Website says that this year's show(2013)will be available sometime in April. For $25 it's a deal-a GREAT dog show!

8261279,5,B001675YTS,"The 132nd Westminster Dog show was one of the most exciting dog shows in memory.  This is the year a ""real dog"" finally won. There was a standing ovation when Uno the beagle took home the big prize.  The Hound group had not won since 1983 and a beagle had never won.  It was great.",1279411200,2,281,4.072727272727272
