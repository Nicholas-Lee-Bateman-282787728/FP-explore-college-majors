6202135,5,B00HS2OWNO,This show has the ability to become a great show as long as they do it right. So far the pilot is amazing and really keeps you on the edge of your seat.,1395446400,,152,3.6363636363636362
6202136,4,B00HS2OWNO,"It's hard to believe that The CW is the network for some of the best genre TV on air.  Science fiction shows are hard to find these days, particularly space-based sci-fi, so it is refreshing to see that The 100 offers just that.

The casting is pretty good and for the most part I like the main characters: Clarke (the lead female character), Finn (a character I expected to be just a good-looking opportunist, but who ended up being one of the most compassionate characters in the show), Raven (another strong, smart female character), and Bellamy, as well as Dr. Abby Griffin.  It's a CW show, so everyone is good looking, but the nice thing is they can also act. Even though I knew about a couple twists from the trailers, the first episode quickly makes you realize that this is going to go to some dark, scary spaces.

I like that the story follows both the teens sent to Earth and the adults remaining on The Ark, since both settings provide great opportunities for dramatic storytelling. As an adult myself (in my early 30s), I have a greater respect for the dilemmas of the adults and as a BSG fan, I appreciated the practical and ethical struggles the adults on The Ark are faced with.

Teenage characters are usually difficult for me to relate to, since in TV they tend to be annoying, self-absorbed, and reckless.  However, in The 100, these teens are forced to grow up fast and make life and death decisions without any guidance from the adults.

There was a lot of exposition in the first episodes and some of the dialogue was clunky, since they were trying to explain a lot of backstory, but these elements improved as the season progressed.

If there's one complaint I have, it's that the show is very quick to kill off characters before giving them a chance to make an impression.  However, the first season is ambitious and quite addictive, as the story goes in directions you could not have predicted based on early episodes.

Review is based on having seen the complete first season.",1395446400,45,2002,4.598314606741573

6202142,5,B00HS2OWNO,"I was prepared not to like this show at all, do to the fact that it was space oriented and just slow moving at the start. Stick with it! The show really starts off by about the 5th episode! It's so much more than you cliche space show... it has so many new, and unheard of creatures. It has an original story line that other popular book series lack. The main characters always struggle instead of everything in their life being perfect, which I think adds to the story line itself. Thai show is amazing! If you like the flash, the vampire diaries, or the originals then I think you will definately like this whole series. The story line gets a little weird and confusing in season 2 but if you pay attention and have good memory then you will do just fine! REMEMBER THE NAMES OF CHARACTERS!

6202149,4,B00HS2OWNO,"The discs come in plastic snap cases. The discs play fine.

I devour fantasy and science fiction, which is why I sample this series by watching an episode or two each year. I bought the first season because I missed the first episode. I'll buy the last season or last episode when the series ends to see who is left. Until then, watching one or two episodes a year is more than enough for me. The series is so-so and there are so many other shows I want to sample.

If you're looking for something more mature you might like a couple of space race shows. I spent a month on a space race binge. First I read Space by James A. Michener. Then I watched two movies, The Right Stuff (1983) and Apollo 13 (1995), and then two great series, From Earth to the Moon (1998) and The Astronauts Wives Club (2015). Theyre a great combination.

If the above shows don't sound interesting here are a few of the series I really enjoyed watching more than once. I love good miniseries like Band of Brothers (2001), Frank Herberts Dune (2000), Into the West (2005), Lonesome Dove (1989), Pride and Prejudice (1995), Taken (2002) and The 10th Kingdom (2000) because they have beginnings, middles and endings, like a good novel.

Other shows Ive really enjoyed include Battlestar Galactica (2004-2009), Breaking Bad (2008-2013), Cowboy Bebop (1998), Downton Abbey (2010-2015), Firefly (2002), Game of Thrones (2011-2019), The IT Crowd (2006-2013), Jericho (2006-2008), Lost (2004-2010), Merlin (2008-2012), Rome (2005-2007), Spartacus: Gods of the Arena (2011), Spartacus: Blood and Sand (2010), Stargate: SG-1 (1997-2007), Stargate: Atlantis (2004-2009), Star Trek The Original Series (1966-1969) and Star Trek Voyager (1995-2001). I didn't list any contemporary series Im following that don't have an end date yet, not conducive to binge watching from beginning to finish, or the hundreds of other fantasy and science fiction shows Ive watched.

If you like reading try some of my favorite fantasy and sci-fi authors: Richard Adams, Palo Bacigulupi, Suzanne Collins, Abe Evergreen, Diana Gabaldon, Hugh Howey, George Martin, Brandon Sanderson, John Scalzi, and Andy Weir.",1520812800,,2153,5.070621468926554
6202150,3,B00HS2OWNO,"Just finished Season 1. I will give Season 2 a shot  as my kid seems to enjoy it (and the only reason it gets 3 starts) but I do not have much hope for it. The premise is that Earth has been destroyed by nuclear war and the sole survivors are on a dying space station. A promising premise with all manner of options to the imaginative. Unfortunately, the producers didn't have any imagination. There are no surprises. Everything is predictable...formula layered over formula that we have seen uncounted times over. Although the acting is good most of the characters are stock varieties. And you can forget reality: A 17 year old performs medical procedures that would have been difficult for a properly trained surgeon with a properly equipped and staffed OR...kids raised on a space station become expert hunters/foragers within a few days...and so on. And, as we soon learn, there is no need for the original premise whatsoever. Humanity did survive the war. We have the usual post-apocalyptic survivors who live in a fantasy warrior culture with the stock post-apocalyptic costumes, the usual cannibals and, as the season finally reveals, humans who have maintained modern technology. With the original premise pointless, I expect the rest of this series will meander around from one formula sub-plot to the next as the producers try to figure out how to keep audiences interested. I'll give the series one more shot.",1519430400,4,1420,4.941422594142259

1. Technology good to launch a reentry vehicle from orbit, with 100 people on board, with wrist bands to monitor live vital signs from orbit, but not advanced enough to include radiation read outs?

2. Harsh laws and death sentences for any infraction--so, you kill one of your own doctors for using too much blood to save the leader of the station? This doesn't make sense, since blood only lasts so long anyway, and you really can't afford to lose doctors.

3. This is a high school or middle school flick, so there is much drama about nothing.

6202170,4,B00HS2OWNO,"If you're interested in watching The 100, I recommend taking season one on faith and sticking with it in spite of how it starts, in spite of how blatantly it rips off any number of other TV shows and movies, in spite of half the characters being badly written and in spite of the really, really bad science.  It gets better as the season progresses, and then gets much better in the second season.  Basically, it has a lot in common with Babylon 5 - the first season is pretty weak but you watch because there are some interesting underlying ideas and plot lines that come out as you go along, and because of a handful of characters - and the actors portraying them - that actually manage to grow and develop in interesting ways as the series progresses.

The 100 is set in a not too distant future 97 years after a nuclear apocalypse devastated the Earth and left it seemingly uninhabitable. The only people to survive were those who happened to be in space at the time, in one of a dozen space stations maintained by different countries at the time.  The decision was made to bring all the individual stations together and join them into one big station complex now known as ""The Ark"", where some 2100 descendants of the original survivors now live.  With no one left on Earth to provide supplies or support, resources on the Ark are very limited, resulting in strict rules under which all inhabitants of the Ark must live. The punishments for breaking the rules - anything from stealing food or medicine to having a second child - are draconian:  imprisonment if the offender is under 18, death if they're an adult.

As the series begins, the Ark is facing a crisis that only the leadership - an elected chancellor and council - know about:  the Ark's life support systems are failing.  The desperate decision is made to send 100 prisoners - all kids under 18 - down to the Earth's surface in a one-way drop-ship with one mission:  survive. If they survive, the Ark will know that their remaining people can return to Earth. If not, then even more desperate measures will have to be taken.

It's not really a spoiler to reveal that the 100 sent down to Earth survive.  Or at least most of them do.  (it would've been a very short series if they didn't).  However, the number does go down as the season progresses. The survivors quickly learn two things:  (1) they can survive on the Earth, but (2) they're far from alone.

Note:  The 100 is based on the popular YA sci-fi series of books of the same name written by Kass Morgan.  I have not read the books, but after looking up synopses of them, it appears that the TV series is at best only loosely based on the books.

And while this is supposedly a sci-fi series, it's best not to dwell on the science involved, not even for a minute.  It varies from weak to bad and then to the laughably bad.  It's also best not to dwell on some of the writing as it's very apparent when the writers are just all but stealing things from other TV shows and movies.

What makes The 100 work is two things.  Some of the underlying ideas and plot lines are actually pretty good, though it takes a while for them to come up.  And while some of the characters are little more than overused cliches, other characters - and the actors playing them - do develop in interesting ways as the season progresses.

One of the most interesting characters is Marcus Kane (Henry Ian Cusick), a councilman who seems set up at the beginning to be the show's principal villain. But at the season progresses, the character develops into quite a complex individual who more than anyone else feels the weight of responsibility that comes with the decisions he makes and increasingly puts himself at risk for the good of all.  Another is Octavia Blake (Marie Avgeropoulos), one of the younger members of the 100 whose ""crime"" was being a forbidden second child. Octavia proves to be the most adept at adapting to life on Earth, in particular at learning about - and gaining the respect of - ""the Grounders"", the descendants of the people who managed to survive on Earth living out in the open after the nuclear apocalypse.

Recommended for people who like dystopic-future scifi series and are willing to stick through a weak beginning season in order to get to where things start to get a lot better.",1503878400,44,4317,4.515424164524422

6202176,3,B00HS2OWNO,"Very derivative. The writers and producers try to emulate many facets of the formula used within LOST to create a sense of tension and mystery, including the use of flash backs, musical crescendo's during plot twists/surprises, etc. Fans of LOST will see the ATTEMPT to emulate right away.

Unfortunately, season one of the 100 suffers from poor character development at the expense of shock value. Several potentially intriguing characters are needlessly killed off before they've even achieved a decent level of complexity. The elimination of those characters leaves the viewer more disappointed than shocked or surprised.

Where LOST took its time, built its characters, and made the audience CARE, the 100 rushes, tries too hard, and derives too much from other sources.

Is it still worth watching? Yes, it's a well made series that's enjoyable enough to pass the time. I'm writing this review while watching season one, and I'll follow up with my opinions regarding later seasons. Who knows, maybe they'll surprise me.

6202215,3,B00HS2OWNO,"You know, the 100 isn't bad.  However anyone that's even slightly educated can't help but ask... how in the hell did they just suddenly drop back into the dark ages, and refuse to technically advance once again?  And that one building that's still standing after all that time, but no other buildings are?  Puh-lease!  Despite the blundering impossibilities, and lack of motivation of people to just simply lie back and revert back to a stone age mentality, where everyone suddenly is speaking a different freakn' language, it's somewhat entertaining, but still annoyingly impossible.  Much easier to pull off a landscape that nature has created verses manufacturing a future.",1480896000,,676,5.222222222222222

6202217,3,B00HS2OWNO,"I just completed a marathon watch of the three seasons thus far available (a fourth season is in the works as of this writing).

While I'm not generally a fan of post-apocalyptic movie and television, I have found The 100 somewhat engaging. The main plot and story arcs are imaginative, if sometimes contrived. If you're a fan of Game of Thrones and The Hunger Games, you may enjoy The 100, as it's essentially a mix-mash of the two. Also, if you're a fan of sex at really inappropriate moments or of people continually bemoaning the difficult decisions they've made, you'll be a happy camper. Characters lamenting their actions is a major theme, over and over and over.

The 100 is a soap opera set in a junk yard, where characters' faces are forever smeared with blood, and where tiny, size-1 girls are an easy match for brawny, 250-pound guys in close combat.",1479859200,,862,4.6644736842105265

6202226,5,B00HS2OWNO,"The 100 definitely stands on its own when it comes to the great, compelling and immensely entertaining science fiction drama. Season 1 is engrossing from the start, and some friends I recommended the show to actually had to go to sleep late because they loved it so much. I came upon The 100 by accident while searching for some inexpensive movies they had on sale at Best Buy store. A simple and effective DVD cover featuring the show's main protagonist Clarke Griffith and some of her friends got my attention. I turned the DVD over to read about the who and... A few days later I bought all 3 existing seasons on DVD on e-bay in one nice package. To be honest, I had no idea what to expect. Then, as the story developed and flowed, I understood everything and fell in love with the show. It's entertaining enough to satisfy a picky science fiction buff in me who enjoys the post-apocalyptic adventure and drama. Here's why I love the show and highly recommend it to everyone:
1) Simple and effective plot that becomes more complex and entertaining as the characters fight for sanity and survival on wounded Earth.
2) Terrific cast and excellent production quality of the series with a well-thought out realistic dialogue, action and suspense.
3) Well-developed sympathetic and diverse characters that are very human and not presented as purely good or evil but rather in shades of gray.
4) Unexpected plot twists, action and intrigue that make you root for the characters and feel emotions when they are hurt or killed.
5) Wonderful special features for the DVD and info on how the series were made, sets built and actors chosen for their roles.

Excellent show. Simply excellent! Five gold stars out of five!",1474588800,,1712,4.74496644295302

6202233,1,B00HS2OWNO,"I can't even begin to list the ingredients in the tidal wave of stupidity that is this show. What absolute trash. Hey; let's send 100 angsty teen prisoners down to earth to see if it is suitable for re-population. No sooner are they on the ground than the first concern is which girl is going to go out with which guy and instead of going into survival mode, they all build a bonfire and party like it's 1999 (sans booze and drugs, of course). If this is how people behave in the aftermath of a global apocalypse, I daresay that keeping the human race going might not be such a good idea after all. Teens may eat this crap up and dish out five star reviews like it's the best thing since Transformers, but seriously, if you are over 16 years old and have half a brain, avoid this at all costs.",1472947200,2,793,4.223684210526316

But after a couple of episodes I really got hooked!!  I really love the pacing.  It just goes and goes and keeps you drawn in and engaged with the high drama and suspense.  I liked some threads more than others, but overall, it's quite a good show.  Plus, it's queer-friendly.  The blond lead, Clarke, is a bisexual.

The first couple of seasons were awesome.  But like a lot of viewers, I was bummed with the plot turns in Season 3 and just kinda put the show on hold.  Perhaps I'll continue on later this fall.

6202271,4,B00HS2OWNO,"The 100 is a show on the line of ""It's really good"" and ""It's just a guilty pleasure.""
There are tons of visuals that suck you into this world, and to its credit the world of The 100 is very creative and imaginative. The cast has a lot of chemistry, which helps connecting with the characters. Some of the reveals work really well, and the season ends on an interesting cliff hanger.

The negatives of The 100 are what will probably make or break the show for you. The character motivations are to the extreme, and at some times I was confused at how far these motivations will push these characters. Also, its a YA story so you'll find lots of meaningless hookups that doesn't do anything for the show, and quite frankly the main character can either be seen as a strong woman, or an annoying one who preaches peace.

The 100 isn't a perfect show, but going into this without any expectations I found this really fun, even though some character moments leave me confused. If you're looking for some soft science fiction goodness then I'd say give this a try, it's a good show to watch an episode before bed.",1463616000,9,1108,4.45320197044335

6202322,2,B00HS2OWNO,"Before You Watch:
First of all are you a Man or a Woman? Do you understand what I mean when I say this show belongs on Lifetime?
If you're a woman you'll probably enjoy this show as it was written by a woman and definitely runs high on emotions and lacks a good amount of logic. As for Men are you someone who can pick out all the bulls*** and stand constant bad decisions run on emotions as well as completely unrealistic crap?
Ok so now that you're thinking I'll tell you why I gave this show 2 stars. First of all I have watched the show all the way into season 3 as painful as its been. This show has been filling a show gap I've had from binge watching far better ones. The show's core story has kept me watching and is interesting enough but holy crap is the writing bad. Even with characters that are supposed to be teenagers this story should not be so bad. 90% of the decisions made in this show are based solely on emotion rather than logic. Not only that but just so many things in the show will leave you asking "" how the F*** does that make any sense"" I'll sum it up though. Its an enjoyable enough show but it also gives me a headache and leaves me screaming at the TV half the time. If you're someone that notices stupid crap, appreciates logic and research going into the writing, and hates things like twilight then this show is not for you unless its an emergency. If you're someone who doesn't really know anything about weapons or space, don't care about a writers effort to research things and make them more believable and relatable, and if you're someone driven by emotions then this is probably a show you would enjoy.",1456963200,2,1642,4.282958199356913

6202329,3,B00HS2OWNO,"I'm only halfway through the second season of The 100, and I'm finding it entertaining, but there are so many silly things. Here are a few:
1) the kids are all supposed to be under 18 (at 18 they are of age and wold be ""floated"" from The Ark), yet the youngest actor in the first season was, I think, 23. Most of the leading young adult actors are in their late twenties.
2) the food! They seem to be in a rain forest in British Columbia. Even if this were in Virginia, where it is supposed to be set, and where there is a lot of farmland, no one is engaged in agriculture. Could they kill enough rabbits and deer and such to feed a hundred kids? In one episode several kids are eating what are clearly Gala apples--and throwing them say half eaten! In the same episode they are shelling English walnuts and pecans! In another episode they are slicing thick steaks out of some carcass and ""smoking"" them. They brought no food from the space station.
3) the training! Surely they wouldn't have guns on a space station--where a bullet could puncture the hull and cause a disaster. So where did they learn to shoot automatic weapons accurately and reload shells without reloading equipment? How is it that kids who have spent their entire lives on a space station know how to use spears and bows, hunt and fish, disembowel carcasses, cook? Even if some know something about hydroponic agriculture, where are their seeds? Where do they get shovels, plows, draft animals? And how do these kids know how to build fires? They surely didn't do that on a space station. When they pick flowers, they are lilies and such that are domesticated, not wild flowers, and they wouldn't grow in that sort of forest,many way.
4) in the underground fortress, how do they still have chocolate after a century, and what animals are they eating? Why are their medical supplies still good after a century.
5) in the kids' camp, I noted in their defensive wall steel studs used for drywall in construction. They are light and flimsy. Why would they be on their ship? Drywall partitions? There is also heavy steel probably purchased in a junk yard. Is there one nearby?
This is just a sample of the errors. I realize that the show isn't about these things, but it should have been possible to address these things, think them through. I'm surprised they weren't eating bananas and Big Macs.",1456185600,,2364,4.564705882352941

6202349,4,B00HS2OWNO,"A collection of youths are released to a long since abandoned planet Earth as an experiment to see if it is inhabitable. Some of the space-bound adults are confident that Earth is habitable, some are trying to sabotage the efforts and some are doubtful. The youth, or the 100, are unwitting participants in this gamble or experiment. So when they land on Earth, they venture out into the world like newborn children, creating a new society, forming bonds and taking leadership roles.

That's pretty much the premise to the show and it's pretty simple. Although, to me, that is why the show works. They keep the show simple and interpersonal. Not unlike the successful Battlestar Gallactica series, the creators never try to bite off more than they can chew. Sure, in the back of your mind, you know that the potential to take the show to an even larger place is there, but at the same time you know that's always a possibility while they juggle the personalities of the characters.

""The 100"", like ""Twilight"", ""The Hunger Games"", ""The Maze Runner"" etc. etc. etc, is based on a collection of books and I give them props for wisely taking this to television. With this format, creators can be truer to the books with more time to flesh out personalities and stories; i.e. ""Game of Thrones"". Also like the aforementioned movies, ""the 100"" is similar to many movies and shows you may know. Isn't that what successful writers are doing these days anyway? Stealing material and twisting it their way.  ""The 100"" reminds me of ""Lord of the Flies"" meets ""Lost"" and ""Battlestar Gallactica"".

Enjoying this show very much. I binge watched a half-a-dozen television shows during the day while I work on my side business and none of them truly grabbed my attention until ""The 100"".

6202353,1,B00HS2OWNO,"Target Audience: 14-16 year olds experiencing 'munchies' while viewing.

In the opening scenes the viewer is expected to believe a couple things right off the bat; first being that after surviving 100 years on a space station after the earth's apocalypse, females have somehow managed to synthesize beauty care products, and there is apparently plenty of electricity for blow dryers and curling irons -- not to mention lots of water for hair washing and conditioning. There's apparently a Teen Space-Gap Store onboard, as all the kids are wearing pristine fashion.  On the other side of the scale: overuse of medical supplies is punishable by death.

Take episode 1, scene 1 for example: teen aged girl, blond highlights & dark roots, lots of foundation, blush, concealer, mascara, eye shadow -- and she's in space-station-prison -- surprised she didn't think to use her high-heels to pick the lock. If this was at all realistic, the women would have short hair, no makeup, and dressed similarly to the men.

No shortage of hair product -- plenty of gel and mousse for all the men and women of the 100 year old space station. And speaking of the men, apparently there's an abundance of shaving stuff as well, making it possible to maintain a shave-every-day standard in space. Amazingly, even the young men sent to earth who are struggling through a radiated danger-filled jungle just to find the food locker manage to remain cleanshaven. Similarly, all the girls maintain perfectly arranged hair, and manage to change their eyeshadow colors in that same jungle -- what a clever way to convey the passage of a day, different eyeshadow color... All this without carrying a single supply box, bag, or container of any sort off the ship they landed in.

6202365,5,B00HS2OWNO,"From the beginning of the series, the 100 had three strikes against it, making its success seem almost miraculous. This show is based on a trilogy of novels, in most cases the show/film is never as good as the books, but in this case it's better. Second, the show was a mid-summer replacement, something that almost never makes it passed it's first season, and finally it's on the CW, so most people assume it's just another teen drama, but the 100 is a lot more than that. The reason this show has survived and the reason it's been named one of the best shows on television that you're not watching, is because of it's terrific story lines, deep characters, and unique make up. When Entertainment Weekly said it's the most underrated shows on television they weren't kidding.

150 years in the future, Earth has been all but destroyed by World War 3, and the remains of the human race, the lucky decedents of people who escaped the cataclysm, live on a space station called the Ark. Resources on the Ark are extremely limited and for that reason, crime is met with death, unless you're under the age of eighteen, in that case the punishment is imprisonment. After nearly 100 years in space, the Ark is dying and the leaders know their only hope for survival is to return to Earth, but can they withstand the radiation? In order to test this, they decide to send 100 of the least violent juvenile offenders down to the planet as test subjects. As the kids set up camp and learn to live on the planet, their accomplishments quickly take a backseat when they learn, they are not alone.

Most TV shows that are based on books, never seem to be able to capture the essence of the main characters and for that reason people never really get a complete look at what the author intended. In the 100 saga, the skilled actors and the tremendous writing allow you to connect to characters in a way that goes above and beyond the original story. This is a show that also has many sub-plots, it's not simply about the kids on earth, the people in space, and the survivors on the planet. the viewer learns backstory through flashbacks and knows every character and their history intimately. As I watched this show, I really felt as though I was a member of this camp and I knew everybody, only a great show can accomplish this.

This is a show that is so much more than just another CW teen drama, it is a look into the new direction the network is taking with shows like Arrow & The Flash. The 100 is a continuous story that you will not be able to stop watching. It is intense, exciting, and has more depth to the story than any show I've seen in a long time. If you can get over the fact that its a CW show and prominently features a group of teenagers, you will see one of the most interesting and dynamic science fiction shows to air on network television in years.",1448668800,,2857,4.417457305502846
6202366,4,B00HS2OWNO,"Having just finished Season 1, I'm eager to get Season 2.  Sure the TV show does borrow heavily from other fiction as well as human history but it does it well.  We start of as a sort of Lord of the Flies scenario which turns into a recreation of European settlements into other continents seen at the time as being uninhabited. You've even got the old sent to Earth for really petty crimes as there simply isn't room and resources in the space station to keep them there, paralleling the myth of kids got sent to Australia in 1788 for stealing a loaf of bread.  Unlike the English convict ships though, these Ark convicts don't have any soldiers with them to force them to build and do whatever they want to help the future non prisoner arrivals once they arrive.  Also like with Under the Dome for example there are those with their own reasons, who don't want the people of their former existence to ever mix with them again.

It isn't the greatest show ever made, and you'd imagine the teens (American TV style played by older actors) would all probably have been killed off early on by what's down here on Earth, and unlike Game of Thrones or something it's pretty obvious the main characters are going to be constantly saved (or an arrow or something will take out the person beside them, instead of them as the group leader as should happen).  But still I liked it.  The only thing I didn't really like was as is often done with these post apocalyptic kid character shows, is the native people, such as the Grounders' leader, just looked like ridiculous Mad Max style wannabes.  I preferred the early Lord of the Flies style story line to the following dealing with Earth's inhabitants ones, but I'm still hooked enough to see what happens next.",1448582400,,1752,4.5396825396825395

6202368,1,B00HS2OWNO,The 100 builds it's story lines not only by borrowing tired material from other (more successful) series but also lifting complete ideas. It's obviously marketed to the privileged teen groups that love looking in the mirror. The writers of this series pulled together a group of pampered actors that appear to have come off of the set of 90210 rather than a space station. The amount of arm-chair psychology practiced on the show will really make you mentally ill. The mushy characters waffle back and forth across the screen never really telling us who they are. Watching this series will really have you rooting for Mother Nature to take out the trash. I think they should focus the camera more on the grass growing around the settlement rather than following this herd of brats.

6202379,1,B00HS2OWNO,"I watched the entire first season. 10 wasted hours of my life! Everything the other one star reviewers are saying is true. It was a good concept terribly executed. Bad acting, idiotic dialogue, poorly conceived plot lines, bratty 25-30 year olds playing 18 (unconvincingly).

But I noticed something else which made no sense. In episode 7 the 100's base camp is hit by a hurricane. On the ark a weather radar screen shows a massive hurricane in the Gulf of Mexico as someone says ""the hurricane is right on them"". In a later episode we're told the 100's base camp is 60 miles from the ocean. So you might logically conclude they're 60 miles from the Gulf of Mexico. Problem - the show was filmed near Vancouver, British Columbia. The trees and plants don't look like the USA gulf coast. Solution - the nuclear war set off a nuclear winter and climate change, so now the gulf coast is as cold as British Columbia. Bigger Problem - did the nuclear war make mountains pop up around the gulf coast, too?  Because we see tall snow covered peaks near the 100's base camp. So where exactly are they supposed to be?",1446249600,2,1107,4.53

Stick with this show until the fifth episode and you won't regret it. It's surprisingly dark, even more so than Game of Thrones if that says anything. The showrunners had visible difficulty at first (these are practically their breakout roles) but soon enough the talent kicks in and the acting is phenomenal. The character progression is something to rival Buffy.

All in all, definitely check it out at least until the fifth episode. It's a fantastic show and while this season was great, season 2 elevates that awesomeness tenfold.",1444003200,,625,4.886792452830188

This show is incredible! If you like shows or movies like, LOST, The Maze Runner Series, or the Hunger Games Series, you will love this!

I was searching through Netflix and was re-watching Lost, (I was super bored) and in the recommended shows was The 100. I began watching it and loved it all the way to the end! I was really disappointed Season 2 wasn't out, but I'll wait! :D

Story:
Human civilization has taken refuge in outer space after a nuclear war eradicated most of human life on Earth. 12 Space stations joined together to create the Ark. 97 years later after the war, there are over 2,000 people on board, and not enough oxygen. Families are only allowed to have one child, and if anybody commits a crime little or small, is sentenced to death by getting ""floated."" If you are under 18 and commit a crime, you are sent to jail, and until you are 18 you will stay there.
The main character is Clarke, and she is in prison because of her father's crime, and she was included with the sentence. Since the Ark is running out of air, the chancellors send 100 of the prisoners on a desperate mission on the ground, to see if life is sustainable.

A little info on the characters:

Clarke - Isn't as hard headed as most main characters in shows and movies nowadays, and I always enjoy her presence on the show. She is a natural born leader and is a like able character.

Finn - Part of a love triangle (Won't spoil) Sort of a daredevil, but is actually peaceful and makes safe decisions.

Raven - Not part of The 100, came down from the Ark to see if anybody was alive. Mechanic and is very smart, she is my favorite character on the show!

Bellamy - Older brother of Octavia, also not a part of The 100. He did something (again, won't spoil) to get on the pod.

Octavia - Bellamy's sister, she is adventurous and always does stuff that annoys her brother.

Jasper and Monty- Jasper and Monty are best friends who are both intelligent and know stuff in science.

I won't say anymore because I would write the hugest review, and it would be full of spoilers! I HIGHLY recommend this show. It is one of the best shows there is, and I hope they continue making new seasons.",1443225600,,2208,4.389705882352941

6202392,4,B00HS2OWNO,"Earth had a nuclear war which left the entire Planet locked in Radiation & uninhabitable for 100 years. Some un-revealed number of people managed to get aboard a large space station, or a Space Ark. They have been living there for generations on the Ark and in orbit around the Earth for 97 years.  All is not well, from time to time the dwindling air supply caused by various systems malfunctions makes it necessary to 'cull' the population.  100's of people are selected and flushed out of an air lock into space in order to give the others a few more months of air.  There is one Leader who is elected by a democratic vote of the general population.  Having more than one child is against the law, and in fact the punishment for any infraction is usually death by floating.
Main character, Clark, is the teenage daughter of the main Doctor/Scientist, Abby, aboard the Ark space station.  Abby is an important member of the Chancellor's council.  Her daughter Clark is spirited & winds up getting arrested. She and 99 other problem youngsters are sent to Earth, as part of an experiment, to ascertain its habitability.  All of the 100 wear special bracelets that monitor their vital signs.  Clark's Mother, Abby, heads up the bracelet experiment.  The decrepit 100 year old pod ship makes it to Earth and the 100 find that earth is again livable but things have changed.  Clark & others go in search of Mt. Weather their original target landing spot.  They see a deer grazing and are delighted until it turns & faces them and they see it has facial deformity from exposure to high concentrations of radiation.  While searching for Mt. Weather one of their party gets speared in the chest by an unknown someone.  They name these people The Grounders and the grounders & their story are slowly revealed through the remaining episodes of the season.
  Complications arise when others amongst the group want to be in charge and convince most of the 100 to remove their vital sign bracelets.
On the Ark they think the kids are removing the bracelets but cannot be certain.  The air supply goes critical again and this necessitates a 300 people Culling aboard the Ark.  Abby, Clark's Mother, convinces Raven a star mechanic into revamping an old one-person escape ship so she can deliver a radio to Clark on the Earth.  As the rickety old craft becomes ready Abby herself is arrested and almost 'Floated'.  With Abby unable to go, the female mechanic goes in her place.  She doesn't get there in time to radio the Ark and prevent the Culling from taking place.  The population on the Ark decide to chuck it in and go to Earth.  Not all make it.
  In the last episode of this season we see a giant battle between the Grounders and the 100.  As the 100 triumph over the Grounders the remaining participants of both groups are rendered unconscious by gas grenades; Clark awakens in a locked hospital room inside the Mt. Weather facility.  Gets bogged down and slow in some places but all in all pretty interesting.",1442707200,2,3007,4.658444022770398

Very thought provoking.

I think the title has much to be desired as there are just too many 100, 4400, 300, 24, etc and it just got lost in all the number shows.  Might have caught on sooner with a better title.

Wish that someone had the recent episodes (more than 5) to watch for free. Not sure why the CW cannot have them all to watch on their channel. Dont see paying $2 per episode, think thats pretty much a rip off when so many people have a DVR.  We have prime and it still costs us.

6202446,1,B00HS2OWNO,"Ninety-seven years after a Nuclear Holocaust has apparently rendered the surface of the Earth uninhabitable, the last surviving vanguard of humanity eke out a hand-to-mouth existence aboard an orbital community comprised of twelve space stations which were hastily welded together in the early days of the apocalypse. Given the precariousness of their situation, life aboard the space station is subject to draconian strictures and even the most minor transgressions of the law are rewarded with summary execution via the expedient of being pushed out of an airlock (a practice which is colloquially known as ""floating""). Minors who have broken the law are imprisoned until the age of eighteen, at which point they too are ""floated"". However, one hundred of these junior lawbreakers suddenly find themselves unceremoniously bundled into a drop-ship and sent on a one-way trip to the surface of the Earth. Their mission: act as an exploratory party in order to ascertain whether life on Earth is now viable and whether recolonisation is now possible.

Interesting concept, right?

Well, in the right hands it could have been. But as is the case with so much American Television, ""The 100"" takes a great concept and murders it through the expedient of horribly pedestrian execution. What had the potential to be an excellent series descends into the tropes of a bad day-time soap opera within minutes of the opening titles disappearing from the screen. Virtually all of the teen characters are beautiful, fit and appealing in that just-on-the-right-side-of-edgy way that's the fashion these days and they're all about as interesting as a piece of damp cardboard. Meanwhile aboard the space station, the grown-ups connive and double-deal and lie to each other in order to maintain the peace, gain status and office and blah de blah de blah de blah.

Aside from the derivative plots, boring characters and soap opera histrionics, the major problem that I had with watching ""The 100"" was that within the first twenty minutes or so I could quite clearly hear the producers pitching it to the network off of the back of other shows' successes (""So the kids are fish out of water in this strange new land that they've never seen but have heard about, so it's 'Lost'! But you've also got this great dystopian military-SF intrigue going on aboard the station, so it's also 'Battlestar Galactica!'""). In short, the show feels like a remix of a ton of other far more original movies and TV shows that you've already seen. Hell, even the actors look like younger clones of other actors with whom were already familiar (the female lead, Clarke, is played by an actress who looks like a younger clone of Ali Larter; the surly, morally ambiguous Bellamy looks like a teen chimera which has been cloned from genetic material supplied by Justin Long and the kid who played ""Frank"" in ""Donnie Darko""; and later on, clones of a young Jessica Alba and Vin Diesel turn up) and if that hasn't been done consciously, then hand me my hat, a knife and fork and a bottle of steak sauce.

If listening to pouty American teens (most of whom are actually played by smiley twenty-something Australians) whine about their love lives and how misunderstood they are as they're occasionally picked-off by mostly unseen nasties (because you just knew that they weren't going to be alone down there, didn't you?) while wandering along woodland hiking trails is your thing, then please fill your boots and watch this series. For those of us who are looking for something that contains a scintilla of originality, my advice is to ignore the mystifying rave reviews that this series has garnered and steer well clear.",1433203200,20,3677,4.973983739837398

Fortunately they then seemed to gradually settle on the former, and by Season 2 it leaves behind most of the sillier of the teen stuff.  In doing so it achieves a consistent narrative with some unexpectedly sophisticated character development. As a result, by the end of Season 2, The 100 has actually become one of my favorite shows on television.

Perhaps the what most makes the show work for me is the evolution of the character of Clarke Griffin. It's exceedingly rare to find a show centered around a teen girl in a leadership position and even rarer that her character is so fully developed, warts and all. You may not always agree with the sometimes horrendous choices she makes, but you can always understand why she made them.  Plus, one of the things I most appreciate about Clarke is that she's no superhero with special powers or fighting skills, but rather just an ordinary girl with natural leadership abilities and stubborn determination to try to save her people under the most extreme of circumstances.",1430524800,,1497,4.609022556390977

6202475,5,B00HS2OWNO,"I watch a ton of television. I'm a fan of many types of shows--everything from The Walking Dead to Game of Thrones to Mr. Selfridge. I'll watch and enjoy anything, as long as it's entertaining. I started watching Wolf Hall, a VH1 show called Hindsight and The 100 at the same time. To my surprise, The 100 was the show I ended up loving the most. Actually, I would go so far as to say this is the most underrated show on television.

Truth be told, the pilot episode was a bit strange for me. It was exactly what I expected the show to be: a slightly corny teen drama (Finn flipping off a building... Octavia stripping off her clothes... ugh!). But I'm glad I didn't quit, because after watching the 2nd episode, I was hooked. Thankfully, the rest of the show seemed nothing like the pilot. After episode 2, each episode kept getting better and better. Something intense and exciting happens ALL THE TIME! The 'teens' (the actors aren't really teenagers, fyi) and adults in this show have to deal with some very dark, heartbreaking issues. As far as post-apocalyptic stories go, this is truly one of the best.

I've tried recommending The 100 to a few people, but I've convinced none of them to watch. I was also a skeptic at first. I wonder if they, like me, are assuming it's just another hokey teen drama. It's really not. It can hold its own against any of the best shows on television. Kudos to CW for providing some fantastic entertainment!",1428105600,,1446,4.515267175572519

6202485,5,B00HS2OWNO,"I was prepared not to like 'The 100' for the simple reason that, in most cases, network television doesn't really do science fiction very well. If you think about the great sci-fi series of the past, most were done on cable networks: ""The 'X' Files"" and ""Firefly"" being two notable examples.
That said, I have to admit that I loved this first season of 'The 100' because it relied not on special effects and superheroes but on strong writing, excellent character development and believable scenarios.
Without revealing too much of the narrative, the series revolves around a hundred juvenile prisoners aboard a gigantic space station containing the last remnants of humanity. Earth has been devastated in an attack and for 97 years has been thought of as uninhabitable. The hundred delinquents are sent down to Earth by the space station's leaders as guinea pigs: If they can survive on what is thought to be a radioactive planet the rest of the humanity can follow and attempt to restart society. This first season provides viewers with a dual narrative as the action shifts back and forth from the struggles the young men and women face on the ground to the intrigues that threaten to overwhelm those left aboard the space station. Trying to pull this off can be tricky but the writers and producers of 'The 100' manage to do so without a hitch and should be applauded for doing so.
The cast, headed by Eliza Taylor and Bob Morley, is unusually strong for an ensemble series: There are no weak links. Paige Turco, Thomas McDonell and Henry Ian Cusick especially stood out for me.
This first season is also unusual in the fact that not everyone - including some of the main characters - survives. Two of the juveniles, in fact, don't even live through the landing. Their deaths set the tone for the season and add a touch of realism to the narrative: Earth is a dangerous place and the challenges these young people face are daunting.
I thoroughly enjoyed this first season, am really looking forward to the second one - always assuming network executives don't kill it off - and highly recommend it to sci-fi fans.",1427587200,,2116,4.737127371273712
6202486,4,B00HS2OWNO,"""The 100"" is about 100 young people who are expelled from an orbiting space station back down to earth. These last inhabitants of earth have found refuge on this space station which encircles a radiated planet earth, but as air and food resources are diminishing there is a need to cull the inhabitants of the space station. This is a place where harsh penalties are dealt out to those who disobey the law, which usually means being jettisoned out into space. I've enjoyed the nonstop action and the various twists as one never knows what is going to happen to these survivors from one moment to the next. Sometimes it seems that one is never allowed to breath as there is one challenge after another, which includes internal strife, as well as the discovery and conflicts with inhabitants of the earth who have survived on a planet earth that now seems mostly free of the harmful effects of radiation. The special effects are top notch and so is the acting. I had some doubts about the show early on but have thoroughly enjoyed it right into the second season. The tone and style of the show reminds me somewhat of the new Battlestar Galactica with its dark, and hard hitting approach. It doesn't shy away from a realistic violence that wouldn't be out of place in shows like Game of Thrones or Walking Dead. I also enjoyed the way the show was structured in this first season as we go back and forth between the mostly adult group left on the space ship and and the younger people on earth, as each acts as foils of the other, with comparisons made between an established society and one that is just learning to begin from scratch. There may be some comparisons made here too with the movie/book called ""Lord of the Flies"", which portrays the violence that ensues when a group of young people are stranded on an island. All in all an excellent show that never lets up, where from one moment to the next we never know how people and situations will evolve, where we often don't know who can be trusted or how each individual will respond on any given day to any given challenge as everyone's limits of endurance are tested in this world of relationships that is ever shifting and evolving. This is the presentation of humankind at the brink of extinction trying to find a way to survive with often their greatest enemy being  the enemy within themselves.

There is audio commentary by the creators on the season's final episode as well as special features about the behind the scenes, and a 2013 San Diego comic-con panel discussion with the creators and some of the primary actors, as well as some deleted scenes.",1427500800,,2616,4.587606837606837

6202491,1,B00HS2OWNO,"I stopped watching TV/Cable programs back in 2001 and I'm so glad I did! WoW!  If you love blood and guts flying everywhere you will love The 100! The violence was shocking and way over the top.  The 100 graphically shows someone severing the Carotid artery in a person's throat! A psychotic teen brutally murdering a totally unsuspecting  and innocent teen by slicing his Carotid artery while calmly talking to him. But there's lots more: A graphic display of body parts from a crash scene. A teen shooting his elected leader at point blank range, People being executed over ridiculous crimes, Graphic scenes of death from a bombing. Mass death by suffocation. Gruesome wounds and lots and lots of blood.

I realize most people's lives are incredibly boring and this kind of television is supposed to be exciting. I mean you never say hello to your neighbors. You're terrified of uttering a single word to a stranger out of fear they might actually want to say something back to you. You're too lazy to vote in most political elections. You don't even read except for what's required for work or school. So you race home, throw on the boob tube and get to feel how lucky you are by watching junk like The 100! At least my safe, self-imposed boring life is not dangerous or risky in the slightest!

Or, maybe, you have become so numb and so desensitized that you could care less about the suffering of others. You actually enjoy seeing all this graphic violence and pain. It makes you feel alive because you don't feel alive in the real world!

God forbid if the makers of The 100 had to leave anything to the imagination that doesn't have to do with sex or excrement! Our society for all it's technical advancement and incredible wealth is quite sick when such pessimistic television like The 100 has become the norm. I'm so glad that I watch programs, like Star Trek, which is actually optimistic about the future!

I'd be all for shows like The 100 if it got people motivated to make the world a better place! Who in their right mind wants the future to turn out this way? But since titillation is all most people want then I vote for people to go to an AA-type support group to deal with their addiction to violence, pessimism and titillation from watching other people's pain!",1427155200,4,2281,4.603448275862069

6202522,4,B00HS2OWNO,"AD 2149. Ninety-seven years after a nuclear war devastated the Earth, more than two and a half thousand people live in refuge on an orbiting space station, the Ark. With life support beginning to fail, the ruling council of the Ark decides to see if Earth is survivable by sending down a hundred criminals. As adult criminals are executed to save food and air, this means sending down young delinquents.

As the hundred exiles fight to survive on Earth - and later against the other survivors they discover living in the woods - the inhabitants of the Ark also fall into an internal power struggle as it becomes clear that the station cannot support them for much longer, and not everyone can survive to make it to the ground.

The 100 is a post-apocalyptic drama that seems to take great delight in its inspirations: the show comes across as the result of a collision between Battlestar Galactica, Lost, The Hunger Games and Fallout. The show adroitly fuses its inspirations in fun and original ways and ends up being a lot more entertaining than it has any right being, but it does take a little while to get there.

The show is the product of American network The CW, famed its glossy productions featuring preposterously photogenic young actors engaging in life-and-death struggles whilst also trying to straighten out their elaborately complicated love lives. The 100 somehow manages to turn this tendency up to 11: characters angst about their personal relationships almost at the same level they worry about starvation, dehydration, being impaled by spears and radiation sickness, all of which are constant and simultaneous threats. This would risk being silly, except for the odd hints that the writers are deliberately sending up this aspect of the network's shows. The series also gets away with it because it is also one of the most surprisingly brutal television shows on air. Game of Thrones and The Walking Dead have made shocking main character deaths more accepted on cable, but for a more youth-oriented series The 100 is startlingly bleak. We get population counts for both the exiles on the ground and the survivors on the Ark and both numbers drop at a rate of knots as the season progresses and the writers gleefully take an axe (or gun, or airlock, or plague, or in one highly memorable moment, a giant metal shuriken thing) to the cast.

The show gets off to a mixed start, being both unafraid to kill over apparently major players from the off but also unleashing some of the most ham-fisted, expositionary and clumsy writing you'll see on television all year. Characters initially come across as being very archetypal (or, if you're less kind, cliched as hell) and the actors initially seem unsure how to handle the material they are given. Henry Ian Cusick, in his first major TV role since playing Desmond on Lost, is both saddled with a dubious accent and some poor characterisation and can only respond by hamming it up for the first few weeks. Dialogue is poor and little reason is given for us to care about any of these characters.

Fortunately, that changes and fairly quickly. By the sixth episode the writers have added a lot of ambiguity and (relative) complexity to the characters, the actors have much more layered material to work with and the show becomes a bit more experimental, not afraid to ditch half the cast for a week or two in favour of flashbacks to add depth and backstory. The writers also become quite good at creating internal conflict within the characters, giving them more to do than just stand around and look pretty.

This is helped by some fairly intense pacing. The series is uninterested in adopting a format and sticking with it, with shifts in factions, locations and motivations taking place on a near-weekly basis. The initial split between the ground and the space station is well-handled, despite it occasionally feeling like you're watching episodes of Lost and BSG that have been fan-spliced together (the presence of actors from both shows - particularly BSG - not helping). When our heroes on the ground find a mysterious hatch in the forest (albeit one that opens immediately and not after a tediously-drawn out 16-episode struggle) and characters in orbit wrestle with their consciences as they have to ration supplies and blast a traitor out of the airlock, The 100 feels like it is risking becoming a parody of those other series. However, the show then moves into other territory, becoming more confident and forging its own path. The season finale, which not so much changes the premise as drives a bulldozer through it and then burns down the remains, is the most game-changing cliffhanger in a series in recent times.

The actors are, for the most part, likable. The younger castmembers bring enthusiasm and gumption, although some are more experienced than others (Eliza Taylor did her time in the trenches of Australian daytime soap opera). More veteran actors are used to populate the Ark and, after that initial writing hurdle in the first few episodes, are great. However, the show's flirtation with killing off Chancellor Jaha gets a little old. Clearly they realised that Isaiah Washington is too good to off so easily, but it'd be better if they stopped putting him in near-death situations every other week. The weak spot is the handling of romance, which is trite. Octavia (Marie Avgeropoulos) and Lincoln (Ricky Whittle) fall in love without exchanging a word (although later on they do manage to earn it back), whilst the budding romance between Clarke (Taylor) and Finn (Thomas McDonell) is hamstrung by the utter lack of any chemistry at all between the two actors. Fortunately the writers seem to cotton onto this and use it to their advantage later on. As the season progresses there is also less time for teen stuff as the prospect of all-out war rears its head and some new, more enigmatic enemies enter the fray.

For its first season, The 100 (***) starts off pretty poor but improves rapidly to become a solidly entertaining show. The writing starts out clumsy and the dialogue jarring, but it gets better. The characters become a lot more interesting and conflicted and the show gleefully subverts audience expectations at almost every turn. Certainly worth a look, especially as the second season so far has been a big improvement.",1424908800,3,6334,4.891061452513966

6202526,5,B00HS2OWNO,"Based on reviews I read, I decided to try this series out. I ended up really liking it. Like others have said, wait to make up your mind until you have gotten a few episodes into the series. The story line itself is plausible. I think we are often our own worst enemies and given the situation presented, I bet something similar would happen is this were real. On the flip side, I think what the youth show is also likely to happen. Given a tremendously difficult situation and we will often prevail. Many have written about the story line, so I won't bother to do that. What I will say is that this is a series worth checking out. It is hard to describe the genre. It's a little sci-fi, a little drama and mostly a tale about what you would do given crazy circumstances in the post-nuclear war ravished world we call home. It's less about what happened and more about how to survive and thrive.",1424649600,,895,4.333333333333333

6202568,5,B00HS2OWNO,"First, let me say that I am a fan of horror and science fiction. I love the Walking Dead not only for the gore and zombies, but also for the interactions between people, exploring how far people will go to survive.

I've watched a few of the CW's shows. Arrow and the Flash are two of my favorites currently, but the rest of the CW shows... are huge misses for me. Too much silly teen drama. When I heard about this show, I thought I'd put it on the DVR and give it a chance since the premise was interesting. My husband and I watched the pilot and were sort of interested, but not enough to sit down and watch it regularly on television. Then, I had forgotten about it until I saw season 1 pop up on Netflix. Figuring I had nothing better to watch, I'd watch this.

Wow, was I pleasantly surprised!

I'm not saying that there isn't the stupid teen drama--which there is--but it's kept to a minimum, and much of it actually makes sense. On top of that, the characters actually react to the drama in a mature way, which is a great example for teens watching. It shows minorities in positions of power and as positive role models (although there are still some problems from a social justice POV, it's much better than many shows out there). Some of the science is a little laughable. A little bit. And that's all the negatives I can think of.

The positives, for me and keep in mind that I like horror, is that it's action packed and this show pulls no punches. It shocked me more than a few times, and I had to double check, ""This isn't AMC? This is the CW? Really?!"" The pilot had me interested, the second episode roused my curiosity, and by the end of the third episode I was hooked. The acting is pretty strong, and the sets are beautiful. What CGI there is is decent. The action is definitely there, and it seems like every episode there was a new reveal, which not only kept the plot moving, far from becoming stagnant, but also kept me interested to see what was next. It's gritty, and yet it's real enough... because teens occupy that middle space between acting childish and acting mature, and the script and actors do a good job of walking that fine line. Yeah, you smack your forehead a few times thinking, ""Wow, they're really doing that"" but at other times, you can see these kids growing up and making hard, sometimes impossible choices.

All that being said, I do have to give a warning about the violence. There is a LOT of it. It's a drama, yes, but it's a survival drama, and people do some pretty bad things to stay alive. People react badly to situations. One situation early on snowballed out of hand so fast it was almost unbelievable... except it wasn't. It was a mob situation, and things like that happen in real life. Bad things happen, and bad things happen to people who don't deserve them. So, if you are not a fan of violence or gore (and there's a lot of gore in this--I had to check repeatedly that the CW put it out), this may not be the show for you.",1420588800,,2984,4.321428571428571
6202569,5,B00HS2OWNO,It has some really unexpected cliffhangers. Kind of reminds me of Lost a little. Really love it though. Keeps you on your toes wanting to see what happens next.,1420502400,,160,4.551724137931035

Does this depiction actually reflect today's youth? I hope not, because neither the teens nor the imbecilic adults who sent them on the preposterous mission, deserve to survive.

6202588,3,B00HS2OWNO,"There's some derp factor to this series that I find hard to swallow as a hard SF fan

There are some glaringly implausible elements to the plotline:

1. I'm assuming space stations originally constructed for scientific research in the late 21st century would have some kind of spectrographic capability, or just a birds eye view of foliage returning and fallout clearing. Moreover, the station residents seem to have some limited manufacturing capacity, and are still capable of atmospheric re-entry, and yet they have never sent probes to the surface? The need to send a bunch of idiotic teenagers/unreliable delinquents to the planet in order to determine its habitability is therefore completely unnecessary, and inane.
2. Even if the above was withstanding, there's a question in my mind as to why they didn't send these 100 with a more sophisticated form of communication than wrist transponders that monitor vital signs, or otherwise someone they could control who could be counted on to report back to the station. How idiotic was that?
3. The teen drama. You would think teenagers growing up on a space station would be like little astronauts, accustomed to duty, rank, and procedure. Kids grow up fast when they're given responsibility and made aware of their life or death circumstances. Instead, they behave like your typical 1st world brats. Again, how idiotic is that?
4. The teens start taking off their wrist bands and the rather dense scientists on the station can only conclude that the radiation is killing these rebellious youths, rather than also considering the possibility that the brats are removing their wrist bands because, you know, they're rebellious and were exiled for that very reason. Speaking of the wristbands, is there an explanation as to why they made these bracelets so easy to take off?

That said, there is some real Lord of the Flies potential to this series. Unfortunately, it's severely hampered by the shallow absurdities of its plot and unimaginative characters.

Rather than catering to a YAF style youth narcissism typical of teen drama, and making characters seem too contemporary in their attitudes, I would have preferred more realism in the show. People are complex, the world is full of complex decisions, and people who have lived through lifelong deprivation are a lot more cynical and hard edged than characters in this show indicate. Could someone please hurry up and write some hard science fiction that captures realism and has believable characters?",1419120000,3,2508,5.124694376528117
6202589,1,B00HS2OWNO,"Poor execution of a good idea, as others have said. I couldn't even get through two episodes. They basically took a bad, American 1980's high school drama and set it in the forest ""in the future."" It's the usual Bullies vs. Nerds scenario, but the bullies are so incredibly stupid that they don't think that finding food is a good idea??? Come on. Even the stupidest of individuals will be foraging for food as soon as they get hungry - within four hours or so. They somehow manage to build a bonfire and survive without food for two days without ____anyone____ except the three main characters suggesting that maybe it would be a good idea to look for food as a group?

6202599,2,B00HS2OWNO,"I tried to like this series. It has a pretty interesting format. But once the 100 got on the ground I couldn't stop rolling my eyes. I am not going to repeat exactly what happened since it has already been explained many times, this is  just things that jumped out at me and kind of rubbed me the wrong way.
A. The kids on the ground are complete morons. You just crash landed on a planet that you are unfamiliar with and all you want to do is party. Right.
B. When they killed the black kid that from the beginning didn't do wrong to anyone. And the response was pretty much Ehh, stuff happens.. He was my best friend since birth so let me go have sex. RIP.
C. I find it hard to like any of the 100. I mostly root for the grounders because the 100 are so annoying.  If you look it from the Grounders point of view they are trespassers. They have been in this region for lord knows how many years and the 100 drop from the sky trying to run things. I would fight them to. Oddly reminds me of the Cowboys and Native Americans of  the West.  Their ancestors left the earth and left these people behind. While they were relaxing on the space station the Grounder's ancestors were probably being born deformed and acclimating to a new hostile environment.
D.  And finally you have all of North America to choose from. MOVE. You have hostiles around you but you don't live on a space station anymore. You can move to any locale you want an create your own Utopia. You made a shanty town right around the corner from hostile territory, pull up your trash and move it somewhere that my be more hospitable.  So I watched the first season but I doubt I will continue.

6202617,3,B00HS2OWNO,Really? This show has so many flaws I don't know where to begin. I guess no body pay attention to the intro where there was 12 nation had space stations then they got together to create the Ark.  But somehow only Americans left to have it all. And  nuclear holocaust did not teach anything to these survivors they still on each other's throat. Teenagers worse than ever and they kept in prison until 18 so they can execute them by kicking them out to space. Well if they can't rule a small space station I don't think they deserve to restart the human society. Cause is already lost. I was able to endure 3 episodes but this is a science fiction without science. All those children who was born in the space station had no difficulty adjusting earth atmosphere and gravity. And they able cook and eat a wild cat with no rejection. I tell you this. If you like teenage soap opera this is a show for you.

6202629,5,B00HS2OWNO,"This is a surprisingly good show. I won't usually put any money into entertainment because frankly I'm poor and I know all too well how quickly a good show can suck me in and become yet another financial drain. Point is, I'm super picky and I read reviews usually before even trying out a free pilot episode. The pilot for ""The 100"" isn't free, so I was twice as leery. I also read in one of the reviews that the show contained a lot of cliche teenage rebellion, and I thought, ""Oh crap I can do without another 'teens can't get along' bs festival."" I did however like the show's premise, and it has had quite a lot of good reviews, so I went with the pilot and liked it well enough to keep going. Desmond Hume, a guy that looks like Miles Dyson, and Felix Gaeta and Ellen Tigh in space! Well, arguably Ellen Tigh and Felix Gaeta just basically went back to space. I guess with Desmond in on things, it almost kinda makes it.... LOST IN SPACE! Ha ha ahhhh, lol so...

The basic plot is, humanity has for whatever reason gone to war with nuclear weapons and made the earth uninhabitable. The survivors of the war left the planet to live in orbit onboard 12 space stations belonging to various countries. When resources became scarce enough, the 12 stations were united and built together into one very large station called ""The Ark"", which is the last, most desperate hope of humanity. The plan was to stay in orbit until the Earth became survivable again, but increasingly poor conditions onboard the Ark are forcing things to move faster than anyone wanted, and a return to Earth must be pushed sooner rather than later before even doing that becomes impossible. Enter ""The 100"", a group of 100 juvenile criminals that can be easily sacrificed in a test of Earth's ability to sustain life, by sending them to the ground in a drop ship... a one way ticket to a new but completely unknown future. Meanwhile, aboard the Ark, things are worse than are being made known, and the ever more desperate situation begins to spiral out of control.

Anyway, I'm glad I stayed with it. The teens of course keep on doing dumb things but they become less and less dumb as things progress, which is realistic enough and is good for plot development. The kids are in a situation that is endlessly threatening, and we get to see them growing up fast in order to survive the next danger. Meanwhile, on board The Ark, things are disintegrating fast and there's enough action going on right there alone to keep things interesting. The acting is more than good enough on the primary characters. The effects are a little bit over the top here and there but overall really good and the sets are great. I was particularly impressed with the sweeping, woodland ground scenery and the more epic scenes of destruction in space. Nicely done, just every now and then physics goes on vacation just a little bit. No big, lots of shows go way off the map all the time. Also, the kids somehow always seem to conveniently run into each other out in the middle of this HUGE expanse of woodland, often times in the dark and on the run. They're like freakin ants... they stay in touch by pheromone trails or something. Easy enough to suspend the disbelief on, I suppose, but sometimes I couldn't help but laugh out loud and say ""Oh hi, fancy meeting you here!"" lol.

Anyway x 2, I got hooked easily enough and burned through the whole first season in a couple of days. I liked the season finale quite a lot, great storywriting and the acting just keeps getting better. Bunch of bad kids growing up fast from reckless idiots to rag-tag guerrilla soldiers, and characters that you figured would stay basically a-hole losers growing up into respectable leaders and vital parts of the group. I'm kinda anxious to see when they eventually meet up with the surviving adults from the Ark and tell them that they're in charge, because pretty much I feel they're earning that right.

One thing... This isn't really a feel good family show, and that's a big part of why I like it. There's hordes of violence, lots of people with disturbing injuries, kids killing other kids, adults killing kids, kids killing adults, and basically every ugly theme getting explored from a more or less ""Lord of the Flies"" kind of environment on the ground to people on the Ark being ejected into space (called ""being floated"", isn't that pretty...), ALIVE AND UNPROTECTED, as punishment for crimes for the good of the remaining human population. It's not a kids show at all, and there are plenty of scenes that will make you cringe or break your heart. Just bear that in mind. If you're looking for a good sci-fi post apocalyptic adventure type show with a mature sort of feel, this is a good place to start. Enjoy! And don't even think about doing what you're thinking of doing or they'll float you! ;-)

6202650,4,B00HS2OWNO,"This show is worth buying into, or at least giving a try, if you like high-concept and/or science fiction television. Think of it as a blend of Battlestar Galactica, the Hunger Games, and The Walking Dead. I am very impressed with the technical aspects and the ambition at work here. The sets, locations, props and visual effects are all quite good. I'm not forgetting about the story/character elements, but I just want to say right up front that this show does not look or feel cheap. It may not be Battlestar Galactica, but it does feel like a younger sibling of that show in some ways.

The story/premise is really compelling--humans have been living in an orbital space station for a century in the aftermath of nuclear apocalypse, and now one hundred juvenile convicts are sent down to the surface. It's a good enough setup with enough possibilities for interesting stories that it overcomes some of the more cliched individual beats and the fact that most of the characters look like typical CW types. The cast is a mixed bag, but decent on the whole and fortunately Eliza Taylor is a terrific lead.

I would also point out that this show is willing to be confront fairly graphic matters for a CW show. I tend to ignore most of what I perceive as ""generic young adult dramas"" but heard that this one involves a space station. There are too few shows with that sort of space-based sci-fi included, these days.

Fact is, I was really quite tepid in my interest, and the offer to charge me $2.99 for each episode just put me off.

Review:

Story:

I believe the story was done extremely well and I give props to CW for always coming out with Superb shows as for the story it goes like this 97 years after the Earth is ravaged by Nuclear Warfare the people on board the Ark send 100 criminals down to Earth to see if it is survivable. I like how it's really two stories in one show because they show the story of what is happening to ""The 100"" on Earth and also what is going on in space on the ""Ark"" and they handle it with great finesse.

Acting:

The acting was top-notch especially since I only recognized a few actors and the rest I had never even seen or heard of before but they handled there parts with great precision and really brought out the heartfelt moments in the season.

Action:

I will say in my opinion that this is where the first season blew me away was in its action. I was never sitting there bored there is always action in every episode and twists and turns at every bend of each episode as well. I love how they incorporate different factions into the series and I will not say any more on that topic. All in all the action is Insane and Unpredictable in the best way possible.

Verdict:

I would recommend this show to anyone and everyone who loves Sci-Fi and End of the World style shows. I was excited even before I started watching this show and after finishing the 1st season I'm blown away by the whole concept and everything that went into this show and I can't wait to start Season 2 later today!!!!! 10 out of 10.",1414368000,2,1644,4.226837060702875

Sure, lets have them do that with predators around. :/ And  then the constant change in who or what to  believe is aggravating.

That being said, the show is fun and very interesting, and I'm a sucker for Post-apocalyptic, bandit-filled, Fallout/MadMax survival stories. The story is very good, lots of fun and dark enough to be tense at times. The dialogue and character development are pretty bad, sometimes makes me angry because I feel insulted by how dumbed-down the dialogue is (your viewers are for the most part not morons, and have far more sophisticated standards then you seem to believe, team The 100).
But its a show I enjoy, its just good enough to keep me watching and I'm not that easily hooked...so its got good things going for it. I'd like to see this coming season have more mature writing and character development.

I would add that having watched it for free, it was okay, I'm not sure that I'd feel that way if I had payed to watch it.",1411862400,,464,4.054347826086956
6202694,2,B00HS2OWNO,"Wow! Where to begin with this show. I bought this on a whim since Amazon has been suggesting it to me for months, and the reviews were mostly positive. I love scifi and have a guilty pleasure for teen dramas, so I figured it would at least keep me entertained. However, what followed were so many cringeworthy moments I literally laughed out loud by myself at how ridiculous it all wasn

The premise was interesting enough. The earth was destroyed by nuclear war rendering it uninhabitable. This resulted in a small population able to flee to the various space stations to wait it out until earth could be repopulated. Sounds good to me so far.

It gets pretty laughable early on though. The whole idea of sending 100 juvenile prisoners to ""test the waters"" is ludicrous. Even if you just wanted them gone you would at least send along, I don't know, scientists,  doctors, and technicians. It just made no sense that you would drop them in the middle of nowhere to search for some supposed stash of goods left 100 years earlier. It would be far more plausible to drop them in what was once a major metropolitan area where buildings would still be standing for shelter and the possibility of endless resources that could be plundered from abandoned houses such as technology and food. Many structures on earth could stand for more than 100 years even without maintenance,  but I guess they couldn't afford the sets so we get forrest.

The actions of the teens once on the ground is so comical that it renders any concern for their plight mute. They pretty much immediately resort to killing each other??? OK?? Once finally back in touch with the ark, the main girl throws a teen tantrum and refuses to talk to her mom after the whole focus of the show up to that point was to contact the ark. It was just way, way too much teen angst to take any of it seriously given their circumstances. It might work for gossip girl,  but not a show that wants to be taken as serious scifi.

The dialog is horrendous. It's mostly all exposition, and obvious setups for the next scene.  "" hey notice there isn't any animals around"".  Then guess what shows up in the very next scene - yeah an animal. Just bad.

The actors are about what you expect in teen drama. Some are good, some are bad, but they would have been adequate with a decent script.  When you couple young inexperienced actors with horrible writing it's just too hard to overcome.

Frankly, I could give multiple examples from every episode that are hilariously bad, but I won't.

I did find the stories on the ark to be somewhat interesting which was the only thing that kept me going. However, it just wasn't good enough to get past all the idiocy going on on the ground.  And it's not just because it's teen drama. I love shows like pretty little liars and the vampire diaries that can actually make teens seem smarter than first graders and have decent dialog.

6202698,5,B00HS2OWNO,"Apparently, many people only watched 1 episode and then wrote a review.  So, they missed all the agonizing decisions and sacrifices that are made by both the juveniles and the adults on the Ark.  They also totally misunderstood the characters.  Sure, some are stupid, but the leaders, Bellamy and Clark and even Octavia, are not criminals. Octavia was imprisoned just for being born since no person was allowed to have more than one child.  Bellamy, her brother, is an older, trained security officer that snuck on board to watch after Octavia, and Clark was imprisoned because she knew a major secret - the fact that the Ark is dying.  Her mother, who is a high profile doctor, wanted her on board the drop ship so she could possibly survive.  Clark has a lot of medical training that she learned from her mother, and even Monty and Jasper have some superior skills at engineering and farming techniques.  They were just stupid enough to grow some ""improper plants"" and got caught.  Finn wasn't a criminal either.  He supposedly took an illegal ""spacewalk"" that used too much oxygen and was stuck in prison for it. There is more to it, but I won't spoil it for you.  So, all the juveniles are not just idiot criminals. There is a lot of intrigue, suspense, and eventual heartbreak that make the show dramatic and leaves you wanting more. My husband even likes it and he is not a big fan of science fiction shows.  There are constant surprises that keep the storyline fresh as well.  I look forward to season two.

Why couldn't Bellamy go with his sister and her grounder Beau when they ran off to parts unknown? I guess because we needed that overly dramatic and slightly hookey parting scene.

6202714,1,B00HS2OWNO,"Some of the worst characters ever written for tv.

Set in the future, 97 years after a nuclear holocaust on earth. The survivors live in a massive space station that's running out of supplies. Crime, any crime is punishable by death - unless you're under 18.

They don't know if the earth is liveable again (apparently they can't send a probe down, or an expedition). Instead they select 100 prisoners (one assumes they're all about 18 or younger) and drop them on the planet.

Here's where the first idiots appear. On the way down several think it's a good idea to get out of their harnesses. They float for a while till the vessel hits the atmosphere. Gravity takes over and 2 dead already.

The vessel lands off course. They know that there's an under-mountain supply dump. Landing in a forest only five decide it would be a good idea to go to that supply dump and get food. The others all build a massive bonfire and party chanting slogans about not having to follow anyone's rules - so mere survival (like food, shelter) is not even in their collective thinking.

Of the five, one strips near a river and jumps in - a totally gratuitous gesture for the target teen audience. She is attacked by some mutant eel. They 'distract' the eel simply by rolling a small rock into the water. The eel gives up it's prey and goes to see what made a splash. Even the eels are totally stupid.

That's just the first episode.",1410134400,26,1415,4.4863813229571985

It's a good story, there are lovely moments of original sights and interaction, everyone in my house (adults and teens) liked watching it and we're eagerly awaiting season 2.  Please, please, more imaginative changes to life on earth, I liked what little they did have and it wasn't overdone, but I'd like some more thinking and creative writing on HOW these circumstances would change things - how might animals and plants have evolved up to the point this happened and how might they have changed because of it?

6202718,4,B00HS2OWNO,"""The 100"" tells a futuristic narrative about young adults surviving on a once abandoned and devastated Earth.  The series' ecology encompasses a waning space station that can no longer sustain the lives of its population, therefore self-interested thus manipulative authorities force ""expendable criminals"" off the station by dropping these teenage and twemty-somethings back down to a planet that is likely to be uninhabitable.  The story unfolds to account how the supposed malefactors debate the process of constructing their own society on a now unexplored Earth, while simultaneously discovering a plethora of forces that seek to eradicate or manipulate the young adults.  Based off U.S. history pertaining to the hardships endured during the era of colonial America, coupled to modern day economic and political science analysis of the Earth's: diminishing resources, global population growth, as well as an increase in the pursuit of anarchy; ""The 100"" holds social commentary that gives viewers substance to muse upon.

Acting ability is fair; the young actors and actresses are not seasoned in their skills but they are proficient enough to carry out the story's events without making a viewer cringe.  Adults are the best at delivering believable acting; therefore ""The 100"" has a nice balance in its levels of acting skill.  The reviewer's own personal favor for certain cast is not actually for the main heroine; for the actress is simply so-so in her acting ability and her character is not as moral as some of the supporting characters.  The reviewer is far more drawn to the heroine Octavia Blake: that character's counterpart actress Marie Avgeropoulos is better at acting thus she is quite alluring--fingers crossed that Marie's character at least makes it through another season, but it would be ideal if Octavia Blake survives the whole series (possibly takes over command from the main heroine for Octavia is truly the best person to lead and govern the new society).

As a whole; ""The 100"" is a four star show because its narrative and social commentary is captivating, but sometimes it incorporates clichs of a teen drama which slows down the series' plots.  Therefore, ""The 100"" is one of the better sci-fi shows to be seen in the last decade; it has a lot of potential to become an excellent sci-fi series with well thought out and delivered story arcs, coupled to intelligent social commentary--one may refer to the short-lived but ideal series Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles.  Unlike the misogynistic and patriarchal Star Trek that is often repetitive with its episodic nature (one hopes a new series will at least be very successive with a strong story arc), and contrary to Star Wars that is: poorly acted, contains cheesy dialogue, dominated by male characters, and childish (except The Empire Strikes Back which actually is a good story of escaping but not truly overcoming peril); ""The 100"" is good science fiction.

 It aligns to masterpieces like: the novel ""Starship Troopers"", the 1912 novel ""A Princess of Mars"" (which accounts events and descriptions that were written long before Star Wars or Star Trek) as well as its marvelous counterpart the film ""John Carter"", the BBC series ""Doctor Who"", the film ""The Matrix"" (only the first film is a masterpiece because it holds social commentary about Capitalism), and the 2015 film ""Jupiter Ascending"" which compliments ""The Matrix""; for ""Jupiter Ascending"" clearly holds smart social commentary about global Capitalism coupled to the rise of a U.S. oligarchy.
Viewers in search of good science fiction that has potential to better itself; can find intelligent science fiction in ""The 100"".",1409616000,,3681,5.209813874788494

However, the main characters are bland, no personality, sub-par acting at best, and the best actors and the most talented actors in the show are forced into the background as a supporting character every couple episodes with a few lines here and there with a few words. Maybe one or two shining moments a season, not to steal the spotlight from the boring main characters and their boring dialouge and clumsy decisions, where you feel like checking Facebook and Twitter.

6202758,3,B00HS2OWNO,"Update:

Upgrade to three stars. The producers of this show may have had a change of heart. After reports (from a friend) that they were looking to be hard and ""have an edge"" and show the audience ""no one is safe"", the decision was made not to kill off Bellamy or Finn. He wouldn't say what inspired this change of attitude but I'm hoping it was the incessant questioning about what will happen with Bellamy and Clark during the weeks after the finale aired. It looks as though they just might allow the audience to fall in love with a group of characters (in a non-sexy way) and follow them through to the end, whoever dies around them, even if it isn't realistic that our favorites would all survive. Here's hoping.

Original:

This is another one of those brilliant shows, easy to fall in love with, pulling you in and dazzling you week after week until you are fully addicted, written by fools who lack to capacity for long term character study. This is one of those shows you watch and love until you realize they are going to start killing off the main characters, one by one, until you just can't be bothered anymore.

I used to love The Walking Dead. I used to love Sons of Anarchy. I used to like Game of Thrones. I used to watch a lot of TV. Now, I watch movies and old shows on Blu-ray and I'm a lot happier, far less annoyed and, according to those closest to me, far less cranky. What's changed? I'm no longer in constant mourning. (Skip to the last paragraph at this point, if you wish to avoid the explanation of my journey to giving up on television.)

I stopped watching The Walking Dead, because everyone I really cared about was, well, dead. Daryl and Rick were still alive, for the time being, but, given what happens on long-term programs of this type, they probably won't stay that way. When actors get their first round of skin cancers, as all that sunscreen can't cope with the endless sweat, dirt applications and even misty sprays of blood and fake sweat they apply between takes, they leave. When their wives or children suffer health crisis after personal crisis after family issue after job/school issue, enough becomes enough and the actor asks to leave. If nearly every major character has died and been replaced, what happens when the remaining leads realize this isn't how they want to spend the rest of their lives? What happens when ye ole British guy realizes he's sick of spending so much time in America? What happens when either one of them (as the oldest action-oriented cast members) gets a diagnosis of arthritis? I'll tell you, the writers will kill off another beloved character and you it won't even bother you because you, like me, are numb to it at this point. I didn't even cry the last few times and then I knew, I have to let this one go.

I stopped watching Sons of Anarchy after Opie, well, you know. There was this moment when I realized, this show about two brothers (surrogates though they were) was over. Their story had ended. It didn't matter what happened to the club or the members or the town because the story had reached the end, the brother failed and got the other one, well, you know. I realized they would start killing the upper echelon of main characters now, the primaries, the kings and queens. I told a friend, who loved the show too, and he insisted it would never happen. One year later he called and said ""they just killed two of the four main characters and I'm never watching this garbage again"". I said, ""I didn't see it happen so, in my mind, it never did."" He said he wished he hadn't seen it and mentioned something about a barbeque fork and a staged massacre and shooting a guy so many times it didn't even hurt to watch anymore and I said, ""I told you so"" and never looked back.

I stopped watching Game of Thrones because I realized I didn't actually care about anyone and was already, basically, expecting them to die. At the end of the first season, a man lost his head and I said, aloud, ""finally"". I liked that character and yet, to my horror, felt he had lived too long. I watched a character die who was played by an actor from one of my favorite science fiction programs (I know, its not as good as BSG but it was still a really good show). As he lay there, I thought to myself, if he had died on this other show, I would have cried my eyes out, I would have fallen apart, I would have yelled at the TV, ""Rodney, do something!"" and left the room. I felt nothing watching him die on Game of Thrones, absolutely nothing. I think that, somehow, I already knew that pretty much everyone on this show was going to die, even though I hadn't read the books and didn't really know anything about them. For whatever reason, from whatever source, my unconscious mind reached the conclusion that it isn't worth all the added pain for a fan who becomes genuinely attached to characters to suffer as they suffer and die before my eyes. It had worked to protect me by just not allowing me to give a giving a flying anything, and, because I never really cared to begin with, I didn't miss the characters when I stopped watching. I didn't miss the show. I didn't even remember their names.

I stopped watching pretty much everything because I found myself thinking back to Lost and wondering when it was, exactly, that I stopped really caring about the people on the island when I could remember having cared so much. I knew how it would end from the first episode so it wasn't that whole thing everyone got so worked up about after the finale. There was never a moment when I didn't know what they were going for, ultimately, in a religious context and it didn't bother me because the writing was on the wall, as it were. And I wasn't blind to the concept of enlightenment or release so I knew they'd have some deaths, as some characters would find peace and, of course, as some actors decided to leave. All long term shows experience this, when actors say ""okay, I'm done"", and walk away, but there was something else, something had to have changed, because, in Season One, I really cared, really and truly cared, and, by the end of Season Two, I really didn't. Somehow, even with the addition of all of these actors I usually enjoy and even adore in the roles they are playing, I didn't care anymore and I never would again, for years of my life, for the whole of show, for every painfully unimportant episode, and I watched them all.

So what happened? Well, the same thing that just happened to The 100. There was a moment, a tipping point, that instant in which I realized, as an audience member, that this program is just another revolving door of actors and characters I'll either love and lose or never care about in the first place, a show that will be lost on me as a viewer because I'll never be able to connect with the characters and the character arcs and deeper meanings because it won't have character arcs and deeper meanings. In Lost, it was when Boone was gone and I realized there was no Shannon without Boone and no Locke without Boone and no Jack without Locke and no show without people to care about.... Basically, there was no point to it without that first tragic death because, I knew, I'd always be wondering when they were going to kill Jack or Kate or Sawyer or anyone of a half a dozen main characters who ceased to matter to me after Boone died. And then they killed Shannon and I suddenly felt no empathy for Jack, not only did I not care, I couldn't even experience his emotional turmoil. He was a cardboard cutout to me. It was as though my mind was severing affection for the character out of realization that no one was safe and I'd never be able to count on the vicarious experience you get as a viewer through the lens of the life of specific characters because those characters were uncertain and there was no way to pick the ones who would survive in order to obtain full enjoyment of the show.

And so, back to The 100, the writers and their mouthpiece at Comic Con San Diego just made every statement they could, short of yelling out Bellamy and Finn are dead or at least one of them is, in order to convince us that no one is safe and we shouldn't get comfortable and everything is up for grabs and it is a show about survival, not people and their relationships and personal stories and, essentially, every insulting clich you have ever heard from a showrunner attempting to explain the lack of continuity on their program that we are all going to get in the upcoming season and, of course, the ever revolving door of talent that will waft through the series for however brief a time it is on. When they killed off, well I won't ruin it for you, let's just call her Herbig (as in her big brown eyes), I began to wonder.... When they killed off, well, again..., let's just call her the First Lady of the Cylon, I started to worry.... When they did their whole big bang, I thought, ""Ooh, Finn and Bellamy on the run, having to work together to survive. There's a good plot for the first half of season two. Maybe this show won't screw itself out of an audience after all."" But, when I watched the Comic Con disaster that was the showrunner opening his mouth and letting words out, and I don't even know his name, I didn't think anything because I could feel, in real time, inside of me, as my affection for each and every character on this show just disappeared. Eliza Kane opened her mouth about how she and Bellamy (played by Bob Morley) were never meant to have chemistry and that is just something the fans latched onto but was unintentional and the show isn't about their relationships with each other but, rather, the survival of the human race as a group, and I sank inside. I dropped into a pool of not giving a you know what about what happens to any of them. This show was about a brother and sister, Bellamy and Octavia, and a young woman who lost her father to the most horrific set of circumstances which somehow involved all of the people she held dear. It was about the adventure of their descent onto the surface of a planet they thought uninhabitable. It was about their journey, together and as individuals. Now, post Comic Con, it is about a bunch of kids dying off one by one until no one is watching anymore. So, if you don't want to end up numb like me, go back and watch Battlestar Galactica again. Of the main characters, nearly all remained the focus of the series throughout and were still alive in the end. The ones that weren't, were each gone for a reason and the producers and writers made absolutely certain you would feel it, without losing your ability to feel for the characters who remained. When they landed on Earth, (not a spoiler since that is the whole point laid out in the pilot), when the last person died who was ever going to die in the series, I wept for nearly twenty minutes, my empathy and bond of vicarious living both fully intact. Don't get me wrong, if you can watch a program like The Walking Dead and somehow maintain feeling for the victims of the apocalypse as you did during season one, without that ever increasing numbness overwhelming you by the fifth major cast member's demise, first, I am truly envious of you and wish I could maintain that level of investment after my favorites are gone. Also, lucky you. Finally, I think you would probably enjoy this program. If not for the cast changes and deaths, this would be an amazing program. Of course, these could just be the most foolish writers/producers/actors in Hollywood and they could just be trying to convince everyone that some of their favorite characters are dead for some reason I can't understand. Maybe they just want to fool with us and yell surprise at the end of the season premiere. Then again, probably not. They don't seem all that stupid. I think, unfortunately, the main cast is splintered and will soon be replaced by all new people, except, perhaps, for the prettiest girls and the British guy who talk like they're in it for at least this next year. I really liked this one too.",1406937600,6,12033,4.440723981900453

Overall, they convey the sense of urgency and need for survival very well-although almost never agreeing on how to do it!  There are however a couple of points I wanted to make.  First, as regards Clarke and Finn-BAD idea.  He dumps Raven just because he's got 'feelings' for Clarke-and Clarke, knowing this, should tell him to take the proverbial hike.  So now, Finn has neither-and it would serve him right.  Besides, I have another possible 'friend' for Clarke-Bellamy.  Yes, they basically never agree and never get along-but maybe there's a reason for that.

6202801,5,B00HS2OWNO,"Although I'm not a big fan of sci-fi shows, I always found The 100 interesting before it premiered. Maybe because of the main premise, 100 teenagers (who are delinquents) sent to earth which is now radiated and full of dangers to see if it's habitable. But that's just the surface of the series. As the show starts , we get to meet all the characters, the teens that are at Earth, and the adults that are still on space at the Ark. But will dangerous teens do what they are told to do? A war for power begins, the good vs. the bad, which was pretty interesting to see, and then it moves on to amazing plots.
The story starts a little slow and predictable, but then it becomes an addictive rollercoaster of action, blood, gore, twists and even a little bit of love, while all the teens trying to survive and the rest of the adults left at the Ark try to handle their own wars.
Writing gets a little messy (and dumb) at times, but with each episode you always want more of ""The 100"". Filled with good performances, (especially by the lead, Eliza Taylor), you fall in love with all the characters, and the series shows us a solid addictive first season and with the end of season one, I'm definetely watching season 2.

6202804,3,B00HS2OWNO,"Summary:  A group of 100 kids comprised solely of criminals are sent to the earth to see if it is survivable.

The premise is really interesting.  It is really cool that a bunch of kids are sent down to see if the earth is survivable.  It stays cool as long as you don't think about it too hard.

Darn, I started thinking.  While this is a cool setup for a start of a new series, the problems with this premise abound.

Let us start out with the very initial part of the premise, the space stations.  There was a deliberate vagueness about how the people came to be in the space stations.  If it was done on purpose, they would have laid in an adequate supply of back up parts.  They would have also provided ships with sufficient fuel to ferry the survivors back to the planet.  All of these supplies would have taken up a lot of room, which would limit the number of people allowed on the ship.  There was every indication that people would have been sent purposefully to the arks, since food, medicine, and other essential supplies would have run out long ago.  Another interesting aspect was reproduction and old age.  Reproduction was vaguely touched upon.  It was obvious that each family was limited to one child.  It was also obvious that due to a limitation of supplies that a sick child or a child born with a genetic anomaly would not be allowed to live.  What wasn't so obvious was that these parents could not be allowed to further reproduce.  In a closed system, any genetic mutations could have serious repercussions for the system as a whole.  It was also obvious that adults would have an expiration date.  Old age is a suck on resources just like illness.  The reality is that they could have spent a little more time on the ship, and this would have been a much cooler story.

There were also problems that were not touched upon.  Let us start with gravity. Artificial gravity fields take a lot of power to create, and since they do want to return to earth, they would have to make fields that were comparable to earth.  Also, it would be essentially for bone development and growth in their children.  Radiation would also be a problem.  What protects the earth from ionizing and nonionizing radiation that is present in space?  Can you say ozone layer.  While there would be some protection rendered because the ark is still in the upper atmosphere.  The ozone layer would be unlikely to afford much protection-because the space stations would be outside of it.  No protection from the ozone means that this people are daily exposed to radiation from the sun and space.  They would have been more protected on the earth in a hole in the ground.  While these arks are a cool idea, they have a lot of limitations.  You can see why they would want to be vague about living in an ark in space.

We find out that this mission is essential to assess the feasibility of returning to earth.  If the earth isn't survivable, the leadership on the ark will have to make decisions about who will be culled/killed so that the ark will still be able to support life.  Hmmm.... their decision is to send a bunch of kids who are largely comprised of untrained criminals.  They send no supplies with them and no means of communication.  That is such an excellent idea (sarcasm font).  They are provided no Geiger counters or meters to measure ionizing radiation.  Just because you aren't immediately losing your hair doesn't mean the radiation levels are safe.  They have no food and no weapons, and they have no immediate means of acquiring them.  They are directed to an old bunker, but after 97 years, there is no way to ascertain if the supplies are still viable, accessible, or even present.  Let's be honest, only in fiction would you send a team that is untrained and doesn't have the best interests of their community as a motivator to succeed on a mission.  This scenario lacks plausibility.  The show is designed to appeal to young viewers.  It is not designed to be plausible.  It is also designed to have many opportunities for young angst.

The question you have to ask yourself is did the show have to be so stupid just to appeal to young viewers.  Ultimately, the answer would be no.  They knew that they had an insufficient number of pods for the population.  This would immediately remove the right of anyone over reproductive age of going, so this would make the cut-off probably around 35.  That would really be tough, but here comes the tougher part, the really young would also not be able to go.  If you are in a hostile land, small, crying children would be very dangerous.  This would make it unlikely that anyone 5 or under would be going.  It would also be likely that their parents would not be going as well due to their unwillingness to leave their small children.  And there is your 1200 people.

They could have still had young people in the initial party, but they wanted to set up a scenario where there was a lot of mayhem.

Here is the problem, mayhem and angst will only take a show so far, especially a show like this.  After a while, it starts to fizzle because you will only be left with the same mayhem and angst, and warring with the natives gets old fast.

So they landed with no food, weapons, or helpful technology into a hostile world that appears to be rife with mutations.  Umm... if there were this many mutations in just a hundred years, it is likely that there is still a LOT of radiation.  Also, if mammals like deer are mutated, you would also be seeing mutations in humans.  You would also be seeing a LOT of new viruses and bacteria to which the little ark kids would have no immunity.  Oops, just another thing that was not addressed.

Maybe the writers will be able to come up with a lot of new exciting scenarios to keep their audience transfixed, but honestly, I was starting to get very bored of the show.  By the time it had ended this season, it held no more excitement than the pilgrims coming to America and trying to survive.  And truly, the reason outlined for the fighting just felt forced.  Your ship killed some of our people.  I also am getting really tired of their romantic angst.",1404604800,14,6155,4.4986449864498645

Also, what's with not having a proper ambient soundtrack?  The use of pop tunes is comical.  It's like it's amateur hour sci-fi done with the lowest budget possible.

And the strained relationship between Clarke and her mother is very engaging.  The acting for the most part is exceptional.  I've watched these episodes repeatedly and usually when I do that, the delivery goes stale.  No such problem here! The characters ring true and I applaud the performances.
I also really love the story line.  I don't care if its been done before.  And I REALLY don't care if a few things are unrealistic or slightly incongruent.

6202818,4,B00HS2OWNO,"I have to admit, I started watching this show half-expecting to hate it. The idea is well-traveled science-fiction terrain, with last year's 'Oblivion', starring Tom Cruise, being one of the closest and most recent comparison's. But that happens all the time in Hollywood, with nearly identical film concepts racing each other to theaters to end up playing simultaneously: 'Armageddon' and 'Deep Impact', for example, or this year's 'The Double' and 'Enemy', both about emotionally crippled young men who have their lives upended by extroverted doppelgangers. But I thought 'The 100' seemed like a cynical cash-grab counting on fans of 'The Hunger Games' and 'Divergent' to tune in. Well, it certainly will appeal to the same demographic, but this series, based on a book by Kass Morgan, is much more than a cynical cash-grab.
It begins on 'The Ark', where a small remnant of humanity have lived for nearly a century, waiting for the radioactive aftermath of a nuclear holocaust -- which came close to rendering mankind extinct -- to dissipate. As the Ark, a cobbled-together amalgam of various space stations like 'Mir' in geo-stationary orbit, nears the end of it's life-expectancy, the ruling council makes a desperate decision. In a society where the punishment for virtually every crime is being blown out an air-lock, or 'floated', they still don't execute their young offenders. But when the series begins, following 17-year old Clarke as she and her fellow prisoners are taken from their cells, her mother -- who is a Doctor and member of the ruling council -- tells her that she and 99 others are being taken to a Drop-ship bound for Earth.
What follows is an exciting and well-written tale that borrows liberally from film and literature without seeming wholly derivative. There are elements of 'Lord of the Flies' and 'Lost', of course, which seem like the story's primary influences. When the 100 discover that the Earth is not the wasteland they thought it was, but is instead teeming with life (including unlikely but entertaining monstrous mutations straight out of a 1950's B-movie), they have no way of contacting the Ark to report the good news. In a remarkably short-sighted move, they did nothing more than equip them with metal bracelets that send back telemetry limited to heart monitoring, which would theoretically inform the Ark of a subjects' death, but not how that death occurred. As the kids on Earth come to terms with their new life, the situation on the Ark becomes dire, as the CO2-scrubbers fail, and the only way to buy time is to reduce the number of people breathing...
The first several episodes deal with parallel power struggles on the ground and in orbit, as Clarke battles the charismatic Bellamy over their course of action; Clarke is determined to tell the Ark that the radiation is gone, while Bellamy does everything he can to convince them otherwise. Commanding the loyalty of the more hardcore delinquents with an anarchistic philosophy, he takes measures to mislead the Ark into thinking they're dead and dying, fearing that if anyone from the Ark makes it to Earth, his time will be up. But when they discover they are not alone, and these mysterious 'Grounders' (who are reminiscent of 'The Others' from Lost) kidnap and injure one person and eventually kill others, the idea of having more people from the Ark to help them against their newfound enemies seems like a good idea. Meanwhile, Clarke's mother fights another council member ('Desmond' from Lost) who believes that 'culling' 300 people is their only choice, while she desperately searches for proof that the 100 are (mostly) alive, and the ground is safe.
Over the first 13 episodes the cast, the writing, and the production have been excellent; while it's clearly targeting a younger teenage demographic, the stories are told with a maturity that any fans of science fiction should enjoy, filled with the heartrending dilemmas and impossible ethical decisions good drama is made of. There are typical problems with the science getting a bit fictitious, and it occasionally falls back on SF cliches -- every series I've seen does an episode where the characters start hallucinating that they're talking to dead people -- but for the most part, the writers and producers come up with fresh ideas for every episode, utilizing the tension between the Ark, the 100, and the Grounders effectively. The relationships have an honest, natural feel, and the dialogue is actually quite good as well; so many shows fail with the dialogue, when writers in their thirties or forties have already forgotten their high school years, and write terrible, snarky conversations for the young actors that sounds like bad, embarrassing parody. I'm not going to say there's none of that, but it's kept to a minimum. This is a series aimed at a fairly young audience, but the recent successes with YA book-->films crossing over to find older viewers has had a positive impact; it mostly means better writing, since so many films get sloppy and stupid writing for teens, thinking they can get away with it. Still, be prepared to forgive if you want to give this show a chance. It's flawed, but entertaining. {82/100)",1403481600,49,5204,5.003460207612457

Every now and then you come across a show that makes you say ""Woah. They got everything right. This literally could not be made any better than it already is."" This is one of those shows. The cast contains a very interesting array of likeable characters, and the female characters are as complex and three-dimensional as the male ones (still a rare thing to find in science fiction!). The storylines are original, and surprisingly difficult to predict, but always end up making sense in the bigger picture.

Although it has a futuristic science fiction backdrop, this show is ultimately about politics in its rawest and most unpolished form -- human interactions in a civilization struggling to adapt survive.

6202832,4,B00HS2OWNO,"When I first saw the previews for this show, I was pretty skeptical. After all, a bunch of teens let loose without any adult supervision whatsoever? Gee, can't imagine where this is going to go (especially on the CW). But about two weeks after the show's debut, I got bored and decided to give it a try. Lo and behold, I got interested. Clarke, the protagonist, portrayed by Eliza Taylor, is easily my favorite main character in a TV show in a very long time. As someone who loves and empathizes with tough girl characters (and doesn't see nearly enough of them), I appreciate that Clarke is smart, sensible, and not easily rattled. To be honest, Clarke is the primary reason I kept watching The 100, but she is not the only reason it's currently one of my favorite TV shows.

I'll start with the premise. First off, while the mature side of me rolls my eyes at the idea of one hundred juvenile delinquents running wild on a post-apocalyptic Earth, the kid part of me likes that the grown-ups have been removed from the equation. Why? Because I like seeing what happens when selfish, irresponsible characters are forced to become responsible. The 100 did not disappoint. While the pilot episode had me rolling my eyes at some of its stereotypically cheesy teen moments (seriously, who goes swimming in their underwear in an unknown area? Really?) as well as its apparently stereotypical cast of characters (more on that later), by the fourth episode I was speechless. It's safe to say I was NOT expecting the level of gray-area issues and raw violence that the show just went for. In one early episode, I, who pride myself on my ability to watch war movies without flinching, squeaked and covered my eyes because I couldn't handle the gruesomeness of a scene that involves a tough choice that I never, ever want to be faced with; at the end of that same episode, I gasped, jumped, and covered my mouth because something hugely terrible and hugely chilling happened right when I was least expecting it. If I had been eating, I would have choked. That was the episode where I was sucked in, and by the follow-up episode I was sold. I bought the book, read it in a couple hours, and was even more blown away...because (WARNING!) the show deviates a LOT from the book. The book told me, ""This is where we're going"" and the show told me, ""Yeah, right. Think again."" I respect that.

Now for the execution. Let me start by saying the acting, while generally competent, is not always great. In my opinion, the younger actors (with a few exceptions) deliver stronger performances than most of the older actors (again, with exceptions); that, however, doesn't bother me, because everyone's getting better. Eliza Taylor (Clarke), Bob Morley (Bellamy), Devon Bostick (Jasper), Isaiah Washington (Chancellor Jaha), Lindsey Morgan (Raven), Marie Avgeropoulos (Octavia), Richard Harmon (Murphy), and the vastly underrated Christopher Larkin (Monty) give, in my opinion, the most natural-feeling performances, and are always enjoyable. As mentioned before, while the other cast members have their moments of brilliance (and there are several episodes in which extras play their small roles to perfection), these eight are the most consistent, and it is in large part because of them that I've come to love (or hate, as it may be) their characters.

Now for the characters themselves. In the pilot, we're introduced to a very standard set of personalities, both among the teens headed to Earth and the adults remaining in space. Clarke is the smart, serious, uptight, make-sure-everyone-is-safe-and-does-the-right-thing heroine. Finn is the laid-back, fun-loving, charismatic daredevil. Bellamy is the ruthless, self-serving, arrogant bad-boy. Octavia is the repressed, rebellious wild-child. Jasper and Monty are the lovably sweet, dorky best friends who we instinctively know will never survive life on Earth. Among the adults you have Jaha, the heroic, dignified leader. Abby (Clarke's mother), is the humanitarian who always adheres to her beliefs. Kane is the harsh, militaristic rules-follower bent on saving humanity no matter the cost.
But then the story continues.
The more we see and learn of The 100's main characters, the harder it is to know what's what. I'm focusing primarily on the kids, since the adults really only see one major shift in character, and it's so welcome that I don't like to mention names.
(***SOME SPOILERS CONTAINED BELOW***)
Clarke:
Clarke begins the season as the daughter of Dr. Abby Griffin. She's lost her father. She's been separated from her mother. She's been dumped on Earth with a bunch of idiots whose first impulse is not to find resources/shelter, but to scream and dance around, and have fun. For the most part, Clarke doesn't seem to comprehend ""fun."" It doesn't matter to her whether she's teased about needing to lighten up by Finn, or sneered at for being a ""princess"" by Bellamy. Clarke sees only the job at hand, and she wants to follow the instructions and get the job done. She's smart and tough, but she's nave. All of that changes. By the finale, Clarke is a leader in every sense of the word. She's made several tough calls. She's saved lives, and she's taken lives. She's no longer the same person.

Bellamy:
I put Bellamy next, although in all rights, he should be first. I could not believe the change this character underwent, from beginning to end. In the pilot, I can honestly say that I loathed Bellamy Blake. The only redeeming quality he possessed was that he stowed away on the dropship in order to protect his little sister, but even that couldn't make me like him. When he and Clarke began immediately butting heads about what the group should do first, I rolled my eyes, thinking, ""Oh, please. Do we really have to endure another of these Type-A girl-falls-for-bad-boy or vice-versa storylines, and is it really going to happen five minutes in?"" Only it didn't happen. Instead, Bellamy set about making me dislike him even more, twisting things to his advantage, swaying crowds into doing what he wanted, and just in general being a jerk with a capital J. That behavior continues for a while. He threatens to cut off Clarke's hand. He allows a probable death-match to continue, and even arms one combatant. He inflicts a pretty harsh punishment on one of his henchmen because he ""won't be disobeyed."" He gives tacit permission for a hanging. All in all, if you'd told me I would ever come to tolerate, let alone love, this character, I wouldn't have believed you. But then the shift happened. It's a very gradual shift, and he has multiple setbacks, but through a long series of horrible events that often include well-timed pep talks/kicks-in-the-teeth from Clarke, Bellamy becomes an effective leader and actually begins to care about the kids who look up to him. Not only that, but he and Clarke become co-leaders and semi-shaky friends/possibly something more. I still have trouble believing it when I re-watch the earlier episodes.

Octavia:
The shift in Octavia's character still amazes me. In the first few episodes, I was still trying to decide whether or not I liked her. Sometimes she was sweet. Sometimes she was stupid, reckless, bratty, and annoying all at once. On several occasions, I couldn't blame Bellamy for being frustrated with her. But at the same time, her crazy, all-over-the-map personality made sense: she's been locked up, one way or another, for her whole life. Of course she's going to resent limits and restrictions and being told what to do. So I gave her a chance. And then, somewhere around the middle of the season, Octavia grew up. In one episode, she becomes the moral compass of the group, and it was hard to remember why I ever disliked her. For better or worse, Octavia is a passionate, bighearted character, and it's almost sad to see her taking on responsibility and making hard choices, but at the same time, it's great. With the circumstances the group deals with, it would be ridiculous for her to not mature.

Finn:
It kind of saddens me to write about the changes in Finn's character because my initial liking of him turned into dislike. While I usually appreciate having my expectations upended, I didn't at all in this case! I'll begin by saying that he was one of the first characters I was drawn to. I can't help enjoying the funny, teasing characters, and Finn is most definitely that guy at the start of the show. Although I knew it was predictable, I enjoyed the idea of him going after Clarke, because he's almost her opposite...joking, daring, relaxed, etc. But then (***SPOILER ALERT***) the suggestion of a girlfriend appeared, and although I tried to give him the benefit of the doubt, the girlfriend reveal happened and I couldn't. In the instant that we learn of his existing girlfriend, Finn changes from a sweet, fun guy, into someone who essentially betrays two very awesome girls in one fell swoop. He remains an interesting study, however, as his pure, unadulterated idealism/optimism makes a lot of waves during the problem-solving sessions and causes you to wonder why he holds these strong opinions.

Jasper and Monty:
It's impossible to separate these two, in my mind. They're adorable from the first, with their brotherish banter, geeky knowledge, and strong desire to impress girls (Octavia). Later, however, it becomes obvious that both possess far more character depth than you'd expect, and over the course of the show, they both display huge amounts of bravery, heart, loyalty, and generosity. While I initially thought I wouldn't care much about these two at all, they've become much-needed comedy relief, and two of my favorite characters.

Raven:
The only reason I put Raven last is because I think she undergoes the least amount of change as a character. That being said, Raven is an AMAZING character. I had a hard time deciding whether I liked her or Clarke better (Clarke finally won out), and I can honestly say I've never had that kind of problem before. When I consider that both Clarke and Raven exist together in The 100, I have trouble believing that I'm watching a CW show, because Raven is yet another strong female character. She's a mechanic...and not just A mechanic, but THE mechanic. She's smart, blunt, confident, stubborn, lively, and beneath all that as it's later revealed, vulnerable. She's extraordinarily intriguing as a character. While she acts invincible, an episode in which someone she loves is threatened shows her in a desperate, almost crazed light that makes her vulnerability crystal clear.

And now, finally, the summary. I never in a million years thought I'd say this, but I love this show and look forward to it when it's not on. In a weird, science-fiction sort of way, it reminds me of my beloved Veronica Mars in that it possesses adults but revolves around teens, has a tough girl leading the way, is far darker than one would expect, made me change my opinion of a character I 100% hated, and continues to surprise me. No, the acting is not perfect. Yes, plot points can be predictable. But there is always something to dissect about an episode (and I'm someone who L-O-V-E-S to dissect stories). In particular, the politics of it all engrosses me. Many's the time I've found myself seeing all sides of the issue at hand and trying to figure out what I would do in those circumstances, and I'm rarely happy or secure in my decision. If nothing else, The 100 is a study in leadership, and yes, it does remind me a lot of Lord of the Flies in that aspect. Plus, unlike most CW shows, romance is a small side story, NOT the main focus. Give it a try. I'm glad I did.

However, with the finale episode of the season, I began to wonder how much of the basic plot lines were taken from the Healing Crystal trilogy by Michele Poague. Main character a heroine thrown into a position she doesn't feel right in yet naturally fills- check; love triangle with two young men (one slightly older) - check; the heroine doesn't have time to deal with it but invites interest anyway and is torn - check; three different societies involved, one from the stars, one group the survival group, and one from the mountain - check. The similarities go on. It could be that the story was fresh and new but maybe someone read Heir to Power by Poague and ran with it?",1402617600,,804,4.476190476190476

6202853,5,B00HS2OWNO,"This is a fantastic sci-fi show.  I must admit, I had my doubts, but I was glad those subsided, because this is on the CW and the shows are not that great of quality.  I think the whole thing about the 100 is living off your own natural resources, no modern tech, except the stuff on the ARC, and just living day by day in an unpredictable wilderness.  The acting is superb, and although 90% of the cast is non-American, (Bob Morley, Eliza Taylor are Australian, Devon Bostick, Marie Avgeropolous, Richard Harmon are Canadian, and Henry Ian Cusick is Peruvian), they do a great job depicting the characters.  It does get quite graphic, and there is death but it is excellent to watch.  I can rest assure you all that the radiation mutations and CO2 on the ARC to sustain life is accurate.  It helps to have someone in the family who is a chemist confirm this for those who are skeptical.

EDIT ON 6.11.14: The season finale made me cry. It was a fantastic end to the season.  Great performances all around.  I cannot wait for the second season.

I look forward to watch this and will definitely purchase the first season DVD set.  Also, I am glad the CW renewed the 100 for a second season airing in the fall.",1402185600,2,1209,4.400900900900901

Logic holes so big you can drive semi trucks through, horrid dialogue, pure teen formula show complete with theme music for scenes to give ""mood/meaning"".  How something like this saw enough production to make it live is beyond me and shows just how little studios think of teenagers and the public in general.

6202893,2,B00HS2OWNO,"Ok well I have the same problem with this show that I do with revolution. Girl kind of a rebel get put in a crazy situation, finds a boy toy, he's a total badass rad individual. They like each other but writers will keep the sexual tension up for the next five seasons so they don't have to really rely on writing skill. All the teenies will be in hooked I mean he is so dreamy. The story will progress not fast the guy she should really be with will either turn evil or play the martyr, secretly pinning for her. I realize why people like Game of Thrones because of shows like this. Game of Thrones is well written, interesting characters, bold, and keeps you guessing. Why do shows like The 100 keep coming, they suck, will eventually be cancelled without a conclusion because the writers wanting to keep their jobs won't progress the story, and even if it gets an ending it will still suck, because the writers are using a template for the series that has been used for the last thirty years, and it isn't getting any better.

I imagine it will be quite successful on the CW channel.",1399939200,,309,4.081967213114754
6202906,3,B00HS2OWNO,"Despite some rather major disparities, there are enough similarities between The 100 and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Battlestar-Galactica/dp/B0036EH3UC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Battlestar Galactica</a>&nbsp;(BSG) that it merits a comparison. Indeed, The 100 even employs a handful of BSG actors: Alessandro Juliani (Lt. Gaeta), Kate Vernon (Ellen Tigh), and Hiro Kanagawa (as Cyrus Xander in Caprica). In season 2 of The 100, Ty Olsson (Captain Aaron Kelly) and Rekha Sharma (Tory Foster/ Cylon Final Five) are added. Before BSG fans cry bloody murder, let me provide a caveat: BSG was a 5-star masterpiece, and The 100 can't touch it. But both serials depict the struggles of the remainder of humanity after a nuclear apocalypse; while BSG is hardcore sci-fi, The 100 is primarily classified as science fiction also (albeit a lighter, fluffier version of sci-fi). Being stuck in space with limited resources and a ticking clock is nothing new, yet both programs add a new angle to the idea. Furthermore, the camerawork, ambience, and post-production color grading is similar between the two shows. In BSG we have the Cylons, and in The 100 we have the Grounders/ Reapers; in both, there is the enemy within (humans betraying humans and otherwise causing conflict, as people are won't to do). A gang is what the 100 teen survivors become, similar to what Captain Lee 'Apollo' Adama suggests in BSG during the trial of Gaius Baltar: ""...we're not a civilization anymore. We are a gang, and we are on the run, and we have to fight to survive.""

All that aside, the target demographic is quite different, creating a negative impact on potential; by ""BSG Junior"" I am not referring to The 100 as a worthy successor to BSG, but instead emphasizing that it's made for the younger crowd (but not limited to them). Don't give up if you dislike the first episode... it does get better, despite persistent flaws. Things start to get pretty wild in Episode 9,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Unity-Day/dp/B00KCGS6M6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Unity Day</a>.

PROs
+ Groovy cast
+ Compelling storyline that keeps you coming back
+ Occasional unexpected plot twists
+ Eliza Taylor excels in her role as Clarke Griffin
+ Isn't afraid to present provocative ethical/ philosophical questions (along with the mindless entertainment)
+ RENEWED for a 2nd season, so no worries about being left hanging at the end of s1

CONs
- emotional and intellectual capacity feels constrained, as if the writers/ producers figure the intended YA demographic can't handle more; this is mainly what separates The 100 from 5-star sci-fi productions
- too many plot aspects simply just don't add up
- suffers from Vancouver Music Syndrome* (see below)

And a bunch of unanswered questions, including (but not limited to):
- Why did the folks on the space station have so many kids? (lack of birth control? whatever the case, they surely should have had enough foresight to prevent overpopulation)
- The alpha male character (of the 100 sent to Earth) becomes and stays a dictator?
- What is up with the giant snake and 2-headed wildlife? Hiroshima, Nagasaki and Chernobyl didn't create giant or two-headed animals, and evolution takes millennia. While huge snakes can be found today in tropical regions, The 100 is set in a temperate climate, like Canada (it was shot in British Columbia). Not to mention, Octavia walked away from her snake encounter how?
- How did youths who had previously never held a gun become sharpshooters (Episode 9) overnight? Please.

*What is the Vancouver Music Syndrome? The VMS is an vile phenomenon found among Vancouver-based sci-fi serials in the past 5 or so years; examples include&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/SGU-Stargate-Universe/dp/B00402FGE4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">SGU: Stargate Universe</a>, The 100, and especially&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Continuum-Season-1/dp/B00B4804LM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Continuum: Season 1</a>. The syndrome entails the intrusion of vomitously repulsive songs into an otherwise worthwhile show. The cause of VMS remains unknown to the general public. It is likely due to one or more individuals involved with post-production who have enough authority to indulge themselves by inserting into an episode music pleasing to them; oddly enough, they assume this behavior to be appropriate. The songs chosen usually feature whiny, emotionally fraught vocals, and always are pretentious. Although well-intentioned, these injections of audio terror tend to destroy a perfectly good episode of science fiction. A more cynical evaluation of the phenomenon is that instead of having to work on a better script, the producers throw in a song.",1399939200,11,4860,5.725761772853185

This show is essentially fiction and I much prefer that to a movie made about some real story. The highest percentage of movies or series that I watch are fictional. If I wanted reality I'll watch a good news show that really reports the facts. Rarely is a movie, based on true facts not heavily dramatized, which makes the story line false to a very large degree.

The story is fun, the acting isn't bad, and the scenery is gorgeous and green.  I can't quite figure out how long they have been living in space, but that doesn't matter.  The show all in all is about young ""criminals"" building a new society on a war- ravaged Earth, ending up with the smart cute girl leader and the hot smart rough boy leader making a blend of Lord of the Flies and a girl-power CW show.

They just borrow bits and pieces from all the movies and shows that has been out there. (Lost, Lord of the flies ect...).
First of all, if human were to be extincted or wipe out, I don't think people who's up there  in the  space station will even get a slight chance of being up there in the first place. What happen to the Russians, China, UK, France space stations? They are just as advance as the U.S. or may be even more.

Now the not so good news. There are flashes of brilliance in the writing and they certainly are not afraid of conflict. The problem is that they don't take any time at all giving you be the back story or developing the characters. They just plop you down into the action and assume you'll get it. Sorry but its almost impossible to get attached to characters whose main purpose is to run around breathlessly with major angst and drama.  Speaking of which there needs to be a serious talk with casting. These are supposed to be outlaw teens but some how they all look like they are about to graduate from a community college.

Really, Really happy about Octavia and Jasper (my vote for power couple) character development, he liked her at the costume party. This could be a really nice piece of drama. everybody loves the underdog. Jasper is in good position to turn into MVP. He's shown bravery throughout episodes(not unnoticed by Octavia). He's best friends with the Asian/IT kid (sorry about blatant racism: so should network be).  I like him as right hand man (for now).
  And Octavia is soft and gooey about big macho grounder (he did fix her broken leg and save her from a spear to the chest). Nice set up for braun or brains conflict. I expect Octavia will deepen ties with grounder hunk, since he is the biggest lead to them yet. I HOPE this is matched with a big gesture from Jasper to continue the dilemma for Octavia.
  Anyway, favorite character = Jasper. so if he loses Octavia you writers better move him into higher ground so he becomes worthy mate for Clarke or maybe Raven(nice twist).

6202937,3,B00HS2OWNO,"I had somewhat high hopes for this series but got my first warning sign moments into the pilot, when we are told that ""the only punishment for crime is the death penalty"" if you're over 18. Really? That's the best the writers could do? It gets worse. Of course the landing craft loses communication, but we can accept that as a necessary plot twist. Ok. But do all the teenagers have to act like they don't have any sense at all? Not all young adult fiction is like that (except for the CW channel it seems). Some, such as The Hunger Games, show young people making adult decisions in trying circumstances. Do we have to watch every pairing between perfectly tanned delinquents start off with the long, soulful ""kiss-me"" looks from the first episode? Do all the adults either have to be evil/ruthless or a crusader?

Ok, ok....let's skip to the part where the girl strips to take a swim (again, great muscle tone and tanned skin for someone locked up for years), jumps in the water and gets nabbed by a giant snake....a giant snake which decides to release her as soon as the attractive teens on the shore toss a rock at it. Then the rescued young woman has nothing more than scratches on her leg, when she was being held underwater in it's jaws? By this time I was sighing aloud.

Oh, the bad guys....the juvies who just want to raise hell, make out and....ok, so maybe that part is realistic. But still....how long into the apocalypse before stomach's start to growl? How long until someone thinks maybe gathering food and water might be a good plan? I know Survivor will still be playing 200 years from now, but clearly these kids haven't seen it. Survival? Wait, you mean we can't order pizza delivery???

I made myself watch the second episode, which was not quite as dumb, but this is apparently going to be a show where every predictable plot twist and every hint of simmering young adult sexuality will be utilized as often as possible. I love science fiction and I especially love apocalypse fiction....but I love well-written drama, fleshed out characters and actual human unpredictability more.

I hope it gets better. Really, I do. Not every show can be a Breaking Bad or Walking Dead, but hey....you writers are getting paid to write. It's a dream job. Put some work into it, willya???",1398297600,11,2298,4.625

6202950,2,B00HS2OWNO,"To be fair to the supporters and the critics  i tried to like this show.
I watched it for the first time at the insistence of a friend who said you will love it, but sadly no i didn't.
An unbelievable story line is the first thing that grabbed me, jump to a failing space station who sends a group of kids that have never even seen a tree a stream or felt sunshine to a planet ravaged by radiation after only 90 something years to fend for themselves with no food and no weapons.
they then crash onto the planet and things go from bad to worse, pick out the one African American dude and lets persecute him and then kill him over and over again, but trust me its gets far worse.
With no weapons they then begin to hunt Animals who have been mutated from exposure to radiation and they do this with clubs and spears ,what have you. after they themselves are already weakened by no food and very little water.  some of the worst acting i have ever seen combined  with so many holes in the plot its like a cheese grater and this fails big time.  i can't believe someone wrote this  and it was published  .. can anybody say Terra Nova",1397520000,7,1130,4.160550458715596

The show is interesting but they do need to have the cast find ruins and such to move about more. The people on the ground should also be mutants and we see a skeleton that's mutated, and then sadly a normal looking human. This show at least doesn't have aliens that look just like humans ala 'star crossed'.  This show is not badly acted though as some people claimed ,  This show has a good amount of potential , if they give it a chance and go out amongst the ruins and such.

6202974,5,B00HS2OWNO,"First, I've just watched the pilot.  I don't understand the varied reviews of this show.  The ""100"" are juvenile delinquents released from their space station prison sentences to populate a radiated earth: earth is most likely not habitable.  But down they go, and when they get to earth they not only experience a ""planet"" for the first time, but they also have just been released from prison.  So imagine, 100 irresponsible criminals get dropped on an earth that hasn't seen a human in 97 years; you might expect to see some strange behavior and you do.  The setting is pretty awesome, the characters are interesting and unless the writers completely drop the ball on the plot/story, then you can expect a pretty good show.  Also note, all the bad reviews have come from people who have just seen a single episode (who's expectations were probably unrealistic in the first place).  This is one of the better pilots I have seen.",1395705600,124,929,4.76875
6202975,5,B00HS2OWNO,I was pleased with the portrayal of the adults on the station so that we see why a lot of things are happening.  The Will Smith movie would have been better if it showed more than just he and his son.,1395705600,,200,3.8780487804878048
6202976,3,B00HS2OWNO,"It's impossible to say how this will eventually go. Being on the CW and following the general ""Hunger Games""/_Lord of the Flies_ YA theme I wouldn't bet on it lasting more than a (short) season. But there was something about the pilot episode that brought it above the usual teenager dystopias we've grown to know and hate. It certainly wasn't the plot or the SF rationale. Maybe it was the leads, maybe I'm just projecting a faint hope for something better. Anyway, I liked it well enough for a three-star rating -- much better than I expected even if I can't quite figure out why. I'll give it an episode or two more and chalk it up as some lucky chemistry that brings this ever so slightly above the typical SF YA mess on TV these days. We'll see if that's enough to keep it around.",1395705600,,785,4.383561643835616

6202978,3,B00HS2OWNO,"This show has an interesting premise and a plot that sci-fi fans should really like. There a lot of potential for interesting story and action as the characters explore a whole new world -- certainly has its appeal. SPOILERS AHEAD! My favorite scene: a nasty-looking two-headed deer surprise! That was fun. The bad news: some on-screen effects flubs that should never have passed through editing.  Example: kids swinging on a vine that is obviously a rope with a sad attempt at hiding it under tied grass pieces and fake foliage. I was completely distracted by the rope vine throughout the entire scene.

Having only seen the Pilot so far, the merits this show's writing has yet to be proven to me one way or the other. My hope is the writers will avoid typical plot pitfalls and caricatures of TV for younger/teen audiences as the story develops into the season. It's possible that TV can be both teen-viewer friendly and have well-developed characters and complexities, However, I fear this show will ultimately turn soapy and too immature for any audience member old enough to vote.",1395619200,,1085,4.859459459459459

Predictable chaos as The 100 (careless teens) land on Earth and explore the planet after an apocalypse and spending the past 100 years living on space stations with the rest of the human race survivors to avoid the radiation.  I know the first thing I would do after landing on an uninhabitable earth is to carelessly jump in a lake, not knowing what lurks beneath; or screaming at the top of my lungs after swinging from a vine from one rock to another only to be impaled by a spear created by some mysterious inhabitants already living on the planet - stupid kids doing stupid things comes across as a B rated movie and not really my cup of tea.

8635299,1,B00HS2OWNO,"Probably one of the worst written shows I've watched. It started off good and I was really hoping it would get better but the writing is horrible. The first season has pretty straight forward characters with a couple that have hidden agendas so you think their horribly stupid decisions were for some yet unrevealed reason. Turns out they were just idiots. As the show continues the decisions just get worse and worse until the mid-point of season 3 where I gave up on the show. I'm assuming this was written for tweens as I really can't see an adult buying into the stories or relating to anything going on in the show.
Every other character on the show is a classic Mary Sue. If a character was a repair tech for a year they magically know every single thing there is to know about all weapons and all technology. The young teen that had a hobby in electronics for a couple years? He is now a master hacker of every computer system ever devised even ones he has never seen before that are 100 years old. One kid out of 100 with barely a cadet's training with a pistol turns into half the 100 being magically competent with assault rifles and guerrilla warfare. It takes 2 days on Earth, after living on a space station for their entire lives, for them to all become extremely skilled at survival as well. I think this having everyone be a master expert at something is why the writing for the characters' decisions had to be so bad. There wouldn't be any sense of drama if the characters made smart decisions so nearly every action they take has to be idiotic.
Characters flip flop between allegiances every few episodes and it started becoming comical. Blind, nearly fervent allegiance to one group turns into the same level of dedication to the enemy group within hours. Same for personal relationships with several characters going from thinking this one person was the love of their life to hating that person and now another person was the love of their life. Now its someone else. Over and over and flip and flop. If you're into the hormonally charged decision making and petty politics of middle school you might enjoy this show.",1527120000,2,2138,4.584856396866841
