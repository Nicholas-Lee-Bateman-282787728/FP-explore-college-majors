5916666,4,B00EIPEQLW,"""All Is Lost"" (2013 release; 100 min.) brings the story of ""Our Man"" (as Robert Redford is named in the credits) alone at sea. As the movie opens, we are told Our Man is 1,700 miles away from the Sumatra Straits in the Indian Ocean, and in a voice over, Redford tells us that ""all is lost, except for the body and soul, or whatever remains of that. I'm sorry"". The screen goes dark and then states ""8 days earlier"". We see Our Man waking up in his sailboat, only to find that there is gashing hole due to a collision with a container which appears to have fallen off a containership in mid ocean. And from there, Our Man's troubles start. Will Our Man make it out alive? To tell you more would ruin your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Several comments: this movie is a tour-de-force in every which way, the likes of which we don't get to see very much. A lot has been made about the fact that there is no dialogue in the movie, but frankly I find it a refreshing take. How many people would dare make a movie without any dialogue? Gutsy call. Second, this movie is written and directed by J. C. Chandor, who made an intriguing debut a couple of years ago with ""Margin Call"". Now this. Can't wait to see what he'll do next. Third, there is the bravura performance from Robert Redford, now 77 if you can believe it (but looking at least 10-15 years younger that that). In a very different way, this is reminiscent of Tom Hanks in ""Castaway"", except in this movie there is not ""pre"" and ""after"", it's just Redford as Our Man battling the elements at sea. We don't know anything about Our Man's background, his life situation, etc. But we nevertheless are emotionally invested in this character. Last but certainly not least, this movie will have you on the edge of your seat from start to finish. I was really surprised how tense this movie experience is (and I mean that as a compliment). At one point, Our Man's radio equipment falters and then comes back to life. Our Man scrambles to get it working and says ""This is the Virginia Jean with an SOS call, over"" three or four times, until the radio just dies again, this time for good. You can just see the despair in Our Man's eyes. (Surely Redford will get serious Best Actor Oscar consideration for his role in this movie?) Kudos as well for the beautiful soundtrack by Alex Ebert, I will have to check that out.

I had seen the trailer for this a couple of times in recent weeks and couldn't wait to see this. It finally opened today in Cincinnati and I went to see it right away. The late matinee screening I saw this at was well attended, which is great news, as this movie deserves to be seen. I couldn't believe when the lights came back on, as this movie had absolutely flown by in no time. If you are in the mood for a tense adventure movie that brings a fresh take and is miles away from your standard Hollywood fare, you cannot go wrong with this. ""All Is Lost"" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",1383868800,166,2993,4.333333333333333
5916667,5,B00EIPEQLW,"Let me go out on a limb here:  Best Actor 2014.

This is a stunning film.  He says barely a word for two hours, and you cannot take your eyes off the screen.  It's an incredible acting job, and hard to believe he was able to do it: physically, emotionally at his age.  You live through every moment with him, and yet, somehow, it's a hopeful film in the end.

Don't miss it!

Enjoy!

**** update

Honestly, I cannot understand what awards are all about, when a performance of this caliber goes completely unacknowledged.  At least, there was a lot of immediate protest about the fact that he was not nominated.  I wanted to boycott the Oscars!  I stand by my thoughts that this is a once in a lifetime performance.  Really, don't miss it.",1383782400,12,738,4.377777777777778
5916668,4,B00EIPEQLW,"Despite the lack of special effects, computer animation and 3-D (not to mention dialog), All is Lost keeps your attention and your interest. It even holds off on the mood music until the second half. Until then, about the only sounds are the  lapping waves against the boat, right beside you in surround sound.

Unlike, say Harry Potter or James Bond films, there is real mortal risk for our (unnamed) hero. The outcome is far from guaranteed.

Robert Redford is battered by one lousy turn of luck after another, but he just keeps going. It just keeps getting worse and worse. There is only one alternative, and it is always there for him. So to that extent the film is exciting and suspenseful. But there are no guns, no villains and no betrayals, unless you believe God himself is behind this torture.

It shows once again that a good story trumps all, a lesson I wish Hollywood would buy into, instead of comic book heroes who we all know must triumph. Great stories have been sorely lacking for a good 25 years. This is a great story.

These single focus oeuvres, like biographies, always let if not make the lead shine. And Robert Redford, at 77, is not just an athlete, he's a fine, unstereotyped actor. Very believable. Another reason All is Lost should be on the must-see list.

5916669,5,B00EIPEQLW,"Excellent movie, especially for a solo sailor.  I can imagine myself going through a similar event. Conclusion - you need safety systems that are waterproof and  not dependent on the central power grid of your boat.",1383436800,7,215,4.944444444444445
5916670,1,B00EIPEQLW,"we've just seen this film at our local film festival and I was really looking forward to it. It's hard to see how, given the materials they had to hand, they could make something so dreadful;  truly a sailing film written by a finite number of hydrophobic monkeys.  The best bits made me laugh, most of it made me cringe.
Particularly notable is the boat rolling in a manner usually associated with a kayak, a knife that is able to cut away standing rigging that would usually need bolt-croppers and a sextant that apparently allows you to determine your position without changing the angle of the mirrors (or, indeed, reading the angle after you've taken the sight). I admit that I was always fond of playing with my boat in the bath, and this may have made me hyper-critical, but I don't remember these sort of errors in Captain  Pugwash. Were it just technical sillys, then the film might be bearable, but the character and his responses to the various problems that befall him are are equally flawed.",1383004800,29,1004,4.629213483146067
5916671,2,B00EIPEQLW,"This movie is unique, for sure.  It's got very few words, and covers between 1 and 2 weeks of terror as a struggle for survival by a lone shipwrecked sailor gets ever-harder.  He has to transfer from his smashed up yacht to a life raft, and then the second half of the movie gets even more frightening as he keeps trying to get discovered, protect his life raft, and hydrate himself.  I wish there had been something more for me to connect to than the problem solving skills of survival by this anonymous man, played by Robert Redford.  I couldn't find personal value for me in the story, just kept wanting the crisis to end.  There were several very powerful moments, but in my opinion, they would have been better served in a story that dealt with more than just ""I've got to survive!""  I feel that stories of survival are much better when there's something that changes for the better within the character, or there are other characters with whom the main character forges relationships.",1382572800,12,990,4.596590909090909

I read some of the other reviews and I don't think some of the things mentioned detracted from the film at all.

5916682,1,B00EIPEQLW,"It pushed my judgmental button.

5916683,1,B00EIPEQLW,"An exercise in how not to go solo sailing on the open ocean. Lack of critical equipment, a boat equipped with cabin gear that becomes useless once wet (!), lack of redundancies, not immediately performing essential repairs, when having the best opportunity one could hope for within thousands of miles, on a sunny day and in calm water, tied to a stable platform ... It's one boondoggle after the other. Hard to watch in that regard.
Robert Redford's credible performance in exploring the skipper's emotional journey through increasingly insurmountable odds gives the movie some reason to exist. Am just surprised he signed up for this knucklehead adventure. His movies usually have far better thought out stories.

This whole drama reminds me of the guy floating several thousand feet up in the air in a lawn chair, suspended under a large number of helium balloons, armed with a pellet gun to pop balloons as needed for altitude control. I do not care for his emotional journey, either.",1517875200,,988,4.951807228915663
5916684,5,B00EIPEQLW,"Only Robert Redford could carry this movie that's for sure. Since I know two sailors I could spot a few errors the sailor made; then again, many of us might, in a situation like this.
Certainly, I would have tried to stuff that hole before I'd do anything else, like retrieving the sea anchor.
The most beautiful scene in the movie is when it starts raining. For once the conditions are in ""the sailor's"" favor - Robert Redford's happiness is playing out in his face. It's very beautiful indeed. Redford shows us the face of hope.
All in all a movie that hinges entirely on the performance of a great actor. At 70+, Robert Redford is like great wine, he gets even better with age.
PS: The make-up of the sunburned Redford was pretty awesome too.

5916693,5,B00EIPEQLW,"This really deserves 5 stars even though it may be something less than a tour de force for Redford.  It's bold and experimental, and it works very well. My first impression was it could have used some background, maybe some flashbacks, and some more faces to keep it interesting.  That formula, after all, worked well for Tom Hanks in Cast Away. But, thinking about it, I'm sure those omissions were intentional.  Redford wanted to create something uncluttered, without distractions, a pure metaphor for the human condition, going from bad to worse with only a leaky boat or plastic life raft keeping us from the depths below.  And that ocean is the antagonist in this drama, a well developed character, an ever-present threat like death itself.

The movie is well filmed, and you do get immersed in the experience, which equals entertainment.

We find an old man all alone in the middle of the ocean. He is on sail boat with limited supplies but he sure is damn crafty. Eveytime you expected him to get knocked down and as we see things began going down hill - he was ALWAYS prepared. There was this part where a storm was well on its way and we find him shaving instead of doing other more important things.

 I have to say that it's obvious that this character purports himself in such a situation - purposely I presume. It seems like he was trying to run away from life - reality. It doesn't matter what it is. Knowing the details would only get in the way of connecting to the story.

5916737,4,B00EIPEQLW,"Review of All is Lost
Hot Toasty Rag, September 25, 2017

Everyone who reads my reviews knows I don't have respect for the Academy Awards anymore. If you still revere and watch the Oscars every year, you need to watch All is Lost. Robert Redford, at seventy-seven years old, stars as a shipwrecked man fighting for survival. Hes the only actor in the entire movie. Its a virtually silent performance. He wasn't nominated for an Oscar, the same year Tom Hanks wasn't nominated for Captain Phillips. What does it take?

For love of Robert Redford, I sat through this ocean-set film. Im deathly afraid of water, so it was very difficult and there were times when I covered my eyes. I can imagine that, if I wasn't afraid of water, the movie would still be extremely tense. This man is stuck on a tiny boat in the middle of the ocean and faces more obstacles than anyone in the world ever shouldthe dire peril hes in is always keenly felt by the audience. From running out of drinking water to getting surrounded by sharks, he fights during every scene to survive.

Next to The Great Gatsby, this is the best performance of Robert Redfords career. With pretty much no spoken lines, no name, and no background to his character or situation, he manages to bond with the audience and capture their emotions. Watch this movie. I haven't watched the Oscars since.",1506297600,,1354,4.609958506224066

5916739,4,B00EIPEQLW,"In ""All Is Lost,"" Robert Redford portrays a sailor, alone on the high seas, whose yacht gets punctured by an errant shipping container. He awakens to find his boat taking on water. And then the excitement begins. Watch this film on the biggest HDTV you can find, with strong speakers and the volume up. The premise may sound dull, but this film is anything but. Redford plays this role with a stiff upper lip and serious WASP grit. There may be about 50 to 100 spoken words in this picture. It's almost a silent movie, save for the sound effects. ""All Is Lost"" is highly gripping entertainment about an old man and the sea. This also features one of Robert Redford's best performances, and likely his most understated one.",1504396800,,722,4.604651162790698

Goes downstairs for a casual shave rather than drooping sails or anything else a real sailor would do. It's just not realistic.",1500940800,,436,4.4625

5916754,5,B00EIPEQLW,"Redford gives a dynamic and highly psychical performance in this solo-voyager adventure.  There is little dialogue and only in the beginning.  The film relies on the strength of its story and the demands placed on the sailor.  From the initial beginning of a night collision with an errant floating container fallen from a ship to the resourceful ending, the film is perfectly paced and beautifully photographed.  There is much to learn and see in this film, with the only character encountering setback after setback.

The viewer learns a great deal about what it takes to sail solo across the Indian Ocean and what the perils of such an endeavor entail.  The hole in the sailboat at the beginning is just the start.  He encounters storms, more turbulence, a series of unlucky events and eventually his own mortality.  The ending will have most people cheering or sullen.

However, it is the journey that is the most exciting and the idea of sailing alone is far more adventurous than one might think.  Redford did all his own stunts and some of the camerawork is absolutely stunning.",1491350400,,1085,4.8478260869565215

5916798,1,B00EIPEQLW,"In the beginning... We have a solo ocean-going yachtsman woken by flooding in his nice vintage sloop. It looks like a 35footer from the 1980's. The sea is calm and the weather mild with light airs. Yet despite this, the vessel has managed to strike a stray floating cargo container with such force that it has actually penetrated the hull. Stranger still; the impact has occurred aft of beam where the hull is actually tapering towards the transom. How could this happen? there would have to have been a very strong cross-current indeed to effect an impact at all, never mind one that could stave-in a fibreglass hull almost an inch thick; and that current would also have affected the yacht. In truth; the vessel would've gently sloughed-off the obstacle with no more than a graze to its gel-coat. Furthermore; if a collision of such magnitude had actually happened; below decks the impact would've sounded like an artillery barrage and the jolt would've knocked a snoozing sailor clean out of his bunk. He wouldn't have just snored-on to be woken by the flooding! However, this preposterous scenario was necessary in order that all of his navigational equipment was destroyed as well as the hull integrity compromised. In fact, the implausibility of it all is underscored a few minutes later when our hero actually goes on to ram the container head-on in order to come to a standstill! Evidently two holes in the boat are better than one... When a ""serious"" movie is predicated upon such complete absurdity, something has gone badly wrong, somewhere.

What else do we know about this seafaring simpleton, this Jonah writ large? Well - he decides to cross oceans, yet he doesn't have a spare radio - not even a $100 hand-held unit.
He doesn't have a spare SatNav - again, about $100.
He doesn't have an EPIRB buoy - that's Emergency Position-Indicating Radio Beacon. They're small, automatic transmitters on the emergency waveband. And they're about $200-300.
Even more bizarre; he doesn't have any kind of dinghy or tender. How-on-Earth would he get ashore if his vessel was compelled to lie at anchor?
He's sailing solo, but he never wears a life jacket or buoyancy-aid of any kind. He's not drawing a painter to give himself a last lifeline to grab hold of in the event of falling overboard. He never wears a safety harness or a lifeline of any kind except when faced with a crisis. He doesn't have automatic bilge-pumps or flooding alarms. He doesn't appear to have an autopilot. He has no alternative power-supply like solar panels or wind-generator when his batteries and alternator are destroyed in the flooding. He doesn't have an emergency Grab-Bag full of essentials for when abandoning ship.
He abandons ship when the yacht is still afloat and salvageable, leaving a host of useful items still aboard. He leaves his liferaft tethered to the yacht's pushpit rails and falls asleep in it so that if the yacht should sink, it'll also drag him and his liferaft down to Davy Jones...!
And so it goes on - dafter and dafter, as poor old Redford's dementia takes hold. He tries to mend the hole with a few sheets of fibreglass matting and paste. It's a paper-thin patch that won't withstand a sneeze when he should be bolting a wooden panel and wadding over it instead. The yacht is fitted with a spray-hood, yet when the weather turns foul he never bothers to raise it; and instead leaves the hatch wide open so that rain and spray is free to saturate accommodation below decks. In a storm, he manages to get pitch-poled sideways TWICE (an amazing feat of seamanship) and in the process is actually dismasted - but his fibreglass patch? - solid as a rock, mate. And - yes - in the face of disaster; nothing's more needful to a man's sense of being than a nice, refreshing shave. Bugger the hole in the boat, sod the fried electrics, to hell with the oncoming storm - let's sort out that stubble! There were times when I wanted to peep over the transom, half in expectation that he might be towing a length of marina pontoon as a sort of makeshift drogue. Curiously; when his yacht finally sinks, the water begins pouring in from down below. We see it broiling- up like some sort of submerged geyser - not through the container-hole and Redford's impregnable repair. We are left merely to guess at the nature of this mysterious special-effect...

By the time we reach the Alice in Wonderland finale, we are almost prepared for anything; and JC Chandor doesn't disappoint, as we observe our hapless hero actually set his liferaft on fire as a means signalling to another vessel. I kid you not.

If only Rowan Atkinson had been cast in his Mr Bean persona, every detail in this movie would've gelled into silent hilarious perfection. Instead, we had this worn-out derelict still trying to play pretty-boy with the golden hair after all these years.

Mr Chandor - you need to find another job. Mr Redford - back to the nursing home for you.",1469750400,,4942,4.729698375870069
5916799,5,B00EIPEQLW,"This was a surprisingly great film, far more gripping and intense than one would expect from this preview.

Robert Redford, Ayn Rand's choice to portray John Galt in her projected movie of Atlas Shrugged, is like an aging but still verile Galt struggling to survive in a Hugo-esque (''Toilers of the Sea"") universe.

Watch ""All is Lost"" for the poignantly heroic spectacle of ""a man"" whose every last ounce of dedication to his own life is relentlessly, mercilessly contested by the brutal sea: equally awesome in its vast & gentle calm or sudden & terrifyingly violent rages.

The oceanic sense of space of J. C. Chandor's ""All is Lost"" is more breathtaking than any film I can recall since the desert of David Lean's ""Lawrence of Arabia,"" or the extra-terrestrial planetary surface of Ivan Tarkovsky's ""Solaris.""

Those three would in fact make an excellent trilogy on the theme of man facing virtually alone a life-threatening  situation involving psychological & existential crisis exquisitely provoking a cathartic moral epiphany.",1469750400,,1035,5.173652694610778

5916801,5,B00EIPEQLW,"This movie really took me by surprise. At the beginning I honestly had no idea just how riveting and full of suspense it would be. And it's so quiet too!

Once it starts, and the water gets in the boat, it's kind of that, ""oh, effing NO!!""-moment and it's life or death all the way through.

The ocean scenes correspond with the soundtrack to create a terrible beauty that looks serene and inviting if not for the impending doom and errant hopelessness.

The title of the movie is truly fitting as Robert Redford literally goes through every single lifeline knocking down to the end.

I won't give the ending away but it did come as a surprise to me.

The cinamatography is amazing! My all time favorite Robert Redford movie is actually my favorite movie in the whole world, ""Out of Africa."" Nothing comes close to that.

 I think the one-person acting here though is the best you'll ever find. He barely speaks yet his thoughts are blatantly obvious and one wishes to just send him a rescue already!!!

I said over and over as I watched this movie:
Now there's a number one reason why I would never sail. And then another reason and another. At a certain point hope no longer exists, and Redford's ambition and determination to live, literally keep the sharks at bay.

If there are any gung ho sailers out there who are telling their wives, friends and family members about their planning a trip alone at sea, (on an expensive yacht, but of course); they have GOT to see this movie FIRST. In fact, this movie should be required for any Sailing license, if that exists.",1469318400,,1569,4.535460992907802

Loving that book and having amazing respect for Callahan I was sorely disappointed by this movie. Many of Redford's actions, especially near the beginning of the movie, just don't make sense. As a sailor myself I just wasn't convinced. Not only were the details mostly lost and completely unbelievable, the transformation of his feelings during the journey was missing as well. How long was he in the life raft? Could have been a few days, or over two months(like in the true story), but we don't get any sense of it. Why did he even go to sea in the first place? What's his emotional state overall? What caused him to give up? This movie lacks depth (no pun intended), realism, emotion, and context.

The movie is riddled with it.  I give it 3 stars, here, because I never want to watch it again.  Two words... Powerful and Depressing.

Redford plays a one man show here.  Pantomime with props.  This story is much like ""Castaway"" with Tom Hanks... only without the laughs. (as if ""Castaway"" was supposed to be funny... much)  It is also reminiscent of ""The Life of Pi"" as we feel the loneliness and desperation of being adrift AND alone with nothing but ocean and uncertainty for miles  As with all three of these movies, the viewer is, practically, hogtied to question one's own humanity and worth... We come to a sharp awareness of how good we have it and how much we take for granted... water, food... 911.

There is about one paragraph's worth of spoken words, if even that many, and they STILL managed to insert the F-bomb... Could have been G rated without it.

I get the artsy feel, innovation and cinematic poetry involved here. The underwater views are quite beautiful and expressive in and of themselves.  (but ""The Life of Pi"" was much more visually and emotionally successful in capturing the dichotomy of the ocean's beauty and treachery)

I might add that I watched this movie alone, which made it all the more powerful and emotionally taxing for me, I am certain.  It's inspiration for personal introspection is of value, as are some of the survival tips, such as the condensation trick and the value of a having a handy bottle of hydrogen peroxide and butterfly bandages around, just in case.  Although he doesn't do everything with the utmost of forethought.

One has to wonder why the glaringly lackadaisical and lazy attitude over water, water everywhere coming into the boat and up and over the radio equipment.  Some moments leave you scratching your head as to his 'reasoning'... but he never panicked... maybe because he was older? Had he learned to keep calm in all situations and not panic as it never helps anything?  Maybe he had been in the war during his younger years and had learned, the hard way, to keep calm and press on.  His character is a little cold and unemotional... you got the feeling he wasn't easy to know or like... it was less than easy to bond with him in his consistent reticence for positive self-talk and speedy action . You certainly felt his age, he did everything so slowly... as if he had years to get things done.

There are also some head scratching things to do with reality and common sense.  The location of the hole, how water gets in and how it doesn't get in... seemed a little uneven for what must be the reality... and his steering the boat INTO the container after being hit by it already seemed a bonehead thing to do and he wasn't even starved and dehydrated when he did that.

No offense Mr. Redford... Your acting was impeccable (as expected), I felt and shared in this man's pain and frustration. I wouldn't be at all surprised if that is exactly the truth of the way it, sounded, felt, looked and all happened to the man this story is said to be base on, but give me ""Castaway"".

One obscure observation which struck me funny was that in Castaway... Tom Hanks one of the packages contained Volleyball and another Ice Skates and in this movie the container was full of tennis shoes.  What is it with the sports equipment?  :/",1462665600,,3515,4.535657686212361

It's like this guy has never sailed before: do you have to open the hatch all the way every time you go on deck in heavy weather?
What is the worst that could happen by laying a lead acid battery on its side?
When you sending a distress call, ya think you might say ""mayday"" three times as is the international standard? - also try un-keying the mike every once and a while.
Really frustrating to watch if you've ever been to sea.

I did get nostalgic when he pulled out the sextant - I immediately recognized it as an Astra IIIB, the same model I learned celestial navigation with.  No idea how he was doing his sight reductions by just putting a little pen X on the chart, but I had already given up on any accuracy by that point.

Other things that our man did were also not realistic for a seasoned sailor, such as trying to set up a storm jib or leaving the hatch wide open in the middle of a storm.

I'm a sailor and not even an experienced sailor. I've got about 300 hours invested working on and repairing boats but only about 30 hours invested in sailing them. That said, even I knew from the very get go in this movie that either Robert Redford's character had his head completely up his butt or he has ZERO sailing experience. And I mean that ZERO as in a 48 sized font ZERO.

The dude makes the worst decisions over and over again throughout the entire movie. He was never prepared properly from the get-go. As a matter of fact, I'm going to go so far as to say (SPOILER ALERT) that the main character in this movie is not the protagonist but the antagonist. So who then is the protagonist? The Ocean? Who the hell knows?

All I know is that this movie was a complete fail to the sailing community from me, a complete novice.

Instead, this is a movie that captivates you, and keeps you involved from the start to finish.  Robert Redford's acting is so good that you feel connected to him throughout the entire film.  You feel his struggle.  Though it's fairly long, you'll never feel like the movie is dragging on.  Each part is a new challenge, and with each new challenge comes a new stage of the film.

5916950,5,B00EIPEQLW,"When you watch many movies over time you tend to enjoy a movie that is unique; something uncommon that stands out from other movies. This movie has no backstory. It also has no dialogue because there is only one character, Robert Redford, as ""Our Man'.  He has little to say throughout his fight for survival against the uncontrollable natural world in which he finds himself trapped.

Silence and desperation are powerful elements in a movie.  The silence allows-no,compels-your imagination to fill in the blanks of the protagonist's thoughts and emotions.  Without dialogue an actor conveys desperation and a full range of emotion through visual expression, and Robert Redford does it masterfully.

It is fascinating to watch the intensity that Redford brings to the role as he faces the relentless adversity that nature visits upon him. Whether it is a leaking vessel, a devastating storm, or lack of food, the tenacity of Our Man is fascinating to watch. You will be awed along with Redford as he faces the vastness of the sea and the plight in which he finds himself. This is a movie well worth viewing. It takes patience to allow the movie to develop but your patience will be rewarded as you are drawn into his predicament. You will find yourself not only trying to figure out his inner thoughts about each challenge, but also simultaneously attempting to solve the problems yourself. Prepare to immerse yourself in your own thoughts in an attempt to survive.",1453507200,7,1466,4.919028340080971

I've always wanted to sail solo around the world. I always imagined what it would feel like to watch your boat sink and realize that you just spent half a million bucks to die.  True, I'm not a man of the sea, although I had some Forest Gump days in my youth where I worked a Shrimp-boat, a pretty good size 60 foot steel hull, so we went out in some heavy weather.  Being beat half to death in 15 foot seas for 20 hours thinking you were going to die, then waking to a calm and beautiful ocean the next morning, alive is something that has been a high point of my life as a mid-west boy.

However, this character keeps taking one step at a time, the best he can, with some bad decisions and mostly good ones.

5916993,4,B00EIPEQLW,"Robert Redford did a great job of keeping it real in this tale of oceanic sailing and its potential perils. The solitude of being on the sea by yourself has the trade off of being the only one there to deal with the catastrophies that can occur due to mother natures wrath or human error. If you aren't prepared.for the hand you're dealt, you just may not come out alive. I recommend viewing this picture to pretty much anyone. It's slow moving at times and can be a bit depressing, but is quite action packed through some scenes...just like life. It is real life on the sea portrayed well.",1449100800,,590,4.422018348623853

But along with seeing him, the film is engrossing and drew me  into the story.  He said so few words you can count them, so the drama is from his body language and facial expressions.  I am so pleased that he is playing roles appropriate to his age and hasn't ruined his face with medical procedures.
So I truly enjoyed the film all the way to the end.  I did not give it 5 stars because of that ending.  Real life would not turn out like that.",1448496000,,530,4.313131313131313

5917027,3,B00EIPEQLW,Those experienced with sailing may enjoy this picture otherwise it is a little tedious.

Through on screen character development, we quickly understand what this character is about- he is a methodical thinker and keeps his cool when others would panic.
Robert Redford is the everyman/woman that thinks and reacts, tests and analyzes.  He tries to save himself time and time again. It is him against nature, him against himself,  he fights the obstacles-  he almost manages to save himself when the rest of us would have given up...spoiler alert...or does he? This film has all the charm of a Chaplin silent film and forces the viewer to be placed in the lead character's mind.  My high school film class was spellbound by this film.

5917044,4,B00EIPEQLW,"It's an excellent, European style film movie, which is possibly why so many people don't get it. It's to Robert Redford's great credit that you actually forget that there's a camera in place filming the whole thing, and he's brilliant in this, because he never let's his movie star persona get in the way of the character he's playing. The trip, and the predicament this man finds himself in are just metaphors for the problems we all face. He's ill prepared for the situation he finds himself in, but he does his best with what he has, and his inbuilt desire to survive. Like we all do every day. It's beautifully filmed, and the fact that there's no back story in place is perfect, because we can't judge him. What went before? If we knew it would spoil it. And to all the sailing experts - it's not really about sailing at all.  And the ending is perfect.",1447027200,,858,4.430379746835443

5917112,4,B00EIPEQLW,"I enjoyed the movie. Yes, there were indeed some issues with the technical sailing, but sometimes we have to look at metaphors. Redford is a sailor by himself in a classic man vs. nature role. Early on, his ship encounters a container on the open ocean which puts a hole in his hull. I don't believe that was the best hull patch I've seen done, by the way. In the ensuing storm, our hero is forced to abandon ship and proceeds on a number of survival ploys. He creates a solar still to make his water and tries to find some help. The solar still is something that everyone should know how to make. A number of people produced the movie, and I believe that Redford found it quite enjoyable.

Technical note: In the beginning of the movie, we see Redford employing what's called a drogue, or a sea anchor. This item is to help the ship halt its progress in the ocean, and should be deployed during a storm to keep the boat from keeling over.

Despite the negative reviews, the film is enjoyable, and is quite realistic of its depiction of seaboard life.",1444348800,,1051,4.384615384615385

So much could have been done with this movie, but it's like a group of people came together and said hey, let's make a shipwreck movie. End of story. Congratulations.

Unless you are really starved for adventure, on the high seas or otherwise, there are probably other films (even mediocre comedies, documentary, dramas that have a relevant message, etc.) that would be more valuable. As pure art, it is an achievement.  But as far as a worthwhile film experience?  To be honest, we skipped through to the end because it was just too difficult to watch.  There's a vague ""it isn't as easy as it looks"" cautionary tale in there about not overestimating one's skills, but that doesn't really come through.

He begins to throw it, hesitates, and then releases it over the side of the raft. I don't know why...but it has more meaning for me than I am able to explain.

So begins an eight day journey that ends in him deciding to take his last breath and end his misery. Or does it?  His self-deprecating note to loved ones at the beginning of the movie is our only insight into the life of this solo captain. A bad marriage, an affair that let the family down, a running away without saying good bye. Who knows. Believable, thought-provoking. Sort of a MacGyver and Depok Chopa combo. Slow, drawn out. Not for those used to cars blowing up, airplanes crashing or idiots using glocks to take control of the world. Gizers might get the tension in the movie. Reminiscent of Tom Hanks and Castaway.

I know Robert Redford is a great actor, but I almost didn't watch this movie. I couldn't remember seeing any promotions. I added it to my favorites and, when I was bored, I would look through to try and find something to watch. Every time I saw All Is Lost I'd click it. Being an Amazon Prime member, I'd see the green ""Watch It Now"" button. Several times I chose a different movie. But, thankfully, one night I was bored a decided to let it play.

I admit, it started slow. Actually, the whole movie is slow. But slow doesn't mean bad, because this movie is great. And what makes it great is its slow pace. You get involved with the character. You feel for him in his situation. You almost become him, there, on the ocean.

5917296,4,B00EIPEQLW,"Having sailed off short, albeit not solo, I found much of the movie convincing and evocative. While I have certainly heard of sailors being stranded in their life rafts for weeks and weeks, and then living to tell about it, the ending to be a little overly optimistic given the general tenor of the movie. It struck me as odd that Robert Redford would look  miraculously up from the depths of the ocean to see a boat hovering over the fiery wreckage of his life raft. Perhaps the end was not real, but imagined; perhaps the end was meant to be ambiguous. Regardless, I enjoyed the movie, and it brought back some fond memories (not being stove in by a shipping container that is).",1436745600,,680,4.483870967741935

Robert Redford was incredible.  I do not know another actor that could have pulled off this role.  I could NOT pull myself away from this movie.

5917327,5,B00EIPEQLW,"Back in 2007,Robert Redford made a film about the Iraq War in which he starred and directed entitled ""Lions For Lambs"".Despite co- starring with Meryl Streep and Tom Cruise,it became both a critical and commercial flop as it was talky,verbose and lacks a central theme. It took him a while to star in another film as he's done documentaries and directed films. Then he starred in a political thriller ""The Company You Keep"" and finally starred in a film as the lone cast member in ""All Is Lost"". This film written and directed by J.C Chandor is about a man who tries to survive after he finds himself trapped in the sea.

Redford,who is simply known as ""Our Man"",finds himself in the middle of the Indian Ocean. When his sailboat collided with a ship container,he finds the floor of his yacht flooded. This only requires him to abandon it and leave on a ship and try to survive many obstacles in the middle of the sea like a tropical storm,the absence of navigational and communication systems, and lack of food.

This triumph of this movie is the fact that Robert Redford at his age of seventy-six years when it was made has shown that he still has the ability to carry a movie on his own. Also,he provided a memorable performance - probably one of the best if not the best in his career - as the sailor trying to survive being in the middle of the sea considering the challenges he is facing. Despite the fact that there isn't much dialogue in it and many questions aren't answered like why is he alone in the sea,J.C. Chandor provides us an thrilling and entertaining movie that deals with survival in the sea. No question that Redford has gladly rebounded from Lions Of The Lambs and still has the talent to wow his viewers on the big screen.",1435881600,,1746,4.504731861198739

5917341,1,B00EIPEQLW,"As an experienced sailor, this was a great disappointment.  He does everything wrong and does everything late if not too late.  When the wind starts blowing hard, you reduce sail.  You don't wait for it to get out of hand.  If you take on water, you get rid of it immediately and stop anything letting water in.  If your pump isn't working, you either fix it or start hand pumping.  You don't just wait till you can swim in your boat.  At that point you radio for help, not wait till later.  There's something called an Epirb which when the boat flips sends a satellite signal for help.  All he did was wait too long to take action which means he didn't know what he was doing and never should have been out there.  The sea is wonderful, beautiful, and unforgiving.  This is a fantasy in that he should have died.  My wife who doesn't sail agrees with this opinion just from viewing it and having common sense.

5917353,5,B00EIPEQLW,"I have read many of the reviews about this movie and it seems as though many people don't understand the actual intent of the movie. First of all Robert Redford did an excellent job, at 77 years, without any support from any other actors. I can only hope that I look as good and as alert as he is at 77.
 It does not appear that he is reading or following any script or acting at all, he is just there handling the situations as they happen, and the film crew is following all of his movements, very well. There is no real dialogue as one would expect, there is nothing to say. There is no violence in this movie, which is comforting to me.

 There is suspense here and it was hard to take a break from it, like what is going to happen next. What I see is a person that has lost connection at home and decides to take on an ocean voyage in the deep ocean. The movie shows what can happen in Life, or on the ocean, if you are not fully prepared, which in this case he is not. I think what the Screen Writer is saying to all viewers Don't do this alone and unprepared. There are endless possibilities of life threatening situations out there.

This movie is not about a well seasoned mariner at sea, as some people made comment about. The movie is not about the accuracy of the mechanical details. Yes there are mistakes about the usage of some equipment, but who cares. It is about Life itself and not being properly prepared for the many challenges that Life is about, either at home or out in the Wild.

There were some Beautiful Storms at sea and it shows what can happen if you are not properly prepared for these events. The movie shows that the equipment being used and the amateur sailor are not prepared for Life on the open ocean. Redford definitely got wet doing this movie.

 Would I take this on for myself, No Way.

The film crew did an excellent job on the boat and in the water, the shark scenes were well done also.

Certain floating debris, shown in the movie, should not be in the ocean. These 5,000 lbs. objects would not float anyway.  My Compliments to Redford for being one of the Trustees for NRDC. Maybe someday Corporations will stop selling the Planet for Profit.",1434758400,,2188,4.288834951456311

No HAM or single-sideband radio? Not proficient in celestial navigation before leaving the dock? Waiting to mount his storm jib until he was actually in the storm? No personal locator beacon? No 12 gauge parachute flare gun? No solar still or rations pre-packed in the life raft?  And on, and on, and on...

5917513,2,B00EIPEQLW,"There is no irrepressible spirit of hope here.  Not an ounce of humor in the face of disaster.  Plenty of bonehead mistakes on the part of ""Our Man.""

Two stars because the filming was well done, especially from the fish eye point of view (did anyone not get it on seeing the first silver glimmers that sharks were to follow?)  and there was no gratuitous violence.

I heard about the film when it first came out and was intrigued by the idea of Redford in a role somewhat similar to ""Jeremiah Johnson.""  I remembered it and sought it out when I recently read an article written by the guy who wrote the story that was titled  something like ""Redford Lied to Me.""  The author went on to say that contrary to his statements, Redford had no great knowledge of boats.  Yeah, well, an idiot doesn't have to have a great deal of knowledge of boats to know it is stupid to tie your rubber raft to a sinking multi ton vessel and then - yep - (SPOILER ALERT!) go to sleep.  Again.

Disabled vessel - What do you do?  Collect drinking water in a soft rain?  Oh no.  Wait until a storm is broiling to put up a storm sail?  Why bother?  Shave so we can see the mug?  Please.  The shaving scene all those decades ago in ""Jeremiah"" was much prettier.

I can't help but feel sorry for everyone involved.  If only there had been some laugh relief lines... If only the 'no dialog' had gone on until the end when all seemed lost, perhaps we could have worked up some sympathy for Our Man.  I still can't believe any sailor who had as much as pushed a 35+ foot vessel off from a dock would not have a glimmer of understanding about how heavy it is.",1429315200,,1630,4.2272727272727275

5917524,4,B00EIPEQLW,"Engaging story about a man's battle for survival in a relentius ocean.  Great acting by Redford showing determination despite accumulating problems. Scenes on boat are very realistic although there are no wide angle shots showing boat in relation to waves. Have seen terrifying actual shots of sailboats caught in a typhoon off Australia that would have been easy to insert here for more realism and credibility.  Lack of credibility is my main complaint about this as an adventure story.  For instance, why would a yacht design allow for the batteries to be flooded and shorted out so hand pumping would be the only way to bail?  Also, wouldn't waterproof radios be standard aboard any yacht particularly being taken into the expanse of the stormy Pacific?  Likewise, I thought any life raft would come equipped with a waterproof radio that would be battery powered and then when the battery fails to be hand cranked for sending out a SOS signal that could be tracked?  Furthermore, wouldn't a life raft have some way to convert salt water into drinking water?  If not standard equipment I sure would insist on installing before venturing out solo into the Pacific.  Finally, I shared the frustration with Redford trying to signal large container ships that sail by oblivious to his plight.  I get the impression that this may have been intended to symbolize many people's feeling of frustration and helplessness when nobody notices them and sails right on by like in the story of the good sumaratin.",1429056000,,1501,4.948207171314741

Worse than when he played a tree in kindergarten.  I am not a sailor, but this guy seems to take the worst possible moments in his life to start being one!  He doesn't know how to repair his boat?  He doesn't know how to navigate his boat?  He doesn't seem to take much interest in the maintenance of his boat.  Then when things get crappy he spends most of his time dithering.  This guy is fighting for his life and he spends twenty minutes fixing a minor cut on his head.  Honestly I think the character was simply sailing around because he was bored, he pretty much stayed that way.

I guess Redford saw how this did at the box-office and called up Disney.  ""Hey, I am selling out.  So could you put me in a blockbuster?  Thanks!""",1427760000,,891,4.251497005988024

Other posters have covered most everything so I won't give an exhaustive list of the inconsistencies and errors.

All of the issues might have been overcome if we had been drawn into the character in other ways. For whatever reason, we are given no backstory and no idea of what motivates the character in life. Nothing to connect to besides overcoming his sailing issues. For this reason, there is an extra burden placed on the believability of the facts of his situation and his reaction to them.

5917627,5,B00EIPEQLW,"Robert Redford carries this entire movie by himself and does a fine job of it.

Piloting his sailboat by himself and seemingly far removed from any mainland, Redford encounters a huge floating container that has severely damaged his boat. Whether the container is the result of falling off a cargo ship or from a tsunami doesn't really matter, it's that he has limited resources to repair it and with navigational and radio issues arising, he'll be left at the mercy of any storm , while he attempts to find safe harbor. Redford is convincing as a mariner who is adapt at sailing and is not easily unnerved, but begins to quickly accept the gravity of his situation. This quickly becomes a survival story. Though he is not unskilled in what needs to be addressed, nature's elements quickly conspire against him and his resourcefulness is tested to the limit. You can't help but feel his sense of isolation.

5917631,2,B00EIPEQLW,"A compeling idea for a film but so poorly realized.  While I appreciate that keeping a cool head whilst disaster comes for you is a good strategy, Redford's characterer is wholly devoid of any sense of urgency.  He strolls through every emergency as if he was a detached uniterested or univested bystander and in the end makes the whole experience a dreadful bore.

SPOILER:  In the beginning when he wakes from the collision with the half-submerged container and finds the salon already half-filled with water and his boat sinking fast, Redford casually walks around slowly, examines the gaping hole at the waterline with sea water pouring in, determines that his bilge pump(s) are inoperable, goes topside and sees the floating container, etc...displaying absolutely zero emotion or evidence that his sailboat is sinking which is unbelievable because...IT IS!

And this is just the beginning and the film is filled with what are supposed to be hair-raising terrifying and tense moments for our hero but....you'd never know it from Redford's stunningly bland acting or his direction.

In the end, it was impossible to care for a this character whom you assume must be an accomplished sailor to make a circumnavigation of the world, yet makes basic seamanship mistakes throughout (e.g. SPOILER ALERT:  he sees a storm on the horizon heading his way and waits until it is upon him to prepare and secure his boat for the ordeal!  REALLY!!!), displays no emotion whatsoever except for one brief moment of despair, and in the end decides to drown himself.

Well, with the exception that All is Lost stars Robert Redford but apparently Wilson decided he'd had enough of survival movies, because Robert has no co-star.  In a way, I suppose its a lot like the movie Gravity too.  Its about survival until the very last option is used up.  Until then, we use our brain and imagination to figure things out.  The setting of this movie is on a modern private sailing boat with the character played by Robert Redford who is alone, making all the tough decisions with out a think tank handy. Of course there are storms, radios that don't work, and survival tools that we all hope will get him through.  If you are bored, and wonder how you could handle it, watch it.

Evidently we're supposed to figure it out for ourselves. That's just bunk. J.C. Chandor took the lazy way out. He not only directed it, but wrote the screenplay (two lines). You're tormented for an hour and half watching Redford struggle with every imaginable reversal and Chandor couldn't  provide an ending.

Perhaps it was the lack of dialogue that made it strange or distant, I don't know.  I know what I was thinking during his struggles but I would of liked it more it better if it was communicated of what was going on inside the characters mind, words not necessary.  Perhaps a journal entry from time to time.  As I write this, I'm thinking maybe I should watch it again to see if I missed something.

His boat is not the best for single-handed blue water sailing.  Its hatch opening extends nearly to the bottom of the cockpit rather than being at or above the level of the settee.  He seemed to lack adequate shoring and patching materials.  He abandoned ship too soon; experts say not to do so until it sinks away from you.  He could have jury rigged a sail and steering system.

What I found maddening about it was Redford's hesitancy to respond in many situations that would have had me jumping out of my skin.

This movie is a fantastic, suspenseful, on the edge of your seat but quiet adventure. There's very little dialogue considering there's only one character. Robert Redford has always been a favorite actor but seeing him in this was so different from his usual love story or lead character. He did some physical things that were amazing for a man his age but he's always been in good shape. This movie was well worth watching. I may watch it again. I gave it a 4 star because I felt that considering all the horrible messes happening to him, he didn't react the way someone in those positions should have reacted. He was just a little too calm.

The movie captures the growing dangers of the sea, and Redford brings in a marvelous performance in which he says but one or two words during the entire film. Redford reflects pain, wonder, loss, terror through his facial expressions. His eyes, as always, are captivating.

I really wanted to know his story though, why was he out there by himself? what happened after he got rescued, you really develop an attachment to Redfords character making you crave more story, but i guess the mystery is all part of the intrigue.

can't think of a single previous film of his I didn't like.

And I love sailing in storms.

Should be a good fit - right ?

Auggh. . . no. This movie was painful to watch.

As the only actor in the film, Redford presumably did
a credible job that the writer and director wanted.

But the story was depressing from the start.

Most ""castaway"" stories have me eagerly cheering for the character to get rescued - or stay on the island if they decide to live away permanently.

Not this one.

The opening scene tells you he isn't going to make it - and from that point on I really didn't want to watch him succeed - at failing.

I've known some frighteningly terrible sailors, but this character's incompetence piled on top of incompetence tortured its credulity. Anyone that far beyond painfully stupid really doesn't deserve my sympathy (or to get rescued).

Maybe there are some big metaphors in the film, but I couldn't get past the uncredible character.

He was real and showed his emotion (and thoughts even) without words--which is not easy.  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was I kept thinking that too many bad things were happening and it felt overly dramatic.  Like, oh my God, not another bad thing!

I felt so sorry for the guy the whole way through, all the way to the bitter, and then, rejoiceful end. I felt his utter frustration as opportunities kept coming and going.  At the end when he went for broke and gave it his now or never attempt, I wanted his attempt to be successful so much, but with gut wrenching sorrow, he jumps in the water while watching his life raft completely burn up and he finally gives up completely. One thing I kept thinking was why does he not have a satellite emergency beacon device?  These are totally common now, and I would think that certainly everyone that sails alone would have at least two, one being for a backup. The main reason I viewed this movie was because of Redford's wristwatch.  I have this exact watch.  It's a Seiko SKX009 and it would definitely hold up to this kind of endeavor.  It is an amazing and iconic watch.  Anyway, when he looks up and sees the search light I was thinking, no way is he really going to swim back up?

U.S. Americans have become so conditioned to sound effects-gore-nudity-CGI that when a simple movie comes along attempting to convey a message about being HUMAN, they can't comprehend the meaning. This movie is not about a man who gets a hole in his boat. It's about using every ounce of energy you have to keep your composure and SURVIVE. -1 star because it ends abruptly. But I mean seriously, he is alone on the sea, what dialogue do people want? This is why you can't take Amazon or Netflix reviews for face value. People are simply to conditioned to enjoy a realistic movie. ""Give me t*ts and explosions! Yeah!""

Personally, I love it when a film goes quiet -it's always much more interesting. It's a visual medium after all.... Redford is great, the camerawork is great. It wouldn't give it any awards, but it's a stout film and it's a lot better than all the other mass-appeal crap out there. I really liked it. This is nothing like Castaway, it's much more withholding and I suppose most people would appreciate a little more character information, but I love the approach this film takes. If you prefer typical, obvious Hollywood fare, then you may yawn at this, but if you know strong, subtle cinema when you see it, you should see it in this film.",1418515200,,776,4.55

I am a sailor, and think that noone who has ever been at sea or in any survival situation will appreciate this film. I really tried with this film - I wanted it to get better but it never did. Redford is also too old for this role - seriously, who would believe a 77 year old would be sailing the Southern Ocean alone? I don't care how great a sailor he is (and the character is not a good sailor) - it was not remotely interesting to watch an old guy alone for 2 hours.

5918214,5,B00EIPEQLW,"There is a very weird assumption in almost all of the negative reviews here that Redford's character is an experienced sailor. If it's true that he's making a lot of mistakes, why not simply make the obvious assumption that he is NOT experienced and is in fact relatively green and self-taught? We don't know a lot about him, but from the note he wrote it certainly sounds like he is a bit troubled. He probably jumped headfirst into sailing as late midlife crisis, without bothering to learn all of these tricks and buy all of this fancy equipment that the 'experienced sailors' around here keep complaining he should have had and used. If you really enjoy quibbling, why not stick with computer hacker movies such as Skyfall? We are well over a decade into the twenty-first century and critics will still gladly accept pixiedust computer virus nonsense as hard-hitting drama, but heaven forbid there should be a movie that suggests there exists a single person in the world, nearing the end of his life and apparently filled with some degree of remorse, who would be willing to go sailing even though he's not an expert.

There are probably still a few errors, including the dramatic effectiveness of the sea anchor on the shipping container, but if you let these slight lapses in realism ruin this movie for you I'm not sure how you could possibly enjoy any movie, ever. They might have had shots of Redford shaving while he was on the raft in the original cut of the movie but they could have been cut for pacing reasons. We saw him shaving earlier in the movie, after a serious crisis has already occurred (and remember he's alone in the middle of the Indian ocean, at which point I think most guys would probably get a little lazy) so it's well established quirk of his personality. The movie doesn't unfold in real time (8 days, remember?) so I'm happy to give him the benefit of the doubt that he had a razor or sharp knife on the raft and shaved a couple more times.  Are you guys also going to argue it's unrealistic because they didn't show us the multiple times he surely had to pee?

So if we can leave the quibblers behind us for a moment, what are we left with? As with Hemingway's The Old Man and the Sea, it's a story that doesn't really benefit from a literal, factual summary. Most religious people (be they Abrahamic, Eastern or other) will probably find it to be a moving tale symbolic of their religion. Most nonreligious people will find it to be no less moving tale symbolic of the human condition.

It's about a man lost at sea trying to do everything he can do to survivor. And besides, who knows how much technical navigating experience this man had? He could have been a relative novice taking on more than he can chew. Watch it for the amazingly dialogue-less performance of the great Robert Redford. It's a pity he didn't get more nominations for his acting here. And let's not forget the amazing crew who had to set many of those shots above and below the water. I've read water shots are the most difficult to stage. Kudos to this crew that heald this whole movie together as inconspicuously as possible so the audience could just concentrate on Redford's brilliant performance.

5918332,5,B00EIPEQLW,"Loved this movie! I know a lot of people thought that Robert Redford's character didn't show enough emotion, but I can't imagine an intelligent person acting otherwise. People who go over the top and lose it are the ones that don't make it through a crisis usually. Also, why didn't he have a bunch of modern gadgets with him? He is old school. Some people want to step up to a challenge, and what is more challenging than facing the sea?  That one going over so many heads is just sad. Lot's of actual sailors found a lot of flaws, but for someone completely inexperienced the movie was believable and well shot. It was quiet and gripping right from the start. A character study that makes a person think 'would I be able to persevere like that, or would I break?'  And, as always, Redford was amazing.

There was a lot of Murphy's law in this movie along with irony and dumbness. This movie is true to human nature. It shows us that disaster happens when your least prepared. Bad luck comes when you take chances. And the brain farts when we're overtired & undernutrition.

Hindsight bias causes other viewers of this movie to call it stupid and give it a 1 star rating. They are closed minded and give a 1 star rating to any movie that is not exactly like they expect it to be. This is a 4 star movie once you understand what it is telling you.

As the weather and sea conditions worsen, Redford's ingenuity and sheer determination aid in his struggle to survive. Throughout, there is virtually no dialogue, and Redford must rely on facial expressions and body language to convey what is going on in his mind. Is his character a metaphor for Everyman? Perhaps.

5918411,3,B00EIPEQLW,"Redford is, hands-down, my favorite actor of all time.  And that's saying a lot.  Unfortunately, he didn't direct this one, or his acting could have been superb.  As it is, the director allowed him to rely far too much on his pat facial expressions (the squinting eyes while he tilts his head, the biting of the lower lip, rolling his eyes up and to the left to signify he's listening or thinking, etc.) that worked just fine when he was younger, or still do when he's having dialog with another actor, instead of pushing him toward the excellence he's capable of.  In my opinion, he's still the sexiest man on the planet, and is in phenomenal shape.  But his hands were tied in this pitiful, hole-studded plot (or lack thereof) that consists of him being- guess what?- lost at sea.  I liked the concept- no dialog (expect for that one great yawping ""F#@K!) to speak of; this would have been fine, and quite refreshing, had they shown any backstory, or how he got there, or who the woman was who left her hat and scarf in the vessel, maybe by a few shots of his journal, a couple of documents, framed photos, etc.  We don't know who he is, so why should we care?  Especially since he makes so many mistakes?  Excellent cinematography, no unnecessary SFX.  A really bizarre and inappropriate instrumental music score simply grates on the nerves.  (Uh, no, I won't be buying the soundtrack.)  Overall, a completely predictable, poorly directed film that takes our country's Greatest Living Leading Man, and still the Sexiest Man Alive, and wastes his enormous talent, film smarts, energy and professionalism on a lackluster vehicle that could have been acted by Marcel Marceau.  Please, Bob!  Don't let this be your last film!  You still have so much to offer!

Would a ship that size/type really roll over and over in the water? Why did his bilge pump not work, aren't they designed to work when wet? Where is his back-up navigation? Really, he went on a solo sail in the middle of an ocean, and he didn't know how to sail without electronic navigation devices? What kind of survival kit, especially on an ocean-sailing boat doesn't have any kind of system to obtain drinking water? I know filters don't remove salt, but he didn't even have anything to catch all that nice rain water that fell every time the writers needed another dramatic moment or an evaporation kit (although he finally figured out how to rig one). Why in the heck did he wait so long to try fishing? Survival kit for a boat without a decent flair gun? I take mini-flare devices when I hike alone plus a signalling mirror and a whistle that can be heard for over a mile. Basic gear for a survival kit for day hikes. On a boat by myself - my kit would be better equipped than his for sure.
The movie and the character of ""Our Man"" were at times so annoying I almost stopped watching. However, Redford's acting was outstanding especially considering it was mostly done through body language and facial expressions. I don't know of many actors who could pull something like this off. Tom Hanks did it, and did it well, but I really can't think of anyone else. Tom Hank's character in ""Cast Away"" was much more interesting and engaging than ""Our Man,"" but that's due to the writers and director.
One last thought - can any one person have that much bad luck in just 8 days? I know some of it was his poor planning, but wow!",1416182400,,1786,4.379518072289157

5918509,1,B00EIPEQLW,"I did not like the movie because of the bad acting, unbelievable actions by the main character, a sailor that was able to make it all the way to the Indian Ocean before running into trouble, and the unrealistic scenarios presented in the movie. I am not hung up on realism but I think this movie was intended to be realistic.

I have been sailing many years but I am not going pick through the many details that are wrong with this movie, but I think many are easy to pick up even by those who haven't been on the water. Some as basic, as ""If you have a hole in the hull and you don't fix it you may sink"". Redford's character did not seem to pickup on this detail. Keeping the ports shut in a storm would help to.

But not ""All Was I Lost"", I only lost about two hours watching this terrible movie.  I had more enjoyment reading the negative reviews and their responses / rebuttals.  I really laughed when I read some of the rebuttals that said Redford's bad acting and his character's stupid actions where actually some kind of metaphor with a deeper meaning.

He is almost devoid of emotion as the disaster happens around him. Redfords character is defined in the scene where, amidst of all the ruin around him, he goes about his morning shave. The viewer does not know why he is asea in the open ocean away from land and out of the shipping lanes.  Is he running away from some tragedy?  Is that the reason for his emotional flatness?  We will never know but it opens a whole motive for dialog with friends and movie groups.

This movie got so-so ratings, I think mainly because we live in a culture where action and loudness are a criteria sought out on the screen.

Why isn't your junk properly stowed? Where is your PFD? Why aren't you using your safety harness at all times? WHY didn't you gather your survival food/water/gear sooner? Where is the bilge pump?

Even the editing was poor, for example, Redford is supposed to be standing on a life raft waving to a nearby barge in an effort to be rescued.  Standing on a raft? C'mon, standing and waving without any sign of wobbling or struggle?  His large ring he wore throughout the film is seen in some scenes but not others.

He can't talk  - not even ""sailor lingo""  when alone on his boat as to the radio problems or container in his hull.  Totally not right.  I can't change oil on my 3 cylinder Perkins by my self without cussing a storm.  Movie was a great idea - but was lost at shore - not at sea.  Don't even get me started on the ending.

5918655,3,B00EIPEQLW,"SPOILER ALERT.  This is an interesting movie with many twists.  In fact, too many twists to make the story seem realistic in this day and age.  As another reviewer mentioned, all this guy (played by Robert Redford) needed was a GPS guided EPIRB to get rescued.  And just due to the fact that the main character in the movie didn't think of getting a GPS guided EPIRB on his yatch sailing in the middle of Indian Ocean, we end up with this wonderful story about one man's relentless quest to survive in the face of insurmountable obstacles and hopelessness.  This is a movie with a nuanced philosophical message.  It tries to glorify a man's will to live and will to survive through impossible situations.  This sort of embodies Nietzchenean philosophical ideals with Darwinian undertone.  Also, this movie sits at the right center of ""one man's battle against the nature"" genre.  There are a number of movies already made on this very particular theme and setting (floating on the ocean on a yatch).  This movie plays with that same atmospheric suspense and story line used by the previoius movies on this theme.  I wouldn't say that the movie is much better than all the other previously made movies on this theme/genre.  However, I would say this movie distinguishes itself by putting together the most unfortunate, yet foreseeable twists and turn of events, leading the main character down through a endlessly depressing downward spiral with many defeated hopes.  Compared to the other movies of the genre, I think the writer of the script had a particular talent for writing a very depressing story that can evoke strong sympathy and cause the viewer to empathetically experience the main character's plight and depression.  In that regard, the movie definitely stands out from the peck.  If you feel like watching an extremely depressing story that again and again causes you to get your hopes defeated, and makes you feel completely hopeless and wratched until the very end of the movie, this movie might serve you well.  Or, if you are searching for a meaning of life and what makes a life worth living, as philosophized in Albert Camus' Myth of Sysiphus, this might be a worthwhile movie as a sort of a thought experiment demonstrated out on a screen.  Other than for those two reasons, I would not recommend this for a Saturday night family movie, or a chick flick night with a girl friend.  Very depressing.  Very avant garde, but the story writer must have been a sadistic prick to put the main character through such series of unfortunate twists and turn of events.",1414195200,,2577,4.8159090909090905

Like others, you have to make up your own reason as to why this older gentleman was out on the water, in the Indian Ocean; all alone, and seemingly without modern day electronic devices that are standard on boats today.

It was one of those mesmerizing tales of moment to moment wonder.  Asking why did he do that?  But watching Redford handle his seafaring difficulties was truly hypnotizing. I could not turn it off until I saw Redford's last grasp at holding on to life.  I agree that Redford was ""Breathtakingly Exciting"" (Rex Reed, New York Observer).  I would not want to watch this movie again as it was truly about suffering .

The ending was very edgy.  You sit wondering what will happen with the fire, the raft, the man and the rescue.  The ending knocked my breath away like Tom Hanks, in ""Cast Away"" on the forlorn highway with 4 destinations of choice.

His reactions are so wrong and so slow that even my kids are yelling at the screen!  I told them that maybe there was a book that filled out the story behind his life, or gave some context - could be a good read if someone actually took time to fill in the life behind the sailing sloth.

Hell, anything critical in a plastic bag would have been a good idea!  You think shaving before the storm instead of putting more epoxy on the lame patch you put on the gaping hole in the side of your boat is the way to go?

But so many things about this movie seemed implausible to me.  One thing was that the boat capsized and then righted itself twice, but it did not fill up with water until later when a hole opened up in the side.  Now, maybe air pressure forms a bubble and would keep the hold from filling up, but... I don't know.  Then the raft capsized, but it still had all his salvaged stuff in it later, including his hat!  I wondered about a few of things you listed, like the climb to the top of that pole to connect something, and the radio not working.  Our man did seem rather amateurish and unprepared.  That takes away from the story.

As to saying he lacked the modern technology to stay in touch -- give me a break.  This is a movie, not a how-to video.  If he had a satellite radio we would have no movie to begin with.

5918767,5,B00EIPEQLW,"Back in high school I learned roughly that you can divide epic stories into three types: man vs. man, man vs. nature, and man vs. himself. This movie nails two of these: man vs. nature and man vs. himself, and it does an excellent job of doing this.

If you've ever been in the deep ocean, you'll know that it can be an extremely hostile environment and it can easily give you the feeling that you're in a place that man really wasn't meant to visit. It can be scary. No, terrifying. Absolutely terrifying. And this movie gives you a fairly good idea of what that environment's like and what it must feel like to try to survive in it.

And it quickly became clear to me that the single character in this movie is dealing with some internal issues that added an element of man vs. himself to the story.

It definitely required a certain suspension of disbelief to really appreciate this story. The lone sailor made lots of mistakes that an experienced sailor would never have made. Lots of them.

Maybe that was supposed to indicate that the lone sailor wasn't really as competent as you might have first thought. Or it might have been because the people making this movie just didn't worry about that level of detail. So if you worry about details being realistic or not, you may find this movie a bit trying.

But we make those sorts of allowances all the time. Any sci-fi, fantasy, horror or action movie plays fast and loose with realism, but that's probably because real-life just isn't as entertaining as fiction. And if you can forgive the lack of plausibility in other movies, why not also forgive it here?

Star Wars absolutely fails when it comes to a realistic depiction of, well, lots and lots of things. But it's still a fun movie that's worth watching. Similarly, All Is Lost can be a fascinating combination of one man's epic struggle with both nature and himself, but you may have to have a willing suspension of disbelief to see it as that.

And if the battle of man vs. nature doesn't sound appealing to you, you'll probably end up being very bored with this movie. You might not even make it past the first few minutes.",1413504000,5,2137,4.506459948320414

The afterthought of the film is a good premise of never giving up, continually fighting regardless of what comes your way...but this is not a film for the entire family unless all members recognize the point of the film, which occurs only at the end. Waste of my freaking dollar at red box. The music during the entire film is off set to demonstrate this man's inner conflict/demons versus his battle of survival and the elements, which is even at times almost a demonic haze of Dante's 7th level of Hell.

5918781,5,B00EIPEQLW,"Interesting that there is practically no dialogue. However, there were moments when I was not impressed with the overacting, especially coming from such a consummate professional as Redford. Much of the time, I felt him trying too hard to point out the obvious to the camera. In these moments, I was suddenly aware of a set and a crew and all that goes with it. Perhaps it was too much to expect without the ability to interact. The audience is quite capable of imagining themselves in his shoes and infusing the action with their own emotions. For me, much of the time when I was trying to feel sorry for him, but I kept remarking to myself that sailing is a self-inflicted disaster. No one put a gun to his head and made him go out to see all alone obviously as ill-equipped as he was to take on the challenge. Hidden suicide wish? Possibly. Redford is restrained in this work. Even in his most desperate expression, I once again felt that the presence of a crew and equipment might have made him subconscious. It was not bare. It was not raw. It was guarded. It was self-conscious. A man alone on the sea in dire straights is not worrying about how he looks. In spite of all that, I still give it five stars. The story, the filming of it, the ability to create suspense and the way the film managed to make me imagine what would I do if I were in his place was quite an accomplishment.",1413417600,,1388,4.342307692307692

A number of mishaps land him in dangerous predicaments. Redford here is a very low-key actor, actually not my favorite in terms of acting ability.

I admit I am no seasoned expert or sailor but as movie, I found it gripping, entertaining and fun to watch. It was never predictable and held my interest until the ending which is rare for modern films these days. I personally don't care if the character makes dumb mistakes that are not text book solutions to the situation at hand because I know that people react to emergency situations in different ways. Many things set in such as tension, fear, fatigue and murphy's law so nobody is ever perfect under duress or pressure. So with that said, I think Robert Redford was great in this role and he did far mor right than he did wrong. nobody ever said he was an expert navigator anyway. I think that if you watch this movie with an open mind and a nice bowl of popcorn, it can be highly enjoyable as far as adventure films go. After all, it wouldn't be entertaining if he did everything right because if he had, he would not be human and that's precisely why I gave this 4 and a half stars because it's teh human factor that will make this fun to watch countless times.",1413158400,,1229,4.418502202643172

5918847,4,B00EIPEQLW,"Realized early on that this movie is a metaphor for all the losses that occur in the latter part of life.  For a while, you think that you can use the habits and trappings that you have accumulated, and your smarts, to protect you.  The a big problem crops up, there is a crack, a hole in the hull of your protective illusion.  It's OK, you've got the resourcefulness to deal with it.  But at a certain point, the catastrophes and losses just keep coming, until you are stripped of everything you thought you had, every resource you thought you had to protect yourself.  In the end, you are stripped, hoping for someone to rescue you, with no way left to fight.  It is just you, hoping to survive another day.  But ultimately, we all lose that battle.  Ultimately, for all of us, ""All Is Lost.""  Apparently there is some debate about whether or not the main character survives, the ending could be interpreted either way.  But since everything leading up to that point has been this stripping away, I tend to think that his death would be more thematically consistent with all that came before. However, the movie gives you an ""out"" if you want to believe otherwise.  Just like illusions of heaven give us an ""out"" when we consider death.",1413072000,2,1238,4.531531531531532

I'd say that one either loves or hates this movie, except that woudn't explain so many 2-4 star ratings.

Anyway, about the sailing content of the movie ... I've had some sailing training and experience (no open ocean crossings, though) and I did notice many of the flaws pointed out in these reviews. However, what you don't know is the background of ""our man"", and maybe that points to a subtle genius behind the lack of dialog. It leaves one free to speculate, so here's one wild-a**ed scenario: maybe he was a pretty handy DIY-type old guy but complete sailing novice who, towards the end of his life after losing his spouse and receiving a grim diagnosis from his own doctor, just bought a boat and took off on a what-have-I-got-to-lose adventure after a sailing course or two. If you think no one would ever embark on an open water voyage so ill-prepared, read ""Maiden Voyage"" by Tania Aebi. By all rights she should never have survived the Carribean, let alone made it around the globe.

I bought this DVD to watch with my father and brother who are avid high-seas sailors.  We suffered through the Redford character's illogical mistakes and sophomoric decisions that launched him in an escalating crisis that was largely avoidable and survivable by sailors with a pinch of nautical knowledge and common sense.

Puzzling that there are almost as many 1-star reviews as 5-star reviews here. It was not a perfect film but I found it exciting, could easily relate to it and connect with the character. Robert Redford is a great actor and was able to pull this off, expressing what he was thinking without the benefit of dialogue, except for reading the note at the beginning that he placed in a sealed bottle and threw into the sea near the end of the movie. I listened to it again, trying to tease out its meaning and clues to the many unknowns.

Redford has such stamina, at 77, doing most, if not all of the scenes himself. I loved the actor's stoicism, lack of panic, ability to ""think on his feet"" to quickly come up with ideas and ""jury rig"" solutions to the mishaps and bad luck events as they occurred.  I know many of his solutions and preparedness were flawed. I'm no sailing expert and I'm sure he made many mistakes, but I believe that was not the point of the film. I think the message conveyed was that he thought he did his best throughout life, but also felt it was not enough. He tried to do the ""right"" things by others, but believed he somehow came up short, failing to achieve or fulfill his best intentions.

My biggest surprises were his sailing ineptitude, attaching his life raft to a sinking boat and then falling asleep, his log book and maps never getting wet, lighting that fire in the raft, which actually wound up saving him in the end. It's like he was doubling down on his survival, all or nothing type of action. I think his lack of sailing knowledge and ability may have been done purposely to somehow give us more keys to understanding the trip and his life. Also, very poignant, was his letting go, shown by his resignation at the end, that it was over for him (All Is Lost), by letting himself slip under the water and slowly descending into the sea. I'm glad it ended as it did.

I did make the mistake of viewing the film again after reading the many reviews here and on IMDB, especially those who have had sailing experience and expertise. Instead of giving more insight to the story, character and motivation, the second viewing only served to diminish the film in my eyes, mostly due to all the technical errors that I was now aware off, his apparent lack of judgment and credibility. On the first viewing I would have given it 4-stars and after the second viewing it dropped to three, so 3.5 stars for this film is about right.  It's a shame because it had so much potential if more attention was paid to detail, the story, realism and some character background divulged to enrich the experience.",1412553600,,2639,4.455486542443064

5918961,1,B00EIPEQLW,I didn't make it to the end of this incredible boring movie.  Mr. Redford wasted his talent and his (or someone's) money on this selfimportant rip-off of so many lost at sea stories.  By the end of the first hour I couldn't wait for the Redford character to die and get the viewers suffering over.  I have been a big fan of Redford over his whole career.  We are the same age and I am so glad to see a talented actor continue to excerise their craft will in their later years.  But this one will not be on my list of memorable performances by this very gifted man.,1412467200,,564,4.137614678899083
5918962,1,B00EIPEQLW,SPOILER ****  This guy should have died at least 36 different times.  Whoever wrote this has clearly never been sailing and has never been on a boat.  This was without a doubt the worst acting and the worst screen play I've seen in a while.  And the ending was RIDICULOUS.  He sank at least 40 feet down and then suddenly found the strength to swim to that open arm?  Really?  Really?  No.  This had no basis in reality and I'm sure all the other actual boaters out there were groaning 90% of the movie wondering what STUPID thing he was going to do next.,1412467200,,555,4.259615384615385

Leaving a flotation device on the boat when he had ample room in the life raft for it?  Letting the cap come unscrewed on his water jug so it filled up with salt water?

There is SO much wrong with this movie.  As a sailor it makes me wonder how the hell he got to the Indian ocean in the first place in one piece, then it just goes into a spiral of poor choices and self pity that is just cringingly hard to watch.

1. Solo sailors don't sleep in the v berth, they take short naps on watch in place in the cockpit, or in a berth close to the hatch.
2. FILL UP THE HOLE WITH SOMETHING.
3. Do not leave the free floating dock where you can make repairs, or jibe and fill your boat with water.
4. Why isn't he carrying any repair wood?  If nothing else rip off a cabinet door to back the repair on that hole.

From here there is just a spiral of stupid that gets worse and worse until he SETS THE LIFE RAFT ON FIRE.

As some of the other reviewers pointed out, I sat through most of the movie asking my self questions like, why is he sailing with such a small rickety boat in the middle of the Indian Ocean? Should he not have better equipment? How many cans of beans did you bring? Or as my son said, they don't even tell you anything about thus guy. Why is he alone sailing. What is his actual story. To me I didn't care, but I guess some movie watchers will feel this is imperative to the story.

However, I guess due to the ending, I found it to be a bit mind provoking and couldn't get the movie out of my head for the next two days. After seeing this the only boat I would ever want to be captain of, is the toy remote ones you sail in a pond!",1412121600,,873,3.9885714285714284

5919117,5,B00EIPEQLW,"Ignore the reviews from armchair admirals this is a drama not a survival at sea instructional video and yes the character makes survival mistakes but they are all highly realistic and common ones that have been made by many folks at sea and that adds to the deep realism. This is a highly realistic depiction of the types of challenges one may face at sea (just check out the technical advisers they had on this film and don't take an anonymous reviewers opinion on it).  The film is fast paced but in an unusual way. There are no alien invaders or bad guys with guns but what there is here is constant realistic genuine life or death peril such as that one might actually face in real life.  A classic ""man vs nature"" and ""man vs machine"" (his boat) drama that keeps the outcome uncertain until the final frames.  I was held in rapt attention and felt as though I was with Redford's character. Beautifully filmed with very very subtle CGI that I found to be so convincingly real I felt as though every moment was something I could taste feel and smell having experienced some of the same things depicted in the film it brought me right back to see from my living room couch.

Highly recommended from this sailor and film buff.  Take the comments downplaying the technical accuracy of survival skills with a grain of salt. Any film that depicts activities such as these tends to attract comments from the kind of folks that love to show off how smart they are by trying to point out every ""mistake"" made by the characters.

""Our Man"" (Redford's character) faces obstacle after obstacle on his solo voyage aboard a Cal 39 through the Indian Ocean, and finds himself digging deeper and deeper into his reserves of courage and resourcefulness. After the introduction, there's only one word of monologue - and given the overall pessimistic course of the film, it's easy to guess the word.

But technical errors ruined the experience for me. Willing suspension of disbelief only goes so far. I won't enumerate the errors here - they are numerous and glaring and, at times, laughable.

5919140,5,B00EIPEQLW,"I'm not sure anyone else actually saw this movie. It's not a metaphor for life, as such, nor is it a man versus nature saga; rather, it's a commentary about the plight of the average person in the face of unbridled capitalism and mass consumerismand it is executed brilliantly. First, to my point, Redford never really speaks in the movie, signaling the voicelessness of the average person in the world today. In the beginning we find him sailing along in a small, but comfortable boat minding his own business, when out of nowhere his boat strikes a container floating in the middle of the ocean. It's is a container of shoes. How insane that something like tens of thousands of pairs of shoes could possibly endanger the life of a person. But, such is the case with mindless consumerism. Redford manages, with some good old fashioned American ingenuity, to patch the hole in his ship with some fiberglass, but that can only be a brief fix. His ship is in danger, his life is in danger. Eventually his boat has taken enough damage that he is forced into his life raft. This is an amazing scene where you almost want Redford to stay with the boat, even though it is clearly sinking, because, even in its damaged state, it still represents comfort and stability. Does this remind anyone of America? Alas, the ship sinks and all he has is his life raft. This move proves somewhat promising as he is able to make use of some more antique technologies, a stetson for example, which nevertheless help him survive. Perhaps a return to a simpler time and way of life is the answer to this onslaught of consumerism. But here, too, we see that danger is just outside the dooror beneath the raft, as it were. At first just little fish make their home beneath his raft. Maybe this is a good thing; he is, after all, the bigger ""fish,"" and so they might provide food for him. In another classic scene he in fact gets a fish on the line, only to have it eaten by a yet bigger fish. Isn't that the way in America? The little guy finally gets a foothold and some bigger fish comes and takes the prize right out of his hands!
That everyone seems to have missed the point of the cargo ships passing him by is staggering. This is THE apex of the moviethe entire point is found in this scene. Here is this person, adrift at sea because of some container of shoes that ran into him, and the very engines of economy which promise better lives for those they serve just pass him by. Again, he is voiceless, he can barely manage to yell ""help."" But that is the point. Even if they could have heard or seen him they wouldn't have stopped. They have products to deliver to an insatiable public and nothing can stop them from getting their wares to the market. In this scene, the entire economy of consumers is indicted for the state of this man lost at sea. Anyone who found this scene to be strange, out of place, frustrating, has missed the beauty and reality of the message. We are all accountable for the plight of our fellow man!
Finally, Redford gives up hope and thinks it best to just kill himself. But he gets saved. And by whom? By an indigenous fisherman. It wasn't the giant cargo ships with all their technology and resources that saved him; instead it was a simple man who was willing to go out of his way for the sake of his fellow man.
Seems obvious enough. Anyway, it was a great film that should challenge all American's, because we are the reason those cargo ships pass by those little people who are lost at sea and who are just trying to do their best to survive.",1411689600,2,3559,4.410334346504559

5919154,4,B00EIPEQLW,"An engaging but intense allegory. Unfortunately, much of the symbolism would require another viewing.  For example, there are several shots from under the life raft with the bottom of the life raft in a circle of light as a focal point and the dark blue of the ocean around that circle.  The shots are progressive in that the first shot is a close up with tiny crustacions, then a farther removed shot, then a shot of a school of minnows, then a school of minnows pursued by larger fish, then larger fish pursued and captured by a larger fish, then a school of sharks. In the final scenes, the shot is of the life raft in a circle of fire with Redford falling into the depths.  Just what had the director intended with these progressive shots? The wonderful problem solving of Redford on the yacht to each obstacle that arose was an encouragement for the viewer to anticipate a happy ending.  Yet, with a great deal of skill, the director left our household wondering and arguing about whose hand it was that reached into the water: was it a man or was it God?
Perhaps, the title itself is a reference to Job on his dung heap surveying his ruin?  Perhaps it is an allegory about human life and its ultimate point -- meaning what?",1411603200,,1229,4.444444444444445

5919253,4,B00EIPEQLW,"Although a bit claustrophobic and a bit overlong, as would be the case with any story that takes place on a small sailboat with a older man all alone struggling against the elements with some very bad luck, not to mention a ridiculous amount of frustration, for about an hour and forty-five minutes. I have to add there were some original moments of tension for both our Everyman and the viewing audience, not seen in an all water-world setting before.

It does keep the viewers attention and in the end has a unique way of bringing home a very good message to anyone battling their demons all alone or for their life in any situation against all odds. Oddly enough I thought  about actor Robin Williams while watching this film, with his suicide fresh on my mind, thinking this is the kind of personal battle he might have found strength in.

This tale of survival, which one would think is a true story, or why make us suffer along with our Everyman here. If it isn't a true story, of someone's actual suffering, why put us through it at all? However it turns out it's not the point whether it's true or not, it's very compelling for it is a story that is universal in how to be courageous and steadfast while fighting ridiculous odds to survive.

I have to disagree with the films title because it sounds like our Everyman is already beat before he even starts his journey, thus I'm guessing a lot of people may have avoided this film thinking it's an exercise in relentless futility, with no possibility of a happy ending, which it happens, is not really the point of this film. It's more about the journey one goes through to arrive at an ""All Is Lost"" scenario.

However after almost 2 hours of yelling at my TV for someone to help this poor schmuck woefully unprepared for how far out to sea he ends up. He's the only human being in this sprawling film and is played very well as expected, by Robert Redford who at his current age of 77 looks and acts totally acceptable as our Everyman whose age adds to the relevance of this story, at no time do you think this guy is so old the outcome is somehow less important because he's lived a long life already. It serves to show that a person of advanced age is not ""Dead in the water"" (no pun intended) as would be the case in films such as ""Titanic"" that gives survival rites to only women and children, Kudos to the filmmakers for letting us root for an older guy and for the very relevant casting of a 77 year old man still in his prime.

My biggest gripe and the only real question I raise here concerning this film is just how calmly our victim takes his knocks and he takes a lot of knocks only to cry-out in disgust at his really bad luck only once, which seemed rather unrealistic to me. However Mr. Redford is a brilliant Filmmaker and actor and he must have had his reasons for playing the character in such an accepting manner to his ever growing obvious fate.

His matter of fact calm in the face of such absurd and deadly conditions of life and death consequences leaves me wondering why it was played out with so little anger and raw emotion. I think it needed just a little more outcry's and still would have left us respectful of our lead character and the utter frustrations this film will take you and him through before it's final tearful ending, by the way, that was in no way a spoiler as to how this film will end! It ends with a point well taken and well received and will serve as the reason this film was made.

Wait till your in the mood for this kind of silent desperation film, it's perfect for those who look for quieter films for late night viewing, if your movie watching may keep someone else in your house awake.

It is a Silent film in every sense of the word, to say the least and works well as one and in retrospect, it can be dedicated to all the victims of the open sea, in which many men and women have struggled for their lives over the centuries, and even if not based on a true story it is undeniably true to so many sad struggles for life on or off the open sea.

Well worth seeing for reasons you'll have to see for yourself.

This film is full of Trials and Tribulations and a good lesson for all, on how to bravely face whatever life throws at you, maybe not the best entertainment for a night out at the movies to escape reality, but well worth the ride when in the mood for a life affirming poignant film.

It doesn't have to have over-the-top special effects.
It doesn't have to have a great message.
Or the greatest story line.
Or the biggest stars, directors or cinematographers...

Time after time, despite his ingenuity and perseverance, Redford's character's attempts to survive are thwarted by fate, as if he were terminally ill. The title and intro to the movie imply that defeat is imminent, and that Redford must ultimately accept his fate, as anyone facing death must do.

5919383,2,B00EIPEQLW,"In some industries, the following refrain is common:

Ship the product!  Ship the product! Ship the product!
SELL SELL SELL!  Bugs? Those can be fixed later.

It is hard to imagine you've been scammed watching a movie.  After all, the picture was clear.  There were nice special effects when the ship flipped over in the waves.  The filmmakers do a reasonable job of sharing the frustrations of the main character with the audience, although CASTAWAY was much, much better in this regards.

*SPOILERS AHEAD*

But that's what happened, because you didn't get the darkness that was promised at the beginning.  And if you go back and watch the beginning again, you are left with a set of events that is inconsistent with the ending.

Watching the beginning, we see the main character at the shipping container that damaged his boat, creating a final message for his journal or perhaps those who find his dead body.  The next scene then flashes back to 8 days earlier, where he frees his boat from the container.  There is a reasonable expectation that he will meet up with the container or a container again, but that never occurs.

At the end of the movie, this opening is discarded and there appears to be a happy ending.

The audience is then forced into a dilemma.  Which is the true ending?  The ""happy"" ending, which doesn't mesh with the man writing his final journal entry while at the container or the initially foreshadowed ending.  Either requires some abstraction of the opening scene.  Or was the happy ending a near-death delusion, as has been argued about GRAVITY?

Since there is no ""answer"", It seems easier to propose a real world explanation rather than coerce the film-world reality to twist like a pretzel.

We start with an idea for a movie: a dark tale of failure and frustration, set at sea.  Imagine that the sailor had sunk to the death at the end, with no one to help, or even with help just beginning to arrive.

Now if you've ever lived in Southern California you know that often movies get audience tested.  The testing that I've seen and participated in occurs well after scripts are written and most of the scenes are filmed (so that it appears to the test audience as a movie) -- but before public release.  I can just see some viewers saying, ""that's too depressing,  could you give it a happy ending, make it a tale of redemption?""  If there is enough of that, then the investors and/or top managers will demand the ending be rewritten.

Now the cheapest way is to change only the very end.

Changing the beginning to be self-consistent costs more money....

And, in my opinion, that seems to be what they did.",1410912000,,2642,4.643628509719222

Mr. Redford, you don't go below deck in your sailboat to shave your face with a hellish-looking thunderstorm steaming right towards you. And you damn sure don't bring a road flare to a flare gun fight. A road flare? Seriously?! He waved a road flare?! Who carries road flares on a boat in the middle of an ocean?! I saw this film just now on an EPIX free preview and I STILL want my money back. In the note he was reading in voice-over at the beginning of the film, I sure hope Redford was apologizing not to his character's family but to the entire, viewing audience.

5919444,3,B00EIPEQLW,"I have mixed feelings about this film. Altho I always thought of Redford as god's gift to women, i never thought of him as a great actor (tho a better director).  This is obvious in the beginning dialogue... ""Our Man"" is a man who thinks he is about to die but there is hardly any emotion in his voice. Any lesser known actor would have had a better range of emotion in his voice. However emotion played out better in his facial expressions.

As even a very inexperienced sailor, I was aghast at some of the flaws, especially the fact that he never wore a life jacket, even  out in the middle of a horrific storm and didn't at times seemed to be tethered.  He had a foul weather suit yet took off the jacket to go out in the storm. Later on he has on his jacket but not the pants and gets soaked because of inside flooding.  Then, he climbed in the raft but the raft was still tethered to the sinking boat.  Any idiot (not even a sailor) would know that you would have to cut the tie or the raft would sink! There was a life preserver attached to the boat yet he didn't take it aboard the raft and then it inexplicably sank like an anchor when the boat sunk.  Other experienced sailors on this site have noted many more mistakes.

I think the overall movie was interesting though I couldn't help but compare his story with that of Louis Zamparini's in ""Unbroken"".  I would like to see how Angelina Jolie portrays the life boat scenes in the film.  She is directing the film and I think, I hope, she does a better job. Like everyone else, I would have liked just a glimpse of Redford's life.  We see (and hear) the name of the boat, Virginia Jean and we see a wedding ring on his hand.  What is that all about? As someone else said, we would be tied more emotionally to ""Our Man"" if we knew something of what he was experiencing.  However, the main thing, outside of the fact that it lacked a bit of plot, is that it was too long at parts (like during the big storm scene and the myriad underwater shots). It could have been cut by 15 minutes easily.",1410652800,,2049,4.196428571428571
5919445,5,B00EIPEQLW,Incredible story and acting by Robert Redford.  He portrayed incredible calm and ingenuity in solving one crisis after another.

After a collision with a shipping container at sea, a resourceful 70 year old sailor finds himself, despite all efforts to the contrary, staring his mortality in the face.

I admire his remarkable ability to transmit much of what he was supposed to be thinking -- as well as feeling -- without uttering a word, but the absence of dialogue and a couple of unlikely though essential events for the sake of the story moved it from a 4 to an unavailable 3 1/2.  To me this means that it was better than just OK, but not good enough to say without qualification that I liked it.

5919460,5,B00EIPEQLW,"Recommended to me by a friend, I watched this movie with high expectations, which were exceeded by the brilliance of Robert Redford's acting and the beautiful construction, in every way, of the film Itself. The story of a sea captain bearing up under impossible circumstances is not new, but this one is especially fascinating in its immediacy and simplicity. The tension is so well graded that I found myself talking to the screen for the entire second half of the film. Although few words are spoken, Redford's subtle facial expressions convey exactly what he must do next as he calmly assesses each difficulty, no matter how unpleasant or sacrificial. And although this sailor is a pro, he finds himself on a shockingly fast learning curve, creating of his character a kind of folk hero. I found this movie to be powerful, fascinating and haunting.

This role was clearly a struggle for him, both physically and artistically.  His affect was strangely lifeless. He would squint at the sky and fumble with the ropes, but there was no inner dialogue, no heartbeat.  I watched it to the end, hoping somehow it would magically become alive and meaningful, but it never did. The silence of this movie was not the issue.  It was the void at the center of the portrayal that left me feeling alienated and unengaged.  An Oscar would have been one of those given to the career.

5919471,1,B00EIPEQLW,"Unfortunately, 'All Is Lost' more aptly describes Redford's acting skills at this point. The Sting, Butch Cassidy, The Natural...marvelous actor. I was baffled by several of his choices. Maybe it was the directing.

When Redford gets knocked out, how he reacts to hitting the pole and falling is amateurish, comedic folly. His reactions to many incidents just don't ring true. It's as if he [arrogantly] didn't do his homework. (Ex: many sailors have mentioned the appalling lack of research regarding his behavior on his boat).

What pissed me off the most was  (maybe it was listed somewhere, however not prominently enough)  how this story is (almost exactly) the true story of Steve Callahan, who wrote the best-selling book about his ordeal ""Adrift: 76 Days Lost At Sea"" and I couldn't find this mentioned anywhere!",1410566400,7,820,5.097014925373134

Rather, the importance of this film is the slow progression of events (and emotions) conveyed without a single word of dialogue.  It would be so easy to over-play this role, but Redford does not.  He faces cruel fate with equanimity and dignity.  He never loses touch with his humanity.  He is resourceful to the last.  (One can quibble with the ending, but that is a detail.)  I might hope I would act with such grace under this parade of cirumstances.  Would I crack?  That is the tension that kept me watching intently.  Great movie.",1410480000,,644,4.660714285714286

Let's see: His boat might have been fine for some nice lakes & bays but seemed totally inadequate (as were his skills) for an ocean going voyage. I would have had at least ONE other person with me. Kept having to grab for things as his boat is sinking. And about that initial damage...what, he can't use a BILGE pump straight-away?!
He S>L>O>W>L>Y opens a flair bag and acts like he has never seen one before...maybe being a little pro-active so that when a ship DID arrive he could grab it and use it as it is APPROACHING and not as it, by then, is along side. And then he SLEEPS through the NEXT night time ship...(remember that bit I stated earlier about having another person? They could've traded sleep shifts.

5919538,4,B00EIPEQLW,"This is an undoubtedly excellent movie.  Robert Redford has long since proven himself to be a great actor and director.  It is both quite and exciting much like the sea.  It was however better the first time I viewed it.  After a 2nd viewing nitpicking at the illogic of  our main character begins for me at least. Being on a boa by himself in the middle of the ocean made me empathize less with character as things got further out of control. It's not 'Old Man of the Sea' (I couldn't thinking of the book looking at Redford's face)where Hemmingway's character, Santiago, had something to prove on a very human and primal level as he fights against nature.  Santiago down fall was pride, but you respected and empathized with a man fighting the diminishing effects of age ending his physical ability be a fisherman, ending the definition of himself as a viable, relevant individual to his society. But even Santiago, however reluctantly in the beginning, took on a 2nd mate making himself immortal in a way by passing on his knowledge to the young boy.  In this movie, it was just some rich guy or at least a person of some means with way to much time on their hands, throwing himself back into nature because he could and shouldn't have particular because of his age. He starts off having an extremely bad day that could have been prevented by having 2nd experience crewmen on board.

Strong, slightly ambiguous ending: you're not really sure if he makes it all the way to the surface.  Five stars if he had talked to himself a bit more.  We didn't want him yakking to a billiard ball, but surely we'dve gained more insight into his character if he'd had some sort of commentary, however slight, on the endless travails he endured.  And I don't mean voice-overs.  At one point -- at the ""darkest moment"" -- he collapses and unleashes an F-bomb.  I'dve unleashed quite a few more as well as words of self-encouragement.  Oh, as for the purists, unless you're Ted Turner or Erik the Red, the sailing stuff works just fine.

The Redford character is so taciturn, however, that it seemed unrealistic at several points. Also, although most people wouldn't know enough about celestial navigation to catch the problem, it is not possible to plot points on a chart using a sextant during the day time. Taking a sun line at local zenith will only give a sailor a line of latitude--there is no way to know where along that line you are. In order to get a fix, you need to get 2-3 star sightings at sunrise or sunset and apply quite complicated corrections. It is simply not something you could learn to do on the fly.

That is a great film--one that stays with you and leaves an impression.  It has depth and inspired me, though it took a few days after watching it for me to fully appreciate it.

5919586,5,B00EIPEQLW,"This is a movie for anyone who has ever spent  lengthy time in the wild alone and had a serious mishap or two to contend with.  As a solo hiker, a solo sailor, and long distance cross-country skier I could very easily sense the intensity and loneliness of the protagonist's experience.  ""Alone"" is the key word.  If he had had another human to share the disaster it would have changed everything, would have given the viewer an expectation of salvation.  As it was there was every chance that he would fail, that he would die, right up to the end.  The story is terrific because the protagonist is a kind of heightened 'every man.'  OK, most of us don't have fifty-foot yachts.  Most of us don't sail them solo across vast expanses of ocean.  But many, many of us can and do face very tough times alone, sometimes in the wild, sometimes not.  And they're tough because they make us fall back on ourselves, our skills, our beliefs in our own capacities.  And we make mistakes, as the protagonist did at several points in the story, but we keep trying to come up with another idea, a new plan.  What else, after all, have we got?  This is a subtext of Redford's work over years and years; putting a person hard up against a really tough situation and watching how it's resolved, usually in the absence of any outside help.  It is no surprise that the crowds of average movie-goers didn't line up to watch this.  No car chases, no gratuitous rapes, no fist fights, not even any dialog!  What kinda flick is that?  Answer: a very good one.",1410048000,4,1535,4.444444444444445
5919587,5,B00EIPEQLW,"Wow, mine is Review #1,179. That says a lot about this excellent and unusual film, which deserves a lot of recognition and awards and yet was not even nominated.
I just saw this, and I'm still digesting it. But I'm very impressed, and I will want to watch it again.

All the other reviewers have covered the film pretty thoroughly, so I won't rehash that here.

Just some points I have to make:

1. The absence of dialog is not a minus here. Like CAST AWAY, it works--and there are a number of similiarities here to CAST AWAY in that both are a one-man performance.
Unlike CAST AWAY, there is no opening and closing 'backstory' here.
We never know Redford's character's name (in the credits the character is named only 'Our Man""), or why he's out here singlehanded in a 40 foot boat in the Indian Ocean.

2. Yes, for true sailors (and really anyone who's ever had a boat, or been even slightly offshore on a fishing day trip) there's A LOT that's 'wrong' in this script. Lots of experienced sailors have analyzed what Our Man does and doesn't do, and yes the script has him make some crucial mistakes (for the sake of the next step in the plot) that an experienced single-hander in a $zillion dollar deluxe circumnavigating boat probably would not do.

In the last few decades, and especially since GPS, the average ocean yacht has electronics almost as sophisticated as a jet airliner. But the script has Our Man with only a single old fashioned radio and an antiquated style antenna hookup.
He has no GPS, no satellite phone, no EBIRTS... and if you know anything about boats, this is hard to watch because your suspension of disbelief is strained to the breaking point.

In real life today, 'Our Man' would collide with the floating container (that does happen), deploy his pump (not a hand pump), place a call on any one of his several inexpensive backup radios/phones, and help would hopefully be on its way to him even as he's notifying his insurance company to file his repairs claim. A good story to tell once safely back home at his country club, but not a life and death experience.

Knowing all that (and even the non-sailors sense it too), I think it was a mistake not to make this a 'period piece', like WHITE SQUALL, set in the 1970s or earlier, any time before modern GPS and sat phones changed everything.
In 1968, everything would and could have happened to Our Man exactly as it happens in this script (well, mostly).
If I were the director, I'd insert a 'year date' to the opening credits (1968, 1972, 1985, whenever). Problem solved. There, fixed it for you.

I'll insert just one Spoiler here. The ending is intentionally ambiguous and you could arguably interpret it as a final hallucination or dream sequence, but Our Man does not die in the end. The final frame suggests he has been rescued at literally the last moment possible. I'm saying that now because, 15 minutes into his ordeal, I decided to wiki the plot because I honestly did not want to watch some snuff/torture film in which Redford struggles valiantly but dies in the end.
I did the same thing with CAST AWAY and for the same reasons.
So yes, the ending may spark a discussion about interpretations, but I think it's clear that Our Man is rescued in the end and survives. So you can watch his struggles with that in mind.

This is a brave little indie film (unfortunate title did not help it at the box office, I'm sure). Well worth your time.

Hope this is helpful. I welcome your comments. Happy viewing, everybody.",1410048000,,3505,4.56687898089172

5919606,5,B00EIPEQLW,"A lot of people criticized this film because there is only one actor--Robert Redford--and no dialog (well, in reality there are about 30 word of monologue) and I can see why some people would not like a film of that type. But for me, this was a brilliant movie and Redford's acting is simply incredible. The cinematography is superb also. You might think this film will bore you, but if you have any interesting in sailing or survival or your own mortality, I really think you'll enjoy the experience. It's not a feel-good movie, that's for sure, but it will make you think and it will teach you a few things about determination.

That said, I do have some minor criticism of the film. For one, the time frame for the adventure is unclear (we know it's at least eight days, there is a reference to that) and it seems to me that the character's plight goes from bad to hopeless a lot faster than it should. Without triggering any kind of a spoiler alert, there are many tales of ocean survival (with far less gear and time to plan) that go on for months and months. Read Steven Callahan's book ""Adrift"" (I can't link to it with this awful new reviewing panel) as a good example. Callahan survived there months in a life raft and navigated across the Atlantic ocean.

Also, whoever wrote the screenplay for this film was obviously a sailor, but there were a LOT of mistakes make by Redford's character when it came to blue-water survival--a lot of mistakes. For one, I never saw him release or trigger an EPIRB (an electronic location device that is monitored by all commercial airlines and coastal authorities globally); if he had used an EPIRB he would have been rescued. That, of course, would have made for a very short movie, lol, which is why they probably left it out. But better if the had shown the EPIRB failing! Also, he had precious little in the way of survival gear: just a handful of handheld flares (you don't sail blue water without a proper flare gun--and dozens of flares--unless you are suicidal), no global phone, no obvious gps (though the boat appears to have some sophisticated electronics, none was portable), no ready water supply (again, nonsense--you don't go 1,700 miles from land without survival water at the ready) and worst of all--apparently no one knew WHERE he was or WHEN he was due at his next port.

So anyway, some sailing and logistical flaws, but to be honest, they didn't hurt the appreciation of the film for me at all. Robert Redford is a brilliant actor, this role is his masterpiece and even if you don't think you will like this film, I think you will. And if you watch it with your family, it will trigger good discussions about survival and why a person would put their life on the line for their passion.

Sure enough, it only took this landlubber a short time with Google, beginning with ""emergency transponder,"" to learn about EPIRBs and other kinds of distress radio beacons.

This film is a sophisticated treatment of the theme of man vs. nature, and, as in the classic ""To Build A Fire,"" by Jack London, our man has no name, and could be any man.  Redford, however, is such a worthy adversary for the sea and the sky...he is cautious, thoughtful, purposeful, and approaches each challenge nature provides with the sum total expertise which he has clearly gained in a lifetime of seafaring.  At age 77, Redford is an impressive captain whose physicality and intelligence enables him to find his way out of many individual catastrophes which would have brought another captain and his ship down.  As bad luck and circumstance become even worse, Redford continues to keep his head and act quickly and determinedly to save himself and his boat through each crisis.  When he finally becomes so stressed and frustrated that he expresses his emotions verbally, it is with a brief simplicity that is in perfect harmony with his character.  The audience is with ""our man,"" as he is listed in the movie's credits, every step of the way, hoping against hope that he will prevail.

The movie's conclusion can be interpreted two different ways, each of which has the ability to make the viewer feel positively or negatively about the film, depending on personal perspective.  I recommend a quick Internet search after you've watched the film; director J. C. Chandor has a few enlightening comments on viewers' interpretations of the closing.

Whatever the opinions we as viewers may have regarding the unconventional motifs of the film, or the ambiguity of the ending, there is absolutely no doubt that Redford delivers a performance which should leave every Hollywood A-list actor green with envy...and all with no movie wizardry...just pure Redford.  At 77, he is still at the top of his game, and proves that in our techno-addicted day in age, the most fascinating and compelling entertainment is still provided by an actor who can make us ""feel"" a good story as we live it with him/her for a couple of hours.",1407110400,3,2687,4.896247240618101

5919641,4,B00EIPEQLW,"As a sailing enthusiast and a Robert Redford fan, I wanted to see All Is Lost because of Redford and because there really aren't many movies made about sailing.  From my perspective, All Is Lost felt very much like an ""art film"" - the only human you see on screen is Robert Redford, and the dialogue consists of about 10 words in all.  Although Redford's character makes all sorts of ""sailing mistakes,"" he does a credible job of convincing me he actually made to his location at the beginning of the movie.  Although the pace of the movie is somewhat uneven, I had no trouble staying engaged until the last 2 seconds of the movie when the plot is resolved.  I'm not an acting critic, but I thought Redford did an outstanding job with the part.  I don't know that a lesser skilled actor could have pulled it off.

I can't even figure out what the film maker was trying to say in this movie. Why Redford decided to participate in this miserable movie is a mystery.  If there was some lesser know actor in the role, this movie would not have even gotten to DVD.  As is, I would not be surprised if it went straight to DVD.

And it's exceedingly slow.  It's as if the director had to make it last for 100 minutes, even if there was nothing to say.  I would recommend against wasting your time watching this movie but if you decide to see it, set your player on 2x speed and you won't miss anything.

I get the sense that Robert is trying to prove himself bigger than Tom Hanks in this almost seemingly rendition of ""Castaway"".  There is about 10 words spoken in the whole flick and rightfully so I guess if you are doing a solo mission as he is but, I can't help thinking why he wouldn't verbalize his thoughts more in order to bring more to the meaning of the movie (why was he going solo in the first place) and explain the thought process as to why he did what he did in the end!  I myself would not only be talking to GOD out loud but also myself if for nothing other than hearing the human language!

But so many things in this make no sense. Who was this man? Why attempt crossing the Indian Ocean without any help or at least one other sailor/partner? Was he trying to set some kind of record?  Why is he ill prepared? Why does he not have the proper equipment? Why start the movie AFTER the ""Iceberg?"" Why one stupid peril after another?  Do I care if he lives or not?  Why does the ocean look like a swimming pool in many of the later scenes?

I made an impulse buy at Target thinking I could not go wrong with this DVD.  Well, my personal ship just sank and All is Lost, time and money wise at least. I fell asleep not once, but twice during this movie. It's not evil or bad as a movie.  Like I said I really wanted to like it. Let's put it this way...If you like guns, exploding cars, drugs, Transformer movies, Michael Bay as a movie maker...than this IS NOT FOR YOU. However, if you think you are getting an actual really good ""film"" here without all that crap that Michael Bay makes (like for example the worst movie of all time ""Pearl Harbor."") and all the Transformer Shit...look elsewhere.

5919673,4,B00EIPEQLW,"Redford and the filmmaker do a lot right here. Like especially Redford's very calm demeanor throughout ordeal, starting with the very first -- actually, with what should have been the very first -- scene. Redford awakens w a jolt, finds boat taking on water. He calmly surveys the situation, not even a suggestion that this is a time to abandon ship. And I like the scenes that demonstrate he clearly is an expert sailor (though expert sailors have commented here that that's not the case): I like how he works the wheel, knows when to put on what gear, has all the right clothing (not sure where he's plucking it all from on the life raft), like how he uses the ....gurney to fix the boat (though a dicey repair job for sure), and to get to the top of the mast -- to do what, I have no idea.

But some quibbles, the first a big one, back to that first scene: the first scene in the film is totally unnecessary and it has been done SO MANY TIMES BEFORE. We first see the end of the protagonist's story/journey, the desperate endgame, his dire situation, followed by the oh-so-usual graphic: 'Eight Days Earlier.' There is absolutely no need for that. The film should have started with Redford waking after hitting the container.

Second quibble: I get that the director wanted as little dialogue/talking as possible, but really: a guy on his own at sea? Facing one disaster after another? Wouldn't he be talking to himself a lot more?

And three: SPOLIER: the boat that rescues him at the end... what is that? A 12-foot fishing boat? In the middle of the Indian Ocean? If you're going to have that, then the very final shot should have been a rising pan of the sea, only to see lights on the shore a mile away.

Here are just some of the most blatant violations of sound seamanship: This boat has no Epirbs? He is using a VHF with 40 M range in the Indian Ocean??, Not a SSB? He is sailing in a calm for days, no cruising spinnaker? He pulls out the storm jib in the middle of a storm, but saw it coming? Where is he hoisting this? Is his harness on a jackline? Why so much slack that he goes overboard? Putting a sea anchor on a container is nonsense, the container has more resistance than any sea anchor. Why not patching that hole from the inside immediately, using mattresses, plywood. I always have extra plywood. Stowing bottles and stuff away when it gets rough? On a boat everything is always stowed safely. Why rolling over? He could use his sea anchor and sailing downwind under bare poles, or heave to with the sea anchor on the bow, that would have prevented rolling over.

For example, the scene in which he struck his head on the corner below in his cabin is helarious. My daughter and I played it over 3 times before advancing further into the movie...Redford s face is priceless and completely staged....

Another scene which turned into humor was his staged and funny jump into his life boat. He looked like he was jumping onto a mattress and not into a raft. I could go on but I start laughing all over again and it's difficult to type with tears in your eyes...

5919687,2,B00EIPEQLW,"I give the filmmakers credit for not feeling that they were required to provide any kind of backstory. We never learn why the main character (credited as ""Our Man"" - we never learn his name) is at sea in the first place. The film should have opened with his discovery that a shipping container had pierced his hull, and not the apology to unknown and unseen people (his family? Co-workers? His pets?), with its implication that he was about to ""give up."" With the relentless battle of Man Against the Sea, the outcome was far from certain at any point in the film. The character comes across as a seasoned sailor, almost unemotional in the face of what most people would consider to be terrifying and devastating events. His only strong reaction is to the discovery that his water container has been contaminated, and he gets past that obstacle fairly quickly.

Almost experimental in its sparseness, the film relies on our interest in what the main character is doing at any given moment and how he will deal with the periodic disasters he is subjected to. What was missing was some sense of transcendence. I'm not sure how that could have been achieved; maybe through flashbacks to events in his life, or even the surrealism of visions, sea monsters, or some suggestion of how a shipwrecked person passes the time by themselves. The film did a fine job presenting the danger and excitement of a shipwreck; what it utterly failed to communicate was the unbearable tedium of the endless hours when nothing is happening, when the character must have been alone with his thoughts and nothing else. In the end, the real adversary is not the sea - it is his own mind. You would never get that from ""All Is Lost.""

I have no explanation for the critical acclaim (despite the Academy's failure to nominate this film for any award) other than a reaction to Redford's admittedly understated yet intense performance, and the decidedly ""un-Hollywood"" minimalist presentation. However, I cannot recommend it for anyone other than diehard Redford completists, or those who have committed to seeing every film ever made.

William Cowper in ""The Castaway"" painted a more vivid and meaningful picture of this topic.

No light propitious shone;
When, snatched from all effectual aid,
We perished, each alone:

5919704,1,B00EIPEQLW,"I felt like I was watching a National Geographic special on what to do when your sailboat starts sinking, except without narration.

Inb my opinion, All Is Lost needs a backstory.  Its hard to root for a character completely without knowing why that person is out sailing alone in the middle of the ocean to begin with, what specifically he has to live for (wife, kids, grandkids?) The director claims in the making of special that Redford is an everyman character, so its not important to know his name or why he is in an sailboat.  We are just supposed to identify with him; I find this hard to do as his situation is one in which I would never find myself.  The director also  makes the comment, There is hardly any dialogue.  Actually, there is NO dialogue whatsoever, since dialogue means an exchange of conversation between at least two people.

In this film Robert Redford faces the loss of his main sail with the same stoic expression as he does when he eats beans from a can for the first time.  Youve got to  love existentialism. I kept hoping his character might have spoken to those beans.  I mean, even Tom Hanks had Wilson in Castaway.  At least in the life raft, Redfords character finally shows some emotion and speaks eight or nine words.  Unfortunately, this show of frustration comes 70 minutes into the film.

I have to admit that I know practically zip about sailboats.  However, if I saw my boat was sinking, and water was rushing into the cabin, would I try to save the radio, battery and navigation equipment first, since it would take time to repair the leak?  I think I would get all the electronics up on the deck right away since it was still dry.

What is really lost in this movie is approx. 100 minutes of time on the part of the viewer.",1402444800,2,1768,4.461059190031152
5919705,4,B00EIPEQLW,"All is Lost is a compelling action adventure that also wears its allegorical meaning on its sleeve.  It begins with the main characters confession, which leaves little doubt where the movie is headed.  The essence of the confession is that he wishes he had lived a better life and was sorry for everyone he let down.  Aren't we all.  Red fords ensuing lonely battle against the forces of nature can lead only to one ultimate result, again the same being for all of us.  The only real choice we have is what meaning we choose to place on our own brief lives, and death.  The film does a brilliant job of posing that choice and leaving it to the viewer.  None of which is meant to dug suggest that the film does not also succeed on its overt terms as a gripping, brilliantly acted disaster survival movie.  In the virtual total absence of dialogue, everything Redford conveys is offered physically and viscerally.  The cinematography, particularly the underwater scenes, is wonderful.  Highly recommended.",1402444800,,1003,4.77906976744186

If one is in this overwhelmingly unfortunate position that he was in, an actor might attempt some sense of emotion.

Redford did an admirable job esp. since he is the only person in the movie.  He was amazing and sucks you in on his confidence and later his frustration and fear.  He should receive recognition and awards for his performance during this later portion of his career.  I rented the movie on Netflix first and then wanted my own copy.  Therefore I ordered one on Amazon and I plan to watch it several more times.  It was more cost effective to do this.

5919717,4,B00EIPEQLW,"There are so many movies available to watch these days and most of them are a waste of time.  This movie was above average.  I was skeptical that this wouldn't be boring but it was less boring than watching DIY episodes  probably because Robert Redford looks like he is suffering and seems like a nice person so you feel bad for him.

He doesn't deserve this and basically he is taking care of the saving of himself all by himself so I think that is the point similar to Gran Torino.

It's pretty relaxing otherwise in that the filmmakers are very assured and the editing is very good.  Obviously, because it's Robert Redford, nothing too jarring or raucous will be happening in this film.  Everything flows.

There are two weird incidents with boats ignoring his flares.  One is a huge container ship as if too successful to be bothered with saving someone and the other seems similar to the real life Sage Sagittarius so maybe it's for the best, that his flares were ignored.

How could they NOT see his flares?",1402185600,,1013,4.54696132596685

5919720,4,B00EIPEQLW,"All is Lost (2013). Rated PG-13. Running Time: One Hour, 46 mins.
Directed and written J.C. Chandor.

This story is about a 76 year old man who wakes up to find water entering his cabin. An Asian shipping container has crashed into his sailboat. A good size hole it has made. He tries to save his sailboat and himself. Now part of his sailboat is not functioning properly. His cellphone is not working. His communications radio malfunctions and then becomes useless. The man is all by himself as he goes through the tribulations of the deep ocean.
  This movie only has one actor in it: Robert Redford.
Either you will get into this story or it will have the effects on you to become sleepy.  Their is some suspense here and it has its moments, but if are having trouble sleeping, perhaps the sounds of the rain and sailing in the sea should relax you.

If Robert Redford had not starred in this movie, I probably would not have watched it.

Why was this movie rated ""PG-13""? It could have been rated ""G"" if Robert Redford had not said the ""f"" word.

Filmed in Santa Catalina Islands, Port of Los Angeles, San Pedro, California.
Rosarito, Ensenada, Baja California Norte, Mexico.
Nassau, Lyford Cay, New Providence Island, Bahamas.

Although short, I wanted this scene to end quickly (which it did) since it was intense and obviously dangerous..  The relative absence of talking afforded the viewer the need/opportunity to pay attention and determine the meaning of each scene.

5919760,2,B00EIPEQLW,"As a sailor, give me a movie with some ocean action and I am happy.  Include some scenes of a sailboat underway, and I can ask for nothing more.  Throw in Robert Redford, and all is perfect.

Except in the hands of this director, writer, and producer whose colossal ignorance of sailing ruined what should have been a great story.

This movie was excruciating to watch.  So very many simple details were so wrong.  Our Man was so lacking in the most basic understanding of how safely to sail a boat that he was lucky to have made it out of the harbor still afloat, and certainly would not have survived an ocean crossing.  Plainly money was spent on the computer graphics and special effects that should have been spent on a technical advisor who had actually set foot on a sailboat.

Robert Redford never looked comfortable aboard the boat.  It was impossible to believe that this was a character who had prepared for the voyage, and he plainly had no business at sea.  Within the first 30 minutes I found myself hoping that he would meet his inevitable end quickly so as to put me out of my pain.  The only legitimate purpose for this movie would be as a training aid in an offshore sailing class, to illustrate how not to do it, and to stimulate a discussion of why fools who go to sea will surely die.

There was a time in Hollywood when movies were about the story and the skills of the actors and directors, and ""All Is Lost"" harkens back to that time.  I'm not suggesting that this is anything approaching a perfect movie.  It isn't.  There are some things in the movie that are pretty hard to believe (e.g., Redford uses some fiberglass and glue to patch a sizable hole in the side of his boat that somehow holds together through two incredibly powerful storms, and actual sailors will find technical faults with many aspects of the film).  That said, though, it took some major stones for Robert Redford to take on this role in a movie that features him as the ONLY actor.

There is, of course, virtually no dialogue and the movie at times is, to say the least, uncomfortable to watch because of the dire circumstances Redford finds himself in from the opening scene.  What this film is, though, is a testament to the survival instinct of human beings and to the dogged determination of one man to save his own life.  If you're into action films, you should probably take a pass on this one and purchase Fast & Furious 128 or Die Hard 17.",1399161600,,1383,4.526104417670683

5919796,1,B00EIPEQLW,"For anyone who ever starts on a blue water voyage . . . a modicum of experience should be expected.

Hmmm, Eric Hiscock sailed around the world SIX times,  Wrote about his voyages.  Documented his difficulties.  At least Hiscock knew how to properly communicate an emergency on the radio (Redford - and this film crew - even blew that simple part of the voyage).  Not only did Redford keep his mike ""keyed"" while supposedly listening for answers to his transmissions, he ""forgot"" the most basic instruction of emergency communications on a radio, uh, ""Mayday, Mayday, Mayday"".  FYI, any radiotelephone operator is taught this basic part of radio communications.  Like ""SOS"" it is universally understood.

Unbelievable.

After getting the hull ruptured by the shipping container (a real risk in blue water sailing) what does our ""Bobbie boy"" do?  He starts sorting through the electrical equipment.  Yep.  Got his priorities right.  You would think with a cabin full of water the priority would be only, and I repeat only, getting the water out of the bilge.

Eventually, ""Bobbie boy"" Redford takes his well prepared ocean going sailboat (tongue in cheek on that last remark) and has to whittle a stick just to operate a totally inadequate manual bilge pump.  Didn't ""Bobbie boy"" do a little research on manual bilge pumps that pump more water/faster?  Before he headed out on a bluewater voyage?  I guess not.  Sheesh.

Then, instead of preparing his boat for the impending storm, what does our ""Bobbie boy"" do?  Lower his sails?  Nope.  Put out his sea anchor?  Nope.  Put up his storm trysail?  Nope.  Put on his foul weather gear?  Nope.  Put on his sailing harness and clip off every time he goes topside?  Nope again.

He shaves.

Real bluewater sailing skills demonstrated here.

Lastly, despite all the boat ""issues"" Bobbie boy runs into, it appears he forgot to purchase an EPIRB before setting out on his voyage.  For you non-sailor types, this would be equivalent to not having a spare tire in your car and setting out on a cross country trip.  No, it's actually a LOT worse.  Look up what the functions of an EPIRB do.

5919798,4,B00EIPEQLW,"I happened to see this film on the same day as THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL.  The downbeat, ultra-realistic adventure of ALL IS LOST compared to the wedding cake confection of Wes Anderson's fairy tale was quite a contrast.  Even fairy tales and fantasies can have profound meaning, but Anderson's films just aren't about anything at all--HOTEL seem pointless and forgettable compared to this gripping tale of man against the elements that had a great deal more to say about what life and human character are all about.

ALL IS LOST could be viewed as a poetic myth of a man's fall and redemption.  It begins its descent with his complacency (he's asleep comfortably in his boat when a dire accident occurs).  His composure slowly disintegrates as he realizes he's trapped, his strength and skills may not be adequate for him to save himself as he is taken down inexorably into a sort of watery hell.  The final shot is unforgettable, and has existential force.  At the moment he is completely broken down and surrenders all, he gains all.

It's perhaps the most brilliant and economical resolution of a story since the final shot of NORTH BY NORTHWEST.

Gutsy film, nicely done, not easy to forget.  Packs more of a wallop in terms of life lessons than the last survival at sea saga I saw, the pretentious LIFE OF PI.  Yes, I'm sure sailors can't resist critiquing the Redford character's actions and strategies for rescue.  As a sailor of very limited experience, the only point where I had trouble suspending disbelief was when he was fumbling with his flares.  It's hard to imagine that any seasoned sailor who knew he was drifting into a shipping lane wouldn't prepare by having his flares all ready to go  He would know exactly how many he has and how they operate beforehand.

Redford doesn't seem to be acting at all, as other reviewers have said, but it is precisely his skillful restraint that is his accomplishment here.  We forget that this is our renowned, handsome Hollywood icon Robert Redford in peril (Oh no, not our hero!).  We just follow the struggles of an ordinary guy to survive, unsure of what the outcome will be.  It would have been so easy for Redford to overact, to mug, to fall back on his famous mannerisms, to trade on well-worn tricks.  Redford never succumbs to that temptation for an instant.  It's quite an achievement in a very quiet, understated way.",1399075200,2,2383,4.723970944309928

But i was deeply disappointed by so unrealistic it was. I'm not a sailor, but there was plenty of things i would have done to survive (I would done little things like what Les Stroud's Survivorman did.)

-I would have been talking to myself alot. Him not really talking was really annoying.
-I WOULD not have shaved before a storm.
-I would have worn a lifejacket before going out in a storm.
-I would not go out to sea unless i knew what i was doing.
-And another thing is i would have used a mirror on the cargo ship.

Also i might add that not having alot of emergency equipment is also stupid and boneheaded. I was actullay relieved by the ending (Even though it was a hollywood ending.) Because i would have been ticked if they didn't offer a good resolution.

A lot of other customers say that this movie is offensive to sailors and sailing (Even though i'm not one.) I agree with the. Robert Redford is an interesting actor, but this was a real bummer and disappointment. (HECK: He was better in Captain America than in this.

He was brilliant in JEREMIAH JOHNSON, and I was hoping for a similar performance from him in ALL IS LOST. The thing I really lost with this movie was the money I shelled out for the DVD. Buyer beware!

Okay.......I like the way the film starts and what Our Man initially does to avert danger/catastrophe at sea. He's calm and level headed and doesn't panic in the face of adversity. I admire that and it makes for great character development. However, as Our Man's conflicts and problems mount, EVERY action and reaction he displays seems to be one of strategic, emotionless calm. We hear no inner thoughts, no ""talking out loud,"" and not one cuss word. Either this guy is the coolest cucumber on the high seas, or he has a stash of wonder drugs that are never revealed on camera. COME ON Mr. Director.....make us CARE more about Our Man!!! Who can relate to this guy?! He goes through his motions like some sailing zombie, until in one scene in the life raft, having discovered that his water tank has been infiltrated with sea water, he finally leans back and screams F*****!!!!! Where the heck was that fervor during the majority of the film???

In the end, it's hard to care a great deal about Our Man because he hardly lets you know he's a human being fighting for his very survival. I would much rather watch Tom Hanks again in CASTAWAY or revisit JEREMIAH JOHNSON. While I admire the physical stamina Redford obviously had to bring to this role, I cannot say that there's much heart and soul to go with it.....",1398643200,5,1624,4.615916955017301

5919812,5,B00EIPEQLW,"I liked the movie when I saw it, but I like it even more now that I read that from many sailors' viewpoints Our Man is a terrifically stupid sailor. That just confirms what I suspected, this movie is allegory.

Character doesn't have a name? Don't know how character came to be in his current predicament? Character speaks only a few syllables and there is no voice-over?  Character engages in behavior which is incongruent with that of a veteran sailor? Difficult to judge how much time passes throughout the movie? All of this is proof that All Is Lost is pure allegory.

As allegory, it is up to the viewer to discover the import of the story. It could be one thing or many things. It could be a universal truth or a personal revelation. The settings, props and images could be literal or suggestive. The filmmakers aren't going to come out and tell you. And I'm going to keep my personal interpretation of this fine film out of this review.

To the many reviewers who say it's stupid, I sympathize that you don't like to think for your entertainment. To the many reviewers who say Our Man is an awful sailor, I would suggest he's not a sailor at all. To those who took umbrage at the lack of dialogue, I'd recommend you try to spend more time with your own thoughts. To those who wailed it was two hours of your life you'll never get back, I'm afraid to say that you are, and will continue to be, missing out on a lot more than that.",1398556800,,1437,4.350746268656716
5919813,3,B00EIPEQLW,"The sailing and the choices of the skipper are unimaginable to a real sailor. The story is plausible, as far as it goes, but it is never developed. The lack of character development is a flaw. The photography is good, but not really cutting edge.
All in all a disappointment.",1398470400,,275,4.52
5919814,5,B00EIPEQLW,"To all the (238 or so as of this date) reviewers who are giving this movie 1 star for being inaccurate in its sailing/boating/navigation elements, I think you are missing the point of the movie.  Plus your gleeful snark at Robert Redford, for some reason, only serves to make YOU sound petty.

Maybe it is obvious to say but I'll say it anyway:  this movie was far less about sailing and survival than it was about life, mortality, aging, obstacles, hope, failings, effort, persistence but ultimately the inevitability of death and the reality that we face that absolutely alone.  The ending can be seen as ambiguous - the light, the hand (reminiscent of the hand of God touching Adam's hand in the famous painting on the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel), but my interpretation is not ambiguous (I won't be specific for those who haven't seen the movie.)  It is about the nobility and courage it takes to live, to get old, the futility of striving and yet the magnificence of it.  It may be about the dangers and yet the meaninglessness of man's artifacts (the cargo container, the huge cargo ships), man's place in Nature - and here's the old clich again, but always true and always important: how very tiny and insignificant we are, whether a tiny ""island"" of our own life raft floating on the huge sea on the huge planet in the huge universe - and how ""Nature will out"" ultimately.  It is about the spirit and soul of man and the attachment to life and living.  Someone mocked the man's shaving his face in the midst of tremendous danger and trauma - but it seemed to me to be his belief in dignity and the patterns of daily life - or it could be, again, the meaninglessness of those very same facets of life. Either way, a strange and pointed reminder of his - man-hood.

I thought this film was extraordinary for its deep story with virtually no speaking - just man, Nature, and challenges, one after another. Hard, relentless, tougher and tougher, less and less hope of meeting challenges using man's clever intelligence and ingenuity (as the man had been doing); in the end, it is inadequate and futile.  All is Lost.  Is this about our planet, the environment, each person's life, the profound basics of being a human being?  Yes.

As to Robert Redford's performance:  it was amazing.  To think that he is going on 80, I think, and to see him in this physically demanding role (even if there were stuntmen for some of the activities) was astonishing. The fact that he is aging gives weight to the story he is telling about the man.  His marvelous face that has been so gorgeous on the screen for so many years is only moreso now, but in a different way; his wrinkles and age spots tell their own story about life and age and what we all face.  So much more beautiful than the plumped up, smoothed out, artificial and strange looking faces we see in those who are only fooling themselves - and why do they need to try to fool anybody at all? His face is the map of his life, as are the maps he holds trying to find a way to stay alive.  ""I'm sorry, "" his character's voice says at the beginning of the movie, and we learn later, he is probably writing in a note.  What is he sorry for? He is only human - and that's the story right there - but ""only human"" is extraordinary, to a point.  All the human tools (sextant, flares, boats, motors) are ultimately worthless when facing death and even the amazing display of human intelligence and inventiveness is ultimately worthless as well.  One thinks of the old Breton prayer: ""Oh God, thy sea is so big and my ship is so small.""  (Bronze plaque on wedge shaped wood block with raised lettering that reads 'Oh God thy sea is so great and my boat is so small'.  This Old Breton prayer was given to new submarine captains by Admiral Hyman Rickover who gave this plaque to the President. President Kennedy favored this quote and used in his remarks at the dedication of the East Coast Memorial to the Missing at Sea, May 23, 1963.  He kept the plaque on his desk in the Oval Office.)

I would love to think that Robert Redford would read this because it hurts me to see all the negative and nasty comments from people who, in my opinion, show little understanding of what appears to me to be a very profound visual tale of The Most Important Things!  I would like him to know that some of us are amazed by this tale and his performance.  I have always loved his movie of long ago, ""Jeremiah Johnson"", a marvelous story of survival, life, death, nature, solitude. ""All Is Lost"" may be a sort of ""Jeremiah Johnson"" on the sea at the end of his life.

One last thing: it is also very gratifying to see a story told with human beings, not cartoon or computer characters and not a story based on comic books and not a story that is pornography with a fatuous nod to any kind of story and not a slim story as excuse for relentless violence, blowing things up, vile and insane killing.

5919827,2,B00EIPEQLW,"There are so many things wrong with All is Lost that it's hard to know where to start. How about the very beginning of this messed up movie about a solo sailor who runs into trouble on the high seas? We hear the voice of a man who is about to die, a man apologising for having made mistakes and disappointed people. We realise in hindsight this is the text of a message the unnamed sailor writes as he is about to perish after a series of calamities at sea. But we don't know who is he talking to in the message - family/friends/lovers/business partners perhaps? - and we also have no idea why this 77-year-old is out in the Indian Ocean in the first place. So right from the first few frames we don't really care about the sailor because we don't know who he is or why he is doing what he's doing. Redford's performance is about as creaky as his yacht, which springs a leak after it hits an abandoned shipping container. We see lots of shots of the sails on board the boat, so many so that it smacks of padding. We see lots of shots of Redford leaving the cabin to deal with various calamities outside and lots of shots of him returning. It all comes across as lazy. Redford's damaged yacht runs into a big storm and a series of disasters follow. Some of the cinematography is good but it can't help overcome the biggest flaw of the movie, which is that we don't care a fig about the only protagonist.

5919829,4,B00EIPEQLW,"In an era where big budgets, big stars, big effects and clever/snarky dialogue get all the attention, this film is a modern retelling of The Old Man and the Sea.  In this story however, instead of 'man vs. fish' it's 'man vs. the ocean'. With no spoken dialogue, the movie is all about how Redford's character, an apparently experienced sailor, fights through a series of challenges far out at sea on his own 40' yacht.  There is no ""Big Hollywood"" to this film, no shark attacks, chase scenes, over-the-top crashes or other hokey gimmicks.  The entire movie rests on Redford's immense acting experience and special effects that are so good, you don't even see them.

The plot points that will make sailors cringe are mainly to do with things like Redford not having an EPIRB, a handheld VHF radio and GPS in his ditch-bag, along with perhaps a hand-operated desalinator.

Anyone who knows anything about safety at sea wouldn't even be able to use the film as a ""how not to do it"" so much is left out or not there.

5919863,3,B00EIPEQLW,"All Is Lost tells the story of a 77-year old cargo-ship pirate. He cleverly uses a yacht because who would ever suspect a yacht of being a pirate ship?
The irony in this is that instead of capturing a cargo ship he hits a cargo container that punctures the side of his boat. After freeing himself from the cargo container, he is then so mad at it that he rams it head-on and then--in an effort to make lemonade out of lemons--he takes a look at the cargo which just turns out to be every woman's dream and every married man's worst nightmare: SHOES!

Left speechless by this series of unfortunate events, he proceeds to repair his ship with carbon fiber, maple syrup and duct tape. Unfortunately these repairs come a bit late because the fact of the matter is that his ship is already partly flooded with sea-water. He quite literally has a water-bed.
After fixing his water-soaked electronic equipment, he radios an SOS in English . . . to some people who don't speak English.
Next, he pulls himself up the mast to get a better look at what he could have seen with so much less effort on the deck--a terrible storm. (Okay, to be fair, he did have to go up the mast to reconnect those audio cables).

In preparation for the big storm he shaves his already clean-shaven face and does the dishes.
When the storm hits, his boat is flipped over to allow him a better view of the underwater creatures and then conveniently flips back over when he is done looking. His carbon fiber and maple syrup repair works so well that even MacGyver would be envious.

Then he finds a tiger on his . . . no, wait, wrong movie . . .

He weathers this storm only to be hit by another. This time the storm just further shows that his yacht is really more of a kayak by how conveniently and easily it does barrel rolls.
In preparation to abandon ship, he deploys his liferaft and attaches it to his yacht so that if the yacht sinks, so does the liferaft.

On board the raft he takes stock of his supplies--a knife that is probably the cause of a future leak, a 5 gallon jug of Pinesol that he used to mop the inside of his yacht with earlier, a sextant to show him how miserably lost he is, a bag of condoms and a ping pong paddle with dental floss (I know dental floss worked wonders for Austin Powers but I'm not so sure about this situation).

While looking at a map he realizes that his raft is coming closer to the cargo shipping lanes! Yes! Unfortunately this movie takes place after the events in Captain Phillips so the cargo ships know full well that he is just a crafty pirate and pass him by not once but twice.

Things are looking bad for him. Refusing to go to Bear Grylls extremes he tries to drink the Pinesol but predictably has to spit it out. Also his face is melting off because he has a perfectly good hat that he refuses to wear. Because the hot noon-day sun is not hot enough for him he also puts on a sweater over the sweater he is already wearing.

Finally one night there is hope--A light from a small boat in the middle of the Indian Ocean. One can only assume two things: 1) They are either cargo ship pirates like himself or 2) They are just as lost as he is--and probably cannibals.
In a moment of great mental clarity he sets fire to his jug of Pinesol and gets so carried away that he burns down his raft. The cannibals/pirates finally spot him and the movie ends.

Viewed in this light, the movie is clearly 4 or even 5 star material, but taken seriously I can only give it 3.",1397174400,2,3486,4.2617246596066565

Great foundation for empathy.
There is no text prologue offered. There is no preliminary action, except for a cryptic voiceover followed by the caption 8 DAYS EARLIER. Then he wakes up with an abandoned container peeking in through a hole in the starboard side and a foot of water in the cabin. Redford's character being who he is, the situation can but go downhill from here - and it does. By fits and starts withal, but it does go downhill - and Mysterious Bob gives no clue.
Do you talk to yourself? When it's cold as fury and someone slips into the parking space you've been waiting for, do you let something slip? I do.
When you get a paper cut, do you announce your displeasure with God's mismanagement of the world? You betcha.
When that last step reaches up and grabs your foot, putting you on your knees on the landing - how about then?
Not Mysterious Bob. His involuntary interjections tell us nothing about his social class, his education, his occupation - nothing. What planet is he from? Mum's the word.
By the time M.B. deploys his life raft, I'm having a hard time staying awake - nothing he does, nothing that happens to him MATTERS to me - I don't know him! He does NOTHING to inspire sympathy in me. All I know is that an elderly fathead has gone to sea in an inadequate vessel with inadequate equipment - Say! I know - he's committing suicide in a particularly expensive and embarrassing fashion!
And I don't care. I don't even particularly regret throwing away a few bucks.
Later: I see AIL made a couple million and garnered 87% good reviews.

5919878,5,B00EIPEQLW,"The ""F"" bomb, that is. Redford's character in this movie, who is suffering from overwhelming disappointment and guilt from his past, is lost at sea (in his life, and, literally, at sea, in the Indian Ocean). First his boat goes, then his life raft begins to take on water. And that's when it happens. Redford lets out an ""F"" bomb that is so intense and commanding it seems possible that it could be heard throughout the entire Indian Ocean. Redford, in this moment, makes the King of ""F"" Bombs, Al Pacino, seem timid.

I find it very difficult to believe that anyone could not strongly identify with Redford's character. Certainly almost everyone has been in this situation. Inner turmoil combined with an overwhelming external attack coming from someone or something resulting in...an explosion. I know this for sure: I've been in that life raft, I've definitely been in that raft.

______________________________________________________________________________

I loved this movie. I was one of the very few that saw this in the movie theatre. I've told folks to skip it on dvd. They missed this boat, so to speak, by not seeing it on the large screen. Don't waste your time watching it on the small screen, I've told them.

But maybe I'm wrong. I'll probably eventually see it on dvd. But until then...

The five stars goes to the film I saw in the theatre. See it on the small screen at your own risk. The Indian Ocean is a major character in this film. On the small screen it may seem shrunk to relative insignificance.

Postscript - 6/6/14:

Last night I finally got around to watching All is Lost on DVD. It was perfectly 100 percent fine. I was trying to figure out why the film worked on the small screen when I had been convinced that it wouldn't. As it turns out, the film consists mostly of medium-close and close-up shots, which gives the viewer a feeling of confinement. And what a perfect way to convey Redford's predicament in the film. He was confined to hell in both the ocean and in his personal life. At any rate, the feeling of confinement that I felt while watching the film in the movie theatre transferred perfectly to the small screen. DVD rating: 5 stars.",1396828800,2,2262,4.903141361256544
5919879,3,B00EIPEQLW,"Hooray for Redford for doing his own ""stunts"".  He did a terrific job in a movie that seemed somewhat tedious.",1396828800,,110,4.5
5919880,1,B00EIPEQLW,"this was one of the worst movies i have ever seen.  I expected alot more from a movie with Robert Redford.  The plot never comes together, one cant tell if Robert is supposed to be a drunk or just one of the most stupid sailors in the world.",1396828800,,241,4.0
5919881,4,B00EIPEQLW,"I wasn't that impressed with Redford's acting, or with the accuracy of the portrayal of life at sea (having spent a bit of time sailing in the open ocean), but the narrative that life will through challenges your way, and that you will need to take the tools at your disposal and respond, contains some real wisdom.",1396828800,,315,4.543859649122807
5919882,1,B00EIPEQLW,Garbage- worst Redford movie ever. Not that any of his are good. Just watch castaway instead.  Or anything else at all.,1396828800,,119,4.666666666666667
5919883,5,B00EIPEQLW,I chose this movie because I am a big fan of Robert Redford.  I saw it at the theatre and it blew me away.  He should have been nominated for an Oscar.  It held me spellbound and on the edge of my seat throughout the entire movie and then a huge gasp at the ending.  Fabulous movie!  I highly recommend it.,1396742400,,306,3.9508196721311477
5919884,3,B00EIPEQLW,"To me, Robert Redford's ALL IS LOST (2013; 106 mins.) was very intense, gripping, and highly enjoyable up until its final two minutes.

The plot of ALL IS LOST is almost identical to that of the contemporaneous movie GRAVITY (2013; George Clooney and Sandra Bullock), in which two people are the sole survivors when space debris destroys their space shuttle. GRAVITY is quite a bit more engaging because, unlike with Redford's unnamed and taciturn character, we get to know some of the back-story of Sandra Bullock's character and do get to learn her feelings and thoughts almost non-stop ... and GRAVITY's amazingly similar concluding scene is at least 25 times more plausible than the concluding scene in ALL IS LOST.

Redford, however, does an excellent job playing a resourceful elderly sailor suffering a large array of misfortunes during a solo voyage across (apparently) the Indian Ocean. The film begins with him voicing one of just three short speeches: he is sure that ""all is lost"" and is speaking aloud while writing a short farewell note he puts into a bottle. Then the film flashes back eight days to the first major problem he had: a substantial hole has been punched in the side of his fiberglass sailboat by a large floating metal cargo container that has fallen off some ship.

At this point many viewers will realize that there are only three possible endings this film can have: Redford's character will die, or Redford's character will suffer terrible permanent damage but will survive, or Redford's character will survive with no serious damage.

Faced with this first problem, Redford is silent. We hear only splashing, flowing, and scraping sounds, as Redford calmly sets about freeing his craft from the container, patching the hole, pumping out water, and drying his soaked possessions, which include his radio and his navigation equipment. As the container floats away, there is an ironic, almost humorous moment as hundreds of little sneakers spill out of it into the sea. What else could possibly go wrong?

Would you believe his radio works, one-way as a receiver, but for only a few seconds? (""Mayday!"" is another of the speeches Redford delivers, but only we, the viewers of the film, hear his words.) Well, that's pretty bad, but what else could go wrong? Would you believe a typhoon? Would you believe TWO typhoons??

The third speech in the film is Redford's one-word expletive beginning with the letter F, following a head injury he receives. Otherwise all our information comes from what we are allowed to see and the non-human sounds we hear. We get no back-story about this man, no explanation for why he is sailing alone or what sort of family he has, not even what his name is. And to me, thin though this is, that is just fine. We don't REALLY need to know these things.

Later, when Redford is in his inflated lifeboat, we are treated to several excellent views looking upwards from about 70 feet below the surface of the ocean. Small schools of fish circle beneath his lifeboat, occasionally joined by a dozen or more sharks.

And up on the surface, large ships pass by without noticing him, despite all his efforts--which is fully believable in these days of automated vessels with very tiny crews.

The tension increases as shortages of food and water become greater and greater problems--until, in the darkness, a bright light appears, and Redford's stressed out, depleted, desperate character responds in a way that seems terribly illogical and THEN ... well, see for yourselves. Up to its final two minutes, I felt this movie was almost equal to THE PERFECT STORM and was far superior to several other ""small craft at sea"" films I'd seen, such as CASTAWAY (with Tom Hanks) and LIFE OF PI (with a young boy and his CGI tiger).

I watched this film in a small movie theater and, terribly disappointed with the highly implausible final twist, walked out muttering under my breath.

NOTE: To increase their profits, movie makers often film two or more alternative endings which they play for several ""test audiences"" to get an idea which ending the majority of paying viewers will prefer. I was in one such audience about 20 years ago and filled out a questionnaire at the end. I don't know whether ALL IS LOST was made with alternative endings, but if it was, the wrong ending was chosen.",1396742400,,4334,4.8432432432432435

Our hero had no backup equipment,  he had no idea how to patch a hole in the boat.  He did not have the basic equipment to go with a life raft.  He had no idea what to do in a storm.  He attached a sea anchor to the stern rail.  That would have instantly ripped off the stern rail  When he thought the boat was sinking he climbed into the life raft and went to sleep with it attached to the boat.

5919919,3,B00EIPEQLW,"All Is Lost is about Our Man played by Robert Redford trying to survive on the open sea after his sailboat is severely damaged in the middle of the Indian Ocean. The film features only Robert Redford. There is no dialogue.

I admire the courage of writer/director J.C. Chandor (Margin Call) tackling this experimental challenge. I also respect Robert Redford for pulling off such a great performance.

Having said that, I must say I wasn't impressed. Like Liam Neesons The Grey (2012), All Is Lost attempts to be an existential allegory about a man facing his own death. The attempt is worthy of our serious attention, and most critics seem to view this idea favorably (93 percent of positive reviews at Rottentomatoes), but quite frankly, watching for about 105 minutes Robert Redfords character, about whom we know very little of, is something too demanding.

Some reviewers point out Redfords character, who should be a seasoned sailor, is incredibly incompetent and his boat too ill-equipped. My complaint is something different. I was pretty much bored throughout the film once I realized what the film was trying to accomplish. To its credit, it does what it sets out to do, but I really don't see the point of doing that.",1396310400,,1228,4.894230769230769

Most normal human being in such situations would be swearing, crying, having a cow, talking to themselves, but Robert Redford either didn't have a writer for this film or decided to go on the cheap and do away with a script.

Or, even a paperback primer?

The plot is uber predictable and plodding. A shipwrecked sailor encounters storms, sharks, etc. No kidding? No clich goes unturned.

The acting is absurdly wooden. Even the most dramatic turn of events that would skyrocket your pulse and send you into frantic action leaves Redford in an extended zombie-like stare. Repeatedly. When things are going to Hades in a handbasket, do you just gape or swear vehemently and throw up your hands? When he eventually snaps out of it, count on him to do something inane.

Cinematography? Whats that? Here you have the open seas, an infinite canvas on which to paint your portrait. But, apparently they only brought one lens for tight facial shots.

The clear answer is that the ""Academy"" is not composed of sailors, and the producers count on the fact that 99.9% of theater-goers are also not sailors. As a sailor who has suffered some fairly serious offshore troubles in a vessel not dissimilar from Redford's here, It is almost unfathomable how unprepared such a man was to be sailing alone in the Indian Ocean. I don't really want to begin listing all of the stupid decisions he made, not least was not beginning right away to pump out the water that had already come aboard when he discovered his initial collision (sound sleeper, he!). Yet his lack of preparedness and intelligence pales in comparison to the outright stupidity of the producers, director, and anyone involved with the project to not have at least one offshore sailor on staff to steer them at least closer to reality. When a vessel of that size is rolled over completely, you can bet there are sizable waves afoot. Well, then why when we go with the character on deck do we fail to see anything but some minor chop. At one point he finally tries to hank on his storm jib (or staysail), supposedly due to the ferocious winds, and the sail is barely moving in the manufactured storm. Notice to ""Hollywood"": stick to rom-coms and 3-D animation, as you do them well, but please avoid sailing until you are truly ready to do it right; it's just plain embarrassing.",1396051200,33,1505,4.619402985074627

The fragment of story can be summed up as follows:  After a collision with a shipping container at sea, a resourceful sailor (Robert Redford) finds himself, despite all efforts to the contrary, staring his mortality in the face. Add endless storms, a heap of bad luck, and a lot of improbable happenings, toss in Robert Redford, bathe it in music by Alex Ebert, and provide sort of a sellout at the end and All Is Lost.  For a man versus nature film it is well done, but it lacks a story - not a theme - but a story. It grows tiresome. Grady Harp, March 14",1395532800,,1023,4.284974093264249

5919979,5,B00EIPEQLW,For a movie with next to no dialogue I thought it was pretty gripping!  Redford is at his best and you watch this movie unfold and wonder...WOW...what's he going to do next.

5919980,5,B00EIPEQLW,"I thought this was an excellent movie and not only because the only actor in it is Robert Redford.  Without giving away too much of the plot, Robert Redford is set adrift in the ocean after one unlikely calamity after another besieges him and his boat.  Don't rent this movie if you are a fan of witty banter.  There is none.  In fact there is hardly any speaking in it at all.  But the emotional rollercoaster this man is on comes through never the less.

He just isn't a strong enough actor to carry a movie, with no dialog, on his own. We never know who this guy is, why is he out on the sea, does he have any family, and as things start going wrong what is his motivation for staying alive? Nothing, the movie gives us nothing, but an old man who systematically deals with the series of mishaps at sea. I can't recommend this movie even if you are a Robert Redford fan. Big disappointment.",1395446400,2,534,4.245098039215686
5919982,2,B00EIPEQLW,"I should have expected that a movie about a man lost at sea would have very little dialog. The DVD cover looks exciting with Robert Redford at the helm during a raging storm, but with hardly a word spoken, it is a test of will to watch this to the end. It would have been a better movie if there was someone else on the boat with him. Even a dog on the boat to talk to would have made this a better movie. Wait for it to come out on your favorite video streaming service, then you can bail out if you find the lack of dialog too much to endure.

5919984,4,B00EIPEQLW,"Because of all the negative reviews I was hesitant to watch this. But I found the movie to be engaging, elegant, and introspective. It's a simple story of survival against great odds, so it doesn't need any other bells and whistles. The reason for the lack of dialogue is patently obvious (there's no one else around), and serves to heighten the sense of isolation. Redford portrayed his thought processes and emotions brilliantly without the need for words. I was really interested in his decision-making and felt his despair, often wondering what it would be like if I were in his place. The fact that he stopped to shave just as the storm rolled in just told me that he was confident and deliberate. That the ships couldn't see his flares is not implausible. Those are extraordinarly huge ships and he's a tiny speck on a vast plain of water. The juxtaposition of all the fish and sea creatures thriving right underneath him while he faced death was fantastic. I was totally engaged and never bored.",1395360000,,1002,4.731428571428571

Remember ""Castaway?"" Well, this one is even quieter, as there is no comedy relief in the form of a volleyball. This is just a man at sea, trying to survive. I can't say more than that or I will ruin the plot. Watch it. Redford delivered and you felt everything he was going through.

There is only one character in the movie, very little dialogue, and no interaction with anybody so the viewer has little chance to really get to know the main character.

Obviously they are very experienced sailors that have sailed the oceans. As novice sailors.we were too engrossed in the movie to critique those things. Robert Redford did an excellent job of conveying the feelings of the character without dialogue. Much like Tom Hanks in Castaway the frustration and desperation the character felt came across the screen without the need for words.  My husband told me that sailboats could flip over and then right themselves but I had never seen one do that before. The fact that one bad thing after another happened to the character had me sitting on the edge of my seat thinking, "" OMG how is he going to get out of this one."" This was on actor on one set doing an entire movie but saying maybe two words. What a challenge for an actor to take on! So it wasn't perfect in every detail, what is.

A huge gaping hole in the boat....he wakes up, makes a cup of coffee, checks the sports page, takes a shower,  checks his email, orders pizza, does some Pilates & Yoga, and then finally he decides he should maybe get around to fixing the boat.

Boat is sinking, he launches the life raft, ties said life raft to sinking boat, and once again decides he is going to take a little nap....in the life raft that is tied to a sinking ship. Some curious logic for sure.

He then wakes up from his little nap, decides maybe he should go back to the sinking boat to get what he can. Grabs some of this and some of that, all at a leisurely pace, throws what he thinks he needs back into the life raft....with the exception of the large flotation ring tied directly next to where he tied the rope that connects to the raft. Quite frankly he deserved to drown.

Maybe at the theater knowing nothing about this movie it came off a little better, but watching the DVD this movie really should have been called ""the absent minded sailor"" or ""diary of a stupid man.""

I could have given one star...but with the passage of time this movie will probably make good comedy fodder for some future edition of MST3K.",1395014400,,1460,4.388888888888889
5920029,5,B00EIPEQLW,"I may be old fashioned but I really appreciated a low technology approach that was used in this excellent film. The film is in some ways an analogy for the conditions of human life, for the forces of nature and accident work against us and we can either fight against the coming of the cold night or we can give up. Robert Redford plays a man who continues to fight, to not give up, and to accept it all with a certain amount of grace and resolve. Because the film is highly realistic the viewer is really not certain of the outcome for this sailor. The conditions continually worked against him as he tried to survive at sea and any lucky breaks were due to his ingenuity rather than a gift from nature. Robert Redford is excellent playing this mature stoic character.  One reviewer criticized the film for not showing enough character development during this ordeal. I would disagree with this assessment since the character of this man has been set long ago and the film is about the test of that character under the stressful and dangerous conditions that he undergoes. This is not a film about character development; it is a film about character testing. This story is believable and Redford is excellent as the protagonist, a man struggling against the cold dark with all his strength, a fate we all face in one way or another.",1395014400,,1333,4.577405857740586

I have sailed many thousands of ocean miles and don't believe the actions this solo sailor took in many, if not most of the scenes in this movie. Whoever wrote this movie had no concept of life at sea. Yes, hitting a shipping container is a real possibility, but everything else about the movie didn't make any sense.

5920071,2,B00EIPEQLW,"When I first heard of All is Lost and saw bits of the trailer I, as a sailor, thought; ""Good! Another classic story of a single Man versus the Sea."" Or at least Robert Redford is a ""rich, white guy who may know something about sailing"".  Unfortunately All is Lost was a disappointment on both scores.

First let me acknowledge that sailing is, like golf, a sport of aggravation:  -man deliberately putting himself and his skills before Fortune and her sidekick, Murphy.  If anything can go wrong, it will.  And top that with the inevitability that a human will often respond with a most perfectly WRONG action.  I, as any other sailor who's worth a damn, has made every stupid mistake that can be made on water or land,  and yet I'm sure there are many more I have yet to discover.  While the entire earth has been mapped, stupidity is still a vast unexplored territory open for adventure.  That's sailing.

Bearing that mind in is it any wonder sailors are detail oriented?  We know every rope, cleat, and bolt on a boat, and we know what they're for.  Robert Redford took a risk taking up a sailing movie. I wish he'd had more sailors around as consultants when he'd made it.  Then, maybe, all the previous reviewers would have had less technical fodder to chew on.  But honestly folks, the flaws were so frequent and obvious that it detracted from whatever esoteric story Robert Redford was trying to say.  Sailors, the audience who should have appreciated a movie like this, choked on the details,  and non-sailors, who didn't care about the details, just got bored out of their gourds.  Between the two, All is Lost, lost  all of the audience.

So the movie became a drinking game for both: Landlubbers - ""What else can happen to this Sad Sack?"" and us salty nit-pickers - ""How many boating flaws can you spot?""  Among the latter, previous reviewers noted:

Using a knife to cut loose the d-masted rigging.  I wondered how he got so lucky to have only one stay to cut?
How did he pull in a sea anchor with no collapsing cord visible? (not all have them). Why did he even need it against the mass of the container?

And questions abounded about the protagonist's sailing skills.
His storm jib was not a storm jib, which begged the question: Why did he have any cloth up at all in the storms, and while sleeping below with no watch on deck? Setting his inflatable life raft on fire to attract a rescue boat?  Dumbness off the U.S. coast OK, but how did he get all the way to the Indian Ocean and still kept such inept skills?  Somethings defy logic.

Now human beings do strange things, and have baffling priorities.  So maybe, under the heading, ""I can't make this stuff up folks..."", his deeds may have been ""realistic"". For example:

Why did he care about navigation in a lifeboat he had no directional control of?

Was Robert Redford so intent on maintaining his Hollywood good looks that he'd break the fourth wall and stay clean shaven all the way to the end? (but Hollywood never lets reality get in the way of an ""artsy"" story. Case: the bearded Green Beret in Deer Hunter)

All of this, like Science Fiction, could have been forgiven if the story had been any good.  Survival stories are hard to screw up. Usually they can't help but be heroic, but before the end of this movie I had stopped caring how it would end.",1394582400,,3328,4.505843071786311
5920072,5,B00EIPEQLW,Had us on the edges of our seats.  Certainly  commentary on one man's will to survive!  Robert Redford is awesome in thisrole!,1394582400,,126,4.636363636363637
5920073,5,B00EIPEQLW,"So many bad reviews here.  Most of them complaining about improper sailing techniques.  I think those reviewers have missed the point.  But maybe the director has missed the point as well.  The audio commentary also focuses on technical details, in this case the details of moviemaking.  Most directors do the same.  It is hard to find an audio commentary that emphasizes the big picture, i.e. the literary values of the story, except when the Criterion Collection hires an academic to do the commentary.  So what is ""the big picture"" here?  As a person who is about the same age as Robert Redford, I see the film primarily as a metaphor for old age and death.  The appropriate comparison is with Hemingway's ""The Old Man and the Sea,"" not with the ""Cast Away"" that so many reviewers have mentioned.  When we get old, things fall apart.  The last ten years or so are filled with unending attempts to make repairs, some of them successful, others not.  Increasingly, they are not.  We do not always do the most sensible thing under the circumstances.  None of us are experts at aging.  For me, the sailboat is our youthful body, the raft a wheelchair.  Eventually, even the wheelchair does not suffice.  Because I prefer reality, I would have ended the film a minute earlier than the director did, with Redford sinking slowly into the sea (death).  As an atheist, I would have foregone the last minute ""deus ex machina"" (resurrection) that recalls the outstretched hand of God on the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel.  But most Americans are religious, and even those who are not want happy endings.  Which is why so many American movies, including the violent ones that are most successful at the box office, are fairy tales.  The other big complaint from reviewers is boredom, the lack of action in this film.  The majority of Americans, for whom computers have replaced books, no longer have the attention span for serious subjects.  I expect that this film will be better appreciated in Europe than in the United States.",1394582400,3,2020,4.77456647398844

This skipper spent way too much time puttering about, and not near enough time at the helm, seeing to the survival of his vessel. If you fall into the ocean tied to the boat, especially alone & in heavy seas, you are gonna drown unless you're very near a fixed boarding ladder, or unless the rail (on your side of the boat) is in the water. Drown. And if you're taking to the life raft, with no means to steer or propel it, forget the damn sextant and take food, and water, and blankets...and be quick about it. Would you really stand below deck in waist deep water and apply butterfly tapes to a wound, when you could take the mirror with you and do it in the raft? And maybe use the mirror later for signaling? And tethering the raft to a sinking yacht, then falling asleep - I about had a heart attack. My wife was worried about staying awake thru a movie with a one word script. But the action, fanciful or not, kept her awake. It also confirmed her worst fears about sailing, whether realistic or not. Dang it! I've been trying for years to get her back on the ocean. Now I'm afraid 'all is lost'.

No one in those kind of circumstances would do everything perfectly. You can tell early on how much of an attachment he had to the boat.

5920103,1,B00EIPEQLW,"All is Lost is about a lonely man's struggle to survive in the open ocean against the odds. This movie does try to stand out as it's nearly silent (no dialogues). However, this movie is one of the worst I have ever seen, and I must mention, it's not because I am trying to compare it with other movies.
I saw 93% positive ratings on rotten tomatoes and rented it. WHAT A DISAPPOINTMENT! Robert Redford himself might be great, but sorry, that does not cut it. There is absolutely no explanation about:
1) why he was out there (to begin with)
2) what is (or was) he doing being alone (why would you be in the middle of ocean?)and
3) where is (or was) he headed to.
These unanswered questions are the biggest drawbacks of the movie. Next, the plot has so many loopholes, its unbelievable. ""spoiler alert"" There is a scene at the end where he uses fire, and it is ridiculous to see that he can be so kid-like for what he does. It's certainly a big mistake on scriptwriter and the director.
Lastly, this movie has absolutely no entertainment value whatsoever. When you watch him struggle without any logical reason, it bores you to death watching him working on that boat. I mean, at the end, why all is that for? Struggle for life? Good. But then how did you got into trouble in the first place? In short, when you don't get answers to this, then the whole affair seems useless, thereby, actually annoying.
All being said, I simply cannot believe that 93% of (so-called) critics liked it. If someone is saying that this is an ""Oscar-worthy"" or ""masterpiece"", they seriously need to do some self critique. I have seen this years Oscar contenders, and believe me, this has no reason to be in that line. Forget about 'masterpiece', this is one of the worst films I have ever seen.

My mummy watched it too. When we landed in LA, I asked what she thought of it and from her point of view, it was stressful. When I saw it twice that time in scenes where Bobby was underwater I was like ""ow. Ow. Ow. My eyes, they burn."" Towards the end of it I was also like ""Ow. Ow. Ow. My eyes and ears hurt.""

Coupled with a hauntingly beautiful song track, which I later bought, the film is so completely immersive it left me wanting to go back and watch it again just to relive the strong range of feelings the story and Redford evoke.

5920119,2,B00EIPEQLW,"When I look at the praises from authentic movie reviewers that are listed on the front of this product's case, I have to roll my eyes and shake my head at the ridiculousness of it all. Did these people really watch the same movie I did? Is it possible? ""AMAZING,"" or ""A TRIUMPH,"" or ""A MASTERPIECE"" aren't at all words I would use to describe this stinker of a film. There were just too many flaws with this movie that were far to easy to spot and pick apart. I may be no sailor, but when I watched this movie, I couldn't imagine Robert Redford as an accomplished sailor, either, and wasn't that the point? He was completely unbelievable in this role, and that probably wasn't his fault. He can act well enough, but the director must not know much about this topic, either. I can't imgine any boatsman worth his salt liking this movie or felling any authenticity in it.

Some of the glaring flaws with this movie include the captain of this vessel...

1. ...calmly and unhurriedly walking around and inspecing his boat as ocean water pours into it from a large and obvious hole in the side of it - directly into the path of the boat's only method of communication. If you knew your communication equipment was likely to be ruined within the next couple of minutes, wouldn't it be smart to, y'know, call someone and let them know you are in trouble while you can still do so? Aparently not.

2. ...NEVER donning a life vest. What? Your ship is floundering and may sink but you can't be troubled to put on a life vest? What are you - five years old? Even in a raging sea, you think to strap yourself to the boat with a safety line but you forget to put on a life vest and don't even think it's worth your time to bring one with you on the lifeboat? Insanity! Any half-wit would see the need for a life vest when a ship is going down.

3. ...failing to apply any sun block or even bring any with him on the life boat. Is this his first time sailing? Doesn't he know the ocean is lacking in shade trees?

4. ...not really comprehending how to catch a fish or the necessity of learning to do so. Again, really?! You are a boatsman who is inexperienced at catching a fish? Do you thnk you are just going to come across floating cans of food out thee in the ocean? I can't believe it.

5. ...failing to seal his container of potable water. Let's face it. If you are going to be adrift on the ocean in a lifeboat for ANY period of time, you are going to need to safely protect your store of fresh water. Other than breathable air, it is the number one essential to keeping yorself alive. Not this guy, though. He ruins his store of fresh water nearly immediately.

6. ...learning to navigate by using a sextant. Not generally an unbelievable feat except that he does this in a matter of hours and seems to be pretty good at it right off the bat. I refuse to believe it is THAT easy.

This movie COULD have been a good movie, but there is far too much wrong with it. You know (sort of from the title, but confrmed within the first couple minutes of the movie) right from the start that this guy is going to survive. I don't care for movies that give away the ending withintthe first couple of minutes. This is just one more thing to irritate me. Even at the end of the movie, he COULD have survived if he has just worn a stupid life vest. If a guy this dumb really decided to set sail (all by himself, mind you) across the world...  well, he probably deserves to end up dead. Not that we'll ever know why he is out there by himself. The movie never explores or expands on that. The viewer is left totally in the dark about that part of this guy's story.

There is just so much NOT to like about this movie. There was definitely potential for a good movie, here, but the director and screenwriters really fouled it up. I would never watch this movie a second time and would never recommend this movie to a friend or family member.",1394236800,8,3920,4.249664429530202

Rating: 3.5 out of 5.0

J.C. Chandor has gone far afield in his second feature and he should be applauded for tackling a subject so different from his first one, Margin Call--about the 2008 financial world implosion. Here it's minimalism at its best, Robert Redford all alone in a sailboat on the Indian Ocean, with virtually no dialogue throughout the film. It begins with Redford's unnamed character (referred to 'Our Man' in the credits) reading his epitaph in a voice-over narration. Flashback eight days earlier and we see how this intrepid sailor ended up in so much trouble: a shipping container somehow has landed plump in the middle of the sea, and rams his tiny sailboat, causing the cabin to fill with water. As a result, all his high-tech equipment is ruined and he's forced to be creative with makeshift repairs.

The first half of the film focuses on the sailor's efforts to keep his boat upright. What keeps our interest is the various ways in which he goes about surviving: stockpiling rations, emptying the hold of water and climbing up the mast to secure the sails. The sailor also comes up with an ingenious way of collecting rain water. Then there's a tremendous storm and the boat is turned upside down and then righted again.

The second half of the film revolves the sailor's actions after he's forced to abandon ship. All that's left is his tiny inflatable raft, which he's mercilessly tossed around in, during a second storm. There's also an obligatory scene with sharks surrounding the small craft and passing giant ships, which fail to spot the hapless sailor, as he fires flares into the sky.

In reading some posts on the internet, those who have sailing experience indicated that the depiction of the sailor's skills in attempting to save the ship lacked authenticity (for example, the flimsy patching job would not have held out in that kind of sea). As someone with no background in the area, I was willing to suspend my disbelief for the sake of simply being entertained. I did take issue with the film's ending, where the sailor dives into the water and sinks toward the bottom, in an apparent suicide try. He did seem awfully deep before he saw the other boat and could be rescued and I wonder if he could so easily have held his breath that long and was able to swim back up, where he was pulled to safety.

Nonetheless, most of 'All is Lost' will keep your interest to the end. Redford's performance is admirable given that he did most of the stunts. I look forward to Mr. Chandor's next film since he has proved that he's capable of applying the old adage, 'variety is the spice of life', to his film career, which is certainly a good thing indeed!",1394064000,,2728,4.661122661122661

He portrays an old man with a lot of fight left in him whose face expresses his awareness of imminant danger, his fears and terrors, his anger, frustration and depression, and his utter exhaustion and physical pain as he battles against the elements and the worst luck a sailor can have. This is really a pure action film because there's very little language--he shouts out ""Help"" a few times--but the sounds of wood cracking, water rushing, waves crashing and the boat struggling to stay upright kept me mesmerized: I was literally gripping my arms across my chest or clasping my hands together in stunned awe at the power of nature, at sea, black sky streaked with lightening, high waves around the boat that block out all else.

I was mesmerized by Redford's face: he has aged beautifully and gracefully, and he is old! There is no hiding the fact that he is old--nobly, wisely, solitarily old. He is boney and craggy, he has an old man's mouth, he has aches and pains, and his face shows it all. I see this movie as a great homage to old age: the sailor may not move as quickly as he once did, and he may need to rest more, but nothing will stop his fight to win out against the ever-increasing odds against him. I cried out loud as he contemplated his own imminent death, because he never stops fighting bravely, he never gives up or surrenders to self-pity. I thought to myself, This movie is a lesson on how to face death bravely and with as much humanity as an individual can muster.

I was spiritually gripped by this movie, and I am dumbfounded by the fact that Redford wasn't nominated for a Best Actor Oscar: this was one of his most NAKED portrayals of a human being against all odds. I really loved this movie's honesty about facing death and continuing to rage against the dying of the light. Although the critics love it, the audience seems to have had mixed reactions: perhaps it's too naked and truthful for those viewers who are expecting Hollywood to work its magic of fantasizing everything--how people look above all else. Redford's beautiful 78-year-old face told the whole truth and nothing but the truth.",1393977600,2,2222,4.622784810126582

I would refuse to get on a boat of any kind where the ""Captain"" wasn't smart enough to don a flotation device as the first step when trouble showed it's face.

5920152,4,B00EIPEQLW,"In the early 20th century, a literary movement known as Naturalism caught on as war suddenly began to grip America once again.  Influenced by the work of Charles Darwin, Naturalistic writers wanted to emphasize the dark, harshness of life as well as mans lack of control of the natural forces that truly guide his fate.  All is Lost is as close to cinematic Naturalism as Ive ever seen.

Robert Redford plays a character whose name is never revealed, a typical trait of Naturalism as these forms of expression look to stress natures indifference to man. This indifference is further exemplified with the films opening scene where the man (Redford) awakens from a nap below deck on his sailboat to find that a stray floating cargo container had somehow drifted into the side of his boat, puncturing it and resulting in the boat quickly taking on water.  No explanation is given for this circumstance or than that it presumably fell off of a cargo ship and, as fate would have it, collided with the boat.  The man is a pensive man; he does not react wildly or make rash decisions, rather he weighs his options and relies on his experience and skills.  Redfords is the only character in the entire film, and he is also a man of few words; accordingly, the script for All is Lost is only 32 pages long.  Thus, writer/director J.C. Chandors film looks to explore modern Naturalism at sea as deliberately as possible.

All is Lost is a riveting achievement.  As we watch this man struggle through a series of events set into motion by that seemingly innocuous cargo container, we are forced to mull over our own mortality and our own suitability to circumstance.  Last year, Ang Lees adaptation of Life of Pi beautifully captured some of what All is Lost attempted to capture, but that film was far more Romantic in its aspirations.  All is Lost instead puts plot aside and seeks to pit man against nature in a rigorous, albeit somewhat predictable series of events.  The result is a compelling yet extraordinarily minimalistic effort that does feel redundant at times.

Earlier this year, Alfonso Cuar&oacute;ns Gravity also pitted man against incredible odds in a far more successful way.  While both films depict mans struggle with expertise, Cuar&oacute;n, like Ang Lee before him, understood the need to make the film a visual spectacle as well.  Thus, those films certainly utilize the media of film far more than All is Lost, while All is Lost relies more on Redford.  Fortunately, Redford delivers.  The sharp, witty con-man from The Sting is no more, but he has been replaced by a weathered and beaten sailor who may have the grit to do what Johnny Hooker never could  win an Oscar.  B+

All is Lost is rated PG-13 and has a running time of 1 hour and 46 minutes.  It is a nailbiter and a triumph for Redford.  The score by indi-rock name Alex Ebert is also characteristically right on.",1393891200,,2889,4.713147410358566

The direction of the film was very creative leaving the dialogue through our eyes. It is truly a visual story with great sound editing. At the end of the film, we begin to understand the message that it ants to share with us. If you like a good indie flick, this is one to take in.

As a whole, the movie is a nauseating collection of scenes of Redford eating, sleeping, doing something worthless, bumbling around in stormy weather like gimp in a straight jacket, and talking into the wrong side of a hand-held mic.

5920189,2,B00EIPEQLW,"All is lost illustrates the story of a lone sailor (Redford) who finds himself, despite all of his efforts, staring death in the face after a collision with a shipping container at sea.

I will first say that I am a fan of Redford and of a lot of his movies but this one didn't do it for me. I mean I get the whole man versus nature thing that the movie is portraying here but I am afraid that it has been done before and done much better (Life of Pi, Castaway, and Perfect Storm for example) I have several issues with the movie, first there is no back story at all. Why is he sailing solo? Who is this man? Why is he in the middle of the ocean in the first place? What is his story? Why if he is sailing solo does he make very poor decisions in an emergency? Why is he so unprepared for an emergency? Things like that. I am all for the premise of the movie, but give me something to know and care about the character. Unfortunately this movie doesn't. I only see an inept sailor who frankly does a very poor job at the decisions he makes throughout. Secondly, there is very little or no dialogue, maybe 20 words at most through the whole movie (maybe they were paying per word I don't know) which leads to a very dry and slow moving boring movie. Give me something, a back narrative, the character talking to himself, or explaining some of the things that he is doing, which to those who aren't familiar might not be aware. The problem is not the premise here, but the problem is the lack of any kind of story that gives you anything to keep you interested and motivated in watching.

To give it credit though, the storm sequences are definitely well done and realistic but in between the long stretched of boredom, there is very little else here to keep you watching. Some people who have given it a good rating and say it is a thinking man's movie. I will agree with that to a point, you will be thinking what to do during the movie to keep yourself awake and what to do after you finish watching.

This movie is the type that creates a wide variety of opinion on whether it is good or not. Some will enjoy the artistic style that this movie displays by showing the symbolism for life and being alone at sea. But for me personally, All is lost is too slow moving, too many basic boating errors, has very little dialogue of any type, with no back story, and no real story at all which makes me give this the rating I do.

5920190,4,B00EIPEQLW,"""Perhaps one of the most powerful and likely upsetting survivalist dramas I have seen lately since 127 Hours. All is Lost entails, perhaps, the most classical elements of filmmaking and storytelling by relying on sound, atmosphere, and visuals to accompany you along the journey than voice.

 All is Lost tells the story of a lonely man at sea chronicling his tough journey as he tries to survive through treacherous tidal waves, storms, rain, and broken parts of his vessel. Robert Redford, who is our main and only character in the film, is ferociously compelling as your average man finding tranquility while boating.

 His performance reminds me a lot of what silent film stars would do allowing movement and emotions tell you what is going on and how he feels more than saying something. But the little to no dialogue and atmospheric intensity is not just a plus point, the film's aim to be straightforward and detailed about the perils and horror of boating gone wrong makes not only for compelling viewing but an emotional catharsis on the filmmakers' part to let the audience know that with flexibility, courage, and stamina can one survive such harsh circumstances.

 It is timeless without it meaning to be and the lost-at-sea concept in the film is put to good use without it being preachy or over-the-top on occasion like 127 Hours, or for that matter, commercialized like Cast Away. The main problems with the film regardless would most likely have to do with the audience perception and how many will find this boring, the use of fade ins-and-outs and extensive long shots to make you think it will end or not, and Redford's unnamed character saying almost nothing other than radio call signals and a curse word. Most people, even if lonely, will not go as far as to say almost nothing- they may otherwise hum, sing, or tell their self a funny limerick. Sorry but it seemed a bit far-fetched but I find it excepting moreover.

 Nonetheless, I still urge you to consider All is Lost as a determining and intense film to go see in a time where many of the Oscar-nominated films are worth of praise but nothing short of just being bait and usually predictable by what they present- whether it be drama or a historical piece.""",1393632000,,2236,4.75968992248062

NO SPOILERS: I can only imagine that when Redford looked at this script it had Oscar written all over it. But his acting had no chance. Take a look at that movie poster, it is very symbolic. His ego at the wheel of this horrible idea of a movie.

WHY IT FAILS: I will not spoil this movie, so I will compare it successful films of the same genre: ""Gravity"", ""Castaway"" and ""Moon"". It's very simple: They feed you some BACKSTORY, you see TRAITS of the character, you start to UNDERSTAND the character, then cinema-magic happens: you FEEL for the character.

In this movie, the 1 minute backstory is a quick hazy apology narrative, then 1:45 minutes of predictable survival footage. The reason I say that ego got the best of Redford, is that he must have thought we would root for Robert Redford the actual man, since we have no knowledge of this Lady Clairol dyed, red-headed, raisin faced septuagenarian. Yes that was a downright mean thing to say, but Redford can laugh at me from the plush, multi-million dollar home that he bought with the proceeds from this movie. While I type this from inside a cardboard box on my phone.

WHEN YOU DON'T TELL BACKSTORY, ALTERNATE PLOTS EMERGE: If you are like me, when you get bored during a bad movie, you begin to think about what the author is not telling us. What he is HIDING from us. At the 15 minute mark, I was already on the case. This man probably escaped from a prison that was on the coast. Then Redford the prisoner scurried down to a nearby wharf. He saw some old man on his little boat. A man who happened to be on his first day of retirement from being a prison guard at the same prison that the dirty Redford escaped from. The guard who got him extra books for his cell, on SAILING no less. Redford kills the old man and takes his boat out to sea. Redford how could you.

Or maybe he is a dead-beat daddy on the run with 5 mouths to feed and a wife in a wheel chair now starving back home. Or maybe he sailed out here into the ocean to dump a few dead hookers and is now feeling guilty. After endless similar thoughts, I was not going to be taken in by this derelict. I KNEW Redford was a bad man, I was not waiting for the secret to be revealed to us in the theater... and you can quote me on the back of the Blu-ray case:

""I was rooting for Mother Nature to give him the Titanic of all salt water enemas."" - me, Paying Customer

OSCARS: Oscar nominee? OMG you are not serious. If you are an Oscar fan like me, you wanted to put ""My Left Foot"" into the back of the voter's behind.

MY RECONCILLIATON: I am sorry, I got a little spun-up there. So here is my olive branch to you, the viewing audience. We have now come to the sober realization that we are 25 dollars lighter in the wallet. We are mad. We are angry. We are wanting to board a tour bus to the star's home and torch old Redford's home like a YELLOW deep sea INFLATABLE RAFT. But lets calm down, we all know what will happen if we participate in that. We saw ""The Last Castle"". Let's just remember what was really lost was getting to see Redford in a good movie. I am sincerely sad that he wasted his time on this film.

So let's all go watch a good movie and cheer up:
- I am a Robert Redford fan. If you want a great film with REDFORD there might even be fifty: ""The Sting"", ""The Natural"", ""Jeremiah Johnson"", ""Butch Cassidy"", ""3 Days of the Condor"". The list is endless.
- I am a survivor movie fan. Try: ""Poseidon Adventure"" (G. Hackman), ""Castaway on the Moon"", ""A Perfect Storm""
- I have thoroughly enjoyed movies with little dialog: ""Gravity"", ""Castaway"", ""Moon"".",1393632000,4,3697,4.254985754985755
5920193,5,B00EIPEQLW,"""All is Lost"" is an excellent film with many levels of understanding to be probed by the viewer.  One level is simply the ingenious will to survive following an accident that threatens existence, graphically depicting the overcoming of physical obstacles to surviving on a yacht in the middle of an ocean after a collision with a cargo container.  Redford is convincing as a person with the will and the knowledge to survive.  Nevertheless, the will of nature continues to gnaw deeply into Redford's strategies to survive, to live.  The film carries forth traditions of Hemingway's ""The Old Man and the Sea,"" the story of Spanish fisherman being pulled too far out to sea by a large, beautiful fish which, ironically, is ravaged by sharks.  Or an earlier short story of Stephen Crane's ""The Open Boat,"" in which a four of the crew of a ship sunk by a horrific storm are in a lifeboat attempting to get to land.  ""All is Lost,"" like the stories of Hemingway's Santiago or Crane's seamen of ""The Open Boat,"" become symbols and metaphors of personal struggle and existence in basically an indifferent world. The climax of ""All is Lost"" can be interpreted on many levels--all of which are satisfying to the viewer.  Nevertheless, it is as a Stephen Crane poem, ""A man said to the Universe/Sir, I exist/And the Universe replied/That fact creates within me/No sense of obligation.""  Robert Redford's portrayal epitomizes that courage, that struggle to survive that indifferent world.",1393632000,2,1477,4.951417004048583

Who goes out in the middle of the ocean alone without adequate equipment for communicating with civilization?  Didnt anyone know he was missing?  For Gods Sake, this is Robert Redford. At times we thought he was suffering from dementia.  Who decides to shave right after he identifies a huge storm is coming over the horizon and his boat is sinking? .  Who flips over a sail  boat at least 10 times and the boat lands upright and he lives.  Who has a hat to protect him from the sun and lets it float in the bottom of his life raft.  Lastly who starts a fire in a plastic container that is sitting on the floor of his vinyl life raft and doesnt expect it to start the raft on fire and send the raft up in flames?

If you are a non sailor it is a gripping suspense - - - If you are a blue water sailor it is wonderful comedy that rivals the three stooges.

I taught a fourteen week course in celestial and my students at least learned how to properly hold a Weems & Plath sextant unlike Redford. When surrounded with vital emergency steps to be taken to ensure his safety, our cool captain is below shaving. Whatta guy.

5920200,4,B00EIPEQLW,"What is it that leads people to weigh anchor and journey out onto the vastness of the open ocean in a tiny vessel, in search of nothing more than an adventure? This is a behavior Ive never understood. And having watched All is Lost I can now say that my intuitions are thoroughly vindicated. This is a harrowing film to watch, the most claustrophobic, confining film that Ive seen since the under-rated Buried (a film that takes place entirely in a coffin; see my review here). In this case, the coffin is replaced by a medium sized skiff. The sailor (he is never named) wakes from slumber and realizes things have taken a turn for the worst. The film follows the sailor over the next week as his world begins to shrink and life becomes increasingly perilous.

The sailor is played by Robert Redford in a bravura performance that would surely have been celebrated in most any year. (Im tempted to say Redfords was a bravura performance for a man his age. And so it is. But the demands of this film would test the mettle of most any actor, of that Im sure.) Alas, 2013 was an outstanding year for film, and it seems that All is Lost never quite garnered the spotlight it well deserved. Riveting, with a script that consists of no more than one paragraph of dialogue in the whole film. (A lesser film might have tacked on a voice over narration. Thank goodness All is Lost isn't a lesser film.)

Is all really lost? Does the sailor go down with his ship? Or does he live to a see another day? Once again, a lesser film would have tied up loose ends. But All is Lost ends in a delicious and well deserved ambiguity. If the sailor at sea is a metaphor for life  and why not?  then the ambiguity is but one more nod to the human predicament itself. In that sense were all at sea. Is all lost? Time will tell.

Near the end, a tragedy brings about an equally unexpected result (fate in reverse).  It is a little depressing but the acting by Redford is riveting and gripping to the soul.

5920213,4,B00EIPEQLW,"I watched ""Gravity"" earlier in the week, and I loved it, of course.  I thought that the physics were really good, perhaps too good for an American audience.  After all, most Americans get their science ""education"" from watching other sci-fi films, which are usually pretty lame.  Watch any episode of ""Star Trek"" where the stars go flying by the Enterprise as it zooms through space.  If you don't understand what's wrong with that picture, then all is indeed lost.  (I'll give you a hint:  the nearest star to earth, minus of course for our Sun, is something like four light years away.  How long would it take to get to that star, assuming you were traveling as fast as possible, and assuming that Einstein was correct about a ""cosmic speed limit?""  I'm assuming that both are good assumptions.)

But I was pretty let down by some of the reviews for ""Gravity"" on this site.  One of them:  ""There were to [sic] many mistakes in Gravity.""  Another:  ""I was really board [sic] by Gravity.""  And finally:  ""There were only two actors in Gravity.  I didn't get my money's worth!""  Now, I don't know about you, but I don't believe that there were ""too"" many errors in that film (other than the odds of survival), and I surely wasn't ""bored"" by it either.  As a matter of fact, it was quite riveting.  And it certainly didn't bother me that there were only two actors in that very fine film that should win an Academy Award; when you've got Sandra Bullock and George Clooney, I would say that two is indeed enough.

And what would that person who thought that two actors aren't enough say about this film?  I think we've only got one here, so according to his or her ""math,"" this film should only be worth half as much.  That would be a serious miscalculation, because when you've got Robert Redford, you may as well have a whole army.  And that's even true given his age.  I'll take him still over a handful of these young modern-day actors, most who can't act their way out of a paper bag.

And you'll see Mr. Redford here try to work his way out of a ship that's going down.  He tries every trick imaginable to survive, and what else is there?  To me, this is very realistic as it would be very dangerous sailing the world alone; you would have to be a jack-of-all-trades-master-of-none kinda guy.  This film reminds me a lot of ""Castaway,"" where I believe that Tom Hanks actually gave the finest performance of his career.  That film had a real documentary feel, and it really worked best when he was alone.  Well, alone with Wilson I suppose.

And I feel alone myself, when I read ""reviews"" like the ones that I discussed above.  I really shouldn't read them; they make me really feel that all is indeed lost in America.  It is sad when people can't use basic logic, or can't even spell correctly, or don't understand math or physics.  But then I remember that we still have Mr. Redford in America, and he's still acting after all these years.  And he's still acting well.

5920221,3,B00EIPEQLW,"Robert Redford has been an actor I've loved and hated. I've loved him when he was acting in roles that were memorable. I've hated him when he chose to force his political views into his roles. When I saw that ALL IS LOST was coming out I was afraid it would be just another film where his environmental views were the sole function of the film. I was pleasantly surprised to find I was wrong.

ALL IS LOST is a different kind of movie. There is perhaps one page of dialogue in the whole film, most of that spoken off camera as the film opens. Within minutes we are taken back 8 days to when all that follows is set in motion.

Redford plays the man, a nameless character in his mid seventies who wakes to find water flowing into his sailboat. He notes a hole in the side of the cabin and goes topside to find out what happened. A shipping container lost from a cargo ship is floating in the vast ocean, releasing tons of low costs tennis shoes and it's corner is inserted into side of his boat. First he must get his boat unattached from the container and then repair it.

He does this never breaking a sweat. Redford's character is cool under stress and uses his mind to great advantage. Making minor repairs he sets out to see what damage was done. Of course his radio was right under where the puncture took place leaving him with no way to call for help. Knowing he must take care of himself he does just that. But if that's all that happened this movie would have been about 80 minutes shorter.

If anything can go wrong it does. Obstacles like fresh water, food rationing, eventually a storm that re-damages his boat and more all become obstacles he must surmount. And while his cool attitude contends with each obstacle it's clear to see on his face that each one is taking its toll. His character isn't as simple as you believe when the film starts. Instead you see how each item changes him and forces him to evaluate everything going on around him. At his age should he invest so much time and effort into trying to remain alive? Will help reach him in time should he carry on? Has he done all that he could to survive?

All of these questions come not from the words Redford speaks because with the exception of one loudly yelled expletive there are no words. All of these thoughts and questions are written on his face, acted out for the viewer to surmise while watching. That's a difficult task for any actor and Redford steps up to the plate with his performance. As the film moves forward you root for him to make it and fear that there is no hope of his doing so. It tugs at you, wanting something good to happen to him and then feeling crushed with each new obstacle tossed his way.

As for environmental concerns none are voiced here but at the same time the majesty of nature surrounds Redford and his character from start to finish. The thought that here we have a singular person in the middle of an ocean filled with life and possibly about to lose his ties into the concept that no matter what happens in this planet, nature will rule in the end. That isn't a political statement, just a fact of life.

The good in this film is twofold. First there is the performance I've talked about. Secondly is the crew and the amazing work they've done here. To capture the vast ocean at its best and its worst would not be an easy task. But they've done just that, offering vistas of tremendous calm and beauty alongside the dangerous, dark storms that wreak havoc. When you discover, if you watch the extras, just how this was accomplished it makes you appreciate all the efforts that went into the production of this film.

The bad about this movie is that if you don't know what to expect when you see it, and a tad even if you do, then it could be seen as incredibly boring. Like I said, no dialogue, little in the way of action as seen in most films and lots of just watching an actor attempt to convey what is going on inside his character's head doesn't make for a movie that makes you jump up now and then. Instead the slow pace means some will hate it while others will understand just what they are watching. Go in expecting it to move slow at first and not speed up much later. Don't watch it if you are in need of a nap.

In the end I did enjoy the movie. Twenty minutes in I wasn't sure. By the time it finished I found that it was much better than I expected and much better than I thought early on. Stick with it and you'll find that this movie does what Hollywood does best; it entertains and makes you think at the same time.",1393372800,,4555,4.287209302325581

To me this movie presents our existential predicament. There's Redford, drifting alone at sea. We know absolutely nothing about him: why he's there, what's happened to him in his life, what he wants, where he's going. He's just there, like you and me are in our lives, on a living sea, with the sky above, the earth below, and the air in between. Redford plays this role of Everyman perfectly. A brilliantly nuanced performance takes him from relative ease with his circumstance to the inevitable. All we hear are natural sounds, and a single wail of frustration and pain from Redford. What happens at the end? Spoiler alert: Down he goes, but then a hand reaches out and he's raised into a blinding white light. My take: He physically died, but then lovingly is brought into the next journey. A loving hand reached out to him and took him somewhere beyond the moving image and the physical world.
Because this movie allowed me to have this interpretation, even if you, dear reader, think I'm nuts, I love it. I think it is brilliant in every way.",1393372800,4,1653,4.569023569023569

If you can get over the fact that there are maybe 15 words spoken the entire movie you then have to put up with a extremely slow movie.  Water floods into his boat on several occasions yet he moves slowly like he is out for a Sunday drive.  If I had water flooding into a boat in the middle of the ocean you can bet I'd be running around like my rear end was on fire.

I don't remember him responding to any catotrophic event with despair, desperation. Redford never said a word through the entire movie, he may have mildly grunted her or there.

I usually enjoy the films that Robert Redford stars in, but All Is Lost was exactly as the  title said it was  Lost.  It was also very frustrating watching him do such stupid things.

Whoever provided technical advice on the sailing aspect really let the sailing community down. To the sailing un initiated the obvious errors would go unnoticed. For those who have experienced life and adventures at sea in sailboats the errors and unlikely scenarios stood out like sore thumbs, and took the edge off an otherwise well done tough to film subject. For the non sailor, the film gives a good feel for life aboard a small boat far from land, and how Murphy's law leads from one disaster to the next.",1393113600,,693,4.783333333333333

5920269,5,B00EIPEQLW,"Remember Santiago in The Old Man and the Sea?  Santiago struggled with a marlin which he caught off the shores of Cuba and the reader follows the struggle of the old man trying to bring his catch to shore.  With All is Lost we also have old man struggling not with a marlin but the very ocean itself.
 God only knows why the character played by Robert Redford is alone out in the middle of the Pacific Ocean by himself.  In a rather well equipped sailboat our senior gentleman of some means is floating alone when a renegade container of Asian origin collides with his sailboat in the middle of the night waking our hero with a gaping hole in his boat.  As the gaping hole sends a plethora of ocean brine into his luxurious boat our hero scrambles to minimize the damage.
 Using resourceful tools our hero tries to mend the hole and right the ship to shore.  However Mother Nature does not cooperate as a storm at sea makes for a battle of wits with the ocean in which Mother Nature prevails and sends the luxurious sailboat to Davey Jones Locker.
 Succumbing to the disaster, our hero uses the resources to his last resort of an inflatable lifeboat in which he tries to drift with the aid of a sextant to a major Pacific shipping lane where he hopes to be sited and rescued.  Much like Hemingways Santiago we follow our heros exploits of lack of water and food in order to seek his rescue whereas Santiago struggles to bring in his marlin whole.  Similar as both men are trying to prove survival in their own ways.
 Redford succeeds much as Chaplin did in his classics without speaking one word!!  Great movie!!!",1393027200,,1613,4.448979591836735

The character Redford portrays, displays none and at times acts the bufoon, like taking time to shave in the midst of a crisis.  Really!!

The biggest issue for me was that, being an off shore sailor, I found the sailing scenes very contrived and unrealistic.  The lack of preparation that Redford, as the skipper, did with this boat for this kind of sailing and the mess he kept the boat in was very unseaman like.  My only thought was that perhaps the movie was really about not being ready for trouble rather than a single brave and competent man against disaster scenario.

The lack of narration would also put off many viewers.  Hey, Redford didn't even talk to himself!  This lack resulted in my being much more aware of the sound quality, and that was strictly A1.  No wonder it got a nomination for sound.

I also found the cinematography top drawer.  This again I probably noticed more than usual due to the lack of dialogue.
Redford delivered the goods in acting and I just found the entire movie great in all ways.

Still, Redford does his thing very well and he is perhaps one of only two or three actors who could do this convincingly. The commentary is terrible. The director's commentary contains hundreds of ""you knows"" and ""ums"" that make the commentary really painful to listen to. Did he even listen to his commentary? Apparently not.

How alot of the events unfold in the movie just don't even make sense...(a ship container breeches the fiberglass hull on a dead calm day) and Redford's character seems old and is often asleep or falling asleep when the bilge of the boat is filled with 2 ft of water or the boat is rolling!!! Why was this character (who lacks physical strength to sail and makes the movie seem evern more tired) even in the middle of the ocean? He waits for the storm to be at full force before he gets out his storm jib...he doesn't seem to understand the importance of a working bilge pump ...fortunately, my wife...who talked me into renting this one because she loves Redford...fell asleep early in the movie, and as soon as her eyes were closed I hit the stop button and didn't have any second thoughts about not seeing how this nitwit stays alive in a life raft. I am sure there was some deeper theme in the movie that comes out to some who watch it...only thing I learned after 40 minutes is Redford can play an old, tired guy really well...",1392940800,,1209,4.401785714285714

As for the moving, sure, Robert Redford is a class act but this movie relies too much one actor to carry it.  When a hole is punched in your boat, you don't settle  in for a nice nap!  The only thing that kept me from walking out of this film was the fact that I had a full beer still and I would have had to make 6 people get up just to let me out.

5920312,4,B00EIPEQLW,"2013 seemed rich with films about survival, about facing unsurmountable odds and coming face to face with your literal fate.  No two movies seemed to get pegged with that label more than All is Lost and Gravity, and for most of the first half (and even second half) of last year these two films were compared to one another and pitted against one another and debated as a pair because of their similarities.  Both films offer us an intimate look at ONE persons fight for survival; sort of.  You see, where Gravity takes us on a journey of one womans physical, emotional and mental FIGHT to survive odds that seems utterly unconceivable, All is Lost shows us one mans mental preparation for the inevitable; death.

In other words, this is not the story of a fight but a portrait of a man who just gave up.

This is in no way, shape or form a knock to the value and quality of this film, but I do think that there is a clear dividing line between the two films and I feel that the distinction should be made because they are not the same film (with a different location) but really they are two separate films taking the same scenario (with a different location) and giving us an entirely different character portrait.

When All is Lost begins, we hear in voiceover our nameless main character (only character) recite his last words, a letter penned on his life-raft.  I don't mean to start the review in the negative, but the letter itself was rather vacant in meaning and Redfords line delivery was stagnant and emotionless.  I expected a more solemn, more endearing letter and especially delivery because this is supposed to set us up for the film we are about to watch, and in all honesty I wish that it had been cut from the film, because the film itself is much better than that opening would suggest.  Next, the film truly begins, eight days before the letter was written.  Redford is awakened by rushing water as he notices that his boat has struck a container floating in the middle of the ocean and has taken on a large hole and a lot of water.  He dislodges and patches his hole, but his troubles are only beginning.  With drenched electronics and a few maps, Redford is basically a sitting duck for any obstacle, and a terrible storm over the horizon is just the obstacle that is going to wreck his day, weeklife.

While this character is obviously resourceful (he mans the boat on his own, takes necessary precautions when he notices the storm looming overhead and even manages to survive when many would have lost their lives almost immediately) but it is clear that this man has resigned himself to death pretty early on.  He prolongs his life as long as possible, but his actions are predominately reactionary, taking what comes to him and not thinking about how he can survive outside of the now.

While some would say that this is a criticism and possibly even find fault with my assumption here, the fact remains that I actually think this angle colors in the character more than it would have had I tried to perceive him as a survivor in the most dramatic sense of the word.  He is a survivor, but his emotional decline (which is mostly wordless and fused together solely on expressions) is what drives the films core.  While many have complained that Redfords character basically sits the entire film out, confined to a raft while he watches the world around him crumble, I actually found this aspect of the film fascinating.  True, the films redundancy in many areas is a fault and one that should have been edited better.  There are many scenes that feel similar and don't further the point of the film much.  Bad things continue to happen, and there is an impact to be had with that awareness, but by the films end it became a tad too repetitive and that made the film feel less progressive and more stagnant.  Still, as I mentioned, this mans subconscious resign to death is what makes this film unique and more meaningful as a whole.  Instead of actively fighting to survive, this man travels through most of the film like a ghost, dwelling in this scenario but never truly living in it.  Even his attempts to be saved feel underdeveloped, but from a cinematic standpoint (because I really think this was the point) but from a personal level.  I feel as though the film was underscoring (subtly, which is why so many can presume these moments are just lazy writing) this mans coming to terms with his morality.

Redford is very good here.  In a nearly wordless performance, he completely engages who this man is inside and out.  There are so many reactionary scenes that capture such intense humanity without being theatrical or overwhelming.  He WAS this man, and that came through loud and clear.

From a technical angle, I found the film to be rather impressive.  The cinematography is exceptional here and really captures so many angles beautifully.  Im not just talking about the stunning underwater work (which is stunning) or the wide expanse of the open water, but the lighting used to portray the boat and the lifeboat are stunning in their own right and show such visual range.  I did like the score, but I also found that it was distracting in many scenes and added an overtness that the film was trying to avoid as a whole and so I really wish it hadnt been used.  The scenes that are devoid of music work so much better that the ones that utilize it.

As a whole, I can understand both sides of this argument.  This film has some devout supporters who consider it a masterpiece and one the finest films of the year.  There are also MANY who consider this a bore and a vacant work of nothing.  I don't agree with either sentiment, but I see why those conclusions are being drawn.  For me, All is Lost has a great central theme and J.C. Chandors handling of this film is pretty impactful, but the film lacks a tightness that I think would have served it well.  It is allowed too much room to drift in some areas, and while I do accept the ambiguous ending as a clear nod to hope (whether he be rescued or taken to heaven), I feel that it was sorely used and didn't fit the film properly.

Honestly, if you lopped off the films opening and closing and found a way to edit down about ten extra minutes of monotony throughout, this would be perfect.",1392854400,,6281,4.528786536758193

5920314,5,B00EIPEQLW,"This is essentially a silent film. Robert Redford is alone against the sea. He proves that he has been more than just a pretty face, delivering a tour de force performance.

The film works on several levels. It can be viewed as a realistic story of the struggle to survive, teaching us how to condense potable water at sea and how to launch a life boat. But it can also be viewed as an allegory of our journey through life. There are big breaches in our days that we have to use all our ingenuity to patch. There are a few moments of breathtaking beauty, but hardly enough time to enjoy them before another huge challenge presents itself. This is a profoundly moving story on whatever level it's viewed.

There are a lot of extras on this DVD, including a director/producer commentary. These commentaries are OK, but they don't really add anything to the experience of the movie. Unless you have a lot of time on your hands, you can probably skip these extras, and not dilute the impact of the movie itself.",1392768000,,1007,4.497267759562842

5920321,5,B00EIPEQLW,"To be fair, sadly, one must consider why anyone would outright call this first-rate brilliant movie boring. Simple answer: they've been fed so much fastfood big budget wowing special effects junk films that are just loud noise and excessive glitter keeping the mind occupied with nothing more than useless matter. Gone are the glorious films that stand out, with character and dignity. Well-written screenplays are rare, the majority are long extinct. So it is a rare occasion that a film comes out that is really worth paying the money to see. Watching this, a movie that dares to have practically no dialogue, and absolute focus on its star - that my friends is something you will see only once, and this is the movie. Redford owns this film from start to finish. He involves the viewer. His struggle becomes ours as we watch him fight for survival, frame-by-frame, even if he loses, there is no defeat. He tried. Which is something Hollywood films stopped doing years ago. There's no noise, no fat, no glamour in this film. It's all lean, fresh, captivating.

But, having said that, for those who like junk food films, the masses unfortunately, they will never appreciate something as bold and beautiful as this film. They've been conditioned not to - got to have everything served fast and meaningless, as for substance?... What's that? OK. I'm in the minority. Stick to movies like Star Wars, Parts 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, etc, ( a series that lost its magic after its first two films.) But who cares? We don't want boring.

The open sea, one man and a boat mixed with all that could go wrong.  He didn't start talking to a soccer ball to provide us with mild entertainment.  He fought hard to get out of the situation he was in and I found that very, very interesting.

Robert Redford will always be a stud, till the day he dies. But I don't want to watch him being whipped around by the elements for two hours, all alone, in a flipping sailboat, with a malfunctioning (of course) radio, and a wet laptop bopping him in the head.  I don't want to watch him eat a can of beans, twice. I don't want to watch his raft being circled by sharks. How cliche.

This Robert Redford film is also a ONE MAN PERFORMANCE..He gets into peril when his sail boat is punctured ... each obstacle becomes more challenging, yet the main character(the only character) rises to each challenge.

Life is a bit the same..we get hit with challenges as we go through life. We survive. we adapt.  Of course an ongoing peril at sea really brings across such a notion. This movie left me thinking.

Just remember to take this movie for what it is, it is a ONE MAN PERFORMANCE with only a little bit of actual dialog, being the character talking to himself or attempting to talk to others that are unseen.  I gave it four stars because I realize that this is not a movie for everyone. I got something out of it.",1392595200,,822,4.381578947368421

He is glorious for his freedom and refusing to stop trying IMHO.
I was glad to have Robert Redford to try and tell what to do to save his little vessel and of course could I have done more to get there safely? I think so but just past the end of mortality; he was saved by the same folks who doomed his craft. The tale being told was about the telling of tales and what's to be learned from tales is that tales never end because you pass them on and so the tales live forever.

There is no dialogue, just a brief statement, which itself is cryptic, but deeply human.

5920354,3,B00EIPEQLW,"I'm torn on this movie.  As someone who has solo sailed on the ocean, how the character handled the accident drove me nuts.  I imagine that the ""no panic"" approach that Redford's character took was supposed to convey a sense of supreme knowledge, but it looked more like bafflement to me.  And from what I could tell, what eventually doomed the boat wasn't even the original damage to its hull but being rolled twice by large rogue waves. Extremely unusual events, but I guess you've got to do something exciting for the people watching the movie...

HOWEVER!  I have been sooo disappointed by movies these last few years that I have to applaud any decent story, and I'd say that this one qualifies.  I'd like to give it 5 stars just for being a good movie, but it isn't that good.  Castaway is the obvious comparison, but Castaway had A LOT more story to it.  This is more of a short story compared to Castaway.

One piece of realism that I think this movie captured is the notion that the guy would give up trying to survive after only 5 days or so on the water.  We hear about people surviving for months at sea, but these are the lucky ones.  It's my understanding that 5 days in the tropical heat w/o water leaves you in pretty bad shape where death may very well be attractive.  I don't think that Redford captured this sense of desperation properly though.  His giving up at the end seemed to be more from an intellectual knowledge that he wasn't going to make it rather than from physical deterioration.  But I'm nit picking.

All in all, thank you to the people who made to movie for delivering something different from the milieu of junky movies!",1392595200,,1656,4.473333333333334

I do not consider myself a sailor, more of a novice fisherman actually - I was under the impression that the character in this movie was also somewhat of a novice and may have made some mistakes that a novice might make in an emergency situation.  At  any rate, it's a ""hollywood"" movie and I did not expect anything in the way of a documentary or a training film.  Then there's the group of people who don't like the film because they say it is slow and boring and cannot deal with the almost complete lack of dialogue.

Though there's little dialogue, Redford does a fantastic job of playing an older guy who seems haunted by his past just trying to survive a terrible misfortune at sea.  His facial expressions are more than enough to convey the roller coaster of emotions his character experiences, one minute sure he will survive or be rescued, the next giving up all hope, that truly all is lost.  The cinematography is first rate for a low budget film. Also,the use of sound effects really lend a rich atmosphere to the film and help tell the story, such as the sounds of the sea at rest, waves crashing, the wind whipping, the creaking boat, and the muted sounds of being under water.  I also appreciated the subtle use of music in this movie.  Music is often over-used in many films.

5920378,3,B00EIPEQLW,"First of all, I loved this film. Redford's performance was outstanding. The camera work was also marvelous. In a word, kudos to all who worked on this terrific film. By now, most readers know the plot so I will dispense with summarizing it and only mention what I found devastatingly wrong with this movie. I have been a sailor (sailboats) most of my life. I studied seamanship at the US Naval Academy and have owned four sailing vessels. One never learns everything in the world of sailing, but there are certain things you do learn that went missing in this engrossing film. I cannot believe that there wasn't a technical adviser around when they were filming.  Here's what I spotted, things that even a beginner learns right away:
1) At no time was Redford wearing a life jacket despite the cardinal rule about using them especially when you are out on the water alone. When he goes forward to put up the storm sail he clips himself to the life line but fails to put on the life jacket. This is not believable. No experienced sailor would be so dumb. Did he have a death wish?
2) His navigation system goes out so he digs out a sextant. Backup GPS devices cost $100. Why didn't he have one rather than relying on an instrument that requires logarithm tables and a chronometer to calculate your position?  At best on a tossing sea in a raft your location would be miles from where you think you are using a sextant. .
3) He is calling for help on a VHS radio. A VHS radio has at best a 35-50 miles range. Where was his satellite phone, single side band transceiver or emergency beacon EPRIB? (here's more than you want to know but just in case...""An Emergency Position Indicating Radio Beacon or EPIRB is used to alert search and rescue services in the event of an emergency. It does this by transmitting a coded message on the 406 MHz distress frequency via satellite and earth stations to the nearest rescue co-ordination centre. Some EPIRBs also have built-in GPS which enables the rescue services to accurately locate you to +/- 50 metres. EPIRBs are generally installed on boats and can either be operated automatically after an incident or manually. In most countries they are mandated to be used in all commercial shipping. However, they are also used on yachts and leisure boats."").

Nobody goes sailing around the world without a EPRIB. Period. That the sailor was adrift without a backup navigation and rescue aid save the sextant is another stupidity.

4)  Why didn't he have a proper handle for the bilge pump?  How could he not? when the water started coming in, his automatic electric pump (with float switch) would have alerted him to the impending situation. He wasted time sharpening a stick to use. Yeah, right.
5) He failed to have enough flares on board. Why?
6) There are water purifiers that work on the principle of osmosis. One should have been in the life raft. Another mistake.  Just like the lack of an emergency kit with sunscreen in the raft, etc etc.
7. SPOILER ALERT: How do you decide to die and sink into the abyss and still able to see the surface after a minute or two (film time)? Oh boy, after he sees the light above he swims up as if he'd just entered the water..Notice that as he went down he held his breath reluctant to get it over with. It didn't make sense to me.
8. There were other glaring mistakes but I will leave those to other sharp eyed mariners to call out Redford and his director for their ignorance. There is an old saying that you should only write fiction about things that you have knowledge of, so I would pass the same information to the filmmakers of this seriously flawed but entertaining movie.",1392508800,9,3659,4.551671732522796

5920384,3,B00EIPEQLW,Whoever wrote the script really had no sailing knowledge.  This movie presents a good example of what not to do if you ever find yourself in a situation as put forth in this movie.  Not once is a life jacket observed.  The companionway is left open when it should have been shut.  The Storm jib should have been put on before the storm hit. Shaving rather than fixing the damage to the boat was a laugh. Not having at least 1 waterproof GPS and VHF radio on board is very unlike anybody who has gone to sea.

From a sailors prospective, this film is tripe.  The mistakes made are too numerous to mention, but lets go with a couple obvious ones:
- No EPRIB on an ocean going vessel in the middle of the Indian Ocean...Please
- No Handheld radio, $100
- an ocean sailor with no self steering? So I am to believe that he stayed awake 24/7?
- how did the container crash through the bulkhead in calm seas, especially on the side of the boat- perhaps the bow but the side???
- how did the ""crash"" with the container disconnect the mast radio antenna cable.
- No sailor leaves a hole with such a flimsy patch
- No prepared abandon ship bag...in the open ocean?
- Shaving before a storm...that would have been the time to deploy the storm sail (idiot).  This is textbook.
- what no automatic bilge pump- not even a $15 alarm!!
- in the middle of a storm, this moron doesn't even replace the companionway boards.
- what an ocean going, singled-handed sailor with no proper (inboard) jack lines, instead he cleats to the top lifeline.  This would not have held his body weight while being dragged overboard (moron).
- not once did he put on a life jacket- death wish perhaps?  Not one life jacket in the whole movie.  The life ring on the stern was not even salvaged as the boat was sinking (idiot).
-What kind of idiot, attaches a line to the sinking boat while in a life boat, then goes to sleep.  Lets not forget that the boat has about 6-9000 of ballast.

The list goes on and on, ""Our Man"" was an amateur and far from the resourceful sailor the film portrays.  At his skill level/level of preparedness he had No Business being on the open ocean.

Nobody masters anger management to this extreme! And, how did he cure his far-farsightedness after his reading glasses disappeared? Also, why did he keep looking around in different directions while on the vast ocean as if someone was going to sneak up on him?

For starters the boat didn't strike me as being fit for offshore sailing. The splashboards were ridiculously flimsy, thin plywood things. Every time Redford removed and replaced them I cringed. Second, a man with a bucket trumps a bilge pump. A good pump will move about a half gallon a stroke. A five gallon bucket? Lots more. And about that spare bilge pump handle.

The events are too unbelievable: a collision at sea, the boat rolls over, then his life raft flips. Yeesh! What ruined it for me, though was the ending. The final minute was just too contrived.

This movie kept me at attention waiting to see what would happen to him next.

5920424,4,B00EIPEQLW,"* The problems minimalist films like ""All Is Lost"" run into - happen when they crash head-on into customers who feel justifiably ripped off because their expectations fell way short.

* Despite the high praise this film has received from critics - putting that praise next to negative reviews from actual customers - exposes a reality that can't be ignored.  Something's not right.  And keep in mind, NO viewer invests good time and money in something like ""All Is Lost"" - and roots for it to fail.

* The tip-off that ""All Is Lost"" is NOT a mainstream picture came last year - when I noticed it playing at mostly art-house theaters - and NOT at my backyard multi-plex.  Uh-oh.  ""Indie picture, low-budget, not fast-paced, non-linear structure, probably lacks a strong payoff.""

* So when I finally saw the picture last night as a rental - I was ready.  I got into ""All Is Lost.""  It gave me an idea of what it might be like to die on the ocean.  (By the way, that last sentence was not a spoiler.)  I could not turn this movie off.  I already knew there would be little to zero dialogue - and yet I was engrossed with the idea of an almost entirely visual story whereby I would be forced to experience everything through Robert Redford, the only actor who's in ""All Is Lost.""  I didn't feel I had to know much about his character, where he came from, how he got on the boat, etc.  I understood what the director was trying to do.

* Note that most of the praise from critics has been about Robert Redford's ""near dialogue-free"" performance.  Well, in my view, despite his status as a beloved icon, there are only so many ways Redford can express puzzlement and frustration.  Deprived of an internal monologue, it's hard to emotionally invest in him beyond just wanting him to survive.  If I was stranded on the ocean, I'd be talking to myself ALL THE TIME, with a lot of looney things running through my head.  We get none of that from Redford.

* As a result, I think director J. C. Chandor's decision to move forward with an existential story without dialogue isn't a total success.  His film is technically brilliant, jammed with wondrous sounds and images of a nature at war and peace.

* But the theme of ""All Is Lost"" never seems more ambitious than just showing what it's like to survive nature's fury.  I've already seen that story elsewhere.  In my view, a picture that tries to ask big questions without covering old territory - really requires an internal monologue or a moody atmosphere - or abstract images like what's found in ""2001"" or in ""The Tree of Life"" - films which force us to think beyond survival and more about our small place in this awesome universe.  ""All Is Lost"" was NOT boring - but I did feel a little ""clipped"" at the end, and not in a good way.",1392163200,2,2779,4.455445544554456

I lost interest as soon as I saw how Redford intended to patch the gaping hole in his boat above the waterline. Fiberglass it? Really???

People, this just may save your life one day. Listen up.

In the event of a hull breach stuff something into the hole. A mattress, pillow, tarp, sail or anything semi pliable will do. You don't have to stop the water completely, just slow it down. If the breach is below the water line and cannot be easily reached spread out a sheet, tarp, raincoat or something of that nature and attack the problem from the outside. Water ingress and pressure will suck it into the hole and keep it there. This tactic alone is often enough to get to harbor unless you're sailing the ocean blue.

If this had been done with a sense of urgency the movie would have been about getting into port, Redford on the phone and filling out boat insurance paperwork while getting smashed on margaritas.

To patch a 3' x 3' hole like in the movie remove a panel from the interior of the boat. A door, floor board, engine cover or something and screw that mother to the hull and cover that hole with something solid! Stuff some clothing or canvas in anywhere you can once you get it in place around the edges, add more screws. You really don't even need screws. Gouge a hole through the center of the panel, put a line through it and lash it to something inside on the opposite side of the hull. Trying to patch that wet fiberglass is a total joke. IT DOESN""T HAVE TO BE COMPLETELY WATER TIGHT. A little leak on a solid patch is better than a water tight patch that will be completely blown off by a wave.",1392163200,35,1791,4.334328358208955

No person in their right mind would go to sea in a boat and follow this pathway. At nearly every step our ""lone man"" (Redford) is doing only 75% of anything right on his sail and so he ends up more at-risk with every new scenario. But, I don't suspect that the writers were attempting to appeal to the sailing crowd. Rather, this film is about ""hope"" and the ""human spirit"" in the face of seemingly subtle but catastrophic events that might occur when at sea, alone, in a small boat.

That there is a hollywood ending only speaks to the fact that no one in hollywood would leave an actor with the chops of a Redford, forever adrift and ""All Is Lost"".

5920436,3,B00EIPEQLW,"Days before watching, my interest in All Is Lost immediately sparked after learning that entire movie centered around a lone sailor who becomes stranded at sea with a narrative consisting of minimal dialogue. I had just seen Gravity, another film with a surprisingly minimal acting cast. That movie had earned its place in my heart as one of the boldest and most innovative films I've ever seen before -- so I was excited to see if All Is Lost could push the cinematic envelope as much, if not further.

Mind you, I didn't let all the fondness for Gravity influence my expectations for this movie beyond the storytelling aspect. Although, I did hope for a Cast Away-meets-Gravity at sea type affair.

Unfortunately, the end result is anything but. Whereas the prior two films both have enough variety of action, intensity, and emotion to keep you hooked, the script behind All Is Lost is so bare boned that you begin to lose your grasp on what kind of story is really being told here in the first place.

Robert Redford's role of a weathered sea dog in distress is realistically portrayed, but the character development is nearly nonexistent. Who is this man? Does he have a family that cares about him? What events took place prior in life? Don't get too curious, because you'll never know. All of these lingering questions and more could have been answered by the sailor in the same soliloquy-like manner that is given to us at the film's opening. Other than this, the only other dialogue we hear from him is an attempt at sending out an S.O.S. over a radio and an expletive that is shouted out of sheer frustration. Perhaps it would have been unrealistic if our solitary seafarer was talking to himself about everything from start to finish, but some verbal assessment of the story's events from him here and there might have added to the character's dynamics and personality.

It is what it is. All Is Lost is a minimalist survival movie that may appeal to some patient enough for it, but for the rest of us, one watch will be plenty enough.",1392076800,,2045,4.6565096952908585

And again in the end, he just pissed me off by not waiting until the fire went out. Don't give up until the last light goes out, he didn't wait. And the hand going into the water was just silly. At night, you can't see two feet down. Besides that, I thought it was pretty good. The rest of it seemed believable.",1391990400,,642,4.185483870967742

Then in the credits I find out that they destroyed not one but THREE Cal 39's to make this hot mess of a film. really... REALLY??? did they not even have someone who had actually SAILED a boat along as a technical advisor? I would say its a great comedy because I laughed so hard, but the joke would be on me that I actually spent money to see it. I cant even give it negative stars to fathom my disgust with Redford for making this. Its not worthy of the man who did the Sting, Waldo Pepper and Jeremiah Johnson among others... Just a shame and a complete waste of time. Apparently None of the critics have ever sailed or they are just a bunch of Sycophantic suck-ups to Redford. I could go on but It just makes me want to Vomit so I'll stop now, Just like you should before you buy this movie.",1391990400,5,1044,4.147783251231527

The movie really made me slow down and think about that. There's been a lot of clamor about how a real sailor wouldn't have made such and such mistakes, but I don't know enough about sailing to have an opinion. I will say that my mind was racing a lot of the time wondering what a sailing expert would've done, and I wanted to Google it while I was watching, but I was too interested in the movie to walk away from it.",1391904000,,596,4.146551724137931

If anyone else were in this role it would have been a total bust but Robert Redford at least gave it some credibility.  Almost every sailing related movie that Hollywood puts out has to be something that would make a non-sailor think twice about taking a chance on going sailing.  This sort of thing does happen and people do survive but how about a movie that shows the wonderful side of sailing not just another worst case scenario stinker that would keep a potential sailor ashore?,1391904000,,606,4.541284403669724
5920460,1,B00EIPEQLW,"The movie never establishes why we should care about this man, the only person we see for next 2 hours.  We know nothing about him at the beginning and not much more at the end.  I guess he's supposed to intrigue us as a supremely experienced old-salt whom absolutely nothing phases. In the opening scene he's nudged awake as the ocean gushes into the cabin of his boat.  This barely registers an ""oh my, how inconvenient"", as if this kind of thing happens to sailors alone in the open ocean all the time.  Ok, so we need to suspend belief a little, maybe there's character development?  No, not really.  He faces his all of his repeated setbacks in the same unenthusiastic, resigned Sysophusian way.  He does have the skills (again, assuming you suspend belief that it's a good idea to sleep the night in a life raft tied to a sinking boat) to mount competent responses to all his bad luck, but by the end of the movie you're wondering, why bother?  And indeed, (spoiler alert), at the end, true to the character that's been ""developed"" he does gives up.

he had alot of emotion, I think the audience is the one lacking emotion.

The Story, I love the idea of the story, sailing solo across the Indian Ocean. One of the ugliest bodies of water to have
to cross if you are experienced... a deadly ocean if you are green to sailing like this guy is.
There was NO character developement, obviously the writer and director left that up to the viewer. I can live with that, i was born with a good imagination.

As a coastal cruiser , I have alot of problems with what happened in this movie.
He wakes up. holed by a container freight full of shoes, lol...
He has a well equipped ship. Dislodges the container using his para anchor, retrieves his anchor.
patches the hole, he is calm, relaxed, no big deal....I was so proud of him. good job mate....

All electronics are history, but he gets his vhf going. oops something wrong with antenna, a little climb up the mast ,
no problem easy fix... Oh there is a big storm in the distance.
Maybe we should be prepared for the worst... I think i need a shave. WHAT shaving, really now!
lets wait till things get bad, then go up front and try to hank on a storm jib.
It wasn't easy, but we got it up.... we are running with the devil now....
Tip ""Unless you are racing or just have a need for speed, don't run a lee""
its alot of work and very dangerous, after a few hours alone you will tire and make mistakes.

Does he take the helm and ride it out like the Pilot of the Pinta?
No, what does he do , he goes below takes a nap or something...
gets knocked down, demasted.
lets break out that sea anchor and get it set, he gets knocked down again while on deck.
atleast he is using his harness.
at this point i say. ok we're hove to , bail out the boat and make some coffee, hit that bottle again.
nah he has an idea.
Deploy the life raft and ditch the ship with no gear hoping it will be there in the morning?
luckilly it is...
OMG i could go on for ever here,  it only gets worse.

This movie will be free in no time.. save your money. It will bore most people and annoy most sailing enthusiasts.
I feel the worst for the boat... i hope they had it refitted and it didn't end up in some wrecking yard :(

First off, there's only a sparse few sentences of dialogue and the pacing slow. You have to pay attention. The protagonist is gritty old Redford, and the antagonist is the uncertain Ocean and the hole in his boat. Secondly, its not a conventionally beautiful picture, there's no touching scenes of humpback whales or epic shots of clouds, its a raw look at survival. And thirdly: not much is the audience given: who he is, why he's there, where he's going. The director assumes these are not important points and leaves it to our imagination. As Hemingway's Old Man and the Sea was his final story. 'All is Lost' I hope will not be Redford's last.

His troubles begin when his boat collides with a floating cargo container. From there, everything gets worse. Theres not much back-story, which is fine, and little dialogue, but there is plenty of man vs. nature action and angst. My sailing friends tell me that what is depicted is all very possible. Since we don't know the time period of the action, we can't fault him for not having a survival EPRIB transmitter. Admittedly Redford seems to ignore some basics like wearing a life jacket or inviting companions to join him in his travels. Maybe he's just too macho, maybe he's running away from something or somebody. We don't know and we will never know. In the end, it really doesn't matter.

There has been considerable controversy about the end of the film and all sorts of subtle messaging but in my opinion these are a figment of someone's overly intellectual analysis of the film as it was made.

From start to finish the movie gives the audience unvarnished reality about the perils of long-distance ocean cruising. Scene after scene is un-adorned reality. To me, any speculation that the film maker would suddenly deviate from that consistent pattern and divert the entire track of the film by stapling a 'message' onto the conclusion is pure folly.

This will be timeless; it needs no complex dialog, no special effects, no hot women, no stupid unbelievable plots or stunts...

its a story that could touch any of us, and one that touches on experiences, feelings and emotions we should all recognize.

Our hero is dealt some bad luck, and reacts poorly to it, resulting in a calamity that keeps you on the edge of your seat, holding your breath, and becoming emotionally tied to what's happening on screen.  (And, from a fellow sailor's point of view, makes you take mental inventory of how ready you are for an emergency.  I found myself thinking of all the things he should be throwing in the life raft...)  From start to finish, with no dialog, no supporting actors, very little music, and no computer generated graphics, the movie was riveting.

I appreciated his 'confession' in the voice over at the beginning of the movie - how true that we often don't gain insight until we are in a place that demands of us a 'life review.'

You bend on the storm jib  before the storm hits, not after.  Why did the automatic bilge pump fail. Well at least he had the foresight to bring along fiberglass mat and epoxy to repair the hole.

In hindsight, I'm glad I only rented it.  My first impression of this movie was excitement that I was watching what others have described as an ""elite"" actor - I'm a Boomer, so I'm familiar with RR's previous work.  I am not a seaman or sailor by any means, but I must admit that I drifted to sleep at least once during the movie due to the lack of dialogue and the onslaught of such bad luck for the character.  To me, good acting consists of not only hand gestures, facial expressions, and raw emotion, but also heart felt dialogue.  Without dialogue, something just seems to be missing.  Isn't the idea to convince the audience of realism?  An actual person in a like situation would not have been so silent.  It was almost as if the story was being told from a mute's perspective.  Anyway, as most of the experienced sailors here have expressed in their reviews, this movie was littered with ""..what not to do's"" while out alone on the high seas, when I would have preferred to be educated in true survival skills.  Otherwise, what's the point?  Would not recommend.",1391385600,,1235,4.518018018018018

Redford wakes up to find his boat has been holed by a drifting container.  He breaks out his fiberglass repair kit and makes a reasonably decent patch - but that's about the only smart thing he does.  He stores his self-inflating life raft down below in the cabin (any sailor with half a brain would keep it in one of the cockpit lazarettes).  Same with his sea anchor.  When he needs to do some celestial navigation, he has to pull his sextant out from under a settee.  And guess what - it's still in its delivery/shipping carton!  And he doesn't seem to know how to use it to bring the sun down to the horizon - he just holds it up to his eye, and gets a three-point fix without having to work a star chart.  And when do you rig a storm jib?  When you first think you might need it - not when you're in the middle of a terrible storm.  After a while, we started thinking maybe this was supposed to be a silent comedy?  Don't waste  your time with this one.",1391385600,4,1216,4.171673819742489

An old man goes sailing alone on the high seas in a poorly equipped boat.

Man seems unconcerned. Leisurely goes about repairing hole with a patch. Brings wet electronics outside on deck.
Man makes no plans or preparations for his safety or rescue.

Robert Redford does a fantastic job of depicting a character who is skilled, experienced, and capable when it comes to handling himself and what is controllable in his environment.  You are able to watch his methodical approach, feel his accomplishment at a job done, frustration, anger, and perhaps fear.  Just his smallest action communicates a solution to a problem.

More than that this movie is able to speak to the few people who are left who are willing to accept the uncontrollable and depend on their own ingenuity and spirit to overcome any obstacle.

I am more interested in knowing how the thing was filmed than having to watch it as some kind of tense drama. (Full discloser: J.C. Chandor's 'Margin Call' is one of my favorite movies of all time.)

SPOILER ALERT! The end: Another disagreement. My husband thinks the white light was the death vision at last breath when all was truly lost.

That was not the case here, it is a believable journey of some bad luck, and a resourceful sailor all set against the backdrop of a storm in the middle of the ocean.  As time unfolds Redford's world continues to shrink till he is on a small life raft making decisions that seem simple but have so many future situations tied to them.  The ending is believable and satisfying considering the wild path he has had to endure to reach that point.  I enjoyed the movie, and the performance of an almost silent Robert Redford as his calculated steps extend his life and the movie.

This is the only movie I've ever seen in which I was actively rooting for the main character to die, just so it could end. In a little less than an hour and 46 minutes (mercifully, some of that hour and 46 minutes is allotted to credits), Robert Redford manages not to say a word and not to show any emotion. Even in situations which would clearly call for some type of outburst or reaction, there is none. At the very beginning of the movie, his boat strikes refuge in the sea and develops a fairly sizable hole in the side. Redford shows not the least bit of surprise, anger, fear, sense of urgency, or any other human emotion. Later, when he discovers his radio doesn't work (which is because he didn't even bother trying to keep it out of the water at the beginning of the movie - sheer stupidity), he again shows no emotion and utters not a word.

I'm being generous in even referring to this waste of time as a movie. There is no acting, no expression, no dialog, no drama, no comedy, or anything else in any way, shape, or form that would characterize this disaster as a movie. I'm disgusted with Amazon for even advertising this garbage as a movie. I think I should be entitled to my money back.

If I could give this 0 stars or perhaps negative stars, I would. The only good thing I can find to say at all is that I didn't waste even more money seeing this at a movie theater.",1391126400,4,1524,4.306620209059234

5920593,5,B00EIPEQLW,"How can a movie with one character and probably less than 30 words total throughout the movie pack such an emotional punch?  Well, when that one man is portrayed by Robert Redford, words aren't really necessary.  I was immediately immersed in the life of the nameless man who is traversing the ocean alone.  He is awakened one morning as his boat is rammed by a floating cargo container which leaves a huge hole in the side of his craft.  He quickly makes repairs and continues on his way but fate has worse in store.  He barely has time to clean up the damage from the leak before a huge storm hits.  The rest of the movie takes place over the eight harrowing days that he is alone and adrift and must come to terms with what he has made of his life.  Rarely has a movie affected me so deeply that I sit and shout at the screen while watching but I was doing that with this movie. You keenly feel the hope as he sights a ship and the disappointment when his flares goes unnoticed.  All of the emotion is conveyed through the nuances of a facial expression or the slump of shoulders.  Redford inhabits this man perfectly.  In my humble opinion, he should receive all the awards for this performance which was done without grand special effects or mounds of crafty dialouge.  I highly recommend this film.  It's hard to watch at times but you will definitely come away with a deeper sense of gratitude for the little things we all take for granted.",1391040000,,1447,4.398496240601504

Not a video game for the big screen.

My guess is that a lot of people who are giving this movie bad reviews are younger than 40 or so who aren't used to this kind of entertainment. Just a guess.

I found that once I got into the flow of it, I really didn't need the dialog. Redford does an excellent job. He's a true actor.

For other who are critical of his character, give the guy a break. We don't know his background. He could be a retired businessman who just took up sailing. We don't know. Plus the guy is, obviously, older. I don't think that is the point of the movie (to second guess decisions made by him).",1390953600,,1019,4.324607329842932

And even though I don't know much about sailing other than experiencing sailing with my husband and friends for fun, and very close to the shore, it was fascinating to watch how his character was getting in and out of trouble while fighting the rough sea.

5920666,4,B00EIPEQLW,"This film, starring Robert Redford, in a role that involves virtually no dialogue, is fascinating because of many qualities, not the least of which is its understated sound design.

Redford is the perfect retiree, sailing a good-sized sloop across the Indian Ocean single-handed, when we catch  up to him 1700 nautical miles from the Sumatra Strait. From then on, what appears to be an idyllic late-in-life adventure goes from disaster to disaster, each one building believably on the last, until his tight yacht is a splintered mess sinking into the sea while he watches from the flimsy confines of a rubber life raft... and the fun is just beginning.

I don't want to give too much away, but the way each of the catastrophic events is portrayed (matter-of-fact, understated, yet obviously leading to chaos) is deeply persuasive. The viewer is drawn into the danger precisely because of its understated, low-key presentation.

The initial collision with a shipping container that's been washed overboard from a cargo ship is quiet, subdued. The water washing in through the resulting hole is splashing gently, not crashing in like a tidal wave - and as we watch, we become aware of the subtleties of the accident: the navigation computer is shorted out, as is the radio. The engine electrics are flooded, so the engine and pumps are out of commission. Still, the low-key presentation persists. So low-key, in fact, that it reminded me of another similar film of a few years ago: ""Open Water"".

A brutal storm at night is terrifying in its intensity, but even its natural explosion of waves and water seems strangely quiet, despite the violence being wreaked on the sailboat.

The ordered world of his sailboat gives way to the chaos of nature in a slow progression that reminds all of us that our thin facade of predictability is never far away from being dashed to pieces by natural forces. As these natural forces gnaw away at Redford's ancient mariner, his world is reduced in size and complexity until the awful simplicity of the final d&eacute;nouement takes the last shreds away.

I'm a part-time, not particularly skillful, sailor - and I've been on many boats of the size and configuration of the one that figures in the first half of this film. The cinematography, the manipulation of small spaces, and their contrast with the wide-open sky of the Indian Ocean made me acutely aware of the limitations of our constructs when facing the oblivious wrath of nature.

In fact, the film left me agitated and uneasy. I felt it had conjured up all the fears of being lost on the open ocean that we, as sailors, must tamp down every time we venture into heavy weather.

If you're a sailor, see the film. If you're not, see the film anyway. It's worth the shiver to your timbers.",1390867200,12,2780,4.823529411764706
5920667,5,B00EIPEQLW,"I can understand someone who doesn't know much about sailing, not liking this movie, you may get stuck in nuances such as why he was shaving, etc. Though I'd still find is very good suspense movie. However if you know even a little about sailing, then this is an awesome movie. Robert Redford delivers a great performance, considering there is almost no dialog in the movie. I watched this movie a day after I watched Captain Phillips (Tom Hanks) which was a somewhat of a disappointment, more of a propaganda piece, even though it was based on a true story. This was on the other hand, not based on a real life events but on a quite possible real life story and showed how a calm manner and experienced sailor would handle disastrous situations.

The story could have been amazing if they really peeled away the layers of the character as his situation progressively got worse.  Instead we have a single scene where he loses it for maybe 30 seconds - beyond that he's pretty unemotional, leaving the story pretty lacking.  Instead of this emotional development, we have a movie where a boat gets damaged, a series of events occur, the main character to plods along through all of it with very little hint of any gravity.

It is certainly not an adventure story and falls even shorter as a tale of survival. Without giving away the ending he appears to give up hope after about a week - not exactly an ispiring example of character or seamanship.

He has tenacity and endurance. So does the actor (Redford)! Almost NO CGI, almost all the stunts performed himself, No gimmicks, just theater for film in its simplest form. A masterful craftsman (Redford) uses his skills as an actor to tell this compelling dramatic story through his body, his actions, expressions, movements, gestures, without hardly any dialogue! Some viewers who require spoon feeding through Hollywoods' more typical gimmicks, tools, dialogues, fast edits, bombs, car chases, etc., are audiences less likely to immerse themselves in this beautiful tale of high seas trauma.

People would have been shouting at the screen like it was some B-Movie Horror movie....scene after scene it was nothing but scenarious that NO SAILOR WOULD EVER DO!!  I mean the scene where the boat flipped and he is tossed overboard BUT was able to swim back into the cockpit AS THE BOAT IS FLIPPING BACK OVER was an awesome shot (and I'd love know how they did that) but OH MY GOD!  That was UNBELIEVABLE in the literal sense!  I just don't know whether Robert Redford was lead astray by the director or what he was thinking getting involved in this movie.

5920705,4,B00EIPEQLW,"Spoiler Alert: I mention the story's ending in these comments.  I'll save that for the end.

As a sailor, and life-long reader of Lost At Sea stories, I loved seeing a well-done movie version of this classic subject.  I also loved the somewhat slow pacing of the cinematography - compared to the frenetic pacing of most American movies that are still accelerating the slapdash cut and paste approach that seemed to start with the arrival of MTV, the pace was glacial.  Compared to how the movie could/should have been shot, it was still pretty choppy.  A wider angle, and more lingering views would have been welcome (to this watcher).

Even recognizing that long-distance sailing passages can take on what looks like a pretty methodical and sedate pace for long stretches, the most striking aspect of the Redford's portrayal was his character's (The Sailor) strangely passive affect.  Having been awoken by ""equipment failure"" (a rogue container bashing into your boat on the open sea, which starts the movie, would qualify) at sea, it was extremely strange to see The Sailor simply amble about the cabin and deck when he was woken up by the precursor to disaster.  Throughout, the cinematography seems to strive for a slow pace, which is admirable (see pacing comments above).  On the other hand, such pacing should be cinematographic, not an aspect of the character.  Unless, of course, the story is meant to show how a three-toed sloth would not be a compelling candidate to voyage single-handed on the open sea.

Some will quibble about anomalies, ""a real sailor would never have done x, y, and z"".  I'll leave that to the indignant among the audience.  However.  As a plot device, I once heard something to the effect that in a stage play, you should not have a gun sitting on a side table among the props unless it's going to appear in the action.  In that light, The Sailor seemed to be very cavalier about setting an open knife down on the floor of an inflatable life raft with no perceivable consequence then or later.

Before the spoiler: this movie is definitely worth watching.  For sailors, just because.  For those who care about sailors, it's a small window into one part of what makes a sailor love what they do.  For everyone else, it's just a beautiful movie with a compelling character who is thrown into a solitary struggle with huge forces.

Finally, here is the reason for the spoiler alert.  Not a praying man here, but I hoped throughout the movie that All Is Lost would avoid the simpering fate of most movies - the Wrap-It-All-Up Happy Ending.  All Is Lost tried to leave us with a vaguely ambiguous ending (is the savior real?  a hallucination?), but just couldn't resist a Sistine Chapel hand appearing in the water as The Sailor rises from the depths of his almost-surrender.  The surrender would have carried through the strange passivity that The Sailor seemed to exhibit throughout the movie, and maintained that integrity of the story.",1390435200,6,2969,4.799212598425197

Sure 2-3 things can happen but almost every scenario that could occur does, and sometimes more than once. I don't think its too realistic (especially when not one, but two cargo ships nearly run him over and don't see him) and the ending was very anticlimactic. Overall its not all that good but Redford has a few moments when he shows his acting skills. Sort of bummed I spent $5 to rent it and when the movie ended I was left standing here going huh?

The only issue I have with this movie is how the character used his 8 days alone at sea.  Again, a great idea for a movie.  But the movie tells you from the beginning, it all started 8 days earlier...The character begins having very bad luck while he is on his boat...Two days go by.  He then takes another full day to load the raft and begin his drifting. Total of three days so far.  The next 5 days, we see that the character eats all the food he has, while floating around for the last 4-5 days. During this time, he gives up hope and decides to call it quits. Why?

Although the movie was very well acted. I will agree Robert did some of his best work in this movie. I have a big problem with the time continuity laid out in this film.  Come on...I want to believe most people would not give up hope in five days. Especially someone that can afford to travel the world alone on their own boat. The Cast Away movie Tom Hanks was in, created a more believable time line than this movie.

Although I sound like I did not care for this film, I did like it.  It is worth seeing.  Although... it's not worth an Oscar nod...Blame the writers, not Mr. Redford.",1390262400,,1379,4.074074074074074

Some reviewers have mentioned things that bother them. ""Our man"" shaving? It's a moment that defines the character, agree with the choice or not. The giant container ships not seeing flares? Well, they don't. This is a film where, for an apparently competent seaman, things go wrong. Slowly at first, then with increasing frequency, ""our man"" just doesn't get a break. A man who has controlled his life, loses that ability.
Some people will want more excitement. But this is, on the whole, a very realistic, very personal, ""disaster movie.""",1390262400,167,773,4.953846153846154

Unlike Castaway, Redford never reaches land. His sailboat sinks and he is totally FUBAR'd in a lifeboat at sea. Also unlike castaway, Redford holds the screen far better than Tom Hanks. There is no one to contend with except himself. Redford plays a headstrong character with an unwavering disposition. This person could very well be taken from the pages of a Hemingway novel as his actions and general demeanor demonstrate his incredible smarts and hardiness. Much love goes to the director and screenwriter, who keep the internal struggle to a minimum. No extended crying streaks, psycho hallucinations, or volley ball romance to get bogged down by. Instead, All Is Lost is a straightforward flick. One old man lost at sea, that's it. Recommended viewing for all!",1389916800,10,916,4.993464052287582
5920713,5,B00EIPEQLW,"The great acting teacher Sanford Meisner once said, ""Acting is Living in Imaginary Circumstances."" Those words have always rung true to me, and a living example can be found in the underrated film, ""All Is Lost."" Robert Redford the actor, known only as ""Our Man"" in this film, is living in imaginary circumstances---alone at sea, in his leaking boat, fighting against the dying of the light for survival. He does so powerfully and the movie holds your attention from beginning to end.

The movie ""All is Lost"" has been grossly overlooked by film critics circles, the Academy, and many of its viewers, as a worthless waste of time, mostly because there's only one actor in the entire film, and because there's hardly any dialogue. I find those arguments to be ridiculous, as the director is only trying to be true to a simple yet powerful story-a man who is falling victim to his overconfidence is desperately trying to stay alive. Put yourself in the situation, if this were real. Would you be speaking a lot if you were alone at sea? Would you be chatting with other people? Of Course Not. And therefore, the director doesn't portray anything like that.

One element of a disaster film that makes them interesting and suspenseful, is that the director has to make a choice of whether to take us out of the action or not. Through flashbacks, or something like that, to remove us from the scene of terror for a moment. Chandor wisely never takes us out of the moments, beat by beat, as Our Man has to make important and life-threatening decisions to keep going, or give up.

I recommend this film to people that love movies about the sea. I recommend this film to any actor or actress who needs a lesson in learning how to ""live in imaginary circumstances."" I recommend this film to anyone who loves independently-spirited, good movies.",1389830400,23,1835,4.710280373831775
5920714,4,B00EIPEQLW,"Robert Redford sails solo, somewhere in the Indian Ocean, many miles off Sumatra, and has his yacht hit a drifting freight container. Before the boat sinks, after a day or two, the man sets up his lifeboat, a rubber dinghy, and transfers some supplies. He stays above water with a shrinking base of tools and necessities, through storms and nights, with shrinking hope.
The most awesome moments of this not very original, but impressive, minimalist adventure film are two encounters with passing container ship giants. Both rush past like ghost ships, no living soul in sight, just a mountain of steel boxes.
Also very impressive is the underwater filming. We watch Redford's boat from below, against the sunny sky, surrounded by schools of fish, and more and more by larger fish, and then sharks.
Redford is an ideal casting for the nearly speechless only character of the story. At the opening, we hear him speak a last message in the off, ending with: all is lost. It sounds as if he dictated it, but that is later shown as a wrong impression. The man has written a message in a bottle...
During the story, we hear him mumbling a little now and then, but the only word that he pronounces loudly and clearly is one that I can't quote here. I would have said that much more often. My manners leave much to be desired. People with good manners, do they have better survival prospects? Just kidding.

Zero dialogue. Nobody to talk to anyway. How would Conrad have told this story?
Some reviewers say that the film makers know nothing about the ocean or sailing. I wouldn't claim to know better. Some of Redford's actions did appear to be hard to understand. I wouldn't know if he acted in an incompetent way, or if he is just overwhelmed und helpless. Someone said that the man should never have been alone where he was. That seems to me an obvious comment.",1389398400,5,1856,4.624242424242424
5920715,1,B00EIPEQLW,Don't see this movie.  There is NO dialogue in this movie.  Think castaway but not nearly as good as Hanks.,1389225600,6,107,4.3
5920716,5,B00EIPEQLW,"I really liked this movie. Maybe it is important that I know zippo about sailing since there are several reviews that zap it for mistakes that would make a sailor throw his hands in the air. The poor reviews are more about the technical aspects of sailing and problems at sea than the cinematography but if you don't know a thing about sailing you are probably good to go. The extent of my knowledge about sailing is reading the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Aubrey-Maturin-novels/dp/B006C3Q6GG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Aubrey/Maturin novels</a>&nbsp;a few dozen times. Even so, there were a few things that exasperated me about Our Man's reaction to his situation.

But this isn't a movie about a good sailor doing everything exactly the right way only to be foiled by the harsh sea mistress and fate. Or an awful sailor doing everything wrong. That is what makes it work. Frankly, it is very tiresome to have unbelievable bad luck as plot devices and Hollywood is rampant with that crap.

I enjoyed the way Redford remained unflappable and the way the movie did not have him audibly ""think"" to keep the viewer on a narrow and inescapable path of ""this is what is happening and this is what the character thinks you idiot viewer"".",1389139200,8,1278,5.199029126213592
5920717,5,B00EIPEQLW,"All is Lost shouldn't have worked as a film. All is Lost doesn't have complex story, no back story for our lone character, no limited dialogue, no interaction with any other characters, and without any battles or explosions in the film yet the film does work. All is Lost has nothing except a lone man trying to survive being stranded alone in the vast Indian Ocean. Our man doesn't have a volleyball named Wilson, a Tiger, or fellow astronaut for companionship. All our man has is himself, and his will to survive until all is lost, and yet All is Lost works simply because of veteran actor Robert Redford who gives a magnificent performance in his best film, and acting performance in over a decade.

""I'm sorry. I know that means little at this point, but I am. I tried. I think you would all agree that I tried. To be true, to be strong, to be kind, to love, to be right, but I wasn't.""

That is how All is Lost opens with part of the longest dialogue in the film when a moving voice over by an unknown man begins. The man who sounds like he has been through an ordeal, and has fought hard to survive has finally given up, and is saying goodbye, and then the film cuts to eight days earlier where we see a long man sleeping peacefully in a cabin of his boat the Virginia Jean. The man is awoken when a load crash is heard and water begins to pour into the cabin. Rushing out onto the deck he finds that a floating shipping container has crashed into his boat gashing a whole into the side of the boat. Our man quickly works to get the shipping container dislodged from the boat as the cabin is continued to be flooded with water. We watch as the man efficiently gets the container dislodged, repairs the side of the boat, and pumps the water out of the cabin.

Unfortunately for our men the electronics on the Virginia Jean are now not working or broken, and his dying radios SOS cry for help aren't heard leaving the man stranded and alone. We watch the triumphs, and failures as the man fights for survival alone on the Indian Ocean. We see all this without only about three words of dialogue, which makes it even more emotional when our man realizes he made a simple yet costly mistake yelling a four letter word into the sky. I don't think I've heard a cursed word used so effectively or with such emotion before in a film. The man's lone journey culminates in a beautiful and moving climax that is inconclusive leaving us to form our own opinion. I did struggled with giving away the ending, but just want to say that the conclusion or lack thereof gives deeper meaning to the opening dialogue as we all try to be true to ourselves and others, to love unconditionally, and to be kind yet have failed in some degree. I know I have failed many times in my life yet it is the journey, and decisions that define us as well desire to let the people we know and love that we did our best in life.

Throughout Robert Redford's over five decade acting career the seventy seven year old Redford has given us many memorable and great acting performances Johnny Hooker in The Sting, The Sundance Kid in Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, Roy Hobbs in The Natural, Bob Woodward in All the President's Men, and Nathan D. Muir in Spy Game, with a future performance in the upcoming Captain America: The Winter Soldier yet his role in All is Lost is different, and more complex than his other roles as the experienced actor has no other actors rely on, and very little dialogue. Instead Redford must act only with his eyes, facial expressions and body language, and Redford achieves that in All is Lost. Redford as lost man wonderfully displays the emotions of a lost man at sea from his frustration, hopefulness/hopelessness, triumphs, and acceptance. I believe few actors could as an effective performance as Robert Redford does with so little to work with.

All is Lost isn't for everyone, and some might not appreciate what they are viewing, but All is Lost shouldn't be missed. Not director J. C. Chandor simple yet meaningful journey of survival, not the beautiful cinematography, Not the sedated yet compelling score, and certainly not Robert Redford's silent yet compelling performance that should at very least garner him an Oscar nomination.",1389052800,4,4246,4.516254876462939

Left with nothing more then what is on the ship and ruined equipment the sailor (Redford) must do everything he can to stay alive until he can be rescued. Going in I expected this to go one of two ways, either super boring or super intense. After seeing Gravity and how tense that was I was hoping for more of the same. I was let down by that expectation. I will however say that this movie really shows what a great actor Robert Redford is. Movies like Cast Away and Gravity while mainly about someone being alone did have other people in it and had a back story for the person. This one ONLY had Robert Redford and it starts as soon as he hits the tanker. No back story or anything about the character. There is also a total of about 20 words in the movie. All that said by the end you are really rooting for the guy and hope someone finds him. That is the sign of a great actor, being able to make people root for you and feel emotions without words. As good as he was in this though the movie isn't for everyone. It really is just watching someone trying to stay alive in the ocean alone for over an hour and a half. If you think you would be interested then go for it. If you don't then you may be too bored to care about what is going on. Overall, a pretty good movie but it isn't for everyone.

Redford's boat is hit by a floating sealand which allows in water to disable his emergency equipment, storms ravage the rest of his boat and he floats around in a life raft attempting to make contact with the same vessels that carry said sealands.

Redford doesn't say much. I wish he had talked to himself more. I was bored as I watched the feigned struggle, waiting for the inevitable sharks and near rescue attempts.

In this film the sealand shipping lane represents the inevitable passage of taking souls to safety. Redford, struck by the ""hand of God"" i.e. sealand prepares his soul for the final journey until the god Maersk takes him home. The film highlights the theological idea that God gives and takes away and he has a purpose, which is delivery of overpriced sneakers to the US made in Asian sweatshops at all costs, so don't get in his way. I have no idea why people would like this film.

The film would have been worth watching if they made Redford the owner of the ""evil"" sneaker company and hence ironically gets disabled by his own greedy hand. This would have been easy to do with a flashback, intro, or even a prop. Nope.

When you see a storm approaching, you don't go below and shave and then wait until you're in the teeth of it to put up the storm sail.  There was too much of that in this movie.

After seeing it, I thought the title of the movie was the attitude of ""Our Man"", Redford's character.  He had lost everything he valued and there was no reason for living anymore, but he couldn't take his own life.  So he set sail, planning on never returning.  His letter was his final farewell that he had written before he went to sea.  His actions, or lack thereof, would have made sense then.

But that wasn't the case.

I've tried to find any hint of Chandor, the writer, or Redford, or anyone associated with the movie, that Our Man had given up all hope and was going through the motions until death was inevitable.

Redford plays an incompetent fool who should never have sailed out of sight of land because he has no seamanship skills whatsoever. Nevertheless, we find him in the middle of the Indian Ocean where his sailboat is inexplicably T-boned in a flat calm by a half sunken cargo container. After performing some incomprehensible manoeuvres which almost complete the sinking of the vessel, he lethargically performs a pathetically awful job of patching the hole. We are then expected to believe he can determine his position with one fix using a sextant which doesn't need to be pointed towards the sun and effortlessly chop through stainless steel rigging with a pair of pliers.

5920724,5,B00EIPEQLW,"Another film about the human spirits ability to persevere we do not need, yet here we are again.

In the straights on Sumatra off the coast of Indonesia a lone sailor (Robert Redford) awakens to find his sailboat's cabin filling fast with sea water. A massive whole has been torn through the side after a freak, overnight collision with a rogue shipping container. In the vastness of the Indian Ocean the spectacular odds of this collisions happening seem staggering, and yet this is only the beginning of the misadventure.

After patching up the side of the boat, even despite the total loss of all modern navigation equipment, the danger seems to cease. For a moment it seems like all thats left is for the lone sailor to venture into the nearest port and seek repairs, but of course we know this is not the story.

It is as if the hulking metal mass has delivered upon the lone sailor a divine wrath from which there is no escape. When we see the container, a faceless representation of some mega conglomerate, smashed through the side of the delicate sailboat, sweatshop-produced shoes spilling out into the ocean, the irony is overwhelming. The very world the lone sailor has set out to get away from has tracked him down.

Before we start the film, just from the title alone, we know what the outcome will be, yet despite the unoriginal plot and standard shipwreck story conventions, the film succeeds. Fantastically succeeds.

Almost completely devoid of dialogue, Robert Redford exudes a stolid, matter-of-fact persona in the face of catastrophe. He toils steadily, remaining steadfast in his manner. It is exhausting just watching him labor endlessly and even though he is performing, this performance cannot really be considered acting. Simply going through the motions of this role is enough to exude awe, especially when he is being thrown around wildly by the untamed, open ocean; the work that it must have taken to play this role is obvious and seems to strip away acting practices; what we really see is a man just trying not to die.

5920725,5,B00EIPEQLW,"In one of the best films of 2013, Robert Redford gives a career best performance in this stripped-bare survival film. A poetic, moving and one of a kind movie that every cinephile should see.",1387584000,2,191,4.647058823529412
5920726,5,B00EIPEQLW,"In ""All is Lost,"" moviegoers observe an unnamed sailor navigating his way solo through the Indian Ocean.  Robert Redford turns in a bravura performance as a weathered but fit yachtsman who, in normal circumstances, would find this challenging voyage scenic and exhilarating.  However, a series of unfortunate events force him to take desperate measures if he is to have any chance of survival.

J. C. Chandor deserves high praise for writing and directing this beautifully photographed and cinematically arresting film.  Although Redford speaks few lines, words are not necessary to express what he is experiencing.  His facial expressions, body language, and intensity are mesmerizing.  Will his impressive nautical skills, ingenuity, resourcefulness, and grace under pressure enable him to pull off a miracle?  Will he find a way to repair his damaged electrical and communication systems; be able to hail a passing boat; and/or manage to make his limited supply of water and rations last?  What kind of man was he before he undertook this odyssey?  Was he running away from something or someone?  We will never know.

""All is Lost"" is eloquent, not just as a tale of daring and fortitude, but also as an allegory for life.  We are guaranteed nothing at birth.  Will we be healthy, have a loving partner and devoted children, and earn a living doing something that we love?  Or will we endure illness, financial setbacks, rejection, and loneliness?  When we are brought low by circumstances, we can choose to face our struggles courageously or surrender to despair.  If we decide to persist and fight, like the aforementioned sailor, at least we know that we tried.

Robert Redford is quoted as saying, ""To me, it was always the climb up the hill.  Not standing at the top.""

This is one movie that will stay with you.",1387152000,24,1820,4.98671096345515
5920727,4,B00EIPEQLW,Great acting by Redford of course but a terrible abrupt ending!  The film seemed so real.  It held you to the end with hardly any words spoken. It moved along but all of a sudden it looked like redford was not going to survive even thou a ship was near and starting to rescue him but then it ended so sudden.  With the slow pace of this movie at least it could have brought out the end more.  That was disappointing about this flick.  Highly recommend this one anyway! An Oscar nomination for Redford for sure!!!,1386201600,2,512,4.291666666666667
5920728,4,B00EIPEQLW,"It's important to begin by saying that this is not the kind of film that everyone will love, it absolutely is the kind of film that will leave most people either surprised and blown away or annoyed that they spent almost 2 hours watching. The movie is more of an experience than a story, so you don't get to know Redford's unnamed character or anything about it, rather you get to experience with him the struggles he goes through to survive. Think of the 2nd act of Castaway, if you took away the first act of that film you wouldn't have connected with Tom Hank's character and would be left watching a man trying to survive. That's exactly what this film does, and it does a great job of not just giving the audience something to watch but really pulls you in. This is in no small part due to the director and Redford's strong performance.

If you can handle watching a movie that is more about the experience, and not about a story, this might be a film you'll love. Others might find it boring, as the character doesn't say anything for the most part and at times seems to be doing mundane things. It's this side of the experience that might make people see All is Lost as a slow and pointless film. Personally, I enjoyed it quite a bit, but I know a number of my friends would not like it, and I'm not surprised by it at all.",1385769600,3,1330,4.277777777777778
5920729,3,B00EIPEQLW,"My husband & I were so looking forward to seeing this film, as survival/adventure stories have always interested us.  But this film fell flat on so many levels, we were really disappointed - to the point I can't help wondering if some of these ""glowing"" reviews are planted.  From the outset, the character does stupid things, in a lethargic and disinterested manner.  I won't go into each and every scene, but who stops to shave when their boat is sinking?  Who curls up to sleep on the one and only night they KNOW their boat will be in the shipping channel??  Also, we knew going in that there was said to be very little dialogue in this film - I had no problem with that concept.  But to have the character never so much as groan, talk in disgust under his breath, write in a journal, offer up a prayer, or any other normal human behavior, is taking ""art"" to a ridiculous point in my opinion.  Far from being on the edge of my seat, I found myself not at all caring about what became of this man.  There are several scenes where he does things and you can't even tell what it is he's supposed to be doing (this is where some journaling later could have helped immensely).  If this movie had been done better I could've easily sat through it for 3 or 4 hours.  As it was, I was glad it was under 2 hours and I have to say, the unusual ending was probably the best part.  We saw it in a theatre with only 2 other couples in attendance and based on the comments afterward, it was a split decision on how to interpret the ending.",1385164800,12,1529,4.219931271477663
5920730,5,B00EIPEQLW,"I like that there is a lot of praise for this film, which I saw a few hours ago. It's still unfolding for me as I think about it, like another lost-at-sea film Open Water did a few years ago. In that one, the protagonists were hapless victims of absurdity they couldn't anticipate. In this one, it feels as though Our Man has long been preparing for a kind of existential showdown, his own requirement for redemption perhaps. The plausibility of the nautical aspects some have complained about isn't of particular interest to me. It is the conspiring sky and sea, and immutable Earthly forces grown to behemoth proportions that are central to the allegorical narrative. Our man is tossed and forgotten in their pitiless swirl, his grip on what identifies him is soon broken. In moments he is aglow as if lit from a watchful heaven, meanwhile sharks circle below. In its foreboding and uncertainty, there is poetry and beauty in the film. Highly recommended.",1384732800,58,957,4.771084337349397
5920731,4,B00EIPEQLW,"A profound work of art, capturing the essence of extreme misfortune and brutal survival, ""All Is Lost"" is a magnificent work. Robert Redford, who has starred in a number of high and low-end budget films throughout his extensive career, really put out his a-game in this ""Old Man and the Sea"" type of story. I felt as if I was reading a good book, anticipating the horrors of being lost at sea all alone and at the same time hopefully expectant that Redford would survive such a terrible situation.

I am not a sailor nor will I ever be, but through the attention to detail and great directing by J.C. Chandor (Margin Call) I was able to feel like I was on the boat with Redford, experiencing and feeling the same thing he experienced and felt. I was drawn from my seat out into the sea and I even felt the impending doom that all was lost.

However, partly due to lack of dialogue and the slow pace of the story, it was easy to see why many people from the general public would dislike this film. Besides two brutal storms and the foreseen shark infestation below Redford's raft, the story was slow and evenly paced, giving the viewer the opportunity to live in Redford's shoes and feel what he was feeling. You need to take the film for what it is worth - a simple and minimalist narrative about a man lost at sea. With that in mind, you can really pull a lot out of the story and enjoy it just as much as if you were reading a short book.

5920732,4,B00EIPEQLW,"Theatrical review.  There may be spoilers.

Working with only one actor and his own 32 page script, director J. C. Chandor (""Margin Call"") creates an unusually effective version of man vs. sea.  Our man (no name used) is Robert Redford and other than an opening letter to family that he narrates, he only has 2 lines that I can recall.  One is a frustrated F-bomb and the other is ""Help!""  Even with no dialog this may be Redford's best performance in a long career of good ones.

We have no explanation for why our man is sailing alone in the Indian Ocean, but we soon learn that he knows what he's doing.  Waking one morning to sea water lapping up against him, he finds a huge cargo container full of sneakers had run into the side of his boat.  Enough water had entered the boat that his electrical system and radio were severely damaged.  Using some ingenuity he manages to patch up the hull and head to the nearest shipping lane, hopefully to be rescued.  A violent storm makes a difficult situation nearly hopeless, but our man preservers.

Great actors are able to use more than well written dialog to deliver the goods.  To watch Redford work here should erase any doubts that he is on an elite list.  Even mundane scenes like eating a can of beans or taking inventory of his supplies will draw the viewer into his predicament.  Perhaps even more remarkable is that Redford at 77, or thereabouts, performed all the physical activity and stunts in this movie.  The only stunt men I saw in the credits were safety divers.

If I have any issues with the film, it has to do with how remarkably close a couple cargo ships came to our man's life raft without seeing him.  Even with him waving his arms frantically and shooting off flairs, the ships just keep on sailing.  Seemed unlikely.  Some might quibble with the ending but for me it was just perfect.",1384387200,70,1859,4.495522388059701
5920733,5,B00EIPEQLW,"Directed by J.C. Chandor (Margin Call), All is Lost stars Robert Redford (his character's name is never revealed) as the lone occupant of a lost-at-sea vessel, named the ""Virginia Jean.""  After awakening to find water pouring into his boat, he quickly realizes that it has crashed into a large storage container, which has been aimlessly floating in the Indian Ocean.  The incoming water damages his radio and navigation system, cutting off his communication capabilities.  Although he manages to patch the hole to his hull and use celestial navigation to pinpoint his location, he is still ill-equipped to contend with the impact of being on the ocean during a major storm.  With his boat severely damaged and lacking supplies, he is forced to coup with the growing possibility that he will be unable able to survive.

With the critical acclaim of 2012's Life of Pi, which earned director Ang Lee an Academy Award win, someone was bound to recycle the same idea - and that someone happens to be J.C. Chandor.  Naturally, it's difficult to look at this film without being reminded of Life of Pi, since it does seem rather convenient that another film of this nature is released only a year removed from wild success of Life of Pi.  Regardless of how enjoyable Life of Pi was - All is Lost is simply better.  Not only is it better, it's far more realistic, and removes the endless array of thematic, religious overtones that caused so much discussion and analysis after the initial release of Life of Pi.  Chandor's vision introduces a real-life scenario, along with a series of free-flowing emotions that are brought out in an individual while being stranded at sea.

It's safe to say there are only a few actors that have the skill to star in an isolated character role like this and keep the audience's attention - and Robert Redford is one of them.  Like Tom Hanks in Cast Away and Sandra Bullock in Gravity, Redford is at his very best when all of the attention is on him. From the beginning of the film to the end, the only face you'll see and voice you'll hear is his - meaning you'll quickly have to get comfortable with the idea of the absence of dialogue (aside from a few words here and there).  For an actor well into his 70s, he still clearly demonstrates his mastery of acting.

As the film progresses, Redford takes his character through the natural state of fear, and eventually experiences frustration, anger, and finally, acceptance.  He manages to accomplish all of this by using nothing more than the simplest facial expressions and interacting with inanimate objects.  Redford's nameless character does everything in his power to prove that he (who you'll biographically know nothing about) has the desire to survive this frightening predicament.  This portrayal is so flawless that it would be the ultimate snub if Robert Redford were not at least nominated for an Academy Award.  Early odds point to him earning a Lead Actor nomination and in the event that he won, he'd be the first person to win the award as both an actor and director.

Honestly, the positive adjectives in which to describe Redford's performance are endless, particularly because he portrays a character without any sort of back story or character elaboration.  You can call his portrayal anything from moving and emotional to nerve-wracking and gripping.  In spite of everything, his character is only as powerful as the story that has been written for him.  Again, J.C. Chandor has written this story under the simple premise that anything that can go wrong will go wrong.  Even in the brief opening dialogue from Redford, his character openly admits to whoever he's speaking that ""all is lost"" - so right off the bat, there's an intense tone that's been set for the direction in which this film is headed.  First, there's a gaping hole in the boat to contend with, followed by various issues aboard the boat from water damage, and then, eventually the weather takes a turn for the worst.  When the weather calms, this character is faced with dwindling supplies, and flailing hope.  One thing is for sure, you won't look at water the same way after witnessing the nail-biting course of events in this film.

Robert Redford's acting and the story are simply exquisite, but we don't often take time to fully appreciate the special effects that go into a small market film of this nature.  Gravity was a huge box office sensation, full of spectacular visuals, but oceanic visuals are far less mesmerizing than the sheer beauty of outer space.  Instead, the chaotic setting of an angry ocean has to be interpreted and depicted in a serious manner.  Obviously, this all takes place while Redford is within a controlled setting aboard a boat that's doing much more than just rocking back and forth.  In one scene, Redford is tossed overboard and another scene his boat completely flips over, and he clearly has to struggle underwater against the water-based elements in order to get himself back aboard his vessel.  While this may not seem all that impressive in comparison to an outer space-based setting, keep in mind that Robert Redford is 77 years old.  It's not just Redford's emotional acting that makes this role spectacular, it's also the fact that he does all of his own stunts - many of which don't look all that pleasant.

Overall, All is Lost incorporates every element that a film requires to be entertaining and emotionally charged.  This is a sobering story that features even the most realistic elements, which is evident in the fact that Redford's character, despite his thirst, can't drink ocean water due to the high salt content, and can't catch fish because of the attention they bring from sharks.  Despite the most thoughtful inventions, like the inflatable safety raft and supply kit, survival still requires a substantial amount of luck - and it's painfully evident this main character is devoid of that particular good fortune.  Much like the conclusion to Life of Pi, All is Lost has already garnered quite a bit of attention over an ending that is open to interpretation.  Obviously, you'll have to see the movie to fully understand, but this happens to be one of those stories where you (the viewer) decide the fate of the character.  Any way you look at it and taking into account the traumatic series of events that this character must endure over an eight day span, the end result is cinematically acceptable no matter what your individual opinion happens to be on the matter.

5920734,2,B00EIPEQLW,"Wow. Why bother to go through all of this trouble and not get the script done right? A note to screenwriters: KNOW YOUR MATERIAL.
From a technical standpoint, Redford does almost everything wrong and the writer appears to know little about sailing. Watch as Redford floods his boat for no reason so he can retrieve his sea anchor! Watch as the impact with the container has nothing to do with the loss of his boat. Watch as Redford tries to radio for help with a coastal VHF radio with 25 mile range. Watch as he tries to hoist a storm sail (And it is actually NOT a storm sail!) after the storm has come. Watch as Redford's boat is dismasted, and the rig is attached with only one halyard! The list of hilarious bad plot points had me shaking my head for two hours. But let's forget that for a moment and remember that the average viewer probably doesn't KNOW how dumb this is. Let's look at the character arc. There is none. Redford's performance is not so much subtle as it is a one note affair. He's slow and methodical in his efforts to survive from the start, moving like a 90 year old man and not someone in their 70s. His performance rarely conveys worry or a sense of urgency and by the end of the film the viewer might wonder if All DESERVED to be Lost if only we actually new what ""all"" was in the first place.
