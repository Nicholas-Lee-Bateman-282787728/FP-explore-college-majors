8255997,5,B0014KWLK2,"This opera by a Hungarian composer is sung in Hungarian with subtitles.  It is an interesting tale from a true event in Hungarian history.  The singing is excellent by all the cast and the acting is realistic.  The production is beautifully photographed with clear visuals and sound.  Costumes and sets are authentic to the period and quite colorful.
I would like to see more of these nationalistic operas from Eastern Euorpean composers.  There are a number of operas on DVD by Czech composers Janacek and Dvorak - all very well done with great casts.
Recommend that you buy this opera and enjoy a beautiful production.",1217721600,7,620,4.866666666666666
