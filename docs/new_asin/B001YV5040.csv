8348160,1,B001YV5040,"This is the first time for commenting. Although english is my second language ,usually I understand and feel good after watching DVD about baby. But this DVD is very difficult to following. I buy many Parenting DVDs from amazon. This one seem to be worthless.",1301702400,,259,4.777777777777778
8348161,4,B001YV5040,"I am a father-to-be and was looking for some real-life instances of real dads, their first day, first week, first month and what really to expect out of the near future. I think the video does a decent job at it. Shows the Men's perspective of things. I would have loved to see some more of disciplining tactics, teaching and guiding principles...how majority of parents train, discipline and bring the kids into a routine and what experts suggest.

It would have been splendid if the video had ended with a quick list of recommended or most used to-dos/to-buys by the Dads who participated in the video.

A pleasing watch ! Rented it for 7 days thru amazon for 1.99$, no big deal. If you are little in a hurry...don't miss out on some of these wonderful perspectives.

8348162,5,B001YV5040,"Extremely comprehensive advice from dozens of guys who have been there. Pretty much every topic imaginable, from car seats, diapering, feeding, sleep advice and the primary topics - to dealing with sex after pregnancy, finances, travelling with baby, blending families, discipline, sleep, and strengthening relationships. The dads are from all around the world, but when you listen to what thry're going through, it becomes apparent that parenting and fatherhood perspectives are truely universal.",1268006400,,497,5.821917808219178
8348163,1,B001YV5040,"First film was really good... made in America by Troy and family.  Second one was hard to understand because of their accents and different terms for things.  It was not made here so, of course, the language, accents, etc., of the dads in question were hard to understand. It did not flow at all.",1260403200,,296,4.462962962962963
