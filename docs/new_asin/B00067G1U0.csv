2173302,5,B00067G1U0,"I have always enjoyed Anthony Robbins because of the positive reinforcement he gives you.  Although alot of stuff sounds like common sense.  Its always good to ""hear"" that stuff and feel encouraged and to keep going on.  Recommend Anthony Robbins.",1318636800,,247,5.125
2173303,5,B00067G1U0,"I can't say enough good things about Tony Robbins, his books and CD programs - I'm a believer. I'm also living proof that if you employ his methods great things can happen. I've listened to these CD's many times and have lent them out to others that I wanted to see get ahead in life, love or whatever.
Tony is a great communicator, mentor and life coach. I get excited just thinking about all I've learned over the years from Tony. I highly reccomend his works to anyone who wants to improve in any facet of their life. Whether your looking to build a business, lose weight, improve your marriage or bank account or just find happiness Tony is your man and these tapes are a great starting place.",1317772800,4,697,4.410852713178294

2173306,1,B00067G1U0,This product is advertised by Amazon as being a set of DVDs (as of 10/26/2010). These are NOT DVDs; they are CDs.,1288051200,35,113,4.181818181818182
2173307,5,B00067G1U0,"A fantastic motivational program. This was incredible when it came out years ago and still the theories and concept still hold true today. The program really let's you understand human emotion and interaction and how to get control over all aspects of your life.

You won't regret getting this product.",1283126400,5,302,5.04
2173308,2,B00067G1U0,"THIS IS NOT A DVD!!! This is a set of 7 audio CDs. The one I ordered was listed as 'New', but the box they came in was pretty beat up and the first CD was not in the plastic wrap like the other 6. And it had fingerprints on the playing surface.
THIS IS NOT A DVD!!! Change the description, please. It's misleading.",1279756800,8,314,3.921875
2173309,5,B00067G1U0,"After listening to Tony Robbins' CD, I am not impressed with him. Because Tony Robbins made me realise how powerful I am.  I am now impressed with myself.
Thanks Tony, you make my day!

2173310,5,B00067G1U0,"I bought this course and it changed my financial life. Period.
I haven't come across anybody else that has the inspiring and GENUINE desire to jump-start you like Anthony. God bless this guy.
And, believe me, I have heard lots of seminars. Anthony has no match in the personal coaching arena.",1248652800,14,292,4.745098039215686
2173311,5,B00067G1U0,"This series of Tony Robbins CD's presents a systematic way to create life changes through changing internal dialogue. Tony is your personal coach inspiring you to take action. Results can be phenomenal. The program is timeless and invaluable. I have bought this series several times listened to them and passed them on to friends. I actually preferred them to ""Get the Edge"" which is of course another great series. I have noticed a difference in the way individuals that I have passed them on to use them. I have noticed that the people who listen and do the journaling have far greater lasting changes than the individuals just listening to the CD's. As for myself, this program presented the most positive life changes one could hope for.",1243209600,35,741,4.84251968503937

8039723,3,B00067G1U0,Not the same as the tape series I thought it was.  Not as well put together as that tape edition from the early 90's.,1425254400,,117,3.875
8039724,5,B00067G1U0,great stuff,1398902400,,11,5.0
8039725,5,B00067G1U0,"I have an abridged version of Personal Power and went thru the CDs.  I wanted to listen to the full version only because I love listening to his examples and stories.  This man is so inspiring, and understands human behavior.  Simple, easy to follow exercises are included with the day's lesson so you can start making significant change.  And it is EASY to do!

Find a used copy and purchase this!",1383350400,,398,4.549295774647887
8039726,5,B00067G1U0,"Any self improvement cd's and books are all good if it makes you feel better or make you re-think what you have been doing, because THAT behavior wasn't working. Having someone give you new ideas on HOW to change that behavior and how to start is always a blessing. We need direction and Hope. This is definitely a start.....",1378080000,,325,4.52542372881356

8039728,5,B00067G1U0,"If you really listen to what Tony has to say and you DO IT, you will see results.  I've been reading and listening to his stuff for nearly 20 years now.  And when people ask me about some of my achievements, I find myself describing behaviors that I learned from Tony.  This program is ideal for someone who maybe has a lot of energy and enthusiasm but just doesn't quite know how to get started.  Tony's methods will give you a way of directing your energies.  But if you are the type to sit on the couch and proclaim how ""none of that stuff really works"" then save your money, stay on the couch and keep telling yourself all those successful people got there by ""luck.""",1327536000,8,671,4.2936507936507935
