3688301,4,B001LNOMYA,"Who would have thought being a germ detective could be so provocative? Terry-Thomas plays a charming infectious disease investigator for the World Health Organization based in London. Women love his flirty suggestive manner and even a chimp is attracted to him. He can't help gazing at a lovely pair of legs, even putting his unique sports car at risk. One gem in this surprise is Honor Blackman who plays the airport nurse. She hasn't yet developped her persona as a Bond girl but the voice is there. I gave this a 4 because during the beginning there is an annoying film stamp, SC, in the middle of the screen. I suppose it is there to stop piracy but it is distracting. It eventually disappears. If you are a TT fan, you may want to see this one. It is not uproarious but it is funny.",1296259200,12,787,4.43448275862069
3688302,5,B001LNOMYA,If you are a fan of Terry-Thomas this delightful comedy is a fun-filled go at the inner workings of what transpires withing the World Health Organization. A definite must see for Terry-Thomas lovers.,1294444800,6,199,5.0606060606060606
3688303,4,B001LNOMYA,A very rare British thriller with Terry-Thomas in a dramatic role.  This little gem of a film is a real who-done-it thriller with a great climax in the Swiss Alps.  Look for lots of familiar and famous British actors and actresses who make this a genuinely original drama which predates many films which copy its premise.,1283126400,13,321,4.714285714285714
8318956,5,B001LNOMYA,"A different kind of Terry Thomas movie....and he did it splendidly. Not to be considered to be a Comic movie, but as an entertaining movie. You won't be bursting of laughter, for sure, but you will enjoy it....I hope.",1502236800,,217,4.589743589743589

8318958,4,B001LNOMYA,"A very pleasant surprise. Terry Thomas plays this one just right, as It is not meant to be a comedy, but a very serious film.",1488672000,,125,4.04
8318959,4,B001LNOMYA,Great movie. Solid plot and mystery. Not many movies made like this anymore,1483401600,,75,4.846153846153846
8318960,2,B001LNOMYA,"There is nothing wrong with this movie but unless you are a devotee of Terry-Thomas and must have all of his films, I would pass on this one.  The Terry-Thomas we know and love apparently made several B films before he got to define his character in comedy roles and sadly this is one of them.",1468368000,,293,4.232142857142857
8318961,4,B001LNOMYA,If you are a Terry-Thomas fan this shows his skills in a different vein.  Non-comedic but worth watching.,1462752000,,105,4.833333333333333
8318962,1,B001LNOMYA,"Not a bad film, but this is an extremely bad transfer. The DVD from ""SinisterCinema"" is indeed sinister cinema. Such a terrible transfer, but even if all they had were blurry prints to work from (and this DVD is VERY blurry and washed out) you'd think they'd at least run it trough Premiere Pro or Final Cut to provide a cleaner print for their DVD. You're better off downloading a free copy off the public domain.",1459209600,2,414,4.4605263157894735
8318963,4,B001LNOMYA,Sort of a documentary for the WHO; Terry Thomas still amusing .,1448064000,,63,4.333333333333333
8318964,4,B001LNOMYA,"It may be a surprise to some and a shock to others that renowned British comedian Terry-Thomas made a predominately dramatic film.  On the same token some of his fans will welcome this departure from form and others incensed when you consider that the distributor of this DVD, Sinister Cinema, is marketing it as a straight comedy.  You would then ask how does he do?  Quite well, thank you.  Terry-Thomas finds himself quite adept in assaying the more serious elements of the story while appropriating elements of his comic persona in his portrayal of an inspector for the World Health Organization. In a nutshell his work here isn't on the level of an Alec Guinness (""Bridge on the River Kwai"") but comparable to Peter Sellers (""Hoffman"") when they strayed into the dramatic.  The film is diminished somewhat however by trite movie-of-the-week plotting which concerns the manhunt for the carrier of the smallpox virus.  The main story is straight out of ""Quincy"" or ""CSI"" ending up in James Bond territory.  Reservations aside I would recommend this as a must for Terry-Thomas fans which in a perfect world should be everybody.",1438992000,,1129,4.941798941798941
