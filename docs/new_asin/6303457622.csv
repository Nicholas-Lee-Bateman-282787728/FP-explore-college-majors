My first time on TV so I was game for anything, but watching such a silly movie was tough...still, the producer was soooooo nice....Robert Davi was such a professional, and Paula Barbieri(spelling?) was OJ Simpson's girlfriend right about the time of the infamous murder trial... Oh, to be 22 again...lol",1459641600,,378,4.921875

7847275,4,6303457622,"I watched this movie the first time on television and they took out the naughty bits "" I was only a child then"" a mere 43 and fell in love with Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa. The movie is about a journalist who gets killed by who knows in the mob and the revenge taken by her brother and sister. It introduced me to the meaning of Honor from the other side of the world. Except for the gratuitous sex,the movie has a good plot but acting was a little stiff. Even Robert Davi was sticklike in his performance. But, for some reason I loved this movie. Joel Grey has a part that he played like wet cardboard,not very useful as if added in for flair. Even after all that I love the movie anyway.",1092700800,2,682,4.174242424242424
