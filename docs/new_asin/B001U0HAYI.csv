8342575,3,B001U0HAYI,some shows i like,1447113600,,17,3.5
8342576,4,B001U0HAYI,"I bought this just to sample some of the old shows.  Some like the Honeymooners and the Odd Couple I watched on T.V. in my younger days.  It was fun to see those shows again and it made me want to buy all the episodes of the Honeymooners which holds up as a very funny show, even today.  Also, I love being reminded of the ridiculous hairdos and seeing the clothes we used to wear.  The price was really cheap so why not see what the hit show comedies were like years ago.  You might really love some of them and for families with young kids some of these shows can't be beat since they are pretty much ""clean"" fun.",1378252800,,615,4.091666666666667
8342577,5,B001U0HAYI,"Good comedy is good comedy, and these comedians are as fresh as ever. Good to each alone or with loved ones. Laughing is contagious!",1325894400,,132,4.541666666666667

8342579,5,B001U0HAYI,THERE WILL ALWAYS BE A LONGER--BETTER REVIEW--AND THIS AIN'T MY FORTE.  BUT I WANT YOU TO KNOW TODAY I RECEIVED A PROMO COPY OF TV SETS FOREVER FUNNY--AND I WAS AS GIDDY AS A SCHOOL KID.  EVEN THOUGH I HAVE MANY SEASONS OF THE SHOWS INCLUDED ON THIS DVD--SEEING 7 OF THE ABSOLUTE FAVORITE--WELL WRITTEN--CLASSIC STAND THE TEST OF TIME--SITCOMS' FIRST EPISODES ON ONE DISC--IT PUT A SMILE ON MY FACE.  CONTAINED ON THIS GEM OF A DVD ARE FIRST EPISODES OF BRADY BUNCH--FRASIER--THE ODD COUPLE--TAXI--CHEERS--THE HONEYMOONERS--I LOVE LUCY.  ABOUT 3 HOURS OF UNEDITED--UNCUT ENTERTAINMENT THAT YOU'LL WATCH OVER AND OVER AGAIN.  AND IT'S A GREAT WAY TO INTRODUCE YOUR KIDS OR FRIENDS TO YOUR FAVORITE SHOWS!!  THE PRICE IS RIGHT AND IT BROUGHT BACK SO MANY MEMORIES FOR ME OF GROWING UP IN A SLIGHTLY GENTLER TIME.  SO GET READY TO LAUGH AGAIN AT YOUR FAVORITE CHARACTERS AND START UP THE POPCORN MAKER--BECAUSE IT'S THE PERFECT ESCAPE FOR AN EVENING.  GOOD WORK PARAMOUNT--THIS SERVES AS A GREAT SAMPLER OF YOUR TV SITCOM CATALOG.  MAYBE A VOLUME 2 WILL BE RELEASED.  FIVE STARS FOR SEVEN GREAT FIRST EPISODES OF TV'S BEST.  NOT A DUD ON THIS TAPE.,1242864000,4,1145,4.761421319796955
