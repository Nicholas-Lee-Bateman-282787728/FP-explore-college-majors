I watched them twice because I felt the more I watched them, the more I could apply the bible's teaching to my daily life. In addition, Nicky Gumbel is very humorous. His teaching was fun and easy to follow. I learned a lot and laughed a lot.  Highly recommended it.",1380067200,,366,4.545454545454546
