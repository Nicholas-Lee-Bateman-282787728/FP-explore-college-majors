7864826,4,6304214537,"Bugs Bunny remains as one of the most influential characters in animation. His cartoons still continue to capture the hearts of millions, and that remains the truth with each carrot in the pot.
The Stars Of Space Jam Collection, consists of six Bugs cartoons that are just outstanding. Each one is still full of jam packed zaniness. From a gambling rabbit, with luck beyond his wildest dares in Barbary-Coast Bunny, to his servitude in our somewhat finest military branch, that needs to start enduring a sense of humor, in Forward March Hare, and even accidentally mistaken for by gorillas as his baby in Apes Of Wrath.
Of the Stars Of Space Jam series Warner Brothers created in the mid 90's, the Bugs Bunny chapter has some of zaniest cartoons to date, all brilliantly issued to video for the very first time. This and two other chapters are worth the money.",1015545600,8,860,4.74
