8013542,4,B0001KL4UO,"The story centers around Eddie Presley and the low income inhabitants of his street life in Hollywood. Eddie is a contractor security guard who lives in his van. He wants to be an Elvis impersonator. Finally he gets a gig.

The movie consists of many stereotypical Hollywood type people, including the vulture agent with a bad hair piece and plaid jacket named Sid. It was unusually well done for a Tempe film. The acting was better than any Tempe film. It ranks 4 stars on the Tempe scale, about a 2 star movie otherwise.

F-bomb. Brief sex and nudity.",1318464000,,553,4.575757575757576
8013543,5,B0001KL4UO,"This film about a down-on-his-luck Elvis impersonator trying to make a comeback performance at a seedy Hollywood Night club is filled with characters who are clearly on the outter fridges of the Hollywood entertainment community but whose persistance is both amusing and heartwarming.

If you like films about show business and especially showbusiness in Hollywood then I would suggest a look at this film.",1101427200,3,406,5.34375
