7985937,5,B00008OD9F,"This is one of the few pilates workouts that I can physically feel after 20 minutes.  Other workouts are slow and tedious while this one is fast paced.  Melinda doesn't waste time with explanations and transitions.  It's true that the studio and production is pretty bland, but the workout is so great with variety from head to toe that I can overlook this.  I don't even watch anymore...I know what to do from listening.  In my 15 years of doing workout videos (which normally bore me to death) this is the only one I've stuck with enough to do regularly.  I am now purchasing the DVD because my VHS copy has finally gone bad.",1226880000,,627,4.456140350877193
7985938,4,B00008OD9F,"Pilates for Everyday/Basic Intermediate is a classic Pilates mat workout perfect for those at an intermediate level.  This is definitely NOT a good video for beginners, as there is NO instruction provided prior to each move.  Instead, Melinda immediately begins the workout, simply announcing the name of the exercise (through voiceover instruction) and then moving right into it.  She does provide tips on form as you go through the repetitions, but in order to keep up, you MUST already be familiar with Pilates and have had some prior experience practicing this method.  Melinda sticks to the traditional Pilates matwork sequencing, and she performs the workout as Joseph Pilates himself did, flowing very quickly from one move into the next.  Although she modifies the exercises slightly at times (for example, a modified version of swan dive), Melinda does not suggest any modifications for different levels.
On the one hand, I liked the fast-moving pace of this workout, as I definitely felt energized afterward; I also liked the fact that I could complete the entire workout in only 18 minutes.  On the other hand, I felt that Melinda moved just a bit TOO quickly at times, as there often wasn't quite enough time to adequately set up for the next movement.  However, this is definitely a very good workout for veteran Pilates practioners who are looking to advance their practice.",1075161600,9,1388,5.06140350877193
7985939,5,B00008OD9F,"If you are serious about getting in shape and really want a work out video program that you won't get board with after the first time you use it, this is it. I know I sound as if I am on Melinda's marketing team but I am not. I am just a believer in her Pilates programs. There is no sleeping allowed when Melinda is teaching Pilates. I did my research and she has studied with only first generation Pilates grand Master teachers such as Romana Kryzanowska. If you know the history of Pilates you will know that Romana Kryzanowska was the person that Joe Pilates willed the method to when he died. Melinda was one of the first to offer a Pilates Teacher Certification program teaching Traditional Pilates. She is one of the two people who use to own the trademark on the word ""PILATES"" up until 2001/2002. I have found that Pilates based teachers are too slow and never really get you anywhere. Melinda does not joke around. From start to finish in her videos you move. This is what real Pilates is all about. Less than 20 minutes with Melinda is as effective as a 60 minutes workout. The bottom line story about Melinda is she is the Pilates teacher of the teachers and then add her physical therapy degree to it and you end up with one of the best Pilates Master teacher available. I recommend the Melinda's entire ""Pilates For Everyday"" series. And if you get pregnant get her Pilates For Pregnancy and Pilates after Pregnancy videos. This is how I heard of Melinda. My doctor useses Melinda's programs and highly recommends her videos.",1047340800,11,1539,4.519713261648746
7985940,5,B00008OD9F,"Great energy, great tempo, great program and great fun!  I love Melinda and I love her videos.  Although I have not had the opportunity to be thought by Melinda, (normally she is kept busy by celebrities too big to be named) I have been an on and off client at one of Melinda's centers in West Hollywood since 1992.  Melinda has been healing, teaching, training, and certifyiny other teachers since way before people could even pronounce the word Pilates.  She was actually one of the two people who held the trademark on the word ""Pilates"" up until about 2 or 3 years ago.
I travel a lot since I am a buyer for Nordstrom and have been pleading and begging for her to put out some Pilates videos so I could do Pilates on the road.  I am 41 and had my second Pilates daughter, which was made easier than my first due to Melinda's program.  I just started the After Pregnancy program and I look and feel younger, stronger, and sexier than ever.  My husband hates to go to gyms and fitness centers so I got him Melinda's ""Pilates For Everyday"" program and it has replaced his TV channel flipping, and I can see his beer belly slipping away.  He does the video program 20 minutes per day, 3 day per week.  It is good to be a mother again at 41, and I can honestly say that without her videos I would not be smiling so happily right now.",1046995200,5,1332,4.274900398406374
