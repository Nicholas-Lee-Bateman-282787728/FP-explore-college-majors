5902927,3,B00ECGIL9K,"My kids liked the first two Home Alone movies, but I have to be honest and say that they were luke warm to this one. Not that there was bad acting or anything, just a bit weaker plot and a story line that seems to keep coming back in these movies. We didn't think that it was as funny as the original movies and our young daughters were actually a bit scared when it came to the idea of ghosts. While in the end this is a good family movie, it just was not the same as the original cast and family from the first round of movies.

5902928,1,B00ECGIL9K,Dumbest Idea for a movie . This movie should not have the same name as HOME ALONE its terrible! TERRIBLE!,1383523200,5,105,4.3

Movie over!!) dumb. My son on the other hand looses all the home alone movies even the other train wrecks 3 and 4. He's literally been waiting for this movie to be released on DVD.

5902939,2,B00ECGIL9K,It took a full hour to get to the 'booby trap' part that is so crucial to the Home Alone brand. I was so annoyed by the poor hour long build up that I decided not to finish the movie after an hour into it. I'm gearing up the first three Home Alone movies now - they were a hit.

5902955,4,B00ECGIL9K,"It obviously is no where in the same league as the original movie, that was an original idea at the time and starred the highest paid child actor of that era.  If the main actors (two kids are left home alone in this one and there's a younger girl building a snow fort in her front yard next door the whole movie), have been in anything else, I've never seen those films. Likewise the parents. But like any made for TV movie, it does follow the formula of having at least one recognisable face from a highly watched TV show from the past, with Eddie Steeples, best known as Darnell Turner in My Name is Earl, who plays one of the home invaders in this one. His character is actually pretty similar.  There's actually three home invaders this time round, one is a woman, I've never seen the actress who plays her in anything else before but the boss of the trio of thieves is played by Malcolm McDowell whose pretty much been a staple actor on TV for decades.

The movie is a bit different to the formulaic concept from the previous movies, although obviously we still have criminals trying to break in and encountering a heap of traps at one stage.  In this one, a family (who are a completely different family to the one in the other movies) have just moved from California to Maine, where the mum is starting a new job.  Neither the male child (about ten years old I guess) or his older sister are thrilled to have moved, and both want to return to California.  The boy who is afraid of just about everything, especially the basement, just wants to play online video games against fat bearded middle age men in his room, but his mother forces him to go outside and play with ""the boy"" next door (who I'm pretty sure was actually a girl but no one ever says her name and she wears a snowgirl beanie and tracksuit the whole movie, since the mother never rings the neighbours when she can't get home I'm assuming she hasn't actually met them), anyway when he invites her to come play video games with him she tells him she's never setting a foot in his house because it's haunted which of course makes a wussy kid, even more frightened.

Mild spoilers about how we get to the home invasion scenario you know will be in this.  Every noise, as well as mild evidence of a break in earlier by thieves that the family interrupts when they come home, he assumes is being done by a ghost (he calls Dead Leg or something stupid).  So when the thieves eventually return, expecting the whole family to be at the mother's boss' Christmas party in the mountains due to the invitation having been seen on the fridge, he initially thinks they are the ghost. But his sister is trapped in the basement so when he goes to the hardware store to buy chainsaws and all sorts of stuff to get her out, he overhears the thieves talking about their plans.  He of course because he's in a Home Alone movie, instead of just contacting the police or the neighbours, must defend the house!  With a little help from the fat gaming guy in another city who thinks he's playing a new video game and the little girl next door.  Disappointingly the teenage sister is trapped and can't contribute, as that would have been a way cooler movie, since you have three invaders this time, having two siblings defend their house making traps and stuff, but instead you've just got the standard one.

Like all these films you wonder why once an intruder has set off a booby trap they don't continue into the house from that point and instead come back outside onto the footpath to try a different entry point.  You also wonder since they got into the house no problems at all previously, they don't just try and get in through the same door in the first place on this new night.  The traps are a fair bit lamer than the original, one just has an intruder covered in cooking batter, yet he also leaves the house and goes back outside to think of a new plan after that.  Who would care about cooking batter?  Some though like the first film you'd think would kill the intruder, such as a garage door being completely dented from inside projectiles, that you can see on the other side of the closed door around the shape of the man, yet he isn't dead.  You also wonder how they don't see the ropes attached to a lot of these traps.  The writers certainly haven't put the same amount of effort into the traps in this one as the writers did in the first film.

Still overall it's quite an entertaining aimed at kid viewers film.  The kid never does Kevin's trademark hands on sides of his face with the mouth in an O pose that is on the DVD cover.  His parents both do when describing a famous painting, but the kid never does, he's never trying to be Kevin as the DVD cover implies.

I think if they are going to make a sixth one they should have Kevin (with Macaulay Culkin if he still acts) as one of the thieves, forced to break into some little kids house because Kevin's own family has been kidnapped by the Wet Bandits who want some piece of jewelry (but more importantly to see Kevin go through what they did).",1483228800,,5069,4.3691489361702125

5902975,2,B00ECGIL9K,"I ordered this for my 7 year old son.  I had been trying to get him into some of the ""oldies"" from when I was younger.  He fell in love with the original Home Alone and Home Alone 2.  This one is NOTHING in my opinion, like the originals.  NOTHING.  It is scary and doesn't match the audience that the originals do.  I was very disappointed that the description didn't describe how scary it was or the real premise.  My son doesn't scare easily and quickly tells other kids or friends that ""things aren't real"" or ""we know its fake, don't worry.""  This was different, it wasn't like a scary Scooby Doo or Monsters Inc - it was for much older kids.  I am not a movie rater - but I would say much closer to PG-13 - although I am sure it doesn't match up to that level.  But having 10, 8, and 7 year olds in the house - I can tell you that all of them wanted it turned off and were scared for several days.  I guess to be fair, my review is based on my statements not the actual movie.  Although, that too was very poor compared to the good old ones!",1456790400,4,1047,4.004830917874396

5903068,3,B00ECGIL9K,"I guess this movie will play every holiday season, even though it's not as good as the originals.  I think it still gives a good message in the world we live in today.  We can think about it, Home Alone is an early '90s movie before we had all this technology we have today.  The original Home Alone doesn't even show a cellphone.  Basically, the only electronic way Kevin was entertaining himself was by watching TV or movies.  We don't see him playing on a computer or video games.  It also came out long before Iphones, so even the teens had different ways of communicating and entertaining themselves back then.
We remember Home Alone films mostly for their slapstick humor where a kid takes down burglars.  They normally give a family message.  It's obvious the moral of this Home Alone.  In this digital age we live in, a lot of people are just not getting out into the world enough and so used to playing online games or using their phones as technology to text and look at messages from friends.  It's cool and sad to think of what the world has come to since the first home alone came out, and we might wish to go back to the older days when this wasn't so much the case.  It's obvious that the producers of this film probably expecting mostly kids to watch it, not only intended to have a holiday season movie, but intended to give a message to kids how they should put away their technology from time to time, and live in the real world, do things with their family and friends outside.  So, I have to say I'll give this film a 3/5.  I think it's getting annoying how many Home Alones have been made since the original, just because they have slapstick humor.  But, I appreciate the message they gave, it works so well in today's world.  This might be an ok film to watch during the holiday season to get you into the holiday spirit, it's a little funny too.",1399161600,,1869,4.361271676300578

5903076,3,B00ECGIL9K,"Note: I saw this movie with XFinity On Demand.

Thie (hopefully final) installment in the Home Alone franchise is a made-for-television film which has at least a better premise than the atrocious Home Alone 4 (only Macualey Culkin can play Kevin, and only Daniel Stern can play Marv). I liked the groundwork of big sister/little brother left alone in the house, but their relationship seemed devoid of love or compassion until the final scenes, which disappointed me greatly. Adding the six-year old girl was a nice touch, but she was under-used. With a better script, the fifth film could really have breathed life again into a series that began dying with Home Alone 4.

Stick with the first three films, skip the fourth one and see this one once.",1387497600,12,749,4.7984496124031

5903080,4,B00ECGIL9K,"Home Alone 5: The Holiday Heist (2012). I have seen Home Alone 1, 2, and 3 when they were originally released at the movie theaters. I have also read the novelization of Home Alone 1 and 2 back in 1990/1992. All three films were great, and I always enjoyed the plots of Home Alone 1-3. However the 4th installment from 2002 was a complete total embarrassment. Home Alone (5): The Holiday Heist released in 2012 (as straight-to-TV) goes back to its roots a little bit, and is pretty good (although not great). It's obvious by the quality that this film was made for television, but it's still not half bad. I'll admit the acting by the parents are a little over-the-top at times, and this film is nothing in comparison to the first Home Alone (1990) film. Yet, this film still isn't bad or stupid. Malcolm McDowell, best known from the films ""A Clockwork Orange"" (1971) and ""Time after Time"" (1979), perfectly plays the main villain in this film, and like Joe Pesci from ""Home Alone 1"", is actually an intelligent villian. The other two villains are a little silly/dimwitted - the producers could of casted much better in that area. Home Alone 5: The Holiday Heist seems to copy the plots of Home Alone (1990) and Home Alone 3 (1997). I don't want to give away spoilers, but If you (recently) seen both Home Alone 1 and 3, you'll understand what I mean. This film is almost like a remake of sorts; mixing the plots of Home 1 and 3 into one film. It's the type of movie to watch on a rainy day, or while putting up the Christmas tree, or when it's on television. It doesn't have the funny laughs that Home 1 and 2 had or even Home Alone 3. This film is nice, enjoyable, but at the same time doesn't hold up to Home Alone 1-3. But, I don't believe any sequels or spinoffs can hold up to the first film. I would recommend watching this film if it's on television, but I can not recommend buying this film on DVD, unless it's one of those barging bin $5.00 prices. I give this film four out of five stars. Two stars for the film at least trying to return back to the original formats of Home 1 & 3.",1386374400,10,2093,4.314720812182741
