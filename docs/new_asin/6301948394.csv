387613,2,6301948394,"John Belushi was a great comedian.
""Wired"" is not a great movie. True, the material follows that which is transcribed in Bob Woodward's biography of Belushi. However, unlike the serious normality of  the book, ""Wired"" is doomed from the start - I am spoiling  nothing to say that the beginning of the movie has the ghost of Belushi  trying to escape the autopsy room in just a hospital sheet for  clothing.
I find that to be a rather grim idea and way to present this  movie. Whilst Michael Chiklis does a passable impersonation of John  Belushi, the supporting cast seem to be sleepwalking their way through this  film.
Unlike the book that ""Wired"" comes after, the movie is  erraticly paced - slow and plodding most of the time, interspersed with  scenes of high energy that have little effect.
I don't mean to sound  deliberately harsh about ""Wired"". It's just best to steer clear  if you're a fan of Belushi - I know that I am and watching this movie, I  learnt nothing I didn't already know. Stick to the book if you want to  learn about John Belushi, and give this decidedly hit-and-miss movie a  miss.",963705600,3,1108,4.586734693877551
387614,4,6301948394,"The only thing that really hurts this film were the attempts by Dan Aykroyd and others to keep it and the book it was based from seeing the light of day.  The spineless journalists of television and the newspapers  who were obviously influenced by those attempts wrote less about the film  and more from a paranoia and a jump-on-the-bandwagon mentality that was  grossly unjust.  This is especailly unfair in a business like film that has  had a reputation for being creatively liberal.  John Belushi lived a very  dangerous life.  He constantly walked on the edge.  His death offered  little surprise for the people who knew him and loved him.  So why not  write a book about the behind-the-scenes life of this immensly talented  human being!  Consequently, why not make a faithful and accurate motion  picture from that book!
But the film doesn't stop there.  In adding the  aspect of the guardian angel (Ray Sharkey), a character not in the book, it  explores new territory not touched upon in other biographies.  What if  Belushi did have the chance to see how he messed up?  What would he do?  Of  course, this addition was used as an argument by the movie's detractors.  They used it to condemn the whole film.  Not a valid argument.  Just  because it had never been attempted before was no reason not to try it this  time.  The film's enemies were, in truth, trying to come up with something  that they thought people would reason was not a good idea, then use that to  camouflage the real reason they didn't like it.
In the days of Louis B.  Mayer, Harry Cohn, Darryl Zanuck, Jack Warner and the other movie moguls,  the truth had a way of disappearing.  With the 50's and the beginning of  the demise of the studio system the film industry started becoming a great  deal more honest with itself.  Unfortunately, not every movie became  protected by this gradual change.  WIRED is such a movie.  But it's not  just the truth about Belushi that made certain executives and other bigwigs  cringe.  It is mainly the film's views about the industry and how it is  represented here and in the book that made them paranoid.
Nevertheless,  except for a couple of flaws-lack of chronology of events and the  intersplicing of scenes with Bob Woodward, the author of the book, which  makes things confusing and the lack of substance in some of the  characters-this film deserves to be watched.  Although the episodic nature  of this work makes things a little jumpy, it also manages to move it along  at a good pace.  Michael Chiklis as Belushi, Patti D'Arbanville as Cathy  Smith, his killer, Lucinda Jenney as his wife and Alex Rocco as his manager  all give memorable performances.  The script, as mentioned before, is  faithful to the book (although not chronologically) and the imagination  shown is something that Belushi himself would have been proud of.
Skip  the other things said and written about this movie and see it.  Whether a  Belushi fan or not, it might be the perfect exercise in open-mindedness!",956534400,,3013,4.745136186770428

7817982,5,6301948394,"The very much maligned and reviled late 1980's movie based on the book by Bob Woodward. The universal opinion is that this is a terrible movie and should never be seen, seems a bit of an overreaction. However, if you can get past the assumptions and misconceptions about the movie and look at it in its own right, it's really a masterpiece. The directing is very fast paced, Avant Garde and nonlinear. The movie demands you pay attention and takes hold and keeps you the whole ride. This movie is not meant to be a realistic look at the man John Belushi. Its a cross section, an archeological survey of a larger than life legend. This movie doesnt give the complete story or is accurate any more than The Doors, movie about Jim Morrison was. Nor was it trying to be I understand John Belushis wife and Dan Aykroyds anger with this book and movie, but if one didn't really know John Belushi and is interested in what happened to Belushi and why he died, then this movie is a great time capsule from an outsiders perspective, which most of us are. Michael Chiklis does a superb job at his interpretation of John Belushi and he gets better as the movie goes along. Gary Groomes makes for a very believable and archetypal Dan Aykroyd. This movie is a huge, intense, dark, and beautifully flawed experience, as was John",1501200000,,1314,4.525210084033613
7817983,2,6301948394,"I remember when this came out in 1989.  The movie never made it to where I lived (which I found out why when it was released on VHS), so I had only the soundtrack of Wired to go by and clips from a movie trailer about Wired.  I thought, ""Hey, these guys look and act like Belushi and their singing is pretty good, so I can't wait to see it.""  I thought it would have been like other bios at the time, like La Bamba, The Buddy Holly Story, Sweet Dreams, Elvis or Great Balls Of Fire.  But my god...why did they have to have this be about a dead John Belushi looking back at his life?  Really? Not only that, but even when the soul of Belushi discovers the error of his ways (like Dickens or Jimmy Stewart did), he still has to be dead and doesn't get to go back. Could you have pictured if La Bamba started after Ritchie Valens got killed seeing a burnt plane in cornfield and had an angel take his ghost back in time to look back on his life and singing career?  No wonder many early SNL actors and Dan Akyroyd hated this movie.  This movie would honestly not have been so bad if they made this a bio movie like Walk the Line or La Bamba, etc.

The only thing I'll disagree with critics is when they said this movie focused too much on him using drugs and made him look negative.  I never got that feeling.  However, when you die (young) of a drug overdose, it's hard to believe that you wouldn't be wild or crazy.  You know?  I do agree the whole idea of having a dead Belushi look back on his life was stupid and should have just been a regular biopic movie like the ones I mentioned above.

Rumor has it a new bio movie about Belushi is in the works.  Let's hope it's better than that.  Really, this movie could at least have been a high-B list movie instead of a bomb.  May Belushi rest in peace.",1326585600,2,1800,4.085470085470085
7817984,4,6301948394,"I owned this movie and thought it was a really good movie.  I just wish they would transfer it to DVD, I'd get a copy.  I'm surprised this movie was panned so much at Amazon.  At the time of this movies release, it was highly controversial since it involved drug use, but I considered it a hard hitting movie.  It certainly made an impact on me!  The end of the movie was depressing though, as you are wishing he would live, but in reality you knew that was impossible as he was already dead...............",1298073600,,506,4.340425531914893
7817985,5,6301948394,"I think it sort of mimics the crazy roller coaster life that Belushi led. The scene with Woodward confronting his subject at the end, particularly from a writer's perspective, was very interesting. And there's some pretty dark humor... Belushi's ghost aware during the autopsy, or being put on the plane in his body bag instead of coffin because the coffin won't fit. Some complained about the Hell insinuation at the end. But think about it... his whole situation became an uncontrollable hell. That's partially shown in the nightclub scene, as he tries to escape the drugs, but can't.

If you like the surreal, I'd recommend checking this out. At the very least, it doesn't deserve the bad reputation it has. Back when it came out, part of the reason it got so trashed was because of how it hopped around time wise. That became a much more accepted film staple throughout the 90's. I always thought this might become a cult film. Look for it on YouTube to give it a fair shake.",1288656000,,979,4.658959537572255
7817986,2,6301948394,"The producers of this film took an already tasteless and exploitative book (Bob Woodward's ""biography"" of John Belushi) and turned it into a bloated, senseless, still tasteless and exploitative movie. Notorious for both its controversial depiction of Belushi and disastrous reception upon release, ""Wired"" follows the too-soon-gone comic/actor (played by Michael Chiklis) in a Charles Dickens-like journey through his life (that is, if Charles Dickens had been a vulture), guided by his guardian angel...named Angel (Ray Sharkey).
The ill-advised scene attempting to comically depict Belushi's autopsy should be enough to keep anyone away, but add a stale script and you've got one bad movie. Although, despite its reckless abandon of taste, ""Wired"" does feature a burgeoning Chiklis trying his best, though weighed down by poor writing. The character he plays is certainly effective, even if it's not quite John Belushi he's portraying. Ray Sharkey is also somehow entertaining in his role as the angel of death, finding the often-underrated late actor managing to pull off a watchable performance of a bad character.
There was certainly a movie that could have been made about the life of one of America's most popular comic actors, but ""Wired"" blew it.",1280275200,,1255,5.375634517766497
7817987,2,6301948394,"The lopsided nature of the book Wired is amplified in the movie version. While the book focused very heavily on Belushi's drug addictions, there were references to his work and other facets of his personality outside of the cocaine-addled, binging monster; there was at least an attempt to provide a rounded portrait of Belushi as a human being (admittedly a weak attempt, but one nonetheless). With Wired the movie, one gets little sense of Belushi as being anything other than an obnoxious celebrity who took drugs. In addition, the movie has Belushi acting in SNL skits that never existed, singing Blues Brothers songs that the band never sung, and many of the persons in Belushi's real life have different names in the film (as the production was threatened with many lawsuits even before filming began). The filmic convention of having the recently deceased Belushi's ghost viewing various drug binges he undertook while alive is poorly executed, and the final scenes of Belushi's ghost playing a pinball game with his guardian angel in exchange for his life back if he wins are in the poorest taste (as is the vivid implication that Belushi went to hell because of the way he died). The narrative is all over the place in terms of chronology, with too many fast-forwards and flashbacks - unless one has read the book very carefully, one would be excused for being confused many times during the film as to when what is happening onscreen was supposed to have taken place. About the only parts of the film that work well and ring slightly true are the scenes lifted verbatim from Woodward's book, along with an energetic performance by Michael Chiklis as Belushi. Those two elements, along with a strong (if misguided) sense of courage on the part of the producers for making the film at all (considering the pressure they were under not to) give this a two-star rating.",1219104000,2,1875,4.844236760124611
7817988,4,6301948394,"I read the book by the same name before watching the movie. The film has some scenes that are word for word from the book, which are basically word for word in which they were said in real life. THere are some things 9in the film that are not in the book, such as the gaurdian angel and Bob Woodward never met Belushi. But overall I liked the film. Chicklis did an incredible Belushi down to the voice and the movement. I'd say if you are a fan of either see it. Other reviews scared me but the movie was great for any real John Belushi fan.",1114128000,2,541,4.065420560747664
7817989,1,6301948394,"If you are a John Belushi fan or Michael Chiklis fan do yourself a favor... DON'T BUY THIS TAPE! This movie stinks! I am a huge Belushi fan and I like Chiklis in The Shield, but watching this movie just made me feel sorry for both of them. It has a rotten plot, premise and script. Please, for the love of humanity, stay away from this movie. Don't say I didn't warn you.",1085529600,6,371,4.095890410958904
7817990,2,6301948394,"Not much could be said about John Belushi's life.  He lived it way too fast and that was what killed him.  I've only recently heard from a friend that they actually made a movie about Belushi, much like they did to other SNL stars who have passed on, like Andy Kaufman and Gilda Radner.  It was then did I hear the film was blasted by numerous critics and fans at the box office, calling it a piece of garbage that would make John spin in his grave.  I figured it was worth seeing, becaue I was a big fan of his, so I managed to buy a copy (for only $0.98, when about a week later, it went up to about $70!) from Ebay.  Not expecting much, I tuned in and became wired (no pun intended).  Essentially, the whole film is like Charles Dicken's ""A Christmas Carol"" with a nasty twist in the end.
Most importantly, the film is played out like A JOHN BELUSHI FILM, not a film about john belushi.  No, that's not supposed to be Michael Chiklis playing John...that's actually John!  Ah, forget it.
Well, how do we start?  We open up on the evening of March 5, 1982, with the dead body of Belushi being reeled into a morgue.  Hey awakens, suddenly, as if nothing had happened to him recently.  Frightened and confused, John attempts to escape the morgue dressed only in a blanket.  He's then picked up by a cab driver, named ""Angel""...oh, geez, I guess you know where this is going.  Angel is John's Puerto Rican Guardian Angel (""Well you sure f**cked up, pal!"") and his job is to take John back into the past and show him basically where he screwed up.  Meanwhile, after hearing about John's death, Washington Post reporter Bob Woodward jumps on the topic, wondering about whether or not he should investigate.  During this time, we are shown SNL skits that have never existed (Samurai baseball?!?), songs that the Blues Brothers never have sung (634-5789) and an ending that may prove John attempted to save his life from the speedball his took by playing a game of pinball with Angel!
It's very pathectic, yes, but then again, no one else would do a Belushi biopic.  The cast is very weird.  Chiklis however is very, very good with Belushi and gets his voice, look and style down good, while the others need some practice.  Larry Grooms, who plays Dan Aykroyd, looks more like Kevin Nelon and sounds more like Jimmy Stuwart.  Don't even get me started on the guy who played John Landis.  Geez, he didn't even look like the guy!  Much less, sound like him!  J.T. Walsh is basically the only celebrity in the film and he was pretty good playing straight as an arrow Bob Woodward.  Some scene were quite odd, like the confrontation between Woodward and Belushi (WTF?) in what the director was trying to say was ""Purgatory"".  The ending kinda hints that Belushi went to Hell, which upsetted many fans (including me).  The budget supposively was so shoe-string, that they couldn't get the rights to several of the SNL skits, (which is the reason for the random and lame skits that they show instead).  I suggest that WIRED should be redone into a better movie!  Period!",1078012800,7,3058,4.522768670309654
