308011,5,6301005538,"Natalya Bessmertnova, Bolshoi Company prima ballerina over three decades, performs splendidly in the title role for this worthy and largely successful attempt at recovering, within a studio setting, many past glories from a truly classical (as well as romantic) ballet.  Filmed at the Bolshoi Theatre in Moscow, an appropriate site for one of the Bolshoi's most admired pieces, the performance benefits quite strongly from the lack of applause that is normally tendered by live audiences revelling in infatuation for individual favourite dancers, bringing productions to a halt.  A great leaper, Bessmertnova is alike successful with acting, specially to be noted here in the Act I mad scene, while the emotional forcefulness of her partner, Mikhail Lavrovsky, as Count Albrecht decidedly contributes toward the stirring presentation of the work's sundry musical climaxes.  Juri Grigorovitsch, husband of Bessmertnova, creates here continually challenging choreography, a manifest blend of past Bolshoi triumphs along with his own innovations, and although the popular Peasant Pas de Deux from the end of Act I was completed during this production, one will forgive its subsequent removal as not being concordant with an elegiac mood that the choreographer establishes immediately upon progression into the second act.  This mood becomes the most dynamic element of the film, enhanced through smoothly achieved artistic montage and lighting effects from cinematographer Konstantin Apriatin.  During the more than a century and a half of Giselle's history, a good many sterling dancers have performed as Albrecht, but few who could maintain the role's cardinal accent upon emotional strength with the force that does Lavrovsky in this film.  And it is Lavrovsky, in company with Grigorovitsch, who provides the artistic casing that enables Bessmertnova, justly celebrated for her interpretation of the tragic innocent, to reveal only the merest hint of that romantic sense of mystery that comprises Giselle.  Bessmertnova's emotive skills, and her technique throughout, up until her final seconds with Albrecht by her grave (while she displays a perfect arabesque penche) never seem well-trod during the course of this excellent Kultur VHS release.  Adolphe Adam's score, ungratifying for the concert hall but note perfect for the ballet, with each number apt to the gifts of well-schooled dancers, is performed without a clinker by the Bolshoi Theatre Orchestra ably conducted by Alygis Zhyuraitis.  Regal Galina Kozlova, as Myrtha, Queen of the Wilis, dances with her customary efficiency, and the corps is correctly trained for a balletic event wherein cultural homage is paid not only to the choreography of Petipa but to the costumes of Bakst as well.  A DVD version has been released for a label other than Kultur but, while narrative development and the impeccable lifts of Lavrovsky are, of course, identical, the VHS taping is far superior to the DVD relative to visuals, sound, and in general quality.  Although out of print, The Kultur release can yet be found, and will be preferable to balletomanes.",1152748800,7,3111,5.446985446985447
308012,2,6301005538,"I pretty much agree with everyone else here, though I admit I am curious as to the color wash-out on DVD, I can readily understand how the VHS might be more enjoyable if the visuals are more strikingly transferred. The sound transfer is not very good, not horrible, but the very first chords are attenuated and it sounds like someone upped the volume than and was too lazy to do it over. It is filmed on a huge stage, so the dancers are given lots of room to strut their stuff, but a filming of a live performance might have been, well, livlier. There is an emotional flatness about the whole endeavor, though Act Two emerges more effectively in that regard than Act One. The score is cut rather significantly, yup those peasants are gone in Act One.

If you want a GISELLE at a budget, this isn't the world's worst choice, but I'd save a few pennies and go elsewhere.",1114905600,8,868,4.391304347826087
308013,1,6301005538,"I should have read the other reviews before I bought this. Horrible sound and poor picture quality. Very fine dancing, but I haven't been able to watch it through to the end, the production values are so poor.
This is not a ""real"" performance from the stage of the Bolshoi. Rather, this was filmed (taped?) on a sound stage rather than in a theatre. I assumed I would be getting a ""real"" performance from the Bolshoi.
All-in-all, avoid this",1087603200,19,440,4.582278481012659

308015,2,6301005538,"Let me say that Giselle is one of my favorite ballets; I love  Adam's music, the choreography and the story.

I really wanted to like this Giselle;  I could hardly wait to get the DVD home and in the player. However, this shortened movie version of Giselle starring Natalya Bessmertnova and M. Lavrovski was disappointing  to say the least.

I have a several areas of concern with this DVD production... to mention a few

- The sets are ""barebones"" with flat color tones and meager drop back curtains; there is little or no ""scenery"" to give one the feeling of the rustic quaintness that seems to be the norm in other Giselles. The cast almost looks lost on this huge stage.

- The music/audio is flawed: there is an annoying high pitched tinny quality to a lot of the higher notes throughout the entire performance: this is very distracting and although I could diminish this effect by tweaking my audio system,  I could not get this  problem to disappear entirely.

-With the entire ballet only 82 minutes long,  they decided to leave out the Peasant Pas de deux at the end of the Act I....  Need I say more.

-And finally, to me, Giselle has always represented ballet at its emotional best: with Adam's haunting melodies and the beautiful choreography taking the audience the full gambit between initial happiness and gaiety to final sadness and grief. In this production, although the dancing is technically good, it lacks any arousing impact; the performers went through the dance steps,but they didn't seem to be very convincing or committed in their acting. For instance, Bessmertnova tends to look very serious most of the time in the opening  scenes where she is suppose to be flirting and falling in love with Albrecht;  any rare smile seems forced and unnatural. (Then again, the camera settings were often so far back, that it was difficult to see the faces of the participants.)

-On a positive note, however, the Wilis' costumes in Act II were stunning; the skirts were sheer,  moved beautifully with the lifts and generally enhanced the impression of  them being apparitions .

All in all a disappointing DVD, with poor audio, devoid of any real beauty in the stage sets and lacking much emotional punch.

P.S. If you were looking  to buy a Giselle on DVD I'd highly recommend the La Scala version with Alessandra Ferri and Massimo Murru. ( the sets, costumes and emotional content are all 5 stars)",1076716800,36,2413,4.752403846153846
308016,4,6301005538,"This is one of the oldest ballets and this is a great version of it. It's a little slow at some points, but I would recomend it in a heart beat to anybody who liked ballet.",1020643200,3,172,3.8055555555555554
308017,1,6301005538,"I've seen Bessmertmova's Giselle on this video and on stage, simply disapointing. Since she was Bolshoi's former director Grigorovich's wife, it's easy to understand why she was the Bolshoi's ultimate Giselle and Odette, there were so many dancer's much better than this one,(Maximova, Kolpakova,Osipenko). Besmertnova has no technique, and artistically she's always herself,sad and melancholic,(and don't miss her unproportioned,huge hands! makes her port-de-bras always out of line, wrist-cracked). My favorite one? Alessandra Ferri,she's superb!",985046400,6,548,6.418918918918919

7809227,5,6301005538,"I immediately took into account the fact that this was an older recording.  Perhaps because I myself am getting a little gray I responded to the quaint but lovely look of the sets with some nostalgia.  Like being in a theatre of yesteryear when not everything had reached state of the art wizardry.  The dancing is spellbinding and mesmerizing with the dancers charismatic and at the top of their art. This is a very moving version of Giselle that points deeply to the emotional world of innocence, grace and loss.",1477958400,,514,4.688888888888889

7809230,4,6301005538,"Those reviewers who gave this VHS-formatted movie less than four stars were either kind of picky or got a bad copy.  83 minutes is long enough, as much of it was somewhat repetitive.  The ballet is all that it should be: outstanding dancing, sets, precision corps de ballet, acting, and terrific music.  I would have preferred an audience, as I believe that  performers dance better.  Without an audience is like seeing a rehearsal, but no real matter.  As a movie, it was a little more theatrical than I would have liked, in that there were several intended fuzziness to clarity images  My main reason for four stars is that many shots were from a much greater distance than necessary, such as eliminating close-ups of the two main dances in favor of long shots to see an additional  twenty or thirty on stage. I think that the viewer would like to see the detail of the dancing of the two, including the positioning of the feet.",1431302400,,930,4.593939393939394
7809231,1,6301005538,"I would love to see Bessmertnova, no matter what the quality of the film or staging, but unfortunately the disc will not play at all.  Apparently I only had 30 days to try it out and return it, so I'm stuck with a dud copy. Will not want to buy from this supplier again.",1390780800,,270,4.0
7809232,4,6301005538,"Fortunately it is a ballet - one can read the story in the liner notes, and follow the dancing.  The music is gorgeous, and the story interesting.  We enjoyed it a lot!",1359504000,,168,4.21875
7809233,5,6301005538,"A beautiful performance in which the second act is truely sublime.  The dancing of Bessmertnova and Lavrovsky is enthralling, their dancing is amazing but so is their acting ability.  At the end of act two the feeling of loss by Lavrovsky is something I will remember for a long time.  The dancing by the Queen and her Willis is very, very good.  This is one of the best Giselle's I have ever seen, and for the second act - the best.",1292284800,5,433,4.308641975308642
7809234,1,6301005538,"I agree with the other reviewer that this is the best Giselle I have ever seen. The second act, one of the peaks of European culture, is perfection in this version: bathed in moonlight, the young maidens dead before marriage, dance a surreal accompaniment to the tragic love affair of the two principals. The whole hallucinatory effect is supported by the marvelous music of Adolphe Adam: the quintessence of banality. the acme of vacuity, but perfection in this context. An experience to view and review time and again. Utterly divine. I want to givbe it five stars but the Amazon site is defective on my computer and will only accept one for some reason.",1274313600,,656,4.7631578947368425
7809235,5,6301005538,"This is a remarkable document of the great Bolshoi partnership of Mikhail Lavrovsky and Natalya Bessmertnova. An ideal match physically and temperamentally, Lavrovsky and Bessmertnova are splendid as the tragic lovers. Son of the great Soviet choreographer Leonid Lavrovsky who created Romeo and Juliet for Ulanova, Mikhail Lavrovsky has a beautifully proportioned physique, with grace, power and a captivating musical, dramatic style.

There are unfortunately few opportunities to view this great couple.  Their art was captured here and in Romeo and Juliet, but this Giselle is the superior document.  Lavrovsky is convincingly princely, and has an indelible stage presence and virility that match other immortal dancers from this tradition, like Vasiliev and Baryshnikov.  The ethereal Bessmertnova seems light as a feather but displays unparalleled steely strength and perfection, especially in the treacherous second act.

This is my favorite Giselle.  There is another phenomenal version with Makarova and Baryshnikov, but it has yet to see the light of day on DVD.  In spite of all the competition, I still find this performance with Lavrovsky and Bessmertnova to be the most beautifully danced of all Giselles I've seen so far.  The color is weak and the sets minimal, but this performance is on a very high level artistically.",1263340800,12,1335,5.446601941747573
7809236,5,6301005538,"The dancing in this historic performance is stupendous.  Bessmertnova and Lavrovski are both Bolshoi jewels, embodying the athleticism, grace, power and artistic interpretation that exemplified the tradition.  While the colors are washed out and the set is minimal, the quality of the dancing far more than compensates for any visual inconveniences.  Everything is clear and the camera work is ideal for ballet.  The Bolshoi had a renowned tradition of great dancing, and here you see a perfect example of the beautiful artistry that made them legendary throughout the world.

While the affect of the dancers may be more reserved and dignified than some viewers might be used to, the emphasis is on dance as the vehicle for expression, not mime, which may be more exaggerated in other cultures.  The corps is as disciplined and unified as one could want.  All the dancing if superb.  And at this price, it's literally a gift of treasured art history from the USSR.  If a new DVD is released with improved color, all the better.  But this is a valuable historic performance and my favorite Giselle.  By the way, this performance of  Giselle was posted by the Bolshoi Ballet on YouTube as an example of their greatest artists.",1207094400,3,1224,4.946078431372549
