4620132,1,B00593OYB4,"The introduction mix with lot of unusual verbal, loud and unpleasant voice!!! I don't understand it even... But I like Seane demonstration. Seane is a fantastic demonstrator, that's advantage of her. The sequence is really senseless for detox flow. But it's good for beginner without full audio mix.
I'd like to ask why the video starts with about 20 minutes of advertisement? Its something they give this DVD as free gift...
I tried both workout Twist and flow, Purify... Really its not going to work with detox. Well, I agree that She studied Pattabhi jois Ashtanga yoga sequence with someone and use that for her sequence. Actually here the sun salutation A and B help to open your body, after the body opening, her sequence like warm down your body. I may try with traditional sun salutation with detox flow. Lets see, how its work. Anyhow, I'm not going to play this DVD again.",1335571200,3,882,4.733766233766234
4620133,2,B00593OYB4,"I've done both workouts on this DVD, and I enjoyed the moves/poses; I also liked the two different workout options -- 35. min & 60 min. But, honestly, I dread using this video again because I do not want to hear all the lecturing about the environment, about forgiving people, about the ""planet's blessings,"" etc... it almost seemed like it was a lesson on how yoga was the answer to all problems. For me, that is why I go to church and why I read my Bible. I really liked the idea of using this dvd for good flexibility, etc., but I'm not up for the over-the-top lecturing over and over. This is why I find it so difficult to find a good yoga dvd. I will keep looking.",1334361600,3,669,4.1937984496124034
4620134,1,B00593OYB4,"Worst instructional video I have ever used. She talks and talks and talks and moves real fast. I had an extremely difficult time catching up to her and then she is on to the next move.
The video starts with about 20 minutes of advertisement and the next 20 minutes is just watching her move. You must use the remote to find the ""instructional"" part. What a waste. I just wish I could get her address and let her know I will never buy anything with her name on it.",1332979200,4,463,4.155555555555556
4620135,5,B00593OYB4,This is one of favorite yoga practices!  The moves are both relaxing and challenging.  I feel awesome after completing the 2nd practice (65 min) on this DVD.  Totally recommend!,1332115200,6,177,5.0344827586206895
4620136,4,B00593OYB4,"Sean Corn is pretty corny, seriously.

Now, that being said, I LOVE the routines.  I really do.  But I also will be muting her as soon as I learn the routines a little better.  There is a full audio option as well as an option for just audio instructions, but even in that one she manages to start off and end with the sort of ""we are all one"" nonsense that makes me slightly crazy.  See background information at end of review because you may need to completely discredit my opinion on this aspect depending on your personal preferences (i.e. I am not doing yoga for spiritual reasons per se).

Okay, for the positive aspects.  The pace and variety is great.  I love her vinyasas.  I feel like I get a really good, balanced workout and I don't have any trouble keeping up with her and yet still find the routines challenging.  I would recommend adding this DVD to your collection if you can put up with her talking a little too much.

A little background: I'm a beginner at yoga and working out in general, only been doing this stuff for about a year now. I joined a gym last year and while I like using the cardio machines, I have found that the time and effort it takes to get to the gym regularly makes me much less likely to work out 30 mins to an hour 3-5 days a week, which is my goal. So, I am currently seeking at home alternatives.

I started doing yoga at home using Sara Ivanhoe's Candlelight Yoga routine and Jenny Cornero's Yoga for Health, both of which were available on Netflix instant. Thus far they are still my favorite instructors. I'm not really looking for fast yoga routines; I work out in other ways to get my cardio in. I am using yoga to strengthen my body, in particular my back which I've had some issues with, and as a way to work out on days when I'm not feeling the cardio so that I don't just do nothing.",1331337600,9,1837,4.247126436781609
4620137,3,B00593OYB4,"The work is is good and long. But, the commentary about environmentalism distracts from the work out. I'm not one of those kool-aid drinking environmental wackos.",1331251200,4,162,5.269230769230769
4620138,5,B00593OYB4,"I started doing the 35 minute routine at the same time I started a cleanse, so I can't give all the credit to the DVD, but this DVD was part of a huge transformation for me. I have tried to vary my yoga routines, but I always come back to this one because it is just so good. It has the perfect amount of standing poses, stretching, etc. It's not so long that it's too daunting to start. I do it every morning before work and find it makes a huge difference in my overall attitude throughout the day. I am more flexible in every sense of the word. I am kinder to others, and to myself. I think Seane Corn is one of the best yoga instructors out there, I cannot recommend this DVD highly enough!",1330819200,49,694,4.072992700729927
4620139,4,B00593OYB4,"I finally found a Yoga video for actual Beginners (which is why I'm giving it a 4!  I would have given it a 5 but maybe this will give the people at GAIAM something to work towards after reading reviewers feedback).  My favorite was an old Jane Fonda VHS that I can't find on DVD (what a shame!). I've bought countless ""beginner"" Yoga DVDs that aren't quite for Beginners.  While I agree that the production quality is poor for such a well known company (she's in a beautiful place but she's laying on plywood that's placed on a platform with a wrinkled cloth over it, her voice is a bit grating and I could do without the lecture about our environment EVERY TIME I POP IN THE DVD!), I'm not so much focused on that as the movements.  My biggest gripe with ALL workout videos is that I wonder if they realize that consumers will be watching them more than once.  Thus hearing, in this case, about the toxins in our environment etc over and over again actually becomes annoying and disruptive and my peaceful relaxation and stress release turns to frustration and annoyance.  Since I enjoy the workout, and being a problem solver, I play music from Buddha Bar 6 and mute her!  Much nicer!  Again, I'm basing my review on the Yoga, not on the production quality.  So if you're looking for a good stress release, stretching and flexibility Yoga DVD buy this!  But also download some music from Buddha Bar 6 so you can have a nice peaceful and enjoyable time doing it!  :)  Namaste.",1329523200,5,1478,4.473880597014926
4620140,1,B00593OYB4,"I would like to blame the director, but, didn't she preview her own material?

Whatever it is that would account for the awful audio -- the sound mixing, or Ms. Corn's strident, almost lecturing tone as she reads her voice-over script -- I found it remarkably annoying and distracting.  Also, the sequencing is not unique enough to get lost in the practice, so to speak.  I really wanted to like this DVD; Ms. Corn has lovely form and provides a good demonstration of the standard poses, but there is nothing novel enough about the two practices to justify keeping this DVD in my collection when I find myself slipping into grit-my-teeth-asana as I try to concentrate on the music, which can barely be detected behind the grating narration.  A big disappointment.",1329436800,7,763,4.801526717557252

4620156,5,B00593OYB4,"The beginner portion was a little too slow for me but if you want alignment instructions and making sure you are getting in the pose safely and have some varieties, you will benefit from it.  The intermediate portion is right up my alley.  It's a great workout for the mind and the body.  It's challenging which is what I'm looking for at the moment.  Definitely a great buy.",1419552000,2,375,4.470588235294118

This video gives me the option to do a slower, simpler version, or a longer, more powerful version when feeling up to it.",1416182400,,260,3.9056603773584904
4620160,5,B00593OYB4,"I just love Sean Corn. I have 3 of her DVD's and this is my fave by far. I love all 3 but I always come back to this one. You really get a work out with her. She really explains the poses so you're not straining your neck to see the t.v. and what she's doing. I usually do the short version and that really is quite a workout in itself. I've lost weight and I fell so energized after my work out. I have done the long version a few times and you really  sweat it out. There's a down loadable one to your pc that you can also do too, and that one is short but it works. Sean has a soothing voice and I love the calming music. She's is by far I think the best yoga teacher out there. Try it out, you'll love it.",1409702400,5,709,3.7266666666666666
4620161,2,B00593OYB4,"There are two routines on this DVD.  One is easy and the other is more intermediate leaning towards advanced.  I have a number of yoga DVD's and i have to say Seane Corn is not one of my favorite yogi's.  I don't like the way she transitions from one pose to the next, it does not feel natural to me.  Also, her narration is kind of stern. I perfer a more soothing voice.",1406505600,2,371,4.041095890410959

I ordered this DVD after the first day I watched the one my friend loaned me. Seane is great, not annoying like most Yoga DVD's. So happy with my purchase!",1394841600,,269,4.0
4620165,5,B00593OYB4,"I LOVE the commentary that goes along with this including emotional, environmental, and physical alignment and detoxification information.  This is good for all levels as she takes you through the movements with excellent instruction.  I loved it so much I bought four more for gifts!",1392681600,,284,5.288888888888889
4620166,5,B00593OYB4,"This DVD is just as good as all of Seane's others. She is so good at gently reminding you of all the important aspects of why we do yoga, while she walks you through the proper alignment and breathing. She seems to be such a kind soil. Very pleasant DVDs. I would recommend this DVD to anyone",1389830400,,292,4.140350877192983

4620168,5,B00593OYB4,"This is the best Yoga DVD I have bought! Sean Corn talks during the whole thing about leading a healthy lifestyle which you can turn off but I usually listen to it, as it is calming to me. There are two different yoga routines that you can choose from to switch things up. It's fun, relaxing, but also gets me sweating. I definitely recommend!",1386633600,,343,4.375
4620169,3,B00593OYB4,"I thought I would love this because it's Sean Corn, but it's not my favorite. The cues or voice over seems off to me. For instance, at times she gives a cue after she is in the position, which causes me to have to look at the tv. Otherwise, I like this DVD.",1383264000,,257,3.8679245283018866
4620170,4,B00593OYB4,"this is my first seane corn yoga dvd - it is very informative, in a very positive way.  i bought it for my daughter, but because of the great price, i purchased one for myself as well.  i think yoga teachers connect with you or they don't, even on a dvd.  although i didn't really connect with her, she does provide great tips.  it is worth it just for the knowledge she imparts.",1381449600,,379,4.1506849315068495
4620171,5,B00593OYB4,"Sean's style is to explain all poses clearly, never pushing your limits. I appreciate her words of wisdom before and after the yoga series..not too 'woo woo'..just enough words to remind us to care for ourselves and the earth.  There are several diverse sessions on this one dvd. Three women friends have gathered to do this dvd once a week for 3 years!",1380931200,,353,4.603174603174603

4620173,5,B00593OYB4,I love Seane Corne and her instruction. Very precise and accurate. I begun Yoga with her first DVD. When I eventually joined a Yoga class they couldn't believe my good form came from a DVD. This DVD is the next progression. I absolutely love it and totally addicted.,1378339200,,266,4.5625
4620174,5,B00593OYB4,"The 40 minute routine on this disc is pretty gentle. I like to do it on days where my body is just not willing to wake up enough for a good sweat.

However, the hour long routine is pretty intense. I'd say there are quite a few moves that someone who's brand new to yoga would find very intimidating. They're pretty intimidating to me and I'm not brand new. I'd say it's probably an intermediate routine. Some of the standing balance twists are fairly difficult. (Something for me to work towards!) There's a crazy squating twist that is still mind boggling to me, but I did my first wheel pose thanks to this DVD. IT WAS EXHILARATING!

I'd definitely recommend this. Beginners should probably stick to the 40 minute routine until they're comfortable with her style. Then, very carefully, attempt the hour long routine. It's worth it. You'll work up a very nice sweat.",1376092800,16,868,4.62987012987013
4620175,5,B00593OYB4,"I am new to Yoga and found Seane Corn's DVD inspiring, feasible, safe and a perfect way to learn about Vinyasa yoga. She does suggest modifications and doesn't push you to stretch too far, etc. There are two programs and each has the menu option to play with or w/out her in-depth thoughts behind the practice. One program fit my beginner level and the second is longer and I have now worked up to doing.
What I personally like about Seane Corn is that she obviously loves Yoga and the benefits of it and there is no pressure to be an ""athlete"" as some of the other Yoga DVDs seem to advertise. I am now looking towards making Yoga a regular practice for multiple reasons and I definitely recommend this DVD! Enjoy!",1375228800,5,715,4.424242424242424
4620176,4,B00593OYB4,"Before purchasing this DVD (Detox Flow Yoga), I had purchased Seane Corn's audio version of Detox Flow Yoga and it was the BEST yoga instruction I have ever had in terms of positioning the body in the poses and how the body should feel when doing so.  I was so impressed that I wanted the visual version as well.  I am very pleased with the DVD thus far.  I am a beginner (less than one year) yoga student and started out with Sivananda Yoga classes at my local studio.

While she does intersperse her instruction with some commentary on being one with the universe, etc., I don't find it to be annoying or superficial like other videos I have experienced in the past and it kind of goes along with my classes at the yoga studio.  The set is very clean, the music isn't distracting, her outfit is super simple so you can see the moves, and the moves aren't fancy.  This is simple, well-instructed, yoga that I really like and want to do again and again.  While her voice is a tad grating to me, she is calm and direct.  I think one of my favorite aspects of this video is that she is doing a voice over so that she is not trying to talk while doing the moves.  I personally find this to be a lot easier to follow in terms of connecting breath with movement.

I have only done the Twist & Flow sequence so far and find it to be relaxing and really helpful to my upper back.  I tend to hunch my shoulders and this sequence really balances my entire back, not just the lower.  I am looking forward to trying the Purify sequence when I have more time as I've been a bit busy lately.  I like that the sequences are 35 and 65 minutes long with a 10 minute downloadable bonus sequence.  In other words, there really isn't an excuse to do nothing.  Overall, I would highly recommend this DVD.  The only reason I gave this DVD 4 stars instead of 5 is that I felt that her audio version gave much more detailed instruction on how the body should be aligned in the positions, but the instruction is still good.",1374451200,14,1999,4.2348284960422165
4620177,5,B00593OYB4,"This DVD is challenging, but very do-able.  I have been doing the shorter, less intense workout, and I like that there is a more challenging one to work up to.  I like Seane Corn's direction, and that I can choose more abbreviated audio instructions.",1373932800,,250,4.659090909090909

4620180,5,B00593OYB4,Extremely well done alignment and instruction.  Her message is beautiful and I want to internalize it. The poses are not frustratingly difficult. She really does a great job protecting your back with her cueing and alignment.,1366329600,2,225,5.25
4620181,5,B00593OYB4,"I have tried the short flow with both instructional and full audio.  At the same time relaxing and invigorating, it runs through a significant number of poses in a short time with a lot of (detoxifying) twisting.  She offers modifications, reminds you to listen to your body and offers simple suggestions to help with form. On top of that her focus on gratitude and care of the earth is beautiful.  It is the first yoga video that actual motivates me to do yoga at home. I tried it from my  library and bought a copy after my first practice. It feels like a well-thought out and brilliantly organized series of poses.  Thank you so much Sean!!!!",1365552000,4,645,4.525862068965517
4620182,5,B00593OYB4,"I really love this yoga DVD and felt the need to leave a review. I did the beginning part of this DVD for months before even attempting the second, more intermediate level. The second level was so difficult for me, I had to take a few breaks. BUT I stuck with it and now I can get through it with an occasional break. In response to those who say Seane Corn's voice is annoying and too new age with the focus on spirituality, I really don't have a problem with that. I'm an atheist, and I can handle it! I think of yoga as a way to make the mind body connection with no need for actual prayer to a god. This DVD is one I can do all the time and feel challenged every time.",1365033600,4,672,3.948529411764706

4620184,5,B00593OYB4,"I take a very light yoga class at our local junior college, and wanted a routine for home that has a little more movement and flow.  This definitely hits the spot.  She has a calming voice and gives good instruction for placement.  It took me a little while to develop flexibility for all the ""twists"" but can down move through it easily and still feel like it's calming and benefiting me.  Yes there is a lot of talk on the video, of much is about the environment and the food we eat.  However, you can choose instruction only which has the music and workout, with ""most"" of the extra talk gone--not all but mostly just at the beginning and the end.  It doesn't bother me or interfere with my religious beliefs.

Mostly, I do yoga for the stress relief and flexibility.  I""m not doing it for a vigorous work out.

I like her teaching methods and the flow of this dvd so well that I got on amazon to see what others she offers.

I've bought several dvds and this is one of two that motivates me to keep using it.",1363824000,6,1012,4.2513089005235605

4620187,5,B00593OYB4,"I bought this dvd because my favorite yoga teacher recommended it for practicing at home.  After I read some of the other reviews I was a little concerned before I ordered it but what a pleasant surprise! I totally love it! I love the moves especially the 65 minute Purify program.  It makes me feel so good and centered at the end of the practice.  I also enjoy her explaining the benefits of each move and encouraging me to follow a more conscious and healthy lifestyle.  It is good to be reminded of the right things to do.
I would encourage others to give it a try!",1344211200,2,569,4.289719626168225
4620188,5,B00593OYB4,"The DVD has two practices, which are both vinyasa flow:

1) Twist and Flow - 35 minutes
  For advanced beginner. Modified sun salutations, less emphasis on chaturanga dandasana. More focus on seated twists.

2) Purify - 65 minutes
  For intermediate. Lots of sun salutations and a nice variety of poses. More standing twists and standing balance poses.

If my memory is serving me accurately, there are no advanced poses on this DVDs. There are no arm balances, and the closest to an inversion is bridge pose. However, both of these sequences will get your heart rate up, and you will find that there is a great variety.

I would not recommend this DVD to someone who is just starting out, but if you have a couple of months under your belt, you will follow along fine. However, if you already have couple of DVDs and want a nice vinyasa flow, this is a great one.

Some people complain that her voice is annoying. I can understand that, but what she is saying is meaningful, and Seane gives really spot on guidance. You will have an easy time following along, which you can't say for most vinyasa focused DVD. Honestly I could care less what she is saying as long as she is instructing what is happening.",1341360000,35,1205,4.541666666666667
4620189,5,B00593OYB4,"Seane Core is trying to teach the spirit of yoga in this DVD. I like it when we can do yoga in an ancient way. Yoga is not just a system of physical practice. It also helps you to connect to your inner self, peace, beauty and joy. Breathing and mind teaching is very necessary, it helps you to concentrate in your practice, so don't think she talks too much.

I can feel Seane Core a devoted long time yoga practitioner and is eager to share her wisdom with us in this DVD.",1340409600,15,473,4.086021505376344
4620190,5,B00593OYB4,"I'm so confused by the negative feedback i'm reading about this DVD. This program, in my opinion, is informative, soulful, well instructed, and intelligently sequenced. Seane offers a lot of information about dietary and planetary awareness, but if you're not into it, then use the audio track where she just gives the cues! Clearly she was aware that all that information might get redundant after a few listens, so she offers an alternative. What I really found inspiring and unique was the information about emotional toxins, like rage, unresolved grief, etc. and the impact these repressed feelings can have on our health as well. Overall, I found that this DVD not only gave me practical insight, but it was emotional and inspiring too. That's a difficult feat in an hour long program. As far as her voice goes, which seems to be the main complaint, I found it ""real"". It was not that put upon, breathy, pseudo-spiritual tone I often hear in DVD's. It just sounded like she was talking to me, and clearly from her heart. I highly recommend this DVD.",1335744000,84,1054,4.7967032967032965

8462658,5,B00593OYB4,"Bought this in 2014 when I was starting a yoga practice and I still pull it out a few times a year. Sean Corne has a nice, calm delivery with clear instructions. Detox Flow is a great workout that I connected with on a level that convinced me yoga could be helpful - and a habit. Highly recommended.",1515628800,,299,4.172413793103448

8462662,5,B00593OYB4,"I really enjoy doing this Yoga DVD. I definitely feel more energized afterward. There is a short routine that is 35 minutes and a longer routine that is 65 minutes. The movements really flow together and she explains how to do each pose clearly. I also like the fact that she talks about the science behind the different poses, how they affect your body internally and externally. I don't find that the poses are difficult, I think they're appropriate for any level. It's not too fast and not too slow. It takes place in an outdoor setting which I find calming and the music is appropriate for the practice, it's not distracting at all. The one thing I would complain about is the instructor's voice. I don't really find her voice to be soothing, it's somewhat grating in my opinion.",1503532800,,783,4.6
