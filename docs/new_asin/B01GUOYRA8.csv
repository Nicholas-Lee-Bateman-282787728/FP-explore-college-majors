8763581,4,B01GUOYRA8,"Follows the novel closely, although there are some important parts of the novel missing. That is to be expected when a novel is made into a film.",1486598400,,145,4.407407407407407
8763582,3,B01GUOYRA8,"This is an 8 hr miniseries from Russia and contains all the details of the novel. Its all here for those of you who have read and loved Crime and Punishment.
For those who know Russian, this is a 5 star performance. However if you know no Russian and if you have not read Crime and Punishment recently, this will be largely not understandable. This is because the English subtitles are for the most part in such terrible English that they often can't be understood. And there is no time to try to figure them out because they flash across the screen so fast. Considering the poor subtitles I give this an overall rating of three stars.",1473120000,3,635,4.435897435897436
8763583,5,B01GUOYRA8,"If you are a fan of great Russian novels put to screen then this is for you. Wow this movie is intense! Vladimir Koshevoy plays Raskolnikov like he was made for the role. I speak Russian and I found the subtitles a little humorous at times because they definitely did not match what was being said, and they were misspelling English words throughout the movie, but that's ok because I am listening to the dialogue mainly. I don't feel I should say anymore because movies like this need to be experienced for yourself, but WOW!! Heavy!! Oh and Koshevoy is a hottie in my opinion!",1467763200,,578,4.514285714285714
8763584,1,B01GUOYRA8,"A real TURKEY!! a travesty... good visuals and acting, but every time there is some dialog about Christ or God or whatever, the HOLY JOE music comes on in the  background complete with chorus and full orchestra... a sickeningly sentimentalized interpretation that would make Dostoevsky puke... don't bother with it.",1438560000,,315,5.3
8763585,4,B01GUOYRA8,"PLEASE for the love of the Dostoyevskiy go and read the Epilogue!!!

SPOILER ALERT(!)

First, this is pretty good adaptation and I would recommend it. Of course there is nothing like reading the book itself. Honestly I would recommend reading/listening on audio to, the book itself first. There are quite a few parts that are omitted. What's more, most of the torture by conscience is not very well conveyed in the movie, nor is it possible to express it in a film. That's why reading is way better.
Second, besides that the move seems to be pretty good considering all the challenges a producers would face to put this classic on screen. I would not even expect to come close to the novel. But as far as they tried it was not bad.

Now, the biggest and most fundamental flaw with the movie is the ending. The ending in a movie and the ending in a book are pretty much draw diametrically opposite conclusions. A movie ends up with nihilistic, dare I say pathetic, unrepentant, and stubborn person who only regrets that he did not have perseverance to be what would later would be Nietzsche's &Uuml;bermensch. Well, Doestoyevskiy of course was not nihilist or atheist to draw such conclusions. As the matter of fact, the whole and sole point of the work is to demonstrate futility and agony of going against God's moral order and conscience. It is ingrained on such a deep level that fighting it is basically fighting most fundamental fabric of that aspect of knowledge available to all - namely conscience. So...
If you have NOT read the original work, and only watched this, you will have very narrow understanding and appreciation of the author and the novel. PLEASE read at least the epilogue, because one in the movie is absolutely wrong. I don't know if it was motivated by author's ideological sympathy to either atheism, nihilism, or both, but it certainly does not convey the author intent at all.

Here's an excerpt from the very end of the epologue for you if you're lazy to search it on the web:

---------------------------------------------------------------------
...
Again it was a warm bright day. Early in the morning, at six o'clock, he went off to work on the river bank, where they used to pound alabaster and where there was a kiln for baking it in a shed. There were only three of them sent. One of the convicts went with the guard to the fortress to fetch a tool; the other began getting the wood ready and laying it in the kiln. Raskolnikov came out of the shed on to the river bank, sat down on a heap of logs by the shed and began gazing at the wide deserted river. From the high bank a broad landscape opened before him, the sound of singing floated faintly audible from the other bank. In the vast steppe, bathed in sunshine, he could just see, like black specks, the nomads' tents. There there was freedom, there other men were living, utterly unlike those here; there time itself seemed to stand still, as though the age of Abraham and his flocks had not passed. Raskolnikov sat gazing, his thoughts passed into day-dreams, into contemplation; he thought of nothing, but a vague restlessness excited and troubled him. Suddenly he found Sonia beside him; she had come up noiselessly and sat down at his side. It was still quite early; the morning chill was still keen. She wore her poor old burnous and the green shawl; her face still showed signs of illness, it was thinner and paler. She gave him a joyful smile of welcome, but held out her hand with her usual timidity. She was always timid of holding out her hand to him and sometimes did not offer it at all, as though afraid he would repel it. He always took her hand as though with repugnance, always seemed vexed to meet her and was sometimes obstinately silent throughout her visit. Sometimes she trembled before him and went away deeply grieved. But now their hands did not part. He stole a rapid glance at her and dropped his eyes on the ground without speaking. They were alone, no one had seen them. The guard had turned away for the time.

How it happened he did not know. But all at once something seemed to seize him and fling him at her feet. He wept and threw his arms round her knees. For the first instant she was terribly frightened and she turned pale. She jumped up and looked at him trembling. But at the same moment she understood, and a light of infinite happiness came into her eyes. She knew and had no doubt that he loved her beyond everything and that at last the moment had come. . . .

They wanted to speak, but could not; tears stood in their eyes. They were both pale and thin; but those sick pale faces were bright with the dawn of a new future, of a full resurrection into a new life. They were renewed by love; the heart of each held infinite sources of life for the heart of the other.

They resolved to wait and be patient. They had another seven years to wait, and what terrible suffering and what infinite happiness before them! But he had risen again and he knew it and felt it in all his being, while she--she only lived in his life.

On the evening of the same day, when the barracks were locked, Raskolnikov lay on his plank bed and thought of her. He had even fancied that day that all the convicts who had been his enemies looked at him differently; he had even entered into talk with them and they answered him in a friendly way. He remembered that now, and thought it was bound to be so. Wasn't everything now bound to be changed?

He thought of her. He remembered how continually he had tormented her and wounded her heart. He remembered her pale and thin little face. But these recollections scarcely troubled him now; he knew with what infinite love he would now repay all her sufferings. And what were all, /all/ the agonies of the past! Everything, even his crime, his sentence and imprisonment, seemed to him now in the first rush of feeling an external, strange fact with which he had no concern. But he could not think for long together of anything that evening, and he could not have analysed anything consciously; he was simply feeling. Life had stepped into the place of theory and something quite different would work itself out in his mind.

Under his pillow lay the New Testament. He took it up mechanically. The book belonged to Sonia; it was the one from which she had read the raising of Lazarus to him. At first he was afraid that she would worry him about religion, would talk about the gospel and pester him with books. But to his great surprise she had not once approached the subject and had not even offered him the Testament. He had asked her for it himself not long before his illness and she brought him the book without a word. Till now he had not opened it.

He did not open it now, but one thought passed through his mind: ""Can her convictions not be mine now? Her feelings, her aspirations at least. . . .""

She too had been greatly agitated that day, and at night she was taken ill again. But she was so happy--and so unexpectedly happy--that she was almost frightened of her happiness. Seven years, /only/ seven years! At the beginning of their happiness at some moments they were both ready to look on those seven years as though they were seven days. He did not know that the new life would not be given him for nothing, that he would have to pay dearly for it, that it would cost him great striving, great suffering.

But that is the beginning of a new story--the story of the gradual renewal of a man, the story of his gradual regeneration, of his passing from one world into another, of his initiation into a new unknown life. That might be the subject of a new story, but our present story is ended.
---------------------------------------------------------------------

If you seen the movie, and read this, you will clearly see that ending in the movie sucks very bad. Other than ending, the movie is certainly worth watching!",1335484800,9,7894,4.525946704067321
8763586,3,B01GUOYRA8,"I rate this three stars because I like the movie and the quality of the DVD is good. It is in Russian language with English subtitles. The translations are, in a lot of cases, are ridiculous though often very funny. However, if you do not understand Russian or are not a student of the language, you my not find it amusing and you will find it very difficult to follow a very complex story line. So beware: If you do not understand Russian you will more than likely be very disappointed with this movie

I believe the acting roles are performed nearly as good as in the John Hurt version of Crime and Punishment.  The Hurt version also has the advantage of being in English.",1294617600,10,674,4.384
8763587,5,B01GUOYRA8,"Let's face it, it's a daunting task attempting to dramatise this extraordinary and complex novel. And this is not a bad attempt. It's not a great attempt either. It looks low budget. I'd love to see a big budget production.
Raskolnikov's crime is graphically illustrated in all its gory awfulness. It really 'looks' shocking. More shocking than in the novel.
Real violence is always disgusting and the scene of the axe murders made me turn my head away. I couldn't watch it. The victims, particularly the pathetic Lizaveta, look vulnerable and pathetic. Authentic but sickening reality.
Porfiry Petrovitch is masterfully acted by Andrey Panin. It is not an easy role. Dounia and Sonia are weakly portrayed, but it might be said they are weak, unconvincing characters by Dostoevsky's standards. Perhaps that is too harsh. The long suffering Sonia reminds me of Mary Magdalene to Raskolnikov's anti-Christ.
But for me the revelation was Svidrigailov, played by Aleksandr Baluev. Here we see the contrast between the high thinking 'good' man, Raskolnikov, who brutally murders in cold blood for a notion of greatness; and the morally corrupt, nefarious low man, Svidrigailov, who is willing to sacrifice himself just to be loved. The good man shuns love and kills; the bad man kills himself for love. The good man gives charity to imagine himself great and powerful, the bad man gives away his fortune to poor orphans and seeks no reward and no thanks. It precisely begs the question: 'who is good and who is bad? and who are we to judge so readily?'
And the immoral man, Svidgailov, has the courage to commit suicide for his transgressions, but the 'extraordinary' and 'great' man, Raskolnikov, does not.
Interestingly the ending differs from the book. In the novel R gets a ludicrously light sentence, 7 years in Siberia, and converts to Christianity. In this adaptation he does not find God.
I always thought an alternative ending might be for a fellow prisoner to give R the chop! The conclusion is unsatisfactory on so many levels, but I presume the author was displaying his belief that a repentant sinner should be forgiven. Dostoevsky was ultimately a religious man.
The whole production does look like it was made on the cheap but saying that it was realistic and redolent of 1866 with all the concomitant horrors of disease and poverty.
And the acting is, by and large, excellent.
Well worth watching.",1289088000,7,2408,4.962871287128713
