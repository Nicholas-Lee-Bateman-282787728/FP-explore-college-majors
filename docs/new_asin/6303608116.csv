7851291,4,6303608116,"The plot revolves around a terrorist group that's kidnapping and killing, and when the daughter of Don Mario's (Mario Almada) best friend is abducted, and Arturo (Roberto Ballesteros) comes on the scene, the chase begins. Ballesteros, who looks a little like Tom Berenger con ms sal y pimienta, does well carrying the film in the action sequences, and Almada is gnarled, grizzly, and great.
Filmed in Nayarit, on the West coast of Mexico, the scenery is utterly gorgeous, and the soundtrack by Claudio Brugger and Juan Carlos Morelli excellent for this genre. As a film, this isn't a grand work of art, but it's fun and lively entertainment.",972604800,,641,4.944444444444445
