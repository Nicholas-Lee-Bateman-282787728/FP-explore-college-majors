8609790,3,B000BTLQ6W,"The set contains 3 DVDs.  Each DVD focuses on 2 major areas and there are 5-6 tips for each area, with demo movie and step by step explanation for each tip.

It gives a nice but brief introduction to techniques for use in different terrains.  I think it is best suited for intermediate skiers who starts to ski off piste.  They are the ones who will benefit most from the tips.",1140912000,,377,4.267605633802817
8609791,4,B000BTLQ6W,"Chris Fellow's DVD on all-mountain tactics is a usefully compilation of the tricks the pros use to navigate the mountain.  Take it for what it is - a collection of ""tips-of-the day"", used on networks like RSN.  It isn't really designed to improve your technique, for that nothing works like personal time with a great coach.  A-MST is designed to give you a bigger bag of tricks and that it does.

In my opinion, Chris' video can be used for two things;  One, it is full of helpful tips that will help advanced skiers move the the mountain with much more confidence.  Secondly, it will arm any skier with a foundation of knowledge that could be brought into a lesson for further development.

Additionally, All-Mountain Skiing Tactics is full of great skiing images.  Chris is one of the best skiers on the PSIA National Demo Team and watching him ski through terrain is worth the price alone.

I hope you enjoy the video.",1133222400,3,922,4.607361963190184
