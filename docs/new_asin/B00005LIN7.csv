7943872,3,B00005LIN7,"You gotta give the creators of this movie some credit. They gave you the run down of the story within the two characters... Tweedle Dum and Marisa Tomei wannabe. Its not bad for a short, I wouldn't buy it, and I wouldn't see it ever again, but I would recommend for watching once in your lifetime, to get an idea for starters in the Independent Movie filmaking process. Its good for a beginner, its bad if you think you;re gonna be a star.  The best part is when the two siblings start shooting down like a mafia movie in a western. Angela got smooth karate chop kicks and her Sally got two glocks underneath his armpits. Sally knows how to hold them, but he sure can't shoot straight, hehe.",992304000,,691,4.3565891472868215
