3722699,5,B001NPK5BU,"One of the last of the truly great family sitcoms, I remember watching Mr. Belvedere on Friday nights during its first-run.  I didn't even know it was being released on DVD until I was in the store the other day and saw it!!  I grabbed it immediately, almost leaping with joy out to my car!

Its even better than I remember.  This is a sitcom that was truly a ""family"" show.  All members of the cast had great chemistry together!!  No wonder the series became a huge hit!!

Its decent, yet heartwarming and even inspiring ""controversial"" episodes that are dealt with in a sensitive, loving way.  The series isn't mawkishly sentimental either.  Its just good, clean, wholesome fun.  Best of all......it is FUNNY!!!!  Watching Mr. Belvedere one-up everyone or the multi-talented Brice Beckham as Wesley steal the show makes for great classic television.

I also remember thinking how pretty Tracy Wells (Heather) was and how clean-cut and handsome Rob Stone (Kevin) was (he still is).

This is an awesome family show and I hope we won't be disappointed in the fact that companies have the habit of releasing great shows like this for one or two seasons....then don't release the rest of them.  Bring the rest of the seasons of this great, classic family sitcom on.....pronto!!",1240358400,4,1274,4.837962962962963
3722700,5,B001NPK5BU,I personally had never seen Mr. Belvedere before. Someone had mentioned it to me so I gave it a try. I was intrigued. It's truly a classy show with heart. Something the whole family could watch. I loved it!,1238198400,6,206,4.3076923076923075
3722701,5,B001NPK5BU,"Shout! has done another excellent job with their release of Mr Belvedere seasons one & two.  The episodes are all the original network episodes, not syndicated cuts.  The original opening credits have been restored, inculding the original pilot opening.  No music is replaced.  The video is for the most part fine.  Occasionally there is a blurry spot but the show is over 20 years old.  The audio sounds fine also, but occasionally the sound is slightly lower in some spots.

Now for the show itself.  I watched this show when it originally aired and haven't seen it much in syndication since.  My memory of the show is mostly from it's original network run.  I loved the show then but wasn't mature enough to fully appreciate it's humor.  After watching this set I enjoyed the show even more than I remembered.  As an adult I can catch the adult jokes that I missed when I was a kid.  This show is as entertaining to adults as it is to a younger audience.  It holds up well.  I watched episode after episode not wanting to come to the end and enjoying every second of it.

The set does have special features.  There are interviews with the surviving cast members (minus Tracy Wells).  They talk about how much fun they had on the show, including the pranks they played on each other.  They talk of their fond memories and how they are still rmeembered to this day for their Mr Belvedere roles.  Hopefully future sets will have an interview with Tracy Wells.  The other special feature is the SNL Mr Belvedere fan club skit.  That has nothing to do with the show, but it is hysterically funny.  Tom Hanks is in it. The set also features two clips Family Guy in which Stewie sings the Mr Belvedere theme song.  This is also mentioned in the interviews.

If anyone is on the fence about buying this set and worrying that they won't enjoy it as much as they remember, worry no more.  The show is better than remembered.  A few plots may be dated but as a whole the show stands up very well.  You won't be disappointed.",1238198400,37,2016,4.464285714285714
3722702,5,B001NPK5BU,"This is one of my favorite shows in the 80's. I enjoy Mr. Belvedere's sarcasm and his odd relationship with George (Bob Uecker). My favorite episode is on Season 2 called 'Valentine's Day'. Check out the young Stacy Ferguson (of Black Eyed Peas) in this episode. Also the band 'Young Savages' is hilarious. I can watch this episode over and over.

3722704,5,B001NPK5BU,I was just sitting around arguing with my friends about Mr. Belvedere not being on DVD.  I have been waiting 3 years for this show to come out on dvd.

3722706,5,B001NPK5BU,"If you're sick and tired of today's un-funny and truly mean comedies that are billed as ""family sitcoms,"" then this DVD release of Mr. Belvedere from the mid-1980s is for you.

Mr. Belvedere had heart. A Classic TV Family Sitcom that remains vastly underrated, it was based on the Gwen Davenport novel, ""Belvedere,"" which also had spawned two much earlier movie adaptations. The TV series brought a high-brow Englishman to work as a live-in nanny for a middle-class American family. It ran Friday night's on ABC from 1985 to 1990.

It starred Christopher Hewitt, who portrayed Lynn Aloysis Belvedere, a very proper Englishman who had worked for the British gentry, including Winston Churchill and English royalty. The series begins when Belvedere shows up at doorstep of  the American residence of George Owens on a very cold and snowy December night. Ownes, played surprisingly well by George Uecker, portrayed exactly what he was in real-life: a former Major League Baseball player and sportscaster.

George's wife on the series, Marsha Cameron Owens, played by Ilene Graff, as well as their three children, immediately fall under the charm of Mr. Belvedere. The same cannot be said of George, who has the exact opposite response to Belvedere, and the feeling is decidedly mutual. Nonetheless, Mr. Belvedere is hired and the rest is Classic TV history.

Much of the series involves the conflict between George and Mr. Belvedere, but also the interaction of the ""stuffy"" British servant with Marsha, who is also a law student, and the children: Wesley T. Owens, played by Brice Beckham; Kevin Owens, played by Rob Stone; and Heather Owens, played by Tracy Wells. Especially compelling is the relationship that evolves between Belvedere and the spirited and wise-cracking Wesley.

At the end of most episodes, Belvedere is seen relaxing in his room in the evenings after the children are in bed, recording their ""everyday"" experiences in his diary for future use for a novel he is writing!

A mid-season replacement series that premiered in the middle of March 1985, the first season had only seven episodes. This boxed set includes those episodes and the Complete Second Season, which had 22 episodes.

Season One episodes are: Stranger in the Night, the pilot that introduces the characters; The Outcasts; Gotta Dance; Gorgeous George; What I Did for Love; The Lost Weekend; and Sweet Charity.

Season Two episodes are: The Lion Sleeps Tonight; Tornado; Cheerleader; Requiem; Delivery; The Contract; Vows; Strike; The Letter; Pinball; The Prize; Speechless; The Teacher; The Dropout; Rivals; Wesley's Friend; The Will; Valentine's Day; Heather's Tutor; Amish; Dinner for Two; and The Play.",1231200000,28,2691,5.196304849884527

BELVEDERE showed a lot about true parenthood, the difference between right & wrong, especially where children are concerned throughout its whole 6-year run on ABC, just like GROWING PAINS did.

Nice to look back to a less Complicated way of Life when everything was a lot more Peaceful and even Innocent and Sweet.

I did had a Problem with Two of the DVDs been Scratched, we couldn't watch some of the Shows, however, in just a Matter of Two ""Clicks"" Amazon.com and ""Returns are Easy"" Policy took care of Everything!

3722734,2,B001NPK5BU,"I loved Mr. Belvedere as a kid growing up in the 1980's.  But after it was cancelled, I don't know that I've ever seen an episode in syndication.  So, when I stumbled upon this DVD set of Seasons 1 and 2 on Amazon, I was really excited to experience this show again, after a 20+ year hiatus.  I could not have been more disappointed.

My greatest frustration was the ridiculously poor writing and directing on this show.  The dialogue is so fake and the directing choices are so artificial or downright lazy.  It's laughable in all the wrong ways.  And the acting wasn't much better (though I'm not sure they could have done much better with those scripts).  Mr. Belvedere's response to every line from the Owens family was either an eye-roll or a lifted eye-brow.  Seriously, he does each of those maneuvers a dozen times in each episode.

Of course, not everything about the show was terrible.  The theme song remains one of the most memorable theme songs in sitcom history (sung by Leon Redbone), and it's been running through my head constantly since I began watching these episodes (which I don't mind at all).  And there were a few sweet moments that were actually quite endearing.  But I'd say that I probably laughed less than once per episode, on average, which is a dreadfully low chuckle-rate for a comedy series.

Just to be clear, I really wanted to love this show again.  But after suffering through every episode of these first two seasons, I just can't fake it.  Unlike other sitcoms from the 80's (like Perfect Strangers which remains charming and funny and The Cosby Show which remains brilliantly written and acted), Mr. Belvedere has aged very poorly.  Rather than a nostalgic reentry to a show that I once enjoyed, Belvedere turns out to be out-dated, cheesy, heavy-handed, poorly executed, and decidedly unfunny.  I'd recommend that folks with a hint of sweet memories of the show just listen to the theme song a few times, rather than wading through this rather forgettable sitcom from an era of television history that we've thankfully left behind.",1303862400,4,2072,4.772471910112359
3722735,5,B001NPK5BU,"Love this show even though I didn't watch many episodes during it's original run('85-90). Chris Hewitt is terrific with his dead pan aristrocratic zingers and Brice Beckham always delivers his lines with that devlish smirk. The two of them work off each other beautifully. It may not have been one of the most popular sitcoms from that era like say Family Ties, Who's The Boss or Growing Pains but it's still endearing, entertaining and funny all these years later. SHOUT did a great job with this set. I was surprised how good the transfers looked for an 80's sitcom and the audio is excellent all the dialogue came in loud and clear.

PS Irene Graff was and still is sexy as hell. :)))

Thank You Mr Belvedere for the great memories and RIP my dear freind!!",1301788800,,759,4.573529411764706
3722736,5,B001NPK5BU,"""Mr. Belvedere"" was always one of my very favorite shows growing up. I enjoyed it because the series presented a real family with real problems in a way that was always funny and down-to-earth. The series stars the late and very talented and much-loved Christopher Hewett in the title role as Mr. Belvedere. He always offered a touch of eccentricity to the Owens family, yet he was often always the voice of reason.

Wesley (Brice Beckhman) was the Bart Simpson of the '80s. He was always getting into mischief (like painting his sister's face to look like an Easter egg) and it was always Mr. Belvedere's responsibility to teach him a lesson.

This is a 5-DVD set of the first 2 seasons of this classic '80s sitcom. By the way, take a look at the scan of the DVDs that I posted. Included are a total of 29 eps, these are the complete an unedited shows with the original opening and closing credits.

Some of my favorite eps are probably some of yours as well:

The Play - Mr. Belvedere directs Wesley's school play

Amish - Kevin (Rob Stone) meets a young lady from an Amish background.

The Letter - Kevin moves out on Thanksgiving Eve after harboring some hurt feelings his George's (Bob Uecker) interest in football.

Also included in this set is a new interview with Ilene Graff (Marsha), Bob Uecker, Bob Stone and Brice Beckham. Tracy Wells (Heather) does not participate in the interview but she did give commentary on further sets. There is also an SNL sketch with Tom Hanks about ""Mr. Belvedere"" included on the S1/2 set.

What I also love about ""Mr. Belvedere"" is that it is just so '80s. The big hair, the corny jokes, the ""Duran Duran"" references and that huge '80s style kitchen with that huge wraparound counter that I think all family sitcoms from the '80s had.

The series ran for a total of 6 seasons, so far Shout! has put out the first 4. Let's hope they release the final 2 because this is one of the best family sitcoms of the '80s.",1301184000,,1953,4.494350282485875
3722737,5,B001NPK5BU,"The DVD set itself:
Simple but nicely packaged set. I am a big fan of these slim cases with a disc on each side. This set comes with 3 cases,the last holds on the one disc,the 5th and last. They are the best way to package multiple disc sets,because it keeps the discs very protected.
The episode picture and sound quality are PERFECT,it is really hard to beleive this is from something back in the 80s.

The SHOW itself:
I love my sitcoms and I mean the CLASSIC eras of the 60s,70s and 80s.
You know,back when they where actually REALLY funny,well written and each had their own great gimmick or something else to make them one of a kind.

Well I can truly say this is one of those classics. I hadn't seen the show literally since I was a kid,back when it originally aired but I always remebered enjoying it. So with all the sitcom dvds I collect,I finally decided to take a shot with Belvedere.

So? It arrived in the mail two days ago and so far I am halfway through disc two. Christopher Hewett(Belvedere himself)plays such a great character in so many ways. The rest of the cast all pitch in with their own individual character traits and really create a humorous YET believable family.

And that is such a great thing about this show to,I think it would appeal to just about any age.

So I purchased this season 1&2 set and I am most certainly going to collect the other 4 seasons.",1297296000,,1387,4.3604651162790695
3722738,4,B001NPK5BU,"""Mr. Belvedere"" was created at a time when television didn't have to hit you over the head to make a point.  It was also a time when TV dealt with moral issues and ""Mr. Belvedere"" consistantly puts out good moral lessons.

A proper Britishman comes to be the housekeeper for George and Marsha Owens, he is employed full-time, she is a full-time student in law school.  Immediately Mr. Belvedere clashes with George.  This back and forth between George and Belvedere (his first name is Lynn) is played out very well as the couple's young son Wesley (9) begins to see both as his mentors; with his Dad remaining his main concept of manhood, but with Mr. Belvedere being a unique perspective to come to for ideas and advice.

The Owens also have a teenage son (17) and daughter (15).  There son is a nice enough fellow, but seems a sandwich short of a picnic much of the time.  The girl is eager to be an independent woman.  These children, too, benefit from Belvedere's reasoning skills.

The series is everything television has stopped being.  There is warmth, love, characters that you wish you knew in the real world, and a tremendous amount of belly-laugh humor.  A standout espisode is ""Pinball"", one that does not show Mr. Belvedere in a good light as he becomes addicted to playing pinball and neglects his duties.  This adds realism to Mr. Belvedere because he is not a superman who never falls, but a regular person who is generally reliable, but has his weaknesses, too.

This first installment features the first season (which came in as a mid-season replacement) and the entire second season.  Great for fans and newcomers.",1275955200,,1633,4.724381625441696

As Belvedere notes in his journal entry: ""Although the individual members seem well intentioned enough, they do seem a bit out of touch with each other. But with a certain amount of patience and direction, I'm sure I can whip them into shape...even George. They're damn lucky to have me"".

Indeed. And thanks to Shout! Factory (props to DVD producer Brian Blum), the show's fans are lucky to have him finally on DVD. Mr. Belvedere - Seasons One & Two is a 5-disc (single-sided) set featuring the show's first 29 episodes (all 7 from Season One, plus all 22 from Season Two); Full Frame (1.33:1) video; plus the following Special Features: New Interviews with the Cast, and Saturday Night Live - Mr. Belvedere Fan Club sketch.

The discs are housed in 3 slimcases inside a handsomely designed [brown] slim outer box. Disc 1 contains Season One Episodes 1-7, Disc 2: Season Two Episodes 1-6, Disc 3: Episodes 7-11, Disc 4: Episodes 12-17, Disc 5: 18-22 plus Bonus Features.

3722744,4,B001NPK5BU,"One of the best family sitcoms of all time. ""Mr Belvedere"" may not have garnered the fame and acclaim of ""The Cosby Show,"" but I actually preferred its down-to-earth humor, practicality and realism. Fantastic that's it's now on DVD release. One gripe, though: some episodes form both seasons ARE MISSING!!!",1253577600,,306,5.14
3722745,5,B001NPK5BU,"I just happen to come across Mr. Belvedere as I was looking at Everybody Loves Raymond.  Ray's mom played a part in a Belvedere episode so I had to look up Mr. Belvedere.  I don't think I have to see the DVD to make any comments on it.  I absolutely loved that show.  If I was going to be out when it came on, I'd tape it so I could see it later.  I loved the show because here we have a snooty Brit coming into a dysfunctional American family and turns them around.  I particularly liked the way Mr. Belvedere handled situations.  He didn't lay down rules and regulations but contended with the little brat, Wesley, in much the same way I contended with some of my students who wanted to give up.  He gave Wesley ideas in such a way that he would and could make his own decisions.  He did the same with the other children.  Mr. Belvedere was the savior so to speak of the Owens household.  I live in the UK and I notice that this DVD is only for the US and Canada.  As soon as I finish this review, I'm ordering it just to have it.  There were times when I laughed so hard, tears came to my eyes.  There were other times that my eyes watered because some episodes were very touching like the episode when Wesley caused Mr. Belvedere to be admitted to the hospital.  At the end, Wesley was at Belvedere's bedside pouring his heart out with sorrow and remorse for what he did.  Despite the snotty little brat Wesley was, he still had that sensitive side to him.  I'm glad to see Mr. Belvedere is finally on DVD.  Now I can watch it over and over and over.  If you're into comedy, this is the DVD set for you.  I don't usually buy TV program DVDs but this one I am definately getting.",1248134400,,1682,4.132716049382716

3722748,4,B001NPK5BU,"1985. What a wonderful year it was. It was definitley a joy and a treat to be a little kid in this era. 1985 was no exception. This was the year that brought us ""Back To The Future"", ""The Goonies"", ""The Breakfast Club"", and so much more. Tears For Fears, Wham!, Madonna, and others were ruling the music charts. And on TV, ""The Cosby Show"", ""Family Ties"", ""Cheers"" and many more were taking over your living room. 1985 also brought us another family sitcom, a type of sitcom prevalent in the 1980's, and this one featured a prim and proper english butler. A butler named Mr. Belvedere. Lynn Belvedere, to be exact.

""Mr. Belvedere"" premiered as a mid season replacement on ABC on March 15, 1985. Here is the set up : The Owens family are a typical family household, five members, and living in the suburbs of Pittsburgh. Dad George Owens(Bob Uecker, ""Major League"")is a sports columnist. Mom is Marsha Ownes(Ilene Graff), a mother and wife who is going to school to become a lawyer. And what is a family sitcoms without the kids?. The Owens family has three kids. Teenagers Kevin(Rob Stone)and Heather(Tracy Wells), and little Wesley(Brice Beckham). The parents have their hands full, and need a little help. Mr. Belvedere(Christopher Hewitt)lands on their doorstep just in time and, with some shoving by the others to George, becomes the new Owens housekeeper.

""Mr. Belvedere"" was not a major hit, and from what I hear, struggled to stay on the air for it's six seasons. It is a fondly remembered series from my youth, and it is wonderful to see that it has held up surprisingly well. The first episode, ""Stranger In The Night"", sets things up and gets it going. Belvedere makes an impression on the family members, mainly Marsha and the kids, but tough 'ol George hasn't been swayed. When he finally is, the next 6 seasons are set in motion. And with this set, you get the first two seasons. 29 episodes in all. And what do these two seasons hold in the zany chaos of the Owens household?. Read on....

Season one, being a mid season show, was pretty short. 7 episodes in all. Wesley is front and center in a few episodes, such as not being invited to a friend's birthday party in ""The Outcasts"", to trying out for the ballet instead of football in ""Gotta Dance"". Heather and Kevin get their turns too. Kevin tries to win over a girl in ""What I Did For Love"". As the 6 seasons go on, this will be a recurring theme for Kevin. Sometimes his endeavors are funny, sometimes a little scary. Heather, along with Wesley, brings a homeless lady to the house in the season one finale, ""Sweet Charity"". Season 2 has one of the most remembered and talked about episodes of the show. In the episode ""Wesley's Friend"", Wes discovers a friend of his has AIDS. It was one of, if not the first, series, especially a sitcom, to cover such a topic. It would of been pretty daring and risky back in 1985, but the episode handles the subject very well, as Belvedere helps others to understand the disease and the real facts of it. A tornado also hits the Ownes residence in, fittingly enough, ""Tornado"". More ""special episode"" material can be found in ""The Contract"", about drinking and driving. The romantic side for the oldest Owens kids take some interesting turns when Heather falls for her blind tutot in ""Heather's Tutor"", and Kevin falls for an amish girl and decides to live like one in ""Amish"". Oh these episode titles. Right to the point!. And lots, lots more!.

""Mr. Belvedere"" may not of got the acclaim, may of taken a lot of pot shots, but the series was always better than you'd think. Sure, it could be corny and syrupy(but who says that is always a bad thing?), but it had an edge to it. Maybe 'edge' is not the appropriate word, but there are times where the show seems to know what it is and has some fun with it. There probably weren't too many family shows where, in the pilot, Wesley mentions his dad's girlie magazines and Belvedere, having just met Wesley, asks Marsha if it was a rough pregnancy. It's little things like this, and better ones, that were peppered throughout the series. It may seem tame by today's standards, but there seemed to be something a lot better going on than what occasional/non watchers or overly critical people may of thought. Not that I am praising the series as the greatest thing since sliced bread, but it was good for what it was, better than some may give it credit for, and deserving of a little more attention than it got. While the Huxtables and Keatons and Seavers were the families of the 80's, the Owens family held their own, week to week, on their little show that could. It also benefitted from a pretty solid cast. Every one held their own, and seemed comfortable as a family, but the spotlight usually goes to Christopher Hewitt and Brice Beckham, as Belvedere and Wesley. The banter between the english housekeeper and George was fun and amusing, but the relationship between Belvedere and Wesley was the most interesting. Beckham was a very good child actor. Wes could be real bratty(I believe some have said ""devil child"" as well), but Beckahm was good at it. Hewitt was wonderful, and even though it seemed he and Wesley were constantly at each other's throats, you knew that they really, really cared for each other.

The final disc boasts some extra features. The first is a pretty quick featurette with the cast of the show(sadly, Hewitt has passed away, and Tracy Wells is nowhere to be seen). Uecker, Graff(who will surprise you as she has seemingly not aged a day since the series went off the air in 1990), Beckham, and Stone, all share stories. What's really wonderful is that they got along and still stay in contact like a family to this day. The other featurette is a skit from 'Saturday Night Live' about Belvedere, and it features Tom Hanks. Also, if you click on Mr. Belvedere's head on the last disc, you will find an Easter egg.

In the end, ""Mr. Belvedere"" may not of been the most popular of 1980's family sitcoms, a decade which was packed with them, nor was it groundbreaking television. But it was a nice, sweet, entertaining little show that has held it's simple charm all these years later.",1241395200,11,6172,4.596188747731397

8327748,5,B001NPK5BU,"For once this wasn't a seller problem. Now remember boys and girls, don't leave the case for your Mr. Belvidere DVDs in the middle of the floor where people can step on them.

Mr. Belvidere was not designed to be Masterpiece Theatre. In plot, its fairly simple. The ins and outs of a typical American family who happen to be able to somehow afford an English housekeeper. Theres plenty of lighthearted silly that just caused hours and hours to melt away. But I thought the episode they did where Wesleys friend had AIDS really struck the right mix of humor with the very real stigma that was surrounding AIDS at the time and still resonates today.

But that is one moment out of twenty nine. Most of this is just straight up comedy gold without the tons of moralizing and/or preaching that comes with so much of todays television. The humor is also not particularly crude or based on sex jokes and disrespecting parents. I realize I probably sound like an eighty-five year old man, but theres a certain humor and heart with Mr. Belvidere that few of todays shows can match.",1524182400,,1073,4.583333333333333

8327754,4,B001NPK5BU,"Now days, most people only recognize Mr. Belvedere as a frequent butt of Family Guy jokes. On the surface, it was just another 80s sitcom, one of the founding memebers of ABC's classic TGIF line-up, but for those of us who have come to love this show, we realize that it was so much more.

Mr. Belvedere is an english butler, who was created in a 1947 novel, starred in a 1948 movie, and moderized for television in 1985. The show centeres on Lynn Belvedere (Christopher Hewitt), a British Royal butler, who has been hired to work for a middle class family in suburban Pittsburgh. Most of the time, it's your every day run of the mill sitcom, but what made this show extremely different, was it's very special episodes, which occured several times a season.

The show ran from 1985-1990, yet it still managed to be the first television show to tackle issues such as AIDS, bullying, stranger danger, elder rights, and even homosexuality. Often times the family would come into conflict and face three choice, Mrs. Owens, who always does the right things, Mr. Owens, who never does the right thing, and Mr. Belvedere the voice of reason that lies somewhere in the middle.

As for the cast, they are as unique and strange a mix as ever seen on television. The main sources of comedy come from Mr. Belvedere (played by Christopher Hewitt, between known for his performances on Broadway than anything else) and his dealings with Wesley T. Owens (Brice Beckham), who is as twisted and psychotic as any sitcom child could ever be. Mr. Belvedere has frequent run-ins' and a contentious relation with head of the household, George (played by Bob Uecker, a former baseball player), which usually lead to some quick one liners, and even more laughs.

Mr. Belvedere was really ahead of it's time and extremely underrated as far as television history is concerned. It may forever be remembered as that show with the butler, that led into Full House, but for it me, it has always been an image of how the not so perfect family should function and work together. It is a mixture of laughter, tears, and life lessons that is as relevant today as it was back then.",1457481600,,2147,4.6569920844327175
