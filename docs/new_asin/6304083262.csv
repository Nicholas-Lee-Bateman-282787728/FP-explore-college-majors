Adding to the visual splendor  is the two color Technicolor (still a highly experimental process at the  time this movie was made), which has been carefully and gorgeously restored  for this video release. Douglas Fairbanks is at his athletic and romantic  best and his supporting cast is top notch.  Billie Dove is a true vision of  loveliness as the kidnapped princess and villainous Sam De Grasse's  minimalist style contrasts well with Fairbanks' exuberance.

a group of people get tied up and blown to bits. This event pretty much sets the tone for the rest of this interesting pirate film of the silent era. The Black Pirate is pure action 1926 style. When writer and star Douglas Fairbanks created The Black Pirate he set out to make the most exciting film ever made. The fact that this movie still stands up today is a testament to his vision. The Black Pirate a great movie that set the tone for all action adventure movies that followed. Walk the plank!",1318636800,,609,4.258620689655173
777280,5,6304083262,"To begin with, silent movies were made for people like me.  I am one of those obnoxious individuals who talk, about the movie I am watching, completely throughout...almost non-stop.  This is the reason family and friends will not go with me to a movie, set through or even mention movies in my presents anymore.  My wife almost divorced me after the last film we actually attended at a theater...it was Titanic, a movie that I was not overly fond of and was quite vocal about while enduring setting through it.  Silent movies though give me a chance to blah, blah, blah and it does not bother those I am watching it with...well, not much I suppose.

Alas for me, I have not had the pleasure of watching this great granddaddy of all pirate films on the big screen, a pleasure I am sure I am poorer for.  For swashbuckling adventure, amazing sword play, and sheer entertainment, this one is difficult to top...even on the small screen.  My goodness, where to start?

When watching this amazing film, the viewer must keep in mind that it was made in 1926.  The technology, special effects and such simply did not exist.  There were no computer enhancements available, no multi-camera blends and no ""trick photograph"" as some might refer to it today.  What you see is what you see.  This of course was made before the days of full color film, but was done in a two-color or tone method which gives it, as another reviewer nicely put it, ""a surreal effect.  This enhances the overall mood of the film greatly.  Lets face it, this is truly a fantasy, a form of escapism, and the more surrealistic the better as far as I am concerned.

The story line is simple.  Douglas Fairbanks, a young nobleman, seeks retribution against a band of cutthroat pirates who have killed his father.  The grubby pirates are not nice people, good grief no!  Visually, this is made very plane right from the start.  To accomplish this, he becomes one of them and it is then a matter of out pirating the pirates.

The cast includes of course Douglas Fairbanks (at his best in my opinion), and in addition we are given Billie Dove, Donald Crisp, Charlie Stevens, Anders Randolf and Sam dr Grasse.  It should be noted that the costuming is quite remarkable.  The grime, grubbiness, and crude dress of the pirates is much closer to the mark than many of our current films.  These guys did not bathe all that much, wore what was available and were pretty crude in their dress...even for those times; exotic, yes, but still and all, crude.  This film captures that essence perfectly. Some reviewers in the past, and I note here also, have mention that there are certain homoerotic overtones to portions of this film. Personally I did not note them, but I suppose if this flicks your Bic, then so be it. Who am I to be critical of the opinions of others in this area?  I am quite sure that we could find the same thing in stories and movies such as Bambi if we really tried hard enough. On the other hand, I am a bit clueless about such things and maybe there is something to all that.

The big attraction though for me, as far as this film goes, is the sword play.  This film more or less set the standard for literally thousands of films of this genre to come.  Some of the sword fighting sequences filmed here has simply never been equaled!  I have always greatly admired the 1952 movie `Scaramouche,' staring Stewart Granger and the wonderful swordplay featured in that epic film.  If you watch closely though, you will find those duels and sword play have been strongly influenced by the sequences filmed in the move being reviewed here.  For that matter, again if you examine the films closely, you will find that the sequences between Luke Skywalker bashing away at Darth Vader with his light saber, reflect a strong resemblance to some of the scenes filmed in The Black Prince.  There is no doubt that Fairbanks possessed great athletic abilities, in addition to his on screen charisma,  and that charm and athletic ability is certainly on full display in this film.

Secondly, I have always been amazed at the elaborate set designs of this film; those of the ship and ships.  The filming of the various ships being sacked by the motley crews of the pirate vessels is absolutely amazing...so detailed, so realistic!  Again, we must remember that there was no computer enhancement going on here.  The set was the set and that is what those who were filming this movie had to work; again, simply amazing to say nothing of impressive!

Third, this movie entertains!  It starts this process with the first few frames and does not let up until the conclusion 85 minutes later.  Much of the entertainment value is through the absolute acting power of Fairbanks.  He is not only quite athletic, but also extremely funny.  His cheerfulness, even in the midst of a deadly fight, simply washes off of the screen and permeates this entire work in a dominate way.  Even though not one word is uttered throughout the entire movie, you will find yourself chuckling and indeed laughing at times through the whole thing.

From a historical aspect, this is one film that almost has to be in your collection.  From an entertainment point of view, you are missing out on some of the best if you have not watched this at least once...although I might suggest multiple viewings, as it is one of those films that reveal more and more with each viewing.

As a side note; yes, I talked through this entire move, I always do.  Fortunately for me and fortunately for my family, my only company during my last viewing consisted of my four dogs, all very good movie watchers, and they did not seem to mind my babbling...well, not much, I suppose.

777281,5,6304083262,"This movie show Douglas Fairbanks at his very best, in top form as an astonishing athlete of great abilities and a natural facility of movement that has not been surpassed to this day.
His swordsmanship is first rate in his very first duel and later on in the extra features you can discover that his opponent was actually a good swordsman. This is the type of quality that totally disappeared from later pirate films, this is the creme de la creme of the action hero films and a must-see for all interested in this genre.
There is no other movie of this genre that manages to have a more perfect, believable supporting cast. All the other pirates around Douglas are attractive, mostly shirtless, tattoed and rugged, always carrying weapons or heavy bundles that show off their muscled bodies to advantage. This is the male version of the Zigfield Follies if there ever was one, and the accidental homoeroticism of these scenes would surely guarantee the movie immortality for an alternative audience. The way the crowds move in this movie is a total miracle of choreography, not an angle is wasted, and are as much a  pleasure to watch as Douglas' stunts which are perfection at all times, but particularly running down a sail with his knife as support.
Also because this is one of the first technicolor films, it has the special attraction of seeing the early color techniques, which are excellent. This is the only movie in which the ship looks believable in the wood tones and details of the materials, and the same applies to the costumes. If you want to compare how badly it all was done later see this film back to back with ""The Black Swan"" (1942) and note how a full generation later they thought that costumes of this period were as exagerated and outlandish as could be expected of Halloween outfits.  Anders Randolf is perfect and subtle as the evil pirate Captain. Billie Dove is demure and classically beautiful as the kidnapped princess Isobel, perpetually lifting her delicate hand to her clenched teeth in grandiloquent despair  and Donald Crisp asMacTavish is the perfect comical sidekick for Douglas.
A masterpiece that must be seen again and again, buy, do not rent this wonderful movie!",1261526400,3,2207,4.802631578947368
777282,5,6304083262,"Douglas Fairbanks, Sr. had the heart of an artist, and his choice for art director of The Black Pirate reflects that. Carl Oscar Borg - whose works today command multi-thousand dollar prices - was a famous artist even then. Perhaps best known for his magical paintings of the people and landscapes of the American Southwest, Borg found in Fairbanks a kindred soul. The artist and his wife made their home in Santa Barbara, California, but with the passing of his patroness Phoebe Apperson Hearst (mother of William Randolph) and faced with financial losses, Borg sold his precious self-designed Santa Barbara adobe and moved to Hollywood. There Fairbanks proposed the assignment to Borg, and the two men made film history. The Black Pirate was America's first full-length film in color, and it caused a sensation. According to Borg biographer Helen Laird ""Literally not one frame of the film escapes Borg's influence... every episode reveals the artist's vision and style."" Whether you love art, or are simply a Fairbanks fan, you'll find this film a visual treat. And if you aren't already, you'll rapidly become a fan of Carl Oscar Borg.",1224633600,2,1139,5.031746031746032
777343,5,6304083262,"If this DVD had had just the film itself, I would have given it 4 stars, but the extras push it up to 5 stars for me.  The film does move a bit slowly, begins kind of in media res, has a rather thin plot, and has some holes in what little narrative plot there is, but it's still packed with the great swashbuckling and action-adventure one expects in a Douglas Fairbanks, Sr., film.  He's in top form here, be it in a fight with both swords and rapiers, swinging from ropes, swimming, or effortlessly sliding down several huge sail masts while holding onto a knife slicing its way down the masts.  It doesn't hurt that the film is in two-strip Technicolor, although that early color process didn't have an extraordinarily wide color spectrum.  Still, limited color spectrum or not, Doug looks even more gorgeous in color.  He was never regarded as a particularly gifted actor, but he was so popular because of how fun and exciting he was to watch, and really made up for his lack of a *great* acting ability with his amazing charisma, screen presence, his exciting personality, and his indisputed talent when it came to swashbuckling, physical action, stunts, and everything else about this genre he personified.

Though the plot does seem rather thin, it's pointed out in the audio commentary that it was intended that way.  This film is supposed to be a series of situations and episodes, not one long solid narrative with a clearly-defined beginning, middle, and end.  We open as a bunch of pirates are taking over an enemy ship and preparing to blow it up, with its tied-up crew still on board.  Doug's character, the self-proclaimed ""Black Pirate"" (the only character who seems to have a name is MacTavish), and his dying father are the only survivors of the attack, but soon after he has carried his father onto the beach of some island, he discovers in horror and heartbreak that he's dead.  He has just vowed revenge when the pirates responsible come onto the island themselves to bury some treasure; approaching them, he asks to join their company, and defeats their captain in a swordfight.  For some reason, the pirates accept him as one of their own even though he's not only a stranger but has also just killed their own captain.  (The pirate ship he joins is literally overflowing with pirates; one wonders where all of them fit on that ship.)  He then proves his worth further by capturing a ship single-handed, and hatches the brilliant idea to hold the ship for a hefty ransom until noon the next day.  To ensure the ransom will be paid up, he suggests they hold hostage the princess they found hiding down in the lower level of the ship with her maid.  Of course, the Black Pirate ends up falling love with the princess (Billie Dove, who doesn't really have much to do but look scared) at first sight and decides to let her go in the night.  However, one of the other pirates has his sights on her too, and feels she's his because he drew the short strand of rope when he and some of his friends were arguing over which one should get her.  Things get even more complicated when he gets caught and has to face the wrath of most of the other pirates, and all while the ransom still hasn't been paid on the captured ship.

Though perhaps not Fairbanks's greatest film, it's still fun to watch and an action-packed suspenseful adventure all of the way through.  The audio commentary by Rudy Behlmer adds a lot to it, and covers subjects such as the history of color in motion pictures (starting back in the 1890s with hand-colored films), the main stars of the picture, the shooting of the film, the history of pirate films, and bits of trivia, such as how the woman Doug kisses and embraces in the long shot near the end was actually Mary Pickford and not Billie Dove, since Mary didn't like her husband kissing other women in his films, at least not on the mouth (Billie Dove does kiss him on the cheek in an earlier scene).  There are also 19 minutes of outtakes and behind the scenes footage with more commentary by Mr. Behlmer, as well as production stills that also have commentary.  (Certain comments made by Mr. Behlmer during the audio commentary indicate that this commentary was originally done on a double-sided laser disc edition of this film, with the second half of the film, and the extras, on the other side.)  Additionally, the soundtrack is actually the one that was originally written for the film back in 1926, so it's not just a generic piano or organ or a modern-day reinterpretation of what the best score for the film should be.  (I generally don't have a problem with modern music being used to score silents, but I know a lot of purists hate it and prefer scores to be as close to the original music as possible.)  Once again Kino has put together a spectacular DVD of a classic.",1166227200,6,4821,4.572590011614402
777344,4,6304083262,"I have been fortunate to see this film 3 times on the big screen and it is certainly the finest example of a Two-Strip Technicolor silent film still extant.

Fairbanks is at his finest and this film contains the famous stunt of plunging his knife into the mainsail and gracefully sliding to safety.  However, it is fair to note that this film moves noticeably slower than the other Fairbanks swashbucklers of this era but it is still first rate entertainment and much emulated by the likes of Errol Flynn, Tyrone Power and Burt Lancaster (""The Crimson Pirate"")  Highly Recommended.",1146614400,2,665,4.876106194690266

777346,4,6304083262,"This is the oldest surviving three color film.  That is film the stuff in the camera I am talking about.  So the reason it gets published now is for historical interest in film methods.  The story is OK, but the image quality is not so hot.  This isn't Kino's fault - the film was in poor condition with many scratches.  Finding a color print was very a coup, but that particular print was not in perfect condition.

As usual Fairbanks does nifty stunts, including an underwater attack on a ship, but he does this in many other movies which hold up better today.  The plot here is the usual action stunts and all around good movie, but once again film quality was distracting for me.

This movie is unlikely to appeal to most.  Unless you are specifically interested in the color film process you will likely be bored.  University libraries should consider archiving this.  Film students may want to view this movie for its historical importance and to get a glimpse of what technology was available in the mid-20's.  By the way regarding film quality I want to reiterate that Kino does excellent restorations of silent movies.  I am sure that they have done what they could here and done a good job, but starting from a film that needed more restoration.  The fact that this film is available at all is very cool and Kino is a great source for silent movies.",1102118400,4,1359,4.539094650205762

777348,5,6304083262,"Wahooo!  Now this is a fun movie!  I was totally taken by surprise.  The swashbuckler of swashbucklers!  ""The Black Pirate"" is the great grand-pappy of all pirate movies to come, and every possible genre convention is on display, be it sliding down the sail by splitting it with a dagger, or fencing several men at once, catching all of their blades with one parry.  A lot of great films, such as ""The Princess Bride,"" find their roots here in ""The Black Pirate."" This is like Disney's ""Pirates of the Caribean"" ride come to life, with the addition of dashing Douglas Fairbanks.
Fairbanks is extrodinarily athletic, and it is incredible to watch his body in motion.  They don't make 'em like that any more.  He has the smile, the mustache and the skill with a blade.  I imagine he would give a jaunty laugh in the midst of danger.
Although it is a silent film, ""The Black Pirate"" is not black and white, but colored in a two-color Technicolor process.  The color gives an excellent, sureal effect.  The underwater scenes are amazing.

777349,5,6304083262,"Douglas Fairbanks was at the top of his form in this film, and that is saying a lot. Every era has its screen giants, and Fairbanks held that status throughout the 1920s through his cheerful heroics in such titles as The Three Musketeers, Robin Hood, The Thief of Bagdad, and The Black Pirate. Crowds loved his film persona because it was memorable: it was larger-than-life; it was splendidly imaginative; and it consistently showed good overcoming evil. Fairbanks perfectly depicted -- in 50-foot form on a big screen full of splendid sets -- acrobatics, stunts, and deeds of derring-do that no one of us could ever hope to do. Call it escapism, if you will, but it enraptured countless moviegoers historically drawn into this world of Mr. Fairbanks's fantasy epics. Here, as well, there is the added joy of seeing a film genre -- that of the pirate adventure -- at a time when fresh minds brought creative ideas and great craft to bear upon the films of their devising. What the viewer gets, then, is an original product that is vivid and memorable -- and not a tired recycling by lesser talents of uninventive themes and ideas. A viewer of this film, even on DVD, is wondrously drawn into an exotic and fascinating (indeed, even an early Technicolor) world and is held there firmly in place by the skilled and entertaining work of able craftsmen for the duration of the 85-minute running time. And, while so drawn in, one is also uplifted, if nothing else than by the very cheeriness of the star's persona. Unless one despises entertainment value as a legitimate goal of movie-making, there is nothing more that one could ask from a good film of this type. Nor should the age of the film, or its being a silent picture, deter any but those who are prejudiced. There is a reason why Douglas Fairbanks was made so wealthy by moviegoers that he was able to become a founder of United Artists. Whatever else there is, there is sort of magic at work in his best films. It is well worth the modern moviegoer's time, then, to see why this film created such excitement back in 1926. The DVD format makes all this vividly accessible. Highly recommended.",1017360000,18,2147,4.667546174142481
777350,4,6304083262,"In Douglas Fairbanks's only color movie, we are treated to what is really a homage to boy's pirate novels. All of the elements are in place: the daredevil hero, the insidious villain, the amiable sidekick, the damsel in distress, saber battles, buried treasure, murder on the high seas, bloody duels on the beach, walking the plank....
The plot could have been from a Robert Louis Stevenson novel. Fairbanks plays a nobleman whose father is murdered. He swears vengeance and to gain it, he infiltrates the pirate ship. Plans go awry when the lovely Billie Dove shows up. (she was cast mainly because Fairbanks liked the way she photographed in color!)
This edition features an orchestral score and a commentary on the making of the movie. I found it rather fun to see how Fairbanks worked at making his stunts perfect.
As mentioneed before, the movie is RATHER more bloody than one expects in such an old film but it is by no means as gory as most modern action movies. (I would rate the violence between a PG and a PG-13) Other than the violence, there are no objectionable scenes, it is all mainly suspense.
This was made at the height of Douglas Fairbanks's popularity and you can easily see how it influenced swashbucklers for years after. It's only a shame that the genre died out in the 50s. The certainly do not make them like they used to.",1009584000,5,1347,4.640167364016737

7861087,5,6304083262,"Quite amazing that it took so long to achieve the glorious colours of Gone in the wind and other Technicolor movies of the fifties if one look at the two-strip result of the ""Black Pirate"".Still, this is a unique film which heralds the glory to come!
A must to own for anyone interested in the incredible story of the Technicolor process development.",1440633600,,350,4.661290322580645
7861088,5,6304083262,"The movie is great!  However, buyers need to be warned about the various DVD editions of THE BLACK PIRATE.  The movie was the first full-length film (in 1926) using two-strip Technicolor, but some of the DVDs being sold are black and white editions with color tints.  A buyer who gets the tinted version is being cheated out of the original Technicolor experience.  Be sure to purchase a Technicolor version!",1436572800,,408,4.869565217391305

7861090,3,6304083262,"Great movie if somewhat corny in places, but a must have if you are interested in the history of swashbucklers. My only complaint was that in about a third of the movie, the background was absent; all one saw was ghostly faces against a grayish green background. I assume this was because of the poor quality of the original celluloid image. Otherwise the color was surprisingly good.",1414454400,,384,4.746268656716418
