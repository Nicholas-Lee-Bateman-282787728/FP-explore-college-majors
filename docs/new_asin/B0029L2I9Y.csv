3877083,4,B0029L2I9Y,"This program is for someone who wants results, but looking for a low intensity workout.

I'm trying to lose that last 5 lbs and get back in shape for summer. I finished the one workout with no problem at all (I did regular push-ups instead of one handed push ups). The program isn't too intense or fast-paced. I was actually kinda bored, and it didn't even feel like I was exercising, but the next day... OUCH! I have never been so sore in my entire life! But I must say that I was sore in all the right places...butt and inner thighs!  I had to buy a heavier medicine ball for my upper body workouts, but the ball that the program came with is great for the lower body workouts. The program comes with a motivational packet to record your results, provides a schedule for workouts and a recommended diet.

Some of the exercises remind me of basktball practice in high school. For example, the ""squat figure eight"". You squat and move the ball through your legs like a figure eight.

I do recommend this to anyone trying to tone up. I only gave this program a 4, because I personally found that it's a little boring and hard to stay focused during the workout...Maybe I'm just not motivated enough! If you like high intensity, this might not be for you.

Tip: Ladies, any medicine ball of any weight, size will work with this program. I actually like the medicine ball I bought at the store because it was smaller in size (not weight) making it easier to handle during exercises. Also, it was cheaper.",1299542400,5,1501,4.443636363636363
3877084,5,B0029L2I9Y,"This workout can benefit anyone. It is easy enough for a novice, but can also help a fitness buff get into the best shape of his/her life. The video is not about building huge muscles. It is about toning muscles, building endurance, and feeling great.

Mitch Gaylord is the most personable fitness instructor I have seen in a workout video. I always thought Richard Simmons seemed nice, but Gaylord is far less spastic.  Gaylord offers suggestions on how to make his workout easier or more intense, depending on the needs of the user.

His routines work without being overly difficult to perform. Most importantly, Gaylord makes the exercises fun, partially with his personality and partially due to using the 2, 4, or 6 lb G-Ball in the routines. I think I have finally found a program I can stick with.",1280361600,4,804,4.728571428571429
3877085,5,B0029L2I9Y,"I was hesitant about this workout because I have too much stuff around (kettle bells, dumb bells, step benches, etc.) so was wary of another gadget.  Also, Mitch Gaylord, despite his medals, doesn't exactly look like the picture of ""buff"" I'm used to seeing in workout coaches and he just didn't appeal to me at all.  However, my abs are my trouble zone so this ""engage the core throughout the workout"" strategy convinced me to give it a shot.

Normally I do FIRM workouts - all of them - and have for 20 years.  However, I have never broken the kind of sweat these Melt-it-Off workouts produce with any FIRM video!  I put my heart rate monitor on and I was at my target zone within 2 or 3 minutes and remained there and higher than I can normally maintain throughout the entire workout!  I mean I am drenched!

The greatest of his workouts in my opinion is the Mix & Melts.  These are 4, 15-minute, team led segments between Mitch and some lady named Mindy who is really fun and pushes you through the small segments so fast you don't even realize the 15 minutes has passed!  Mitch and she seem to have an easy-going relationship and the banter is amusing and hasn't gotten on my nerves yet.  The great thing about this video is you can mix and match them.  Since my time is so crazy, I can do a 15 minute plus the 10 minute workout for a 25 minute workout, or I can do 2 or 3 or all 4 of the 15 minute segments for 30, 45 or 60 minute workouts.  I am afraid to try all 4 at once.  What's so amazing is that when I do other workouts, to get my heart rate that high, it seems like I have to be doing something so challenging that I can't sustain it.  Somehow (the ball?) the program keeps you burning intensely without burning out!  that means less time exercising for the same calorie burn!

Although he does a lot of modifications, the strength video I can't seem to bring myself to do again.  This one is less fun and really hard.  The 60 minute cardio one is doable but I rarely have that much time.  Also, in that video, he does a series of exercises that get you through to about the 35 minute mark and then you repeat them so I could I suppose turn it off at that point (I really don't like doing the same thing all over again - it's bad enough doing the same video day after day let alone the same series of exercises twice in the same video.)  But it will burn a LOT of fat for sure.

I'm looking for more videos from him that are fun like the mix and melt and which give lots of flexibility on time commitment.

I don't follow the diet program nor can I workout the amount of time that is recommended for the weight loss to occur, but I believe that anyone who follows his program closely will see incredible weight loss and increased fitness.

It might seem like there are a lot of things I'm negative about on this series of videos, but those are really just my quirks.  I gave this 5 stars because I believe it is the most effective workout I've ever tried and if I just had the guts or time to push through, I'm sure I'd reach incredible new heights of fitness.

ONE MONTH LATER:

I've been using this workout for a month now and I've lost 3 pounds.  Now, that might not seem like a lot, but I have been working out 3 to 5 times a week for 2-1/2 years and haven't been able to break the plateau I was on; we all know how tough it is to break the plateau!  And when you only have 5 to 10 pounds to lose, that can be even harder.  I like a little under a pound a week weight loss because that means it's really fat, not water.  I think Mitch mentions that this is a 12 week program, so if I continue to use these workouts I expect to lose the entire 8 pounds I'm going for.  Good luck!",1246838400,36,3697,4.107242339832869
8357878,5,B0029L2I9Y,"I picked up this DVD set at a used book sale.  My cover says ""Melt it Off - 4 Complete Workouts.""  I had previously owned some of the ""Melt it Off"" workouts that Mitch Gaylord did with fitness instructor Mindy Mylrea, and I worried that these might be the same, but they are not, they are completely different.  Not only is there NO Mindy, but within the workouts themselves, Mitch never refers to ""Melt if Off""--instead, he calls these workouts ""GMF,"" short for Gold Medal Fitness, which is emblazoned across the set.  Of course, Mitch Gaylord is an Olympic Gold medal winner (for gymnastics), so this name makes sense; I'm just not sure why the disparity with the outer cover of the DVD.  The only thing that these workouts do have in common with the other ""Melt it Off"" set is the use of the ""G Ball,"" a medicine ball.  In these workouts, Mitch recommends 4, 6, or 8 lbs., and he sometimes switches it up.

The Main Menu for the DVD reads as follows:
o Play All
o Play: -Introduction -Melt in 10 Workout
o Play High Calorie Melt Workout
o Play Cardio Burn and Sculpt Workout
o Play Sizzlin Abs Workout
o Play Together Cardio Burn + Sizzling Abs

For each workout, Mitch is teaching live, and he is joined by two background exercisers.  Mitch varies between performing the exercises and moving around the room coaching.  See below for brief overviews of each class.

MELT IN 10 WORKOUT
In this sequence, 10 moves are performed in 10 minutes.  The introduction that precedes this workout is about 8 1/2 minutes long and explains all of the moves so as not to slow down the routine itself.  Some of the moves appear in the other workouts on the DVD as well (e.g., iron cross); they are both strength-focused and cardio-intensive.  This workout includes a short warm-up as part of the 10 minutes; at the end of the 10-minute countdown, there is a brief cool-down of about one additional minute.

HIGH CALORIE MELT (AKA CITIUS)
Mitch repeatedly refers to this workout as Citius.  I had to figure out that this is part of the Olympic motto (Citius, Altius, Fortius) and means ""faster,"" appropriate for a cardio routine.  This 58-minute workout uses the G-ball throughout  Mitch is joined by Crystal and Jason, and the three perform three different levels of the exercises--helpfully referred to as Gold, Silver, and Bronze.  After a nice gradual aerobic warm-up, the workout is performed in 1-minute of cardio rounds: you'll do 4-5 rounds followed by a core exercise (mostly push-ups), then repeat the cardio rounds.  There were about three circuits of this altogether followed by a 4 1/2 minute cool-down-stretch.

BURN AND SCULPT (AKA FORTIUS)
Fortius means ""stronger.""  Although this was the strength routine, it still moved quickly and had a pretty intense cardio component as well.  Mitch is jointed by Liz and Sly, again demonstrating three different levels of the routine.  The warm-up is similar to the one for the cardio workout, with the option of using the G-ball or not.  For the strength portion, the first 16 minutes of the workout focuses entirely on the lower body with moves such as half squats, around the world squats, back lunges, side lunges, and on the floor, hamstring rollouts.  Arms work included overhead curls, overhead passes, iron cross, and then a whole series of push-ups to finish, including a plyo push-up option.  There was a nice 5-minute stretch, bringing in the total time for this workout at just under 40 minutes (39:58).

SIZZLIN' ABS
Mitch describes this workout as developing core strength without doing situps.  It's pretty challenging!  Mitch starts with his typical standing warm-up, using the G-ball or not.  Moving to the floor with the G-ball, he performs exercises such as in-and-out extensions, tuck-ups, oblique rotations, kayak, scissor switch, and pike ups.  Many of these moves are done for a high number of repetitions, making them even more difficult.  Mitch concludes this 24-minute minute routine with a short cool-down stretch.

I have been a daily exerciser for years, and I struggled to get through these workouts, mostly at the bronze level!  I was using a 4-lb. medicine ball.  There are places where you could probably sub a small dumbbell, but having the med ball is preferable.  Although these workouts are a bit on the older side now (produced 10 years ago, in 2007), the simple studio setting does not feel overly dated.  Mitch is a likeable, encouraging instructor, and I would definitely recommend this DVD to intermediate and above exercisers looking for great workouts with minimal equipment.

PS--This DVD also comes with a motivational CD.  I have not listened to that yet but will update my review when I do!",1496361600,,4680,4.845088161209068

8357881,5,B0029L2I9Y,"Mitch presents a 3 day food plan which is pretty simple to follow. I did the videos , alternating the sculpting+abs one with the cardio one (60mins each), about 4 days a week and followed his diet. It took about 3 months, but I got better abs than I had before I had my first child. The abs one is really hard at first, but I got a little stronger each time & was able to do more reps. I think the diet is a key part though. I've been using his videos for 6 yrs, the DVD is finally worn out so I'm ordering a replacement.  I do the videos when want to get results fast. I like to turn the volume down & put my own music in the background.  Love it!",1427414400,2,648,3.828358208955224
