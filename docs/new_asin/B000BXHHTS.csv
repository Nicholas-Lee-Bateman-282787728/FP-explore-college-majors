8093785,1,B000BXHHTS,"The soundtrack is much better than the film (if you can call it a film!). I'm skeptical of who is writing good reviews here. There is no plot or meaning in this poorly executed ""film"". Whether a sarcastic or supposed portrayal of real scumrockers, i personally know scumrockers in NYC and they have brains! The director couldve made this a silent film and it wouldve made no difference; could these people (and bad actors as well) be any stupider? Here's hoping this so-called director never attempts another film.",1313712000,,514,4.8522727272727275
8093786,5,B000BXHHTS,"SCUMROCK captures the guts and glory of rock'n'roll!!! Finally, a movie that doesn't dumb it down for the audience. Great naturalistic acting, awesome soundtrack, and lots of hahas make this an instant classic and one of the few movies that actually seems so ""real"" you can feel the characters sweat.
