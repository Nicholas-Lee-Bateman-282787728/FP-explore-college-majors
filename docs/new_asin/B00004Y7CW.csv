8172316,3,B00004Y7CW,"These two episodes are definitely the lesser entries of M:I's merely average seventh season. Instead of fun episodes like ""Two Thousand"" and ""Break!"" Paramount instead chose one average and one dismal episode -- ""Puppet"" has a strong cast (including villain Roddy McDowall, and backup scum Val Avery and John Larch) but a fairly slow plot and little visual style or gadgetry. ""The Pendulum"" only has some nice exteriors and sets to recommend it (Dean Stockwell's performance is particularly beneath his talent). Nevertheless, this is probably the only way a Mission completist can buy these episodes on tape, so if you're a collector, pick it up.",976838400,12,646,5.161904761904762
