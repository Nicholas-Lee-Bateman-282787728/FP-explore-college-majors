7539121,5,B0184DLI1E,"This is hands-down the best film I have ever seen about a woman. That it was made in the 1960s but not released here in the USA till now is pretty shocking. But it is worth the time of anyone interested in film, in Italy, in feminism, in the 60s, in women and hell, in just about anything else you might want to add. The director died far too early in his life and career but this film will stand as a testament to his great talent and humanity. Stefania Sandrelli, the leading actress (who is still with us and works almost constantly), is a revelation. Do yourself a favor and buy or rent this wonderful movie. As usual, Criterion has done a splendid job with both the DVD and Blu-ray editions.",1462838400,10,696,4.28030303030303

7539125,5,B0184DLI1E,"This might as well be one of the best Italian movies of the 1960s, directed by master Antonio Pietrangeli who untimely died in 1969, and, did not have the chance to work more, and leave us more of his outstanding film work, to cite among others, ""La Parmigiana"" with Catherine Spaak, and, ""Adua e le Compagne"", all excellent movies that were fierce evidence of the great power and artistic force of Italian cinema of those days. This one (original title is ""Io la conoscevo bene"" that translates a bit weakly, if faithfully, into ""I knew her well"") is well known to be the director's masterpiece, and, the movie that definitely launched the International career of its star, then 19 years old beauty, Stefania Sandrelli who already had known vast popularity in two Pietro Germi's block busters (""Divorce Italian Style"" in 1961 and ""Seduced and Abandoned"" in 1964) and in other French, and Italian movies always of good quality, but, had been often used more as a supporting player or as a young ingenue, rather than the main star: and, here instead, after major screen testing and consideration of all main stars of the time, young Sandrelli won the role, and, she delivered one touching, unforgettable performance that is as heartbreaking, as it is moving, and still extremely real, and timely. Sandrelli went on with great films such as Bertolucci's ""The Conformist"" (1971), ""1900"" (1976), Germi's ""Alfredo, Alfredo"" (1973), Ettore Scola's ""We all loved each other so much"" in 1975, ""The Terrace"" in 1980, ""The Family""(1987), Paolo Virzi's ""The First Beautiful Thing"" in 2010, all well known to American audiences as well, and so greatly always confirming her star status, but i must notice that, despite a career that has showed her as an extremely versatile, and, intense player in so many diverse roles and genres, her portrayal of a disillusioned, lonesome, tormented young actress named Adriana Astarelli,  facing Rome, and its increasingly evil, and, decadent mentality, burning innocence and natural sentiments in the shimmering years of the Dolce Vita (here almost as exquisitely staged as in the classic Fellini's master work) remains a milestone in Italian, and not only Italian movies enhanced by outstanding performances. Her work, so well guided by such a director,  always so incredibly true to women, and, almost always ( a rare occurrence those days) having young women as main protagonists, and not just as antagonists or pure objects of decor, it is memorable here, and showcases gradually with impeccable sensibility,  all the phases, all the personal, internal dismal, and, the most saddening downfall of a coming of age, gone all too terribly wrong. It also well serves as a severe critique to all the fashions and judgements of a society, so depicted as shallow and dehumanized as only few other movies were so realistically able to take its audience to a turning point : it is when some must ask profoundly to him/herself extremely life challenging questions. And, furthermore, this movie does indeed put many questions on what morality, compassion, talent, and dreams, the same industry and the arst have or don't have in common, and, at the same time, it accomplishes to accurately nail the bare bones of a Movies scene that comes across naturally here as too often plagued by financial or political interests, instead to think straight or to leave decency to naturals, without breaking dreams, but showing only a significant lack of remorse, and this is all just so superbly done here, without mannerism.
The movie has also incredible production values, with exceptional contributions from the same future director Ettore Scola, and Ruggero Maccari, who co-wrote with Pietrangeli a script that's still stunning, and that can successfully alternate sarcasm, with the most cynical dramatic material, along with more entertaining, comedic, and, bitter sweet moments, always pleasantly sustained by a rich dialog without too many innuendo's and in fact it is as vibrant, as it is contemporary. But, there's even more great work from production designer, and, art director Maurizio Chiari, and, from exceptional director of photography, Armando Nannuzzi, while the catchy music score is composed by Piero Piccioni's melancholic leitmotiv, who makes also such  great use of popular songs of the time, gaining effect, and momentum. And, the supporting cast is a powerhouse of International stars of the time (1965) all performing at their best, especially Ugo Tognazzi, as an actor in disgrace who's the only one to end up having some respect, and warmth for Adriana, throughout all the myriad of hardened, deceiving, amoral faces she comes to meet like in a vortex of raising despair, and consequential isolation.
Altogether, i highly recommend this exceptional movie, i cannot promise you will be smiling or feeling good at the end, but, you might have a taste of what failure represents in a World that doesn't want to listen, after having watched a story of a lonesome soul that is  powerfully acted, directed, and presented in one true classic film.",1453161600,44,5075,5.124396135265701
8741342,4,B0184DLI1E,"Visually exhilarating and emotionally draining. A very, very dark movie that is quite stunningly frank in its portrayal of the exploitation that lies under the surface (barely) of the glamour industry. Sandrelli's performance is amazing. I kept thinking how exhausting and depressing it must have been to play this character, and how impressive it was for an actress so young to communicate such a sense of world-weary heartbreak, layered over with superficial laughter and a carefree facade. Though it has many funny moments, this is not a fun movie. But definitely worth seeing.",1501286400,3,580,5.247311827956989
8741343,5,B0184DLI1E,"Sandrelli at age 19 was already a beauty and accomplished actress.  It's the other side of the coin of La Dolce Vita,the woman's point of view.  She's given an interview which is supposed to boost her career but when she sees it on TV, it's all been perverted and makes her look silly.  Friends at the movie theatre where she serves as usheret laugh at her.  She returns home...friends and a young boy are no help to her and she plunges from the balcony.  Heartrending.",1501113600,,469,4.470588235294118
8741344,1,B0184DLI1E,"This is the kind of film critics and I bet the folks at criterion jerks to when they announce a release of a ""forgotten"" movie. Well,there's usually a reason why! Oh yeah,I got the message while watching it - but the message could not save me from getting bored. And you know what's coming so the ending is no surprise,really it's not. She kills herself. You're welcome - so you don't have to spend your well earned bucks on this tosh.....",1498348800,,439,4.432098765432099
8741345,5,B0184DLI1E,You looks as the first defining feature create a sex object of social expression. You become a part of a system that places looks over in large part what that entails. The difference is how you go about really learning from that. The faith of morality doesn't apply to a women who is open about embracing her ability to be a slut. It hurts more when you think their anyone who isn't related to you. You can leave the systems that made the looks important behind. You can't moralize it away. It's been tried and yet especially in 2017 the ones who don't care seem to be getting a majority of their needs meet Before the ones that do.,1490140800,,632,4.319327731092437
8741346,5,B0184DLI1E,"A superb film about the shallowness, the cost of failure and pull of decadence on those attracted by the false promises of a career in film based on the premise of looks alone. The overhang of increasing lonesomeness hardly lightened by hard won wisdom gives shades the movie a dark color, made immediate by the black and white cinematography and the beautiful face of Sandrelli going slowly dark with it all in the end. I found the two most interesting scenes to be the ones with the aging writer, whose portrayal of a hollow existence was strangely accurate yet off the mark in missing depths that could not be put to words, and the scene with the parking attendant and his cat. Both were portraits of despair not fully acknowledged or comprehended. The movie is affecting for those who are open to being affected, no matter it was made in the 60's Rome.  Perhaps this should be required viewing for aspiring actors and actresses in modern day Hollywood too.",1483315200,4,960,4.680473372781065
8741347,4,B0184DLI1E,"Criterion has brought to the home screen yet another classic of the Italian Cinema.  The director Pietrangeli didn't live very long, but created in his short life several notable and beautiful film projects during the often referenced 'golden age' of Italian film, roughly the mid 1950's to the
mid 1960's.  ""I Knew Her Well"" is a stunning film which begins virtually as an exercise in voyeurism and ends with a shocking punch at the
end of the life of a protagonist who searched, without fulfillment, for meaning in life and one's relationships.  With a new 4-K digital restoration the viewer can at last view a generally long-forgotten work of early Italian Cinema and enjoy a story very reminiscent of another classic,
'The Girl With A Suitcae'.",1477180800,4,748,4.920634920634921
8741348,2,B0184DLI1E,Not much substance- just over and over showing a shallow young woman wasting her life in foolish behavior.,1476316800,2,106,4.944444444444445
8741349,4,B0184DLI1E,"The story of a young woman in 1960s Italy living in the moment and seemingly enjoying the life of a party girl while aspiring to be a model actress. The film takes a dark turn when she feels humiliated at what was to be a big moment for her. This has the feel of other Italian post war realism films and the lead actress Stefania Sandrelli is really excellent here even if she's less well known than some of her contemporaries.
In B&W and with English subtitles , no fan of Italian cinema should miss this one.",1475625600,,510,4.268041237113402
8741350,2,B0184DLI1E,"One star for the acting, one star for 1960's Italy. The ending was cliche and totally ruined the movie for me.",1469923200,,110,4.285714285714286
8741351,5,B0184DLI1E,"I watched I Knew her Well after being recommended by Amazon. I am a huge fan of the Italian 60s movies and it is only now that Ive heard about Antonio Pietrangeli and this movie. I am so glad that Amazons algorithm worked this time. I Knew her Well is pure joy from start to finish (yes, even the end).

During the 60s, mostly in the early part of the decade, women all of the sudden became European filmmaker's fascination. We had Antonioni movies with Monica Vitti, Bunuel and Jeanne Moreau, Silvia Pinal and Deneuve; Visconti and Claudia Cardinale on the great Vaghe Stelle dell'Orsa, Godard and Chantal Goya, Anna Karina and Bardot, Truffauts The Bride Wore Black with Jeanne Moreau. Not to mention Fellini, Bergman, etc and etc The list is extensive. These are movies with womans themes, with an actress in a leading role from scene by scene. These movies made us hear womens inner-voice in a society that was making adjustments to their role. They were becoming independent and collecting the fruits of their emancipation. How did they adapt? How did they pursue their ambitions? How did they fit in?

I Knew her Well follows this trend. There was a moment in the movie that Adriana is defined as someone who just lives the present moment, without bothering with the past and future. But we know that there is something beyond that. We are not sure what. But we know. Thats the key for Stefania Sandrelli successful performance. In reality, we don't know her well. If this is true for Adriana, it also applies to the characters portrayed by Claudia Cardinale, Monica Vitti and so on. They were a step further from Sophia Loren.

Then we have Armando Nannuzzi. Nobody was able to get the amazing texture of the black and white as the Italians. They also knew how to move the camera and use the zoom as nobody else. Their trademark. Nannuzzi, Gianni Di Venanzo, Tonino Delli Colli, all of them.

I wonder if by the time Pietrangeli was shooting the movie, he had any idea on the impact I Knew her Well will cause to us, more than 50 years later. The fashion, the cars, the pop songs, the streets, we are transported to Rome in 1964. This is a treasure. I Knew her Well has more style than all movies made in every country in the world in the last 20, 30 or more years put together.

Even the voice-over, another trademark of the Italian movies, has its charm.

The Criterion restoration is perfect. The DVD extras bring an interview with Stefania Sandrelli - aged quite well - and an Italian film critic who gave an overview of Pietrangelis brilliant and short career.

After Sgt. Peppers, things went to a different direction. The great black and white movies started to fade away and the filmmakers were inspired by new social themes. Movies about women became less frequent. But then Lina Wertmuller decided to make movies...",1469318400,11,2832,4.640718562874252
