3431447,5,B0019BI0VK,"This Little Einsteins Adventure keeps our three-year-old child engaged, solving problems, moving, using his imagination, and singing. We use television sparingly, and in a world with so many dumb TV shows and videos, this one stands out as educational and worthwhile.",1246233600,7,267,5.536585365853658
3431448,4,B0019BI0VK,"My twin girls are 3 1/2 years old, and they both really like Little Einsteins.  They were so upset when Disney switched to only showing episodes on weekends.  So this DVD set filled the space nicely.",1245542400,,199,4.5
3431449,5,B0019BI0VK,"We enjoy Little Einsteins.  We like the music and the art they introduce in the video, so it isn't just fun animation, it helps to teach something.  My son even recognized some of the music he has heard on Little Einsteins at a Family Symphony!",1237852800,3,244,4.4
3431450,5,B0019BI0VK,"I got these for my son and he absolutely loves them. He is 23 months and he pats , claps and repeats everything they say. One of the best thing i like about these DVDs , is that they are a few short shows on a single DVD. Each show is about 20-30 minutes. With the exception of one fo the DVD that is about 40 mins long.",1237680000,3,320,3.7205882352941178
3431451,4,B0019BI0VK,"We were in transition from one house to another and didn't have many movies for our kids to watch. A friend of mine had given Little Einstein rave reviews so we ordered this set for our nearly three year old and she really likes them.  She couldn't go along with the interactive parts (asking the viewers questions or having them clap or raise their arms)but seems to enjoy watching it none the less.  The longer episodes (like Firebird's resuce) gets a little boring, they must have been scraping bottom for content.  I do love the classic music changed into kids songs and the use of art in the background.  The music does get stuck in your head and is usually the more annoying ones.  My husband and I like to watch these less than Disney Classic movies but it's a nice change of pace for our older daughter.",1233446400,,811,4.452702702702703
3431452,5,B0019BI0VK,My daughter loves Little Einsteins! Great episodes that she hadn't seen on TV...Several episodes on each dvd...,1232928000,2,111,5.588235294117647
3431453,5,B0019BI0VK,"My daughter loves the Little Einsteins.  I bought her this three pack of DVDs, and also the ""Pat Pat"" Rocket toy, and she watches the video while playing with the toy.  She watches them over and over again without getting sick of them.  They are all long enough to hold their attention for a meaningful amount of time!  The learning about music and art is also great, obviously.  I like the fact that they always have an ""adventure"" story line.  I highly recommend these and the other Little Einstein videos.",1232409600,3,508,4.588888888888889
3431454,5,B0019BI0VK,My kids aren't the most patient but they can set through Little Einsteins which is great.  My three year old is autistic and we see her repeating some of the things they do that require interaction.  Its kind of like Dora with the amount of interaction which is very nice to have.  She can't speak back to them when they speak to her but if she could talk I know she would.  My other daughter loves all three episodes as well and being almost two we find her interaction and talking back refreshing.  I know if my kids were doing this review they would give it five stars.  I personally am glad I made this purchase of the three pack to see my kids enjoy them all the way through.,1231891200,2,680,4.1923076923076925
3431455,5,B0019BI0VK,"My almost 3 year old daughter LOVES these videos.  I thought we were getting 3 full length features, but there is a mix.  ""Golden Pyramid"" and ""Race for Space"" each have three 20-25 minute episodes.  I love this because I can tell her ""1 episode"" when I don't want her watching for and hour or more.  ""Firebird""  has 1 feature-length (I think about 50 minutes) and 1 shorter episode.  Little Einsteins is definitely a step above most cartoons.  My daughter can tell you what a metamorphosis is, among other things, thanks to the Little Einsteins.  I bought this set because I was tired of the one movie we had.",1229385600,17,610,4.532110091743119
3431456,5,B0019BI0VK,"While the titles of the discs may have little to do with the content, my kids LOVE these Little Einsteins DVDs. The Firebird adventure is especially nice--it's a ""double-feature."" As always, the music and art exposure are great. My kids always enjoy participating in the patting, clapping, dancing, and tell me all about forte, pianissimo, largo, moderato, and all of the other music terms they are learning. Great set, great price.

Hmmm...I just noticed that Amazon doesn't have a lot of information on this product. I got it a few weeks ago for a long road trip. It has three DVDs:
1. ""Rocket's Firebird Rescue"" which is a 40 minute double-episode and also has the ""Rocket Soup"" episode.
2. ""The Legend of the Golden Pyramid"" which has the title episode, ""The Dragon Kite"" and ""Annie and the Little Toy Plane.""
3. ""Race for Space"" has ""Super Fast,"" ""Behind the Red Door,"" and ""The Great Sky Race Rematch."" None of these really have anything to do with space, but they do have to do with race.

My kids love all three discs...I've had to watch them over and over with the kids and they're good. The music is great and I like seeing the different art. In fact--it's really improved MY art and music appreciation! I never knew a thing about art before watching these shows with the kids!",1226361600,140,1287,4.640350877192983

3431548,3,B0019BI0VK,"I bought these DVDs when my son was 1 1/2 years old. He loved the show already and he did initially enjoy the DVDs but he soon lost interest which was fine with me, because the singing to classical music was somewhat annoying as the added 'lyrics' were terrible. The show is somewhat pretentious and the characters lack character though they are each assigned a talent (i.e. singing, musical instruments, dancing). Overall, the DVDs are not bad, they did entertain my son, but for the price I do not believe they are worth it, and overall I would not buy again.",1380758400,,561,4.564356435643564

I used the ""magic feather"" on him yesterday when he didn't have enough to shoot all the monsters.  Really cute, I love that they use classical music.  It also stimulates the mind and teaches shapes, music, spatial relationships, etc.  Its also really cute to watch my son interact, do the dances, and hollar ""lookout rocket!""  I have the words to the theme song memorized (along with Barney)",1253145600,3,530,4.574468085106383
