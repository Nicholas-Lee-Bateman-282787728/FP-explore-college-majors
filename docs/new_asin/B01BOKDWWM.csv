7664570,5,B01BOKDWWM,"This is another amazing film by writer/director Stephen Cone revealing well observed cracks in cultural Christianity's relationship with the reality of the human condition. The film explores many questions including how many modern American Christians present themselves in facades to each other while behind the scenes their lives are broken, imperfect, and far different from what they pretend to be.

Sadly, much of Christianity has a severely dysfunctional relationship with sexuality, sexual orientation, gender, and non-Christians. This films stirs all these elements together in one delicious mess. It explores some of the consequences of the disconnect between being a cultural Christian and a human being with a sexual component. When you separate the reality of a person's inborn sexuality from their spirituality it gets messy very fast - especially at a Happy Birthday pool party. This movie paints multiple layers of this detachment in regard to old and young, gay and straight, religious and non-religious, drinkers and non-drinkers, those mentally stable and those not quite so sound.

The acting was solid and believable. The themes in the film are excruciatingly accurate and well observed - sometimes funny, sometimes painful. The writer has a keen ability (and track record) to tell stories that others are afraid to tell. This makes the movie amazing and well worth viewing. I highly recommend this film. Dive in the deep end.",1462233600,35,1446,5.393805309734513

7664572,5,B01BOKDWWM,"Prompt service from the seller, and in the condition listed.  Really pleased with the purchase.

If you grew up in a Fundamentalist/Baptist or Pentecostal church and later found yourself coming out, you may have a bit of discomfort watching this.  I did, however, the content was very realistic.  As I reported as a comment to a review, the ending was a bit more than I anticipated, and a bit difficult to watch.  I won't spoil it, here.  The reader needs to watch it, and not take everyone else's opinion as factual or even objective.",1486857600,,535,4.638297872340425
7664573,3,B01BOKDWWM,"Henry Gamble's Birthday Party is worth watching  we'll start with that. With that said, I'm not entirely sure where it was going or if it got there. Essentially, a Christian teen has a pool party and some unrelated & disconnected stuff happens. There's a lot of nothing and a little of quite something! I do feel there were some stronger characters who weren't given ample screen time and some filler characters who were given too much. It's an enjoyable watch  just don't expect too much. It certainly wasn't heavy-handed with any message or lesson. A drunk character's almost missable line near the end is as close as it gets to ""bringing it all together"". The idea of 'drunken honesty' was only tip-toed around and this plot could have benefited from a lot of it!",1486339200,,766,4.708955223880597

7664577,2,B01BOKDWWM,"I got this movie because of the rave reviews. It's a story of a rich minister's son coming to terms with his homosexuality. The story was convoluted, hard to follow at times, and more about the relationships within the entire family than a coming out story. It was rather boring and although the main character was hella cute... the screenplay left a lot to be desired. I do not recommend this movie1",1483833600,,400,4.569444444444445
7664578,4,B01BOKDWWM,"The plot is that Henry Gamble is going to be seventeen and his father  Preacher Bob  wants to throw a big pool party to celebrate. As he is a preacher everything is going to be done the way Jesus would have wanted  but no alcohol, provocative music or other stuff that they make up as they go along. Thing is Henry is gay  but he is still in the closet although right from the get go you can tell he is bursting to come out.

Then the party starts and as the guests turn up it seems that everyone has baggage and they are also al struggling with then inner conflicts that go with faith and desire.

Now this has been applauded and panned in equal measure and the reasons are both valid. Firstly this is al about sex and sexual.ity but it is al talk and, quite literally, no trousers. Personally I think that is ok but for the nay sayers they are right in saying it is setting its stall out to attract the wrong audience. Also it does not deal with nigh o al of the issues that are raised, from sexual identity, faith conflicts, mental health issues or alcohol.

The thing is this is really well made. Despite any real d&eacute;nouement the characters and their problems are very believable. It is well acted with only a couple of times where a character seems to be stepping into clich&eacute;-ville.
So  am slightly torn, I actually did enjoy this though  hence my rating but as I said if you want a film with any real exploration of the issues that it is based on, then this will probably not rock your world.",1482278400,,1511,4.292253521126761

7664580,4,B01BOKDWWM,"Some-what convoluted story-telling. While watching it, it was difficult to tell whether this was a ""Christian"" ant-gay film or a more somber look at the struggles of coming out. Christian proselytizing was in almost every scene, making it a very difficult film to watch. The majority of the characters were an unsympathetic sort, with some exceptions. Difficult sitting through the entire movie without feeling sick to your stomach at some of the scenes. Ultimately it is a coming out film that shows the complexities of a 17-year old coming to terms with his sexuality in a Christian household. This is a should-watch film despite the overbearing scenes.",1481328000,,655,5.130841121495327

7664582,5,B01BOKDWWM,"I became a Stephen Cone fan when I first saw The Wise KIds which is a film which, just like this one presents the LGBT reality against a group of Christian ""believers"".  It truly amazes me, as a gay Christian that so many people believe that somehow being gay is a choice when those who actually study the reality have concluded otherwise to the extent that stuff like conversion therapy is a form of child abuse.  It really got me thinking when one of the characters and older guy who is struggling with this issue in the film gets trapped in a bathroom and then tries to cut himself with a razor.  Before this happened, it was the ""Christian"" youth leaders who were gossiping behind the poor man's back without even confirming what really happened at their Christian camp the summer before.  Cone is the son of an Evangelical preacher and I now that from the time he was a teenager, he himself, like I was became aware of the hypocrisy of the phrase quoted here ""Love the sinner but hate the sin.""  The question needs to be asked and Cone uses subtlety to ask it is, ""How can you say you love the sinner without already judging that the person you supposedly care for is a sinner him or herself?  I find it interesting that once Henry's sister gets over her fake need to pretend she's a virgin and accepts the responsibility for her tryst with her boyfriend, she has no problem  fornicating and don't tell me that the straight youth ministry guy and his new wife weren't openly getting,sexual in front of everyone else.  Note that the one girl Grace who's mother forbade her to go swimming ended up watching the French classic film The Red Balloon in which the  lonely boy ends up flying away from the dull reality he lives in.  So many people at a crossroads in life and some much to discuss but the main thing is true art is supposed to be controversial and I notice that the group giving this film the lowest rating are not really giving any solid reasons as to why they are objecting.  Universal phrases like ""all of the Christians were hypocrites"", don't really prove anything and Cone does show that everyone as they understand it, is trying to love in their own way. I also find the symbolism of the pool and baptism interesting where the group gathered in one way or another reveals that many have secrets they don't want anyone else to know about. How long, for instance, once the wife leaves him, is the minister father going to be able to keep his position? Will he reject his son when Henry goes off to college and openly accepts himself against the teaching of the current church he's the pastor of or will the man have a change of heart and don't forget, The minute he does so his lively-hood goes out the window and it's obvious that the man is emotionally dependent on his wife for validation.  I recommend watching the Wise Kids and this film one after the other look at the reviews from professional movie critics which comment on how deftly  Cone navigates this potential mine field, especially in the United States where lgbt rights are in peril due to the whole ""religious freedom"" argument. When a tiny little not well known film causes some of those watching to become real uncomfortable then that is the kind of visual art on film that is worth watching.",1479859200,7,3280,4.501683501683502
7664583,4,B01BOKDWWM,"This is a world I know very well and this film is right on the money. The young actors are all very good. The writing is so specific and accurate that I am sure the writer has lived this life as well. Great direction and photography. I loved the underwater shots as well as the layered activity around the barbecue sandwich making--great attention to detail, texture and layering. This is a tightly packed day in the life of the young birthday celebrant, Henry and the direction and camera doesn't miss a single nuance. Some versions of the evangelical, fundamentalist genre of modern Christianity posits human existence in black and white-- People are good or bad and when Jesus returns or when individuals die, they are going to heaven or hell. Well, the fundamentalist Christianity portrayed here and some of the people characterized here are  facing their lives without flinching and they are using their brain to tell a different story, a story that reflects Christians struggling and thus living a life in more shades of gray. This portrayal is more honest and real and human.",1479600000,,1082,4.848648648648648

The direction and story, sensational. The dialog and characterization also sensational. Please don't think that this is a gay movie because it is so much more and that is only a very small part of this film. This is a story (pure story) about a pastor and his wife and they are throwing a birthday party for their son, who is coming into his own, mom knows dad not so much. the story involves all the guests, all evangelicals with secrets of their own and there is the story. Not just about Henry but about his friends and his church friends and his parents church friends. They want to drink, they want to show themselves and they have affairs and pre-marital sex.

7664609,5,B01BOKDWWM,"This movie was an absolutely wonderful coming of age movie for everyone.  You could feel Henry's conflicting feelings between his church and his homosexuality.  Being a Christian who attends a church with a homosexual pastor it was interesting to hear and feel all the different attitudes of the party guests, and to be honest I feel that they were so hung up on the idea of someone being different that they all turned their backs on a person that was literally going around begging to talk to someone, to the point he hurt himself.  Then the best statement of the movie was made, I think it was the defining moment of the movie.  An older man said to himself  we are doing this all wrong and then looked at one of the teens in the pool and said you, your gay and that's fine because God made you that way. Not an exact quote and to me all the tension that had been building up went away.  Just my perspective, you might get a different view but you have to watch it to form opinion, so stop reading all the great reviews and watch the darn movie.",1471046400,2,1048,4.2944162436548226

On it's own terms, the film is a well done, slice of life, experience.  There is a lot of tension in the way characters hold back and it is aggravating to watch them dance around the real issues at hand--but it kept my interest.  However, that's the point of their world.  It is nice to see the main character, Henry, taking baby steps to being authentic, but I would like to have had more time with this main character's story, rather than cutting away to all the other characters. This was sort of like a pilot to a TV series, and it might have been a good one with all the various story strains that were begun.  For now it is only our guess what will happen next for all these people.

7664625,5,B01BOKDWWM,"Just finished watching ""Henry Gamble's Birthday Party"" released by Wolfe Video.
At a first casual glance, birthday boy Henry Gamble may seem like your typical 17-year-old Christian teenager who is trying to navigate between the religious world of his devout family; and the glaring secular world of his friends who go the same public school that he attends.
Yet, just like a seven layer cake, there are many depths and emotions that just lie underneath the surface of Henry Gamble, his family, and friends.
Henry is closeted, pinning away for his straight best friend, who has slept over, to help celebrate Henry's birthday.  Prude alert:  While Henry is unable to seduce his best friend when wake up in the bed that they're sharing - Henry is able to con his way into a mutual non-touching each other j/o session between the covers.
The rest of the day gives way to a pool party where the layers of everyone in attendance is peeled back and exposed with unflinching honesty.
Henry's mother has had an affair.  Henry's sister has engaged in premartial sex with her boyfriend.  Henry's father gives into temptation and drinks alcohol.  Instead of helping a desperate young man who is crying for help, he's commits a desperate act of self mutilation in an attempt to combat his inner demons.  I found this most compelling because it's a pretty accurate portrayal of how most pious Christians never see the forest through the trees.
On a side note, my dearest friend Rick's first wife thought that only prayer, not medication was the answer to his bi-polar/manic depression and she learned the hard way.  She also didn't like me telling her that she should have known better.
Henry also loves rock and roll music, and his mother encourages his interests and there is a hint in the movie that she and Henry's sister are aware of what Henry hasn't told anyone  - well almost everyone - yet.
Henry's public school friends at the party know he's gay.  He's shocked to learn that they are too.
There is also a suggestion the youth minister of the church that Henry's father is pastor is underwent ""Gay Conversion"" therapy.
In the end, Henry makes a choice of who he wants to be and and what he wants to do.  It's hinted that his mother knows as she tells her husband before she leaves him that Henry is about to make a choice that he'll need his father's blessings for.
""Herny Gamble's Birthday Party"" is a quiet, but intense movie of figuring out who you are and going forth.
Strongly Recommended!

7664631,4,B01BOKDWWM,"""Henry Gamble's Birthday Party"" teaches the audience to prioritize people's innate dignity over arbitrary religious doctrines.  On par with the ""The Wise Kids"", this film similarly displays how unrealistic and unchallenged religiosity can be damaging to authentic living.  Many viewers will benefit from watching this film; however, Southern Christians or LGBTQ people who have evolved beyond fundamentalist worldviews will best appreciate this movie.",1464652800,,451,6.142857142857143

7664642,3,B01BOKDWWM,"A 17th birthday party for Henry Gamble is the setting for this movie which features a gathering of family and friends fully immersed in their Christian faith - so much so  that it seems to submerge everything else; and there is plenty of ""everything else"" just waiting to burst out beyond the constraints of the religious bond that seems to hover over all. One almost expects to hear a rendition of kumbaya every ten minutes. There is Henry's father who is also a pastor just getting over his wife's one-time infidelity with an elderly dying friend; a wife who feels neglected and underappreciated even though she knows her husband still loves her; a daughter who made love to her boyfriend and now can't accept what she did and doesn't want anything to do with him; a non-religious pair of lesbians who believe that Henry is gay; a young African-American close friend of Henry who only has eyes for Henry; a mother among the guests who disapproves of just about everything, especially the way young girls dress and won't allow
herself or her daughter to go into her hosts' backyard pool which is really the primary focus of most of this film's action and interaction; her husband who is itching for a drink even though drinking is supposedly ""off limits""; various other guests who may or may not be what they seem; and, finally, Henry - a very attractive young man who is the real star of this film - giving off mixed signals until the film's climax.
The overall acting is excellent and the individuals portrayed are quite credible. But the entire story seems shallow and despite several
breakthroughs - with the possible exception of Henry - gives the impression that everything will ultimately return to where it was in the first place. The pool is almost a metaphor for the initial limitations imposed on everybody's behavior. Once outside the pool, as the day's festivities conclude, there is a notable change in the attitudes and behavior of the many participants. And so ends our story and another day in the (a)typical(?) life of an American family whose only fault is that they were all striving to maintain their traditional values while trying to find some kind of happiness and accommodation with the changing world around them that becomes more
complex and complicated with each passing day.

A final note; There is a very interesting interview in the Extras with the actor (Cole Doman) who played Henry by the director which is very interesting and most informative.  The interview takes place two months shy of two years since the movie was filmed and Henry has gone from being a boy to a young man. Highly recommended along with the other Extras.",1463184000,,2662,4.782608695652174

7664644,3,B01BOKDWWM,"This is a laid back coming of age movie that delves into the lives of a Christian family on the day of their son's 17th birthday. I wouldnt call this a LGBT film. They talk about being gay, but for the most part, it goes under the radar. The film, for the most part, is slow paced which goes well with the laidback storyline. The acting is ok, but I never felt a connection towards any of the characters. The setting took place a beautiful surrounding and reminded me of my childhood. The individual storylines of some of the characters could have been expanded upon. You spend much of the movie trying to figure out what is going on in the lives of some of the characters and as the end approaches you don't feel any resolve. The movie ends and for me, I felt unfulfilled.",1463011200,2,773,4.301369863013699
7664645,5,B01BOKDWWM,"I stopped paying much attention to lgbt movies a long time ago. They were, with few exceptions, a predictable variation on two or three themes. The writing was either lamentable or just lame.  Classic examples of films that could be seen in the trailers. But after seeing films like Henry Gamble (and Andrew Nackman's Fourth Man Out and Travis Matthew's I Need Your Love) lgbt films are coming into their own. To my mind, a lot of this can be attributed to writing and production and direction that sees these characters as part of larger communities - families, friends, and in Henry Gamble, faith communities - where there is marginalization, where the awkwardness of acknowledging (if not embracing) difference, and the willingness to settle for untidy conclusions is engaged as a dramatic problem instead of ignored. The characters in Henry Gamble are evangelical Christians who are not wearing horns or played out as Fred Phelps freaks, but fundamentally decent people who are confused by the world around them. But they are also people who are trying to make room for one another with varying degrees of success and failure. Henry's sexuality is really almost peripheral - it is a an unspoken given to many of the adults, vaguely or explicitly acknowledged by many of his peers. But it is what gives the movie its thematic tension: i.e. how to reconcile one's religious beliefs with one's reality. No one - including Henry - does a stellar job but that isn't the point. The point is, for me at least, that director Stephen Cone has given us a thoughtful, often moving, depiction of people who are trying. One of the few films that I am seriously thinking of buying; it's that rich, that nuanced, and one of the best ensemble pieces - lgbt or otherwise - that I've seen in years.",1462924800,21,1784,4.773462783171521
7664646,5,B01BOKDWWM,"This movie was everything I needed it to be. Stephen Cone proves yet again that he can tell a coming-of-age-gay-young-adult story about a Christian family in an original way.

8750904,1,B01BOKDWWM,"Please - don't bother with this film... The actor's performances were fine. Just...yeah, fine. Reason being they all had so little to work with. The main issue causing the film to be so lackluster is in the script. Henry, the title character, has to be called the lead of the movie, but barely. There are so many characters all with their own issues/side plots (in what seems like an attempt to cover every single 'Gay/Religion' issue in one single 86 minute movie). Someone suicidal, interracial couple, losing virginity, marital infidelity, overly judgmental religious zealot, parents separating, body shaming, a known gay shunned, an unknown gay witnessing all of this... Jeez, Henry barely has more screen time to deal with his issue than every other stereotypically-written character here...  Then so many of this collection of sub-plots have zero resolution...  At one point, one of the few characters without overt 'issues' spouts platitudes about how Jesus wants us to love everybody, ""even the addicts, criminals, and gays"".  This may well be the last line the actress says in the entire second half of the film, ugh!

I guess the best way to say it is this - By attempting to cram so many issues/mini-plots into one single film, you're getting very little character depth, development,  or focus, as the viewer's attention/interest is spread so thin. I've known I was gay for 25 years, been fully out for twenty, and have gone to church continuously since starting Sunday school almost 40 years ago. I've lived in a town of 200 total people growing up , then in SF & Berkeley for 12, and other towns in between. Point being, I could relate only partially to two characters in the film, and on a Vee surface level... If the script had, maybe, half the characters, only 2-3 main focused issues, and moments where the plot points actually intersect with one another, I'd have enjoyed this film... As it happened, I was sadly yelling at my tv with 30 minutes left in an unheard plea to have something meaningful happen... Though the production values are very good (well above many shoddy gay-themed films), the meandering lack of story, focus, and depth of character prevent me from recommending the film...",1501977600,,2214,4.909090909090909
