8152593,5,B000JPDQAW,"Picked this up when I was about 16 and it was the first time I'd seen any of these bands play the studio stuff live; Led to many Pantera, Sepultura, Type O Negative, Slayer, etc. VHS sprees at Best Buy and Musicland back in the day.

This would make for a fun collector's item, as an historical document covering the start of the nu metal genre (Coal Chamber, PM5K,  etc.), and many bands exactly in their prime (FF, Seps, Neurosis, Slayer *maybe a stretch there*, etc.). Sepultura infamously broke up the same year this footage was shot.

I do have bitter memories too though! I missed the legendary '97 tour that arguably was the greatest metal ensemble tour ever put together -- Type O, Pantera, Machine Head (in their early prime), etc.. I hoped that an extensive live album would've been culled from that tour, but nada, likely due to bs labels handcuffing their artists' work. '98 & '99 were pretty good tours, but that was when the budding nu metal genre was first getting hijacked by radio-friendly flavors, and bands like Disturbed started showing up to play gradeschool-level ""metal"". Went the years Pantera, SOAD co-headlined but the flavor was already stale with bands that lacked heart.

Corey Taylor has attempting to curate some decent fests (Knotfest), along with some death/black metal fests that do widespread tours, but they're simply not the same as those legendary first few Ozzfests were. Sabbath, his solo career, his taste in guitarists, his voice, and Ozzfest forever cement Ozzy as the the grandad of metal. Nobody else who had that kind of money and influence had, has, or possibly ever will be passionate enough about metal to put together a comparable experience.",1421712000,,1692,4.864583333333333
8152594,5,B000JPDQAW,This is the only video I have been able to find regarding Ozzfest other then the 10th aniversary DVD. This VHS tape has 1 song from each artist that performed at the 1st Ozzfest in 1996. It is great to see these bands before they made it big. I would have like to see more of Ozzy performing on this tape but it is still cool to have and watch.,1322438400,,344,3.9285714285714284
