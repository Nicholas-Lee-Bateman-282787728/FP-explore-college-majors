7876920,2,6304774362,"This movie is categorized as a comedy but is really a soft porn movie.  The character ""porno guy"" appears to have sex which makes this movie alltogether innapropriate for minors or tasteful adults.  I think it would make more scense if the producers released as an adult film the short porno movie starring ""porno guy"" which runs within the ""Hijacking"" movie. They should, in effect, scrap Hijacking Hollywood, and release the adult flick that has created all the buzz.",1065139200,,469,4.924050632911392
7876921,3,6304774362,"I found this movie disturbing.  It is one thing to watch a movie expecting to see a lighthearted plot centering around hijacking and ransoming a movie by a production assistant, but it is another to watch a dead dog get shot at and a revolting porn scene with a guy that makes Ron Jeremy look like Tom Cruise.
I have read the reviews below and was appalled at the porno guy's scene.  What the hell was that guy wearing?  And the facial expressions he was making...heinous.",1058832000,,472,4.465116279069767
7876922,2,6304774362,"So, what exactly is the deal with that shady porno guy -- Mike Mant -- who appears in this movie??  He seems like like a decent guy despite his incredibly poor acting skills; what was the deal with his facial expressions? I know he was trying to replicate the look of guy in the middle of having sex, but he instead had the disturbed look on his face of a guy who has just been put on the clock because he has been dating a girl for years and just found out that his good friend got engaged after dating someone for only eight months. He really needs to work on his acting skills.",1030665600,,580,4.087719298245614
7876923,5,6304774362,"[...] Neil Mandt, Henry Thomas, Scott Thompson are all hilarious! and all those stereotypes are humourous. They make fun of themselves and their surroundings. If you know who Scott Thompson is(Kids in the hall) you will appreciate his performance. This film is meant to make fun of a mock urban hollywood. It is brilliantly funny. And if it seems ""cheap"" at times thats because its an INDIE FILM people.....Sit back and relax and enjoy this film I watch over and over again......oh and mr. anti-catholic guy get a life and stop dreaming about little boys.",1025654400,,555,4.852631578947369
7876924,5,6304774362,"Very funny. Neil Mandt, Henry Thomas and Scott Thompson are hilarious. It's about a man trying to make his movie ""3 Days in a Salt Mine"" but he can't. So he takes the footage of Moby Dick 2 hostage so he can get  the money for his movie. And what's the big deal with this porno guy  Micheal Mandt. He's only in it for five seconds and there's no nudity of  him so no big deal. Just your normal comedy movie.",942105600,3,407,4.0
