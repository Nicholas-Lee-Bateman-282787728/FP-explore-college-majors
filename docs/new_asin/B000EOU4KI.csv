8112181,5,B000EOU4KI,"I have purchased this dvd twice because I like it so much. I use it to teach and I use it with parents to educate. There is nothing that I have found that illustrates a master teacher's response to a child tantrum as well as this video. The solutions are effective, respectful and well presented.",1457913600,2,296,4.4
8112182,4,B000EOU4KI,"I ran across this DVD in the library at the preschool I work at. Though a bit dated, the DVD gives great strategies, from talking to children to understanding why some children are defiant, for beginning teachers and parents. In the video, a child starts to kick and scream when she can't sit next to her friend during circle. How does the teacher respond? Amazingly. She removes the child from the room, lest she hurt another child. The child starts to punch and kick at the teacher. The teacher tells her you need to calm down your body. I can't let you go back inside until you calm down your body. Finally, after what seems an eternity, the child calms down and the teacher has a drawn out conversation with the child, acknowledging the child's anger, and brainstorming ways of how the child could have approached her feeling of injustice differently. The dvd goes on to cover such problems as children who won't clean up or tear up other children's work, seperation anxiety, logical and natural consequences. The price is hefty, so I'd suggest that you get your school/company to pay for it. The DVD is great information but not worth paying when there are newer videos and books on the market.",1198195200,3,1199,4.660377358490566
