6934230,5,B00RQJPNFU,"This box set has a lot of action, there's a lot of reanimated battles. Like Mifune fighting Hanzo of the Salamander & the Ino-Shika-Cho team facing their former teacher Asuma Sarutobi. Also, Tobi summons the Gedo Statue to battle at the Coastline, a few more things happen & I find this box set to be quite interesting because the 4 th Great Ninja War continues to rage on.",1430092800,,373,4.5

6934232,5,B00RQJPNFU,just finished watching all 12 episodes yesterday. OUTSTANDING! plenty of 9 tails action & the fillers where used well. Loved seeing the growth of Naruto's classmates. especially Choji... everything is coming to a climax.... must buy!,1429660800,3,233,5.5
6934233,4,B00RQJPNFU,"If nothing else, this is probably my favorite package cover for the entire NS series so far, with the picture of Hinata on Volume 13 being a very close second.  Ino finally gets her picture on a package cover and she looks stunning even while wearing a ninja utility vest that completely conceals her bust.  Also a great picture of Killer Bee on the reverse side, but it's almost impossible to NOT make Killer Bee look awesome.  Supposedly Orochimaru's former right hand man Kabuto is bringing back a lot of guys from the dead and I hope that Jiraiya, Asuma, and Itachi are among them.  But don't bring back Deidara; that guy was a jerk.",1429574400,,637,4.51304347826087

6934235,4,B00RQJPNFU,"Even though I'm giving it 4 stars, I think this arc ends up being a huge letdown .  It's the 4th Ninja War.  We've only heard that Ninja Wars existed but never has there been a full blown Ninja War in the Naruto series.  We get it and it doesn't live up to the hype.  I was hoping for many great fights like we saw in the Chuunin Exams or the Sasuke Retrieval arcs, but out in the open battlefield with groups fighting each other and single fights breaking off too.  That kind of happened, but not the way you'd want it to.  The fights were all pretty lame.  The Gold and Silver Brothers should have been great and that felt like filler even though it's not.  What should have been the best arc of Shippuuden wasn't and was probably not even in the top 3 arcs of Shippuuden.  Huge Disappointment.",1423267200,2,796,4.218543046357616
6934236,5,B00RQJPNFU,"I've Seen the Japanese (English Sub) version, now I finally Get a Chance to see The English Dub version!

6934262,4,B00RQJPNFU,"I love Naruto but the DVD's have got lame after the Lord Pain conflict, you just can't run on that level and keep it up. Got all the DVD's up to now and enjoy the series. A little expensive for a cartoon series but then something I want. I probably need to start with the whole program and start again including the series before Shippuden besides waiting after I get the latest in for the next 3 months for the new ones. When they come in I usually watch the 10 or so episodes in a day or two.",1433116800,3,494,4.0
