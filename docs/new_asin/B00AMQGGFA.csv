5451497,5,B00AMQGGFA,"I bought this DVD set for the movie Blood Vows... Melissa Gilbert is an excellent actress... Shame she didn't know what she was getting into when she met her ""prince charming""... He really did love her but because he was part of a mafia family he chose to do what they wanted.. Hope you enjoy the movie..",1377043200,,304,4.350877192982456
5451498,5,B00AMQGGFA,"I have seen Blood Vows before & liked it a lot. The actors in this one are great.
Alphabet City is another thing....movie was ok, but nothing to rave about. I mainly took advantage of the pricing & was interested in getting Blood Vows. If you like Mafia movies, like I do, I highly recommend.",1375401600,,292,4.327272727272727

5451563,4,B00AMQGGFA,"Blood Vows gets 5 stars.  I saw this movie on TV years ago and it left a lasting impression.  Enjoyed watching it again and will watch it many more times, I'm sure.  Alphabet City is another story -- if there was a way to give it 0 stars, I would.  The movie got off to a very slow start and although the synopsis sounded good, it was not interesting at all.  There was also much, much, too much profanity.",1464825600,,406,4.0886075949367084

5451591,5,B00AMQGGFA,"I purchased this DVD set solely for the purpose of watching Blood Vows. I had seen it years ago on Lifetime, and of course, since it is a movie from the 1980's, it is no longer aired. It is a shame, because I think many of the thrillers and dramatic movies from that period are much more compelling and exciting than what is shown presently.

It still holds up and although I knew the ending, it still was as enjoyable to watch. Joe Penny does an magnificent job portraying a ""Prince Charming"" role until the end, when he is tested and his true colors are finally revealed. Unfortunately for Melissa Gilbert, loyalty to his family took priority over her health and safety.

I would definitely recommend this movie. I haven't watched Alphabet City yet, but this set is worth the price for Blood Vows alone!",1449964800,,805,4.544827586206897

5451621,5,B00AMQGGFA,"Blood Vows: What can I say?... I like fashion and bad boys. I like this movie even though it's an ""oldie"". Great quality and service from provider. Alphabet City is a joke but I had no choice, I didn't want to wait for amazon to replenish stock for Blood Vows so I got the double corn dog. I will watch the rest of AC... some day?! It's a great story that ""Little House on the Prairie"" girl stars in (her name is on the tip of my tongue?!). You should google it and find out! I did! I can watch this any time, every year.

I remember loving it, so i purchased it only to find that i still enjoyed it. Joe Penny is marvelous and melissa Gilbert is really convincing. However, Alphabet City bored me to tears. I stopped watching it after 15 minutes. It was painful and I just couldn't stand it any longer. I doubt I will ever pop that in to finish watching it",1387065600,9,477,4.195652173913044

Love Joe Penny, he's so sexy and sensual... Even His big family problems!!!!!!",1381881600,2,147,5.125
5451629,4,B00AMQGGFA,"Always wanted this movie, which was a little pricey at first.  Joe Penny is a fine romantic leading man.  He was charming and ruthless at the same time.  Melissa Gilbert played the damsel of the Prince Charming and happily ever after dreamer nicely.  It pays to be cautious of that charming person, who moves too quickly to steal one's heart.  Melissa was that person.  Joe was handsome, smart, and successful.  She couldn't understand why he picked her. It was apparent that she was lonely, and fell right into his trap.  Though I felt he truly loved her, his life was too dangerous.

Melissa was not like the other wives.  Her character was strong and independent.  Joe's life was filled with violence and secrecy.  This was more than Melissa could handle.  Though she truly loved him, she had to make a choice, which would prove all too dangerous in the end.

I did notice a part cut from the movie, maybe more since it's been so long that I've seen this movie.  If one's a Joe Penny fan, then this movie is good for it's day.  It's not very violent or bloody.",1381795200,2,1063,4.486910994764398
