8751985,5,B01BZE3XIU,"This event is their traditional two night ""All Star Weekend"" event & with Amazon not separating each night's show, I'll review them both here.

Night One:
Tag Team Champions Young Bucks returned to P.W.G. for the first time in 3 months to defend their championship against the team who defeated them to gain the I.W.G.P. Jr. Tag Team Championship in Ricochet & Matt Sydal in a match that saw both teams go aerial both in & outside of the ring with the Bucks utilizing double team offense including new innovations along with a tribute to a former partner while Ricochet & Sydal were able to use the Bucks against each other numerous times & have some creative athletic offense of their own individually & as a team.  Adam Cole faced off against Zack Sabre Jr. who was set to face fellow Mt. Rushmore member Roderick Strong for the P.W.G. Championship the next right with Cole's heavily focusing on a specific area of the body utilizing submissions & different areas of the ring only for his arrogance to work against him on more than one occasion with Sabre taking advantage with his various stretches & submissions along with giving Cole literally a ""taste"" of his medicine at one point & later making a statement going into his title match.  Roderick Strong had a non-title match against Mark Andrews with Andrews able to keep staying a step ahead by reversing & countering Strong along with executing aerial maneuvers while Strong heavily working over the back area utilizing an area of the ring to his advantage to the point where you saw that he was more focused on making a statement than winning a match.  Other matches include Kyle O'Reilly made his official in-ring return against Marty Scurll in a highly competitive evenly matched submission based contest from start to finish; Drew Galloway vs. Trent? that was all about one man delivering a huge beating but his opponent refusing to quit; Trevor Lee vs. Chuck Taylor in a back & forth match that had it's entertainment moments; and Chris Hero vs. Evil Uno with Uno living up to his name ""Evil"" with the tactics he utilized.

Night Two:
The long awaited P.W.G. Championship match finally occurred here as Roderick Strong defended against Zack Sabre Jr. with one man who's been a victim of Strong's political power plays over the last few months finally taking matters into his own hands before the bell with Sabre working over different joints of the body to the point where his opponent felt the effects when applying his own offense while Strong lived up to his moniker of ""Messiah Of The Backbreaker"" punishing the lower back area as both men had similar strategies of using different areas of the ring & submissions & taking high risk including a battle that had the crowd chanting ""Holy..."" with the second word not being what anyone expected.  Tag Team Champions Young Bucks faced off against reDRagon that started off with a double hockey fight followed by the Bucks getting the one thing they always demand from their opponents with an unexpected result from this ""sleazy"" pair with both teams utilizing double team maneuvers while each having opportunity to use their opponents against each other while some other dirty tactics came into play as it ultimately came down to one team beating the other into exhaustion.  JT Dunn made his debut teaming with Chris Hero as Death By Elbow against Ricochet & Matt Sydal in a highly competitive encounter with Ricochet & Sydal showcasing their aerial maneuvers along with displays of athleticism while Hero & Dunn displayed some athleticism of their own & lived up to their team name utilizing that powerful elbow in different ways along with other impactful offense.  Other matches include Adam Cole vs. Trent? in a back & forth encounter; Drew Galloway vs. Trevor Lee in what Lee states as a battle of ""TNA Superstars"" only to reference another part of Drew's past causing a bad reaction with him utilizing his superior power & strength only for Lee to showcase some strength of his own in a physical match; Mark Andrews vs. Evil Uno with Uno continuing to use tactics that lived up to his name with Andrews relied on his aerial offense including unique variations from different areas of the ring including showing an ""evil"" side of his own; and Chuck Taylor vs. Marty Scurll with Scurll living up to his reputation of ""The Villain"" only for Chuck to match him with some of his antics in another back & forth encounter.

World's Cutest Tag Team & Mike Bailey & Chris Hero teamed up here to face Mount Rushmore 2.0 (Roderick Strong & Young Bucks) with Adam Cole who returned the previous night with an agenda to take over P.W.G. showcasing that by attacking two people associated with the company before the match began that had brawling all around ringside with them using whatever possible from chairs to their own title belts along with many more weapons to what they used on Joey Ryan to give him a ""superkick vasectomy"" in a battle that got so out of control that other's got physically involved including one man that nobody saw coming.  Will O'Spreay faced off in the first time meeting against Kenny Omega that was a physical clash of styles including an entertaining moment where one of Omega's unorthodox methods of attack was used against him.
