8129531,4,B000G8NVTI,"60-minute DVD (with chord charts) - Originally released on video in 1992 (but now available on DVD in 2006), Nick Forster's ""Country Swing Back-Up Guitar"" is a straight-forward approach that demystifies the unique style for accompanying western swing or Texas fiddle tunes. Forster, of course, played electric bass in the ground-breaking bluegrass group, Hot Rize, while they were together from 1978-90. We were treated to his swinging guitar when the entertaining band's alter-ego group would appear from the back of their bus. When Red Knuckles and the Trailblazers would take the stage, Nick was known as Wendell Mercantile on the six-string.

The keys are to provide a moving bass line and to give the backup a percussive bounce by dampening the strings and eliminating or minimizing sustaining notes. Forster teaches some basic music theory about the notes that make up chords, how chords get their names, and how to make your own chords. Some charts come with the DVD. In the finest form of guitarists like Eldon Shamblin, Hank Garland or Jimmy River, a country swing chord progression is demonstrated at various tempos for the fiddle standard ""Sally Goodin."" The same progression in the key of E is taught. Chord shapes in the key of F are shown for their application to such songs as ""Deep Water"" and Bob Wills' ""Brain Cloudy Blues"" which almost entirely uses 7th and 9th chord voicings. It is important for guitarists to understand how to play in closed chord positions so they can be transferred to other keys on the fingerboard. With the addition of moving bass lines and the percussive effect from dampening strings, you'll be ready to win the accompanist award at the national old-time fiddlers contest in Weiser, Idaho.
