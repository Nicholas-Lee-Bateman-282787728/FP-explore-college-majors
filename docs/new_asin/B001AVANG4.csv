8279864,2,B001AVANG4,"I'm a diehard Warcraft 3 fan, so I'm glad to own this just for the sake of having a collector's item, but it's not the greatest item in general. There's one amazing video that shows the storyboard and early animatics of Medivh's Warning, and there are some cool concept art pages, but besides that, there's really nothing to write home about.
There are some pictures of the development team of Warcraft 3, which are fun, but to access them you have to answer silly trivia questions. Overall, the DVD is laid out really oddly. Rather than narrating things, the DVD designer made it so you have to skip back and forth between slides and just read text. As for the director's commentary, it's kind of boring and monotonous and doesn't really give much interesting information (and honestly, you can just find those on YouTube anyway).
If you're not a collector like I am, this DVD isn't worth your money.",1473465600,,901,4.672955974842767
