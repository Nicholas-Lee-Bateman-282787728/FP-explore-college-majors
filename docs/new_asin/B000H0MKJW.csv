8135787,3,B000H0MKJW,"This is supposed to be more ""true to the point"" as a love story for the underclass, but it comes off as more of an exploration of how to feel superior since it does not go into the ""why"" of what happens, the structure of ""how"" the two who headline this wound up as members of some disposable underclass, and doesn't have a true resolution, it simply runs out of story and leaves you hanging as to what the male intends to do.

The concept was great, the delivery is good, but falling from greatness to kinda good is a painful fall.",1271894400,,531,4.205882352941177
8135788,5,B000H0MKJW,This movie is one of a kind. I will tell you that it is a heart wrenching love story that you don't want to miss. The actors are magnificent. Specifically the newcomer Xavier Jimenez-March. You need to get this movie and tell all your friends about it.,1162512000,4,252,4.382978723404255
