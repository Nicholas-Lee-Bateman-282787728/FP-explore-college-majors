2268891,5,B00097DNWG,"This dvd beautifully details salsa dancing for what it is ""caliente"" and takes you to the stage.  Crafting it into a beautiful sensual Latin dance that you can learn. You feel the power, the primal rawness, the sensuality of every move.  Yesenia makes you feel as she is teaching you directly to dance.  I really enjoyed it and can n't wait for the next one that is released.  I would recommend it to anyone that wants to learn Salsa.",1372377600,,434,4.455696202531645
2268892,2,B00097DNWG,"This video is informative however it really really isn't salsa. Its more like Latin inspired pop moves. I'm a beginner at salsa and thought this would be an interested way to add variation in my dancing. But the whole first half of the video were things that ANYone that knows like ANYthing about salsa would know. Then the second half has steps that are salsa inspired but don't fit the dance.

So if your going to a salsa club for like one night and want to have some introduction then get the dvd, If you are GENUINELY interested in learning salsa, do yourself a favor and pass. Take a class instead that way you'll know what to expect with a partner.",1353283200,5,654,4.404958677685951
2268893,5,B00097DNWG,"If you like your salsa ""hot n spicy"", here it is! Yesenia Adame  offers her second and very delightful salsa  instructional DVD. She is simply adorable to watch, and exudes the confidence in technique to set one at ease while learning intricate footwork.
 The contents of the program begin with a welcome and a short lecture on timing used in salsa, an introduction to the musicians who are live on the program. Next a warm up which incorporate the basic isolations , such as body rolls, Cuban hips, which are done to live music.
This program offers three combos which are delightful to learn and more so to dance along to so that anyone can quickly dance without previous experience. If your partner opts out, its ok, because this is salso solo!

Combo #1 is full of fun easy movements. Begin with Cuban hips and  the basic footwork, arm placement wrist and  hand position. If you are ready to move on, Front taps, side step w arm flourish follow. For more variety, add the cumbia step and stylized turns.  Sexy hip rolls are next and really add the sizzle to the salsa.
Combo # 2 is my favorite! It begins with fabulous movements such as ""pop n roll"" and the sexy side step with arm and chest movement. The movement progresses as traveling steps are layered with hip movement, a very cute front tap with a skip, and more side steps but this time layered on ""cha-cha-cha"" hips.
Combo#3 gradually evolve a more challenging sequence with rock steps, pivots and the grapevine layered on hip rolls.  Each section above ends with a follow along practice sequence to voice cues, then again without voice cues.

I enjoyed this program immensely and learned much from it.  I hoped for a full choreography/solo performance by Yesenia which would have added to the spice!",1341187200,8,1762,4.65483870967742
2268894,4,B00097DNWG,"Sexy Salsa: Learn sassy, stylish combos quickly
Grab your swishy skirt! If you're new to salsa, a flouncy skirt and a pair of high heels are your best friends because they can make the simplest moves look good. That's what the lovely Yesenia Adame proves in her second solo salsa DVD for women, the first being called just that: Solo Salsa.
The enticing preview for this video made me remember my salsa days and I immediately decided I would have another go at the dance once I got my review copy. Of course, I could have also chosen to work with my copy of Solo Salsa, but this one looked so fun.
The format of the two DVDs, Solo Salsa and Sexy Salsa, is very similar. If you don't have either, any one of the two will do just fine; they're in no particular order and are of the same difficulty level. If you have Solo Salsa and want more, think of Sexy Salsa as two additional combinations - the first of the three combos is again, the basics.
Solo work DVDs for women who are totally new to salsa are hard to come by. There are a few, but the focus is more on styling for eventual use in partner dancing. In that sense, this video and its predecessor are unique. They've been created assuming you want to dash off to a party and look good on the dance floor without too much effort and obsessing over the intricacies of the dance. If you don't happen to have a partner - just grove these moves. If the people around you are salsa dancers, keep up with these steps and you certainly won't look half bad. If you find yourself dancing with someone who knows his salsa, you'll have an idea of the basics and can try simpler partner moves. Or you can just use these for a good workout at home because salsa always makes for a light aerobic exercise session - every part of you moves and there's enough footwork to keep you on the go. The extended arms moves fit right in to keep your heart rate up. And the salsa rhythm is so wonderful, you can't help but want to dance. It certainly wakes me up more than most forms of music.
A quick explanation of the salsa rhythm leads you into the program. There's a warm up during which you also learn some of the isolations and movements you'll use. Like how to move your hips or roll your shoulders. There are three combos on this video, each made up of two or three moves strung together or spiced up with styling. It really looks cute, flirty and totally enjoyable. And as Yesenia says, very sassy. I distracted my brother in law by playing the preview one too many times until he wanted to pounce on all three dancers.
Yesenia's style of teaching is just fine. It would be, since she's also a TV personality and will be more comfortable than most in front of a camera. She breaks down the moves and repeats them enough times. Working with the video, I could see I've quite forgotten my salsa and am definitely back at the beginning, except that I haven't lost my understanding of the rhythm. I didn't find it as easy as I thought to get back to doing even these few steps. After all, you need to get the look, the isolations, the style. Leave it too long and you lose it. The steps are taught viewed from the front and the back - just as in most classes. Two other young women dance to either side of Yesenia. I wish they weren't there just for cosmetic reasons though. One could have had each of them showing the moves from different directions instead of doing the same identical things. This would, in fact, have perhaps allowed for a whole other combo to be squeezed in because it may not have been necessary to repeat the moves facing the back.
While it's all quite fun, I do have a few other issues with this DVD. From the preview, it would seem as if there's a thorough explanation of the rhythm. We actually spend only about three minutes of it and I'm not entirely sure the emphasis points in the percussion are that easy to get for a beginner with this tiny tutorial. I think this mini section could have been made far better by say, tapping the rhythm out with the feet a few times and getting us to follow along. Also, the pauses in the rhythm are not easy for beginners to understand. Even when this is taught in person learners keep saying, huh, what pause?
Another quibble I have with both Solo and Sexy is that the first combo shouldn't be a run-through of the basics. With only three combos on each video, all three should really have been ""proper"" steps other than the basics. I know I wouldn't want to get on a dance floor and just do the basics. Anyone who's familiar with salsa will look at me funnily and wonder why I'm practicing my basics there. There should be enough steps to take you through a while song without too much repetition, but several consecutive rounds of the basics isn't the same as a full-fledged combo.
What I do like a lot about both the videos is that they really capture the joyous nature of salsa. In fact, I never realized that until I watched Sexy Salsa. Everyone talks of salsa being sensual, but it's also a very happy dance. Other dances have markedly different flavors. For instance, I'm a belly dance enthusiast and learner and that form of dancing takes on many emotional layers if the dancer chooses to let it. Salsa is plain sexy and happy. I also like that the difficulty level of the steps seems just about right and steps haven't been explained with a lot of salsa jargon. Many dance forms have their very own snobbishness and from the classes I attended and other videos I have, I can see that there's an ""insider's"" language that can be quite intimidating. Yesenia skips all that quite nicely.
My rating of 4 for this video doesn't mean that this video is any less nice than Solo Salsa. But once something's been done, doing it pretty much the same again doesn't mean this video is stellar. You set a benchmark and when you meet the same benchmark with another product, you don't necessarily get higher ratings. Both DVDs are very nice; one can choose either; and you can even choose both but then be ready for some repetition.",1339718400,15,6031,4.380909901873327
2268895,5,B00097DNWG,"Dancing salsa with a partner is fun, but so is dancing alone, where you are free to move around and do any move you want, and go where the music leads you. Yesenia Adame shows us how to get started, with this excellent instruction DVD. Yesenia starts out with percussionist Manuel Carro, showing us how to find the ""one"" count. Sometimes salsa is done starting on ""two,"" but here we start with the ""one,"" which is the easiest way to keep the rhythm going. Yesenia then moves into the Warm-Up, a salsa inspired set of moves that will help limber  up your body with isolations and get it ready for those ""Cuban hips."" Yesenia dances with 2 assistants throughout, Ashle and Nicolette.

We then move into the Instruction section, which is very detailed but retains the informal and spontaneous feel that runs through this DVD. You have the feeling that you're in a real class, rather than watching a rehearsed and edited video. One of the things that adds to this informal feeling is that you have a live band in the studio, the terrific Enrique Luis Lopez Cuban Trio.

We then move on to the section where you learn and dance the combinations, and really have fun. They are ""Combo 1, 2 and 3"" and they are practiced with both Yesenia giving verbal guidance, and then just the music, at a faster tempo. You don't need any expertise to follow the instructions on this DVD, just energy and the willingness to ""Release your inner diva."" It ends by kicking off your shoes, and doing a lovely ""Cool-Down,"" where you stretch everything out and relax. Here's to dancing salsa....solo!!",1338336000,5,1574,4.634408602150538

In this DVD, Yesenia teaches new Salsa patterns and techniques for adding style and shines to your dancing. One of the things I appreciate most about Yesenia's approach, and the content of this DVD, is that she teaches you the foundation and tools you need to go beyond simply following the moves, and actually learn Salsa. I like that her style is down-to-earth, authentic, and personable, unlike some other instructional DVD's that are cheesy and cheerleader like.",1374710400,,590,5.030612244897959
