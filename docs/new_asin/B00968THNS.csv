5272607,5,B00968THNS,"Loved, loved, loved this movie!
It isn't your typical bible re-counting.
I like how they show the application being acted out.
This isn't a fast acting movie, but, has some important lessons that are good for everyone, especially teens!",1362700800,,236,5.076923076923077
5272608,5,B00968THNS,"This movie has lots of meaning, all the world should watch and practice. Watch this if your marriage s in trouble.",1359936000,,114,4.476190476190476
5272609,4,B00968THNS,"Samwise Gamgee is back but as a youth pastor! But really, the actor that played Hosea was the one that made the greatest impression. The story is great and the picture of how the people were breaking God's heart with their unfaithfulness came across loud and clear. The love and integrity that Hosea displayed in the movie was incredible - you see the love he has, the patience, the heartbreak, and the compassion. Definitely worth seeing.",1358380800,3,439,4.7894736842105265
5272610,4,B00968THNS,"Ashley, Carrie, Cooper, Steve and Gameboy are all going on a youth group camping trip with their youth pastor, Stuart and his wife Beth.  The kids are all pretty tight as many youth group kids are with the exception of Ashley.  Ashley is a beautiful girl who has a bit of a self-centered attitude.  She is going on the trip because her grandma is pushing her to go.  Her attitude is to just get through it.  This annoys Carrie to bits.  She doesn't appreciate Ashley's snobbishness and has her own preconceived notions about the new addition.  Steve however thinks that Ashley is just misunderstood and needs a chance.  Of course with a big chip on her shoulder, Ashley doesn't make it easy for anyone to give her that chance.  She feels no one understands her or what she has gone through.

Things don't go terribly well with the kids and Stuart decides to share the story of Hosea and Gomer with the kids.  The story of Hosea is a story of God's love for His stiff necked, rebellious and disloyal people.

Amazing Love is two stories in one.  The main one really is the telling of Hosea and Gomer.  The secondary, story involving the kids really unfolds first.  That part is good, but the real heart and soul that is going to get you is Hosea.  What is cool though is how in the end, it all really intertwines so well together.  Hosea learned how God felt when Israel turned their backs on Him and worshiped false idols.  He felt it on the level of being a man married to and in love with a woman who was completely unfaithful to him.  There was a line in the story that really hit home for me where Hosea is talking with God in anguished prayer not understanding how God would love this unlovable people who did not act loving toward Him.  He said ""You love us because your love is not dependent on us.""  Awesome right?

I am going to stop here in order to not give much away.  Although let's face it, you can read Hosea and get the gist of that story, but this one is really told well.  Yep, I kind of cried a bit.

The movie  does not have difficult themes for kids.  I would say it a story that would be acceptable for about ages 12 and up.  Just keep in mind that Gomer was not a very faithful chick.  Nothing is seen but her unfaithfulness is obvious.",1357948800,14,2259,4.286729857819905
5272611,4,B00968THNS,"The director used an interesting approach - showing an expanded story of Hosea and Gomer, which is not supported or denied by scripture, as a story being told by a youth group leader trying to demonstrate unconditional love toward a young lady who is struggling to fit in anywhere, especially at a campground with a bunch of church kids. At times the switchbacks are reminiscent of The Princess Bride as the youth group members interrupt the story being related to them to offer personal opinions about the unfaithful wife and her doting husband. The Hosea part of the filming was awesome - the youth group part not so much, but still commendable. This is definitely a film that should be shown in all youth groups. I'd highly recommend that Christian parents of teens add this one to their personal film library.",1357689600,4,813,4.773049645390071
5272612,5,B00968THNS,"Amazing Love, Directed by Kevin Downes, is a great movie for families and youth groups. It is a sharp reminder of the danger of cliques. The scenery is incredible and the scenes (flashbacks) to Israel and Hosea are spot on. I plan to show this to our church youth group.",1350345600,21,270,4.42
5272613,5,B00968THNS,"I personally love this movie. It may be a bit cheesy for some movie critics, but I really enjoyed this movie. I watched it first on Netflix but they took it off. I liked it so much I bought a copy when they took it off Netflix.",1515196800,,227,3.851063829787234
5272614,5,B00968THNS,This was a story I was not familiar with; this story is from the Hebrew Bible.  It is a testament of God's unwavering forgiveness.  A story for all faiths.,1513382400,,155,4.310344827586207

5272618,5,B00968THNS,This is a five star movie.  It has a great message and the setting they cast it in amplifies that message.  They take one of the most forgotten stories in the Bible and give it a modern-day application without compromising the Biblical truth of the story or creating an unrealistic situation in the modern-day setting.  I do wish they would come out with a Spanish version as this is the best way I have seen the message fro Hosea ever presented.,1509926400,,446,4.481481481481482

Great example of God's unconditional love for us as well as a message of being kind to others because you never know what causes a person to behave differently.  Love and understanding go a long way.",1507420800,,318,4.448275862068965

5272626,3,B00968THNS,"A beautiful story, this movie had the potential to be fantastic.  The movie started really good as the group was leaving for a camping trip.  Once they arrive at the campsite the movie continues to be moving along well.  The film then switched to Israel which was wonderful.

During most of this movie, the scenes would switch back and forth from Israel to the campsite, which was really good.  But the camera work could have been so much better at the campsite.  Instead of the camera capturing a cozy view of the campers sitting around a campfire with a nice wilderness background, the camera only zoomed in on each individuals face.

You could barely tell they were at a campsite.  Then it would switch back to Israel and the story of Hosea, which again was wonderful.  But every time they switched back to the campsite, the camera did super close ups on everyone's faces, completely leaving out the rest of the group and the beautiful surroundings.

Had the video camera not zoomed in so very close and taken a wider angle of the campsite to include the surroundings, for me it then would have been a really enjoyable movie.  I just was not on the same page with the director or who ever was in charge of the actual video shooting of the film.

Erin Bethea turned in her usual fantastic performance and the rest of the actors also performed well.  So a more detailed breakdown, I give 4 stars for the story, 4 stars for the acting, to be kind I will not even rate  the camera work.  On a positive note, they did include some beautiful footage of the countryside of Nazareth, but it would have been nice to have seen much more of the gorgeous scenery across the Holy Land.  Would have also been nice to include more of the wilderness around the campsite.

Amazing Love could still work as a witnessing tool for troubled teens.  God can certainly take our mediocracy, and have it yield blessings a hundred fold as Jesus did with a few loaves of bread and couple of fish.

I would like to share thoughts on some Christian movies you may enjoy: October Baby, Camp Harlow, Miracles from Heaven, Letters to God, A Box of Faith, and of course, Fire Proof and Facing the Giants.

Another really good dvd was WWJD what would Jesus do?  This stars John Schneider.  Great for witnessing.  This movie was followed up by WWJD the woodcarver, which basically showed 2 people sitting down talking about the Bible.  They certainly meant well, but I was looking for more.  The third movie in this saga is called what would Jesus do?  The Journey Continues.  This is a continuation of the original again with John Schneider.  Not as good as the first, but a good dvd with some help from the fast forward button at times.

77 Chances is a very different type of movie.  Rachel Hendrix and Erin Bethea are such blessings in this film, I would definitely recommend the movie, if you don't mind fast forwarding on occasion.  A bit like 50 first dates except the message is to learn to listen to what God is telling us through our difficult circumstances.

I recently ordered and expecting to arrive soon This is our Time and The Redemption of Henry Myers which I am really looking forward to.  Almost forgot, last month I watched a dvd called Saving Winston which was also pretty good, especially as a witness for struggling teens.

Finally I would like to share something I always do before watching a movie that you might want to consider.  I put the dvd on and leave the screen on the main menu and then I pray for everyone in the movie.

I pray for the writers, producers, directors, actors, and actresses.  I pray for anyone who has ever watched the movie and anyone who ever will.  I pray for their salvation, witness, health, happiness, safety and loved ones, and for them to praise Jesus with their lives.

As I watch the dvd, I receive a lot of joy knowing I have prayed for everyone in the movie.  It gives me more of a connection with them, especially knowing the hope of actually meeting them one day and becoming great friends for all of eternity in Heaven.

God's richest blessings to all..",1495497600,5,4086,4.5197817189631655

A youth group have gone camping and the leader is trying to interest these young people in the book of Hosea and God's command that he marry a prostitute named Gomer. This is a tough one for teens so the way he weaves their story with God's love for His people Israel with Hosea's love for Gomer is often difficult for even adults to grasp.

Expanding the story of Hosea, but including word for word recitation from the prophet's book, we are given a picture of God's great love for us, His pain when we reject him, and his desire to rescue us when our own way has gone horribly wrong.

I never thought he was in anything worth watching accept Rudy. Anyway, this movie tells a believable story and illustrates that love doesn't depend on the other person loving you, but YOUR COMMITMENT TO LOVE THEM, no matter what. In this I saw why Jesus as he hung on the cross said: Father forgive them for they know not what they do. The pleasures of sin are short compared to the life of regret it brings.

This movie is well-made: it's mostly centered on the Hosea story, with a background story about a broken-hearted girl, which is told in a campfire & storytelling setting, and we learn how it applies to us and how we should have God's eyes to love as He does (and showed with Hosea) it also ties the significance of Hosea's story with the Cross of Jesus Christ and how Christ is Hosea for each and every one of us who have forgotten Him and looked for ""other"" to confide and delight in.

I wish there were more good positive movies like this. You leave feeling the love of God and His power. Unlike most movies in theaters done by Hollywood that are mostly disappointing and doesn't leave you anything but waste of time and using my Lords name in vain and watching people have sex.

The story was well done and I appreciated the way it was made clear where they were adding their own spin on the story and not trying to pass it off as the Word itself.  It is scary to see some of the movies come out that add to or take away from the actual Word.

5272737,3,B00968THNS,"This movie is told as a story within a story.  A group of church youth go on a camping trip and there are some interpersonal issues.  So the Youth Pastor tells them a story around the campfire.  That story is the story of Hosea, which we see historically dramatized.  To be honest, the production value is not quite up to Hollywood standards, but it's good enough.  And some of the young actors are not that strong.  But I was very impressed with the handling of the Hosea story and it's meaning is communicated very well.  Sean Astin as the Youth Pastor does a great job with what he has to work with (a very simple character with very little depth, but effective enough to get the job done, which is to tell the Hosea story).  The Book of Hosea is not a very popular book of the Bible, but it tells a very fundamental story about the heart (and the heartbreak) that God has for all people that everyone needs to hear and understand.  Regardless of the somewhat mediocre production value of this movie, there is some real moving and effective content in this film; enough to where I would recommend this movie for anyone interested in what the God of the Bible is about.",1466380800,8,1171,4.409302325581395

It follows the Bible book Hosea and his story to parallel God's love for his people. I thought the acting was good and the story moves along well. The interactions between the characters and how the story would end was a bit obvious but it didn't bother me. I would recommend this movie to any individual and especially to families for a family night movie so that you don't have to worry about what your kids will see or hear.

It portrays a terrible youth culture of apathy and disinterest in the things of God.

The story takes place in present day and tells the story of hosea by a youth pastor relating it to his group. It makes you think about how betrayed God has been by us all and also how He loved us so much that He bought us back with His son Jesus while we were still in the middle of our spiritual adultry.

Often we have been unfaithful to our spouses; often we have trashed our spouses for being unfaithful to us. Yet, day by day we have been unfaithful to GOD nevertheless HE LOVES us more and buys us back from the enslavement we push ourselves into, HE heals our wounds and pays our debts even the debt of death paid on the CROSS.

A story that needs to be told in our time and unto this generation!",1393632000,,664,4.2204724409448815

5272870,5,B00968THNS,"Bible readers & believers usually think of being faithful to God but Hosea is a prophetic book about God's faithfulness to His
people. If you have not studied covenants, you will see the OT versions as well as the New covenant in & through Jesus Christ.
God loves His people but time after time in Judges, Samuel, etc, God calls Israel His wife & His son due to their relationship to Him. But many times He has to say, you Stiff-necked people, Hebrews ,..& christians. We can go through the motions of worship, connection & servanthood to our Sovereign Lord but we must be aware of times we are proud, lazy or even deceptive (to ourselves) in our worship of God. This is the Hosea story. I won't elaborate because it's only 14 chapters long. Read it today & see how God
loves His people as Hosea love the harlot. We may like harlot but there is spiritual prostitution &, if applicable, we need to own up to it. Great movie for youth & adults.",1387756800,3,942,4.388571428571429

5272874,5,B00968THNS,"I loved this movie, it would be a GREAT movie to show to a Youth group at church as I believe this movie teaches not only about Hosea, but it has a GREAT message about acceptance and how we all are going through things at one time or another and how we should not judge others because of their seemingly standoffishness.... (if this is a word).... I was shy as a young teen, and was going through things at home.... had no friends and I could relate to this girl..... thank you Beverly Patton",1379635200,,492,4.24468085106383
5272875,4,B00968THNS,"This movie is basically two stories in one and shows them intersecting. A small group of youth group kids go camping with their leader and wife and experience some inter-personal conflict. The leader starts to tell the story of Hosea and his wife Gomer from the Bible (with many liberties and assumptions taken). When this occurs, the movie switches to actually show that story unfold. Periodically, it comes back to the kids discussing what they're hearing before jumping back to the story. When it's all done, the impact of the story has an effect on the kids as they discover the depth of God's love for them and how they should extend that love to others. I found the way that this movie was done to be an excellent way to tell the story.

Before watching this movie, I kind of expected it to be a bit ""cheesy"" and the acting to be poor. I must say that, although at times it seemed to skirt around the ""cheese line"" a bit, it never actually crossed it, and the acting - while not great - was ""doable"". This definitely has a ""lower budget, t.v. movie"" type feel to it.

All things considered, I felt this was a perfectly fine movie for what it was - and I left it feeling encouraged myself in God's love for me. I think this movie could be especially worthwhile to be shown to youth groups - as I actually thought the kids' performances came off reasonably well and I think other youth group kids will be able to relate. Because the Hosea/Gomer story does involve Gomer's unfaithfulness to Hosea, this may not be the best for really young children, but for appropriate ages, I think this could maybe work as a ""family night"" movie also.

The only thing is ..i wish they would have explained ""harlot"" better and how back in that time period how big of a thing it really was.  I don't see this as winning souls because without a background of understanding-it does not produce anything.

Also think this would be a GREAT movie for movie & popcorn night at the church (if the church ever did this).  ALso great movie to show teens-but it is kind of slow and younger children will probably not be interested at all in this (age 10 and under).  So to be perfectly honest -i am not sure sunday school or children's church would work all that well.
Other than that--it is a good movie and will help people to dig a little deeper in the bible to find out why God told Hosea to go and marry a harlot-Gomer.",1375920000,,1015,4.111675126903553

5272892,5,B00968THNS,"This movie is a well made well acted movie about God's amazing love. This movie is a must see for youth groups! I know from when I was in youth group that there are a lot of cliques in youth group and church, but church is not an exclusive club for those who fit a certain mold. This movie shows that we need to live out Christ's love and gives very practical ways. The movie flashes back to the story of Hosea and Gomer and really explains how much God loves us. I would highly recommend this movie!",1367798400,,500,4.112244897959184
