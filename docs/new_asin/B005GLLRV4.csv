8471817,5,B005GLLRV4,"A few hours before the big Mayweather/Ortiz fight, I popped in this DVD to get pumped up. GRANDES PELEAS Vol. 50 illustrates several stages in a professional boxer's career. Saul Alvarez represents the young blue chipper with stunning potential and universal appeal. JuanMa Lopez is the cautionary tale, demonstrating that sometimes a blossoming career does get derailed. We note Wilfred Benitez, the Puerto Rican teenaged prodigy, achieving the summit of his profession, as well as Manny Pacquiao's harnessing of his skills and his perseverance in the face of several clashes of heads and a tough, awkward adversary.

- Wilfred Benitez vs. Antonio ""Kid Pambel"" Cervantes (March 6, 1976, ringside commentary in Spanish)

It's a bit ridiculous when you contemplate a seventeen-year-old kid winning a championship belt in the rugged Sweet Science, a feat accomplished by the mighty Wilfred Benitez over three decades ago. It's even more impressive when you factor in that those were the days when bouts were contested for fifteen rounds and conditioning wasn't just something you do to your hair. And then there's Benitez's opponent, Kid Pambel, who was a fully mature 30-year-old with 86 professional fights already under his belt. Good thing there's no such thing as a Puerto Rican/Colombian rivalry, because boricuas would have serious bragging rights over this one. This was a good scrap with a lot of give and go, as evinced by the judges' split decision. Ultimately, Benitez, a natural born fighter and the self-styled ""Bib1e of Boxing,"" had just enough to pull it off. At seventeen years old.

- Saul ""Canelo"" Alvarez vs. Ryan Rhodes (June 18, 2011)

Cinnamon's education as a pugilist continues. The reigning heir apparent to Oscar de la Hoya, Saul Alvarez, heavy-handed and ferocious but poised, dominated his latest ambulatory punching bag from the United Kingdom, Ryan Rhodes. Whereas Canelo's last opponent, Matthew Hatton, was moving up in weight, Rhodes was very much at ease at the 154 pound division, had in fact never lost a fight at 154 pounds. Streaks are meant to be broken.

To demonstrate his maturity, Canelo (which means ""cinnamon"" for his red hair) never got caught up in the hype of fighting in his backyard of Guadalajara, Jalisco, Mexico. Instead, he maintained a sustained attack of combinations featuring body blows and his thundering right hand. Alvarez's commitment eventually eroded Rhodes' resolve, sapped his will, reconfigured that stiff upper lip. This was pretty impressive behavior from a guy who at the time had not yet turned 21. A Canelo flurry in the fourth round would send Rhodes to the canvas for only the sixth time in his career, but it heralded the utter drubbing about to come. The ringside commentator pointed out a touching tale behind the ""26"" tattoo on Rhodes' shoulder and trunks, and how it was in honor of his wife and his kids all being born on the 26th. It was a touching anecdote, and maybe someone should've whispered it into the hometown hero's ears. Maybe then he would've eased off on Rhodes, who, to give him credit, was durable enough to last to the twelfth and final round, at which point the referee mercifully waved off the fight. Now can we please put Chavez Jr. and Canelo in the same ring?

- Manny Pacquiao vs. Jorge Solis (April 14, 2007)

This scuffle wasn't as ugly as the Pacquiao/Agapito Sanchez debacle, but you won't have poets in berets languidly discussing this fight's aesthetic merits. One could say that Pacquiao didn't bring his A game on this night. You could also say that Solis' long reach and awkward style befuddled Pacman for the first six or so rounds. Several unintentional headbutts also distressed the battling Congressional candidate. A cut over an eye seemed to finally serve as a wake-up call and even a telling left hook in the seventh round by Solis wasn't enough to put the breaks on Pacquaio's freight train assault. Two knockdowns in the eighth round, and Solis called it a day. Still, for those who've seen Pacquiao easily govern his bouts, this one was pretty disconcerting.

- Orlando ""Siri"" Salido vs. Juan Manuel Lopez (April 16, 2011)

Hands down, this featherweight barnburner is this DVD's jewel, its featured attraction. After JuanMa's grueling disputes with Rogers Mtagwa and Rafa Marquez, I was very curious to see how he would stand up to Salido's demolishing right hands. It turns out: pretty decently. That it, until he absorbed too many. I was scoffing at one ringside commentator's remark comparing Lopez to Roy Jones, Jr. in terms of defensive slickness. Salido torched him all night, and the wear and tear finally took its toll on JuanMa. Dang-diggity, this was a thriller, a straight-up combustible classic that holds up with the best of the Mexico/Puerto Rico rivalries. For Mexico, there's even the added satisfaction of this fight having been contested in Puerto Rico.

You can sooner discourage a born again Bib1e thumper than Orlando Salido. He is persistent like a leech; he is one of those gritty, plow ahead combatants. He probably thinks ""retreat"" is when you buy someone dinner for a second time. His right hand is colossal, his chin heroic. JuanMa ate tremendous right hands all night long until he finally started wobbling like a weeble. But you cannot dismiss Salido's ability to absorb JuanMa's ferocious pounding. He acted like Lopez's barrage was a ticklefest. A Salido left hook-right cross duo late in round five put JuanMa down. Round Six was massively entertaining as Salido continued to administer pain and the visibly hurt JuanMa demonstrated his great heart by firing back. Round seven, amazingly, belonged more to JuanMa as he pressed back. But Salido was determined to uncork right hand after right hand, and he really staggered Lopez again in the eight round, to the extent that the referee stopped the fight, with Lopez still standing and retaliating. This controversial and, I thought, premature stoppage is the only thing that marred a spectacular fight.",1316217600,2,6004,5.031187122736418
