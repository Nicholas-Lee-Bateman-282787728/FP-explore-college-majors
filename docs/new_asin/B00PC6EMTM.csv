8687355,4,B00PC6EMTM,I would have enjoyed it more if the season had been more competitive.,1456876800,,69,4.384615384615385
8687356,5,B00PC6EMTM,"I ordered one from a seller and noticed it said ""Picture Format NTSC"" and ""Region Code 2"" on the back of the DVD case.  At their suggestion, I opened the package and tried the DVDs on 2 of my players.  To my surprise, they played fine.  I think the manufacturer misprinted the case since my DVD players are all Region 1 players.  Now I'm about to go watch the review for the rest of the night.  Great!!!

If you have a set that say ""Picture Format PAL"" and ""Region Code 2"" they won't play.",1429142400,,489,4.148936170212766
