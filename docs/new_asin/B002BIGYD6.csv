8361537,1,B002BIGYD6,"To view this DVD you must use a computer and you will not be able to navigate it as you are accustomed to.  There is no, stop, pause, fast forward, rewind, or most importantly a RESUME.  If have to leave the video you need to start again.  There are chapter titles in the menu but there are no titles to reference while watching the video as to which one you are in.  The video is roughly 2 hours in length.  The audio while clear has multiple occasions where the microphone is rubbing and the speaker has become tired or confused and tries to correct what he has just said.  These sections should have been recorded especially since we are hearing him describe a painting and not seeing him.",1372723200,,692,4.3671875
8361538,3,B002BIGYD6,"Maybe good as a starter with a good variety of visual examples but overall it's a very academic, not inspiring presentation. Explanations are quite vague at times and contain many inaccuracies about the physics of light and the physiology of color perception, as well as some very subjective views on art history. It makes almost no reference to modern techniques of color reproduction, such as photography, video and digital media. It's not terrible and will get you through the main concepts of color theory but you may be left hungry for something more consistent.",1367366400,,567,5.042553191489362
8361539,2,B002BIGYD6,"For the price of this DVD, it should not require installation of special programming before a computer will play; for that matter, the bloody thing should play on any device.  The info contained is comprehensive, and closely mirrors the information contained in James Gurney's indispensible book, ""Color and Light.""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Color-and-Light-A-Guide-for-the-Realist-Painter/dp/0740797719/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Color and Light: A Guide for the Realist Painter</a>",1351728000,,526,7.766666666666667
8361540,5,B002BIGYD6,This is a valuable lesson in light and color! I struggled with these things quite a bit before I got this dvd and the Jeremy Vickery one as well. I Personally like this one more. I also think it is unfair so many people are giving it negative reviews because the dvd didn't work. I had the EXCACT same problem of the dvd not playing on my mac with os Lion. But I contacted the workshop and they gave me an easy work around to get to the files. It is a dvd-rom and needs to be played on a computer but that is perfectly fine by me.,1348185600,3,530,3.9166666666666665
8361541,2,B002BIGYD6,"There's alot of good information here, but I had to install 2 programs from the CD-disk to get it to work on my computer.

There are 4 lectures on the disk, each about a half hour long.

However, the 2 programs that were on the CD to make the disk play....they don't have a pause, FF or rewind function. You start it up and hope you don't get interrupted. If you have to stop it for any reason, you have to restart the CD from the beginning of each lecture.

I find it terribly misleading to call this a DVD and then on the back of the DVD have a place that gives you a minimum operating and computer system requirement.

It will not play on ANY of the DVD players I have in my house. It will not play on my X-Box or Playstation platforms either. I find that to be really off-putting and probably would not have purchashed it had I known ahead of time.",1329523200,5,852,4.083832335329341
8361542,1,B002BIGYD6,"I cannot get the DVD to play on my brand new iMac (Lion 2011) or our DVD player. I can view the pdf files, but not the DVD. I guess I will be returning it.. bummer!",1318377600,2,164,3.5833333333333335
8361543,4,B002BIGYD6,"I am pretty impressed with the materiel covered in this dvd. I attended a well known college on the east coast for design and was severely disappointed in the course I had in color theory. The school being my 2nd college was overall a good experience, but some courses really stunk. As important as color is to understand as a designer, I was disappointed and wanted to find supplementary materiel. I had already purchased Practical Light and Color by Jeremy Vickery, which is very good as well,  and felt like this would be a nice compliment, and it was. I learned more in this dvd about color theory than I did in a semester at college, with some minor instances. I had to mark it down a star because the author had some moments where he stumbled over himself, and rather than just reediting the scene they left it all in, also sometimes he gets cut off in mid sentence as the slides change. The dvd also comes with a pdf of notes that were spoken about. Overall, I feel this is well worth it, and could potentially save you thousands of dollars and several months of lectures.",1300060800,7,1079,4.44949494949495
