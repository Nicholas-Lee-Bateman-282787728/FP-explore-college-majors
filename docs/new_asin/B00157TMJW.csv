8326110,5,B00157TMJW,"This is easily one of the most violent and gory gangster movies to come out of Russia. The hero, Major Korenev, exacts revenge upon those who framed him. The anti-hero, Shaman, is a hilarious take on Marlon Brando's Godfather character. Korenev lays breadcrumbs that lead all the crime bosses and their henchmen to a sticky demise. Meanwhile,  Sukhorukov's character is a complete whacko, would-be gangster, who makes his way through the movie leaving a growing trail of bodies and blood. Relative to the main plot, he and his few associates seem to be from another planet. The mafia bosses, who lack any scruples, participate in the chaos and anarchy in a futile effort to achieve superiority. Their lack of trust, loyalty and principles seals their fate. Sukhorukov's character is at the other end of the spectrum from Korenev. He has principles albeit nihilistic in nature. His ending is even more gruesome than that of the crime bosses and clans.
[ANTI]KILLER is a visual and auditory gore-fest that rivals Speilberg's ""Saving Private Ryan"" for realism.",1260748800,,1057,5.074712643678161
