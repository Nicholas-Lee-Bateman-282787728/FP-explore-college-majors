2197851,5,B0006ZP4FU,"This is a great video for a beginning gymnast. My daughter is able to practice the moves while watching the video. I know nothing about gymnastics and being a parent of a gymnast, it showed me from the beginning what my child is learning which enables me to help my child practice at home.",1126828800,24,289,4.37037037037037
2197852,5,B0006ZP4FU,"Our 5 year old daughter loves this video.  She is glued to the DVD, absorbing the tips on posturing and shapes; she was mimics skills that improve her posturing, especially performance shapes that make gymnastics so beautiful.  The DVD seems slow if you aren't the one in action, however the instruction has to be slow and steady to give time to absorb the information and to prevent injury while the kids practice.  This video is a great complement to practice time beyond the gym and for something to do on rainy days. We recommend that a girl have 1 - 2 years of gymnastics and developed basics skills of core front roll, cartwheel, bridge, splits and basic kip bar experience. Our daughter has been a gymnast since she was 2 years old and seems to be learning a lot.",1410912000,3,770,4.525179856115108
2197853,4,B0006ZP4FU,Great for first time Gymnasts. Step by step directions with a coach and gymnast. My 6 year daughter learned how to name each exercise.,1392595200,,134,4.625
2197854,5,B0006ZP4FU,The young girl I bought this for was extremely happy with the DVD. She is just starting gymnastics and she really likes watching the DVD & practicing.,1366070400,,150,4.592592592592593
2197855,5,B0006ZP4FU,"I finally gave this to my daughter for her bday and she absolutely loves watching it.  She said at times it does get a little boring to watch but it's necessary because the instructor is teaching (Go figure....a kid saying that teaching is boring...HA).  Overall, she loves it and is benefiting from watching it.  And she clears the furniture in the living room and goes along with the DVD.  Great purchase from a great seller.",1359504000,,427,4.653333333333333
2197856,3,B0006ZP4FU,"It looks like a lot of parents of gymnastics like this video and that's great.  I was a gymnast as a kid and it reminded me of my time in the gym, but I felt like there was not enough information. I would have liked to see some more tips on spotting and helping gymnasts to progress from one skill to the next one up.  I was hoping that I could use the info to help me teach my girls some gymnastics at home but it didn't give me any new information.",1354838400,4,450,3.880434782608696
2197857,3,B0006ZP4FU,"The video was good, just what I thought it would be. But it was expensive.",1284768000,,74,4.0
2197858,2,B0006ZP4FU,"My daughter has been doing gymnastics since she was 3 years old (she is 6 now). When I bought this DVD, I hoped that I will be able to put it in and my daughter can have an additional workout at home when she does not have classes at the gym. It might be very good and valuable for a coach, but not something to practice at home. I expected a full work-out with a warm up and stretching routine, gradually transitioning to more complex flexibility exercises. The whole sections on the beam and bars we could not use, since that required going outside to use the apparatus (unless you have those in your living room).

I'm stil looking for that great DVD that I can put in and my daughter can have an additional workout at home, while she is not in the gym.",1284595200,20,756,4.213793103448276
2197859,5,B0006ZP4FU,"This video is very, very good.  It's well worth the price for someone wishing to learn basic gymastics skills, learn about the various apparatus used in women's gymnastics, and learn the names of basic skills, stunts, and techniques.

Steve Nunno, a two-time Olympics coach, U of Oklahoma coach, and coach to numerous elite athletes, narrates this instructive guide.  He is so pleasant, encouraging, soft-spoken -- and he knows exactly how to talk to and instruct the most inexperienced beginners in the most basic of skills -- it is difficult to imagine that he also coaches the world's finest gymnasts.  The only time he seemed anything other than laid back was when he was explaining just how much fun vaulting can be if you understand how to do it.  His emphasis is on keeping it fun and helping kids overcome the fear factor.

This video is no-frills and no-nonsense.  It shows several young women gymnasts demonstrating skills using what Nunno refers to as ""progressions"" -- building on skills one step at a time to learn how to perform increasingly difficult skills.  Nunno provides clear instruction on proper body position, alignment, and technique.

The focus is on beginning skills.  The video covers biomechanics, stretches, and basic floor skills -- forward and backward rolls, cartwheels and roundoffs, and back walkover on floor.  On the balance beam, the most challenging stunt is the roundoff dismount.  The sections on vault and uneven bars are excellent in showing how to get started on the apparatus, working up to more challenging skills.

There's plenty in here that you could do at home -- and the instructions are so clear and the moves so basic that most kids could follow along on their own. Great video for parents and kids alike.",1235692800,19,1757,4.955631399317406
2197860,5,B0006ZP4FU,"Agree with all the positive reviews above, it has neat and precise instruction that is crucial but easy to follow, very nice demonstration.",1227052800,3,139,5.086956521739131

8044197,2,B0006ZP4FU,"Very basic. Doesn't give you much as a coach to work with. Only a few basic skills and preparations for all floor, beam, bars, and vault. I'm hesitant to buying the advanced level dvd.",1469491200,,184,4.4411764705882355
