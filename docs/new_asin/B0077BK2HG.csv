8511679,5,B0077BK2HG,"My sons, 5 and 8, always want to watch this movie.  Krishna and his friends are so lovable.  My kids like to see Krishna fighting the demons and making mischief.  There are so many laughs for us all.  I love the portrayal of the story where Krishna is being bad and his mother tries to tie him up to punish him but the rope keeps getting shorter and shorter with Krishna saying with a sad face ""no tie!""  Anyone who wants to share Krishna stories with their children in English should buy this!",1387152000,3,494,4.268817204301075
