As a journalist for more 30 years, I know how incredibly difficult it is for Americans to find a good, concise, compelling history of countries outside North America and Europe. Pakistan's story is incredibly complex -- and, given its central role in the so-called War on Terrorism -- it's a vital corner of the world for Americans to understand.

This two-hour documentary was produced for the 60th anniversary of the creation of Pakistan, so it was completed in 2007 and is the most up-to-date documentary overview of this region that you're likely to find. Nearly all of it is in English and it's powerful footage -- produced at the level of a History Channel or a National Geographic Channel special.

There's footage here that I don't recall seeing in other films about the region -- and I've watched a lot of video and documentary material about Asia.

Naturally, a nation as complex as Pakistan has a huge array of entrenched viewpoints on its past -- and its contemporary figures as well. No one would argue that this film will satisfy all viewers who understand Pakistan -- but it does seem to steer an accurate middle course through most of these 60 years of tumultuous events.

Note that this film, of course, was finished before the death of Benazir Bhutto -- and she does appear in this film, giving her side of the story, but her recent death is not mentioned. Also -- the nearly half an hour of additional footage is well worth watching in this case. Don't miss the remarks of journalist Steve Coll, who talks much more extensively in the supplemental materials.

If you're part of a small group that talks about global cultures and issues -- this is a great choice.",1212019200,7,1911,4.706586826347305
