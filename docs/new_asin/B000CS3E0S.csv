The second show has Johnny Cash and Jean Shepard who does Slippin' Away which I always liked.  And The Hagers od a rather good version of My Maria.  And Buck Owens does Cowboy Convention.  All the music is good and of course there are the skits.  And the girls.,1493769600,,424,4.225

The musical guests include Johnny Cash (Big River and City Of New Orleans), Tommy Cash (Always Be That One), Donna Fargo (Funny Face and Superman), Jean Shepherd (Slipping Away and Hello Phone), Charley Rich (Take It On Home), The Hagers ( I Believe In Music and Maria), Buck Owens (Walking The Dog, Cotton Fields, Rocky Top, Cowboy Convention, and Is Anybody Going To San Antone), Roy Clark (I Saw The Light, Come Live With Me, and So Lonesome I Could Cry), and George Linsey does a buck and wing dance to Mountain Dew.  The Hee Haw Banjo Band does a couple of traditional numbers, and Tennessee Ernie Ford makes a cameo appearance.  If you like country music that is 40 years old, and jokes that are older, you should enjoy these programs.",1408838400,,799,4.573426573426573
