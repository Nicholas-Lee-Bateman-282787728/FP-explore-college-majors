2183145,4,B0006FO5CS,My 5 yr old boy at first said he hated this dvd. I asked him to sit and watch it one time all the way through with me and his 2 yr old sister. He now loves it and wants me to buy all of them. I hadn't really watched it as a kid but love Muppets and Jim Henson in general so I thought this would be fun. big thumbs up. The 2 yr old got a little scared by some of the characters but now she just laughs and yells at them.,1198713600,,419,3.4680851063829787
2183146,5,B0006FO5CS,So So cute!! I purchased it for my son but have found that I watch it as much if not more than him!,1163030400,2,99,3.347826086956522
2183147,2,B0006FO5CS,"My wife and I grew up with the Fraggles, and we were very excited to share them with our young daughter when we learned the episodes were coming out on DVD. This is the first collection we picked up, and we have to say we're a bit disappointed.

First, where are the opening theme song and closing credits on each episode!? The title of this collection may entreat you to ""Dance Your Cares Away,"" but you will not be able to dance them away to the song with that line in it. Not only do we NOT get the infectious Fraggle Rock theme song (and its introduction of the main characters for those not familiar with the series!), we don't get the closing credits, which deprives us of the chance to learn who the performers are.

Second, the seemingly random selection of episodes makes it difficult for a new viewer like our daughter to really understand what's going on. For example, The Trash Heap freezes perilously in ""Blanket of Snow, Blanket of Woe,"" but having never even seen the character before, why would my daughter care? My wife and I remembered the characters, but as an introduction to the series, this is a poor collection.

Third, well, how does a Henson fan put this? The episodes seemed somewhat less than inspired. We've been spoiled, I think, by the really sharp writing on recent Sesame Street work. Perhaps it is just this collection of stories, but our daughter wandered away from the television, and my wife and I found ourselves tempted to do the same.

Then, of course, we learn that the full first season of Fraggle rock will soon (if not already) be available. With twenty-four episodes plus bonus features, it looks much more attractive at its price (around $45) than this four episode collection which we purchased for around a third of that price.

Lesson learned: we should have waited for the full season sets, and skipped these random collections. If you really want to experience the fun of Fraggle Rock, I recommend you do too.",1119312000,71,1959,4.63400576368876
2183148,5,B0006FO5CS,"I'm sure i'm not the only one who couldn't wait to see Fraggle Rock on DVD. It's still not a complete season but we'll take what we can get. On this particular Dvd as it mentions above it features the episodes:
1. Boober Gorg
2. Blanket of Snow/Blanket of Woe
and
3. Inspector Red.

Other fun fraggle features not mentioned: a look into different ways Doc and Sprocket are seen around the world, Fraggle-oke Featuring the songs ""I'm a little Stew Pot"" and ""Blanket of Snow, Blanket of Woe,"" and a trivia game that unlocks the episode ""Home is where the trash is,"" featuring the oh so evil villian wander mcmooch.

You also might recall a fraggle rock animated series that sometimes would show up on Disney channel. An episode from that is also included where boober convinces everyone to leave Fraggle Rock.

A Non Fraggle Feature is a short claymation film called Pingu, about a family of penguins. I found it to be a fun surprise to be included.

This Dvd really doesn't skip out on content so have fun watching the episodes like you remembered them. If you've never seen the show I'm sorry for using such cryptic language. If you Enjoy Music and Adventure your sure to love this dvd. It's truly for the kid in all of us.",1105488000,17,1223,4.495495495495495
2183149,5,B0006FO5CS,"I received this DVD on Friday, Jan 9. That night my 2 year old granddaughter came to spend the night. She loves the Fraggles and this makes the 3rd one that we have bought.

  We have watched it approximately 6 times now and she still laughs at something different each time.

  She is now the owner of 4 of the 6 main character Fraggles and the DVD's and is excited each time she plays with them or watches the movies. If I could only go back and be her age once again and watch it with her.

  I would recomend it to any parent or grandparent.",1105142400,8,545,4.066037735849057
2183150,5,B0006FO5CS,"I got the first DVD and this one for Christmas.  Apparently it's not coming out till Spring, but my parents got both copies from the same store.  It's great and has a bonus episode if you answer all the trivia questions correctly.  Can't wait for the whole 1st season to be released.  We used to watch Fraggle Rock ever Monday night at 8pm on HBO.  They have such great lessons in ever episode.",1103932800,5,394,4.342465753424658

8041397,4,B0006FO5CS,"Recently, I was clearing my parents house out and found a box of old toys, including a bunch of Fraggle dolls that I had as a kid. When I mentioned this to my sister, she said she heard that Fraggles were making a comeback with a new movie coming out. Sure enough, when I checked Amazon, the complete series was available. It was such a joy to see this again. This is a great show for kids (or nostalgic adults). The puppetry is great. The show is very musical, but the songs (by and large) aren't corny or annoying. Some of them are actually a bit tender. The episodes often deal with themes like prejudice and the environment.

That being said, I'd recommend getting the newer&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Fraggle-Rock-Complete-Series-Collection/dp/B002LYD2LW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Fraggle Rock: Complete Series Collection</a>&nbsp;DVD set. It has the complete series (as opposed to just a few episodes as on this product). For the price, it's a steal. I hope you enjoy your time ""down in Fraggle Rock""!",1277337600,,1056,5.36144578313253
8041398,5,B0006FO5CS,"This brings back great childhood memories and I am glad to be able to share it with my son.

There aren't many shows that come on nowdays that I like for him to watch- not really into the anime like stuff or most of the stuff on Cartoon Network.  Though he does love Spongebob.",1236384000,,277,4.111111111111111
