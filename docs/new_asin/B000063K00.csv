7959231,2,B000063K00,"Malcolm McDowell has had one strange career:  after his electrifying appearance in CLOCKWORK ORANGE, he went on to do other lesser roles, but always manages to give good performances (look at THE BARBER).  However, he can't save this rather lifeless attempt at subtle horror.  McDowell plays Ben Carter, a kindly elderly gardener, or so it would seem.  For some reason, the writers give McDowell this rare (aren't they always) disease that makes him age faster.  Looking 60, he's really only 35.  This plot device serves no logistic purpose, and makes one wonder if they didn't do it to get McDowell.  At any rate, the flashbacks to when he was a teenager are hilarious---Malcolm still looks 60, but he wears a wig and prances around like one of the Munchkins.  Anyway, his only friend betrays him, and wants to find the perfect purified woman.  Hence, he is killing women and making them into flowers.  (The effects on this are quite haunting, almost of a cartoonish value, but look rather beautiful). Anyway, Angie Everhart, the Sigourney Weaver of the police force, believes McDowell is responsible for the disappearance of her friend, Iris.  (NOTE:  Iris leaves her car there, but no one seems to be concerned she's in any danger?).  The eternally lovely Olivia Hussey has a brief scene as McDowell's aunt, who raised him when his real mother ran off and got killed in an auto accident.  Richard Grieco comes on like a combination of Ernest Borgnine and Al Pacino in his role as Everhart's boss and former lover.  Everhart has a ridiculous scene in a motel room while spying on McDowell, and the movie climaxes expectedly with a confrontation between the gardener and the girl!
Clever if derivative idea, ruined by stunted direction and quite bad acting, especially on Everhart and Grieco's part.
The finale in which all the girls appear in the flowers is reminiscent of LITTLE SHOP OF HORRORS without the laughs.
If you are interested, rent, don't buy.",1085356800,3,1957,4.887878787878788
7959232,1,B000063K00,"A really bad movie with an uninteresting storyline. Richard Grieco is in it like only 10 minutes - but it's not like he could have really saved a movie. Anyway, this movie isn't worth one's time.",1074729600,4,195,4.444444444444445
7959233,1,B000063K00,"WOW!!!Now  this  is  bad  bad  bad  bad  bad  bad  bad  bad  bad  bad  bad  bad  bad  bad  bad  bad  bad  bad  bad  stuff!  Angie  Everheart  is  completely  terrible  at  acting  in  every  sense  of  the  term,  and  her character'skull  is  thicker  than  the  width  of  her  fake  ones!  And  that  is  saying  alot!  I  mean  watching  this  you  feel  that  there  should  be  a  new  term  other  than  dumb  blonde,  like  maybe  bumb  redhead!  And  the  villian  is  played  by  Clockwork  Orange(  that  was  a  great  one  by  the  way  )fame  Malcolm  McDowel.  The  Garden  of  Evil  is  proof  that  Malcolm's  career  is  officially  downhill.  His  performance  is  a  far  cry  from  terrible,  but  he  can  under  no  circumstances  save  this  terrible  film.  Heck,  Tom  Sizemore  or  Al  Pacino  couldn't  save  it  either!  The  story  is  about  a  serial  killer  that  kidnapps  women  and  turns  them  into  flowers  in  his  garden.  Hooked  yet?  There  should  be  an  Academy  Awards  for  worst  straight-to-video  movies,  this  would  qualify.  And  that  is  saying  alot,  because  just  about  every  straight  to  video  movie  is  rottingly  horibbly  bad.  A  life  preserving  warning:  Do  not  be  fooled  by  the  cool  box  art  and  or  the  misleading  description  on  the  back!  Amazon.com  truly  does  not  have  a  low  enough  rating  for  this  ....  Zero  stars  is  not  even  enough,  one  must  refer  to  negative  stars!
-5  stars  is  my  real  rating!",1033948800,12,1518,4.504273504273504
