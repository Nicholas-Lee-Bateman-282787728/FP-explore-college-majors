8723757,5,B0117TP5NE,Amazing show. Can't wait for season 4,1454112000,2,37,4.428571428571429
8723758,5,B0117TP5NE,"Outstanding entertainment!!!  One of those rare shows where the character development works so well and the plot thickens so methodically, it's hard to stop watching. You learn a lot about how things happen in a Prison - truth or fabrication, it's irrelevant because it really makes you think about consequences.

And as a bonus - you learn a lot of Australian culture and slang. Oh yes there's a lot of ""They lesbianing together"". Pennsatucky

It's 01:10, I'm on episode 10, and I ain't going to bed til it's over.",1453680000,3,515,4.764044943820225
8723759,4,B0117TP5NE,"I would give a 5+ star review considering how much I loved this season of Wentworth, but unfortunately the 4th disc with the extras was unreadable - my DVD read ""error-bad disc"". The bonus features are a big reason why I decided to purchase the season, since I can watch the episodes on Netflix, so I was extremely disappointed by this. I have emailed the seller to ask if there is any way that they would be willing to replace the 4th cd or send me a link to view the content some other way. Depending on their response, I will update my review accordingly. As for Wentworth, I enjoyed Seasons 1 and 2, but Season 3 is simply amazing. Can't wait for Season 4, though the wait may be a while here in the US.",1453507200,2,707,4.205882352941177
8723760,4,B0117TP5NE,"I've enjoyed the acting, writing and plot of this series.  However, like any strong work, I think it's getting a bit stale and not sure I'll continue on as they become available.",1451606400,2,178,4.5625
8723761,5,B0117TP5NE,"This is one HELL of a TV show!
I use that word to describe ""Wentworth"" (aka ""Wentworth Prison"") because life inside its maximum security walls is a living hell!
Forget ""Orange is the New Black"", or movies like ""Caged Heat"" if you're looking for ""women in prison"" stories to compare this to.
Oh, Wentworth has its requisite lesbians, shower scenes, a sadistic female warden (called a Governor in Australia, where Wentworth is from), and frequent violence.
What it doesn't have is ""light"", ""happy"", or ""funny"".
What it DOES have are great stories, characters, writing, and acting, plus some good music interspersed throughout.

I've watched all 3 seasons, but none of them through Amazon!
That's because the only DVD's of the show are PAL--not good to watch in the US or Canada.
So I saw the first 2 seasons (2013 & 2014) through Netflix, and the 3rd season (2015) through DailyMotion (and SoHo).
The 2013 season had ten 45-50 minute episodes, while the 2nd & 3rd seasons had 12 episodes each, for a total of 34 episodes.

The main characters (in seasons 2 & 3) are ""Frankie"", a 30'ish lesbian biker girl, the ""Governor"" (the warden, but called ""Governor"" in Australia, where the show is from), Joan ""Freak"" Ferguson, the Governor, and Bea Smith, who is featured in all 3 seasons.

When Ferguson becomes the Governor, she finds herself overseeing a turf war between Frankie and Bea.
One of their competitors was eliminated at the end of season one!
Bea is in for the attempted murder of her abusive husband.
She has a teenage daughter (Debbie), who she will do anything to protect!

Ferguson promotes an insecure deputy with a dying mother to be her 2nd in command.
There's other prison personnel--male and female--and a variety of other inmates--who are involved with everyone else in various ways--all of whom complicate (and fight against) Ferguson's attempts to clean the prison of drugs.

This is one incredibly brilliant show!
(I enjoyed watching 2 seasons of ""OITNB"", but this show is a world apart--figuratively, and literally, speaking!)
I ""binge-watched"" all 3 seasons because I HAD to!!
Once one episode was finished, I was compelled to watch the next episode to see what happened next.
If this were a book, it would be called a ""page turner"".
It's that good!
PLEASE---someone put this out on ""Area 1"" DVD!!
(Why are so many great ""foreign"" TV shows & movies available only on ""PAL"" DVD's??)
Watch this.
(On Netflix & DailyMotion, if you must!)
It's worth every hour of sleep you'll lose!",1447372800,7,2497,4.865882352941177
