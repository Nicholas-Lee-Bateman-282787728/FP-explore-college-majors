3455616,5,B001AOHPXA,"Evil Dead 2 is a horror comedy deliberately trying to be cheesy.  It works because it's not trying to be visually believable, it's just having fun.  There's no way as a viewer you won't either.  The most fun couple go to a remote cabin, wake up an evil spirit when they play a tape of a professor who is translating an ancient text, the woman is killed and comes back as something else, and it's up to the guy to survive, when everything, even his own hand wants to kill him.",1503446400,,475,4.197802197802198

3455627,5,B001AOHPXA,"I bought the VHS version of this movie because I already had the first Evil Dead movie, as well as, Army of Darkness on VHS and wanted to match. I received it on time and it worked fantastically. The only thing off about it was a crack on the plastic screen over the tape, however I was more worried whether or not it would play without issues so it didn't really bother me that much.",1496448000,,384,4.133333333333334
3455628,4,B001AOHPXA,"An exceedingly maniacal re-invention of the narrative, Evil Dead 2 is just plain batshit crazy and one helluva good time. The five star rating is interchangeable between the original and the sequel depending on your stylistic preferences. The first is a horror masterpiece, the second is a horror comedy gem. Take your pick. - Highly Recommended

3455669,4,B001AOHPXA,"Researched this for a while and couldn't find too many details on this product so I bought it to check it out. To start with this is the exact same disc as far as I can tell, as the Lionsgate (25th anniversary) release, it even has the same artwork on said disc. The runtime listed is completely wrong, this is the same cut of the movie as the Lionsgate version with a run time of 84 minutes. If you already own the other version you can skip this one, its just a box art swap and an included digital copy (ultra violet).

Normally I like to know what special features I'm getting so I'll list those below (mostly taken straight off the box):
- Audio Commentary with Sam Raimi, Bruce Campbell, Scott, Spiegel, Greg Nicotero
- ""Dead by Dawn"" - the film makers reflect on the long journey this sequel took to reach the screen.
- ""The Chosen Ones"" - interviews with Bruce Campbell, Sarah Berry, Danny Hicks, Ted Raimi, Kassie Wesley, and Richard Domeier
- ""Madman Sam"" - cast and crew react to working with Sam Raimi
- ""Dead Effects"" - a look at the special effects with Mark Shostrom, Greg Nicotero, Howard Berger, Robert Kurtzman, Shannon Shea
- ""Re-Animated"" - animators Doug Beswick, Tom Sullivan, Rick Cazitone detail the stop motion work
- ""Method to Madness"" - a close look at the cinematography and production design along with cast memories on set
- ""Rosebud"" - a detailed examination of the films editing, original release, and eventual cult-class status
- ""Road to Wadesboro"" - an all-new journey back to the original shooting location with property master and filmmaker Tony Elwood
- ""Cabin Fever"" - a series of production videos taken on set of the film by Greg Nicotero
- Featurettes, Still Galleries, Trailers",1480464000,,1721,4.661184210526316

Still not knowing what to expect I was left wondering how ED1 ties into army of darkness. My question was answered when I watched ED2.

ED2 is basically a remake. Well, it is... but funnily a lot is reused from the original. The cabin, the necklace, the book, ash himself. Just redone but with a grander and sillier story to tell.

I now know that ED1 is a standalone movie. ED2 is a rehash for ash only that is the true prequel to army of darkness. I saw all the humor and all I love in AoD. It was fun to see how Ash ends up back in time.",1475452800,,702,3.7687074829931975

3455739,5,B001AOHPXA,"Sam Raimi's ""The Evil Dead"" became a massive cult hit almost immediately -- but not entirely for the reasons he had hoped. Yes, some parts of it are scary, but it's also hilariously over-the-top.

So when it was time to give the world ""Evil Dead 2: Dead By Dawn,"" Raimi decided to embrace the joke. Sure, it still has some horrific moments (possessed lady in the basement! Ash stuck down there with her!), but the movie is now being deliberately over-the-top for the sheer joy of it -- fountains of gore, quotable lines, chainsaw hands and laughing deer heads. And of course, Bruce Campbell has completely graduated into his memelike status here, as a demon-slaying mass of manly awesomeness.

It begins with a heavily abridged retelling of the first movie, where Ash (Campbell) and his girlfriend Linda (Denise Bixler) take a romantic vacation in a rickety old cabin, but stumble across a weird old tape recorder and the Necronomicon Ex-Mortis (aka, Book of the Dead). An evil force possesses Linda, and Ash is forced to behead her with a shovel. Got it? Onto the story!

After being possessed for a grand total of six seconds, Ash finds himself trapped in the haunted cabin, with no way of getting back to civilization. He's slowly driven insane by demonic hallucinations, and the undead Linda reassembles her very-rapidly-decayed body so she can attack Ash once more. This time, she bites his hand and possesses it, forcing Ash to take very extreme measures to protect himself. Think a chainsaw. Used for amputation.

Meanwhile, ANOTHER quartet of disposable individuals are approaching the cabin, led by Annie (Sarah Berry), whose father left behind the tapes on the Necronomicon. Not only did he leave the Necronomicon and the tapes in the cabin, but his possessed wife Henrietta (Lou Hancock and Ted Raimi) is buried in the basement -- and she wants out. More horrible killings, possessions and demonic evil ensue.

Despite having a few million dollars more, ""Evil Dead 2"" retains the same low-budget charm as the original. The story takes place in the same weird little cabin, there's a cast of about five or six people, and demonic possession is represented by some charming stop-motion and clever makeup. Sam Raimi has definitely polished his special effects with all that extra money (Ash talking to himself in the mirror), and has added a few for comedic effect (the laughing deer head, geysers of blood!), but hasn't lost the rough edges that made the first so delightful.

He's also dialed his directing up a few notches. It's still a horror movie with a sense of creeping dread, especially as we discover more about the Necronomicon and the undead horrors that come from it (""We are the things that were and shall be again!"")

But Raimi fully embraces the over-the-top (""I'll swallow your soul! I'LL SWALLOW YOUR SOUL!"" ""Swallow this!"") and in-jokes (Ash pins down his hand... with ""A Farewell to Arms""), with plenty of delightfully quotable lines (... groovy""). There's also a lot more weaponry in it, since Ash swaggers through the film with a sawed-off shotgun (which he fires into demon faces) and a chainsaw that he ends up attaching to his arm. It is almost as awesome as it sounds.

This is also the movie where Bruce Campbell blossoms into the one-liner-slinging, larger-than-life, gun-and-chainsaw-swinging cult icon he is today -- he plays Ash as the kind of cool yet frenetic guy that every guy would like to imagine he would be in a supernatural crisis, and he is utterly delightful. The other actors do serviceable jobs as characters you don't know very well, but Bruce simply expands to fit the movie with no room for anyone else to steal (or chew) the scenery with such aplomb and charm.

""Evil Dead 2: Dead By Dawn"" is one of those rare sequels that has more money and polished special effects, but doesn't lose what made the first movie so much fun. Instead, it takes everything that was fun... and amps it up.",1459036800,,3941,4.835311572700297

My favorite scene is when Annie's Dad comes back from the Grave to warn the survivors how to save themselves. The camera work, scene tension and dialogue create an eerieness that I always puts me on the edge of my seat.

The movie itself is sort of a remake of the first Evil Dead, and sort of a sequal. This is probably my favorite movie in the whole trilogy.

To those who've never seen any of them, Evil Dead 2 is about a man who goes to a cabin in the woods and accidentally lets loose some evil spirits that possess people and try to kill everyone.

3455816,5,B001AOHPXA,"That's right... who's laughing now?

Evil Dead II is one of the best horror comedy movies ever made.
This one really stands in a category of its own.
Evil Dead II is a cult/horror/action/splatter/comedy classic.

In brief, a group of friends go out to the woods & stay in a remote cabin for a weekend.
The entire situation is creepy from the start.
Something is not right & you find out rather quickly what that is.

From the moment the group arrived, they experience something connected to another world.
This experience is based on pure evil.

The group of friends soon discover some prior cabin visitors experimented with opening up portals to other worlds.
The key to this experiment is something called the book of dead.
Once the evil is unleashed, there is no stopping it.

Evil Dead II is full of memorable scenes and quotes.
Some of them funny & some of them horrific.

Evil Dead II was preceded by Evil Dead I, which is also very memorable, & followed by Army of Darkness.
The lead role in these films is portrayed by Bruce Campbell. It was directed by Sam Raimi.
Evil Dead II is still held in high regard by horror fans today.",1435968000,,1136,4.517073170731707

3455819,3,B001AOHPXA,"Many years ago when my brother and I were adolescents, a cousin of ours showed Evil Dead II and Army of Darkness to us. Now that Im of a more appropriate age, I streamed Evil Dead II. Bruce Campbells trademark Ash Williams character travels to a cabin in the woods with his girlfriend. There they find an ancient spellbook and a professors recording. They unwittingly summon demonic spirits. Ash must somehow survive the havoc that springs up around him.

The most striking visual element, aside from the copious blood and gore, is the creative, stylish, and dramatic cinematography. There is intense horror-style action and mood mixed with slapstick humor. The effects are excellent for what had to be a fairly small budget. Campbell became justifiably well-known for his performance. This is a decent time-waster if you can handle the blood and gore, much of which is comically exaggerated.",1434240000,,892,5.027027027027027

It also has plenty Stooge-esque slapstick and a bunch of wacky daemons (deadites) running around. It almost seems like director Sam Raimi is shoving every enemy/obstacle/situation at the main character Ash.

I can't tell if that makes this a remake or a true sequel.  In any regard, they're back in the cabin and instantly joined by four other characters.  More humor is applied this time, they stick to the formula that worked so well for them (and still does in varying degrees).  Possession runs rampant, a portal is opened, evil is confronted, ""who's laughing now!""  The main selling feature of this film remains Bruce Campbell's energetic performance..........that, and the taunting deer head mounted on the wall.

3456030,4,B001AOHPXA,"The best-looking version of The Evil Dead 2 I have ever seen.  My one complaint about the physical product itself has to do with the case.  There must have been some sort of incident during production or shipment involving a number of copies (or I could just be unlucky...), as both of the copies of this film I've purchased have had significant flaws.  The first one was not purchased from Amazon (Best Buy) and had much of the side of the case rubbed off.  The second copy (which I just decided to keep) had these pin-sized holes on the side of the case.  Don't let my review keep you from picking up a copy of this masterpiece.  If you do happen to receive a copy that is too damaged for you to tolerate, send it back for a replacement.  I've done a few returns with Amazon over the past few year, and I've also been pleased their handling of the entire process.",1386288000,,865,4.302469135802469
3456031,5,B001AOHPXA,"Impeccable video quality, ~32 Mbit/s H.264 video. As a film, it really feels like they took the original people in a cabin with evil spirits bit, and decided, ""OK, this is going to well for Ash...how can we make it worse?"". They dispel with the lopsided cutting between characters and just focus on the point. Skip the pretense of serious (and the ridiculous cutting between serious and nutty that the first film had) and go straight for camp and laughs.

In particular, I was impressed with Bruce Campbell's ""Rocking chair"" scene where he freaks out. And I can't help but wonder if the blood colour changes because they ran out of red corn syrup.",1386115200,,647,4.675438596491228

3456034,5,B001AOHPXA,"This is a must have for any fan of Horror in general. A lot of people think this is a remake of the first Evil Dead and they're right to a certain extent but not entirely. If you watch the commentary or do your research you'll learn that they had problems with getting footage from the original film so basically the first 10 or so minutes of Evil Dead 2 are a sort of recap of the original Evil Dead where they trim things down to just Ash and Linda.
*SPOILERS* The end of The Evil Dead features the unseen Demonic force sneaking up on Ash and knocking him through the woods. So in Evil Dead 2 when the invisible force knocks Ash through the woods and he wakes up in the mud puddle possessed only to have the demon forced out by the sun that is actually where Evil Dead 1 ends and Evil Dead 2 TRULY begins *END SPOILERS*
This film is a horror classic and the Blu-Ray is full of great features and the film itself has never looked or sounded better.

Of course that's not to say I didn't like it, it was one of my favorite movies but that doesn't mean it didn't haunt me late at night trying to go to bed. Then of course the BS stories me and my friends making up telling each other about the book of the dead and demons didn't help getting to sleep either.

Once I have the time to sit down and review this bluray release I will update this review. As of right now my three stars is really just to show that I like the movie. Depending on this cut and master of it... it could go down or up.

Edit: I should have come back a long time ago to raise this up. This was a great cut and it was well mastered. The movie is badass as always. I was reminded of this because of the new series on Starz ""Ash vs Evil Dead"".",1382918400,,745,3.901315789473684

Raimi, has put all the aspects of the film together in masterful fashion. The camera work and sound effects are pulsating, and the timing is perfection. And in Bruce Campbell, the film as a lead actor who gives an exceptional performance. Campbell plays ""Ash"", an everyday, supermarket attendant who suddenly finds himself thrown into the unusual situation of having to defend himself against, Demons, evil spirits and even his own possessed hand, just in order to survive the night. I laughed, I gasped, and I gripped the arm of my chair throughout! If you like your comedies, black and hilarious, and your horror, gory and sensational, then look no further. Raimi has created the definitive comedy horror! And its Fantastic!

This was my favorite in the series for years, but over time I have shifted to Army of Darkness as my top choice. Either way, you can't go wrong with Bruce Campbell. He enhances every project he is party to, whether Ash or Bubba Ho-Tep, or as a caricature of himself. Even Oz the Great and Powerful was better because of him, orange and unrecognizable as he was.",1372982400,,489,4.212765957446808

Most of the negative reviews I see are because people don't understand it is a horror comedy made in the 80's with B movie acting, lots of gore and many chessy special effects. It wasn't meant to be a Oscar nominated film. It was meant to be just a very fun entertaining film. If you understand that and enjoy this type of film, you will have no problem with this film.

The movie looks like it was produced in the late '70's or early 80's and the special effects look as though the technology to produce them went even further back.
The only scary thing about this movie is that it's still around!

I'm guessing the writer noticed this because Evil Dead 2 is a comedy, and a pretty good one at that. Very dark wtf humor with one of the strangest endings I've ever seen in a movie. If you watch the first one and wanted another horror movie you'll be disappointed but if you want a wtf, dark comedy check this one out!

Besides those things, the book is a cool thing to have and the movie looks great. I mean the movie itself. The dvd menu looks a bit suspicious. Like bootleg....

3456220,4,B001AOHPXA,"I saw this warped little gem at a bar in Yonkers, NY back in the early 1990's. I can tell you 3 things that happened during its run that night:

1) Not a single person left until it was over
2) Every person there was scared sober by the time it was over
3) Every person there needed a drink after it was over

The movie has a deceptively simple setup: a group of young adults decides to crash a 'cabin-in-the-woods' one of them knows about. They believe the owners almost never come there, making it perfect for a weekend of uninterrupted debauchery.
However, they find a book, and tape recorder in the abandoned cabin...
The book is the notorious and legendary 'Necromicon', the invention and lynchpin of H.P. Lovecraft's mad cosmos of horror. The tape recording is of the owner...a scientist who was studying the book, with lethal results.

It seems that the hapless scientist read a portion of the book, which allowed evil spirits to invade cadavers...who came by to make a midnight snack of the good doc. Our young protagonists stupidly play the doc's recording of him reading the passage...and, the spirit/zombies come for them.

While this may sound like the 'same-old, same-old', it rises above it all because of two unique talents:

1) Director Sam Raimi, whose love of horror, breathtakingly kinetic camera work and penchant for black humor mine consistent laughs out of the most dire of situations

2) The great character-actor Bruce Campbell, whose comic-book-hero visage/physique make him believable as the guy who can fight off these evil spirits (even with a chain saw grafted onto the stump of his wrist; and, whose natural goofiness make him the perfect vessel to channel Raimi's insane black humor (""...shop smart...shop S-Mart!"").

Bottom line: often imitated, never equaled...this movie is frightening, gory (to the point of deliberate excess) imaginative, blackly funny and flat-out unforgettable. If you consider yourself any kind of a horror-movie fan, 'Evil Dead 2' has to be on your 'must-watch' list. Boo!",1363737600,,2030,4.988165680473373

3456230,3,B001AOHPXA,"I don't own the DVD of this movie but I've had Evil Dead 2 on VHS since the early 90's,I think I bought it at a Reel Collections or Suncoast(one of those overpriced movie stores)you typically see in the mall. There's alot of gore and interesting paranormal events that occur,the demons are well created,good effects,humor varies from actually funny and drops to the level of a three stooge's episode. Bruce Campbell's just playing his role but his character rubs off as a real douchebag which is present in Army of Darkness as well. Campbell's character (Ash) is supposed to be tacky hero type but he's just real annoying,you'd expect him to call his arms 'his guns' and talk to his pecs everytime he kills a demon...it's emberassing that there's some guys that have this kind of personality. Is Evil Dead 2 worth watching?once in a while I like to see as what I call an somewhat alternative version of the first Evil Dead. I'm not so much a fan of spoilers but in this case if you've seen the first one,you'll notice the rehashed stuff if I point it out to you...

*In the first Evil Dead it ends abruptly by the dark spirit getting Ash,yet he's returning to the same cabin as though he's never been there...why?

*He's wearing the same get-up as the first one,blue shirt and khaki pants

*His girlfriend's name is Linda,I believe his girlfriend in the first one was named Linda.

*He gives her the same necklace as his girlfriend in the first movie

*Just like in the first one his girlfriend gets possessed,beheaded,buried in the yard,and comes after him.

*There's a burial site in the yard and that could be Linda from the first movie or Professor Knoby's grave,but Sam Raimi never created a part of the story to tell of the Professor or if he met his demise...the grave's just there. Being that Ash is brought into the movie as never visited this cabin before what was the point of adding that?

*The bridge gets torn to pieces in the first one,so does the sequel

*Ash gets possessed in Evil Dead 2 in a similar vein to the first one yet it turns on and off. Instead the demons play mind games with kill him,make his hand come to life and attack him,and even try to kill him. Demons don't kill each other in this movie since they work together and Ash's possession does nothing in the movie...what was the point?Sam Raimi realized he screwed up the ending of the first Evil Dead and just threw this posession in as some off key incident,yeah sure no one remember's how the first one ended.

*What makes this a sequel is the necronomicon was burned in the first Evil Dead but the dark spirit still resides in the woods,yet Professor Knoby's daughter found the 'missing pages' from the book.

Sam Raimi got pretty creative with the gore and it's a decent horror movie if you can dismiss the idea of remembering the first Evil Dead but the cold reality of it is Sam Raimi was just too lazy to create an actual storyline. 3-stars.",1362614400,,2933,4.527410207939509

Bruce's acting, Sam's directing and story, and you have something to be proud of.  This middle child of the Evil Dead Trilogy deserves much more than just being seen as a simple horror movie.

Sam Raimi wrote (along with Scott Spiegel) and direceted this flick. There are so many memorable lines and scenes in this film, it's foolish to list them all.

3456278,5,B001AOHPXA,"Evil Dead 2 is a direct sequel to The Evil Dead and continues the story of Ash as he battles the evil that was unleashed; he is joined by a new group, which includes the professor's daughter, her research partner, and Jake and Bobby. The story is fairly simple but engaging and fun to watch.

Bruce Campbell does a great job reprising his role as the groovy Ash. The rest of the acting was also great, at least for a film from the 80s. The special effects were amazing, especially if you're a fan of the old-school gore and make-up effects; it has plenty of gore and possessions to show off these great effects. I've always enjoyed the laughing/giggling sequences in these films, they're both weird and eerie. Evil Dead 2 has some very funny and some horrific moments, this blend makes the film even more memorable; you'll never forget the moment Ash attaches his chainsaw to his arm and creates a sawed off shotgun. The ending was great and sets up the film perfectly for the follow-up.

Overall, I highly recommend Evil Dead 2 for purchase or rental; it's fun and an effective time-killer. As of 10/27/12, this film is available on Amazon Prime Instant Video, if you'd like to watch before purchasing.

Evil Dead 2 has very extreme violence and gore, no sex or nudity.",1351296000,,1270,4.58590308370044

3456282,5,B001AOHPXA,"This movie is basically an unneeded redo of the first, WAIT.... now before you hit that un-helpful button I will say that this is my favorite demon-related sequel next to Night of the Demons 2 and Hellbound: Hellraiser II. The reason I said that it is unneeded is because that's what my first opinion was. But then about 5 minutes I changed that opinion drastically. Evil Dead 2: Dead by Dawn is by far the gooiest, slimmest, and grimiest sequel in the Evil Dead Trilogy (Or which I like to call a Thrillogy). I love Army of Darkness as well but I do wish that the story stayed at the cabin and not in a medieval time but I guess the windmill scene can accompany for that.

Plot: It is sort of an expansion of the first movie. It begins where the first one started and made midpoint and then ended all within five minutes but then they take the whole first story and twist it to make it totally original. The demons have ADHD or something because they are even more abundantly torturous and crafty than in the first one.

Review: This film obviously had a bigger budget than the first and it uses it to the extent. I felt like when they were walking outside and the trees started movie with a totally amazing atmosphere that I was on a James Cameron 80's Movie Set! There was gore but during the late 80's The MPAA was a bitch to deal with and they made Rami take all the scenes with red colored blood and substitute it for green goo. But even with all the green goo and dismemberment I still don't believe it was that gory. I have come to the conclusion that more people knew about this one and when they saw part one they decided to merged the two and created a bloody, wild fantasy which would be awesome as hell. It is hard to make movies like this anymore.... Combining strong slapstick humor and still maintain the scare factor is not that easy, not to mention all the difficult camera shots (which from what I heard were not as back breaking as the firsts camera maneuvering) The Special Effects were great as well, plenty of ghoulish and frightening demons  with hiddious monster make-up to serve up the soul-craving fans!

Acting: Bruce Frigging Campbell, He is the god of one liners and even though he doesn't get sprayed with as much gore as the first he still puts up on hell of a battle which ultimately makes him ultra bad-ass! The rest of the actors where colorful as well and they preformed the roles belt-tight!

Gore: A head chopped in half with axe, green goo, a couple of scenes involving explosions of bloody gushing and spraying, a decapitation with a shovel (Wink to the Original), a hand cut off with a chainsaw (Infamous scene there!) there is even a little blue blood to go around! This cabin is ""Where the Slime Live"" (Morbid Angel Reference)

Bottom Line: One of the best movies and sequels of its kind, It literally (just like the first) took something so unoriginal made it completely legit! I give a standing ovation to this movie and may it forever belong with Horror fans!

Suggested MPAA: Rated R for horror violence, disturbing images, and some language

They did a remarkable job here and while there are scenes here and there that appear soft the majority are clean, crisp and chock full of detail, colors are vibrant and they stand out, indeed I saw colors on things that I couldn't distinguish before on other releases. I've read other reviews that state the blacks are crushed but I didn't notice that, detail was quite visible in darker scenes and grain structure was consistent throughout the film.

Extras are plentiful including a feature-length retrospective on the making of the film featuring all new interviews with all of the principle actors as well as Sam Raimi himself and all of the extras featured on other DVD releases have been ported over too including the hilarious commentary track.

The audio is stellar! This disc features a new DTS HD Master Audio track that fills your room with screams and other assorted horrible sounds when things in the film really start to get crazy.

Sole survivor Ash returns to the abandoned cabin with his girlfriend Linda. Once again he unknowingly plays the tape containing demon resurrection passages from the Necronomicon or 'Book of the Dead'. With chainsaw and boomstick in hand can Ash stop the demonic force that dwells in the woods?

Is it any good?

Looks like a remake but actually is a sequel to 'The Evil Dead'. Raimi gives us even more deviating camera feats; kind of like being stuck in a tumble dryer on full speed, and the results are spectacular. 'Evil Dead 2' has the ability to scare the hell out of you one minute and then laugh your arse off the next, this mix of action, horror and slapstick comedy is the perfect blend. Bruce Campbell gives a great comedic performance, contorting his face with hilarious results as we witness the rise of Ash the cult hero. There is also plenty of gross-out gore and buckets of blood to keep the gore hounds extremely entertained.

Best bit?

PROs:
Secured cult classic status [this film you should see before you die]
Sam Raimi broke new ground with this film in style & substance
Bruce Campbell is an awesome B movie actor [His character Ash has been copied by other movies & video games alike--Duke Nukem comes to mind]
Filled with countless one-liners [""You're going down!"" & ""Groovie!""]
All zombie/horror films where the hero uses a chainsaw owes a debt to this movie
Evil laughing demonically possessed deer's head
The Necronomicon Ex-Mortis is the coolest horror prop of all time
Possessed hand that flips Ash the bird
The remixed sound is outstanding
The special features are great, especially the making of Evil Dead 2 [It's Ted Raimi in the possessed old lady makeup]

CONs:
The stop-motion animation & minitures don't hold up well to HD viewing [It was decent for 1987]

NOTE:  Sam Raimi's director calling card is to have the 1973 Oldsmobile that Ash drives in all of his films.  Much like Stanley Kubrick always had a bathroom scene in his films, Raimi includes this car.  It's in Spiderman driven by Uncle Ben when he is killed.  The next film ""Army of Darkness"" is also pretty good, but not groundbreaking like this one.  I am not really a fan of the original Evil Dead.  I've read that this edition is better than the original blu-ray release, but I have not seen that one to compare.  Overall, you must see this film!",1330992000,,1557,4.601449275362318
3456294,5,B001AOHPXA,"If Evil Dead 2 is a sequel to the original Evil Dead, it is essentially a sequel to the original concept of the series, that is a story where demons, released from the pages of a book called the Necronomicon, haunt and torture college students who are staying inside a cabin down in the woods.

For this version, everything that happened in the first movie has been retconned and modified. Of the college students staying at the cabin, only Ash and Linda are left to find the Necronomicon. Instead of seeing their woes for eighty minutes like in the first movie, everything is condensed in the first seven minutes as we then see what happens to Ash as he becomes the victim of the Necronomicon curse. Meanwhile, five other characters (Annie, Bobby Joe, Professor Ed Getley, Jake, and the dead Henrietta, played by the excellent Ted Raimi) come into the story and add a lot of baggage to the Necronomicon's true origins, including a shocking twist at the end.

The special effects, both stop motion and gory juices, are more sophisticated than in the first movie and used to quite a comedic effect, especially with the hand of a certain character and his psychotic illusions. The camerawork is also perfect as it is once again used to film Ash's troubles, but also plays the role of the Necronomicon spirits as they hunt the characters around the house and the woods, a visual strategy that adds more tension to the story than any special effect done in post-production.

The soundtrack by Joseph LoDuca is still as efficient as the first one, but is more classical than in the first movie, which was more experimental. Done with a larger orchestra, the score doesn't suffocate the movie and the characters' actions and is both comical and dramatic, adding the perfect atmosphere to the story.

As for the script, this one was richer than the first movie and only kept the best elements of the first version of the Evil Dead story. Unlike the first movie, Evil Dead 2's story rhythm was faster and I didn't feel that some characters were useless to the movie. In fact, there were times I felt that certain traits of Scotty, Cheryl and Shelly were present in Ash, Linda and Annie. In terms of narration, classical devices are used as a narrator informs us of the origin of the book, flashbacks show us how Annie's family discovered the Necronomicon in Sumerian ruins. Finally, instead of doing a gore horror movie like in the first Evil Dead, Sam Raimi mixes more comedy in the story, which gives quite many funny scenes even though the situations are just horrible for all the characters, especially Ash's misadventures which take a final conclusion in Army of Darkness.",1330387200,,2669,4.733333333333333

Anyway, the film is a masterpiece of it's genre, as well as being a remake of the initial film 'Evil Dead.' The film shines in both it's subtle scares and dark twists into comedic gold (i.e. Ash's hand). Forever remembered and revered, the film is a classic and will remain so. It was good to see Mr. Raimi return to the Horror genre with 2009's 'Drag Me To Hell,' which in my estimation, is going to be the closest thing the fans will get to a full fledged Evil Dead IV.

Now onto the blu ray: I've owned the DVD since it came out and wondered exactly how much better the blu ray could possibly be. Well. Let me tell you, this is a top-notch blu ray. The colors are bright and beautiful, the blacks are splendidly inky, the picture is crisp and clear. And no, it does not make the effects look terrible, in fact, it makes them look even better.

The bonus features on the disc are also great. The commentary from the initial release (to laser disc) has been ported over and is one of the most enjoyable commentaries you're apt to find. But new to the disc are a few documentaries and featurettes in crisp HD. Also ported over are some of the original documentaries.

But if you were going to ask, should I buy this for ten or eleven bucks? The answer is MOST DEFINITELY. I'd say buy it if it was 2 million dollars, but I'm glad that's not the case. Highly, highly recommended. For a more comprehensive review, if you wish, check out bluray.com's review here: [...]",1323907200,,1715,4.383647798742138

3456301,4,B001AOHPXA,"EVIL DEAD 2 has been the junk food of choice for movie geeks who have dutifully eaten all of their nutritious helpings of Bergman and Ozu.  As such, we've seen I don't know HOW many editions on VHS and DVD, but the Blu-ray puts them all to shame.

I was impressed with THE EVIL DEAD Blu-ray, which restored colors and details lost on previous editions, but I am SERIOUSLY impressed with the transfer for ED2.  I never, NEVER thought the original negative HAD this much detail in the frame as you'll find; given the budget it had, I figured it would have a softer look in it's native form, but there are details and line sharpness that I haven't seen in a film of this type of age since THE SHINING Blu-Ray.  And when I say sharp, I MEAN SHARP.  I had a hard time believing that I was watching a film from 25 years ago because--aesthetics aside--it hasn't aged a DAY.  Sure, there's flaws in the optical effects that haven't been AS visible before, but aside from an occasional film nick, it's practically cherry.

The special features are plentiful, some recycled, some new, but the new making-of documentary really goes for the ""Dangerous Days""-level of gratification and coverage for fans.  No deleted scenes, but there's lots of remarkably well-preserved BTS video footage included.

Nevertheless, the disc loses a star for two small reasons.

One: the film isn't as bright as previous editions.  While the image clarity is beyond superb, the brightness has been dialed down a bit--possibly intentionally--for the purposes of mood.  I've compared footage from the Blu-ray to the DVD and there are times (most notably the laughing room sequence) where the DVD is brighter and shows some more shadow detail than the Blu-ray.  This looks to me as an intentional color-correction for the purposes of atmosphere.  It's merely irksome, but not problematic or endemic, and the detail REALLY compensates for it.

Two: more than ever, the grain is very apparent in the image.  Low-lit scenes with film grain are nicely textured, if OCCASIONALLY a bit thick.  Thankfully, it's not too distracting.  What can be a bit distracting is that the film grain isn't as noticeable as the GROUND GLASS GRAIN from the lenses.  You'll see this mostly in the title and final sequence, but it tends to exist intermittently throughout the film.  Instead of seeing the grain from the film, you'll see the actual texture from the glass in the lenses on the camera, which can give it a slight matte feel that bothered me a little more than it should.

Mostly though, the film image is extremely crisp.  As a fan, the ED2 Blu-ray did not disappoint me and for $11 (I paid $9.99 on sale) they're practically GIVING it away.

So grab it up!",1323129600,,2712,4.735607675906183
3456302,4,B001AOHPXA,"First off,if you're getting this,you've already seen the movies or someone told you to watch them.
If you haven't and just want some funny looking DVD case,you won't regret it. Evil Dead is to Horror movies as Bach is to Classical Music. Its something you have to feast on at least once to know if you like it or not. Dont listen to personal views or busted revies on websites...

Its campy,sure. Its not really scary anymore by our standards BUT God-damn is it good ;D The ""Chin"" Bruce Campbell stars as a simple guy,stuck in a forest cabin surrounded by evil (and low on gas,but thats much later) with his only key to life is a chainsaw,an ol' dual-barrel and a book made of human flesh. So yeah,with a description like that,you know what you're in for.

Now,onto the important part. The DVD has plenty features on its disks,including extra footage not available on other versions of the movie (like the one with the Skull Poster cover,all-black case).The internal ""booklet"" is faithfully remade like the intro sequence with old,tainted pages and most of the visible pages of the Necronomicon reproduced inside it. The mouth on the soft,cotton-lined cover (YES,the whole case is squishy) has a hidden button in its mouth that -probably- speaks and curses at you...

The reason im using -probably- is because sadly,the copy i got had MELTED batteries in it and i had to find out the hard way that it was the case by having to pretty much rip it open from the inside cover to get to the electrical parts. Its nothing irreplaceable,but its a small detail that hurts a little :(",1323129600,,1576,4.661870503597123

3456304,4,B001AOHPXA,"Directed by Sam Raimi, written by Sam Spiegel, and starring loveable ham Bruce Campbell, ""Evil Dead 2"" (also known as ""Evil Dead 2 - Dead By Dawn"") continues Ash Williams' (Campbell) unfortunate saga in a remote cabin in the woods, where a group of evil spirits possess the living, turning them into screeching, gooey, and hilarious monsters, after being summoned by readings from The Book Of The Dead.

If you have seen ""The Evil Dead"" (1981) then be prepared for even crazier shenanigans as Ash fights for his life, even to the point of cutting off his own arm ""It got into my hand and it went bad"" then attaching a chainsaw to the stump. Filled with terrific one-liners, and Raimi's trademark directing style utilized to perfect effect, ""Evil Dead 2"" raises the level of camp at least one big notch up from the first film.  ""The Evil Dead"" was scary and campy, ""Evil Dead 2"" is pure horror satire.

""GROOVY!"" is this particular film's standout catchphrase, and is another one forever linked with Campbell - his collaborations with Sam Raimi have resulted in such classic camp films as the first in the trilogy ""The Evil Dead"", then ""Evil Dead 2"",""Army Of Darkness"" (1992), and have also spawned several video games based on the films, with Campbell lending his voice.",1321660800,,1270,4.763636363636364
3456305,5,B001AOHPXA,"If you've never owned ""Evil Dead II"" before, or if you've owned it a million times already across VHS, Betamax, LaserDisc, VCD, DVD, and Blu-ray, the new 25th Anniversary Edition by Lionsgate is THE version to have.

Lionsgate apparently returned to the original camera negative for this new transfer, and it shows. Detail is far above and beyond every previous home video release, including the dreaded waxed-over Blu-ray from Anchor Bay. A strong grain structure is present, although some mild DVNR tampering is visible--the grain generally moves as grain ought to, although sometimes it becomes more static, but never at a standstill. Color grading is a lot more dynamic and pleasing with realistic flesh tones and beautiful lighting I swear I've never quite seen before, while the contrast is more stable with night scenes looking appropriately dark, while daytime and near-dusk scenes look more appropriate and fitting than ever before. Black levels are solid, although there have been concerns of black crush being involved--that is, when shadow detail is lost, the shading variances gone and blacks being ""crushed"" instead. This doesn't appear to be any defect of the mastering, however; the film has always been dark, and it's my belief that the stark, detail-free blacks are due to underexposure during filming. The '98 VHS tape, THX- and DiviMax-mastered DVDs, and original Blu-ray (all from Anchor Bay) that I own all feature the same ""problem"" (*); I believe it was an artistic decision and one that I find to be visually striking. To top it all off, the original age restriction warning before the Rosebud logo returns, which had been excised from Anchor Bay's Blu-ray.

*(This is not to say that old home video releases are correct and that they should be used as a guideline for how the film should look; old video masters should never be the standard of quality in any respect since they are often very inaccurate to the original film source. I'm simply saying that I doubt very much that ALL of these previous video masters would be so goofed up as to feature the exact same levels of black crush as featured on the Lionsgate Blu-ray, so it is almost definitely part of the original photography. The DiviMax/Book of the Dead DVD and Anchor Bay Blu-ray, by the way, are transferred from the same master.)

Full-res screenshots of the title can be viewed at caps-a-holic, which also compares this release to the Anchor Bay one.

Some may be upset to hear that the wires used to hold up the flying eyeball have been digitally removed. This doesn't bother me since they were never meant to be seen in the first place, but there is a quaintness that is now missing with their removal; far as I can tell, the rest of the wires remain intact, which is odd that they'd only fix the one. If only they'd gone all-out and fixed all the wires, the huge tear in Ted Raimi/Possessed Henrietta's rear, and fixed the shots where unfinished sets are seen. Hey, if you're going to fix one thing, why not fix it all  la ""Blade Runner: The Final Cut""? It should be all or nothing; fix it all or leave it well enough alone.

The only audio provided is a DTS-HD 5.1 track with English, English SDH, and Spanish subtitles optional. An uncompressed original mono track would have been appreciated (coded as 2.0 dual mono); I've never been too wild over surround re-mixes, especially since only the original mix represents the intentions of the filmmakers. But, the 5.1 mix does the job well enough.

Extras include an all-new 100-minute documentary titled ""Swallowed Souls: The Making of Evil Dead II"", split up into several chapters and featuring endearing new stop-motion effects recreating scenes from the film (a whole full-length recreation of the film in this fashion would be a load of fun to see). The doc is fun and informative with a lot of new trivia that I'd never heard before, such as the existence of co-writer Scott Spiegel's short film ""Attack of the Helping Hand"" and its influence on the ""Evil Dead II"" script. A 30-minute behind-the-scenes production video is also provided, showing off among other things scenes which were deleted during the editing process which all have plenty of fascinating effects, and it's unfortunate that these scenes were not found and restored for this Blu-ray release as separate deleted scenes. A 7-minute return to the shooting locations is also new, and the standard definition ""The Gore the Merrier"" and Tom Sullivan photo commentary featurettes from the Anchor Bay DVDs are provided as well. The movie commentary is the same entertaining one which has been around since I believe one of the LaserDisc releases. The US trailer is thankfully presented in HD, and there are HD photo galleries as well.

""Evil Dead II"", the fantastic sequel to the low-budget, DIY ""The Evil Dead"" (it's NOT a remake; the first seven minutes merely recap the first movie since rights to the footage could not be acquired), has never looked this pretty and detailed on home video, and is DEFINITELY worth the upgrade. (The THX-mastered DVD from 2000 can finally be retired.) Strangely, the restoration and transfer is not of the same caliber as Bob Murawski and Anchor Bay's work on the first film, so it's unfortunate that Lionsgate did not throw at the project quite the same amount of money and talent as the first film's HD restoration received, but it's an impressive transfer nonetheless, and the film has certainly never looked this good beyond its original theatrical exhibition. HIGHLY recommended for fans of this insane splatter comedy masterpiece and for newcomers as well. Sadly, the disc is Region A-locked. Sorry, overseas fans; hopefully you'll see this transfer released in your area before long.

Now if only ""Army of Darkness"" (both theatrical and director's cuts) would receive a Blu-ray release that doesn't look like sun-baked vomit. At least the NTSC Region 3 DVD put out by MGM exists.",1321315200,,5933,4.90727816550349
3456306,4,B001AOHPXA,"Evil Dead 2(released March/87)stars Bruce Campbell,back as Ash in this not so much a sequel film,as a remake(on a much better budget) of the first Evil Dead.
This film finds our hero Ash back driving down a country road with his ballerina girlfriend Linda. They come upon the self same deserted cottage as in the first film and decide to stay overnight. In the cabin Ash again discovers a tape recorder(same brand too as in the first)and the Necronomicon. This is how we know this is not a sequel because 1)What would he be doing voluntarily back at the cabin again after what happened the first time around and 2)Ash would KNOW what the tape recorder contains and not play it. But Ash does indeed play it,unleashing the terrible force from the Book of the Dead. His girlfriend is possessed and Ash ends up taking her head off in an adjoining shack with a chainsaw. He buries her out front but becomes possessed by the evil himself,which throws him through the woods. This lasts only until daybreak when he jumps in the car and tears away from the cabin. However,like the first film,the bridge is out and he is going nowhere fast.
Thrown into this scenario is the professor(on the tape's)daughter and research partner. They are heading to the cabin but find the bridge out on the other side. A tow truck driver and his girlfriend show up and they accompany them to the cabin. Meanwhile,back at the ranch,Ash has his hands full as the evil has taken over much of the inanimate objects in the cabin and there is a couple of minute sequence where Ash laughs madly along with all the objects. Also,because the head of his girlfriend bit him on the hand,the evil took over that hand and he became forced to sever it,again with the handy-dandy chainsaw. When the outside group finally shows up Ash blasts a hole through the door,thinking it's the spirits. The group ends up subduing him and throwing him in the cellar,thinking he killed the professor and his wife.
While in the cellar Ash overhears the group talking about the professors wife and how she became possessed and was also thrown into the cellar. Of course in no time the wife indeed shows up,trying to turn Ash into a deadite. Ash makes it out just in time and finally explains the situation. However one by one the group is taken by the evil. First it's the research assistant,then it's the tow truck drivers girlfriend and next is the tow truck driver himself. To dispel the evil the professors daughter reads from the Necronimcon and a giant swirling portal opens up. Ash's car and then Ash himself get sucked into it. Next thing he knows he is plunked down into Medieval times,along with his car. He happens to arrive as a large group of soldiers are trying to kill a flying deadite. Ash takes out(what was to come to be known as)his boomstick,which sends the deadite back to where it came from. The soldiers believe he is the chosen one come back to save them and the film fades out as he screams in despair.
Of course the ending will lead into the third and final installment Army of Darkness. Bruce Campbell is in fine form as Ash and he virtually carries the whole movie. The co stars are mere window dressing,but watch for a cameo by director Sam's little brother Ted as the professors dead wife. This was definitely Evil Dead on a better budget as the film stock is better(35mm this time and widescreen),the S/Fx are better and Jo LoDuca is on hand to score the music;well known for his superb works in Hercules and Xena.
Technically speaking both the full frame and original widescreen version are presented here. Both picture and sound(in THX)have been remastered and the picture never looked better. Extras include audio commentary,still galleries,bios,the trailer and a featurette on the films making. The DVD is a one sided disc.
All in all a recommended film. It's Evil Dead on a better budget and will please all fans of the series. It's not a GREAT film per se',but it is satisfying none the less. It has a few scare the pants off you moments,along with some funny turns by the Campbell-meister.",1320969600,,4070,4.638504155124654

Bruce Campbell takes on the role of Ash once again in this hilariously horrific sequel to a legendary movie Evil Dead. Few sequels live up to the original and fewer still surpass it. This is one of those rare instances. This movie is the perfect mesh of On the edge of your seat horror, and side hurting laughter induced comedy.

Sam Raimi is a second to none with a camera and has gone on to create some of the best films and television shows around.  The script is inventive, highly original, and funny as all hell. It's a mix of horror, laughs, and gore; or 'splatstick' as Campbell calls it.

Once again, Campbell's facial expressions alone are worth the price of admission. If that doesn't get you the laughing deer head will. Evil Dead II: Dead By Dawn is a true horror masterpiece. A completely original concept, some screwy camera angles, and one Bruce Campbell make for an entertaining combination.

Its not a remake, its a continuation on the the first movie. It has a different story, different supporting characters, just in the same cabin.

***SPOILER ALERT****

At the end of 1, you see the ""Evil Dead spirit thing"" coming from the woods, through the cabin, then outside and fast approaching Ash. ED2 picks up (after the brief synopsis of what happened in 1) with the ""thing"" hitting Ash and knocking him to the ground. Thats where the story picks back up and continues from the first movie.

I watched a special feature with Sam Raimi years ago where he explains this continuation and how a lot of people mistake ED2 as being a remake. He credits people making this mistake due to the fact that there was a problem with licensing so he couldn't use scenes from the first movie for the recap in part 2, so he had to re-shoot a cliff's notes version of 1 to catch people up. Thats why the back story is slightly different with different actors. This its also when he changed the name of the book from Morturom Demonto to the Necronomicon Ex-Mortis.

Whether he's shrieking like a little girl at the sight of a poorly-animated headless marionette, cackling deviously as he nails down his own evil right hand or playing it cool as the gritty, badass soldier-man with a chainsaw appendage, Campbell boldly plants his flag right in the center of every scene.

The first was almost pure horror. The third was almost pure comedy. Evil Dead II strikes the perfect balance between the two.

The premise is simple, your standard horror fare. A group of teen take a trip to a dilapidated cabin the woods. They unleash otherworldly demonic forces from the Book of the Dead, and spend the rest of the movie either becoming possessed by them or fighting them off or being killed by them in disgustingly creative ways . The only member of the group that doesn't succumb is Ash, played to the maniacal hilt by the always wonderful Bruce Campbell. He kicks some undead butt and looks good doing it.

ED II is a swirling maelstrom of tension, laughs, jump-out-of-your-seat frights, more laughs, and more gore than you can shake a stick at. There are classic scenes like the zombie in the basement, eye-ball in the mouth and possessed hand than get me every time.

This review is for the 2000 Anchor Bay DVD with the great commentary track. I've seen the Blu-ray transfer and it really isn't a major improvement over the DVD audio and video.

3456329,3,B001AOHPXA,"The blu-ray transfer is average at best. On a 50 inch screen its limitations are very evident. For example, the scene in the car at the beginning is very grainy and soft. This is a recurring problem, as is edge enhancement (e.g., when the demon comes for Ash towards the end). The good news is that once the blood (of many colours) starts to fly, the film becomes much more vibrant (as you would expect) to watch. Thus, reds, blacks, greens are a lot of fun in HD. Special effects are also noticeably underdone on blu-ray. One thing I did particularly enjoy was some aspects of the sound design. It often sounds like it was recorded at the bottom of a well, but one part of the film is great. Having seen the film in the theatre when first released, the zooming sound of the demon chasing Ash in the first part of the film is important for the impact it lends to that scene. In the blu-ray, it is very well done, moving around the listening room, and with a lot of nice bass extension and dynamic range (something the DVD lacks). Evil Dead II is a funhouse ride. You either love Raimi's demented sense of humour or you don't.  I am an Evil Dead fan, so this is good enough for now, especially if you can pick it up at $9.99 (it was that price on Amazon, back in December 2009).

This is the second installment in Sam Raimi's Evil Dead series, and it's one of the few sequels (or ""remake"" if you want to call that) that is equal to the original. It's just as diabolical, with some twisted moments that will no doubt be implanted in the brains of those who watch them. I think the only difference here is that the black humor is more constant than in the original. There is one scene in which Ash (Bruce Campbell) discovers that his hand is possessed by an evil spirit, and from then on, some diabolical hilarity ensues. The entire film is basically a perfect mix of horror, blood, slapstick, gore, and over-the-top edginess. It's actually one of the better horror films in recent decades. Sure, it may not be like The Exorcist, The Shining, or George A. Romero's zombie films, but the entire Evil Dead series stands on its own as a scary & darkly hilarious bloodfest.

I haven't seen the first Evil Dead movie but from what I've read the plot is very similar.  On the audio commentary it is funny to hear Bruce Campbell talk about filming the movie and mention that it was pretty much the exact same cabin from the first movie.  Ash, that durn fool.  Why did he go back?  Seeing Ash put a chainsaw on his severed stump was pretty cool.  Another funny bit was when one of the female characters gets lost in the woods and the dumb fat guy forces the others to look for her shouting ""BOBBY JOE!""  repeatedly.  For a few days after viewing the movie whenever I was looking for something be it keys or wallet I would yell ""BOBBY JOE!""  It is a funny film with over the top energy.

P.S.Ash didn't seem to show much hesitation in decapitating his girlfriend did he?  I mean she's clearly possessed but you would expect a little hand wringing before brutally murdering your lover not 'oh she's evil now...kill.'

This is one of the best, as far as I can tell. The picture quality is crystal clear - and that's saying a lot for a movie of this age (22 years??!!). And it doesn't look a day over 7. Ok, so it's not as razor sharp as the newest ones, but the fact that this one looks so good is a feat unto itself. Bravo, guys, for making this Blu-ray purchase well worth it. And the sound is simply brilliant on a surround sound system. Everything was crystal clear.

Just a completely awesome old-school horror movie (ie. it's got some thought put into it) and a goodly dose of that Sam Raimi biting humor ... ok, it's corny. But it's very funny. Not quite as funny as number 3 (Army of Darkness) but it's got a good half-and-half mix of comedy/horror that is fun to watch from beginning to end. Loved the Ash character (Bruce Campbell was and still is an underrated actor) and loved to quote the lines from the movie.

He even discovers an old dagger and a tape reel that translates the bizarre language of the book as he foolishly unleashes the dead by accident. Evil spirits began to torment him including possessing people around him as he fights evil creatures, zombies and even his own hand that gets possessed.

An ingenious sequel/semi-remake to the 1981 cult masterpiece of terror from writer-director-producer Sam Raimi. It's one of those rare sequels that could actually surpass the original using a dose of dark humor and over-the-top gore more then the original. While some may say this is a remake of the first one then a sequel, i'd say it works well as a semi-sequel and semi-remake combined. It's a true classic of the 80's with the brilliant make-up effects by KNB with amazing camera trickery and memorable quotes that turned this movie into one of the most unique cult movies of all time.

The Lionsgate 25th anniversary blu-ray is fantastic with quality picture with some minor grain at the ending but still a very solid transfer and has excellent extras like audio commentary with hours of featurettes from it's humble beginnings to the cult classic it has became since then, trailer and still galleries.

3456347,5,B001AOHPXA,"This is one of the few horror movies I truly enjoyed, because the film offers a great combination of horror and comedy. It adds up to a very entertaining 85 minutes.

There's a lot to like in this kinda-goofy movie: nice visuals; good humor to counteract the scariness and gore of a horror story and some totally outrageous scenes. They include a woman's head loose and then biting a man's hand with the rest of her body running around with a chainsaw; a hand with a mind of it's own, monster-type grandma and grandpa in the cellar, chase scenes through a forest with trees coming to life and attacking people, on and on....wild, wild stuff.

My main complaint is that there are not enough lulls. There is too much action, and it's so intense it's almost too much to watch in one continuous sitting even with its fairly short length. One needs a break once in a while!

Whatever,  I think most of this is played for laughs more than horror. Bruce Campbell suffers physical damage that would have killed a person many times over but within seconds, he's back to normal. Campbell, by the way, must have set the all-time record for making wild faces in a movie, more than Jim Carrey. However, this movie certainly isn't one to be scrutinized for realism. You have to look at it, with all the gory scenes and shocking violence, as mainly a tongue-in-cheek satire on horror movies. At least that's the way I saw it.

3456349,4,B001AOHPXA,"This is actually one of my top 10 favourite horror movies of all time.
My top 10 horror movies are movies or even movie sequels i have selected which i consider to be better then the original's, evil dead 2 : dead by dawn is one of them. Not only is it better then the original 1981 film, but it uses a bigger budget more technology and special effects.

1987's Evil dead 2: dead by dawn in my opinion is a remake/sequel, remake because it starts off by ash and linda driving up to the cabin. QUESTION ""Where are the college freinds from part 1?"" anyway linda gets killed off a second time and the sequel then starts when ash is thrown in the air by the forces of the forest. Displayed after that is a good continuation of a movie i have ever seen! (TIP: i normally watch evil dead part 1 - then go straight to the scene where ash is thrown around in the air, in evil dead part 2, and there you have an even greater evil dead movie experience, it avoids the confusion the begining of part 2 had when you don't see the college students. I don't want to give to much away with the story, but expect to be entertained in a surreal kind of way. This movie also has a tendency to make you laugh and blood and gore fans won't be dissapointed.

I can't understand why they are making or have already made the remake to evil dead which will be out this year. Remakes tend to give viewer's a diiferent frame of mind towards the series.

3456351,5,B001AOHPXA,"Sort of a sequel but more of a remake or even a satire of the original, Evil Dead 2 benefits from a better budget, a more streamline plot, and the good graces not to take itself seriously in the slightest bit.  Because this is sort of a sequel, there's not a great deal of exposition on the Book of The Dead, and not a great deal of set up for the circumstances.  It assumes you've seen the first movie and don't need to have that part repeated.  We get a smaller cast, but the same cabin, the same woods, the same 15-feet-of-American-Steel car, and of course Bruce Campbell returning for the role of Ash.
While I enjoyed the first Evil Dead, I loved this one.  Bruce Campbell is spectacular in his intentionally over the top portrayal of Ash.  I couldn't help but wonder what the possibilities could have been if he and Ed Wood had gotten to work together.  The other members of the cast are good, but are primarily there for zombie-fodder.  There's buckets of blood in assorted colors, claymation special effects, and the best use of a chainsaw since...well maybe the Texa Chainsaw Masacre.

But as the bewitching hour draws near, it is time to stop digging for a minute and pay proper respects to a film that is so widely loved that this review will simply get washed away with the tide of reviews from its adoring masses.  I give you ""Evil Dead II"" (imagine trumpets blaring)!!

-""TURE HORROR FANS"" CAN BITE MY ASH!!
Oh yea, I'm coming after you people!!  It's time to open up a can of reality woopak on you!!  Those of you who say a horror/comedy is not horror at all are living in some self-defined fantasy world of limited thinking.  Most people in their right mind will tell you that half the fun of horror movies IS THE FUN!!!  ""Evil Dead II"" might be the most fun normal people will have while still getting a little bit scared.  So, ""true horror fans"", you can take your constipated narrow view of horror and drop it in the trash can man.  Sorry for that tantrum.  But honestly, there are so few really good, completely serious horror films that I'd die of boredom watching the same ten films over and over again.  Now that's ""true horror"".

Indiscriminate Spoilers Ahead!!

-STAY OUT OF THE CELLAR!!
I've seen this film so many times and yet, every time Ash goes into the cellar I get a little creeped out.  So yea, this film is still scary.  It's not so dark with black, shere terror that you'll have trouble going to sleep at night, but it still gets a few chills from me.  In fact, there are many elements in this film that set the standards for creepy camera work.  Sam Raimi was very inventive here.  When you see the camera (evil spirit) chasing after Ash, just think about how difficult that shot was.  Never mind the scene with the trophy animals and the c.lock on the wall laughing at him; way creepy camera angles!!  As creepy as this stuff is, it's all done brilliantly with a light hearted wink from Raimi.

-HOLD ON TO YOUR HEADS AND TAKE A BOW.
I need to honor the cast for making this one of my all time favorites.  I tend to neglect actor for the most part.  So, here's the role call.
-Bruce Campbell = Ash:  Campbell and Raimi clearly have a love for the 3 Stooges and are certainly Moe schmoes.  As the main man, Campbell might have the most expressive face this side of Jim Carrey.  Needless to say, he is great at slapstick and has made being a horror klown, art.
-Denise Bixler = Linda:  Next to Ash, Linda is the most memorable role.  Even though she technically dies very early, she spends a lot of time as a head.  Though hardly the queen of B movies, Denise gets huge respect for all the nastiness she endures in this classic.
-Ted Raimi = Possessed Henrietta:  His price for nepotism; spending hours in a ridiculous amount of latex!  What a trooper.  This is a pretty darn creepy character too.
-Sarah Berry = Annie Knowby: She has the distinct honor of being the last woman in this realm that Ash lusts after.  She gets pretty messy in the worst ways too.  Raimi was just brutal on these people.
-Kassie DePaiva = Bobbie Joe:  She's so sweet and helpful in this film.  It also turns out she's a tree hugger, well, they hug her anyway.
-Dan Hicks = Jake: Dan gets to be meat.
-Rick Domeier = Ed Getley:  Rick gets to be meat too.

These people didn't always distinguish themselves but will always have a place in the hearts of ""Evil Dead II"" fans for making this such a treat.

-IF YOU HAVE D' TIME SON, I HAVE D'WIL SON.
Well son, or daughter, or ""bro"" or ""sis"" or whatever your position in life may be, I suggest that if you haven't seen this film yet then you either don't have the time (so why are you reading this?) or the will.  Get off your butt and watch this all you fans of horror!!  Bruce Campbell is no George C. Scot, man. However, he is quite brilliant in this standard-bearing comedic/horror classic.  You can spend your Halloween all wet while you Bob for apples, and count to 22 or you can watch one of the most entertaining films a true fan of the genre could ever hope for.

3456356,4,B001AOHPXA,"If you liked the first Evil Dead movie then this will be a nice refresher of some very similar scenarios. After seemingly escaping with his life intact, Ash is back in a cabin! I tell you that boy has no common sense but without his poor judgment who else would release demons back onto our domain? So back in the cabin - check, new girlfriend - check, recycled gift given ( necklace) to new girlfriend since the last one died - check, demon book in cabin - check, tape recorder with the words needed to release the evil - check...we are back in business! Ash gets back to doing what he knows best - unleashing havoc into the world of the living. One would think that he has joined some wicked book of the month club, where the books end up getting people killed as he's always finding them. Best part is that the action starts right of the bat, there is no sitting around waiting to be attacked and when few more people get stranded in the cabin the real fun begins.

This movie was insane, I mean bug out crazy! All the things you think you'd do in your wildest dreams come to life - horror style. Not only is Ash running in circles from the menacing evil, but his own body turns on him and starts to betray him, leaning towards the dark side. Best part was the puppets again, there were some gooey gross faces from the demonic possession due to the transformation and sometimes I didn't know whether to laugh or just watch in disbelief.

This movie felt very short in comparison but the ending was fantastic, it really sets you up for a grand finale that I can't wait to watch.

I'd buy an Evil Dead DVD, and 2 months later there was another, ""better"" version of it...mind you, a lot of them were transparent money grabs, but some were actually decent and had content I wanted. I'm tired of it, and have been for quite some time...so, I finally get a BluRay player and what a shock, ""Evil Dead II"" is available. Being that I'd sold off a great majority of my DVD collection to prepare for ""the upgrade"" I decided to pick this up because the price was right and...it's Evil Dead II...YOU HAVE TO OWN IT IN SOME FORM!

Sure, it's the same old, recycled bonus content as the DVD releases pumped out for years, but it's all good stuff and I'm glad they didn't replace it. Sound and video are great, but didn't necessarily need the BluRay touch -- at points this looks about as good as it can on DVD. In short, this is a great addition to your collection if you don't already have it DVD (or ""upgraded"" like I did), but the THX-approved DVD version is probably just as good as this.

I'd say grab this up if you're a first-time buyer or upgrading from laserdisc/VHS, but don't sweat it otherwise...I'm sure in a year there will be a mega-super-deluxe-Evil-Dead-IIray. Here's hoping THAT trend dies with this release, at least!",1215216000,,1294,4.502127659574468
3456360,5,B001AOHPXA,"Evil Dead II:Dead By Dawn is the 1987 sequel to the Evil Dead movie made in 1981. The film was directed by Sam Raimi. It starred Bruce Campbell & Sarah Berry. Often looked upon as a remake of the first film on a higher budget, it isn't and wasn't intended to be. The story goes a lil something like this: Ash and his girlfriend Linda take a romantic vacation to a seemingly abandoned cabin in the woods (which is all just basically a recap of the first film minus everyone else to catch viewers up with the plot). While in the cabin, Ash plays a tape of an archeology professor reciting passages from the Necronomicon(or ""Book of the Dead""), which he has discovered during an archaeological dig(the professor, that is.). The recorded incantation unleashes an evil force that kills and possesses the body of Linda. Ash is forced to sacrifice his girlfriend. After he buries and dismembers his girlfriend, a spirit is seen on the hunt for Ash. It's there where the film picks up and continues. Alot of people don't know it but this movie might not have been made if it weren't for Author Stephen King. At the time, King was directing his first movie, Maximum Overdrive, based on his short story ""Trucks"". He had dinner with a crewmember who had been interviewed about the Evil Dead sequel, and the crewmember told King that the film was having trouble attracting funding. Upon hearing this, King, who had written a review of the first film which helped it become an audience favorite, called Dino De Laurentiis and asked him to fund the film. Initially skeptical, De Laurentiis agreed but only alotted Raimi & company $3.6 million as opposed to them wanting $4 million to make the movie. This sequel was originally planned to send Ash back to Medieval times but it was scrapped because of funding. That concept, eventually, became the third movie in the Evil Dead series. Evil Dead II did quite well at the box-office with fans of the original returning to see the further adventures of their favorite hero, Ash. Only this time, it isn't so much a horror movie as it is a 'dark' comedy of sorts with lots of gore. It's further proof that movies of this type can succeed. This Special Edition DVD is packed with plenty of extras. Indeed, it's another classic worth adding to your collection.",1207612800,,2288,4.651851851851852

It is still a improvement over the standard dvd release though.  Therefore it is a welcome addition to my collection. However I am going to email starz and ask them why at the more expensive prices of blu ray that they don't treat each release like a special edition.  After all few of us are going to replace this version with a new blu ray version that costs 40.00 just to get deleted scenes.  At this price all blu rays should be treated as special editions and deliver any deleted scenes that such a edition would have.  Starz is not the only company doing this either.

Evil Dead II, however, remains almost timeless with its over-the-top gore and sadistically savage humor.  On the A-List of B-Movies, this film remains a cult favorite with star Bruce Campbell manning the show in one of his most memorable performances to date (see ""Army of Darkness"" for more memorableness and see ""Bubba Ho-Tep"" to make you urn for an ""Evil Dead IV"" with an older Ash).

3456366,5,B001AOHPXA,"First of all, let me say that this movie isn't for everyone, especially those who don't understand Sam Raimi's intentions. If you're looking for a straightforward horror movie, then you completely missing the point and probably will not like it.

If you can enjoy a movie that blends genres into a single amalgamation of entertainment, then EDII might be right up your alley.

At best, Evil Dead II: Dead by Dawn is a tongue-in-cheek work, a riff on the genre as well as a showcase of director Sam Raimi's love of slapstick humor, directoral prowess, and willingness to torture lead actor Bruce Campbell.

Oh, but there's blood. Hundreds of gallons of it. Easily as much as the first movie, and it's more well-done thanks to the budget. Decapitations. Gore. Screams. Laughing lamps and deer heads. Greg Nicotero's effects, as usual, are great.

Much of the fun in watching EDII:DBD is seeing the horrors that the main character, Ash (played by B-Rate genius Bruce Campbell), endures. He's alone for nearly thirty minutes and carries the action with a wide-eyed naivete that is almost maddeningly endearing. His physical comedy is unmatched and the one-liners made him semi-famous.

A remake of the first movie, Evil Dead II should be viewed with the context in mind. It is as well-done as any 80s horror movie with twice the wit and gore simultaneously.",1193011200,,1353,4.916666666666667

Sure most of it is dark and a bit grainy at times but its still sharper then any dvd I've seen of it. The close ups on ash you can really see the improvement. $20 is a very good price too I think. For a true fan there is even any decision to make here. I also purchased Dawn Of the Dead at the same time and DOTD does indeed look better, but then again most of DOTD is filmed in better lighting.

If you already own the DVD and are not a huge fan of the Evil Dead movies, it is hard to recommend the Blu-ray version simply for audio/video quality. The picture does seem brighter and more clear in high-def, but can be subtle during a good bit of the picture. Since much of it was filmed in the dark, it tends to look grainy at times. Daylight scenes look outstanding compared to the DVD though with the exception of the final sequence when Ash gets sent back to the medieval period.

3456376,5,B001AOHPXA,"Allow me to preface this review with a helpful fact.  A few years back when Spin Magazine was writing about the films they felt were the greatest of the 20th century, they chose to include Sam Raimi's sequel to his very first film; which was a small independent horror called The Evil Dead.  The Evil Dead was a great film in it's own right, however, the editors at Spin wanted to give Evil Dead 2: Dead by Dawn the recognition they felt it deserved.  So they placed it at the top of their list...that's right, they felt that it is, in fact, the single greatest cinematic achievement of the 20th century.

Evil Dead 2 follows Ash Williams and his girlfriend into a small creepy Michigan cottage where they stumble upon some recordings that contain readings from an ancient relic called the book of the dead, and by playing these recordings they unleash demonic supernatural forces that quickly haunt and possess everything from the trees outside and Popeye's lamp to Ash's hand and his girlfriend's severed head.  The shenanigans unfold and Ash is more game than perhaps anyone to take on these evil forces as best as he can, but some sort of defeat is consistently inevitable.

As a reader I hope you are not anticipating my rebuttal to Spin Magazine here. I just so happen to concur 100% with Spin's gutsy assertion.  On the surface of Evil Dead 2, we are seeing vintage 80s shock horror but it certainly isn't presented deeply enough to qualify amongst the failures within that genre.  Evil Dead 2 is microcosmically structured like classic slapstick and macrocosmically it functions as pure satire.  In this sense it's budget is used firmly to it's advantage and runs together with the theme of making a select audience laugh, first and foremost.  Those who are both distinctly either disturbed by gore or preoccupied by gore as a strength in horror, should take keen note that gore in this film is applied almost exclusively for physical slapstick comedy.  Those who hate gore will hate it here and those who love to be immersed in gore may not understand or appreciate it's use in Evil Dead 2.

We get to see a chubby fruit cellar witch's soul-swallowing head extend via shoddy stop-motion effects.  We get to see an eyeball pop out of her head and shoot across the room into some chick's mouth.  We get so see blood spray humorously and pretty consistently out of the walls and floors of the cottage.  We get to see Ash fight his hand, cut it off, and add a chainsaw to where his hand once was.  We get to see him kill his girlfriend and fight both her severed head and headless body in a tool shed at the same time.  We get to see Ash get clumsily chased around the house by a force of evil we never see.  We also get to see the volume of slapstick comedy increase as the film goes on and finally we get to see a conclusion that still makes me kind of wish they never made a sequel (even though Army of Darkness is in and of itself a very good movie).

Evil Dead 2 may require a deeper degree of movie history appreciation, perhaps more specifically to exploitation and horror films.  I know I sound like a movie snob saying that but the film does offer some fun and fitting tributes or references to past films.  I think it is definitely fair to say that Raimi has a great appreciation for movies in general and we can plainly see that he has so much fun making them.  Evil Dead 2 for me is fun, affable, and carefree; it is all the things it shouldn't be on it's surface, and it is perfect for that fact alone.",1179792000,,3520,4.458658346333853

3456378,5,B001AOHPXA,"The series takes a left turn towards comedy in this sequel to a straight out horror film, not to say there is no horror to be found. There are plenty of scenes that will make you jump if you don't know what is coming, but there is a lot of laughs as well. In one word, the movie is fun. Bruce Campbell carries the film since it really does focus on his character and changes Ash from a quiet person into this explosive action hero that you can't help but cheer on! Every time I think of my favorite scenes, the majority of them involve Ash, which is what makes him such a great character. The big scene I immediately think of is when he fights his own hand, you'll just have to watch to see that for yourself.

A bigger budget was used in the making of this movie, but some B qualities still can be seen in the movie. Such as you can see there is no roof to the cabin when Ash is trying to out run the deadite spirit following him into the house. Another instance being when the eye pops out of the deadite, you can see the little black piece of plastic making the eye fly. Small things like that do not effect this movie, the story is compelling and you will ignore anything that seems cheesy. There is too much good about the movie and will always win over anything bad that can be said about this movie.

People kept asking after watching the first movie, why wasn't Ash every possessed in the first film when all of his friends were? Well, he gets to be possessed in this film in more than one occasion, so it goes to show that even he isn't immune. Overall, this is another MUST SEE! I have watched the movie many times and this is definitely something that will never get old.",1178150400,,1682,4.172307692307692
3456379,5,B001AOHPXA,"I loved this movie when I first saw it when I was 17, and I love it even more now. The main character, Ash, played by Bruce Campbell, is iconic in his hilarious idiocy. The creatures are lovely, the plot is very entertaining, and lots of people die in creative ways, and/or are tormented by an evil detatched hand. Don't watch this movie expecting complete slasher action, though. The blood content is high, but the direct gore factor is much lower than in the first one (and fortunately, there are no tree-rapes). I also recommend watching the behind-the-scenes mini-film, ""The Gore the Merrier,"" for an entertaining look at what went into the film. Fans of the series will definately enjoy this film (I actually saw ""Army of Darkness"" first, and worked my way back). Also, fans of actor Bruce Campbell, or director Sam Raimi will enjoy this film. Also, if you're a hard-core Ted Raimi fan (like I am), you'll probably enjoy watching him struggle around in a full monster body suit as the possessed Henrietta (the poor thing).

This is everything a horror comedy should be and even if it's labeled as a B-Movie, I think it competes with even the A-list horror of today. In fact, a lot of the A-list horror today is crap compared to this genius. Bruce Campbell portrays Ash like you've never seen him before and he's stuck inside of the same creepy cabin with deadites everywhere, which isn't exactly for the faint of heart. Don't worry, this isn't as scary as the first one. The first half of the movie is Ash struggling to keep the Evil Dead from possessing his body. The second half has newcomers arriving at the cabin, only to find out the horror of what has happened. Everything gets possessed in this movie at least once (including inanimate objects and excluding three people). There are also actual antagonists such as Henrietta and Rotten Apple head.

Bruce Campbell takes on the role of Ash once again in this hilariously horrific sequel to a legendary movie. Few sequels live up to the original and fewer still surpass it. This is one of those rare instances. This movie is out of this world. Sam Raimi is a genius with a camera and has gone on to create some damn fine films. He deserves every amount of success he has gained. The script is inventive, highly original, and funny as all hell. It's a mix of horror, laughs, and gore; or splatstick as Campbell calls it. Once again, Campbell's facial expressions alone are worth the price of admission. If that doesn't get you the laughing deer head will. Evil Dead II: Dead By Dawn is a true horror masterpiece.

I suggest that if you are a big fan of either Bruce Campbell or just The Evil Dead trilogy you should BUY!There are extras that would give any B Film lover a Campbellgasm.

3456387,5,B001AOHPXA,"Did I say scary? Yeah, this movie is a little scary, not too much though. But it's more frightening than most of today's ""scary"" movies. It's also much more enjoyable.

Bruce Campbell is the ultimate b-movie actor. He has the greatest facial expressions in history. For about 30 minutes during the movie, there are no words, just grunts and facial expressions by Campbell as he's getting attacked by the evil spirits. That part of the movie is great fun. These sequences of Campbell fighting off the spirits show how much of a genius Sam Raimi is.

The sequences with Campbell were so good, it's possible to tolerate the non-Campbell parts of the movie.

I highly recommend this movie. It is perfect for those nights when friends are visiting and you are all debating what to watch. Chances are they wouldn't have seen this movie and if they did, they'll be excited to know you have it.",1153785600,,886,4.666666666666667

STORY: Ash returns to the remote cabin with his girlfriend. The stay at the cabin turns into a nightmare. The next morning, He gets attacked by the unseen evil, and because of that, he unleashes Evil Ash. He tries to escape, but the bridge has been destroyed! Now, his hand goes all bad, which turns him into a one-handed zombie killer, and when people find him in the cabin, they dislike him at first. But when they learn what has happened to them, they must tam up with Ash.

OPINION: Awesome sequel! More gore, more excitement, and I love the ending. Waves the atmosphere ready for Army Of Darkness.

3456390,4,B001AOHPXA,"Though this was not the first modern horror film to use parody (Dawn of the Dead, An American Werewolf in London are examples), the lengths to which is goes are wildly imaginative. Just like Re-Animator spoofed the sci-fi/horror genre, Evil Dead 2 takes on the slasher film genre and sends it up way before the Scream/I Know What You Did Last Summer/Scary Movie cash cows. For those who liked the ""tree"" sequence in the first Evil Dead movie, imagine it being magnified over and over again. Using the stop motion animation technique in a deliberately crude fashion, Evil Dead 2 is still wildly imaginative.  A person tries to fight off their own severed hand. Visions appear from nowhere. The first sequence in speeded up time is dizzily unnerving. If you don't like slasher films (believe me this is a hell of a lot better than any Friday the 13th film, take your pick) or if you're one of those old blue haired types ranting about ""video nasties"" then stay away. However, if you want a good, gorey and even sometimes scary descent into madness then Evil Dead 2 is for you. For real film fanatics, one might note (though on a far more intellectual level)the sense of the world collapsing and turning against the protagonist(s) of the film can also be found (albeit much more arty and far less gorey) in the films of Jan Svankmeyer. As for the casual horror buff, Evil Dead II is a classic of the subgenre of splatter films with a sense of humor which would be taken to new heights with Rob Zombie's ""The Devil's Rejects"".

3456394,3,B001AOHPXA,"Sam Raimi's horror masterpiece is possibly my favourite of Raimi films, and horror films ever made. It's full of 80's gore, cheese, and one-liners. So when i saw it available on UMD, i just had grab a copy ASAP.

Picture:

As far as the PQ on the UMD disc, it's quite rough on the edges. We get a pretty standard transfer, complete with all the blemishes and grain seen on it's dvd counterpart. It also suffers from some nasty smearing seen on certain UMD's like Spider-man. But, apart from that,it was what I expected.

3/5

Sound:

Hmmmm.......This UMD is a strange one on the sound front. I recommend watching this movie on ""Full Volume"" from the start (as it's quite soft) and then turning it down when the action and chaos ramps up (it gets pretty loud towards the end...Beware!!).

It serves it's purpose and I still enjoyed what it had to offer.

3/5

Extras:

None.

0/0

Overall:

Even though it's a pretty sub-standard UMD with no extras and average PQ and Sound, i still recommend it to any fan. I've watched it over 5 times since purchase, and that ain't a bad thing.

3456397,4,B001AOHPXA,"Director:  Sam Raimi

Cast:  Bruce Campbell, Sarah Berry, Dan Hicks, Kassie DePaiva, Ted Raimi, Denise Bixler, Richard Domeier, John Peaks, Lou Hancock.

Running Time:  85 minutes

Rated R for extreme violence, language, and nudity.

Our hero Ash returns in this 1987 blood bath of a follow-up to ""The Evil Dead"". The king of slapstick horror does a bang up job of combining laughs and plenty of gore to create one of the most memorable and beloved horror sequels of all time. What some people may or may not know is, the movie, intended to be a sequel, was actually a revisited version of the first film. In this version, Ash (Bruce Campbell) returns to the dreaded cabin in the woods with only his girlfriend Linda (Denise Bixler) and his infamous Oldsmobile. What was meant to be a quiet, relaxing get-a-way in the woods suddenly explodes into a bloody night of survival when Ash is forced to do battle with the evil that lies within the woods. Possessed trees, zombie mothers, and one demonic hand all set the stage for Ash as he risks life and limb (literally) to make it through the night. Joined later by Annie Knowby (Sarah Berry), the daughter of Professor Raymond Knowby (the man who unlocked the mysteries of the book of the dead), Ed Getly, (Richard Domeier), and two wanderers Bobby Joe (Kassie Depaiva) and Jake (Dan Hicks) Ash and his crew must survive the night, or be dead by dawn.

Despite that fact that Sam Raimi is now a ""proper"" director making summer blockbusters like his life depended on it, it is still heartening to see that his frenzied style is still present in his work, albeit it not dealing with such extreme material as that which made his name famous decades ago. While Evil Dead II may be a complete repeat of Evil Dead in terms of the basic narrative and content, it is still worth seeing because of Raimi's skill as director and writer of the film.  Horror fans may find it a little tame by modern standards although I still found it to be pretty scary and gory - certainly considering it was made almost 20 years ago with a budget that would barely buy you an A-listed movie star these days. The film is also pretty funny and is full of dark humor and comic moments that make it more entertaining than a gory b-movie has any right being. But here's the thing, the success of this film and indeed the whole trilogy, is mainly due to two people - Sam Raimi and Bruce Campbell. Raimi drives everything with his unique direction that places the action somewhere between a horror and a cartoon. It has great camera work, frantic shots and a real flair for the unreal; it is very hard to describe but it can be seen it many of his films.

Campbell's ongoing cult status has only been helped recently by Bubba Ho-tep but this is where it basically began and part II only sees his continue his good work as Ash becomes more of a hero than he was in the first film. He still has the cowardly quality that I loved in Ash but now has weapons and kiss-off lines to compliment his new status. As before his performance perfectly matches Raimi's direction and I can totally understand why the two have kept their close relationship decades later; they really seem to ""get"" each other here. Support from Berry, Hicks, DePaiva, Domeier and Bixler is just about passable for this type of b-movie stuff but really the cast is dominated by Campbell playing his best character to date.  Overall, this is a gory, cheap horror movie that won't appeal to everybody but to those that get it, it will be a hugely enjoyable, gory film with a great sense of humor. Director Raimi and actor Campbell truly makes the film work better than the material would suggest it should and, on the basis of any of the three films, it is no wonder that this is such a timeless cult horror.",1136678400,,3787,4.513868613138686
3456398,5,B001AOHPXA,"Proof that sequels can be better than the original, this wild, hysterically funny, gory rollercoaster of a movie recaps the first (give or take a few characters) with Ash (Bruce Campbell) and his girlfriend Linda (Denise Bixler) heading to a mountain cabin in the woods and finding more than they bargained for. Ash plays a tape recorder that has chantings from a Professor Knowby which raise spirits that possess Linda. One decapitation later, she's six feet under, and it's up to Ash to kick demon booty, as Knowby's daughter Annie (Sarah Berry) shows up with boyfriend Ed (Richard Domeier) and two hillbilly locals named Jake & Bobbie Joe (Dan Hicks & Kassie Wesley). Oh yeah, and Ash's right hand decides to turn bad, so he 'lops it off at the wrist' and slams a chainsaw down onto it for a showdown with Henrietta (director Sam Raimi's little brother Ted, in a brilliant casting idea), Knowby's demon wife living in the wine cellar.
 This truly is a revolutionary movie, one of the first and most memorable to balance comedy and gore-splattering humor successfully (like Shaun of the Dead, Dead & Breakfast, the Scream trilogy, Idle Hands, etc., just to name a few). Campbell became a B-movie king with the Evil Dead trilogy (the third sequel is Army of Darkness), and rightfully so, as he takes all the insane goings-on with a straight face and clever wisecracks (many ripped off by the likes of Duke Nukem). Raimi truly is an amazing director (he went on to make the great Spider-Man movies and is releasing #3), using Three Stooges-like gags in between the flying limbs and splashing gore.
 If you like horror movies at all, the Evil Dead movies are one of the best (or THE best) to have, spawning three games (Hail to the King, Fistful of Boomstick, and Regeneration) so far, making a career for Bruce (don't call him Ash) Campbell and Raimi, and pretty much reinventing the horror genre with tongue-in-bloody-cheek action.

Both books together are scheduled for release Novem./

Decemb. 2005 in one paper package /same paper pack. as the second book/ as a gift set edition.

I also recommend you to get a bootleg /30minutes/ of the original short movie WITHIN THE WOODS starring THE CHIN himself Mr. BRUCE CAMPBELL, I got it, the quality of vhs/dvd transfer was poor of course, but still a major thing for the hard deadite fans.

The 2005 region2 /United Kingdom/ re - edition of The EVIL DEAD 1 /1982/ - BOOK OF THE DEAD1 was released as a 2dvd set including an extra dvd put alongside with the booklet with a film starring B.Campbell called Running Time /1998/, it had English DD2.0+DD5.1+DTS5.1,no extras.

So keep your fingers crossed for The EVIL DEAD 4, Campbell,Tapert and RAIMI should reunite again for this movie, and now Sam Raimi being a Hollywood big shot because of a Spiderman1+2 succes, he should be able to come with a budget that could deliver The BIGGEST Evil Dead EXTRAVAGANZA ever, I would very much like to see a rating on that movie, probably a new classification would be needed.

The film manages to make you go ""Urgh! Gross!"" AND laugh at the same time. Here's an example: in one scene there's a zombie trying to get out of a cellar through a trap door. Two men try to keep the trap door closed by standing, lying and jumping on it. But the zombie's head sticks out at the same time they're jumping on it. Whaddya get? A squashed head. And whaddya get when that happens? An eyeball that pops out of the head - one that goes flying across the room and goes straight into a screaming woman's mouth!!! HAHAHAHA. This film is hilarious! And the ""possessed hand"" scene is awesome.",1131062400,,763,4.232876712328767
3456402,5,B001AOHPXA,"THE EVIL DEAD was a cult hit when it came out on video, thanks to word of mouth and great camera work and special effects. It was also good thanks to the acting kitsch of Bruce Campbell and company, but Campbell made the cut. Now with the idea that another 'Dead' movie would follow, could it match up to the kitsch and scares of the first? You bet!

EVIL DEAD 2: Dead By Dawn is ultimately more a campy, funny, and scarier re-make of the first film (although it is a sequel, it's more a reinvisioning of the first film with better elements). It even approaches a sort of ""looney tunes"" type status with some of its scares, especially the moment where Ash's girlfriend spins out in front with her head popping off and then back on (this is after ash decapitated her and buried her out front).

Back to the woods we go, for another round. Ash comes to the cabin (or cottage, whatever you want to call it) with girlfriend Linda (not the same one from the first) for a relaxing getaway, and ultimately finds an device and plays the tape in it and incantations once again summon our evil spirit fiends from the woods. The real beginning of the film is terrific, with the ""force"" plowing through the woods, the cabin, through the front door and, ultimately, to our hero, possessing him until the rise of the sun. A new group of people decide to visit the cabin themselves, and then the mayhem ultimately proceeds to ensue, with one of the funniest being mother locked in the basement (remember the creepy moments in the basement in the first movie? those are nothing compared to the moments in this one), trying to trick her daughter into letting her out. The best moments of the film come when Ash's hand decides to take on a mind of its own after his hand gets bit by one of the possessed newcomers, and Ash hacks it off and links his hand-less arm to a chainsaw (could that be an homage to Texas Chainsaw? Nah!). This movie has more laughs than the first one does, but it still does have its very creepy moments, with the frenzied camera angles returning; the possessed woods capturing a woman and, near the end, ultimately coming to life to batter the cabin while Ash and one person struggle against the forces in the woods; the big giant scary, but really quite amusing, face that appears in the doorway before being sucked into the portal, which ultimately sucks our hero into another time, leading into the camp ARMY OF DARKNESS, which is by all means a true completion to this ever scary but truly fun trilogy. It, like its predecessor, has a great ending...you will truly appreciate the work Raimi put into this film, with Bruce Campbell (now one of my favorite actors) back in top form with his manic and frenzied performance.

DEAD BY DAWN is the ultimate follow-up to a cult favorite, and the third and final installment of the series would very much end the series on a campy note. Would this be the last we hear from our buddies Campbell and Raimi? Definitely not. Was ARMY OF DARKNESS the last EVIL DEAD? Only time will tell. Is EVIL DEAD 2 worth your watch?

3456403,5,B001AOHPXA,"Okay. Granted...most of you are here because you are a fan of this terrific cult classic. But for those that are unfamiliar with this flick, don't make the same mistake that I made almost 20 years ago now when I first thought about renting this at my local video store.

The mistake I made was not renting it. It was the title of the movie that scared me away...the word ""evil"" to be matter of fact. I was sure that it was just one of those poorly acted shock-value festivals of ""evil"" people, zombies, whatever, doing really mean, torturous things to others. Well, I finally rented it sometime in like 1989 after it was on the shelves for a year, and, boy, was I wrong about thinking that this would be a bad movie.

The flick starts out with a guy and his girl heading to a supposedly deserted cabin in a remote forest. And the horror and hilarity then begin. Upon first view, I didn't even realize the deliberate humor that was going on until the infamous hand possesion. Henrietta's appearance then makes for a good scary several minutes, and is then lightened to one of the most humorous moments in horror film history...let's just say it's eye-popping.

There are chills and laughs all throughout this classic, even on the second, third, etc viewings. I suggest that you will watch more than once, because, as with me, once you realize this is as much a comedy as it is a horror flick, you will want to look for the jokes that you might have mistaken previously for campyness.

Well, Anchor Bay has done it again.

I don't subscribe to that philosophy that there can be too much of a good thing.  Don't get me wrong, endless double dipping video releases are quite commonplace nowadays, and I have been guilty of indulging in re-buying for added disks and new features.  Sometimes I wait for extended editions (Lord of the Rings, anybody?)

But, I don't even remotely consider the release of Evil Dead II, Book of the Dead edition as double dipping.  This is an entirely different proposition.

Everyone that is lucky enough to own a copy of the deluxe edition of Evil Dead knows what I mean.  It's not just a DVD, it's a packaging delight (and makes for one HELL of a Halloween decoration.)  And now, Anchor Bay gives us another Halloween gift...The Book of the Dead- Evil Dead 2 style.  Amazingly rendered, incredibly well sculpted.

Features?  Widescreen Edition.  Unrated. The insanely funny commentary from Raimi, Campbell, Spiegel and Nicotero.  The FANTASTIC ""The Gore The Merrier"" featurette.  Theatrical trailer.  Talent bios.  AND.....a new feature; Evil Dead 2: Behind the Screams.  Gone is the horrible advert for ""Hail to the King""....I mean, who wants to see a video game promo?  This is Evil Dead 2 CANON.  Only thing missing that I can tell is a full screen edition (bleah) and Still Galleries (whatever.)

3456409,3,B001AOHPXA,"I realize that it is very fashionable to love really bad films just for the love of their badness.  And Dead By Dawn is the worst kind of badness -- a totally awful sequel to a film that was a parody of the totally awful films I grew up with.  It is a film where one can actually see the actors suddenly realize that they are acting too well and, with a jerk, dumb everything down even more.  At some point one has to wonder whether Sam Raimi is making fun of the whole genre, just scream films, or me.  The latter, I suspect.  And everyone else who goes through contortions explaining why really bad films are actually 'cool.'

Standard hokey plot - one after another a group of people are drawn to the cabin of an archeologist working on a translation of the Necronomicon.  Lovecraft turns over in his grave.  A section is read and draws the attention of an ancient evil.  Soon people are being possessed, the dead rise, and parts mix with axes and chainsaws in an ever-growing chaotic pile.

Every effect is studiously arranged to ring a bit false.  While there are spectaular makeup jobs, the effect is intentionally comic.  But the comedy, the sight gags, the windows that are perpetually broken and then boarded up again, and the tiny cabin with it's infinity of rooms really don't hold the film together, any more than they would a burlesque show.  This is a film designed for intermittent attention.  Any 10 minutes tells you exactly the same thing as every other 10 minutes.

As a result I kept staring at the cabin's clocks with the 'dead by dawn' refrain repeating in my mind, hoping against hope for a glimpse of sunrise.  As much popularity as this film enjoys, it never made it over my own bar, and I'm not really all that much of a snob.  But each viewer should decide for him or herself.

3456411,5,B001AOHPXA,"This sequel to the cult classic film, Evil Dead, is the next installment into, what is praised to be, one of the goriest black comedy horror films to ever hit the film circuit. This film glorifies the very campy fun and essence of your typical B-movie plot, with a side of exaggerated amounts of cartoony violence and blood. Ash takes his girlfriend to a deserted cabin for a splendid weekend together of romance, but everything goes spiralling down into a blaze of horror as Ash idiotically finds a tape recording of a reading of, what is refered to as, ""The Book of the Dead."" From here on, this is when the film picks up and the girlfriend goes missing after 'something in the woods' smashes through her window. The origin of the book is narrated in the first 2 minutes, and it almost takes and additional 3 minutes for the girlfriend to go missing. For the rest of the film, Ash battles the forces of evil that reincarnate themselves into everything, from huge trees to even small books. The film is hilarious, with its 'splatstick' humor that pays homage to the likes of The Three Stooges. The pop up scares are impeccable and are always right on target with their build ups. This is a fast, fierce, scary, and most of all, incredibly good humored work by Sam Raimi. I highly recommend this film to horror fans who love a good scare, but at the same time, don't mind laughing at the same time as they're doing so.",1126051200,,1418,4.5

Watch this fantastic movie to find out.

I own two versions of the dvd. The original skull cover dvd (which I wouldn't buy because it's a barebones dvd,and it runs about $50

new on amazon.)and the oop limited edition tin,which has the same feature as the special edition. As of now I would recommend that special edition.

3456413,5,B001AOHPXA,"This movie is a classic, as are part 1 and Army of Darkness. It's ridiculous and over the top, but in a good way. The cheesey effects and absurdity of this film are what make it great. It's similar to the first one, but it's way more over the top this time around. This is the film where Ash starts to become a bada$$, when he attaches a chainsaw to his arm. This film was meant to be over the top and people who rate it poorly because of that don't know what they're talking about.
Just look at the reviews written by HorrorMan on here. This guy has written pages and pages of reviews about horror films and can never make a point. He bases his reviews on whether or not the film is really a horror film. If he doesn't like a horror movie he says that it's not horror and rates it badly. And he even admits some movies are good but not as horror films, so he rates them poorly. One example is his review of Interview with the Vampire. He gave this movie one star because he says it wasn't scary and because vampires were depicted as being sympathetic and having emotions. He says vampires have no emotions, that they're just savage killers. First of all he's way off. Vampires are extremely passionate and emotional people. They ARE human. He has no idea what he's talking about. And second of all, it's not meant to be scary, so don't use that as a reason. HorrorMan rated Evil Dead 2 as one star because it's cheesey and has funny moments. This guy should have all his reviews deleted. They're illogical, poorly written, and he always adds to his reviews something like ""Some people call this a horror movie. I call it rubbish."" Try to say something original for a change. A horror movie CAN BE BAD. And just because a movie isn't necessarily a horror movie but has horror elements DOES NOT MEAN YOU SHOULD GIVE IT ONE STAR BECAUSE IT DOESN'T HAVE ALL YOUR PRECONCEIVED IDEAS ABOUT WHAT A HORROR MOVIE SHOULD HAVE. All you do is say stuff like ""this movie isn't scary"" etc. Your gripe is that Evil Dead 2 is placed in the horror section at stores. SO WHAT??? So you are saying if this was in the comedy section then you wouldn't rate it with one star? You are illogical. You have these preconceived notions that you think all horror movies should have, and then judge the movies based on that. All your reviews are flawed. You actually think Interview with the Vampire was meant to be a pure horror fillm? It's a drama. Stop writing reviews about movies that aren't horror films necessarily and judging them based on typical horror movie elements. That's like if I were to write a review about Schindler's List and say ""This is a good movie but it doesn't work well as a comedy."" None of your reviews offer anything worth reading. I can't believe I actually read many of yours. They are all the same. You almost never say anything specific about the movie. You just spew your hatred of a movie and then claim it's not a horror movie because you think it's bad or because you don't think it works well as a horror movie (which makes no sense).
Hopefully your next review will contain something worthy, rather than your usual nonsense, pretending to sound intelligent when you are saying nothing at all about the film. You said ""The movie ""Evil Dead II"" contains too much lame comedy and extremely ridiculous creatures plus outrageous gore scenes to be effective as a ""pure"" horror movie."" SO WHAT? Okay so it is not pure horror. WHAT IS YOUR POINT? Just because it's not pure horror doesn't mean it's not a good film. Complaining about Evil Dead 2 being too outrageous is like complaining about a comic book movie not being realistic.
I don't care what genre anyone places this movie in; it's great. ""In my opinion, this is a poor movie as far as the horror movie genre is concerned."" Your illogical reviews are so full of crap. It's a horror movie with comedic elements. Get over it. If you don't like the fact it has elements that aren't ""pure horror"" (whatever that means) then don't rate it. Obviously you hate movies that aren't imaginative and add something new. You just want your standard one-dimensional film that's just like so many others. If you don't think this movie is a horror film, and you only rate horror movies, then don't rate it. We don't need people like you lowering the score just because you think it's bad for the genre. All your reviews are about one thing: whether the movie is good as a horror film or not. You are incapable of looking past the restrictions of a genre and actually rate the film with your own ideas. You only use the genre as a basis for review. Now back to the movie...
One reason I love this movie is because it widens the genre. It actually makes bad effets look good! I'm pretty sure the director intended it to be over the top and campy and have corny dialogue and effects. All these elements enhance the film. I am not sure if this film was the first horror movie which was intended to be comical and ridiculous, but it's so effective in that regard that I think it can be labelled as the first successful one (correct me if I'm wrong). Bruce Campbell is excellent in this movie. There's a point where he goes from being scared and unsure to taking control of the situation and this is when the humor jumps up a notch. This type of film just doesn't seem to be made anymore. The 70s and 80s were the classic era for horror films. The Evil Dead series is a gem. You don't have to watch part 1 to understand this film. It's so outrageous and over the top. All the crazy looking demons, possessed trees, and enourmous amounts of blood coming out of nowhere...priceless! This movie will surely entertain you.",1124150400,,5659,4.437079731027858
3456414,4,B001AOHPXA,"Sam Raimi tries to improve the first Evil Dead movie with more budget on Evil Dead II and has considerable success. The story line is the same with added dialoug and plenty more action sequences and more characters, The film is also longer, bordering on too long. Improvements are a notch above everything that was good about the first one. The makeup, the acting, the writing, the plotline, the climax are all improved, albeit just a bit. Raimi makes plenty good use of his incredible steady-cam sequences and adds ample new scary scenes. Overall this is an improved version of the Evil Dead movie with a bit of humor added to break the sheer terror. This is what actually hurts the film after several viewings. raimi keeps you on edge with fear and exciting, pulse pounding horror sequences and absolute terror, then breaks your mood with humor that hits you from left field, or something....builds up terror again only to tease you with a humorous scene amid the horror. It works effectivly until multiple viewings. The climax sets up the underrated ""Army of Darkness"" sequel which you may or may not like. many see this as the finer of the two Evil Dead movies, I prefer the original which, I believe today has more chutzpah because it was the first. you won't go wrong renting or owning either.

3456415,5,B001AOHPXA,"Nowadays, the American horror film is raking it in at the box office.  Or so it would appear to the casual observer.  Truth be told, the genre is under siege at all fronts.  It seems like every horror film coming out anymore is a sequel, an inferior adaptation of a J-horror hit, a far inferior remake of a 1970s classic, or just plain garbage (_Godsend_ anyone?).

_Evil Dead 2_ from 1987 was guilty of none of the above.  It wasn't even a sequel so much as it was a complete reworking of the 1983 underground cult classic _The Evil Dead_.  While at times the 1983 version suffered because of its extremely low budget, it was undeniable that it possessed a fire and energy that is absent in just about every $100 million (or more)  produced film out there.  Not to mention director Sam Raimi was only 24 years old at the time.  _ED2_ was the version that Raimi and actor Bruce Campbell wanted to make since they had more money to their disposal.

The end result turned out to be unquestionably one of the greatest horror films of all time.  It is a wild thrill ride from beginning to end that was wholly unlike anything that came out before it, including its predecessor.  While the combination of horror and comedy was nothing new at the time, it was almost never done with such pinache.  The viewer was treated with dancing demon zombies, Campbell being thrown around like a baseball during spring training, and an epic battle between Campbell and his right hand.  All of which has to seen to be believed.

The 1993 film _Army of Darkness_ was the first true sequel of the _ED_ franchise.  It takes the lesser chosen route of sequelization by continuing the story instead of recycling it.  It saddens me to think that that may be the last _ED_ film because of Raimi's success with _Spiderman_.  Don't get me wrong here, I enjoy the _Spiderman_ films.  I'm not going to call Raimi a ""sellout"" or anything else derogatory because I believe that he dreamed of making such films his entire life.  I feel his success couldn't have happened to a better director.  It's just that in times like these when originality and energetic filmmaking is lacking in modern horror (well actually any genre today), we need another _ED_ film.  Until, that happens, I'm just going to hope I'm wrong.",1123891200,,2281,4.594059405940594

3456419,3,B001AOHPXA,"I have read so many reviews, claiming ""Evil Dead 2"" to be one of the best horror films ever written.  Many say that this movie, is hilarious and just their favorite to watch.  I don't see that.

Don't get me wrong, this film is enjoyable; but it certainly does not qualify as a horror classic.

This is basically a remake of the original ""Evil Dead""(which I found to be a much better film).

Ash(Bruce Campbell) revisits the cabin in the woods that he was in during the first film.  While there, he stumbles upon the Book of the Dead and unleashes an evil spirit intent on killing every living thing in its path.

That's the only plot this film gives.  Dialogue is also very rare in this film.

Campbell battles with the evil spirits or zombies(they are dead) until they are finally cast back where they came from.

This movie is funny and should definetly not be taken seriously.  The gore is phenomenal and is what kept me interested in the film.  I understand the whole ""Rambo"" parody that writer/director Sam Raimi was going for, but I don't find it to be funny or effective at all. Rather, I find the undead and the way in which they attack Campbell to be funny.

The DVD extras are worth viewing on this film and there is a commentary track included.  This movie is not suitable for young children or squemish folks; but if you are not part of either category, I would recommend checking this film out for a good laugh.

All in all, I will watch this film again, and perhaps after further viewings; find the ""classic"" status so many label this film with.  But, until then, I find this to be an adequate horror film, lacking in pot, but full of laughs and gore.

Due to copyright restrictions or some other legalese, Sam Raimi wasn't allowed to use footage of the original Evil Dead, so it's almost like Ash is starting all over with his deadly confrontation in the woods.  This time it's only Ash and his girlfriend who stumble upon a deserted cabin and also upon the Book of the Dead.  Four other characters enter the picture, but it's really a tour de force for Bruce Campbell as Ash in this bloody, outrageously comic take off of horror films.  Utilizing excellent hand held camera work and some gross out effects, EVIL DEAD 2 is a non-stop onslaught of gore and comedy.  Watching Campbell battle his own possessed hand is outrageously brilliant, and Raimi's nod to other great directors like Alfred Hitchcock is marvelous.  Note the visuals when the characters eyes move in different directions at the same time, a device Hitch used in the explosive restaurant scene in THE BIRDS.  This is a marvelous cinematic homage to Hitch.  Don't focus on plot holes or cheesy effects where you can see the set crew in the background.

Evil Dead 2's sardonic tone and Raimi's innovative visual style echo again and again in contemporary films, traversing all genres (Scream series, Chucky, Tarantino, R. Rodriguez, etc).

Its cartoonishness allows for tremendous amounts of gore and violence without coming off as too harsh or overwrought.  Every time a horror convention threatens us with the same old 80's fare, ED2 offers something refreshingly original.

Many have complained about the story, explaining that it is shallow and underwritten. This isn't so. It's written to do one thing: make way for fun, creative wackiness. And it's full of imagination, full of emotion, full of life. Also, in the end, we care for Ash, and want to see more of him. Now is that bad writing? To care for the film's main character?

This film is told not through words from the screenplay, but by the images from the camera.

The ""comedy"" of Evil Dead 2 really is of a certain style, it made me laugh a couple of times -in fact; I found myself laughing more often than I jumped in my seat. It is far overrated as a horror-movie, it's not scary at all -perhaps for its' time though, but compared to the Asian-horror-movies ruling this genre today it is not even to be compared to the ""impact"" of those.

The acting by Bruce Campbell, well, I don't think anyone else cold have been more fit for this character. He has a suitable face, with all the various expressions for all the kinds of crazy happenings taking part of the story behind Evil Dead 2. The other actors, well, they were just there -and that was probably the purpose of their contribution.

The effects; good for its' time? I don't know? Looking fake today anyway, but I understand this was a low-budget-movie. And the bad effects somehow becomes a part of the humour.

3456425,3,B001AOHPXA,"Evil Dead II: Dead by Dawn (Sam Raimi, 1987)

Dead By Dawn is one of those films that makes you ask the question ""remake or sequel?"" over and over again while you're watching it. Raimi has changed the rules a bit from the first film in this one, but kept Ash, leading to the viewer's almost constant confusion.

In this episode, Ash and his girlfriend Linda (Denise Bixler) head up to the cabin that everyone (except, it seems, Ash) remembers from the original film. Ash discovers the book and the tape player, which again, everyone (except, it seems, Ash) will remember, and does exactly what he shouldn't do. With the expected consequences.

Intercut with this are scenes of Annie (Sarah Berry, who would later surface in the lovely CHUD II), the daughter of the guy reading the passages aloud on the tape, who has a vapid boyfriend, a need to get to the cabin, and the other pages of the book, which (conveniently) contain the spell to send the evil back where it came from. Of course, we end up with everyone at the cabin, waiting to become zombie food.

Dead By Dawn is by far the weakest of the three Evil Dead movies, but it's got its own charm; it's kind of The Evil Dead Meet the Three Stooges. It alternates between awful and hysterical. And it didn't have to be awful; it was immediately obvious from the first half-hour of The Evil Dead that Sam Raimi knew a camera lens from a plate of spaghetti, but either a good deal of the comedy here falls flat, or Raimi did portions of this film as a rush job (a quick skim of the list of goofs at IMDB gives the latter impression). It's also, obviously, meant as (perhaps its primary reason for being was) setup for Army of Darkness, a far superior film, and it has a great deal of archival value based on that.

Jason"".

Also recent movies like ""Idle Hands"" are inspired by the ""Evil Dead"" series. Obviously, none of those movies is as satisfying as ""Evil Dead 2: Dead By Dawn"".

Formulaic, yes, but it's a formula that works for auteur Sam Raimi. His comic-book style and the outrageous special FX combine into a hilarious Freudian nightmare that is essential viewing for true genre fans.  (Also a notable ingredient in this garish cinematic concoction is the over-the-top acting style of Bruce Campbell, who reprises his role as antihero Ash.)  In technical terms, it's slicker than the first, but not necessarily better.

The MPAA wanted to slap an ""X"" rating on the film due to the gore and graphic violence, but  the filmmakers decided to release it unrated.  To any reasonable viewer, the gore and violence are so blatantly exaggerated and removed from reality that all genuine emotional content is removed, and this in turn heightens the film's funeral-parlor humor.

Several DVD versions of EVIL DEAD II are out there, but the best ones--usually from Anchor Bay--include filmmaker commentary and other extras.  A must for any serious horror collection.",1103587200,,1519,5.138211382113822
3456437,1,B001AOHPXA,"I hope you'll excuse me for interupting all this fan club drivel with an actual critical review, but this is a horrible movie. Just like most every other movie that has tried to be a horror and a comedy at the same time - it ends up being neither. Although I chuckled a few times, and, I will admit the gore effects were cool at times, since this is primarily supposed to be a horror film, I must point out that there is not a single scary moment in this entire film. I'm sorry but there is just nothing interesting about a severed hand giving it's former owner the middle finger. It's not scary and it's not funny. It's just plain stupid. I mention that scene because it's the perfect metaphor for the entire movie: not scary, not funny, just really stupid.",1100304000,,758,4.345070422535211
3456438,5,B001AOHPXA,"COMMENTS  ABOUT THE  SPECIAL ""BOOK OF THE DEAD""  EDITION:
Jan 2006.
As far as I am aware, there are at least 3 versions of the DVD for EVIL  DEAD 2. Apart from the Very Cool Book look for the special  edition I bought, I have the VHS  tape of the film with the ""Skull""  face on it.
The most amazing plus of this  DVD  is the 5.1 audio, which makes use of all 5 channels  as well as the Sub-Woofer. Up loud, this film is potentially very scarey, and whilst I had obviously noticed the comedic  elements, I had never considered that the comedy might be the raison detre of the film; overall, I still think that the Horror-Comedy tag is correct, since most good Horror films need to be paced, otherwise the film just fails to scare.
The commentary is very revealing. Whilst I have continually enjoyed multiple viewings, I had never noticed the sneak references to other horror icons that the commentary refers  to in the special  feature.
Whilst the Special ""Book"" edition I am referring to in this review is about the unrated  edition, it appears some edited editions, may skip certain items ( like the British Edition).
The Commentary is brilliant, and reveals a great deal, and shows just how much fun the group had in creating this work. I can but wonder if Ted Raimi is perpetually thin thanks to this film, or in spite of it :-).
However you see this film, its a great work, and shows plenty of Sam Raimi's style, and Bruce's agility.
ENJOY.
********************

After watching the film again for the umpteenth time, and hearing the commentary, as well as seeing the ""Making of...""  feature, it is just proof positive that a film by Sam Raimi is great despite faults.
It seems like Sam can run on the sniff of on oily rag, as far as motivation goes, and wow how that takes him a LONG  way.
After doing so much with so little, it is not a surprise that with a larger budget, Raimi can do wonders.
Anyways, check out the making of feature, as well as the commentary... the extras make this a gem on DVD.
This film is great on VHS, but wow is it an awesome gem in this special  edition package.",1099353600,,2095,4.383419689119171
3456439,5,B001AOHPXA,I love this movie so much that I built a chainsaw arm and I'm going as Ash for Halloween!  This movie is completely ridiculous in a totally aswome way!  Basically these two couples are going to this spooky house in the woods where the find the Necromincon(i.e.book of the dead)and invoke powerful evil demons!  The zombies/demons kill everyone except he is most worthy....Ash!  But his hand gets possessed so he HACKS IT OFF!  How could that senario get cooler....lets see....BUILD A CHAINSAW ARM!! OH SWEET JESUS YES! So he gets a shotgun and with his boomstick and chainsaw he renders justice to the dead.  Then a big demon comes and casts him and his ride into an alternate fantasy world.  He renders justice to the dead there as well...but that's another movie.  BUY THIS AND LOVE IT!,1099008000,,788,4.700729927007299
3456440,5,B001AOHPXA,"I don't throw around the word ""masterpiece"" much, nor do I often find myself falling out my chair laughing, but this move is an exception on both accounts.  When this movie was in its theatrical release, I saw fellow theatre patrons literally on the floor laughing --- it was quite remarkable.  This is one of those movies that, when you simply mention it, brings a smile to the face of anyone who has seen it.

It may not be for everyone, since the violence contained therein is almost continual and unrelenting and may get to some viewers after awhile.  I can't imagine the cartoon-like gore having much of an adverse effect on any but the most sensitive viewers.

From a technical standpoint, especially in this era of CGI special effects, this movie is a wonder to look at.  Rarely will you see camera work like this, along with some of the most insane camera angles ever used.  The editing is masterful and contributes wonderfully to the careening lunacy of the film as a whole.  Most of the acting can be charitably described as adequete (although few of us went to this film expecting performances of a Shakespearian nature), but Bruce Campbell gamely tackles what must have been a tremendously grueling role and gives us pretty convincing performance.

This is a hard film to classify.  In the horror genre, a lot of what passes for humor is often simply dialogue laden with really bad puns, and rarely will you find a comedy that contains this level of violence.  ""Evil Dead II"" is pretty much in a category by itself.  All you need to know is that it is hugely enjoyable, even with repeated viewings.",1099008000,,1610,4.65017667844523

Also, I'd have to say the scene where Bruce Campbell fights himself is probably one of the greatest acting achievements of all time and my man should be given a Oscar for it.  It's something that you can watch over and over.  How about that laughing moose head?  Or Ash bending his knees in synch with the 'evil-possessed lamp'?

3456446,4,B001AOHPXA,The sequel to the original Evil Dead kind of takes it in a different direction. This is actually a remake of the original so don't get confused with the beginning of the film. The movie is actually more of a comedy than horror. The acting is alot better than the first one. And Sam Raimi kind of learned from his mistakes from the original. It still has errors but is much better. Evil Dead 2 has less gore than the original but is more entertaining than the orignal. You will enjoy it just as much as the original.

3456447,5,B001AOHPXA,"Before I get to my review, I just want to go on a little rant here: Some of you may have noticed this before, but 'Anchor Bay' has a habit of holding back on the special features. If you listen to the commentary, you'd hear the makers of ED2 talking about several deleted scenes that they were assuming would appear on this DVD, but they are nowhere to be found. Anchor Bay has done the same thing with Hellraiser 2 and the infamous ""surgeon scene"", so I'm beginning to think they have a problem with including deleted scenes. I don't know, I just get the feeling that they could have made this into a jam-packed, two-disc set, but held out for some reason.

I was never a huge fan of the first Evil Dead. It seemed a little bland and cheesy for my liking, but I do respect everyone involved and think they did the best they could have in a tough situation like that (anyone who's read Bruce Campbell's book will know just how difficult it was to make that movie). Evil Dead 2, however, is a whole different ballgame. Unlike the original, this sequel is able to successfully mix a blend of comedy into the equation, all while refraining from being too over-the-top or unbelievable.

""Evil Dead II: Dead By Dawn"" begins with a quick recap of the first one to get viewers up to speed on how this whole thing started. It sounded like an okay idea at first, but most viewer's ended up being confused. For starters, the whole thing has been completely reshot and slightly altered (due to legal reasons, they weren't allowed to use footage from the original). Most people didn't know if this was supposed to be a remake or if Ash was stupid enough to go back to that house (the back of the box says something along the lines of ""After surviving the last encounter, Ash returns to the house to raise the dead once again"", which just created more confusion). This whole thing could have easily been avoided if they just narrated it like they would do in the next sequel, ""Army of Darkness"".

After the first seven minutes or so, we pick up directly where the last one left off. I don't want to give too much of the film away, but lets just say that ED2 includes many of the plot elements that the first one had. Basically, I think ED2 took what the first one did, and improved on it. As always, Bruce Campbell shines in the role of Ash. There's just something about him that makes his actions so entertaining. The rest of the cast isn't anything too special, but that's okay since most people know that the Evil Dead series is all about Ash anyway.

EXTRAS: I mentioned this breifly before, but as far as special editions go, this DVD doesn't have much. The menu is plain-looking and resembles those of other Anchor Bay DVDs like Hellraiser. The commentary is enjoyable and the (somewhat disappointing) ""Making of"" feature is a little interesting. They could have had more interviews with the cast, but I guess it does it's job in telling you about the make-up and various special effects that were used.

Overall, if you enjoy horror movies with a comedic twist, Evil Dead 2 is perfect for you.",1095206400,,3087,4.476021314387212

Watch it, see it, love it. Again and again. In this modern age of CGI effects, Evil Dead II is all the more special for its' low-tech SFX, camera tricks, rubber & latex demon charm. There's just a no-holes-barred charm to this movie that others can't match (like the lame-ass Cabin Fever crapfest which is like contracting a really bad case of Ebola for 90mins).

Accept no substitutes and also check out BUBBA HO-TEP. Bruce Campbell's best performance since Army of Darkness can be found in Don Coscarelli's masterpiece.

I wish Raimi would make an EVIL DEAD IV but I guess now that he's gone all mainstream and everything that will only remain a dream.

I love this movie. Nothing should stop you from seeing it. This is also a great DVD edition to own (until Anchor Bay make us fans shell out for a new super-duper edition some time down the road.)

3456452,4,B001AOHPXA,"Well, we've got a comedy here my friends. Lotsa people like to throw around the term horror-comedy when describing this, but I don't think that's quite appropriate.  While it uses a horror setting, it virtually never seems to be trying to work on a horror movie level, so I'm not really comfortable using the term horror in the description.  On the other hand, calling it a spoof or parody doesn't really decribe it either, as too much of the humor seems to be unrelated to the horror setting.  But, all that aside this is a pretty funny movie, and a rather 'cool' movie as well, for lack of a better term.
Unlike everyone else in the world, this is not my favorite of the series.  In fact, it's my least favorite.  However, it still stands up quite well, and is definitely worth your time.  Despite the fact that it shares the setting of the original, this one has far more in common with Army of Darkness then the original, as it focuses on fast-moving and ridiculous comedic setups.  It's largely a means for Campbell to do physical comedy and ham it up amusingly, and showcase lots of intentionally dated, but still cool special effects.  Sadly, Ash isn't quite as amusing as he'd become in the next film.  He's not nearly as angry/surly as he'd become, which I always thought was more important to humor of the film than the physical comedy. But he's still pretty damn amusing.  Raimi's visual flair is as good here as ever.  The 'force' shots are much improved from the already superb ones in the original.  The famed scene of it endlessly chasing Ash around the cabin is especially noteworthy.  He also does some nice stuff with the sky as well, particuarly a great shot of Ash in front of a ridiculously enormous sun.
The film starts off with a simplified recap of the first film, concluding with Ash's burial of Linda and his being assaulted by 'the force'. The briefly possessed Ash is exorcised by the rising sun, but the bridge is still out, and there is no other apparent means of escape, so he is forced to wait it out in the cabin.  The first half of the movie, before the other characters arrive, is the better part.  Most of the stuff involving Linda is quite amusing, particularly her stop-motion animated dancing out in the moonlight.  The best part, however, has to be the scene where Linda's decapitated head attacks Ash.  It's simple, mindless physical comedy, but his frantically running around trying to smash it off is just great. Probably the best scene in the film. I'm also especially found of how the head just spontaneously falls on him from above, without any explanation of how it could've gotten in the cabin, or up above his head, for that matter.  The stuff with his evil and later severed hand is quite amusing too.  The fact that it is inexplicably talking all the time is the real kicker to the whole set-up.  The laughing house scene is quite cool as well, particuarly the disturbing deer head.  It's not really funny or scary or exciting, but it's very, very weird, and works quite well.
The arrival of the other characters hurts the film a bit, partially because I find some of them to be rather annoying.(Most notably Jake, and, to a lesser extent, his girlfried, Bobbie Joe.)  Of course, I think he's meant to be a bit irritating, but that doesn't really make him much more enjoyable to watch.  Fortunately, he's largely redeemed by an extremely amusing death scene.
Despite not being quite as consistent or energetic as the first half, the second half still delivers.  The fight with Evil Ed is a nice sendup of Shelley's death from the first film, and the final confrontation with Henrietta is delightful.(Film makers really need to use stop-motion animation more often these days)  The fight with the rotten apple head isn't quite as good of a climax as I'd have liked, but it's still pretty decent, and does a good job of raising the stakes in terms of sheer ridiculousness.(particularly when Ash plunges his chainsaw into the creatures eye, and it sprays out hideous blue blood)
A few closing notes.  First of all, as others have mentioned, although the DVD comes with both widescreen and fullscreen, the widescreen version just appears to have the top and bottom matted. (i.e. you see less in the widescreen version, not more) Since the Anchor Bay release comes with both it's not much of a concern, but it's good to know.  Secondly, this movie has a reputation for being very gory, which is not exactly deserved.  It's just too ridiculous to even be desribed as being gory in the conventional sense, as it generally uses ultra fake blood that isn't even red,(with either incredibly thick or incredibly water texture) and silly, incredibly plastery limbs.(That, and there just isn't all that much gore in it anyway) To say this is very gory is like saying that old Warner Brothers cartoons are very violent. You're technically correct, but you probably give completely the wrong impression to someone who's never seen the piece your talking about.
Anyways, this is good. Check it out.",1086566400,,5033,4.7015945330296125

3456454,5,B001AOHPXA,"Evil Dead 2 is not just another low budget horror movie.  It is a singular experience.  There is no other movie like it.  If it were not for Peter Jackson's Dead Alive, a very different movie of the same genre, I would say that it is, by far, the best horror/comedy ever made.  I hate saying horror/comedy, but I guess it fits.
The story is simple:  Ashe and his girlfriend Linda take a trip out to, what he has assessed To be an abandoned cottage in the woods.  After a little cagey chit chat, Ashe discovers a tape recorder and decides to play the tape.  On the tape are ancient incantations from the ""Sumerian Book of the Dead"" that, once again, awaken a demon inhabiting the very woods surrounding them.  The demon possesses Linda and the fun is underway.  The movie never lets up from here on out.
The production is amazing.  One of the best aspects of the movie is the combined use of sound effects, cinematography, and editing in such a way that they compliment each other and become, in effect, one effect (excuse the silly redundancy.)  The jarring sounds, mixed with the equally jarring angles and lens usage, together with the tight editing makes for a movie that moves along like wildfire.

3456456,5,B001AOHPXA,"While the first Evil Dead was good, it lacked something, and Army of Darkness (sometimes referred to as Evil Dead III) had the most money, Evil Dead II is a comfortable medium. It has the best black humor of the series and is just cheap enough to work as a lovable ""Hey guys let's see what we can do with what we have"" movie. This film will always have a special place in my heart. I saw it with my best friend at the time way back in '87 at the theater. We both loved it. Shortly after that, he ran away from home and I never saw him again.
For those who love some humor with their horror, this is a perfect film. Bruce Campbell is loved by his fans, and he appreciates what he is. A B-movie actor who loves what he does. Who couldn't like a guy like that. His timing is perfect and as Ash he's a character many can relate too. I mean c'mon who else in Hollywood can play a guy with a possessed hand and beat the crap out of himself.
This DVD has an outstanding behind the scenes making that is as entertaining as the film itself. It looks like so much fun, the average Joe would want to pick up his camera and make a movie with his buddies.
Though the extras show the tribute to Freddy Krueger in the shed, (right above and center to the door on the inside), his glove appears in one other scene. When Ash is in the celler to get the pages, there's one shot of the door he has to open and go through. On the left Freddy's glove hangs again.
ALso no one mentioned it, but when Demon Ash throws the professor's daughter against the wall and is about to kill her, he turns back into normal Ash atthe sight of his dead girlfriend's necklace. Check out the chain before he picks it up. Someone placed it in the shape of a skull.

If you have never seen this movie, my best suggestion is that you also see Army of Darkness right after. Although the two movies are very different, they are similiar comedy wise and it finishes the story. ***Don't see this movie if you are faint of heart and have a problem watching blood and gore.",1075420800,,584,4.36697247706422
3456460,5,B001AOHPXA,"I can only imagine what fans of the original cult classic, THE EVIL DEAD, thought when they watched EVIL DEAD II. Its predecessor was an eerie gorefest designed for one sole purpose: to scare the living hell out of the audience. That said, EVIL DEAD II is a completely different film. In fact, it has much more in common with a Three Stooges sketch than it does with films like THE TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE or A NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET.

The film opens with a re-hash of the first film: young Ash (Bruce Campbell) and his girlfriend Linda (Denise Bixler) travel to an abandoned cabin in the woods of Michigan. There Ash unwittingly unleashes an evil force which has been lying dormant in the forest - a force which likes to possess human flesh and torment the living. After decapitating his possessed girlfriend with a shovel, Ash struggles to maintain his sanity and ward off the evil force; things become a little more complicated with a group of strangers, led by the daughter of the cabin's original owner (Sarah Berry), wind up fighting for their lives alongside Ash.

I was blown away by EVIL DEAD II the first time I watched it. It was after watching it that I came to appreciate just how great a horror film could be. As I've said before, EVIL DEAD II isn't traditional horror. It's horror-tinged slapstick comedy, in the vein of the Three Stooges (of which director/co-writer Sam Raimi and star Bruce Campbell are huge fans). There's some wonderfully over-the-top stuff in this film, thanks to a wacky script by Sam Raimi and Scott Spiegel and some kooky special effects by Mark Shostrom. Joseph LoDuca's score perfectly captures the glumness of Ash's situation, while also capturing the tongue-in-cheek feeling of the film.

To me, the greatest point of the film is the camera work. There is some spectacular camera work here: wide shots, distorted close-ups, forty-five degree angles, a point-of-view shot from an eyeball (!). The best camera work in the film occurs through the point-of-view of the evil force (whose form, in a clever move, we never see). The force - and the audience - flies through the forest towards the cabin. It breaks down the door and proceeds to chase Ash through every single room of the house, around winding corners and through doors. It's simply brilliant.

While most of the acting is less-than-spectacular, Bruce Campbell's performance is classic. It's no surprise that Campbell is viewed as God by his fans. He is hilarious as Ash, portraying him as a not-so-clever sap with some sharp one-liners. Although Ash (and Campbell) is at his finest in the third EVIL DEAD film - the cult hit ARMY OF DARKNESS - Ash undoubtedly has his moments in this film. Campbell does some wonderful stuff when Ash's hand becomes possessed by the evil. The hand, now with an (evil) mind of its own, decides to torture Ash by smashing kitchenware over his head and making him do some pretty amazing stunts. Finally, in one of the most famous scenes in horror film history, Ash takes care of the hand ...

It's no surprise that EVIL DEAD II is the cult legend that it is. It is certainly one of the very finest horror films I've ever seen, and it has been one of my very favorite films since I first saw it. It's a masterpiece, a major improvement over its predecessor. From the fast-paced beginning to the magnificent ending (which sets up the third film), it's a wacky, hilarious ride that no horror fan can miss. Highly recommended.",1074556800,,3456,4.724709784411277
3456461,5,B001AOHPXA,"There are many reasons why this one is rated as the greatest Bruce Campbell film and the finest film that director Sam Raimi (Spider-man) has done to date. First of all the cinematography in this movie is hands down one of the best you will ever see for a film of its type because the camera swirls around the place as if attached to an anti-gravity device. The next is the outstanding acting ability of Mr. Campbell as he literally holds the screen by himself for the vast majority of this fun horror movie. One of the most notable scenes in this picture is Mr. Campbell beating up himself on the screen. It is downright hysterical and looks brutally real (because it is!). There is no doubt that this guy will do anything to please the audience and there is also no doubt that the director just loves to torture him. ""Mr. Cambell, do you mind while I strap you to a plank of wood and then drive you at top speed through the bushes and trees while you spin around on its axis?"" .... ""Hell yeah, sure Mr. Raimi. Whatever you say. I just love being in your pictures.""
It is too hard to put down a single shot or scene in this movie as that which defines it. The whole thing from start to finish is just a fury of action that doesn't stop. This is also one of the best character build-ups in the history of cinema. At the start Ash (Bruce Campbell) is a sort of frightened scared little pissy-pants but by the end of the movie he is a fully fledged action hero with some wicked one-liners to boot. This film has some of the most memorable quotes in modern cinema.
Evil Dead II is largely a remake to the first Evil Dead movie but is also a sequel or can work as a stand alone vehicle. The premise is simple. Ash heads to a log cabin in the woods with his girlfriend and manages to wakeup the undead who turn his world, and cabin, upside down. There are things in the cellar, things in the woods and a chainsaw in the workshop.
There is no other film that moves at such pace and speed except maybe Black Hawk Down. Here Raimi conjures up scene by scene mayhem on a larger budget than his previous efforts and just keeps up the velocity relentlessly. It is no wonder why this film tops many fanboy polls as the greatest flick of all time.
In short you will be hard pressed to find a horror film with more action in it than Evil Dead II except for maybe Aliens, but then that is more of a Sci-Fi movie. If you have not seen Evil Dead II then it is about time that you did. This movie is a riot and is deserving of its everlasting repeating viewing appeal (And believe me fans do watch this one a couple of times a month).
One of the greatest shames in Cinema is that Hollywood has not been able to utilize or realize one of the finest B-movie actors of our generation. Maybe with Mr. Raimi picking up momentum there we just might get to see his lead star do more for the box office.
An essential for any horror/action fans collection.",1073433600,,2929,4.222816399286987
3456462,4,B001AOHPXA,"Although there is a lot in this film that doesn't make sense, it's a great remake of the orginal Evil Dead (yes, it's a remake, not a sequel).  I think Raimi could have tempered himself a bit with the f/x sequences, as some are a bit overdone. It seems like he was interested in using every bit of his budget, regardless of whether a scene needed it or not.  But it does make for an entertaining piece. Campbell's performance is brilliant.",1072396800,,439,4.407407407407407
3456463,5,B001AOHPXA,"Since its release in 1987, writer/director Sam Raimi's Evil Dead 2 has garnered somewhat of a cult following among horror enthusiasts.  Notable for its inventive camera shots, campy humor and over-the-top gore, this film is not for the faint of heart, or anyone with an aversion to slapstick humor.
 Much like the first film, this semi-sequel (the basic plot mirrors that of the first film) begins with Ash (Bruce Campbell), who is on his way to a secluded cabin in the woods with his girlfriend Linda (Denise Bixler).  However, things soon go awry as a nondescript demon takes Linda and transforms her into the walking dead.  After fending off his former lover, Ash discovers that an ancient book was unearthed by an archaeologist who lived in the cabin, and, upon translating the book, an evil spirit with an insatiable thirst for blood and carnage was unleashed.  Now, Ash must fight to protect his life, as well as his sanity.
 As a horror film, Evil Dead 2 succeeds on many levels.  First of all, the setting, an isolated cabin, adds palpable tension as Ash struggles to combat the creatures that lurk in the night.  The audience is made to feel as claustrophobic as he must, running from small room to small room, never quite knowing what will pop out next.  When Ash ventures into the woods, the anxiety ratchets up even further, since everyone knows that darkness acts as a blanket for the evil that lurks just beyond the shadows.
 Raimi is a virtuoso behind the camera, with skewed perspectives, strange point-of-view shots (like a flying, severed eyeball) and crane shots so manic and wild you could mistake the film for a cartoon.  Upside down, diagonal- the camera seems to be able to move anywhere, and the variety of shots adds a considerable amount of unpredictability and energy to the film.  Raimi is very playful, very enthusiastic, and he does not hesitate to let these qualities bleed into his work.
 Like Raimi, Campbell is a fan of the Three Stooges, and fast-paced, slapstick comedy in general.  And as he proves in a very funny kitchen scene, Cambell is very adept when it comes to physical comedy.  He can make you laugh while you simultaneously wince or simply stare in awe at the amount of viscera that soaks this film.  The insane and often unexpected bits of humor, combined with Cambell's delightful overacting (he is often called the greatest B movie actor of all time) lend the film a unique aspect that makes it seem fresher that many of the ho-hum copycat slasher films that are released today.
 Or maybe that freshness simply comes from all the blood of various colors that is being tossed around.  On multiple occasions, the death of a character or severing of a limb result in a startlingly gratuitous spray of blood, which is by turns red, green, blue... a veritable cornucopia of vital juices.  Due to its excessiveness, Raimi and the rest of the crew decided to purposely alter the color of the blood at certain points, offsetting the seriousness of the situation.  It works, despite the fact that your jaw will still drop at a few of the more...body-drenching scenes (don't get too close to that hole in the wall...).
 Overall, Evil Dead 2 presents a fresh, interesting and frequently entertaining look at a genre that has recently gotten stale and seemingly refuses to make any progress.  However, if you yearn for the old days, with lower-than-low budgets and improvisational actors, this film is right up your alley.  Fans of the Three Stooges or slapstick comedies such as The Naked Gun will surely be amused by it, and anyone whose thirst wasn't sated in gorefests like Peter Jackson's Bad Taste and Dead Alive will find themselves adequately satisfied.  Fans of quality horror films with copious surprises and thrills need look no further.  As an exemplary...example of a horror films, I give Evil Dead 2 &#61514;&#61514;&#61514;&#61514;, the highest rating possible.

Pieces of paper don't scatter themselves all over the basement.  Scary ghosts aren't eager to help you out.  People tend to bleed after they dismember themselves.  Dead body parts don't make squeaky noises.  Having a little lightbulb smashed over your head doesn't render you unconscious.  People don't punch monsters with their fist when they have a chainsaw in the other hand.  Using ""big"" words in your movie doesn't make you any smarter...  The list goes on and on.

3456467,3,B001AOHPXA,"Not really a sequel. ""Evil Dean 2: Dead by Dawn"" is just a remake of the original with better effects, better picture and sound.

Ash (Bruce Campbell) and his girlfriend accidentally stumble upon a voice recording that voices passages from ""The Book of the Dead"", unleashing ferocious forest demons that pretty much possess anyone in sight. There is a lot of senseless violence, over-the-top gore (and acting) and an absolutely ridiculous climax.

A completely over-rated, pointless (it is not a sequel but a remake of the original) and utterly annoying movie (far too much slapstick humour). I must admit, I really liked the original because, although it was a much lower-budgeted production, it was genuinely scary in parts, the rape scene is still shocking even after all of these years. The sequel is as scary as an episode of ""The Muppet Show"". However let me point out the films good points. As previously mentioned, this film has a much higher budget than it's predecessor and it's evident in the effects (which may please some) but sometimes bigger is not always better. The original had excellent and frightening make-up effects and used, sometimes, unsuccessfully, claymation effects that were somewhat creative. The demons in ""Evil Dead 2"" look rubbery and fake. Bruce Campbell's performance is pretty much the only reason I recommend the film. He is a great performer and some of his slapstick routines and facial expressions are extraordinary- especially during the ""possessed"" hand sequence. But like many reviewers pointed out, this film is more of a comedy than a horror piece. A comedy with buckets of blood and ooze thrown in.

So for true horror movie fans, if you want some genuine chills, skip this one and view the original. Despite the budget restraints, it's a much more effective and satisfying shocker. The only genuine emotions that will be aroused by this film is genuine disappointment. Not only for wasting your time watching it but also for wasting your heard earned cash buying it.

NOTE: I originally wrote this review a decade ago in 2003- it is now 2013, and I must have been having a really bad hair day or maybe I had not had my morning coffee, or maybe I was just being a bitter fool, ... just trying to explain the horrible review I gave this film. Although I still think it is a tad over-rated, I do not think it is the horrible mess from my original review so I have revised my rating from 1 star to 3.5 since I have re-watched this film, a lot, and have grown quite fond of it. Taste's change I guess... but my low opinion of ""Phantasm""? Well that still stands. Cheers.",1067040000,,2611,4.757174392935982
3456468,5,B001AOHPXA,without a doubt this one is way better than the original. more funny gags and gore galore. the funniest sequence would be at the beginning when Campbell is hit sky high then lands in the puddle and he shakes the demon out of him. then later on hes chased back to the cabin and all threw the house. just great. and the laughing deer head kicks ass too. a must see for anyone,1066089600,,373,4.123287671232877
3456469,5,B001AOHPXA,"The Evil Dead trilogy is unique in the fact that it is one of those rare series where a movie's sequels prove to be more popular than the original. Often when you hear a fan quote something from the Evil Dead franchise, they're picking out a line from Evil Dead 2 or 3 (a.k.a. Army of Darkness).
If you know anything about the film, you know that Evil Dead 2 isn't really a sequel; it's more of a rehash of the original with Bruce Campbell playing the hapless chump, Ash, who accidentally unleashes a horde of demonic spirits out in the woods. The demons possess his girlfriend, try to kill him, and attempt to possess Ash himself. Meanwhile, a seperate group of college students (going to the cabin to visit some relatives who have discovered the Book of the Dead) and rednecks (leading the way since the bridge is out)  appear only to find Ash and all hell broken loose.
This go-round, Raimi and company inject a healthy dose of slapstick humor into the world of the Evil Dead. No other leading man has endured as much punishment as Bruce Campbell in Evil Dead 2 or its follow-up. The demons don't so much as kill him as beat him senseless, time and time again. In fact, rather than kill him, the evil spirits have more fun just possessing Bruce's hand and forcing him to smash a stack of dishes over his own head. His girlfriend's head pops up just to chew on his fingers. In short, Ash has a bad night.
The Evil Dead in this movie definitely have a sense of fun. A flying eyeball lands in the mouth of a screaming female. A ghoulish woman creeps about in the fruit cellar, and the deer head mounted on the wall laughs at Bruce's misfortunes with an eerie glee.
Needless to say, Evil Dead 2 is zanier and more over the top than Raimi's low-budget original. Sure, there are decapitations and death. Sure, there are dismemberments. However with tongue-planted-firmly-in-cheek, Raimi's manic energy behind the camera is as entertaining as ever. The camera chases Ash through every room of the cabin. The camera smacks against Ash and follows him as he goes soaring through the trees and lands head-first into a mud puddle. The camera goes just about everywhere and anywhere Raimi wants it to, often in places where you least expect.
Bruce Campbell falls into classic-Ash mode in this film, particularly near the end when he decides to face the evil head on. Hard to fight evil with only one hand? Well, stick a chainsaw in its place, and Ash is ready to roll. How does Ash prepare himself to go against the forces of evil? What words of wisdom does he have? ""Groovy.""
Evil Dead 2 cemented Raimi's reputation as a cult favorite and as a director with an eye for visual excitement. Bruce Campbell still enjoys a heathly cult fan base, due mostly for this role. If you're looking for some silly, mindless horror fun, this is your film.
Evil Dead 2 comes with a decent amount of extras. As always, Raimi and Campbell put together a very informative and entertaining commentary track. There's also a featurette entitled ""The Gore the Merrier."" You can view the film in either widescreen or full frame, and it's much, much prettier than that old VHS copy your videostore still carries.

3456479,5,B001AOHPXA,"Evil Dead II isn't horror movie.

It's not scary because you get to see there's often no ceilings on the set dressings.  Ted Raimi's costume comes apart in the finale.  The prosthetics are shiny as plastic.  The blood comes in just about every color EXCEPT red.  And Ash is too cheer inducing to really feel any fear.  While made on a limited budget, Evil Dead II is essentially the biggest budget movie of a bunch of friends messing around with a camera and fake blood.  How is that not awesome?

I don't know how many times I've seen Evil Dead II, but it never gets old.  There's a real sense of creativity among all the rough effects and missing set panels.  The blistering trademark Raimi editing and camera work may have never before or since seen so much invention.  It's really easy to make a mean spirited story about a bunch of teenagers getting mauled to pieces out in the woods.  No matter how graphic you could make the violence, it's just been done to death, so to speak.  Adding in the three stooges touch and Bruce's hilarious ""reverse motion acting"" makes this movie what it is - a labor of love and fun.

Evil Dead II is the epitome of what's missing in nearly every ""horror"" film made in the past 70 years:  heart.  I've never seen a movie where you root so hard for the main character and jump on for the ride of what was obviously a lot of fun for the people behind the camera.  While Evil Dead 1 is darker and Army of Darkness is funnier, Evil Dead II hits a mix no other movie has ever been able to get close to.

This is a FUN movie, not oen that you really have to think about too much.  I HIGHLY recommend it.",1050364800,,534,4.29
3456482,5,B001AOHPXA,"It's about time I wrote a review for this movie.  It's one of my favorite films of all time; part 2 of the violent, scary and often hilarious Evil Dead trilogy.  I guess I just didn't know what to write.  I have read many reviews of this film from fans who insist that it isn't a remake of the first film in the series, and I am about as big an Evil Dead fan as they come, but this films has too much in common with the first to be considered a sequel.
  That is not to say in the least, however, that Evil Dead 2: Dead By Dawn is not equally as good a movie as the other two in the series.  Infact, many people believe that it is superior to The Evil Dead and Army of Darkness.  I like them all the same, and don't feel they should be compared because, whether or not Evil Dead 2 is a remake of the first, they are all their own film.
  Regardless of whether or not Evil Dead 2 is a sequel or not, it starts off with Ash (our hero) returning to the doomed cabin he barely escaped in the first film and there is no explanation for this.  So, in that respect, it is a sequel.  Many of the same events from the first movie occur, although are done a bit differently, and instead of teens we have a new cast of characters.  Director Sam Raimi obviously knew what kind of movie he was making, and made the story the way he did fro a reason.  The same sort of thing happens in the beginning of Army of Darkness; there is a change in the story, and the ending of Evil Dead 2.
  But anyway, instead of straightforward gory horror, Evil Dead 2 starts to shift towards slapstick, gross-out comedy, which the series perfects with Army of Darkness.  When Bruce Campbell battles himself in the kitchen it is a moment of true physical acting mastery.
  Like all of Sam Raimi's older films, he is not afraid to use cheesy special effects if it means getting the shot he's after, and this shows in Evil Dead 2, (although the effects weren't that cheesy when the movie was originally released.)
  Anyway, it's a must for horror fans.  Very funny.",1049068800,,2030,4.167095115681234
3456483,5,B001AOHPXA,"This is one of my all time favorite movies. The combo of gore and comedy is great. If you're a fan of movies like Re-Animator or Street Trash, you need this in your collection. I actually like this better than Evil Dead. For a sequel, I say this is one of the best ones I've ever come across. The effects and story are incredible and this is one of the movies I can never get sick of. Its not your basic Zombie or Living Dead movie, but its one with a twist. For any horror fan, this is a must.",1046044800,,494,3.95
3456484,4,B001AOHPXA,"The second movie in the `Evil Dead' series is a somewhat more polished, sophisticated follow-up to the original `Evil Dead' with a sense of humor thrown in for good measure. (I must add a caveat to that last statement; if the humor potential of seeing the main character amputate one of his own hands with a chainsaw, then watching it crawl across the room on its own to give him the finger evades you perhaps you should skip this title. You don't watch a movie like this to follow the permutations and subtle unfolding of the plot.)
Similar to `Halloween II', this film starts on the same night the previous one ended. The opening moments are a bit of revisionist history with only the main character, Ash (Bruce Campbell) and his girlfriend at the haunted cabin instead of the group of five in the first film. Not to worry; the girlfriend is quickly dispatched, clearing the way for a whole new quartet of cannon fodder.
What happens after that is fairly predictable. The dead are evil, and manifest their evilness by trying to make the living into more of the dead. They are, in a sense, only doing what comes naturally. That this involves dismemberment, as well as the oozing and spewing of substances of varying levels of viscosity is merely incidental.
What makes this appealing is the sheer gusto of the filmmaking. Mr. Campbell and director Sam Raimi are old high school buddies, and the enthusiasm of people getting to do something they've wanted to do and talked about doing for years comes through. They are shots and sequences in the movie that only happen when the people making the movie are going at it with ambition and energy.
If you enjoy this genre, this is a title you want on your shelf. The commentary tracks are excellent bonus features, especially if Mr. Campbell cracks you up.",1045699200,,1802,4.669811320754717
3456485,5,B001AOHPXA,"The film is a cinematic masterpiece, it's so funny, scary, violent, and soundtrack is so sweet! This first one is the scariest, but the sequel is far funnier. It has some scares in it, but this has a lot of humor in it. It's dark humor, but it is funny. This is not as good as Army of Darkness though. Army of Darkness is the funniest in the series. See the first one, then this one, and also check out Army of Darkness.",1045612800,,420,4.072289156626506
3456486,5,B001AOHPXA,"Its nice to see a comedy with such wonderful pacing. The movie just keeps going and going. I never wanted it to end. Both the first and second films were hilarious, but humor wasn't the first films intention. I've always liked Bruce Campbell and this is where he shines brightest. Nothing can top the chainsaw, the sawed off shotgun, and how its summed up by one word: ""groovy""",1045440000,,377,4.5588235294117645
3456487,5,B001AOHPXA,"Finally, someone made a sequel that was better than the first movie! People always make the case that this is simply 'Evil Dead' redone on a better budget; but while the plots are consistent in some instances, 'Evil Dead' was never as good a film as either of the sequels it spawned. Indeed, this is a sequel to the first film with notable differences. Saying 'Evil Dead 2' is a remake is akin to saying 'Evil Dead' is a remake of 'Night of the Living Dead'.
The plot is familiar; several people caught in a secluded house surrounded by the undead. What does make this film different from other such films with similar plot and budget is the humorous slapstick fashion intermixed with some truly surprising and uncomfortable moments. The special effects in both movies set them apart from peers. 'Evil Dead', on the other hand, added no notably new elements to the horror genre. 'Evil Dead 2' does indeed add more to the genre, and should be in any horror collection that includes films made after 'Exorcist'. If this isn't in your collection; you don't have a collection.",1043884800,,1072,4.677248677248677
3456488,5,B001AOHPXA,"Not a remake but a sequel, ""Evil Dead 2"" picks up Ash right where we left him: hit by the dark force of the woods at the break of dawn. Now he and a new group of victims (the owners of the house, no less) have to find a way to send the evil in the forest back where it came from. This second installment of the Evil Dead series is superior to the original in many ways, but it's also a very different kind of movie. It has less scares and more fun, and a sense of absurd that holds no punches. One thing is for sure: this special edition is top-quality stuff, and worthy of the two excellent editions they made for the original.
The video quality is superb, with a nice, solid image that maintains the colors very rich. Blacks are black, and all the different ""blood"" colors are saturated and with deep contrast. Also, unlike the first movie, this time ""Evil Dead 2"" comes both in widescreen and fullscreen format. The sound is also very good, specially the THX remastered soundtrack that, although it may be a little too ""loud"", still remains the best sound quality I've ever seen in an Evil Dead DVD. Sadly, no subtitles, but at least they didn't forget the close-captions for this edition.
The extras include bios and filmographies for Sam Raimi and Bruce Campbell, as well as the theatrical trailer, a preview for the ""Evil Dead"" Playstation game, still images and, best of all, a 30-documentary called ""The Gore the Merrier"", hosted by the special effects crew, who pretty much make fun of the whole making-of process while they proceed to point out mistakes seen during the movie.
I've saved the best for last. I'm talking about the EXCELLENT commentary track by Sam Raimi, Bruce Campbell and Greg Nicotero. This has to be one of the most informative and entertaining commentaries I've ever heard in my life. Bruce Campbell had already done this solo with his commentary for the Special Edition of ""Evil Dead"", but this time, riding alongside Sam Raimi, he is even funnier. The both of them soon take over, though Nicotero obviously has the upper hand when it comes to the special effects. This commentary track alone is worth the price of the edition.
Personally, if you loved the first one, you can't go wrong with ""Evil Dead 2"". Fortunately, Anchor Bay has not tried to milk it for everything it's worth (see such case in ""Army of Darkness""), so this edition should satisfy all deadite fans.",1043884800,,2400,4.583720930232558
3456489,5,B001AOHPXA,"A mixture of comedy and horror. The concept is scary and the scenes are hilarious. I own all three evil dead movies, but this one is my favorite. Directed by the same guy who directed Spiderman, Sam Raimi.",1042761600,,205,4.421052631578948
3456490,5,B001AOHPXA,"Okay...to clear it up.  ""Evil Dead 2"" is a SEQUEL...not a remake.  The first part of the film is a recap to get you up to speed on what happened in the first movie.  The story is simplified (this time only Ash and Linda go to the cabin...no sister, no other friends) in order to fit the constraints of a quick recap without losing the audience.  And it works just fine.  I wonder why no one ever mentions that the exact same thing happens at the beginning of ""Army of Darkness"" when it recaps both of the previous movies.  Also, it's odd that people think this is a different Linda.  Sure, it's a different actress...but who cares?  I mean, Bridget Fonda played the same part in ""AoD""...so what?  Oh well, no matter.  What matters is that this is a sequel, even if it does have a slight case of amnesia when it comes to certain facts portrayed in the first movie.
Now, with that out of the way...time for the actual review.  I'd say that this is the best entry in the series, without doubt.  Hilarious, surreal, and very violent, it's exactly what a horror-comedy should be.  My only problem with it is the green slime that spurts out of dismembered demons.  I much preferred the sickeningly realistic blood in the first ""Evil Dead"" movie.  I guess that this time around, Sam was looking to get an R-rating...so he figured that too much SLIME wouldn't get him an ""X""...which, at the time, was still a rating...and one that an overenormity of blood could land a feature film.  This was, after all, still in the days before the ""NC-17"" rating.
So, slime instead of blood...my only complaint.  Though there is still a great deal of blood in this movie...particularly when Ash removes his right hand with a chainsaw.  This is one of many incredible sights that you'll be treated to when watching ""Evil Dead 2""...check it out.  It's one of the few horror flicks out there that get the full 5-star rating from me.  ""Evil Dead 2"" is indespensible, and a truly unique film.  You'll never see anything else quite like it.",1040947200,,2012,4.518005540166205
3456491,5,B001AOHPXA,"Ok, this movie is a little over the top, but... you've got to see it! The bonus with all the Evil Dead movies is the commentary! OMG they're so dang funny!

3456492,5,B001AOHPXA,"Alright, you needa know somethin' first off.  'Evil Dead 2' is a hit-or-miss affair an' thas' all there is to it; you're either gonna love it for it's humor and gore, or you're gonna hate it for it's humor and gore.  My thinking is that anyone who is a REAL fan of movies, an' that recognizes that we watch movies first and foremost, for entertainment, will more than likely enjoy this.  And I happen to be one'a the latter so I jus' enjoy the hell outta this flick, an' always have.  'Evil Dead 2' took the original to a whole 'nother level completely, an' solidified it as a cult series with a loyal legion of followers.
Okay, okay, so the amount of bloodshed an' the relentlessness of the violence has been toned down a bit, but thas' to make way for some over-the-top humor and to help truly shape Bruce Campbell's Ash character into the chainsaw-weilding, shotgun-blasting, ultra-cool, and ultra-CHEESY superhero that we all know an' love.  With this sequel, the filmmakers pulled out all the stops.  They took their shoestring budget, cut a few corners, pulled off a few miracles, an' created what is, in my opinion, one'a the best an' most influential movies of the '80s.
Picking up right where the first 'Evil Dead' left off (after a brief rehashing of how this mess began, with a few inaccurate details), this one gets going right away, as Ash, still holed up in the cabin deep in the woods, struggles to defend himself against an ever-growing legion of demonic spirits, while also trying to maintain a grip on his own sanity.  He watches his decapitated girlfriend's corpse rise from her grave an' do a ballet dance, he has a conversation with his own reflection in the mirror (""We jus' cut up our girlfriend with a chainsaw... does that sound FINE!?""), then winds up in a murderous brawl with his own hand.  And if that isn't crazy enough, a group of outsiders are on their way to the cabin as all this is happening hoping to translate the lettering in the Book of the Dead.  Too late, huh?
With an even more clever and fun script than the original, 'Evil Dead 2' will keep you hanging on every word, even when you 'bout to split your side laughing.  Some real interesting revelations come to light regarding Ash an' why he's involved in this, but I don't wanna give it away for those who ain't seen it.  I'll jus' say this; it's no coincidence that Ash has survived this long an' seems to be the lone warrior waging this battle against these bloodthirsty zombies an' demons.  Outside of the story, director Sam Raimi's camerawork is a masterwork in itself, an' you can see how his stylistic approach was quickly developing an' becoming more an' more professional between the first two movies.
Anchor Bay gave the DVD special edition of this movie a terrific treatment, the best part of which is the audio commentary from Sam Raimi, Bruce Campbell, co-writer Scott Spiegel and special make-up effects artist Greg Nicotero.  Now THESE guys know how to make a voice-over interesting an' know how to make you actually WANT to hear it all the way through, because instead'a boring you with mundane details, they entertain you with their camaraderie, their ridiculous on-the-set stories, an' their constant blame placing.  These are not uptight stiffs, these are a bunch'a guys who grew up with working-class families, that were lucky enough to stumble into the world of motion pictures, because they have a real, pure an' unabashed LOVE for cinema.  The featurette 'The Gore the Merrier' is also pretty interesting, if only for the home videos that were taken on the set during filming, an' the theatrical trailer is great.  Even in advertising for the movie, they made it seem like it was a major '80s blockbuster.  There's also a preview for the 'Evil Dead: Hail to the King' video game, as well as a few still galleries, taken from the filmmakers' private collection.  For once, I can happily say that I wasn't at all disappointed by this DVD's extras.
Of the whole series, I think 'Evil Dead 2' is, by an' large, the best and most entertaining on a horror movie scale.  In fact, y'know what?  I think it's one'a the best sequels EVER made in the history of modern cinema.  It stayed on the level of the original so's to satisfy fans' bloodlust, but it also added some outrageous humor to the mix, an' created one'a the most memorable icons in recent years with Ash.  Well, anyways, don't stop now.  Ya' better go 'head an' pick up 'Army of Darkness' so you can find out what happens to our hero Ash in his seemingly-never ending battle against demonic zombies, rising corpses, an', um, his severed right hand.",1038355200,,4620,4.66256157635468
3456493,5,B001AOHPXA,"Being a teenager and into horror movies in the 80's was great. You had 'Dawn of the Dead/Day of the Dead' etc. from Romero, early 'Friday the 13th' movies and plenty of great older flicks like 'The Texas Chainsaw Massacre'.
The beauty was that, in those days, the special effects were more like works of art.. tactile ones. Not always good ones.. and certainly not general admission - but they were great for their time. CGI wasn't readily available in those days.. so when you saw 10 gallons of blood - it WAS 10 gallons of real fluid.. not some souped-up Amiga 3000 Video Toaster shot.
Anyway - back then Raimi ruled the schlock horror genre with this one and Bruce was/is one of the best the B-Movie leads ever - great delivery of his cheesy Arnold-esque one liners.
Check it out if you like tounge-in-cheek and horror. It's not unintentionally funny like say 'Bloodfeast' or over-the-top stupid like say 'The Toxic Avenger' .. just a fun and well done horror film.",1036713600,,968,4.633720930232558
3456494,5,B001AOHPXA,"The movie itself is great, a wonderful blend of the innovative special effects that made The Evil Dead such a great movie and comic stunts that show up again in Army of Darkness, making this film a bridge between two extremes.
The video and audio are as good as they'll ever be, I get such a kick out of the THX logo popping up after only seeing it on Star Wars VHS's.  The extras seem slim at first, but after going through them, you realize they're all you need, and then some stuff you don't really care about, like the comercial for the computer game.  But the rest is great.  The commentary with Campbell, Raimi and crew was fantastic.  The 'making of' featurette was really good, I'm so glad someone on set had a camcorder.
After going through this DVD you will gain a true understanding of how it was made, and how everyone felt in making it, which is a rare thing in DVD's, even with big budget films that release DVD's that have next to nothing on them.",1036540800,,962,4.3277777777777775

This film never takes it-elf seriously... it is meant to be scary and funny, much like several of John Landis's pictures (I.E. American Werewolf in London). What I enjoyed about this picture, besides the creative camera work and the tremendous physical acting by Bruce Campbell (his ""evil hand"" scene blows Jim Carrey out of the water) is that Raimi chose to let Ash be the main character, rather than have it be some stupid guy in a hockey mask chop up dozens of kids having sex. You get to spend time with Ash and root for him.",1035849600,,666,4.379032258064516
3456496,5,B001AOHPXA,"MAJOR SPOILERS, but clarifications:
The first 15 minutes of Evil Dead 2 are a quick recap (with slightly different details) of the events of Evil Dead 1.  The original Evil Dead are the events of going to the cabin, all 5 teenagers included.  It is a longer version of the 1st 15 mins of Evil Dead 2.  After Ash gets chased out of the house (end of part 1 and end of 1st 15 mins of part 2) the sequal begins.  Brand new material on the next day after the events of Evil Dead 1.  The writing is brilliant.  Great movies.  :)
So if you wanted to watch the complete tale (like you would with the Star Wars Trilogy) watch Evil Dead 1.  The end of Evil Dead 1 could be treated as an intermission for the viewer.  Then put in Evil Dead 2 and fast-forward to where Ash runs out of the house (you'll notice it to be the exact same screen-shot as the end of part 1).  Watch from that point on (right where ash gets tossed back through forest, hits tree, etc.).  :)",1035331200,,955,4.080645161290323
3456497,5,B001AOHPXA,"Yes it's a remake,for the first ten minutes and then it's all new. Ash(Bruce Campbell)and Linda(Denise Bixler)return to the cabin in the woods,read from the necronomicon and then all hell brakes loose,then four more new people show up to join the fun. Evil Dead 2 DBD is not as gory as the first one,but it's way more funny,it's like watching a 90 minute Three Stooges episode. The DVD is a total getter for any Evil Dead fan or movie fans in general. It comes in a really cool tin,I think the cover art is from the UK poster like the replica inside. The disk as alot of cool features on it,the original theatrical trailer,the trailer for the Evil Dead:Hail To The King videogame for PlayStation1,a featurette called The Gore The Merrier,it's a great featurette if you forget the fact the half of the featurette is from old tapes that Greg Nicotero filmed while shooting ED2. The biggest treat on the DVD is the audio commentary(Say hello to Papa)with Sam Raimi,Bruce Campbell,Scott Spiegel and Greg Nicotero. When you watch the movie with the commentary it makes the movie way more funnier,with the four talking about their experiences making the film. I think Sam Raimi is a really great director,think about it,he's gone from the Evil Dead movies to Darkman(my favourite Raimi film)to A Simple Plan to The Gift and of course Spiderman and I really hope he thinks about making a fourth Evil Dead picture. Evil Dead 2 is a sweet,cool,enjoyable and funny flick to watch anytime. Groovy",1033862400,,1485,4.782101167315175
3456498,5,B001AOHPXA,"It's hard to say ""Evil Dead 2"" is all that scary, but it's definitely a lot of fun.
While chock-full of gory zombie-violence, the main draw of ""Evil Dead 2"" is the hysterically over-the-top performance by Bruce Campbell. As the stalwart hero Ash, Campbell abandons the straight-faced terror of the first film and goes right for the diaphragm. His jut-jawed bravado elevates this film from standard horror-fare to true classic. It's much more tongue-in-cheek than the original, and it's more enjoyable for it.
The blood-and-guts quotient is lavishly high - but it's too bad that the distributor mandated cutting some of the gorier scenes to avoid an X rating (they aren't even included on the DVD).
As if the movie itself weren't enough, the DVD features one of the most entertaining commentary tracks on the market. All participants are affable and informative. It's like watching with a bunch of your buddies--and they just happen to be the ones who made the movie!",1032652800,,966,4.969135802469136

Out of people, out of walls, out of sewer pipes, etc., etc.  There's some surprising touches of humanity to the performances - at one point a woman sings a childhood lullaby to her (possessed, undead) mother which gives Campbell time to chop her up.  The plots a little more logical than ED1.
As others have said, no horror collection is complete w/o the Evil Dead Series (Evil Dead, Evil Dead 2, Army of Darkness).",1030060800,,478,4.534883720930233

If you go into this movie expecting real horror you'll be disappointed.  If you go in wanting tons of laughs and an edge of horror you will quickly have a new movie to add to your collection.  Great comic acting, sweet camera angles, laugh out loud special effects and the greatest hero of all time make ED II one of the best of the best.

This is the type oif film you could watch over and over again with your friends and have the same impact as the first time seeing. The DVD doesn't have the best bonus features but the commentary is the funniest. Bruce, Sam, and Rob will make you think you were there during the making of it.

It has hilarious dark humor like when Ash's hand goes bad and hits him in the head with plates! Director Sam Raimi keeps the surprises coming with this one like when Ash looks at himself in the mirror and Evil Ash comes out! Sam Raimi as a director is very talented because, he can make a movie, write the script for it, and then mix all of these surprise key elements with it. When he started out doing the whole Evil Dead trilogy he started the first one out on a very low budget for I think maybe around Four-Thousand dollars. The second Evil Dead he had a higher budget. The third movie Army Of Darkness was a much higher budget than both the first and the second film combined. Look at Sam Raimi now! He directed Spider-Man which is not a low-budget film. This movie itself has an excellent plot! Ash is still trying to get away from the cabin but, the deadites won't let him. Then some people go their to find the proffesor so that they can give him the rest of the pages to the Book of the Dead and I am not going to tell you the rest so just go out and buy this movie!

Bruce Campbell mugs and grins his way through a film that is gorier and funnier than the first and plays well in repeated viewings.

In the deep woods, a traveler named Ash (Bruce Campbell) and his girlfriend Linda find an abandoned cabin and accidentally unleashes an unspeakable evil force from the pages of the Necronomicon, the ancient Book of the Dead. Now, Ash must resist this strange evil's brutal torments in order to save his soul and send the evil force back to where it came from. Director Sam Raimi's (Spider-Man 1 & 2) horror spectacle is an amazing combination of creepy stylish horror and hilarious slapstick comedy. ""Evil Dead 2"" is more of a big budget remake of the original ""Evil Dead"" (1982) than a sequel. Its storyline progresses smoothly and offers some good scares and very entertaining moments. The cult favorite contains some terrific camerawork, effective visuals effects, immense laughs and memorable gross-out scenes. Bruce Campbell's vivid performance as unlikely hero Ash is another good highlight of the 1987 film.

For fans of the horror genre, ""Evil Dead II"" is a highly recommended purchase. The cult 1987 favorite is presented in both standard full screen and 1.85:1 anamorphic widescreen formats. Its picture quality is reasonably sharp with good contrast. Its Dolby Digital 5.1 sound is rather enjoyable with lively surround effects. This DVD contains a detailed audio commentary with filmmaker Sam Raimi, star Bruce Campbell and production crew, the amusing 30-minute ""The Gore the Merrier"" behind-the-scenes documentary, still galleries, original theatrical trailer and a short preview of ""Evil Dead: Hail to the King"" video game.

3456505,5,B001AOHPXA,Evil Dead 2 was a good movie especially since this is the first one I have ever seen.  I thought it was a strange movie some parts seemed funny then other parts seemed to be very serious or very scary.  So it is in a way a very confusing movie.  However just like Beetlejuice it uses the infamous claymation.  I love claymation I wished they would still use it in some movies.  Evil Dead 2 was released in 1987 and did well at the box office.  At the end of the movie it lead us into the third movie Army of Darkness.  I recommend this movie.,1027814400,,542,4.056603773584905

There may be decapitations, the Necronomicon Ex Mortis (translating roughly into The Book of Dead Names of the Dead), and copious amounts of blood (in various consistencies, ranging from water to paint), but this is essentially, a slapstick.  Through the entire Evil Dead series, Bruce Campbell (the handsome, valiant Ash) is thrown through a total of six bookcases.  This movie is terrific, and the scariest part, in my opinion, is the opening description and history of the Necronomicon Ex Mortis.",1025654400,,604,5.08080808080808
3456507,5,B001AOHPXA,"Well what can I say for this outlandish crazy movie, alot of damn fun thats for sure. Plenty of excitement and action to spare as well as alot of laughs. Not really that scary, I guess it had its moments but like I said it is exciting and loaded with tons of surprises,and this is when Bruce starts coming up with his famous quotes.
Well as far as my theory goes for this being so similar to the first one, its like after Bruce stopped the curse on the first one, the demon knocked him like well back in time if you will. Like a bad dream and made his memory forget everything. Like it showed a glimpse of the demon doing that in this one. That or it was just made to make no sense whatsoever kind of sequel. Anyway the special effects well some of them are really good, yet others are really dumb but I guess back when this movie came out the effects were pretty damn good. But now if you see it, don't think its a bad movie because of the not so great special effects, its quite funny how they are done like when the woman is dancing around with no head and when the possessed guy floats in the air having major slow motion and when the grandma demon's head turned into some weird type of ostrich. Its all just meant to be crazy fun and has major hilarious moments.
Poor Ash, you see the hellish times hes been having. Add this to your collection you can like it more then the first or less as well as just as much which I do. As for Army of Darkness well thats on its own. Get this great horror, comedy movie, and you won't be dissapointed, however it isn't quite as violent as the first yet still often has major bloody parts. And for the final yes the once like invicible demon is now exposed, wow now you see why it was so strong. Enjoy!!!",1023840000,,1745,4.120234604105572
3456508,5,B001AOHPXA,"This sequel is virtually identical to its predecessor, even repeating many of the same scenes, yet is different in many regards.  The cinematography is terrific, the production itself really gorgeous:  the film is incredibly colorful, the sets, props and camerawork couldn't be better, and the makeups are as unsettling as those in the first film.
The sequel has more of a plot, not that it matters, and actually manages a few very funny bits  -  such as Bruce Campbell's hand acquiring a life of its own, being chopped from his body, and running around behind the walls to occasionally peek out of a mousehole and flip him off, or a mounted deer head on the wall that mockingly laughs at him.  The funniest  -  and perhaps most gruesome  -  thing in the movie is a possessed, grotesquely overweight woman in the cellar, who screeches out, ""I'll swallow your soul!  I'll swallow your soul!"" before being bloodily despatched by Campbell.
Like the first film, this one ends on an ambiguously unsettling note, but a different one this time  -  which unfortunately set up the silly sequel, Army of Darkness.  Appropriately enough, Evil Dead II is a bridge between the first movie and the third, showing brief moments of the humor that would run rampant in the following film, but more often hewing to the horrific carnage and tense melodrama of the first.

3456509,5,B001AOHPXA,"The Evil Dead series is one that inspires one of two things in people (and in some both): fear and laughter.
Ash (Bruce Campbell) goes with his girlfriend to a cabin for a weekend. However things go horribly wrong when he finds a tape recorder that plays sections of the Necronomicon (Book of the Dead) thereby releasing the power of the evil deadites.
Evil Dead 2 is more or less a remake of the first one, just with more laughter and a more filled out plot thrown in. We finally get to see what is chasing Ash throughout the series.
If your introduction to the horror genre were movies like Scream, or I know what you did last summer, you might enjoy this, but every fan of really good horror (or B) movies knows this has its fair share of creep out moments.
The special features on this DVD are not extensive, especially by todays standards, but what you do get are great. Listening to star Bruce Campbell give his thoughts on the movie, or hearing director Sam Raimi (Spider-Man) talking about the movie is great.
If you're interested in seeing a horror film at the same time you want to watch comedy you can do NO wrong with this film. Buy it, rejoice in its enjyoability and watch it frequently.",1020729600,,1201,4.4389140271493215
3456510,4,B001AOHPXA,"EVIL DEAD 2: DEAD BY DAWN is a sequel to the classic horror film, EVIL DEAD. The first seven minutes are so of the film retell what happened in the first film, but in condensed form (due to legal reasons, footage for the first film was not allowed in this one, so they had to retell the events; hard to do with only one returning actor from the first picture). Ash is back and after briefly being possessed after his night of hell, he is saved by the rising sun. Unable to escape the woods, he returns to the cabin to defend himself. He's attacked by the dead body and chopped off head of his deceased girlfriend, Linda. In the process, he has his right hand infected by the Evil and chops it off to save the rest of himself. Ash is later joined by a quartet: the professor's daughter, her finance, and two country hicks. They arrive in search of the Professor, but instead find Ash and well, things get all confused.
EVIL DEAD was made to be a strictly horror film, but included the slightest hints of humor. EVIL DEAD 2 has a few frightening moments, but is mostly a dark comedy woven within a tale of terror. Sam Raimi was really finding his style as a director and his touch is all over this movie. Bruce Campbell is great as Ash and plays the role with just the right dose of frightened bravo cockiness. The movie wouldn't have been as good with anyone else in the role.
I found EVIL DEAD 2 to be much more enjoyable than the first film. It was suspenseful without being frightening; chilling without being creepy; funny without being corny. If you're looking for a straight horror film, watch EVIL DEAD. However, if you want to watch a dark comedy interlaced with some moments of gore, watch EVIL DEAD 2.",1019347200,,1710,4.380503144654088

Oddly enough, there is still some confusion over Sam Raimi's (''Is It A 'Sequel?'; Is It A 'Remake?'; Is It A 'Requel?'; Is It A 'Semake?''') movie, ''Evil Dead II.'' This confusion is not entirely unwarrented, however.
The assigning of the number ''two'' in the film's title automatically suggests that the film is a sequel (i.e., a 'second chapter' in a continuing saga). However, the events which take place between both films make it patently obvious that ''ED2'' is NOT a sequel.
In the first film, main characters Ashley and his girlfriend Linda arrive at the cabin with his sister and a couple of friends, everyone [except?/including? Ash] dies, and the ''Book of the Dead'' is destroyed in the fire. If ''Evil Dead II'' was intended to be a sequel to the first film, then who relocated the cursed isolated cabin atop a dizzyingly high cliff, and just how crazy would Ashley have to be in order to return there, where he either nearly lost his life or completely lost it before his miraculous resurrection, and how crazy would his resurrected girlfriend Linda have to be for tagging along with him back to the place where she was possessed by the evil undead and decapitated only to be repossessed and decapitated again, and why would she receive the same necklace and charm she had already received earlier and act all ga-ga as though she were receiving it for the very first time? And just how did the previously destroyed ''Book of the Dead'' suddenly rematerialize? It could all happen only if ''ED2'' was NOT a sequel.
What is it, then? Is the movie's title a ''play-on-words''-- i.e., ''The Evil Dead, TOO'' --meaning that the film is a ''remake?'' No, because, again, despite the many similarities between the two films (including the ''return'' of two key characters: Ashley and Linda), the overall theme, pacing, and introduction of a whole new set of supporting characters totally rule out any idea of this film's simply being a remake of an original. The title's inclusion of the number ''two'' is also clear indication that this film is something other than a remake.
So what's going on? How does one make sense of this seeming paradox brought about by these two radically similar yet radically dissimilar films?
I cannot begin to speak on behalf of the films' creator(s), but I personally find clarity in the titles of the two films. ''The Evil Dead'' is the ''official'' version of the film -- in other words, ''ED1'' is ''THE'' Evil Dead movie; ''Evil Dead TWO'' is actually the ''SECOND VERSION'' of ''The Evil Dead'' ... i.e., it is a ''NEW INTERPRETATION'' of the ''official'' film: Therefore, ''D2'' could just as easily be called, ''Evil Dead 2[nd version]'' or ''Evil Dead 2[nd interpretation]'' for clarity. ''Evil Dead II'' is a ''STAND ALONE'' FILM, apart from ''Evil Dead I'' ... ''Army of Darkness''-- the so-called 'third installment' of the ''Evil Dead Trilogy'' --is specifically a sequel to ''Evil Dead II,'' NOT a ''continuation'' of the entire ''Evil Dead'' storyline.
Now whether ''ED2'' is the film Raimi and company ''would have'' made initially if their first ''Book of the Dead'' project (''Evil Dead's'' originally intended title) had access to the bigger budget the second film enjoyed is known only to Raimi and company: Judging from the similarities and differences, one can only guess. By direct comparison, ''ED2'' is much more of a lighthearted slapstick than its predecessor and the very graphic gore is more for storytelling and visual effect than for the shock value of the first film.
In ''Evil Dead II,'' Bruce Campbell reprises his role as Ash; the role of his girlfriend Linda, originally portrayed by Betsy Baker, is now taken over by Denise Bixler. The supporting characters are comprised this time of a couple of country hicks and a couple of archaeologists, one of whom happens to be the adult daughter of the cabin's previous occupant -- the man who first unwittingly released the evil entities into the surrounding woods by means of an ancient incantation from the ''Book of the Dead'' (the same entities which have been unwittingly re-released by Ash when he replays the incantation that had been left recorded on tape by the previous occupant).
As in the first film, the woods themselves come alive and prevent anyone from escaping their impending doom. But this group of unlikely heroes have an Ace in the hole: The daughter was paying a visit to the cabin in order to present her father with their latest and most significant find -- the 'lost pages' of the ''Book of the Dead,'' which include, among other things, an incantation to dispell the evil. So whereas ''Evil Dead I'' was a massacre  in a one-sided losing battle, ''Evil Dead II'' is full-scale war from start to finish.
Bloody, hysterically funny at times, and packed with more memorable one-liners than a Steven Wright concert, ''Evil Dead II'' is definitely a welcome addition to any personal movie library ... don't let the hardcore ''Old School'' Evil Dead-ites dissuade you, or you'll miss out on a unique and enjoyable experience.

""Ash"" Campbell would later call ""Splatstick"". I spent the whole running time fuming over this betrayal. How could the man behind the awesome Evil Dead make this travesty?
  Well, with 15 years hindsight under my belt, I am now able to appreciate Evil Dead II for what it is: An over-the-top, out-of-control romp that keeps the blood gushing and the belly laughs coming from start to finish.
  After a brief recap of the first Dead flick, we have a new batch of victims come to the cabin to be menaced (along with the leftover Ash...) by the ""deadites"". Much carnage ensues.....
  The effects are great, and it's amazing to see what the filmmakers were able to accomplish with such a limited budget.
The extras are a lot of fun, too. The commentary with Campbell & Raimi is hilarious and enlightening, and the featurette, ""The Gore The Merrier"" is must-see for deadheads.

I can't think of any other film that will make you limp like this one will!  Watching this movie (DVD) will take away all your problems, cares, and worries for at least a couple of hours.
It might make a good bedtime story for some people, for sure.
Most of the time I write about DVD quality because other folks care to discuss plot points.  Please understand that's why my ratings often appear low.
The picture starts out pretty flaky but improves in dark scenes, which are most of the film.  It's not the best picture, especially for 1987.  Maybe they filmed this in 16-mm; I don't know.
Sound is the real treat here, so you'll want to blast away and maybe have your windows open on a hot summer night.  Your neighbors will flee, for sure, after hearing this soundtrack!  The fidelity is not deep, but there are moments of great surround treats and they are usually gore-related.  However, there are not enough audio mixtures like this in the whole film to merit another star.

It is a higher-budget remake, with all pretense of horror abandoned in favor of outrageous campiness and the most ridiculoulsy funny violence ever filmed (a demon keeps threatening to ""swallow your soul""....the hero chops its head off with an axe....the demon keeps threatening him....hero produces double-barreled shotgun, quips ""Swallow this"" and blows the talking head to bits).

In the eighties, Evil Dead was a moderate success for director Sam Raimi & somehow managed to gross $2,400,000 upon it's initial release in the U.S  even though the budget was only $375,000. Despite mixed reviews from critics, the film has since managed to acquire a dedicated following as well as two successful sequels. (Horror writer Stephen King gave the film massive props in a November 1982 issue of Twilight Zone.) Not only did the sequels do exceptionally well, the films have all received multiple re-issues on DVD & several re-pressings through various distributors. Probability suggests that Evil Dead's popularity will remain a constant & this film's devoted followers will always cite this first entry as being their absolute favorite.

Within the past few years, Evil Dead has also been made into an off-Broadway musical production with the approval of Bruce Campbell & Sam Raimi.

Although Evil Dead 2 works well as a sequel, I've always considered the film to be a re-visioning of the first low-budget classic only this time Raimi had more moo-lah-ah to play with. Even though there are sure-fire elements of horror present, I'm not REALLY sure I'd call it a straight-forward horror flick as it's way too goofy to be taken seriously. Having said that, there's plenty to love here & more reason to re-visit Evil Dead a second time. Need I say that the laughs come as fast as the gore??

How gory is Evil Dead 2? The film is unrated which means it wasn't submitted to the MPAA
because it surely would have gotten something more than an R), and in fact inspired the distributor (De Laurentiis Entertainment Group, founded by Dino De Laurentiis) to create Rosebud Releasing for this one film. There are plenty of decapitations, zombies, supernatural demons, and plenty of gore to satisfy the blood-thirsty nuts like myself who simply can't get enough of it. Oh, yes there will be blood. Buckets.

For some odd reason, Ash (played by Bruce Campbell) seems to love taking weekend trips with his girlfriend to this evil little place in the woods. You would think he might've learned his lesson after dealing with those demons from hell in the first entry & decided to take up golf as a hobby or maybe find another vacation spot. Instead, he would rather do battle with these evil minions in a haunted cabin once again. Some guys never learn I guess.

Evil Dead 2 picks up immediately where it's predecessor ended. Ashley takes his girlfriend on a seemingly romantic vacation back to the cabin in the woods. All is well until Ash begins to play a recording of Professor Knowby's incantations from the Necronomicon (roughly translated ""Book Of The Dead"") & the trouble immediately starts up again. As once can probably guess, the recorded passages unleash an evil force which takes possession of Linda's body & Ash is forced to either kill her or be killed.

I could go into further details here for you but why kill the ultimate experience? As anyone who has seen this entry or any other Evil Dead film an tell you, the proof is definitely in the pudding. What becomes of a terrified Ash & is it really possible to kill Linda? If Ash can bring himself to murder the girlfriend, will she stay dead? Will Ash ever escape this nightmare in the woods or will he find himself the catalyst in a series of grotesque encounters with the demonic world?

Evil Dead is often touted as being a zombie flick by it's fans or cult following. While there are elements of the film which do remind us of zombie flicks, I've always seen the film to be about demonic possession. I will even go so far as to say I've seen countless threads or postings online where people have debated this for many years. At any rate, it's an entertaining flick & that's all that should matter.

3456527,5,B001AOHPXA,"Well what can I say for this outlandish crazy movie, alot of damn fun thats for sure. Plenty of excitement and action to spare as well as alot of laughs. Not really that scary, I guess it had its moments but like I said it is exciting and loaded with tons of surprises,and this is when Bruce starts coming up with his famous quotes. Well as far as my theory goes for this being so similar to the first one, its like after Bruce stopped the curse on the first one, the demon knocked him like well back in time if you will. Like a bad dream and made his memory forget everything. Like it showed a glimpse of the demon doing that in this one. That or it was just made to make no sense whatsoever kind of sequel. Anyway the special effects well some of them are really good, yet others are really dumb but I guess back when this movie came out the effects were pretty damn good. But now if you see it, don't think its a bad movie because of the not so great special effects, its quite funny how they are done like when the woman is dancing around with no head and when the possessed guy floats in the air having major slow motion and when the grandma demon's head turned into some weird type of ostrich. Its all just meant to be crazy fun and has major hilarious moments. Poor Ash, you see the hellish times hes been having. Add this to your collection you can like it more then the first or less as well as just as much which I do. As for Army of Darkness well thats on its own. Get this great horror, comedy movie, and you won't be dissapointed, however it isn't quite as violent as the first yet still often has major bloody parts.

The first film was a grainy horror movie with unintentional humor. This film is the most hillarious piece of work i've seen in forever. I saw this movie for the first time when it was released when I was 8 years old and couldn't stop laughing at it's cornball cheescore humor. The ""plot"" returns Ash to the cabin with his girlfriend , plays the tape that invokes the spirits , his girlfriend becomes a monster , he hacks her head off only to find her naked corpse dancing the ballet. The first half of the film is nothing more than Ash taking a severe beating from his severed possessed hand and going on the brink of insanity. Then a couple related to the people who occupied the cabin before show up only to find out they became demons. Then a hick couple tags along. Yeah thats basically the plot right there. The rest of the movie is each person becoming possessed or eaten by a demon. We get gallons of blood , eye ball eating , walking severed hands , green gore , cheesy animated demons , giant trees , and of course Ash .""groovy""",1008460800,,1189,4.36036036036036

Actually in 2, Ash pulls from his past encounter's to show off his new sarcasm. If you didn't like the straight forward horror of the first, then this is for you. I have watched this movie many times in the past two years, and laugh every time! When Ash has taken out the enemy, and you think the battle is over, he turns on himself...more specifically his hand. In an effort to save himself from the spreading incantation, he whacks off his arm in a humorous and bloody fashion. This movie is my favorite of all ultra-violent comedies, and not for the faint of heart, but if you pulled the first one out of your player because your stomach couldn't take it (as my friends have made me do the last three times)(I forgave them, Evil Dead has been rightly dubbed NC-17, when I was expecting X) then maybe you will like this one.

3456533,5,B001AOHPXA,"This movie just plain kicked arse.  It's not really horror, and it's not really a comedy.  The only way to really categorize it is with the term Bruce Campbell himself invented: ""splatstick.""  Evil Dead 2 is the perfect mix between horror and comedy (though it focuses mainly on the laughs).  It was drop dead hilarious, and was jammed pack with so much classic material that it's been ripped off ever since (case in point: Idle Hands is a 2 hour rip off of 15 minutes of this movie).  This movie's awesome, and it gets better every time I see it, so enlighten yourself and buy it.  The only thing you have to keep in mind is that when you watch it, you have to do so with a lighthearted attitude; don't expect everything to make sense, just enjoy it.
Just wanted to clear up one thing, this movie is NOT, despite many claims otherwise, a remake.  It's a sequel.  To those who think it's a remake: the reason the beginning seems like the first one is because the people who made it couldn't get a hold of footage from the first one (some kind of legal problem) to do a recap, so they had to condense and re-film the events of the first picture.  If you watch closely, about 5 minutes through you see the last shot of the first film, ending the recap and therefore starting the sequel.",1006214400,,1284,4.338912133891213
3456534,5,B001AOHPXA,"EDII is a wacked out horror-comedy, and definitely not for all tastes. In fact, the first time I saw it many years ago, I thought it was stupid. I was into ""serious"" horror films at the time and didn't appreciate the humor in it. It's almost a satire of the horror genre, even of the original Evil Dead. Years later I was able to appreciate it for what it is. If you approach it with this in mind, it's a scream of a good time. The original Evil Dead film was scarier, but the only humor in it was unintentional, ie: incredibly bad acting, super cheesy FX. In EDII, we get better acting and better FX, still cheesy but they fit the tone of the film. The gore is so over the top it's hilarious! What really makes the film is Sam Raimi's camera work and Bruce Campbell's crazed acting and brilliant physical comedy. The bit with the evil hand is just classic.
Folks who gripe about plot holes and the like: loosen up, it's just a cheesy horror movie. You're taking it way too seriously. It's really a marvelous piece of work for a relatively low budget film, and there's a reason why it's earned such a cult following and is held in such high esteem by many in the business: it's full of creativity.
I think it can also be argued that EDII spawned first person shooter computer games like Doom and Duke Nukem 3D. (Doom has a chainsaw for a weapon, and Duke Nukem spouts one-liners lifted  right out of EDII and ""Army Of Darkness""..)
There's been a lot of controversy over the story not matching up with the first film. Here's my take on it: It's not really a sequel. Ash didn't go back to the cabin. The events at the first of EDII are a recap of what happened in the first ED film, for people who didn't see it, but EDII is meant to stand on it's own. ""Army of Darkness"" is the sequel to EDII, so there are really only two films in the 'series', not three. I think the original Evil Dead is just a 'demo' if you will, of what Raimi really had in mind. Personally, I'm glad he increased the humor and decreased the hard core gore a bit, makes it more entertaining. The last time I tried to watch the original Evil Dead, I could barely finish, it was so bad. Of the three Evil Dead films, this one is hands down my favorite.

Evil Dead 2 is just one of those movies that every human being on the earth needs to see (Big Trouble In Little China being the another) the slapstick, overdone approach to horror works so well, and even if you're not into the cheesy acting or cheesier special effects, you gotta love this film for it delivers; fun.
This special edition DVD provides all the extras one needs for this film. The video quality is excellent, with barely any scratches or specks. The THX treatment really improves the sound, especially for those with surround sound. You're given a choice of either wide-screen or fullscreen, but this classic definately needs to be seen in full anamorphic goodness.
The extras include the requisite trailer, awesome commentary by all the principles involved with the film (director Sam Raimi and the man, Bruce Campbell most notably) and a hilarious 30 minute documentary detailing all the hard work that went into the film.
A great DVD by all standards. Even if you own every version of this film on video, buy this and treat your DVD player to some Evil Dead!",1003017600,,1108,4.806282722513089

Bruce Campbell is such a great ""B"" movie actor.  He beats the crap out of himself in the movie, and is able to pull off the serious yet silly character perfectly.  Unlike Army Of Darkness, where he was really more of a goof, he plays a great lead role and hero in this film.

3456538,4,B001AOHPXA,In many ways Evil Dead 2 is better than the first but it doesn't make sense from where Evil Dead left off and where this one begins. In the first evil dead it ends with ash burning the necromomekon AKA the book of the dead and the possessed friends explode. Ash walks out of the cabin only to be possessed. Evil Dead 2 begins with Ash and his girlfriend Linda (same girl from the first one) returning to the cabin then Ash sees the tape recorder and turns it on like he forget the recorder from the last time. Linda gets possessed and Ash cuts her head off with a shovel just like in the first one. Now I know this movie was ment to be a remake but they could have made that more clear by not calling it Evil Dead 2. But besides the beginning this movie is excellent it has better gore effects it has humour something the first didn't have at all. I think it would have been better if they continued it like Army of Darkness and have ash tell you what happend last and cut out the beginning and begin with ash getting possessed. All in all I really like this movie but they should have told us ash worked at S mark like in the third one.,998870400,,1137,4.080357142857143
3456539,5,B001AOHPXA,"As many have said, this film is really more of a remake than a sequel. Although Raimi intended the first five minutes to summarize the first movie and the rest of this one to be the actual sequel, there are enough changes that effectively this becomes a remake.
What is interesting is how, even with relatively minor plot differences, they are very different films. It's not often that you see a genre shift within the same series of movies (ALIEN and ALIENS comes to mind). The first EVIL DEAD was an all-out B-movie horror flick, a genuine attempt to scare and gross out its viewers, on a miniscule budget. The second is a more self-consciously ironic parody of that genre, with a bigger (but still very small) budget. Its primary goal is laughs, not thrills -- though it has those too.
I'm surprised that Leonard Maltin says the second movie is ""almost on par"" with the first. To me, the second one is orders of magnitude superior to the first. But I acknowledge that this is a personal opinion which makes sense when you consider that I have always considered even ""serious"" B-movie horror flicks to be laughable and not remotely scary. All the cliches (of dialogue, plot, cinematography, music, and gory FX) just lend themselves too easily to self-parody. How can such a movie possibly take itself seriously? I think Raimi and Campbell came to the same conclusion before making the second film.
If you have a similar perspective, or if you have seen ARMY OF DARKNESS and are wondering which EVIL DEAD to watch, see this one, EVIL DEAD II. It is the true predecessor (in plot and style) to ARMY, and it is the movie that the first one wished it could be.",998784000,,1658,4.60472972972973

The first Evil Dead movie was awesome but this sequel blows it away. While it isn't really a sequel (it's more like a remake), it's still great and given the choice I'd much rather watch Evil Dead 2 than Evil Dead 1. It's very fast-paced and is much more enjoyable and more fun than ED 1, perfectly mixes Horror and Comedy, and Bruce Campbell is the best! For the story of Evil Dead 2: Dead By Dawn, it's a little tough to explain because ED 2 virtually has no plot, but I'll sum it up like this: Ash along with his girlfriend Linda take a vacation at some cabin where Ash discovers a tape recorder and a weird book called the Necronomicon (a book made of Human flesh and inked in Human blood that contains spells on how to resurrect Demons and the like). He plays the tape which summons Monsters and Demons from the forest that wreak havoc and try to either possess or kill Ash. The story is basically just a rehash of the first film (I've heard that director Sam Raimi had some trouble directly following the first film because of the new distributor, so he decided to remake the first. I'll let the story problem pass because of Sam's troubles), but ED 2 is still awesome! Bruce steals the show as Ash and he just rocks here! I loved the scene where he smashed a lot of plates against his Head, sawed off his possessed Hand, got showered with lots of differently-colored blood, and when he got his Chainsaw arm! How can you not love the scene where he saws off the Deadite's Head and blows it's Head off with his Boomstick Shotgun? His lines are also very funny and memorable and their so cool (Swallow This! Groovy! Let's Go Carve Ourselves A Witch!). I liked the other characters as well. I really liked Deadite Ash and Evil Ed and the whole Henrietta storyline was great and fit in very well. The special F/X were awesome and the gore was GREAT! The finale is very exciting and way tense and the Monster (supposedly that thing that we see from it's POV in the first ED movie and early on in Part 2) is finally revealed and is way cool and is definitely worth the wait. Sam Raimi's direction is very top-notch and the camera angles are very good and the film's Atmosphere is strong and the feel fast and furious. There are a ton of fun and memorable scenes and the whole movie just kicks butt from start to finish. WAY better than the first (which is still cool) and definitely better than Army Of Darkness. Evil Dead 2: Dead By Dawn is truly one of the best Horror Films ever made, and simply put, it's a must-see experience. The Special Edition DVD is excellent and simply makes the movie all the more fun. Nice extras include a really funny and enjoyable commentary by Sam Raimi as well as Bruce Campbell and the Co-Writer and one of the special F/X guys, a fantastic behind-the-scenes featurette which shows how a lot of the special effects were done and some funny outtakes and bloopers. You also get a very nice still gallery which has a ton of still photographs that are very clear and have great quality, and there are plenty more extras. And yes, the transfer is great. Evil Dead 2 has never looked and sounded better and it will probably never be better than it is here. Unfortunately I couldn't get the Limited Edition DVD like I wanted, but both DVDs seem to be the same (at least, judging from technical aspects I've read).

Most modern horror movies just throw gore at you to get you to respond. But this movie works on so many levels.
A definate 10 on the gross out meter.
A definate 10 on the laugh meter.
A definate 10 on the spooky meter.
Completely original, the Evil Dead series have a certain 'feel' to them, (for lack of a better word).
I had a 17 year-old girl come up to me a couple of weeks ago and said that she saw the scariest movie in the world and she just loved it.
She said that movie was Evil Dead.
I told her that I thought Evil Dead 2 was the best of the 3, but that Army of Darkness, (the 3rd in the trilogy), was pretty good too.
She flipped out and begged me to let her borrow my Evil Dead 2 Special Edition.
I let her use it upon the condition that she watched it with a bunch of her friends.
As far as the DVD version goes...everything on this disk is worth checking out.
The BEST part of the disk?
The audio commentary with Sam Raimi and Bruce Campbell.
Still the best I've ever heard on a DVD.
If you like Evil Dead 2...this will quickly become one of your favorite DVDs that you will watch over and over again.
If you've never seen any of the Evil Dead movies...rent all 3 and watch them in sequence.

However, to put in my two cents, I believe that there are much better (i.e. funnier and grosser) examples of horror-comedy that deserve greater attention than the Evil Dead series such as Bride of Re-Animator.  That being said, this movie does deserve viewing.  Besides good special effects, one of its greatest assets is Bruce Campbell's wonderful performance as the flawed but likeable lead character that adds something most horror-comedy movies are missing: a hero worth rooting for.  This has the effect of also placing the movie in the adventure genre (which Raimi later became rich off of with Hercules and Xena).  It is far less silly than the Toxic Avenger (also fun) so you do get more into the story.  And, unlike Bride of Re-Animator, it won't ever leave you feeling nauseous (but, the tradeoff is that with far less tension, the humour is less of a welcome relief).  Watching this movie is like reading an enjoyable, tongue-in-cheek horror comic.  Don't take it too seriously, sit back and have fun.",989539200,,1092,4.833333333333333

The special features are great especially the commentary I never laughed so loud like i did with this one, they joke about everything from the sound effects to jewelery!

3456559,5,B001AOHPXA,"I busted out laughing so many times during ""Evil Dead 2"" that I was surprised to be scared at certain parts. If the Three Stooges decided to put on hockey masks and make a horror film, this would've been the movie they made. Sam Raimi's spectacular sequel to the infinitely popular cult series that was spawned by his visionary ""The Evil Dead"" (originally titled ""Book of the Dead,"" but the producers thought that a literary reference in the title would send prospective viewers astray) is so endlessly funny, violent and action-packed with uncanny sound effects and manic cinematography from Peter Deming (who worked with Wes Craven on ""Screams 2 and 3""). It's a never-ending exercise in dark humor and all-out original thinking, and right at its center, a marvelously ordinary hero, Ashley J. Williams, played with amazing physical comic talent by Bruce Campbell, who is apparently the master of flipping himself over.
The film starts off as a sort of recap of the events that left Ash alone in the woods during the first ""Evil Dead,"" with some different adaptations (his other friends in the original were never there, only his girlfriend Linda). Then we're launched headfirst into this hair-raising carnival ride that takes plunges into all-out comedy and then rockets us back up into loops of hellacious scares. The very first brand new scene of the movie is something of a masterpiece as the Evil being in the woods sweeps Ash off his feet and carries him through the treetops. I didn't know whether to think ""cool"" or start laughing so hard I'd puke, so I did both (didn't puke, though). The new characters are introduced, some are turned into demons, some aren't. All of them reach a grisly demise either at the hands of the demonic forces of the woods, or by the ax of Ash himself, who is always in imminent danger of converting into a member of the Evil Dead fan club himself. As is the usual of films of the horror genre back in the eighties, the acting can be laughably bad at times. Bruce isn't exactly impressive, but he has his moments of believability, and he wears them proudly. But bad acting or not, ""Evil Dead 2"" is one of the best times a horror film has ever given me. I attribute this to a terrific comic performance from Campbell, the experimental camerawork from Peter Deming, and the kinetic direction from Sam Raimi. This is a movie that will be offering a good time to generations of dedicated film buffs in the years to come.",984355200,,2454,4.696055684454756
3456560,5,B001AOHPXA,"Gore, dismemberment, horror, blood... what else could you want?! This is definately classic though it is little over 10 years old. Like the 1st evil dead, this one is packed with lots of red stuff, but a little comedy was added in. It will leave you wanting more. You won't regret this purchase.
I own both the VHS and DVD version of this movie, but the DVD version is the one to get.",983491200,,384,4.273972602739726
3456561,5,B001AOHPXA,"A sequel equal to or better than the original!? Well, to be fair this is just a much a remake as it is a sequel. When I say remake, they tweeked the first of the first, geefully ignored it, and added some blantant comedy.
And it works.
Bruce Campbell and his girlfriend again head out to a remote cabin in the woods and mistakenly awake evil that is out to get them.
This is a superb example of horror-comedy. It isn't over the line to become unintentionally stupid and still packs some scares. It's not as violent as the first (it's kinda hard to upstage a woman being raped by a tree), and it's easier to take since it's being played for laughs.
I can't quite recommend it to everyone because some are sure to be unrightfully offended or grossed out by the film. But to me, this film is just great fun, easily amongst my favorites.",983059200,,833,4.312101910828026

3456563,5,B001AOHPXA,"First off, before I start my review of the DVD, I would like to add that Evil Dead 2 is NOT a remake.  Renaissance Pictures couldn't get footage of Evil Dead from New Line, so Raimi simply re-shot some flashback footage, quickly summarizing Evil Dead.  Ok, now Evil Dead 2 starts right where Evil Dead left off.  The morning drives the evil spirits out of Ash, but that doesn't mean that they will come back!
Ok, now for the DVD.  Quite possibly the greatest horror film of all time, this is the only DVD version that matters!  Evil Dead 2 has been re-released in an excellent Limited Edition tin case set.  Numbered out of 50,000 copies, Evil Dead 2 Limited is loaded with extra features.  The disc contains widescreen and fullscreen versions of the film, which are both excellent transfers, and the soundtrack is amazingly remixed in Dolby 5.1. Now onto the extras.  First up is one of the greatest commentaries of all time, it includes Sam Raimi, Bruce Campbell, Scott Speigel, and Greg Nicotero.  Next up is The Gore the Merrier featurette.  It runs about a half hour long, and is very informative with behind-the-scenes footage, and great details about the special effects.  We then get a trailer, a videogame preview, talent bios, still galleries, a poster replica, and a nice 48-page booklet.  Get this DVD now!!!  It is rare, and will be out of print soon!",982800000,,1364,4.680672268907563
3456564,5,B001AOHPXA,"Although Evil Dead 2 isn't quite as good as the first one, it is very close. The major difference between the two movies is that this sequel is pretty much a black comedy, even paying tribute to the Three Stooges. Although are some moments of Evil Dead that could be considered funny, nothing comes close to some of the moments in this movie such as Ash's hand turned evil hitting him over the head with dishes, and after knocking him out, drags him across the floor. Although some of the humor is subtle, for instance after Ash cuts off his hand and puts it under the bucket, the book he uses to weigh the bucket down is A Farewell To Arms. Evil Dead 2, however, is just as violent and fast paced as the original. If you liked the first one, you will like this one at least as much.",982368000,,783,4.226666666666667

A sense of humor is required; nerves of steel are not necessary.  The movie is worth watching if only for the delightful scene in which Ash battles his possessed hand.  Anyone who disparages Bruce Campbell's talent does not have the capacity to appreciate a true genius of physical comedy. Yes, there's gore, and a lot of it, but it is so (deliberately, I'm sure) overdone that it can't be frightening.  It's a good starter horror flick for those with weak hearts. The ULTIMATE Halloween party movie!  (For my fellow female viewers-- BC has cheekbones you could slice a salami on).  I think it's good, groovy fun all around.",981763200,,776,4.669117647058823

3456567,4,B001AOHPXA,"Evil Dead 2 is one of the best sequels I've ever seen.  First of all, how many sequels are made just to make fun of the first one? Okay, Scream 2 and 3, I'll give you those, but the whole Scream series owes much to the Evil Dead Trilogy.  My personal favorite scenes are, first and foremost, the scene where Ash's evil hand breaking the dishes over Ash's head, and then dragging his body toward the butcher knife.  When I first saw that, I could not stop laughing.  And then when he traps the hand in the trash can, stacking heavy books on top, and the top book is ""A Farewell to Arms"".  My other favorite scene is when the deer head and various pieces of furniture and appliances start laughing at Ash.  But Ash shows his dry cool wit with such one-liners as ""Groovy""  ""Here's your new home"" and my personal favorite, ""Swallow this."" And the featurette ""The Gore the Merrier"" had lots of funny moments.  The only reason it gets 4 stars instead of 5 is that while it may be good, Army of Darkness is the best of the Trilogy.

3456570,5,B001AOHPXA,"At the tender young age of 13 I first witnessed the brilliance and perfection that is the ""Evil Dead Trilogy."" What we have here is ""Evil Dead II,"" a movie that forever changed the way in which I viewed cinema. No longer would any movie do; this is the movie that I hold as the precedent that all films should aspire to be.
""Evil Dead II"" starts off as a re-cap of its predecessor, ""The Evil Dead."" It works as a reintroduction and a way to bring those viewers who did not see the first one up to speed. From there on, Ash (Bruce Campbell) has to once again face the forces of the dead, evil dead that is, who have been brought back to the world of the living due to readings from the book of the dead. Mayhem ensues in that famous little cabin and the woods that surround it. I don't want to spoil much in regard to the story since I hold this series in such high regard, but the story doesn't end here. After seeing ""Evil Dead II,"" you have to go and check out ""Army Of Darkness.""
Now, for the die hard fans that have come across this page and are now reading this, here are the great perks from this limited edition print. Make sure you get the ""Evil Dead II: Limited Edition;"" there is a ""Special Edition,"" but it isn't nearly as cool. This limited edition is a print of only 50,000 copies, comes in a special tin case, features both full frame and wide screen versions, audio commentary from director Sam Raimi and star Bruce Campbell, a collector's information booklet, a making-of featurette, THX sound, and features a look at the new video game, ""Evil Dead: Hail To The King.""

Bruce Cambell is a great actor and I'm still wondering why he hasn't gotten a decent flick after this Trilogy of not so much Terror, but more of Gore. Although Evil Dead 2 can seem very stupid and full of over acting, it's not. The camera work is simply amazing. Not for all tastes definately. But, if you like a fun, entertaining, laugh a minute, thrill a minute roller coaster ride in to your imagination, Evil Dead 2 is the movie to watch.

Ash and his girlfriend go up to spend the weekend at a deserted cabin that contains the book of the dead.  Evil Dead 2 is so much more accomplished in terms of special effects and cinematography.  Some of the shots in this film are nothing less than spectacular (when Ash gets hit by the evil force and gets driven through the forest at 100 mph).  The camera work is amazing and Raimi speeds up the film shots at exactly the right moments (when Ash's hand turns against him).  The ending is simply awesome and leads directly into Army of Darkness.  Evil Dead 2 has everything: lots of gore, some classic Ash lines, superb FX, and top notch cinematography.  Every true horror collector should own this film.",976320000,,778,4.553956834532374
3456574,5,B001AOHPXA,"Exceptional film virtuoso Sam Raimi (Evil Dead, Army of Darkness, Darkman, and a Simple Plan) dared to rethink his concept on (the Ultimate Exercise in Cinematic Terror) Evil Dead, which had already become a huge cult classic favorite worldwide, by continuing the story of girlish wimp Ashley Williams (Bruce Campbell) after his initial bloody escapade at the infamous log cabin but with a surprising atmospheric twist in presentation.
Beginning with a brief recap minus Ash's sister and the other couple from ED 1, Evil Dead 2: Dead by Dawn commences with Ash again becoming prey to all types of Deadite pranks, practical jokes, attempts of bodily possession, unholy possession of his girlfriend Linda, and becoming the butt of all the undead's jokes. Ash is again left to fend for himself against the evil undead denizens sprung from the unholy Necronomicon (Book of Dead) by accident. Unfortunately for Ash, his journey into hell is just starting, and this was just a description of the film's first five minutes. Due to ED 2's unparalleled storytelling zeal and zany sensibilities, it would a criminal offense to give any more away on this goofy classic's plot. Suffice to say it is an indescribable descent into an inconceivable realm where comedy and horror merge into one blissful concoction of hilarity that single-handedly redefined the borders of horror film from then on.
Evil Dead 2: Dead By Dawn should be seen all those who enjoy insanely creative movies that push the boundaries of cinema. Even those who think this film may be too violent or disturbing should at least take a brief gander at this. Unlike its predecessor, Evil Dead 2 mixes the sensibilities of a Three Stooges picture with the formula of Evil Dead to conceive an illogical yet supremely entertaining spoof on the horror film. This film is so chock full of treasured camp moments that anyone who has the slightest inkling about seeing it should.
Followed by an equally notable camp classic, Army of Darkness. As for Evil Dead 2: Dead By Dawn Limited Edition DVD by Anchor Bay, it contains a digitally and THX sound remastered print with an outstanding anamorhphic wide screen presentation that all Dead Heads are entitled to see, a fascinating commentary track with Sam Raimi, Bruce Campbell, and others, the Gore The Merrier featured containing behind the scenes footage, storyboard drawings, and much much more.

3456577,5,B001AOHPXA,"""Evil Dead 2"" ranks with ""Dead Alive"" and ""Re-Animator"" in the limited genre of black comedies full of gore and terror.
The reason why this film works so well (by example, over the more popular follow-up ""Army of Darkness"") is because the movie never let you know for sure that it is a comedy.
Example of the mix of horror and comedy: 1) The head of the decapitated girlfriend is biting our hero's hand. He runs like crazy to the shed in the backyard. 2) He traps the head in the benchpress. 3) The head talks sweetly as his girlfriend, and suddenly it changes to a demonic voice. 4) The hero reaches for the chainsaw. He opens a small curtain. No chainsaw. Only the chalk mark in the wall (like saying: here is where the chainsaw was supposed to be) 5) Cut to: the door opens abruptaly, and the decapitated body enters with the chainsaw. 6) Pure meyhem
Things like that. Oh, and as a result of that bite in the hand, now that extremity is possesed by a demon, while the rest of his body is not.
Excellent for a night with a group of friends. Highly recommended.",974419200,,1062,4.341708542713568
3456578,2,B001AOHPXA,"Just for the record, this is not a remake, but a sequel. Sam Raimi could not get the rights to re-use scenes from Evil Dead so he re-shot some of them to explain what is going on and how Ash and Linda got to the cabin. But there still is a major sense of deja vu.

Ash barricades himself into the cabin after the events in the first film and finds himself going crazy. The furniture starts laughing at him, his reflection talks to him and an evil force is determined to take him over. It manages to possess his hand and so he cuts it off. It starts scuttling around the floor on its own and randomly attacking him. Strangers show up in the hope of finding the Professor, who was staying there, and lock Ash in the cellar. They assume he is responsible for the bloody carnage.

People die, people turn into monsters - same old same-old. It's hard to imagine why this is such a cult favorite when it is obviously a badly made movie. Or perhaps Raimi just works the best he can with a low budget (although many times higher than the original) and the shoddy production values are a result of that.

He goes over the same ground he did before, except with more resources for gore and mayhem. Very little of this makes sense and none of it is scary. There are a couple of good moments, like when Ash's hand beats him up and when he is chased through the house by the unseen evil force. Campbell is a terrific physical actor and he is a delight to watch, but I doubt whether he understood what on earth he was doing, or why.

Having a low budget does not excuse a bad storyline and although this looks more professional than Evil Dead, it still looks like a student film. The best part is the cliff-hanger ending that leads to Army Of Darkness.

3456583,4,B001AOHPXA,"This review refers to the Limited Edition, the version that comes in the overlarge collector's tin that is too big to fit in any normal DVD case.
Anyone considering purchasing the LE ought to know what they are getting into.
Evil Dead 2: DBD is a wonderful send-up of the slasher/moster horror genre.  The film's virtues could take up all 1000 words of the review, so suffice to say that Raimi and Campbell made a wonderful piece of work here, especially considering how it was shot and the budget on which it was created.
Now, for the dirt on the LE DVD.
The metal tin, although cool, is huge.  About three inches taller than a normal DVD case, and about two inches thick, it won't fit in a holder, and will look really out of place next to your other discs.  The cover art is awesome (it was used for the British version of the movie poster, which is re-created on a mini-poster inside, a ""poster"" roughly the size of a postcard).  The movie and sound transfers are not great, but considering what they had to work with, I think they did the best they could.  The final complaint about the packaging is that the disc itself is in a cheap jewel-case you place in a little niche in the tin.  Sorry, but they could have found a more aesthetically pleasing way to package such an expensive disc.
The ""Gore the Merrier"" feature will appeal mainly to fans interested in how the many creature and blood effects were made.  It runs about a half-hour, and is educational, but more of a ""sneak-preview showcase"" of making monsters than an actual ""how-to class.""
The video game preview is a joke; it doesn't show anything you can't download off the web anyway, and the quality is so bad, you feel the urge to squint because it is so fuzzy at times.  Thankfully, game previews usually look nothing like the final products, so there is some hope for this (groovy-looking) Alone-In-The-Dark, Resident Evil clone.
The gem of this DVD is the commentary track.  Raimi and Campbell have never disappointed in their commentary on other discs, and they follow up nicely here as well.  I wonder why there wasn't two tracks, as there was on the Army of Darkness LE and the Evil Dead Special Edition, but I'm not going to complain too loudly, as the commentary here is almost worth what they are charging for this disc. (Everything's alright now!)
All in all, casual fans might want to stick with the regular edition.  The Limited Edition is pretty much only for collectors.  If you want a copy of this DVD, though, better act quickly, because once they are gone, the price-gougers on eBay will start their work.",970876800,,2591,4.572354211663067

3456586,5,B001AOHPXA,"Evil Dead 2, while technically a sequel, holds very little in common with ""Evil Dead."" Evil Dead was one of the scariest, creepiest, and grossest films I've ever seen. Evil Dead 2 is one of the funniest!
The gore in Evil Dead II is WAY over the top. (If you've seen Arthur's battle with the Black Knight in ""Monty Python's Holy Grail""... THAT'S the sort of gore I'm talking about.) Campy lines are thrown around in here the like you've not heard since the Batman TV series.
The Premise: Ash (Ashley Williams for those who saw the first one) and his girlfriend drive up to a secluded cabin in the woods for a weekend of fun. They come across a tape recording of ancient incantations...that, when played, release an unseen evil that stalks them. When the cabin owner's daughter and team show up, the evil comes for them all!
If you don't try to take this movie seriously, you won't be dissapointed. One of the film's scenes was once rated in the top ten fight scenes of all time: Ash versus... his hand.
Now, for the DVD goodies!
 First, the DVD and ""booklet"" come in a tin! I was impressed by the tin and the arwork on it, but the booklet is a bit of a let-down. The pictures in it are simply screen grabs (and not very good ones) from the movie.
 THX and Widescreen add back what's been missing all these years. It's nice to see (clearer!) all of the bits we've been missing and the 5.1 audio tracks make those chase scenes sound like you're right there!
 The featurette 'The Gore the Merrier' is fantastic and left me wanting more! It would be great to see more of the behind the scenes antics of this crew, as it's plain to see (hear in the commentary) that they had fun making the film.
 And, the teaser for the video game ""Evil Dead: Hail to the King"" has me chomping at the bit! I can't wait to play a game as Ash! ""You want a little??""
If you're an Evil Dead fan, this Limited Edition MUST be in your collection. If you just like slapstick/comedy/horror, you can't lose with this one.
When it comes down to it, if legions of undead started roaming the Earth, I'd want Ash nearby! Not just for protection, but also for comic relief!",969580800,,2137,4.348370927318296
3456587,5,B001AOHPXA,"The FILM: Many people consider this sequel to be at least equal to the first film and I have to agree. Ok, the freshness of the first part is gone to some extent, but the inventiveness of the filmmakers is still there in full effect and the film benefits greatly from a slightly different approach: Less gritty gore, more laughs. Bruce Campbell finally defines his charakter Ash and it is easy to understand why he is (still) so popular: It is nearly impossible not to like this mixture of a cool hero and a stupid geek that is thrown in the most hillarious situations anyone could come up with. Normally, I do not like to point out single scenes, this is boring for people who haven't seen the film and I believe that normally, the sum is greater than its parts, but in the case of EVIL DEAD II, I have to make an exception, because this scene is worth buying the disc alone: I'm talking about the ""laughing furniture""-scene. What a wonderful piece of moviemaking and sound design, eerie, haunting, impressive, demented - and very funny.  The DISC: What could I say? The THX-certificate shows in a wonderful image (you can even choose between widescreen and full-screen) and sound mix, a great making of-featurette (not your usual ""hyping of"" with actors explaining the plot and everyone congratulating everyone) and a very informative and very funny audio commentary. Just listen to Bruce Campbell commenting on the decision of the British censors to cut the scene where he's kicked while lying unconscious on the floor: ""Yeah, you're not supposed to hit an unconsicous man, but chopping of heads and limps is no problem!"". After all those years watching inferior video-copies of this film it is a great pleasure to watch this film in such a pristine conditon, anything less than five starts would be unfair, so DON'T MISS IT!",969580800,,1828,4.748427672955975
3456588,5,B001AOHPXA,"I had heard lots of things about the evil dead trilogy. my closest friends, who are, although not to my extent, film buffs, said they weren't  worth the money. but i thought: ""they sound like my kinda film, ill  read up about em"" so i did, and boy was i glad i did! I then went  ahead and bought all three on DVD, including this Limited Edition version  of Evil Dead 2. Wow. The film, pure cheese. But you can see that so much  effort has gone into it you can't help but love it. Its twisted plot and  visual humour make it an unstoppable tour de force, especially after a  boozy night on the town! This edition is excellent not only for the film,  but due to the hard work that has gone into creating it.
The picture and  sound quality is astounding, very crisp and clear at all times. There is  even a THX optimode test for those of us who like messing with the telly to  get the best picture and sound.
But its the special features that make  this DVD a must. The Gore the merrier!"" featurette is both informative  and fun to watch, and the extra booklet is highly interesting. The whole  groovy package is wrapped up in a special edition numbered tin. okay, so it  sticks out like a sore thumb amoung the other dvds in my collection, being  a good 1-2 inches taller, but it helps make it more eye-catching.
All in  all a must buy! Groovy film, groovy overall package, groovy quality on all  counts, and at an even groovier price. Later deadheads!

3456589,4,B001AOHPXA,"A rather funny and quite grusome sequel that begins straight after the  first Evil Dead that features Ash (Bruce Campbell) battling possesive demon  spirits in a lonely cabin out in the woods. This movie caused a great deal  of confussion when it was released. The audience never knew if it was  supposed to be a sequel or a remake. The answer is that it is a 'sequel'.  The first Evil Dead movie ended with a close-up shoot of Bruce  Campbell  screaming at the camera (the impression was that he was
being attacked by  an evil spirit). But the second Evil Dead movie starts off with new footage  of Ash going to a cabin with his girlfriend and the whole thing starts all  over again. They were originally going to use the footage from the first  Evil Dead to use in the beginning of Evil Dead 2 to explain the story, but  they were unable to get the rights for the footage so they had to re-film  the footage to use in the beginning of Evil Dead 2. The DVD edition is  definately a must have for the fans of the series. To start it off it is  THX mastered so the picture quality is a big improvement and it features a  great 5.1 Dolby track. It also comes with a really cool featurette that is  very informative and very funny to watch. The video game preview is also  very cool with its superb graphics, the theatrical trailer is just like any  theatrical trailer and it comes with two commentary tracks. You don't have  to be an Evil Dead fan to enjoy this edition, it can appeal to anyone who  appreciates thrilling action, horror, comedy or just really cool DVDs.",968803200,,1568,4.356401384083045
3456590,5,B001AOHPXA,"First off, the movie will stand the test of time as far as cult classics  are concerned.  Yeah it's full of gore but the blood is green and black and  bright red, so it's different then the slasher films you see in the  multiplex these days.  Yeah the budget is not Matrix level, but it's still  a better film then movies with huge budgets.  But I want to talk about is  the extra stuff.  On the disc is a halfhour making of which is beautiful.  It has clips from camcorders showing the cast and staff having fun, as well  as how they did the makeup for Henrietta and all the gore.  Also a  homemovie made be the FX guys about a dead baby come back to life.  The  videogame preview is the worst part about the whole thing, and that's just  because it shows the cabin and that's about it.  The commentary is the main  reason you should buy this, much better then the first one because Bruce  and Sam are talking together showing how long and good their frienship is.  All in all it's the reason they make DVD Players.",968198400,,1016,4.219895287958115

Basically the same old, same old, but in about 5 minutes after that the  movie takes a turn and becomes one of the most inventive horror movies of  all time. If you have seen the first one you might be timid about this  installment, but It is totally different then the first one, and about  twice as good. The last 10 minutes are the best part.

3456593,5,B001AOHPXA,"It comes in a groovy little tin with the European poster style on the top and inside has the booklet, a little ad for the video game and the dvd  itself.
The booklet claims to have ""rare photos"", but it's just  pictures from scenes throughout the movie that we've seen before- nothing  special, but has some good insights from the special effects guys and  Bruce.
Now for the DVD
I was really pleased with the extras- the  commentary was a lot of fun- I enjoyed it more than the first Evil Dead  special edition because Sam Raimi actually throws in a lot more tidbits  with Bruce and friends to back him up.  There were no long pauses, everyone  had something interesting to say and it's just a lot of fun listening to  them mock the dialogue and point out the mistakes.  Plus, there's only four  people on the commentary so no one is overwhelmed and we can hear everyone  talking- I think too many people on commentaries can be frustrating.  Also  find out what Kurt Russel's fav. line is from ""Evil Dead 2"" in a  quite hilarious memory Bruce brings up.
""The Gore The Merrier""  featurette was very cool- it's lengthy too so we get to see a lot of the  cool effects being made and used in the final product.  We also see Raimi,  Campbell and the rest of the crew clowning around and also a  ridiculous/funny little skit that the special effects team came up with-  about a baby that comes back from the dead for revenge.  The documentary  was shot with a crappy camera, but back in '86'87- home video cameras  sucked anyway so I wasn't surprised- it's fine though- just a little  grainy.
The theatrical trailer was edited very well- I hadn't seen it  before and I was pretty impressed how spooky they made it.
The video game  preview is awesome- like a teaser trailer, but it's really neat- gotta see  it for yourself.
The bios only consist of Bruce and Raimi, but they're  better than most bios you find on dvds.
Photos- no big deal- some candid  shots.
Widescreen and full screen formats- sweet.  Love it when they have  both.
And...sound is great.  Overall, nearly poi-fect dvd- I just  would've liked some out-takes- cuz we know there was a lot of laughing  going on from the reminiscing we hear on the commentary.
Buy it-  definately worth it- great menu too, pretty much everything is worth  mentioning!",967593600,,2309,4.527980535279806

Most people seem to notice the scene with Ash being attacked  by his own hand, which is an incredible piece of physical comedic acting by  Bruce Campbell, but I actually laughed harder at his being attacked by the  head of his now-deceased girlfriend.  Once again Bruce Campbell's acting is  what makes this scene work.  And, of course, there's the neat little piece  of conversation consisting of one female character telling the man next to  her, ""You're holding my hand to tight,"" along with his reply:  ""But I'm not holding your hand.""

3456599,5,B001AOHPXA,"First off, I would like to say that this movie IS a sequel, and NOT a remake (Bruce Campbell mentioned this in his web site)! The reason why the beginning of this film was kind of similar to what happened in Part 1, was  that they wanted to do a re-cap of what happened in the first  film.
Anyway, this movie continues where the first one left off, where we  see Ash alone at the cabin with the Evil presence. Later, a woman  (accompanied by three other people) arrives, looking for her parents to get  some help translating more pages she found which belongs to the book of the  dead.
Unlike the first one which was pure horror, this one is horror with  a comedic touch. The special effects are excellent (due to the bigger  budget)... The zombies now look more terrifying than ever! A lot of fans  (especially die-hard horror fans) might disagree with me, but I find this  to be the best out of all the Evil Dead trilogy. I strongly recommend this  film.",964569600,,956,4.375
3456600,5,B001AOHPXA,"first off, i wanna tell everyone that saw the first wondering why the hell ash would go back to the evil-infested cabin in the woods, that this is a remake with a better budget. now, as for the film itself, its awesome.  Campbell is not an oscar-contender, but he is perfect for this role. his  possessed hand is a comedic highlight. also to all people confused, Army of  Darkness is a sequel to this one, evil dead 2, because campbell cant go  from screaming at a demon (end of 1) to a slave in the middle ages. i own  it, and so should you.",963187200,,542,4.173076923076923
3456601,5,B001AOHPXA,"Evil Dead 2, unlike its predisessor, manages to stimulate humor within the often shady realm of classic horror.  It's charactors express overacted emmotions, the monsters are obsessively intense, and the plot-line is too  short to be expressed in a complete sentence.  But you know what, that's  the beauty of it all.  The beauty to create a movie that mocks its own  gender.  Yes, a horror movie with an even greater tick.  The ability to  raise suspense, horror, and tension to a level of, almost, playfulness. Now  don't get me wrong, Evil Dead 2 is not a movie that raises even the lowest  form of phylisophical issues, but it is an enjoyable masterwork of nifty  cinematography and compelling suspense that is anything but classic.  The  acting is excellent, in which the actors and actresses seem to play their  obsene roles with a sense of dignity.  Some of the camera techniques in the  movie are arguably the best I've ever experienced. The possessed monsters  create even more tension and possibility, but not enough as to take the  story really seriously.  Every scene conveys an obviouse delight for  cinematic adventure.  More importantly, the hero Ash, a Rambo/Mad Max  charactor, remains the bulk of the film.  With his jerky wit (not too  jerky) and ignorant macho attitude, its no wonder why this original figure  holds such high standerds in the indi culture.  The other charactors (and  their relationships) adjust to the absurd atmosphere perfectly, with their  cheesy ""horror lines"" and cocky reactions.  The whole feature is  just a heap of creative genous, nothing more.  Anyone who has an urge for  destructive horror with a humorous beat, will be more than satisfied to  view every pixel this film has to offer.  The blood level is above the  charts and the action is magestically in-sinch.  Sound is average, as well  as the picture quality, but isn't enough to complain about.  I give this  movie full credit for occomplishing its purpose, however simple that task  may be.  See it to believe it folks; buy it to believe it again and again.

Raimi and Co. could not get the stock footage from the first Evil Dead, so they  decided to re-shoot the movie as a remake of sorts. I would say that ED2 is  more of a black comedy than a horror movie, but it still carries enough  scares to be good. The character of Ash comes into his own in this movie.  It is a great movie alone or to be watched after viewing Evil Dead, but be  prepared. If you are view both of them for the first time, it can be a tad  confusing, but all in all I would recommend these movies to anyone.",960768000,,667,3.8676470588235294

Army of Darkness as a horror movie made a  fairly mindless but likeable comedy...Raimi waited til A Simple Plan to  really infuse suspense back into his flix. The happy median is this ED2,  with smarter humor and appeal than the third (the  hiding-behind-a-door-to-outrun-an-evil-entity trick comes to mind) but with  enough suspense for those who remembered when Linda was not Bridget Fonda.  Heck, Raimi even throws in the proverbial kitchen sink (well, it's an oven)  at the end. If you really want to shop SMart, choose Evil Dead 2.",960508800,,707,4.890756302521009

3456613,4,B001AOHPXA,"How a directorial debut for a college student named Sam Raimi could result in what is perhaps the most frightening movie ever made is beyond me.  The Evil Dead is an example of pure horror.  It's plot and script aren't  impressive, but the visuals, direction, great camerawork, and impressive  lead performance make for a wild ride filled with numerous jump scenes,  shocks, and scares that are hard to find these days.
By now, most  everybody who is a fan of cult classics should know The Evil Dead's plot.  Five college students, including Ash (Bruce Campbell), take a vacation to  the woods in Tennessee.  They relax in an old cabin where they find a book  in the cellar.  It seems an archaeologist lived in this cabin and he found  this book, entitled the Necronomicon from his archaeological digs.  The  five friends play a tape recorder that chants passages from the  Necronomicon and thus awakens the evil dead, bringing the evil spirits  alive and possessing the students one by one.
The Evil Dead is by no  means a character driven piece like The Exorcist or The Sixth Sense, but  that doesn't mean we don't for the characters.  As a matter of fact, the  lead performance from Bruce Campbell is stellar.  His character Ash is  believable in the situations he's in and there's no form of manic  exaggeration that's found in the sequels.
This may perhaps be the best  directorial debut film I have ever seen.  Sam Raimi knows how to make a  movie.  He can take a weak script and turn into a frightfest (and  gorefest).  He hasn't really made a horror film since this one though his  mainstream attempts are also good.  I still would like to see him make  another horror movie, but not an Evil Dead 4.  I don't really think sequels  should have been made to this film.  That's not to say I didn't enjoy them.  Evil Dead 2 was mediocre but Army of Darkness was very funny and  entertaining.  I think the way The Evil Dead ended with its spectacular  (and quite freaky) final scene was a good way to end it.

This is horror  comedy at its most outrageously funny, filled with the gruesome and macabre  but still managing to provide endless humour - Ash's possessed hand attacks  its owner, trees and plants come alive, Ash's girlfriend becomes a comic  ghoul.

3456618,5,B001AOHPXA,"In this movie which is a remake more or less of the first film, Sam Raimi has figured out what was missing from the first film: THE HUMOR. Our hero Ash (Bruce Campbell) Takes his girlfriend Linda to a cabin in the woods,  where he awakens something evil in the woods. Sounds like the first film,  but this is different. The daughter of the owner of the cabin has to get to  the cabin to see her father not knowing he is allready dead, with pages  from the Book Of The Dead her father has been searching for, for years.  There is a great headless woman dance scene, ane the classic Ash fighting  with his own hand. Bruce Campbell is a master at this kind of film. Very  good indeed!",949190400,,681,4.1923076923076925

This one basically cuts out a lot of what happened in the first Evil Dead movie; some of the characters are deleted, and it takes a few minutes to realize what is going on. Still  though, this one has more of a comedic spin than the first one. Ash and his  girlfriend travel to a cabin in the middle of nowhere to spend a few days,  and accidentally end up unleashing the evil spirits that surround the  woods.  Then when help finally arrives, the trouble starts all over again, and Ash finds himself in a climactic battle with the ultimate incarnation of evil, before being sucked into a timehole and landing right in the Middle Ages. Make sense?  Of course not! But who cares!

This is like one big crazy  violent carnival ride, much more of an ""art"" film than the boring  Swedish landfill that critics seem to adore.  Come on, this was called the  best film of the last 15 years by Spin Magazine back in 1994, and if I  remember correctly, that means that it beat out 5 Spielberg films.  It's a  good, fun movie starring my absolute favorite B-actor, Bruce Campbell (who  incidently, is very nice and sent me an autographed picture and a personal  E-mail a long time ago).

Now the 2nd film starts off with him driving to the  cabin. But he IS NOT returning to it. This film makes it seem like there  never was a fird ED film. ED2 still really picks up where ED left off, but  Mr. Raimi added the footage of going to the cabin so the audience would not  be completely lost.  ED2 really starts off with Ash flying through the sky.  and it ends with him landing in Medieval times.  AoD(Army of  Darkness)picks the story up just as he comes out of the vortex. That's the  problem with having 3 different distributors.  Now I did a bit of editing.  I got all 3 films and put them together into one continuous film.  And it  is great.

8278370,3,B001AOHPXA,"RELEASED IN 1987 and written & directed by Sam Raimi, The Evil Dead chronicles events when two Michigan State students (Bruce Campbell & Denise Bixler) travel to a remote cabin in western Tennessee for spring break wherein they discover a copy of the Book of the Dead and an audiotape whose incantations resurrect demons in the woods. The daughter of the archeologist who made the tape (Sarah Berry) also visits the cabin with her beau (Richard Domeier) and a couple of dubious locals (Dan Hicks & Kassie Wesley DePaiva).

The first film was low-budget, cartoony and extreme, but it was serious horror. This sequel is also cartoony and extreme, but its decidedly comedy horror. Its entertaining for what it is, but its hindered by a confusing opening recap that doesnt match the previous film. Raimi stated that he didn't have the rights to use material from the original movie so he did a 7-minute recap with only two people instead of five (with Denise Bixler taking over the role of Linda). But there are other inconsistencies: The Book of the Dead and audiotape is found in a room rather than the basement and Ash (Campbell) later rediscovers that the bridge is out, which he already knew via events in the first film.

Once you get past the awkward and perplexing set-up, the movie settles into an entertaining over-the-top gory horror comedy, which is so creative its as if it was made by a lunatic. Bixler is a great replacement in the role of Linda, but her part is too brief and you only catch glimpses of her stunning beauty. It took me a while to warm up to Annie (Berry), but I eventually did and shes a worthy secondary protagonist. There are several amusing and thrilling sequences, like the demonic hand scenes.

THE FILM RUNS 1 hour & 24 minutes and was shot in Wadesboro and (studio) Wilmington, North Carolina, with supplementary work done in Detroit. ADDITIONAL WRITER: Scott Spiegel.
