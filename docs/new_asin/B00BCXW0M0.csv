8566507,5,B00BCXW0M0,"This is an interesting episode, something I don't know a lot about, but one that concerns us all.  It deals with people who go on a rampage and kill others.  The ones discussed in this episode are mostly the children who shoot up schools, and there are only a few examples of that. There are, of course, far more people that do go off on a killing spree and this program does not (and cannot) address them all.

It deals with the more high-profile cases but does make an effort to be thorough:  there are researchers who study the genetic backgrounds, especially things that can affect behavior, especially aggressive behavior.  As you might guess, there are many people who fit this profile that never go on a rampage.  It is certainly a complex problem, with no really good way to predict who will and who will not ""go off"".  They point out that many of the ones who do go on a rampage are picked on or depressed.  I suppose it would be helpful to have someone at schools who was good at talking to and listening to kids as well as training them in the use of firearms.  Whether that would help or not, I cannot say; but it may be worth the effort.",1425427200,,1150,4.311627906976744
8566508,5,B00BCXW0M0,"A phrase in Barack Obama's first inaugural speech should be re-iterated more frequently: ""Judged on what you build, not what you destroy."" When an individual or a society is put in a position such that he/she/they feel there is simply nothing to look forward to for them to be productive, could the only perceived alternative then is to destroy? In the documentary, scientists are looking for clues in people's brains, which are labeled as ""suicidal"" or prone to ""blind rage"". Perhaps they should be looking for what is not there: hope.

This ""blind rage"" seems to happen at all levels of human organization: from the individual, at any age, to an entire society as a whole. From murder to genocide, there is much study about the aftermath, but very little about the events prior. We see in this documentary how young children are kicked around by other children. Are whole societies kicked around by other societies, too? What happened before some Germans killed eight million Jews? What happened before the Hutu peoples killed the Tutsi? What happened before the Maori decimated the Moriori?
Mistreatments, isolation, distancing, silence, excuses of ""their choice"", lying by omission are proverbial dusting under the rug that reach thresholds sooner or later. We, the humans, must never let fellow humans, no matter where they are, or who they are, or how old they are, fall below the threshold of hope.

For millennia, religions have tried to provide hope (true or false, hope, nevertheless) for people as a tool to survive.  Andrew Carnegie spent a lot of his money building public libraries in the United States to give people a chance to self-educate so that they can uplift themselves from the merciless vise of poverty. This has worked greatly and has contributed to making this country the greatest power economically and militarily. Bill Gates is spending a lot of his money to keep people live longer, and he supports innovative educational programs to help people figure out how to be productive.

But these are only partial solutions to the World's problems, as well as in the United States. These solutions can be blocked by the human brain, which is something we know so little about. Mental illness caused by drugs, fraud, or otherwise, is a challenging set of problems whose surface is barely scratched, as it is discussed in this documentary.
Please watch this documentary.",1383609600,,2391,5.0
8566509,2,B00BCXW0M0,"I regularly watch Nova episodes and this was the worst one I've ever seen from a relevance to claimed subject matter perspective.  Most of this documentary covers factors relevant to habitual criminals, not to normally peaceful individuals who suddenly go on a shooting rampage.  The one specific rampage case covered was one where school bullying was clearly the motivation whereas the most deadly of the recent rampages had no such obvious trigger.  The child with rage issues since birth was also irrelevant to most rampage shooting incidents since most other perpetrators didn't exhibit such behavior prior to their rampage.  However, the tool box filled with his prescription medications provided an important clue that wasn't even mentioned let alone discussed.

Ridiculous levels of medical privacy prevent answers to some of the most important questions that can be asked after these rampage shootings - ""What, if any, psychotropic, mind chemistry altering prescription drugs was this person taking, just stopped taking unsupervised, or changed the dosage of unsupervised prior to the incident.""  At least one of the families who lost a child at Sandy Hook has officially ask for an evaluation of this privacy policy, a policy which is even more obviously ridiculous when, as is currently done, it is still enforced even after the rampage shooters are dead!

The probable answer to the questions, ""Why are there increasingly frequent rampage shootings and why is suicide, as reported by the CDC, the leading cause of violent death in the U.S.?"" can likely be found in the explosive increase in selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitor (SSRI) anti-depressant drug prescriptions issued to both adults and, especially, children since 1990.

From a 2003 study in the International Journal of Risk & Safety in Medicine:

""Evidence from many sources confirms that selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) commonly cause or exacerbate a wide range of abnormal mental and behavioral conditions. These adverse drug reactions include the following overlapping clinical phenomena: a stimulant profile that ranges from mild agitation to manic psychoses, agitated depression, obsessive preoccupations that are alien or uncharacteristic of the individual, and akathisia. Each of these reactions can worsen the individual's mental condition and can result in suicidality, violence, and other forms of extreme abnormal behavior. Evidence for these reactions is found in clinical reports, controlled clinical trials, and epidemiological studies in children and adults. Recognition of these adverse drug reactions and withdrawal from the offending drugs can prevent misdiagnosis and the worsening of potentially severe iatrogenic disorders. These findings also have forensic application in criminal, malpractice, and product liability cases."" - from ""Suicidality, violence and mania caused by selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs): A review and analysis""; International Journal of Risk & Safety in Medicine 16 (2003/2004) 31-49 31, IOS Press

If you read about the reported personality traits of the three recent and most deadly 2012 rampage killers, they all show very clear signs of Asperger Syndrome, a form of autism where SSRI anti-depressants are commonly prescribed.  So WHY isn't this obvious possible connection getting any mainstream media or government attention whatsoever or, at the very least, coverage in a supposedly scientific investigatory program like Nova?

Do a YouTube search for ""The Drugging of Our Children"" (posted by TruthTube1111) and watch at least the first one minute and twenty seconds of that video.  Then read ""Anatomy of an Epidemic: Magic Bullets, Psychiatric Drugs, and the Astonishing Rise of Mental Illness in America"" or watch the author's excellent video related to it via a YouTube search for ""Psychotropic Drugs and Children"" (posted by scienceforpublic).

Finally, we know from studies like ""Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors and CYP2D6"" that the inability to properly metabolize SSRIs is a genetic trait in some individuals and, yet, for some reason, no questions are publicly raised when we see recent headlines like ""'Like an airborne disease': Concern grows about military suicides spreading within families.""  Were family members, depressed by the suicide of a family member and genetically related to them, taking SSRI anti-depressants themselves? Possibly.",1361404800,9,4419,5.644042232277527
