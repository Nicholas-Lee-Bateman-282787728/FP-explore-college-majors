8163319,5,B000LPV0ZI,"Excellent movie.  There is another called ""Curtin"" that you can view on youtube (period Oct41 to Feb42) but this covers a far longer period from September 41 to early 43.  Sometimes watching these movies makes you wonder who you are fighting against, other Allies or the Axis. But this makes them so interesting.  After all, all countries have their own wishes, wants and thoughts on how things should go (Democracy in action), and this movie shows the battle for strategy, respect and diplomatic intrigue very well.",1481328000,,516,4.976744186046512
8163320,5,B000LPV0ZI,I enjoyed this film over 15 years ago and have not been able to find it since. The politics of the second world war from the viewpoint of Australia was eye opening. The dynamics between England and the rest of the British Empire were brilliantly portrayed in the movie. It was one of those rare films that I wished would not end. The acting was terrific! Whoever owns this movie should put it out on DVD or get it out again in someway. This is a movie masterpiece and it is a shame that more people are not able to see it due to the only medium (VHS)it is on.,1368748800,,559,4.090909090909091
