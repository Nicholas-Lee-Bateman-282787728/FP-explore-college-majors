8666108,5,B00LIBI2A0,A must watch! Kids are underprivileged in a tough neighborhood in South Bronx are up against a 50% graduation rate. They are given the opportunity to learn award winning debate skills. I really enjoyed the gritty true life story of innocent kids in a tough neighborhood and a mentor/debate coach from a very successful white collar world commits to teaching debate skills to kids that are just trying to survive.  My heart felt for these kids and you get attached to their personal challenges and growth towards success by learning debate skills.,1452988800,,546,4.934782608695652

I learned a TON about debate and what it can do in both social and educational spheres.  Like all good docs, you learn a lot but it doesn't feel like a chore.  As Bill Cosby once said, ""Be careful, or you just might learn something.""",1408406400,2,346,4.276923076923077
