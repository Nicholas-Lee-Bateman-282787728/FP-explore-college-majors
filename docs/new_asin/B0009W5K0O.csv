8067855,5,B0009W5K0O,"The Koala Bros whole series is brilliant for preschoolers. All the main characters have flaws, but all of them are likeable. Some childrens shows have annoying characters - without any redeeming features, but not the Koala Bros.

What I like most about this series is that there is a real Story - there's a theme, a point, and some action in every show. It's imaginative and it's all friendly.

Plus the music is catchy and the sounds don't wear on your ears - like other kids shows often do after the 54th play (which is where we are up to in our house).

If I had to only pick ten DVD's for my kids, the Koala Bros series would be on the list. The animation is as good as Bob-the-Builder, and the shows are less 'teachy'. The points about character flaws and dilemmas are very apt for the age-group.",1227830400,2,801,4.3624161073825505
8067856,5,B0009W5K0O,"The Koala Brothers series is fun, original, and a great choice for families.  The characters are nice ""people"" (okay, echidnas, koalas, tortoises, etc.!), but not perfect.  They learn important lessons in each episode.

The claymation in this series is adorable.  The animal characters are interesting and endearing.  This is a series with good values, yet it doesn't take a preachy approach.  Instead, it just illustrates some dilemmas which kids can face, and shows the characters learning from experience how to handle these situations.  It also is really based around the idea that in life we should ""always try to help!""-- what a great message to reinforce.

Best of all (?!), unlike many programs for kids the Koala Brothers series is NOT torture for adults to watch this series with kids-- you'll find it entertaining, too.",1203033600,8,830,5.0962962962962965
