Let me set u all straight!
The 5 tracks ANTHRAX plays are 100% spot on as is 2 and a half tracks of the 4 Songs OVERKILL plays all amazing impossible footage to find and to have it as clear man a true metal fan would be happy with just the ANTHRAX songs I myself think it a great buy for vintage Metal Hammer fest.  Footage. And pray vol. 2 comes out.  Cheers to whomever really released this footage I have only seen bootlegs of that were crap quality from the 80s. Lol
So all fans of Anthrax. Also overkill.  Will love this footage.  Agent Steel perhaps not but I enjoyed it never seen there footage before even tho the mix is 2 or 3 seconds outta sink I can say they gained a fan.  True .. no holds barred review.  Cheers.",1487030400,,774,4.026143790849673

I had preordered this dvd as soon as Amazon offered it up and anxiously waited for it to be released. Being a huge fan of all three bands from when they started and collecting their entire catalog of releases (and then some) over the years, I was dying to relive the early days of speed/thrash metal. When the dvd arrived I popped it in the player, cranked up some simulated surround sound (to get that small club echo and vibe, and since this was not remixed) waited for the picture to emerge on the large screen and the sound to start blasting through the speakers... and when it finally did, my anticipation quickly turned to disappointment. The audio & video were so far out of sync it reminded me of the early Japanese Godzilla movies with English voices that never really matched up to the character's moving lips (actually those were more in sync). I thought, and hoped, this would quickly correct itself.... WRONG!!! To hear a singer sing while his mouth is closed and to see his lips moving while the words have already hit my ears (or maybe it was the other way around), and to see a musician totally shredding out on his guitar and not have the notes or riffs even come close to what I'm watching is beyond frustrating. I skipped through a bunch of titles by the 3 different bands and needless to say it didn't get much better.

I wasn't expecting this dvd to be spectacular due to when it was shot and I figured there was much of an original budget... so a decent picture and good synced up stereo sound is what I was counting on, but they couldn't even deliver that. I'd have to be slammed senseless in a mosh pit for this dvd to be even somewhat enjoyable... and it's a damn shame because it was obviously an amazing performance from all three legendary bands at the beginnings of their career.

Good ole Amazon let me return it for a refund since there was no way I would ever be able to enjoy the disc. That's why Amazon is the greatest online store for everything. Hopefully one day someone will PROPERLY mix this concert (maybe even into 5.1) and I'll be able to relive those great early days from 3 of metals finest.

Until then, do yourself a favor and DON'T BUY THIS!!!!",1310169600,5,2306,4.444444444444445
8431641,2,B004J4T1KI,Cool old school concert but the Audio / Video  are off for the first half of the concert. This recording is from a VHS tape.,1304899200,6,124,3.96
8431642,3,B004J4T1KI,"Definately a VHS transfer, right down to the soundbars at the bottom of the screen. A couple of seconds out of sync, I could probably done a better transfer myself using my home DVR. An exellent release majorly let down by cheap transfer to DVD. Would have been much better if it was remastered from the original mastertape.",1304812800,5,324,4.603448275862069
