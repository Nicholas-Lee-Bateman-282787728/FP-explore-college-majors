8260508,1,B0015YV766,I was given the wrong dvd had nothing to do with kayaking,1483920000,,57,3.8333333333333335
8260509,5,B0015YV766,Great video with lots of great information.,1430352000,,43,5.285714285714286
8260510,3,B0015YV766,wasn't that much about fishing as I thought it would be. More just basics.,1421280000,,74,4.357142857142857
8260511,2,B0015YV766,"I thought the information was just too general and basic. It's an okay video, but I don't think it's worth the $20 that I paid for it.",1320537600,,134,4.0
8260512,4,B0015YV766,"This video is about choosing and using a kayak for fishing. It is not a how to fishing video. That said it is a very good video about using a kayak for fishing! I've been float tube fishing for over 10 years, but after my first kayak ride I realized it had some big advantages. I also realized fishing from a kayak was going to take some real basic instruction. In comparison kayaks can seem unstable, just getting in them is tricky. This video even covers that and more. All good basic information about how to use a kayak for fishing. This video gave me all the information I wanted. Highly recommended for the fisherman interested in learning to use a kayak!",1282867200,,661,4.426229508196721
8260513,5,B0015YV766,"I've been into kayak fishing for years now, recently sold the exact boats they use in this book and dvd (I have both).  The cool thing is that newbies will love it...but even to the experienced kayak fisherman...if you look close (or read closely in the book) you will find new ways to use your boat, rig it, or even how to fish an eddy sitting crossways on your boat using your feet to hold you in the current.",1258588800,,411,4.2025316455696204
8260514,1,B0015YV766,"If you're going to call something ""Kayak Fishing The Ultimate Guide"" shouldn't there be some fishing?  90% of this DVD focused on Kayaks, Equipment, and safety, which while very important, some fishing techniques would have been nice.  I already have my yak, my life vest and all the accessories you could want.  What I wanted to get out of this video was some different fishing techniques.  I was very dissapointed, if anything it was the ultimate guide to basic kayaking, with people fishing.",1218412800,,494,4.9156626506024095
8260515,3,B0015YV766,"The title should be ""Fishing on a Wilderness Kayak.""
The DVD was well done and there is a lot of useful information on it.",1216771200,,122,4.125
