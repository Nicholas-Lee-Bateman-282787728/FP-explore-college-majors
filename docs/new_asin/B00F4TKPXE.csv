If you're already familiar with Eko Eko Azarak, then no introductions are necessary. If not, this may be new to you.

But essentially Misa is a wizard/witch, who uses her powers to fight evil. It often involves her attending various high schools.

In this story, several of her friends are captured by an evil coven, bent on sacrificing them. The plan is more of a way to get back at Misa. Misa is tricked by the coven's simple deception and loses faith in her ability to challenge them.

It isn't until she learns more about how to take the coven on from her uncle, that she finds the confidence to save her friends.

That's the jist of the story. As far as the execution goes, this is a very low budget production. It's best to realize that before going in.

Things to keep your eye out for are...

Misa's shrunken parents.

The Ox Ritual, involving Misa hammering a voodoo doll into a tree.

Misa turns into a giant spider during a spell.

The coven captures the girls and taunts Misa as they hang from a tree.

Girls floating off into the sky on magic ropes.

I like Misa stories in general. This one is very basic in execution and production value. I wouldn't suggest trying this unless you like quirky J Horror or you're a fan of anime.

The concept of Misa being a traveling wizard is a good one. That premise has always been a great staple for the series.

Tech aspects include the film in Japanese only with English subtitles.

Three stars is my rating. That may be a little generous, but I like the Misa character. It's a slightly darker world of magic than the world of Harry Potter.",1505606400,,1651,4.402640264026402
