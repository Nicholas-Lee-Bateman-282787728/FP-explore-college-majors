8235047,5,B000Z8H1Z4,"If you're a fan of Richard Simmons's enthusiastic videos this is a good addition to your collection.  It takes a few run-throughs to get the steps down pat, but once you do it's a quick way to work up a sweat.  More & more studies show we should KEEP MOVING, do whatever u can to fight ""chairitis"".  Sitting too much is not good for one's health.

Nothing overly strenuous here, just easy moves with a group--almost like being there!  Add Richard's usual infectious enthusiasm & you've got a winning combo.",1394409600,,506,4.5777777777777775
