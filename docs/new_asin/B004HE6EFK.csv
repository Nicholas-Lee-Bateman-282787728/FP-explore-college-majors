4375609,5,B004HE6EFK,What a great story about a gentle spirit. In this day and age inspirational figures like Solanus Casey are more important than ever to remind us of our need to love one another and return to God.,1394755200,2,195,4.297297297297297
4375610,5,B004HE6EFK,"This movie depicted someone who struggled with learning, in the world's point of view not a very academic person.  Today parents push the academics so much in their children and forget about the spiritual welfare of the child.  Solanus Casey simply accepted his limitations humbly and always trusting in God's love.  He heroically accepted God's love for who he was and rejected the world's point of view about him.  He finally found his calling as a Priest, but with limited faculties again and accepted and surrendered these limitations to God.  He permitted God's love to permeate all he did.  True testimony of God's gifts to those who love him in the little things and in their weaknesses and limitations.  And how God can turn our limitations into joy.",1391299200,9,758,4.875

Very interesting!",1386892800,7,341,5.339622641509434
4375613,5,B004HE6EFK,"Another edifying installment from Ignatius Press, Solanus Casey; Priest, Porter, Prophet documents the life of an extraordinary man in whom holiness was personified. It is a story of a soul that has for the most part, until now, remained hidden from the world, and thus this documentary has become to us, a true revelation.

The story begins with a remarkable account of a young prison guard who befriends the notorious outlaw Cole Younger. This encounter with this young, kind and gentle prison guard, named Bernard Francis Casey, who was eager to listen to Younger, would forever leave an impression on this man of violence. From here we discover who Casey was, his family history with the story of his Irish parents emigrating to America, the life the Casey family led. Most importantly of course are the events in Bernard Casey's life that was directed by the very hand of God towards sanctity, finally leading him to the Capuchin Franciscans and adopting the religious name Solanus.

What is really fascinating was the extreme humiliation and suffering with which it pleased God to bestow upon Father Casey.  However it was Fr. Casey's acceptance with humility of those same sufferings which endeared him to God and to achieve a most intimate union with Him. And through this union we see the graces bestowed on this holy man that of being a Prophet and a wonder worker, and a magnate to thousands of souls, given to no other, no matter how clever or learned.

Miracles galore are recounted in this show, associated with healings, multiplications and protection from dangers. Also the viewer can actually see Fr. Casey from historical archival footage and photos and actually listen to his voice. Friends, fellow friars and family members retell theses accounts with great emotion. Among those interviewed is Fr. Benedict Groeschel, previously of EWTN, who knew Fr. Casey personally and was a witness to an outstanding miracle.
Beyond all this we see a saintly, elderly man who had the soul of a giant and yet the simplicity and innocence of a child, who was in love with God and His creation and who trusted Him in all things.

An added bonus is that we see the live footage of the exhumation of Fr. Casey some thirty years after his death much to the amazement of doctors and those present.

A most beloved servant and priest of Christ, a blessed child of the Blessed Virgin Mary, and worthy son of St. Francis of Assisi, this documentary will truly inspire its viewers on the road towards personal sanctity.

This documentary is 90 minutes long in English without subtitles or special features.

N.B. There is a very little known fact that Fr. Solanus Casey met another holy porter in the summer of 1935. The latter was none other than St. Andre of Montreal of the Saint Joseph Oratory.

8429487,5,B004HE6EFK,"I adore this  movie! It gives a very comprehensive overview of Venerable Fr. Solanus Casey and his very interesting history, as well as not only photos, but snippets of audio and video of him! (He is indeed a TERRIBLE violin player, who played with great joy and much love for the baby Jesus!  Which is quite adorable!) He is the epitome of great men who have lived hidden and humble lives. Someone who had every disadvantage, who could have easily sat back and moaned ""it's not fair"", but instead he lived with joy and gratitude, and every day he reminds me to do the same. I truly wish I could be even just a little bit more like him! Brought up in a rural farm area, with a very basic elementary school education, Barney Casey was no one's idea of priest material. He would quit school at the drop of a hat to go work the farm if his family needed help, so he didn't have much of an education. He worked as a prison guard, an on a trolley car, and it was on the trolley car that he had a life-changing revelation when he saw a woman murdered right in front of him, and couldn't even offer her comfort. Somehow the horror of that moment changed him and made him want to be a priest. In the area he was from all the seminaries were run by Germans, and of course in those days you had to know Latin. Poor Barney Casey knew neither. He got the lowest grades in his class in the academic subjects, although he was stellar in his theology. They still thought he was stupid, and they booted him out. He might have gone home to be a farmer, but he later said that he clearly heard a voice telling him ""Go to Detroit"", and he interpreted that to mean to go to the Capuchin Friars there and try again, so rather than bewailing the ""lost years"" of his life at the first seminary, he tried again. The results weren't much better - his academic grades were terrible, but his spirituality was clear, and verbally he could talk your ears off on any point of theology you'd like to discuss with him. The decided to go ahead and ordain him a priest - but he was severely limited, and he was told that he could NEVER request to have his faculties changed - he could say Mass, but he could not hear confessions, he could not give homilies. His superiors never knew what to do with him, so they would make him the Doorkeeper, and have him to Holy Society enrollments. And people would flock by the hundreds to line up and talk to him. Just talk. They'd wait in line just to speak to him, to ask him to pray for them. The poor man probably had to explain a million times that he couldn't hear their confession, but he was humble, and never bitter - ""we must give thanks to the Good God"", he would say, and ""Give thanks ahead of time for everything God sends our way, whatever it is, no matter what."" He understood that no matter what it might be, God took care of us, and would watch over us, and was there even in our times of trouble, to strengthen us. This is a great film if you need inspiration, or a quiet time of meditation. I highly recommend it to anyone.",1431993600,6,3046,4.214041095890411
8429488,5,B004HE6EFK,Brought me to tears.  Truly a great man and an amazing story done well.,1427155200,,71,4.071428571428571
8429489,5,B004HE6EFK,"Inspiring. Moving. Intriguing.  ...and that's just the documentary.  The man himself, Venerable Solanus Casey, humbly channeled for God countless miracles.  A giving life lived so simply, it remains a powerful example of being as close to the Creator as possible during our earthly stay.  Without a doubt, these last few generations, so riddled with narcissism, truly need to know this holy man.

A friend to many while living, now Solanus can be a friend to all from heaven.  That said, if you have an illness or some other trouble in your life, ask him to pray for you.",1424995200,2,571,4.775510204081633
8429490,5,B004HE6EFK,"I would highly recommend this to everyone believer non believer. Here was a man who embodied the love of Jesus,who is God and man. The way Jesus worked through him truly truly beautiful. Solanus had deep love for Our blessed mother and total loyalty to the Holy Father and deep love for Jesus in the Blessed Sacrament. Godbless you all",1410220800,2,335,4.6
