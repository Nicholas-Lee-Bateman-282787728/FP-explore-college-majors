I am a black woman and I purchased a couple of the other videos that were suppose to teach me how to strip for my man, but none of them spoke to me like this one did. The music in this video is great!!! It motivated me and made me want to move.  Not only did I learn all the moves like the spread eagle, crawl, hoola hoop and lots of others, but i also learned the importance of eye contact and self confidence. It was also refreshing to see the everyday women actually perform at the end of the video for their husband. I also like the  host of the video Stacii Jae and her interview with the exotic dance instructors about what men had shared with them that they want more of from their wives and girlfriends. She was down to earth and fun to watch. I would recommend this video to every woman out there.",1105920000,19,905,4.136363636363637

8030190,4,B0002PEPG8,"I had been eyeing this DVD for atleast 2 years now but never got it until now because I basically spent the last 2 years pregnant but I finally got it and I'm glad I did, especially since I haven't been feeling as sexy lately after having my 2nd child 3 months ago.  This DVD is great for any woman who wants to learn some basic moves as a starting off point to pleasing your man.  The teachers in the video were very patient and encouraging with the 2 students and most times I felt as though they were talking to me as well.  I couldn't wait to start trying some of the moves.  It would have been nice to see a little more step by step instructions on some of the moves but overall it was a great DVD.  I especially liked one of the songs from the DVD called ""Extasy.""  That would be a great song to strip to for your man.  I definitely recommend this DVD.",1188518400,2,858,4.041420118343195
8030191,3,B0002PEPG8,"This is a 90 min video with an extra 7 min Girl Talk.

The menu selections are intro (host on cover pic asking men on street if they would like their wives to take up strip classes to dance only for them) 5 min, meet the 2 students (one slim, one very heavy) 2 min, meet the instructors (Sasha & Alex) 2 min, makeovers 6 min, lesson time (it's all about you, pole 101, props, work it, lets make it clap I, pushup, crawling, showgirl, bounce, make it clap II) 60 min, performances by the 2 dancers 20 min, students perform 10 min.

There is a lot of talking beforehand & since the class is only 1 teacher & 1 student at a time at a strip club during lesson time, it's very relaxed. The dancers were very sweet & encouraging which is what I loved. The production value is good, though a lot of over the top effects here & there.

There weren't many moves shown, a lot of touching yourself, push up with arched back on floor, making your butt clap by shaking your legs like you are freezing, crawling on the floor, rubbing your back against the pole, spread your legs, etc.

The lack of moves is offset by the great detailed & sweet nature of the dancers. The lessons are shown showing the students learning just like a real class. You get to see both students try all the moves.

The performances at the end by the students were well done.

Though the dancers were patient, sweet teachers, they move gracefully with great confidence are sexy, their moves repertoire at their performance was very limited & a bit boring. I'm not sure if that's all they can do or only show the moves they taught.

The strip club itself is a bit low style, very low ceilings, which when on the tiny stage the women could touch the ceiling easily standing, so no climbing is possible.

The teachers were great, reminding the students that confidence, not body size, or body part size is the most important, everyone has something to overcome. One dancer's breasts is on the small size, so she showed to bunch up the bikini top to show off the cleavage so looks like spill out which is a great idea or keeping the g-string pulled down halfway down the buttocks. There were great suggestions.

I took off stars for limited moves, bit slow pace, cheesy club, but kept the stars for the sweet dancers teaching style, the very relaxed talking about confidence & not being shy & use of 2 different size women & showing the full costume dances at the end for their husbands.",1179532800,4,2445,4.3915929203539825
8030192,1,B0002PEPG8,"I was very dissappointed in this video. While the title made me think it is what I was looking for, it has NO stripping in it! I wanted tips on how to REMOVE MY CLOTHES. Yes, there are very sexy dance moves I learned, but the entire video has NO stripping.

Also, the only prop they used was a pole. Most people do not have a dance pole in their house. Why not give tips on how to use a chair, a stool, a table, etc in the dance moves? How can I use these common household items in my dance? So that portion was a big waste.

And lastly, the film editing has a lot to be desired. There were many times in the video where the instructor (the dancer) says ""watch this, do this move just like this"" and the camera is a close up on her face only! What move? Do it like how? Or, as another example, the camera is on someone else's face, or on the student. Yes, watching the student at times was helpful as you could see what the attempt looked like by an amatuer who is out of shape, but when the instructor says ""look at this"" I expected the camera to let me see what's she showing!

Also, the audio at times was very poor.",1122595200,30,1119,3.986607142857143
8030193,3,B0002PEPG8,"I would have liked to see more actual instruction on HOW to do the moves correctly. This video used a pole alot, which I don't have. It really stressed on rubbing yourself ALOT. The most of the video was geared towards just swirling around touching yourself.",1118966400,12,258,4.630434782608695
8030194,5,B0002PEPG8,"I am very please with this movie.  I received a bad DVD at first, but the company stepped up and fixed the problem.  So the product was worth the money I spend and the customer service was outstanding.  I would continue to purchase items from this vendor.  Thank you.",1116288000,5,267,4.387755102040816
8030195,5,B0002PEPG8,"If you want to learn how to strip for your man this is the video to buy. It bascially takes regular everyday women to professional dancers that teaches them the basics and some dance moves within a day. The people on their are so wonderful and if you are kind of scared and shy of doing this I bet you buy the end of the video you will not be. After watching it,it would put you in the mood to want to start dancing that second. This is an instructional video but also a confidence builder one too. You must go out and get this video you will not regret it.",1111190400,8,557,4.027027027027027
8030196,5,B0002PEPG8,"A BIG SHOUT OUT to all the ladies who made this DVD/VHS thing happen for regular women. We needed something like this to keep it hot and poppin'. It is one of my favorite DVD's to date. I especially love the Girl Talk at the end. I highly recommend this for all who are into pleasing/teasing, improving and keeping that fire burning. GET YOU AND YOURS A COPY!!!

Hey Ms Jae.",1108425600,15,374,4.267605633802817
8030197,5,B0002PEPG8,"I really loved this dvd also!!  I would strongly recommend it for women who have no idea of how to dance erotically and who want to learn some sexy, basic moves.  Again, this dvd is geared toward an urban audience, but all woman will find this dvd helpful.  The instructors are the best!  They are so encouraging and very specific on how to do the moves.  This dvd is just jam-packed with good ideas on costumes, make-up, hair, etc...  It really covers everything!  The first part of the video is about how the student dancers come to be in the video.  It's slow going if you're anxious to get to the instructional part, but it's worth the wait.  I do hope another video will be made soon.  I'm looking forward to one with more advanced moves and I sincerely hope that they will continue to use women of size.",1106179200,22,809,4.369127516778524
8030198,5,B0002PEPG8,"I was really hesitant to buy this video because I was not sure if it would be instructional or performance related.  This one is definitely instructional and it does an excellent job of teaching women who have never danced erotically how to do so.

The instructors are top-notched and have a very caring and supportive way of telling how to do each move.  Kim is a great dancer to watch and gives good suggestions on how to be confident.  Sasha is a great, patient teacher!  I hope she'll open a studio and share her talent with others.  Alex is a joy to watch and the best pole instructor I've come across yet.  She breaks down the pole movements and makes it so simple to follow.

This video is broken down into parts.  One flaw is that it takes a while to get to the actual instructive parts, but the introductions allow the viewer to hear how other people put ""spice"" into their relationships and we get to meet the students who will learn to dance.  The most fabulous part of this video is that it uses real women.  I love how it uses a sexy, voluptuous woman.  Seeing her learn the dance and blossom into a sexy siren made me feel better about my own very round body. I wish more erotic dance videos would use ""women of size"" like this one!

This video is geared toward an urban audience, but all types of women will be able to learn something from the instructors and the two students.  Their comments helped me to better understand a lot of the moves.  I would suggest that women who get the video just look at it at least twice before attempting the moves.  Listening to the instructors and watching carefully will help even the most reticent women learn a move or two.

Get this video quickly before it sells out!  I wish I had come across it sooner.  It's a great addition to anyone's erotic dance collection.  The performances at the end of the video are inspiring!  The two student dancers really had the look and moves of professional erotic dancers at the end.  I sincerely hope that these ladies who teach in the video---Sasha, Alex and Kim---will do another follow-up one with more advanced moves soon!  I'll certainly be the first to buy it!",1106179200,7,2159,4.451530612244898
