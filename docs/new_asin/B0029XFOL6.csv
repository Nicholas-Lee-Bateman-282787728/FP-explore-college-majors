8358484,4,B0029XFOL6,"""I WAS BITTEN"" is a documentary telling the stories of those that survived nightmarish animal attacks. From sharks and bears to rattlesnakes and spiders, the three episodes on this DVD have a lot to tell.

This DVD kept me intrigued for an hour or so, but not any longer because it only had three short episodes. However, that isn't too much of a problem because it has great replay value. At 19.95, it is kind of expensive for what you get, but if you're wanting a documentary-style program illustrating what happens to the human body when nature attacks, this is for you.",1440115200,2,573,4.617647058823529
