6674551,3,B00NP0N1LC,"I'm certain that these are wonderful documentaries but my disks will not play on my SONY Blu-Ray player at all.  They would not play on an external Blu-Ray drive on my computer.

I've heard nothing but good reviews regarding these discs...I just wish I could watch them!  The seller and Amazon have been great regarding getting a refund.  The seller even has a list of compatible Blu-Ray players so it might be worthwhile contacting them (they are located in Montreal) before purchasing.

I love Gerry Anderson's puppet shows and really wanted to watch these documentaries.  It's not the fault of the company, it's just that some Blu-Ray players are very finicky with disks that originate in the UK, even if they are rated to be region-free.",1419811200,3,741,4.841269841269841
6674552,5,B00NP0N1LC,"Big thunderbirds fan and heard about this documentary so ordered it on amazon. Got the blu ray version and it's fantastic! Nicely packaged with 2 discs - filmed in supermarionation (a lovingly made and informative documentary about the studios that made these iconic puppet shows) and this is supermarionation (a collection of high def episodes of thunderbirds, captain Scarlett, stingray and more complete with vintage commercials and other goodies).
I already gave the thunderbirds box set on blu ray but it was good to get some episodes of the other shoes on high def (the episodes are presented in the original 4:3 aspect ratio, and the doco is in widescreen)
Great quality in high def blu ray! Recommended to any Gerry Anderson fan!",1418428800,2,737,5.0
8679580,5,B00NP0N1LC,"Step back to a time well before CGI, this documentary is fabulous and shows the challenges puppets on a string posed.

A great collection.",1522454400,,138,4.75
8679581,5,B00NP0N1LC,"Not a U.S. release, this collection tells the story of the team that gave children the famous series of TV shows. For the fist time, you get to see and hear those that made it possible to go where no other has, be it outer space, or under the sea, series like Fireball XL-5 or Stingray kept children happily occupied in the '60s. The collection covers all the supermarionation series from its beginning to the end. Rare interviews with the driving force behind the scenes makes it all that much more fun. PLease remember, you will need a multi-zone Blu-ray player to watch this,(They are available on Amazon.com and are not as expensive as you might think) and when you do, even the oldest of these wonderful memories will come back to all you baby boomers.",1489190400,,757,4.573529411764706
8679582,5,B00NP0N1LC,"I'VE BEEN A FAN OF SUPERMARIONATION SINCE FIRST SEEING THUNDERBIRDS BACK IN 1971 ON A 13 INCH B/W TV AT 5:30 AM.  GOT UP EARLY ON SATURDAYS JUSTT TO WATCH IT.

IT WAS JUST COOL!!!!!

NOW, 45 YEARS LATER AND THE SHOWS BEING ON DVD I STILL WATCH THEM.

AND THE'RE STILL COOL!!!!  BUT THE 47 COLOR HD TV AND SURROUND STERO MAKE THEM EVEN COOLER!

To have found this title with interviews and behind the scenes tales of how the various Anderson shows is just a real neat thing.",1471046400,,473,4.2
8679583,5,B00NP0N1LC,"Here we have a 2-disc blu-ray dedicated to the work of UK innovative TV genius Gerry Anderson, and great fun it is too. First of all: make sure the edition you are buying is either FREE/ABC or Region A/1-compatible and will play on your equipment, as many are imported from UK which is in Region B/2.

On the first disc is a documentary film tracing the history of Gerrys involvement in making puppet-based shows for UK TV, from Twizzle and Torchie in the fifties to the gradually more slick and expensive sci-fi based TV spectaculars in the 1960s culminating with Thunderbirds and Captain Scarlet. Most of the original creative crew of writers, puppeteers, model makers and special effects guys are reunited and contribute fond memories of working 7 days a week, anecdotes about Gerry and Sylvia and how every aspect of the shows were thought out and realized.

From the voice-activated solenoid puppets to the special effects of blowing things up with plastic explosives, the amazing sets, the clothes and real-life characters on which the puppets were based it all makes for highly entertaining viewing. These guys must have had a ball when making these shows and their enthusiasm radiates from every minute of running time. Gerrys son Jamie supplies a succinct and good-humoured factual summary of the premise for each series, juxtaposed with Parker and Penelope telling the story of AP Films and Century 21 (in a nice twist, Parker is in charge and tells the story while Penny plays the uninformed fan who asks the questions!).

Choice bits:

 The hilarious history of Gerry dealing with Lou Grade, culminating in Grade buying Gerrys company (for an undisclosed sum, but Gerry was very happy with the deal)

 The brilliant Barry Gray recounting how he composed all the memorable music for the series including the closing songs I wish I was a spaceman and Aqua Marina

 The Thunderbirds theme played by a British Army marching band

 Tales of the outrageous parties the crew threw in the 1960s

 Jamie Anderson explaining his father often referred to the puppets as the little bastards because they seemed to have minds of their own and would never move as he wanted

Disc 2 showcases an episode from each series in HD gloriously restored to pristine condition, complete with introductions by Parker and Penelope and contemporary TV ads from the period.

Overall: highly entertaining, essential TV history from the golden age, priceless.",1469577600,,2442,4.980295566502463
8679584,5,B00NP0N1LC,"This is probably the definitive documentary on the making of the Gerry Anderson shows. I bet it is excellent. I got my blu-ray copy from Amazon UK yesterday. ""This is Supermarionation"" plays fine. It is region A. ""Filmed in Supermarionation"" is not a region A disc. It will not play on US players. It is region B only. I would like to see this title released as a region A title blu-ray. Please.",1459900800,,395,4.424657534246576
8679585,4,B00NP0N1LC,"I'm sure it will be a great film... Unfortunately, I'm in Region 1 and the dvd sent me was Region 2 only. According to the original distributer (not Amazon, who, like me, thought the dvd was playable in All Regions as originally advertised) a Region 1 version is NOT available and are not certain when it will be. A disappointment really becuz there are 1000s of Gerry Anderson fans in Canada. R Wilkes",1429574400,,402,4.52054794520548
8679586,5,B00NP0N1LC,"Like many people of a certain age, I grew up watching Gerry and Sylvia Anderson's shows and have never lost interest in them.  The documentary had a lot of ground to cover, and does so superbly.  A big thank you to everyone involved in its making.",1426291200,,247,4.3478260869565215

8679588,1,B00NP0N1LC,"Like a previous reviewer, I purchased the Blu-ray version here in the US and found I can't play it on any US system, not my Blu-ray or computer.  It definitely should have been made clear in the information that it only works in the UK",1421193600,2,235,4.222222222222222
8679589,1,B00NP0N1LC,"A 1080/50i blu-ray player is required for playback and at least one of the two disks is only for Region B players. You probably need to pass on this one if you are outside England. I can display the package on my bookshelf, but that's about all.",1420588800,,245,4.23404255319149
