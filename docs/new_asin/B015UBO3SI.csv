7452149,5,B015UBO3SI,"I had originally read the manga and really enjoyed it, so I ended up picking this up to see how it was.  I was surprised on how graphic it actually was in the anime.  Of course it being only 4 episodes long, it left out some of the things from the manga, but over all it wasn't that bad.  Really enjoyed it and it did give off the creepy vibe which I actually never get from watching anime.  I had read somewhere that the ending after the credits wasn't translated but it seemed translated in the copy I received.",1456704000,,513,4.151515151515151
7452150,5,B015UBO3SI,"Talk about a pleasant surprise when I wasn't really expecting much.

I'll try to say a thing or two no one's said yet and keep it brief. The OVAs, and actually each episode, seem to get progressively better as you watch them in order, and actually I thought the best part, by far, bar-none-no-contest-wow-that-was-really-freaking-well-presented, was the last part of the final episode. The way the ending is presented is *awesome*. Seriously, the way they play with the visuals and the audio to present that *very last shot* is *SO GOOD*. Just, dude, wow. What a WHAM of an ending they made that. It's so good, it makes every part previous to it just not even close. Watch it at night with good stereo cans on a big set, it's worth it, I'm serious.

The Corpse Party games were always very praiseworthy for their audio bits that complemented the on-screen stuff so well, and that translates to the anime incredibly well. They recommend at the beginning of the games to play with headphones for the full experience, and they're right. They honestly should say the same thing for these four episodes, because the same applies.

I noticed a few people mentioning fan-service being out-of-place here. Well, I can't argue the placement of it wasn't a little strange (like, right before they die, we get an underskirt cam?), but I can only specifically remember two instances of it, and they were brief enough it wasn't too bad. YMMV, but it didn't bother me too much.

Gore-wise, oh, yeah, you get that. No screwing around here, if you like your squick, here's your squick, with all the squish-squash sound effects of ""ick that's actually rather horrifying"" you could ever want. If you ever wanted to see the events of Heavenly Host happen in an anime without them ruining it, they do that, for sure. No pretense here, they know their audience.

Now, it might be worth mentioning some of the translation is different in important areas than the original games. For instance, what's called ""Heavenly Host Elementary"" is ""Tenjin Elementary"". ""Sachiko-Ever-After"" is changed to ""Happy Sachiko"". It's not that these are inaccurate, of course, just different localizations, but it's noticeable.

As a side note, I kinda liked the way the principal was portrayed in the few parts he showed up.

Anyway, for real, this is a surprisingly well-made little companion to the Corpse Party original game. Normally I'd consider it a drag that there's no dub, but the games never got that treatment, either, and it wouldn't be wise to watch this without having played any of the games. After three games in the series total, I've become very used to the original voices by now, even if I just prefer dubs the vast majority of the time.

Now, as you should know, this is a brief Blu-ray. It's four episodes. That's it. Which in a way is very sad, because the quality of them (and the transition to Blu-ray...Nice colors, I can dig it) is truly excellent.

Being a horror movie buff, I thought I'd seen everything at this point, but Corpse Party always had that certain style to it that made it stand out. At the extremes of horror films, you've got A Serbian Film and I Spit On Your Grave for sexual-violence horror, The Descent (original version, not the American theatrical one) for psychological horror, High Tension for bloody spree-killing horror, The Thing, The Hills Have Eyes, and Alien for monster horror, The Last House On the Left (original Craven version) for slice-of-life horror, and then...Corpse Party for ghastly, youth-focused, supernatural violence, which I just can't put in a category, but definitely has its own flavor unlike anything else.

That last part is worth some credit, really. Nothing really has the same flavor as Corpse Party ever has.",1456617600,13,3748,4.860501567398119
7452151,4,B015UBO3SI,"Corpse Party is definitely a good anime, the is very close to the game but there are some differences. I would not recommend it if you don't like gore.",1455840000,,151,4.241379310344827
7452152,4,B015UBO3SI,"Even though it's based off the game and has many good scenes cut out, I can rate this four-parter a four. I believe it is well deserving, but it would have been a five had they not skipped over parts, I found quite enjoyable from the game, so abruptly. This is a good short anime for horror fans and those who have played the game (18+). Either you love it or you hate it, I've found few in-between. :)

I would love it if they would make Book of Shadows into an anime similar to this as well.",1455580800,2,493,4.030612244897959

It's for the horror ghost story enthusiast. Anime we need more like this out here . A lot of tropes are everywhere these days this isn't A typical one at all, I will say honestly this dark morbid wicked story fits well to be unique amid  the rest of ones collection, Not recommend for young kids btw.;)",1455148800,,489,4.136842105263158
7452154,5,B015UBO3SI,"The title of the show speaks for itself. I for one love this type of anime, for adults or ppl that don't mind violence and gore. Bare in mind that It's not for everyone, basically a black and white situation, there is no grey area.",1454112000,,231,4.155555555555556
7452155,2,B015UBO3SI,"First things first.  This show is violent.  Not cartoony violence, like Fist of the North Star, but graphic, gut wrenching, horrific violence. Imagine if Lucio Fulci or Dario Argento made an anime series, then crank it up to 11. There are no cut aways, there is no hinting.  The characters of Corpse Party are brutalized, tortured, dismembered and disemboweled. Most of the violence is inflicted on children, which makes it even harder to watch.  Corpse Party is not for most people. I'm a lifelong horror fan, and I even I found most of what I was seeing near unwatchable at times.  Episode 3, in particular, features some of the most horrific, animated violence I have ever seen, and I highly doubt I will ever revisit this show because of it.

So, if that paragraph didn't instantly make you heave out a resounding ""Nope"", then lets continue.

I'll start with the positives.  The art and animation are very good.  The show is loaded with atmosphere, interesting camera angles, and creepy locations.  Some of the scenes utilize CGI for the backgrounds, and it works very well, giving the camera a free floating feel, and giving the long, shadowy hallways of the school a chilling sense of depth. The character designs, while on the more generic side, are all very distinct, and the characters are easy to tell apart from each other, as each has some distinctive visual trait that sets them apart.  The cast is actually pretty large, so this is pretty important. The pacing is also very strong, with very few slow moments.  While I was deeply disturbed by what I was watching, I was never bored. Horrified and disgusted, but never bored.  At four episodes, Corpse Party is a pretty easy binge watch, and the over all story is interesting enough to keep you coming back to figure out what exactly is going on. Also, unlike a lot of the OVA's I've watched, Corpse Party tells a complete story.  So you won't get to episode 4 and left hanging.  There are also a few bits of dark humor laced in the series, specifically in the 4th episode, which made for two very entertaining ""gotcha"" moments.  I also have to admit that I really got a kick out of the ending.

Now onto the not so good.

First, and this was a big one for me, is the rare but very problematic fan service. While there are no scenes of outright nudity or sex, there are a few underwear shots snuck in.  The problem isn't that these shots were included, but where they were included.  The one that instantly springs to mind (and the one this one made nearly shut the disc off) was right before a character was gorily dispatched.  The scene involved the character being lifted upside down by her legs, and of course her skirt flips up in the process.  Suddenly the camera jumps to a pretty detailed close up of the character's crotch.  It was disturbing and unneeded.

Second, the show is kind of a mess in the story department.  While Corpse Party is never boring, it also seems wildly unfocused.  While the main plot is compelling, there are a few too many side plots.  I understand that Corpse Party is a game adaptation, and the creators were probably trying to include as much content from the game into the series as possible, but with only four episodes, a little bit of editing would have helped a whole lot. When the story does click, it works well, but large chunks of episodes two and three are focused on side stories, and additional characters that don't add much of anything to the main plot.  If this was longer, and had more time to develop those side plots, I would be all for their inclusion, as both seem fairly interesting.  As it is now, though, they aren't given enough time to be fully developed, and end up feeling like half baked filler. Even worse, when the main plot does kick in, the plot twists and revelations feel rushed due to the other plots taking up extra time.  That rush also hampers the emotional impact of certain deaths that occur later on (which all of the characters seemed to bounce back from pretty quickly...)

Finally, as gory and disturbing as Corpse Party is, it isn't scary. It has plenty of atmosphere, and it loads on the shocks for sure, but it is moving so quickly, and so loaded with characters to brutally murder, that it never really gets the chance to slow down and build up that dread that is key to truly scaring the audience. The only episode that really got close to getting the horror movie formula right is the first one, thanks to the story being more focused.  Episodes 2 and 3 are where things start to get out of hand, and while 4 is more successful, the rush to tie up the story kind of steam rolls any type of mood. Also, because most of the extreme violence being dished out in the show is towards children, it can't really achieve the over the top silliness that your average slasher movie would deliver.  So tonally the series just kind of rests on brutal, which is something I'm not a huge fan of.

Overall, I can't recommend Corpse Party.  While the idea behind the show is a good one, there are just too many issues for me to tell someone to go check it out, especially since your average anime viewer would probably run screaming from the room once the gore kicks in. Maybe if the series had more time to tell its story, or at least had a more focused script, it could have been enjoyable.  As is, this show is a hard sell.",1454025600,13,5360,4.50103305785124
7452156,5,B015UBO3SI,It's great! I loved it but its one of thoes things that everyone should watch.  Then never. Watch again because your so disturbed by what you see.  But you secretly want to watch it again,1453680000,2,187,4.314285714285714
7452157,4,B015UBO3SI,"The show itself is quite good, and I'm surprised we even got a Region 1 release of it, seeing as shows like Higurashi never really fared well stateside (that's being newly released on Blu-ray by Sentai Fireworks by the way, go buy it!). As per the disc and content, it's a standard Maiden Japan/Sentai Filmworks/Section 23 release. No alternate cover art (though I will say that the box art design is always excellent), scarce bonus features (this one in particular has none whatsoever, besides some trailers for other shows), and no disc recognition by my PS3. Also missing is the standalone OVA episode ""Missing Footage"", but you're not missing much. There's only one gore scene in that, and it's off camera; the rest of the episode is character introduction and a lead-up to this series. The Blu-ray release makes up for it, however, with crisp HD video, luscious audio, and the best gore around. Stop watching those fansubs and support the official release!",1452643200,6,961,4.901840490797546
7452158,5,B015UBO3SI,"Yes, Yes, YES! THIS is what I've been waiting for! And all of this delicious carnage will be on Blu-Ray, too? Just too good! Now, a tiny disclaimer: I'm slightly biased towards this show because I watched it Halloween Night last year, and it was perfect for the occasion. As far as anime goes, it's easily three stars, which is not helped by the fact that these are 4 OVAs. I give it 5, though, comparing it with Horror anime, which have not been on the quality side of things these past years. I put it in the same category as Higurashi, Shiki, Elfen Lied, and Another, so, if you liked those, there is high chance you'll LOVE this! Now, let's make an incision and dig in!

STORY: A tale of survival in another dimension when a group of unlucky high schoolers are dragged there by a restless Samara look-alike. Let me tell you, the plot is the most confusing aspect, because this series is based on a few visual novels. They go into greater detail whereas the anime gets the blunter end of the knife in this regard. Be prepared to be perplexed as strange ghosts show up and the directors try to unveil connections between them and the protagonists. If you're curious as to how they ended up in the school or who the heck they are, take a peek in the Corpse Party Wiki for reference.

CHARACTERS: Basically lambs being led to the slaughter. Don't expect to get attached to them, though I'm certain you will pity and fear for their situation. Left and right, the teenagers are trampled down in the name of gore. But, let us remember that this is technically a HORROR FILM, which means that the running time is not long enough for you to focus on the characters, and the situation and atmosphere is where the actual focus is going. Don't expect to be compelled by the characters, because you won't, and the ""Oni-chan"" sister stereotype is rather creepily clingy as a bonus punch in the gut.

ANIMATION: This is some high-grade animation here! The school feels alive, as if some vengeful spirit could come out of nowhere or use anything to inflict harm upon our protagonists. The character designs are meh, but at least they differ enough that we can tell everyone apart. Though they are meh, as I have said, they are drawn well and fluid, and so the Blu-ray is well spent for hauntingly eerie backgrounds that act as though they are in the foreground with gore galore in bright colors and nauseating detail. The atmosphere can be no better, even when comparing it to better horror anime like Higurashi, and the entrapment of the characters feels all too real.

SOUND: The opening is fantastic! I absolutely adore it, with the perfect balance of darkness and bright, making the fate of the characters seem like a tragedy. During the rest of the show there are your typical horror chords, so the opening is the best effort the show will make in the music department.

GORE: Just leave if you can't stand the sight of blood. In fact, I'm fine with blood and I found myself feeling sick afterwards. But if you want death in the bloodiest and most sickening manner possible, or even desire to finish with a bad taste in your mouth because these characters don't deserve such horrific ends, then you need to watch this show. And see a doctor.

I love Corpse Party. I really do, and not just for nostalgic value. I love it because it gets horror RIGHT. The suspense never leaves a single frame; every turn is creepy, and every angle has you on the edge of your seat, even if this suspense isn't taken advantage of often. There are few jump scares, and the gore is plentiful, but that's not what makes it great horror. What makes it great horror is that it is actually HORRIFYING. Innocent characters, children no less, losing their minds and falling prey to the twisted evil brought on by another person's sins, being killed in the most torturous ways possible, all taking place in quite possibly the most terrifying prison ever created. It is horror because we, in the humanity of our reality, see it as appalling and unfair for these people to live through these circumstances. THAT is true horror. It sets the perfect tone, one of absolute misery and hopelessness, creating the best horrific atmosphere I've ever witnessed. You will not feel good as a human being after watching Corpse Party, at all, but by no means will you feel sorry that you saw it. If that makes sense to you, anyway. Take my word as you see fit.",1447804800,35,4412,4.550377833753148
7452159,4,B015UBO3SI,"I gave this one a shot because it seemed different. It is. Not very familiar with the source material, but this series holds up fairly well on it's own.

The story is a little confusing and sometimes awkwardly paced, but I guess in the horror genre it's hard to come by a series that does make perfect sense.

First episode had me question if it was worth buying what amounts to a 4 part series, but I was hooked by the end of the second.",1491609600,,438,4.141176470588236

7452165,5,B015UBO3SI,"Check out Corpse Party if you're a fan of Another and When They Cry. I was recommended this anime based on those two. If you're into cheesy bloody/gory/senseless anime violence, this is for you. I personally didn't find myself caring about any one of the characters in Corpse Party, and I think that's why I enjoyed it. I just wanted to check it out for some quick entertainment. If I wanted to worry about the plot and all that, I'd watch Full Metal Alchemist Brotherhood, ya know? Which I also loved. However, this is a completely different genre, with a completely different end goal.

To those who seem to have an issue with the violence, especially to children, get over it, it's fake. It's so cheesy and overdone, to me, that it's laugh out loud funny. I find myself laughing and saying ""What!?"" during several scenes. It's most definitely gruesome and downright crazy violent, but come on, it's so insane, that it makes it funny. There's worse stuff on the evening news.

At 4 episodes total, in around 25 minutes in length, for a quick horror anime you want checked off your list, definitely give it a watch.

In short:

Students trapped in a haunted elementary school being killed off by gruesome dead children ghosts and other students who have gone insane, and they have to figure out how to escape. Includes outrageous blood and gore.

7452167,1,B015UBO3SI,"I watched this show on YouTube so I am not reviewing the BluRay but the anime itself and I have to say that I was immensely disappointed. I expected this to be scary, however, it did not get anyway near frightening except for one jump-scare that really got( I think it was ep. 2). Now I didn't expect this to be the next Cowboy Bebop but man did it let one down on almost every aspect. The story is a jumbled mess and completely run-of-the-mill, the scares are very very cheap and almost non-existent, the plot-holes ginormous and the anime is freighted with anime-cliches to the point that it makes you cringe
Just one example: During the 2nd or 3rd ep.,one character, a little girl, gets scared by a ghost, so much so that she wets her pants. After taking off her underwear and putting it into a drawer she makes the remark that it will now be a bit windy down there but that she'll be ok(btw the asinine monologues, of which there is an enormous amount, are excruciating for anyone who has the slightest idea of how normal people think and talk to themselves). But my point with this example is just to show how idiotic and at times even perverse this show is. Speaking of perverse, the femae characters are all wearing the obligatory clicheed school-uniform with short skirts even though they all have very long legs -perverse Japanese people :).
All in all, this was the lamest, laziest anime that I had to sit through even though it only consists of four episode. Still, I had to force myself to watch it to the end, all the while waiting for something redeeming which was all in vain.",1478131200,,1591,4.470790378006873

I was pleasantly surprised how much of the original story they were able to cram into a relatively short series.  I love the Corpse Party mythology and back story and was pleased to see it remained intact.  And the gore - whew!  They weren't kidding!  But a lot of that was in the game, even if the random corpses strewn about weren't depicted so... juicily.

The one thing I missed from the original was the revelation of the psycho - I thought it was much better handled in the game, with a lot more suspense.  You'll know what i mean when you see it if you know the game.  But it's not a complaint.

And, of course, the deaths of the main characters are (mostly) avoidable in the game, while in anime form, we have to watch some favorites go down.  I was crying at the end.  I dare you not to.",1457827200,,1093,4.351485148514851
7452188,5,B015UBO3SI,"So, I've played all three games. So i might be biased, but this anime is everything i wanted.  It follows the first game well as can be expected when they literally condense a full game story into an hour and a half anime with opening and ending titles. You have to remember that this is 4 episodes at normal anime length taking on the whole of the story.  So some stuff is quicker then is would normally play out in the game, but the over all creepiness stayed intact.  Also due to the time restraints the kill and shock factor happens within minutes of starting making each episode a trail of revulsion instead of a traditional horror movie that takes most of the movie to get to the gore, this makes sure each episode is messed up going for the jugular in each episode.  Making my hour and half of watching a generally stressful experience rather then the exciting climax of a normal horror movie.  Which i liked, but i'm a horror movie junky.

One thing this anime did so well was sound effects.  each pop, squash and stab sounds just right, and they also did a nice job of showing some kills off screen which made them just that more effective with the horrifying sound effects.

I will say one kill though it's effective and has story reliance in the anime just isn't as messed up as the game which made me kind of sad.  Being one of my favorite moments of ""WTF"" in the game.

My only  not sure if its a complaint or warning.  I'm not sure how well they introduce characters in this anime.  the main ones are done fine enough, but a few of the side characters without knowing the manga or game could possibly pop out of no where, though this doesn't take from the experience i'm not sure if not knowing their back story help fluff them up enough to properly make them whole.

All said and done, it takes a great horror game and makes a great anime for it.  it's not as in-depth as the game, though honestly i can't imagine they had the largest budget for this anime.  they did a good job with what they had.  and whoever these voice actors are and for all the corpse party versions they've made, they really do a great job once again.",1457308800,5,2140,4.31
8734629,3,B015UBO3SI,"I paid $30 for this LOL. I was expecting more gruesome. Although, the plot twist was good. ...That's actually really harsh fate, even after death (for your corpse to be repeatedly violated) as a child. I'm not superstitious however----I do think the dead should be respected! So that for me was like 'wtf... her soul never rested!'",1520380800,,331,4.824561403508772
8734630,5,B015UBO3SI,"I didn't know that this was subbed, not dubbed, so that kind of bummed me out since I hate subtitles. But it was my own fault for not reading. Still, it's only four episodes so it wasn't too bad, plus the subtitles are nice and bright unlike most animes so they aren't hard to read. Good story, follows the game. Animated gore doesn't bother me at all but I guess some people could be squeamish. But I'm sure if you're buying a Corpse Party anime, you're probably used to that sort of thing.",1514764800,,491,4.290322580645161
8734631,4,B015UBO3SI,I bought this DVD for my daughter and found a few parts to be pretty funny and gory. I was a little upset with the ending of the film's ending though.,1509840000,,150,3.870967741935484
8734632,4,B015UBO3SI,Really enjoyed the show. It was a lot shorter than expected (only a few episodes). I wish it would have delved a little deeper into certain parts of the story so it felt more whole. There is a lot that you learn from the game that isn't included which can make the show feel like it is jumping around story wise.,1503532800,,312,4.131147540983607

Also, I highly suggest not eating anything while watching, I made that mistake and lost my appetite pretty fast. The story is full of twists and turns and is definitely worth a watch. If you liked shows like Shiki, When They Cry or Another, you'll probably enjoy this one too.",1492560000,,437,4.544303797468355
8734637,4,B015UBO3SI,"This is a four episode anime retelling of the first game. I played through the first game and thought it was a bit silly but I enjoyed it enough to pick up the anime adaptation. The short series really brings it in the blood and gore department and is probably the most vile animated series I have ever seen. I love horror and I love gore and I would consider this the equivalent of a slasher movie with a hard R rating.

The horrific tortures inflicted on children in this series are nonstop and truly sadistic. I can't state this enough. The things that were left to your imagination in the game are played out in full gory glory with equally nasty sound effects. You've been warned.

There are a few good jump scares present throughout the episodes and while the anime isn't exactly terrifying, it is disturbing and intense enough to really give you visceral punch in the gut. And seeing helpless children being stalked and brutalized is frightening to watch.

The problem I had with this series is that the characters are very shallow and even though you feel bad watching them be ripped apart in various ways, it's hard to feel afraid for them when the characterization is paper thin. I understand it's a full game condensed into four episodes but the series either should of been a bit longer or they needed to focus on some of the characters better. It came to a point where it was hard to actually remember which character was which.

The story is also kind of messy. I thought the story in the game was messy too, so condensing an already messy story into four episodes doesn't work very well. The story really jumps all over the place, the end doesn't make much sense (unless you've played the game) and the ending is a real downer. It would've been helpful if the writers tightened up the story a bit.

Otherwise, I was happy to pay 25 bucks for this short anime series on blu ray and I'll definitely watch it again. This is a must watch if you love horror and anime. And if you enjoyed the game on the vita even a bit, I suggest checking it out. The whole concept works better as an anime than a videogames despite the somewhat messy story and thin characterization.",1492300800,,2178,4.4623115577889445
