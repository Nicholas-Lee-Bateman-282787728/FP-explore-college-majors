3028786,1,B000YGE18M,"PLEASE see Wikipedia if you'd like a true version of how this song was written, there is another GREAT MOVIE called just AMAZING GRACE that is a joy to watch and is based on true events.",1287532800,2,186,4.194444444444445
3028787,1,B000YGE18M,"This has got to be one of the worst films I've seen. From beginning to end, it was a travesty to history. The only truth to this movie was there was a slave trader who wrote the now famous hymn, Amazing Grace. From there the movie engages in historic fantasy. It credits the tune to African origin when, in fact, Newton's words were put to a multitude of tunes. It wasn't until about 1835 when the words were married to the tune ""New Britain"" which we now associate them. Newton's conversion experience didn't occur through the love of a captured slave, but rather after a shipwreck and reading a summary of ""The Imitation of Christ"" by Thomas a' Kempis. The cast was a crew of clumsy amateurs and the dialog was as stilted as any you'd hear in a high school play. On the whole, it was one of the worst movies in recent memory.",1283126400,6,827,4.341935483870968
3028788,3,B000YGE18M,"I completely enjoyed this film, even with some of the historical inaccuracies in regards to Newton's conversion. It was easy to get into the story, and feel for it's characters.

That said, this movie should not be confused with or compared to the other film of similar title "" Amazing Grace "". First of all, it is about two different men. John Newton was impacted by his experience in the slave trade. Amazing Grace is about William Wilberforce, who was impacted partly by John Newton. Wilberforce was never IN the slave trade, but was dramatically opposed to it. He spent decades of his life putting an end to it in Britain, with the inspiration of Newtons experience.

So, please don't confuse the two films.

The Amazing Grace is heartwarming, but not to be taken as complete fact. If one keeps that in mind, it is a wonderful film.",1267488000,4,836,4.635135135135135
3028789,1,B000YGE18M,"This movie completely distorted the history and meaning of Amazing Grace.

For one, it portrays over and over again the slaves singing the tune for Amazing Grace, giving them credit as the tune's originators--in reality, Newton did not even write the tune, only the words.

But beyond that, the movie's main story line seems to be a fictionalized account, with the only facts being the atrocities done to the slaves (which were portrayed). The whole story line centers around the slaves showing Newton grace over and over again, and the grace they show him transforming him. Every account of Newton I have seen, however, gives a different account of Newton's conversion--that during a storm Newton read Thomas a Kempis' ""The Imitation of Christ"" and began to be convicted by God. The movie does portray a storm, but has him free the slaves and be rescued by them during it, rather than read and find God's truths.

I find it ironic that only the first verse of the hymn was ever sung--the other verses make it very clear that the grace Newton was referring to was God's grace, not man's. It's only God's grace that can completely transform the heart of a man and give him hope for eternity--not man's.

I would strongly caution against watching this, and encourage anyone who has to read the true history of this beloved hymn--it's VERY different from that presented!",1251590400,39,1367,4.804255319148936
3028790,4,B000YGE18M,"I wasn't sure if I was going to like this movie, but was so drawn in only minutes into the film.  It does not carry the expensive Hollywood budget behind it, but the locale (Nigeria) and the cast is amazing! (Forgive the pun.)  Unlike the other ""Amazing Grace"" movie which does not focus on the slaves' impact on John Newton's reformation, this offers a brilliant, intelligent and insightful look at the entire beginning of Newton's struggles as a slaveholder. Come on - how can you leave out the slaves and attempt to realistically peer into Newton's religious struggles?

The message of love and forgiveness coupled with realism made it not too overwhelming.  Just the right mix.  I highly recommend the purchase of this DVD, even if only to compliment ""Amazing Grace.""",1242604800,14,771,4.854961832061068
3028791,5,B000YGE18M,"This movie has some sincere actors & some excellent singers.  We enjoyed the film, although not sure if I'd show it to kids before high school.  The violence wasn't as blatant as some, but it had hard issues.

The central story of course is the man and the hymn.  But beyond that, it presents good issues to explore.  We found ourselves talking about the variety of roles whites & blacks played in the slave trade.  Is being a ""good"" slave master better than letting someone else be a ""bad"" one?

I know the history is speculative at most.  But isn't that true all history?  Apparently we can thank this man's writings for knowing much at all about the goings-on in the slave trade.  Some movie events probably didn't happen, but I enjoyed this exploration of the possible agonizing issues that were wrestled with on this and similar voyages when men started to look at what they were thinking & doing.",1241308800,6,902,4.58125

3028794,4,B000YGE18M,This film was definitely heartfelt. I enjoyed the interactions with Newton and the slave girl. There was a sort of innocence and navet about the movie. Each character from the brutal African slave catcher to the shipmate that was cast down in rank to be amongst the slaves due to his change of heart was very emotional. The movie covered bases that are normally not portrayed and handed out accountability to all in the film. It was a different insight to the story but it was one that was well executed.,1224633600,6,504,4.549450549450549

8232703,5,B000YGE18M,"While looking to buy ""Amazing Grace"", that other film detailing the life and development of parliamentarian William Wilberforce, I ran into this one ""THE Amazing Grace"" and bought it by accident. Initially disappointed upon watching an obviously lower budget flick that was not at all like the preview I was expecting, I stuck through it, found it quite enjoyable, and upon later watching the other film feel that its actually a good companion prequel. This one is about John Newton's younger years, in his later life as a minister, he would go on to influence and mentor William Wilberforce and so it gives insight into one of Wilberforce's hero's. Oh, and I guess he is credited with a catchy tune that used to be sung in nearly every church service that I have ever sat through.
  Like all historically based movies, this one I am sure suffers from historical inaccuracies, but hey if I am looking for total accuracy (and even there it's seldom guaranteed) I'd be reading academic papers and source accounts instead...As to the storyline itself, it takes place in Africa and I believe was shot on location on the Gold Coast. It is cleverly narrated from the standpoint of John Newton's adversary/protagonist (or the subjugated slave) who is a local woman from the river village that his slaver ship was raiding from. The acting is a little amateurish at times, and the sets are a little spare (it does look like a lower budget affair) the but these do not detract from the storyline which moves along pretty smoothly. The catchy little tune is more a sideline to the real story surrounding Newton's transformational event and does get a little overkilled. It's not a movie for the younger crowd as there is some violence and brutality, but it is not gratuitous in the way of a ""Kill Bill""-type movie. It does suggest a possible way of how Newton's direct experiences went on to influence Wilberforce many years later in the other movie. So to repeat, the two movies ""Amazing Grace"" and ""The Amazing Grace"" despite the confusing names, do indeed make a good pair and both seen together are greater than the sum of the two seen alone.",1396051200,,2135,4.752021563342318

8232705,4,B000YGE18M,"My husband and I enjoyed this movie.  We have never seen a film from the ""slave"" point of view.  We wish that the author had extended the time however because by the time we were really enjoying the story line, scenery, etc., the movie ended.  I personally like viewing movies filmed on location as as opposed to made -up scenery.
