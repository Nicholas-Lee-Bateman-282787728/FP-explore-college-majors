The film begins in a newspaper office. Students will work for three days as cub reporters. ""Can I cover a scandal?"" ""Journalism is a noble career."" Each student draws an assignment. Nancy Drew makes a choice: the coroner's inquest. It was poison, not a heart condition! This chemical is used in photography. The beneficiary of Kate Lambert's will is the suspect. Eula Denning is held for murder. A car chase provides action. The Lambert house is sealed, but a man tried to enter. ""Reporters do it in the movies."" The story in the newspaper makes Denning look guilty. Nancy's intuition tells her Denning isn't guilty. A whistle bomb? Two mischievous children? Will Ted Nickerson help Nancy? Nancy is clever! They interview Eula Denning in jail and learn about the missing tin of chemicals.

Is entering illegal? ""Not for a reporter."" Ted distracts the guard in a card game. Nancy sneaks into the house and finds the can. But a female confederate snatches the can and runs away! Carlton Drew, the lawyer, is surprised by Nancy's promise. Was it a mistake? The man with a bent ear is a clue. Nancy goes to the newspaper morgue for research, and finds a photograph. She has a plan to learn more about Soxie. Ted volunteers. Nancy gets a telephone number, then counts the pulses from the dial! Nancy adjusts Ted's boxing glove. ""What happened?"" Nancy tracks down Miss Lucas, and finds her with Miles Lambert (Kate's nephew). She drops a nickel. There is a conflict in the caf. Soxie can deliver the can to the police. ""Sixty-five cents."" Mary Nickerson sings for entertainment, the other join in. People throw bright new shiny silver coins. Nancy tells the newspaper editor what is happening. ""The story must be true, they printed it in the paper."" [Huh?]

Nancy tells the sergeant the story was designed to cause a crisis and catch the murderer. Note the disguise used by the sergeant. [Isn't that old woman too tall?] Was that legal wiretapping? The sergeant tosses the suspect's room. They are caught! Nancy gets an idea to get help. They get attention, and are released. Soxie meets Miles, they flee when they hear a police siren. But the police are in pursuit, and catch the pair. The loose ends are left untied. What about those Nickerson brats?

This is based on the Nancy Drew Stories by ""Carolyn Keene"", a popular series of adventure books from that era. This story may be more believable in a written format. What kind of novels are written for teenagers today?",1459382400,,2499,4.777777777777778
8227151,4,B000X7SCXM,"Take a trip back to a simpler time, when an unassuming teenage girl could track down the missing evidence in a messy murder trial. Carolyn Keene's ""Nancy Drew"" series received definitive screen versions in the late 1930s thanks to the Warner Brothers films franchise starring Bonita Granville as teen sleuth Nancy Drew.

In NANCY DREW...REPORTER (filmed in 1939), we follow Nancy while she works as a student reporter at the city newsdesk. Enterprising young lady that she is, Nancy secretly swaps her assigned story for a hot murder trial, where pretty chemical lab assistant Eula Denning (Betty Amann) will surely go to the gas chamber unless Nancy uncovers the vital evidence that will clear her name. Nancy teams with her next-door-neighbour Ted Nickerson (Frankie Thomas) as they set off on a dangerous, thrill-packed race against time...

Bonita Granville remains the definitive screen Nancy; the perfect embodiment of the enterprising, go-gettum spirit of the books. Frankie Thomas (best-remembered as TV's ""Tom Corbett: Space Cadet"") is also very fine as the reluctant stooge to Nancy's crime capers.",1260057600,,1108,5.325714285714286
