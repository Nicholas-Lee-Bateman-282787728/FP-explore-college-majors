This is one of the worst DVD-transfers I have ever seen. It looks like it was shot with a camera from a TV-screen. STAY AWAY FROM THIS. DO NOT BUY.,1354406400,3,276,3.694915254237288

5408488,5,B00AB2NX4M,"A Brasher Doubloon/UK The High Window (John Brahm, 1947, 72')

Directed by John Brahm. Screenplay by Dorothy Bennett, Leonard Praskins, based on a novel by Raymond Chandler. Starring George Montgomery, Nancy Guild, Conrad Janis, Fritz Kortner. Music by David Buttolph, Cinematography Lloyd Ahern, Editing by Harry Reynolds. Distributed by 20th Century Fox.

The movie is technically a remake of Time to Kill, a 1942 film which adapted The High Window as a Michael Shayne adventure starring Lloyd Nolan. Reviewer D Steigman noted that the DVD black and white full frame transfer from Fox to him is very good, very solid with shades of blacks whites and grays at appropriate levels (I agree-RC).

Film critic Dennis Schwartz wrote, ""A film noir similar in theme and almost as enjoyable as The Big Sleep, as private investigator Philip Marlowe (George Montgomery) leaves his Hollywood office for a case in Pasadena from a rich old widow who lives in a dark old house. It's just smart enough of a film noir to be considered a classic ... This brooding Gothic melodrama is brought to life by John Brahm's expressionistic ambiance ably photographed by cinematographer Lloyd Ahern and by the sharp hard-boiled Raymond Chandler story the film is adapted from, The High Window. The film is not as complex as the novel, but it makes good use of its snappy dialogue and has vividly grotesque characterizations to go along with the dark mood it sets. Fritz Kortner stands out in his villainous role, which he plays like Peter Lorre would; while Florence Bates is charmingly acerbic in her creepy role as a bitter old hag.""

Now my five bits: Like Robert Montgomery's Lady in the Lake, another 1947 hardly ever seen/known Chandler, beautifully restored, with an equally beautiful Nancy Guild, easily looking and playing at par with the young Lauren Bacall. Montgomery as Marlowe, is yet another type, soft-spoken and in a way a lady's man, but with quick reflexes; ""I don't like a gun pointed at me"" is his standard phrase when having knocked out any of those pistoleros (including women) and getting hold of their gun by knee jerk, a quick bout of wrestling, any trick, by throwing the off-balance assailant on a sofa, actually, but so fast that you need several viewings. Also, the dialogue is a firework of wit and double-entendre's. A fiest!

5408489,2,B00AB2NX4M,"This 1947 adaptation of the Philip Marlowe novel, The High Window is an illustration both of how not to adapt a book and how not to do a detective movie.

As soon as I saw the Mustached George Montgomery, I knew I'd had trouble buying him in the role of Philip Marlowe. Philip Marlowe with a mustache? He couldn't carry it off and it was more than the facial hair.

To be clear, Montgomery does give the best performance in this movie, but that's not saying much. Every performance in this movie is either extremely wooden or hammy.

The movie was also incredibly inconsistent with Marlowe narrating, with it being present at the early part of the film and then disappearing later on. In addition, the voice overs he did were pointless. A good voice over should communicate something we didn't see or show off the hard boiled nature of the private eye or the setting. The narration here did nothing other than say things that we could see on the screen or were just plain bland.  In addition, while this is supposed to be a hard boiled private eye movie, it ends with a gathering of the suspects and Marlowe revealing whodunit like it's Charlie Chan or the Thin Man.

The biggest problem with this movie is that it's a story of the greatest hard boiled eye of them all, Philip Marlowe and the ""romance"" angle in this movie is so hard to swallow. In the novel High Window, Marlowe recognizes that the timid secretary of his client is emotionally wounded and needs helped. He gallantly works to help her with no idea of doing anything romantic with her. Here, George Montgomery's Marlowe is downright creepy in his attempts to seduce Merle Davis (Nancy Guild). It just felt icky and my feeling has nothing to do with our politically correct times. Chandler recognized this was not the way a hero should act and that a man who has to hit on an emotionally traumatized woman is not only a cad, but a loser.

The movie does have a chase scene that's half way decent. In some way screenwriter Dorothy Bennett did manage to pare down Chandler's more convoluted story line and eliminate character like Leslie Murdoch's wife. The story features a young Conrad Janis who looks a lot like Leonardo DiCaprio in this film.  Finally, the DVD release is long overdue, and it's worth watching once for Philip Marlowe completists.

In the end, this is just a poor film, and it's poor for a B-film. It'd be understandable if this came from a studio like Monogram, but Fox made this and they showed in both Charlie Chan and Mr. Moto that they could make entertaining B detective movies, for whatever reason, they didn't here.",1383868800,6,2606,4.589247311827957
5408490,4,B00AB2NX4M,"I really love Raymond Chandler's novels and collect all the film/tv versions of his work. This was the only Marlowe film I hadn't seen and it is sort of OK, the plot is simplified and the cast is definitely B actors. The script writer threw out all the other female characters except the ones played by Florence Bates and Nancy Guild. My first order of this DVD never arrived and after contacting the service desk of Amazon they sent me another copy of the DVD. Bravo Amazon! I knew I could rely on the reliable service.",1382313600,2,520,4.427083333333333
5408491,4,B00AB2NX4M,"Just as the source material (Raymond Chandler's ""The High Window"") is often overlooked, so too is this film adaptation of it. And that's a shame, because it's a compact, no-frills story that adheres very closely to Chandler's original, with not an ounce of filler or fat. While George Montgomery & Nancy Guild aren't major names -- and Montgomery isn't how most viewers would envision Philip Marlowe -- they both do a good job, as does the superb supporting cast. I think it adds to the shadowy seediness of the setting that no-one looks too movie-star attractive; they're all very much ordinary-looking people. The direction is crisp, with some wonderfully atmospheric shots of palm leaf shadows moving over the characters in the ceaseless wind, which is almost another character in the story, a relentless pressure that builds & builds until the climax. No, not a major film -- but for a small film obviously made quickly & inexpensively, it delivers the goods -- recommended!",1379376000,2,978,5.006134969325154

5408495,3,B00AB2NX4M,"The casting of the two leads - George Montgomery and Nancy Guild, doesn't quite work in this film noir... but most everything else does.  The story is as nicely complicated as any Raymond Chandler work.  The atmosphere is solidly handled by John Brahm, a semi-master at noir.  And Florence Bates is terrifically nasty, while young Conrad Janis is fine in his own nasty role.  Certainly, this film deserves inclusion in any discussion of film noir.  Montgomery might have been good as our detective hero, but his character doesn't fit.  He might, if the dialogue had allowed, been able to slip into the noir list of tecs a la Bogart.  Note how well Mark Stevens handles it in the semi-forgotten 'The Dark Corner'... and compare it to the ineptitude of Robert Taylor in the same kind of role.",1370563200,3,790,4.7226277372262775

5408503,5,B00AB2NX4M,"Excellent quality, given the rarity of this title over the last couple of decades.  The black and white contrast is much better than in the ""underground"" copies floating around.

  I suspect that the Raymond Chandler estate may have held up its release during the VHS/laserdisc era.  The film is based on a ""lesser"" Chandler novel entitled THE HIGH WINDOW.  It may not be as great as other Chandler adaptations, but it's still a wonderful walk through some hidden corners of Los Angeles society.  The ending came as a surprise to me.

One warning--if you're a person (like me) who tends to spot-check new discs by advancing to each chapter-stop, this is one time that you should avoid doing so.  The last chapter-stop lands right on the unmasking of ""whodunit!""",1356566400,15,761,4.837209302325581

What is surprising is that it is taken this long for an authorized studio release.  There are previous DVD versions floating around--probably bootleg or public domain versions.  In any case, the 72 minute film is a nice adaption of Raymond Chandler's novel the High Window.  Concise, gritty and a bit violent for its time---it may not rank with ""The Big Sleep"" or ""Murder My Sweet""  or ""Lady in The Lake"" and George Montgomery may not rank with Bogart, Dick Powell or even Robert Montgomery as Phillip Marlowe.

5408505,4,B00AB2NX4M,"The Brasher Doubloon is a Philip Marlowe programmer with the famous detective out to find what appears to be a stolen coin. This coin called the Brasher Doubloon...what Marlowe finds instead is a couple of murders in this pretty good Noir with George Montgomery as Marlowe.
Now while this movie isn't quite up to (in my own opinion) a few of the other films with Philip Marlow such as The Big Sleep, Lady in the Lake or Murder My Sweet, this is a very respectable and enjoyable film. It is worth looking into
The DVDr black and white full frame transfer from Fox to me is very good, very solid with shades of blacks whites and grays at appropriate levels. It is certainly better than those underground DVDr releases that are out there. Nothing remastered mind you but this is at the moment and probably for the foreseeable future the definitive release.
-If you want this film and if you want the best presentation of the Brasher Doubloon - go with the Fox Cinema Archive Edition.",1355788800,43,980,4.573863636363637
8549581,3,B00AB2NX4M,"Based on Raymond Chandler's ""The High Window"" (which is actually a better title for the story, since the titular coin is really simply a Macguffin), ""The Brasher Doubloon"" is an all right mystery, albeit one with a pretty predictable solution. As a Philip Marlowe film, however, it ranks at the bottom of the list, even lower than the controversial ""The Long Goodbye."" Why? In a nutshell because George Montomery is a totally inadequate Marlowe. Young, handsome, and sprouting a 1940s style pencil moustache that might have been appropriate for Boston Blackie, Montgomery sounds a bit like Clark Gable, but has zero screen presence. His wooden performance does not present the Marlowe who is neither tarnished nor afraid, but one who is neither talented nor accomplished. Neither is Nancy Guild up to the task of a rather difficult role. As the leading lady (by default), she delivers a weak and amateurish performance. On the plus side is Fritz Kortner, who delivers an amusing imitation of Peter Lorre in a brief suspect role, and the script, which isn't bad, particularly the witty narration. Director John Brahm maintains a rapid pace and establishes good atmosphere, while creating a lot of interesting shots. It's just a shame he couldn't have coaxed decent performances out of Montgomery and Guild.",1523750400,,1305,5.102803738317757
8549582,4,B00AB2NX4M,"(3.75 stars) (see below for warning about the DVD)
I watched this movie on You Tube.  Running time is about 1 hour and 10 minutes which helps keep it tight and moving.  Based on Raymond Chandler's book The High Window it makes for good no frills entertainment.  Nancy Guild was hot and the mood/tone of the movie seemed appropriate.  But I think the current price of about $19.00 for just the movie is too steep.  I could see if there were extras (particularly a commentary) but not just the movie.

Warning about the DVD: I watched this movie on You Tube and liked it so ordered a copy.  These are copies for sale and my copy had a loud buzzing sound throughout the movie.  I then ordered another copy from another seller and had the same exact problem.  So until this is fixed with a new edition of this movie, I wouldn't get it.",1474156800,,831,4.3441558441558445

8549589,4,B00AB2NX4M,"I can recall thinking of this film, when it first came out in the forties, that it was likely the best thing George Montgomery had done. About all I can say now is that it is likely that he gave his best performance in this B+ film but that I can't make further comparisons because I cannot remember any other film,of his (although his film log does include a few A films in which he had more than a walk-on role). At any rate, this was not intended to be, and is not, competitive with the Chandler adaptations made as 'A' class movies. Montgomery doe a quite respectable job within script and casting limitations, managing to raise the film to the level of the better versions of The Saint, Perry Mason, Ellery Queen, Boston Blackie and other B production series which served as second features during the thirties and forties. In content, it follows the ritualistic pattern for such films, whatever may have been their source,  reflecting more the studio writers than the original Chandler book.
