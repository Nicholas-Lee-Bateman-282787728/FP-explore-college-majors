8375227,5,B002NO0G6Y,This is a cute romantic comedy/drama.  Oh Pil Seung is a fun loving character who is taken out of his comfort zone to become the heir to a supermarket empire.  Ahn Jae perfectly portrays this character as he undergoes these life experiences.  The soundtrack is also fun including a Korean version of USA's country western style song and Ahn Jae Wook's great rock rendition of the theme song.,1372982400,,391,4.720588235294118
