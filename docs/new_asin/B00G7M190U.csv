6062296,5,B00G7M190U,"To the surprise of many, Tom Hanks hasn't won an Academy Award since 1995 (Forrest Gump), and even more surprising is the fact he hasn't been nominated for an Academy Award since 2001 (Cast Away).  However, it's not as though his acting ability has diminished in his 12 year drought - just his acting frequency.  Within the last ten years, his roles have been sporadic at best and shockingly mediocre at times - especially in films like The Ladykillers, Larry Crowne, and Angels & Demons.  Although his acting career may seem less important, it's not as though he's left the entertainment business - he's simply taken on different roles in the entertainment business, such as play actor and executive producer.  But, fear not Tom Hanks fans - it would appear his lack of Academy recognition will be coming to an end with the upcoming award season as Hanks should have no problem earning a lead actor nomination for his portrayal as Captain Richard Phillips in Captain Phillips.

Based on a true story and directed by Paul Greengrass (United 93, The Bourne Ultimatum), Captain Phillips stars Tom Hanks as Richard Phillips, Captain of the United States transport ship, Maersk Alabama.  On the way to Africa, the Maersk Alabama is approached and eventually hijacked by a crew of Somali pirates, led by their own Captain - named Muse (Barkhad Abdi).  However, once aboard the ship, the Somalis are unable to operate the vessel, forcing them to abandon their plan and head home - but not before they take a hostage with them.  Tensions run high as the U.S. Navy is called in to defuse the situation, either by freeing Captain Phillips or stopping the Somalis by any means necessary.  Catherine Kener, Barkhad Abdirahman, Faysal Ahmed, Mahat M. Ali, & Yul Vazquez also star in supporting roles.

If you're unaware of the actual events of the Maersk Alabama hijacking in April 2009, you're encouraged to keep it that way, at least until after you see this movie.  Obviously, like any means of entertainment, if you know how something is going to turn out, the build-up isn't as exciting.  With that being said, I'll happily admit that the real life events of this story had somehow escaped my memory, so I had no idea how this film was going to end.  For better or worse, the high amount of tension involved with this film's plot literally had me biting my finger nails for nearly the entirety of the film.  Much like last year's critically acclaimed film, Argo, Captain Phillips progresses in a similar manner, depicting an emotionally taxing historical event.  The progression of the story is fueled by copious amounts of emotional stress, and focuses on lead characters that you can't help but become emotionally attached to.  And, while Argo was brilliant in its own right, Captain Phillips is a much more personal tale, which also happens to deal with hostages being taken during a rather unique scenario.

While Captain Phillips is a masterfully written story (scripted by Billy Ray), Tom Hanks is the real attraction of this film.  Not since Forrest Gump has Tom Hanks been this awe-inspiring, bringing a screen presence that is all-domineering in every facet of the film.  Unquestionably, Hanks radiates in his portrayal of this brave, selfless hero that puts his crew above and beyond his own safety - qualities that anyone and everyone can admire.  While Hanks' career is already defined by so many quality roles, this portrayal of Captain Phillips is easily one of his top five portrayals, rivaling any of his previous roles (other than Forrest Gump - which will easily go down as his greatest role of all-time).  In any event, if you're a Tom Hanks fan (and I don't know many people that aren't), this film will re-cement him on your list of the best actors in the world today.

The most shocking aspect of this film is the fact that the Somali pirates, portrayed by Barkhad Abdi, Barkhad Abdirahman, Faysal Ahmed, and Mahat M. Ali, have never acted in a feature film prior to Captain Phillips.  The best part about it is that if I wouldn't have just told you that particular tidbit, you would have never noticed.  In fact, you'll likely assume these guys are all well-established in the industry - only you've just never seen them before.  It's obviously a major gamble from the casting department, but it's a gamble that couldn't have gone any better and pays off in dividends.  While each of the pirates play a significant role in this film, Barkhad Abdi plays a much more important role than his three counterparts, portraying Captain Phillips's main rival.  Even though Tom Hanks owns nearly every scene of this film, his character is only as strong as the main villain, a role that Abdi pulls off brilliantly.  It wouldn't be a surprise in the least to hear a substantial amount of award buzz surround Abdi for depiction of the pirate known as Muse.

The beauty of a film like Captain Phillips is that it's an all-encompassing film hat quickly reaches out and snatches your attention to the point that you'll forget that you're even watching a movie.  From the pirate's first attempt to take the ship, all the way until the final scenes of the film - each and every passing moment is just as vital and important as the last, causing you to become emotionally invested in the outcome of Captain Phillips and his crew.  And, even since the successful elimination of Osama bin Laden, featured prominently in Zero Dark Thirty, there has been a great deal of interest in previous Seal Team Six missions, one of which was defusing the tense situation while Captain Phillips was in captivity.  Naturally, the incorporation of the seals also adds to the general interest of a story the one might simply chalk up to being a random pirate encounter.

Overall, there's no doubt that Captain Phillips is the best film of 2013 - at least up to this point (and it will be nearly impossible to overtake).  The level of passion and sentiment emanating from this film is the reason many of us (including myself) go to the movies.  This film provides an escape from reality as a means to witness one of the more stressful, thrilling, and eventually heart-warming events - not just in real life, but also on the big screen.  Tom Hanks brings the character of Richard Phillips to the forefront, and with good reason.  At a time when he was in need, this film also sheds light on the often unaccounted heroic actions of the United States military and the lengths they will go to protect its citizens.  To be honest, there's too many aspects of this film to praise in one short review, but the bottom line is this thrilling drama screams (to the rafters) Academy Award winner - for several individual (writing, screenplay) and group efforts (cinematography, production design), including Best Motion Picture.  In other words, go see this movie.  Go now!

6062297,5,B00G7M190U,"This is what film-making is all about! With Paul Greengrass (""United 93"" and the ""Bourne"" franchise) at the helm, we know we are in for a PG-13, white-knuckle ride. We see the US-flagged MV Maersk Alabama container-ship taken by pirates off the coast of Somalia in 2009, the first such hijacking in two hundred years.

The script by Billy Ray (""The Hunger Games"") is based on (Captain) Richard Phillips book, ""A Captain's Duty: Somali Pirates, Navy SEALS, and Dangerous Days at Sea"" which depicts these events from his personal experience.

Although we are already familiar with the situation from 2009 news accounts, we see the wildly contrasting lives of our principals: the high-tech environment enjoyed by modern maritime workers, as opposed to the starkly marginal survival of the Somalis who are assigned the task to ""Go get us some money!"" I was fascinated by the ubiquity of khat, the mildly addictive African narcotic used in Muslim countries because alcohol is forbidden. Chewing these leaves dulls the appetite, which makes life there more endurable.

We have:
  * Tom Hanks (""Cloud Atlas"") as our eponymous (and resourceful) hero, a fellow who insists he is anything BUT a hero. He says, ""You just do what you have to do."" ...but he does PLENTY, in extremely trying circumstances!
  * Barkhad Abdi in his first film role, plays Muse (""Moo say'""), the Somali captain of a primitive pirate boat, desperate and wily. His ultimate goal is to ""go to America.""
  * Faysal Ahmed is Najee, a big, gun-waving Somali who becomes increasingly frenzied as the full might and power of the United States military (WITH Navy SEALS!) surrounds their tiny lifeboat.

There were many wonderful characters but I won't devote any more space to them. Instead, I urge you to see the film and tell me if you agree that the last ten minutes will earn Mr. Hanks another Oscar. Our screening audience applauded and you will applaud your DVD from Amazon.

Kudos for the sound, photography, art direction, set design, script, and acting. Yes, even though I almost succumbed to the ""Stockholm Syndrome,"" I was really impressed by this one!",1380844800,11,2122,4.932584269662922
6062298,5,B00G7M190U,"One word, ""Phenomenal"" I could literally stop this review right there!  I was invited to the first screening of the movie in Tampa and after having watched the trailer I knew for sure this was a movie I didn't want to miss.  I accepted the invite and printed my tickets and informed friends of the screening so they could get theirs and then we waited for the day to arrive.  In the meantime I began to research the story of the MV Maersk Alabama and the related hijackings.

First let me say this movie is a true story and seemed to match the details of the original story very accurately as it was based on the book ""A Captain's Duty"" penned by the man Richard Phillips himself and the screenplay was adapted from his book by Billy Ray.

The story begins introducing us to Captain Richard ""Rich"" Phillips and humanizes him through a discussion with his wife about their children.  Within a few minutes, we're taken to a small village in Somalia where a band thugs arrives to pressure the locals into going back to the work of hijacking Marine Vessels and returning their cargo to the regional warlords where the ship is then ransomed back to the owners.

After a failed attempt to board the Maersk Alabama the pirates rejoin their mother ship and repair their boat and add a second engine to help the skiff catch the larger, more powerful vessel.  The Crew users flairs, high pressure water hoses, a series of 30 degree turns in an attempt to fend off the pirates but, all their efforts fail as the ship is boarded and the skiff is sunk. The crew then goes into a series of rehearsed procedures in which most of them hide in the engine room where they take control of the ship and shut it down.  From there two of them risk their lives going above deck to kill the generators which stops emergency lighting and the other retrieves food and water for the men in hiding.

In the meantime the pirate captain forces Captain Phillips to take him on a search for the crew to which, he leads one man into a trap that injures the man's feet.  The Captain is then ordered to go with the injured man back to the bridge and he complies.  Of course the rest of the crew seized the opportunity presented to them and overwhelm the Pirate captain.  This sets up the event that would ultimately be the meat of the movie as Captain Phillips is supposed to be exchanged for the Pirate Captain and the pirates are supposed to take the life boat and head home but, they renege on their deal and take Captain Phillips with them.

Within a day of being notified the US Navy intercepts the small vessel and the rest of the story really is something you have to witness.  I'm not going to go into much more than this as we're only about 30 minutes into a 2 hour and 10 minute movie and I really recommend seeing this movie as this is my new favorite movie of the year! Seriously, if this doesn't win best picture then Hollywood is an even bigger scam than I could have ever imagined.

Captain Richard Phillips is played by Tom Hanks and in my opinion, this is the best acting Tom Hanks has ever done.  For the most part, there's literally nobody else you'll recognize in this movie and given his performance throughout the movie Hanks is more than up to the task of leading the entire cast straight to what is sure to be one award win after another.  The 4 Somali Hijackers also did an outstanding job and they're literally unknowns without a single role to their acting career beyond this movie; they really did an incredible job in their supporting roles.  Seriously, everybody in this film was spot on in their roles and I cannot say enough good things about the acting.

As for the political aspect of this movie, there was no swaying from either side and even the decisions made by Obama (this happened during his first term) were only referenced as orders from the White House.

Overall, I cannot say enough good things about this film and how deep it really went.  It was a pretty intense and emotional ending which only further sealed this movie, in my opinion, as one of the best movies to come along in several years and it easily bests the majority of the films released in the past 2 years.

For the record, Somali Pirates have attempted three more hijackings of the Maersk Alabama since this incident and each time they were turned away by armed security forces so, this shipping company clearly learned from their mistakes.

And another note, the Captain actually returned to work within 2 years of the event.

6062331,5,B00G7M190U,"Director Paul Greengrass has made it routine to examine the sins of faux pas dialogue and bad communication between opposing ideologies. When we begin Bloody Sunday (2002) and United 93(2006) its not long before lethal chaos will ensue, where as Captain Phillips laboriously centers around a sincere effort at conversation to avoid hostility within the chess match between two captains. In Green Zone (2010), Greengrass reminds us of Americas failure to understand the Iraqi government yet now in international water, we tell a different tale of invaders and hijackers failure to understand Americans. There is a strong effort to display how foreign the Somalians are to America, both visually and mentally. Where Bloody Sunday are whites shooting whites, or in United 93 its two distinct enemies at war with one another  the pirates are simply nomads, far from the norm we anticipate watching the U.S. military deal with in the post-9/11 world. The Navy is not going to let you win. They would rather sink this boat than let you win is the warning Tom Hanks prescribes, yet Americas ideal everyman couldn't have been more quintessential casting. Thrown into unthinkable pandemonium generates the two-time Oscar winners greatest performance to day, rivaling Hanks most glorified films and roles. Greengrass historical dramatizations are history as told by him and the intertextuality of his films are sheer bliss. From Ben Sliney playing himself in both United 93 and Green Zone (cameo), or Matt Damon as the authentic all-American superhero in The Bourne Ultimatum (2007) sent over to try and navigate our confusion of Iraq in Green Zone, or casting Khalid Abdalla as the one to assist Damons Sgt. Miller and ultimately tell him (us?) that we are in a battle we cannot understand, when previously taking the role of the lead hijacker in United 93. As with Captain Phillips, Greengrass makes the bold decision to extract the final 6 minutes of John Powells score from United 93 into the finale here. This is pure emphasizes that his films are not sequels or franchises, but rather part of a collection; you are entering his history class. The lecture of Captain Phillips is themed in the films opening and closing scenes: will everything be okay?",1514419200,,2246,5.07027027027027

6062394,1,B00G7M190U,"This was a very well done movie. However, I felt that although there was some light shed on the other side of the fence, there was not enough. I understand that this was a terrible and Absolutely Horrific Tragedy. My problem is that this movie shows an example of the western world stepping on developing countries, smearing them into the dirt and then using any backlash as a means to vindicate retaliation as if to say we are the roses and you are SH#T. It seems that most people failed to see that. It would have been nice to see more brought out about how Somali fishing villages have been decimated thanks to big western fishing companies poaching their fishing grounds, violently destroying their vessels and gear and then kicking them between the legs for trying to fight back. What do you expect to happen? If you take away a persons means to live you will only leave them with a means to an end. Fishing vessels, Cargo vessels, regardless of the ship, If there's money to be made it becomes fair game. People are gonna survive one way or the other and you made the devil that haunts you...  What captain Phillips did might have been heroic but what big fishing companies have done is absolutely atrocious. They're making big money off of Somali fishing grounds and the Somali fishing villages know it and some of them want their cut. They don't deserve it? If our fishing grounds here in the US were being poached by outsiders, what would we do? No doubt, we would fire up the jets and sink some ships. Then we would paint the biggest picture of how we're  the good guys and they're the bad guys. The  biggest lesson I will take from this movie is this, If you make the devil you better be prepared to lye with him.",1491350400,2,1724,4.449367088607595

You will totally forget that he is Tom Hanks. Surprisingly (to me, at least), Captain Phillips is also loaded with action and suspense. Once it gears up, it runs nonstop to the end and never lets up. Add to that one of the best recent soundtracks I've come across (you cannot appreciate this film without theatre surround --- it takes place on the open sea, and it's NOT a small screen movie). Finally, Captain Phillips makes an honest effort to tell all sides of the story. We understand exactly why the pirates do what they do, and their story is told as well as that of anyone else.

The most poignant message here is the plight of those living in abject poverty, the desperation it drives them too, and what terrible physical condition they are in. One thing they have in spades is Courage to take on such a mighty prize as a container ship. There wasn't much to applaud here the acting was stiff, out-of-synch, and not Tom Hanks best performance (he actually sounded like a bad liar) by a long shot.

6062538,2,B00G7M190U,"Sorry, I did not like watching this film.  There was no story, no plot, characters were not fleshed out.  No part of the movie prior to the taking of the ship adds anything to the story.  He talks with his wife and then we never see the wife again.  Why include that?  Once the pirates take the ship, you know how it ends.  Why include that part?  I guess it's supposed to be a documentary but there was no documentation.  I was at least hoping for a bit of insight into the conditions that lead the Somali people to become pirates.  Nope, none of that.  They could have maybe explained to a lay person such as myself, why a huge ship like that has no protection against Somali pirates. Nope, didn't do that either.  Maybe my expectations for this movie were too high.  How many Tom hanks movies are duds?  Not many.  But maybe this one is.  Sorry.",1475625600,2,848,4.2784810126582276

Maybe if Phillips had managed to swim away from his captors at the end, when he might have had a chance, the movie would have left a better taste in the mouth.  As it was, the flick ended with the Captain quivering and moaning from his ordeal, which was probably realistic, but not exactly enjoyable to watch.",1473552000,,439,4.518987341772152

6062599,4,B00G7M190U,"The true story of Captain Phillips played by American actor, Tom Hanks, and the Somali pirates who hijack a freighter ship off the coast of Somalia. The film takes some liberty with the actual truth but it does tell the story very dramatically. Barkhad Abdi, a newcomer to film, was nominated for an Academy Award in Supporting Actor for his performance as Muse. He does an incredible job as the lead Somali pirate. The other actors include Kenyan actor, Barkhad Abdirahman, as Bilal; Faysal Ahmed as Najee; and Mahat M. Ali as Elmi. Academy Award nominee Catherine Keener has a small part playing Mrs. Phillips back home in New England.

If you enjoy the film, you will definitely enjoy the behind the scenes making of the movie especially the documentary with the actual Captain Phillips. The Somali pirates are just young boys who work for vicious men and would be killed if they don't turn in treasures to them. During the film, you can see a relationship between Captain Phillips and the Somali pirate known as Muse. Captain Phillips is nicknamed Irish by Muse. The film has plenty of exciting and thrilling moments about Captain Phillips' rescue.

If you love Tom Hanks and want to see the true story of Captain Phillips and the Somali pirates, this film does a very good in re-enacting the events during the hijacking, capture, and rescue. You will find it a thrill of a movie.",1470873600,,1384,4.738589211618257

6062610,5,B00G7M190U,"Captain Philips
 Tom Hanks pulls off one of the most difficult feats for any actor of his prominence; he vanishes into his role as the heroic Captain Philips.  Hanks wears a beard and dons a New England Yankee accent for the role which helps us think of the hero merchant captain and not think of the two times Oscar winning actor.  This movie is every bit as much a solo effort as the 2000 Tom Hanks success Castaway.  A few other actors come and go on screen but the centrality of the Captain Philips character overwhelms all the others.
 The four Somali pirates provide dramatic, intense and hyper realistic performances but definitely in supporting roles.  The Somalis have no previous acting experience but we certainly cant tell.  Kudos for their terrific and terrifying acting must be shared with the director, Paul Greengrass (The Bourne Ultimatum, The Bourne Supremacy).  Greengrass shows his ability to get the very most out of his actors.  In support of this effort, Greengrass kept the Somalis apart from Hanks until their initial confrontation when the pirates board the cargo ship with guns in the captains face.  Scary.
 In a particularly terrifying sequence, and a long sequence at that, the four pirates trap the ships captain the ships captain in a fully enclosed life boat.  Not only do the pirates in the small enclosed space have plenty of guns which they more or less continuously use to frighten their captive, they continuously eat Khat (or Quat), a local plant with amphetamine like characteristics.  Trapped in an enclosed space with four pirates blasted on speed, desperate and armed to the teeth scares the Jeepers out of the captain and the audience too.  I think the life boat sequence is one of the best scenes ever put on film.  This caliber of movie making keeps me coming back into the theater, in hopes that I will see something like this.  I have to give Captain Philips a strong four saw blade rating.
 Hanks hasn't had a huge box office live action success since the 2009 Angles and Demons.  The $55 million budget for Captain Philips should be returned to the producers with interest.  It brought in $26 million in North America opening weekend and should do well overseas.  Hanks should garner another Oscar nomination for this role.  He really is outstanding.
 Billy Ray (The Huger Games) penned the script from a book by the real Captain Philips.  It runs a tense and exciting two hours and 14 minutes.  You will like this PG-13 true life thriller.  Go see it.  Good movie making deserves our support.",1470009600,,2543,4.775229357798165

6062686,5,B00G7M190U,"It's hard to find anything that Tom Hanks has done that isn't at least appealing, and more often excellent. ""Captain Phillips"" is no exception. The movie follows Captain Richard Phillips, his crew, and a group of Somali pirates through the hijacking of the U.S. container ship Maersk Alabama in 2009. The script seems accurate to the events which unfolded. But the tension of the situation will keep you glued to your seat throughout the film. We find in the character of Captain Phillips, an uncommon bravery in the face of horrible events -- and in the scenario itself, a sense of the hopelessness that more than any other influence drives such events in this part of the world.

Due to violence, this is definitely adult entertainment. But it is worth seeing and thinking about.",1466208000,,781,4.8283582089552235

6062873,5,B00G7M190U,"EXCELLENT! I was deeply impressed by this film! Paul Greengrass signed here a genuine masterpiece. This is one of those films which will never age and will still be a darn good viewing once we are all long gone. Below, more of my impressions, with some limited SPOILERS.

This film tells a true story, about the fateful meeting which took place in 2009 between a huge American container ship ""Maersk Alabama"" and a bunch of Somali pirates. Two main characters are captain Phillips (Tom Hanks), the skipper of ""Maersk Alabama"" and Abduwali Muse (Barkhad Abdi), the leader of the pirates. The film sticks very closely to the real facts, therefore I will not say anything more about the story, in order to avoid spoilers.

Exactly like in the earlier and equally formidable ""United 93"" Paul Greengrass managed to reproduce the feeling of reality of those events and keep the story close to the facts when in the same time adding all the necessary ingredients of an action thriller. The pace of the film is fast and nervous, the tension incredible, the characters interesting and even if the real issue of the whole situation is known in advance, we still let take ourselves for the ride - and it is a GREAT one!

Tom Hanks is of course very good in this film, but the real performance is that of young and inexperienced Somali-American actors, beginning with Barkhad Abdi, for whom it was the first contact with show business ever. Paul Greengrass directed them with incredible skill, because you would swear that they are all Hollywood veterans.

The pirates in this film seem to be a quite truthful image of real Somali sea bandits. They are clearly bad and very dangerous people but in the same time they are also kind of pathetic - especially when they try to boast... This film shows very well, that some poor, in fact destitute people (they clearly don't eat three meals every day) for whom it is natural to feel some sympathy, can also be evil - very evil... Of course, they will also always find justification for the evil they do - when in the same time there are countless thousands of equally miserable people who soldier on honestly through life and don't commit crimes...

This narration of a real story mixing a genuine sea adventure with elements of action film and some social drama is an IMPRESSIVE achievement. I loved every minute of it and I recommend it with ethusiasm. A must for all amateurs of good cinema. ENJOY!",1452902400,,2434,4.690866510538641

6062875,5,B00G7M190U,I loved this movie.  I am generally very careful of what I watch as a Christian but I have to say that Tom Hanks did an outstanding job in this film and kept it interesting and clean for the most part.  Two thumbs up!,1452816000,3,217,3.909090909090909

6062896,5,B00G7M190U,"Captain Richard Phillips of the Maersk Alabama container ship was en route around the Horn of Africa between Salalah, Djibouti, and Mombasa, Kenya. Five Somali pirate bands were working the area when one was able to get aboard Captain Phillips' ship in April 2009. Toting machine guns and chewing coca leaves (a native Somalia plant), a very potent stimulant that flake and crack cocaine is derived from, they were wired, felt euphoric and invincible. These Somali pirates terrorized the crew and put Captain Phillips through an especially hellacious ordeal. Captain Phillips was able to notified U.S. Maritime Emergency in the U.K. of the attack. The USS Bainbridge Naval ship was dispatched to intercept the Maersk and to peacefully negotiate a settlement. If unsuccessful, an alternative Plan B was set in motion. It involved the Navy SEALs based in Virginia. The SEAL team was authorized by the White House to use any means necessary to resolve the situation with direct orders that Captain Phillips was not to be taken hostage on Somali soil. The prior year the Somalis had captured a Greek ship and were paid $6 million for its safe release. Now, they had upped the ante to a $10 million ransom on this ship and felt justified, because large commercial fishing fleets used netting to dredge their offshore. By overfishing and depleting the fish habitat, this hindered their ability to make a living.",1449878400,,1405,5.0085470085470085

6063017,5,B00G7M190U,"Tom Hanks should have won so many more Oscars than he has. He's top notch in this reenactment of the kidnapping of an American cargo ship captain off Somalia. The four Somali pirates were impressive. The supporting actors were, too, especially the ship's crew. In fact I remembered reading somewhere that some of the actors were actual crewmen and as I was watching I thought they all were. The first time I watched this movie was abroad and there were no subtitles for the Somali dialogue. It was just as suspenseful and intense the second time around, but the big difference was the first time I saw the Somalis as enemies; the second time, as human beings.",1443312000,,659,4.641025641025641

6063075,5,B00G7M190U,"I admit that one of the reasons why I saw the Captain Phillips movie had to do with the fact that I happened to still be in the navy (stationed in Norfolk Virginia) when the incident surrounding the MV Maerks Alabama occurred, and as with millions of others I heard of the story (that this movie is based on) through the news media. The Captain Phillips movie opens with Captain Richard Phillips himself (Tom Hanks) and his wife Andrea Phillips (Andrea Keener) getting ready for work in Underhill Vermont and leaving around the same time as they discuss various matters surrounding what is going on in their life. The movie also shows the area (Eyl Somalia) where the pirates such as Abduwali Muse (Barkhad Abdi)and Nour Najee (Faysal Ahmed) gathered. The Captain Phillips movie showed that even before MV Maersk Alabama disembarked from the Salalah Port Oman that Captain Phillips himself wanted many of the entrances to the ship closed the night before it went underway at sea.  Before the pirates embarked the ship Captain Phillips and his crew initially tried calling U.S. Maritime Emergency but nobody picked up. However, they then called the Martime Trade Operations in Dubai and then got ahold of the U.S. Maritime Emergency line (In Northwood UK) the next day. The movie also has references to USS Bainbridge, USS Halyburton, and men from a Seal Staging base in Virginia that were all necessary to dispatch to deal with what happened. The situation was extremely serious to the point where communications between Admiral Michelle Howard and one of the ships commanding officers was orchestrated in a way to carry out a plan that was necessary to help prevent Captain Phillips from reaching the shores of his capturers.  A medical professional by the last name of OBrien was seen treating Captain Phillips during the movie and towards the end the following information is listed; Richard Phillips returned to Vermont on April 17, 2009 and was reunited with his family. Abduwali Muse was convicted of piracy and is currently serving 33 years at the Federal Correctional Complex in Terre Haute Indiana.",1440028800,,2107,4.9660056657223794

Hanks's movies like this are the ones you just wish had one more half hour in them.  Very realistic and enjoyable.

6063100,5,B00G7M190U,"Finally!  The Tom Hanks of 15 years ago is back!  I miss that Tom Hanks.  The one who'd play important and legendary main roles in memorable storylines of classic movies.  This Tom Hanks never should have left if you ask me.

Captain Phillips is about the Somali pirates incident of 2009.  I honestly didn't know the details until watching this movie.  Whether this is 100% authentic to the real incident that occurred I wouldn't know the answer to that one, but I assume, like usual when it comes to Hollywood movie writing, bits and pieces are exaggerated for the purpose of providing a satisfying movie to the viewers.  Anyway even if you had no knowledge of the Somali incident 6 years ago, you can find enjoyment simply by being absorbed into a VERY well-written and suspenseful storyline.  Captain Phillips does everything right.  It builds suspense very well (perhaps a little *too* well since I started to get worn out after 1 hour/30 minutes in when it's obvious Barkhad Abdi isn't going to flat out kill Tom Hanks character despite coming dangerously close on a few occasions).

Anyway Tom Hanks is the captain of a container ship.  He's Captain Phillips, and it's his job to make sure his crew can make the proper deliveries.  But he's travelling down dangerous territory on the east side of Africa (and apparently he's aware of the dangers but proceeds anyway, which makes me wonder why he didn't have guns and other protective weapons on board).  For the first 45 minutes I found myself surprised when the pirates pushed their boat so hard the motor failed, and they were stranded about a mile away from the container ship.  They decide to wait until morning to fix it while Tom and crew cautiously watch over them with binoculars and make important precautionary calls.

However none of this ultimately matters because eventually the pirates find a way to climb onboard with machine gun fire, their own ladder and persistence the likes of which the crew did NOT anticipate.  This all really surprised me.  I guess I didn't realize how acclimated to the ocean the pirates would be.  Man, how could the crew not have weapons to defend themselves?  They did know the potential danger signs travelling this area of the water didn't they?  Once the pirates climb up and enter, they mostly focus on the captain which means Tom Hanks gets the brunt of their violence, threats and demands.  They want millions of dollars but there's only 30,000 dollars onboard.  Well that's certainly not going to sit well with the pirates!  The head pirate, Barkhad Abdi, speaks English but it's broken and hard to understand.  Not sure if he's faking that or not.  Either way he's a terrific actor and very believable in his demands.

What's unintentionally hilarious is that these pirates were fooled time and time again by Tom Hanks and other crew members, and yet they weren't able to read between the lines.  For example the crew breaks glass and throws it on the ground in the engine room.  The one vulnerable pirate not wearing shoes opens the door, enters the dark room and steps on the glass cutting his foot wide open.  Tom Hanks was aware this was all intentional, but he patronizes the pirates by lying and trying to explain how the glass got there.  The pirates should have reacted violently and aggressively without hesitation and noticed they were being treated like fools, but instead they were lenient and willing to listen.  It was unbelievable to say the least.  I also like how the pirates kept referring to Tom Hanks simply as ""Irish"" based on his appearance/ethnicity.

Anyway for the first half of the movie there's tons of chaos pertaining to the pirates and the crew members hiding and eventually defending themselves once they're exposed and have temporary control of a pirate, and the second half is when the pirates abandon ship and take Tom Hanks with them on a tiny lifeboat.  This occupies the second half of the film.  Time and time again the pirates wanted to keep Tom Hanks alive for the sake of cooperation with America so they could obtain 10 million dollars through negotiations with the Navy and Max Martini.  Again, these pirates weren't aware they were being fooled with and belittled by the Americans.  Obviously they weren't going to just hand over the money, and obviously they were being extra talkative to the pirates and avoiding the subject at hand as a way to distract and gradually gain the upperhand in the situation one cautious step at a time.  Poor clueless pirates, lol.

This is a VERY action-packed movie.  So much action it's hard to keep up with at times.  Tom Hanks nails a perfect performance.  Odd when he was listening to Eric Clapton's ""Wonderful Tonight"" because I often compare Clapton and Hanks in facial and personality similarities.  Otherwise extraordinary top-notch acting, a well-written storyline that's probably mostly realistic, and tons of excitement around every corner.  A must watch suspense!",1438732800,,4961,4.846611177170035

The pirates were well written and acted too, though. Once the Navy showed up, you knew it was bad news for them. Despite their criminal acts, I hoped for a little sympathy for the ne'er do wells.

Filming on a ship on the sea gave this movie a bit of fresh air that isn't seen in a lot of action films. That was interesting too.

The best part was that it is based on a true story. The Somali pirates were big news for a long time. This particular story turned things around and lead to a change in shipping company policies (namely that they stopped leaving their ships undefended).

Captain Phillips had to always be one mental thought ahead of his high jackers.  He had no time to show his fears so I never knew he had them.  The ending was so moving for me that who wouldn't cry?

All the sections in the trailers are out of the way in the first 30 minutes and you are then treated to an excellent experience.  Nail-biting in parts.

6063208,5,B00G7M190U,"CAPTAIN PHILLIPS

I am sure you all remember when this happened and those pirates took over Phillips ship. It was a big news story for obvious reasons which lead to a happy ending for the Captain. So when the movie was announced I was thinking, wow that was fast. I was sure the film would be good though as most true story flicks are. The director was behind United 93 and the Bourne movies while the writer who wrote this based on the book had written Hidden Assassin, Harts War, and The Hunger Games among other fun flicks. So I knew going in that this would be good plus Tom Hanks looked like he was back in his prime with this role.

The film follows Captain Phillips and his crew leading up to and after they are attacked and taken hostage by some Somali pirates. So to save his crew he lets them take him and he is held for a ransom. But the United States military are making their way there to try and work this situation out. The mission is to save the Captain and bring him home.

Now I am sure you all knew that so I could have gone into detail but just in case I decided not to. I will say that the film is really well made and Tom Hanks is back. He does an excellent job here as does the entire cast including the young man that played the lead Somali pirate here. That dude was excellent so I hope he continues with this career. The Blu-Ray/DVD comes with a great making of and behind the scenes feature as well as a commentary among other things.

I recall hearing about the true story and praying for this Captain throughout the ordeal.  I had no idea that he went through so much.  I was surprised to see that the characters in Somalia could speak fluent English, that is their captain was able to do so.  The movie demonstrated what a little boat can do.  I was amazd to see how they were able to catch this huge ship.  I then was thrilled to see our Navy SEALS in action.  If you never had the privilege to watch them in action, this movie really captures their strategic skills.

He's very human and relatable. The story is based on a true story of Somali pirates attempting to hijack the Maersk ship Alabama. The crew hides and the ship is shut down at sea while the Pirates search for the crew and try to restart the ship. They escape the ship in a motorized life boat with the Captain played by Tom Hanks.

I love the whole story to it and could not believe when the pirates had took over. I mean they were only 4 to the over 10 on board. I mean granted that the captain had everything under control. I think it was very smooth how he used mind tricks to get the pirate to do the suggested things. I mean in that situation you can subliminally suggest something but it won't always go so smoothly.

6063268,3,B00G7M190U,"Not much can be said about this movie that people don't already know from the true event.  Granted, Hollywood did take their own spin on it for obvious reasons, but I don't think (and nor should I) I need to go into great detail on the events surrounding the movie.  If you don't know about the situation then you need to pay more attention to the news.  I know it happened five years ago, but you still should have known about the situation.

The acting was superb.  Ill get to Tom Hanks in a minute.  First I want to talk about Barkhad Abdi.  This is his first movie, but he played it like a veteran.  You was probably extremely nervous having to stand toe to toe with a real veteran actor like Tom Hanks, but he didn't let that stop him from turning in a stellar performance.  Great things are going to come from this man in the future.

Then you have Tom Hanks.  Just looking at him, he looks like he is the nicest man on the Earth.  How anyone could be mean to him (I know it was in the script and what really happened, but Im just being hypothetical here) is beyond me.  I think the only time I have ever heard him curse in a movie was in Saving Private Ryan.  The man can act.  He is definitely in my top five of actors.  There is only a few movies in his resume that I don't like, and those are from the 1980s.  Not much can be said about his performance in this one.

Another actor I want to mention who was in the movie is Max Martini.  He is one of two actors that I think are extremely underrated at the moment.  Mostly because he is type casted in the role he played as a Navy SEAL.  He plays it perfectly, but he has other acting abilities.  They need to use him more.

Paul Greengrass I like as a director, but I got sick of seeing the camera move all the time.  I know he was doing it as a way to show that the audience was on the ship as well, but he got annoying real fast.  That is the reason the movie didn't get a higher rating from me.

I give the movie a 7 out 10.  If it wasn't for the camera movements, it would have been a 9.",1427760000,,2051,3.9754299754299756

6063302,4,B00G7M190U,"One of the finest acting one will ever see. Not only Tom Hanks but Barkhad Abdi and Co. performed out of their skin. The movie keeps you on the edge of the seat throughout. It is the adventurous, emotional and goosebumping ride in the mid of the sea. This movie is an experience which one cant even afford to miss. Be it the emotional outbursts of the captain or the desperation in the eyes of those Pirates, this movie is so substantial that it will occupy your mind for the next few days. The best part of the movie is that it takes off so quickly that you hardly wait for the matter to start. But even an interesting or unfortunate incidents like these, if not presented well may loose all of its substance. That is why, apart from acting one has to appreciate the effort of Paul Greengrass for the wonderful direction of this movie. Not even for a moment one feels lagging behind or feel anything out of sight. A must watch for everyone!!",1425859200,,942,4.357954545454546

6063334,1,B00G7M190U,Movie was great.  UHD quality was horrible.,1424390400,,43,5.142857142857143
6063335,5,B00G7M190U,"I used to know this guy who argued that people were ""no longer evolving.""  His evidence?  ""Pressures are less on modern-day humans,"" which is making them lazy.  And less evolved.  I was ambivalent at the time, because while I understood his point, I wasn't so sure that there was ""less pressure on humans.""  It's just that the pressures are becoming different.

And you might agree with me -- and disagree with him -- if you watch ""Captain Phillips.""  Without a spoiler, at the beginning of the movie, Tom Hanks -- playing Richard Phillips -- and Catherine Keener -- playing his wife in a very abbreviated cameo (I'm a big fan of hers, so I wish that we saw more of her here) -- are driving to the airport, where the Captain will catch a plane to wherever his ship is ported, presumably Somalia.  During that drive, he is discussing how difficult life has become in the modern age, the pressures of modern society, and how he thinks that their children will even have a more difficult life than they had.  Indeed.

And then in a parallel scene, shown just afterwards, you see Somalian pirates being picked for their next assignment, and you just know that that assignment will be to hijack the Captain's ship for ransom.  It is inevitable.  But during this scene, you realize that these pirates have massive pressures on them as well, probably even more than we do in America.  By the way, the film doesn't moralize, but rather presents this as the usually-useless-but-not-here tautology ""It is what it is.""  Indeed again.

While watching, I thought immediately of the incredible film ""Flight 93.""  As a matter of fact, even though I've seen it before, I added it to my Watch-List so that I can screen it again; it is that awesome.  These films share many qualities, but maybe the best one of all:  neither one moralizes; the films leave that up to the viewer.  It only heightens the experience.

I don't know if Mr. Hanks was up for an Academy Award for this film, but he surely deserved one -- his should-have-been third?  In particular, avoiding a spoiler by limiting information, his acting at the very end of the film is perfect.  I've been in similar situations -- surely not as traumatic as his, however -- but his acting is exactly how people in this situation behave.  He is beyond traumatized, and it shows.  It is a rare moment of brilliant acting, in a nearly-brilliant film.

Well, for those of you who think that life has become easier in the 21-st century, that humans are under ""less pressure,"" that we are no longer ""evolving"" -- not in the best ways for sure, although evolution doesn't care about morality --  I urge you to watch this film.  You most likely will quickly change your mind, while simultaneously making that other guy eat his words.",1424390400,,2765,4.635802469135802

Those two movies were well done BUT I just didn't feel compelled to watch them for a second time. This movie on the other hand was taut and riveting with great acting by the Somali actors portraying the pirates and the last scene with Captain Phillips was surprisingly moving and charged with raw emotion.

Granted, there is a lot of controversy surrounding the accounts of how things actually went down and a lot of the actual crew weren't happy about how  Hollywood had put a different spin on things. Naturally it's Hollywood and show business so one shouldn't be too surprised at the creative license taken by the writer of the screen play.

Either way, I still highly recommend this movie.",1421798400,,792,4.72463768115942

6063493,4,B00G7M190U,"Captain Phillips is based on the true story of the hijack of the Maersk Alabama by Somali pirates. This incident led to merchant mariner,Captain Richard Phillips,being taken hostage in the Indian Ocean by Abduwali Muse and his crew. The account was taken from the book,A Captain's Duty: Somali Pirates, Navy SEALs, and Dangerous Days at Sea,written by by Phillips himself together with Stephan Talty.

The film focuses on the relationship between the Alabama's commanding officer, Captain Phillips and the Somali pirate captain, Muse during the hostage incident. Both are set on an unstoppable collision course when Muse and his crew target Phillips' unarmed ship. In the ensuing standoff as well as that of the US Navy and the Somali pirates,all find themselves at the mercy of each other. It ends when the three SEAL marksmen finally get three clear shots and simultaneously kill the pirates as Phillips was about to be executed by his hostage takers. The final scenes reveal Muse is taken into custody and arrested for piracy while Phillips is rescued and treated.

While critics and many reviewers found this film to be a masterpiece,I myself saw many flaws in it. The scenes between the US Navy and the Somalian pirates particularly when it comes to negotiations with Captain Phillips somewhats undermine the Navy's skill in handling the situation considering that the Somalian pirates are not that knowledgeable and could be deemed as inferior opponents. The amount of time they needed and the excessive manpower used against 4 Somalian pirates before managing to save Phillips could be described somewhat more of an embarrassment and viewers may find themselves asking the Navy's capability in rescue operations. Aside from that,the constant shaking of the camera is found to be a distraction while watching it. Added to that,the tension of the film decreases and the viewer may become impatient as the film ends especially at the point when Phillips tried to escape his captors and too much Navy manpower are rendered clueless in dealing with the Somalians and the empathy for Phillips decreases at a certain point of the film. But despite of the negative things I have said,I felt that Tom Hanks delivered a wonderful performance and was able to overcome the things that I have mentioned in watching this film. He definitely provided one great performance and he exhibited range which he has never shown in his previous movies. Also,we get to see great acting by Barkhad Abdi. Overall,I would consider it one good movie but far from a masterpiece that garnered many Academy Award nominations with possible exceptions to the performances Hanks and Abdi.",1418169600,,2661,5.10091743119266
6063494,4,B00G7M190U,"Good movie. I know it may not have been totally accurate but the acting in it from Tom Hanks was amazing.

6063499,5,B00G7M190U,"Great movie overall. Tom Hanks is an amazing actor (not sure I've ever seen him in anything where he wasn't great). Captain Phillips is the captain of a cargo ship that gets overrun by pirates (real ones; no eye-patches, hooks, peg-legs, or parrots). I had just read ""No Easy Day"" which goes into this story a little bit, so I was looking forward to the movie. However, the movie hardly has any focus on the SEAL team (film is almost exclusively from Captain Philips perspective, with a little bit of Navy build-up for the rescue operation).

I don't want to spoil the ending, but you already know that Captain Philips dies in the end (in an unfortunate encounter with Sharks as he tries to swim toward the Navy ship).",1418083200,,718,4.565891472868217

Ever since The Blair Witch Project, the movie industry has decided that in order to make the audience feel like they are eye witnesses to the action, they need to keep the camera in constant motion.

Not only zooming in and out, panning back and forth and shaking/jerking the camera around but also cutting from different angles every 2 seconds or less! EVERY 2 SECONDS!!!

6063630,5,B00G7M190U,"This is a thrilling movie and Tom Hanks and virtually every other actor in the film is at the top of their game. I'm sure everyone knows the basic plot: a sea captain from Vermont is taking a commercial ship along the east coast of Africa and the ship is hijacked by Somali pirates. In reality though, this is a very human story about one man's courage (in fact, his whole crew showed remarkable courage) and will to survive.

It also paints, I think, a fairly honesty and sympathetic portrait of the Somali people and why they were forced to turn to piracy. These are obviously not hoods out trolling the high seas for easy marks: these are starving people whose traditional line of work, fishing, has been stolen away from them by giant European commercial fishing boats.

It's a fascinating movie, beautifully filmed and perfectly acted (when is Tom Hanks not great?). I watched the movie twice in about a two-week period and saw so much in the second viewing that I hadn't see in the first.

I understand from various news reports that some members of the boats crew dispute the captain's account of the event, but much of this story is based on facts provided by the Navy Seal reports, so I think the story is probably quite accurate. I'm going to read the book sometime this winter and see how it jibes with the film.

Good film, worth watching.",1412640000,,1351,4.5473251028806585
6063631,3,B00G7M190U,Meh. The movie dedicated a lot of time on the struggles of a few Westerners. How about spending just as much time on thinking about the causes of piracy in East Africa?

6063691,4,B00G7M190U,"""Captain Phillips"" is an embellished narration of the 2009 hijacking of the American merchant ship Maersk Alabama in the Gulf of Aden by Somali pirates. Richard Phillips, captain of that ship, wrote a memoir of the incident, co-authored by Stephan Talty, entitled ""A Captain's Duty: Somali Pirates, Navy SEALs, and Dangerous Days at Sea,"" on which much of the film is based. In view of piracy in the area, Captain Phillips (Tom Hanks) requests that his crew tighten security as he goes over the route the Maersk Alabama will take with First Officer Murphy (Michael Chernus). Well into their journey, about 250 nautical miles off the coast of Somalia, in spite of the crew's valiant efforts, 4 pirates led by a man named Muse (Barkhad Abdi) board the ship wielding AK-47s. The crew hides in the engine room while Captain Phillips tries to bribe the pirates with $30,000 in the ship's safe. With the crew taking the initiative against the pirates, and the pirates determined to extract profit from their excursion, events evolve into a hostage situation.

My impression of ""Captain Phillips"" was that its primary purpose was to advertise or glorify the US Navy. Scenes on the USS Bainbridge, under the command of Cdr. Frank Castellano (Yul Vazquez), make all the whiz-bang technology for which the US taxpayer foots the bill look super-efficient and effective. The US is responsible for anti-pirate operations in that part of the world and spends a good deal of effort monitoring pirate activities and aiding victims when necessary, and here we get to see how they work, at least theoretically. The officers are all handsome, the soldiers all disciplined, and the technology all works. So we might be getting an optimistic picture. There is also a lot of action to pump up the audience's adrenaline levels. I suspect this is exaggerated. I haven't read Capt. Phillips book, so I don't know how many liberties were taken with his dialogue and actions. But there is a lawsuit by members of the crew alleging that Phillips and the shipping company were partly responsible for the incident, because Phillips refused to take the ship farther out to sea.

Director Paul Greengrass brings his signature documentary style to the film, meaning a lot of wobbly handheld shots. He gets his camera into the middle of the action. That's appropriate in a film of this kind, especially one based on true events, and I don't think it's overdone. But, if you're sensitive to camera shake, you may not want to eat while watching. Tom Hanks is perfect in this part, because he can keep the audience focused even when he is isolated, a skill he demonstrated to its epitome in ""Cast Away"" (2000). Barkhad Abdi deservedly received an Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting actor, but Faysal Ahmed, who played the most volatile pirate, is also deserving of praise. It's tricky to convey foreign values, desperation, and the difficult choice between an American trap and an angry warlord in broken English, subtitles, and a lot of yelling. The film is too long at 2 hours 15 minutes, however. Half an hour should have been cut. Nevertheless, it is entertaining and effective in making the Navy heroic and Capt. Phillips a sympathetic victim.",1410393600,,3221,4.930018416206262

6063789,4,B00G7M190U,"This was a gripping, chilling film, and Tom Hanks does a great job. The actors playing the Somalians kept the intensity on high throughout as well. I didn't remember hearing about this event so I did not know what was going to happen in the film. I agree with the posts asking commenters not to reveal full plots without using spoiler tags. I often will skim a few reviews prior to seeing a film to see if most people liked it,though with a Tom Hanks film, that's a safe bet, and therefore the comment that people shouldn't come here until after, is just rude and thoughtless.

As angry as the hijacking all the way through made me, the most frightening scene in the film was the one in which the ship's crew of 19 have to hide for their lives, and Hanks as the captain, standing alone, watching in fear as four, only FOUR soulless cretins come tooling up in a boat the size of a bathtub, and take over the ship the comparable size of a mountain, terrorizing everyone on board. How can this happen and be allowed to happen? I don't know anything about maritime law but it's inconceivable to me that ships are sent into areas with high pirating activity, with no way to or right to protect themselves. The actual captain said piracy is a fact of life on the high seas and that may be, but having to face murderous thugs, unarmed and defenseless should not be. In my opinion, hostile forces should be permanently neutralized if they get within a mile of a ship. There was not the least bit of equity of force or power and there is no way these pirates should have been able to take over or even get close to the ship.

The movie's synopsis states that both Phillips and the Somali captain undertake an emotional journey throughout the hijacking and kidnapping, but I didn't see this to be true. Muse was as much a terrorist at the end as he was in the beginning. I did see Phillips try to get the kid to give himself up and save his own life, which indicates a journey of sorts, and the kind of person Phillips was and is. I also didn't feel one bit sorry for Muse or any of the Somali adults. I know they have an impoverished country but a little money would have gone a long way to better their lives, and Muse refuses to take the money, then bragging about receiving millions for previous hijackings. Phillips asks him what he is doing there then, and to me the answer was that Muse and the others had no humanity, but lived only to hurt and kill others.

I don't usually cry when watching films, but I was having a hard time when Phillips was in the medical bay, all right. Another powerful film for Hanks.",1407456000,,2608,4.329243353783231

The story isn't worth talking about but at the end, Hanks is saved by Navy Seals and yes, Haliburton (Evil, Inc.).

6063886,5,B00G7M190U,Awesome movie!  Tom Hanks has always been a favorite of mine but this movie kept you on the edge of your seat all the way.  Tom Hanks did a great job of telling the true story of Captains Phillip's ordeal,1404691200,,204,4.075
6063887,4,B00G7M190U,"I'm sure your all familiar with the true story of Captain Phillips? If not let me tell you alittle bit about the event that started on April 8th 2009 and ended four long days later on April 12th. Four Somali Pirates attacked the Maersk Alabama cargo ship on route toward Mombasa, Kenya and after a struggle they got on board with the intentions of taking over the ship and sailing it to Somalia. However the crew fought back and the pirates were forced to leave the ship on a lifeboat, with the captain as a hostage. After 3 days on the lifeboat, the U.S military were able to safely rescue Phillips from the pirates. I had previously herd about this on the news. It was fascinating, and I knew at once it had potential to be film adapted. And here we are, October 2013. Captain Phillip and his crew's story of heroism and survival have been painted onto the big screen. The film went onto be nominated for Best Picture at the Academy Awards. It didn't win, but I can see why it got nominated. It's a great film, and I'll tell you why. My review of 'Captain Phillips'.

'Captain Phillips' tells the true story of the crew of the Maersk Alabama cargo ship of which was on route toward Mombasa, Kenya when a group of four Somali Pirates hijacked the ship. But when the crew fought back, the four Somalians were forced to hold the Captain (Played by Tom Hanks) hostage on a life boat.

Ok, so I may have just spoiled the whole film for you. But odds are you have already read in the paper the story of the Maersk Alabama cargo ship hijacking and already knew what was going to happen. Anyways, the story is told in a pretty solid fashion. The cast which includes real simalians (Smart casting decision) powerfully convey the emotions and energy that the real crew and pirates were probably having at the time of the incident. 'Tom Hanks' leads the cast as the Captain. With Hanks, you used to be able to tell that if he's in the film, it's going to be good, but lately with disaster 'Larry Crowne' and pile of migraines 'Cloud Atlas' you can't tell anymore. But rest easy, maybe Hanks is getting back to his old self. He acts with ease, sending the audience the heartbreaking emotions of his predicament. His acting leads the film, and you want him to make it, to continue to fight back and get on. He played perfectly the average man, ho when thrusted into a problem acts as any average man would act. Not all John McClain sudden action hero. His last 5 minutes of screentime are the most emotional minutes the entire film has, all because of his performance. 'Barkhad Abdi' is the scene stealer though as the leader of the hijacking pirates. He is smart, leadership worthy, and pitiful. He isn't the worst guy; he just wants money and will do anything for it. He isn't crazy or just plain kill-hungry. He just wants money. He stole all the scenes he had, and I wish he'd been given a better chance at the Academy Awards.

What makes 'Captain Phillips' a success is its direction from 'Paul Greengrass'. Greengrass successively captures the true story on camera with skill. His camera work is impressive and smart, bringing you into the action, seeing things the way Phillips and other's see things. It's really worthwhile to watch. He gives us a few nice shots of the boats as well as a view of Somalia. Oh, and we can't forget those neat shots of the lifeboat from the U.S military's point of view... that was pretty neat.

A problem here is the jagged editing. The pace doesn't help anything either. The film runs to fast into its action and the editing doesn't keep up, jolting us back and forth with quick glances at Hanks and then to Abdi and it makes your eyes kind of roll right into your head. The editing and pacing make it hard for you to concentrate on the emotional center the cast is trying to convey. It's too fast and jittery for you to be able to grab anything to hold onto. It ends in a blur, a big blue blur. You try your best to keep steady but in the end it tips you over. Not to say it ruined the film, just made it harder to fully engulf yourself into when you have to concentrate on everything to make sure you processed it. If you will, relate the pacing to a speeding motor boat, and relate the editing to the hard waves you hit when your fast boat hits the waves. That's what you feel watching this. However points go to it as well, for keeping you on the edge of your seat.

The music gives a very dynamic performance as well. Even if the film isn't as holding as it should be, the music tries to catch the viewer and hold them as long as it can. It is original, it is moving, it is almost as quick and loud as the film itself is, and it holds you. It gets you to the edge of your seat. It's like a beating and as soon as someone moves it grows loud jumping out at you, to waken you, get you more invested in what is about to go down. In the end it's a clever score, with a few nice bits of music that work well with the scene's going on.

The script is very smart as well. The script writer, 'Billy Ray', adapts the true story in very good fashion. While I'll admit, he does add to the story to more fully cinematize the story for the big screen. But, gratefully enough it doesn't do anything to alter the story too much, but instead showcases the heroics of the crew and Captain. It's the true American tale and it's told quite well. There seem to be no inaccuracies here, it looks to me that 'Billy Ray' took some time to research the ship and such to make the film as accurate as possible, and I have to pat him on the back for his work. The script deserved the nod at the Academy Awards for best screenplay. It's a solid and smart script and beyond tense, even if it isn't as emotionally driven as it could've and should've been.

Making use of its solid 50 million budge, the film sports great production values, what with the ships and scenery and waves, it's all put to the best use to make this tale as accurate in portrayal as it is on paper. 'Paul Greengrass' knew what he wanted to do with the true tale, and succeeds in using what he had to faithfully adapt the story for the screen.

All and all, 'Captain Phillips' is a solidly acted, tense, and smartly scripted film from the great 'Paul Greengrass' but I must express my sadness at the film not having been as emotionally connected as it should have been. B+ 3/27/14

P.S: Next up for 'Tom Hanks' was playing another real life hero... just not in the same fashion as Walt Disney in 'Saving Mr. Banks'. I have yet to see the film, but from Hank's performance here, I can hopefully rest at ease that Disney won't go to shame with his onscreen portrayal.",1404691200,,6644,4.3173076923076925

6063894,5,B00G7M190U,"Absolutely, powerful!  Tom Hanks as Captain Phillips was more than acting, it was a transformation.  I stopped seeing the actor and only saw the character, the man, the Captain going through extreme duress while attempting to lead a band of pirates away from hurting or killing his crew.  Barkhad Abidi as Muse ALMOST made you sympathize with his character (I say almost, because no matter how charming or dispossessed Muse had become, he was most definitely the bad guy... even if he was constantly struggling with how much physical harm he was willing to allow to happen to his captive).

The fact that it was based on real events, events that most of us can recall unfolding in the news, is heart-stopping.  Although they seemed to take a long time to arrive, when they got there it changed the whole dynamic of the kidnapping, was the US Navy.  It was eye-opener and my only regret is that I didn't watch this sooner.

Yes, I would highly recommend this film.  It has a great story line, a great cast and once you sit down to watch it you won't be able to look away from the screen.",1404518400,,1086,4.505102040816326

6063936,2,B00G7M190U,"I watched this on the plane and was excited to see it because I followed the story of the Maersk hijacking by Somali pirates.  I liked how the beginning got right to the meat of the story which was Captain Phillips getting aboard the ship.  The middle of the movie had some excitement and suspense but I was waiting for the really, really tense moments.  They never came...

The ending was not that great in my eyes because the timing of the climax was wrong.  The scene that showed the death of the pirates was pretty head-scratching.  The producers set the peak of the suspense when the captain's hands were tied.  Seriously?  Why not focus on the SEALs who had the hardest job which was to get precise shots??

Ok, maybe I don't fall into the mainstream crowd given that I have higher standards.  I watched on Netflix the documentary ""The Hunt for Somali Pirates,"" which I thoroughly enjoyed.  That documentary was five time as exciting as the movie!!  I'd say check that out on Netflix if you want drama.  That documentary elaborates on the skills of the SEALs which is poorly demonstrated in this movie.

I'm not saying this movie didn't keep my attention but I wouldn't watch it again.  The entire movie could have been so much better if the scenes were more developed but instead they were very rudimentary.",1402876800,,1314,4.603448275862069

I liked every bit of this movie from the way they showed just a little of Phillips' life, but not too much, some background on the pirates, but not too much, and so forth.

This is one of those movies that you can sit back and watch, not be offended by constant terrible language or gratuitous nakedness, or just stupid story lines.

6063958,4,B00G7M190U,"Based on an event that garnered worldwide attention in 2009, Captain Phillips tells the tale of two total strangers, both hailing from opposites corners of the earth, who are brought together by circumstance and fate.

One of those individuals is Richard Phillips, the captain of an unarmed cargo ship sailing through international waters off the coast of Africa en route to Mombasa, and the other is Abduwali Muse, the leader of a band of Somali pirates who are determined to board the ship and hold its captain and crew hostage for ransom.

Billy Ray has based his screenplay on the book A Captains Duty by Steven Talty and Phillips himself. The movie, directed with his usual taut precision by Paul Greengrass, relates the story in step-by-step detail, exploring the relationship between these two wildly disparate but equally desperate captains, as a thrilling real-life drama plays itself out on the high seas. While Phillips self-sacrificing heroism - and that of the Navy Seals who successfully took out three of the four pirates - takes center stage in the drama, Ray is still able to give Abduwali his due, making it clear that the young man has been driven to this action as much out of desperation as out of greed or criminal intent, since illegal fishing and the dumping of toxic waste on the part of foreigners in that area have pretty much depleted the Somali fishing grounds, leaving men like Abduwali without any viable means of supporting themselves and their families. Sadly, piracy becomes the next obvious step in the struggle for survival. It would have been easy to have turned Abduwali and his cohorts into one-dimensional villains, but, to their credit, Ray and Greengrass have chosen not to do so.

This complexity of character is attributable in no small measure to the outstanding performances by veteran Tom Hanks and newcomer Barkhad Abdi, who earned an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actor for his work here. Together, they create a human dynamic that carries the film far beyond the heart-stopping, race-against-the-clock surface aspects of the drama. Not that the visceral is in any way slighted, for in true Greengrass fashion, the film moves along at a breakneck pace, rarely slowing down to give the audience a chance to catch its breath along the way.

By far, the most effective scene in the movie comes right near the end, after Phillips has been rescued and is taken to the ships trauma center to ascertain his physical and mental condition. Unlike the vast majority of movies and TV shows in which characters who are subjected to horrifying circumstances seem to bounce back from them almost immediately, Captain Phillips shows us the true human response to a life-shattering, traumatic event (thanks in no small measure to Hanks magnificent acting).

It is just this type of insightful verisimilitude that informs each and every moment of Captain Phillips.",1402099200,,2903,5.0020703933747415

One of the best movies I have seen in a long time.  I think that this is one of Tom Hanks best movies.  The emotions he showed and portrayed had to be so near what the real Captain Phillips felt at the same time.  I think the most heart wrenching part of the entire movie was at the end after he was rescued and taken aboard the U.S. ship.  That part just got to me.  I was so happy to get the dvd, take it overseas with me so my husband could watch it.  Even though I had seen the movie before, I was still sitting on the edge of my seat.

What happens is Captain Philips is running food and furniture around the horn of Africa to needy countries in the region. Somali Pirates get on board the ship and take over, they are looking for a huge pay out, they think the ship will do this for them.

None of the crew gets seriously hurt during the evasion. Captain Philips gets taken captive. End the end all but 1 pirate is killed, he finally makes it to America, just not like he thought he would or would have wanted.",1401667200,,708,4.198529411764706

The event played out over five days until Navy Seal sharpshooters shot the captors in an amazing feat of timing.  I was surprised at how well this film depicted the event.  It is an exciting thriller (even knowing the outcome), but mostly it humanizes the people, particularly the captain and the pirate lieutenant.  The most important scene is the quiet and intimate closer in which the captain, and the audience, experience the significance of the whole encounter, aware that he, and we, are no longer the same people.

Tom Hanks is someone I usually see as playing more with humor but his way of showing the Captain's emotions seemed very realistic to me. The pirate actors were amazing.

6064004,4,B00G7M190U,"How can any movie that has Tom Hanks as the lead be terrible? Even though the actor does not enjoy the kind of success that he once seemed to have, his choice of roles haven't suffered on account of diminished box office returns, Hanks still makes some great films. Captain Phillips gives Hanks another vehicle to display his great range.
In a story based on the 2009 pirate attack  off the Somalian Coast, we get a glimpse of the real Phillips made it and the circumstances that can drive ordinary men to impossible greatness. And the film is all about Hanks- the reluctant hero who must be a leader for his crew and survive at the hands of the pirates, and so incredible is Hanks that you almost forget that he is a superstar. Such is his brilliance that he inspires nothing short of awe when you watch him implode in a scene at the end from all the harrowing days, the unending tension and drama finally taking its toll on an ordinary middle aged man from Vermont, who at the beginning of the world is sharing an observation with his wife about the fast changing world. The film begins as Hanks is being driven to the airport by his wife to a plane that will take him to Africa to his job as the captain of a container ship. As soon as Philips boards the ship it is attacked by a group of Somali outlaws who want to hijack the ship for ransom. They are not armed to the teeth but what makes them dangerous is their bravado and greed. The enemys nature should have been obvious but the director tries to steer us with sympathy about the plight of the pirates and the circumstances under which they became pirates, even hinting that the West could have been indirectly responsible for it.
As I said before the amazing part of the film is watching Phillips and the director Greengrasss handling of the tale. This film is almost 134 minutes but does not feel lengthy thanks to them. A true human story of an ordinary man under extraordinary circumstances.",1400630400,,1954,4.442896935933148

As for the genre, it's VERY intense, very realistic, very hard to watch.  But you should watch.  Right up there with my all-time fav film, Saving Private Ryan, this one exhibits the same care and import, for our modern day terrorists -- here, of the high seas.

The orchestration of efforts by the Navy deserves special attention, and the difficulty of so many professionals fighting four ragtag Somalis, because we have RULES and they do not.  If you're a lawmaker and you don't RECONSIDER how wimpy are our laws, if you don't DEMAND tougher and better support for all our military after watching this film, then please resign from office.

Nobody's perfect and he did most everything right once the pirates appeared.  Who's to say that him really leaving the bridge unlocked didn't stall the pirates, keeping them from finding the others and start killing.  Artistic liberties are always taken for the story's sake - deal with it - they weren't that far off.  There's always an underling who's going to criticize the guy in charge.  So he didn't volunteer for a hostage exchange ... that situation never really allowed itself to happen - how do you know he wouldn't have?  He was closer to shore than he was supposed to be - yeah, he screwed up so what? The story was about addressing the problem when it happened - not avoiding it.  If you believe everything you see in a movie than you're dumber than a box of rocks.

Tom Hanks was good, but the guy looks like Dan Akroyd's long lost twin (and coincidentally Dan probably would have been a more accurate portrayal but that wouldn't have made as good a movie).",1400112000,,1094,4.50761421319797

The only slight negative is that the characters, other than that of Captain Phillips, are somewhat two-dimensional and stereotyped.  The American sailors might be a little dumb, but they are courageous and resourceful.  The characters of the pirates, who are indeed world-class bad guys, nonetheless border on racial or ethnic stereotyping at times.

Rating: 3.5 out of 5.0

'Captain Phillips' is British director Paul Greengrass' convincing recreation of the kidnapping and subsequent rescue of Merchant Marine Captain Richard Phillips by Somali pirates in 2009. Greengrass manages to make things quite believable by no sleight of hand. Firstly, he films most of the story on the high seas, utilizing a sister container ship, filling in for the Maersk Alabama, which four Somali pirates managed to board as it made its way to Mombassa, Kenya in the Indian Ocean.

Greengrass employed three other successful strategies to give the film a heady verisimilitude. There is of course the casting of Tom Hanks as Captain Phillips, a no-nonsense New Englander, who heroically survived a brutal kidnapping. Hanks conveys Phillips' stoicism early on as he ensures that his crew practice drills to prepare themselves for any potential pirate incursions (notably Phillips dispenses with the stoic demeanor at the end of his ordeal and becomes very emotional--probably Hanks' best scene in the entire film). It should be noted that Phillips' crew in real-life, faulted their captain for sailing too close to the Somali coast, which they alleged, put them all at risk. But I believe Phillips' analysis when he comments early on in a meeting with the crew, that they could have been thousands of miles from the coast, and still could have been subject to attack.

Greenbrass also utilizes the sister ship of the USS Bainbride, the Truxtun, along with most of the Navy crew, who also make the eventual rescue operation quite believable. Finally, the casting of the four Somali pirates, neophyte Somali-born actors, who moved to the US when they were young, and who Greengrass found after a casting call in Minneapolis, added greatly to the film's overall realism.

The expository scene where Phillips says goodbye to his wife at the airport, goes on a tad bit too long but things are off and running when he arrives for duty as skipper on the Maersk Alabama in the port of Salalah in Oman. Greengrass then cuts to Somalia where the inciting incident occurs. The four pirates led by Muse (aka 'Skinny'), who eventually successfully board the Maersk and kidnap Phillips, along with another group of pirates, are beholden to a syndicate (headed by a warlord). While they are forced to do this gang's bidding, they don't go grudgingly, as engaging in such nefarious activities as a pirate is viewed as a 'badge of honor'.

Once Phillips is on board the Maersk Alabama, we become privy to just how much knowledge is needed to run a container ship of that size. The first half of 'Captain Phillips' involves the attack and subsequent boarding of the ship by the pirates. As depicted (and as it happened during the actual event), the first attempt to board the ship was a failure. Phillips ends up bluffing one pirate group back to their mother ship after pretending that the American Navy is already on their way. The second group, headed by Muse, decides to try again, and using a ladder, manages this time to successfully board the Maersk. All this appears quite exciting on screen and in watching the Blu-ray extra documentary about the making of 'Captain Phillips' afterward, one must commend Mr. Greengrass for not only his technical expertise in filming the attack scenes but also directing actors who had no actual prior experience manning skiffs on the high seas.

Most of the events depicted in 'Captain Phillips' actually happened but here and there, scenes are concocted for dramatic effect. I'm thinking particularly of the scene where the Maersk crew intentionally leave shards of broken glass near where they're hiding below deck, which leads to the injury of one of the pirates after he steps on the glass, cutting his foot.

After Muse is captured by the Maersk crew and the exchange for Captain Phillips goes awry, the second half of the film begins. The scene inside the cramped lifeboat is perhaps the weakest. Greengrass attempts to establish the personal relationship that develops between Muse and Phillips with Muse claiming that Western companies destroyed their livelihood as fisherman by basically cleaning out the ocean's stock and Phillips rightfully maintaining that no way in the world, Muse and his unpleasant band, were fishermen. The pirates argue over a lack of the local narcotic khat and Phillips attempts to put a bandage on the injured foot of one of the pirates (again, an injury which did not happen during the actual event). There's little tension in the lifeboat scene and Greengrass probably should have compressed it, perhaps partially as a montage, utilizing the film's tension-producing score.

Things pick up again with the arrival of the Bainbridge and the exciting sequence of events, leading to the rescue of Captain Phillips. Before three of the pirates are taken out by Navy marksmen and Muse is tricked into boarding the Bainbridge, to 'negotiate' a ransom, Hanks acquits himself quite nicely where he attempts to escape by diving off the lifeboat and swimming for his life. Greengrass doubles down on the suspense when the pirates tie Phillips up and put a gun to his head, right before they're dispensed with.

Greengrass makes a big point of not being jingoistic after the seals take down three of the four pirate crew. Nonetheless, one cannot completely disagree with Andrew O'hehir, writing in Salon magazine, when he remarks that 'Captain Phillips', has the ""calm technological blankness of a Navy commercial, without the 1970s waka-waka guitar."" AS O'hehir sees it, there are ""billions of dollars of cutting-edge military hardware and hundreds of corn-fed, gym-toned Americans on one side, four malnourished men with black-market Kalashnikovs on the other.""

Still, one can see no justification for piracy. The emotional impact on Phillips is evident in the great final scene as Phillips begins sobbing, as he's being treated by Navy medical personnel. It's a compelling ending to the suspense that comes before.",1399161600,,6042,5.056224899598393
6064068,4,B00G7M190U,"In spite of there being  little violence as far as people getting killed in this story, it's a very tense one, dealing more with characterization than action and heroics per se. Even the so-called leader of the pirates (so-called because he quickly loses what little control he has over his men) appears to want  as little bloodshed as possible. There are some clever attempts at defense (Phillips' making a false a call for help, knowing his radio is being monitored; his men placing broken glass for the barefooted pirates to step on), a few little ironies, such as the pirate's stating his ""love of the US"" as he threatens to kill Phillips to get one of his captured men back, and his wish to travel to the States coming above in the most ironic way possible.  The film does seem a little overlong running 2 hrs-plus. Since this time is supposed to encompass several days, I guess that isn't such a long span though the way it is filmed makes it appear only one day passes.  To me, the best part of the entire story were the last minutes before the closing credits in which Phillips' reaction to his ordeal is shown...as he very quietly comes apart in the USS Bainbridges' infirmary.",1399161600,,1186,4.580188679245283
6064069,5,B00G7M190U,"You want tense? This movie has it.

There's an air of foreboding from the opening onward and it doesn't let up, even in the quiet moments as the ship puts out to sea and the captain greets to his crew.  From the first emergency drill which soon after turns into the real thing, there are taut nerves all the way. According to all I've read, it took the navy an entire day to come to the rescue which to my way of thinking is one day too many, as well as the way Phillips is told the ships he spots on his radar are ""probably just fishing vessels.""

Well-acted but remarkably nonviolent as a whole, it's a tight-nerved ride for a little over two hours which had me thinking, ""what would I do in a situation like that?"" The last ten minutes are cathartic for both audience and characters and if you can get through them without shedding one tear...of relief or empathy...you're a better man than I am,Gunga Din!",1399161600,,909,4.3352941176470585

I was shocked to see and hear the voice of the real Captain Phillips as he and Tom Hanks sound exactly alike to me.

This film is 2 hours and 14 minutes of good story and edge of your seat terror for the real Captain Phillips.  It is interesting to see how the story unwound and how Captain Phillip's actions and quick thinking saved his crew.  The pirates were played by realistic actors and the tension on the big screen was over the top.  With the pirates high on a drug called Khat you never knew when and if one of them would explode and kill or severely injure Captain Phillips.

Tom Hanks is such a good actor and you really feel for the character he plays.  I remember when this story was unfolding on the news and it was great to be able to see the movie made about it.  I hate to say it, but you do have some sympathy for the Somali people because their way of life is so bad compared to Americans, but it still does not excuse choosing a life of crime.  I would definitely recommend this movie.  It also gave me more insight into the shipping industry.  If the captain had only been able to have a firearm.  I believe in the right to defend yourself - the criminals certainly have guns!!",1398211200,,771,4.197278911564626

Anyway, Tom Hanks does his usual outstanding job. He was particularly moving after the ordeal ended and he let out a flood of emotions. Barkhad Abdi as the kidnappers' leader also does a great job, particularly considering he's not a professional actor, as I understand. The other kidnappers and supporting actors were also very credible.
The mark of a good movie is that, even when you know how it will end, it keeps you in suspense. This very much does so.",1398124800,,584,4.4672897196261685

The Somalian actors were literally guys picked up off the street! They were cab drivers and other low-wage jobs in Minnesota...they did an incredible job.

I also credit the writers for making this very true to the actual story. Yes, I know the Captain was more at fault than portrayed. But compare to ARGO (2012's Best Picture winner) which completely fabricated many of the key scenes. Yes, Phillips actually DID try escaping in the ocean, warded off one attack before the second one succeeded...they did not make up more than you would expect.",1398124800,,707,4.648

His facial expressions portray the emotions of Phillips perfectly, and the ending of the movie left me literally sobbing.

The movie gets intense the longer it goes. You'll be on the edge of your seat at the end.

I will not argue about Oscar nominations because the Oscar nominations it got are the ones it deserved. Tom Hanks didn't not deserve one simply because he was still recognizable as himself. The other character, played by Barkhad Abdi was an original extraordinary character, and those are the kind that get nominated for Oscars.",1397952000,,809,4.5793103448275865

6064166,4,B00G7M190U,"{4.25 stars}

All politics aside, CAPTAIN PHILLIPS has a gripping plot with excellent all-around acting and cinematography. The storyline is straightforwardly simple, without a lot of extraneous nonsense. Even though the audience already knows basically what will happen and how it will most likely wind up, there are a number of unexpected minor twists. CAPTAIN PHILLIPS also gives a very convincing portrayal of life on a modern U.S. freighter. Regardless of how faithful to the actual story it is--and there are always some changes in that area--I also like the fact that there are no unconvincing heroics (hair's-breadth rescues, etc) here, with a very believable and effective ending.

Some may not like the micro-view this film gives, without anything in the way of news flashes back home, the reactions of the crews' families after the hijacking of the ship, etc. That would, however, have detracted from the tension and forward motion of the film and unnecessarily complicated things. Still, a little more on what happens with the MV Maersk Alabama and the pirate mother-ship later in the story would have been a plus.",1397865600,,1126,5.147540983606557

6064175,5,B00G7M190U,"Tom Hanks gave an excellent performance as Capt. Phillips. He saved his crew from the Maersk Alabama by allowing the Somali pirates to take him instead. The Navy orchestrated an awesome job to rescue Capt. Phillips from the Somali's. For me, the best part of the movie was the end, when Capt. Phillips is brought aboard the Navy ship and taken to the infirmary. He is in shock from his ordeal, and Hanks' portrayal is awesome as he shows raw emotion and gratitude for the medical personnel that will be taking care of him. I cried at the end. This movie was one of the best I have seen in a very long time, but then again, all of Tom Hanks' movies are top notch. I just wished they would have shown Capt. Philips being re-united with his family and crew.",1397865600,,754,4.3546099290780145

6064179,4,B00G7M190U,"Tom Hanks is so good. Movie version is well-done. Ending dragged a bit, but it is what it is.

Maybe i just needed a deeper character connection? Still a pretty good movie and worth the time & money",1397779200,,273,4.372549019607843
6064187,3,B00G7M190U,It just didn't have the excitement and suspense that I expected. The acting was good but the dialogue and character development was poor. It's based on a true story but the screen writer missed the mark with this one.,1397779200,,217,4.589743589743589
6064188,4,B00G7M190U,I like when things are based on true life events because it gives you insights as to what happened.

6064194,5,B00G7M190U,Captain Phillips was a captain in every form. It does my heart good to know there are still some heroes out there that honorable. None of his crew got hurt.

6064196,3,B00G7M190U,Entertaining but veered off the real story.  Phillips chose to stay too close to the coast to make more $$$ and get the shipment to its destination quicker. And that has made him a hero? Ugh!,1397692800,,191,4.305555555555555

Switched from Sony BluRay player to Sony PS 3 and the streaming problem went away.  PS 3 has a hard drive and the BluRay player does not.
Is the Amazon Fire TV a good solution for this?",1397606400,,340,4.184615384615385
6064198,4,B00G7M190U,"Tom Hanks and all the cast members reached into themselves and came out with a truly great production. The only negative for me was the hokey way the script presented the final rescue. Not true to the facts and way, way,way too much Hollywood. I seriously doubt any professional commando operation would be so sloppy. This is not a training film that's for sure, but do not miss it. It is well worth your time as an entertaining story.",1397606400,,435,4.518987341772152

6064212,4,B00G7M190U,This movie is one of Tom Hanks better pictures in my opinion. He is not trying to be Arnold or Stallone. He gives the Captain a human aspect that is believable.,1397433600,,160,4.193548387096774

6064266,4,B00G7M190U,"The first story in Suetonius's ""Twelve Caesars"" is about how Julius Caesar dealt with his pirates. There's a lesson there.

Caesar was a young man when he was sent to Greece to learn rhetoric. On the voyage home his ship was captured by the Cilician Pirates. The Mediterranean was indeed a 'Roman Lake' since the end of the Punic Wars. No nation could oppose them but Rome couldn't or wouldn't  control the many pirates. Some years later Pompey got a commission to wipe the seas clean of pirates and he did so in only a year. But this was before Caesar was captured.

The pirates relied on the inability of the captured prisoners to remember the sea coast to their den. They brought the prisoners back to their camp and held them until they were ransomed. They had done this for years but no prisoner could describe just how to find their camp along the rugged seacoast. But Caesar wasn't an ordinary fellow with an ordinary mind and sense of purpose.

When he was ransomed he led a Roman fleet back along the route he had memorized and caught them all. He then had all fifty of them crucified.

That's still a good policy towards pirates.

Pirates are enemies of all people and should be wiped out wherever they are found. Real pirates are not like Johnny Depp - who is effeminate, wears a lot of eye makeup and is fun to watch. Real pirates are more like gangs of serial killers. Crucifixion requires close contact. It's not really needed. In modern times were have aircraft, with which we could drop chemical and/or biological weapons. We could scour the whole Somali sea coast for twenty miles inland. After a few bombing missions no Somali's would live near the water again. We have at other times and other places established 'No Fly Zones'. We should simply declare the whole coastline a 'No Float Zone'.

The first thing that bothered me about the movie was that it showed that we knew where Somali pirates lived an didn't bomb them. The next was the defense that the <I>Alabama Maersk</I> employed. In WWII the comparable cargo ship would have been a Liberty Ship. The modern container ship is a bit bigger and much faster and better equipped than the old fashion Liberty Ships. But there was one big difference. A typical Liberty Ship was armed with three 20 mm cannon, a three inch cannon, and a five incher. A modern container ship like the <I>Alabama Maersk</I>  would only need a single fifty caliber machine gun (Ma Deuce) to be safe fro these tiny pirate boats with teenagers armed with AK-47s. The Liberty Ships seldom got to use their armament. Many just broke in two spontaneously and others were torpedoed from below. But it would have been crazy for a Liberty Ship to sail in hostile waters unarmed.

Pirates had captured and killed crews from other ships just before this voyage. Yet these men went into hostile waters against armed pirates with only water hoses to protect them. Crazy.

I understand that the real Captain Phillips is not well liked by his own crew or many other crews he has worked with. I don't much care. I also understand that the real hero in this incident was another crew member not Phillips. Again I don't care. It cost the producers something like $50 million to get this story into theaters. They spent plenty to just get Hanks. You can hardly blame them for twisting the screen play a little to make it more commercial.

From what I read on Wikipedia the movie is mostly accurate to the real story. In any case the movie works very well as an entertainment.",1397001600,,3507,4.5952

To add, you will understand how uncertain Captain Phillips' fate truly was during those days.

The beginning might seem a little slow, but it really brings home the point that you have to enjoy the little moments because you have no idea what could happen.  The scenes in the lifeboat were so intense that I actually started to feel claustrophobic. Intense is probably the best word to describe the battle of wills between Phillips and Muse.

6064318,5,B00G7M190U,"Captain Philips is based on a true event which occurred in the year 2009. Richard Phillips, played by Tom Hanks, had to manage the Maersk Alabama, a ship with a crew of 20, loaded with 17,000 metric tons of cargo which was bound for Mombosa, Kenya departing about the end of March. After a week or two of traveling the Maersk is attacked by a Somolian pirate group of four all around the ages of 16-20. The pirates take Captain Phillips to one of the ships life boats and endeavor on bringing him to Somolia for ransom.

Pros:

  This movie is intense and nerve-wracking. At one scene, the Captain realizes the radar indicates two small boats so he alerts everyone in the ship to do their procedure. Just the tension of everyone preparing as time runs out is nail biting. The possible upcoming situation is chilling. Even when the pirates are attempting to attach a ladder to the ship, one of the crew members activates some hydraulic system of hoses that shoot out high-pressurized water, which are all around the boat for defense. The pirates end up on the boat of course. There is plenty more parts that leave one on the edge of their seat.

  The acting is phenomenal, and truly brings the characters too life. Tom Hanks does a fantastic job on emphasizing anxiety and stress in his face, so well done you would think he is really feeling this way. The Somolian leader Abduwali Muse, played by American Somolian actor Barkhad Abdi, was committed to make money even if it meant kidnapping, and had no thoughts on turning back. An example of his determination was when at one point Phillips asked him Isnt there anything else for you to do instead of kidnapping people? Muse replies Maybe in America, but not where I come from. Also while Captain Phillips had plans and ways of crippling the pirates, Muse was ahead of the game. The acting shows struggle, and anxiety amazingly and even makes one who watches this feel it as well. To make the viewer feel this is a great achievement.

  The camera angles tend to move frequently to go with the movements of the characters or stress of their voice. The shots were done right, and instead of ruining the experience it enhanced it, strangely giving a sense of realism. The movements of the cameras are almost hypnotic and give the viewer a perception of being in the actual situation.

  To sum up this short review, it is nearly inconceivable to discover any faults in this movie. It is well worth the time and effort of watching. The fact that this was a true event also increases this movies eminence. Captain Phillips earns a 10/10, a real masterpiece.

6064324,4,B00G7M190U,"For a while, the last few years anyway, pirates had a pretty good cinematic reputation as a result of Johnny Depps Pirates of the Caribbean series. You know one for all, all for one where even the bad guy pirates were merely misunderstood rather than monstrous barnacles on our homeland, the sea (nice, right). And the good guy pirates, if they would only settle down a little and maybe join a twelve- step program, would be accepted in many a respectable neighborhood as colorful figures sprucing up the leafy suburbs. Going back to childhood even bad guy pirates like Long John Silver in Treasure Island were just irascible figures who needed a couple of breaks. At worst the lot of them were just out to make a little dough doing the best they could by going where the money was on the high seas-the ships. But as the Somalian pirates (and ex-farmers and fishermen) in the high seas drama under review, Captain Phillips, make clear all bets are off as far as that previous characterization of this nasty breed goes- except the money part- they are certainly one with their earlier brethren in seeing booty (no, not that booty) as the sole reason to be in this dangerous occupation.

The story-line here, based on the real life incident involving Captain Phillips, is pretty straight forward, pretty much out of todays headlines. The Horn of Africa is a key world trade shipping lane which is moreover adjacent to Somalia (and other coastal African countries) where due to political, environmental, and man-made destruction the old ways of life, farming and fishing, have dried up and many young men in need of work find it on the high seas as pirates. That is where the money is. Not so much the question of taking cargoes as the ability to highjack a ship or passengers for ransom. And that is what happens here to the ship that Captain Phillips (played by Tom Hanks) is carefully navigating through the straits.

The difference here is, the difference that makes this a dramatic presentation, that Captain Phillips is bound to defend his ship in the old-fashion code of the sea as best he could. Through evasions, through negotiations, and eventually through force (after the pirates and captain wind up on a modern day lifeboat away from the ship) , through the force of the U.S. Navy as it turns out in this situation the pirates are thwarted in their desire to make money. Along the way we get the full range of emotions and ploys by the captain as he tries to save his ship and the captain pirate (played by Barkhad Abdi) with counter-ploys as he tries to control his increasing restricted environment as well. Yeah, those boys were not Johnnys pirates.",1396742400,,2662,4.710300429184549

6064341,5,B00G7M190U,"The last five minutes of this movie had a stunning impact on the theater audience.  You could hear a pin drop and no one moved for several minutes.  This was, for the most part, an edge of your seat picture.  This was a real set with real ships and ocean.  There was nothing fake.  The pirates were so scary and the crew really frightened.

What can be said about Tom Hanks?  He will always be too good in whatever he does but here he has done what seems impossible by portraying a person in extreme stress and making it so believable it can break your heart.

The first half of the movie takes place on the Maersk Alabama where Captain Phillips and the crew do what they can to protect the ship and themselves from the Somali pirates.  The last half of the movie is on the lifeboat where the Captain has been taken hostage and the story becomes a man in peril on the sea.  One must marvel at the resourses the US Govt. expended to rescue the Captain. There were three Navy ships and a huge number of Navy Seals.

Captain Phillips for his will to keep the pirates off his ship and then with making sure the ship would not function. Also risking his life trying to escape and knowing that death could come at any time. The crew because of their quick thinking a heroic deeds done to stop the ship and pirates at all costs. They remind me of our brave military personnel that will not give up regardless of the odds against them. The Navy goes without saying. The greatest and strongest Navy in the world wasn't about to let the crew or Captain Phillips down. I only wished that it would have been four kills and not three.

I loved the fact that the 2 groups had not even met before they boarded the boat to take it over. Hank's face showed some actual fear, like, is this part of the movie or are we really being boarded by pirates!

There are a couple of scenes early on that paint Muse in a light that makes him a victim of circumstances beyond his control (whether that is true or not is up for debate). The last scene where Tom Hanks is being evaluated by a Navy medical staff person is particularly poignant as well. 12 Years A Slave was probably the most important movie of the year, but this definitely gave it a run for its money as best movie of the year.",1396396800,,560,4.242990654205608

This is a very good flick, not the excellent one that would have merited four star status. The characters were cast very well and the acting was as expected with Hanks. The only thing that bugged me about the ""authentic accounting"" as claimed by the film makers is that the real Captain Phillips exclaimed that this depiction of actual events was a bit skewed from what actually ocurred.

Well, that is what this director did. He took a great screenplay, which other than the time frame, didn't vary much from the actual events, and left the viewer alone with poor Captain Phillips, who never should have gotten out of bed that day, and a unique group of desperate pirates. You get to know the pirates, some you actually feel empathy for...You will be on the edge of your seat the entire time. Tom Hanks, who, quite frankly, I'm a little over, was superb, down to his pretty authentic New England accent and the young men, plucked off the streets of Minnesota was it? (No acting experience!) were mesmerizing. There will be a few new stars in Hollywood after this film. I really liked it.",1396310400,,894,4.559006211180124

The next day I went out and bought and probably watch it at least 4 times a week.  I was totally taken by surprise when I learned that the 4 pirots were not actors.  Barkhad Abdi as ""Muse"" was excellent and  was up for ""the best supporting actor"" at the academy awards. Although he did not win there, he won other awards.

I think that is why I watch it so much, I study the acting of Barkhad Abdi.  He is unbelievable and Tom Hanks was right there supporting him when he won other awards.  Good for you young man.  A dream of a lifetime.

But my favorite scene was Tom Hanks at the end being attended to by the medical personnel.  His reaction to what he had just survived left me speechless.  You could totally feel is shock, anxiety, fear, exhaustion, gratitude and probably about 100 other emotions colliding as he tried to control them.  Outstanding job Tom!!",1395964800,,430,4.756756756756757

He thought he knew what he was talking about that morning. But by the end of his day, he will be miles outside his comfort zone. And so is the audience. This is a well paced moment to moment experience no one is prepared to handle. As I recall the movie carried the sub-title ""A Documentary."" It does document the unexpected which enters the unpredictable world of terror for both the pirates and their hostages. Tom Hanks is such a warm fellow dedicated to the details of piloting a cargo ship to safe port  in the Indian Ocean. He is taught the other dimension of his job: trading his life to save the lives of his crew. Big scary decisions he has to make. I wouldn't have done it. But then you never know until the shock of the unexpected forces you to show what you're made of.

I mean you have four vagrants in what amounts to a motorized rowboat taking over a huge cargo ship.  Really....???  A couple of men with M16s would have put a quick stop to that.,1395878400,,291,4.8
6064483,4,B00G7M190U,"I enjoyed the movie, mainly because I have always liked Tom Hanks. I watched it knowing that the movie was somewhat different from the actual course of events, and that the real Captain Phillips was despised by some of his crew, who are now suing him.",1395878400,,251,4.478260869565218
6064484,5,B00G7M190U,You cannot beat movies like this when they are based on real-life events.  Tom Hanks got screwed for not receiving BA nominnation. But then he wasn't going  to beat out Matthew McC playing an AIDS victim; the Hollywood crowd loves that cause.,1395878400,,242,4.738095238095238
6064485,4,B00G7M190U,An excellent portrayal following a recent event that offers a look into real world piracy of today on the open waters off East Africa's cost.  The acting by Tom Hanks and the lead role portrayed by a new discovery within Somali itself is refreshing.  The extreme ability of our elite Navy Seals is highlighted once again and something we Americans should be extremely proud of.  We need to offer every support possible to these warriors when they return home to private life!,1395878400,,475,4.7682926829268295
6064486,5,B00G7M190U,This movie is intense from beginning yo end very good movie. I love it and I would recommend to anybody to watch it.,1395878400,,116,4.086956521739131
6064487,5,B00G7M190U,Very good movie.  Lots of suspense. Didn't get bored at any point while watcHing.  It was nice to watch a movie where every other word was not a curse word.  Highly recommend.,1395878400,,175,4.40625

6064489,5,B00G7M190U,Let's start with Tom Hanks.  He plays a very good Captain Phillips.  The fact that it is a docudrama adds to the enjoyment.  Then the rest of the cast is very believable and the special effects were pretty good.,1395878400,,211,4.358974358974359
6064490,5,B00G7M190U,This is an incredible movie. It is a true story and keeps you on the edge of your seat for the whole movie. The acting is great and the story is better than any fiction book.,1395878400,,174,3.861111111111111
6064491,5,B00G7M190U,"This movie was under-rated by the academy.  No chase scenes, no CGI, just a plain old good story full of real human emotion.",1395878400,,124,4.391304347826087
6064492,4,B00G7M190U,Excellent dramatization of the real event. Really liked the last scene involving Captain Phillips in sick bay aboard rescue ship. Hanks' emotional reaction in the hands of the caregiver was first rate acting.,1395878400,,208,5.333333333333333
6064493,3,B00G7M190U,A growing actor and premier star 'hanks' carriers what this has to offer. That's all.  A decent movie for a decent price.,1395878400,,121,4.5
6064494,5,B00G7M190U,"Intense, exciting, kept me on the edge of my seat. Tom Hanks once again nailed his performance!  The pirates were perfect; desperate and ruthless. Great story, excellent acting.",1395792000,,177,5.321428571428571
6064495,5,B00G7M190U,Great movie.  Tom Hanks portrayed Captain Phillips well.  He is a versitile actor who deserves lots of credit for the success of this movie.,1395792000,,140,4.791666666666667
6064496,4,B00G7M190U,"As always with Tom Hanks the acting was faultless.  The story, being true, was a little slow at times but was definitely worth a couple of hours of time.",1395792000,,153,4.275862068965517
6064497,5,B00G7M190U,I was looking for a movie my husband would like and decided on this.  Great choice.  Tom Hands was incredible in it.,1395792000,,116,4.2272727272727275

6064499,5,B00G7M190U,Lots of suspense. Reels you in and doesn't let go until the final scene. Tom Hanks and Barkhad Abdi gave wonderful performances. Well worth the rental price.,1395792000,,157,4.851851851851852
6064500,4,B00G7M190U,Having worked on ships much of my career I could directly relate to the scenario. Some of our vessel working off the coast of Africa faced the threat of piracy and at lest one had met that fate. This was a very good movie and I'd recommend it to anyone.,1395792000,,253,4.08
6064501,5,B00G7M190U,"Well acted rendition of a true story. I recall when it happened. Nevertheless, that didn't spoil it for me. Lots of tense drama at high seas.",1395792000,,141,4.461538461538462
6064502,5,B00G7M190U,I'm obsessed with true stories and I loved it! Movie was very realistic and true to the storyline. I will watch it again!,1395792000,,121,4.304347826086956
6064503,5,B00G7M190U,How can a ship hijacking be so suspenseful?  There is something about this moving that keeps you at the edge of your seat.  Found it very enjoyable and satisfying (I also like movies based on true stories!).,1395705600,,207,4.5675675675675675
6064504,4,B00G7M190U,"I don't generally enjoy movies based on actual events, especially when the events are so frightening. But this was actually well-done. Tom Hanks gave a powerful performance, especially at the end of the movie (though I have mixed feelings about him lately). This may sound clichd, but the way the movie was filmed made me feel like I was actually on that ship; it provided a sense of immersion and realism.",1395705600,,406,4.732394366197183
6064505,4,B00G7M190U,"Love Tom Hanks, he did well in this movie.
Liked the historical connection, not sure where the poetic license took the show away from reality, but most was pretty believable.
The pirate protagonist character actually developed a little during the show which I found engaging, more human than just a poster board villian.  (There was one of those, too - guess it's required.)",1395705600,,374,4.936507936507937
6064506,5,B00G7M190U,I absolutely love this movie. It is well produced/filmed. Theirs enough action to keep you in suspense even though you know the end. The cast was amazing .played their roles well.,1395705600,,179,4.806451612903226
6064507,5,B00G7M190U,"We followed the news when this incident was unfolding and cheered when Capt. Phillips was rescued unharmed. This film was chilling in its portrayal not just of his plight, but the plight of the young Somali pirates. They were ruthless, it is true, but I saw in the characters a shadow of humanity and could easily understand how the Capt. began to feel a real empathy for them and their desperate situation, even as his own desperate situation was worsening. Amazing story of a man willing to put himself in danger to protect those under his command, and still have the presence of mind to think through his fear and misery and find a way to show compassion.",1395705600,,658,4.584745762711864
6064508,5,B00G7M190U,This was a great story with great talent!  It is amazing Captain Phillips is back on the seas after this experience!,1395705600,,116,4.523809523809524
6064509,4,B00G7M190U,Great Movie....but unfortunately!!! The download speed is super slow. The movie only plays for 15 minutes at a time and then stops to load.,1395705600,,139,4.833333333333333
6064510,4,B00G7M190U,Captain Phillips keeps you engage throughout the whole movie. Thought that this was another good performance by Tom Hanks. Not much in any other support actors though.,1395705600,,167,5.222222222222222
6064511,5,B00G7M190U,GO NAVY SEALS! My tax dollars at work! Movie is an excellent rendition of a true story. Tom Hanks (super class guy) really played the part of Capt Phillipes (Forest Gump and Saving PVT Ryan too!),1395705600,,195,4.444444444444445
6064512,5,B00G7M190U,"We thought Tom Hanks was great! Why he wasn't nominated for an Oscar is beyond us.
The movie moved at a good pace.",1395705600,,114,4.0
6064513,4,B00G7M190U,"It is one of Tom Hanks undeniablely  strong performances showing that Hollywood royalty and newcomers coming together can produce an end product worth writing about. Hanks proves once again that he can bring a sense of that trademark laugh and ability and still convince us he is only ""the character"".  He gives a depth to any character that would be any writer/ directors dream. And with the new comer stealing scenes at times it was a perfect blend of seasoned confidence and fresh faced ideas that sold this true tale until the end. And don't miss the last 15 minutes of the film. Tom Hanks digs deep to express the feeling of us all in those last scenes. Though it is acting, I was 100% invested in those moments... to really experience the release of horror and pain Captain Phillips must have felt.  A must see!",1395705600,3,817,4.582191780821918
6064514,5,B00G7M190U,"This movie is intense in all the good ways.  Every single one of the actors were awesome!  Tom Hanks Rocks!
 What a very insightful story!",1395705600,,138,4.44
6064515,5,B00G7M190U,"Still can't get over Capt. Phillips going back to sea but then again he must have had his reasons. I was taken aback at his compassion for the pirates as Tom Hanks could only portray.
The story was simple and we all knew the ending -at least for the Capt. but were mesmerized with the telling.",1395705600,,293,4.25
6064516,5,B00G7M190U,Excellent movie; should have gotten more academy awards!! Keeps your attention from the very start....highly recommend (also doesn't have alot of profanity)...,1395705600,,159,6.2727272727272725
6064517,5,B00G7M190U,Very good movie about one of our local Vermonters. Intense and fairly fast paced. Would recommend to anyone interested in the events of piracy ongoing in the Somali area.,1395705600,,170,4.896551724137931
6064518,4,B00G7M190U,"Almost everyone knows the story of Captain Richard Phillips. Well, they think they do. Tom Hanks portrayal of the Captain in this picture is riveting. The same is true of the actors who are cast as the Somali pirates who abduct the good Captain. But knowing how ""justice"" is meted out in the end only adds to a feeling of disquiet as the story unfolds. This isn't a film that you can just watch and forget. By the end your mind will turn to the unanswered questions: why more wasn't done by the ships owners to protect their crew? Are the violent, stupid, greedy pirates so beyond the pale that a little bit more could not have been done to save Phillips without taking their lives? Maybe not, but after all is said and done, they were mice to our cat.",1395705600,5,752,4.340425531914893

6064520,4,B00G7M190U,"I think a story based on true events is much more drama and the audience can identify with the characters in a much more satisfying way. Even though Hollywood must adhere to PC, it is obvious Captain Phillips was a Christian man.",1395705600,,229,4.476190476190476
6064521,5,B00G7M190U,Tom Hanks is the Man! I don't know how far off the movie is from actually events but it's a tear jerker.,1395705600,,104,3.772727272727273

6064525,5,B00G7M190U,"Don't go for many movies such as this but this one is a little different than most. It is based on a true story and is cast so well, directed and written to match and just keeps you in side the story through out.

6064527,5,B00G7M190U,"Great movie. Very intense throughout. The last five minutes are amazing. The action is over by then, but Tom Hanks makes it the most intense and emotional part of the entire movie by displaying the psychological trauma that such an event would cause. He should have gotten a Best Actor nomination on the strength of those last five minutes alone!",1395705600,,346,4.783333333333333

6064565,5,B00G7M190U,"Gosh, what an exciting movie...it was so riveting I could hardly move.  I guess knowing it was based on real conditions it made it all the more exciting.  And, with Tom Hanks as the main character...I enjoyed it more...love him in all his movies.",1395705600,,246,4.568181818181818
6064566,5,B00G7M190U,Excellent movie.  It has you in edge from beginning to end. I don't give five stars often to a film unless I really loved it. This is a well worth time and money spent.  It made me appreciate our military even more than I do already and I didn't think it was possible! :).,1395705600,,272,4.018518518518518
6064567,4,B00G7M190U,"The story was well told and the suspense was great. The Somali actors stole the show for sure! Everyone liked it, which is a miracle in our house.",1395705600,,146,4.25
6064568,5,B00G7M190U,This movie was amazing. I can't believe Hanks didn't win an award for this. The other guy was so believable,1395705600,,107,4.4
6064569,5,B00G7M190U,"Well done and keeps you at the edge of your seat throughout.  As usual, Tom Hanks does a fantastic job playing a real life hero.",1395619200,,128,4.12
6064570,1,B00G7M190U,"Read the fine print before you rent from Amazon, while they say you have 30 days to watch the rental, there is a catch, you actually have 24 hours to watch the rental from the time you first watched it.  I will never rent from Amazon again, deceptive advertising and 24 hours is too short.",1395619200,4,289,4.254545454545455
6064571,5,B00G7M190U,What do you do when your instincts come to actual events?  This was so close to the reality of the actual situation.  Tom Hanks is wonderful as usual.  Leaves you with some hope for the courage of men.,1395619200,,201,4.2368421052631575
6064572,5,B00G7M190U,"My entire family was riveted by this. While it might be iffy for younger kids, I was comfortable watching this with my 11 year old. Great movie!!",1395619200,,145,4.407407407407407
6064573,5,B00G7M190U,"The portrayal of the characters -- good, bad and peripheral --- is what sets this movie apart from what could have easily turned into a TV movie. Thrilling to see Tom Hanks continue to grow as a mature actor.  Clearly he has many, many more stellar performances ahead of him.",1395619200,,275,4.5
6064574,5,B00G7M190U,The movie was well done and kept me on the edge of my seat even knowing the outcome of the true story.  I highly recommend this movie!  Accurate portrayal of actual events.,1395619200,,172,4.34375

6064578,5,B00G7M190U,Thought it was very well done.  Kept your interest throughtout movie.  Very exciting movie.  Learned a little about cargo ships.,1395619200,,128,5.3
6064579,2,B00G7M190U,An alright movie that grew highly boring and probably one of Tom Hanks's most boring performance. worth a rental and that's about it.,1395619200,,133,4.826086956521739
6064580,4,B00G7M190U,"It's getting so that if Tom Hanks is in it, that means it's good.  I don't know if that's because Tom Hanks is such a great actor (and I think he is a great actor btw) or because he has a good eye for great scripts and stories.  This one didn't appeal to me enough to see it at the theater, but after seeing it via Amazon, I can say I would have been satisfied paying full price at a movie theater.  The acting is just great by all of the cast.  The story is better than I had heard from the news.",1395532800,,497,3.796116504854369
6064581,4,B00G7M190U,We were surprised by how engaging the movie was despite our knowing the outcome of the story.  Very good script which by most accounts was generally accurate.,1395532800,,158,4.851851851851852
6064582,3,B00G7M190U,"I found this movie to be a bit boring, possibly because I knew the outcome.  My daughter liked it however.",1395532800,,106,4.3
6064583,4,B00G7M190U,Tom Hanks does anouther great job in this movie.  If you like drama you will definatly enjoy this movie.  Plan on sitting on the edge of your seat.,1395532800,,147,4.214285714285714
6064584,5,B00G7M190U,Thrilling even though we knew the outcome.  Tom Hanks should have received an award for his performance.  We recommend this movie.,1395532800,,130,5.142857142857143
6064585,4,B00G7M190U,Based on reviews I did purchase this and gave it to my daughter.  I have not had an opportunity to see it.,1395532800,,106,3.8181818181818183
6064586,4,B00G7M190U,Fascinating true story that kept you on the edge of your seat.  One of the better academy award nominee movies that I've watched.,1395532800,,129,4.608695652173913
6064587,5,B00G7M190U,"On the edge of my seat throughout the film. Tom Hanks was excellent as the captain. Most touching ending after the captain is rescued. The Navy seals - what can you say? They came, they did the job, they left. Incredible.",1395532800,,221,4.414634146341464
6064588,5,B00G7M190U,"Although I knew how the story would turn out, the movie was successful in maintaining an air of tension. Captain Phillips emerged as a genuine hero. The film did not excuse the pirates for their criminal activity, but seeing their desperate background did enable me to develop some degree of sympathy for them.  I think the pirate leader was sincere when he said he loved America and saw it as a land of opportunity. I would hope that two things might happen as a result of this film: 1) That ships traveling in that area will have better security and preparedness, and 2) The US and other countries will increase aid to Somalia so the people will not have to turn to piracy to survive.",1395446400,,686,4.488
6064589,5,B00G7M190U,"Might seem slow at first, but the end is totally worth it.  Great movie!  Tom Hanks should have won award for the final scene.",1395446400,,126,4.208333333333333
6064590,4,B00G7M190U,"Tom Hanks does a good job, as always.  Very much worth renting and I would recommend it.  Not on par with Saving Private Ryan, which was one of Tom Hanks best performances but a good movie.",1395446400,,189,4.222222222222222
6064591,5,B00G7M190U,"Except for Joe versus the Volcano, Tom Hanks should just receive an Oscar for every movie that he does. As an actor he puts believability into the character whether it be real or fictional. Not really an action movie, but worth watching once a year.",1395446400,,249,4.555555555555555
6064592,5,B00G7M190U,"We recently rented this movie through Amazon Prime streaming and thoroughly enjoyed it.  The movie was better than we had expected with lots of drama, twists and turns.  The fact that it was based on a true story made it even more intriguing.",1395446400,,242,4.604651162790698
6064593,1,B00G7M190U,"I love Tom Hanks, and I admire Captain Phillips, but if you read the headlines from an RSS feed when this occurred then you know every detail of the movie already. This isn't something that should have been made into a movie.",1395446400,,225,4.380952380952381
6064594,4,B00G7M190U,Very compelling great acting.  The sequence of pulling the life craft back to the ship could have conveyed the same tension in a shorter amount of time but overall we liked the movie,1395446400,,182,4.515151515151516
6064595,4,B00G7M190U,Excellent movie Tom Hanks Always Gives It His best. The Movie was very clear and it arrives in time.amazon Always complies with their word.i recommend this one. I't s a must for blu-ray movie lovers..,1395446400,2,200,4.742857142857143
6064596,5,B00G7M190U,This was a great movie. It was reviting and emotional. Couldn't quit watching it. It is exactly what someone who enjoys an action packed movie would enjoy.,1395446400,,155,4.777777777777778
6064597,5,B00G7M190U,"great performances all around (after all, this is tom hanks! what did you expect) this is really a rather scary movie,all the more so because it's real. this is not one i would let children watch",1395446400,,195,4.444444444444445
6064598,5,B00G7M190U,Very intense....awesomely entertaining. Tom Hanks is not just a comedic actor. His Captain Phillips was very believable and inspiring. Recommended!,1395446400,,147,6.4
6064599,5,B00G7M190U,I have never seen a movie made by starred in by Tom that was less than great-amst see! Good show!,1395446400,,97,3.9
6064600,5,B00G7M190U,"I thoroughly enjoyed Captain Phillips. Tom Hanks, I thought, should have won an academy award for his performance.  All the other actors were superb too.

This movie, overall, should have received Oscars in so many areas. I don't remember when I enjoyed a move as well as this one.",1395446400,,281,4.714285714285714
6064601,4,B00G7M190U,We enjoyed this movie and especially Tom Hanks acting.  It is a better than average movie.  I can recommend it to others.,1395446400,,121,4.454545454545454
6064602,4,B00G7M190U,Much realism.  Well produced and acted.  Tom Hanks did a great portrayal of the real Captain Phillips.  A great history lesson on how the Somalians pirate the oceans with few men and rudimentary small boats to capture a large ship.,1395446400,,231,4.725

6064605,5,B00G7M190U,It is hard to make an intense thriller based on actual event with a known outcome.  This film succeeded on every level which placed the viewer on edge of seat for almost the entire duration of the film.  Credits must be given to the script writer and the director Paul Greengrass with a great cast of unknowns headed by a superb Tom Hanks.  Could be too conventional subject to be recognized by the Oscar Academy.  One of the best action dramas in recent years.,1395360000,,461,4.4523809523809526
6064606,5,B00G7M190U,I really enjoyed this movie - although you know it's an embellishment of the true story - it was interesting to understand the pirate world and the danger involved.  The cast was great... kept me on the edge of my seat!,1395360000,,219,4.341463414634147

6064608,3,B00G7M190U,All the scrambling of the Navy Seals then parashoot them Where Into the Ocean? Hanks did as much with the part as could be done but there was just too much repetition of running scared and not being able to protect themselves. Very far fetched and boring!!!!,1395360000,,258,4.51063829787234
6064609,3,B00G7M190U,Nothing really special. There is a controversy saying that the captain didn't follow guidelines to stay 600 miles off the Somalian shore.,1395360000,,137,5.2727272727272725

6064612,5,B00G7M190U,Loved the movie. Love Tom Hanks. Intense story line kept us involved the whole time. Would recommend to an adult audience.,1395360000,,122,4.857142857142857

6064614,5,B00G7M190U,"This was a great movie.  Tom Hanks was awesome in it.  He should have gotten more credit for his role in this film.  Great actor.  The whole movie was intense, loved the story.  Would highly recommend this film.",1395360000,2,211,4.447368421052632
6064615,4,B00G7M190U,"I loved the movie. Good action. The only thing that i did not like, and this has little to do with the movie, is that as in real life, it took way to long for our military to respond, and then subsequently neutralize the pirates.",1395360000,,229,4.111111111111111

6064618,5,B00G7M190U,Hear a lot about this movie and wish I would have seen it before. Hanks was wonderful as usual. Highly recommended film to see. (Spoiler alert) The emotion he delivered once safe and in hospital was stunning. The wife was tearing up.,1395360000,,233,4.571428571428571
6064619,5,B00G7M190U,will played out really brings the world of these freak pirates to life. To bad in real life ships can not defend themselves from these pirates,1395360000,,142,4.5
6064620,5,B00G7M190U,"This is an important film and shows the concerns of those on both sides of this issue.  It is well acted and is action
packed.  I wish they had not used so much music to try to carry the suspense, it became annoying after a while.
Hopefully, people will ignore that and get the real message of the movie.",1395360000,,304,4.135593220338983

6064622,5,B00G7M190U,I choose this rating because it is a true account of the event. It is part of the United States history. A very well made film. The excitment never stopped from beginning to end. The cast was very believiable. I don't know the pirate captain but he played his part very very well. Tom Hanks is always the best in whatever he does. I would recommend this film to almost everyone. It should win and OSCAR!!,1395273600,,404,4.328947368421052
6064623,4,B00G7M190U,"I was unsure about this movie,  after renting it I come to find that it was a pretty good movie.  I plan to own this movie soon.  I would recommend this movie to everyone interested or is unsure.",1395273600,2,195,4.078947368421052
6064624,5,B00G7M190U,I never expected to cry during this movie but the last five or so minutes I just lost it! It was well worth the rent I paid for it. I'll end up buying it eventually. So So So Good!!! :),1395273600,,185,3.65
6064625,5,B00G7M190U,"Tom Hanks amazes me.  He takes varied roles and characters and always manages to pull us into the role with him.  He makes us believe he really is Captain Phillips.  We really believe his life is in danger.  We believe that HE is truly the hero, and not just a character he is playing.  Will his next role do the same?  I have no doubt that, indeed, yes he will!",1395273600,,362,4.1

6064628,4,B00G7M190U,"I really like true, or semi true stories --- the truer the better :). This tale is very good, exposes you to the Somalian pirate issue, and I have to say manages to do so with some understanding for why they engage in this activity (doesn't make it right, but it was good to see a tiny bit of what motivates them). Tom Hanks is always good and doesn't disappoint. Supporting cast seemed real to life. Good movie.",1395273600,,412,4.294871794871795

6064636,5,B00G7M190U,"Tom Hanks does his usual superb job in the portrayal of Captain Phillips , who is a traditionally oriented person who is very solid in his experience as a ship's captain but makes no claim to being a heroic figure in a crisis situation. Instead he responds to this pirate situation in a well-reasoned and logical fashion using all the resources he had available to him while keeping the well-being of his crew upper-most in his mind while out-thinking the pirates'  leader. Captain Phillip's reaction to the final traumatic events when the U.S. Navy became involved showed a very natural emotional response to the trauma he was exposed to , and all this was so well done in the portrayal of Captain Phillips by Tom Hanks .This movie also could not help but raise the question in the movie-goers mind - why the heck don't these ships have some sort of armed protection when they are in these known pirate-infested waters ???",1395273600,,923,4.697530864197531
6064637,4,B00G7M190U,I'm actually impressed with the level of acting and drama in this movie. Tom Hanks and all the supporting actors in the movie kept it as real of an event as possible. Kudos to the director and all those involved :),1395273600,,214,4.2439024390243905

6064640,4,B00G7M190U,"Very good movie depicting actual events in the life of Captain Phillips.  Very good performance by Hanks and the highjackers in the movie.

6064644,5,B00G7M190U,This movie was extremely captivating and kept me on the edge of my seat. Knowing that the movie was based on a true story made it all the more intense. Tom Hanks was absolutely awesome and inspiring.

6064645,4,B00G7M190U,To know this really happened makes this movie frightening. It got alittle long in the end but I guess the whole situation was drawn out!

6064651,4,B00G7M190U,"Note: May contain spoilers. Proceed with caution.

Whenever I watch a film like Captain Phillips, my immediate reaction is always, That actually happened?!? When dealing with the world of fiction, the audience can easily accept any scenario without question because, in the back of their mind, everyone knows the events are not real. When dealing with non-fiction, however, this mindset changes drastically. Now we are watching a story based on a living, breathing human being and, depending on the narrative, this realization could be unsettling, which is the perfect word to describe Captain Phillips: unsettling. The film is raw and unforgiving in its execution, and the ending is as beautiful as it is emotional.

Richard Phillips (Tom Hanks) is a ship captain who is in charge of the MV Maersk Alabama, a cargo ship loaded with food and supplies. His destination is the poverty-stricken city of Mombasa, which he and his crew will reach by traveling through the Horn of Africa. Unfortunately, this part of the sea is littered with pirates, mainly from Somalia, so the risk is high for everyone on board. The fear of being taken over by pirates soon becomes a reality as Phillips and crew fight off approaching pirate boats. However, because the ship is unarmed, one of the boats manages to commandeer the ship, and Phillips must fight for his life and the safety of his crew.

Surprisingly, the narrative in Captain Phillips is extremely dense, which is why the film wastes no time throwing the viewer into the action. Within moments of meeting Phillips, the captain finds himself on the ship, meeting the crew, and setting sail. I wasn't expecting things to move at such a rapid pace, but the further I got into the movie, the more it became apparent as to why the film starts the way it does. Although it may not have been advertised as such, this is a complex story that relies on heavy emotion almost as much as it does on high intensity, so in order to receive the appropriate reaction, they needed as much detail as possible in all the right places.

For the most part, the film succeeds in accomplishing this task, which is shocking given the fact the story follows Phillips, his crew, and the Somalians. With the exception of the crew, the audience builds up a certain emotional connection with Phillips through the events that transpire, and the same can be said about the Somalians, to a certain extent. These pirates aren't acting out for personal gain per se; they are acting out because their country is struggling. As the film progresses, Phillips begins to truly understand this, and he tries to use this to his advantage through persuasion. Although I personally would have liked to see more from the crew, I understand why they were excluded due to the films current running time.

Another minor complaint of mine comes through the use, or lack thereof, of forced subtitles. After doing some light research, Im under the impression that the forced subtitles were present in the theatrical release, but this is never made clear to those who watch the film on DVD/Blu-Ray. Apparently there are subtitles for the Somali language, but they have to be activated in the Settings menu. As a result, my family went through the entire movie ignorant as to what the Somalian pirates were saying, and it became a bit taxing because they make up a good 50% of the dialogue. I will say, though, that it allowed me to better sympathize with Phillips because he too had no idea what was going on. Their language is foreign and incomprehensible, and this only makes the situation all the more frightening. So it was kind of a win/lose situation, but it is something everyone should be made aware of.

My biggest complaint, however, is in regards to the obnoxious shaky cam that is arguably Captain Phillips' biggest downfall. Paul Greengrass' work on the Bourne films suffered from the same issue, but those were at least a little understandable due to the constant action. The shaky cam in Captain Phillips, on the other hand, is just the result of bad camera work. There are never any demanding fight sequences, there aren't any crazy firefights, and there is no real reason why this should even be a problem. Majority of the film consists of Phillips and company having conversations, walking across the ship, or sitting down. Thats it. I just about lost it when the shot switched to a silent, still Abduwali Muse (Barkhad Abdi), and the camera was swaying all over the place.

Although the shaky cam did manage to take me out of the experience on occasion, the performances always managed to pull me right back in. Considering this was his first film, Barkhad Abdi was a blast to watch on screen. His heavy accent made Abduwali all the more menacing, and his facial expressions displayed someone who was truly conflicted with the severity of the situation. Another surprise standout was Michael Chernus, who plays first officer Shane Murphy. He was always an attention grabber in the scenes he was in, and I would have liked to see more of him. The real accomplishment, though, came from Tom Hanks, who seems to outdo himself time and time again. His performance left me speechless as I fought back tears during the films final moments, and this will probably go down as one of his best performances.

Overall Score: 8.8/10 - Is Captain Phillips perfect? No, but there is no denying the films excellence. The film manages to immerse its audience with ease, and the performances across the board were fantastic. Unfortunately, the storys density made it impossible for the writers to include all the details that would have truly left me satisfied, like the impact these events had on the crew, and the films shaky cam never ceased to be a huge annoyance. Taking that into consideration, Captain Phillips succeeds more than it fails, and thats all that matters. Those looking for a balls-to-the-wall action flick should look elsewhere, but if you want something that will truly stick with you, look no further.",1395187200,,6019,4.8312318137730355

It is so refreshing to see Hollywood produce films that appeal to adults in the best sense of the word, films that will endure.  Captain Phillips is a worthy successor to The Soloist, Extraordinary Measures, Argo, Zero Dark Thirty, The King's Speech, Keira Knightly's Pride & Prejudice, Lincoln, Saving Mr. Banks, and Silver Linings Playbook.

With no down time the film pretty much starts out with a quick set up, then for the next 2 hours we are brought along on this intense thrill ride. Hanks at the title character is in top form here and is one of his best performance. While I was aware of the true life event this film portrays, I'm not one to watch the news and don't follow such things, so I had no idea how this was going to turn out.

The real issue I have with ""Captain Phillips"" as well as ALL Amazon streaming videos is that you can't stream them to an Android tablet except for a Kindle unless you graduated with a degree in computer science.  Apparently there's a feud going on between Amazon, Google and Adobe that means that there's no Flash player available for the ENTIRE SERIES OF GALAXY TABLETS. What's odd is that there's an Amazon video player app for the iPad. I'm not saying it's impossible to do but inexplicably, Amazon who is ordinarily well-known for superior customer relations has put the entire burden on the customer to resolve. It's like we've been caught in corporate crossfire. It just doesn't seem right and fair, given that Amazon has the power to fix this.

You can, in certain circumstances stream Amazon video, but it involves, installing something called a ""Dolphin Browser"", the ""Dolphin Powerpack"", an old version of Adobe's Flash player and then tinkering with some settings. Does that sound like something the Amazon we know would make us do?",1394755200,,1168,4.85929648241206

Well, I couldn't have been more surprised and absolutely shocked at the entire production.
Tom Hanks as always was so amazing... I forgot I  was watching the same man I had seen in tons of movies 5 minutes in.  I knew the outcome and was still on the edge of my seat, my stomach so tense I felt like I was learning about this for the first time..

6064783,5,B00G7M190U,"A very enjoyable and well made film that I highly recommend. I didn't know of the events before watching the film, that added to my enjoyment.

I got the feeling that Tom Hanks was playing Tom Hanks rather than Captain Phillips, in much the same way that he did in Cast Away, but I'm not concerned about that and I may be wrong anyway. Barkhad Abdi both looked the part and played the part very well.

Paul Greengrass' style is not to everyone's tastes but I liked the way that tension was built and then converted into action. I heard Messrs Hanks and Greengrass interviewed about the stresses deliberately created when shooting the scene of the pirates breaking into the bridge; I was looking forward to seeing that scene and I wasn't disappointed. That for me was a great example of the effectiveness of Greengrass' style. The mind games in the lifeboat were well shot too.

I had a strong feeling of inevitability (in a good way that added to the tension) at many stages in this film and not knowing the story accentuated that. Knowing that this was based on actual events prevented me from considering the movie to be all 'a bit too Hollywood'.

Inevitability and loss of control were keenest for me at a number of stages: The captain had no effective means to deny boarding; the double cross to get the captain into the lifeboat; the deployment of the SEALs; the deterioration of the 'negotiations' as the pirate leader lost control through lack of ability.

It was good to see some balance in the storytelling. This was not just 'Team America, World Police'. I might have preferred a little more time devoted to the background of the Somalis' situation but perhaps that would have painted them too much as victims. In the end, everybody lied at some stage.

I liked the line ""We all have bosses.;.."" and its context; also, the captain's reply to the leader's statement about the how his previous hijacking led to a payment of $6million.

The final 10 or 15 minutes were compelling and the final 3 or 4 minutes simply brilliant, I challenge anyone to remain unemotional as they are played out.

An interesting homily about one's chances of successfully negotiating with Special Forces whilst holding hostages - but then one shouldn't hijack and abduct in the first place.",1394668800,,2277,4.703517587939698

6064790,4,B00G7M190U,Fast paced and  great acting by Hanks.  A good depiction of a real life situation. I would recommend watching it.,1394668800,,113,4.6
6064791,4,B00G7M190U,"Tom Hanks proves, again, that he is a great actor. I gave it 4 stars only because I wouldn't want to watch it over and over and over again. Still, I really enjoyed the movie. Very thrilling.",1394582400,,190,4.162162162162162
6064792,3,B00G7M190U,"Tom Hanks has been a favorite for me for years, but this movie just isn't up to par with most of his other films.  I don't hate the movie.  It's worse than that.  It bored me.  So you have gotten great reviews and now you've gotten a poor, sad review from me, so who do you trust?  As least ask your trusted friends who have similar movie tastes to you.  By the time you take the family out, buy the popcorn and the drinks, drive to the theater, you have a lot of driving, parking, buying, so who wants to be waiting for something exciting and it doesn't happen.  Real purty scenery though!",1394582400,,590,4.168141592920354
6064793,4,B00G7M190U,I am a fan of Tom Hanks  The film is far to sympathic to the Somali Criminal Pirates.  Tom Hanks has had better parts in better pictures.,1394582400,,137,4.037037037037037
6064794,1,B00G7M190U,Downloaded but no picture. First time I've ordered a prime movie but can't watch it! Got charged for it right away though.,1394582400,,122,4.590909090909091
6064795,5,B00G7M190U,I saw this  while I was in North Carolina last October.  Probably the best movie I have seen in a long time. Tom Hanks was the perfect actor to play Captain Phillips. I could feel the pain and fear. My heart was breaking for him.  I can't wait to see it again.,1394582400,,260,3.9615384615384617
6064796,4,B00G7M190U,To have these large ships sailing the high seas with no protection is nuts. Might be good to know how much the US had to spend to rescue the Captain and his grew vs. the simple procedure of having some contract guards aboard with M-60's and a rocket launcher's would have stopped the whole thing cold! A few of these and the pirates would look for other work. And to read this guy his rights and then an American trial is also nuts to my way of thinking. I am sure someone will find a way to get him paroled before he serves his time at additional tax payer expense. Film was well done but the whole PC and ROI concept is just maddening!!,1394582400,,638,4.153225806451613
6064797,5,B00G7M190U,Keeps you interested the entire movie! Tom Hanks is amazing as usual. It cool to see how the Seals pulled off the rescue.,1394582400,,121,4.304347826086956
6064798,5,B00G7M190U,"Played close to the vest of the real story, this is a riveting tale of pirates on the high seas of Somalia. Yes, those zany, fun-loving, hostage-taking Somalia pirates are at it again!  This time, the fellas manage to capture Tom Hanks! Woo Hoo!  Turns out they weren't looking for a ransom, they only wanted to ask him why he used the F-word on Good Morning America. He tries to signal to the Navy Seals that everything is A O K but they mistake his hand signals and shoot the pirates dead!

and now for something more placid.......

Historical Political Note:  The movie was based on the 2009 true event. Had CLINTON finished the 1993 rather than chicken poop out, OBAMA would never have had to order a hit on these fun-loving lads who fancy themselves modern-day Capt. Jack Sparrows.",1394582400,,786,4.585714285714285
6064799,5,B00G7M190U,This was a well done movie that will definitely keep your interest.  Hanks usually comes across in his movies as a strong actor and this is no exception.

6064807,4,B00G7M190U,"""Captain Phillips"" started as many conversations as it silenced, which is saying something in an opinionated household of six. The semi-documentary style of the film prompted a running stream of questions-- ""did this really happen?""-- which might be irritating to someone who prefers a detached movie-watching experience. At the same time, the pace of the film kept drawing our family back to the screen. Knowing the ending did nothing to lessen the suspense. The extra dollar for HD was well-spent.",1394582400,,499,5.25

To me the most important part of the movie was the shooting of the bandits by the US Navy sharp shooters but the director did not do good job in dramatizing it, It appeared to coming from nowhere and suddenly the windows were cracked and everything was over. Overall it is an average movie.",1394582400,,379,4.428571428571429

6064817,5,B00G7M190U,This was a heart-stopping movie with a terrifying scenario.  There wasn't a moment from the time the pirates were approaching the ship until the end of the movie that wasn't  heart-pounding or frightening.  It was wonderfully acted and I think it was a great movie.,1394582400,,265,4.844444444444444

Tom Hanks, wow! Academy screwed this one up. He should have gotten best actor! This dude went through pure hell! Those pirates gave one hell of a performance to say they didn't have much experience! How Abdi didn't get paid more for this movie is beyond me.

This was an A class rescue by the BEST navy in the world.

Fyi, this might anger some people, but I don't care. I believe in American exceptionalism and simply put, if you're not from the U.S., you're from a second rate country and you know it. Sorry, just the way it is. USA baby!",1394496000,,712,4.345864661654136

(Who on this planet has not gotten a chance to see the real Capt Phillips interviewed somewhere by someone?) With so much publicity, it could have been quite risky to try to portray this, but Tom Hanks is the perfect actor to step into this role. He comes across as a truly humble hero - just doing the right thing. The pirates are given sympathetic roles as well, which may more honestly reflect the complexity of the issues surrounding modern day piracy. Well worth the time!",1394409600,,582,4.5

6064868,5,B00G7M190U,"Barkhad Abdi should have had won an Oscar.  Also, if the reports are true about his compensation, he should receive more!  He was key to the success to this move.",1394409600,,162,4.366666666666666
6064869,4,B00G7M190U,The movie focused more on the interplay between the captain and the pirates rather than focusing on how the US military saved the day.,1394409600,,134,4.625

6064872,5,B00G7M190U,Great movie. Very intense. Makes you feel that is a reality movie. The emotion from Tom Hanks at the end is unbelievably well interpreted.,1394409600,,138,4.791666666666667

6064874,5,B00G7M190U,"Great movie! Incredibly entertaining and very well done. Tom Hanks deserved an Oscar nomination for his portrayal of Captain Phillips! Aside from that, the movie is excellent on every level. Although we knew the outcome, it was still exciting and kept us on the edge of our seats. Hanks lets you know from the moment he walks on his ship, that his gut suspects something...it's not overt...you just see the man checking and rechecking to ensure that all is ship shape (couldn't resist the pun) and protect his crew. An interesting study of leadership!

I'd watch it again! So nice to be entertained by a good story, good acting, good photography, and an overall GREAT product. Highly recommend this movie!",1394409600,,705,4.875
6064875,4,B00G7M190U,Tom Hanks does an admirable job playing the captain.  They seemed to have caught the fear and reprisal of a pirate situation.  It also showed how methodic the Navy was in its processes to liberate him.,1394409600,,201,4.555555555555555
6064876,5,B00G7M190U,"I was impressed with this movie. They did a nice job of character development, both from Captain Phillips' side and the Maersk Alabama crew, but also insight into why the Somalis felt driven into piracy. While there are naturally some violent parts, these are not overdone, so the movie is mostly more suspenseful, telling the story without trying to shock you.
It's clear the US Navy helped in the filming, with the later scenes involving their work with the SEALS and I think the movie portrays them in a positive light.",1394409600,,522,4.747252747252747

6064879,4,B00G7M190U,This film makes you wonder who should protect our citizens who make their living on cargo ships.  It glamorizes the pirates a bit though.,1394409600,,137,4.708333333333333
6064880,5,B00G7M190U,Being ex-Navy I thought that this movie was great.  Brought back great memories for me from seeing cargo ships at sea etc.  Knowing that this was based on a real event made me even more excited to see it.  Tom Hanks is an amazing actor.  SEALS rock!!,1394409600,,250,4.25531914893617
6064881,5,B00G7M190U,"Not often have we seen a news story developed into a good movie....and we figured this one would highlight the Navy Seals for what they did...the story line was 2/3  about Captain Phillips, his crew and interaction with pirates.....1/3 about Seals. Great development of storyline and great acting....after viewing you can see why it received Academy award nominations.",1394409600,,368,5.344827586206897

6064885,4,B00G7M190U,"Excellent acting and interesting story.  It does not go into why the Somalians are doing this but doing some news research will get you that.  I thought it was well presented.  Wish the Somali actors were paid more than 65,000 for the role since they were playing the lead roles too.",1394409600,,283,4.509803921568627
6064886,4,B00G7M190U,Kept your interest from the beginning to end with the characters developing throughout. Interesting how such a large ship can be taken over by only four violent people . I'm sure protection has increased  since.,1394409600,,211,5.0285714285714285
6064887,4,B00G7M190U,Tom Hanks is a great actor.  A unique movie style looking at the incident through the eyes of the main characters with more of a real edge.  A gripping story.,1394409600,,158,4.233333333333333
6064888,4,B00G7M190U,I was on the edge of my seat the whole time. My only complaint is that it was about 20min too long. I'd still see it again for the acting and interesting story.,1394409600,,160,3.878787878787879
6064889,5,B00G7M190U,"""Captain Phillips"" was nominated for Academy Award Best Picture - well deserved. Barkhad Abdi, who played Somali pirate Muse was nominated for Best Supporting Actor - again well deserved. Tom Hanks, as Captain Phillips, definitely should have been nominated for (and won) Best Actor.

This movie, based on actual events from 2009, was an excellent, thrilling, taut, edge-of-my-seat movie. The acting was superb. The special effects were stunning. I was definitely glad I got this in Blu-Ray.

6064894,4,B00G7M190U,"Not a lot of surprises since we knew the ending.  However I am a Tom Hanks fan and his performance was quite good as usual.  Does problems of going to sea and it highlights, in a more humane way, motivations of the people involved in piracy.",1394323200,,241,4.217391304347826

See past the hype, and check out this movie.  The performances are uniformly believable and excellent, the storyline exciting, gripping.  Remember, this movie is based on actual events, and that makes it even better.  Time flew by as I watched this movie, and it never dragged, not even for a few minutes.

6064922,5,B00G7M190U,"Camera started shaking a few minutes into the movie. Tom Hanks was not even on the boat yet. The director seemed to ease up on it after about 20 minutes, either that or I just forgot about my motion sickness after the action started. I thought I would give it four stars and take away one for motion sickness but the movie was so good that I have to give it five stars. I usually don't like action movies but this one gets into the characters so well and I felt Iike I knew them.",1394236800,,479,4.052631578947368
6064923,2,B00G7M190U,"Stripped of the million dollar production gadgetry, I'm not sure why they made this movie, as presented. Yes, I know it's based on a true story, however, at its core this is nothing but a hostage negotiation stand-off movie. I've seen better stories within this genre on Law & Order SVU. The impressive production values and the pulse-riveting movie-score disguise the remnants of a narrative that was overdone 20 years ago. This movie - unintentionally - is about Samson and Galieth, the former being the pirates. Yes, a couple of young, uneducated and desperate thugs from Somalia have gotten themselves into a situation that's way over their heads. Tom Hanks tries VERY hard to make his captors appear as formidable adversaries but he never succeeds. Even in captivity, Hank's Captain Phillips is able to easily manipulate them. Later, the Somalians find themselves doing battle with the big-bad American Navy with their billion dollar military hardware. It's obvious even before the pirates overtake Captain Phillips' ship they are in over their heads, when their small ship breaks down during the first attempt to breach the ship. The pirates are angry, untrained, uneducated but armed - the latter unfortunately is their undoing. The pirates' fate is abundantly clear when the SEAL's arrive by parachute and by sea. The contrasting professionalism and might of the opposing forces, the American Navy versus the pirates, is so lopsided you can't help but feel sympathy for the pirates, as the audience knows what their fate is going to be. It's like watching an NFL team play a little-league football pee-wee team, to the death. Yes, I know pirates are thugs and criminals but they are also desperate. It's a desperation that will never be completely understood in the West. I would suspect President Obama blessed the SEAL's mission. If it hadn't been for this, I would say the narrative of Captain Phillips, as presented by the movie, borders on being a little racist. As a propaganda movie, Captain Phillips' narrative is designed as an attaboy for the military and is designed to show pirates or any other threat out there what to expect if they mess with Americans at sea. The pirates are desperate thugs and criminals but at least they don't make movies about their accomplishments.",1394236800,,2293,5.020997375328084

What's not clear is why any shipment of food and goods would ever travel those waters without carrying a rifle or gun of their own.  The cargo ship was simply a sitting duck and very vulnerable without a weapon on board to defend it.  The attack and capture procedure of the much bigger cargo ship was a bit fake looking or hard to imagine.  Again, why were there no weapons of defense?  This is never addressed in the movie.

Tom Hanks was brilliant but the story didn't develop Capt Phillips' compassion enough and it was eclipsed by the arrogance of the navy rescuers and the constant outbursts of anger. This film doesn't enrich us in any way however noble the story.,1394150400,,372,4.828125

6064943,5,B00G7M190U,"Very nice copy of this film, I saw this film and it is very interesting and represents part of the history of this loved country, how a brave captain faced a kidnapping issued and how brave navy seals solved this situation.",1394150400,,223,4.463414634146342
6064944,5,B00G7M190U,"The portrayal of the true story of the Hijacking of a container ship is spot on. Mr. Hanks has come a long way in his acting and here he is at his best. As the ships captain he acts with authority,knowledge and courage and even compassion for his kidnappers. The actors who played the pirates also did a fine job. Three cheers for the SEALS too. Well worth the purchase price",1394150400,,375,4.295774647887324
6064945,5,B00G7M190U,"Captain Phillips was awesome!!  One barometer I use to assess a movie is how much I think about it afterwards.  After this movie, my teenage daughter and I immediately went to the internet to learn more about the actors in the movie and the real Captain Phillips story.  We could not believe that Muse and the gang were non-actors prior to this movie who simply answered a casting call.  The movie kept me at the edge of my seat.  And, yes ... I screamed at the screen a few times (but I was at home so I think that's allowed).  It was emotional, suspenseful, funny at times (we have weird senses of humor), and engaging.  We actually liked this movie more than 12 Years A Slave which was also superb.",1394150400,,701,4.346153846153846
6064946,5,B00G7M190U,The cast members chosen for the roles was perfect.  You felt as if you were there.  Definitely worthy of the 'buzz' it received.,1394150400,,128,4.521739130434782
6064947,4,B00G7M190U,"4 stars because it is based on a true story. Some of it did not set well with me as being true, just seemed a bit plotted and perhaps a little too convenient. I felt the movie got away from reality in order to protect the representation of Captain Phillips, because it became obvious to me that ""something"" was not done in order for the ship to get captured in the first place. if it happened the way the movie portrays it to have happened, it seems very unlikely it would have been successful.",1394150400,,494,4.26595744680851

6064952,5,B00G7M190U,Tom Hanks is great in this movie.  The Captain does a remarkable job preparing his crew to face these bad guys.,1394150400,,111,4.285714285714286
6064953,3,B00G7M190U,"Too predictable knowing the outcome in advance. Couldn't stop thinking of previous Hanks movies like Forest Gump and the one where his Fedex plane crashes and he survives on an island, sorry cant remember the name of that movie.",1394150400,,228,4.871794871794871

6064955,4,B00G7M190U,"Get ready for a gloriously directed thriller. Paul Greengrass, Hanks and Abdi are at the top of their game. A great film from beginning to end. Henry Jackman's score to the film was particular good as well.",1394150400,,206,4.594594594594595

6064962,4,B00G7M190U,"I really enjoyed the story here, and Tom Hanks was pretty realistic I think.  The acting was very good as a whole,  the story was told honestly and truthfully. I would recommend that it be watched and enjoyed.  Its not over-military commando style, it was a very human story.",1394064000,,275,4.571428571428571
6064963,5,B00G7M190U,The movie realism and the main characters performances did a fantastic job telling this true and very compelling story. Tom Hanks should have been awarded an Oscar for his performance.,1394064000,,184,5.166666666666667

6064965,5,B00G7M190U,I didn't think a documentary type movie with the results already known would be able to hold my interest but this one did.  Tom Hanks was solid as always.  Barkhad Abdi was fascinating because you know he actually came from that type of life.,1394064000,,242,4.4772727272727275
6064966,5,B00G7M190U,I'm a movie buff and I love documentaries before this move I saw the documentary on this same incident and I thought it was pretty insightful so when this movie came out I thought I wouldn't want to see it. Then one day this came up on my recommended screen and I took the leap of faith. This movie is nothing like a documentary in any way shape or form it was excellent and the performance was awesome. To see how it went from the other side was amazing and the use of trickery and wits was great. Very well done 5 stars all day long,1394064000,,534,4.047169811320755

6064973,4,B00G7M190U,"I see why it didn't win the Academy Awards, but some of the winners were doubtful too. Pretty exciting movie to watch, but wasn't up to the excitement of Rambo IV, who took no prisoners, in fighting our enemies, Maybe was just to show how attacks are managed today, trying to reason with terrorist and "" negotiate"". Snipers missed many chances to blow off some heads with a good shot, especially when Phillips jumped into the water to escape, Why wasn't the ship Alabama not armed ?..typical PC of today.",1394064000,,504,4.611111111111111
6064974,5,B00G7M190U,Perfectly crafted and performed real life thriller. Felt like I was out to sea and in shock alongside the Captain. And also empathetic with the plight of the pirate villian. Storytelling and direction were superb!,1394064000,,213,5.114285714285714

6064976,3,B00G7M190U,"Somewhere there is a great film inside Captain Phillips, but this isn't it. I saw a show on the history channel about the real-life event the film is based on, and it's better. The acting in this film is first rate, and while I admire the filmmaker's efforts to bring tension to the screen, he couldn't sustain it all the way, and the last third of the film was a frenetic mess.  Worth watching though for Tom Hanks who once again proves why he is an American treasure, and for Barkhad Abdi, who I did not think was playing a pirate, I thought he was a real pirate. Kudos.",1394064000,,572,4.247706422018348

6064979,4,B00G7M190U,"Not super thought provoking, but if you are in the mood to sit and enjoy a movie with a bit of suspense, I recommend",1394064000,,116,3.875
6064980,5,B00G7M190U,I found this movie to be intense and the actors did an excellent job of reproducing a dramatic true story of the capture and recovery of Captain Phillips.  Tom Hanks was amazing!,1394064000,,178,4.5625

6064985,5,B00G7M190U,I was captivated the entire movie.  I would give this six stars if I could.  Tom Hanks and Barkhad Abdi were amazing in this epic drama.,1393977600,,136,4.1923076923076925
6064986,1,B00G7M190U,The disk has a big scratch on the back. I tried to play the movie yesterday and discovered the scratch.  I went onto Sony's site to try to download the UV version to the TV and that did not work either.  Very disappointing.  As for all the items I bought from Amazon this is the first item I am very displeased with this purchase,1393977600,,329,4.109375
6064987,3,B00G7M190U,"The acting was very good, especially Hanks. He never letsus down. Because the incident was real and was on the news so much it took away a lot of the suspense. I prefer to knowalmost nothing about a movie before I see it. I want it all to be a surprise.",1393977600,,253,3.980392156862745
6064988,5,B00G7M190U,"This is a sit-on-the-edge-of your seat movie. Tom Hanks is superb as Captain Phillips.

6064992,5,B00G7M190U,"The situation and acting were very well done, and the story line clearly provides answers to why these types of incidents happen.  The story also shows why changes should be made to discourage pirating of these important vessels with security forces.  Well worth watching.",1393977600,,272,5.159090909090909

6065006,5,B00G7M190U,"The whole reason I watched this movie was to see Max Martini, and he wasn't in it nearly enough. However, I got sucked into the plot quickly. I don't know how realistic the story line was compared to what really happened, but I go to a movie to be entertained anyway. If I wanted a realistic accounting I'd read the newspaper. Well, wait a minute, that might not work either. Seriously though, why I gave the movie five stars was because of the last fifteen/twenty minutes of the movie. During that time I saw, clearly, what an absolutely amazing actor Tom Hanks is. I've always thought he was a good actor, but the ending of this movie pushed him to the top in terms of talent. During those moments I forgot I was watching a movie and was standing right next to him. And that says a lot.",1393891200,,788,4.331081081081081

6065009,5,B00G7M190U,Tom Hanks can play just about anything but he surely was perfectly cast and played this role extremely well. Supporting acting was wel coached and this is a great triumph of good vs evil,1393891200,,186,4.5

6065015,4,B00G7M190U,"The story was very interesting and Tom Hanks acting was great, but the presentation was terrible.  The movie kept stopping and a circle revolving in the center of the screen appeared to be rewinding.  This happened almost every five minutes throughout the presentation and prolonged it to two and one half hours.  This was very aggravating and will make me hesitate to rent another movie from Amazon.  Will this happen with the free movies as well?  If so, your great deal seems like misrepresentation.

Please refund my $4.99.  I could have paid one dollar more to Direct TV and watched the movie without any problems. I would like to know why this happened.  Can you give me an explanation?  Also, , I paid for HD and it was not in HD!

This film will keep you on the edge of your seat, even though you probably know the story outlines from news accounts. Hanks portrayal of the Captain after he has been rescued is particularly riveting, and reveals a dramatic skill I didn't know he had.

The plight of Captain Phillips as he tries to save the lives of his crew from the pirates and later fights for his own survival truly made me feel.  I didn't feel as if I were watching a movie.  I felt as if I were Captain Phillips.  I felt the knot in my stomach, the dry mouth, the panic over what to say or do in order to merely survive the ruthless pirates.  Even though I knew enough about the true story to know the outcome, I didn't know HOW it was going to work out.  I was in complete suspense.  This is truly an excellent drama.",1393891200,,755,4.08843537414966

6065027,5,B00G7M190U,This is one of the most intense movies that I've seen. Tom Hanks acting after the rescue of Captain Phillips was truly awesome. The leader of the pirates provided a great balance between extreme intensity and quiet control of his captive. Great acting!,1393891200,,252,4.883720930232558

6065035,5,B00G7M190U,"Everything was great about this movie and I recommend it as good entertainment. What was frustrating however was the fact that you see two small pirate skiffs approaching your gigantic vessel and they're allowed to take over the ship without any more defense than some water cannons. Not one pistol or rifle onboard to repel boarders. To me, that's criminal in itself that when traveling in those waters and the threat of piracy is so prevalent that more attempts aren't made to protect the ship, not to mention the safety and well being of the crew. It's disgraceful at the least. I hope some lessons were learned here. Now.....on the other side of the coin are the Somalies themselves. Who'se addressing the source of that problem? Bottom line. Good movie and recommended.",1393891200,,774,4.871212121212121
6065036,4,B00G7M190U,"Movie was realistic and kept me on the edge of my seat throughout. It put a face on the Pirates; they are terrorists, without question, but they themselves are pathetic, poor, terrorized, and oppressed. Hanks did a great job portraying a brave guy (for sure), but nevertheless, just a basic guy who was punching a clock and doing his job. He was not a Navy Seal; he was just an ordinary guy who had to rise to levels of valor and bravery like never before. He's a hero because of this simplicity, and how he kept it all together for his and his men's sake throughout the ordeal. BTW, why didn't every commercial ship have a few ex-military guys on board for protection as they passed by Somalia in the last 5-6 years?",1393891200,,717,4.398496240601504

6065049,5,B00G7M190U,This is a beautifully acted suspense drama. Glimpses of the tragedy of the pirates elevate it beyond good guy- bad guy action.,1393891200,,126,4.7727272727272725

6065051,5,B00G7M190U,"We all watched the headlines as the story unfolded live and I wonder how much poetic license the film took, but it certainly is thought provoking. The fear and brutality that Captain Phillips must have felt and endured became real. The thing that made me think though is it's easy to think of the pirates just as bad, evil people.  However, looking at the conditions the pirates came from--hunger, no shoes--extreme poverty, it's easier to see that desperate people do desperate things. In no way am I excusing their acts, just a bit more comprehension. As always kudos to our US military.",1393891200,,589,4.7745098039215685

6065058,2,B00G7M190U,I think in this case they should have gone more with the real story...it was never clear how many days they spent on the life boat...the glass at the door where the guy gut his feet never happened...the crew spent 5 days in plus 115 degree Fahrenheit temperatures....I mean if you are going to deviate from the real plot you should make the story more suspenseful or believable not less,1393891200,,386,4.5285714285714285

6065064,5,B00G7M190U,What an absolutely wonderful film!  The time seemed to fly by as you went through the same terror as that experienced by Captain Phillips.  It's a shame that Tom Hanks' incredible performance wasn't recognized by an Academy Award.  Just watch the final scene in the ship's sick bay and see if he doesn't deserve it!,1393891200,,315,4.6909090909090905

It is a movie that you won't forget, I really hate when people spoil the movie but this movie is based on a true story about a man who had his whole ship taken over by pirates and is captured himself and held hostage. I recommend this to anyone who wants a thrill.

I'm sorry, but none of the other roles this year besides 12 Years a Slave can even be considered in the same league. Hanks is once again brilliant in a film that takes him out to sea. His portrayal of the true story of Richard Philips takes his career to new heights. The suffering and fear that brave man endured was terrible and Hanks was able to dig deep into the experience. The film was very well done without overdoing it with the senseless ignorant violence you saw in most other Hollywood films this year-- maybe because it's a true story. Maybe it's time Hollywood ought to start taking more nonfiction to task and forget the silly over the top thoughtless fiction. Captain Philips is right up there with Cast Away and Forest Gump as another great American film.",1393804800,,892,4.58125
6065071,5,B00G7M190U,"One of Tom Hanks greatest movies.  Very realistic plot of a civilian ship surviving pirates off Somalian coast, which is a frequent occurrence in the wide ocean where big ship travel daily in large numbers, but use no weapon defense.

6065094,1,B00G7M190U,I gave this movie a shot based on all the hype it received. It was the slowest moving movie I have ever seen. The acting was passable at best. The only enjoyable part was when the Navy Seals finally made a move on the pirates in the last 5-10 minutes of the movie. I want my 2 hours back!,1393804800,2,288,3.8983050847457625

It's a good thing it was based on a true story of which the ending I already knew, otherwise I might not have been able to sit through it. The suspense would have been much.

6065123,3,B00G7M190U,I found this movie a bit dull to watch only because you know the ending if you watch the news.  The story lacked any real tension and since it was done on many news shows in-depth.  While I love Paul Greenglass and his outstanding work especially on United 93.  But this tries to add a bit of Hollywood to a well told tale.  The acting in the movie is certainly top notch but it's certainly not one of the top movies of the year.  I will give Greenglass credit for making the Somali's sympathetic and not treating them as stock villains.  This is worth at least one star in this movie.,1393718400,,585,4.225225225225225

6065130,3,B00G7M190U,"Paul Greengrass is raising questions about what film is capable of, and his own ""docufictions"" have been both disturbing and problematic in their approaches to such subject matter as is on display in ""Captain Phillips."" To me, this is an exploitation movie that is not quite exploitative enough to be successful. We are having a dry spell at the box office, so I am trying to be nice about the kind of adulation that is being heaped upon this title; however, as suspenseful as some of this is, one can't help thinking that we've seen all of this before. However, it has to be said that this movie is harrowing and, as per Greengrass's almost sadistic want, very unpleasant at times to watch. There may be an allegory here about the pirating of movies too (if so, the joke is not very funny), but there are certainly signs that the Cineplex is being controlled by pirates! In any case, Hanks is good as far as the movie goes, but his all too familiar presence seriously depletes the dramatic power of this otherwise tightly constructed script. The extra 'making of' feature is too informative for my taste and could have been edited a bit, but otherwise the disc is a good package overall.

The real life story of the captain of the cargo ship is gripping and compelling.  Some of the details were released at the time of the incident, including the general rescue and what was done, but this brings the entire story together.

Everything about this is stellar and Barkhad Abdi still has a shot tomorrow. for an award. though it would be difficult to beat Jared Leto.

6065190,4,B00G7M190U,"Based on the real life story and book by Captain Richard Phillips, Captain Phillips is an authentic recreation of the events leading up to the hijacking of an American freighter ship on the high seas by modern day Somali pirates in 2009.  Directed by Paul Greengrass (United 93, The Bourne Ultimatum), the film is a non-stop edge of your seat entertainment that puts you in the midst of a seemingly hopeless situation.  Tom Hanks and a talented supporting cast bring the participants to life in one of the years best films.

Phillips is a responsible commander of a freighter with a small crew.  As he boards his ship and readies to embark at sea, a group of Somali men prepares to search for nearby ships to board and hold hostage for money.  As the freighter nears the Somali waters, the pirates give chase and the race is on as Phillips follows a series of procedures to elude and repel the invaders.  When the pirates board and take control of the bridge by force, the dynamic has shifted to a hostage situation. As the Somali, who are smart and cautious, search the ship for other crew members, it becomes a tense game of cat and mouse.  Led by Muse (Barkhad Abdi), the pirates want money even as US military forces come to the rescue.  A tense standoff leads Phillips and his captors to the freighters life boat and a race against time to save the brave captain.

Phillips and his crew take creative steps to make this hijacking as difficult as possible.  They even follow a protocol for securing the ship from boarders by running drills and taking extra precautions.  Phillips himself proves resourceful even when alone with his captors by making innocent suggestions that have ulterior motives and meaning.

The scene where the pirates take over the bridge is well shot and has a real time feel.  Nobody shoots docudramas better than Greengrass with his rapid edits and handheld cameras.  He conveys a sense of progressively worsening desperation and hopelessness.  Henry Jackmans score matches the intensity of the film.

Like the concluding mission in Zero Dark Thirty, the final sequence here is meticulously detailed and ratchets the suspense to an unbearable level even though most people know how these events transpired.  The play is the thing, and Greengrass executes the finale like a true, military SEAL operation complete with preparations and tactics.  The climax is a brilliantly edited moment of split second timing, patience, and decisive action. It affects the audience on a visceral level where so much is at risk

Hanks (Saving Mr. Banks, Philadelphia) is completely convincing as Phillips.  Abdi is authentic and menacing as Muse, all the more impressive since he was a total amateur when cast in the role. You even feel a bit of sympathy for Muse because he comes from a place of poverty where there are few options in life, and you come to realize that he is a person under extreme pressure from his bosses on the mainland.  In fact, utilizing mostly unknowns aside from Hanks, works to the films realism.  The other Somali men are each given a chance to shine and have unique personas which makes what happens to them a shared experience.

You also wonder how Phillips wife and family are reacting to the crisis but you never see them despite Catherine Keeners brief role as his wife at the beginning.  That could have raised the stakes a bit more emotionally.

By the films stunning resolution, there is an emotional release in Phillips that the audience shares.  It is in these last several minutes that Hanks draws you into his heartbreaking trauma.  It is here that he excels in an emotional performance in an emotional film, where a brave man said and did the right things under extreme duress.",1393632000,,3729,4.7859375

Overall, an interesting story that was supposedly based on true events.  I'd like to know why these Somali pirates are allowed to get away with so much, even now. My guess is that this country and others are secretly behind the piracy. Why else aren't we doing anything to stop it.

Movie was great once I got it to play.....I would highly recommend it. Amazon refunded the money paid for the movie rental due to the issue so even though it was no convenient and somewhat frustrating it ended up a win-win situation...I saw a great movie and didn't have to pay for it.,1393372800,,460,4.423529411764706

were a nice surprise. . .movie did well at showing their humanity without romanticizing the violence

edit would have cut the run time from 135 minutes down to 105-110 or so but oh well.  Worth seeing.",1393372800,,394,4.458333333333333

6065291,5,B00G7M190U,"When it first started, I thought this was going to be boring. It turned out to be brilliant. It was stunned how little protection a ship that big had in such waters; it is an invite for trouble, in this case Somalian pirates. I liked everything about the movie.

Tom Hanks is a brilliant actor as were many of the other people in the movie.",1393372800,,340,4.230769230769231

6065293,4,B00G7M190U,"That pirate captain is scary/creepy. Of course, Hanks is no slouch and does his usual great performance. But that pirate captain guy was a welcome surprise as he was by no means a one dimensional bad guy stereotype kind of character.",1393372800,,233,4.7073170731707314

6065308,5,B00G7M190U,I never knew how tough it was for Captain Phillips but this movie has some of the best acting I have ever seen.  I'm surprised Tom Hanks isn't up for best actor.  But the actor playing the lead pirate was brilliant.  Was such a intense movie.,1393372800,,242,4.217391304347826

Lots of tension and action, but unlike most ""action"" movies"", this screen play uncovers the intricacies of county, culture, and above all, the struggle of the human spirit for life and meaning. Hanks gives a superb performance, but the supporting characters, particularly those playing the Ethiopian pirates, also give outstanding depictions of the dilemma of fisherman caught in the vise of political and economic forces beyond their control, helping the viewer to neither demonize nor glibly excuse them.",1393200000,,631,5.257425742574258

6065443,5,B00G7M190U,I bought this movie because I  had followed the story on the news about Captain Phillips. Tom Hanks is a great actor and should have won an award for his portrayal of the brave captain. I had some questions while watching the movies about why some things were not done in a more timely manner. I got my answer in an e-mail from a friend. There were numerous times the rescue team could have done things quicker but President Obama would not give the go ahead.  It is a very good movie and I'm sure anyone who watches it will wonder at the same things I did.,1393113600,,557,4.196261682242991

Captain Phillips runs the Alabama ;which is a cargo ship. they have to travel through dangerous waters near Somalia and other third world countries where killing and stealing has to become a way of survival for many men . Like a job, really.

Tom Hanks does a good job as usual . After all he is Tom Hanks. But in this movie he is supposed to talk with an eastern accent which comes out only occasionally and not all the time. The chief pirate also comes across talking almost perfect english at times and then remember they are not supposed to speak perfect english.

So, in that way it is not such a good movie to watch. But ignoring the language accents they mess up. they Tell the story pretty much as they should. The best part being the rescue of Captain Phillips which brings the old Tom Hanks back and is quite moving .",1393027200,,878,4.315151515151515

It is a struggle not only between the crew on the ship but also a struggle in between the pirates themselves which makes it easy for things to be unpredictable.  It is a great thriller and has twists and turns and is a must see movie.  It is entertaining from start to ending and tells a great story.

My only amazement - actually more like utter shock - maybe down to no background or knowledge in what international cargo ships can or can not have in turns of weapons to defend them selves in such circumstances is such as piracy:

What don't they have guns to defend themselves in ultra emmergency security situations. I mean they know the waters are infested with pirates in that region???",1393027200,,518,5.154761904761905

I loved seeing the Navy in action and getting a glimpse into how situations could be ""handled"" for the sake of America. It was well written and well acted as well. I shed a couple if tears along with fist pumps. Although I knew the story, the movie kept me drawn in with the ""thinking"" from the pirates perspective.",1392940800,,464,4.224719101123595

6065558,5,B00G7M190U,This was everything that the publicity and Oscar Award nomination said it would be.  Tom Hanks IS Capt.

6065559,4,B00G7M190U,"I believe this movie is a reliably realistic reenactment of the Maersk Alabama hijacking by Somali pirates in 2009 and a true portrait of the ruthless, greedy pirates. It's also an incredible story of quick thinking on the part of a ship's crew to thwart the hijackers and lead to their capture.  Very dramatic as well.  A great make-up job on Tom Hanks to make him look like Captain Phillips.  I only recognized him from his voice at the beginning of the movie.
Tom Hanks did an excellent job acting this role.  I just felt that the end was dragged out in order to pull out maximum melodrama.  I didn't quite believe his portrayal of a captain in shock after his rescue but maybe I'm being unfair.  An eye-opening movie.",1392854400,,721,4.507692307692308

6065561,5,B00G7M190U,Great movie! It kept me on my the edge of my seat the entire time. I really enjoy watching films of this nature based off actual real events. Great portrayal of the US Navy and Navy Seals too! A huge thank you to our Military for taking their jobs seriously and protecting America.,1392854400,,281,4.320754716981132
6065562,2,B00G7M190U,There isn't much to say about this movie.  The movie builds up mostly to the shooting at the end.  The navy seals are awesome but the whole movie is just about the end 3 simultaneous shots.,1392854400,,189,4.222222222222222
6065563,1,B00G7M190U,"I didn't find the plot, acting, any part of it exciting or worth the time to watch it. Come on! 3 row boats, 9 semi thugs and the row boats have engines on them are taking down a 3 story freighter. They put up a ladder to the side and no one does anything? They take over the boat and it's ""Now stay calm, we're waiting for help, no one wants to be hurt"". ARE YOU KIDDING? Geez, this is supposed to be a real story and if so ah, don't think I'd much want Captain Phillips heading my ship. Acting, nothing of note. REAL disappointment in Tom Hanks who normally is excellent but given the role, heck just play it, collect pay day and move on. Next coming-3 ten year olds plot to take over a prison, wow how exciting as they do it-yeah, about as real as that.",1392854400,2,756,4.046666666666667

6065565,5,B00G7M190U,This was a great movie. Very intense from start to finish. Tom Hanks is a great actor. The sad part is this movie was based on a true story.,1392854400,,140,3.8620689655172415
6065566,5,B00G7M190U,"Captain Phillips is a powerfully simple tale of one man's response to a life-threatening situation.  Tom Hanks' portrayal of a ship's captain set upon by pirates and then kidnapped for ransom is one of his most emotionally affecting roles.  Hanks makes the movie what it is.  If you want a simple tale of how a kind and able man expressing his humanity in the midst of a crisis, you'll like Captain Philips.  Forget the reviews that mention photography quality or camera angles.  This is about Hanks' portrayal.  It's something you don't want to miss.",1392854400,,551,4.808510638297872
6065567,4,B00G7M190U,It was a great movie and really liked. It did show how bad the situation is on the East African coast. I sailed there over ten years ago on an American ship and is was dangerous then. The acting by Tom Hanks and the other actors portraying the pirates was well done. This was a good movie.,1392854400,,289,4.087719298245614
6065568,5,B00G7M190U,"I loved the fact that I could buy this movie or rent it in two different formats. It was fast, it didn't lag and played without a skip or pixels compromised. The only thing I didn't like was not having the special features. If I rented or bought the DVD it would come with special features and I really really like the special features.

 I loved this movie, Tom Hanks is one of my favorite actors anyway, but the last scene of this movie was one of his best performances I have been lucky enough to watch. it was just overwhelming and moving. It made me believe that he himself had just been through this horrific ordeal. My heart broke for Richard Phillips, and I don't think there is an actor out there today that would have done this man justice in telling the story about what he went through. I feel it was an Oscar winning performance.",1392854400,,842,4.322784810126582
6065569,5,B00G7M190U,This movie was excellent.  Tom Hanks did a wonderful job portraying the captain.  It was suspenseful the entire movie.  I would watch it again.,1392854400,,143,4.875
6065570,5,B00G7M190U,"Even though I lived in Vermont only a few miles from where the real Captain Phillips lives, and this was big news at the time up there (I live in FL now), I am not a news junkie so I didn't read all of the details of the stories - I just saw what they showed us on the TV news which wasn't much. I had an idea about what happened but nothing prepared me for the ordeal that Phillips went through that was portrayed in the movie. I had heard that he was involved in the making of the movie to some degree making sure the screenplay depicted the truth of the events and not some hopped up Hollywood mis-representation designed to sell tickets. I am sure that they made things dramatic for the cinema so that they would not lose money, but as I understand it the film was fairly accurate in it's depiction. Hats off to Captain Phillips for enduring, surviving, keeping his wits... but more because he went back out again several months later and resumed his career as a Merchant vessel captain. A true Vermonter in every sense of the word.

6065573,3,B00G7M190U,"Tom Hanks is excellent as usual and the outstanding actors playing the Somali pirates were frightening, making you almost believe they were pirates. If Captain Phillips behaved anything like portrayed in the film, he is a remarkable and brave man. Negatives for me were the music was too intense to much of the time, didn't care for so much handheld camera work, didn't care for the choppy editing, I guess director was going for a documentary look. Feels slightly propaganda-ish with the Navy saving the day, and casting Tom Hanks, and the sometimes slightly friendly conversations between the Tom Hanks' character and the pirates after his kidnap: seemed unlikely that those conversations would take place as many times as they did, and the way that they did. For a captive fearing for his life, the Captain seemed overly talkative. I liked his intelligence and initiative though. If this part of the story was accurate, if the Captain was that functional under pressure, the writer should've shown that side of the Captain, pre-heist, so it'd be more believable during the kidnapping. It might've happened similar to this in real life, but the writer should've made the Captain's behavior believable in the story, in other words, the fact that the Captain was so good under pressure should've been established earlier in the story so that I could accept it as truth when it mattered. As filmed, there seemed too many conversations between captive and pirates, it seemed too ""Hollywoody."" If the Captain was really like this during his kidnapping ordeal or if the writer wanted me to believe that the Captain was like this, he/she should've established that part of the Captain's character earlier in the story.

It's impossible to be pro-pirate, though what are peasants along coastal countries to do if larger more powerful countries illegally fish off their coasts, depleting the fish stock and drying up their livelihood. I'm not accusing America of doing this, I just saw a BBC documentary on Youtube called the Future of Food, parts 1 through 3, which discusses just such an issue from African fishermen point of view, and the trawler illegally fishing their waters was a Spanish ship, not an American one.  In this story, the Somali head pirate poses just such a question, what do fishermen do when their traditional livelihood dries up through no fault of their own. Absolutely no justification for kidnapping and harming other innocent citizens. This film shows how impoverished fishermen and peasants can be forced into a life of crime, get caught up in the violence and perpetuate the violence themselves, and get in over their heads.  What I liked about the story is that it showed how their Warlord forced them into criminal activity; also liked how story showed how peasants are used: the lead pirate said he'd taken a ship hostage a year ago and gotten $6 million. He couldn't explain to Tom Hanks' character why he was still pirating after that heist: it showed that the Warlord took all the money, especially clear when you consider the opening scenes where you see the pirates, pre-heist, living in abject poverty. Though the shooting style is heavy handed, film is worth watching for the acting. 3 and a half stars.",1392854400,,3236,4.944852941176471

 I don't mean to brag but have a pretty good system and sometimes need to turn the volume up & adjust the sound on some Blu Rays however not with Captain Phillips as is Mastered in 4K for maximum picture & sound with special features and the making including an interview with the real Captain Richard Phillips , A PG rated film and 134 minutes long Directed by Paul Greengrass .

6065619,5,B00G7M190U,"While there is some controversy about the real Merchant Mariner, Captain Richard Phillips, there is no doubt that Tom Hanks' characterization of Phillips in this biopic is absolutely masterful...one of his best performances in years, and should garner him at least a nomination for Best Actor. Most of us remember reading about the hijacking of the Maersk Alabama by Somali pirates; the heroic actions by Captain Phillips; and the precision rescue by U. S. Navy personnel; and director Paul Greengrass has crafted the film to fit the news reporting as I remember it. And Greengrass crafts a top notch actioner...the pacing is such that a long film at 134 minutes actually seems much shorter; there are no dead spots and no wasted footage. The Somali pirates, while appropriately villainous, are not presented as totally ruthless...there is a level of sympathy attached to them. The actors who play them do a fine job. My oldest grandson (he's 15) and I watched it and thoroughly enjoyed it...unless the aforementioned controversy affects the jury, I'm betting this film will earn at least a Best Picture nomination.",1392681600,,1115,5.098360655737705

I found myself wanting to know more of the backstory of the Somali pirates: how did subsistence fishing villages turn to piracy?  What about the loss of fishing grounds to international dragline fishing ships and destruction of the villagers'  primary food source and economy?  I wonder what would I do if the local farmlands where I live were ravaged and my friends and neighbors starving...
This movie should be followed by a good documentary on the true 'ourstory' of the Somali pirates.  I suspect that is a complex and compelling drama in itself.",1392681600,,701,4.658536585365853

It's a  true story, there's no unnecessary violence or weird or bizarre stuff that will give  you nightmares or turn your stomach. It's full of tense action. You will be proud to be an American but might also have a bit of understanding of why the pirates jumped aboard this ship. I'm not saying it's right. I'm saying it's a complex world we're living in. This movie helps us understand a bit more. I highly reco this movie. It's good.",1392681600,,492,4.336956521739131

6065643,4,B00G7M190U,Whenever Hollywood does a movie based on a true event or person you have to wonder how much they added to make it more exciting. Like Argo. No chase down the runway for the real life group but it did add drama. This was a good movie and even though you know the Captain is saved you are still on the edge of your seat. Tom Hanks was wonderful in it as well.,1392681600,,357,3.904109589041096

6065647,4,B00G7M190U,"Captain Phillips is very good. It's an intense thriller that will keep you on the edge of your seat. It gets a little tedious in the final third of the movie, but you'll be invested in the outcome by then. Paul Greengrass knows how to direct tense, up-close action quite well and he does it again here. Tom Hanks gives an amazing performance, as does Barkhad Abdi and all of the supporting actors are solid as well. You can't go wrong with Captain Phillips for a quick thriller that won't weigh on you for long after like several of the other Oscar nominees will!",1392681600,,563,4.423076923076923

Suspenseful and action-packed to the end.  It's somewhat violent, but not as much even as some prime-time tv shows, and there's no sex, and is informative about geography, piracy, and culture, so would be suitable for older students. Tom Hanks does a great acting job. It'll keep you glued until the end!",1392681600,,469,4.825

6065688,5,B00G7M190U,"This movie was superbly shot and filmed leaving you at the edge of your seat. At times you think you are watching a documentary, but you have to realize it is just that - a movie. Although there has been some debate as to the films actual depiction of the events that occurred (I do remember bits of hearing of the event in the news), as far as a ""movie"" is concerned it is grade A. After watching the acting in this movie you understand why it was nominated for Best Picture - simply marvelous acting by all cast members.",1392681600,,522,4.23
6065689,2,B00G7M190U,"Big disappointment.

Hanks was great, as was the his nemesis. Yet the story was unforgivably flat, missing all opportunities to develop the themes they winked at vaguely but failed to actually present.

The characters do not transform on their journey, gain no new insights on the world or themselves, and merely amble through a news report lazily written into an underdeveloped screenplay. Which is really too bad since the heavy-handed opening scene suggests the film will explore some stark juxtapositions between America's competitive job market and the REAL dog-eat-dog struggles of doing ""business"" in a place like Somalia.

I give it 2 stars for committed, competent acting and a skilled production team, but only two stars for no one bothering to make a better script.",1392595200,5,776,5.192

6065701,5,B00G7M190U,"Tom Hanks is outstanding in this movie.  It grabs you instantly.

The only negative is that the way they filmed this the camera was frequently moving either up and down or side to side and it made my wife motion sick.  We have a 110"" screen so maybe this wouldn't be so noticeable on smaller screens.

The movie itself was outstanding.  Great acting, great story.

Definitely worth the time and money to watch.",1392595200,,410,4.5479452054794525

6065729,4,B00G7M190U,"Though there were parts of the movie where I thought the Captain ""talked too much"", it is based on a true story and has your attention from the moment it starts.  Tom Hanks of course does a fabulous job in the role, and while it tells the story of Captain Philips, there is the underlying story of how these things happen.  A very good movie.",1392595200,,342,4.246153846153846

The industry (movie) seems to think the public wants to see actors hurtling through space or oceans in little metal cans (Gravity and Phillips).  Trouble is, there is very little drama to be wrung out of two camera angles and a 20 word dialogue repeated ad nauseum.  This movie and Gravity should have been 10 minute special news reports delivered by Walter Cronkite.  Tom Hanks remains at the top of the heap though.  Skinny amateur actors with bad teeth...not so much.",1392595200,,604,4.695238095238095

It was one of the most intense movies we have ever seen---you even know how it is going to end before the movie starts, but it is so intense you cannot look away.  Both Hanks and the young man who played Muse were fantastic.  The last five minutes of the movie was enough for Hanks to win that Oscar, and I truly hope Muse wins for best supporting actor.  I have seen it twice now...probably won't see it again, but it was worth it even the second time.  It's a must see.",1392595200,,556,4.158878504672897

6065782,4,B00G7M190U,We enjoyed watching this movie on the plane the other day.  It held our attention the entire time making the trip go quickly.,1392595200,,125,4.434782608695652
6065783,5,B00G7M190U,"Terrific movie.  I tend to stsrt watching the clock about 45 minutes into most movies.  Not this time, Captain Phillips had me leaning forward in anticipation of what would happen next.  Best movie I've seen in years.  While not an ""action"" movie per se there is plenty of action.  Acting, direction, script are all top notch.",1392595200,,326,4.75
6065784,5,B00G7M190U,"This was a great film, probably the best I've seen in a while.  Perhaps best, it's based(and pretty accurately from what I understand) on the piracy event off the Somali coast of a couple years ago.  First of all, the depiction of how the captain and crew prevented the Somali pirates from taking the ship Maersk Alabama when they were onboard is a tribute to their ingenuity.  That they managed to get a weapon away from the terrorists(because that's what they are) and get them to leave the ship is a tribute to their courage and intelligence.  That they took the captain hostage was bad, but it would have been so much worse had they had 20 hostages rather than one.  It is also a tribute to Captain Phillips and the seal team snipers, who acted with courage and skill to take out the pirates.
The one thing that bothered me was the fact that the commercial ship was totally unarmed.  With just one captured automatic weapon, the crew managed to get the four other pirates(all armed with automatic weapons) to leave the ship.  Had the crew had one automatic weapon before the encounter instead of some ineffective water cannons to fire down at the approaching pirates, the four pirates would never have been able to climb aboard and take the Alabama in the first place.  Gun control does not work because the disarmed are at the mercy of any barbarian with a gun.  Commercial ships in that part of the world should be armed.  Otherwise they are just big targets.
It is amusing that probably the best movie I've seen in over a year is based on a true story and not appreciated by the Academy.  Just shows how out of touch with reality the Hollywood types really are.",1392595200,,1668,4.526666666666666
6065785,5,B00G7M190U,Its a great movie.  Too bad the real captain Phillips is a douche.  This movie according to the crew is not 100% accurate.  Specifically in the way the captain acted throughout the entire trip.  But its hollywood and Tom Hanks was great as always.,1392595200,,247,4.545454545454546
6065786,5,B00G7M190U,Great acting by Tom Hanks.  Believable occurrence.  Good cinematography. True story.  Great to be able to watch an Academy Award nominee through Amazon rental program.,1392595200,,167,5.6

6065804,5,B00G7M190U,Even though we knew what was going to happen didn't make this any less suspenseful.  Tom Hanks again wows with his acting ability. The Somalians were very scary and I can't imagine having to deal with the thought of it as ships have to go through the area.,1392508800,,256,4.333333333333333

6065806,5,B00G7M190U,"it is a rarity nowadays for a movie that doesn't put me to sleep at some point because of overuse of special effects, and this was one of them. This movie is one of the best ive seen in the last 10 years.",1392508800,,204,3.7674418604651163
6065807,4,B00G7M190U,"A really good movie, however the whole concept of this Somali pirate thing still seems hard to comprehend.

6065809,5,B00G7M190U,"It is refreshing to see a well made, suspenseful movie without a lot of computer generated effects, massive explosions, etc.  Just a straightforward rendition of a true life story, shot on a simple movie set primarily of the inside of a cargo ship, but still made riveting by terrific acting from Tom Hanks and supporting cast. I appreciated that fact that profanity was kept to a bare minimum -- movies can still be made with without turning the show blue. I also appreciate the behind the scenes insight into how our military reacts in emergency situations to rescue everyday U.S. citizens who are innocent victims of piracy (and in other scenarios, terrorism), who unfortunately find themselves in harms way. Hats off to our men & women in uniform!",1392422400,,751,4.8671875
6065810,3,B00G7M190U,"no too bad, not great; Hanks is an unbelievable actor, but his talent is sort of wasted in this pretty straightforward role; he should choose how movies with more care; far too rosy a lens to the movie, obviously geared to tender, beate souls who cannot survive without happy endings",1392422400,,283,4.68

6065814,5,B00G7M190U,"Well written and superbly cast.  You find yourself feeling for ALL of the characters (well, maybe not one of them).  This movie would be too intense for children under 11.

There was action, there was chaos, there were tears, the whole thing.  I expect no less from Tom Hanks.  You feel so sorry for him at the end of the movie after all that the poor guy had to go through and not to mention that this actually happened to a real man!  I can't imagine what HIS family must have gone through.  Anyway, terrific job Tom keep the movies a comin!!",1392422400,,484,4.042105263157895

6065830,5,B00G7M190U,"Probably one of his best films, and definitely the  best motion picture of the year.
I am guessing Oscars for Tom as best actor and another Oscar for the unknown Barkhad Abdi, for best supporting.

6065832,5,B00G7M190U,I was as impressed with this movie as I have been with most movies I have watched with Tom as the lead actor. The whole supporting cast was excellent though. Great adaptation of real world events into an enjoyable movie. I will not critique the believability of the military elements and suffice it to say it was a well made movie which I enjoyed watching.,1392422400,,356,4.492307692307692

6065835,5,B00G7M190U,"I am always eager to see sea stories.  I also am a fan of Tom Hanks.  In this movie, Barkhad Abdi stole the show as the pirate while providing most of the suspense.  The story is a little thin.  The impact of the movie is the incredible acting of Tom Hanks and the rest of the cast.

6065838,5,B00G7M190U,"Honestly, when I saw the preview - I thought I was in for a Tom Hank's stuck on a boat in the middle of the ocean.  Instead, it was a well written, well performed, well-paced thriller.  It was really well done and I highly recommend it.",1392422400,,236,4.108695652173913
6065839,5,B00G7M190U,"What a edge of my chair performance this turned out to be! You can almost feel the actual tension created by the dynamics of the 'pirates' while trying to overcome the (as it turns out) impossible task of taking the ship and keeping it away from Captain Phillips.

Don't miss it if you haven't seen it.. I'm still filled with visions from the rescue...",1392422400,,435,4.129411764705883

6065868,4,B00G7M190U,I enjoyed this move because it told the story from the Captains perspective.  It added much more human drama to the story and did not just concentrate on the Seal Team.  I think the time frame was compressed at the end of the story.  If I remember correctly the survival boat was towed for a lot longer than the movie depected.,1392422400,,327,4.327868852459017
6065869,5,B00G7M190U,The fact that I knew how it ends but still experienced tremendous relief and emotions proved to me that Tom Hank is still one of the best. Too often true stories fall flat. This one soars.,1392422400,,188,4.25

6065909,5,B00G7M190U,"The entire movie was so exciting!  I was never bored or allowed to be lulled for a moment, from start to finish.  It wasn't merely an action packed drama, but there was an underlying tension and suspense that began about 10 minutes in, and persisted to the end.  One of the best movies I've ever watched.",1392336000,,304,4.392857142857143

6065925,5,B00G7M190U,"As if you needed any other recommendation to watch a film, just note that it stars Tom Hanks. Hanks chooses his roles carefully, and brings all of his accumulated skill and talent to fully realizing the role he accepts. As Captain of a container ship plying the waters of the Indian Ocean, he commands the ship with a firm but fair hand. Though the crew is small, he admonishes them to secure the ship before they even leave port, and runs a safety drill once they are underway.

When they spot their pursuers, he immediately takes evasive action, but  due to a flaw in one of the water hoses that spout water at high pressure to fend off the pirates, the ragtag band of 4 Somali pirates are able to board the vessel and break into the bridge. In order to spare his crew from the violent unstable pirates, Phillips bravely agrees to leave the ship with the pirates in the life boat. He remains calm and even gives them advice, which of course they spurn. He shows compassion for the pirates, even offering to clean and wrap the wounded foot of the youngest Somali.

There are numerous very intense scenes where the pirates, particularly their captain, erupt into screaming matches and threaten to kill Phillips, but somehow his calm demeanor overcomes their anger. The final scenes, when the Navy SEALS arrive and dispatch the pirates, are brutal and emotional and Captain Phillips' reaction is truly stunning.

I hoped for a conclusion from this episode, such as improved security on ships in the area, or a reduction in instances of piracy, but after Phillips was freed from the pirates, the movie just ended. It was slightly dissatisfying, but still an interesting and immersive experience.",1392249600,,1693,4.7482993197278915
6065926,5,B00G7M190U,"Having followed this story in the news, it was fun to see the story filled out.  And, we had heard how good Tom Hanks was.  We were not disappointed.",1392249600,,149,4.103448275862069
6065927,4,B00G7M190U,"You never really new what happened those days. Even though parts of it may be fictional you get more of the story than what you read in the news. Well done, informative and entertaining.",1392249600,,186,4.5
6065928,5,B00G7M190U,Excellently acted.  Both the Somali and American actors all did a great job.  This film transported me to that time and place.,1392249600,,126,4.681818181818182

6065932,4,B00G7M190U,"Enjoyed this movie very much, very interesting story.  I like Tom Hanks in just about everything I've ever seen him in. My 11 year old grandson watched with us and he agreed it was a very good movie. Very glad to see they didn't add any gratuitous sex, violence or language.  The violence that was shown was pertinent to the story. Would recommend for adults and mature children 10 and older.",1392249600,,392,4.507042253521127

6065935,1,B00G7M190U,"While the movie is well-made, it's boring in quite a few parts.  Most importantly, it is not factual by any stretch.  It glorifies a captain that multitudes are claiming was by no means a hero.  If you value the truth in the matter, just go online and read the articles about this captain, his recklessness, and the lawsuits popping up over the kidnapping.  If you just want to see Tom Hanks' incredible performance, go for it.

Cannot endorse a series of lies and a possible dope being glorified.  Captain Phillips' ACTUAL acts which CAUSED the kidnapping are more interesting than this movie.",1392249600,16,594,4.7745098039215685

6065937,5,B00G7M190U,"Tom Hanks gives a breathtaking performance in this movie. This compelling movie is about the true story of Captain Phillips and the 2009 hijacking of the U.S. container ship Maersk Alabama by a crew of Somali pirates.

This movie will keep you on the edge of your seat. Strong and wonderful performance from Mr Hanks. Spoilers - the end scene of the movie was just really sad. Captain Phillips crying with relief that he is safe. The scene is just so powerful, that it will literally bring you to tears.

Watch this movie - you won't be disappointed.",1392249600,,550,4.6020408163265305
6065938,3,B00G7M190U,This wasn't my kind of movie but with this being based off true events if u actually lived it as the captain did it would be a scary situation to be in. Tom hanks is a good actor though,1392249600,,185,3.769230769230769

6065950,5,B00G7M190U,"From the start you feel something terrible is going to happen, then you spend the next hour angrily asking how the World Governments could let this happen. And it did happen, hundreds of times. Unarmed unprotected ships sailing through pirate infested waters in the 20th century !
The action is riveting, the realism on ship and off is perfect. Hanks is masterful throughout, and his performance of the last 10 minutes probably surpasses anything he has done before, including the most heart-wrenching moments of Private Ryan.",1392249600,,526,5.127906976744186
6065951,5,B00G7M190U,"So realistic that my skin was sitting at the edge of me seat for the entire movie.  Suburb acting by Tom Hanks and the actors portraying Somalia pirates.

Although the film is different than some media accounts, I am confident that it provides a fairly accurat dramatization of what happened.

One thing is clear after watching this movie, there should be no passenger or cargo ships anywhere in these dangerous seas without armed security forces onboard, whether private or provided by various governments!

Although I am rooting for Best Oscar to Matthew McConaughey for Dallas Buyers Club, Tom Hanks gave an outstanding and convincing role, so Best Actor race will be tight.",1392249600,,677,5.017857142857143
6065952,5,B00G7M190U,"I wonder where they got these pirates from?? They are almost too believable, I was impressed by the casting and the directing was great.

6065961,5,B00G7M190U,"Exciting movie , so realistic that the tension is enough to raise the blood pressure. The news story was not as thorough with the details when the event happened in 2009. I did not realize so much about the Somalian ""Pirates"" of the Indian Ocean before watching this movie. Did not realize that there actually was a very large mafia-like organization behind the phenomenon of the piracy.

6065965,3,B00G7M190U,"Enjoyed the movie having fully followed the events in real life. It saddened me that the director portrayed the captors as not so bad guys, as misguided souls instead of their true nature- violent murderous criminals.

6065967,4,B00G7M190U,"For the longest time now, Tom Hanks has been considered one of the best American actors living today. He has starred in countless movies, won two Oscars, and is a beloved figure in the film industry. In his new movie ""Captain Phillips,"" he proves his acting ability in ways you cannot imagine.

The film centers around the true story of Captain Richard Phillips and the 2009 hijacking by Somali pirates of the USflagged MV Maersk Alabama. It focuses on the relationship between Phillips and the Somali pirate captain, Muse, who takes him hostage. One hundred forty-five miles off the Somali coast, both men will find themselves at the mercy of forces beyond their control.

With pacing that will keep you on the edge of your seat at every moment, and characters that deeply tap into your emotions, this is one of the best thrillers in recent years. Tom Hanks delivers a heart-wrenching performance, and you feel for him in every scene. Rated PG-13 for intense sequences and some violence, ""Captain Phillips"" is a superb film that deserves all the Oscar buzz it's getting.",1392163200,,1071,4.8469945355191255
6065968,5,B00G7M190U,We liked it!  Held our interest.  Was not the same story you see very often.  Real life took a turn you wouldnt expect.  Tom Hanks acting was great ... especially at the end when you would least expect.  Held our attention throughout!,1392163200,,234,4.476190476190476
6065969,5,B00G7M190U,"Sure wish that this was not a true story because I can only imagine how terrifying it would be in real life. However, this was a really well-made movie. Tom Hanks was incredible, as always.",1392163200,,189,4.428571428571429
6065980,2,B00G7M190U,"Because this ship and others couldn't institute the simple policy to arm their crew to properly protect themselves from small, rag tag bands of pirates like these, we the taxpayers footed the bill (probably in the millions) to rescue Captain Phillips. Something is *very* wrong with this picture.  As for the movie itself, I'm puzzled why Tom Hanks would get a best actor nomination. He was good but really, best actor of all the movies released in 2013? Maybe not. The movie was borderline boring and character development seemed a little shallow too. Glad I got it for free from Redbox.",1392163200,2,588,4.821782178217822
6065981,5,B00G7M190U,"I enjoyed this movie very much. It moved right along, it was engaging and entertaining, and even more amazing: it's based on a true story.  It did look like the director tried to create some sympathy for the economic plight of the hijackers, but even so I still left the movie feeling utter disgust and contempt for the kidnapper/hijackers. Tom Hanks did a wonderful job, as always.",1392163200,,382,4.701492537313433
6065982,5,B00G7M190U,Movie was very poignant and left us thinking about life and the suffering and injustice being faced by people in Africa that they have to resort to this.

6066003,5,B00G7M190U,"Lets face it, Tom Hanks can make nearly anything work in a movie, even what would be considered something tragic but mundane such as this story.

That the lead bad guy (actor Barkhad Abdi) is up of an Academy Award seems to reflect what the movie/story actually rises to.

Put a few pirates into an enclosed fiberglass lifeboat with Hanks (as Captain Phillips) attempting to survive while being sort of in the dark, and that is the premise of the true storyline. Oh, and then the calvary comes in the guise of the whole might of the US Navy. No wonder the lead bad guy finds a way off of that lifeboat without getting killed in the process.

Perhaps that is why he is up for the award?",1392163200,,685,4.3359375

6066009,4,B00G7M190U,"Loved Captain Phillips and Tom Hanks too. This film was intriguing enough to watch twice.
However, I felt as though vital parts of the story was missing and maybe it ended a bit too soon. I would have hoped to see a resolve between the Captured Somalian Pirate and Captain Phillips and to see if the Somalian (Captured Pirate) would make it to trial.

6066026,5,B00G7M190U,"A beautifuly made story of survival.  I knew the ending, and a little bit about the story, but that did not stop the intensity.  The writer and director have crafted a story that humanizes the pirates and makes them three-dimensional people, but does not make excuses for their actions.  They are desperate, but not in a way that justifies their actions.",1392076800,,354,4.770491803278689

6066029,5,B00G7M190U,"First and formost this is a true story and the fear level is razor sharp for all involved from almost the first minute. Tom Hanks masterful acting makes you feel every emotion he feels, traveling the sea, expecting a regular day in his life, but instead staring his death and to him more importantly his crews, in the face, literally eye to eye. You fear the pirates, with their panicky yelling and quick impulsive decisions that lead events forward, however at times you see the humans behind the bully. Yes, it is very much a film worth watching.",1392076800,,548,4.6020408163265305

6066049,4,B00G7M190U,I enjoyed this movie - as usual Tom Hanks is fantastic. Unfortunately we read accounts of the Alabama crew before watching the movie. It's pretty clear the movie was not based in the events that actually took place - not according to the crew.,1391990400,,243,4.545454545454546

6066075,5,B00G7M190U,"Both my husband and I appreciated all the back story for the pirates.  They were wrong in what they did, clearly.  Over and over again, wrong.  Being more courageous, they could have left their tribe.  We agreed that in so many ways they were trapped and ""excelled"" at what their tribal leaders demanded of them.  It was a great story, well told.",1391990400,,346,4.516129032258065

6066079,5,B00G7M190U,"To be honest, I found myself in a category many of my peers fell into with this film: ""not interested"".  I love a good thriller but Tom Hanks at sea just didn't capture my interest.  Maybe it was the lackluster preview I saw late last year, or the fact that I'm not a huge fan of sea movies, but the description didn't interest me in the least.  It wasn't until it was out on Amazon instant that my wife and I decided to give it a shot and we ended up loving it!  We started the first 20 minutes and couldn't stop watching.  The dynamic between Tom Hanks and the pirate captain is brilliant and captivating, and frighteningly realistic.  There were times that Tom Hanks seems genuinely afraid, and that fear translates seamlessly to the viewer.  To all of you who were like me and had no interest in seeing a film about Tom Hanks at sea, trust me on this one and try it, I promise you won't be let down.

For fans of Apollo 13 and Black Hawk Down.",1391990400,,947,4.193370165745856

6066092,3,B00G7M190U,"I wanted to like this more, but it just didn't live up to my expectations.  There were several things in the movie that were obviously added for ""suspense"" that didn't work for me.  I almost wish I hadn't seen a program on the real events, I might not have noticed some of the liberties taken with the storyline. The ""suspense"" scenes didn't have me on the edge of my seat. The Navy scenes didn't have me waving my flag (even though the real-life events were nothing short of amazing).
Either way, I think 3 starts is fair.  It's entertaining enough for an evening on the couch but there are much better movies out there.",1391990400,,621,4.4298245614035086

A nice, tidy TV Movie to waste an evening to. It should have been produced for television but Mr. Hanks can fill movie seats. I feel bad for the folks who plunked down real green to see it at the movies.

6066123,4,B00G7M190U,"story line can be viewed as true event turned onto a film, with more or less predictable ending for some viewers.  the performance by the hero is what makes this action movie stand out as no heros or leaders can hide their innermost human breaking point; since what appears to be one's unshakable self-control or one's expectation of the worst can be pushed to limits; and this movie does a partially good job in showing it. Highly recommended to all viewers.  The so-called ""predictablity"" (in my view) of the ending costs one star from a perfect 5",1391990400,,549,4.649484536082475

6066227,5,B00G7M190U,Had me white knuckled the whole last 40 minutes. Inspiring effort by Navy Seals and a brave captain. The Somalians chosen for the pirates were very good actors as well.,1391990400,,168,4.633333333333334
6066228,4,B00G7M190U,"Really action packed, Tom Hanks is great as usual, the movie really holds your attention. It really breaks down the life of these pirates and humanizes them to some extent.",1391904000,,172,4.766666666666667

It has suspense and drama but it also has a realistic presentation of the plight of some Somalians who are forced, with the threat of death, into piracy.

6066271,5,B00G7M190U,"I don't know the details of what really happened, but this was a very good movie all by itself.  It was very intense and felt very realistic.  I really liked the fact that the pirates were very human characters, definitely ""bad men"", but also naive and inexperienced children at the same time.  In other words real people with all the complexities that come with that.  Tom Hanks did his usual excellent job of portraying his character with nuance and believability.  The actors that portrayed the pirates also turned in great performances as did the military men and women sent to deal with the situation. Several days after watching this movie I kep finding myself thinking about it in terms of the real-life situation, not as just a movie.

6066277,5,B00G7M190U,"This film exemplifies why Tom Hanks is at the top tier of screen acting in this country.  Instinctively he knows how to play the characters he's portraying and dials up the requisite temperament.  Here he is required to be cool and collected as not to upset his machine gun wielding captors.  Fans of action films demand their heroes have a little Arnold Schwarzenegger in them but realistically the approach that Hanks' Captain Richard Phillips takes is the correct one.  This calm veneer belies a man who is emotionally breaking down but for the sake of the crew of his container ship Phillips must maintain the brave face.  Hanks is equaled by his adversary, Muse, played expertly by Barkhad Abdi in his first feature film.  The emaciated Somali pirate is all bravado and jutting bones but unknown to his captives he only engaged in this act of barbarism to appease his tribal elders.  Knowing this you gain a sense of empathy for this ragtag horde of high seas raiders and you sense that Phillips shares this feeling.  In this crisply photographed and edited film director Paul Greengrass gives you a sense of being present at these events and there are any number of heart-in-the-mouth moments on display.  ""Captain Phillips"" is a great film because it is a very humanistic one.",1391904000,,1283,4.821917808219178
6066278,5,B00G7M190U,Played this perfectly.  Utterly believable.  Have seen all the Oscar performances.  Hanks has a gift for getting it right.  Able to convey the extraordinary in the ordinary.,1391904000,,173,5.296296296296297
6066279,5,B00G7M190U,"Wow, truly scary.  I mean, there is a reason that the crew is paid well for the voyage. But when push comes to shove, Captain Phillips had the character and courage to protect his crew by sacrificing himself.  Tom Hanks made you feel his fears, his compassion and his impending death....wow!",1391904000,,291,4.686274509803922

6066291,2,B00G7M190U,"Other reviewers are right: the camera work gets mighty jerky at time. I think this tends more towards Hollywood's version of political correctness (depict the Somailians as human beings with their own set of troubles) rather than any genuinely authentic attempt to make the plight of Somailians clear and understandable to viewers. It smacked a little bit of a ""white man's burden"" kind of perspective that made me feel particularly uncomfortable.

 I didn't even watch it to the end.",1391904000,4,484,5.113924050632911

The pirates were were believeably desparate and frightening.  How quickly humanity can give way in the face of desparation.  Just the scene of the big ship at sea let's you know what vulnerablity is.  Watch.  Put the phone away.  Skip facebook.  Let Mr Hanks take on a boat ride.",1391731200,,580,4.633663366336633

6066390,5,B00G7M190U,"**SPOILER ALERT**

I loved this film and was blown away by Hanks' performance.  As others have mentioned, the last 20 or so minutes of this movie contained some of the best acting I have seen in any film.

A couple of things I wanted to mention since others (many others!) have given plot summaries and have broken down the many reasons why this is such an excellent film.  First, there are a handful of reviewers who claim this movie isn't accurate because some members of the crew have made some allegations in a lawsuit relating to Captain Phillips possible putting the ship in danger in the first place by not heeding piracy warnings and such.  That may or may not be true and the real Captain Phillips may or may not have been the nice guy on the ship as portrayed by Hanks.  But the people complaining are conveniently not commenting on:

1.  It is a fact the ship was boarded by pirates.
2.  It is a fact none of the crew were taken hostage in the life boat
3.  It is a fact Captain Phillips WAS taken hostage in the life boat
4.  It is a fact that Captain Phillips was in significant mortal danger
5.  It is a fact the US Navy and Navy Seals were mobilized and pulled off a very high-risk, dangerous rescue

In other words (and to quote Kevin Bacon in ""A Few Good Men"") ""...these are the facts and they are undisputed.""

So even if the real Captain Phillips was not quite the same guy in terms of his actions before the pirates boarded the ship (a point made in a lawsuit which by no means makes it true, by the way) there is no denying the human drama which played out in the life boat.

Lastly, for all the heat the US military gets, one (of several) take-aways I got from this movie is just how highly trained and just flat-out awesome a force it can be.  While I suppose the nay-sayers will also say that none of the rescue happened the way it was portrayed in the film, I haven't heard one single credible source argue that point.

This film certainly doesn't need me to defend it but I felt like doing it anyway.  Incredible movie, supurbly acted and well worth seeing.",1391644800,,2083,4.297435897435897
6066391,5,B00G7M190U,"The very end scene with Tom Hanks is worth seeing alone! The entire movie could have sucked (which it didn't) and the end scene would have saved it!. I honestly didn't think it was going to be this good. All the actors were good, believable, not overly dramatic and the military response was unique was amazing! SEE THIS MOVIE!!!!",1391644800,,330,4.610169491525424
6066392,4,B00G7M190U,"Well paced yet deeper  than just a ""bad guys shoot 'em up"" story.  You get a glimps  into the chaos in that part of the world that drives ""fishermen"" into piracy.  Also opens up debates about to wisdom (or not) of providing merchant vessels defensive weapons to deter such things.
There may be debatable points on what went wrong and where things should have been approached differently.  But, frankly, this film shows the reality of how events take on their own reality that no armchair quarterbacking could affect.  The heroism of the captain and crew and the professionalism of the military responders is well told.  Finally, Hank's portrayal of the Captain's emotional turmoil following his recovery from the clutches of the pirate crew is suburb!",1391644800,2,751,4.96

6066431,3,B00G7M190U,"This was a relatively good movie compared to all the other trash being produced by Hollywood. The only issue I had was not due to the movie but liberal maritime law since the Somali pirate captain was not executed immediately but sent to prison for 33 years. If society really wants this stuff to stop then death by hanging should be the penalty for every act of piracy. One other thing that did not make sense in the movie. If the areas traveled by commercial ships are known to be inhabited by pirates, why were crew members unarmed to repel such attacks? They sprayed water at the pirates as the pirates were shooting AK-47s at the ship. Does not make sense but either does liberal thinking.",1391644800,,694,4.515873015873016

I don't know what liberties Hollywood took to make the movie exciting, but I think there is plenty to be inspired by in this movie, and plenty to lament. The movie reminded me that in a global world, our lives are all connected, and the despair and hopelessness of those living in a failed state far away can not always be so easily disregarded and ignored.",1391558400,,562,4.466019417475728

This is a fast moving action packed film, high in tension, keeping the viewer glued to the screen. As far as all the criticism of how Philipps wound up in the situation, they show early on in the film that he did receive warning that there were pirates in the waters and it does show that he was far too away from the convoy of cargo ships that stayed further out at sea. At the end of the day this captain saved his crew and sacrificed himself as hostage. That should be worth something shouldn't it?",1391472000,,605,4.315789473684211

I chose this movie because, I read part of this story in the book written by Navy SEAL Team Six member Mark Owen, No Easy Day, regarding the killing of Osama Bin Laden. In his discussions of SEAL training and what they can do, he told of this daring rescue of Captain Phillips, played by Tom Hanks. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars, was because it kind of went on too long in the scene where Phillips and the pirates were in the life boat. It lasted forever. Otherwise, it would be a 5 star rated movie. I think you'll enjoy it. After watching this, it did leave me with one big question. Why in the world are these ships unarmed when they know they will be entering pirate infested areas? It must be due to civilian ships traveling in international waters. Otherwise, hire you some private contractors, like Blackwater USA. Four of their ex-SEALs could have repelled all the pirates and prevented the entire fiasco.",1391472000,,1054,4.552631578947368

6066593,1,B00G7M190U,"This is a movie with cardboard characters in an incredulous plot. While this movie is based on real events taking place in 2009, it is pure Hollywood. It is presented in the most simple manner possible  Good against Evil. Therefore the story line presents the events as the story of the piracy of an American freighter captain portrayed by Tom Hanks (Good) overtaken by a group of Somali Pirates (Evil) led by supporting actor Barkhad Abdi. And like all simplistic over-generalized stories, Hanks is saved by intervention of the U.S. Navy Seals (Very  Good).

There are the usual Hollywood stereotypes thrown in for good measure:

  There is Najee, the main villain, Evil incarnate, worse than his boss.

  There is Elmi, the nervous teenager, who constantly wants to go back to land and befriends Hanks as much as possible.

  Then there is the Calvary to the rescue, featured in this film as the US Navy and Navy Seals.

The Seals come in to save the day. They kill the Somali pirates and arrest the leader, who is now sitting in federal prison.

The fact that this was the general course of events in the real incident is merely incidental. If this all sounds like thousands of Westerns weve all seen, you're right. Instead of taking place in the wide West, it is in international waters off the Somali coast. There is no real suspense in the outcome, in part because we all know from recent events the outcome, but also because it is like a modern Western, a simple story with a happy ending.

Reality is not so very simple. The subtext lurking behind the action is the desperate poverty existing in Somalia, which is touched upon ever so briefly early in the movie. This is not an excuse for piracy, but explains the desperation that drives these young people to rob. The producers want to tell a simple story in a simple way, and in this they have succeeded. The sheer number of five-star ratings for this movie is testament to the general publics desire for an uncomplicated story, sparing the uncomfortable details, with a happy ending.

Reality is also complicated. In real life, the crew members of the Maersk are suing Captain Phillips for negligence in federal court. Quoting directly from this complaint, which is readily available for review online, Captain Phillips:

 1. failed to heed official warnings regarding the presence of pirates in waters where the vessel sailed;

 2. failed to take evasive action to avoid the area where pirates were present and known to be actively attaching vessels and taking merchant vessels and their crews hostage;

 3. Intentionally sailed into waters where pirates were present and knowingly placed his crew in harms way;

 4. Intentionally and knowingly placed his crew in harms way for reasons of financial gain;

 5. Failed to provide a safe place in which to work;

 6. Failed to provide appropriate levels of security to protect the other members of the crew;

 7. Failed to establish appropriate policy and failed to promulgate and enforce reasonable rules and regulations for the performance of the work on the vessel in such a manner to provide for the safety of His crew and other members of the officers and crew in the performance of their duties;

 8. Failed to adequately inspect and insure the proper operation of the vessel, its appurtenances and equipment so as to eliminate the risk of injuries to their employees;

 9. Failed to provide the his crew with the proper training, assistance, manning, security, tools, and equipment for the performance of the work which he was obliged to do at the aforesaid time and place;

 10. Failed to adequately warn the his crew of the dangerous, unsafe and unseaworthy condition;

 11. Failed to provide a competent crew for the vessel;

 12. Failed to provide adequate and safe equipment and vessel appurtenances.

6066611,3,B00G7M190U,"The question I kept asking myself as I was watching the movie and have continued to ask since seeing the movie is ""Why did this need to be a movie?"" My wife says it's because we need to have movies each year that feature the American military as the good guys, but I'm just not quite buying it. I mean, that's probably true, but it just doesn't do it for me.

Yes, there will be spoilers. Not like everyone doesn't already know how this turns out.

There are a few interesting parts in the movie, but they're not enough to give the movie any real depth. For instance, the movie opens with a scene of Phillips readying himself for his trip. [It's actually the kind of thing I routinely tell my creative writing class not to do: Do not give us your character waking up in the morning, brushing his teeth and eating breakfast. We don't care. Unless there actually is some relevance to the story. Not that that is what see with Phillips, but it's the same kind of thing, but it does have a point.] It's completely normal and middle class, him going off to the airport. I have to say, though, that the dialogue between Phillips and his wife is terrible. It switches, then, to the character of Muse and how his day starts. It serves to show us how very different these two characters are and, yet, how they are similar. So, yeah, that was interesting, but that's the first 10 minutes or so and nothing's that interesting the rest of the movie.

The whole movie can be boiled down to one conversation between Phillips and Muse:
Phillips: There has to be something more than fishing and kidnapping people.
Muse: Maybe in America. Maybe in America.

I think that moment is so short that it gets lost in the rest of the movie. And the movie does nothing to support it, since it focuses on Phillips and not what drove the pirates to do what they do.

The thing I was most struck with, though, is not something I think I was meant to think about:
The pirates were trying to ransom Phillips for $10 million. In response, we mounted a huge Naval engagement which included airdropping in a bunch of SEALs and an aircraft carrier. The recovery mission took days. I'm sure the cost of the rescue mission dwarfed the 10 million the pirates wanted. I'm not saying we should have paid them off, because I don't that at all. I do think there has to be a better way, though. [And because I was curious, the cost to operate an aircraft carrier per day is $7 million! And it was one of only three Navy ships involved in the mission. The mission which lasted several days. So, yeah, we spent WAY more than $10 million to get Phillips back.]

As for the acting, I was unimpressed. Hanks showed up and was appropriately stoic through most of the film. The only real acting he did was at the very end after he was rescued, at which point he has a complete meltdown. That scene with him was great, but the rest of the movie was pretty flat. His acting, all the acting, the whole movie. Let's just say that, overall, I was particularly underwhelmed. It was kind of like watching the ""high speed"" chase of O.J. Simpson on TV a couple of decades ago. Oh, except for the brief moment where I thought the movie was about to become Home Alone as the crew did things like spread broken glass on the floor for the barefoot pirates to step on. But that didn't last long enough to be engaging.

Basically, the movie gets a ""meh"" from me. It wasn't stupid (which, you know, would have been pretty bad considering it's based on true events), but it also just didn't do anything for me. I never cared about any of the people involved except for brief moments for the ""pirate"" kid that stepped on the glass; he was only 15-ish. But, then, Muse was only 16-ish (which never comes out in the movie. If they'd highlighted that, there may have been some emotional investment, but, then, it might have been invested in the ""bad"" guys). This just isn't an Oscar caliber movie. It's better than The Wolf of Wall Street but not by much. It is, however, politically correct, I would suppose.",1391385600,4,4039,4.406166219839142

I was surprised by the impact it had from the first frames.  Great actors with a very 'real' feel to it.  The actors who played the Somali pirates were almost too realistic.  Great movie.,1391385600,,322,4.389830508474576

6066659,5,B00G7M190U,"I'm glad we saw this movie.  It was fast paced and well acted.  The directing was terrific, as Paul Greengrass filmed it at sea and worked hard to make it authentic.  Their was some sympathy in the portrayal of the Somali pirates as village guys who had little choice but to follow this way of living.  Only one was portrayed as a really brutal.  However the movie got a bit too patriotic towards the end, which took away from that portrayal of these guys as more than villainous.  I heard that audiences cheered at the brutal ending, which made me very uncomfortable, particularly as it was made clear that at least one, if not more, of these guys was just a teenage boy.  I'm not sure how else they could have ended it, except that the director did add one more scene at the end which was well done.  It's a movie worth seeing and I understand the nominations for acting and directing.",1391385600,,887,4.398773006134969

6066691,5,B00G7M190U,"To me, a movie always has an advantage if it is not only an interesting story but is
about a real-life incident.  This is both.  Before watching it I already knew the
general outline of the events, having remembered it from the news when it happened.
This tells the story IN DETAIL.  One gets a better understanding of those ""bad guys"",
the Somali pirates, as well as of how shipping operates today.  I can't believe Captain
Phillips continued on with his career captaining cargo ships after this event, but he
did!  A bonus of the movie on Blu-Ray: some actual interviews with the real Captain
Phillips recollecting what he thought and how he felt at different points of this episode.

He seemed to make his role very real, other than is Vermont accent, i am from the east coast, it sounded like a Maine imitation that didn't quite work, but hey  the director created a level of intensity that they managed to maintain throughout the film.

The way the events play out in the film is not completely in line with the reporting at the time (which reporting was not so favorable to the White House, and somewhat foreshadowed Libya).  No way to know if the contemporaneous reporting was wrong and the film right, or if they tweaked the story in the film for political (or other) reasons.  And it is, after all, about Phillips and the Navy, not politics, although in the times we live everything seems to get political.  Either way, I highly recommend it.

6066825,5,B00G7M190U,To say Tom Hanks' performance was amazing seems trite...since ALL his performances seem to be so. I'd really like to say that the supporting performances were even more amazing as they clearly came from a place that was very real instead of an acting studio.  Well worth the time and attention.,1391299200,,294,4.764705882352941

6066828,4,B00G7M190U,"It's Tom Hanks versus a gang of gun-toting Somalians in Captain Phillips, a movie based on the Maersk Alabama hijacking of 2009. The pirates are ugly and annoying, but director Paul Greengrass does a notable job of keeping his audience on its toes. The level of suspense rises at eighteen minutes in and never really lets up from there, though the plot takes a major turn near the halfway point. The real-life Richard Phillips, portrayed here as somewhat of a hero, wrote a book about the incident a year after it happened, but the true story probably isn't nearly as epic as this.

6066889,4,B00G7M190U,This movie was pretty good although I wish when they make a movie from a true story that they would stick to the facts from the book. You can see 2 shows about this movie on Netflix. One is the true actual version from Captain Phillips and another one from the Navy Seals. It is amazing how these Samoli's will go after these huge ships and then be able to board them. Why don't these big ships carry guns of some sort? And the way the Navy Seals came in and everything is sychronized(sp) right down to the last minute in finishing their mission. Hats off to our Navy( and other branches of service) and the Navy Seals.

6066941,5,B00G7M190U,"The four actors who played the pirates were talented and believable. In roles representative of criminal and evil conduct, they were able to show their characters' human side in parts of the movie, for good or for bad. And Captain Phillips is perhaps one of Tom Hanks' best at slipping into the physical and emotional embodiment of his character since Cast Away. Particularly at the end of this movie, you'll see Hanks at his best -- very believable and may cause your throat to slightly tighten. As for the pace and tone of the movie: My heart rate stayed elevated the entire time. Highly recommended.",1391212800,,602,4.742857142857143

Hanks is great - they do a wonderful job of trying to make you have sympathy for the pirates, then Capt Philips realizes, these are just plain bad men. I've seen people comment on the improbability of 4 guys in a skiff taking over a huge ship.  I agree, it's unlikely, but it happened.  So there's that.

6066957,4,B00G7M190U,A very realistic and entertaining story about the Somali Pirates attacks on shipping off the coast of Somalia.

6066959,1,B00G7M190U,As other reviewers have said the story is not true to the events that actually took place. Not a bad movie on its own but it profits too much from the relationship to the current events not to have some obligation to the truth. It is unfortunate that the writers did not appreciate that the actual events were easily more interesting then the story they told. The way this movie is presented makes one wonder how many people after viewing would believe that it is  fairly accurate. It seems to be a trend in Hollywood to take a true story and change it to suit some concept of thematic cohesiveness or more likely a product of test marketing and perceived profitability. For more obscure true stories loosely basing on facts might work better but this was a fairly important international incident.  I wanted to like this movie but could not accept the arbitrary enormous diversions from facts for no apparent reason.,1391212800,7,917,4.6894409937888195

6066963,5,B00G7M190U,I enjoyed the movie because it was full of suspense and it was exciting. I liked that Tom Hanks was the only star in the movie.  The actor portraying the lead pirate in the movie was excellent.  His portrayal of the pirate and the issues surrounding it made you take a look inside his Somali world.  This was an amazing story and it enlightened me on the true dangers in international waters and threats they pose to the shipping industry.  I would highly recommend this movie.,1391212800,,477,4.511627906976744

6066965,5,B00G7M190U,I really like Tom Hanks. It was amazing to see the 3 shots fired simultaneously on the ocean. I can't imagine the real thing. Seeing the movie makes me proud of our navy seals. Tom did not have the variety of scenery backgrounds to show his talent but he did a great job. The movie made me wonder what really went on and what all we the public don't know.,1391212800,,355,4.085714285714285
6066966,5,B00G7M190U,Tom Hanks did a wonderful job of not overacting and playing the role of Captain Phillips.  The Somalis were also well cast.  I read the person who played Muse had no training and had never played a role before.  The emotions came through well and draw the viewers into the drama.,1391212800,,279,4.431372549019608

6066968,4,B00G7M190U,"Enjoyed watching this movie.  Acting was real good. Good story too.  A little strange that no Navy forces or helicopters were available to help the captain over the first 18 hours he was being attacked by pirates, but after they got him three massive navy ships showed up with helicopters, plus troops were air dropped in....but I guess it was based on actual events.",1391212800,,367,4.71875
6066969,5,B00G7M190U,"When this incident happened, I knew a movie would be made as well it should.  The actors that play the parts are outstanding. The crew  and captain on the ship sense immediate danger, and the Captain knows he is in charge of trying to save his crew and ship.  The pirates are as realistic in their acting as ever I have seen.  Tom Hanks ishould have been nominated and by the way  the language is pg something I admire .",1391212800,,420,4.2
6066980,5,B00G7M190U,"This was a movie about a very real incident, the hijacking and kidnapping of cargo ships by samolli pirates. I think the movie caught the real fear and emotions of the captain and crew. It must have been horrific. I think the portrayal of captain Phillips was good. Not a superhero type like indianna Jones, but a man who acted courageously to save his crew. Very good movie.",1391212800,,375,4.529411764705882

6067002,4,B00G7M190U,"Many have praised this film for the action and realism. . .and that is true (even though some have argued there are some major differences between fact and fiction). That isn't what makes this movie great though; what makes this film stand out is the acting, namely by Tom Hanks. He plays Rich Phillips, and he is very believable and credible. Isn't Hanks always? The end of the movie is what really sold me on Hank's performance here. He perfectly captures a man in shock, a man who is barely holding it together, a man about to become unhinged. It was almost like watching a documentary. . .Hanks always delivers. He has a great supporting cast, but for me, this was Castaway-ish: this movie was mostly a vehicle for Hanks' acting chops.",1391126400,2,739,4.606060606060606

6067008,5,B00G7M190U,Break out performance for the unknown limo driver Barkhad Abdi - now an academy award nominee. Tom Hanks is outstanding. Such a contrast to his portrayal of Walt Disney in the film Saving Mr. Banks. The framing of shots in the film contrast the expanse of the sea against the confinement of captivity. It is hard to suppress feelings of patriotism when the Navy arrives in full force. Compelling to the end.,1391126400,,407,4.666666666666667

6067026,1,B00G7M190U,"As a stand alone entertainment movie, Captain Phillips is great.  Five stars all around.  However.... this movie is supposed to be based on events in and around 2009 and for that it's terrible.  Just Google ""Captain Phillips The Real Story"" and you'll see what I mean.  The screenplay was adapted from the Phillips' book as he recalls the hijacking of his vessel.  But Phillips omitted many truths of that week and he lied about others.  And Sony Pictures will have you believe that this movie is true.  Sony went so far to hide the truth that they paid some (but not all) of the 20 crew members with Phillips $5000.00 and had them sign non-disclosure agreements stating they they could not divulge the truth.  Other crew members refused to make the deal with the Devil and have since launch a lawsuit against the shipping line and Phillips.  When the hijacking had ended and Phillips was safely back home, the crew swore that they would not disclose the truth about Phillip's conduct for it truly painted him in an unfavourable light.  However, once Phillips' book came out and he played up the ""hero"" card in the media, the crew was disgusted with actions and decided to right a dreadful wrong.  For you see, Phillips as an employee of the shipping line ignored six emails send to him instructing him to keep his vessel 600 nm away from the Somali coast.  When the Maersk Alabama was raided by the pirates, the ship was 234 nm east of the coastline.  He therefore put himself and his crew in harms way.  Phillips excuse was it didn't matter how far the ship was away from the Somali coast, they were going to get boarded anyways.  Not true.  600 nm would have been beyond the range of the pirate's motherships.  Phillips also never offered up himself to the pirates to save his crew.  The movie shows Phillips conducting a security drill when the hijackers attempted their first attack.  However, the drill in question was a fire drill and it was during this exercise that the Somali skiffs first appeared.  The Mate suggested that they end the drill and prepare the ship, however Phillips ordered the crew to complete the drill.  Poor judgement on his part.  The crew claims that the real hero was the Chief Officer.  Some of his heroics were vented in the movie, but not enough to overshadow the fictional movie character as portrayed by Tom Hanks.  Phillips as described by his crew is a self-centred, egotistical, arrogant person prone to poor judgements.  Not the type of character that you would wish to showcase in a movie and certainly not how Phillips wants to be seen as, especially after he wrote his book and has accepted all of the media's kudos for the hero that they paint him out to be.  Once again Hollywood takes a good story and distorts the truth all for the sake of turning a buck.  No consideration is given as to how the public will eventually be misled to believe the Big Screen version and fail to understand the truth.",1391126400,60,2946,4.604606525911708
6067027,5,B00G7M190U,Tom Hanks was awesome in this movie. The movie was fantastic. Great portrayal of a true story. Would highly recommend,1391126400,,117,4.9

6067029,5,B00G7M190U,"I chose this rating because the movie was realistic and exciting. It kept you on the edge of your seat. The squalid living conditions and threats from their bosses explained the desperate efforts of the Somali pirates. Their portrayal was at times sympathetic but still misguided. But it was all they knew or were told. Their plight made them especially dangerous. Tom Hanks was outstanding as Captain Phillips, not a superhero, but just an average person caught up in a horrible situation.  The film was a true story so it really resonated with me. It showed that everyday people can become heroes when they are compelled to do so. It didn't hurt that the US Navy was able to come to his rescue, but the outcome was not certain and the suspense was excruciating.",1391126400,,763,4.6940298507462686

6067034,5,B00G7M190U,I thought this would be interesting as I had just seen Tom Hanks in SAVING MR.BANKS.  This role was completely different but Hanks really pulled it off and kept me on the seat of the chair throughout.

When I said as much on facebook two people stated they had to take a zanix while watching the movie. I admit to a racing heart myself, all this even though you know the outcome.

It's exciting - well acted, well directed. Yes Hollywood changed the facts a bit but this is par.

In case you missed the real life action as it unfolded back in 2009 Captain Phillips is the telling of the hijacking of the U.S. container ship Maersk Alabama by a crew of Somali pirates. Once again you see how the War Lords dominate the poor and send them to do the dirty work while they reap the benefits. You sort of feel bad for the drugged up pirate while cheering for ""team America"" to blow them out of the water. Nice to see the home team win one :)

I really liked this movie and I'll watch it again.",1391126400,,886,4.080459770114943

Where did the Seal snipers come from?  How did they rescue Captain Philips.  I thought they fired from the cargo ship, but the US Navy sent a destroyer, small aircraft carrier and another vessel.  About 80 Seals boarded the four ships.  I knew how this turned out, but the suspense of the unfolding events kept me on the edge of my seat.

The feel of the film seems real from start to end.  Hollywood didn't need to spice it up with anything more than what happened; the reality of what happened was scary, tension-filled, compelling, and nail biting enough.  I heard an brief interview with the real Captain Phillips ( btw, Hanks' vocal impersonation of him is very good), in which he said the movie - from what he experienced - was true enough to his experience.  He seems to be an amazingly humble man given what he experienced and what he did to survive to save his crew and ultimately himself thx to his extraordinary wits and sound judgement.

In short, see the movie; it will not disappoint.",1391126400,,792,4.628571428571429

The movie promotes itself as a true story based upon an actual event and the only thing that has taken away from it is the controversy and law suit which clouds whether or not we can believe the character.

He does whatever he can to save the lives of his crew and ultimately his own while waiting for help. Hanks if really good in this movie and it's mind boggling that he didn't receive an Oscar nomination as best actor. Maybe it's time to nominate the best actors without setting a limit of nominees because it's a shame that Leonardo DiCaprio's nomination looks like it's at the expense of Hanks. It's just a nomination, not the win. So what if a few people have to consider 1 or 2 extra nominees; or even 1 or 2 less if no one is deserving.

The acting in general is very good (and, of course, Hanks is excellent) and the story is engaging from beginning to end. There's just the right amount of tension caused by the dialogue and the acting - not by over-the-top special effects - and that makes the movie credible and even more enjoyable.

6067099,5,B00G7M190U,Tom Hanks has always been my favorite comedian/actor. He is like fine wine to taste when it is aged appropriate. The character he played put you in his shoes and perceive what it would be like when your held hostage against your will. The outcome of this movie was very emotional at a different level. I will watch this film many times in the future. Thank you amazon for providing service at your best.,1391040000,,403,4.45945945945946

I thought Tom Hanks, as usual, did an outstanding job and it was easy to become immersed in the movie.  One could almost feel the tossing of the lifeboat and feel what a shock it must have been to open the hatch and see 3 US Navy warships that weren't there the last time you looked.

Phillips but long before this tragedy befell him, my late daughter, Kathy Shaner, was  Chief Steward, one one of the Maersk ships  of which Captain Phillips was in charge.
Although she sailed with him on only one 4-month trip, she considered him the best ""Skipper"" she ever served during her ten-year career as a Merchant Seaman.
I have enormous admiration for Captain Phillips who not only endured unthinkable cruelty, but had the courage to return  to

The film starts out well, and builds Tom Hanks' character, as well as the pirates up quite nicely.  It does a great job at building suspense up to about two thirds of the way into the film.  As the climax nears it feels like the building action flat lines, perhaps they pushed too hard too fast. However, it ends in spectacular fashion.",1391040000,,453,4.433734939759036

6067173,3,B00G7M190U,"Both leading actors were very believable. The story based on fact, probably with some Hollywood license, is a sad one. Desperate people do desperate things.

But it is incredulous they these men could not fight off these scrawny, horrible Somalis, one of whom didn't even have shoes! Is this what America has come to? I see a parallel...can't have guns!

6067196,5,B00G7M190U,"I thought it was a fantastic movie, however the real Captain Phillips' crew is suing because they claim this is not how it really went down. In the movie, Captain Phillips is taking precautionary measures, such as performing safety drills, and is rather heroic in putting the safety and well-being of his crew ahead of that of himself. The non-fiction crew claims that he took unnecessary risks, almost as if he wanted the pirates to attack, and they say he needlessly put them in harm's way.

Tom Hanks' Captain Phillips is all business, and he is at his best in this role. The suspense builds as the freighter travels through waters that Captain Phillips learns from his emails, have been experiencing many pirate attacks, so many in fact, that his ship has a 50% chance of being attacked. In the movie, the ship is six hundred miles from the shores of Somalia, but in reality, his crew says they were a mere 240 miles from the coast.

I would recommend this movie to friends and family.,1391040000,,328,4.306451612903226
6067252,2,B00G7M190U,"I personally won't watch it again.

As far as I'm concerned, it seems to be a detailed and factual retelling of a real event.  The director does a good job of keeping you in suspense the entire time and compresses the full event into approximately two hours.

I thought the film tension became tedious mainly because I knew the outcome:  SEAL team shoots 3 pirates dead and Capt. Phillips, played by Tom Hanks, goes free. I thought that watching this movie would help me gain insight into the event that, for example, would be more compelling than the real news reports and cable TV documentaries produced about this over the last few years since.

The acting was good.  The actors who played the pirates/fishermen were equally as good. But I didn't care about that and as I mentioned, the film became tedious.  It took me two days and three viewings to finish this movie.  It was one of those movies that I felt compelled to finish because I spent $4.99 for the rental.",1391040000,,970,4.566473988439307

6067256,4,B00G7M190U,As soon as Captain Phillips steps onto his ship he seems on alert that something will happen.  When he orders a drill to simulate a pirate attack the crew seems reluctant until it turns into a real pirate situation.  Knowing that this is based on a true event makes it even more intriguing.,1390953600,,290,4.452830188679245

6067258,5,B00G7M190U,"I couldn't wait to see this movie after all the hype but WOW what a job Tom Hanks and the 'bad guy' (sorry I forgot his name) did. Hanks was spectacular-more than spectacular. I felt his pain, I felt his fear, I felt every emotion he depicted in this movie. This big boat or vessel taken over by a few skinny pirates was a little weird since there were so many men on the boat that could have taken them but 'hey' this is a true to life movie so I guess there's some things that weren't depicted in this version. Never the less Hanks fear; his whole performance should win an OSCAR and every other award in the business. The plot is simple-boat taken over, captain terrified but at some point has all his men hide in the lower deck where they can't be found so he alone is dealing with these pirates.
WATCH THIS MOVIE. I GUARANTEE YOU WILL BE GLAD YOU DID!!!!!!!!!",1390953600,,864,4.242424242424242

I assured my husband the movie was going to be good and I went and did something else in a different room. I came back when all was quiet and I managed to see the rescue of Captain Phillips.

6067275,5,B00G7M190U,"Tom Hanks stars as Captain Phillips, the skipper of a merchant marine cargo ship assigned to move a ship around the Horn of Africa, through the Somali basin, when it is attacked by Somali pirates.  After the US Navy shows up, complete with marksman seals, the pirates abandon their plans to hold the crew and hostage for ransom, and instead bail out using the ships life boat, holding Captain Phillips as hostage.

Warning: SPOILER:  Like most good movies, this has a happy but emotional ending, with the SEALS having 3 kills (all pirates), one captured (now serving a 33 year sentence in a Federal Correctional Facility, and Captain Phillips surviving the ordeal, and eventually returning to sea.  Moral of the story: never mess with SEALS.

The film in impeccably cast, with an older Tom Hanks (at least apparently) than we are used to seeing, apparently real native Somali's playing the pirates, a story line true to the book by the real Captain Richard Phillips.  The action never stops, and keeps you riveted.  Don't miss it.",1390953600,,1030,4.851428571428571

It was really pretty easy, following the straight-forward instructions provided by Amazon.  The trailer peaked our interest as it looked really good on our Panasonic plasma screen from our Blu-Ray player.  When downloading it, a message appeared about the bandwidth and continuing in standard definition or high definition.  We turned off our wireless printer and the desktop computer and by doing that we were able to download and play the movie in HD.  The movie was action filled with associated drama...and a good ending.  Interestingly no sex, no cursing, and realistic violence...and could be enjoyed without cringing by the whole family.  I had to be told by the wife to sit down and stop commenting through the movie...so it was really good!

Hanks and the film keep you on the edge of your seat throughout, and the filmaking by Greengrass was first rate. My $0.02 on the facts of the story (spoiler alert) -- if half the money spent on Captain Philips's rescue was spent in aid to Somalia and similar war-torn areas, perhaps there would be no need for pirates in the first place!",1390953600,,668,4.575

The story is complete in the fashion of putting the viewer in the perfect spot to experience the emotions and decisions that a captain must take on in his position. At times the viewer themselves will be making choices regarding the way to go. First secure the safety of his crew and be capable of  accepting the out come of results. I myself felt the many different emotions brewing as Hanks was showing how calm and collective the Captain was and needed to be as required. Having to handle such a situation on the opposite side of the world making sure every choice was the best along with knowing the fact that one may never seen family or home again may just be the final acceptance one would be forced to accept. The movie also reminds us that in the 21st century there are still countries that are ravaged with civil war and they are forced to take from others so that dictators and warlords still reap the intended rewards of such brutal acts.
  Understanding that this is just one example of how civilizations that have been in existence for centuries based on their beliefs and social and cultural developments and organization needs to be understood but acceptance is questionable. I for one believe that each and everyone of use need to remind ourselves that their are others in our world that do not have as many things to be thankful for as we of a develop country do.

6067316,4,B00G7M190U,Captain Phillips provides a seriously tension filled movie experience. Tom Hanks is terrific in the title role. The actors who play the Somali pirates are equally strong. The movie has a very short buildup that allows the viewers to understand the  major players but the action sequences commence very early on and once they do the action is relentless making the entire rest of the film edge of your seat stuff.  I have read that there is some criticism that the film distorts the actual story  but even if true that doesn't detract from the quality of this as an action movie. I haven't been that tense watching a film in a long time.,1390953600,,636,4.56140350877193

6067320,5,B00G7M190U,"There are nay-sayers out there who have 'dissed' this movie, some insisting that the title character was ""no hero,"" that he had plotted a course that put the Maersk Alabama at great risk.  To them, I say:  THIS is not about Maritime practices, nor is it a documentary.

From its opening scene, dialogue between Captain Phillips and his wife confirmed how ""dog-eat-dog"" Maritime employment had become because of competition, economies world-wide, and the lack of good-paying jobs in the United States, in particular.  In one pivotal scene in the movie, Captain Phillips tells his crew that HIS job is to get the cargo to its destination as efficiently as possible.  THAT was his job.  It is STILL the job of Mariner Captains, Train Engineers, Over-The-Road Truck Drivers, and any and all other employment sectors where the goods are PUSHED by the companies to be delivered on (preferably ahead of) schedule.

Now to the movie - AS a true story - AS a movie:

""Captain Phillips"" is in Oscar territory now, and there are no pirates on the horizon.  Hanks should win another Academy Award for Best Actor.  The film should win for Best Motion Picture, ditto directing, cinematography, editing, sound, etc. etc. etc.  Why?
Because it is JUST that much of an uncommonly GREAT motion picture that never loses track, never goes off-beat, and never loses its compelling interest.  ALL actors are outstanding.

Finally - to the Mariners out there who think they would do something different had they been Captain of the Maersk Alabama?  You weren't.  IF you were a crew member of that ship?  Here's a suggestion:  Find another job.",1390953600,,1620,4.897058823529412

Captain Phillips was taken hostage and off his ship to protect his crew. He is a hero of hero's in the logs of all ships passing those dangerous water off the Somali coast. On the North / East coast of Africa. Even Mombasa, Africa is off limits to the U.S. Navy for stopping to take on supplies. I was in Mombasa in 1974. It was a very interesting city. But today. It is not the same at all.
In short. You must see this move in order to understand just what is going on off the coast of North / East Africa and the Pirates.",1390953600,,751,4.081081081081081

6067333,5,B00G7M190U,"One of the best movies I've seen in a very long time..  Although it was a very small part of the movie, it would have been soo much better if they had really filmed in Vermont. Our interstate has two lanes on each side through the whole state.. No billboards, no restaurant signs, green license plates everywhere, and our interstate goes only up to exit 22 (then you are in Canada). Vermont looks very different from the rest of the country and any Vermonter would be able to easily tell that they didn't film there. Takes authenticity away from the film. Other than that, absolutely blew me away.",1390953600,,597,4.527777777777778

eyes to see what goes on in our international waters....& what a great job our ""Seals"" do for our country & mankind.

6067335,5,B00G7M190U,"The true story of Captain Phillips is told in a thrilling and scary way. It is a great portrayal of the actual events that were reported in the news, when this incident happened. It takes you from the villages of Mogadishu where the men who are the pirates live, to the huge container ship off the coast where the hijacking takes place. It portrays all the minutia that we are not aware of from the newspaper accounts. We see the weapons and gear the pirates have to board the huge ship in mid sea. They are adept at this, from years of experience. And of course they try to prey on a lone ship, as was the the Maersk Alabama, in stead of one in a convoy, etc. And it shows what anti-hijacking measures the ship is allowed to have (no firearms!) Hanks portrayal of Captain Phillips is excellent.( And while I like him I am not a big fan. But he does a great job in this film.) The story moves along very fast. And it doesn't have a lot of extraneous scenes of other events than what happened in the hijacking.
If you like action: and want to root for the good guys and hate the bad guys, this movie has a satisfying ending for you.
I recommend it!

6067337,4,B00G7M190U,"Very enjoyable, well acted movie that skims the surface of the socio/political outcomes of millions ordinary business transactions which turn fishermen into pirates and demonstrate the use of armies, that used to be dedicated to defending a country's borders, converted into ""forcing/keeping open"" global markets for a country's goods and services. It also points out that the laws of man are an expression of a wished for behavior, but when push comes to shove, it is the actions of its enforcers that determines the fairness or unfairness to the 99%.

Actually, almost none of that is in the movie, but it is a fast paced, action movie with excellent personal interaction of the life situations portrayed by the actors. And Hank's portrayal of the processing the enormity of the emotional trip after rescue is arresting.  Must have been technically very difficult movie to film.",1390953600,,880,5.104166666666667

If believability is the measure for Oscar-worthiness, he should be a shoe-in.  The directorial decision to film in (what seemed to be) the inside of that lifeboat, was brilliant.

It just leaves me frustrated to know that our country would spend so much money and divert so many resources to solving the problem of a few drunken idiots in fishing boats being able to capture a 30 foot tall cargo ship.

6067403,5,B00G7M190U,"Tom Hanks, as usual, did an excellent job playing Captain Phillips. This movie will ""capture"" you from the very beginning.  This is a real story that will give you a glimpse into the harsh and impoverished  lives of Somalian fishermen.  I couldn't help to compare Captain Philips's heroic behavior with Francesco Schettino's from the Costa Concordia cruise ship. Wow!

6067407,2,B00G7M190U,Perhaps it was because I already knew how the story would turn out or perhaps I had heard that the captain was not as nice a portrayed but I wasn't dazzled by this movie or the actors.  The real heroes were the navy seals.  The contrast between America and Somalia was spot on.,1390953600,2,277,4.2075471698113205

Excellent portrayal of what happened to Captain Richard Phillips and a stark reminder that America is the greatest place on earth to live.  And, if allowed to stay strong, our military and especially the Navy Seals are the best protection we, as Americans, have.  As always, Tom Hanks delivered an excellent performance.  The final scenes with him and the Navy doctor were as real as it gets.  Thank you Mr. Hanks for delivering performances that matter.

If this was how it really went down, our armed forces and Captain Phillips are to be commended on trying to resolve the situation without loss of the pirates life.

It provides the details, and some of the context of the story that had everyone in the USA riveted to the news. That said, if you are interested enough to watch the movie, you know how it ends. I did not find the movie either inspirational, or uplifting. (Saving Private Ryan is an example of what I had hoped for).

I also believe that there is an element of propaganda to this film, which is focused on the single account of the US fighting back against the Somalia pirates. There is no mention of the multiple Russian or Korean Navy victories against these gangs.",1390953600,,634,4.4655172413793105

6067456,4,B00G7M190U,Once again mr hanks is at sea fighting this time elements and amateur pirates. The pirates depict the desperation of ppl that see . These big boats full of riches they cannot obtain unless they steal it. You feel for the captain desprate measure to save his crew .you feel it is unjustified that he has to call for help and see time and time again that he's own country is not even on call. Until the UK reaches out to the United States . Then the Calvary comes in . The idea that these pirates think that they can get millions of dollars . To feed their family and some how come to America. Without the USA finding out who they are. Is be on me. But all I have to say you feel for both crews. You feel the frustration of the pirates trying to be robin hoods and steal for the greater good. And the ship crew who are sitting ducks. You get angry at the fact that this is not being resolved fast enough. In real life . It's a great movie to see .,1390953600,,945,4.005291005291006

Bringing all that military might to bear to rescue one man is fantastic. Tom Hanks somehow ALWAYS just slips into his characters. I think this works so well because we all know (and most really like) Tom Hanks. The pacing is excellent. For a 2+hr movie it isn't boring at all. The way the director depicts the Navy and US SEALs as an efficient professional group doing a job is great. The director also shows us what conditions exist to push the pirates into doing what they do. While the story is very basic, the execution is superb from beginning to end.

The plot: a captain takes his crew, ship and cargo into pirate infested waters he knew about before setting sail and was reminded again while enroute and ends up having a large Navy compliment trying to release him from the pirates.
The absurdity is that the captain carried no defenses on board and yet proceeded away from a group of other ships into pirate waters.  The crew was maybe 10 guys.  The captain knowing about the pirates did everything wrong....who in their right mind would take a valuable ship and risk his crew by going solo thru pirate waters with no defense.  The pirates took the ship with a couple of run of the mill AK 47s.....unbelievable.....total malfeasance.",1390867200,7,748,4.7384615384615385

6067558,4,B00G7M190U,"Nine Things about the Film Captain Phillips

1. Based on a true story, this is about a merchant mariner on a cargo ship that gets hijacked by Somali pirates in 2009.

2. It was directed by the guy that made a couple of the Bourne movies.

3. It was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Picture of 2013. But Im not sure why. It was decent, but it wasn't Best Picture of the Year material.

4. Half of the movie takes place on a cramped cargo ship. The other half takes place on an even more cramped lifeboat. This isn't exactly epic.

5. It was filmed on exact replicas of the ship and the lifeboat.

6. Its really interesting in terms of seeing how modern-day pirates operate, and how the US retaliates.

7. The story itself is pretty predictable. Youve got the Good Guy, the Bad Guy Who Isnt Really Bad, the Real Bad Guy, and the Teenager Thats In Over His Head. The fact that the Good Guy is Tom Hanks takes away a lot of the suspense about who is going to live. I didn't know the real story, but I knew how the movie was going to end about halfway through.

8. Tom Hanks does a good job, but hes always the same. In this movie, hes just Tom Hanks with a Boston accent.

9. The real standout actor is Barkhad Abdi, who plays the Somali pirate captain. He was excellent and deserves an award.",1390867200,,1296,4.172690763052209

We felt it was well done, with great acting. Hanks, did a great job, very reminiscent of ""Saving Private Ryan."" The Somalian actor was suburb, especially considering he was a ""walk-on,"" with no prior acting experience.

6067560,5,B00G7M190U,This was a real thriller and especially so as it's a true story.  Tom Hanks did a superb acting job and got shafted by the Academy for not being nominated for Best Actor.  It's a heavy drama so would not recommend for children under 12.,1390867200,,236,4.222222222222222
6067561,5,B00G7M190U,The last 5 minutes is worth the price thanks to Tom Hank's acting ability. It evokes an intense emotional response that is neither sad nor happy. Watch it and see what I mean.,1390867200,,175,4.333333333333333

6067578,4,B00G7M190U,"I love Tom Hanks as an actor! I watched the movie to see his performance and to see how the story was portrayed. He didn't disappoint. The time spent in the lifeboat was a bit too long for me. I also questioned a career ship captain's choice to jump into the sea at night when he was surrounded by three US Navy ships.
I loved the compassion of the Navy Captain in his attempts to reach a peaceable end to the hostage situation. I also enjoyed the portrayal of the SEAL team though it was hard to see the performance due to the darkness of the night. The SEALS go through intense training and I for one appreciate the tough jobs they are assigned. Go US Navy SEAL Teams!! I'm glad that you are on our side.
I enjoyed the Corpsmen as she evaluated Tom Hank's injuries. She was believable in the role.
I liked the movie and watched it twice. I gave it 4 stars based on the criticisms listed above.",1390867200,,895,4.209302325581396

6067592,4,B00G7M190U,I would rate this as an average movie.  A little slow in spots but overall a likable movie.  Tom Hanks does a good job in his role and is a likeable character as always.  Probably will not make my top 10 list of movies this year but still an enjoyable movie that I was glad to have watched.,1390867200,,290,3.9655172413793105

Also, one sees the humanity of all involved in this instance...as both sides, the Somali pirates as well as Captain Phillips , come across as real people...not just good guys vs. bad guys. Hanks should get his 3rd Oscar...he just leaves you limp.",1390867200,,426,4.532467532467533

6067609,5,B00G7M190U,No movie can be 100% accurate.  Consumer expectations require some embellishment. This was pretty close to the story that was reported.  The climactic scene apparently is not really embellished much.  I won't give it away (in case you've been livening in Outer Mongolia the last few years) but it's truly amazing.,1390867200,,313,5.098039215686274

6067625,5,B00G7M190U,Hanks again does a commendable job at playing the real Captain Phillips. The story moves really fast during the 2+ hours so one must not take ones eye of the screen.

6067628,5,B00G7M190U,"It's a sign of great story-telling and great acting when you know how the story ends, but it's still an edge-of-your-seat cliff-hanger of a movie.  Ignore the dialog between Captain and Mrs. Phillips at the beginning.  It's terribly written and terribly acted, and makes you wonder if you made a mistake renting this movie.  But after that initial dud, the movie is nearly flawless.

6067688,5,B00G7M190U,"I am normally not patriotic, but throughout the whole movie, you can't help but notice how so many people come together to save one man. Like a whole country united all of it's power and resources to save you. The message is clear: not everyone is lucky enough to be an American, but if you are one, don't take it for granted. You are being held up by many hands.

The leader of the Somalian pirates, Muse, is always muttering things that give you the notion that he wishes he belonged to that ""special club"". He says he wants to ""live in New York and buy a car"". He has it all planned out for himself. He is doing it all for money, but he only wants money to have a life in America. As the movie progresses, you start to realize that he isn't a bad guy, just terribly driven.

Tom Hanks was awesome as usual. The movie gradually escalates more and more until you reach it's exciting conclusion. I almost wish I hadn't remembered seeing what happened on the news a few years ago. Captain Phillips is so in shock by what transpired because he is in such awe of how much people cared about him. It is kind of like Black Hawk Down's ""leave no man behind"" mentality and he suddenly discovers he is the center of it. In this last scene you can pinpoint the moment of this great epiphany. The way he says ""thank you"" is a humble whimper, as if he is trying to say it to an entire country.

6067691,5,B00G7M190U,"I tend to fall on the side of not being overly enamored with anything that comes out of Hollywood.  This movie is probably the best I have seen in years.  First off, this is one of Hanks' best, if not the best, performances of a great career.  His performance in the last three minutes of the movie alone was oscar-worthy.  The performances by the actors portraying the ""pirates"" are exceptional as well.  I feared the movie might bore me at times, but Director Greengrass does a terrific job pacing every moment.  He builds a two plus hour movie to a terrific, suspenseful crescendo.  I really tried to find something to complain about this movie, but couldn't.  I have not had a chance to read the book by Captain Phillips so it may be that the filmmakers took a degree of poetic license to enhance the story, but from script, to dialogue, to acting to cinematography this borders on a perfect movie.  There are a few moments where some of the dialogue is not as clear as one might like, or action is difficult to see owing to low light, but I felt like those instances lent to the realism and effort to build tension and draw the audience in.  Others might differ on that point, but I felt this was a phenomenal movie.",1390780800,,1221,4.434977578475336
6067692,2,B00G7M190U,"Based on a true story or not, there just wasn't enough plot material here to make a major motion picture.  Hanks turns in a requisite fine performance but it cannot make up for the paucity of an actual story.  I never felt any tension, anxiety or even much sense of drama.  Hanks (Phillips) is about the only character you have any feeling for, and, for the most part, he is simply a helpless captive.  We can feel sorry for him, and that's about it.  I thought the whole thing was dragged out to an extreme degree.  Even when Navy Seals arrive, the story seems to just go into sleep mode.  I didn't give a hoot or a holler about the Somalis.  The pirates are not presented in any sort of appealing or redeeming light.  They are at the mercy of their ""bosses,"" and so must scourer the seas in search for ""money.""  What kind of people are they who forfeit their collective integrity for a few crime bosses?  Can't they stand up?  Sorry, but I have no pity for the pirating business.  And what's the deal with cargo transports that carry millions in food/water/other supplies, going out into dangerous waters, unescorted, with not even a single rifle on board?

6067707,3,B00G7M190U,"I've done some research, I'm hesitant to use the word ""Extensive"".  Having said that, the crew's unique efforts & utter brilliancy working together, devising plans to frustrate the pirates and capture one all occurred w/o the direction of their captain.  In fact, it was largely the crew efforts that got the pirates off the ship.

Captain Phillips efforts were helpful to be sure but one of the most beneficial aspects of his captivity aboard the lifeboat was that he did not move from his initial seated position.  However, many hours/days he was aboard, incredibly he didn't move from his initial position thus making it more likely the special forces wouldn't hit him when they shot the pirates.  So most of the drama aboard the lifeboat was for our entertainment compliments of Hollywood rather than what occurred during the incident itself.

Nevertheless, kudos to the captain, crew & the US Navy.for their excellent work denying outlaws any kidnap victims, cargo & the sudden demise of the 3 pirates ought to act as some sort of determent to future like activities.  It is a shame Captain Phillips false drama demanded so much screen time but it was what I expected.

The real underlying issues are: A) Agriculturally & the desertification or overuse of land resources; B) as was briefly mentioned the local waters are being over-fished by corporate capture straight to the can ships, leaving nothing for local fishermen; C)  The Islamification of the once proud culture, supplied w/weapons by China; D) multiple Somali generations have grown up in the current violent paradigm, it will take much work and trust to change all that hatred and violence.

6067739,4,B00G7M190U,"This is a fine film that faithfully recreates what happened in this incident in which Somali pirates took control of an unarmed American cargo freighter off the horn of Africa.  Hanks, as always, gives an excellent performance.  This film is based upon Captain Phillips' own account of the incident.

The elephant in the room is the question as to why on Earth this cargo ship sailed unarmed into one of the most dangerous areas in the world.  The short answer is that the insurance companies that provide coverage for these vessels insist upon it, for whatever stupid reason.  Thus, a 21st Century wonder like this cargo vessel can be successfully overcome by illiterate primitives with a few rifles in skiffs powered by outboard motors.  I found myself having to struggle to enjoy the movie simply because the idea that the crew of the cargo ship were without weapons seemed like a peculiar form of insanity.  So instead, when the ship notifies the local naval force that they are being attacked by pirates, they are advised to ""deploy your fire hoses...""  Fire hoses are for putting out fires, not for standing up to gunmen armed with AK-47s.  This was stupidity on a grand scale.  Not Captain Phillips' fault, of course.  These were the orders he and his crew received.

If you can get past the stupidity of whoever put this cargo vessel in harm's way completely unarmed, this is a tense, gripping, and accurate film.  Of course, eventually heroic men with guns, i.e. the US Navy and its Seals, were called in to save the day and the ending will make anyone proud of America's armed forces.  But what form of insanity requires brave men like Captain Phillips and his crew to present themselves as unarmed targets to these savages?  That is the real question that this film never answers.

6067752,5,B00G7M190U,"Though based on Richard Phillips' book `A Captain's Duty: Somali Pirates, Navy SEALS, and Dangerous Days at Sea' which is the true story of Captain Richard Phillips and the 2009 hijacking by Somali pirates of the US-flagged MV Maersk Alabama, the first American cargo ship to be hijacked in two hundred years, the screenplay by Billy Ray (The Hunger Games, State of Play, Color of Night) is so brilliantly written that the 134 minutes of this `docu-drama' tear through the mind at terrifying speed and there is not a moment when the audience can breathe without fear of missing the action. Of course, much of that is due to the impeccable direction by Paul Greengrass (The Bourne series, United 93, Green Zone, etc), but the kudos land directly for the extraordinary performance by Tom Hanks, in what many of us believe is his finest performance on film, along with `Philadelphia'.

Because it is history, everyone knows the story: a multi-layered examination of the 2009 hijacking of the U.S. container ship Maersk Alabama by a crew of Somali pirates. The film focuses on the relationship between the Alabama's commanding officer, Captain Richard Phillips (Hanks), and the Somali pirate captain, Muse (Barkhad Abdi), who takes him hostage. Phillips and Muse are set on a predestined collision course when Muse and his crew target Phillips' unarmed ship. In the breathtaking standoff, 145 miles off the Somali coast, both men find themselves at the mercy of forces beyond their control.

Greengrass had the right idea in casting completely unknown non-actors as the Somali pirate crew: Barkhad Abdi (born in Somalia but living in the US and serving as a chauffeur when he was cast with no acting experience at all), Barkhad Abdirahman, Faysal Ahmed, and Mahat M. Ali - each is wholly credible in the tense drama both on the big ship and in the claustrophobic life boat where they hold Captain Phillips hostage. The entire cast is very well enacted, keeping the tension and the sense of terror at facing a battle for which they have never been trained.

This is a superb piece of filmmaking and why it was snubbed by the Oscar nominations is a conundrum. Grady Harp, January 14",1390694400,2,2176,4.89159891598916

Hanks, a pretty good history guy, really let's himself be used without legitimate factual  license.  Those pirates were crooks and could have easily killed the crew if not on purpose, then by accident. Somalians are poor solely because of tribalism which supports little more than criminal gangs with a strong man. Trying to make the audience feel sorry for what is a brutal criminalistic element that is engaged in terror and rape is a real stretch for a movie that's supposed to be factual.

6067783,5,B00G7M190U,"And with no further adieu, here is what I think about Captain Phillips.

We have a movie that is based on real events, hence being introduced to the titular character Richard(""Rich"" in the movie). Richard Phillips is given the task of taking command of a ship by the name MV Maersk Alabama. And as he aboards the ship things are running ever so smoothly. However, after taking notice of two not-so-familiar boats that are approaching the ship, our Captain finds himself at the very center of a hostage crisis, and from there, we have our movie.

I should start by saying that I did do some research going into the movie; and although there have been reports that this movie itself is not entirely accurate, I loved Captain Phillips. Tom Hanks has had numerous good/great performances; THIS IS one of his greats. From beginning to end, he personifies the role of the Captain turned hostage very well. And though Barkhad Abdi is relatively an unknown actor, he was equally as great in his role as Abduwali Muse. Great acting.

The situation on screen is almost unbearable; many times during the movie I was holding my breath because of the intensity of the scenes and the savagery of the Somalian pirates. They are not clever, but they have guns, and their leader Abduwali has a motive.

If you have not yet seen Captain Phillips, I urge everyone to give this movie a watch. With Outstanding performances and a notably shrill 3rd act, Captain Phillips gets

Unfortunately, the sound track on the blu-ray disk is faulty.

I checked the sound in several scenes throughout the movie, and the sound is faulty throughout.  The problem is definitely not my blu-ray player as I have several movies in blu-ray and they all play just fine.
Fortunately, the DVD disc works fine so I will probably keep it and avoid the hassle of returning the set.

6067813,5,B00G7M190U,"If you are the kind of person that can't understand English if it has an accent then you might not like it. The film too some creative license, and you already know the outcome. The only reason I wanted to comment is that it would have been so easy for the crew to over power the pirates with all the tools and equipment they have. They were strong men, and the pirates are weak, not clever, and not paying attention with their Bulgarian made AK-47's. It is almost impossible to believe that four skinnies could take such a huge ship when there are so many chances to bash their heads in.

The Navy does a great job, but if the cargo ships were able to have 1)Wilson Combat Shotguns,  2, Mount Mini-Guns, 3) Have a few hand grenades and phosphorous bombs, and sidearms as well as AR 10's, there is no way they could be boarded even with four or five private contractors. Seems like insurance companies would DEMAND this. In port the weapons can be locked up. But these guys manage to take the whole ship with a cheap aluminum skiff and no plans. Time for sea marshals or contractors that ca fight. Even basic martial arts would have defeated them the way they held their rifles and pistols and it would have all been over.  Flame throwers would be useful to and simple RPG right to the skiff. They would never even get close. That part was frustrating as the passiveness of the crew allowed very weak pirates and very few to board. Drop boiling oil on their heads for gosh sakes and they would never get close. The Seals were awesome. Tom Hanks,as always, made the movie gripping particularly at the end.",1390608000,,1604,4.430508474576271

I was not surprised to discover that Paul Greengrass directed this movie as I loved ""United 93"" and one of the terrorists from that movie makes an appearance in this movie.

6067834,5,B00G7M190U,Realistic and dramatically authentic account of Somali thugs stealing on the high seas. Ship carrying food aid to Somalia is attacked by Somali losers who are working for mid level thugs in Ray-Bans back home.  The absurdity of sending sailors into those waters while forbidding them to carry protection is clearly developed as the rescue eventually involves a major military effort and the incredible skills of the Navy Seals. Tom Hanks is very good and captures the nave disbelief so typical of well-meaning folks who come face to face with evil. He actually thinks he can reason with the Somalis. Exciting drama and a glimpse into a real scenario that boggles the mind considering it happens over and over again in the Indian Ocean while the world simply shrugs.,1390521600,2,765,4.930232558139535

The acting was superb; Hanks definitely gave an Oscar worthy performance, and the pirate captain was very convincing in his mixed emotions as things didn't go as planned. The  script was riveting, leaving me at the edge of my seat the entire time.

Apparently, some of those who gave the movie only one star due to their perception of a ridiculous premise -- an unarmed crew with the captain shooting flares at the pirates -- don't realize the movie was based on actual events, that this was how the captain tried to defend his ship.

I also liked the fact that the piracy of an impoverished nation stemmed largely from the fact that fishing conglomerates had wiped out the fishing industry of Somalia, an important reminder of the damage our industries often impose on the economies
of other countries.

It was nice to know it's not just my husband who does this. :) The movies was very well done, intense in a few spots, but I was able to watch it without covering my eyes.

6067906,1,B00G7M190U,"Someone who thought this story was film worthy does not deserve any stars. I can't just sit there and watch a relatively large group of American men on a huge ship hiding and scared while 3-4 little barbarians in a junk boat board and dominate the ship via a rusty ladder and 3 guns. I can't comprehend how this happened in the first place. I can't watch the little pirates easily thwart every ridiculous daycare-style safeguard while the Americans whine and cry about being in unions and not signing up for that. I stopped watching after the tiny little pirate shot open the second locked gate. I can not wrap my mind around the absurdity and I just can't bring myself to care what happens to anyone involved.

Just before the pirates board and move through the ship like they own it the captain goes to unlock what I just knew was something that contained the means to defend himself, the ship, and the men but no, he instead clumsily and desperately starts shooting flares at the pirates, of course missing them, while the other guy frantically tries to aim a hose at them. It is one of the most ridiculous things I have ever seen.

There is no justifiable reason, law, or excuse that grown men let this ship be boarded and subjugated by savages in the total absence of any real attempt to provide the means to defend themselves. When the whiny union guy found out where they were going did he not wonder how they were going to deal with encounters in pirate-ridden waters? I can't muster up enough emotion or interest in the real circumstances that allowed this to occur except to ask what in the hell is wrong with people?

I knew the story was about Somali pirates taking over a ship and I do love Tom Hanks, but I had no idea it was going to be one of the most pathetic spectacles I've ever seen. I can't believe that at some point I am supposed to see something deemed heroic. You have GOT to be kidding me. What a sickening display of weakness, fear, and unpreparedness for the real world. I guess something brave at some point is supposed to happen? Who cares. I know I will get down votes because obviously the standards are so low these days regarding heroism or even just making some simple sense as human beings. Just look at the rave reviews for this expose on absurdity. It's like just because it was advertised a certain way it will get a certain response. Too bizarre.",1390435200,16,2386,4.45537757437071

What I found most enthralling was the performance by the Somali pirates - what I mean is, these guys could as easily been pirates as actors. If I were Tom Hanks, I think I would have been genuinely concerned that they might forget they were making a movie!

Tom Hanks, of course, gives a stellar performance, but Issak Farah Samatar was magnificent beyond description.

6067937,5,B00G7M190U,"That was my skeptic side thinking on the subject of Somali pirates over taking a cargo ship.

Answer: A very good one.

Surprisingly this was a very witty and emotional take on a situation that  happens more often than reported on. Very well developed characters which were based on real people with a real situation. You can feel a glimpse of how much this impacted the captain; as it may also leave you a little shocked as well.

 It makes you think . . . ""Could I, should I do more?"" We have many opportunities as American citizens that we take for granted, choose to disregard, or even willingly vote away.

You can truly understand the terror felt by these individuals when a group of gun-toting ""fisherman"" storm the bridge and threaten to kill everyone. The performances by all of the actors helps you immerse into the tension of the situation and also appreciate the skill and savvy of the crew and captain in their efforts to deal with pirates.

Of course the ending of the ordeal will go down in history as one of the best performances by Navy Seals in their history but the anti-climax where Hanks shows us the after effects on Phillips is amazing.",1390435200,2,620,4.7407407407407405

That pretty much spoiled the movie for me. Tom Hanks is one of my favorite actors, so I tried to enjoy it. I thought the acting was great, but it went downhill from there.

Even if the portrayal had been correct, the movie didn't qualify as a thriller in my opinion.  Scenes are long and drawn out and some were downright boring. I guess they used the ""jerky"" film shooting to make the scenes appear more interesting.",1390435200,7,612,4.504504504504505

The pirates were given a human face, they were ""bad guys"" but, as Captain Phillips did,  didn't want them to die. Tom Hanks' performance was incredible as was the portrayal of the Somali pirates.

We are still talking about it 2 days later.  What an amazing risk was taken to save his crew and it makes you think about choice you make.

A small group of men was able to easily take over a ship with a crew of 30 or so. The only defense against invaders were the fire hoses. The movie is recommended.",1390435200,,450,4.244186046511628

6068045,5,B00G7M190U,"Captain Rich Phillips (Tom Hanks) was taking his American cargo ship on a routine voyage off the coast of Africa, when a small band of armed Somali pirates boarded the ship.  While most of the crew stayed hidden, the pirates took Captain Phillips hostage in a lifeboat.

This movie, based on a true story, is extremely intense and exciting, so frightening, I don't think I could have watched it on the big screen, but on DVD, it was riveting and enlightening.  There isn't any real violence until the very end, but the drama is kept at a unbearable level by the non-stop manic  yelling of the pirates.  Their leader is played by Barkhad Abdi in his first acting role.  He is outstanding and deserves his nomination for Best Supporting Actor.  Tom Hanks delivers a powerful performance, remaining calm and providing a balance to the pirates' hysteria.

The script manages to elicit sympathy for the pirates because of their miserable lives; they live in abject poverty, forced to hijack ships by their warlords or die.  The movie is excellent and highly recommended.",1390348800,,1065,4.8397790055248615

The PQ is solid though in some dark scenes it's a little cloudy, but the lighter scenes are outstanding. The AQ is phenomenal and I could not ""hear"" it being any better.

This movie is based on a true story and it is quite an entertaining thriller. It has some action but it is more of a suspense thriller. Hanks is amazing as always and the rest of the cast, namely the pirates also give a solid performance.

 The extras are what you would expect and nothing more.

Having watched the news when the actual story happened back in 2009, I knew how the story was going to end, but the dramatization and portrayal of this story kept me on the edge of my seat until the end.  Hanks was outstanding in his role of the ship captain and I especially want to give credit to the actors who played the pirates.  They especially made the feel of the movie realistic and portrayed the differing personalities very well.  This movie has action, drama and feels tense all the way through, just the way it is suppose to be done.

This is probably one of the best ""true story"" adaptations that I have seen in a while.  It seems to stick to mostly the facts of what happened, although no story does that 100 percent, but it seemed believable and is very well done.  Worth watching for sure.",1390348800,2,951,4.431034482758621

6068072,2,B00G7M190U,"The story is predictable. There is a natural tension to the situation. So what. It did not, to me, make for a movie worth watching. You know how it resolves before it starts.

The setup itself is stupid. If it were not something approximating a true story, you would think that it is a ridiculous notion that such large commercial vessels have no real way to defend themselves. If anything, the movie is about corporate indifference to employee safety and governmental incompetence. Certainly not interesting entertainment.

There is no reason to care about any of the characters beyond them being human beings, including the desperate Somali savages.

Tom Hanks is a great actor, but they could have had a voice over for Mr. Potato Head in the role and it wouldn't have made any difference, other than making the film more entertaining.

The most notable thing about this movie is how badly shot and edited it is: full of jerky camera and quickly cut shots of relentless ugliness. The bad direction and cinematography alone damns the film as a throw-away.

Good movies are ones worth watching more than once. This movie is not worth finishing. 10 years from now this film will be forgotten. But right now, it's grittiness will earn it accolades from the easily excited.",1390262400,7,1270,4.8341013824884795

The movie's director fairly portrays both sides. No ""real""  winners. You feel compassion for both sides if you have a heart.

6068084,4,B00G7M190U,"Pre Review and Hype:
I first saw a trailer for this movie in late 2013 and immediately knew I wanted to see it. After the trailer, it fell underneath the radar until it hit the television for commercials. I never got the chance to see it on the big screen, so I can only imagine how much more intense it would've been at the movie theater.

Review (may contain spoilers):

Paul Greengrass, director of many thrillers, takes the viewer on a rollercoaster of emotions. Starting in the beginning with a slight bit of sadness, then when the pirates are spotted during a drill it gets a little heated. The movie does a lot of the ups and downs, going from white-knuckle intense to just coasting along. Greengrass does an amazing job at telling the story and I feel as though all the ups and downs are necessary in order to fully engage the viewer to make them feel as though they are right there with the crew of the Maersk Alabama.

The most significant parts of the movie are so well done that I felt as though they weren't acting at all and I was right there with them. One of these parts is right as the pirates are trying to board the ship and Phillips is trying to ram them off course to avoid being boarded. Eventually, however, they get boarded and the crew has to hide in the bowels of the ship in order to not be seen by the pirates.

After the pirates board the ship, things start to get more interesting. As seen in the trailer, Phillips advises his crew that they have been boarded and tells them to remember one thing: You know the ship better than they do. Once the pirates reach the cabin, they take Phillips and two other crew members hostage and demand control of the ship.

The leader of the Somalis eventually gets bum-rushed in the Engine Room and becomes a hostage himself, as the crew radio up to the cabin and let the other pirates know. The pirates are given the opportunity to leave on one of the lifeboats with the money in the safe in exchange for Phillips, who was singled out and taken as a sole hostage. After a dispute between the two groups, Phillips has to get in the lifeboat and the pirates con the crew into exchanging hostages. However, when Phillips is in the lifeboat, they knock him to the ground, shut off the lifeboat's entrance, and plunge into the waters below.

I go into any more detail about the movie because I believe the rest of it is so crucial to see for yourself. I explained about half of the movie, and the rest of it is the best part. I strongly urge everyone who can withstand a little bit of downtime in a 2 hour movie to go see this movie. The plot is so simple, yet so well done that I was floored even though I had high expectations.

Tom Hanks is such a brilliant actor. The emotion on his face and in his actions throughout the whole movie made it feel as though it were the actual events unfolding live.

Rating: 8/10. Must See.",1390262400,,2888,4.31549815498155

I'm sorry, aside from the cool Navy Seal stuff at the end, this was the most boring movie in history. The pirates were more sympathetic and interesting than anyone on the ship. I was cheering for them, if you want to know the truth.

Why does the Academy love to give awards to multi-millionaire actors pretending to be retarded? Why? I want an answer, dammit!

Imagine Bogart or Robert Mitchum or William Holden in this role. Would they be as limp as Tom Hanks? I wanted to rush up on the screen and lend him a walker.

Or even go cross-grain a bit and cast Mickey Rourke channeling Bogart. make the guy INTERESTING.

Why don't they make movies with actual male leads anymore? Do we have ANYONE, aside from Russell Crowe, who is close to being an actual MALE?

Sorry, I just watched Magnificent Seven the other night, which has LOTS of actual men. Looking at the current crop of actors is just sad. Matt Damon? George Clooney? Christian Bale? Are you freaking serious? (though to be fair, Mathew McConaghey (sp) is turning into an interesting actor)

There was ONE hilarious scene, though I don't think it was intentional. When Captain Philips logged on to his computer to e-mail his wife, I was waiting for the screen to come up ""You've Got Mail"". Now THAT would have been funny.

One reviewer mentioned the director had worked with Matt Damon on two Jason Bourne movies. Let me make this clear. Matt Damon as an action hero is to Jason Statham like Budweiser is to a McCallan 18 year old. Damon can be interesting in intellectual roles, but action? It is to laugh.

6068089,4,B00G7M190U,"Tom Hanks immerses himself in any role he tackles - truly one of the greats of our time. His portrayal of the captain of the American cargo ship The Alabama, highjacked by Somali pirates, is outstanding. Better still, Barkhad Abdi, an unknown inexperienced Somali who plays his qat-fuelled neurotic nemesis, Muse, is truly brilliant - the perfect foil to Hanks' polish. Both of them are worthy of their respective award nominations. A stellar cast, all round, made credible under Paul Greengrass' expert direction.

Tension builds at a steady pace, setting the scene for what is to come. Having successfully boarded the ship, the pirates take Phillips hostage in a lifeboat. The claustrophobic heat of the sealed lifeboat has been conveyed with skill, but as this ordeal must have seemed to go on forever for Phillips, it goes on forever for the audience too. At 2 1/4 hours, this movie - particularly this sequence, is simply too long.

Tempting as it may be to capture every moment, at least 30 minutes could have been edited from the movie as a whole.

But watching the film based on his harrowing ordeal, I felt exactly as Phillips himself must have felt while living through it: When the hell is this damn thing going to end?

Don't get me wrong, this is a well crafted, well acted film -- Hanks's last 20 minutes, in particular, are brilliant -- but one that goes on for at least a half-hour too long.  Granted -- unlike Phillips, of course -- I knew how the story would end and I knew that he'd be fine.  Even so, I expected to feel some sense of anxiety and suspense, much as Ben Affleck was able to create in ""Argo,"" another film where the ending was public knowledge.  For some reason, instead of heightening the scariness of it all, Greengrass's ultra-real, ""You Are There"" documentary-style approach, felt flat.  (Particularly in the film's very first scene, which has some of the worst, most artificial dialogue I've ever heard...well, anywhere.)

Too many of the scenes are played at an exhausting fever pitch, with everyone yelling and screaming; too many of the set-pieces are drawn-out to a ridiculous length, as if we're watching events in real time.  I get that that's something of the point, and I'm sure it's all very accurate, but I was left numbed and bored.  I seem to be in the minority here -- the film just received 6 Academy Award nominations, including Best Picture --  so I expect most people will be caught up in the drama of ""Captain Phillips.""

Although it's most intently focused on the high-stress elements of the experience, which admittedly make for some gripping, powerful footage, I was most impressed with how even-handedly the film treated the Somali interlopers. While making no excuses for their actions, it successfully conveys an understanding of the pressures and motivations that would drive someone to attempt such a brazen assault and, ultimately, lends sympathy to their plight. Hanks is, predictably, excellent throughout as the stern-for-a-reason captain, though his New England accent seems to drift away with the tide as events unfold. His emotional breakdown near the end of the ordeal is particularly memorable and stirring. Although the plot doesn't cover a lot of ground, Captain Phillips is nonetheless effective at ratcheting up the drama and delivering a charged, uncomfortable, claustrophobic atmosphere.",1389916800,,1002,5.731543624161074

Perhaps you know the whole story before watching the film (that runs about 135 minutes). Even so, Captain Phillips grabs your attention and never lets go. The film is effective not only as a drama about persons who have to face great difficulties, but as a thriller and action. (The director Paul Greengrass has done two Jason Bourne movies, The Bourne Supremacy and The Bourne Ultimatum.) The suspenseful pirate attack scenes (there is more than one) alone is well worth watching.

Tom Hanks has already been praised for his marvelous performance as the captain who has to survive extreme situations with intelligence and courage. In fact, all the players in the film did excellent jobs, especially very intense Barkhad Abdi as the pirate leader Abduwali Muse.

I was so overwhelmed with emotion by the end that when Tom Hanks' character, Captain Phillips, cried so did I.  The Somali actors  were equally fantastic, especially Barkhad Abdi.

There's a lot going on psychologically with the main characters here.  The plight of both the Captain and the pirates were not lost on me.

6068103,5,B00G7M190U,"Usually, when you see a story involving special ops military action, the story is usually told in a cartoonish way.  The military is portrayed as tough, smoking cigarettes, and muscular guys that have short one liners to make them look invincible.  The bad guys, whoever they may be, are portrayed as thoughtless and heartless monsters who do not deserve your sympathy.  Captain Phillips does not employ those kind of tactics in this film.

Instead of having, cut and dry, good and bad guys, you are told a story where you realize the Somali pirates are not entirely bad human beings.  Mainly, they are poor fisherman that are just trying to survive and hijack ships out of desperation.  I'm glad it was told that way.  At the end, you are happy for the captain, but you are not blindly hating the pirates.  Kudos to the scriptwriter for not taking the easy way out.

The film, not counting credits was about two hours and ten minutes long.  It goes by pretty fast, because all the scenes are pertinent to the film.  I could not see them taking out 20-30 minutes out of the film without harming the films overall quality.  It keeps your eyes glued to the movie because, if you miss a scene, you might be missing something pertinent to the story.

In relation to the movie, the true story is somewhat different.  Also, it leaves out certain details.  Here is just a small list (Spoilers Ahead):

1.  Captain Phillips had been warned to keep at least 600 miles away from the Somali coastline.  Instead, he kept the ship at only 300 miles.  Because of that, the crew does not view him as a hero, but a person who put their lives in danger.  In fact, they are suing the shipping company over the hijacking.

2.  There is no broken glass to hurt the hijackers feet in the real story.  That was completely made up and added into the film.

3.  He never offered to let the hijackers shoot him instead of one of his crewmen.

4.  He was taken hostage in the lifeboat because of a botched prisoner exchange.  It was not because he offered to leave the ship with them.

5.  Just to expand on the first point:  The movie as well as the media portrays him as a hero, but his crew thinks the opposite.

It should be noted that Captain Phillips never portrays himself as a hero.  That part was created by Hollywood and the media.  They chose to tell the more dramatic story instead of the real one.  That is not his fault.

The film is fairly accurate but, keep in mind, some details have been added, while others removed, for the sake of creating a more dramatic story which portrays the Captain in a too heroic fashion.",1389052800,4,2607,4.4491525423728815

6068110,4,B00G7M190U,"The best thing about Paul Greengrass new action thriller Captain Phillips is that it is actually about Captain Phillips. No, this is not a joke.

Phillips is an adept ship captain for the huge shipping conglomerate Maersk. He assumes his role aboard a freighter docked in Oman bound for Kenya, and this route is straight through the Gulf of Aden, past Somali, the most pirate infested piece of ocean in the world. I assume most viewers entering the theatre already know that this film is about pirates attacking a ship. The film does fulfill this expectation in the first act, but from there everything that happens is as unpredictable as is possible to be unpredictable.

First of all, kudos to the trailers producers and marketers for selling this film as a conflict totally based upon on the hijacking of a ship. While this is the first major conflict of the film, it is not the only one. As the ships hijacking unfolds, and errors occur, whole tangential series of events and complications are created. Greengrass takes these tangents to a place we never could have expected, and all of a sudden we have an unexpected thrilling crisis of a film.

Overall its a simple story, but its so creative in its originality and unfolding that I was on the edge of my seat the whole film. Since its based on a true story I guess Greengrass shouldnt get all the credit. A lot of the credit must go to one the two scriptwriters, Richard Phillips. He adapted this script from the book that was based on true events.

Second of all, there is a storyline involving the Somalis and the world they come from. It was a great idea to include this. We are shown that Somali pirates are not just pure evil, but are in many ways forced into the acts of piracy they undertake. In a extremely revealing scene Phillips and Muse, the head pirate, reveal how higher levels of bureaucracy influences both their lives, they both have bosses they say.

In a moment of cinematic excellence, Greengrass actually makes the viewer feel sympathy for Muse despite the fact that he is a maniacal, automatic weapon toting killer who hijacks ships. Sir Greengrass, very well done.

There has been a concern over this films release though, and this raises the question that all art needs to consider: do the events of the film/artwork that declare themselves as true have an obligations to actually be true? Or can anyone declare anything and make into a work in itself?

This though comes from media attacks on the real Captain Phillips. According to The Guardian, apparently Captain Phillips himself was not the hero he is portrayed as in the film.  He was a notoriously difficult captain to work for, and by sailing too close to Somalia some say he was the cause of the whole incident. Debate aside, very good film.

9/10

Having transvered this section on ocean myself I feel a particular attraction to hijacking movies, and so I had to compare the Captain Phillips to Tobias Lindholms 2012 feature A Hijacking. Lindholms film was fantastic but in Lindholms take the onboard antics of the pirates are the focus. The Somalis were portrayed as plot devices. They reminded me of the riverboat crew  la Conrads Heart of Darkness; they were there to serve their purposes as savages, and thats it. So Unlike Greengrass portrayal, in A Hijacking we hate the pirates.

No subtitles (expect Danish to English), no frills, no action sequences, no military, just pure, raw, compelling filmmaking, with the ships cook as the main character played brilliantly by Pilou Asbk. I was worried that Greengrass saw the Lindholm film, which was an indie film on a tight budget, and decided remake it as blockbuster. I can say with complete confidence that these are two completely different films with only two real things in common, Somali pirates and ship hijackings.

A hijacking: Highly recommended!

What is particularly interesting about this flick is that it attempts to show the pirates' perspective. It introduces the viewer to the crazed hustle that defines the quest for survival by Somalian outlaws under the thralldom of crooks, who are portrayed as way worse than the pirates. The intro provides a necessary perspective that should balance the viewer's outlook all the way through the movie. I think Charles Dickens would have loved watching it!

The power of the United States Navy is displayed as it is: frighteningly awesome. The viewer feels this viscerally, thanks to wonderful cinematography, with plenty of low viewpoint shooting, showing the miserable pirate craft (a lifeboat commandeered from the MV Alabama) juxtaposed against the comparatively massive USS Bainbridge and the USS Boxer. Attention has been well paid to generating a feel for onboard living conditions, especially from the pirates' perspective.

I was left feeling both harrowed and triumphant in a sort of hollow way. I am still musing over the implications of the human conditions that lead to stories such as this.

Tom Hanks, as Phillips is experienced and calm, but profoundly believable - his increasing stress and ultimate expression of his condition of shock are emotionally cathartic. As always, Hanks delivers an outstanding performance.

Barkhad Abdi's Muse is no ""Jack Sparrow,"" for Abdi's playing a real desperado, rather than a romantic and lovable rogue. Muse is entirely on the edge, completely committed to a challenge that is entirely out of his league. Abdi expresses Muse's leadership in such a way that we see a desperate young man demonstrating remarkable poise and commitment in the face of ever growing and insurmountable odds. The hollow staring of the eyes, the restrained frustration, the hints of kindness, the shreds of hope that he carries... these Abdi acts out so wonderfully. I am left feeling empathetic. It troubles me...

I wonder... is Muse not much better off now? In a sense, perhaps he ended up more free than before. Maybe he hit a Third World ""jackpot"".

Tom Hanks gave an amazing performance and should get an Oscar for this film.  His portrayal was at the top of his game, the directing was great and it was an ""edge of the seat"" movie.

6068114,4,B00G7M190U,"""Captain Phillips"" (2013 release; 133 min.) brings the real life story of Captain Rich Phillips and his crew aboard the Maersk Alabama on their way delivering cargo from Oman to Kenya in April, 2009. That journey requires them to go through the Somali basin, where ship hijackings have become a huge problem. In a parallel story line, we are introduced to a group of Somalis who have only one thing on their minds: to attack cargo ships and demand ransom for the crew. Phillips, aware of the dangers, is preparing his ship and his crew for the possibility of a pirate attack and everyone participates in security drills. It isn't long before several boats with Somalis appear on the horizon, heading for the Maersk Alabama.... At this point we are about 30 min. into the movie, but to tell you more would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Couple of comments: this is a rousing adventure movie from start to finish. The fact that it is based on a true story makes it even more compelling. No wonder then that this movie is directed by Paul Greengrass, who has brought us several other top-notch action/adventure movies (The Bourne Supremacy/Ultimatum; Green Zone) as well as the 9/11 movie United 93. Tom Hanks as Captain Phillips delivers his best role in years. I will admit that I hesitated long and hard before I finally went to see it just this past weekend, because only months ago I saw another movie dealing with modern day piracy off the coast of Somali and also based on true events: ""A Hijacking"" (2012 release from Denmark) played briefly in theatres in the US and is now available on DVD/Blu-ray. Contrary to ""Captain Phillips"", it is NOT an action/adventure movie, but rather a psychological thriller, focusing on the negotiations between the Somali pirates and the Danes. It is an incredible movie as well, and I recommend that you seek it out.

Bottom line: I was pleasantly surprised with ""Captain Phillips"", perhaps because it is so different, both in style and substance, from ""A Hijacking"". I would not be surprised at all if ""Captain Phillips"" does very well in the upcoming awards season, and deservedly so. ""Captain Phillips"" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",1387065600,2,2227,4.81201044386423

Tom Hanks plays really well too.
I also liked the fact that the pirates are not just ""bad guys"" - the movie shows where the pirates are coming from, and kind of makes a point that they don't really have a choice.

6068116,3,B00G7M190U,"This movie has two interesting things in it: Tom Hanks and the ship.  Most of the movie feels like a discovery channel ""build it bigger"" episode the way the director shows the outside/inside/inner workings of the ship throughout the movie.  There's so much photography of the ship that I was thinking the studio should market a Captain Philips Maersk Alabama model ship or something like that.

As for the story, its basically a retelling of the events of the Somali pirate hijacking a few years ago.  At the time the movie was released there was talk of how the crew was displeased with the movie/book and that the captain was not quite as sympathetic as portrayed by Tom Hanks.  I can understand their point of view; sometimes I felt like his character was overdoing it with the understanding and compassionate approach he had towards the pirates.  At other times, when the pirates are riding their motor boats towards to ship it felt like I was watching the Waterworld stunt show at Universal.

Nonetheless the movie draws you in as your watching, as you see the pirates overtake the ship and began a fierce search for crew members throughout the ship.  There's many shots of intense conversation between the pirates and Hanks, while the vastness of the ocean is shown in the background.

This is not the most intense or exciting movie, but doable for a Saturday night.  While it may not be a movie that you would watch over and over, it is worth a viewing or two.",1386633600,7,1467,4.651162790697675

This movie is based on the true story about a guy named Richard Phillips who is a captain of a ship. Pirates come and take the captain as hostage. Eventually he is stuck on a life boat with the pirates and the captain just wants to see his family again. Luckily the navy comes but they don't want to hurt Captain Phillips so they try to trick the pirates. The movie is very intense and I was on edge the whole time.

The main characters in the movie are Captain Richard Phillips (Tom Hanks), Muse (Barkhad Abdi), Bilal (BArkhad Abdirahman), Najee (Faysal Ahmen), and Elmi Mahat M. Ali). My favorite character in this movie is Captain Phillips because he is really nice and he would rather sacrifice his own life for his crew. That shows how much he cares about other people. It really made me think about what I would do in this type of situation.

My favorite part in the movie is when they capture the captain because thats when the action really starts. Its not good that he gets captured but you see a lot of action after that. You see the navy show up, you hear threats from the pirates, you see helicopters in the air. Everything goes crazy! But thats what I love about these kinds of movies.

I recommend this movie for ages 12 and up because this movie is really scary and has a lot of violence and parts that are bloody. It is rated pg-13 so I wouldnt recommend it for younger kids.

6068121,5,B00G7M190U,"The hallmark of a great performance is if the actor can convince us that they are not acting at all, and have become the person they are portraying. (some Tom Hanks, as he has many times before, does just that as Captain Philips. He is every bit the captain of the Maersk Alabama, carrying out the mundane but important daily chores of looking after the ship and the welfare of the crew. One has the sense of the responsibilities on his shoulders and the distance he needs to keep from the crew.  Once the ship is boarded by the Somali pirates, we see the professional in his character, protecting the crew and his human side trying to stay clear of harm's way and convince his inexperienced captors that they are in something way over their heads.  The scene when Captain Philips has been captured is riveting and the scene when he has been free, Mr. Hanks remarkably portrays the emotions that the real captain probably felt.  This is a marvelous performance that demands to be seen.

The same excellence is true with the actors portraying the pirates, even more remarkable that none of them had any acting experience. Barkhad Abdi is excellent as Muse, the leader of the pirates, as are Barkhad Abdirahman,  Faysal Ahmed and Mahat M. Ali. They are frighteningly unpredictable but also nave and trusting when they should be doubtful.

Direct Paul Greengrass does a splendid job telling this true story.  The story is moving and riveting. The scenes where the US Navy and Seals are engaged in freeing Captain Philips are told with military precision itself, with the audience being impressed with the professionalism and determination of our armed forces.

Had it not been for the world media, the Internet, and Blitzer this would have indeed been a film worth watching. Even if you have been living under a rock, Tom Hanks projects enough impending doom into the film, that I was wondering why they were missing the ominous horror music.

Don't get me wrong, the acting was top notch and deserves recognition. However, I do not enjoy every well acted film. The film itself brings no new revelation to what happened in the incident. Indeed, if anything the film towed the administration's line and ignored controversial details that have since emerged, like ""what happened to the money?"" and the alleged multiple shots that were fired into each pirate, including those done after boarding the boat.

Writer Billy Ray (Hunger Games, Flight Plan) did an amazing adaption of the book written by Richard Phillips and Stephen Talty and made the sea adventure extremely feel real, intense and packed with emotion.

Tom Hanks (Forrest Gump, Philadelphia) does a tour-de-force performance (again), especially at the end, of a ship's Captain who makes quick and rational decisions in the forbodding  inevitable face of real deadly danger that is approaching his ship. Based on a real happening, the story is a simple one, but how it unfolds is dramatic, energetic and quite often `hold-your-breadth' thrilling. Peaking at an emotional climax at the end where you'll be relieved and overwhelmed with the outcome of the entire adventure.

This is a truly adventurous thrill ride of fear and anticipation. Tom Hanks is just amazing to watch and completely real in his convictions for his character. From his basic love of his wife played by Catherine Keener (40 Year Old Virgin, Into The Wild) as he leaves his home to take his ship, to the calming `take control of the situation' attitude when the threat of looming boats, just two miles from the ship, are getting closer, to the intense direction and misdirection toward the pirate crew who actually board his ship to take control of it.

The real adventure occurs when Hanks is tricked off his own boat onto the lifeboat and taken as a hostage with thirty thousand dollars from the ships safe. There are moments of anguish, fear and competition amongst the pirates and it's when the US Navy and Navy Seals are brought in to defuse the situation that your heart doesn't stop pounding.

Basically it's about a band of pirates want to take over a barge and sell its cargo and hold hostage its crew, all done miles off the coast of Africa. Hanks is the captain of the boat and with a minimal crew he learns how to survive with only his experience, wits and a desire to live for his wife as his tools.

With this being their first motion picture credit, Barkhad Abdi playing the Pirate Captain,  Barkhad  Abdirahman playing the wildly crazy eyed `first mate' and the young teenager Mahat M. Ali do an incredible job of playing a rogue band of pirates trying to steal a 30 million dollar barge filled with cargo and food. The three men are as intense and focused as Hanks is making the scenes that much more dramatic to watch,

This is such a wonderful film and very dramatic in its realism that you forget your just watching this film and not part of it. It has some really intense moments coupled with some extremely emotional outcomes and will leave you relived when it's all said and done. Mr. Hanks has done it again.

6068129,4,B00G7M190U,"About four years ago an American freight ship was hijacked off the coast of Somalia, and pirates attempted to extort a ridiculous ransom. Ultimately the US government directed a rescue mission involving Navy seals, recovered the ship, and killed the pirates.

Except that is not exactly what happened, and we now have a gripping movie telling the true story of what happened to Captain Phillips.

Tom Hanks excels as the Captain, dealing with these sometimes hysterical, often irrational pirates who make unrealistic demands for money, and persist in their demands to the point of folly, with the only weapons at his disposal, his wits.

If any pirate should dare to watch this movie, they will learn a very cautionary tale about messing with American ships in International waters, and more importantly messing with the military might of the American government.

If you're like me you may be surprised at the level and style of defense of the freighter given the prevalence of piracy incidents around Somalia, that enabled a large freighter ship to be taken over by only four pirates, and unusual measures the ship took. How four pirates were able to actually to get this ship is a wonder to behold.

There is no Captain Jack Sparrow, no peg legs, no pieces of eight, or bottles of rum in this movie. What we have instead is the gritty reality of piracy, and pirates, and the sense that human life has no value to them.

What I like about Captain Phillips the character is that he is in his element, and in control of his ship. The pirates are never able to get control, because the crew is dispersed and hidden, and without arms yet able to resourcefully counter the pirates attempts.  Tom Hanks gives another nomination worthy performance.

Captain Phillips is not so much a struggle between pirates and sailors but between entirely different ways of life, and systems. When Captain Phillips offer them the $30,000 in the ships safe, one wonders why they did not take that, and call it a good days work. But no, one can see how their choices pave the way to tragedy, greed being the fatal propeller.

I found this movie to be much better than I anticipated, and I loved the acting of the pirate Muse, the gaunt leader of the pirates, whose very gauntness appears menacing.

One strange response I had to the movie was that about two third of the way through the movie when the action moves to a lifeboat, I began to feel queasy, not understanding why. I realized I was getting from watching all the heaving motion on a forty foot screen, filmed with somewhat jerky hand held cameras.

I put my hands over my eyes for several minutes, stealing the occasional peek when I could, until the feeling passed. I imagine you will not experience the same problem watching on a large screen tv as in a theater, but if you decided to watch this while still in release, bring some dramamine or cover your eyes if necessary.

So, my takeaway from this movie is that it's not about the motion of the ocean or the size of the ship, it's about the size of the navy you have supporting you, and it's about your own personal resourcefulness in dealing with danger. An interesting fact is that the leader of the pirates asked to be tried as a juvenile, claiming he was 15 or 16 at the time.  He later admitted to being 18.

I understand that the shipping company's was sued by some members of the crew claiming the company and Phillips recklessly and knowingly ignored piracy reports, and allowed the ship to sail in pirate infested waters.

I think you will enjoy, as it is quite gripping. If you are prone to seasickness, you might prefer to wait for the dvd.",1383350400,4,3646,4.613601236476043
6068130,5,B00G7M190U,"Captain Phillips, (2013). A biographical  and action/adventure flick, this is the true story of Captain Richard Phillips and the 2009 hijacking by Somali pirates of the US-flagged MV Maersk Alabama, the first American cargo ship to be hijacked in two hundred years.  It is based upon the book A CAPTAINS DUTY: SOMALI PIRATES, NAVY SEALS, AND DANGEROUS DAYS AT SEA by Richard Phillips.  Screenplay was by Billy Ray; direction by British Paul Greengrass, acclaimed master of suspense, when logically there should be none, see UNITED  93, the Bourne films.

To quote Sony Pictures Entertainment, the releasing studio, as reprinted at IMDb:

Captain Phillips is a multi-layered examination of the 2009 hijacking of the U.S. container ship Maersk Alabama by a crew of Somali pirates. It is - through director Paul Greengrass's distinctive lens - simultaneously a pulse-pounding thriller, and a complex portrait of the myriad effects of globalization. The film focuses on the relationship between the Alabama's commanding officer, Captain Richard Phillips (two time Academy Award-winner Tom Hanks), and the Somali pirate captain, Muse (Barkhad Abdi), who takes him hostage. Phillips and Muse are set on an unstoppable collision course when Muse and his crew target Phillips' unarmed ship; in the ensuing standoff, 145 miles off the Somali coast, both men will find themselves at the mercy of forces beyond their control.

Hanks ably carries the picture  in another Oscar-worthy performance.  Bdi, portraying Muse, powerfully balances Hanks.  Catherine Keener is featured in a small part as Andrea Phillips, the Captains wife.  The movie  is 134 minutes of pure, heart-stopping suspense.  Though, logically speaking, we know that Phillips survived.  Also, logically speaking, we know that this handful of pirates as portrayed, half-dressed, probably hardly half-fed and educated, stoned on khat, and probably no better off than their pirate ancestors of centuries ago, who inspired the line the shores of Tripoli, in the U.S. Marine anthem, cannot possibly prevail against the might of the twenty-first century U.S. Navy.  Which has clearly spent millions of dollars in men and materiel to ensure that the captain is freed.  Nevertheless, the film left me limp.

Here's the scoop. Captain Phillips (Tom Hanks) is on his way to Northern Africa to captain a Maersk cargo ship through a familiar route. During the trip they are set upon by pirates and the ensuing drama will wrap its hands around your throat and won't let go.

Paul Greengrass has a strong history as a director and there seems to be no stopping him. This is some powerful stuff. And he had a strong script to work with. First off: The bad guys here aren't ""bad guys."" These are poor North Africans being hired for a ruthless task by others unseen. You get the impression that whatever money they make is nothing compared to what those who hired them are making. They just want to get through this but they're in over their heads. Then there's Phillips. Hanks is a seasoned professional and it shows here. One of his final scenes is so powerful it, alone, is worth the price of admission. He's a by the books guy. He's not overly strict with his men but he's not their buddy either. He expects them to do as he asks. He's also clever. He pulls a couple of tricks that help him and his men in this difficult situation. Then there's Greengrass. This is no slick Hollywood outing. There is a lot of hand held camera and natural light which helps draw the viewer into the action. You feel as though you are there with them. And it's not overwrought. That grip on your throat tightens and loosens regularly, allowing you to catch your breath.

6068133,3,B00G7M190U,"This is a heartwarming tale of a Somali pirate who finally realizes his dream of coming to America.

Throughout the movie he says to himself, if he is strong and believes in himself (paraphrase), everything will turn out right. And it does. Kind of.

OK. Seriously, though. First, be aware that this film may be a whitewash of the real Captain Phillips; his crew says they in fact warned him repeatedly about entering pirated waters, but he ignored them. And so on. I don't know whom to believe, but just FYI.

Second, the good Captain does things which don't make sense. He ignores the warning of his crew that the first encounter will be followed-up, and they should haul, er, butt. He says if they do, they'll run into other pirates anyway. This decision allows the pirates to catch up. Then, after telling the crew to hide and under no circumstances be captured to be held hostage, he stays on the bridge and ... is held hostage.

Third, he is constantly saying things to his captors which would probably irritate them rather than calm them down. Look for these nuggets. I cringed each time.

Otherwise, this film is suspenseful, not exactly action-packed, but thrilling nevertheless. This is due in no small part to the actors who play the wild-eyed pirates, looking scary as all get-out. You see how they're recruited into a ruthless, greedy pirate ring, constantly demanding and yelling and threatening. You feel a bit sorry for them.

They say they're forced into this life because of big fishing boats which get all their fish. I don't know if this is true or not. But they apparently use this as their excuse for violence and theft.

You get to see how comedically useless the ""non-lethal"" defenses of a big ship are against pirates - they blithely weave in between water jets and shoot open pirate cages.

And we sympathize with the crew, who complain that they are unarmed against dangerous thugs. We can pontificate all day about how un-nice it is to have armed security on ships, but I guarantee the day you spot a skiff of armed criminals on course with your ship, you'll be wishing you had a bazooka - certainly after watching this team of khat-addled goons.

You'll see the full force of the US Navy swing into action to rescue this one man. And you'll make no mistake - these are the good guys. And consummate professionals, carrying out what seems a convoluted plan (what's that with making big wakes, stopping the tow, etc.?).

There is more waiting than I had expected. There is Jason Bourne Jerky-Cam in the lifeboat, which might make you seasick. Nothing actually happens a lot of the time there, just some threatening and panicking. The Captain's interactions with the pirates there seem somewhat random and without any real plan, except to apparently antagonize them more.

There is a semi-happy ending, as the pirate team lead, Muse, makes his way to the United States.

I enjoyed it, but it's not a five-star movie to me. This is partly due to all the hype around it as an action-packed thriller. Maybe 3.5?",1383004800,5,3034,4.703773584905661

He demands money, and lots of it, and next thing you know there is an all-out war as these seaman tear off their shirts, exposing their pulsating chest muscles, and race throughout the ship, taking out pirates left and right.  Willis, who appeared old and weathered on the outset, turns out to be in better shape than he's ever been in his life and the finale centers on a meticulously choreographed fight sequence between him and Will Smith where he spews some one-liners and winds up single handedly rewriting history.

I shudder at the thought of what this movie would have turn into, had someone like Michael Bay directed it.

Thankfully, we don't really have to think much about that, since Michael Bay did NOT direct this.  Paul Greengrass did, and while Greengrass has had his fair-share of directing action films (those Bourne sequels), he's done so with grit and class, and he's also managed to formulate some really interesting `adult' films (`United 93' still makes a serious impact on me).  He's smart, and he understands that creating tension does not have to revolve around the obvious.

`Captain Phillips' snuck up on me.  I was walking into this with some intrigue but little expectation.  The reviews were strong, but I hadn't really read any of them.  I only knew of their status through word of mouth.  My biggest hesitation drew from the fact that Tom Hanks is an actor I just don't get.  He's attained this reputation in the industry as one of the greatest actors to ever live, and yet I've been largely underwhelmed by his career.  I consider his two Oscar wins to be two of the worst in the history of the Oscars, and I just, as a whole, don't find him very compelling.  That isn't to say that I've never liked him, for I have on occasion (his ease and naturalness in `That Thing You Do' was a great moment for him), but overall I just don't care for him.  So, to hear that this is his career best didn't mean much to me; at the time.

Now that I've seen the film I have to say that I'm speechless as to the power he brings to EVERY moment of this performance, and those final twenty minutes are some of the best acting I've ever seen put to film, by anyone.

The film tells the true story of Richard Phillips, the captain of the MV Maersk Alabama, a US cargo ship sailing to bring supplies to Africa.  While passing through Somalia waters they are hijacked by Somali pirates.  The danger of pirates had become a real thing over the past few months, and it was something that Captain Phillips was aware of and cautious about, but it wasn't anything any of them were really prepared for (it had never happened to an American ship before).  Just when it seemed like they had avoided the worst, one persistent pirate by the name of Muse winds up getting aboard the ship, and from there things take a drastic turn.

I have to admit that I was really unaware of a lot of this story.  I remember when it happened, but I don't remember the details and so some of the shifts in this film and the plot details took me by surprise, in a good way.  For over two hours, this film had me trying desperately to breathe.  By the end, I was literally shaking in my seat.  The intensity level of this film is hard for me to describe, but I told my wife when we left (who was sobbing by the end of the film) that I had never felt like that while watching a movie.  It isn't the same feeling of intensity when watching a scary film or an average adventure epic.  There was such brutal honesty to each frame that the heightened empathy felt for Captain Phillips was something I almost couldn't bare up under.  Watching his plight felt almost too real, too authentic.

His emotional breakdown (""Can you see this?"") is choking me up right now, just thinking about it.

This has already been a great year for film, and `Captain Phillips' is up there at the top.  It fuses genres together with precision yet an ease that makes the whole thing feel genuine, never forced.  The action is there, but the intensity of the film transcends that aspect and really lives and breathes in the moments (and large segments) where the action is non-existent.  The dedicated performances by the entire cast, but more notably by Hanks and Abdi, really bring an earnest authenticity to this film.  I said to my wife when we left the theater that I had NEVER seen fear so honestly depicted on film than while watching Tom Hanks react to the pirate intruders.  Greengrass's decision to keep the American cast from meeting the African actors before filming began was a smart choice, for it added an authenticity you can't fake.

Another thing I really appreciated about this film, and something that I think should be noted, is that the treatment of the pirates was very astute.  Muse, while terrifying, has an actual arc (however subtle it may be) and helps create a well-rounded portrayal of the truth.  While their actions are never condoned, you can sense a personal desperation, and when Phillips pleads with visible anger (""You're not just a fisherman!"") you can sense a backstory that holds Muse to his profession and his course of action.  Like he said, he's gone too far now.

This has become the biggest surprise of my `film year' so far, and I'm ecstatic at how excellent this film really is.  Technically perfect, with a pitch perfect cast and a resounding finale that will lift your spirits but never in a heavy handed way (such devastating honesty), this is a film you CANNOT MISS!",1382918400,67,5967,4.520969245107176
6068135,3,B00G7M190U,"I would give this film 5 stars for acting. Tom Hanks is excellent, particularly near the end of the film, where he gives another oscar-worthy performance.  I would give it at least 4 stars for screenplay.

Unfortunately, I'd have to give it 1 star (the minimum) for cinematography. Yes, we get it, the action takes place at sea and it's a very chaotic situation. But it was definitely overkill with the hand-held cameras. Continuous hand-held camera work might have been watchable if they had at least tried to keep the shots steady, but they obviously went out of their way to keep moving the camera around in nearly every hand-held shot, in some misguided effort towards verisimilitude. That, combined with the trendy post-MTV method of frequenting cutting to the next shot every two seconds, before the viewer can focus on the current shot, made the film literally unwatchable (although I stayed to the end for my companion's sake and tried to watch as much as I could.).

Bottom line, I agree with Crosscut.com Seattle reviewer Rustin Thompson who said ""Pass the dramamine"" and ""Tom Hanks needs to work with a better director.""

With all the quality elements present, this could have been a truly great film, if the director had simply filmed the story, taking minimal care to make it watchable for the viewer, instead of trying so hard to be tricky with the camera work. An audience will generally accept the reality of the plot line, even without total authenticity, if not constantly distracted by the camera work.

6068137,5,B00G7M190U,"In the opening scene of Captain Phillips, Tom Hanks' character, Rich Phillips, has a frank conversation with his wife Andrea (Catherine Keener) while they drive to the airport.  As a teacher, I took special note of this conversation, as it pertained to Phillips' concern regarding his son's performance in school.  He tells his wife that he's worried that the world is far more competitive than it used to be and that even putting in the minimum is not enough to rise above and have a chance at success.  I've delivered various versions of this message to my high school students and while this conversation stood out to me for a different reason than it will to many other theatergoers, this seemingly innocuous scene sets the tone for a far more substantial and contextual film than I had expected.

Adapted from Richard Phillips' memoir, Captain Phillips tells the somewhat well-known true story of an American cargo ship hijacked by Somali pirates in the Spring of 2009.  The surprisingly rapid turnaround between original incident and major film production speaks volumes to the merits of the story.  The film presents a form of ""bio-pic"" that forgoes the melodramatic retelling of fact, and instead uses real life to make a statement, in this case about globalization.  Director Paul Greengrass (The Bourne Supremacy and The Bourne Ultimatum), aims his ""shaky"" camera not only at the heroic protagonist, but also at what leads these Somali pirates to take such risky action.  By the time the pirates board Phillips' ship, we are thoroughly disturbed and authentically frightened for what they may be capable of doing to take over the vessel.  The four pirates are meticulously realized through some menacing bilingual performances by a group of first-time Somali actors.  As the film unfolds, their story and motivations are every bit as fascinating and gripping as those of Phillips and his crew.  Phillips' opening conversation with his wife about the stresses of competition and the vanishing opportunities for those less fortunate becomes realized as we see this despair front and center.

Tom Hanks is sure to earn an Oscar nomination for his performance in this film.  In fact, this may be the performance of his career, certainly his best since Philadelphia.  His pragmatic performance is captivating, and he is never over-the-top.  In a scene where Muse, the lead pirate, invades the cargo ship's control room, Phillips squares off with the pirates for the first time.  Hanks responds to this scenario so well and so realistically that it is easy to forget that this is a movie and not real life.  As the film goes on, Hanks tempers his performance for every new development culminating in a scene towards the end that is nothing short of brilliant, heartbreaking, and stirring.

Captain Phillips is another great movie for 2013.  While the story is still relatively current and many film-goers will be aware of its outcome, Greengrass, Hanks, and the supporting cast ensure a thrilling experience.  The film also works on a deeper level by examining the motives of the pirates and theorizing about some of the policies that should, perhaps, be revisited regarding freighter security measures and the ""acceptable"" risks that are taken for the sake of transporting goods overseas.  The film resonates with vivacity but Hanks' performance is the film's true strength.  A-

6068141,5,B00G7M190U,"It's not likely that anyone anticipated the possibility of high-seas piracy coming back into style in the post-9/11 world.  But that's what befell the crew of the American cargo ship ""Maersk Alabama"" in April 2009, when four Somali pirates took over their vessel, resulting in a three-day ordeal in which the captain of the ship, Richard Phillips, was held hostage for a $10 million ransom.  That ransom was never paid; and a team of Navy Seals managed to end the crisis by killing the four pirates, who had been holding Phillips hostage in an escape boat less than two hundred miles from the Somali coast.  Phillips and his crew, however, all survived the horrific ordeal, shaken but alive.  This is the true story told in CAPTAIN PHILLIPS, the 2013 docudrama about perhaps the best-known instance of high seas terrorism in our present context.

Effectively directed by Paul Greengrass, whose penchant for docudrama was perhaps best established in the much-lauded, and intense, 2006 9/11 film UNITED 93, CAPTAIN PHILLIPS stars Tom Hanks in the title role, of the captain who, aware that armed Somali pirates were present in the waters of the Indiana Ocean some six hundred miles east of Somalia, urges his crew to keep a lookout for any skiffs that seem to contain armed men.  One such group, led by Barkhad Abdi, approaches them; but through some skillful maneuvers, they manage to evade them.  The next day, however, the ""Maersk Alabama"" isn't so lucky.  Armed with automatic weaponry and with a better knowledge of American cargo ship tactics, Abdi and his four companions board the ship and hold Hanks and a few others hostage (this while Hanks has managed to get the rest of his crew below deck and out of sight).  When one of the hijackers gets his foot badly injured by broken glass, Hanks urges them to get help, and leaves with them in the ship's escape boat.  The pirates believe that Hanks is willing to be a hostage in an act of self-sacrifice; but all along, his crew on the ""Maersk Alabama"" are tailing him and his captors; and the decision is made from Washington to end the crisis by the use of the Navy's elite Seal Team Six (the same one that would, in 2011, track down and kill Osama Bin-Laden).  It all comes down to a fierce confrontation within a hundred miles of the Somali coastline.

Greengrass' great specialty is in bringing back the idea of documentary-style realism to the cinema, which had proven to be highly successful in his own 2002 opus BLOODY SUNDAY (which was based on the 1972 crackdown of the Irish Republican Army by the British).  In UNITED 93, he told in very stark terms the terrifying saga of the one plane hijacked on 9/11 that didn't reach its intended target because the passengers of that flight fought back against their Al-Qaeda captors.  That same sense of realism infuses CAPTAIN PHILLIPS, with Greengrass and his director of photography Barry Ackroyd doing things largely in the same documentary, almost cinema verite, style that had worked for BLOODY SUNDAY and UNITED 93, resulting in a film that, even if it doesn't surpass UNITED 93, comes very close to it.  But just as much of the success of CAPTAIN PHILLIPS is owed to the incredible Everyman performance of Hanks in the title role.  His ability to do the Everyman role, exemplified in his portrayal of astronaut Jim Lovell in the 1995 Ron Howard classic APOLLO 13, works out quite well for him; and Abdi makes for a particularly great adversary.  There is a real sense of Greengrass, as he had done on UNITED 93 (as well as Hanks on APOLLO 13) of not wanting to do everything in CAPTAIN PHILLIPS as your typical Hollywood action blockbuster, and the end result, along with an intense score by Henry Jackman (which also interpolates the climactic cue of John Powell's score for UNITED 93) being the icing on this cake, is a tremendous piece.

6068143,4,B00G7M190U,"I was a huge Tom Hanks fan in the 1990s and the early part of the 2000s, but it's been a while since he turned in an exceptional performance. I enjoyed The Da Vinci Code and Angels & Demons, but Hanks hasn't been great since Cast Away 12 years ago. After hearing the early buzz about Captain Phillips, I was hoping one of my favorite actors would return to peak form.

Although Hanks didn't put a foot wrong, I came away a little disappointed. Let me explain why.

We meet Rich Phillips (Hanks) as he is driving to the airport with his wife, Andrea (Catherine Keener). This introduction is somewhat brief, and Catherine Keener plays no further part in the movie. What it does do is allow us to see how Phillips prepares for a trip. He's aware of the dangers of piracy, but he's an experienced man.

The next characters we meet are the pirates. This introduction is a much longer segment, and is extremely chaotic. We learn that life is hard for these Somali pirates and that they have bosses that they have to answer to. These people felt like standard villains to me, and we end up knowing little about them despite the length of time spent showing us their homeland. They talk in heavy accents when they do speak  English, and they have bad teeth. Yep, these are the people we are supposed to hate.

Some of the most impressive scenes in the movie happen near the beginning as we see Phillips go about his routine. Hanks is particularly good at playing understated roles, and he's completely believable. The tone changes when the inevitable meeting with the pirates occurs. If you were to sit down and guess what kind of things might happen from this point, you would probably be pretty close. I know the movie is supposed to be based on real events, so I can't deduct points for lack of originality, but there aren't many surprises.

I'm not going to delve into the plot beyond these scenes which all take place in the first 30 minutes. Anything more would venture too deeply into spoiler territory.

Paul Greengrass also directed The Bourne Supremacy and The Bourne Ultimatum, which are among the best action movies I own. If you are familiar with those, it won't surprise you to learn that Greengrass employs similar techniques in Captain Phillips. He tries to enhance the action by showing extreme closeups and point of view shots, intended to place us right in the middle of the action. You can also expect to see plenty of shaky cam effects. Although this worked quite well, it will definitely annoy some viewers.

Captain Phillips is a tense account of what can happen in dangerous waters. When you see all of the events transpire, you might be wondering whether it wouldn't be cheaper and safer to hire a few armed guards if you're transporting cargo through the region in question. The ultimate resolution was infinitely more expensive.

I'm happy enough with Captain Phillips, and will be adding it to my collection, but I'm still waiting for a role meaty enough to extract another Oscar-worthy performance from Tom Hanks. Don't avoid it, but temper expectations a little.

6068147,4,B00G7M190U,"The story of ""Captain Phillips"" was huge news in 2009 as a large container ship, the MV Maersk Alabama, was boarded by pirates off the coast of Somalia. In an age of rampant terrorism, the story was headline news and was so highly publicized that the President of the United States got involved, along with the Navy Seals. To many, it was shocking news that this sort of thing happens. Pirates? Really? These aren't Jack Sparrow, Captain Hook type pirates, these are desperate, vicious, poor pirates in small boats with nothing to lose. These are pirates who are for the most part, under orders of bigger controlling groups who pray upon the desperate lifestyles of the Somali people.

Much has been said about the accuracy of the book written by Captain Phillips,  ""A Captain's Duty: Somali Pirates, Navy Seals, and Dangerous Days at Sea"" and now the movie, ""Captain Phillips"". In fact, many of the crew of the Maersk Alabama are now suing Captain Phillips for wantonly and arrogantly putting them in danger. They are telling stories that completely contradict much of what you see in the film leading up to the pirates boarding their ship. This to me is extremely disappointing if their stories are true. I believe it is irresponsible for movie-makers to misrepresent history. Many people take the easy way out when learning about history and movies leave a huge impression on their minds.

That being said, I assume that most of the movie is completely accurate as most of what happened after the pirates boarded is documented by news outlets and the Navy Seals. Director Paul Greengrass handled the true story with a realistic eye. He's made a niche for himself with 7-true story films, the most recognizable of those being ""United 93"". His staging of events is engrossing, vivid and at times tough to watch.

""Captain Phillips"" is listed as an action/thriller, but those viewing the film would be quick to mention that this movie shouldn't be lumped in with the typical action movie. I would consider ""Captain Phillips"" more a drama than an action/thriller.  You are side by side Captain Phillips (Tom Hanks) through this realistic and horrible incident with pirates who cannot be accused of being intelligent, but are certainly without a morale code or an alternative to their actions.

The movie is tough to watch at times and possibly a little long, but for the most part it is an amazing look inside one of the biggest news stories of 2009. The pirates, although portrayed realistically are infuriating to watch and annoying to watch. From beginning to end they are amazingly fool-minded, disorganized and constantly angrily yelling. I agree that these portrayal's are probably extremely accurate, but as a movie, they are like listening to 10 people yelling different stories at each other for over an hour.

""Captain Phillips"" is not for everybody and there's a reason why the creators called this an action/thriller. If they told you what it really was, you probably wouldn't go. ""Captain Phillips"" is not fun to watch and far from thrilling. It is not filled with harrowing and exciting bravery at every corner. It is not filled with twists and turns. It is a dirty, difficult and drudging film that tells the story of real people in a horrible and real situation. If you like that sort of thing, go see it.",1381708800,5,3320,4.855123674911661
6068148,5,B00G7M190U,"Paul Greengrass' Captain Phillips is the story of a 2009 incident that most people probably still remember, when a group of Somali pirates boarded an American cargo freighter, the Maersk Alabama, and after failing to gain control of the ship, took its captain, Richard Phillips, hostage, resulting in the US Navy mounting an intense rescue operation to recover Captain Phillips. Directed by Greengrass (United 93, The Bourne Ultimatum) from a script by Billy Ray (Breach, The Hunger Games) based on a book written by Phillips and Stephan Talty about the incident, Captain Phillips is a well-crafted, tense docu-drama that captures the intensity of the events as they played out, from the moment the Maersk Alabama first sees the approaching pirate crafts to the moment when Navy Seals make their assault, ending the situation with deadly finality and the successful rescue.

More than anything else, the core of Captain Phillips is the contest of wills that takes place between Phillips (a finely nuanced performance by veteran Tom Hanks) and the pirate leader Muse (an amazingly intense performance by first-time actor Barkhad Abdi). Phillips is determined to do everything he can to keep the pirates from gaining control of the ship and to keep his crew from being captured and held hostage, while Muse is determined to succeed in achieving the pirates' version of the American dream, against all odds and no matter what risks he and his men must take. Hanks' Phillips is a man who desperately hangs on to his sense of calm in the face of mounting danger because he knows it's his - and his crew's - only path to safety. And survival. Abdi's Muse is more complex. On the one hand, he displays a relentless cunning and daring, combined with the ability to take the lead, that invites your unwilling admiration even as he engages in threats and brutality to gain and keep control of the situation. But at the same time, he shows an incredible naivety about just what he is doing, not thinking beyond securing his catch of the day. At one point he tells an astonished Phillips of his plan to go to America with the money he'll get from the ransom and buy a car. There is also a certain hubris about Muse that makes his character at least pitiable if not actually sympathetic as things begin to go wrong and he feels his control - and his chances for his big score - rapidly slipping away from him. This is most particularly brought home in the form of an increasingly unstable pirate named Najee (Faysal Ahmed) whom Muse had hand-picked for the operation but who now is threatening to kill their hostage.

The musical score by Henry Jackman (X-Men: First Class, Kick-Ass) is very well done, adding to the sense of rising tension without distracting from what is happening on the screen. And in addition to the music, Greengrass makes excellent use of sound, particularly the sounds of a ship gone dead in the water, creating a sense of an alien space that the pirates have invaded when they go searching for the crew, each random creak and clang breaking the silence wearing at the pirates' khat-frayed nerves. (Note: khat is a plant native to the region whose leaves, when chewed, act as an amphetamine-like stimulant, and all of the pirates are seen chewing khat since the operation began).

Highly, highly recommended for anyone who enjoys a taut thriller that will keep your attention  gripped to the screen for its entire 134 minutes.",1381622400,211,3438,4.812182741116751
6068149,5,B00G7M190U,"Theatrical review.  There may be spoilers.

Director Paul Greengrass rarely disappoints, whether it's with his two ""Bourne"" movies or with the OMG ""United 93.""  Because the film is based on real events, the film has feel of dramatic accuracy, similar to ""United 93.""  And like that film, this one has a mix of veteran actors and an effective group of newbies.

Tom Hanks is the veteran actor who really counts.  He has another memorable performance as Phillips, the captain of a U. S. flagged freighter.  He and his crew are caught off the Somali coast and, after some heroic efforts, are ultimately boarded by a handful of armed pirates.  Most filmmakers would likely have eschewed any back story of how those pirates got to a profession of taking cargo and crew as hostages, but Greengrass and screenwriter Billy Ray take the time to see how fishermen become criminals.  It doesn't make what they do any more acceptable, but does give us an understanding.

Greengrass keeps the audience wrapped up tight as the pirates search the ship for the hiding crew.  Only Phillips and 2 crewmen from the bridge are being held.  Phillips is calm and does his best to keep his crew safe.  Tension mounts as the Somalis led by Muse (remarkable Barkhad Abdi) take Phillips and $30K (from the safe) into the ocean inside a capsule-like lifeboat.  The U. S. Navy intercepts the lifeboat, refusing to allow it to enter the Somalian mainland.

The standoff ratchets up again, especially after the S.E.A.L. team is called in.  With the crew snacking on what I assume are coco leaves, they become more and more agitated.  Especially Najee (Faysal Ahmed) who would scare the hell out of anyone in his high-as-a-kite condition, waving around a .45 semi-automatic pistol.  Greengrass doesn't give the audience a lot of time to celebrate Phillips ultimate extraction either.  This is where Hanks will likely draw some Oscar votes.  In a state of shock that seems authentic to me, Phillips has to be coaxed to breathe by the ship's corpsman.  Hell, I felt like she was bringing me out of the same state.  This is a brilliant piece of filmmaking.  One of the year's best.

BLU RAY UPDATE (6-3-14):

This second viewing of this remarkable film, allowed me to look a bit closer at some of the technical aspects of the film.  I was immediately struck by the editing (Christopher Rouse).  Let's face it, the middle part of an action based drama can be a bit of a challenge to keep interesting.  Much of that middle slog is overcome by some quick edits and views of several things going on at the same time.  I was also impressed with the authentic look of the ""Alabama"" with its bits of rust and crud.  Also another look at the acting suggest the various award nominations for Tom Hanks and Barkhad Abdi are clearly warranted.  Hanks final scene remains fixed in my memory.  Finally, this is another near perfect movie by Paul Greengrass, who excels in these action thrillers.

The Blu ray package provides a 1080p video resolution with a 2.39:1 aspect ratio.  It looks perfect.  Somewhat surprisingly, the colors are excellent given the mostly shipboard based film.  But the ocean looks very lifelike.  The actors are bruised up, always sweating and look very tired.  The skin textures and detail leave no doubt as to the character's condition.  If anything the audio track is even better.  Using a DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 soundtrack, the disc handles both the small ambient sounds early in the film and the crescendo of concluding fireworks.  I had just tweaked my subwoofers and they came to attention as the action got going.  The dialog is easily understood including the halting English spoken by the pirates.  Subtitles are available in English, English SDH, Spanish and French.  Extras include an audio commentary by Greengrass and a 3-part documentary (about 1 hour total), a DVD and UV Digital copy and some previews.",1381622400,2,3899,4.815987933634992
6068150,5,B00G7M190U,"""Captain Phillips"" is brilliant! This is how the story goes: The film focuses on the relationship between the Alabama's commanding officer, Captain Richard Phillips and his Somali counterpart, Muse. Set on an incontrovertible collision course off the coast of Somalia, both men will find themselves paying the human toll for economic forces outside of their control.

The cast led by Tom Hanks (in a Oscar-worthy, well-crafted performance as Captain Phillips) & Barkhad Abdi (in a star-making performance as Muse) is brilliant. The directing by Paul Greengrass is brilliant. The screenplay (based upon the book ""A Captain's Duty: Somali Pirates, Navy SEALS, and Dangerous Days at Sea"" by Richard Phillips & Stephan Talty) by Billy Ray is brilliant.

The music by Henry Jackman is brilliant. The cinematography by Barry Ackroyd is brilliant. The film editing by Christopher Rouse (who also co-produced) is brilliant. The casting by Francine Maisler is brilliant. The production design by Paul Kirby is brilliant. The art direction by Charlo Dalli, Raymond Pumilia, Paul Richards & Su Whitaker is brilliant. The set decoration by Dominic Capon, Larry Dias & Corey Hughes-Shaw, set dressings by Maxwell Britton, Brian Buckley, Rachel Burgio, Jonathan Champoux, Christopher Conroy, Keith S. Jackson, Wayne Kimball, Jeffrey Schneider & Doug Scott is brilliant. The costume design by Mark Bridges is brilliant. The special effects coordinated by Brian Ricci & Caius Man is brilliant. The visual effects coordinated by Sara Emack, Judith Gericke & Lisa Kelly, supervised by Charlie Noble & Adam Rowland is brilliant. The stunts coordinated by Rob Inch is brilliant.

This is a brilliant, well-crafted, well-made action drama / thriller that is entertaining and intriguing. Tom Hanks gives an awards-worthy performance (also one of his best performances in years) as Captain Phillips & Barkhad Abdi is superb in a star-making performance as the head pirate, Muse. Paul Greengrass has directed another terrific and well-crafted film, as well as another well-made & well-done true to life story adapted to film, that is just as powerful as his ""United 93"" was. This is one of the best movies of the year and of the fall season, as well. This is also another film that definitely has awards consideration to it, Oscar-worthy, included in the conversation, as well.",1381536000,5,2353,5.31989247311828
6068151,4,B00G7M190U,"""Captain Phillips"" is an excellent action-adventure film. It is riveting, suspenseful, exciting, and very well-made. There are no off moments; no built-in ""bathroom breaks."" Somali pirates capturing an American ship off the Horn of Africa is a timely and fraught topic.

The film's verisimilitude is so powerful at times I really did drift into thinking that I was watching a documentary. There's a lot of money up on the screen: cargo vessels, beat-up pirate skiffs, ports, open ocean, Navy warships. Even so it was the performances and the pacing that kept my eyes glued to the screen. I found every last character so well played and gripping, right down to the medic who appears toward the end, that I wondered if Director Paul Greenglass had not hired real corpsmen, or real pirates.

Sound is used masterfully. Loud, pulsing music suddenly stops at key moments. Yeah, it's an old trick, but it works especially well here.

This is the kind of film I am grateful to have seen in a theater, and I am eager to recommend to friends. Even though action-adventure is not my genre, I'd re-watch this film, and that is high praise.

This film is so consistently excellent that one must ask why it doesn't raise to the level of a ten-out-of-ten star film. ""Captain Phillips"" touches on some of the biggest issues of our times: the collision between the First World and the Third World, poverty in Africa, jihad. ""Captain Phillips"" assiduously avoids addressing any of these issues.

From this film, viewers would never know that the millions of dollars in ship ransom that pirates claim goes to al-Shabaab, the terrorist group that attacked a mall in Kenya. Muse (Barkhad Abdi) offers rationalizations for piracy: Western nations stole Somalia's fish, and piracy is the ""tax"" for that. Pirates made millions of dollars through piracy. Those millions were not pocketed by the pirates themselves, who work for others. No reference is made to Somalis, in 1993, dragging an American soldier through Mogadishu's streets. Americans were attempting to help Somalis after a famine.

Phillips does mention that his ship, waylaid by pirates, was carrying food aid for hungry Africans.

None of this is gone into in any detail in the script, and it could have been.

Rather, the First World - Third World clash, and the clash of civilizations and religions is communicated solely through images, and, in the absence of a complex script, the images speak very loudly.

Somalia is depicted as a dusty, dry, hellhole. Somalis are depicted as chaotic, unproductive, violent, angry, greedy, and lawless. Somalis are dressed in discarded Western clothing and plastic sandals, or simply barefoot. They live in huts. They only things they possess that give them any power is the guns that they got from Westerners. Somalis hold life cheaply and are ready to kill and die.

Americans are depicted as orderly, disciplined, skilled, courageous, and productive. Americans devote massive amounts of money to saving one life.

When the Somali pirates manage to get their ladder against the Maersk Alabama, the image suggests the pirates as invasive parasites attempting to assault a larger, more successful organism. Whereas the Westerners have built a civilization that creates ships and commerce, the Somalis have created only violence, chaos and greed. They must take guns that they themselves can't manufacture and invade more productive peoples in order to survive. It's an ugly picture, and I can completely understand if Somalis are enraged by this film.

Andrew O'Hehir, Salon's film critic, apparently was enraged by the film, and he lambasted it. It was distressing to O'Hehir to watch ""corn-fed, gym-toned"" Americans struggle against ""malnourished"" Africans. That the thin Africans were holding guns to the heads of the Americans did not disturb him. O'Hehir calls the film ""unpleasant and uncomfortable."" He hated watching American military rescue an American hostage. What a sick dude, you want to say. But his view is all too common.

I greatly enjoyed this movie. It could have been an all-time classic if the script had offered some insight into the issues the images depicted.",1381536000,2,4164,5.096916299559472
6068152,4,B00G7M190U,"Film inspired by true events are a dime and a dozen; but every now and again, we have a movie that does a swell job at bringing the true story to the silver screen. The latest film to bring reality to the limelight is Captain Phillips: the story of the hostage situation of the Maersk Alabama in 2009. This adaption was courtesy of  the book A Captain's Duty: Somali Pirates, Navy SEALs, and Dangerous Days at Sea , which was written by Capt. Richard Phillips and Stephan Talty. With a star like Tom Hanks and director Paul Greengrass, Captain Phillips has been shaping itself into quite the movie; and now it has the reviews to back it up. Yet, is this thriller worthy of the true events and your time?

As already stated, the movie follows the events of the hostage situation of the Maersk Alabama. The situation saw Captain Phillips and his crew dealing with Somalian Pirates only for the captain to be capture and the US Navy to get involved. Now imagine the tension and drama that made this situation and turn it into an action flick.

Captain Phillips' story is one that is easy to get into. While I felt the first act was quickly paced, once the Maersk Alabama gets chased by the Pirates, the plot straighten itself out. The story plays out by looking at two perspective: Captain Phillip and Muse. While this element does not last long, it gave the film a form of depth and I think it helped in the long run. Nevertheless, Captain Phillips has a story tension that will have anyone interested.

I can't say Tom Hanks gives the performance of his life as Captain Phillips; but it certainly one his best in a while. If anything the role is one of Tom Hanks' more physical ones. I was curious to see how Barkhad Abdi would fair as Muse. While his performance wasn't as impressive as I was hoping, it was still solid. The rest of the cast is their to be supporting, and nothing more. That might sound discrediting; but on the contrary, the cast still worked.

The cinematography was a hit a miss for me. On one hand, I like the overall imagery. Unfortunately, I found that  the cinematography to be very distracting. The camera move so much that it became an eyesore for me. Granted, I understand why the camera was moving, but it was still obnoxious. Fortunately, what wasn't straining was the tension, and boy is this movie was exciting. From the chase of the Marersk Alabama to the film's climax, Captain Phillips is certain to have you on the edge of your seat.

The one scene that stood  out to me was the chase of the Maresk Alabama. In fact the whole sequence of the Alabama vs Pirates was great. The scene was riddled with tension and didn't play like your average action film. I would also give props to the film's climax, but you know what is going to happening in that, so it wasn't as gripping. Still, the sequence is tense.

Captain Phillips is a film worthy of its subject matter. While the cinematography can be difficult to deal with, the film is still gripping and has terrific performance from Tom Hanks. I can't say how close it is to the true story; but Captain Phillips makes for one exiting time at the movies.

6068153,5,B00G7M190U,"In a year or two, I won't be surprised if I see ""Captain Phillips"" bundled together with ""Black Hawk Down.""  It makes sense:  both deal with American encounters with Somalis and Somalia and both are superb, nail-bitingly intense stories that will keep viewers on the edge of their seats.

The story centers around Captain Richard Phillips (played by Tom Hanks in a performance that I bet gets him an Academy Award or at least a nomination for one).  The real-life Phillips was the master of the cargo ship Maersk Alabama, which was hijacked in 2009 by Somali pirates.  Phillips found himself adrift in a lifeboat with the pirates heading for Somalia until the US Navy decisively intervened.

Besides Tom Hanks' standout performance as Phillips, the movie has multiple strong points:

1.  The realism is very strong.  I found the sequence of scenes where the pirates chased and boarded the ship to be particularly convincing (it seems a real ship was used for much of it and if there were any CGI effects they were seamlessly integrated into the mix).  The stand-off on the high seas between the pirates and the Navy was another strong point (given the apparent participation of the US Navy in making the film).

2.  The movie made the Somali pirates three-dimensional human beings instead of cardboard villains, but it didn't go overboard by even slightly attempting to excuse their despicable behavior.  The Somali actors playing them did a great job portraying desperate men who were willing to commit murder and terrorize people who had done nothing wrong to them for money.

<spoilers>

3.  The movie also deserves praise for its depiction of how Phillips reacted to his ordeal.  Up until the point where the pirates were shot dead, he had shown a great deal of composure and cool-headed thinking.  But in the immediate aftermath of his rescue, guess what?  He went into shock.  How many times have we seen movies where the hero or heroine undergoes some sort of horrific ordeal and displays no evidence of that in its aftermath? Hank's showing Phillips having an emotional and physiological collapse after being held at gunpoint, threatened, abducted, and brutally beaten over a prolonged period, made the movie viscerally ""real"" to me.

The film is not perfect.  I thought the first couple of minutes where Phillips drove to the airport from his home in the US with his wife was pretty dull, and given the fact that they didn't show any scenes with his wife or family after that, it was pretty pointless.  Another criticism I would have would be that the film didn't explain why after the first attempt by the pirates to hijack the ship was reported, there was no real response to the authorities.  But those are minor criticisms.  Bottom line:  this is a terrific movie.  I plan to see it again in the theaters, and I know I will be adding it to my DVD library.

<end spoilers>

Here are some books I'd suggest looking into reading to get a better understanding of Somalia and piracy.
