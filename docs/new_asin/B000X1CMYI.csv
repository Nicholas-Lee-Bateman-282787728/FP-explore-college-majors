8226400,2,B000X1CMYI,"Milland plays an American who goes to the UK to find out how his younger brother got killed as member of a British commando unit during WW2.  Unfortunately, the story meanders through England, Wales and Scotland with no answers or suspense for more than three-quarters of the film. Milland and an excellent British cast are wasted. Adequate Family Nostalgia transfer to DVD of this B&W film..",1508630400,,392,4.9393939393939394
8226401,5,B000X1CMYI,"Ignore the older reviews of the dreadful Sinister Cinema version.  This is a stunningly beautiful transfer (from a company I don't know anything about).  If you love Tourneur's films this DVD is a must-have. His lustrous black and white tonalities are sensuously rendered here. Now, if only someone would do an equally careful and respectful upgrade on APPOINTMENT IN HONDURAS and ANNE OF THE INDIES.",1505260800,2,400,5.138461538461539
8226402,5,B000X1CMYI,"A man must journey to Britain with the purpose to uncover and find out what's behind his brother's death, who was part of a special combat unity.

The well reminded Jacques Tourneur develops a suspense filled - movie with the appropriate doses of mystery and tension.

One of the best British features of that decade.",1220313600,2,317,4.745454545454545
8226403,4,B000X1CMYI,"First the bad news.  This DVD was apparently made from an original projectionist's copy (i.e., not a videotape) in tragically bad shape.  The picture is poor and the sound is worse.  I had a headache after watching it.  I probably will after I watch it again.  And again.

For here's the good news.  Circle of Danger is one of Tourneur's best films, an extremely subtle masterpiece.  For a great deal of the film's running time, it seems to be aimless, merely following the haphazard wanderings of an American (Ray Milland as Clay Douglas), in England trying to learn why his brother was the only casualty on a secret mission during World War II.

There's a stunning change of tone near the end of the film, when Clay learns who killed his brother.  It's truly amazing how very tense the mood becomes so quickly.  But the ""final turn of the screw"" doesn't come until Clay learns why his brother was killed.  When that other shoe drops, the film comes together magnificently.

At an earlier point in the film, Clay has confided to Elspeth Graham (Patricia Roc, Caroline in Canyon Passage) that he feels responsible for his brother's death in a way he can't or won't define.  What becomes devastatingly clear at the film's end is that he's right.  The point isn't made explicitly.  But if you've been paying attention, all through the film, Clay has been displaying exactly the kind of behavior which led to his brother's death.

To say anything more specific would be to ruin an unforgettable experience for an attentive viewer.  But I will say this much.  Chris Fujiwara, in his excellent study of Tourneur (The Cinema of Nightfall) complains about the scenes of Clay repeatedly standing Elspeth up, night after night, even after she pointedly and specifically tells him how much it means to her that he not do so again.  (Exactly what she says is obliterated by an imperfection in the original.)

I think this is one of the few times Fujiwara misses the point.  I don't think the portrait of Clay is neutral, as he claims.  It's balanced; he is brashly ingratiating at times.  But the character flaws he shared with his brother are in full view.

All in all, the DVD is a treasure for any fan of Tourneur.  Or for any fan of films that require close attention and leave it up to the viewer to ""complete"" the film for him- or herself.  (Rather like the way Jane Austen expected her novels to be read.)  It's tough going because of the deteriorated condition of the original, but a wonderfully satisfying experience.

Oh... you might want to stop the film as soon as Clay walks off the heath at the end, though.  Before the lame, tacked-on happy ending.  Ugh!",1194393600,5,2658,4.651612903225806
