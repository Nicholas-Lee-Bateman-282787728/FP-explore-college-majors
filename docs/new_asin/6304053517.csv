770525,3,6304053517,"""Man's Best Friend"" tells the somewhat intense story of a reporter who finds out that the dog she stole is more than just a good guardian, but an unstable killer. Let's face it: this might as well have been titled ""Beethoven 3: Revenge."" The story has some good elements going for it: it certainly has a lot to say about what happens when humans tamper with nature. But those few good things are buried in a heap of unbelievable events and details, and so the movie flops.
The story begins with nosy reporter Lori Tanner, played by Ally Sheedy, sneaking into a top security experiment laboratory to uncover allegations against the company for cruelty to animals. This is the first in a string of unbelievable sequences: if the facility is as important and top secret as the movie portrays it, where are all the guards? Nonetheless, she breaks in and gets the scoop, not to mention a large dog named Max who seems friendly until the project leader, Dr. Jarret, shows up to scare Lori away.
Max escapes and hitches a ride home with her, and once there, he takes a liking to her and a strong disdain for her boyfriend, Perry, who wants him out of the house, Meanwhile, Dr. Jarret reports the dog theft to the police, leading to the inevitable foreshadowing of doom as he tells the detectives about Max's genetic altering that will lead him to unspeakable acts of violence. And wouldn't you know it? He starts going nuts: completely digesting a whole cat, murdering a mailman and burying him like he was a chicken bone.
The movie has fun with the normal dog cliches: the mailman and cat are one of them, as well as his instinct to protect Lori from Perry. As I've seen in reality, some dogs have a real problem with their owner's significant other, and the movie takes this and makes it funny in some places, while terrifying in others. Perry is a wimp to begin with, so that makes it even funnier.
The story itself is not all that bad, either. It has all the normal clichs you would expect to find in a routine thriller: the pair of detectives who can't seem to get a grasp on the situation, which leads to a hilarious send-up of cop-criminal chases in which they chase the dog by automobile. The unsuspecting damsel who thinks she's doing something good, but ends up being the real bad guy. Sheedy does well in the role of Lori, playing her as naive and relentless in her pursuit of the facts. Then there's the know-it-all scientist, Dr. Jarret, who supplies the story by foreshadowing gruesome events. Lance Henriksen plays the part well: forcing us to believe in his words by making them sound serious.
Still, there is a downside, and this has to do mainly with the dog's abilities because of his genetic altering. The movie allows him to become camouflage in order to deceive his pursuant. Unless Webster rolled over in his grave, the world ""camouflage"" means to keep the same form while disguising yourself to look like something else, like a lizard changing color to match a leaf. Here, Max is able to take on the form of a heap of sports equipment, not just the color. A bit unbelievable, if you ask me, and so is his ability to urinate acid. And what about those claws, which enable him to climb to the top of trees?
You can enjoy ""Man's Best Friend"" if you don't take it too seriously. The story doesn't attempt to be too convincing, so really, all we're left with is to sit back and enjoy the ride, which does have some good thrills along the way.",990316800,7,3454,4.519169329073482
770526,5,6304053517,"This movie was the best movie I ever viewed.  It was about a black and tan Tibetan Mastiff who that was genetically-engineered for military purposes or to save human lives.  This movie wouldn've not been possible if not for Richard Eichhorn.  The lead dog in the movie was his and the dog's real  name was indeed, ""Max"".  His title name was  ""Max-A-Million"".  He was apparently sold off to the crew members  who were making the movie, (I assume).  The puppy at the end was also  his-Mr. Eichhorn's.  There were other dogs that posed as Max from other  kennels as ""stand-ins"", but the lead dog was definitely his.  I  know this man, for he has written me a letter...",959558400,,665,4.52542372881356

770528,4,6304053517,"I absolutley LOVED this movie. The first time I seen previews for the film, I knew it was one I'd enjoy seeing over & over again. Albeit, the beautiful Tibetan mastiffs did outshine the actor's character's(which is  why I rated it 4 out of 5 stars), it still did not detract from the plot of  the movie. Perhaps what I found most interested with this film is that it  could become a reality. Well, maybe not having the canine murder people,  yet, the aspect of genetically engineering a super-breed of dog. I  contemplate it would be pretty fantastic to have your own best friend &  bodyguard with heigthened senses. Well, anyway, please see this video;  especially those who love movies where the animals triumphs over the  humans. I promise you, you will not be disappointed.
 P.S.  I would like  to hear from anyone whom enjoyed this movie as much as I did or whom may  have information, like behind-the-scenes or video clips, from the movie.  I'd appreciate it alot.",948412800,5,970,4.668639053254438

770781,3,6304053517,"""Man's Best Friend"" becomes woman's best friend after a nosy reporter (Ally Sheedy) rescues a Tibetan Mastiff named Max from an experimental lab. Max proves to be both fierce and fiercely loyal, attacking muggers and jagoff boyfriends alike. But Max's owner (a bleach-blonde, denim-clad Lance Henriksen) knows his full potential and will do anything to put the canine killer down before he sets him aim higher than neighborhood cats, postmen and snotty paperboys.

The film never takes itself seriously enough to be effective, which is a shame, given how even a film like ""Cujo"" -- for all of its faults -- managed to milk some tension and tragedy from its dog-gone-bad plot. Unlike the rabid titular star of said film, ""Best Friend"" Max is a genetically engineered super-dog, meaning logic is left off the table and anything is possible. A particularly memorable scene involves the killer canine chasing a scared cat up a tree, only to climb the tree himself and devour the critter whole. Moments like this are undercut by a corny score that makes light of any situation that may come across as terrifying. Reagardless, there's enough good fun to be had in watching this peeved puppy play. The special effects are quite remarkable and Sheedy in particular has a magnetic charm that keeps the film going even through its limper points.

All in all, ""Man's Best Friend"" is a pleasant enough creature feature and a fine way to pass an hour and a half. Director John Lafia, who directed ""Child's Play 2,"" knows a thing or two about bringing the absurd to life, and this dog is very much of the same silly but ultimately fun breed. In the end, the film never aims higher than simple b-movie entertainment and like most studio horror of the early '90s, this dog feels neutered and could have benefited from being let off the leash a little bit more.",1475971200,,1844,4.777429467084639

770786,3,6304053517,"""Man's Best Friend"" is dumb fun. If you're looking for something scary, keep looking. If you want something to just munch popcorn to on a Saturday night, then give this one a try.

Ally Sheedy plays a TV journalist looking for a big story, and she literally stumbles into one, when she and her camera woman sneak into EMAX, a laboratory working on the perfect guard dog. Filming the caged animals being used in experimentation, the newsies stumble into a room containing a Tiger, a Bear and a huge dog. The reporter immediately takes to the dog, who is called MAX. When one of the lab guards finds the pair inside the lab, MAX defends the reporter, and provides enough distraction for the pair to make their escape along with the friendly pooch.

The lab's director played by Lance Henrickson warns the police that they have to get his dog back, otherwise the drugs running through the dog's body, keeping it pacified, will wear off, and that Max will turn into a killer. It's not long before we learn that Max is more than a dog, and he's slowly coming unhinged.

Yes, this is a goofy premise, and goofy movie, filled with idiotic characters dressed in way too much flannel (hey, it was the 90's??!), but it's dumb fun. Don't take this movie seriously and you'll enjoy it.",1467676800,,1273,4.574561403508772

I can totally see those guys watching ""Man's Best Friend"" and talking about it like it's more interesting than it actually is. I also wanted to give it a chance because I like Lance Henriksen and I was always a fan of him from the Millennium tv show. But this movie is not very good. First off, I hate it when they decide to cue the music in this movie and splice random song segments into any scene. They used ""Puppy Love"" by Paul Anka TWICE in this movie and it was a terribly awkward fit both times. I can probably never hear that song again without thinking about this horrific movie. Second of all, they never go into the science of this killer canine. They don't even show his robot insides like the dvd cover shows. There was something else I didn't like, I think. There were strong animal rights and anti-cruelty sentiments throughout the movie and then when you watch the end of the end credits I think it says something like 5 animals died during the filming of this movie.

771373,2,6304053517,"Man's Best friend has an interesting premise but was served up lukewarm. Lance Henriksen (always brilliant to see) plays a deceptive, cold scientist who has been doing animal research and experimentation with various cells and placing them in an ordinary dog. Those damned scientists are at it again I tell you! These genetically tweaked DNA samples come from everything such as predatory cats and chameleons. ""Max"" is rescued by an animal activist reporter who protests against research. Of course she promptly takes the dog home, and the two get along wonderfully until...well, let's just say until Max's side effects come to light.

For one thing, while Max adores his new friend, he doesn't' dig her main squeezer. Add to this the neighborhood cats, psychotic mailmen from hell - THEY need to be put on a leash! - and bicycling, annoying kids, and you have a recipe for disaster. Apparently if Max doesn't receive his meds he gets cranky. Watch out!

The plot sounds great, doesn't it? Well, look too hard and that falls apart. Sadly, the movie is predictable and the ending depressed the hell out of me. I can dig why the lead role, Lori, despises animal research - this movie seems like it was trying to make a bizarre point and instead gets muddled somewhere. It makes zero sense the dog will know only to kill 'bad guys', even when they're not obviously bad - like the boyfriend. And acid urine? Too unbelievable to be bought. Also, I could have done without the obvious cute attempts.

On the good side, we do get Lance Henricksen, who acts his best here. His role as the kooky pissed off scientist convinced me. Ally Sheedy was semi-believable as the reporter; not an award winner but fair enough.

The pacing isn't too steady; in the beginning things are a bit slow and later they rush in the final scenes. Direction is alright but nothing to get too excited over. Everything's sunny and shiny and at times shaky cam is used.

Shopping for some killer dog horror? Cujo's darker and more serious than this. While not a horrible movie, it's just not that good either. It tries too hard to be cute in some places and fails, the pacing isn't even, there's nothing extraordinary in directing, the music falters, and the acting is only average. Save yourself the headache and seek out other animal horror if you're in the mood for scares with a bite.",1379635200,2,2355,4.706310679611651

It's a disgrace what Lance Henrikson's character puts the poor dog through. You know what he is doing, after the experimentation, is for the best but you still want to cheer for the dog. The woman that steals the dog from the laboratory is a great match with the dog and they bond very well, maybe to well. The dog becomes jealous and very protective of her and terrible things begin to happen. This movie is full of action and great special effects.

Max shows a greater deal of horror. Cujo had rabies while Max was messed up in an abusive lab, giving him abilties of other animals.

I'd say if they made a horror movie called Max VS Cujo, Max would win. I will give those with a weak stomach a warning. There are some sick parts.

Max returns the favor by protecting her from a mugger. They soon bond and Lori is oblivious to Max's potential for good or evil.

The fun part of the movie is that we get to see Max's potential for good or evil. The situation makes us cheer for Max and overlook his few foibles. We also suspect and look forward to our local authorities (Robert Costanzo, and John Cassini) becoming dog chow.

771460,4,6304053517,"A nice Thursday evening spent with the third member of Sid army inspired yet another 90's B horror review from the North pole's ultimate B enthusiast. It's been a few non-review weeks due to a surplus in orders thanks to this whole Christmas in July non-sense. Obviously we all know Christmas only comes once a year baby! Yet we've been hard at work filling Santa's orders, but have found a little down time again now that July's coming to a close. What better way to celebrate then with a 90's B horror starring Ally Sheedy and Lance Hendrickson? It's an extremely odd pairing but comes together nicely like red hots and knock off M&M's from sizzler eaten out of your sweat short pockets. The film is truly the type of B we look for in every sense. In so many ways it was so awful which is what makes it so perfect. We all know the old adage ""it's so bad it's good."" This is a motto we've centered our lives around.

Man's best friend starts out with news reported Ally Sheedy who sneaks into a animal testing lab to expose the cruel experiments. During her search she comes across a giant, very friendly pooch named Max. As she's telling Max ""c'mon baby you know your the girl of my dreams"" Lance Hendrickson burst in full of rage like he's hunting down Pumpkinhead. Since Andrew Clark wasn't there to wrestle Lance so freaking bad, they had no choice but to high tail it out of their with the dog close by. What Ally doesn't know is this dog's a scientific freakshow compiled with genes from every animal on the planet. He can run as fast as a cheetah, blend into things like a chameleon, has the strength of a bear, and can climb trees like a ring tail lemur. This is a dog you don't want to F with. Obviously the dog goes mental and eats a cat, kills a mail man then burries him under the deck, clips Ally's boyfriends breaks...then later kills him, and kills the scientist. However you really pull for the dog the whole time, poor bast**d never saw it coming.

So to sum it up, Man's Best friend is some top choice grade A meat in the 90's B horror field. Sure it was laughable and never even close to scary but that's what a true good B consists of. The film had so many parts that made you feel as if you were watching a kids movie, especially when they played a B cover of puppy love while Max tried to score with the neighbors dog. It would then switch gears from playful to straight up insane in the blink of an eye. Completely all over the place in the best way possible. For the movie snobs this film will simply not be in your comfort zone. It's not scary and not enjoyable unless you can kick back and enjoys it's Bness. But honestly, if you're expecting to be scared by this movie you've already got a nice stocking full of issues.",1311292800,2,2747,4.301158301158301

The only real graphic scene involved the dog swallowing a cat whole and it implies he rapes the dog next door. The dog's face is even burned towards the end. The movie looks like a typical 90's horror movie with bad acting and not alot of gore. The story makes little sense including the fact the the dog was shot with a tranquilizer and he will turn into a killing machine when it wears off even though he's killed 3 people already.

What she doesn't know is that Max has been genetically-engineered to become the ultimate killing machine, and his makers will stop at nothing to get him back! MAN'S BEST FRIEND is just another silly killer animal flick from the early 90's that barely skates by thanks to a tight script and serviceable directing from writer/director John Lafia as well as another strong performance by genre favorite Lance Henriksen. Max comes fully equipped with the claws of a jaguar, the eyes of an owl, the strength of a bear, and many other enhancements which he uses to terrorize the mailman and get his revenge on the company that made him. The deaths are expectantly tame, with the hilarious exception of a cat that is eaten whole by the marauding canine. MAN'S BEST FRIEND won't be winning any awards in the near future, but as a late night popcorn movie it is an entertaining enough entry in the killer animal genre.

771510,3,6304053517,"This movie has long been one of my guilty pleasures, a true B-Movie where the Frankenstein creation of a genetically mutated dog is adorable, pitiful, and horrifying.

Quick Summary: A news reporter (Ally Sheedy) breaks into a lab to do a story on how the company is experimenting on animals.  While she is there she kidnaps ""MAX"" a Tibetan Mastiff who is apparently the culmination of the scientist's work (Scientist played by Lance Hendrickson).  MAX instantly worms his way into her heart with his human intelligence and precious furry face.  Unfortunately MAX is also very possessive, and overly protective of his new human love interest, much to the chagrin of her boyfriend.

Honestly this movie is not good, it's straight B-Movie fair, but man is it fun on a rainy Saturday afternoon.  The things this dog can do are so way over the top you would think the movie was written by a 12 year old.  But, the humor in the way they are executed will amuse most B-Movie fans.  The cat and mailman scenes are hysterical to me.  And you couldn't have picked a cuter more lovable dog (who is by the way, the best actor in the film).  If you are looking for art, look elsewhere.  If you are looking for substance, look elsewhere.  If you are looking to add to you B-Movie collection then add this to your cart and have a fun time.",1211414400,18,1325,4.544303797468355

She sneaks in and finds outrageous animal testing going on.  One animal is a large dog that she decides to take with her.  The viewer knows that this is no ordinary dog but the reporter does not see it.

Max, the dog, is actually a genetic blend of several animals thus giving it abilities beyond that of normal dogs.  Max is also very intelligent.  Max seems to take a real liking to the reporter and follows her direction while also following his darker purposes.  The corporation's head, a scientist, is trying to get Max back as he believes Max will degenerate into a fearsome killing machine.

Whether Max is good, bad, or just very good at survival should be left for the viewer to discover.

The best I can describe it is as a Sci-Fi modern day ""Old Yeller"".  A great dog who, through no fault of his own must be killed.  And yet he lives on, in the litter of pups he sired by Heidi.
But the movie does point out  A LOT of irresponsible ownership too.
-Stealing the dog in the first place.
-Leaving a dog unsuprvised outside.
-Allowing children to take a LARGE (180 lb) dog out when you know next to nothing about him or his personality.  (Afterall, he came out of a lab and obviously did not get socialized with children).
