8163312,4,B000LPS2UY,"Not bad early 70's Spanish-Italian made, English-dubbed horror film.  A group of weary travelers gather at a spooky isolated mansion and start getting picked off one by one.  Is it ghosts, monsters, or murder?  The Substance DVD release is OK quality, but it needs re-mastering. Not much in the way of extras.  Recommended for fans of the genre.",1501891200,,345,4.896551724137931

8163314,4,B000LPS2UY,"A group of travelers all wind up at the same mansion in the middle of nowhere. Each had gotten lost in the dense fog on their way to various destinations. One couple, on a motorcycle, encounter a man on the road before their arrival. He's dressed in black and carrying a giant scythe! Does anyone else find this to be an obvious warning sign? Another woman runs across two spooky, ghoulish folks in the woods. Once inside the mansion, the six strangers meet a beautiful, mysterious woman (Ida Galli), who tells them a tale of death, witches, and vampirism. Much horror occurs as the unwary visitors slowly discover just where they are, and why they're in the MURDER MANSION. This Italian / Spanish thriller is surprisingly effective. It has a wonderful atmosphere of increasing dread, and inescapable doom. There's also a nice, twisty ending! The perfect midnight treat...",1403395200,2,872,4.898648648648648

8163317,3,B000LPS2UY,"This European-made movie has more contrivances than a late night infomercial.  As I reached the end, I could only shake my head at the way the director handled all the various loose ends.  Yet, there are some interesting moments in the journey from the beginning to the end.

We are introduced to assorted and sundry characters at the beginning of this movie.  In general, the introductions are brief, exposing us to each character only long enough to catch a flavor of their personality.  Of course, in a nominal horror movie some characters need only minimal development since they often fail to make it very far into the movie.

Partially through contrivance, partially through accident, the assorted and sundry characters end up at...you guessed it...AN OLD, DARK, HOUSE!  You should begin to be frightened at this point, or not.  The journey to the old, dark, house is at least as spooky as the house itself.  There is fog, mysterious and scary looking people, a sinister graveyard, and some general running around and screaming for good measure.

The fog is so thick that everyone stumbles through it to reach the old, dark, house.  Of course, the fog is so thick that it is ""impossible"" to travel any further.  We now have a house full of people who wander from room to room (except for the couple making out in front of the fireplace in the living room).  There is some general creepiness, some screaming, some lurking, some heavy breathing, and a death!

The male person from the couple making out in front of the fireplace decides to check out the basement.  As we all know, you never go into the basement in a horror movie.  Of course, the basement is appropriately spooky with some mysterious goings-on that had me scratching my head wondering where the movie was headed.

Now, I pretty much have to stop at this point because I do not want to give away the ending of the movie, which has some interesting moments prior to the very end, where I said, ""What?""  You will have to watch the ending to understand why I said that.  Some of the things that happen at the end made me back the movie up to watch a couple of scenes earlier in the movie because I clearly was not paying enough attention to the movie.  The ending is a little bit complicated.

For most of this movie, it was somewhat fun.  The movie throws in some references to vampirism and witchcraft that keep you guessing all the way to the end.  There is a ton of creepy atmosphere.  Considering the budget, the directors did pretty well.  Yet, I was not completely satisfied with the ending.  As you will see, the ending, while it had its moments, ended up being just a bit too contrived for me and the final scene bordered on bizarre - and not scary bizarre.

Side note on sound quality and picture:  Neither was restored, so be prepared for muddy picture and occasional sound issues.

Who will like this film?  Well, fans of old dark house movies have to have this movie because it falls into that subgenre.  After that, recommending this movie gets difficult.  This movie could be fun to watch with friends who like to make fun of movies.  It could also be fun for people who like atmospheric films even with difficult-to-believe endings.  If you can get this movie as part of a collection, then it could be a real bargain.  All I can say is...

Good luck!",1294790400,2,3333,4.580372250423012
8163318,4,B000LPS2UY,"""Murder Mansion"", originally ""La Mansi&oacute;n de la Niebla"", was a Spanish and Italian production; seen here it is dubbed from the original Spanish. The film is spartan and basically features several small groups of people who run off the road in a heavy fog in the middle of the night near a creepy old mansion. Much of the movie is spent on atmospheric shots of the heavy fog, and those are actually quite well done. The acting varies in quality from fairly nuanced to over-the-top in the case of Elsa, one of the more important protagonists. The dubbing takes away from the film quite a bit, and the sound quality is sometimes less than perfect.

The bulk of the film deals with interpersonal strife (and in one case intrapersonal strife) amongst the guests of the mansion. There is discussion of vampirism and ghostly apparitions, but the film doesn't reveal the reality of the situation until the very end of the film. While some of the film is a bit slow and talky, the concluding ten minutes are quite good and unexpected. The cinematography is good, and the sets are perfect for the film. In this film fog is not just an inanimate object, it almost becomes a character, and it is handled skillfully by the directors, Francisco Lara Polop and Pedro Lazaga.

While not a perfect horror film, it definitely succeeds in creating a sinister feel without giving away key plotpoints prematurely. I found interesting that for a European horror film there was almost no nudity or gore, which is quite a change from the norm. I thought that worked to the film's advantage by making the audience imagine most of the terror versus graphically showing the terrifying happenings. I think this is an excellent example of early 1970's Eurohorror, and I recommend it over most of its peers in that genre.",1226016000,11,1797,4.756410256410256
