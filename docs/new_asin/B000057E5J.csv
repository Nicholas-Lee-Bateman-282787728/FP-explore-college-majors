7932971,3,B000057E5J,"The movie is actually very nice, but as opposed to the product-description this dvd contains the italian soundtrack only. Oddly, the written introduction to the story at the beginning is in german! However, the misleading product-description is not the fault of the seller since it clearly says ""inglese"" on the box.",1320105600,,316,5.215686274509804
