8171782,5,B000MTEFMI,"As expected, we love this. My only complaint is it's only 6 episodes!  If you've watched Garth Merenghi's Darkplace and enjoyed it, you'll love this.  Matthew Holness is brilliant as the guests. He does make an appearance as Garth Merenghi, but his talent really shines as the other characters on the show.  Matt Berry also shows up regularly, although his roles are small.  Too bad as he's also brilliant.  And Richard Ayoade as Dean Leaner...perfectly played, of course.  Brilliantly done and very funny, I highly recommend this!  Do note that this is an import and will not play on most US DVD players.  It works fine for us on the computer and on our region-free DVD player.",1471392000,,678,4.735042735042735

8171784,5,B000MTEFMI,"If you love Garth Marenghi's Darkplace...you will love this as well.  It is a simple format, Dean with different guests all played by Matthew Holness.  Each guest has an episode and it is brilliant, and Garth has his own episode on here as well!  You have to have an all region player to play this DVD because it is not available in the U.S.  Make sure you check out the bonus features for more funny.",1405900800,,401,4.306666666666667
