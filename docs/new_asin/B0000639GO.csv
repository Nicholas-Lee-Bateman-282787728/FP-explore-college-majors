1689670,5,B0000639GO,"Beacham (Tam Lin) comes to Fengriffen to marry Ogilvy(The Sorcerers with Karloff, Witchfinder General with Price, Return of the Saint as Simon Templar) in Regency period England. Immediately, we are made aware of the menacing presence of Ogilvy's dead grandfather who died before Ogilvy was born. As she is starting at Henry's portrait on the wall, a hand push through it and tries to grab her.  Beacham soon is aware that something is off at the ancestral home, when she is rape by an ghostly presence, a man with a stump instead of a hand, Ogilvy treats it as if she imagined it.  No one will reveal the big secret of the Fengriffen curse - and anyone who tries is suddenly found dead. Is it the ghost of the man wronged by Ogilvy's grandfather or is it the son of that man, the woodsman living on the estate with the sole purpose of seeing the curse of Fengriffen fulfilled?
Enters the beloved veteran horror actor, Peter Cushing, as the doctor sent for to heal Beachman's troubled mind. But is it her mind or the ghost that troubles her? After she overhears Ogilvy telling Cushing of the curse, she tries to take matters in her own hands, only to discover there is no escaping.
Amicus, Hammer's chief rival on the 1970's horror market, delivers a tale of the Sins of the Father (in this case Grandfather) visited upon the generations following. Based on the book ""Fengriffen"" by David Case, Amicus presents us with a beautiful, almost poetically, filmed horror tale. Gorgeous eye to historical detail,rich in location work and meticulous period costuming, and well acted by the leads Ian Ogilvy and Stephanie Beacham, this is beautiful to enjoy - though some areas are often a little dark in the film ( aka English style of filming night scenes).  Peter Cushing adds that refined elegance that he does in every performance, always the perfect gentleman ( an much beloved gentle actor).
(The one low point of the movie is the poorly done crawling hand - OH PLEASE, the movie could have well done without that!!!!).  A stunning tale from beginning to end and a delight for Hammer, Amicus and Cushing fans. (Ignore the crawling hand!!!)
Beacham is gorgeous to watch, well matched with Ogivly, eyecandy for the Ladies.
On The DVD versions, you get the added track with Ogily discussing the film in voice over.  Very interesting in details.
Another note:  The House used as Fengriffin, it also the house used for the cult classy Rocky Horror Films.
I also have the twice on Video, the DVD is very superior in quality.",1035849600,6,2516,4.706818181818182
1689671,5,B0000639GO,"Fans of gothic horror should be very pleased with this offering. Peter Cushing is his usual fantastic self, only this time he is one of the few sane ones. A curse placed upon a sadist and his airs makes for a fast paced thriller born of the competition between Amicus and Hammer studios. While some compare this movie with The Hound Of The Baskervilles, the only similarities i see are that there is a curse, and Cushing is in both movies. The picture quality is very good and while the sound is in mono it too is good. Worth a look.",1033084800,7,533,4.287128712871287
1689672,2,B0000639GO,"From start to finish, this would-be Hound of the Baskervilles basks in mediocrity.  Not that it hasn't got its moments. The arrival of Peter Cushing half-way through relieves the boredom momentarily and the rain-soaked finale at the graveyard can almost been deemed rousing, but there are very long intervals between both.
And in those intervals we have to suffer the painfully slow plot develop nearly exclusively in one location, the Fengriffen's country home. Even Ian Ogilvy, in the very unrewarding role of Charles, appears disinterested in the ghostly goings-on terrifying wife Stephanie Beacham, so how is the viewer supposed to care? Those ghostly goings-on aren't particularly well done either. The severed hand, whose relevance turns out to be disappointingly straightforward later on, is an interesting special effect that loses its potency through over-use. Indeed, its appearance on the poster and advertising campaigns would indicate that the producers really did want to get their money's worth out of it.
They would have been better off concentrating on the story, because in spite of a decent cast (including a vicious Herbert Lom), the material, based on a novella by American author David Case, is barely adequate to justify inclusion in an Amicus anthology film.
One of director Roy Ward Baker's least interesting efforts, And Now the Screaming Starts is indicative of the low level the British horror film industry had slumped to by the early seventies. Image entertainment, however, have given the DVD almost special edition status by offering a commentary, trailer and photo gallery as extras.
Film historian and fountain of all knowledge Darren Gross, in the company of actor Ian Ogilvy, provide the commentary. Unsurprisingly Ogilvy remembers very little about the film, but is delighted to discover that Oakley Court, the country house used for shooting, was later the setting for The Rocky Horror Show (in terms of originality and imagination the complete antithesis of this film).
What lets the DVD down slightly is the picture quality, which although vastly superior to the VHS version, appears out of focus on several occasions. That is a minor quibble though, as it is the film that should be singled out for criticism.",1029369600,2,2250,5.25
1689673,4,B0000639GO,"actually surprised, not a bad movie at all. especially for a 1972 foreign flick.  don't expect a lot but a very good storyline plus a pretty entertaining flick equals a fairly good movie.  definitely worth a look.  and no there's not screaming throughout the whole movie or anything like that. to bad though haha",1025740800,,312,4.7407407407407405
1689674,4,B0000639GO,"I remember seeing this film when it first came out back in 1973 (on a double-bill with 'Terror in the Wax Museum'), and have not seen it since.  However, after getting hold of the DVD yesterday, I was struck by how many of the film's images had stuck with me those many years.  A rare non-omnibus film from Amicus, the film tells the story of a young bride brought to her husband's ancestral home (the house used in the film is the same one used as Frank-N-Furter's castle in 'Rocky Horror Picture Show'!) only to find that she is the victim of a curse that no one will tell her about.  Stephanie Beacham and Ian Ogilvy are the newlyweds, and are quite good in their roles.  Veteran performers Rosalie Crutchley ('Blood From the Mummy's Tomb'), Patrick Magee ('Asylum', 'Clockwork Orange'), Herbert Lom ('Asylum', 'Murders in the Rue Morgue') and Guy Rolfe ('Mr. Sardonicus') pop up and entertain before the arrival (nearly halfway through the film) of the fabulous Peter Cushing, as the doctor called in to help figure out why Stephanie is doing so much hallucinating and -- well, screaming.  The best thing about this little gem of a film is the look of it.  Horror vet Roy Ward Baker keeps things interesting by alternating moments of idyllic beauty with images of dark horror.  He makes terrific use of the English countryside and the interiors.  The music, by Douglas Gamely, utilizes a lovely, simple orchestral theme (which, when paired with the beautiful images is nearly breathtaking at times), but seems to 'borrow' heavily in the tense scenes from his previous score for 'Asylum.'
All in all, this is a film for all fans of British horror. As it's been so long since it was widely released on video (the Canadian Prism release actually cut out EVERY moment of horror, including the dramatic climax in the graveyard!), it's time to rediscover this fine, solid, well-cast film.  The DVD is nicely produced (in widescreen, contrary to what the Amazon.com description says), with commentary by Ian Ogilvy.",1020124800,6,2012,4.825581395348837
1689697,4,B0000639GO,"Say the name Amicus to horror fans and immediately one word comes to mind...anthology. Anthologies or portmanteau or multi-story films were Amicus' stock-in-trade. It helped to distinguish them from Hammer Films and from AIP (American International Pictures) who were the primary purveyors of quality low budget horror films during the 1960s and 70s. Movies with outlandish titles like DR. TERROR'S HOUSE OF HORRORS, THE HOUSE THAT DRIPPED BLOOD, and FROM BEYOND THE GRAVE meant that fans of old school or classic horror were in for some stylish cheap thrills. But Amicus was quite capable of putting out good, solid single story horror films like THE SKULL, I, MONSTER, SCREAM & SCREAM AGAIN, & THE BEAST MUST DIE but AND NOW THE SCREAMING STARTS is the pick of the lot.

Originally titled BRIDE OF FENGRIFFIN when it went into production (the less subtle title came from Amicus co-founder Milton Subotsky who specialized in this area) it was meant to be a direct challenge to Hammer by doing a period Gothic piece which was Hammer's specialty. Director Roy Ward Baker had worked for Hammer and the principal cast members, with the exception of Ian Ogilvy, had all been in Hammer movies. The results are as good as anything Hammer had done. The sets & period costumes are impressive, the script & performances solid, the photography & music suitably atmospheric, in fact it's everything a Gothic horror film should be. The story of a family curse and the effect it has on a young bride is a classic Gothic scenario. In fact SCREAMING is more pure Gothic than anything Hammer ever made and that's saying something.

Like the Gothic literature it draws upon, SCREAMING takes a while to get going. First there's the introduction of the characters, then there's the story set-up before we can finally get to the action proper. A 18th century landowner (Ian Ogilvy) brings his new bride (Stefanie Beacham) to his family estate where she is soon plagued by strange visions of a disembodied hand and a rotting corpse. A specialist (Peter Cushing) is called in who, at first, thinks it all in her mind but comes to believe otherwise. The sins of the fathers, a favorite theme in Gothic literature, comes into play leading to revelations, and a highly dramatic grave desecration. If you love Gothic horror then there are few films better than this one. It's not perfect. The pace is slow and the ""famous"" Amicus hand puts in a sizeable appearance, taking you out of the story whenever it does, but not enough to ruin things.",1380758400,2,2516,4.848837209302325
1689698,4,B0000639GO,"Set in late 18th C. England, this tale of horror starring Ian Ogilvy and Stephanie Beacham looks like a cross between THE BEAST WITH FIVE FINGERS, THE HOUND OF THE BASKERVILLES, and ROSEMARY'S BABY.
Newly weds IO and SB take up residence in his ancestral home. The immediate effect is negative for SB, as various ancestor portraits (especially one of IO's grandfather played by Herbert Lom) glower at the passerby. A disembodied hand actually suddenly appears extended from HL's portrait. After a sufficient number of screams by SB, it turns out that it was only a hallucination (maybe?). That night, while asleep in her bed, something opens up a locked window FROM THE OUTSIDE ON THE SECOND FLOOR. Shortly afterward, we see a hand and an arm ending in a stump around SB's mouth and throat. She screams and screams until IO comes to her rescue by using an axe to break open a locked door (which was locked by something we don't see). Upon entering the room, nothing is there except for the hysterical SB.

Not long after, one by one, various house members fall victim to this unseen force. However, all is attributed to natural causes. What is most disturbing to the viewer is the fact that a demon hand is able to get around no matter how far away, eavesdropping on conversations despite being ""earless"", and then dematerializing to return to wherever it came from. The shortage of servants in such a huge manor is also puzzling. Meanwhile, SB continues to feel the evil spirit and insists upon knowing what happened in that house so many years ago. After hiding the secret from her (and us), IO tells SB what happened some 50 years earlier during the lifetime of his grandfather (HL). A heinous act by HL was cursed by the victimized recipient and now appears destined to come true.

Without giving too much away, take one virgin bride, one strange woodsman, one lengthy curse, one malevolent hand, a rapid pregnancy, a doctor of the paranormal (Peter Cushing), And Now the Screaming Starts. Overall, the costumes, attractiveness of our two leads, the splendor of the mansion, and the nostalgic appearance of Peter Cushing does elevate the entire production somewhat. Additionally, the film has a BEAUTIFUL and appropriate music score by Douglas Gamley.  And that's why I gave it 4 stars instead of 3.

Ian Ogilvy has appeared in/as THE SAINT, THE SORCERERS, and WITCHFINDER GENERAL, among others. Stephanie Beacham, in addition to other film performances, will always be remembered in part for her appearance in THE COLBYS (a DYNASTY spinoff). Peter Cushing fans are well aware of his ouvre.
I was tempted to title this review ""SCREAM, SCREAM, AND SCREAM AGAIN"" but that title was already taken by another movie. The actors of this film actually would have preferred the title FENGRIFFIN which was the title of the book that this movie was based upon.",1373068800,,2854,4.842213114754099
1689699,4,B0000639GO,"In 1795, Catherine [Stephanie Beacham] marries into the Fengriffin family, and comes to live at Fengriffin Hall with her husband Charles [Ian Ogilvy]. Immediately upon her arrival, Catherine is tormented by visions of a bloody, eyeless ghost with a stump where his hand once was; his disembodied hand roams the castle, killing anyone who might take Catherine away from Fengriffin Hall, or help her to learn its secrets. When Catherine learns she is pregnant, she fears for the life of her child and becomes obsessed with discovering the grim truths that the Fengriffin family has hidden so deeply. With the help of a psychiatrist, Dr. Pope [Peter Cushing], she moves closer and closer to the truth; but will she learn the family secret in time, and will knowing it send her over the edge?

Screaming is an excellent example of the period films that were so popular during the 1970's, and loads of good creepy fun. The special effects are amazingly good for the time, and the moody atmosphere is so well done you can feel the cold creep into your bones. Stephanie Beacham does an excellent job of portraying the woman trapped by an unknown curse; you can feel her sorrow and desperation. And the story neatly ties together all the loose strings at the end.

1689700,4,B0000639GO,"At first glance, Catherine's arrival at the Fengriffin estate to be wed by its current heir Charles seems like a storybook ending. Yet, it is only the beginning of quite the opposite. I mean, how many such tales include an evil spirit that takes a bride's virginity on their wedding night? Try none. It's only the tip of the iceberg in horrors lurking around: a disembodied hand crawling about here, an eyeless and handless spectre peeping from outside the window there. Not to mention there's apparently an axe murderer on the loose. What kind of law and order, or lack thereof, is available on this side of England, anyway? Can visiting doctor Peter Cushing get to the bottom of all this strangeness? Can anyone fully reveal the Fengriffin family secret without total demise? And how much of it concerns Peter's grandfather (Herbert Lom; though scarcely on-screen, his character effectively protrudes throughout)? One fact is certain; Amicus, the production king of horror anthologies, made very good single story feature films, as well. 7.25/10",1291766400,,1047,5.093023255813954

As those around her begin falling prey to a series of deadly accidents, Catherine must uncover the family's dark history with the help of a local doctor if she hopes to live! Although it often echoes the paranoia and madness found in both ROSEMARY'S BABY and THE INNOCENTS, the British shocker AND NOW THE SCREAMING STARTS is a frightful ghost tale all unto itself. It features top-rate performances by Ian Ogilvy, Herbert Lom, Peter Cushing, and Stephanie Beacham, whose role as Catherine truly sets the film apart. Catherine nearly faces a mental collapse as she is haunted by the ghastly images from the past, but it is never certain whether they are held within her own imagination or if she is truly being tormented by the ghosts. Roy Ward Baker preserves this soft-spoken suspense using his graceful camera work and sinister mood that prevails all throughout the house. AND SOON THE SCREAMING STARTS proves to be a chilling tale of murder and revenge from beyond the grave, and is one of only a few feature-length Horror films by Britain's famous Amicus Productions.

1689702,5,B0000639GO,"If you thought this DVD is about one of today`s screaming singers, you`re  wrong.  It`s a horror of a different kind.  Peter Cushing is a big draw for the movie, but he doesn`t enter the picture until the movie is nearly half over.  It`s about a family curse handed down generation to generation. Made in England with excellent photography and picture depth.  Good cast and acting in the Hammer horror tradition. Worthwhile.",1284163200,,424,4.833333333333333
1689703,5,B0000639GO,"I thought this movie was excellent, they sure don't make them like that anymore.  For a movie that came out in the early 1970's, even though it is a horror movie it had a plot.

1689704,4,B0000639GO,"I'm a great fan of Peter Cushing and the horror genre, and when I saw this title, I knew I had to watch it. ""And Now the Screaming Starts"" may not be highly original or even inspired in terms of the plot, but what it lacks it makes up for in a rich and lush Gothic atmosphere and a lead actress that is beautiful and credibly haunting in her performance. Stephanie Beacham plays Catherine Fengriffen, a virginal bride who accompanies her new husband, Charles Fengriffen [Ian Ogilvy] to his ancestral home in the countryside. Their first night there marks the start of the Catherine's nightmare as she sees horrific visions and is later assaulted on her wedding night by a spectral hand and an unseen entity. Her husband dismisses Catherine's visions as a trick of the mind and nerves, and when Catherine later finds herself pregnant, she begins to become even more concerned about the state of her sanity. Catherine begins digging deeper into the history of the home, especially concerning Charles' grandfather Henry [Herbert Lom] whose menacing portrait leers at her in the hallway. Then there's the mystery of the disfigured woodsman Silas [Geoffrey Whitehead] who does not really serve any purpose yet has ownership of his own plot of land and shack on the family estate.

I found the first half plodding as it takes a while for the story to get moving, and it is only in the second half that the action actually picks up, especially with the arrival of Peter Cushing who plays a prominent psychologist, Dr Pope. Initially Pope thinks Catherine's problems are purely in the mind, but later finds his cynicism challenged by mysterious deaths and happenings. The highlight performances in this movie are Cushing's and Beacham's. The plot and dialogue are average, but what makes this a memorable viewing experience is the highly atmospheric setting and the ancestral manor which is quite amazing. The special effects are rather cheesy given this is a 70s movie, yet I felt entertained and absorbed in the story as I lost myself in the Gothic-inspired plot and settings. Recommended for fans of the genre.",1252368000,,2105,4.879888268156424

1689706,5,B0000639GO,"I love historical gothic horror.  ""And Now The Screaming Starts!"" is a fine example of this genre.  It has many reasons for applauding it.  First, there is the gorgeous, buxom Stephanie Beacham (""Schizo,"" ""Nightcomers,"" and ""Dracula A.D. 1972"") as the tortured heroine, Catherine Fengriffen.  She should've fled her husband's ancestral mansion the first night she arrived.  She begins screaming on the stairwell in front of Henry Fengriffen's portrait and never stops.  Brave Catherine is determined to learn the secret behind the ghostly apparitions of the blind woodsman and his disembodied hand.  Everyone who attempts to tell her the secret has a deadly accident.  Horror icon Peter Cushing stars as Dr. Pope who is called upon to investigate the supernatural phenomenon.  He is a Victorian precursor to FBI agents Mulder and Scully of ""The X-Files.""

  A beautiful, stone mansion; a carefully guarded family curse; and the fog enshrouded crypt are just some of the gothic elements present in this creepy, atmospheric masterpiece.  ""And Now The Screaming Starts!"" is reported to be the only historical gothic horror film produced by Amicus and they spared no expense in the period sets and costumes.  The plot moves along at a nice pace thanks to a good body count and plenty of shocks.  The biggest shock occurs at the end when poor Catherine, after a failed attempt at killing it, delivers her first baby - an ending that reminded me of the one from ""Rosemary's Baby.""  In fact, Catherine Fengriffen and Rosemary Woodhouse shared many similarities - a supernatural pregnancy being one of them.

  ""And Now the Screaming Starts!"" is highly recommended for those who love gothic horror.  It is as good, if not better, than any gothic horror produced by Amicus' biggest competitor, Hammer Productions.  The DVD package from Dark Sky Films is superb.  It has a widescreen presentation with a 1.78:1 aspect ratio.  English subtitles are available.  Two separate commentaries are also present.  A collectable booklet of interesting liner notes can be found inside the DVD keep case.  The back cover erroneously reports a B/W picture but I assure you that it is in color.",1232323200,,2170,5.09375
1689716,5,B0000639GO,I love this type of movie! Too bad they don't make movies like this anymore. What happened to making movies with castles and class? Great Buy!,1231459200,,142,4.5
1689717,5,B0000639GO,"For a few decades during the latter half of the 20th century, both Amicus Productions and Hammer Film Productions were successful British movie-making companies that each earned reputations because of the popular horror films they produced.  Both companies went into decline at the end of the 1970s--the company now called Hammer is essentially a mere shadow of the former, and Amicus produced its last film in 1980--and in the years since, horror fans have generally favored the films of Hammer over those of Amicus, many because they feel that Amicus was rarely able to reach the same literary and production-quality plateau in their movies that rival Hammer seemed to consistently achieve. There are exceptions to any rule, of course, and in this case the exceptions are 1972's TALES FROM THE CRYPT, 1973's THE VAULT OF HORROR, and 1973's AND NOW THE SCREAMING STARTS!

One reason that TALES FROM THE CRYPT and THE VAULT OF HORROR stand up against the Hammer films might be the fact that they are based on stories from the still-venerated Horror comic books published in the U.S. in the 1950s by EC Comics.  Like the magazines on which they were based, the stories in these two anthology films are scary but witty modern tales in which the bad guys ultimately receive their often ironic just deserts.  But AND NOW THE SCREAMING STARTS! is a wholly different film.  Based on the novel FENGRIFFEN by David Case, this Amicus film is a Gothic tale of supernatural revenge that is set in 18th-Century England.  As such, it more closely resembles a number of Hammer's horror films, most of which are also tales of Gothic horror. In addition, AND NOW THE SCREAMING STARTS! is more earnest, more literate, and more frightening than the bulk of the other horror films in the Amicus library, and the production values (including the convincing special FX) are also several notches above the company's usual output.

Other aspects of AND NOW THE SCREAMING STARTS! might also help explain why it is one of the better Amicus horror films.  First off, the film was directed by Roy Ward Baker, who had previously directed some of Hammer's best horror films like THE VAMPIRE LOVERS (1970), SCARS OF DRACULA (1970), and DR JEKYLL & SISTER HYDE (1971). Baker also directed several episodes of the classic Brit TV show THE AVENGERS.  Secondly, the film co-stars the beautiful Stephanie Beacham--also a veteran of Hammer horror films (1972's DRACULA A.D. 1972) who would later go on to fame in the U.S. on TV's THE COLBYS and DYNASTY in the 1980s--and Ian Ogilvy, who had cut his thespian teeth on genre classics like THE SORCERERS (1967) and WITCHFINDER GENERAL (1968).  Finally, AND NOW THE SCREAMING STARTS! also includes an outstanding supporting performance from horror great Peter Cushing, himself a veteran of numerous Hammer horror classics in recurring roles as either Dr Frankenstein or vampire hunter Van Helsing.  American audiences probably know Cushing better from his role as Grand Moff Tarkin in George Lucas' STAR WARS (1977).

The DVD edition of AND NOW THE SCREAMING STARTS! from Dark Sky films is well worth the price of admission.  It offers a very clean digital transfer of the film in its original aspect ratio of 1.85:1 (enhanced for widescreen TVs), and the disc also includes two outstanding feature commentaries (one with director Baker and star Beacham, and the other with star Ogilvy).  Unlike most of the other films from the Amicus library that are available on DVD, this one unquestionably deserves a place in the collections of all serious fans of horror cinema.",1225238400,,3578,4.961538461538462
1689718,3,B0000639GO,Although this movie was not great I found it very watchable. I think anyone who is a fan of Peter Cushing and British films will enjoy this one.,1213142400,,144,4.178571428571429
1689719,4,B0000639GO,"I first saw this film over a decade ago when I was in the UK, and it did make a definite impression on me at the time. I customarily relish most period stories, but the scary, ghoulish twist to 'And Now the Screaming Starts!' adds an extra element to it, and so when the fact that a new, digitally-mastered DVD of this very good movie was available came to my attention, I didn't wait a moment and instantly placed an order for a copy. As I am in Mauritius, it took over a month for the buy to reach my doorstep, but it was well worth it. My wife and I watched the DVD together, and we both thoroughly enjoyed it.

Perhaps the one criticism that could be levelled, if one is really out to nitpick, and which incidentally explains my own four-star rating of this product, is the speech that is used by the actors/characters. In 'And Now ...,' the accent of English which is heard all the way through is a typical, plummy, upper-class British Received Pronunciation manner of communicating, especially of a somewhat antiquated variety that was prominent a few decades ago. In relation to the movie in question, the plot, of course, takes place in the eighteenth century, when most of Britain spoke in rhotic fashion, and the sound of the language back then was markedly different from what is known as English English today. Many actually ignore the fact that Received Pronunciation was only developed in the 1800s, and in no way can accurately represent the way the English people talked in centuries preceding that era. This is perhaps not a major flaw with this film, as I myself adore listening to RP talk, but I think that it is pertinent from a historical point of view.

Otherwise, I certainly recommend 'And Now the Screaming Starts!' to all who have a liking for this given genre.",1187481600,,1787,4.56386292834891
1689720,3,B0000639GO,"This is one of a few horror films that features a severed hand crawling around on its own (including Dr. Terror's House of Horrors, among others). You may recognize most of the actors here besides the angular and always distinguished Peter Cushing and the buxom Stephanie Beacham; we also have the housekeeper from 1963's wonderful ""The Haunting"" (remember creepy Mrs. Dudley, who doesn't come around ""in the night...in the dark..""), Guy Rolfe who was ""Mr. Sardonicus"", and we have the doctor from ""Dementia 13"" (Patrick Magee plays doctors very often).
Cushing gets top billing and unfortunately makes his entrance halfway through the film. I'd have preferred more of him. He is always a pleasure in these movies. He was particularly enjoyable and very sympathetic in one of the anthology movies (probably Tales from the Crypt) as the sweet, poor man whose evil neighbor is bent on ruining him.

A rather amusing anecdote is that this film was referred to as ""The Bride of Fengriffen"" until filming wrapped, and then some genius changed it to ""And Now The Screaming Starts"". The latter makes it sound more like a sensational William Castle piece.

If you enjoy the Amicus productions like Asylum, Tales From the Crypt, and Torture Garden, give this a whirl...it is not an anthology of horror tales; it's more like a Hammer picture as it takes place in 1795. I only give it three stars because for me it just lacks a certain spark that I'm used to in the Amicus/Hammer/Corman flicks. It's just not quite as fun as I had hoped.

1689721,4,B0000639GO,"While every family may have `skeletons in the closet', for most it's only a metaphor, alluding to some dark secret meant to be kept hidden from the general public, but that's not necessarily the case with the House of Fengriffen, as illustrated in the Amicus feature And Now the Screaming Starts (1973).  Directed by Roy Ward Baker (Quatermass and the Pit, The Vampire Lovers), the film stars Stephanie Beacham (House of Mortal Sin, Inseminoid), Ian Ogilvy (From Beyond the Grave, Death Becomes Her), and Peter Cushing (At the Earth's Core, Star Wars).  Also appearing is Geoffrey Whitehead (Kidnapped), Guy Rolfe (Ivanhoe, Mr. Sardonicus), Herbert Lom (Asylum, The Return of the Pink Panther), and Patrick Magee (A Clockwork Orange, Demons of the Mind).

The story, set in England in the year 1795, begins with the arrival of Catherine (Beecham), strained bodice and all, to the House of Fengriffen, a large and expansive estate in the countryside.  Seems Catherine is set to marry Charles Fengriffen (Ogilvy), the last of his line, which she does, despite some peculiarities of the ethereal kind inherent within the house (i.e. a severed hand roaming the halls, windows that open on their own, etc.), all of which only Catherine can see (for now).  On the couple's wedding night, while Catherine's preparing for the consummation the nuptials, she's attacked by a mysterious figure sans a hand (I think I saw it slinking about in the hallway), one who vanishes once Charles manages to break through the locked door.  Well, turns out the House of Fengriffen has a terrible secret in its past, one involving Charles' grandfather Henry Fengriffen (Lom) and Silas (Whitehead), the creepy woodsman who lives on the estate, one that Charles, along with everyone else `in the know', are reluctant to share with Catherine, despite her repeated inquires (those who do seem interested in helping Catherine find themselves in a world of supernatural hurt as Stumpy the Ghost and his detached flipper run interference).  As the local doctor, played by Magee, is unable to help Catherine with her `problem', a specialist is called in, one Dr. Pope (Cushing), a practitioner of a new science involving the mind (the thought being Catherine might be going mental, which she is, but only because of bizarre happenings in and about the house).  Pope, being an intelligent and practical man, quickly realizes Catherine's condition is somehow related to past events and soon pressures Charles to spill the beans, which he does in a lengthy flashback (the events Charles relates occurred prior to his birth, so he believes it all more or less a legend).  After the revelation things really get interesting as events come to a head as a prophecy made long ago comes to fruition...

While I enjoyed this film a lot, I did have a few issues, the main one being I thought Peter Cushing, sporting quite the interesting coif, should have had a bigger role in the story (few at the time seemed as much at home in these period features as Cushing, except for Christopher Lee and Vincent Price, in my humble opinion).  His character doesn't make the scene until about forty-five minutes in, and even then he's more or less just a catalyst to draw out the Fengriffen's dirty laundry (it's positively filthy).  His character's overall involvement is relatively minimal, as he can do nothing but witness the events that unfold after his arrival.  Also, both Lom and Magee have relatively minor parts, the main bulk of the production on Ms. Beecham's lovely shoulders, who did very well, but could have used a bit more help.  As far as Charles, played by Ian Ogilvy, I thought he was a curiously detached character, not overly concerned that his wife's worsening condition might be tied to the family secret he was so reluctant to let her in on, at least initially.  Perhaps he was so eager to believe it was all so much superstitious nonsense that neglected to see the forest for the trees, but I'd think once the various deaths started to occur, he might have acted sooner than he did...not that he could have done anything to prevent the ultimate outcome, but still...the story isn't laid out for those who like things to be presented in order, but more like someone putting together a puzzle, working from their way in from the border.  As a result, the first three quarters of the film may frustrate some less patient viewers as not only is there a good deal of confusion (at least until Charles comes clean), but also the going is somewhat slow.  As for myself, I kind of liked being left in the dark, trying to discern the gist of things from what little was offered, up until the revelation.  Once the secret is revealed, things quickly become apparent, especially in terms of where the story is going (I guessed most of the twist ending well before it occurred).  There were a couple of specific aspects I found downright annoying, the first being a dog howling sound effect would be played about every fifteen minutes like clockwork.  Maybe the intent was to re-enforce the gothic nature of the story, but it was unnecessary.  The second aspect involved the windows in the Fengriffen estate...these damn things would open constantly, apparently due to supernatural elements gaining entry into the home, but then, if it was a ghost (it was), why the hell would it need to open a window to get inside?  The only real reason for this was to let the audience in on the fact something spooky was about to happen, and not because it was actually necessary for the story.  I thought the script was written well, and the production values very strong...the period pieces and costumes worked wonderfully in creating a sense of the time the story was meant to take place.  As far as the violence and blood, there's not really a lot of either, except for within the flashback sequence (someone's grubby mitt gets lopped off).  Overall the film isn't particularly scary, but it kept me engaged and entertained throughout.

1689722,5,B0000639GO,"""And Now The Screaming Starts!"" has the feel of a Hammer Studios horror picture, however, was made by it's rival studio Amicus.  The English castle, the haunting story of the ill-fated couple who were so dreadfully wronged by an English nobleman, whose family now carries their curse, and the great atmosphere of the creepy house and it's weird goings-on, make this a fun ride for British horror fans.  I video taped this movie from one of cable TVs movie channels, and immediately it became one of my favorites of the genre.

The time is 1795, in England, a young woman Catherine (Stephanie Beacham) moves to the house of her fianc Charles Fengriffen (Ian Ogilvy) in the country to get married to him. When she arrives, she feels interest in the portraits of the Fengriffen family, particularly in the one of Charle's grandfather Henry Fengriffen (Herbert Lom), which seems to have a sort of evil entity possessing it. While admiring Henry's face, a severed hand attacks Catherine through the picture on the wall. Later, she gets married to Charles, beginning her journey of mystery, eerie apparitions, secrets and deaths. Her days are filled with fear and the nights with horrors in a family that has been cursed.

""And Now The Screaming Starts!"" is part of ""The Amicus Collection,"" along with ""The Beast Must Die!"" (1974) and ""Asylum"" (1972).  I've yet to see the later two titles, but have ordered them from Amazon and should be receiving them shortly.

1689723,4,B0000639GO,"The 70's were hard for horror fans; the only worthwhile films were produced on low bugets by a trio of studios (AIP, Hammer and Amicus). During much of the 70's Hammer's horror output became very uneven in quality. Amicus rose to the occasion putting out a series of worthwhile horror films that continue to work well because of the strong casting and interesting scripts/direction on the films.

""And Now the Screaming Starts!"" has a loaded title which fits the film well. Charles and Catherine Fengriffen (Ian Ogilvy and Stephanie Beacham) have just moved into Charles' ancestral home. On their wedding night Catherine is raped by an an evil ghost or spirit haunting the house. After her attack she has a series of strange visions and dreams that disturb her. Charles fears for her sanity and calls on Dr. Whittle (Patrick Magee a part of the Amicus stable who also appeared in ""Asylum"" and ""A Clockwork Orange"") who, in turn, calls in Dr. Pope (Peter Cushing naturally)a doctor who uses science to cure mental disease. Pope believes that Stephanie has become unhinged but ultimately ends up in a supernatrual battle that even he doesn't expect.

This re-release from Dark Sky Films (a division of MPI)hasn't been released yet (it releases at the same time as ""Asylum"" in July 2006)but will feature a new high definition anamorphic transfer done from the original 35mm negative.

1689725,5,B0000639GO,"I saw this movie on AMC ( american movie classics channel), and at first it looked like a B-movie, but don't underestamate the quality of foreign films. The set is beautiful, and the costuming is exquistate. The movie is quit frightening in some parts, such as the gohst with his eyes poked out! GROSE!!! The hand crawling around the house is pretty funny, yet sad to find out why it is there. Peter Cushing is great, along with Stephanie Beacham. Some of the screaming is pretty laughable, for how phony it sounds, and the music is also pretty cheap. Over all, this film is not very well known, and should be, for it is alot better than what you think.
  P.S ( the R rating is SO ridiculous, this film has only a bit of mild gore, and a rape scene, but nothing is shown, and no language. My gosh, this deserves a PG!!!!)",1088812800,,821,4.324675324675325

Catherine is immediately unnerved by a painting and takes to staring at it.  Shes also haunted by a specter with no eyeballs and a creepy crawly hand that appears and disappears at will.

7959105,3,B0000639GO,"I so wanted to give this fewer stars although it is a decent production, I'm not a fan of these 70s horror movies however THIS one is important because it addresses droit du seigneur of English aristocrats.  It's a huge crime and if you google to see if Rob Roy and Braveheart were based on specific incidents, you find denials abound because there is no surviving testimony or accounts - why would there be but then why are there more denials than witness reports online - what would trigger the denials?  British nurses who survived the Japanese won't even talk about what happened to them two hundred years after the setting of this film.

fyi - that red caul is sometimes considered the mark of the yellow horde who raped their way from invaded China to the West.  The Chinese are nice about it and say a blue one is just that you are so cute as a baby that ghosts can't even resist giving you a pinch but the Mongolians inexplicably are PROUD that these marks are signs of their presence in bloodlines.  By invitation?  By consent?  What did you do in Russia and who did you do it to?  Those blue spots appear in Northeast Africa as well but they do not seem to appear in subsaharan Africa so I would say its not likely to be of laudable provenance.

fyi - the property owner is shown looking at line about the goblin/kobold aka fairy of the mine (so fairies come in ugly) in a closeup of the book in his hand.  Milton wrote that poem fifty years later than the setting of this story and he wrote it for a household where they had a scandal related to a sex crime and the poem is based on a story about chastity being able to resist misdirection.  I'm pretty sure the assault accused of Mervyn Touche'  had nothing to do with anyone's ability to voluntary resist biting into any pomegranates.  The crime attributed to him and confusingly his wife is basically unreadable.  I don't know whether to call shenanigans or wash my eyes out.

fyi - the film is set in 1795, fifty years after a sex crime was committed by the ancestor of the current property owner which is when Rob Roy MacGregor died and in America, we know two things about that whole area and era: Rob Roy and Braveheart and both of them show the English committing crimes against nonEnglish women.

So ... heh.  This movie in the 1970s communicated the same message about landowning ""nobility"" and their right.  So I would say despite there NOT be any records that this actually happened to the original people of the British Isles by the landowners, they act like it happened to them, don't they and they can't forget it.  It's been mentioned as a reason to emigrate from their homelands so ....

It's a long memory for something that didn't actually happen exactly like the Koreans breaking their Confucian reticence and fighting for the Comfort Women - over something that the descendants of the accused also claim NEVER HAPPENED.",1401840000,,2901,4.510516252390057
