8465377,5,B005CFC0CY,"PSYCHO STALKERS starts out strong w/ MOTHER'S BOYS- Horror goddess, Jamie Lee Curtis (HALLOWEEN 1 and 2, THE FOG, TERROR TRAIN, PROM NIGHT, ROAD GAMES) stars as Jude, the sociopathic MOTHER of the title. Curtis sinks her teeth deep into her role, giving off a combination of menace and raw sensuality that's astonishing to watch! She gleefully goes about destroying her husband (Peter Ghallagher- AMERICAN BEAUTY) and kids in order to get what she wants. A classic! Next up is ASUNDER- Blair Underwood plays Chance, a man who loses his wife in a terrible accident. We feel sympathy for him until he begins to mentally unravel, resulting in a murderous rampage. More of a drama up until the bloody, absolutely insane finale! BLEEDING ROSE- Sakeena Nicole is Ebony, a woman trying to break into the music business. Everything is great until her crazed, satanic ex-boyfriend begins slaughtering everyone she knows! This is an extremely low-budget film, but it's well-done enough to make it worthwhile. SALVAGE- Lauren Corrie-Lewis is Claire Parker, a young woman who finds herself caught in a never-ending nightmare of despair, death, and doom. My personal favorite. 2:13- This is a fantastic thriller in the SEVEN vein. A cop (Marc Thompson) named Russell Spivey is in the middle of a serial killer case that will test him to the core of his soul. It will show him what he is truly made of, while costing him everything, and haunting him for the rest of his days.  My second favorite. DESCENDANT- Well, there had to be at least one dud, right? Katherine Heigl stars as a distant relative of Edgar Allen Poe who meets and dates another Poe descendant. Watch out Kathy! He's crrraaazzeee, doncha know?! Though utterly absurd, this movie is also hideously boring, making it a major chore to watch. Ugh!  Anyway, the rest of the movies in this collection certainly make it a keeper...",1385337600,2,1878,4.90251572327044
