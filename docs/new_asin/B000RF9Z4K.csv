2865495,2,B000RF9Z4K,"I was greatly disappointed in this DVD. It has great Wagner selections, well played and recorded. The thing that almost drove me out of my mind was the director's constant focus on the conductor, Klaus Tennstedt, mostly ignoring the orchestra and its soloists. The pleasure of watching music played on DVD  is next best to being at an actual performance, where you scan the orchestra while listening. This DVD robs you of that. You might just as well listen to a CD. I gave it away to a friend who is more tolerant than I.",1249084800,12,522,4.494736842105263
8200300,2,B000RF9Z4K,"Wonderful sound, but unfortunately this recording is mostly about the conductor.  The camera keeps zooming in on the conductor, and then panning out to the whole orchestra.  Offers very little chance to observe individual musicians performing their art.  When I buy a music DVD I want to see close ups of individual musicians performing, and not so much just the changing facial expressions of the conductor.  Plan on just sitting back, closing your eyes, and simply enjoy the audio on this DVD.",1459468800,,495,5.0

8200302,5,B000RF9Z4K,I had enormous affection for Klaus Tennstedt and his concerts in London are some of the highlights of my concert going career. The emphasis on Tennstedt is to absolutely welcomed in this dvd as he tells the stories of the pieces better than anyone else in the orchestra. Live Tennstedt seemed to galvanize orchestra and audience more than almost anyone I have seen in the last 40 years and this wagner concert seems to have been no exception. This dvd is an absolute bargain and should be purchased without hesitation.,1408060800,,518,4.766666666666667
8200303,5,B000RF9Z4K,"As an orchestral musician, what I look for most in the video (as opposed to the audio) of a concert is how a conductor shares his vision of a piece with the musicians and how the musicians respond.  In the video of <Rienzi> what the director shows us is a conductor who clearly loves this music and, through his body language and gestures and even his perspiration, communicates that to the musicians of the LPO, who respond in kind.  The espirit de corps exhibited by the violins and celli and particularly the brass gives evidence of why many of us play in musical ensembles, whether community or professional, i.e. the opportunity to realize great music.  As for the audio, the orchestra playing is stellar, and whenever I can't muster the enthusiasm to practice, I just cue up any of the trumpet entrances to remind myself why it is all worthwhile.",1387584000,,852,4.666666666666667
8200304,5,B000RF9Z4K,"I couldn't disagree more with Joseph Falotico. Many years ago, when walking across Hungerford Bridge in London, I could tell when the stream of concertgoers returning from Festival Hall had been to a Tennstedt concert - they were shaking the lava from their clothes and blinking hard. The point of a Tennstedt concert was the man on the podium, the sounds he could cajole the London Philharmonic into making, and their effect on us. I'll bet those concertgoers hardly scanned the orchestra, but were nonetheless deeply receptive to its playing. The man has departed this life, too young, and videos such as this [and the superlative ones now appearing with Tennstedt and the Boston Symphony] are our only chance to connect with one of the supreme music-makers of the 20th century. We are richer for it. Five stars from me.",1376870400,,822,4.878571428571429
8200305,4,B000RF9Z4K,"I had this on Laser disc but my laser player died an ugly death after many years of faithful performance.  DVD's format is superior to Laser discs, so it was a definite upgrade.  Too bad it's not up to snuff as to current recorded sound.  But I like seeing Tennstedt work his magic on the players, and am constantly amazed he never actually studied conducting.  He sometimes flails his arms and works up far too much sweat in the process, but he gets a lot of music making out of his musicians.  Even though I took a star away from my review of Lorin Mazel's Ring medley, this is all music written directly by Wagner and there are no abrupt transitions from one piece to the next.  Very happy to find it re-released in DC format.",1371513600,,729,4.323529411764706
8200306,4,B000RF9Z4K,"What a difference this concert from Japan is to the same program Tennstedt conducted in London that was released on CD here&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Orchestral-Excerpts-from-Wagner-Operas/dp/B000B6N6GS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Orchestral Excerpts from Wagner Operas</a>&nbsp;The London concert is from 1990, two years after this wonderful Japanese appearance by Tennstedt and the LPO.

Why do I favor this DVD over the later CD? First and foremost the sound quality here in Dolby Digital and DTS is superior. Second of all, Tennstedt is two years younger and feels more alive at the podium. I know the conductor was suffering from serious health problems for years but he had this ability to transcend his physical impairments to create sensational music. What one has to accept from Tennstedt is this manic depressive bipolar quality that afflicts much of his music making. He can be absolutely on fire one moment and then slack and dull the next. This can happen within the same work, within the same movement, even section by section. Tennstedt is too variable in quality to be ranked among the true greats of the podium -- but I have to say when he is ""on"", he ranks with the all time talents. The London Philharmonic was wedded heart to heart with this maestro by this point. Just have a listen...

Much of the music here is alive like it rarely is with others. To mention some highlights -- the Rienzi overture is the greatest I've ever heard. Every section is felt deeply as if it's a matter of life and death. The Ride of the Valkyries is very exciting, the opening of Tannhauser Overture has a rare nobility, the closing pages of the Meistersinger Overture are stretched out to this wild crescendo that is unlike any other. The Funeral March has an element of true courageous struggle with natural climaxes. The ultimate highlight for me was the Dawn Awakening from Gotterdammerung. Years ago I fell in love with Wagner's music and one of the greatest elements of his unique sound is the long breathed line, the infinite melody that swoons seemingly for eternity. This quality was copied by many subsequent composers with the most famous examples being R. Strauss and Mahler.

I thought Furtwangler did the long line better than anyone in this Dawn and Awakening scene, but I have to give the prize to Tennstedt instead. The way he shapes the phrases, the way he lets the woodwinds linger on that heavenly motif before the violins come in and play it back and forth with the cellos. Then the build up to the climax, JUST WOW! It's strange then that Tennstedt skips about two minutes worth of music in the typical arrangement and proceeds straight to the climax when Siegfried and Brunnhilde are singing ""Hail, Hail!"" before they part ways. The Journey on the Rhine is also quite enthusiastic, not as good as Solti in this section, but fine nonetheless.

Of course not all is perfect with such a variable conductor, so the interior sections of the Meistersinger Overture lack some pulse and the first section of the Venusberg music from the Tannhauser Overture dawdles around before gaining momentum. But that would be nitpicking, wouldn't it? Stick to the positives.

The one thing I do have to address is the filming style since this is a DVD and the visual is very important. Whoever edited this concert lingers on Tennstedt way too long! He's not the most photogenic maestro and he looks tired and truly worn out. Is this visual treatment a testament to a dying musician? Looking at it from that perspective it's a positive but in reality I would have much rather seen more of the orchestra, the emphasis on Tennstedt's sweating visage is too much. I just put the headphones on and can listen with eyes closed or looking elsewhere. Visually it's not the most appealing concert... it's all about the music and like I said in the heading of this review, there are moments of sheer bliss contained within...",1356912000,4,3968,4.951951951951952
8200307,4,B000RF9Z4K,"This is a treasured historical issue featuring Klaus Tennstedt, a much loved and respected leading conductor of his time. He had a particular reputation for his Wagner interpretations and here we have him and the LPO at their peak on tour in Japan 1988.

To quote the sleeve notes `If Klaus was a washing powder you'd say he had ingredient X ....... he communicated with the orchestra right to the back desks' (John Willan EMI producer). This ability to communicate, not only to the orchestra, but also to the packed audience at the Suntory Hall, Tokyo is apparent throughout and the concert builds to a well-deserved ovation which both he and his orchestra richly deserve.

He is able to conjure up majesty and splendour combined with humanity. Climaxes are simply thrilling and at all points there is such a firm grip on the musical journey that there can be no doubt of reaching a glorious destination!

After a satisfying start with 2 Tannhauser items the concert moves up a gear with probably the best performance of the Rienzi Overture that you will ever hear complete with particularly trenchant and resplendent brass. The tension is palpable from the first bars and the first cheers can be detected from deep in the audience. The rest of the concert continues at this exalted level with well-known items from Gotterdammerung and Meistersinger before the Walkure ride in suitable splendour to the conclusion and rapturous applause!

Fortunately the recording engineers deliver excellent stereo sound for the period which also works well in DTS surround. The imaging is perfectly well able to portray the event within the context of its period.

This is a very special issue and should be in every Wagnerite's collection whatever other recordings they own. Clearly, as you will have gathered, in my opinion this must surely deserve at least 4 stars even after making a grading reduction simply for the age of the recording!",1343520000,2,1929,4.959752321981425
8200308,4,B000RF9Z4K,"Yes, some have suggested that Klaus Tennstedt resembles a crippled or spastic stork conducting a symphony orchestra.  Yes, he does frequently push his glasses up, wipe his eyes, and use his suit sleeve to wipe off his copious perspiration.  But perhaps all of this is because Klaus Tennstedt is so very much absorbed in the music that other factors don't matter.

In the recording studio, he is known to have refused to do re-takes--to re-record a passage because of a misplayed note.  For him, the spirit and emotional impact of the music took precedence over a technical mistake.  Not that his concerts are full of missed notes, it's simply that we need to appreciate his emphasis on bringing out the composer's intention as he sees it.  Perhaps it's like a teacher's concern that the overall value of a student's composition is of more value than obsessing over a misspelled word.

So, if you don't mind watching a conductor whose occasional waves of emotion and conducting gyrations sometimes make even Leonard Bernstein look sedate, then you will be rewarded by some beautifully expressive music.

This Wagner concert provides a good idea of how powerful and expressive Wagner's music was even without the words in his operas.  The Rienzi alternately moves one almost to tears and then to exhilaration.  The Siegfried's funeral march from Gotterdammerung takes us through the mournful emotions of sorrow, almost sinking into an abyss of despondency.  Of course, following Siegfried's funeral, the prelude to Die Meistersinger is so powerfully proud and strutting that, after the prelude, the concert is interrupted by bursts of cheers from the Tokyo audience.  Before the final work is played, a bouquet of flowers is presented to the surprised conductor.  Then, the concert wraps up with a ""bubbling-with-energy"" performance of the Ride of the Valkries.

Whether you want to see a unique or perhaps rather idiosyncratic but passionate conductor, or a program of the music that shows Wagner to be the master who forever changed the world of music, this program will not disappoint you.
Please don't let Tennstedt's at times awkward or clumsy idiosyncrasies keep you from enjoying the passion of his performances.",1265414400,10,2217,5.122222222222222
