8627694,1,B00GUXMVZ8,"Not what I expected at all. Very poor picture quality, it was recorded from a foreign headbangers ball. Its a vhs to dvd transfer. Not satisfied.",1436140800,12,145,4.615384615384615
8627695,1,B00GUXMVZ8,"I ordered this thinking it was a King Diamond DVD (as described). It was not, in fact, none of the songs or interviews that were on the back cover in writing were on the actual DVD. I enjoy Mercyful Fate (which was the DVD I received-a very bad copy of it) but I was ordering a King Diamond DVD. Very disappointed.",1403395200,19,314,4.163934426229508
