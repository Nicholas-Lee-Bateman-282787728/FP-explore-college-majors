8092064,5,B000BT96ZA,"The Tragedy of the Munich Games aka One Day in September, 2000 film

It starts with an interview of a widow. Next that of a Palestinian revolutionary (who is still in hiding). We see men training for combat. The Olympics were held in Munich in 1972. Security was kept lax. The Palestinians planned to attack on September 5. The East Germans allowed some Palestinians into the Olympic Village to scout the location. The Palestinians attacked and captured Israeli Olympians and offered to trade them for the release of Palestinians imprisoned in Israel. There was no deal. This event attracted international attention on television, radio, and newspapers. The German police tried to get information about the terrorists while delivering food, but failed. Solving this problem was left to the Germans. The Olympic Games were suspended.

The deadline for a decision drew near. One athlete had been killed. German Border Guards were chosen for a surprise attack with machine guns on the Palestinians, but the order never came. This news was broadcast on television and the Palestinians were warned. They changed their demand for a jet plane that would take them and their Israeli prisoners to a friendly Arab country. The Germans planned to prevent this from happening. A Boeing 727 would be used as a decoy so snipers could shoot the terrorists at the airport in the open. But the Germans underestimated the number of terrorists. The lights went on and the shooting began. The snipers failed to shoot them all. The wrong men were shot! Armored cars were late in arriving. The first reports said all hostages were saved! This was soon corrected with the tragic results: none of the eleven hostages survived the attack. There was official mourning. Then the Games continued. The five dead Palestinians were sent to Libya. The three surviving terrorists were freed in exchange for a hijacked airliner. This was a conspiracy between the German government and the Palestinians.

The German government formed an anti-terrorist unit. Israeli assassinated two of the surviving terrorists and some bystanders. The lone survivor survived attacks and lives in hiding somewhere in Africa with his wife and children.",1343347200,,2199,5.136871508379889
8092065,5,B000BT96ZA,"I agree with the comment to "" ignore the one star rating"" made by another reviewer. This documentary DOES have comments from a few Palestinians, modern athletes who were involved with the 1996 Atlanta Olympics. The chairman of their Olympic Commitee comments on putting the events of the Munich Olympics behind them, and moving forward. Which is precisely the same message expressed by the families of the slain Isrealis in this documentary. Very well presented account of the crisis, presented largely by the guys from ABC Sports who were there. With film footage and contemporary reports from start to finish, this is a ""must see"" for EVERYONE , as an eye-opener to the failure of terrorism to quench the human spirit.",1233792000,4,720,4.958677685950414
8092066,5,B000BT96ZA,"Ignore the one-star review above. This excellent documentary is not intended to be a deep exploration of why Munich happened. You can find that in the magnificent ""One Day In September"".This powerful film is

nothing more than a look at the events of September 5,1972 as covered

(brilliantly)by ABC,and the emotional memories of those who did it.

On that level,it succeeds. You will experience everything you felt that day-shock,anger,resentment. The film brilliantly intrecuts ABC's actual broadcast footage and powerful new interviews with some of the people involved. You see how the events continue to haunt them today,especially Jim McKay,who so masterfully led ABC's coverage and had one of the most powerful and memorable moments in television history when he delivered the bad news and said simply,""They're all gone"".That is something you don't forget,and it's here. This is a great documentary that should be seen.",1162771200,12,925,5.409722222222222
8092067,1,B000BT96ZA,"If you're looking for an account of this event purely from an emotional Israeli viewpoint, this video is for you. If you're looking for an unbiased presentation of pertinent facts, find another documentary.

The documentary goes to great lengths to present Jewish emotions surrounding this tragedy, from description of the psychological difficulties the athletes faced in returning to Germany after the Holocaust, to the emotional trauma Israel experienced when the athletes were taken hostage. Such reporting is insightful, however, the documentary didn't even mention the Palestinian gunmen's motives for doing what they did. While interviews of Israeli family members included discussion about them immigrating to Palestine where ""there was really nothing,"" no mention was made of the fact that the Israeli occupation fuelled this tragic event.

At the end of the documentary, the film transitions from images of masked Palestinian gunmen in Munich to airliners flying into the World Trade Center on 9/11, implying the two had some connection. The only transition between these images was the narrator saying, ""These demons have yet to be exorcised."" An uninformed viewer may likely draw the conclusion that Palestinian terrorism was behind 9/11, an irresponsible and misleading implication for a ""documentary.""",1152489600,6,1314,5.6313131313131315
8092068,5,B000BT96ZA,"There has been alot of talk about this incident whenever the Olympic roll around, but this disc gives some great coverage about what had happened.  If you are looking for a DVD that gives all the behind the scenes, this is the DVD for you.",1142121600,5,239,4.311111111111111
