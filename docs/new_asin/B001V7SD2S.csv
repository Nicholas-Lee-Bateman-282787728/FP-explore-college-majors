8345549,3,B001V7SD2S,Well i was informed by someone who has seen the series all the way through and well its not the whole first season or half but 2nd half of the first part and also it does not have subtitles or dubed for those who are into that.,1391299200,2,227,3.851063829787234
8345550,5,B001V7SD2S,"For anyone who loves the Code Geass series, this is a must-have-item, as I have said before, it plays jusy fine on my crappy American DVD player, gwahahahahaaaaa",1390608000,,161,4.785714285714286
8345551,1,B001V7SD2S,"Amazons description ""Reconfigured Blu-ray release from anime series ""Code Geass - Lelouch of the Rebellion"" featuring all 25 episodes. Includes new dubbing parts."" is completely false.

I feel bad writing this review because i love this anime series but I want everyone to be aware what this bluray is:

-This WILL play on region A blu-ray players.
-This does not contain all 25 episodes, only the last 4 of the 1st season.
-New dubbing parts?? I don't care about having an english dub but having the ability to view subs would be nice.",1389830400,10,536,4.752688172043011
