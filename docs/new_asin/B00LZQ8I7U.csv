6516989,1,B00LZQ8I7U,"By sticking with the Volume/Season labeling, for years the producers have continued to make it difficult to know what you're buying. This is a simple matter of honest labeling. Unfortunately, the clever episode titles don't (a year or more after tv viewing) provide much help (unlike South Park). How many loyal fans have bought the same shows twice?  I can't think of any other major series with this problem. After all this time, what reason, besides deliberately profiting from consumer confusion, can there be for this?",1481155200,12,523,5.0813953488372094
