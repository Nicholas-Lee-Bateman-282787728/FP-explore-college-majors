2042907,3,B0001XAOGG,"Hello friends,

Huge fan of Spidey when I was a kid. And now I bought the DVD for my kid son.
I am impressed with the animation and the action in the cartoons of the DVD.
The reasons why I did not give it 5 stars is because:

The cartoon is not made for kids. I was shocked to hear offensive words like ""Hell"" and ""Cra*"".
What are we teaching our children, that it is ok for them to speak like that since their heroes are saying that?

What happened to the classical good vs. evil cartoons.

Thanks,
Nawaf",1191283200,12,505,4.070707070707071

2042909,1,B0001XAOGG,"My son is a big Spiderman fan and so I ordered this new Animated Series.  He told me upon viewing it, that this was computer-animated.  I think it stinks and if I had known this before I opened it, I would have returned it and got my money back!!! Give me the old animation any day!",1139011200,3,282,4.017857142857143
2042910,5,B0001XAOGG,"I don't know where the editorial reviewer gets their views from, but he or she should have their eyes checked. Yes, this is one of the many attempts to get you to buy the series piece-meal. Yes you should buy the two-disk full season, its better that way, and more economical. But the series is incredible. It is an excellent show, with excellent graphics, and amazing writing. The voice cast stands out also. And anyone picking on how fast he changes into his costume, should have their brain checked, its a cartoon for cying out loud.",1115769600,4,536,4.59375
2042911,5,B0001XAOGG,"If you want all three animated dvds plus more.. just buy the entire season on the 2 disc set. These episodes are all on there plus the re-maining episodes that complete the season. Please don't be fooled by this greedy, market-mentality. I LOVE spider-man.. but, I don't want others to be taken advatage of. Otherwise, the material is A+++ which is why I still gave it 5 stars.. I don't want it to poorly affect quality Spider-Man product. :)",1082332800,25,442,4.6075949367088604
