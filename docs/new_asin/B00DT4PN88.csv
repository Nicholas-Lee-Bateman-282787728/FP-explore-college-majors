8597361,2,B00DT4PN88,"I was curious about this film, bought it and watched it,  Set in the 30s in British held Bangladesh. Our hero is a 14 year old named JHunko, would lead a rebellion against the British Overlords along with his classmates and teacher. I honestly cannot give it a good review, The Hindi's and British are armed with 'weapons' that look like they were made in a Junior High School shop class, or cobbled together out of junk found on set. The over the top acting was weak at best. Yes, its basically a propoganda film...but a poorly done one.
