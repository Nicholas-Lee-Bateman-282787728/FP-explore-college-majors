8449830,1,B004ZIELJE,this was horrible the acting was bad and the whole story just bad I would not recommend to a friend,1375315200,,99,4.0
8449831,5,B004ZIELJE,"If you are looking for high production values and great special effects, move along. But if you enjoy unusual, thought-proving, and haunting ""little films"", then do watch this film. I have no doubt that you will enjoy it.

There's much more I could say, and I hope to when I have some free time.",1367539200,,295,4.462962962962963
8449832,4,B004ZIELJE,"This movie does what limited budget, independent films do best: showcase the earnestness of young actors and filmmakers. We all start somewhere (remember Evil Dead II?) and Absent Father represents a more sophisticated start than most. You have to applaud a film where everyone is working so hard, particularly the luminous young lead, Jessica Kadish. I look forward to seeing more films from Douglas Chan.",1330992000,,406,5.2615384615384615
8449833,3,B004ZIELJE,"If the writer of this movie had a story to tell or a point to make, it got lost or distorted in the mix.  There appears to be no clear purpose for the story needing to be told.  The one stand-out was the actress who plays Raven, though she appears far too late in the movie.  This is a good movie for people who like to say ""what the?"" as the credits begin to roll.",1317254400,,365,3.84
