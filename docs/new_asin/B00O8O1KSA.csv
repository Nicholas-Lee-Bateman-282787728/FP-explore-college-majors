8682602,2,B00O8O1KSA,"Although billed as a psychological thriller, this film is actually a supernatural horror tale that is not at all suspenseful. A girl is being hunted by someone who looks like her. Geraldine Chaplin does a splendid job of acting as a neighbor who sees the double. I did not like the film.",1466553600,2,287,4.538461538461538
8682603,1,B00O8O1KSA,"Another Me is a really bad film.  It goes absolutely nowhere... the entire time.  I blame the writers for this one, because the acting is actually pretty good.

It's about a teenage girl played by Sophie Turner who at first experiences typical problems- she has classmates who give her a hard time, she gets involved in unexciting school plays, she doesn't like her mother (or stepmother- can't remember) but later we discover that something else is going on.  A mysterious woman is following Sophie around everywhere.  We don't see this woman (at least not at first) but we're supposed to feel tension and suspense that Sophie's character is feeling her presence.

These scenes are supposed to be tense because Sophie's hearing mysterious voices but can't find the source of them so they drive her crazy (for some reason *hint hint* bad writing) until she puts the clues together and realizes someone who looks identical to her is following her around.  However there's no suspense ever (even when we figure out who this mysterious girl is and Sophie confronts her), the storyline is practically nonexistent which totally destroys this film in a major way, and it's a waste of time.",1453852800,,1183,4.914572864321608
