Relaxation section was fast and vague. They say there are a 1,000 ways to de-stress yet offer very few. Beginning part is the best.",1429574400,,272,5.066666666666666
8177048,2,B000NDEWTY,When I bought the DVD I was expecting more... All that I can find on the DVD is also possible to be found written in any book about stress. It doesn't make any sense if you sit and read this things to me. I wanted more... At least it had to be cheaper... Lots of web pages give these informations about stress for free...,1215907200,3,321,4.03125

So while watching this DVD, I had more than a few ""lightbulb"" moments. Not only did I not realize that some of my normal daily routine was actually contributing to a stressful lifestyle, but as she differentiated between good stress and bad stress, I found her gentle words gave me permission to let go of the pressure and blame I put on myself for always feeling so run down.  I recommend this very user friendly DVD to anyone who wants to gain some insight into their crazy lives and work to balance life/work/family. The beautiful music and imagery add to the peaceful (and professional) presentation. This is a great start for me to gain control of my life and will be a constant companion as I build my arsenal of relaxation tools.  Thanks so much!!!",1203206400,7,865,4.503184713375796
8177050,5,B000NDEWTY,"This DVD is a MUST in this day and age for anyone to get more out of their lives with a better understanding of stress and relaxation.  It is incredibly informative in so many areas, particularly those that I never gave much thought to.  Not only is the information fascinating, but it is presented in a very professional and graphically artistic way.  I strongly recommend this DVD for everyone.  Not only is it important to watch, but it serves as a constant resource for me to review again and again.",1172793600,5,503,4.555555555555555
