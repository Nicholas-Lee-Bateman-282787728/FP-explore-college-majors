8129591,2,B000G8P222,"I collect serials and cliffhangers, so I can confidently state that there are older serials that are in far better audio/visual condition than Queen of the Jungle. Yes, it's true, clips from a silent movie are generously used, but the tragic/comical part is the dubbing of the missing audio; what was done was to have a continuous loop of garbled voices. At first it's smirk-inducing and somewhat amusing, but after a few minutes it becomes distracting, like the drip, drip, drip of a faucet in the middle of the night. The dubbing is so amateurish as to make me wonder if this was a grade school project - it's THAT bad!
As far as the plot goes, it's everything I've come to expect from this genre of that era; some people may be taken aback by the racism, lack of forethought for casting and the dialogue, if it doesn't appall you it may garner some giggles.
I watch serials because I contend that the genre contributed to the bigotry and rationale of at least two generations of viewers, perhaps more, so I believe they have social value.
You won't be mortgaging the farm or eating cold food for a month in order to purchase this, so if you're an avid collector of serials you may as well add this lemon to your collection. Queen of the Jungle is even slightly worse than Lost City, Shadow of Chinatown, The Return of Chandu, The Fighting Marines, Undersea Kingdom and The Three Musketeers featuring John Wayne.

8129592,4,B000G8P222,"""Queen of the Jungle"" from Herman Wohl Productions was released in 1935 by Screen Attractions.  It was written by Griffin Jay and directed by Robert F. Hill.

Explorers Frank Worth (Reed Howes) and Ken Roberts (George Chesebro) return to their jungle camp, somewhere in Africa, carrying supplies including a hot-air balloon, from which they hope to locate an elephant burial ground, and also a source of Radium thought to be in the area by their partner who stayed at the camp, John Lawrence (William Walsh).  Little Joan Lawrence (Marilyn Spinner) and David Worth (Dickie Jones) are playing hide-and-seek, and Joan gets into the balloon basket.  When the adults go looking for them, a lion shows up so Frank and Ken release the balloon, holding onto the ladder, but unfortunately they fall to their deaths.  The balloon, with Joan, drifts into an area inhabited by the Tribe of Mu, a savage people worshiping the ""Dread God Rad"" and collecting the nearby Radium for an oddly-dressed white guy, Kali (Lafe McKee), high priest of the Temple of Mu.  The God Rad appears to be a large stone idol which, under the right conditions, becomes animated with blazing eyes that destroy, flailing arms with claws, and who chews flaming tobacco, or something.  A sacrifice is to be made, and the medicine man, Garu (Darby Jones) carrys a child toward the idol.  But another native objects, saying the Great White God will be displeased.  Then Joan's balloon comes into sight and when the natives shoot it down with a flaming arrow, some think Joan is the daughter of the White God.  The next day they decide to place her in the lap of Rad -- if she is a goddess, Rad will protect her from the lions (oh, I forgot to mention them) that are set loose from under the idol.

Well, it would be a ""spoiler"" to say whether little Joan survives, but a bigger Joan (Mary Kornman) is in the rest of the serial.  And surprise, a bigger David Worth shows up, looking a lot like his father (Reed Howes).  David is almost sacrificed, but eventually he gets through to Joan, who has forgotten how to speak English even if it is Kali's native language.  David and Joan try to escape, facing many dangers including lions, leopards, snakes, knife-wielding apes, and blindness by voodoo-poisoned water, mostly provoked by either Kali or his associate, Garu the medicine man, who uses a few disguises.

While a cheaply-produced jungle picture, it made much use of footage from the 1922 serial ""The Jungle Goddess"" with Elinor Field and Truman Van Dyke, the original of which is now mostly lost due to film deterioration.  We get stock footage of wildlife; ostrich, giraffes, zebras, hyenas, elephants, chimpanzees, crocodiles, lions, and leopards.  There's even a white, English-speaking ""leopard lady"" (actress unidentified) who helps guard the radium deposits with her ""pets.""  The intercut new scenes do not always blend well with the old footage, which runs about 50% fast, the difference between sound and silent film speeds, especially apparent when the natives are performing a sacred dance.  And while the 1922 serial had good production values, the new footage is of a lesser order.  It might have helped especially in the opening scenes if the sound hadn't been recorded with the picture; the people running around make rather loud thumping noises on the jungle floor.  But while the perils tend to be redundant, with seven of the eleven cliffhangers involving attacks by wild beasts, the plot, guided by that of the original serial is inventive if not too logical.  The unintentional humor also helps keep it interesting.  The music is surprisingly good for an ""independent"" serial of 1935, credited to music director Hal Chasnoff.  Special mention should be made of an uncredited actor, a pipe-smoking booze-guzzling chimpanzee from the original serial.  Would that all serial-movie ""comic"" characters were as good.

Alpha's edition, # ALP 5144D is on a single disc.  The sound is fairly clear and the picture is not bad in contrast and sharpness, but some ""ghosts"" appear, noticed especially in the chapter titles where the white lettering has a dark background.  In one chapter this has a momentary effect on the horizontal sync.  The problem can happen if the video is taken from an over-the-air broadcast, but might also be from some form of crosstalk between adjacent tracks of a videotape.  None of the normal ""videotape artifacts"" are seen, like ""flagging"" at the top of the screen, though there is a small extra dark band near the bottom of the frame that could be hiding the head-switch-point glitch.  Alpha puts their logo in the upper right corner during the opening and closing titles, at fairly low intensity so it isn't too annoying, and there are no ghosts on that image.

An entertaining if somewhat repetitive serial, ""Queen of the Jungle"" is best watched with a day or so between chapters.  It deserves a better transfer, but until that happens Alpha's edition is adequate, and at the price a good value.",1307232000,8,5002,4.902612826603326
