2514052,5,B000EBFJR4,I tried this tape for weight loss and found an added benefit as it has cured my insomnia!  Suzanne Andrews has the most soothing voice I have ever heard.

Since retirement I have found a new and exciting way to continue to stay conditioned with the exercises in this DVD.

8108219,5,B000EBFJR4,"There is nothing I enjoy more than referring my audience to a resource that has walked the path themselves. As soon as you hear that the expert has lost 60 pounds themselves on the program, you immediately regard the material as credible. And why not? If it worked for them, it should work for us too, right? Makes sense to me!

Suzanne Andrews is the President of Health Wise Exercise and the Host of Functional Fitness, PBS TV; where they proclaim: ""We put the FUN in FUNctional Fitness!"" She is also the author of a renowned article: ""How Mediation Helps You Lose Weight"".

According to Suzanne: ""Meditation is without a doubt the most important step you can do to lose weight. How can a sedentary activity help you lose weight? We are neglecting the most critical aspect of successful weight loss - our minds. If your mind/body were a business, your mind would be the CEO and your body would be the subordinate employee following orders.""

On the site you'll learn how meditation increases your self-awareness so that you are more in sync with what you are doing. It is about bringing your body, mind and spirit in focus so that you can achieve your weight loss goals.

How I would explain it is that it is like the case of the body telling your mind that the chocolate cake would make you feel good. Most times, people simply cave in and succumb to the physical temptation. But it doesn't make your body feel good - OK maybe for a moment or too but quikly it begins to drag your body down and causes you problems - especially if you are already over weight or suffer from obesity. Like Ms. Andrews says, if your mind/body were a business, your mind would be the CEO and your body would be the subordinate. Could you imagine your employee telling you to do something that you knew would harm your business? It's nonsense.

Take control of your body by declaring what is good for it and what is not good for it. That is why we talk so much about empowering photos in other articles. Because as you see yourself looking slim and healthy, you gain confidence that you can succeed on your weight loss journey. And the confidence allows you to recognize that you do not really want the chocolate cake because that actually means more pain and it is not in alignment with your goals. It's like anything else in life, you want to keep your goals at the center of your attention.

Ms. Andrews points out how something magical happens when you meditate. Not only do you gain control over your body but you eliminate the impact of stress in your life.

Health Wise Exercises offers a 35 minute CD, complete with a choice of 4 effective meditations including a 14 minute weight loss meditation to motivate you to get the weight off once and for all! Snooze to lose and listen to it at night for fast weight loss. Designed by Suzanne Andrews, PBS Functional Fitness Host with renowned Psychologist and author, Dr. Marcella Bakur Weiner, as a motivational tool for weight loss and highly effective for stress release.

Suzanne offers more than 25 years of experience and you will be amazed at how easy weight loss is when you start with the mind. All of the diets and sacrifice that you have made to this point in your weight loss journey have been more brutal than they had to be - and it is all about making a simple mental shift in your thinking.

Meditation is powerful and it is easier than you think. By leveraging the audio program you will be in the driver's seat once and for all.",1282608000,,3480,4.493670886075949
8108220,3,B000EBFJR4,"Due to joint and muscle problems, my Dr recommended Yoga.  He sent a list of videos to choose from.  This is OK.  However, a little more advanced than beginner.  The shipper was excellent, product delivered as promised.",1252713600,,219,4.837837837837838
8108221,5,B000EBFJR4,"I was looking for an exercise DVD that would provide a good, but not too demanding stretching routine. I was very pleased with this DVD--just what I wanted.  But it may not be what some are looking for if they expect a good yoga workout.",1252368000,,237,4.266666666666667
8108222,5,B000EBFJR4,"As a yoga instructor myself, I am always on the lookout for quality programs that deliver! The best thing about this DVD is Suzanne's energy -- she is so sincere and encouraging. This is great for anyone who wants to feel better and have fun at the same time!",1242777600,6,259,4.3061224489795915
8108223,5,B000EBFJR4,"I just tried the DVD for the first time after it arrived and I am very glad that I decided to buy it. This is a gentle set of exercises that I can imagine following daily. While it is true, as the author of an earlier review noticed, that the exercises are not integrated in a seamless routine, and there are pauses, I think that is not a disadvantage. You can start at your own pace and then integrate your routine as you become more proficient with each exercise. I appreciate Ms. Andrews positive spirit and gentle tone, and the careful way that she guides us throught the exercises. After going through the set once I was not terribly tired, but I felt a difference, especially around my chest and back, and in general I had a feeling of calmness and tranquility. Before deciding to look at the tape, I had been feeling slow and slightly depressed. This disappeared after I finished the tape, so I count this as a positive result of this program. Thank you to Ms. Andrews and to all who produced this DVD. I will continue using it and I look forward to trying the relaxing CD that accompanies it.",1233014400,9,1100,4.397058823529412
8108224,5,B000EBFJR4,"Finally a video that overweight people can do!  All the other yoga video's I've tried are for skinny people.  With this DVD I can even sit on a chair and I'm not rushed.  Suzanne Andrews gives you time in between to get into the next pose.  Something us larger people can appreciate.  There is no going down on the floor, unless you want to.  I really like the weight loss meditation too, it's a great motivator that helps me stick to my diet.  This DVD is very unique.  It's about time someone thought of us larger people.",1221955200,4,523,4.319587628865979
8108225,5,B000EBFJR4,"My wife is a physical therapy practitioner and rehab director who is often asked to recommend a good yoga DVD for seniors.  She recommends this DVD for seniors who want to lose weight and need a gentle program to do it.  The exercises are very therapuetic and attainable, especially if you are overweight and need to start off slow. The DVD begins with standing exercises and follows with exercises where you sit down on a chair.  You are encouraged to hold on to the wall for balance if you need to during the standing portion.  Seniors will love this because, there is no need to get on the floor.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Yoga-Chi-For-Energy/dp/B0015VKX28/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Yoga Chi For Energy</a>ASIN:B000EBFJR4 Beginners Dynamic Yoga for Stress Release and Weight Loss As Seen on TV]] The breathing instruction on this DVD is the best I've ever seen and a great stress reducer.

8108226,5,B000EBFJR4,"I feel like this DVD was truly made for beginners.  I have arthritis and chronic back pain and following the easy to understand directions has alleviated both conditions.  Unlike other programs, this DVD gives the user enough time to get into the next pose without being rushed.  At my age I NEED that!  The meditation CD that came with the DVD was so relaxing it took away my urge to eat during stressful times and really helped motivate me.  I really liked her soothing voice and she's easy to look at too.",1193270400,27,508,4.478260869565218
8108227,2,B000EBFJR4,"I ordered this DVD hoping to start a yoga routine that would, as the title suggests, help me ""Release Stress and Lose Weight"".  I am very dissapointed and after watching once (as suggested) and then participating the second time.  I feel confused as to what I am supposed to gain from this or how to put it to use daily.  While she, Suzanne Andrews, does present and demonstrate some yoga poses and moves it is choppy and there is no routine to it at all.  The pauses in between poses are distracting and I don't find her voice or facial expressions to be soothing or natural.
I am very sorry to say I spent good money on this one!",1171670400,13,631,4.277310924369748
