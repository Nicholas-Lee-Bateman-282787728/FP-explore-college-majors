252305,5,6300215350,One of my all time favorite movies.  Should have been a big hit.  The acting is great and the entire thing is hilarious.  I have watched this movie several times.  We even have it on VCR tape.,1453766400,,192,4.108108108108108

The movie has a great ensemble cast who are obviously having ""fun"" themselves.  Michael Caine, Valerie Perrine, Brenda Vaccaro, Leonard Rossiter, and Billy Connolly play off one another to the point of hysterics. Brenda Vaccaro is fantastic. Micael Caine's sense of comic timing is spot on. The movie spoofs and pokes at any number of topics whether it be capitalism, environmentalism, colonialism, and a few other ism's that don't pop immediately to mind. I would imagine that most people reading these reviews have seen this movie before and are looking to add to their personal library. This edition is the original Anchor Bay packaging and cover art.

Now it takes a lot to make my aunt really laugh at a movie, so I went over to her house and watched.  I LOVED IT!!!  The dialogue is reminiscent of the screwball comedies of the 30's and the Reggae musical score is perfect for the Carribbean setting.  All the characters are excellently done and the performances a treat to watch. The plot is absurd enough to be a wonderful parody of reality.
The story stars Michael Caine as the governor of this impoverished island and his dry delivery is so low key that you want to see him in every scene, and he usually is.
As Governor of Cascara, a small and very poor British protectorate in the Caribbean, he despairs of ever getting a better posting due to his unfortunate marriage to a South American girl of dubious background, played beautifully by Brenda Vaccaro.  She had been a dancer and the Governor proposed while apparently under the influence.
The island, unlike most Caribbean islands, has no beach, only a rocky shoreline so no chance of tourism in a area of the world just awash with tourists and their dollars.  Also, the only crop on the island seems to be a form of hemp, otherwise known as marijuana.  The Governor's crop is particularly good.
There is a fly in the ointment, of course, and it is the ""Singing Rebel"", played wickedly by Billy Connolly.  He wants to free the down trodden people of Cascara, a la Che Guevara.  His main problem is ALL the people are downtrodden and really don't pay any attention to him but he keeps lurking in the shrubbery and trying to get arrested.
All runs along as ineptly as possible until the British government decides that this is a drain on their economy and they are going to give Cascara its freedom.  This is quite a surprise for the Governor, as he has written innumerable letters asking for aid for his island and has less than no response.  Britain sends a representative to inform the people and the Governor of their decision.  This is when things go from bad, but funny, to awful, but awfully funny!
I highly recommend it.  I immediately bought it and have repeatedly watched this gem.  It never gets old!  Buy it and enjoy!!!",1093651200,4,2254,4.517241379310345

Caine is splendid as the 'gone native' consul and Billy Connolly excels in an early film role as a half-English half-Cascaran islander, whose sympathies are definitely with the Cascarans. There are also some wonderful musical numbers, featuring George Harrison, Ringo Starr, Jon Lord, Eric Clapton, and Connolly himself, proving himself to be a superb singer as well as a fine actor.

Hot Toasty Rag, December 2, 2017

Starring Michael Caine, Billy Connolly, Brenda Vaccaro, and Valerie Perrine, Water is a very silly satirical movie about greeds destruction of the simple ways of life. Michael Caine is the governor of a Britain-owned Caribbean island, and while he and everyone else on the island is peaceful and happy, when a natural resource is discovered, bigwigs visit the island to try and exploit it.

Im sure there are lots of people who will get a good chuckle out of Water, the types of people who like films like Bananas or Dr. Strangelove. Im the not the best audience member for this genre, so I didn't really like this movie. Also, its a little silly, and very obviously a movie that was made in the 1980s. But if those qualities appeal to you, you might like it better than I did. I was never a fan of the Monty Python films, and the same producer worked on Water, so that might have had something to do with my lack of enjoyment. For those with similar taste as I do, Id recommend Without a Clue for a funnier flick.",1512172800,,1064,4.423469387755102
