2983062,1,B000WLYDNM,"Even though it didn't get any support in Mongolia, I watched it since I'm a history movie buff ... and I hated it.

The reason why it didn't get any support in Mongolia is, because Sergei Bodrov, the director guy, said he was gonna show it in his movie that as if Genghis Khan, (it's actually Chinghis khaan, but whatever makes you guys feel comfortable), was captured by the Chinese and lived as their prisoner for 10 years. The Mongols took it as an insult on the whole Mongol nation, since almost all Mongolian academics don't think he was a prisoner. This ""prisoner-for-10-years"" part of Genghis's life is highly disputed one among the many other foreign historians. But it's not the reason that I hated the movie since I think he could've been a prisoner, because some of the most respected historians said he was.

Now I tell you why I hated the movie.

First, it shows as if Genghis's 2 older kids (Sergei Bodrov only shows 2 in the movie) were bastards that were fathered by some Chinese merchants and what nots. How much more can you insult the man and twist the story of a man who is considered as nation's father. Since I can assure you that I read lot more books on Mongols' history than Bodrov has, I can say for sure that ""I KNOW all 4 boys, who later divided the empire up after their father's death, were Genghis's!""

Then, also it didn't show much of the nomadic warriors' armors & etc. from that era, like the way it was. Typical Russian portrayal of the Mongols as if they were bunch of nothing-but-fur-wearing, half-barbarian, hairy dwarves! Talk about the revenge for being dominated for some hundred years, huh?

Just to mention few. I mean if someone's gonna make historical movie make it the way it was. Don't change it, twist it, mispresent it! Compared to this, ""300"" may look more realistic. :D Just kidding.

But seriously, Mr. Bodrov, I understand you're in entertainment business, and you love fantasizing things. But if you're reading this, I hope you think about the decisions you made already, and I hope the sequels you're gonna make for this movie come closer to the reality.

ADD: I just read Bodrov's interview on the newspaper. When he was asked about whether there is a book that was written by the Mongols on the Mongols history, he flat out said ""NO."" So what about ""the Secret History of the Mongols?"" What more can I say about this man's ""historically-accurate-fantasy-movie?""",1209859200,18,2419,4.6510538641686185
2983063,5,B000WLYDNM,"I saw this film in Tokyo last week. There were Japanese subtitles and the dialogue was in either Kazakh or Mongol, but I generally knew the story. The setting and scenery was very authentic. The portrayal of Mongol life and warfare was the best I ever saw.
The special effects were impressive. The storms were something to remember. This was especially true about the climatic battle scene at the end of the movie. The battle scene was as good as those in ""Alexander"" just a few years ago.
Please bring this film, and its sequels to the US.",1209081600,,540,4.520408163265306
2983064,3,B000WLYDNM,"Beware this has the original Mongolian language but it is overlayed with a Russian translation - not a separate language track but Russian on top of Mongolian. There is no ability to select separate language tracks. There are no subtitles; I had hoped for English. I believe the DVD is a Russian product.

2983065,4,B000WLYDNM,"An intricate examination of the life of Temudjin and his journey to becoming Genghis Khan, Sergei Bodrov's Mongol awes with gorgeous imagery, visceral battles, and powerful storytelling. As epic as the film feels though, it leaves you with the desire for more - both in the jumps in the Khan's ascent to ruler and in his reshaping of a kingdom once such power is attained.

While many have heard of the historic conquests of Genghis Khan, few probably know the story of his rise to power. In fact, no one probably knows the real story, as historical records of his early life are scarce and often conflicting. But here a grand tale is told, with enough embellishments and creative liberties to portray an honorable leader and the events that shaped his eventual quest to unite a people. Whether any of it is true or not, the hardships, betrayals, vengeance, and warring that Mongol inflicts upon Temudjin makes for entertaining storytelling. The culture and customs of the Mongolian people remain genuine, and such traditions and presentation create the authenticity required to believe in the noble leader and his perilous undertaking.

Though marketed primarily as an action epic, Mongol focuses heavily on the love story that envelopes much of Temudjin's young adulthood and the tumultuous relationships with other Khans that lead to many of the major conflicts he faces. Continually separated from each other, Temudjin and his wife Borte must alternatingly rescue each other from dire situations, and the film suggests that his wife's strong character played an important role in the Khan's decisions. Temudjin's mission to rescue Borte brings him in contact with Jamukha and through ensuing misunderstandings and backstabbing tactics they eventually become bitter enemies. Though their warring again leaves him apart from Borte, their love transcends anything that might distance them. Revenge and betrayal also play heavily into Temudjin's tortured childhood and his numerous enemies constantly seek to destroy all that he has accomplished.

While bloody warfare and intense battles are certainly a highlight, the film's strongest feature lies in exceptional acting by a diverse group of talent. Tadanobu Asano gives a solemn, commanding performance as the Khan plagued by ever more harrowing obstacles and creates a heroic character both intriguing and compelling. His unfaltering wife Borte is played with compassion and power by the understated Khulan Chuluun, and the scene-stealing Honglei Sun provides a villain with intelligence, malevolence, and bouts of crazed lunacy.

Reminiscent of the progression of Kingdom of Heaven, Mongol depicts the wondrous events that lead up to an even more monumental feat, and we're left with only our preconceived notions and a brief written epilogue that informs us that this is only the beginning. The early life of Genghis Khan that Bodrov has envisioned is fascinating enough that we want to see what happens next, and we might as rumors of a trilogy surface, but for now an epic beginning will have to suffice.

2983066,5,B000WLYDNM,"Mongol () is a movie that came out in 2007 by Sergei Bodrov depicting the early life of Genghis Khan and the beginnings of the Mongol Empire in the late 12th century on the Mongolian Steppes. The intended adventure trilogies main cast is as follows:  Tadanobu Asano, Sun Honglei, Chuluuny Khulan, and Amadu Mamadakov.
During the Year of the Black Rat Temujin is held captive by the Tangut. The movie is a narration of Temujins own life to his present circumstance. These flashbacks begin with him as a young boy, riding along with his father, in search of a bride from the Merkit Tribe. They stop at a neighboring group and Temujin tricks his father into letting him choose a future bride from that group of people. Upon returning home, Temujins father is fatally poisoned, making Temujin Khan in his stead. His own warriors begin looting his fathers camp, and only through Mongolian tradition (not killing children smaller than a cart wheel) does Temujin survive; only to be taken captive later by his fathers men later on. He escapes to reunite with his future bride only for her to be taken during a Merkit raid. Temujin goes to the new khan for help, and in a years time would be able to attack the Merkits. Him and the Khan begin to feud with the death of the Khans brother, and they both go to war. Temujin is defeated and made a slave and eventually sold to the Chinese, despite a warning from an advisor monk. He later escapes with the help of his wife to rebuild his warband in an attempt to unify Mongolia.
The historical aspect of the movie is phenomenal. It takes a lot of work to make a historically accurate yet appealing movie, and although not everything is 100% accurate, it is the little details that people will nitpick more so than the major things. We will start by the use of Horses in Mongolian society. It shows, in the movie, almost as many, if not more horses than Mongols. The Mongolian people lived off of their horses. The use of the cart in executing prisoners, the rules that the traditional mongols lived by all are historically accurate as well as the swaying of the political pendulum of the political structure in the Mongolian steppes.
I find anyone who takes a liking to history should give this a movie a go. I found it highly interesting and following a historical timeline. The movie in and of itself, to my view, found the fine line between entertainment and historic equivalency. The actors starred fairly well and as for directing and shooting I would give it 4 stars out of 5. The battle scenes got a 5 star rating in my book as feign tactics and raiding were highly used by the Mongols In that time period and beyond.",1490140800,,2662,4.545833333333333

2983068,4,B000WLYDNM,"Mongol by Sergei Bodrov was a film made in 2007 that won several awards from film festivals and academies from around the world. This was a drama set in Mongolia in the late 1100s to early 1200s. Tadanobu Asano portrayed Temujin or later known as Genghis Khan.
 The movie starts with Temujin and his father going to meet a rival tribe to marry one of their women to bring peace to the two tribes. Temujin is only a child at this point. He ends picking Borte at another village they visit and they ride off and meet their enemy who poisons Temujins father leaving a dispute of who become Khan. Targutai takes control of the tribe and promises to kill Temujin when he is old enough. Temujin escapes and ends up growing up on his own. He finds and old friend Jamukha who helps him find his wife Borte. Jamukha wants to rule as Khan and have Temujin as his second in command except Temujin doesnt want to be ruled he wants to rule. This creates a rivalry between him and Jamukha. He gets captured again and sold to Zhang Jiong who imprisons and humiliates him. Borte finds him and helps him escape where they go off and live happily for a while until Temujin decides to build his own army to fight against Jamukha.
 A great aspect of this film is the cinematography. It was beautifully shot with gorgeous landscapes and superb angles. One scene that comes to mind is when they go to attack the Merkit tribe when they were going through the rocky terrain and get ambushed by the Merkit. That and the countless scenes of the vast open plains of Mongolia that really put into perspective just how large the areas they covered were.
 Another great aspect of this film is the costume design. Although its not a huge part of the film all the costumes in this movie were well designed. The best is towards the end of the movie when Temujin is observing his army the armor hes wearing looks just like something Genghis Khan would wear during those times.
 Overall, I give this movie about an eight out of ten. It was well made and well shot however historically it may not be so accurate. No one knew the early life of Temujin before he became Genghis Khan there was just no real evidence to support this film for its historical accuracy. Making this more of a fictional epic of the early life of Temujin than a true story. However if you are interested in history and the story of Genghis Khan I would recommend this movie as it is the best representation of Mongolia during this time.",1488931200,,2474,4.430769230769231

I enjoyed the movie and found it to be interesting and fantastic.  The movie has a Russian Director.  If this movie had a Chinese director the film may have been seen in a different way.  Tadanobu Asano is Temudjin.  He be more familiar as Hogun in the two Thor movies.  As a Japanese actor he portrays Temudjin very well.  The movie tells the story of Temudjin in a series of flash backs.  There were a few times I got a bit lost by this technique.  but I was able to figure things out. The story is well told and well directed and I wish the other parts of the story had been made. I found some of the Mongol customs were interesting.

It is a co-production of Russian, German and Khazakstan resources and hence a definitely more realistic spin to this great warrior and conqueror's rise. Cinematography did justice to sweeping views of the Mongolian steppes from desert to more hilly grounds.

2983101,5,B000WLYDNM,"Out of all the more modern movies about the life of Timudjin or Genghis Khan, which is a title meaning ""The leader of all Khans."" this is the best! My biggest regret is that they were not able to fulfill their original plan of making this the first installment of a trilogy!  I have seen John Wayne & Omar Sharif play the role of Genghis Khan, & after seeing the brilliant job done on the movie Red Cliff I thought the time was right to get this movie made by the peoples closet to the Mongols that are making movies!  This comes close to what I have been waiting for, the cinematography is beautiful as well as the costumes being period correct. But this movie is exactly what the title claims, the story of Timudjin's rise to gaining the title of the Khan of Khans, had they been able to produce two follow up movies they could have shown the amazing variety of cultures Genghis Khan absorbed into his great army, which would have included the heavily armored Calvary of the Sarmatians, Moasian's as well as the Avar's, Maygar's, Tar Tars & many other cultures that made up the ""Mongol Hordes of Genghis Khan"" I think the average person has no idea of how varied his great army was & that it included people with blonde hair & blue eyes or how his peoples benefited from his reign!  While Genghis Khan may not have brought technology to the peoples he conquered like Alexander the Great did, Genghis Khan sent the culture back to his people after conquering. I guess I am just tired of the incorrect history around the man that tends to teach he was a mindless barbarian who's people didn't benefit from his great achievements on the battle field. It is very refreshing to see Genghis Khan portrayed by an Asian actor & the cinematography showing the beauty of the southern Russian steppes is awesome! The battles are well done but more importance should have been placed on the use of the Bow, lasso & bolo's in the early battles of the tribes.

The movie is dramatically shot with very beautiful technique with beautiful music score. I think some here mentioned that the armor worn by the Mongols was slightly different than the ones in the set and some have questioned the exact historical lines...but for me this movie is still great as entertainment and more so as an inspiration by learning the core of a past leader who had some truly salient characteristics.

I think Chinggis Khan was a brave person with more than his share of good character and charisma. Unfortunately, the history of Mongols is mostly written by the ones who were conquered by the Mongols as their culture was far from academic so we end up with too many negative slants. However, I do believe Temujin was a great leader who cared for his people and kept promises even when inconvenient.

Having said that, it's well acted. The characters are engaging probably because they were interesting. Unfortunately, because of the speed, the film was going; there was little time for any of them to be properly developed. This I felt was unfortunate as the people presented were very different to us, and I felt it would have been fascinating to get to know them better.

The filming was outstanding. The scenes they obviously spent a lot effort to make them authentic, it was an excellent job. So one point here unless you have a big scene, you are going to miss much.

2983115,5,B000WLYDNM,"This is a movie on the scale of what Hollywood was once capable of. It isn't and doesn't have to be historically perfect in every detail of accuracy. There are so many movies based loosely on historical legend that succeed in weaving history with story-telling why single this one out as not being ""historically accurate"". Will the first person who saw the movie who actually witnessed life in the 12th century please step forward and tell us all exactly what went on every day in the life of Genghis Khan? Yet some reviews lean toward criticizing the film's accuracy based on other movies they have seen or books they have read. Bottom line ... this is a movie, not a history book.

I am no more qualified than anyone to  discuss how accurately this movie portrays the life story of Genghis Khan, though as a descendent of Mongols and having traveled extensively in the footsteps of Tem&uuml;jin by way of foot, camel and jeep I can say that much of what I saw such as the sharing of milk, the blessing over it, the drunken parties, the relationships of the Mongolians with their families and with each other, and the background scenery of much of this movie is dead-on accurate. I've been there ... the movie, in a sometimes idealized way, often shows us exactly what Tem&uuml;jin himself saw 900 years ago.

Taken as a movie, not a history book, the cinematography is excellent. The music is eerily accurate as a popularized version of exactly what camel herders and local entertainers performed for me and have performed for others for centuries. The costumes were romanticized, of course, in most cases. There were times it was hard to focus that we are talking about the 12th century and the movie's costuming simply jumped all over time and space.

I am extremely happy that the dialogue of the Mongolian actors was in their native dialect (while the Chinese actors spoke Mandarin and some of the other characters spoke in a Turkic dialect). With my limited knowledge of the Mongolian language I recognized what the people I lived with in Mongolia spoke to me. The sub-titles were well done. To dub the dialogue into the local language of the movie's viewer would have utterly destroyed the movie.

I'm not sure what I expected from this movie before seeing it, maybe a preachy documentary or something featuring Tom Cruise and Kim Kardashian in the lead roles to sell at the box office, unfortunately if Hollywood made this movie that may actually have been the case. It was easy to ease into the more casual and less hammy acting of the actors who were chosen. There were no miscasts, although Honglei Sun as Jamukha might be just a little over the top with his backaches and neckaches.

Watch the movie with an open and relaxed mind and tune in on the many subtleties used to help us understand the conditions and circumstances that formed one of the most memorable people in all of history. Take time to dissect the battle scenes to see how Tem&uuml;jin progressed from being the underdog to becoming Genghis Khan, perhaps the most brilliant military strategians of all time. And do read the subtitles, there aren't that many of them.

I highly recommend this movie.",1404345600,6,3177,4.723826714801444

2983119,4,B000WLYDNM,"Some reviewers have referred to the fact that MONGOL: THE RISE OF GENGHIS KHAN is a low-budget epic, as compared to its Hollywood equivalents.  What makes this film so outstanding is its un-likeness to the Hollywood product; rather than focusing on special effects, Sergey Bodrov's film centers on Temudjin (Tadanobu Asano) and the way in which he develops the kind of iron will that transforms him into a great leader.  Although repeatedly captured by his enemies, including arch-bad guy Jamukha (Honglei Sun), he always finds a way out to return to his wife Borte (Khulan Chuluun), with a combination of brute force and low cunning.  Structurally speaking, MONGOL: THE RISE OF GENGHIS KHAN is structured around a series of conflicts between various factions in twelfth century Mongolia, each vying for power.  The prestige attached to being called ""Khan"" is so great that it attracts rival leader Targutai (Amadu Mamadakov) - although he repeatedly describes Temudjin as his brother, we know that this is a term of convenience.  Bodrov's film contains some stunning landscape shots: filmed in the wilds of Mongolia, as well as Kazakhstan, this is a visual feast, making us aware of how insignificant human beings can be when set against the world they inhabit.  It is a tribute to Asano's performance as Temudjin that he manages to transcend this feeling and come across as a genuine hero, one who could quite literally conquer the landscape.  The battle-sequences are brilliantly filmed, as are the scenes showing the Mongols galloping across the terrain on horseback: Bodrov's tracking shots are some of the best I have seen in a modern epic.  MONGOL: THE RISE OF GENGHIS KHAN is rip-roaring entertainment on the one level, but also demonstrates an alternative cinematic treatment of the epic genre.",1399420800,,1803,5.108843537414966

Temudgin had a terribly difficult life. When he was about nine-years-old, he selected his bride. His father was the 'khan' of his clan - the leader. One day the father was poisoned because he accepted a drink from the enemy.

After that, Temudgin's life was at risk, because he was to take over the position as the `khan' when he grew up. Thus, he would want revenge on the clan who killed his father, and so that clan wanted to kill him first.

It was a rule among the Mongols not to kill women or children, so the enemy clan waited until Temudgin grew older.

2983131,4,B000WLYDNM,"Mongol creates an atmosphere of a reality we moderns cannot know. We feel as if we are living in the almost prehistoric era of a kill-or-be-killed world.

The costumes, the acting, the locations, and the script are all amazing. The slow pace of the personal, intimate scenes juxtaposed against the wild animalistic fighting seemed very real. We see these humans as desperate and then gentle.

The friendship and the love relationship reveal the human longing for closeness. Temudgin learns that his own breaks in integrity  have created the self-same chaos that his people now suffer. This motivates our new khan to create laws.

This haunting story with the Mongolian language spoken, brings Mongolian history to us. The fight scenes are too graphic for this viewer, despite the fact that we know it is just makeup. Some of us are not blood-and-guts people, but the film is definitely worth our time.

2983152,5,B000WLYDNM,"As a boy, I had somewhat of a fascination with Genghis Khan (the Great King) and even drew a picture of him titled, naturally, ""Temujin,"" his actual name. I don't know what it was that attracted me; likely his cool-sounding title and world-conquering exploits.  With the exception of Iron Maiden's great instrumental, ""Genghis Khan,"" that ended my flirtation with this historical figure. That is, until I saw the Russian-made ""Mongol: The Rise of Genghis Khan"" (2007) yesterday.

As the title would suggest, the film explores Temujin's origins and what led to him becoming the great king of the Mongols and world-terrorizer. Despite being a foreign film with subtitles the movie successfully pulled me into its world and characters. The Mongols on the vast Asian steppes lived similar to American plains Indians. I've seen numerous photos of Mongols living on the steppes with their yurts, etc. over the years, but I could never relate to them as people. Just as, say, ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dances-with-Wolves-Full-Screen-Theatrical-Edition/dp/B0001GF2H4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dances with Wolves (Full Screen Theatrical Edition)</a>"" made American Natives come alive to the viewer so this film does with Mongols.

""Mongol"" eschews the American ""blockbuster"" syndrome and simply tells the story of Temujin from his early boyhood to his crowning as the great Khan. Although there's a steady amount of action throughout, there are a lot of quiet lulls with Temujin calmly waiting-out his various imprisonments and seeking Tengri, the god of the blue skies. Regardless, I found myself drawn into the characters and simple story.

I liked the fact that a monk was able to ""see"" Temujin's greatness and future world-conquering potential even though he was only a lowly slave, which others understandably couldn't see. I also liked the low-key commentary on people choosing their leaders and forsaking the less worthy, and the resulting strife, as well as the focus on Temujin's many quiet times in the wilderness seeking the Divine for wisdom and power to walk in his greatness and fulfill his dream, not that I'm suggesting Genghis Khan was God-ordained, of course. The lead actors are all great, especially Honglei Sun as Jamukha, Temujin's ""brother"" and then greatest enemy in Mongolia. Despite all this, people who require constant roll-your-eyes action and explosions will likely find ""Mongol"" boring.

Speaking of ""constant roll-your-eyes action,"" this was the very thing that ruined the recent ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Conan-the-Barbarian/dp/B004EPYZT4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Conan the Barbarian</a>"" with Jason Momoa, who was excellent in the role. That film needed more downtime, realism and depth, similar to the original 1982 version (not that that version didn't have its share of cartoony-ness), the filmmakers instead pushed for overkill action and minimal weight. The result? A mediocre Conan flick that looked great but was ultimately too shallow and goofy, in the ""action-packed blockbuster"" sense. Interestingly, ""Mongol"" reminded me of John Milius' version of ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Conan-the-Barbarian/dp/0783241895/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Conan the Barbarian</a>"" and of Robert E. Howard's Conan in general, albeit without the sorcery. I believe if the 2011 remake of ""Conan"" shot for the realism and seriousness of ""Mongol,"" as REH himself portrayed the character and the Hyborian Age, it would have been a more worthy Conan film. It goes without saying, if you like REH and Conan you'll probably appreciate ""Mongol.""

The locations are gorgeous, shot on the remote and godly landscapes of Inner Mongolia, China, and Kazakhstan.

The soundtrack is simple but effective, often just an eerie-sounding violin/cello. I found it interesting that when the credits hit a great epic metal riff kicked in for a few bars before morphing into the expected Eastern-styled credits soundtrack. It was a pleasant surprise.

If you're looking for a compelling political drama of how one man came to lead thousands -- you won't find it here.  If you're looking for a penetrating psychological profile of how a boy grows into a man who will create an empire -- you won't find it here.  The film is, over all, more a romance than anything, and even there it kind of fails to bring out the chemistry and personality of its leading couple.  Temudjin is given little serious motivation for his pursuit of his love Borte, and Borte herself is portrayed as little more than an obedient pet following in Temudjin's wake.  The film obviously suggests that their mutual motivation is ""True Love,"" but we really see very little to actually give us any sense of this.  Politically or historically, the film is very lacking.  There's a running feud throughout the film between Temudjin and his father's rival, which later comes to involve Temudjin's ""blood-brother.""  But even this personal vendetta lacks real meat in its portrayal.  The film is very disjointed throughout, with a lot of fade-outs that simply serve to jump to new scenes without explaining how the previous scene concluded.  The most egregious example of this is when Temudjin, newly freed from slavery, vows to unite the Mongolian tribes.  Fade to black...and jump four years into the future, and somehow out of nowhere Temudjin has an army at his back and is about to conclude his conquest of the Steppe tribes.  Nowhere does the film really explain how Temudjin rises to power.  As an action adventure it completely fails (there are really only two relatively short battle sequences).  As a historical biopic, the film falls short.  I will give a hand to some gorgeous scenery, but even the cinematography is a little lackluster aside from a few nicely coreographed shots.

It has absolutely no intellectual content and precious little plausibility, unless you happen to believe in soothsayers and Gods of Lightning. It's one of those ""River Platte"" films, three miles wide and three inches deep. Most of the rave reviews focus on the cinematography, especially of the Mongolian landscape. Even the visual beauty of the film is nothing worth five stars; it doesn't compare with any number of Japanese, Swedish, Italian, or even American films, the old classic ""Shane"" for instance, which was shot in the Grand Tetons region. The camera work is grand but unimaginative. For a contrast, I'd suggest the films of another Russian director: Sergei Paradjanov! His budgets were infinitesimal in comparison to ""Mongol"" but his cinematography was a hundred times more creative.

The acting is remarkably supple and convincing, given the banality of the script. Let me reassure you that Japanese actor Asano Tabanobu is way more plausible as Genghis Khan than American actor John Wayne ever was. But you'll have to indulge in some ""willing suspension"" of cultural incredulity in order to relish the mythic impassivity and imperturbality of the Mongols as portrayed here.

The battle scenes are comic book stuff. They're about as realistic as the semi-animated film ""300"" portraying the Battle of Thermopylae. It's hard to imagine that anybody really enjoys such silly showers of simulated gore. In the old-time cowboy-and-cattle-rustler films, a bullet would kill a man instantly, without a speck of blood or a twitch on the ground; this film, which is just an ethnographic ""western"" at heart, reduces death to the opposite absurdity. Men get slashed in half, despite their armor, and fake blood erupts in fountains. And there's not a flicker of humor or wit -- unless it's concealed in the Mongolian script but lost in subtitle translation.

Bottom line? Boring! Boring! Boring!",1324944000,2,2092,5.25748502994012

""Mongol"" is a collection of scenic vignettes depicting what life might have been like at different early stages in Khan's life, wrapped loosely around a rather sparse storyline involving sibling rivalry, romance and bullying. The element that I anticipated eagerly throughout most of the film and which I interpreted as being the reward at the climax - a demonstration of the charisma and human dynamics that would motivate large numbers of people to follow this man - was neglected entirely! I think this is why some reviewers wish for a sequel. The movie ends at the dawn of his military career.

Some critics dislike the casting. I think it's terrific, especially Tadanobu Asano as the stoic hero. He is memorable.

So making a movie about him that is going to be 100% realistic is not going to happen.
BUT...we do know a lot about the Mongols - how they lived, fought, and governed.  Some of that is in here.
The interaction between the Chinese and the Mongols for example, is in here.  The Khan's kidnapping, which shows him becoming tough and learning to survive, is in here.
Yet the grand battle, with archers in the ground and riders with two swords, what was that?  I wanted to see the development of Mongol tactics, the same tactics that would sweep across Asia, into the Middle East and Europe.  What we got was a Hollywood battle - and I mean that in a bad way.

2983171,5,B000WLYDNM,"This masterpiece does justice to how Mongolian world supremacy began - it started with a person who had to overcome the hugest climatic, linguistic, family, and geopolitic obstacles.  He was a survivor against all odds, not only because he was so lucky, but of supernatural-level perseverance, wisdom, and generosity.  He turned the suffering into positive energy, and he went back to save his people.

This movie also does a nice fictional / creationist treatment of why Mongolian world dominance was inevitable: people who can live in such harsh climates and eke out a nomadic living and not being tied to the land and be fiercely in love with their culture and ways - why of course they were hyper adaptable to any hardships, and could outdo and outlast everyone else.

I was surprised after I so enjoyed the movie to learn that it was Russian-financed and directed.  I wasn't expecting any Russians to be so interested in the Mongolian perspective.  Some big hearted, big picture types they must be.  And how small hearted I was to make such prejudiced presumptions.  I learned in this way as well.

2983173,4,B000WLYDNM,"Having just read a bio of Genghis Khan and the Empire his sons expanded and then squandered by in-fighting, I found this film utterly riveting and reasonably accurate historically.  The acting is also superb, with an entirely non-caucasian cast, in the Mongol language rather than dubbed.  It is a kind of character study of a political and military genius, with the personal choices he makes that reinforce his leadership, in particular the tough wife, Borte.

The film version shoehorns his life into a coherent narrative.  Born into a small unit of families, of which his father was a leader, Genghis (then ""Temeugen"") was comfortable and learned the ways of the Steppe.  This was a time of warring petty tribes that stole brides and pillaged the goods of others via constant attacks.  They had some customs, but not many.  Everything changed when his father was poisoned:  his family was ruined by a turncoat, he was enslaved after becoming a blood brother with a leader who would become his rival, and he rose to lead his own band.  Eventually, after many reversals and horrible ordeals, coupled to his military prowess, he creates a series of laws that enable him to become the Khan of all Mongols, eliminating all enemies and ending the incessant warfare, in the process creating one of the greatest fighting forces of all time.

This is a simplified version that is fairly accurate.  He was enslaved as a child, did find a great life partner in his wife, and was an inspired leader of men.  But the ""narrative"" sets up a bunch of set pieces that over-simplify things or add details that can never be known.  While he did have a blood brother he later unseated because only one of them could be leader, he did not seek personal vengeance against the many stereotypical enemies or rival kingdoms that the film highlights.  His wife also did not rescue him from a second captivity.  Nor did he preserve those who were decent to him during the many periods of struggle as a slave.  But that is the stuff of good fiction, an indulgence I can accept.

The film does romanticize him a bit too much, which is my only criticism.  The actor makes him extremely sympathetic:  you understand what he suffered and rejoice in the justice he created in his system of laws.  What you don't see is that his army continued to pillage and inflict suffering on its enemies with a brutality that was organized into larger military units.  Essentially, he turned the energies of the small tribes outward, with the same ruthless methods.

I would recommend this film as a wonderful evocation of history, but would suggest that viewers look beyond the narrative.",1288310400,,2646,4.769230769230769
2983174,2,B000WLYDNM,"The movie begins well. It sticks pretty closely to the historical sources in depicting the early life of Temujin. Tadanobu Asano, as the mature Temujin, is a bit stolid but otherwise good. Honglei Sun's Jamukha is striking--assertive, appealing, and somewhat erratic, he is believable as the sometime close friend and blood brother who becomes a rival and mortal enemy. Khulan Chuluun (a real Mongol; they are scarce in the film) is appealing and lovely. So far so good.

Sadly, Bodrov and Aliyev were not content with the real history, and simply abandoned it for fiction half way through the film. The last thirty or forty-five minutes are either wholly unhistorical yak dung or at best wild misrepresentations of actual events, on a level with that old Hollywood turkey starring John Wayne.

In addition, there are a number of needless inaccuracies of visual detail that are like gnats buzzing around the head of the informed viewer. Bows are drawn in European style (the Kazakhs involved in the production could have demonstrated the correct draw); the swords are much too curved and look ridiculous as a result; the Merkits were probably not the Siberian forest tribe shown on the screen; &c. &c.

2983175,5,B000WLYDNM,"If you want to hear a story from as close to the horse's mouth as possible, this film is it. A multi-national production, yet the heart and soul, as well as the dialog is purely Mongolian. Supposedly the first film of a planned trilogy, this is the only film of that series yet to be produced. This may be a good thing, because I do not see the possibility of any sequel surpassing this masterpiece in scope, drama or gravity. The film covers the origins of Temguin, the future Genghis Khan and it is very faithful to the Mongolian views of the great man. You will find yourself cheering for the man that most of the world has deemed ""The scourge of the world"", but to the Mongolian people he was a visionary with almost a god-like status. This film will make you understand and respect the Mongolian perspective. Well acted and with excellent cinematography, the only potential flaw may be the limited use of CGI and the violence (which can be overwhelming for the more delicate of viewers). But given the subject matter, the moments of extreme violence are fairly accurate for a brutal age. The CGI is used minimally and is never over the top, nor used at inappropriate moments .

2983177,2,B000WLYDNM,"This film was somehow nominated for Best Foreign Film at the 2007 Academy Awards, and one has to believe it's only because of its subject matter and the fact of its provenance, because its artistic quality is simply not high. In many ways, it's a B film masquerading as an A film, and one need merely to compare it to earlier epics like Ben-Hur, Spartacus, and El Cid, to see where this film went wrong, in terms of acting, writing, and the eschewing of realism for video game level special effects (the final battle scene between Jamukha's and Temjin's forces, replete with darkening skies) is especially silly.

  The DVD, put out by New Line Cinema, is utterly bare bones. Yet, this is the sort of DVD that screams for needing a commentary and/or a making of featurette, and a documentary on the historical Genghis Khan. Not that such could have justified the film's failings, but they could have at least shed light onto why certain things in the film were portrayed a certain way. While a film historian's commentary would be nice, even more elucidating would have been a scholar of the Mongol Empire and/or the Ancient Orient to discuss the schism between the film's reality and that history bears. As it is, Mongol: The Rise Of Genghis Khan, is a mess of a film- intriguing enough in its pros and historical import, to get a mild recommendation for viewing, but too Hollywood in its screenplay deficiencies and logic to recommend with much fervor. Yes, it is a true epic, in all the ways one might compare it to those of David Lean, save for one: quality. And it is in that lack that this essay's opening posit bears fruit.

2983179,2,B000WLYDNM,"I go into every movie I watch with an open mind. Some movies you sit down not knowing what to expect and find yourself being amazed. Some movies you sit down and watch knowing what you should expect but only find yourself being disappointed. That is exactly the way I felt about this film.

The acting was fine but the story... it just doesn't seem to have been presented properly in this film. There so much they skip over and there's parts that they lengthen that really should have been over and done with in the first part of the film. Instead of a story about Genghis khan a fierce Mongolian leader I get a story about a man and his love for his wife and that's really all this movie really is.

Genghis and his wife get separated some events happen and they unite again they get separated again some events happen they get united again end movie. The entire length of the film Genghis is either locked up or running away. The only impression that you get is that he is weak and a coward and can't get anything done without someone helping him. Does that depict the picture of one of histories greatest warlords?

Watching this film you get no sense of what made Genghis decide to unite Mongolians or take on rivaling nations. Most documentaries try to create a story that at least give you an idea of what makes the mind of a great man tick...this movie doesn't. I was more or less curious why he chose to stay with such a promiscuous wife who had children that were fathered by other men at the time she was married to Genghis. Why didn't she fight back? If she was raped she never showed it. The only idea the movie gives you in regards to her promiscuity is that she doesn't know how to keep her legs closed...and Genghis is a man who is head over heels in love with a woman that he barely knows (but other men know her very well).

It may sound like I'm pulling away from the movie but that is what this film is mostly about. The story of Ghengis's childhood, and his rise to power only seem like a minor subplot. It felt like everything that the movie should be showing you they skipped over and  replaced with a title screen explaining a date and what happened and then going back into the mundane story.

The highlights of the film are when Genghis clashes against another Khan whom he befriended once. This is what scored big on the movie with me as this story line is great... But there's too little of it. Things like this should be what the movie is about... not 20 minutes total of it.

I rated this movie 2 stars because honestly the 2 hours I spent watching this should have been condensed down to half an hour. The story about a leader and his wife might be great for a movie about Mary Antoinette. But this is a movie about Genghis Khan. His wife didn't unite Mongolia he did and that's what this movie should be focusing on. What horrors did Genghis see and experience that made him want to unite his people so much. What made him want to wage war against other nations?  That is what this movie should had been about.

Take the 10 Commandments for example. You see Moses care free, then you see Moses realize the cruelty around him, then you watch him change, then you watch him want to do something about it, then you watch him find a way to do something about it, then you see him return with his solution, then you see him put this to action,then you see why the people choose to follow him, and how he became such a great leader. It's that simple!

After watching this film I know nothing more about Genghis Khan than I did before it. The only impression I have of him now is that his wife wasn't very faithful.
The reason I give this movie 2 stars is because you don't turn a movie that should be about a Warlord into a love story. This movie could have and should have been done better. I don't know what the director was going for... but this... this isn't acceptable.  I only hope that one day someone can make the Genghis Khan movie that deserves to be watched.

He goes through alot and is the best of men toward her, he raises the children she has after she is raped and must sleep with other men to help free him.
That's a great story in any culture. I hope that much of the khans life is true because the rest is one of the most bloody and terrible in history. Khan is still in the top five mass killers in history! Chairman Mao is number one but he had a modern machinery of death at his disposal. (stalin, hitler, lenin, fill out the top five with khan) Mao undoubtably looked up to Khan to.  This blu ray looks gorgeous and the story is engaging. If Gengis career had ended with him unifying his savage people (this story is matched in all civilizations and races  as warlike tribal people come under a more central authority) then he'd be remembered by the world as a great leader only and not a cruel mass slaughterer of whole civilizations. alexander the great also had bad moments too though.  but in history Khan was  The worst since attila the hun in fact.  However unlike the Huns who left only ruins his decendants were the cupholders of civilization and unification. And khan didn't destroy unless you resisted him, the huns did it for plunder only with no idea of creating a empire. That places khan as more than just a mass exterminator like attila.
  This movie is fast paced enough but like all movies you most wonder how much of this happened beyond the basic facts but who cares when you get a decent story like this.  The movie is subtitled and the print looks fine. It's a good flick and blu ray is only way  to go.

Bodrov takes only a few liberties with the Secret History narrative, mostly in leaving out the character of Toghril Khan in order to make the story line easier to follow; some events involving Toghril are attributed to Jamuga. Temujin's captivity in the Tanggut Kingdom is speculation, but several historians have followed this same speculation in trying to fill in some missing years in Temujin's history.

This is a far more convincing and dramatically compelling treatment of Chinghis Khan's life than the Hollywood versions starring John Wayne and Omar Sharif.

One of the great strengths of this film is its sense of place. It really does convey the vastness and beauty of the steppe. But it also recognizes that not all the ""Mongolian"" tribes were steppe-dwellers practicing pastoral nomadism.

It also makes far more sense in explaining the origins of the Mongol Empire. The Empire was not a grand vision pursued by Chinghis Khan from his youth: it was an accident, an improvisation emerging from his battle just to stay alive, maintain the loyalty of his retinue, and reclaim his position in his tribe.",1267488000,,1560,5.062256809338521

I mention this because many people have commented about historical errors in the movie which I find ridiculous because even the foremost expert on Genghis Khan doesn't know precisely how his life unfolded and, once again, this is not a documentary. So, we will move past that altogether.

I like movies such as Braveheart, Gladiator, Troy, and Kingdom of Heaven. All big-time movies with big-time actors and budgets. I feel that Mongol fits well into the genre and I enjoyed it as much as any of the aforementioned movies. To echo what others have said, it is as well shot, has as equally impressive costuming, and production values as any of the movies mentioned earlier. Mongol also has heart in the sense that it portrays many instances of overcoming struggle and does it honorably.

This film is based on several historical works that try to tease out a personal history, based on Mongol oral traditions. It is focused almost entirely on the early life of Temujin (Genghis Khan's real name), and you frequently wish the movie was longer and filled in more gaps.

The final battle is a letdown actually (won't give away the details but suffice to say that it doesn't live up to the buildup).

2983208,5,B000WLYDNM,"Despite scenes of gross, grisly gouging (heads smashed, sharpened objects poked into and through people, and almost as much digital blood flying as in ""300""), this is actually a rather charming and affecting film. Really. The focus is on the people and their relationships, with the battles secondary. (But don't worry -- if you like seeing humans converted to hamburger, you won't be disappointed.)

The producers know what sells -- the actor playing Temudgin is Jeff-Bridges cute, and the actress playing Borte (his bride) is beautiful, without looking as if she just steppe-d (ar, ar) off the runway. But this is no Hollywood biopic (qv, ""The Conqueror""). Both the acting and direction are understated, and there are only a few Scenes Of Great Portent. Some questions are left unanswered -- such as how the wolf releases Temudgin's slave shackles and how he repeatedly escapes from his captors. But the story of Ghengis Khan is as much legend as fact, so it's not /that/ important. The film ends as Temudgin is made khan of all the Mongols, leaving room for a sequel. (""The Wrath of Khan""?)

The cinematography is outstanding, with lots of wide shots of magnificent landscapes, dotted with tiny human figures. However, in some scenes the highlights are flat and burned out. This seemed more like a technical or transfer problem, than a deliberate aesthetic choice by the director. It detracts only slightly.

This Blu-ray disk is so inexpensive, it's virtually an impulse purchase. Give in.",1257120000,,1493,5.036437246963563
2983209,5,B000WLYDNM,"The scenery is spectacular.  We are not likely to get on a tour bus to visit these remote places, so the Blu-ray is next best for the foreseeable future.  At 9.99 for the ""Mongol"" Blu-ray at the date of this review, and 14.99 for the dvd, there is something weird about the pricing.

This movie looks fictional to a large degree.  I can believe the dates.  Even with a modern almanac, the animal cycles allows one to extrapolate backwards to the exact year.  No need for the ""circa"" when the exact year can be calculated accurately.

1196 AD: the year of the politically correct Blu-ray.  The Khan's wife chooses the man and saves him from death more than a couple of times.  Without his wife running the show, Genghis Khan is just another dead mongol.

Like ""Alexander"", this movie is short on the tactics of battle.  It does not explain clearly how an numerically inferior force repeatedly defeated a superior force.  I remain curious.  ""300"", ""Midway"" and ""Patton"" clearly illustrate the tactics used.

There are sufficient battle scenes, but not enough for me.  In ""Braveheart"", Mel Gibson's captain remarked: we did not get dressed up for nothing.  In ""Mongol"", the hordes are dressed up and assembled.  Battle scenes could have been extended and made more dramatic.  What a waste of good cavalry.

""Nomad: the warrior"" (Jay Hernandez) would be an apt companion to ""Mongol"" when released on BD.  ""Nomad"" is produced with the full co-operation of the Khazakhstan government.  ""Nomad"" goes a long way to restore our respect for Khazak culture after ""Borat"" defamed Khazakhstan.  It goes to show that a movie can do a lot more for public perception than 3 page advertisements in the New York Times taken out by the Khazak government.  ""Mongol"" likewise changed perception of Genghis Khan.  ""Nomad"" is more entertaining than the pseudo-historical ""Mongol"", but ""Mongol"" was there first on Blu-ray.

All things considered, ""Mongol"" is a worthwhile addition to a BD collection.  Most of it is re-watchable.  Cinematography was outstanding.  Breathtaking and fabulous scenery, but I still would not like to be in those remote areas in a tour bus.  The locations are still in pristine medieval or 10,000 B.C. condition.

But more than just spectacular battle scenes, the movie shows a lot of the what life was like for Mongols and gives emotional nuance to all the main characters. Kahn's wife is beautiful and speaks little but conveys quite a lot.

A scene I particularly like is when Kahn and his wife are riding horseback together. They exchange coy looks until she asks, ""Don't you want to touch me?"" He replies gently, ""My touch will break you in two."" I think that sums up his character very well--he's a gentle warrior.

2983212,5,B000WLYDNM,"In MONGOL, director Sergei Bobrov presents more than a movie biography of one of the world's most ruthless conquerors.  MONGOL is the first in a proposed trilogy that will span the life and times of the man history calls Genghis Khan. Many reviewers have commented on what they saw as excessive gore reducing the dramatic thrust purporting to show the slow growth of one man with a Vision to unite all Mongols.  There is plenty of bloodletting and extended battle scenes but such glimpses into history and the Mongol psyche are needed to show how that one man could make the transition from the humblest of slaves to the Great Khan of all Mongols.  MONGOL is a traditional film of the life of a ruler that director Bobrov sees more as George Washington than Adolf Hitler.  The historical Temudgin was one of the most ruthless genocidal despots of all times.  The film hints at the Mongol practice of taking the children of beaten enemies and measuring them against the height of a wagon wheel.  All those that exceeded that height were killed on the spot.  Temudgin continued this practice for his entire reign.  When a city surrendured to him, Temudgin spared it and its inhabitants.  If it resisted, he reduced the buildings to rubble and put the residents to the sword--men, women, children.  That Temudgin is nowhere to be found here.  This Temudgin is a gentler more compassionate soul, who can even find it in his heart to forgive his bloodbrother who enslaved him and took away his family and possessions.  This Temudgin can reward a beaten army by accepting its helpless soldiers into his own forces.

MONGOL begins with a ten year old Temudgin, who is told by his father to choose a wife.  This Temudgin does but is told that he must wait five years to claim her.  His father is assassinated while his uncle claims the Khanate.  The boy grows up in solitude.  Eventualy, he reclaims his wife, Borte, only to lose her to kidnappers in the employ of his uncle.  Temudgin is captured and sold into slavery, where Borte aids in his escape.  The film moves forward in gripping scenes, all of which point toward Temudgin as uniting all Mongols under his banner.  He even posits a sort of Mongol Ten Commandments by which he swears before heaven that all Mongols must obey, even if he must slay half of them to convince the other half.  Temudgin comes across as basically a good sort, one whose traits of leadership are so apparent that he has no problem raising an army.  The actors speak in Mongol with English subtitles but simply watching facial and body language usually suffices to maintain viewer interest and knowledge.  The only major flaw is that the film merely presents as a given Temudgin's heavenly inspired traits of leadership.  Still, MONGOL is a major accomplishment that suggests that the gap between history and Hollywood may not be as insurmountable as is often the case.",1252022400,,2894,4.730538922155689

At the age of nine, Temudjin's father(Esugei), the khan at the time, shows him how to pick a wife. After doing so, the plan is for them to get married in five years. After Esugei is poisoned however, he dies and the Mongols he was travelling with take matters into their own hands. Pillaging and doing whatever they see fit. Temudjin becomes a slave and sets out to find his brother, Jamukha, who he feels is the only one who can help him. A few years pass. Temudjin, now a man, sets off to claim his wife. He winds up going through a lot of hardships in the process, but what doesn't kill you will only make you stronger. It is said that all Mongols are afraid of thunder, but what if they don't have a place to hide? They become one of the greatest Mongols in history and greatness comes to those who take it.

This movie is shot beautifully. Every shot is filled with vibrant colors and seems to be shot in a unique way. There are quite a few first person perspectives during battle sequences that are quite stunning. Seeing the blood splatter all over the camera is always a plus, in my eyes. The battle scenes are where the film truly shines. The way they're shot make you feel like you're in the middle of it all. The perspective on a lot of the angles during not only the battle sequences, but in the movie as a whole, are impressive in their own right. The music also lends a helping hand in making this movie incredible. While some of it wasn't to my liking, the majority of it fit the film like a glove and only enhanced what was going on in the film and what the characters were going through.

The main reason I checked out this movie was because of Tadanobu Asano. I've mentioned my admiration of his acting in the past, but I had heard that this was possibly the most physical role he ever had. That peaked my interest. Well that and the fact that he was headlining the film. He definitely doesn't disappoint in this and he only seems to impress me more with each film I see that he's involved with.

Mongol may not be as action packed as the trailer leads you to believe. There are a handful of really impressive action scenes, but there's a lot of character development in this as well. The acting is top notch and as I mentioned, the visuals will have your eyes glued to the screen the entire time. I think the last twenty minutes or so make this film worth seeing alone. While it isn't action packed for two hours straight, I like to think that if you're a fan of movies like 300 then you'll probably enjoy this.

2983219,5,B000WLYDNM,"This movie was as good as I'd heard it was supposed to be when it was in limited release in theaters. It traces the beginning of the rise of Genghis Khan, whose real name was Temudgin. I cannot vouch for all of the historical accuracy, but it really seems like the film makers attempted to be as accurate as possible to whatever is historically known about Temudgin's early life. The scenes on the Mongolian steppe are simply amazing.

There are gaps in the story which sometimes are confusing, which also leads me to believe that those gaps were intentionally left there, because we just don't know what happened during certain periods of Temudgin's early life. For example, in one scene he leaves his wife and children to unite the Mongols. He is seen on the scared mountain praying and asking his god for help to unite the people under basic laws. In the next scene he has an army of hundreds, if not thousands, of men and ready to face off in a final showdown against his blood brother, whom he met years earlier as a child. Unfortunately the movie doesn't explain how he got this large army.

One thing that the movie does extremely well is to explain Genghis Khan wasn't just a mythic warrior figure who laid waste to everything he came across. He was a man, and part of the reason for his success is that he cared for his people. In one early scene, his army wins a battle. Instead of taking all of the plunder for himself, he only takes 1/10th of a share and tells his army to divide the rest amongst themselves, but not to forget the families of those who died in battle. This, it seems, is the real secret to his success. He was not simply a warrior, he was an early politician that knew the secret of his success came from having the support of his people.

This is an extremely well done movie. I appreciated the fact the film makers used an all Mongolian cast and did not simply use American or Japanese actors who might have ""looked Mongolian."" The use of subtitles also did not take away one bit from the movie.

I really hope that the planned two more movies to complete the story of Genghis Khan's life are done as well as this one.",1241308800,,2149,4.391959798994975
2983220,5,B000WLYDNM,"From scale to score, from acting to cinematography, from plotline to quality, Mongol is every bit as amazing and epic as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Braveheart/dp/B00003CX95/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Braveheart</a>.  It's truly remarkable how closely the two movies resemble one another.  In my opinion, Braveheart is one of the best movies of the past twenty years, and no higher praise can be given.

As a young boy Temudgin (played brilliantly in adult years by Tadanobu Asano) learns from his father, the khan.  Bowing to his god Tengri, all of the customs of Mongol culture are passed down.  His father believes that finding a bride is one of the measures of a man, and as a nine year old, Temudgin takes Borte (Khulan Chuluun) as his own.  But when his father is killed by deceitful enemy offering a false peace offering, Temudgin must fend for himself at an early age.  After his father's death, he soon bonds with a loyal friend in early childhood - a relationship that both saves and curses him later in life.  As the years progress, he transforms from vulnerable young Mongol boy into a vibrant, unmatched warrior who causes equal parts fear and envy in all those view him.  His dream of a united Mongolian force is yet another threat which may separate clans.

Visually speaking, I have never seen a more beautiful movie.  Bountiful green valleys, oxbows snaking back and forth, barren grasslands so lifeless that their appearance alone kills wildlife, exploding mountain ranges climbing over one another, massive white snow banks that extend to the horizon and beyond into blindness; enough credit cannot be given.

For the cinematography and artistic quality alone, this movie is worth a viewing.

One part warring clans of Braveheart, one part suffering slave trade of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Apocalypto/dp/B000NOKFHQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Apocalypto</a>, this movie is every bit a tour de force that is nearly incomparable except to other visual masterpieces that take a few hours to watch but several months to forget.

While not as awe-inspiring as the film work, the battles provide enough to entice the most hardcore, bloodthirsty warfare zealot.

This isn't the story of conquest, but a story of love, forgiveness, and detachment from the material.  Before the great Khan became the man to take away others' freedom he had to find his own.  Bodrov's movie is a close up on an undeviating flight of consciousness powered by personal ethics (operating from Kohlberg's highest stage of moral development, that stage in which a mind makes its own rules, balancing on the brink of enlightenment and sociopathy).  Bodrov reveals the spirituality of the motive: ""never betray your khan,"" i.e. the spirituality of integrity (in the sense of being true to your self, with any given ""khan"" being nothing more than a projection of one's Self with which one later identifies).

In Bodrov's interpretation, Genghis' military success seems to owe more to the integrity of his army and secularity of leadership (that did not impose its religion but only law and taxes) than to military acumen.  The Mongol conquest, unlike, say the Crusades, did not seem to attempt to rob people of their psychological sovereignty but only of the attempts to possess that which doesn't belong to anyone anyway, in a kind of bloody spiritual detoxification and re-prioritization.
Who knows?!  But what a beautiful interpretation.
Cinematographically, the movie has the best of that Dovzhenkesque (a school of Soviet cinematography) slow-motion focus on detail, exemplified in such visually and metaphorically rich scenes as; falling through the ice, from the snow-white surface of the day, into the murky underwater of the unconscious; the shamanic communion with the wolf essence; Khan's brother's spin-around-and-slide-into-the-sleeves-of-an-offered-sable-coat harmony of uninterrupted physical flow of a relaxed mind; etc, etc.

The cast and characters are amazing: Temujin's psychopathic calmness, Jamukha's face-saving mannerism of throwing back his head in demonstrative acceptance of ""what is,"" Borte's inspiring beauty and non-interference with Temujin's existential trajectory (despite her obvious romantic attachments and preferences).

Bodrov's emphasis on choice - in Brother, in Mongol - reveals an existential commitment of his own, a commitment to finding the humanity of motive behind the inhumanity of action.

2983223,4,B000WLYDNM,"""Mongol"" may not be the grandly epic tale of conquest that one would imagine the great Genghis Khan to have, but it takes the shell of the khan's life story and builds around it a portrait of life in the steppes. It starts with the humble origins of Genghis Khan as Temudgen, the juvenile son of a minor khan. When his father dies, he is labeled a threat by other players in the clan and is slated to die. Following a series of trying but miraculous events, Temudgen grows up and finds his betrothed Borte and takes his rightful place as khan of his clan. He sees the constant war between the clans and vows to unite all clans under a simple set of laws that would lay the foundation of the Mongol Empire.

 It is no secret that ""Mongol"" takes many liberties with the life of Temudgen. Many characters are amalgams of multiple historical figures and certain events in the film are completely fabricated. It adds a level of drama to the film and provides an intriguing layer of suffering to Temudgen's life. If one were trying to watch an accurate historical drama, this film is not that. What it does accomplish flawlessly is the bare bones and beautiful culture of the Mongol nomads. Though it depicts a culture steeped in constant strife, ""Mongol"" shows the complexities of the Mongol politics and tradition. With swooping vistas and wide shots, the film's direction makes it abundantly clear how the desolate environment affects the people who live there.  It gives the viewer a greater appreciation of the nomadic lifestyle.

 While it fails to provide an accurate depiction of Temudgen's life or even his full personality, ""Mongol"" uses the legend of the greatest conqueror in the world to paint a picture of the Mongol people. Through all the battles and blood, the real story of ""Mongol"" is the never-ending struggle of the steppe, which is the most engaging.",1238976000,4,1866,4.711656441717792

I'm sure I will now be reading more.  I thought that having to read English subtitles might take some enjoyment away from the film, but it actually contributes to it.  Somehow I don't think having the actors speak English or having English dubbed over Mongolian would have worked as well.  I thought the director brought the movie to a conclusion too rapidly and I would have liked to see more of his actual solidifying of power in Mongolia rather than skipping to a great single final battle scene (I believe there were actually many battles and this one is something of a composite of them all).  I understand the purpose for this approach though.  This story is as much a love story as it is about Genghis Khan's solidifying of the Mongolian people,  It does not takeaway from the story that is being told and I can't wait for the sequel.",1236470400,3,1160,4.570048309178744

It's also ponderous in a way that you get to see and feel the magnificent scenery. It's a beautiful film, and it certainly deserved the oscar nomination for Best Foreign Film.

There is an interesting parallel in this film to Gladiator as both heroes seek to return and avenge their loss but as in gladiator, in a broader sense to restore order in governing. In the case of Genghis, a centralized Mongolian empire with a unifying code of conduct centered on Genghis' fair treatment of soldiers and for those that suffer his conquest.  Tadanobu Asano, Genghis,  is considered by some as the Japanese Johnny Depp as he is an excellent actor and has a presence that requires no verbalization. The only negative in the film is that it fast forwards from Genghis' return from prison with no one but himself to the climatic scene showing him suddenly with an established army. Showing how warriors rallied to him, would have been a plus. The movie is in subtitles but that actually adds to the film since dubbing would have ruined the film.

One part violence, one part authentic & stunning visual cinematography, and unfortunately one part boring. I don't want to be overly critical, but I found myself managing through parts of this movie that seemed sleepy, unengaging and oddly repetitive. There were other parts I really liked, finding my imagination captured, even distantly recalling scenes from ""Conan The Barbarian"" (father & son scene discussing their god).

Also, please note, I want to clarify that I'm sensitive to the notion that Asian actors might be perceived by someone like me (a caucasian American) as lacking in range of emotion and facial expressions, and perhaps that's a better alternative to over acting. But with Temudjin's grown-up ""Brother""/turned-enemy showcasing a livelier character, I was left wishing for more from Temudjin himself. Also, the transition of Temudjin from childhood to suddenly +40 year old actor was a filmmaker's faux pas.

A movie true to the tale, or in need of a script revision? I am undecided. Lastly, in some spots I felt the fight scenes were not up to the standard of story telling quality as the rest of the film, especially when he tosses the spear into a victim who suddenly springs backwards, and the computer animated blood effects seemed a little off in color. I'm probably being way too picky, but as much as I tried to embrace this movie, I found myself yawning and picking up on the little details.",1232496000,5,1445,4.962809917355372
2983233,4,B000WLYDNM,"This Russian production, the first part of a planned trilogy, was filmed in Kazakhstan with actors from a number of Asian nationalitiesm and is a very enjoyable film, in the tradition of classic epic cinema, on the early years on Genghis Khan, from the day he was born until the day he was named ruler of all the Mongols. After surviving a number of adventures and occasional setbacks, the young Temudjin positions himself as the future ruler of more than half of Eurasia (the largest empire ever, in terms of its area), Genghis Khan probably comes out as a guy that is a lot nicer than he probably was, and his wife's influence on him appears as improbable in a medieval Asian society (the early scene where as a child he chooses as his bride from a lesser clan, against the wishes of his father, is one of the movie's best). Despite this and other inaccuracies, this is a very entertaining epic. Filmed in lush photography which shows in widescreen the natural beauty of the Central Asian plain, it is wonderfully directed by Russia's Sergei Bodrov, who certainly knows how to entertain an audience in the classical tradition.",1232236800,,1128,4.702020202020202
2983234,3,B000WLYDNM,"The most pleasing part of this film, I thought, was the excellent cinematography. Kudos to Roger Stoffers and Sergei Trofimov for an outstanding job photographing this movie, making the most bleak of landscapes look stunning many times and adding some wonderful closeup shots of objects and faces.

It's not a bad story, either, although not one that will keep you riveted to the screen for the full two hours. However, I wasn't bored, either, although some of the action scenes looked too repetitive with very hokey-looking special-effects concerning blood splashing out of people in the battle scenes. It did not look real, but as if it were drawn. It's ironic in that the production values seem to be so high with a such a nicely-filmed effort, yet the action scenes are staged like a B-movie.

In a nutshell, this is the story of how ""Genghis Kahn,"" who is ""Temudjin"" throughout the movie, spent his tough early life and how he became the famous warrior. We just see how many hardships the man endured to become who he was later in life. He was never referred to as Genghis Kahn which, I learned hear, is a title more than a name. That must have come later, after he had control of all the Mongol armies, which is where the film ends.

Many times, it's a not a pleasant existence for ""Temudjin,"" who was marked man from the age of nine. We see him spend many lonely hours held captive in different places. The looks on his face are memorable. Odnyam Odsuren ad the young ""Temudjin"" and Tadanobu Asano as the adult ""Temudjin"" both had extraordinarily photographic faces.

One of the few problems I had with the movie were understanding ""the rest of the story"" as certain scenes ended abruptly leaving me (and I assume other viewers) wondering ""what happened?"" His friends, though, were fun to watch and his bride was a beautiful, kind and strong woman, as pictured in this movie. Actually, I found this just as much of a love story as a war epic, and the romance angle was far more dramatic. The devotion the lead male and female had to each other, and the faithfulness and loyalty were inspiring, to say the least.",1231977600,22,2118,4.64

The story is too fragmentary and too historically dubious/wrong to warrant any consideration (what is there comes across as bad soap opera).

The problems with the (fortunately brief) battle scenes were apparent to everyone, causing complaints to be hurled as the screen.  Since nonsensical battle scenes are so routine in movies, this reaction suggests that people expected better (higher standards) from this movie.

What would be major problems in other movies are trivial transient annoyances, and even that disappeared when I treated the biographic scenes as simply slice-of-life.  With that, those scenes became satisfying, contributing to the overall movie.  That is, treat the title of the movie as just ""Mongol"", with no mention of Genghis Khan.

I rented it from Red Box (a DVD rental machine found at U.S. supermarkets) the day before Thanksgiving and the family watched it that night.  It matched a large amount of my reading as far as land and culture were concerned.  How historically accurate the film is, I'm not sure.  No two books in English seem to be in total agreement on the life of Timojen (I've seen it spelled three or four different ways), so I won't comment on the accuracy.  The violence was rather less graphic than the PG-13 rated ""Beowulf"" or a lot of video games (I'm wondering why the ""R"" rating); the worst is that when a sword strikes, usually just out of frame, a spray of blood flies up.  Otherwise, there are sexual situations but no nudity.

Whether Genghis Khan was a good guy or a bad guy depends on which end of the sword you were on.  If you didn't take up arms against him and payed your taxes (which generally dropped under the new overlord), he pretty much left you to run things your own way.  The quality of life for the common herd seems to have improved, a saying of the time was ""A virgin could walk from one end of the empire to the other with a bag of gold on her head with complete safety.""  To the Mongolians, he is something on the same order as George Washington is to most Americans.

I liked ""Mongol"" enough to add it to my wishlist this morning.

Oh, the title of this review?  That's the title of a song written and performed by Robert Asprin (author of the ""Myth"" and ""Phule's Company"" novels) while Khan of the Dark Horde in the SCA (Society for Creative Anachronism).",1227830400,,1707,4.34384858044164
2983252,4,B000WLYDNM,"Everything about an epic is done on grand scale: It is a work of art that crosses a great expanse of land, involves several generations, and focuses on the life of a great hero and including magic and great feats. ""Mongol"" certainly meets this definition. Temudjin is not yet a hero, but by the end of the film, the viewer sees this man rise from year after year of personal defeat to becoming Mongolia's greatest leader, indeed, one of history's greatest leaders.

Add to the basic story line taken directly from the mists of history when little was recorded of this particular hero is a cast and crew of epic proportions. Sergei Bodrov, the director, is Russian; Tadanobu Asamo, who plays Temudjin, is Japanese, and Khulan Chuluun, or Borte, Temudjin's hand-picked wife, was picked by the director from the streets of a city in Mongolia. Sun Honglei, who plays Jamukha, the blood brother, is Chinese.

The story follows history accurately, as best is known. As another reviewer did, I also want to compare this film with ""Genghis Khan: To the End of the Earth and Sea,"" directed by Shinichiro Sawai, a Japanese, with Takashi Sorimachi, a Japanese actor in the title role. ""Mongol"" may have been nominated for an Academy Award for Best Foreign Film, but I tip my hat to ""Genghis Khan"" for a more detailed story and a better understanding of characters across the board: Temujin, Borte, the mother, the blood brother.

The major difference between the two films is the story of the man and wife. As young children, she picked him as husband, convincing him to pick her. Against his father's wishes, he does so. His father the Khan was in the process of arranging a marriage with an enemy clan to heal enmity. Years later once they are wed, she is stolen from him by an enemy clan. In a most unusual battle in a most unusual place, Temudjin rescues his bride, binding them forever. An incident breaches the trust issue of the two blood brothers, which is never healed (two of Jamukha's best warriors go with Temudjin. According to this film, Temudjin first starts making up Mongol rules at this point. He tells Jamukha that ""Mongols are free to choose their leader.""

When he is captured, Borte moves mountain and stream to free him. Well, not exactly, but close to it. At one point when he leaves her to go start Mongolia, he tells her he will always come back. And he does.

""Mongol"" is more a minimalist film to reflect the minimalist setting in which the story is placed--wide open vistas, huge panoramas with mountainous scenery always in the distance. Any time Temudjun appears on the open plains, he runs (if he doesn't have a horse--A Mongol always rides his horse), as if to say, one cannot get anywhere if he doesn't run.

Even though ""Genghis Khan"" is filmed in similar territory, there is a greater sense of detail--in clothing, habitat, and story. At the end the Disney figure of Mulan appears in the story as a lead soldier in Genghis's army.

2983253,5,B000WLYDNM,"Although this compelling film is about the life of the infamous Ghengis Khan, he was not given that name until after the time period covered here. His birth name was Temudjin, and the film follows him from a nine year old boy, until approximately his early thirties when he unites the numerous Mongol tribes under his banner. As one would expect, life on the Mongolian steppe in the 12th century is harsh; constant tribal warfare, being kidnapped and sold into slavery, having your bride stolen by a rival tribe, seeing your father poisoned to death; this is the environment that molded the young Temudjin into a hardened killer. The film is very violent, but it is also beautiful in its own way. Even in such a harsh atmosphere, there is room for love, loyalty, brotherhood, and honor. I can't speak for the historical accuracy, but the film does seem to paint a relatively benign picture of Temudjin, his betrayal of his blood brother Jamukha notwithstanding. Considering that the guy was essentially a mass murderer, I can definitely see how some would call this a whitewash. From a technical perspective, the film is nearly flawless; breathtaking cinematography, great acting, amazing score, fight choreography, costumes, etc. The film is put together very well. One is tempted to compare 'Mongol' to such historical epics as Braveheart and Gladiator, and in some ways it is similar, but I would say Mongol is less romantic, and more realistic, but equally good in its own way.",1227571200,,1481,4.928

Based upon the latter, the Japanese produced DVD seems more accurate, as the story lines in both while similar diverge at times.  The Japanese production is focused on Genghis Khan's [more appropriately Temujin, his name before he became Khan] mother and her voice narrates, whereas this DVD focuses on Temujin's relationship with his wife Boorte.  The defining difference is that this movie is in Mongol where the Japanese is in Japanese.  Thid DVD appropriately focuses on the ""blue Wolf"" which is Temujin's tribe, versus the japanese DVD penchant to focus on eagles or hawks.

2983257,4,B000WLYDNM,"""Mongol"" is a sweeping epic of the life of Mongolian conqueror Genghis Khan, intended as the first installment in a trilogy. This first chapter brings us the legendary childhood and youth of the great military leader, up to the point when he unites Mongolia under one rule. A spare voiceover narration takes us back to the fateful day when 9-year-old Temudjin (Odnyam Odsurem) chose his young bride and lost his father, Khan Esugei (Ba Sen). Temudjin (Asano Tadanobu) then spends nearly 20 years as a fugitive from his father's successor Targutai (Amadu Mamadakov) and his clan's traditional enemies, the Merkits. Enslaved repeatedly and always intent on reuniting with his wife Borte (Khulan Chuluun), Temudjin dreams of a more peaceful and unified Mongolia. When he finally gains his freedom it is only his equally ambitious ""blood brother"" Jamukha (Honglei Sun) who stands in his way.

The earliest source of information about Genghis Khan's youth is a poem entitled ""A Secret History of the Mongols"" that was written after his death. It may be fanciful, and there is a 10-year gap in information, in any case. But ""Mongol""'s Russian director and co-writer Sergei Bodrov has used the poem as inspiration to construct his tale of Genghis Khan's origins. Temudjin is also presented in such a way as to appeal to more modern values: a man who believes in the greatness of his country, but also generosity to his warriors, loyalty to family, and rule of law. Bodrov doesn't attempt to disguise the legendary nature of his subject. He presents Temudjin as enjoying the favor of his pan-god Tengri and coming to power through destiny as much as through perseverance.

This is an action movie with bloody battles as well as a quasi-mythic biography, and I found the CGI heavy-handed in the final battle. But ""Mongol"" is a Hollywood-style epic amazingly made for only $20 million. Filmed amid stunning landscapes in remote Mongolia, China, and Kazakhstan, it and looks like it cost three times that. This is a majestic recreation of Genghis Khan's rise to power, but it's not entirely lacking in humor. Borte is a shrewd and loyal wife who ironically tends to bear children by other men, much to the audience's amusement, if not Temudjin's. Sergei Bodrov embraces the recent trend to cast actors who must learn their lines phonetically. Asano Tadanobu is Japanese, and Honglei Sun is Chinese. Both men have an imposing presence, but the film is in Mongolian with optional English, English SDH, and Spanish subtitles. There are no bonus features on the New Line 2008 DVD.",1226620800,2,2565,4.976689976689976

Previews had seduced me with its deference to local language and an apparently, Mongol cast. Chuck in a bit of throat singing and you have a readymade recipe for western viewers. The attempt at mythologising(conference with a spirit wolf)is puerile. This is no, Atanarjuat! The battlescenes are a yawn. Think Kurasawa's marvellous samuri engagements. Even more directly of Tarkovsky's sequence of the mongol invasion during his, Andre Rubelov. And the effort of the old priest edging his way across the deserts to find the long abandoned Khan's family, is pathetic at best.

2983262,3,B000WLYDNM,"Not a film for viewers expecting lotsa violent battles. Not a film for those expecting an objective biography.

This film, by Russian writer/director Sergei Bodrov, is a ponderous biography of Temujin (spelled 'Temudgin' in the movie) before he became the great Genghis Khan.

Despite my rating, I sat almost transfixed cuz I've long been interested in Genghis Khan. Here, Bodrov and his team gave an authentic look and feel to the people and the place -- in the midst of the most breathtaking Mongolian landscapes.

The look and feel is helped by the apparent use of legitimate Mongols in the cast who are probably making their first and only appearance in a movie. The young woman playing Temujin's wife, Khulan Chuluun, does a decent job. Japanese actor Tadanobu Asano as the mature Temujin is appropriately inscrutable and looks like the iconic images of the man. Then there's the full-blooded presence of Chinese actor Honglei Sun who steals the film as Temujin's blood brother Jamulke.

But I found myself bothered by several elements.

There's large dose of revisionism here. It's as if Bodrov wants to say: Genghis Khan wasn't all that bad -- his actions can be explained by his suffering at the hands of his enemies -- and he brought a code of justice to his people (however flimsy) -- and, most important of all, he loved and was loved by his main wife. That's how the story was shaped. Of course, it's easier to sympathize with Temujin the Victim than with Genghis Khan the Savage Conquerer, which we don't get to see.

The story as presented here differs in large chunks from the versions I'm familiar with (the insightful story of Temujin's murder of his half-brother is missing -- and Temujin a prisoner of the Chinese?!). But I can't call it unfaithful to history since details of Genghis Khan's early life is pretty much lost to history except for a somewhat unreliable narrative produced by the Mongols sometime after his death (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Secret-History-of-the-Mongols/dp/0887272991/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">""Secret History of the Mongols""</a>). So writers can embellish all they want.

There's a touch of the supernatural which in a honest biography wouldn't be included. In this mixed-bag of a movie, it fits.

The clichd battle scenes are stolen from many recent bravado films set in the past. Except, the CGI is less convincing than usual (I don't think I've ever seen more fakey blood spattering).

Still I managed to be engrossed -- but you might not be. If you're expecting something over-the-top like the movie ""300"", boy, are you going to be disappointed!",1224288000,9,2643,5.127906976744186
2983263,4,B000WLYDNM,"Recent Best Foreign Oscar Film nominee `Mongol' is an impressive epic.  Telling the first installment of the life and times of Ghengis Khan, we get more than a history lesson, but a personal account of a fraternal feud for power.  Filmed with breathtaking cinematography and a sound that should have garnered a separate nomination, the movie is a sweeping drama, complete with battles that make similar `300' scenes obvious digitalized formula.

Although the film goes ahead (mostly in chronological order) with several ""One Year Later"" and other useful captions, we lose ourselves in a story of one man's struggle for survival among his Khan and the love interests that shape, bind and beget tribal rivalries and aspirations.  We follow the coming-of-age footsteps of Temujin (Tadanobu Asano) and his older rival Targutai (Amandu Mamadakov) who both strive for power and read the oracles of gods like Tengri, whom they beckon for help.

Some of the battles are Trojan-like in thrust.  Temujin will spare no one for Borte (Khulan Chuluun), his lifelong love interest.  Between his patient endurance and his love, Temujin becomes a leader who can match wills with any Mongol tribe.  Going from tribal feuds to a far-reaching dynasty, the film chronicles the real human faces that made history happen.

Before becoming Khan, he must master the elements.  Between the harshness of tundra to humiliation and hunger, the sharp edge of life known for bitterly cold winters, make or break the existence of people who rely on their armies, shelter, and horses to survive.

It cannot be emphasized enough how the lingering beauty of each frame is arresting enough to justify viewing this two hour and five minute film.  Furthermore, the haunting audio accentuating tribal customs and battle scenes resonate with mesmerizing grandeur.  Although being reserved is perhaps a cultural trait, I felt some of the scenes could have added a bit more zest to the acting, but much of the intensity is non-verbal and convincing indeed.  Writer-director, Sergei Bodrov, deserves heaping praises for building such a tightly built drama and some truly exquisitely shot scenes.

Although released last year and up for 2007's Oscar jury, both the cinema and DVD releases came about this year, so it's not too late to hold 'Mongol' as one of the truly worthy epics and one of the best movies to come out all year.

2983264,5,B000WLYDNM,"Mongol may not be the most accurate movie I've ever seen, but the restraint shown by director Sergei Bodrov is a delightful and refreshing break from the past paced, cram-all-you-can into 90 minutes cinema of recent, as well as well as from the movies immersed in CGI.
I was surprised at the direction of the film on my first viewing, but appreciated it nonetheless. The cinematography was top notch; absolutely beautiful, and it really bolstered the movie to strip the vast, stark, and beautiful landscapes of too many seemingly desirable embellishments that might be prevalent in most films. While I mentioned CGI (which I am a fan of), it was refreshing to feel like everything you were watching was actually just totally real; not an illusion, but practically palpable.
To keep it blunt, I relished in the pace, wanting more by the end (and hopefully the words of a trilogy are true, because more Mongol would be excellent!). While there were just a couple of touches that might have been totally acceptable, considering the budget and the difficulties in production, Mongol looks and feels like a mega-budget flick that steers away from the monotonies of many flicks, and I liked that. It was one of my most enjoyable films from 2008, and certainly my most appreciated.

First off, the good stuff. The filming locations are spectacular and the lead performance by Tadanobu Asano as Genghis Khan was very well done. I also thought the music fit this flick like a glove.

Now the not so good stuff. I know this is suppose to be part one of a trilogy, but they barely scratched the surface here. I did a huge paper in college on Genghis Khan and the Mongol Empire and when this film ended I was left wanting so much more. They better finish his life story in the future or this will be a wasted piece of cinema. The movie also flows at a weird pace and seems longer than two hours. The battle scenes were okay, but they didn't have the epic quality of say Braveheart or Kingdom of Heaven.

I really wanted to love the movie, but it left me cold most of the time. It's still worth a rental if you like partial history and entertainment mashed together.

I bet if they rolled all three movies together, trimmed some spots and made it around 3 and 1/2 hours long, it would have been exactly what I was looking for.

2983266,4,B000WLYDNM,"There has been many attempts to bring the life of Genghis Khan to the big screen. MONGOL (2007) is another attempt by director Sergei Bodrow, and has earned itself an academy award nomination. This film isn't a retelling of Khan's life in his height of power but rather, a biopic about his ascendance to becoming the ""Khan"" of all Mongols from such humble beginnings. The film's premise is very similar to the Japanese produced film, Genghis Khan: to the Ends of the Earth and Sea. This film is the first part of an intended trilogy about the life of Khan.

The story begins when we see a young Temudjin (Tadanobu Asano) looking for a bride. He chooses a young girl named Borte to be his wife in five years. After his father`s death, young Temudjin, is forced to flee when his father's second in command decides to take over. The film delves into the life of Temudjin through his journey that will lead him to become one of the greatest conquerors the world has ever known.

I am well aware that it is impossible to compress the life of a man as colorful as Genghis Khan in a measly two hours plus. It all depended on the filmmaker's approach on how and what needed to be put into bear in the film's running time. Just where does fact and fiction begin and end? The film certainly does feel rather a bit rushed to cover as much ground as possible that it jumps around in timeline. The film does have the usual themes of brotherhood, loyalty, family and commitment. The characters may feel a little underdeveloped and some knowledge in Khan's history would be an advantage in order to appreciate the film. It was a little curious as to some scenes seemed a little irrelevant but I do think that the filmmakers wanted to focus on Temudjin's relationship and devotion to his wife Borte.

Borte (played by Khulan Chuluun) is no mere wife to Temudjin. This character is almost as stubborn and strong-willed as her husband. She has her own story to tell, she exhibits her devotion and undying love to Temudjin in ways that would seem almost unbelievable. The phrase; ""stand by your man"" can be the film's major selling point. Borte would do anything to save and preserve her relationship to Temudjin; to the point of even selling her body. Tadanobu Asano's performance is definitely one for the record books, and the actor carries most of the film's burden along with Chuluun. Asano plays the grim, brooding conqueror very convincingly. The man is such a chameleon, he can adapt to almost any role from ""Party 7"" to ""A Taste Of Tea"" to ""Mongol"". The film portrays Khan as an inspiration and a man of destiny, which is a change from other portrayals of the Mongol conqueror (other depictions show him to be a heartless, ruthless ruler). His intimidating figure has been downplayed a little to show the humanity inside, and this could be a double-edged sword.

The film is so far from perfect. Aside from the script feeling a bit rushed, the film does have its share of obvious fictional elements. There are touches of mysticism in the film; Temudjin relationship with the Mongol God of the Sky Tengri seemed rather too heavy-handed. The scene with the Chinese monk does do a great job in setting up the film's final act but it felt too convenient, (luckily this played out well in the film's end). It would also have been extremely helpful if they fleshed out Temudjin's character as to how he developed into such a skilled general. The emphasis on the ""man of destiny"" formula did rather overstay its welcome somewhat.

Of course, with a film about Genghis Khan, you can expect some battle scenes. There are actually two major sequences of bloodshed; the raid on a Merkit camp and the final battle between Temudjin and his ""blood brother"" Jamukha (Sung Hong Ley). The two sequences are quite decent although lacking in intense spectacle as we're used to other grand epics such as ""LOTR"" and ""Braveheart"". The final result of the climactic battle also does feel rather silly and failed to be impressive. (even if its resolution was backed by historical records)

Much to the film's credit, the film's cinematography and camerawork are quite impressive. The film definitely looks quite nifty. The costumes and set designs does provide the proper atmosphere for a historical epic, despite the sometimes lackluster execution. The cast is also mostly made up of actual Mongols and the dialogue is in Mongol which does give the film a lot of ambition in regards for an epic feel. Sung Hong Ley almost steals the spotlight as Jamukha, clearly director Bodrov picked the right actor to play Temudjin's rival.

Complaints aside, ""Mongol"" is actually a good film. The film is entertaining enough despite its uneven and heavy-handed elements. The great performances and the film's pace does provide an entertaining experience. It does lack a bit in the action sequences, so folks who are looking for a bloody film may be disappointed. Just keep in mind that this is the first installment in an intended trilogy; the bloodiest and most exciting aspects of Khan's life may still be forthcoming.

2983268,4,B000WLYDNM,"This first of a planned trilogy about the feared and celebrated Mongol Chingis Khan (Genghis to Westerners), Sergei Bodrov's ""Mongol"" covers the early life of Temudjin and his rise to Chingis, ruler of all who lived in felt tents. After his father's early death and treachery by fellow tribesmen, Temudjin must survive and rise from the dust of Mongolia's vast steppes to take back what is his. Along his path and arduous youth he has a vision of uniting all the Mongol people under one law (hint, not the law of a representative democracy).

Editing is choppy and slows the film at several points in its two-hour plus length, usually between major chapters within the main tale. The film could have ended at some of the later points, but then it moves on to one more major scene.

It is in the visuals that ""Mongol"" excels. One really gets a sense of what life in twelfth-century Mongolia looked like. Scenes depicting nomadic life, the rituals of inter-tribal exchanges, fur and animal-skin clothing while riding under a baking sun drinking horsemilk and eating room-temperature mutton, are clear and vivid windows to the past. To say nothing of the sweeping views of Mongolia, Kazakhstan and Russia.

The battle scenes are Hollywood but realistic enough. The final battle between Temudjin and his best friend--and now enemy--Jamukha, is a masterful recreation of the Mongol way of horse-mounted warfare. An awe-inspiring scene is when a detachment of black-armored warriors charge their enemy, each man with two swords drawn, hunched low on his steed.

Overall Sergei Bodrov's ""Mongol"" is historically inaccurate but a visual stunner. Tadanobu Asanu and Sun Hong-Lei shine while Khulan Chuluun is positively luminous. With ""Mongol,"" the director has delivered in a very big way.",1221004800,10,1781,5.089041095890411
2983269,5,B000WLYDNM,"...but considering the minimal budget (20 million dollars American) and the genuine Mongolian (some areas so isolated that new roads had to be built to get the film crews there) locations filmed, this was a fantastic movie that was well-paced for an introduction to the life of Temudjin, who would become the Genghis Khan.

Despite the low budget, nothing in the movie looks cheaply filmed; everything looks like that of a big budget film six times more expensive, from costumes to makeup (and the craggly dirt buildup on Temudjin during his time in captivity).  I don't speak Mongolian, so I can't tell whether the accents spoken are accurately Mongolian, but for an American audience, it was great for authenticity (rather than having them speak Russian or Kazakh).

The movie excels in two particular aspects which really make this one more than just a casual ancient-world flick; the battles and the people.

While Genghis Khan is demonized in the West as a barbarous conqueror, he is seen like a hero in the East, and this movie serves to show him as both and neither, making him more than just black or white, but a fully fleshed out person with ambitions to uniting all the Mongol tribes as one beneath him.  He is utterly believable as a human being, fallible, and seemingly very much driven by his love for his wife and children, whom he nevertheless must leave constantly to fulfill his dream.

There is also Jamukha, who manages to be both a piggish, slothy figure, and a noble, loyal friend to Temudjin, when their dreams conflict and they become enemies, with a very painful and realistic portrayal of just why Jamukha would betray Temudjin, and his lack of joy in facing his opponent on a field of battle.

Then there's the battles.  As any Ancient/Medieval war movie to be expected, it is bloody.  My only annoyances in a puritanic-historian way were the suits of armor, which seemed not to be made of much metal as they would have been in Mongolian times.

Another minor thing that becomes a little excessive, and arguably rather like a recurring joke is shots of blood, showing them being spilled in thousands of thick drops rather than in fountains or bursts of liquid.

The final battle sequence manages to both utilize the Mongolian expertise in archery and cavalry and innovate with something both insanely risky and never before seen in Medieval battle depictions.  Likely seen in the trailer, as Jamukha sends the bulk of his cavalry force at Temudjin's center, he unleashes a very small number of thickly armored cavalry, armed with double curves swords, which then rush through the enemy cavalry, using the swords to slash at the enemy's sides like Scythed Chariots.

The armored cavalry is a kamikaze force, as after brutalizing the enemy cavalry, Temudjin has his archers unleash a flood of arrows on the force, killing the cavalry on both sides down to a man.

Overall a great movie, which doesn't sacrifice the macro-story of Genghis Khan and his dream of a Mongol empire for the micro-story of Temudjin's love life.  Of which I wrote virtually nothing about.",1221004800,152,3088,4.844106463878327

We do see swords swing as grimy faces spouting a confusion of Japanese and Korean accents slice their way through layers of leather and roadkill (assisted by generous CGI blood), but the budget only allows for one truly epic battle (more suggested than seen) that is the climax of a trail of brisk and kinetic skirmishes.

The landscapes, the armies, the costumes are spectacular.  Women naturally are abused, but there is a glimmer of respect starting to show.  Genghis, unlike his contemporaries, was tolerant of different religions.  As mentioned in the movie, he simply worshiped the ""the blue sky"".  Recently I spent a couple of weeks in Mongolia, slept in ghers (yurts), visited dinosaur quarries, as well as traipsed through deserts, mountains and grasslands. The Russian perspectives of the director do show through.
The USSR occupied Mongolia for a number of years and did certain objectable things.  But they also built concert halls and educated the young in the arts and technology.  And Russian scholars put together superb picture books on Mongolian history and art--with English translations.  Some object to the lead actor being Japanese.  Get real.  This is the modern world where we can draw on the talents of people from everywhere.",1218067200,,1210,5.2072538860103625

Utterly unbearable. Incredibly, the voice over is a single male voice that translates [? who knows from Mongol to Russian!] ALL the dialog - male/female, old/young, whatever.

2983274,4,B000WLYDNM,"This is a good movie about Temujin or Ghengis Khan's early years. Good character definition, plot, decent props, and stunning imagery, a very memorable epic indeed.

There is a lot of violence...which is to be expected, afterall Temujin lived a life of constant conflict. Some may think its excessive, but having seen war first hand myself in real life, trust me, its tame by comparison.

A side effect of all the violence in the movie is that it implies that Mongols are a savage race...in fact this is the opposite. Under mongolian rule, to name a few:

1. religious tolerance across the entire empire...the strength and distribution of different religions in the world are forever changed by mongol conquests
2. knowledge and skills were spread throughout the empire...anything from crafts to professions to sciences
3. Opening/reopening of major trade routes, land or sea, throughout the empire...where it wasn't possible before due to bandits or wars...linking Europe to the Orient.

This movie is of course, Sergei's interpretation. The contents as expected aren't historically accurate, and of course includes some romanticization on Sergei's part. But then again, those of you that seeks truth in a movie, or those that thinks movie are ""historical documents"" (like the clueless aliens in Galaxy Quest), should really go read up on the definition of ""entertainment"".

As far as the product is concerned, I take a star off because this DVD lacks language tracks, and its really hard to navigate. Hopefully there will be an official US version soon with multiple tracks and some other goodies.",1217203200,,1599,5.158301158301159
2983275,4,B000WLYDNM,"MONGOL:  CHINGISHAN is an epic film.  Director Sergei Bodrov captures the first installment of a trilogy of the life of one of history's most larger than life figures, the early life of Mongolian ruler Genghis Khan from 1186-1206.  From the age of ten years old up to his rise as Khan ruler, viewers will see Genghis Khan's perilous journey that involved friends and foes, but one that also centered on the god, Tengri, from whom he soughtt continuous guidance.

Bodrov portrays the human side of Temudgin (Asano Tadanobu), the name he was born with.  First, as a boy choosing his young wife, Borte (Bayetsetserg Erdenbat), and later as a ruler and family man of two children, who has countless misses with his wife (Khulan Chuluun) where he loses and regains her through unusual circumstances; also, there is the blood brother relationship between he and Jamukha (Honglei Sun), who is the warrior-like character in the film who adds a little humor in between war scenes; it is a relationship that is both brotherly and friendly despite the debacles that occur.

Indeed, the cinematography and the soundtrack make the film.  The spacious mountainous and grassy landscapes, which was shot in China and Kazakhstan is absolutely beautiful and captures the essence of the film.  MONGOL surpasses all other versions of films that have depicted the life of Genghis Khan; this version has a foreign film quality with subtitles and is superbly done.  Bodrov shows the warrior-tribal and nomadic aspect of the Mongolian people.  The film has an old Hollywood western-like quality similar to the Cowboys chasing the Indians, bow and arrows being shot, and tee-pee-like settlements are displayed; one can say that this film was made the old way without the pyrotechnics, digital effects, and chanting and thumping soundtracks that have coveted most epic films in recent times a la LORD OF THE RINGS.

Overall, MONGOL may interest the history buff or foreign film aficionado.  But be forewarned, the film shows a tremendous amount of graphic and brutal violence.  No doubt, Bodrov precisely shows the distinct portrayal of the Mongols who fought endless wars to claim the largest empire that existed in world history.",1216425600,2,2205,5.074792243767313
2983276,4,B000WLYDNM,"Mongol (Sergei Bodrov, 2007)

Despite the fact that Tadanobu Asano is a superstar across the Pacific, I never thought I'd get the chance to see an Asano movie on the big screen here in America. So before I do anything else, I have to thank-- profusely-- Picturehouse, Mongol's American distributor, and say that I hope against hope that this is the beginning of a beautiful partnership. America needs more Asano on the big screen. I am even happier to say that, while this isn't Asano's best work, the movie itself is quite strong, and there are a lot of other actors who turn in performances almost as, or just as, good as Asano's to make this into a quite enjoyable moviegoing experience.

Asano plays Temudjin (as an adult), the man who became Genghis Khan. The movie opens with us seeing Asano's face, crusted with grime, staring out through the bars of a cage. What in the world...?, you may ask. I mean, this is the guy who conquered the entire known world, right? Well, it does eventually make sense. Much of the movie is told in flashback, and much of it centers around Temudjin's relationship with his wife Borte (Khulan Chuluun), whom he first meets at the age of nine, and who sticks with him from that point despite that fact that, well, he's not really around much, since he's off conquering and warring and all that stuff. And yes, there's a good deal of that to be found here, despite that fact that this deals with the years before Temudjin became Genghis Khan; before he united them, the Mongols liked to fight amongst themselves a great deal, and Temudjin himself was often the spoils over which the wars were being fought. (Explaining why would take too long; trust me, he spends a lot of time as a prisoner for a while there.) Eventually, he makes friends with another young chap named Jamukha (played as an adult by Honglei Sun), and the two of them together start the long, tedious grind of fight, assimilate, fight, assimilate--  except that something goes horribly wrong. And now we're well into spoiler territory, so I'll stop there.

Make no mistake, Mongol is an action movie, but in saying that, I should also say that structurally, it reminds me more of epic westerns than it does conventional action pictures-- movies like The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly or Tombstone where there are relatively few moments of action punctuating a tale that's more intrigue than blood flow. Movies like this have a propensity to fall on their faces if the intrigue isn't properly paced. Mongol, which was nominated for the Best Foreign Film Academy Award (losing to Stefan Ruzowitzky-- no shame there) and which swept six Nika Awards (Russia's version of the Oscars), every category in which it was nominated, is pretty obviously one of those movies that doesn't fall on its face in this regard. Bodrov (Nomad) has quite a head for this sort of thing, it would seem.

It should also be noted that some of the history is fudged, and a great deal is oversimplified, but you have to expect that. It is a movie, after all.

Even if you're not an obsessive Tadanobu Asano fan, I strongly suggest catching this one on the big screen while you still have the time; it's the kind of cast-of-thousands epic that can't help but lose something in translation. A very, very good film. ****",1216339200,,3290,4.663793103448276
2983277,3,B000WLYDNM,"This 2007 film, nominated for a Best Foreign Film Academy Award is one of those epic bloodbaths that I find pure escapism, especially on a hot summer's day on a wide screen.  Directed by Russian director Sergei Bodrav, it was co-produced by companies in Kazakhstan and Mongolia and  is the first part of a planned three-part series.

Mongol is about the early years of the famed Genghis Khan. During his lifetime (from 1162 to 1227) his Mongol Empire eventually occupied most of Asia.  Later, his descendants went on to stretch the Mongol Empire across most of Eurasia, including all of modern China as well as substantial portions of Russia, Southern Asia, Eastern Europe and the Middle East.

The story starts when the young Genghis Khan (then called Tomudgen) was nine years old.  He and his father and a small group of warriors felt it was time for him to find a bride.  They traveled to a neighboring nomadic camp and here he met ten-year-old Botte.  In spite of the fact that his father wanted him to choose his bride from a different tribe, Tomudgen insisted on Botte.  They were betrothed and plans were made for Tomudgen to return in five years to claim her.

However, on the way back home, his father was poisoned by enemies and young Tomudgen was taken prisoner and received harsh treatment.  He escaped however and was befriended by another boy who later grew up to first be his friend and later his enemy.

The film is comprised of almost non-stop violence.  There's a huge cast of warriors for the many battle scenes.  Blood flows, and after a while it does get boring.  But there is also a fair share of torture to break the monotony.  Eventually, Botte and Tomudgen marry but she is captured by a warlord, and it takes him two years to rescue her.  They are separated again later and this time it is she who rescues him.  Most of the time this story held my interest but I would have preferred the battle scenes to be shorter.  There is just so much spurting blood I can take.

This is in no way a great film.  There is so much violence that is soon becomes meaningless.  And there are a few parts that stretch the imagination just too much, such as the time that the young Tomudgen falls though the ice in the middle of winter and miraculously survives and another time that he fights off a pack of wild dogs after years of being kept captive as a slave.  Certainly, this is not a film for everyone and I can only give it a very mild recommended.

However, I must say that I am looking forward to the sequel.",1215820800,3,2525,4.474835886214442
2983278,5,B000WLYDNM,"This incredible movie places one of history's most crucial lives against a spectacular series of landscapes. Taken only for their visual grandeur, the deserts, mountains, river valleys, and forests of western Asia and and eastern Europe create a backdrop of unexcelled beauty.

Unexcelled beauty also describes Brte (played by Khulan Chuluun), the Khan's wife. This movie is filled with beautiful people, but she stands out even among that crowd.

None of that detracts from the story of Temudjin, who history knows as Ghengis Khan. It follows him from young childhood, through his unification of all Mongolia. The story traces his many setbacks - late bloomers of every sort, here's a guy you can relate to. It also describes his wife and his marriage; suffice it to say that a man as powerful and driven as him deserves an equal. An additional thread in the story, his lifelong friend and enemy Jamukha creates a complex and shifting complement to Temudgin.

I can't vouch for it's historical accuracy; I'm sure many liberties were taken with the literal truth. That hardly matters. Ghengis Khan's rise to power deserves an epic telling on a stage as wide as all of Asia. It gets that telling in this magnificent movie.

2983279,3,B000WLYDNM,"This was an intimately ""back in time"" account of 24 years in the tempestuous life of the greatest Mongol Khan (leader) from the age nine years in 1182 to his successful ""final"" battle against his brothers.  His 1206 campaign culminated his laws of 1196 in which battles are won by the clever, not always the powerful.

As was custom of his his tribe, a nine-year old male chooses his bride (he looked like Miran as a child) and was advised to settle on a female with long legs.  A good woman is hard to find, he's told, and you need a horse more than a woman.  Later, he's told, ""you don't go to war over a woman.""  A girl taller than he, dressed in red, chose him.  Women brought a dowry like those in India, something valuable.

In 1186, he returned to the unfriendly tribe to claim his bride, and his is caught by his enemies on the way back home, before his future wife was able to consummate the pairing.  She is taken by the leader of the tribe to bear his son.  Genghis survived having a spear in his back as his mother nursed him,

The Mongols were vengeful, crude people who were afraid of thunder.  Image: Mark likes to watch the lightning as I used to do.  In 1192, after his wife was taken, he remained a prisoner and his wife is taken by the top dog and conceived a baby girl.  She gets the key to his ""cage"" and released him.  As he recouped, he looked so like Sadam Hussien with the beard and unfocused eyes.  Like hih, he had trusted the wrong people.

Since he'd been on the run, hiding outdoors, he learned to tolerate thunderstorms as he had no other place to go.  Mongols learned to run away from battle when they realize there was no other way to survive the instruments of death and the ferocious way they killed each other.  They were Barbarians dressed like Asian cowboy outlaws.  When they gathered for war, women and children were left behind to their fate.

Khan showed his men that they have the right to choose.  In the final battle of 1206, he and his men continued to fight during a thunderstorm, like Custer's last stand.  It was similar to our Civil War, brother against brother (a precursor).  He had nine lives like a cat, and united the Mongol tribes under his banner as the greatest leader of them all.",1215648000,7,2239,4.3421686746987955
2983280,1,B000WLYDNM,"The book mentioned above is the only valid, accepted translation, in historic form, of the ""Secret History of the Mongols,"" which is an accurate portrayal of the life of Chinggis Khan (name means Strong Leader).  All of Temujin's children were his own with a possible doubt being with Juchi, his first born, due to Borte being kidnapped by Merkits (another tribe).  Nonetheless, he accepted Juchi as his own son.  Juchi was the father of Batu Khan.

Another reason for low review is that the movie is not dubbed in various languages, such as ENGLISH.

I understand that the Japanese actor that played the part is an excellent actor.  However, it might have been a good idea to use Uzbeki or Khazakh actors and actresses to play the parts of Mongols because these people LOOK a lot more like the Mongols looked during the time of Temujin.  Turko-Tatar-Mongols do not look Chinese or Japanese - at least, they didn't used to.

2983281,5,B000WLYDNM,"There's a fine line between depictions of war and needless graphic violence, and thankfully, ""Mongol"" doesn't cross it. Yes, moments of this film are brutal and bloody, but they don't overcrowd the film. More than enough room is left for a compelling human drama, a story of love, commitment, and strength in twelfth-century Mongolia. The ads imply that ""Mongol"" is the story of Genghis Khan, but that isn't really the case; this is the story of Temudjin, the boy who would grow up to become Genghis Khan and conquer half the known world. It's about the person, not the myth, and that above all made this a worthwhile experience. Filmed in 2007 but just now getting an American theatrical release, Sergei Bodrov's film is sweeping in its visual and emotional beauty, with cinematography that borders on the sublime and a simple yet significant story.

It's the year 1172 at the start of the story proper, and at that point, Temudjin is just nine years old (Odnyam Odsuren). He and his father, a Khan named Esugei (Ba Sen), are traveling from the Steppes of Mongolia to a distant clan because the time has come for Temudjin to choose a wife. When they stop and meet with a different clan, Temudjin meets a ten-year-old girl named Borte (Bayertsetseg Erdenebat); they immediately take a liking to each other, so much so that, by the time he leaves, he chooses her to be his wife. The plan is for Temudjin to return in five years time, at which point the union can be made official. But things take a tragic turn--a rival clan poisons Esugei, and Temudjin and his clan are left at the mercy of a treacherous lieutenant named Targutai (Amadu Mamadakov). Now enslaved and with his father's property forcefully taken, Temudjin vows to someday avenge his father and murder Tergutai.

At around this time, a young boy named Jamukha (Amarbold Tuvshinbayar) rescues Temudjin from the desolate cold of the mountains. The two decide to become blood brothers, and right away you can sense the inherent tension in such a union; the cutting of flesh and the spilling of blood is a painful yet deep commitment to someone. Watching the boys drink bowls of milk laced with each other's blood, I sensed something more sinister was lurking on the horizon. You can tell this is true when Jamukha says that someday he'll be Khan and Temudjin will be his Second in Command. Even at a young age, Jamukha sees this union not in terms of loyalty and respect, but in terms of power. What's really interesting is that Temudjin was most likely seduced by the same lust, considering his transformation into Genghis Khan. Consider the moment he goes to the Sacred Mountain to pray to Tengri, the God of the Blue Sky: a lone gray wolf appears, symbolic not only of Tengri, but also of destructive power.

The story eventually flashes forward to the year 1186, at which point a grown Temudjin (Tadanobu Asano) escapes enslavement and reunites with Borte (Khulan Chuluun), who has been longing for his return ever since the day they met. Despite the fact that they love each other deeply, they're constantly driven apart by battle--sometimes Borte is kidnapped while at other times Temudjin is forced to leave her so that he can fight. The theme of loyalty comes into its own at this stage of the story: while Temudjin and Borte remain devoted to each other, Temudjin and Jamukha (Honglei Sun) have now divided themselves. The idea of friends becoming enemies is certainly not new, especially in stories of civil war and bloodshed. There is, however, a subtlety to their downfall that I greatly appreciated, a slow and steady unraveling that made it all the more believable. I won't delve too deeply into this, but I will say that Temudjin's belief that generous leaders gain a larger following is a wise one. This is something Jamukha doesn't seem to understand.

Some viewers might be disappointed that Temudjin doesn't actually become Genghis Khan by the end of this movie; it's not about his reign, but about his rise to power. There's a reason for this: ""Mongol"" is the first part of an epic trilogy. There's really no way of knowing how accurate this story is, seeing as Genghis Khan has generally been remembered as a ruthless warrior. ""His history was written by his enemies,"" Sergei Bodrov said when interviewed, and I have no doubt that this is true. Many elements of the screenplay seemed to come straight out of a fable: a man who comes from nothing but gains everything; a woman who often finds herself in distress; a friendship that turns into a rivalry. It's hard to imagine something so formulaic being drawn from the pages of history.

This isn't to say that ""Mongol"" ever goes in the wrong direction. You watch this movie feeling utterly captivated by the story, the characters, and the look, all of which mutually benefit each other. Even the bloodstained battle scenes have a beauty of their own, albeit not in the conventional sense; slow motion shots of swords flying and blood spurting are expertly captured, pretty much to the point of seeming graceful. But at its core, ""Mongol"" is about the characters and how they love, hate, honor, and betray one another. As bland as that sounds, it actually helps a great deal because it allows today's audiences to relate to it, to understand why certain things happen. It's a shame virtually no one in the United States got to see this film a year ago, before it nominated for Best Foreign Language Film. It would have been wonderful to praise it along with the Academy.",1214179200,4,5501,4.762054507337526

And a terrific story about an incredible human who really lived.  I think it has emotional truth and is worth seeing. Don't be misled by this reviewer.  Wait for the official U.S. release in theaters and on widescreen DVD.  It was sold out quickly and raved about at the Palm Springs International Film Festival.",1212451200,9,623,4.558558558558558
2983283,4,B000WLYDNM,"Mongul tells the story of Temudjin, the boy who grows up and eventually becomes Genghis Khan. At the age of nine, Temudjin's father(Esugei), the khan at the time, shows him how to pick a wife. After doing so, the plan is for them to get married in five years. After Esugei is poisoned however, he dies and the Mongols he was travelling with take matters into their own hands. Pillaging and doing whatever they see fit. Temudjin becomes a slave and sets out to find his brother, Jamukha, who he feels is the only one who can help him. A few years pass. Temudjin, now a man, sets off to claim his wife. He winds up going through a lot of hardships in the process, but what doesn't kill you will only make you stronger. It is said that all Mongols are afraid of thunder, but what if they don't have a place to hide? They become one of the greatest Mongols in history and greatness comes to those who take it.

This movie is shot beautifully. Every shot is filled with vibrant colors and seems to be shot in a unique way. There are quite a few first person perspectives during battle sequences that are quite stunning. Seeing the blood splatter all over the camera is always a plus, in my eyes. The battle scenes are where the film truly shines. The way they're shot make you feel like you're in the middle of it all. The perspective on a lot of the angles during not only the battle sequences, but in the movie as a whole, are impressive in their own right. The music also lends a helping hand in making this movie incredible. While some of it wasn't to my liking, the majority of it fit the film like a glove and only enhanced what was going on in the film and what the characters were going through.

The main reason I checked out this movie was because of Tadanobu Asano. I've mentioned my admiration of his acting in the past, but I had heard that this was possibly the most physical role he ever had. That peaked my interest. Well that and the fact that he was headlining the film. He definitely doesn't disappoint in this and he only seems to impress me more with each film I see that he's involved with.

Mongol may not be as action packed as the trailer leads you to believe. There are a handful of really impressive action scenes, but there's a lot of character development in this as well. The acting is top notch and as I mentioned, the visuals will have your eyes glued to the screen the entire time. I think the last twenty minutes or so make this film worth seeing alone. While it isn't action packed for two hours straight, I like to think that if you're a fan of movies like 300 then you'll probably enjoy this. This is just a bit more story driven.

2983284,4,B000WLYDNM,"Astonishingly, the name and the person of Genghis Khan in Sergei Bodrov's ""Mongol,"" a great, Shakespearean drama about this seminal figure in history, don't appear until the very end of the  two-hour epic. Instead, we see Temudjin, the man yet to become (posthumously) Khagan (emperor) of what was to be for several centuries the largest contiguous empire in history. Whether Bodrov completes the contemplated two additional chapters of the story or not, ""Mongol"" stands on its own as a masterpiece.

Contradicting the Western (and Russian) image of Genghis as the monstrous conqueror, Bodrov's work is influenced by Lev Gumilev's ""The Legend of the Black Arrow"" and is based on ""The Secret History of the Mongols,"" the 13th century Mongolian account, unknown until its re-emergence in China 700 years later. For a director, who learned in school only about the horrors of Russia's 200-year subjugation by the Mongols, taking a ""larger view"" is a remarkable act.

Unlike Omar Sharif in the 1965 Henry Levin ""Genghis Khan"" or Takashi Sorimachi in Shinichiro Sawai's disappointing 2007 ""To the Ends of the Earth and Sea,"" Tadanobu Asano in Bodrov's film  is strictly Temudjin, not the great Khan. He lived from 1162 to 1227, and ""Mongol"" covers the years between 1171 and the beginning of the unification of Mongolian tribes around the turn of the century.

In fact, the spookily powerful child Temudjin (Odnyam Odsuren) dominates the first part of the film, undergoing trials and tribulations that make the lives of Dickens' abused and imperiled children look like a picnic. From age nine into his 30s, Temudjin was orphaned, hunted, imprisoned, enslaved, and constantly threatened by extinction. Literally alone in the vast landscape (brilliantly photographed by Rogier Stoffers and Sergei Trofimov), Temudjin escapes death repeatedly, at times almost mysteriously.

""Mongol"" is huge - with endless vistas and epic crowd scenes, quite without special effects - but Bodrov keeps the setting just that, never strutting visuals for their own sake. The film is about people, and the cast is magnificent. Asano's face and eyes hold attention, and make the viewer experience simultaneous feelings of getting to know the character he plays and being held at arm's length. Bodrov and Asano escape all the many Hollywood pitfalls in making an epic - they present nothing easy, predictable, trite. The term ""Shakespearean"" is used here advisedly.

The Mongolian actors are sensational: Khulan Chuluun is luminous as Borte, Temudjin's wife; Borte's 10-year-old self, the girl who chooses Temudjin, then 9, while he thinks he is the one making the decision, is unforgettable, even if the name is hard to remember: Bayertsetseg Erdenebat.

Chinese actors are vital to the film. As Temudjin's father (poisoned by Tatars before the boy reached 10), Sai Xing Ga makes an impression few actors can achieve in such a brief appearance. Nearly overshadowing Asano is the grand thespian exercise from Sun Hong-Lei, as Temudjin's all-important blood brother Jamukha. Sun is almost too big for the big screen, perhaps a less intense performance would have served the film better.

Another problem is near the end of ""Mongol,"" with Borte's stranger-than-fiction (and actually fictional) rescue of Temudjin from a Tangut prison, years, hundreds of miles, and impossible alliances and dalliances telescoped into a few near-incongruous minutes - all to cover a 10-year-long gap in Genghis' history. Except for that, however, Bodrov's work is engrossing, spectacular, and memorable.",1211500800,7,3554,5.332142857142857
3217559,1,B000WLYDNM,"Even though it didn't get any support in Mongolia, I watched it since I'm a history movie buff ... and I hated it.

The reason why it didn't get any support in Mongolia is, because Sergei Bodrov, the director guy, said he was gonna show it in his movie that as if Genghis Khan, (it's actually Chinghis khaan, but whatever makes you guys feel comfortable), was captured by the Chinese and lived as their prisoner for 10 years. The Mongols took it as an insult on the whole Mongol nation, since almost all Mongolian academics don't think he was a prisoner. This ""prisoner-for-10-years"" part of Genghis's life is highly disputed one among the many other foreign historians. But it's not the reason that I hated the movie since I think he could've been a prisoner, because some of the most respected historians said he was.

Now I tell you why I hated the movie.

First, it shows as if Genghis's 2 older kids (Sergei Bodrov only shows 2 in the movie) were bastards that were fathered by some Chinese merchants and what nots. How much more can you insult the man and twist the story of a man who is considered as nation's father. Since I can assure you that I read lot more books on Mongols' history than Bodrov has, I can say for sure that ""I KNOW all 4 boys, who later divided the empire up after their father's death, were Genghis's!""

Then, also it didn't show much of the nomadic warriors' armors & etc. from that era, like the way it was. Typical Russian portrayal of the Mongols as if they were bunch of nothing-but-fur-wearing, half-barbarian, hairy dwarves! Talk about the revenge for being dominated for some hundred years, huh?

Just to mention few. I mean if someone's gonna make historical movie make it the way it was. Don't change it, twist it, mispresent it! Compared to this, ""300"" may look more realistic. :D Just kidding.

But seriously, Mr. Bodrov, I understand you're in entertainment business, and you love fantasizing things. But if you're reading this, I hope you think about the decisions you made already, and I hope the sequels you're gonna make for this movie come closer to the reality.

ADD: I just read Bodrov's interview on the newspaper. When he was asked about whether there is a book that was written by the Mongols on the Mongols history, he flat out said ""NO."" So what about ""the Secret History of the Mongols?"" What more can I say about this man's ""historically-accurate-fantasy-movie?""",1209859200,18,2419,4.6510538641686185

The special effects were impressive. The storms were something to remember. This was especially true about the climatic battle scene at the end of the movie. The battle scene was as good as those in ""Alexander"" just a few years ago.

3217562,4,B000WLYDNM,"An intricate examination of the life of Temudjin and his journey to becoming Genghis Khan, Sergei Bodrov's Mongol awes with gorgeous imagery, visceral battles, and powerful storytelling. As epic as the film feels though, it leaves you with the desire for more - both in the jumps in the Khan's ascent to ruler and in his reshaping of a kingdom once such power is attained.

While many have heard of the historic conquests of Genghis Khan, few probably know the story of his rise to power. In fact, no one probably knows the real story, as historical records of his early life are scarce and often conflicting. But here a grand tale is told, with enough embellishments and creative liberties to portray an honorable leader and the events that shaped his eventual quest to unite a people. Whether any of it is true or not, the hardships, betrayals, vengeance, and warring that Mongol inflicts upon Temudjin makes for entertaining storytelling. The culture and customs of the Mongolian people remain genuine, and such traditions and presentation create the authenticity required to believe in the noble leader and his perilous undertaking.

Though marketed primarily as an action epic, Mongol focuses heavily on the love story that envelopes much of Temudjin's young adulthood and the tumultuous relationships with other Khans that lead to many of the major conflicts he faces. Continually separated from each other, Temudjin and his wife Borte must alternatingly rescue each other from dire situations, and the film suggests that his wife's strong character played an important role in the Khan's decisions. Temudjin's mission to rescue Borte brings him in contact with Jamukha and through ensuing misunderstandings and backstabbing tactics they eventually become bitter enemies. Though their warring again leaves him apart from Borte, their love transcends anything that might distance them. Revenge and betrayal also play heavily into Temudjin's tortured childhood and his numerous enemies constantly seek to destroy all that he has accomplished.

While bloody warfare and intense battles are certainly a highlight, the film's strongest feature lies in exceptional acting by a diverse group of talent. Tadanobu Asano gives a solemn, commanding performance as the Khan plagued by ever more harrowing obstacles and creates a heroic character both intriguing and compelling. His unfaltering wife Borte is played with compassion and power by the understated Khulan Chuluun, and the scene-stealing Honglei Sun provides a villain with intelligence, malevolence, and bouts of crazed lunacy.

Reminiscent of the progression of Kingdom of Heaven, Mongol depicts the wondrous events that lead up to an even more monumental feat, and we're left with only our preconceived notions and a brief written epilogue that informs us that this is only the beginning. The early life of Genghis Khan that Bodrov has envisioned is fascinating enough that we want to see what happens next, and we might as rumors of a trilogy surface, but for now an epic beginning will have to suffice.

3217563,5,B000WLYDNM,"Mongol () is a movie that came out in 2007 by Sergei Bodrov depicting the early life of Genghis Khan and the beginnings of the Mongol Empire in the late 12th century on the Mongolian Steppes. The intended adventure trilogies main cast is as follows:  Tadanobu Asano, Sun Honglei, Chuluuny Khulan, and Amadu Mamadakov.
During the Year of the Black Rat Temujin is held captive by the Tangut. The movie is a narration of Temujins own life to his present circumstance. These flashbacks begin with him as a young boy, riding along with his father, in search of a bride from the Merkit Tribe. They stop at a neighboring group and Temujin tricks his father into letting him choose a future bride from that group of people. Upon returning home, Temujins father is fatally poisoned, making Temujin Khan in his stead. His own warriors begin looting his fathers camp, and only through Mongolian tradition (not killing children smaller than a cart wheel) does Temujin survive; only to be taken captive later by his fathers men later on. He escapes to reunite with his future bride only for her to be taken during a Merkit raid. Temujin goes to the new khan for help, and in a years time would be able to attack the Merkits. Him and the Khan begin to feud with the death of the Khans brother, and they both go to war. Temujin is defeated and made a slave and eventually sold to the Chinese, despite a warning from an advisor monk. He later escapes with the help of his wife to rebuild his warband in an attempt to unify Mongolia.
The historical aspect of the movie is phenomenal. It takes a lot of work to make a historically accurate yet appealing movie, and although not everything is 100% accurate, it is the little details that people will nitpick more so than the major things. We will start by the use of Horses in Mongolian society. It shows, in the movie, almost as many, if not more horses than Mongols. The Mongolian people lived off of their horses. The use of the cart in executing prisoners, the rules that the traditional mongols lived by all are historically accurate as well as the swaying of the political pendulum of the political structure in the Mongolian steppes.
I find anyone who takes a liking to history should give this a movie a go. I found it highly interesting and following a historical timeline. The movie in and of itself, to my view, found the fine line between entertainment and historic equivalency. The actors starred fairly well and as for directing and shooting I would give it 4 stars out of 5. The battle scenes got a 5 star rating in my book as feign tactics and raiding were highly used by the Mongols In that time period and beyond.",1490140800,,2662,4.545833333333333

3217565,4,B000WLYDNM,"Mongol by Sergei Bodrov was a film made in 2007 that won several awards from film festivals and academies from around the world. This was a drama set in Mongolia in the late 1100s to early 1200s. Tadanobu Asano portrayed Temujin or later known as Genghis Khan.
 The movie starts with Temujin and his father going to meet a rival tribe to marry one of their women to bring peace to the two tribes. Temujin is only a child at this point. He ends picking Borte at another village they visit and they ride off and meet their enemy who poisons Temujins father leaving a dispute of who become Khan. Targutai takes control of the tribe and promises to kill Temujin when he is old enough. Temujin escapes and ends up growing up on his own. He finds and old friend Jamukha who helps him find his wife Borte. Jamukha wants to rule as Khan and have Temujin as his second in command except Temujin doesnt want to be ruled he wants to rule. This creates a rivalry between him and Jamukha. He gets captured again and sold to Zhang Jiong who imprisons and humiliates him. Borte finds him and helps him escape where they go off and live happily for a while until Temujin decides to build his own army to fight against Jamukha.
 A great aspect of this film is the cinematography. It was beautifully shot with gorgeous landscapes and superb angles. One scene that comes to mind is when they go to attack the Merkit tribe when they were going through the rocky terrain and get ambushed by the Merkit. That and the countless scenes of the vast open plains of Mongolia that really put into perspective just how large the areas they covered were.
 Another great aspect of this film is the costume design. Although its not a huge part of the film all the costumes in this movie were well designed. The best is towards the end of the movie when Temujin is observing his army the armor hes wearing looks just like something Genghis Khan would wear during those times.
 Overall, I give this movie about an eight out of ten. It was well made and well shot however historically it may not be so accurate. No one knew the early life of Temujin before he became Genghis Khan there was just no real evidence to support this film for its historical accuracy. Making this more of a fictional epic of the early life of Temujin than a true story. However if you are interested in history and the story of Genghis Khan I would recommend this movie as it is the best representation of Mongolia during this time.",1488931200,,2474,4.430769230769231

My biggest regret is that they were not able to fulfill their original plan of making this the first installment of a trilogy!  I have seen John Wayne & Omar Sharif play the role of Genghis Khan, & after seeing the brilliant job done on the movie Red Cliff I thought the time was right to get this movie made by the peoples closet to the Mongols that are making movies!  This comes close to what I have been waiting for, the cinematography is beautiful as well as the costumes being period correct. But this movie is exactly what the title claims, the story of Timudjin's rise to gaining the title of the Khan of Khans, had they been able to produce two follow up movies they could have shown the amazing variety of cultures Genghis Khan absorbed into his great army, which would have included the heavily armored Calvary of the Sarmatians, Moasian's as well as the Avar's, Maygar's, Tar Tars & many other cultures that made up the ""Mongol Hordes of Genghis Khan"" I think the average person has no idea of how varied his great army was & that it included people with blonde hair & blue eyes or how his peoples benefited from his reign!  While Genghis Khan may not have brought technology to the peoples he conquered like Alexander the Great did, Genghis Khan sent the culture back to his people after conquering. I guess I am just tired of the incorrect history around the man that tends to teach he was a mindless barbarian who's people didn't benefit from his great achievements on the battle field. It is very refreshing to see Genghis Khan portrayed by an Asian actor & the cinematography showing the beauty of the southern Russian steppes is awesome! The battles are well done but more importance should have been placed on the use of the Bow, lasso & bolo's in the early battles of the tribes.

The movie is dramatically shot with very beautiful technique with beautiful music score. I think some here mentioned that the armor worn by the Mongols was slightly different than the ones in the set and some have questioned the exact historical lines...but for me this movie is still great as entertainment and more so as an inspiration by learning the core of a past leader who had some truly salient characteristics.

I think Chinggis Khan was a brave person with more than his share of good character and charisma. Unfortunately, the history of Mongols is mostly written by the ones who were conquered by the Mongols as their culture was far from academic so we end up with too many negative slants. However, I do believe Temujin was a great leader who cared for his people and kept promises even when inconvenient.

Having said that, it's well acted. The characters are engaging probably because they were interesting. Unfortunately, because of the speed, the film was going; there was little time for any of them to be properly developed. This I felt was unfortunate as the people presented were very different to us, and I felt it would have been fascinating to get to know them better.

The filming was outstanding. The scenes they obviously spent a lot effort to make them authentic, it was an excellent job. So one point here unless you have a big scene, you are going to miss much.

3217612,5,B000WLYDNM,"This is a movie on the scale of what Hollywood was once capable of. It isn't and doesn't have to be historically perfect in every detail of accuracy. There are so many movies based loosely on historical legend that succeed in weaving history with story-telling why single this one out as not being ""historically accurate"". Will the first person who saw the movie who actually witnessed life in the 12th century please step forward and tell us all exactly what went on every day in the life of Genghis Khan? Yet some reviews lean toward criticizing the film's accuracy based on other movies they have seen or books they have read. Bottom line ... this is a movie, not a history book.

I am no more qualified than anyone to  discuss how accurately this movie portrays the life story of Genghis Khan, though as a descendent of Mongols and having traveled extensively in the footsteps of Tem&uuml;jin by way of foot, camel and jeep I can say that much of what I saw such as the sharing of milk, the blessing over it, the drunken parties, the relationships of the Mongolians with their families and with each other, and the background scenery of much of this movie is dead-on accurate. I've been there ... the movie, in a sometimes idealized way, often shows us exactly what Tem&uuml;jin himself saw 900 years ago.

Taken as a movie, not a history book, the cinematography is excellent. The music is eerily accurate as a popularized version of exactly what camel herders and local entertainers performed for me and have performed for others for centuries. The costumes were romanticized, of course, in most cases. There were times it was hard to focus that we are talking about the 12th century and the movie's costuming simply jumped all over time and space.

I am extremely happy that the dialogue of the Mongolian actors was in their native dialect (while the Chinese actors spoke Mandarin and some of the other characters spoke in a Turkic dialect). With my limited knowledge of the Mongolian language I recognized what the people I lived with in Mongolia spoke to me. The sub-titles were well done. To dub the dialogue into the local language of the movie's viewer would have utterly destroyed the movie.

I'm not sure what I expected from this movie before seeing it, maybe a preachy documentary or something featuring Tom Cruise and Kim Kardashian in the lead roles to sell at the box office, unfortunately if Hollywood made this movie that may actually have been the case. It was easy to ease into the more casual and less hammy acting of the actors who were chosen. There were no miscasts, although Honglei Sun as Jamukha might be just a little over the top with his backaches and neckaches.

Watch the movie with an open and relaxed mind and tune in on the many subtleties used to help us understand the conditions and circumstances that formed one of the most memorable people in all of history. Take time to dissect the battle scenes to see how Tem&uuml;jin progressed from being the underdog to becoming Genghis Khan, perhaps the most brilliant military strategians of all time. And do read the subtitles, there aren't that many of them.

3217616,4,B000WLYDNM,"Some reviewers have referred to the fact that MONGOL: THE RISE OF GENGHIS KHAN is a low-budget epic, as compared to its Hollywood equivalents.  What makes this film so outstanding is its un-likeness to the Hollywood product; rather than focusing on special effects, Sergey Bodrov's film centers on Temudjin (Tadanobu Asano) and the way in which he develops the kind of iron will that transforms him into a great leader.  Although repeatedly captured by his enemies, including arch-bad guy Jamukha (Honglei Sun), he always finds a way out to return to his wife Borte (Khulan Chuluun), with a combination of brute force and low cunning.  Structurally speaking, MONGOL: THE RISE OF GENGHIS KHAN is structured around a series of conflicts between various factions in twelfth century Mongolia, each vying for power.  The prestige attached to being called ""Khan"" is so great that it attracts rival leader Targutai (Amadu Mamadakov) - although he repeatedly describes Temudjin as his brother, we know that this is a term of convenience.  Bodrov's film contains some stunning landscape shots: filmed in the wilds of Mongolia, as well as Kazakhstan, this is a visual feast, making us aware of how insignificant human beings can be when set against the world they inhabit.  It is a tribute to Asano's performance as Temudjin that he manages to transcend this feeling and come across as a genuine hero, one who could quite literally conquer the landscape.  The battle-sequences are brilliantly filmed, as are the scenes showing the Mongols galloping across the terrain on horseback: Bodrov's tracking shots are some of the best I have seen in a modern epic.  MONGOL: THE RISE OF GENGHIS KHAN is rip-roaring entertainment on the one level, but also demonstrates an alternative cinematic treatment of the epic genre.",1399420800,,1803,5.108843537414966

3217624,4,B000WLYDNM,"Mongol is in Mongolian with English subtitles. It is an amazing story of the childhood of Genghis Khan, back when he was known as Temudgin.

Temudgin had a terribly difficult life. When he was about nine-years-old, he selected his bride. His father was the 'khan' of his clan - the leader. One day the father was poisoned because he accepted a drink from the enemy.

After that, Temudgin's life was at risk, because he was to take over the position as the `khan' when he grew up. Thus, he would want revenge on the clan who killed his father, and so that clan wanted to kill him first.

It was a rule among the Mongols not to kill women or children, so the enemy clan waited until Temudgin grew older.

The costumes, the acting, the locations, and the script are all amazing. The slow pace of the personal, intimate scenes juxtaposed against the wild animalistic fighting seemed very real. We see these humans as desperate and then gentle.

The friendship and the love relationship reveal the human longing for closeness. Temudgin learns that his own breaks in integrity  have created the self-same chaos that his people now suffer. This motivates our new khan to create laws.

This haunting story with the Mongolian language spoken, brings Mongolian history to us. The fight scenes are too graphic for this viewer, despite the fact that we know it is just makeup. Some of us are not blood-and-guts people, but the film is definitely worth our time.

3217649,5,B000WLYDNM,"As a boy, I had somewhat of a fascination with Genghis Khan (the Great King) and even drew a picture of him titled, naturally, ""Temujin,"" his actual name. I don't know what it was that attracted me; likely his cool-sounding title and world-conquering exploits.  With the exception of Iron Maiden's great instrumental, ""Genghis Khan,"" that ended my flirtation with this historical figure. That is, until I saw the Russian-made ""Mongol: The Rise of Genghis Khan"" (2007) yesterday.

As the title would suggest, the film explores Temujin's origins and what led to him becoming the great king of the Mongols and world-terrorizer. Despite being a foreign film with subtitles the movie successfully pulled me into its world and characters. The Mongols on the vast Asian steppes lived similar to American plains Indians. I've seen numerous photos of Mongols living on the steppes with their yurts, etc. over the years, but I could never relate to them as people. Just as, say, ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dances-with-Wolves-Full-Screen-Theatrical-Edition/dp/B0001GF2H4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dances with Wolves (Full Screen Theatrical Edition)</a>"" made American Natives come alive to the viewer so this film does with Mongols.

""Mongol"" eschews the American ""blockbuster"" syndrome and simply tells the story of Temujin from his early boyhood to his crowning as the great Khan. Although there's a steady amount of action throughout, there are a lot of quiet lulls with Temujin calmly waiting-out his various imprisonments and seeking Tengri, the god of the blue skies. Regardless, I found myself drawn into the characters and simple story.

I liked the fact that a monk was able to ""see"" Temujin's greatness and future world-conquering potential even though he was only a lowly slave, which others understandably couldn't see. I also liked the low-key commentary on people choosing their leaders and forsaking the less worthy, and the resulting strife, as well as the focus on Temujin's many quiet times in the wilderness seeking the Divine for wisdom and power to walk in his greatness and fulfill his dream, not that I'm suggesting Genghis Khan was God-ordained, of course. The lead actors are all great, especially Honglei Sun as Jamukha, Temujin's ""brother"" and then greatest enemy in Mongolia. Despite all this, people who require constant roll-your-eyes action and explosions will likely find ""Mongol"" boring.

Speaking of ""constant roll-your-eyes action,"" this was the very thing that ruined the recent ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Conan-the-Barbarian/dp/B004EPYZT4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Conan the Barbarian</a>"" with Jason Momoa, who was excellent in the role. That film needed more downtime, realism and depth, similar to the original 1982 version (not that that version didn't have its share of cartoony-ness), the filmmakers instead pushed for overkill action and minimal weight. The result? A mediocre Conan flick that looked great but was ultimately too shallow and goofy, in the ""action-packed blockbuster"" sense. Interestingly, ""Mongol"" reminded me of John Milius' version of ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Conan-the-Barbarian/dp/0783241895/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Conan the Barbarian</a>"" and of Robert E. Howard's Conan in general, albeit without the sorcery. I believe if the 2011 remake of ""Conan"" shot for the realism and seriousness of ""Mongol,"" as REH himself portrayed the character and the Hyborian Age, it would have been a more worthy Conan film. It goes without saying, if you like REH and Conan you'll probably appreciate ""Mongol.""

The locations are gorgeous, shot on the remote and godly landscapes of Inner Mongolia, China, and Kazakhstan.

The soundtrack is simple but effective, often just an eerie-sounding violin/cello. I found it interesting that when the credits hit a great epic metal riff kicked in for a few bars before morphing into the expected Eastern-styled credits soundtrack. It was a pleasant surprise.

If you're looking for a compelling political drama of how one man came to lead thousands -- you won't find it here.  If you're looking for a penetrating psychological profile of how a boy grows into a man who will create an empire -- you won't find it here.  The film is, over all, more a romance than anything, and even there it kind of fails to bring out the chemistry and personality of its leading couple.  Temudjin is given little serious motivation for his pursuit of his love Borte, and Borte herself is portrayed as little more than an obedient pet following in Temudjin's wake.  The film obviously suggests that their mutual motivation is ""True Love,"" but we really see very little to actually give us any sense of this.  Politically or historically, the film is very lacking.  There's a running feud throughout the film between Temudjin and his father's rival, which later comes to involve Temudjin's ""blood-brother.""  But even this personal vendetta lacks real meat in its portrayal.  The film is very disjointed throughout, with a lot of fade-outs that simply serve to jump to new scenes without explaining how the previous scene concluded.  The most egregious example of this is when Temudjin, newly freed from slavery, vows to unite the Mongolian tribes.  Fade to black...and jump four years into the future, and somehow out of nowhere Temudjin has an army at his back and is about to conclude his conquest of the Steppe tribes.  Nowhere does the film really explain how Temudjin rises to power.  As an action adventure it completely fails (there are really only two relatively short battle sequences).  As a historical biopic, the film falls short.  I will give a hand to some gorgeous scenery, but even the cinematography is a little lackluster aside from a few nicely coreographed shots.

It has absolutely no intellectual content and precious little plausibility, unless you happen to believe in soothsayers and Gods of Lightning. It's one of those ""River Platte"" films, three miles wide and three inches deep. Most of the rave reviews focus on the cinematography, especially of the Mongolian landscape. Even the visual beauty of the film is nothing worth five stars; it doesn't compare with any number of Japanese, Swedish, Italian, or even American films, the old classic ""Shane"" for instance, which was shot in the Grand Tetons region. The camera work is grand but unimaginative. For a contrast, I'd suggest the films of another Russian director: Sergei Paradjanov! His budgets were infinitesimal in comparison to ""Mongol"" but his cinematography was a hundred times more creative.

The acting is remarkably supple and convincing, given the banality of the script. Let me reassure you that Japanese actor Asano Tabanobu is way more plausible as Genghis Khan than American actor John Wayne ever was. But you'll have to indulge in some ""willing suspension"" of cultural incredulity in order to relish the mythic impassivity and imperturbality of the Mongols as portrayed here.

The battle scenes are comic book stuff. They're about as realistic as the semi-animated film ""300"" portraying the Battle of Thermopylae. It's hard to imagine that anybody really enjoys such silly showers of simulated gore. In the old-time cowboy-and-cattle-rustler films, a bullet would kill a man instantly, without a speck of blood or a twitch on the ground; this film, which is just an ethnographic ""western"" at heart, reduces death to the opposite absurdity. Men get slashed in half, despite their armor, and fake blood erupts in fountains. And there's not a flicker of humor or wit -- unless it's concealed in the Mongolian script but lost in subtitle translation.

""Mongol"" is a collection of scenic vignettes depicting what life might have been like at different early stages in Khan's life, wrapped loosely around a rather sparse storyline involving sibling rivalry, romance and bullying. The element that I anticipated eagerly throughout most of the film and which I interpreted as being the reward at the climax - a demonstration of the charisma and human dynamics that would motivate large numbers of people to follow this man - was neglected entirely! I think this is why some reviewers wish for a sequel. The movie ends at the dawn of his military career.

Gorgeous landscape.  Local cast.
Eastern viewpoint of GK and his life story, totally opposite of what we study.
Had a very authentic feel and look although it was a little long winded as expected for the genre.
Took awhile to get to the meat of his life, a lot time spent on his fall from grace, peasant w/no horse, running ALOT.

3217659,2,B000WLYDNM,"First off, let me say that Genghis Khan's life is a mystery.  We have lots of facts, but which piece of information is real and which was made up?  Can you trust a source that hates him?  Can you trust a source that loves him?  Can you trust a source that never knew him?
So making a movie about him that is going to be 100% realistic is not going to happen.
BUT...we do know a lot about the Mongols - how they lived, fought, and governed.  Some of that is in here.
The interaction between the Chinese and the Mongols for example, is in here.  The Khan's kidnapping, which shows him becoming tough and learning to survive, is in here.
Yet the grand battle, with archers in the ground and riders with two swords, what was that?  I wanted to see the development of Mongol tactics, the same tactics that would sweep across Asia, into the Middle East and Europe.  What we got was a Hollywood battle - and I mean that in a bad way.

3217668,5,B000WLYDNM,"This masterpiece does justice to how Mongolian world supremacy began - it started with a person who had to overcome the hugest climatic, linguistic, family, and geopolitic obstacles.  He was a survivor against all odds, not only because he was so lucky, but of supernatural-level perseverance, wisdom, and generosity.  He turned the suffering into positive energy, and he went back to save his people.

This movie also does a nice fictional / creationist treatment of why Mongolian world dominance was inevitable: people who can live in such harsh climates and eke out a nomadic living and not being tied to the land and be fiercely in love with their culture and ways - why of course they were hyper adaptable to any hardships, and could outdo and outlast everyone else.

I was surprised after I so enjoyed the movie to learn that it was Russian-financed and directed.  I wasn't expecting any Russians to be so interested in the Mongolian perspective.  Some big hearted, big picture types they must be.  And how small hearted I was to make such prejudiced presumptions.  I learned in this way as well.

There are few movies no matter how masterful that I would want to watch twice.  This one, I would watch again and again.  Great story, and visually so harsh and beautiful.",1295654400,,1275,4.802752293577981

3217670,4,B000WLYDNM,"Having just read a bio of Genghis Khan and the Empire his sons expanded and then squandered by in-fighting, I found this film utterly riveting and reasonably accurate historically.  The acting is also superb, with an entirely non-caucasian cast, in the Mongol language rather than dubbed.  It is a kind of character study of a political and military genius, with the personal choices he makes that reinforce his leadership, in particular the tough wife, Borte.

The film version shoehorns his life into a coherent narrative.  Born into a small unit of families, of which his father was a leader, Genghis (then ""Temeugen"") was comfortable and learned the ways of the Steppe.  This was a time of warring petty tribes that stole brides and pillaged the goods of others via constant attacks.  They had some customs, but not many.  Everything changed when his father was poisoned:  his family was ruined by a turncoat, he was enslaved after becoming a blood brother with a leader who would become his rival, and he rose to lead his own band.  Eventually, after many reversals and horrible ordeals, coupled to his military prowess, he creates a series of laws that enable him to become the Khan of all Mongols, eliminating all enemies and ending the incessant warfare, in the process creating one of the greatest fighting forces of all time.

This is a simplified version that is fairly accurate.  He was enslaved as a child, did find a great life partner in his wife, and was an inspired leader of men.  But the ""narrative"" sets up a bunch of set pieces that over-simplify things or add details that can never be known.  While he did have a blood brother he later unseated because only one of them could be leader, he did not seek personal vengeance against the many stereotypical enemies or rival kingdoms that the film highlights.  His wife also did not rescue him from a second captivity.  Nor did he preserve those who were decent to him during the many periods of struggle as a slave.  But that is the stuff of good fiction, an indulgence I can accept.

The film does romanticize him a bit too much, which is my only criticism.  The actor makes him extremely sympathetic:  you understand what he suffered and rejoice in the justice he created in his system of laws.  What you don't see is that his army continued to pillage and inflict suffering on its enemies with a brutality that was organized into larger military units.  Essentially, he turned the energies of the small tribes outward, with the same ruthless methods.

I would recommend this film as a wonderful evocation of history, but would suggest that viewers look beyond the narrative.",1288310400,,2646,4.769230769230769
3217671,2,B000WLYDNM,"The movie begins well. It sticks pretty closely to the historical sources in depicting the early life of Temujin. Tadanobu Asano, as the mature Temujin, is a bit stolid but otherwise good. Honglei Sun's Jamukha is striking--assertive, appealing, and somewhat erratic, he is believable as the sometime close friend and blood brother who becomes a rival and mortal enemy. Khulan Chuluun (a real Mongol; they are scarce in the film) is appealing and lovely. So far so good.

Sadly, Bodrov and Aliyev were not content with the real history, and simply abandoned it for fiction half way through the film. The last thirty or forty-five minutes are either wholly unhistorical yak dung or at best wild misrepresentations of actual events, on a level with that old Hollywood turkey starring John Wayne.

In addition, there are a number of needless inaccuracies of visual detail that are like gnats buzzing around the head of the informed viewer. Bows are drawn in European style (the Kazakhs involved in the production could have demonstrated the correct draw); the swords are much too curved and look ridiculous as a result; the Merkits were probably not the Siberian forest tribe shown on the screen; &c. &c. Little annoyances, but they add up.

If you know a bit about steppe history, or if you want to learn a bit about it, watch the first hour and then leave the theater or stop the disk.",1287446400,,1384,4.831223628691983
3217672,5,B000WLYDNM,"If you want to hear a story from as close to the horse's mouth as possible, this film is it. A multi-national production, yet the heart and soul, as well as the dialog is purely Mongolian. Supposedly the first film of a planned trilogy, this is the only film of that series yet to be produced. This may be a good thing, because I do not see the possibility of any sequel surpassing this masterpiece in scope, drama or gravity. The film covers the origins of Temguin, the future Genghis Khan and it is very faithful to the Mongolian views of the great man. You will find yourself cheering for the man that most of the world has deemed ""The scourge of the world"", but to the Mongolian people he was a visionary with almost a god-like status. This film will make you understand and respect the Mongolian perspective. Well acted and with excellent cinematography, the only potential flaw may be the limited use of CGI and the violence (which can be overwhelming for the more delicate of viewers). But given the subject matter, the moments of extreme violence are fairly accurate for a brutal age. The CGI is used minimally and is never over the top, nor used at inappropriate moments . As an historian of Russia and Central Asia, I would recommend this wonderful film to anyone with even a passing interest in Time Magazine's ""Man of the Second Millennium"".

3217674,2,B000WLYDNM,"This film was somehow nominated for Best Foreign Film at the 2007 Academy Awards, and one has to believe it's only because of its subject matter and the fact of its provenance, because its artistic quality is simply not high. In many ways, it's a B film masquerading as an A film, and one need merely to compare it to earlier epics like Ben-Hur, Spartacus, and El Cid, to see where this film went wrong, in terms of acting, writing, and the eschewing of realism for video game level special effects (the final battle scene between Jamukha's and Temjin's forces, replete with darkening skies) is especially silly.

  The DVD, put out by New Line Cinema, is utterly bare bones. Yet, this is the sort of DVD that screams for needing a commentary and/or a making of featurette, and a documentary on the historical Genghis Khan. Not that such could have justified the film's failings, but they could have at least shed light onto why certain things in the film were portrayed a certain way. While a film historian's commentary would be nice, even more elucidating would have been a scholar of the Mongol Empire and/or the Ancient Orient to discuss the schism between the film's reality and that history bears. As it is, Mongol: The Rise Of Genghis Khan, is a mess of a film- intriguing enough in its pros and historical import, to get a mild recommendation for viewing, but too Hollywood in its screenplay deficiencies and logic to recommend with much fervor. Yes, it is a true epic, in all the ways one might compare it to those of David Lean, save for one: quality. And it is in that lack that this essay's opening posit bears fruit.

3217676,2,B000WLYDNM,"I go into every movie I watch with an open mind. Some movies you sit down not knowing what to expect and find yourself being amazed. Some movies you sit down and watch knowing what you should expect but only find yourself being disappointed. That is exactly the way I felt about this film.

The acting was fine but the story... it just doesn't seem to have been presented properly in this film. There so much they skip over and there's parts that they lengthen that really should have been over and done with in the first part of the film. Instead of a story about Genghis khan a fierce Mongolian leader I get a story about a man and his love for his wife and that's really all this movie really is.

Genghis and his wife get separated some events happen and they unite again they get separated again some events happen they get united again end movie. The entire length of the film Genghis is either locked up or running away. The only impression that you get is that he is weak and a coward and can't get anything done without someone helping him. Does that depict the picture of one of histories greatest warlords?

Watching this film you get no sense of what made Genghis decide to unite Mongolians or take on rivaling nations. Most documentaries try to create a story that at least give you an idea of what makes the mind of a great man tick...this movie doesn't. I was more or less curious why he chose to stay with such a promiscuous wife who had children that were fathered by other men at the time she was married to Genghis. Why didn't she fight back? If she was raped she never showed it. The only idea the movie gives you in regards to her promiscuity is that she doesn't know how to keep her legs closed...and Genghis is a man who is head over heels in love with a woman that he barely knows (but other men know her very well).

It may sound like I'm pulling away from the movie but that is what this film is mostly about. The story of Ghengis's childhood, and his rise to power only seem like a minor subplot. It felt like everything that the movie should be showing you they skipped over and  replaced with a title screen explaining a date and what happened and then going back into the mundane story.

The highlights of the film are when Genghis clashes against another Khan whom he befriended once. This is what scored big on the movie with me as this story line is great... But there's too little of it. Things like this should be what the movie is about... not 20 minutes total of it.

I rated this movie 2 stars because honestly the 2 hours I spent watching this should have been condensed down to half an hour. The story about a leader and his wife might be great for a movie about Mary Antoinette. But this is a movie about Genghis Khan. His wife didn't unite Mongolia he did and that's what this movie should be focusing on. What horrors did Genghis see and experience that made him want to unite his people so much. What made him want to wage war against other nations?  That is what this movie should had been about.

Take the 10 Commandments for example. You see Moses care free, then you see Moses realize the cruelty around him, then you watch him change, then you watch him want to do something about it, then you watch him find a way to do something about it, then you see him return with his solution, then you see him put this to action,then you see why the people choose to follow him, and how he became such a great leader. It's that simple!

After watching this film I know nothing more about Genghis Khan than I did before it. The only impression I have of him now is that his wife wasn't very faithful.
The reason I give this movie 2 stars is because you don't turn a movie that should be about a Warlord into a love story. This movie could have and should have been done better. I don't know what the director was going for... but this... this isn't acceptable.  I only hope that one day someone can make the Genghis Khan movie that deserves to be watched.

3217680,4,B000WLYDNM,"This movie is a good one with probably alot of historial license taking place. However the main part of this movie to me is the love story between Gengis and borte.  He goes through alot and is the best of men toward her, he raises the children she has after she is raped and must sleep with other men to help free him.
That's a great story in any culture. I hope that much of the khans life is true because the rest is one of the most bloody and terrible in history. Khan is still in the top five mass killers in history! Chairman Mao is number one but he had a modern machinery of death at his disposal. (stalin, hitler, lenin, fill out the top five with khan) Mao undoubtably looked up to Khan to.  This blu ray looks gorgeous and the story is engaging. If Gengis career had ended with him unifying his savage people (this story is matched in all civilizations and races  as warlike tribal people come under a more central authority) then he'd be remembered by the world as a great leader only and not a cruel mass slaughterer of whole civilizations. alexander the great also had bad moments too though.  but in history Khan was  The worst since attila the hun in fact.  However unlike the Huns who left only ruins his decendants were the cupholders of civilization and unification. And khan didn't destroy unless you resisted him, the huns did it for plunder only with no idea of creating a empire. That places khan as more than just a mass exterminator like attila.
  This movie is fast paced enough but like all movies you most wonder how much of this happened beyond the basic facts but who cares when you get a decent story like this.  The movie is subtitled and the print looks fine. It's a good flick and blu ray is only way  to go. The two main lead actors do a great job here and the actress playing borta gives a  performance that is a really good study in sacrifice for love.

3217687,4,B000WLYDNM,"This is actually the most ""accurate"" docudrama on Genghis Khan, if you keep two considerations in mind: 1) it views Temujin (future Chinghis Khan) from a Mongol perspective, and therefore treats him as a heroic statebuilder, and 2) the narrative is based on the Secret History of the Mongols (c. 1240), which mixes dynastic history with a little Mongol mythology (the protection by the white wolf, the storm which gives Temujin victory over Jamuga). Bodrov takes only a few liberties with the Secret History narrative, mostly in leaving out the character of Toghril Khan in order to make the story line easier to follow; some events involving Toghril are attributed to Jamuga. Temujin's captivity in the Tanggut Kingdom is speculation, but several historians have followed this same speculation in trying to fill in some missing years in Temujin's history.

This is a far more convincing and dramatically compelling treatment of Chinghis Khan's life than the Hollywood versions starring John Wayne and Omar Sharif.

One of the great strengths of this film is its sense of place. It really does convey the vastness and beauty of the steppe. But it also recognizes that not all the ""Mongolian"" tribes were steppe-dwellers practicing pastoral nomadism.

It also makes far more sense in explaining the origins of the Mongol Empire. The Empire was not a grand vision pursued by Chinghis Khan from his youth: it was an accident, an improvisation emerging from his battle just to stay alive, maintain the loyalty of his retinue, and reclaim his position in his tribe.",1267488000,,1560,5.062256809338521

3217689,5,B000WLYDNM,"I want to begin by mentioning that this is a movie and not a documentary. Therefore, I am reviewing it as entertainment and not an attempt at historical re-creation. I mention this because many people have commented about historical errors in the movie which I find ridiculous because even the foremost expert on Genghis Khan doesn't know precisely how his life unfolded and, once again, this is not a documentary. So, we will move past that altogether.

I like movies such as Braveheart, Gladiator, Troy, and Kingdom of Heaven. All big-time movies with big-time actors and budgets. I feel that Mongol fits well into the genre and I enjoyed it as much as any of the aforementioned movies. To echo what others have said, it is as well shot, has as equally impressive costuming, and production values as any of the movies mentioned earlier.

be taken seriously if you've read any biography of

At times the films gets downright silly, plotwise but it
is ravishingly photographed with exotic grandeur.

Probably the film had money problems and took a long

difficult to follow.  Since the film is subtitled it's
a little tough for me to say whether the dialog is
good or not, but from a narrative continuity point

Though Genghis Khan has been an archetype of the conqueror on horseback since his armies overran Asia and parts of Europe 800 years ago, most people know nothing about him other than, maybe, he was ""Mongolian"" and has scary pictures in various histories. This film is based on several historical works that try to tease out a personal history, based on Mongol oral traditions. It is focused almost entirely on the early life of Temujin (Genghis Khan's real name), and you frequently wish the movie was longer and filled in more gaps. Beautifully filmed, it is also a great introduction to the beauties of Mongolia, which should come as a shock to those who think ""Mongolia"" means ""desolate waste.""",1259712000,,887,4.803921568627451

The final battle is a letdown actually (won't give away the details but suffice to say that it doesn't live up to the buildup).

3217705,5,B000WLYDNM,"Despite scenes of gross, grisly gouging (heads smashed, sharpened objects poked into and through people, and almost as much digital blood flying as in ""300""), this is actually a rather charming and affecting film. Really. The focus is on the people and their relationships, with the battles secondary. (But don't worry -- if you like seeing humans converted to hamburger, you won't be disappointed.)

The producers know what sells -- the actor playing Temudgin is Jeff-Bridges cute, and the actress playing Borte (his bride) is beautiful, without looking as if she just steppe-d (ar, ar) off the runway. But this is no Hollywood biopic (qv, ""The Conqueror""). Both the acting and direction are understated, and there are only a few Scenes Of Great Portent. Some questions are left unanswered -- such as how the wolf releases Temudgin's slave shackles and how he repeatedly escapes from his captors. But the story of Ghengis Khan is as much legend as fact, so it's not /that/ important. The film ends as Temudgin is made khan of all the Mongols, leaving room for a sequel. (""The Wrath of Khan""?)

The cinematography is outstanding, with lots of wide shots of magnificent landscapes, dotted with tiny human figures. However, in some scenes the highlights are flat and burned out. This seemed more like a technical or transfer problem, than a deliberate aesthetic choice by the director. It detracts only slightly.

This Blu-ray disk is so inexpensive, it's virtually an impulse purchase. Give in.",1257120000,,1493,5.036437246963563
3217706,5,B000WLYDNM,"The scenery is spectacular.  We are not likely to get on a tour bus to visit these remote places, so the Blu-ray is next best for the foreseeable future.  At 9.99 for the ""Mongol"" Blu-ray at the date of this review, and 14.99 for the dvd, there is something weird about the pricing.

This movie looks fictional to a large degree.  I can believe the dates.  Even with a modern almanac, the animal cycles allows one to extrapolate backwards to the exact year.  No need for the ""circa"" when the exact year can be calculated accurately.

1196 AD: the year of the politically correct Blu-ray.  The Khan's wife chooses the man and saves him from death more than a couple of times.  Without his wife running the show, Genghis Khan is just another dead mongol.

Like ""Alexander"", this movie is short on the tactics of battle.  It does not explain clearly how an numerically inferior force repeatedly defeated a superior force.  I remain curious.  ""300"", ""Midway"" and ""Patton"" clearly illustrate the tactics used.

There are sufficient battle scenes, but not enough for me.  In ""Braveheart"", Mel Gibson's captain remarked: we did not get dressed up for nothing.  In ""Mongol"", the hordes are dressed up and assembled.  Battle scenes could have been extended and made more dramatic.  What a waste of good cavalry.

""Nomad: the warrior"" (Jay Hernandez) would be an apt companion to ""Mongol"" when released on BD.  ""Nomad"" is produced with the full co-operation of the Khazakhstan government.  ""Nomad"" goes a long way to restore our respect for Khazak culture after ""Borat"" defamed Khazakhstan.  It goes to show that a movie can do a lot more for public perception than 3 page advertisements in the New York Times taken out by the Khazak government.  ""Mongol"" likewise changed perception of Genghis Khan.  ""Nomad"" is more entertaining than the pseudo-historical ""Mongol"", but ""Mongol"" was there first on Blu-ray.

All things considered, ""Mongol"" is a worthwhile addition to a BD collection.  Most of it is re-watchable.  Cinematography was outstanding.  Breathtaking and fabulous scenery, but I still would not like to be in those remote areas in a tour bus.  The locations are still in pristine medieval or 10,000 B.C. condition.

But more than just spectacular battle scenes, the movie shows a lot of the what life was like for Mongols and gives emotional nuance to all the main characters. Kahn's wife is beautiful and speaks little but conveys quite a lot.

A scene I particularly like is when Kahn and his wife are riding horseback together. They exchange coy looks until she asks, ""Don't you want to touch me?""

3217709,5,B000WLYDNM,"In MONGOL, director Sergei Bobrov presents more than a movie biography of one of the world's most ruthless conquerors.  MONGOL is the first in a proposed trilogy that will span the life and times of the man history calls Genghis Khan. Many reviewers have commented on what they saw as excessive gore reducing the dramatic thrust purporting to show the slow growth of one man with a Vision to unite all Mongols.  There is plenty of bloodletting and extended battle scenes but such glimpses into history and the Mongol psyche are needed to show how that one man could make the transition from the humblest of slaves to the Great Khan of all Mongols.  MONGOL is a traditional film of the life of a ruler that director Bobrov sees more as George Washington than Adolf Hitler.  The historical Temudgin was one of the most ruthless genocidal despots of all times.  The film hints at the Mongol practice of taking the children of beaten enemies and measuring them against the height of a wagon wheel.  All those that exceeded that height were killed on the spot.  Temudgin continued this practice for his entire reign.  When a city surrendured to him, Temudgin spared it and its inhabitants.  If it resisted, he reduced the buildings to rubble and put the residents to the sword--men, women, children.  That Temudgin is nowhere to be found here.  This Temudgin is a gentler more compassionate soul, who can even find it in his heart to forgive his bloodbrother who enslaved him and took away his family and possessions.  This Temudgin can reward a beaten army by accepting its helpless soldiers into his own forces.

MONGOL begins with a ten year old Temudgin, who is told by his father to choose a wife.  This Temudgin does but is told that he must wait five years to claim her.  His father is assassinated while his uncle claims the Khanate.  The boy grows up in solitude.  Eventualy, he reclaims his wife, Borte, only to lose her to kidnappers in the employ of his uncle.  Temudgin is captured and sold into slavery, where Borte aids in his escape.  The film moves forward in gripping scenes, all of which point toward Temudgin as uniting all Mongols under his banner.  He even posits a sort of Mongol Ten Commandments by which he swears before heaven that all Mongols must obey, even if he must slay half of them to convince the other half.  Temudgin comes across as basically a good sort, one whose traits of leadership are so apparent that he has no problem raising an army.  The actors speak in Mongol with English subtitles but simply watching facial and body language usually suffices to maintain viewer interest and knowledge.  The only major flaw is that the film merely presents as a given Temudgin's heavenly inspired traits of leadership.  Still, MONGOL is a major accomplishment that suggests that the gap between history and Hollywood may not be as insurmountable as is often the case.",1252022400,,2894,4.730538922155689

At the age of nine, Temudjin's father(Esugei), the khan at the time, shows him how to pick a wife. After doing so, the plan is for them to get married in five years. After Esugei is poisoned however, he dies and the Mongols he was travelling with take matters into their own hands. Pillaging and doing whatever they see fit. Temudjin becomes a slave and sets out to find his brother, Jamukha, who he feels is the only one who can help him. A few years pass. Temudjin, now a man, sets off to claim his wife. He winds up going through a lot of hardships in the process, but what doesn't kill you will only make you stronger. It is said that all Mongols are afraid of thunder, but what if they don't have a place to hide? They become one of the greatest Mongols in history and greatness comes to those who take it.

This movie is shot beautifully. Every shot is filled with vibrant colors and seems to be shot in a unique way. There are quite a few first person perspectives during battle sequences that are quite stunning. Seeing the blood splatter all over the camera is always a plus, in my eyes. The battle scenes are where the film truly shines. The way they're shot make you feel like you're in the middle of it all. The perspective on a lot of the angles during not only the battle sequences, but in the movie as a whole, are impressive in their own right. The music also lends a helping hand in making this movie incredible. While some of it wasn't to my liking, the majority of it fit the film like a glove and only enhanced what was going on in the film and what the characters were going through.

The main reason I checked out this movie was because of Tadanobu Asano. I've mentioned my admiration of his acting in the past, but I had heard that this was possibly the most physical role he ever had. That peaked my interest. Well that and the fact that he was headlining the film. He definitely doesn't disappoint in this and he only seems to impress me more with each film I see that he's involved with.

Mongol may not be as action packed as the trailer leads you to believe. There are a handful of really impressive action scenes, but there's a lot of character development in this as well. The acting is top notch and as I mentioned, the visuals will have your eyes glued to the screen the entire time. I think the last twenty minutes or so make this film worth seeing alone. While it isn't action packed for two hours straight, I like to think that if you're a fan of movies like 300 then you'll probably enjoy this.

3217716,5,B000WLYDNM,"This movie was as good as I'd heard it was supposed to be when it was in limited release in theaters. It traces the beginning of the rise of Genghis Khan, whose real name was Temudgin. I cannot vouch for all of the historical accuracy, but it really seems like the film makers attempted to be as accurate as possible to whatever is historically known about Temudgin's early life. The scenes on the Mongolian steppe are simply amazing.

There are gaps in the story which sometimes are confusing, which also leads me to believe that those gaps were intentionally left there, because we just don't know what happened during certain periods of Temudgin's early life. For example, in one scene he leaves his wife and children to unite the Mongols. He is seen on the scared mountain praying and asking his god for help to unite the people under basic laws. In the next scene he has an army of hundreds, if not thousands, of men and ready to face off in a final showdown against his blood brother, whom he met years earlier as a child. Unfortunately the movie doesn't explain how he got this large army.

One thing that the movie does extremely well is to explain Genghis Khan wasn't just a mythic warrior figure who laid waste to everything he came across. He was a man, and part of the reason for his success is that he cared for his people. In one early scene, his army wins a battle. Instead of taking all of the plunder for himself, he only takes 1/10th of a share and tells his army to divide the rest amongst themselves, but not to forget the families of those who died in battle. This, it seems, is the real secret to his success. He was not simply a warrior, he was an early politician that knew the secret of his success came from having the support of his people.

This is an extremely well done movie. I appreciated the fact the film makers used an all Mongolian cast and did not simply use American or Japanese actors who might have ""looked Mongolian."" The use of subtitles also did not take away one bit from the movie.

I really hope that the planned two more movies to complete the story of Genghis Khan's life are done as well as this one.",1241308800,,2149,4.391959798994975
3217717,5,B000WLYDNM,"From scale to score, from acting to cinematography, from plotline to quality, Mongol is every bit as amazing and epic as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Braveheart/dp/B00003CX95/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Braveheart</a>.  It's truly remarkable how closely the two movies resemble one another.  In my opinion, Braveheart is one of the best movies of the past twenty years, and no higher praise can be given.

As a young boy Temudgin (played brilliantly in adult years by Tadanobu Asano) learns from his father, the khan.  Bowing to his god Tengri, all of the customs of Mongol culture are passed down.  His father believes that finding a bride is one of the measures of a man, and as a nine year old, Temudgin takes Borte (Khulan Chuluun) as his own.  But when his father is killed by deceitful enemy offering a false peace offering, Temudgin must fend for himself at an early age.  After his father's death, he soon bonds with a loyal friend in early childhood - a relationship that both saves and curses him later in life.  As the years progress, he transforms from vulnerable young Mongol boy into a vibrant, unmatched warrior who causes equal parts fear and envy in all those view him.  His dream of a united Mongolian force is yet another threat which may separate clans.

Visually speaking, I have never seen a more beautiful movie.  Bountiful green valleys, oxbows snaking back and forth, barren grasslands so lifeless that their appearance alone kills wildlife, exploding mountain ranges climbing over one another, massive white snow banks that extend to the horizon and beyond into blindness; enough credit cannot be given.

For the cinematography and artistic quality alone, this movie is worth a viewing.

One part warring clans of Braveheart, one part suffering slave trade of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Apocalypto/dp/B000NOKFHQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Apocalypto</a>, this movie is every bit a tour de force that is nearly incomparable except to other visual masterpieces that take a few hours to watch but several months to forget.

While not as awe-inspiring as the film work, the battles provide enough to entice the most hardcore, bloodthirsty warfare zealot.

3217718,5,B000WLYDNM,"Kudos to Bodrov!  What a movie: piercing and breathtaking as an invasion of mongols itself!

Having grown up as a Russian, furthermore, in Moscow in the Arbat neighborhood literally a two lane street from Mongol Embassy (on what used to be called Voevodin Lane, across school #69), I have always been fascinated with the Mongol culture.  Frankly, what Russian wasn't after the three hundred year Mongol-Tartar yoke?!

This isn't the story of conquest, but a story of love, forgiveness, and detachment from the material.  Before the great Khan became the man to take away others' freedom he had to find his own.  Bodrov's movie is a close up on an undeviating flight of consciousness powered by personal ethics (operating from Kohlberg's highest stage of moral development, that stage in which a mind makes its own rules, balancing on the brink of enlightenment and sociopathy).  Bodrov reveals the spirituality of the motive: ""never betray your khan,"" i.e. the spirituality of integrity (in the sense of being true to your self, with any given ""khan"" being nothing more than a projection of one's Self with which one later identifies).

In Bodrov's interpretation, Genghis' military success seems to owe more to the integrity of his army and secularity of leadership (that did not impose its religion but only law and taxes) than to military acumen.  The Mongol conquest, unlike, say the Crusades, did not seem to attempt to rob people of their psychological sovereignty but only of the attempts to possess that which doesn't belong to anyone anyway, in a kind of bloody spiritual detoxification and re-prioritization.
Who knows?!  But what a beautiful interpretation.
Cinematographically, the movie has the best of that Dovzhenkesque (a school of Soviet cinematography) slow-motion focus on detail, exemplified in such visually and metaphorically rich scenes as; falling through the ice, from the snow-white surface of the day, into the murky underwater of the unconscious; the shamanic communion with the wolf essence; Khan's brother's spin-around-and-slide-into-the-sleeves-of-an-offered-sable-coat harmony of uninterrupted physical flow of a relaxed mind; etc, etc.

The cast and characters are amazing: Temujin's psychopathic calmness, Jamukha's face-saving mannerism of throwing back his head in demonstrative acceptance of ""what is,"" Borte's inspiring beauty and non-interference with Temujin's existential trajectory (despite her obvious romantic attachments and preferences).

Bodrov's emphasis on choice - in Brother, in Mongol - reveals an existential commitment of his own, a commitment to finding the humanity of motive behind the inhumanity of action.

3217720,4,B000WLYDNM,"""Mongol"" may not be the grandly epic tale of conquest that one would imagine the great Genghis Khan to have, but it takes the shell of the khan's life story and builds around it a portrait of life in the steppes. It starts with the humble origins of Genghis Khan as Temudgen, the juvenile son of a minor khan. When his father dies, he is labeled a threat by other players in the clan and is slated to die. Following a series of trying but miraculous events, Temudgen grows up and finds his betrothed Borte and takes his rightful place as khan of his clan. He sees the constant war between the clans and vows to unite all clans under a simple set of laws that would lay the foundation of the Mongol Empire.

 It is no secret that ""Mongol"" takes many liberties with the life of Temudgen. Many characters are amalgams of multiple historical figures and certain events in the film are completely fabricated. It adds a level of drama to the film and provides an intriguing layer of suffering to Temudgen's life. If one were trying to watch an accurate historical drama, this film is not that. What it does accomplish flawlessly is the bare bones and beautiful culture of the Mongol nomads. Though it depicts a culture steeped in constant strife, ""Mongol"" shows the complexities of the Mongol politics and tradition. With swooping vistas and wide shots, the film's direction makes it abundantly clear how the desolate environment affects the people who live there.  It gives the viewer a greater appreciation of the nomadic lifestyle.

 While it fails to provide an accurate depiction of Temudgen's life or even his full personality, ""Mongol"" uses the legend of the greatest conqueror in the world to paint a picture of the Mongol people. Through all the battles and blood, the real story of ""Mongol"" is the never-ending struggle of the steppe, which is the most engaging.",1238976000,4,1866,4.711656441717792

I'm sure I will now be reading more.  I thought that having to read English subtitles might take some enjoyment away from the film, but it actually contributes to it.  Somehow I don't think having the actors speak English or having English dubbed over Mongolian would have worked as well.  I thought the director brought the movie to a conclusion too rapidly and I would have liked to see more of his actual solidifying of power in Mongolia rather than skipping to a great single final battle scene (I believe there were actually many battles and this one is something of a composite of them all).  I understand the purpose for this approach though.

There is an interesting parallel in this film to Gladiator as both heroes seek to return and avenge their loss but as in gladiator, in a broader sense to restore order in governing. In the case of Genghis, a centralized Mongolian empire with a unifying code of conduct centered on Genghis' fair treatment of soldiers and for those that suffer his conquest.  Tadanobu Asano, Genghis,  is considered by some as the Japanese Johnny Depp as he is an excellent actor and has a presence that requires no verbalization.

3217729,2,B000WLYDNM,"Mongol - movie review

One part violence, one part authentic & stunning visual cinematography, and unfortunately one part boring. I don't want to be overly critical, but I found myself managing through parts of this movie that seemed sleepy, unengaging and oddly repetitive. There were other parts I really liked, finding my imagination captured, even distantly recalling scenes from ""Conan The Barbarian"" (father & son scene discussing their god).

Also, please note, I want to clarify that I'm sensitive to the notion that Asian actors might be perceived by someone like me (a caucasian American) as lacking in range of emotion and facial expressions, and perhaps that's a better alternative to over acting. But with Temudjin's grown-up ""Brother""/turned-enemy showcasing a livelier character, I was left wishing for more from Temudjin himself. Also, the transition of Temudjin from childhood to suddenly +40 year old actor was a filmmaker's faux pas.

A movie true to the tale, or in need of a script revision? I am undecided. Lastly, in some spots I felt the fight scenes were not up to the standard of story telling quality as the rest of the film, especially when he tosses the spear into a victim who suddenly springs backwards, and the computer animated blood effects seemed a little off in color. I'm probably being way too picky, but as much as I tried to embrace this movie, I found myself yawning and picking up on the little details.",1232496000,5,1445,4.962809917355372
3217730,4,B000WLYDNM,"This Russian production, the first part of a planned trilogy, was filmed in Kazakhstan with actors from a number of Asian nationalitiesm and is a very enjoyable film, in the tradition of classic epic cinema, on the early years on Genghis Khan, from the day he was born until the day he was named ruler of all the Mongols. After surviving a number of adventures and occasional setbacks, the young Temudjin positions himself as the future ruler of more than half of Eurasia (the largest empire ever, in terms of its area), Genghis Khan probably comes out as a guy that is a lot nicer than he probably was, and his wife's influence on him appears as improbable in a medieval Asian society (the early scene where as a child he chooses as his bride from a lesser clan, against the wishes of his father, is one of the movie's best). Despite this and other inaccuracies, this is a very entertaining epic. Filmed in lush photography which shows in widescreen the natural beauty of the Central Asian plain, it is wonderfully directed by Russia's Sergei Bodrov, who certainly knows how to entertain an audience in the classical tradition.",1232236800,,1128,4.702020202020202
3217731,3,B000WLYDNM,"The most pleasing part of this film, I thought, was the excellent cinematography. Kudos to Roger Stoffers and Sergei Trofimov for an outstanding job photographing this movie, making the most bleak of landscapes look stunning many times and adding some wonderful closeup shots of objects and faces.

It's not a bad story, either, although not one that will keep you riveted to the screen for the full two hours. However, I wasn't bored, either, although some of the action scenes looked too repetitive with very hokey-looking special-effects concerning blood splashing out of people in the battle scenes. It did not look real, but as if it were drawn. It's ironic in that the production values seem to be so high with a such a nicely-filmed effort, yet the action scenes are staged like a B-movie.

In a nutshell, this is the story of how ""Genghis Kahn,"" who is ""Temudjin"" throughout the movie, spent his tough early life and how he became the famous warrior. We just see how many hardships the man endured to become who he was later in life. He was never referred to as Genghis Kahn which, I learned hear, is a title more than a name. That must have come later, after he had control of all the Mongol armies, which is where the film ends.

Many times, it's a not a pleasant existence for ""Temudjin,"" who was marked man from the age of nine. We see him spend many lonely hours held captive in different places. The looks on his face are memorable. Odnyam Odsuren ad the young ""Temudjin"" and Tadanobu Asano as the adult ""Temudjin"" both had extraordinarily photographic faces.

One of the few problems I had with the movie were understanding ""the rest of the story"" as certain scenes ended abruptly leaving me (and I assume other viewers) wondering ""what happened?"" His friends, though, were fun to watch and his bride was a beautiful, kind and strong woman, as pictured in this movie. Actually, I found this just as much of a love story as a war epic, and the romance angle was far more dramatic. The devotion the lead male and female had to each other, and the faithfulness and loyalty were inspiring, to say the least.",1231977600,22,2118,4.64

Excellent performances from Khulan Chuluun (Borte, his wife) and Sun Honglei as Jamukha (his blood brother) add to the narrative at large. Without blabbing away more (as other reviewers), this is a part of history that can only be told from tales, adding a bit of supernatural to the proceedings (the lore of Tengri). Editing & costumes are great, and the exquisite cinematography captures so much of the landscapes, the land that Temudgen so much wanted to unite.

The assessment was that you should let the visuals wash over you and not try to make sense of the narrative.  The story is too fragmentary and too historically dubious/wrong to warrant any consideration (what is there comes across as bad soap opera).

The problems with the (fortunately brief) battle scenes were apparent to everyone, causing complaints to be hurled as the screen.  Since nonsensical battle scenes are so routine in movies, this reaction suggests that people expected better (higher standards) from this movie.

What would be major problems in other movies are trivial transient annoyances, and even that disappeared when I treated the biographic scenes as simply slice-of-life.  With that, those scenes became satisfying, contributing to the overall movie.  That is, treat the title of the movie as just ""Mongol"", with no mention of Genghis Khan.  However, you probably won't want to completely ignore the subtitles, so keep your remote handy to rewind after reading them so that you can appreciate the visuals.

I rented it from Red Box (a DVD rental machine found at U.S. supermarkets) the day before Thanksgiving and the family watched it that night.  It matched a large amount of my reading as far as land and culture were concerned.  How historically accurate the film is, I'm not sure.  No two books in English seem to be in total agreement on the life of Timojen (I've seen it spelled three or four different ways), so I won't comment on the accuracy.  The violence was rather less graphic than the PG-13 rated ""Beowulf"" or a lot of video games (I'm wondering why the ""R"" rating); the worst is that when a sword strikes, usually just out of frame, a spray of blood flies up.  Otherwise, there are sexual situations but no nudity.

Whether Genghis Khan was a good guy or a bad guy depends on which end of the sword you were on.  If you didn't take up arms against him and payed your taxes (which generally dropped under the new overlord), he pretty much left you to run things your own way.  The quality of life for the common herd seems to have improved, a saying of the time was ""A virgin could walk from one end of the empire to the other with a bag of gold on her head with complete safety.""

3217749,4,B000WLYDNM,"Everything about an epic is done on grand scale: It is a work of art that crosses a great expanse of land, involves several generations, and focuses on the life of a great hero and including magic and great feats. ""Mongol"" certainly meets this definition. Temudjin is not yet a hero, but by the end of the film, the viewer sees this man rise from year after year of personal defeat to becoming Mongolia's greatest leader, indeed, one of history's greatest leaders.

Add to the basic story line taken directly from the mists of history when little was recorded of this particular hero is a cast and crew of epic proportions. Sergei Bodrov, the director, is Russian; Tadanobu Asamo, who plays Temudjin, is Japanese, and Khulan Chuluun, or Borte, Temudjin's hand-picked wife, was picked by the director from the streets of a city in Mongolia. Sun Honglei, who plays Jamukha, the blood brother, is Chinese.

The story follows history accurately, as best is known. As another reviewer did, I also want to compare this film with ""Genghis Khan: To the End of the Earth and Sea,"" directed by Shinichiro Sawai, a Japanese, with Takashi Sorimachi, a Japanese actor in the title role. ""Mongol"" may have been nominated for an Academy Award for Best Foreign Film, but I tip my hat to ""Genghis Khan"" for a more detailed story and a better understanding of characters across the board: Temujin, Borte, the mother, the blood brother.

The major difference between the two films is the story of the man and wife. As young children, she picked him as husband, convincing him to pick her. Against his father's wishes, he does so. His father the Khan was in the process of arranging a marriage with an enemy clan to heal enmity. Years later once they are wed, she is stolen from him by an enemy clan. In a most unusual battle in a most unusual place, Temudjin rescues his bride, binding them forever. An incident breaches the trust issue of the two blood brothers, which is never healed (two of Jamukha's best warriors go with Temudjin. According to this film, Temudjin first starts making up Mongol rules at this point. He tells Jamukha that ""Mongols are free to choose their leader.""

When he is captured, Borte moves mountain and stream to free him. Well, not exactly, but close to it. At one point when he leaves her to go start Mongolia, he tells her he will always come back. And he does.

""Mongol"" is more a minimalist film to reflect the minimalist setting in which the story is placed--wide open vistas, huge panoramas with mountainous scenery always in the distance. Any time Temudjun appears on the open plains, he runs (if he doesn't have a horse--A Mongol always rides his horse), as if to say, one cannot get anywhere if he doesn't run.

Even though ""Genghis Khan"" is filmed in similar territory, there is a greater sense of detail--in clothing, habitat, and story. At the end the Disney figure of Mulan appears in the story as a lead soldier in Genghis's army.

His birth name was Temudjin, and the film follows him from a nine year old boy, until approximately his early thirties when he unites the numerous Mongol tribes under his banner. As one would expect, life on the Mongolian steppe in the 12th century is harsh; constant tribal warfare, being kidnapped and sold into slavery, having your bride stolen by a rival tribe, seeing your father poisoned to death; this is the environment that molded the young Temudjin into a hardened killer. The film is very violent, but it is also beautiful in its own way. Even in such a harsh atmosphere, there is room for love, loyalty, brotherhood, and honor. I can't speak for the historical accuracy, but the film does seem to paint a relatively benign picture of Temudjin, his betrayal of his blood brother Jamukha notwithstanding. Considering that the guy was essentially a mass murderer, I can definitely see how some would call this a whitewash. From a technical perspective, the film is nearly flawless; breathtaking cinematography, great acting, amazing score, fight choreography, costumes, etc. The film is put together very well. One is tempted to compare 'Mongol' to such historical epics as Braveheart and Gladiator, and in some ways it is similar, but I would say Mongol is less romantic, and more realistic, but equally good in its own way.",1227571200,,1481,4.928

Based upon the latter, the Japanese produced DVD seems more accurate, as the story lines in both while similar diverge at times.  The Japanese production is focused on Genghis Khan's [more appropriately Temujin, his name before he became Khan] mother and her voice narrates, whereas this DVD focuses on Temujin's relationship with his wife Boorte.  The defining difference is that this movie is in Mongol where the Japanese is in Japanese.  Thid DVD appropriately focuses on the ""blue Wolf"" which is Temujin's tribe, versus the japanese DVD penchant to focus on eagles or hawks.  All in all it was a good DVD with a strong story line, but I am skeptical about the story itself, but since there is no definitive history, one must draw their own conclusions.  I recommend the DVD for its visuals, but also suggest that those who want more should check out the other sources above.",1227052800,3,1153,4.74
3217754,4,B000WLYDNM,"""Mongol"" is a sweeping epic of the life of Mongolian conqueror Genghis Khan, intended as the first installment in a trilogy. This first chapter brings us the legendary childhood and youth of the great military leader, up to the point when he unites Mongolia under one rule. A spare voiceover narration takes us back to the fateful day when 9-year-old Temudjin (Odnyam Odsurem) chose his young bride and lost his father, Khan Esugei (Ba Sen). Temudjin (Asano Tadanobu) then spends nearly 20 years as a fugitive from his father's successor Targutai (Amadu Mamadakov) and his clan's traditional enemies, the Merkits. Enslaved repeatedly and always intent on reuniting with his wife Borte (Khulan Chuluun), Temudjin dreams of a more peaceful and unified Mongolia. When he finally gains his freedom it is only his equally ambitious ""blood brother"" Jamukha (Honglei Sun) who stands in his way.

The earliest source of information about Genghis Khan's youth is a poem entitled ""A Secret History of the Mongols"" that was written after his death. It may be fanciful, and there is a 10-year gap in information, in any case. But ""Mongol""'s Russian director and co-writer Sergei Bodrov has used the poem as inspiration to construct his tale of Genghis Khan's origins. Temudjin is also presented in such a way as to appeal to more modern values: a man who believes in the greatness of his country, but also generosity to his warriors, loyalty to family, and rule of law. Bodrov doesn't attempt to disguise the legendary nature of his subject. He presents Temudjin as enjoying the favor of his pan-god Tengri and coming to power through destiny as much as through perseverance.

This is an action movie with bloody battles as well as a quasi-mythic biography, and I found the CGI heavy-handed in the final battle. But ""Mongol"" is a Hollywood-style epic amazingly made for only $20 million. Filmed amid stunning landscapes in remote Mongolia, China, and Kazakhstan, it and looks like it cost three times that. This is a majestic recreation of Genghis Khan's rise to power, but it's not entirely lacking in humor. Borte is a shrewd and loyal wife who ironically tends to bear children by other men, much to the audience's amusement, if not Temudjin's. Sergei Bodrov embraces the recent trend to cast actors who must learn their lines phonetically. Asano Tadanobu is Japanese, and Honglei Sun is Chinese. Both men have an imposing presence, but the film is in Mongolian with optional English, English SDH, and Spanish subtitles. There are no bonus features on the New Line 2008 DVD.",1226620800,2,2565,4.976689976689976

Previews had seduced me with its deference to local language and an apparently, Mongol cast. Chuck in a bit of throat singing and you have a readymade recipe for western viewers.

And the effort of the old priest edging his way across the deserts to find the long abandoned Khan's family, is pathetic at best.

3217759,3,B000WLYDNM,"Not a film for viewers expecting lotsa violent battles. Not a film for those expecting an objective biography.

This film, by Russian writer/director Sergei Bodrov, is a ponderous biography of Temujin (spelled 'Temudgin' in the movie) before he became the great Genghis Khan.

Despite my rating, I sat almost transfixed cuz I've long been interested in Genghis Khan. Here, Bodrov and his team gave an authentic look and feel to the people and the place -- in the midst of the most breathtaking Mongolian landscapes.

The look and feel is helped by the apparent use of legitimate Mongols in the cast who are probably making their first and only appearance in a movie. The young woman playing Temujin's wife, Khulan Chuluun, does a decent job. Japanese actor Tadanobu Asano as the mature Temujin is appropriately inscrutable and looks like the iconic images of the man. Then there's the full-blooded presence of Chinese actor Honglei Sun who steals the film as Temujin's blood brother Jamulke.

But I found myself bothered by several elements.

There's large dose of revisionism here. It's as if Bodrov wants to say: Genghis Khan wasn't all that bad -- his actions can be explained by his suffering at the hands of his enemies -- and he brought a code of justice to his people (however flimsy) -- and, most important of all, he loved and was loved by his main wife. That's how the story was shaped. Of course, it's easier to sympathize with Temujin the Victim than with Genghis Khan the Savage Conquerer, which we don't get to see.

The story as presented here differs in large chunks from the versions I'm familiar with (the insightful story of Temujin's murder of his half-brother is missing -- and Temujin a prisoner of the Chinese?!). But I can't call it unfaithful to history since details of Genghis Khan's early life is pretty much lost to history except for a somewhat unreliable narrative produced by the Mongols sometime after his death (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Secret-History-of-the-Mongols/dp/0887272991/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">""Secret History of the Mongols""</a>). So writers can embellish all they want.

There's a touch of the supernatural which in a honest biography wouldn't be included. In this mixed-bag of a movie, it fits.

The clichd battle scenes are stolen from many recent bravado films set in the past. Except, the CGI is less convincing than usual (I don't think I've ever seen more fakey blood spattering).

Still I managed to be engrossed -- but you might not be. If you're expecting something over-the-top like the movie ""300"", boy, are you going to be disappointed!",1224288000,9,2643,5.127906976744186
3217760,4,B000WLYDNM,"Recent Best Foreign Oscar Film nominee `Mongol' is an impressive epic.  Telling the first installment of the life and times of Ghengis Khan, we get more than a history lesson, but a personal account of a fraternal feud for power.  Filmed with breathtaking cinematography and a sound that should have garnered a separate nomination, the movie is a sweeping drama, complete with battles that make similar `300' scenes obvious digitalized formula.

Although the film goes ahead (mostly in chronological order) with several ""One Year Later"" and other useful captions, we lose ourselves in a story of one man's struggle for survival among his Khan and the love interests that shape, bind and beget tribal rivalries and aspirations.  We follow the coming-of-age footsteps of Temujin (Tadanobu Asano) and his older rival Targutai (Amandu Mamadakov) who both strive for power and read the oracles of gods like Tengri, whom they beckon for help.

Some of the battles are Trojan-like in thrust.  Temujin will spare no one for Borte (Khulan Chuluun), his lifelong love interest.  Between his patient endurance and his love, Temujin becomes a leader who can match wills with any Mongol tribe.  Going from tribal feuds to a far-reaching dynasty, the film chronicles the real human faces that made history happen.

Before becoming Khan, he must master the elements.  Between the harshness of tundra to humiliation and hunger, the sharp edge of life known for bitterly cold winters, make or break the existence of people who rely on their armies, shelter, and horses to survive.

It cannot be emphasized enough how the lingering beauty of each frame is arresting enough to justify viewing this two hour and five minute film.  Furthermore, the haunting audio accentuating tribal customs and battle scenes resonate with mesmerizing grandeur.  Although being reserved is perhaps a cultural trait, I felt some of the scenes could have added a bit more zest to the acting, but much of the intensity is non-verbal and convincing indeed.  Writer-director, Sergei Bodrov, deserves heaping praises for building such a tightly built drama and some truly exquisitely shot scenes.

Although released last year and up for 2007's Oscar jury, both the cinema and DVD releases came about this year, so it's not too late to hold 'Mongol' as one of the truly worthy epics and one of the best movies to come out all year.

3217761,5,B000WLYDNM,"Mongol may not be the most accurate movie I've ever seen, but the restraint shown by director Sergei Bodrov is a delightful and refreshing break from the past paced, cram-all-you-can into 90 minutes cinema of recent, as well as well as from the movies immersed in CGI.
I was surprised at the direction of the film on my first viewing, but appreciated it nonetheless. The cinematography was top notch; absolutely beautiful, and it really bolstered the movie to strip the vast, stark, and beautiful landscapes of too many seemingly desirable embellishments that might be prevalent in most films. While I mentioned CGI (which I am a fan of), it was refreshing to feel like everything you were watching was actually just totally real; not an illusion, but practically palpable.
To keep it blunt, I relished in the pace, wanting more by the end (and hopefully the words of a trilogy are true, because more Mongol would be excellent!). While there were just a couple of touches that might have been totally acceptable, considering the budget and the difficulties in production, Mongol looks and feels like a mega-budget flick that steers away from the monotonies of many flicks, and I liked that. It was one of my most enjoyable films from 2008, and certainly my most appreciated.

First off, the good stuff. The filming locations are spectacular and the lead performance by Tadanobu Asano as Genghis Khan was very well done. I also thought the music fit this flick like a glove.

Now the not so good stuff. I know this is suppose to be part one of a trilogy, but they barely scratched the surface here. I did a huge paper in college on Genghis Khan and the Mongol Empire and when this film ended I was left wanting so much more. They better finish his life story in the future or this will be a wasted piece of cinema. The movie also flows at a weird pace and seems longer than two hours. The battle scenes were okay, but they didn't have the epic quality of say Braveheart or Kingdom of Heaven.

I really wanted to love the movie, but it left me cold most of the time. It's still worth a rental if you like partial history and entertainment mashed together. Just don't expect the masterpiece this film could have been. I bet if they rolled all three movies together, trimmed some spots and made it around 3 and 1/2 hours long, it would have been exactly what I was looking for.

3217763,4,B000WLYDNM,"There has been many attempts to bring the life of Genghis Khan to the big screen. MONGOL (2007) is another attempt by director Sergei Bodrow, and has earned itself an academy award nomination. This film isn't a retelling of Khan's life in his height of power but rather, a biopic about his ascendance to becoming the ""Khan"" of all Mongols from such humble beginnings. The film's premise is very similar to the Japanese produced film, Genghis Khan: to the Ends of the Earth and Sea. This film is the first part of an intended trilogy about the life of Khan.

The story begins when we see a young Temudjin (Tadanobu Asano) looking for a bride. He chooses a young girl named Borte to be his wife in five years. After his father`s death, young Temudjin, is forced to flee when his father's second in command decides to take over. The film delves into the life of Temudjin through his journey that will lead him to become one of the greatest conquerors the world has ever known.

I am well aware that it is impossible to compress the life of a man as colorful as Genghis Khan in a measly two hours plus. It all depended on the filmmaker's approach on how and what needed to be put into bear in the film's running time. Just where does fact and fiction begin and end? The film certainly does feel rather a bit rushed to cover as much ground as possible that it jumps around in timeline. The film does have the usual themes of brotherhood, loyalty, family and commitment. The characters may feel a little underdeveloped and some knowledge in Khan's history would be an advantage in order to appreciate the film. It was a little curious as to some scenes seemed a little irrelevant but I do think that the filmmakers wanted to focus on Temudjin's relationship and devotion to his wife Borte.

Borte (played by Khulan Chuluun) is no mere wife to Temudjin. This character is almost as stubborn and strong-willed as her husband. She has her own story to tell, she exhibits her devotion and undying love to Temudjin in ways that would seem almost unbelievable. The phrase; ""stand by your man"" can be the film's major selling point. Borte would do anything to save and preserve her relationship to Temudjin; to the point of even selling her body. Tadanobu Asano's performance is definitely one for the record books, and the actor carries most of the film's burden along with Chuluun. Asano plays the grim, brooding conqueror very convincingly. The man is such a chameleon, he can adapt to almost any role from ""Party 7"" to ""A Taste Of Tea"" to ""Mongol"". The film portrays Khan as an inspiration and a man of destiny, which is a change from other portrayals of the Mongol conqueror (other depictions show him to be a heartless, ruthless ruler). His intimidating figure has been downplayed a little to show the humanity inside, and this could be a double-edged sword.

The film is so far from perfect. Aside from the script feeling a bit rushed, the film does have its share of obvious fictional elements. There are touches of mysticism in the film; Temudjin relationship with the Mongol God of the Sky Tengri seemed rather too heavy-handed. The scene with the Chinese monk does do a great job in setting up the film's final act but it felt too convenient, (luckily this played out well in the film's end). It would also have been extremely helpful if they fleshed out Temudjin's character as to how he developed into such a skilled general. The emphasis on the ""man of destiny"" formula did rather overstay its welcome somewhat.

Of course, with a film about Genghis Khan, you can expect some battle scenes. There are actually two major sequences of bloodshed; the raid on a Merkit camp and the final battle between Temudjin and his ""blood brother"" Jamukha (Sung Hong Ley). The two sequences are quite decent although lacking in intense spectacle as we're used to other grand epics such as ""LOTR"" and ""Braveheart"". The final result of the climactic battle also does feel rather silly and failed to be impressive. (even if its resolution was backed by historical records)

Much to the film's credit, the film's cinematography and camerawork are quite impressive. The film definitely looks quite nifty. The costumes and set designs does provide the proper atmosphere for a historical epic, despite the sometimes lackluster execution. The cast is also mostly made up of actual Mongols and the dialogue is in Mongol which does give the film a lot of ambition in regards for an epic feel. Sung Hong Ley almost steals the spotlight as Jamukha, clearly director Bodrov picked the right actor to play Temudjin's rival.

Complaints aside, ""Mongol"" is actually a good film. The film is entertaining enough despite its uneven and heavy-handed elements. The great performances and the film's pace does provide an entertaining experience. It does lack a bit in the action sequences, so folks who are looking for a bloody film may be disappointed. Just keep in mind that this is the first installment in an intended trilogy; the bloodiest and most exciting aspects of Khan's life may still be forthcoming.

3217765,4,B000WLYDNM,"This first of a planned trilogy about the feared and celebrated Mongol Chingis Khan (Genghis to Westerners), Sergei Bodrov's ""Mongol"" covers the early life of Temudjin and his rise to Chingis, ruler of all who lived in felt tents. After his father's early death and treachery by fellow tribesmen, Temudjin must survive and rise from the dust of Mongolia's vast steppes to take back what is his. Along his path and arduous youth he has a vision of uniting all the Mongol people under one law (hint, not the law of a representative democracy).

Editing is choppy and slows the film at several points in its two-hour plus length, usually between major chapters within the main tale. The film could have ended at some of the later points, but then it moves on to one more major scene.

It is in the visuals that ""Mongol"" excels. One really gets a sense of what life in twelfth-century Mongolia looked like. Scenes depicting nomadic life, the rituals of inter-tribal exchanges, fur and animal-skin clothing while riding under a baking sun drinking horsemilk and eating room-temperature mutton, are clear and vivid windows to the past. To say nothing of the sweeping views of Mongolia, Kazakhstan and Russia.

The battle scenes are Hollywood but realistic enough. The final battle between Temudjin and his best friend--and now enemy--Jamukha, is a masterful recreation of the Mongol way of horse-mounted warfare. An awe-inspiring scene is when a detachment of black-armored warriors charge their enemy, each man with two swords drawn, hunched low on his steed.

Overall Sergei Bodrov's ""Mongol"" is historically inaccurate but a visual stunner. Tadanobu Asanu and Sun Hong-Lei shine while Khulan Chuluun is positively luminous. With ""Mongol,"" the director has delivered in a very big way.",1221004800,10,1781,5.089041095890411
3217766,5,B000WLYDNM,"...but considering the minimal budget (20 million dollars American) and the genuine Mongolian (some areas so isolated that new roads had to be built to get the film crews there) locations filmed, this was a fantastic movie that was well-paced for an introduction to the life of Temudjin, who would become the Genghis Khan.

Despite the low budget, nothing in the movie looks cheaply filmed; everything looks like that of a big budget film six times more expensive, from costumes to makeup (and the craggly dirt buildup on Temudjin during his time in captivity).  I don't speak Mongolian, so I can't tell whether the accents spoken are accurately Mongolian, but for an American audience, it was great for authenticity (rather than having them speak Russian or Kazakh).

The movie excels in two particular aspects which really make this one more than just a casual ancient-world flick; the battles and the people.

While Genghis Khan is demonized in the West as a barbarous conqueror, he is seen like a hero in the East, and this movie serves to show him as both and neither, making him more than just black or white, but a fully fleshed out person with ambitions to uniting all the Mongol tribes as one beneath him.  He is utterly believable as a human being, fallible, and seemingly very much driven by his love for his wife and children, whom he nevertheless must leave constantly to fulfill his dream.

There is also Jamukha, who manages to be both a piggish, slothy figure, and a noble, loyal friend to Temudjin, when their dreams conflict and they become enemies, with a very painful and realistic portrayal of just why Jamukha would betray Temudjin, and his lack of joy in facing his opponent on a field of battle.

Then there's the battles.  As any Ancient/Medieval war movie to be expected, it is bloody.  My only annoyances in a puritanic-historian way were the suits of armor, which seemed not to be made of much metal as they would have been in Mongolian times.

Another minor thing that becomes a little excessive, and arguably rather like a recurring joke is shots of blood, showing them being spilled in thousands of thick drops rather than in fountains or bursts of liquid.

The final battle sequence manages to both utilize the Mongolian expertise in archery and cavalry and innovate with something both insanely risky and never before seen in Medieval battle depictions.  Likely seen in the trailer, as Jamukha sends the bulk of his cavalry force at Temudjin's center, he unleashes a very small number of thickly armored cavalry, armed with double curves swords, which then rush through the enemy cavalry, using the swords to slash at the enemy's sides like Scythed Chariots.

The armored cavalry is a kamikaze force, as after brutalizing the enemy cavalry, Temudjin has his archers unleash a flood of arrows on the force, killing the cavalry on both sides down to a man.

Overall a great movie, which doesn't sacrifice the macro-story of Genghis Khan and his dream of a Mongol empire for the micro-story of Temudjin's love life.  Of which I wrote virtually nothing about.",1221004800,152,3088,4.844106463878327

We do see swords swing as grimy faces spouting a confusion of Japanese and Korean accents slice their way through layers of leather and roadkill (assisted by generous CGI blood), but the budget only allows for one truly epic battle (more suggested than seen) that is the climax of a trail of brisk and kinetic skirmishes.

The USSR occupied Mongolia for a number of years and did certain objectable things.  But they also built concert halls and educated the young in the arts and technology.

There is a lot of violence...which is to be expected, afterall Temujin lived a life of constant conflict. Some may think its excessive, but having seen war first hand myself in real life, trust me, its tame by comparison.

A side effect of all the violence in the movie is that it implies that Mongols are a savage race...in fact this is the opposite. Under mongolian rule, to name a few:

1. religious tolerance across the entire empire...the strength and distribution of different religions in the world are forever changed by mongol conquests
2. knowledge and skills were spread throughout the empire...anything from crafts to professions to sciences

This movie is of course, Sergei's interpretation. The contents as expected aren't historically accurate, and of course includes some romanticization on Sergei's part. But then again, those of you that seeks truth in a movie, or those that thinks movie are ""historical documents"" (like the clueless aliens in Galaxy Quest), should really go read up on the definition of ""entertainment"".

3217772,4,B000WLYDNM,"MONGOL:  CHINGISHAN is an epic film.  Director Sergei Bodrov captures the first installment of a trilogy of the life of one of history's most larger than life figures, the early life of Mongolian ruler Genghis Khan from 1186-1206.  From the age of ten years old up to his rise as Khan ruler, viewers will see Genghis Khan's perilous journey that involved friends and foes, but one that also centered on the god, Tengri, from whom he soughtt continuous guidance.

Bodrov portrays the human side of Temudgin (Asano Tadanobu), the name he was born with.  First, as a boy choosing his young wife, Borte (Bayetsetserg Erdenbat), and later as a ruler and family man of two children, who has countless misses with his wife (Khulan Chuluun) where he loses and regains her through unusual circumstances; also, there is the blood brother relationship between he and Jamukha (Honglei Sun), who is the warrior-like character in the film who adds a little humor in between war scenes; it is a relationship that is both brotherly and friendly despite the debacles that occur.

Indeed, the cinematography and the soundtrack make the film.  The spacious mountainous and grassy landscapes, which was shot in China and Kazakhstan is absolutely beautiful and captures the essence of the film.  MONGOL surpasses all other versions of films that have depicted the life of Genghis Khan; this version has a foreign film quality with subtitles and is superbly done.  Bodrov shows the warrior-tribal and nomadic aspect of the Mongolian people.  The film has an old Hollywood western-like quality similar to the Cowboys chasing the Indians, bow and arrows being shot, and tee-pee-like settlements are displayed; one can say that this film was made the old way without the pyrotechnics, digital effects, and chanting and thumping soundtracks that have coveted most epic films in recent times a la LORD OF THE RINGS.

Overall, MONGOL may interest the history buff or foreign film aficionado.  But be forewarned, the film shows a tremendous amount of graphic and brutal violence.  No doubt, Bodrov precisely shows the distinct portrayal of the Mongols who fought endless wars to claim the largest empire that existed in world history.",1216425600,2,2205,5.074792243767313
3217773,4,B000WLYDNM,"Mongol (Sergei Bodrov, 2007)

Despite the fact that Tadanobu Asano is a superstar across the Pacific, I never thought I'd get the chance to see an Asano movie on the big screen here in America. So before I do anything else, I have to thank-- profusely-- Picturehouse, Mongol's American distributor, and say that I hope against hope that this is the beginning of a beautiful partnership. America needs more Asano on the big screen. I am even happier to say that, while this isn't Asano's best work, the movie itself is quite strong, and there are a lot of other actors who turn in performances almost as, or just as, good as Asano's to make this into a quite enjoyable moviegoing experience.

Asano plays Temudjin (as an adult), the man who became Genghis Khan. The movie opens with us seeing Asano's face, crusted with grime, staring out through the bars of a cage. What in the world...?, you may ask. I mean, this is the guy who conquered the entire known world, right? Well, it does eventually make sense. Much of the movie is told in flashback, and much of it centers around Temudjin's relationship with his wife Borte (Khulan Chuluun), whom he first meets at the age of nine, and who sticks with him from that point despite that fact that, well, he's not really around much, since he's off conquering and warring and all that stuff. And yes, there's a good deal of that to be found here, despite that fact that this deals with the years before Temudjin became Genghis Khan; before he united them, the Mongols liked to fight amongst themselves a great deal, and Temudjin himself was often the spoils over which the wars were being fought. (Explaining why would take too long; trust me, he spends a lot of time as a prisoner for a while there.) Eventually, he makes friends with another young chap named Jamukha (played as an adult by Honglei Sun), and the two of them together start the long, tedious grind of fight, assimilate, fight, assimilate--  except that something goes horribly wrong. And now we're well into spoiler territory, so I'll stop there.

Make no mistake, Mongol is an action movie, but in saying that, I should also say that structurally, it reminds me more of epic westerns than it does conventional action pictures-- movies like The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly or Tombstone where there are relatively few moments of action punctuating a tale that's more intrigue than blood flow. Movies like this have a propensity to fall on their faces if the intrigue isn't properly paced. Mongol, which was nominated for the Best Foreign Film Academy Award (losing to Stefan Ruzowitzky-- no shame there) and which swept six Nika Awards (Russia's version of the Oscars), every category in which it was nominated, is pretty obviously one of those movies that doesn't fall on its face in this regard. Bodrov (Nomad) has quite a head for this sort of thing, it would seem.

It should also be noted that some of the history is fudged, and a great deal is oversimplified, but you have to expect that. It is a movie, after all.

Even if you're not an obsessive Tadanobu Asano fan, I strongly suggest catching this one on the big screen while you still have the time; it's the kind of cast-of-thousands epic that can't help but lose something in translation. A very, very good film. ****",1216339200,,3290,4.663793103448276
3217774,3,B000WLYDNM,"This 2007 film, nominated for a Best Foreign Film Academy Award is one of those epic bloodbaths that I find pure escapism, especially on a hot summer's day on a wide screen.  Directed by Russian director Sergei Bodrav, it was co-produced by companies in Kazakhstan and Mongolia and  is the first part of a planned three-part series.

Mongol is about the early years of the famed Genghis Khan. During his lifetime (from 1162 to 1227) his Mongol Empire eventually occupied most of Asia.  Later, his descendants went on to stretch the Mongol Empire across most of Eurasia, including all of modern China as well as substantial portions of Russia, Southern Asia, Eastern Europe and the Middle East.

The story starts when the young Genghis Khan (then called Tomudgen) was nine years old.  He and his father and a small group of warriors felt it was time for him to find a bride.  They traveled to a neighboring nomadic camp and here he met ten-year-old Botte.  In spite of the fact that his father wanted him to choose his bride from a different tribe, Tomudgen insisted on Botte.  They were betrothed and plans were made for Tomudgen to return in five years to claim her.

However, on the way back home, his father was poisoned by enemies and young Tomudgen was taken prisoner and received harsh treatment.  He escaped however and was befriended by another boy who later grew up to first be his friend and later his enemy.

The film is comprised of almost non-stop violence.  There's a huge cast of warriors for the many battle scenes.  Blood flows, and after a while it does get boring.  But there is also a fair share of torture to break the monotony.  Eventually, Botte and Tomudgen marry but she is captured by a warlord, and it takes him two years to rescue her.  They are separated again later and this time it is she who rescues him.  Most of the time this story held my interest but I would have preferred the battle scenes to be shorter.  There is just so much spurting blood I can take.

This is in no way a great film.  There is so much violence that is soon becomes meaningless.  And there are a few parts that stretch the imagination just too much, such as the time that the young Tomudgen falls though the ice in the middle of winter and miraculously survives and another time that he fights off a pack of wild dogs after years of being kept captive as a slave.  Certainly, this is not a film for everyone and I can only give it a very mild recommended.

However, I must say that I am looking forward to the sequel.",1215820800,3,2525,4.474835886214442
3217775,5,B000WLYDNM,"This incredible movie places one of history's most crucial lives against a spectacular series of landscapes. Taken only for their visual grandeur, the deserts, mountains, river valleys, and forests of western Asia and and eastern Europe create a backdrop of unexcelled beauty.

Unexcelled beauty also describes Brte (played by Khulan Chuluun), the Khan's wife. This movie is filled with beautiful people, but she stands out even among that crowd.

None of that detracts from the story of Temudjin, who history knows as Ghengis Khan. It follows him from young childhood, through his unification of all Mongolia. The story traces his many setbacks - late bloomers of every sort, here's a guy you can relate to. It also describes his wife and his marriage; suffice it to say that a man as powerful and driven as him deserves an equal. An additional thread in the story, his lifelong friend and enemy Jamukha creates a complex and shifting complement to Temudgin.

I can't vouch for it's historical accuracy; I'm sure many liberties were taken with the literal truth. That hardly matters. Ghengis Khan's rise to power deserves an epic telling on a stage as wide as all of Asia. It gets that telling in this magnificent movie.

3217776,3,B000WLYDNM,"This was an intimately ""back in time"" account of 24 years in the tempestuous life of the greatest Mongol Khan (leader) from the age nine years in 1182 to his successful ""final"" battle against his brothers.  His 1206 campaign culminated his laws of 1196 in which battles are won by the clever, not always the powerful.

As was custom of his his tribe, a nine-year old male chooses his bride (he looked like Miran as a child) and was advised to settle on a female with long legs.  A good woman is hard to find, he's told, and you need a horse more than a woman.  Later, he's told, ""you don't go to war over a woman.""  A girl taller than he, dressed in red, chose him.  Women brought a dowry like those in India, something valuable.

In 1186, he returned to the unfriendly tribe to claim his bride, and his is caught by his enemies on the way back home, before his future wife was able to consummate the pairing.  She is taken by the leader of the tribe to bear his son.  Genghis survived having a spear in his back as his mother nursed him,

The Mongols were vengeful, crude people who were afraid of thunder.  Image: Mark likes to watch the lightning as I used to do.  In 1192, after his wife was taken, he remained a prisoner and his wife is taken by the top dog and conceived a baby girl.  She gets the key to his ""cage"" and released him.  As he recouped, he looked so like Sadam Hussien with the beard and unfocused eyes.  Like hih, he had trusted the wrong people.

Since he'd been on the run, hiding outdoors, he learned to tolerate thunderstorms as he had no other place to go.  Mongols learned to run away from battle when they realize there was no other way to survive the instruments of death and the ferocious way they killed each other.  They were Barbarians dressed like Asian cowboy outlaws.  When they gathered for war, women and children were left behind to their fate.

Khan showed his men that they have the right to choose.  In the final battle of 1206, he and his men continued to fight during a thunderstorm, like Custer's last stand.  It was similar to our Civil War, brother against brother (a precursor).  He had nine lives like a cat, and united the Mongol tribes under his banner as the greatest leader of them all.",1215648000,7,2239,4.3421686746987955
3217777,1,B000WLYDNM,"The book mentioned above is the only valid, accepted translation, in historic form, of the ""Secret History of the Mongols,"" which is an accurate portrayal of the life of Chinggis Khan (name means Strong Leader).  All of Temujin's children were his own with a possible doubt being with Juchi, his first born, due to Borte being kidnapped by Merkits (another tribe).  Nonetheless, he accepted Juchi as his own son.  Juchi was the father of Batu Khan.

Another reason for low review is that the movie is not dubbed in various languages, such as ENGLISH.

I understand that the Japanese actor that played the part is an excellent actor.  However, it might have been a good idea to use Uzbeki or Khazakh actors and actresses to play the parts of Mongols because these people LOOK a lot more like the Mongols looked during the time of Temujin.  Turko-Tatar-Mongols do not look Chinese or Japanese - at least, they didn't used to.

They should have explained the Kuraltai.  If anyone wants to know the truth about these people, people so little known of in the West, get the book I mentioned in my caption for this review.",1214352000,6,1115,4.676923076923077
3217778,5,B000WLYDNM,"There's a fine line between depictions of war and needless graphic violence, and thankfully, ""Mongol"" doesn't cross it. Yes, moments of this film are brutal and bloody, but they don't overcrowd the film. More than enough room is left for a compelling human drama, a story of love, commitment, and strength in twelfth-century Mongolia. The ads imply that ""Mongol"" is the story of Genghis Khan, but that isn't really the case; this is the story of Temudjin, the boy who would grow up to become Genghis Khan and conquer half the known world. It's about the person, not the myth, and that above all made this a worthwhile experience. Filmed in 2007 but just now getting an American theatrical release, Sergei Bodrov's film is sweeping in its visual and emotional beauty, with cinematography that borders on the sublime and a simple yet significant story.

It's the year 1172 at the start of the story proper, and at that point, Temudjin is just nine years old (Odnyam Odsuren). He and his father, a Khan named Esugei (Ba Sen), are traveling from the Steppes of Mongolia to a distant clan because the time has come for Temudjin to choose a wife. When they stop and meet with a different clan, Temudjin meets a ten-year-old girl named Borte (Bayertsetseg Erdenebat); they immediately take a liking to each other, so much so that, by the time he leaves, he chooses her to be his wife. The plan is for Temudjin to return in five years time, at which point the union can be made official. But things take a tragic turn--a rival clan poisons Esugei, and Temudjin and his clan are left at the mercy of a treacherous lieutenant named Targutai (Amadu Mamadakov). Now enslaved and with his father's property forcefully taken, Temudjin vows to someday avenge his father and murder Tergutai.

At around this time, a young boy named Jamukha (Amarbold Tuvshinbayar) rescues Temudjin from the desolate cold of the mountains. The two decide to become blood brothers, and right away you can sense the inherent tension in such a union; the cutting of flesh and the spilling of blood is a painful yet deep commitment to someone. Watching the boys drink bowls of milk laced with each other's blood, I sensed something more sinister was lurking on the horizon. You can tell this is true when Jamukha says that someday he'll be Khan and Temudjin will be his Second in Command. Even at a young age, Jamukha sees this union not in terms of loyalty and respect, but in terms of power. What's really interesting is that Temudjin was most likely seduced by the same lust, considering his transformation into Genghis Khan. Consider the moment he goes to the Sacred Mountain to pray to Tengri, the God of the Blue Sky: a lone gray wolf appears, symbolic not only of Tengri, but also of destructive power.

The story eventually flashes forward to the year 1186, at which point a grown Temudjin (Tadanobu Asano) escapes enslavement and reunites with Borte (Khulan Chuluun), who has been longing for his return ever since the day they met. Despite the fact that they love each other deeply, they're constantly driven apart by battle--sometimes Borte is kidnapped while at other times Temudjin is forced to leave her so that he can fight. The theme of loyalty comes into its own at this stage of the story: while Temudjin and Borte remain devoted to each other, Temudjin and Jamukha (Honglei Sun) have now divided themselves. The idea of friends becoming enemies is certainly not new, especially in stories of civil war and bloodshed. There is, however, a subtlety to their downfall that I greatly appreciated, a slow and steady unraveling that made it all the more believable. I won't delve too deeply into this, but I will say that Temudjin's belief that generous leaders gain a larger following is a wise one. This is something Jamukha doesn't seem to understand.

Some viewers might be disappointed that Temudjin doesn't actually become Genghis Khan by the end of this movie; it's not about his reign, but about his rise to power. There's a reason for this: ""Mongol"" is the first part of an epic trilogy. There's really no way of knowing how accurate this story is, seeing as Genghis Khan has generally been remembered as a ruthless warrior. ""His history was written by his enemies,"" Sergei Bodrov said when interviewed, and I have no doubt that this is true. Many elements of the screenplay seemed to come straight out of a fable: a man who comes from nothing but gains everything; a woman who often finds herself in distress; a friendship that turns into a rivalry. It's hard to imagine something so formulaic being drawn from the pages of history.

This isn't to say that ""Mongol"" ever goes in the wrong direction. You watch this movie feeling utterly captivated by the story, the characters, and the look, all of which mutually benefit each other. Even the bloodstained battle scenes have a beauty of their own, albeit not in the conventional sense; slow motion shots of swords flying and blood spurting are expertly captured, pretty much to the point of seeming graceful. But at its core, ""Mongol"" is about the characters and how they love, hate, honor, and betray one another. As bland as that sounds, it actually helps a great deal because it allows today's audiences to relate to it, to understand why certain things happen. It's a shame virtually no one in the United States got to see this film a year ago, before it nominated for Best Foreign Language Film. It would have been wonderful to praise it along with the Academy.",1214179200,4,5501,4.762054507337526
3217779,4,B000WLYDNM,"In answer to reviewer ""Baitmann's Bat"" -- All history and all art is a lie in that it is a literary or visual construct.  Same with film.  Even documentaries must be interpreted and edited and framed.  There is no such thing as 'objective truth' for a human life.  This is a stirring epic. A huge visual treat. And a terrific story about an incredible human who really lived.  I think it has emotional truth and is worth seeing. Don't be misled by this reviewer.  Wait for the official U.S. release in theaters and on widescreen DVD.  It was sold out quickly and raved about at the Palm Springs International Film Festival.",1212451200,9,623,4.558558558558558
3217780,4,B000WLYDNM,"Mongul tells the story of Temudjin, the boy who grows up and eventually becomes Genghis Khan. At the age of nine, Temudjin's father(Esugei), the khan at the time, shows him how to pick a wife. After doing so, the plan is for them to get married in five years. After Esugei is poisoned however, he dies and the Mongols he was travelling with take matters into their own hands. Pillaging and doing whatever they see fit. Temudjin becomes a slave and sets out to find his brother, Jamukha, who he feels is the only one who can help him. A few years pass. Temudjin, now a man, sets off to claim his wife. He winds up going through a lot of hardships in the process, but what doesn't kill you will only make you stronger. It is said that all Mongols are afraid of thunder, but what if they don't have a place to hide? They become one of the greatest Mongols in history and greatness comes to those who take it.

This movie is shot beautifully. Every shot is filled with vibrant colors and seems to be shot in a unique way. There are quite a few first person perspectives during battle sequences that are quite stunning. Seeing the blood splatter all over the camera is always a plus, in my eyes. The battle scenes are where the film truly shines. The way they're shot make you feel like you're in the middle of it all. The perspective on a lot of the angles during not only the battle sequences, but in the movie as a whole, are impressive in their own right. The music also lends a helping hand in making this movie incredible. While some of it wasn't to my liking, the majority of it fit the film like a glove and only enhanced what was going on in the film and what the characters were going through.

The main reason I checked out this movie was because of Tadanobu Asano. I've mentioned my admiration of his acting in the past, but I had heard that this was possibly the most physical role he ever had. That peaked my interest. Well that and the fact that he was headlining the film. He definitely doesn't disappoint in this and he only seems to impress me more with each film I see that he's involved with.

Mongol may not be as action packed as the trailer leads you to believe. There are a handful of really impressive action scenes, but there's a lot of character development in this as well. The acting is top notch and as I mentioned, the visuals will have your eyes glued to the screen the entire time. I think the last twenty minutes or so make this film worth seeing alone. While it isn't action packed for two hours straight, I like to think that if you're a fan of movies like 300 then you'll probably enjoy this. This is just a bit more story driven.

3217781,4,B000WLYDNM,"Astonishingly, the name and the person of Genghis Khan in Sergei Bodrov's ""Mongol,"" a great, Shakespearean drama about this seminal figure in history, don't appear until the very end of the  two-hour epic. Instead, we see Temudjin, the man yet to become (posthumously) Khagan (emperor) of what was to be for several centuries the largest contiguous empire in history. Whether Bodrov completes the contemplated two additional chapters of the story or not, ""Mongol"" stands on its own as a masterpiece.

Contradicting the Western (and Russian) image of Genghis as the monstrous conqueror, Bodrov's work is influenced by Lev Gumilev's ""The Legend of the Black Arrow"" and is based on ""The Secret History of the Mongols,"" the 13th century Mongolian account, unknown until its re-emergence in China 700 years later. For a director, who learned in school only about the horrors of Russia's 200-year subjugation by the Mongols, taking a ""larger view"" is a remarkable act.

Unlike Omar Sharif in the 1965 Henry Levin ""Genghis Khan"" or Takashi Sorimachi in Shinichiro Sawai's disappointing 2007 ""To the Ends of the Earth and Sea,"" Tadanobu Asano in Bodrov's film  is strictly Temudjin, not the great Khan. He lived from 1162 to 1227, and ""Mongol"" covers the years between 1171 and the beginning of the unification of Mongolian tribes around the turn of the century.

In fact, the spookily powerful child Temudjin (Odnyam Odsuren) dominates the first part of the film, undergoing trials and tribulations that make the lives of Dickens' abused and imperiled children look like a picnic. From age nine into his 30s, Temudjin was orphaned, hunted, imprisoned, enslaved, and constantly threatened by extinction. Literally alone in the vast landscape (brilliantly photographed by Rogier Stoffers and Sergei Trofimov), Temudjin escapes death repeatedly, at times almost mysteriously.

""Mongol"" is huge - with endless vistas and epic crowd scenes, quite without special effects - but Bodrov keeps the setting just that, never strutting visuals for their own sake. The film is about people, and the cast is magnificent. Asano's face and eyes hold attention, and make the viewer experience simultaneous feelings of getting to know the character he plays and being held at arm's length. Bodrov and Asano escape all the many Hollywood pitfalls in making an epic - they present nothing easy, predictable, trite. The term ""Shakespearean"" is used here advisedly.

The Mongolian actors are sensational: Khulan Chuluun is luminous as Borte, Temudjin's wife; Borte's 10-year-old self, the girl who chooses Temudjin, then 9, while he thinks he is the one making the decision, is unforgettable, even if the name is hard to remember: Bayertsetseg Erdenebat.

Chinese actors are vital to the film. As Temudjin's father (poisoned by Tatars before the boy reached 10), Sai Xing Ga makes an impression few actors can achieve in such a brief appearance. Nearly overshadowing Asano is the grand thespian exercise from Sun Hong-Lei, as Temudjin's all-important blood brother Jamukha. Sun is almost too big for the big screen, perhaps a less intense performance would have served the film better.

Another problem is near the end of ""Mongol,"" with Borte's stranger-than-fiction (and actually fictional) rescue of Temudjin from a Tangut prison, years, hundreds of miles, and impossible alliances and dalliances telescoped into a few near-incongruous minutes - all to cover a 10-year-long gap in Genghis' history. Except for that, however, Bodrov's work is engrossing, spectacular, and memorable.",1211500800,7,3554,5.332142857142857
