8395358,2,B003E51VVA,"The anime is a five star anime and one of my all time favorites. But, I want to warn people, this is one of the worst quality DVDs I have EVER seen. The footage goes completely out of focus. You'll be watching a scene and half way through a sentence it will be so blurry that if it had lasted longer then it did I would have gotten a headache. If this happened only once or twice I would have forgiven it. But it happens 2 or 3 times an episode! I don't know if the complete box is different or not, but both Collection 1 and 2 that I got were like this.",1426377600,,554,3.8684210526315788
8395359,4,B003E51VVA,"La Corda D'Oro - primo passo is a positive and uplifting story that has elements of romance, but the real heart of the story revolves being true to yourself and finding a way to express that in a way that positively impact those around you.  Another element that is addressed - not letting unpleasant experiences and past disappointments hold you back from being all that you can be.

Completely devoid of ecchi and appropriate for all ages, though probaby 6th grade and up will get more out of this well done production.

4 stars means I really like it, but there are other animes that for a variety of reasons I would say are better.

A five star anime with music as its central theme would be Nodame Cantabile which has a more sophisticated plot and far more developed charcacters. However, Nodame Cantible has more mature themes and is not appropriate for younger kids.",1419552000,,873,4.64935064935065

8395362,5,B003E51VVA,"It really teaches you to understand music more. I know a little bit about music, but this anime made me fall in love with music once again.",1354492800,,139,4.185185185185185
8395363,5,B003E51VVA,"*This DVD set (""Collection 1) is the first set of 2.  This contains the first 13 episodes of the series.  ""Collection 2"" has the rest of them.  I'll be reviewing the series as a whole...not just up to episode 13*

FOR THE PARENTS: First, allow me to start with content issues since parents may or may not be looking for a new film for their young sons or daughters, and such is a concern for them...especially with a lot of anime, you don't always know what you are getting. There is no fanservice or provocative material (visually or otherwise), there is no foul language neither, there is nothing about conspiracies and darker topics...it really is a film more about music and relationships, and friends...but especially music.

MOVING ON:
This show takes place in a school that happens to have a strong performing arts emphasis. In fact, the school is divided into two sides (or form of studies I should say): the General Studies students, and the Music Students. One day, because of peculiar events beyond her control, a General Studies student finds herself competing in a music festival in which MOST of her competitors are seasoned Music Students. And the fun begins...naturally :-)

This show is a much lighter fare than, say, ""Nodame Cantabile (anime)"", ""Mr. Holland's Opus"", and ""Beethoven Virus"". But it really shines in it's own unique way, and definitely adds much to the musical dialogue...both to educators and musicians. To be honest, the setup really mimics a genre of anime called ""reverse harem"" (one girl with tons of guys after her favor), but the thing is, it is kind of a mistake and misleading to assume it as that (which was good for me, because I don't care much for the ""harem"" genre). The only reason I overstepped my ""initial fears"" about it being a ""harem"" show was because of it's realistic, yet magical approach to music and musical studies which remained a prominent theme through out...albeit the key theme. My instincts were spot on this time, and I finished it. Good thing, too, because this was one more excellent music title for my ""library"" and one more musical inspiration.

As a musician, it really gave me much to think about: Issues about practicing, endurance, creativity, career and love for it. It showed me both the sadness of lost opportunities and brilliant rebirths. But some of the biggest things I gleaned from this exceptional series is how a single person learning to love music can influence those around. How a single person can bring out the best in people (and musicians) and remind them why they do what they do. It was especially phenomenal how the lead character made classical music relevant and very intimate for herself...how she began to understand many of the composers and/or musical content through experiences in her own life. She even inspired me to continue with the viola, even though other instruments were easier (though I must say, she's a much, much faster learner than I am haha). So, is there romance? Definitely, but it's an inspiring romance of music that can warm the hearts of all who watch...and a welcome freshness :-)

By the way, always watch the segments after the end credits.  There are little treats and plot progressions.

SPECIAL FEATURES:
Nothing really, just a textless opening/closing clips plus some trailers for other shows and movies.

DUB VERSUS SUB:
Well, there's no debate here.  It only carries the Japanese audio with English subtitles.  It is important to note that the subtitles are very well done...but on at least one instance there was a very slight typo.  Still, nothing major at all, I even almost missed it.",1344729600,,3618,4.8522727272727275

8395365,4,B003E51VVA,My daughter she is 12yrs. and she loved this dvd and really so did I. It's a wonderfull movie about hope and not giving up and to practice to make you better and also how to cope with nice and not so nice people. But mostly we all liked it.,1283212800,4,240,3.82
