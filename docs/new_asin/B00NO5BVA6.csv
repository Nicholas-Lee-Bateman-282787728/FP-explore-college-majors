8679452,5,B00NO5BVA6,"If you loves 80's rock music and early Whitesnake, you should consider having this Whitesnake dvd in your home library.  This concert was recorded in 1984 during the band's Japan tour. What this dvd a treat is the late Cozy Powell's fantastic drum solo.  He was a very talented drummer whose life was taken so soon. Also for Deep Purple fans, there is a clip of the late Deep Purple boards Jon Lord's final performance as a member of Whitesnake.",1493510400,,445,4.55

8679457,3,B00NO5BVA6,"It depends on what type of fan you are. I purchased this just to get some good footage of Cozy Powell. The drum sound is HORRENDOUS..The snare sounds like a little old mans knees knocking together. No cymbals either. This isn't Coverdale's fault. I suppose it's great for some because it was an important era. I am disappointed with this release. I wonder were the 83 Donnington Park footage with Marsden is?
Video quality is good an over the era. It's a good performance by Coverdale but the guitar and drum sounds are very weak.",1416787200,2,530,4.589473684210526
