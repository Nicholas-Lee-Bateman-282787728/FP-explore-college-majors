7954550,5,B00005UBKI,All of the music on this DVD is good and is complete with a mashup of abstract visuals.  Nice to have in the collection.  Good and enjoyable.,1230940800,,141,4.185185185185185
7954551,5,B00005UBKI,"This is the best movie to trip to I have come across yet. I sat for the whole hour and a half with the most intense feelings of joy and  wonder. Each scene seems to have an overall message of unity. -many, many brain orgasms.",1129420800,3,225,4.0
7954552,1,B00005UBKI,"music: generic fluffy trancey wallpaper and preset jungle beats, completely forgettable. here and there some of the ambient parts were nice, then right back into canned beats.

visuals: ten or twenty years ago this might have blown me away. now it looks like a teenager got a DV camera for his/her birthday and a bunch of speed and decided to make a random spew of unremarkable imagery. totally random, no flow whatsoever, just spastic, flailing about like a fish on the sand. perhaps 5% of the imagery was worth seeing again, but that's hardly worth sitting through the rest of it. in this age of easy access to powerful tools, there's no excuse for putting amateur stuff like this on DVD. keep looking.",1105056000,,704,4.723577235772358
7954553,4,B00005UBKI,"It is nice to listen and the images are cool to see them in a ""good state of mind"" something that should be improved is to put all continous tracks.",1045526400,,148,3.966666666666667
7954554,3,B00005UBKI,"As a video, I expected much more. The visuals are too repetitive and seem to be just thrown together. There is way too much use of the ""zoom around a single frame"" effect in order to fill time. With that said, it is still a fun experience and some tracks are good, but it could have been awesome if they spent more time on it.
 As an audio-dvd, the music fares better. I often listen to this DVD through my stereo while just hanging around the apartment or cleaning.
 This is a great idea, but somewhere it has to have been done better..",1040169600,4,537,4.203883495145631
7954555,4,B00005UBKI,"I like the idea behind this DVD. Most of the music on this DVD was Drum -n- Bass. I'm not a big fan of such music, but the visuals were very good. I normaly like digital grafix, but this had a lot of movment and will work well as avideo back drop in a club enviornment.",1018137600,,269,3.8214285714285716
7954556,4,B00005UBKI,I bought this DVD for playing at my party...it was excellent...the music and videos were both awesome. I recommend!,1018051200,,115,5.105263157894737
