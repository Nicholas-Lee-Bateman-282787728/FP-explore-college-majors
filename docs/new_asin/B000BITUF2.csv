2417989,5,B000BITUF2,"Perhaps the very best documentary on any subject ever produced...a gargantuan, incomprehensible effort, amassing a haunting and romantic archive of original film footage, photographs, print, vintage cartography, and priceless commentary by various cultural luminaries and historians.  Spellbinding from first episode to the last...I found myself not wanting it to end.  The series presents a broad tapestry of New York's history with an emphasis on the indomitable and resilient human spirit above all else.  Ric Burns succeeds with a definitive masterpiece and tribute to New York in a unique style that captures one's imagination while tugging at the heart.  If history had been taught with this medium when I was in school, it would have made the difference between passing marginally or with excellence.  This DVD set is a treasure and one which I will revisit again and again. I highly recommend the amended version with 8 DVD discs, including the final post-9/11 disc.",1225756800,53,974,5.339869281045751
2417990,5,B000BITUF2,"As a lover of both film and history, this is undoubtably the best documentary I've ever seen. I was awed at Ric Burns ability to make the city a living breathing character with as much trials and tribulations as any great character in history. At times I forgot I was watching a documentary, because I was so dramatically tuned into the story.

With ample time devoted to it's many evolutions, each chapter is both informative and facinating. I have watched the entire series many times, and I am always amazed at how emotionally moving the legacy of this great city really is.

For the record, I have never been to New York, but I feel I will have a tremendous historic and cultural insight, when I eventually do.",1221868800,14,714,4.5703125
2417991,5,B000BITUF2,"This is the definitive gift for anyone who loves New York City.  The series is presented in easily digestible pieces and all the episodes draw you into a period in NYC's history and give you a good understanding of what makes the City so unique.  The final episode, about the building and the destruction of the World Trade Center, will touch your heart as well as your mind.",1211500800,40,375,4.5
2417992,5,B000BITUF2,"My dad has always been a huge history buff. When I moved to New York a few years ago, he became very interested in the history of the city, it's subways, etc. This past Christmas, I bought this collection for him. My father, who can't sit through a movie longer than an hour without falling asleep, watched the entire collection over the course of a week and is now watching other Ric Burns collections. Now, both dad and I know more about my new home and I have a running order for next Christmas!",1202428800,14,498,4.308510638297872

2417995,5,B000BITUF2,"If you are interested in a thorough but entertaining history of New York City this is as good as it gets. Ric Burns provides plenty of details but doesn't forget that part of the reason viewers are watching is to have some fun too. Eight DVDS may seem like too much but with a city like New York it is surprising how quickly the show passes by, this collection is large enough to give you a serious history of the topic without getting too complicated. If you are looking for a travel guide to NYC this isn't for you, if you are a sports fan look elsewhere, don't expect a guide to theatre or restaurants either. This DVD set is meant as a visual history course of America's, if not the world's, most fascinating city.",1130544000,149,718,4.325925925925926

2418014,5,B000BITUF2,"The depth and breadth of this documentary series is nothing short of amazing. It's like watching the birth of our country - the good, the bad and the ugly. It's so untarnished. The photos and footage are amazing. I've never seen anything like this. I view this as a history course. Truly a must-see. It can be harrowing. There were times I needed a break. But it draws you in nonetheless.",1514592000,,388,4.47887323943662
2418015,5,B000BITUF2,As a New Yorker this documentary  Blew me away. 75% was new revelation to me. I considered myself a NYC historian before this film.,1513728000,,131,4.458333333333333
2418016,5,B000BITUF2,"Loved,loved, loved it ALL.  The narration, dialog, music, historical detail, photos, film, drawings, EVERYTHING.  I have watched each episode only one time, but I will definitely watch it again.  I've been telling my son who recently moved to NYC about it and he is fascinated by some of the history I have shared with him.",1513123200,,323,4.836363636363636
2418017,2,B000BITUF2,"Oscar Wilde once said: ""I'm sorry for writing a long letter; I didn't have the time to write a short one."" The film spans seventeen hours and is utterly unorganized. Constructing the narrative strictly alongside the historical (instead of thematic) line lumps several unrelated stories together, while stretching other stories over several episodes (Robert Moses' story, for example, spans over three episodes with much redundancy). The narration is full of pathos and fairy superficial; a plethora of superfluous talking heads, saying very little of substance and telling me how I should feel about a particular moment in history. It's mostly about NYC, the Metropolis (and it is fascinating). But where are the people? Wha happened to that boiling melting point, the diverse cultures making the city? If you are looking for the people and the cultures of New York over the centuries, you won't find them here. This is mostly an unabashed homage to the material civilization of NYC (advanced by a bunch of white people). The Dutch are mentioned, naturally, and so are the British. The Irish get a word during the draft riots. African-Americans are mentioned, though briefly, as well. And the list ends here. The social fabric of the city and the cultures get lost in the process.",1512259200,,1280,5.071090047393365

2418019,5,B000BITUF2,"To be honest, I was only interested in the last chapter. The old history isn't all that interesting to me. However, the segment on the WTC I've watched numerous times. David Odgen Stiers and the music in the background is perfect.",1510012800,,230,4.634146341463414

2418043,5,B000BITUF2,"We are ordering our second copy! A wonderful gift to give to anyone, especially those with ties to NYC. My husband grew up in Brooklyn, so this is of great interest to him. I grew up in Los Angeles, but, even so, can see that NYC became the model and lessons (good and bad) for all cities. Make sure you buy the version that includes 9/11 as some only go to 2000. This series offers the viewer greater understanding of American history as the city developed displaying its resiliency and power to overcome economic ups and downs. I would recommend it for viewing to families and schools. In addition, this series is helping me to understand more the personality of President Trump and the city he comes from, a city where its strength is found in the diversity of its people, rather than money. Perfect viewing for these trying times! Thanks to all who had a part in its making.",1504915200,,878,4.49375

2418067,3,B000BITUF2,"While this is interesting and I have enjoyed what I've watched so far, the over the top gushing about New York has been a bit off putting.  They tend to ignore anything that might show NYC in a negative light, or they mention it, gloss over it, and move on.  They also tend to make it sound like it was New York that made the USA and that no other place really contributed.  The documentary needed some balance and realism in that regard. But if you can look beyond the self congratulating and over the top praise it is interesting and worth watching.",1501113600,,551,4.330097087378641
2418068,1,B000BITUF2,"Wow, they're so in love with A.Hamilton that they completely leave out VP John Adams. Not even a mention of Washington having a Vice President.

2418071,4,B000BITUF2,"It gets 5 (maybe 10) stars if compared to other historical accounts. For those unaware of the background, it brings the Erie Canal and the World Trade Center to life. I particularly liked the account of the wire walker, but it was painful for an acrophobic person to watch. The account of the horrific Triangle Shirtwaist Factory fire and similar events provide a perspective on the New Deal. Such accounts also provide interrsting insights into the development of the interstate highway system, urban ""renewal"" and many other things affecting the entire country.",1499990400,2,563,5.130434782608695
2418072,4,B000BITUF2,"Fascinating history, excellent interviews and visuals, sloppy soundtrack. The background music was just slapped on. It is inappropriate and a distraction at times.

2418074,2,B000BITUF2,"I only made it 11minutes.  Too many unnecessary 'best', 'most', etc, along with statements that apply to many other places, not just NYC, as they would have you believe.  Just silly NYC worship.  It IS a wonderful (and awful) city, full of amazing contrasts, but really, it needs some balance.  Plus it is from 2003, so kind of dated, esp as we hadn't had the financial crash of 2008, Wikileaks and what we now know about Wall Street, which seems to be worshiped here.  Can't listen to hours of that!  All Ric Burns' docs I have seen have been much better than this.  Hard to see his hand in it.",1497916800,3,595,4.3545454545454545

2418090,5,B000BITUF2,"No documentary of the sheer audacious immensity of this one will be without flaws.  The biggest is the sometimes painfully obvious and belabored effort of interviewees to find that ""lyrical"" sentence that  will make the final cut.  At times, you wish they would inform and leave the lyricism to our imaginations.  There were a few too many ""New York would never be the same agains"".  I occasionally found myself wishing the documentary would dry its eyes and give us just the facts, Ma'am.

But I can't remove a star.  It deserves the full five for bringing us from the native villages to the spires of lower Manhattan and tearing through history in immense detail but never without a sense of momentum.  And sometimes the lyricism is really affecting and memorable, as the account of Walt Whitman's reaction to the death of President Lincoln or the story of the composition of Emma Lazarus's paean to the immigrant.  It deserves five stars for the bit about the Eerie Canal alone.  I had no idea of the significance of the canal in the history of the city and indeed the history of the nation.  I should have, but I admit I didn't.  And the story of the Brooklyn Bridge.  And Al Smith.  And the Empire State Building.  And Robert Moses, his rise and fall.  And the knitting together of five boroughs.  And all the artists, poets, architects, scoundrels, bosses, thinkers, writers, criminals, journalists, activists, politicians, businessmen, and common Joes who made a city.

And at the end of it you are fully in the sway of this documentary's thesis, which is simply that there has never been a city in the history of humankind as interesting and as civilization-changing as New York.  I'll be a New Yorker for the rest of my life.  I've always been one.  And I've never done more than visit the city.",1494979200,9,1804,4.699680511182109

This video provides a wonderful history of NYC from its earliest beginning.  Nice to have a depth of knowledge of why it is the way it is today.  Powerful segments on the building of many NYC  icons (Brooklyn Bridge, Empire State Building, Central Park, Statue of Liberty, World Trade Center, Grand Central Station).

2418318,5,B000BITUF2,"At first the 10 episodes seemed like a bit much, but once you did into it and consider it covers 100's of years of New York history, it really just scratches the surface. I still don't know how they pick just a few anecdotal stories per episode to drive home the point of that historical segment, but I guess that's just the magic of Ric Burns and his team.  If you like long-form documentaries you can't go wrong, and if you have more than a passing interest in New York City history (like us) you'll absolutely watch it more than once.",1484697600,,537,4.316831683168317

2418419,3,B000BITUF2,"It's a decent documentary with some good information, but there is far too time spent with various talking heads waxing lyrical about just how unbelievably wonderful everything related to New York city is, along with attempts to explain why even some things that happened might seem negative, in fact, those things were really great too.  Once example of this that comes to mind is the guy who tries to convince us that the horrific Civil War draft riots were a good thing, because London and Paris had riots in their history, so by his ""logic"", having mobs of people going around killing innocent people and destroying property are the events that marked New York as a great city in the world.  I'm not saying all of the people who come on to add a little color are like this, but many are, and it got to the point where, when someone came on and started to go off about how wonderful he or she thinks some aspect of the city is, I started to fast forward until the person was off the screen, and it went back to actually talking about something meaningful and interesting.",1483660800,,1074,4.5025641025641026

2418489,3,B000BITUF2,"I chose to watch this series because I'm studying New York City in the late 19th century and hoped I'd end up with more meat than mouth. American Experience: New York, the documentary, has a theme so overpowering that details and facts are sparce. So what is the theme? The immigrants were so many and so smart and so amazing and so talented that New York would not have evolved as it did without them. Sure that's all true, but saying it once would have been quite enough.

Yes, yes, I learned a few things. Loved the photographs, early films, and stories here and there about historic characters like Boss Tweed.

What are examples of the details and facts yearned for? Well, how much did things cost, especially for low-wage workers and their families?  How did the horse-drawn vehicles differ from one another? What intercultural music and food brought people together? Where was the joy? There had to be more of it, at least on Sundays, even among the poorest of the poor.

Historic novels are giving me more what I want, e.g., The Alienist by Caleb Carr.",1481846400,,1060,4.622340425531915

It cements in my own mind that New York is one of our greatest cities that has repeatedly shown some of the worst of human-kind, and some of the best. It literally is one of our nation's finest examples of diversity, and Democracy.

Historical references such as Tammany Hall, Triangle Factory Fire, and the Draft Riots mean much more now to me.  The attitude of New York was brought forth in full display.  The last part of the final episode still touches raw nerves and is very disturbing.

2418551,3,B000BITUF2,"B/w 3 - 4 stars. There is an inkling of a slight negative slant (disproportionate to a balanced, objective presentation of America's history). It has a whiff of political revisionism to it. If you keep attuned to such and stay aware of the slight negative slant, it has some very redeeming qualities. (One of the intellectuals interviewed mouthed a Marxist notion that profit could be considered as little more than exploitation of the people - that kind of slant discredits so much about the presentation and ruins an otherwise educational documentary.)",1479254400,,554,5.0989010989010985

2418587,5,B000BITUF2,"Riveting. Provides a deep, interesting, and easily understood history of NYC, from its establishment through its various incarnations. The common thread throughout is NYC's position as a trade and business center, rather than as a religious haven, right from its beginnings. Each episode is dense with stories of how and why the City developed as it did.  And how its leaders dealt with the problems inherent in its huge population.

The 8th episode delves into the inception of the World Trade Center in the 1960s, the people involved, and its initially negative effect on the City after the towers were completed. Then acceptance and success, and then the terrorist attacks on 9/11.

I will no doubt watch each episode again.",1476662400,,727,5.041666666666667

2418597,5,B000BITUF2,"As an expatriated New Yorker, it was a real pleasure to watch, after 30 years of being away, such a well-researched in-depth exploration of what made (and still makes, for many of the same reasons) the Big Apple such a dichotomy of ""greatest city on earth"" and ""most demanding daily living experience on earth"". This city will always have a special place in my heart, but that place will always have a little shadow cast upon it. The reason? The sad reality that it has become too expensive for regular folks like my parents to make a decent life anymore. I LOVE to visit (in fact, I just did while in the midst of making my way through all of the episodes), and have done so dozens of times to show my kids born and raised in Virginia all the possibilities of life...but I would never live there again.
This documentary explains and analyzes much of that contradiction. Special mention - the episodes that focus on the great immigrant influx of the mid 19th through early 20th century. All of my grandparents were 1st generation Irish/Scottish and German immigrants. The descriptions of the hope, desperation, and finally acquisition (against horrible odds) of the American dream that these ""huddled masses yearning to breathe free"" experienced brought a lump to my throat. A testimony to the unbreakable human spirit.
Which, I guess, when all is said and done, is what New York is.

2418610,5,B000BITUF2,"Any history (NYC history, to be precise) enthusiast should love this series. Ric Burns does a great job of directing a very long, yet very interesting story on NYC's history, all the way back from the ""beginning"", when the Dutch discovered the land. Supposedly, the series was originally 7 episodes, and then the events of 9/11 took place, which prompted them to make the 8th episode, which is dedicated to the World Trade Center. Just like the previous 7 episodes on the history of NYC, this 8th episode covers the entire history of the World Trade Center.

I've tried to watch several other geographical history documentaries, and they tend to get slow and kind of boring, but not this. I've watched it several times... all 8 episodes. It's still GREAT.

If you have Amazon Prime, it's currently playing there, so you can stream it ""for free"" (requires the Amazon Prime membership, obviously). That can change at any time, so if it's still available there, do yourself a favor and get on that!",1475366400,4,995,4.77906976744186

From its inception as an arm of the Dutch East Indies company, New Amsterdam was destined to make its imprint on the American experience. From the trying times of the Revolutionary War, New York emerged as the trading and financial capital of this country. But its greatest achievement was the assimilation of millions of immigrants from all over the globe. They came HERE seeking a new and better life, and after a generation, their children found success and acceptance in their adopted homeland. The last section of the documentary was the hardest to watch...9/11 and how that event continued to reshape the indomitable spirit of New Yorkers who were forced to bend, but would NOT break...I concur in the belief that New York is the greatest city in this country.",1474329600,2,859,4.850340136054422

From the history of the buildings to Petit's wire walk (which I recall at age 13) to the unreal attack which seemed like an action movie.

Ric Burns covers the history of New York from the discovery through the current era. There are times when the pace is slow but those problems do not define the overall series. The editing could have been a little better but the content is still relevant despite the occasional slow pace.
The history is presented in the classic Burns family style with still photographs interspaced with monologs and the occasional movie clip. The episodes are divided around eras rather than strict timelines or world events. While events such as the Civil war and WWII have effects on the city and are reported, the episodes are divided according to events in the city.

Much of the series deals with immigration, economic growth (or the lack of it), development and the struggles that go with all of those issues.

I wish the editing had been a little more aggressive but it is still an OUTSTANDING series and well worth the time invested.",1473638400,,1046,4.704918032786885

2418696,2,B000BITUF2,"Coming from a Midwestern farming background, I found this documentary a bit 'over the top'.
I do agree that most of our social reform started in New York, mainly because of its large immigrant population.
But social reform was looked at in one light - the more the better. Which did not suit my sensibilities. My ancestors came and left for more wide open spaces. And the ones that came in the 1600's, developed what is now Maryland. So, a place that begins with commerce and is devoid of all other aspects of life, does not, I believe, deserve 18 hours of patting itself on the back. New York?

2418755,2,B000BITUF2,"I started this series in mid-stream with ""Cosmopolis,"" an account of New York City in the 1920s ... thinking that an era as rich and abundant in historical film footage and jazz music would shine in this massive documentary series.  I couldn't have been more wrong!

Rich Burns' ""New York/A Documentary"" is proving a tough and exhausting slog.  If the jazz age is proving this stultifying, how am I ever going to make it through the colonial Dutch, with no photos and no recordings to break up the ponderous and slow-as-molasses narration?

Honestly, how do you tell the story of jazz in New York City in the 1920s without including at least a few bars of actual music from the period?

This is less of a popular documentary and more of a college lecture series illustrated by slides.  The narration is terribly dense and over-written.  Burns relies almost exclusively on ""talking heads"" -- experts of various stripes who are permitted to drone on and on, talking over and obscuring more interesting film and audio footage of the era.  This series' mantra seems to be:  don't spend too much time learning from documentary evidence; let us tell you what it all means.  It's astounding a product like this made it past a competent editor; it is a massive effort to tell the entire history of New York City, yet because of its bloatedness, the dynamism and excitement of Gotham are smothered underneath a heavy-handed and weighty treatment that leaves the viewer gasping for air.

From one, 2-hour segment, I can tell this is going to be rough sledding.  It's ""War and Peace,"" PBS documentary-style, and it's not for the faint-of-heart.  Enter at your own risk!

Addendum:

Well, I made it!  I completed Episodes Six and Seven, taking me from the 1930s through the ""present"" (the present being pre-9/11 New York, since this Ric Burns series ends in 1999).

And it got better, and more endurable  testimony to the riveting scholarship of Robert Caro in Episode Seven's extended discussion of Robert Moses, which is fascinating.

I think two more episodes helped me to see both the strengths and the defects in this mammoth series on the history of the City of New York.  When it sticks to the facts, when it relies on the best archival footage available, the tale it tells is absorbing and moving.  But when it strays into moralizing, it becomes pedantic and, frankly, cloying.  There are still too many ""talking heads"" in this series willing to ""tell us what it all means"" when all that was necessary was to get out of the way and let the historical record tell the story of New York so much more effectively.  Without the discipline of more structure in its narrative and a more condensed overall size, this documentary remains bloated and excessively self-absorbed.",1464307200,,2764,4.797040169133193

2418764,3,B000BITUF2,"The New York Documentary by Ric Burns, while excellently researched and presented, lacks balance of opinion. As far as I could tell, all of the commentators had a liberal perspective on whatever they were commenting about. I was absolutely astonished by episode eight about the Twin Towers and 9/11 , when neither Rudy Giuliani nor George Pataki, who at the time were the mayor and governors of New York, respectively, were interviewed. Instead, we get commentary from Ed Koch and Mario Cuomo, neither of whom were in office at the time, but of course were Democrats so that's why their comments were put on the show instead. Also, omitted and an indication of the liberal bias of the whole presentation, was George Bush's visit to Ground Zero and his proclamation that the terrorists who performed this terrible attack would be hearing from all of us. Instead, we get a ridiculous complaint from the writer Pete Hamill about President Bush not rushing to the scene as soon as possible. At least Mr. Hamill praised Mayor Giuliani for being at the attack scene as soon as he could and again, it would have been nice to have heard Rudy Giuliani's comments. Another area of the program that lacked balance was the savaging of Robert Moses. It would have been nice to have heard some balancing comments about the good and progressive impact Moses had on New York instead of what the commentators regarded as the awful consequences of Moses' plans for modernizing the city. Overall, I thought the documentary was very informative and interesting. It would have been a lot better with a more balanced set of opinions.",1462665600,7,1611,4.840579710144928

2418882,3,B000BITUF2,"I think that why Ric and Ken Burns have done so very well with their giant tv productions is that they manage to take the mainstream, the traditional, the expected and already known and make it look so ravishing and seem new. For all its 18-hour sprawl and its undeniably gorgeous visual appeal, there's a kind on intellectual torpidity to this epic production that in the end doesn't reveal much of anything any student of New York history wouldn't already have known. Over and over and over it presents the standard experts giving their standard opinions and analyses, without challenge. New York's history -- any history -- is so much more messy and murky and fun and interesting and chaotic than this. Added to the stentorian tone is the Burnses' glacial pacing, which is meant to convey gravitas but might just put you to sleep instead. Nobody can sap the fun and vitality out of potentially exciting subjects the way the Burnses can. It's part of their signature. Like all their productions, this is beautiful to watch, but it won't provoke much thought.",1441238400,4,1060,4.797814207650274
2418883,5,B000BITUF2,"I would give it 6 stars.  I should have watched it with a pen and paper as now I want to go back and watch it again and retain everything I learned.
Fascinating to take 10 days or so to watch the whole thing as you go about your life and listen to our daily news.  Nothing has changed; people are still people and fall into the same patterns.  Watch this, be amazed and conscious of change! No more taking advantage of the little guy and needing to shop every second!",1441238400,,467,4.1098901098901095

2418900,3,B000BITUF2,"Essentially an overall interesting documentary of New York City. An ambitious project to undertake, to be sure.
The pacing is quite slow in a number of places and several stories feel incomplete in the telling.  More positively, it was beautifully photographed and the old pictures were evocative.  David Ogden Stiers, the Narrator, weaved the story poetic with his superb voice.  The other voices did bring a gravitas as well.
The City itself has so many facets beyond politics, construction and immigration to realistically contain itself to one documentary, even one of a nearly 20 hour length.",1439942400,,597,5.197916666666667

2418908,5,B000BITUF2,"This American Experience season on New York City is like a review of all of American history. The pivotal role played by America's largest city in so many triumphant and tragic events in our history becomes glaringly clear in this well-researched and superbly presented documentary. While lacking a bit of the nostalgia-evoking feel of a Ken Burns film, Ric Burns produced a film that is both informative and engaging. Some of the modern scenes of New York will feel dated (they were shot pre-9/11), but the history still stands on its own. The historians, writers and others interviewed give excellent insight into this very complicated and very American city. It's like a good reference book that you can pick up over and over again.",1439510400,,735,4.935483870967742

2418949,2,B000BITUF2,"Watching this series for the second time, I am struck by the lack of diverse points of view that Burns' relies upon to present a ""documentary"" of a dynamic driver of culture in the 19th and 20th century.

Particularly in the 20th century episodes, the anti-car, anti-urban development opinions pile up on Robert Moses without any other perspective point of view.

As a polemical vehicle for Burns, it succeeds beautifully. As a history of New York, it fails.",1435536000,2,458,4.858974358974359

NYC holds a particular place in our history and continues to draw crowds from around the world. This tells all of the stories of the development of the city in the early days, the Erie Canal, the grid system for streets, Central Park, skyscrapers, immigration, etc. There are many historical pictures and film, with great quotes from famous residents of NYC, including Walt Whitman and Alexander Hamilton. Great narrative comments from a talented group of historians and others adding color and life to each period.

One does not come away with a positive feeling.  It is a reminder that our history, the history of this country, is not always positive.  Good to be reminded that there has been much negative as well as positive.  It helps not to be too quick to criticize other countries that are having growing pains..

From the earliest Dutch settlers interested more in commerce than anything else, to the creation of Central Park, Ellis Island, the subways, state parks, roads - plus all the social issues - it is simply fascinating. I have been struck many times by how many issues then are still with us today. If American history were taught through programs like this, classes would be full.",1425945600,,447,4.670886075949367

For anyone not familiar with the world's greatest city this is a must. I can't decide which episode is best; I love them all. The last and the sad coda of the building and the demise of the WTC was great but definitely a bummer to watch as it marks the end of the city I knew and the beginning of 21st century nyc.

But much of the first episode was filled with talking head interviews of people who honestly believe that New Yorkers invented the idea of walking in a crowd or getting lost in your own thoughts.  I've lived half my life in NYC, half elsewhere and the talking heads may be shocked to hear that west of the Hudson there are crowds and eccentrics, too.",1425081600,6,516,4.468085106382978

It comes in eight segments, and the first seven were done from 1999-2001 and were completed before 9-11, so all the references that relate to the World Trade Center Towers are pretty eerie, as they speak unknowingly of what lay ahead in just a few number of months.  The last of the series was done in 2003, post 9-11, of course, and is fully on the Twin Towers, from conception in the late 1940s to the 9-11-2001 one-year anniversary in 2002.

One does not tell the history of a city with a bunch of talking head celebrity fiction writers and politicians raving about there home. I think there was one actual historian. And by the way, Indians are from India. They start off stating the name of the Native American tribe but then begin calling them ""Indians"".  It bounces around enough to give one whiplash. We begin with a bunch of local names raving about the current NY then bounce to Hudson discovering it, then back to current times, then to ""Indians"". There is no flow. No attempt at giving us the history first. As if the director didn't have faith in his subject matter.",1421366400,2,809,4.503401360544218

Most documentaries have way too much musical background and volume making the narrative and spoken descriptions of the content nearly indistinguishable and such a shame because that is what a documentary is intended to showcase, the story, the time period, the history or subject.

From the Dutch occupation, the French assisting in the English ejection, the tendering of the Subway to the Commissioning of the same in 4 years; this is a MUST watch for everyone that has an interest in history generally. You will not be disappointed!",1414022400,,401,4.583333333333333

2419230,5,B000BITUF2,"It's a good (and affectionate) history of New York and ends up being a history of the US at the same time. It's not the oldest city, by far no longer the biggest city, but its history, over a relatively short time (compared to Rome, London, Beijing, Paris) is very interesting. Complaints I've seen elsewhere about ""emphasis"" on ethnic & racial strife  are unfounded - it represents a healthy dose of reality - as is the news that many NYC movers & shakers wanted to side with the Confederacy. I do agree w/others that the narration sometimes is a little too ""breathless"" about every twist and turn in the city's fate and its impact on New Yorkers, but overall quality of the series makes it easy to forgive.

Overall, very satisfying - and the last episode, added as a tribute to the birth, life & death of the Twin Towers is beautifully executed.",1413849600,,848,4.5359477124183005
2419231,5,B000BITUF2,"My mother watched this series years ago when I moved to NYC for my first job in the US.  She bought me this Ken Burns documentary so that I'd appreciate the history of my new home.  The series takes you from the early years of New York's inhabitants to modern day NYC through stories of the important people, places, and events parcelling out information with just the right pace.  I felt that I was learning a great deal and enjoying every moment of it.  I've watched the series again, several years later and have discovered other parts more interesting to me now that I have gotten to know the City better.

This was one of the best gifts I've received.",1413676800,,656,4.433333333333334

2419261,5,B000BITUF2,Awesome!!!!!!!,1412121600,,14,14.0
2419262,5,B000BITUF2,"An extraordinary 8 part, almost 18 hour history of New York City; its politics, economics, architecture, and above all humanity, from the first arrival of white settlers. (I would have been curious to know more about the Native Americans who had been living there, but the focus is on New York as a city, which arguably started with the arrival of the Dutch).

I was born and lived the first half of my life in NYC, was always passionate and curious about it, and yet the program had so much fascinating information I didn't know  not only about the distant past, but the complex back-room city politics and policy decisions (some disastrously wrong headed, even aggressively racist) that were going on in my early years.

It's always lively, often touching and asks important questions about what makes a city and why they're so important -- as well as ""how can a city keep 'modernizing', but not lose it's soul?"" It also forced me to abandon some supposed ""facts"" I'd been brought up with as a New Yorker, like the idea that names of immigrants were commonly changed at Ellis Island.

The last episode, made after the rest of the documentary, is devoted entirely to the Word Trade Center; it's inception, it's building (and the complex, sometimes dark politics behind it), it's successes and failures as architecture and urban planning, and of course its horrifying demise. While it's the most emotional of the episodes, it does feel a bit apart from the others, spending it's entire length on one very focused subject. Not a problem, other than a bit of change in style.

If I had to nit-pick it would probably be the use of hyperbole in some of the narration. I lost count of how many crises were 'the worst
the city ever faced'. But that is a tiny fly in a ton of ointment.

The images, still and moving, are beautifully chosen (great seeing moving images from the turn of the century New York), the various expert talking heads are passionate and articulate, and I learned so much more than I expected, and often felt on the edge of my seat, as if I was watching drama, not history.

It's interesting that film-maker Ric Burns' brother Ken has received so much more attention. I find Ric's many documentaries often the equal ofKen Burns' work, and indeed sometimes find them more emotional.",1411689600,6,2296,4.696517412935323

I am assuming that Ric Burns is related to Ken Burns of ""Civil War"" fame.  If so, the gene pool is intact.  At the moment, my wife and I are devouring ""The Roosevelts"". I look forward to ""The War,"" ""Baseball,""Jazz"" and anything else the Burns clan comes up with.

Good insights on the individuals who built the city, it's growth,  and it's struggles.  And most importantly perhaps,  that history does in fact repeat itself.  The present day fortunes and challenges are cyclical. From immigrant to native, poverty to wealth,  the city has seem them before and will see them again.

New York City on the other hand is rich, living history hiding right under our noses.  This documentary brings out much of this history in a delightfully interesting way.  After viewing, I find it hard to walk around the city without recognizing important sites that fundamentally affected the way all Americans live today.  One example would be the Triangle Shirtwaist fire of 1919, which could be described as the 911 of its day.  146 young women jumped to their death because the exit doors on the 8th floor factory were all locked from the outside.  Fire exit laws from Main to California resulted from this historic event - and the building is still standing one block off of Washington Square.  Or the integral role New York played in opening up the west.  This documentary will change the way you look at the city.",1403654400,3,957,4.7926829268292686

I would highly recommend this series to anyone who is interested in American history or just wants to know more about New York.  If you have never been to New York and are planning to go, this is a must-see video that will make your visit so much richer.  Even if you are a native New Yorker, there are things that you will learn about your own city that will astonish you.

There is so much more history, graft, tragedy, EVERYTHING that has happened there. From the 1st siting of the island through the terror at the Twin towers, I have finally understood WHY New York has not only been 1 of the most important cities in the country, but in the world. Both the good and the bad that has been put together in this series. I found the city to be such a paradox with a vitality that I had never before understood. I highly, highly recommend this series to all history buffs.",1401926400,,653,4.5423728813559325

On my upcoming trip to NYC, I will have a much greater understanding of the city and how it evolved into what it is today. I learned so many things I didn't know.

Expansive, historical information presented in a way that reminds you that real people were involved in making real decisions about every detail of what was to become 'our past' ... our history.  The 'experts' are compelling, the footage is transporting.  In particular, you will never forget the stories about the building of the Erie Canal and the tragedy of the Triangle Shirtwaist fire.  And although each of the historians who sit down to consider and reflect upon the information presented here are wonderful, Robert Caro's vocal inflection, in particular, reveals a tone of care and emotional content that will make you feel that he considers himself to be directly related to each and every human being that has suffered at the hands of tragedy.

It gives you insight not only what was going on in New York and how New York developed, but how the whole country developed and who were the major political players.  I wish the producers would do other documentaries like this on Chicago, Boston, Washington, etc.  It is so important to understand and get a perspective of how specific historical events affected the direction of the country.

2419710,4,B000BITUF2,Starts strong but turns a bit overly hagiographic. Many things that were common contemporary phenomenon in American and other major cities are presented with an overdone sense if awe and self congratulation. But it is mostly excellent. The treatment of Robert Moses and urban renewal is simply outstanding as is the post 9/11 addendum on the World Trade Center.,1394841600,,361,5.135593220338983

I'm not finished with it yet.  I've been watching it backwards and have three more sections to go.  If you love New York you must see this.  No it's not a restaurant guide or sports guide.

In other words, they put New York's history in context.
I have one, relatively small, negative. The ponderous music played incessantly throughout grew tiresome. This is hardly a condemnation though, just a very small irritant.

2419721,5,B000BITUF2,"I am a huge fan of the more known Burns family member and his documentary style, but Ric Burns' American Experience: New York series ranks right up there with the best of them.  The series goes through the history from the time of the earliest Dutch explorers and trade post origins up through the post 9/11 aftershocks (in an episode that was created after the first episodes were completed in 1999).  This provides stunning visuals of the history of New York and its outer buroughs, the growth of the city, as well as the change experienced within America following NYC's lead.
I am currently watching the full series a second time and anticipate that I will revisit the full series again, as I pick up on specific tidbits that I happen to miss on prior views.

2419731,5,B000BITUF2,"Just a short review: this is a fantastic introduction to the History of New York up through 9/11. The visuals and the narration are arresting and captivating. I especially enjoyed how Burns incorporated the words of Walt Whitman and F. Scott Fitzgerald into the narration. I emphasize, however, that this is an overview -- no documentary can do justice to the complex and multi-faceted of this great city. But don't let the nay-sayers deter you from viewing/buying this set: it is unique and eloquent.

Please note that this version has all eight current episodes, include the added episode which focuses on the history and fall of the Twin Towers. The focus on 9/11 is not overwhelming, however. Much attention is given to Philippe Petit's cross-tower scaling of the World Trade Center. It's a poetic moment that helps to counterbalance the horrors of September 11, 2001.

I understand that Burns is preparing a ninth episode. We shall see...",1392940800,,943,5.0

Advise looking at one segment each day or week. Otherwise you might miss a jewel unless you have a capacity to absorb and share quickly. You might hit the pause button and talk small segments over to do it justice, to learn, to apply. Headed to New Hampshire Sunday where Ken Burns dine. Might tell him to move over one seat and let Ric have a place at the table. Just kidding. Ric learned from Ken and he learned very well indeed. You can see the skill and the art of the
presentation while watching the story itself.  But the last tribute goes to the people and the continuing experiment we call New York.

There is a lot here I did not know, which is not surprising since I have only been there a few times. The program explores both the personalities that helped shape NY, especially Alexander Hamilton, and the evolution of the city itself; how it became less concerned with its own history than with its continued commercial progress.",1391126400,,503,4.5777777777777775

I however do not give give it 5 stars not based on the content but because the version that amazon has available for streaming is very badly cut the screen aspect ratio. When the names of the people in the documantary shows up they ar cut off outside the screen. Which means the picture itself is cropped very very badly.

2419795,4,B000BITUF2,"It's a great story, especially the story of early New York and it's creation into the industry leader in the world.

Notably missing was New York's role and what happened there during the revolution,  how we almost
lost Washington's army in Manhattan, the racism during the Civil War and the riots.

Nothing about the ""Scattered Sites"" controversy and how John Lindsey took Federal Money earmarked
for providing affordable housing for the poor, and started the gentrification of the East Side, initially building
Lincoln Center, Fordham Manhattan Campus, huge luxury housing apartments while displacing ""Hell's Kitchen""
a working people's community.  This created a movement throwing vast numbers of people out of their housing
continuing up town and undoubtedly will continue.

Nothing about Ed Koch's rein, just an interview after 2001.  Similarly, nothing about Juliano's expulsion of
porn,  crime, and even homeless from Manhattan, while abandoning a huge population of people.

Still great but with 8 shows a lot is missing.  So many references to Tammany Hall, but not one picture or
person to place with it.",1388102400,,1114,5.32

2419801,4,B000BITUF2,"Very good overall.  However sometimes it is a bit too NYC centric as when the people interviewed refer to NYC as the intellectual and cultural capital of the US.  The city has some good universities to be sure, but it is not the birth place of say Silicon Valley or Microsoft in Seattle.

Tom Wolfe's Hooking Up has an interesting history of Silicon Valley tracing its roots to Robert Noyce at Grinnel College in Iowa in the late 1940's.",1387584000,,437,4.506329113924051

Another way of saying this is each episode exceeded expectations. The historians and writers that commented on a particular part of NY history were very focused on the time, and their comments very illuminating. I also appreciate how it is broken down into specific time periods and does not stray into other time periods. When I was watching different episodes I would ask family members not to interrupt if possible since the shows move somewhat quickly. I think any school would do well by its students to use this series as a teaching tool or augmentation. THe economic impact analysis in many of  the segments is brilliant. I could go on, but, I think I have carried on enough.

2419836,5,B000BITUF2,"A  fabulous  historical  presentation  with  illustrations  for  the  very early  years ,  photos  ( once  the  camera was invented )  and  of  course  film .
This  is  not  some  bland  bla  bla  bla  with  history  data  but  a  rather  engaging  presentation  of  the  story  with  interviews  from  a  variety  of  people .
I  personally  was  grateful  that  Burns  had  pulled  together  so  much  film  because  it  is  far  more  effective  as  a  learning  tool  than  text  books .
It  also  gives  a  very  real  look  at  the  1800s  and  early  1900s  when  New York  was  not  just  a  town  full of  well  to  do  yuppies .
The  Triangle  Shirt  fire  and  back story  are  also  very  well presented . (  as  is  Robert  Moses'  career )
All in  all ,  there  is  way  too  much  to  cover  in  a  review  BUT
If  we  had  films  like  this  in  high  school ,  more people  would  Not  be  history  dummies !

2419843,5,B000BITUF2,"I've seen the entire series, ""New York - Directed by Rick Burns,"" many times - the reason for this purchase was simply updating from VHS to DVD.  Granted, the prospect of watching a 171/2 hour portrait of New York City sounds on the surface a bit daunting even for American History buffs but, (for me,) the combination of stunning visuals, splendid prose read so beautifully by David Ogden Stiers underscored by Brian Keane's atmospheric music makes for perfect video viewing.  Best wishes to all those who made it possible.",1380153600,9,524,4.876404494382022
2419844,5,B000BITUF2,"I would not have seen this documentary if not for Amazon free videos.  I love it! I was working full time in 1999 when it originally came out and not watching much tv because I didn't have the time. I am retired now and always

2419848,5,B000BITUF2,"This is a brilliant documentary in its own right as far as documentaries go.
Well researched with great commentary from academics covering the history of New York from its beginnings until the present day.
The music and visuals make it thoroughly watchable. If you are fascinated by New York this is THE one to get.
 The price can fluctuate up to $100 but regularly comes down - so wait until it's hits the $48 mark - which is what I paid for it.",1379635200,,446,4.373493975903615

2419850,5,B000BITUF2,"This is an excellent series, particularly if you are from the New York metro area. I'm learning some really surprising and interesting things. Generally what is so poignant is how much strife and suffering went on in the early days.

My only caveat to those considering viewing this is that there are parts that are really dragged out, made worse by a couple of really verbose commentators. You will know then when you hear them.",1379462400,,429,4.72
2419851,5,B000BITUF2,"NY Doc was made over a decade ago yet the way it was made surpasses any documentary that I have ever viewed (and believe me, I am a doc buff at heart). It is poignant, near-perfect accurate and most of all very entertaining yet informative. I had recommended it all of my friends and associates. My favorite is volumes 5 thru 7. The last one is especially touching as it tells us the heart wrenching story of the late-great WTC and the harrowing events of the day that should never be forgotten. If you have not viewed New York: A Documentary Film, I strongly recommend that you do. It not only tells the history of one of America's greatest cities, but tells the story of a great nation that received the best contributions (both good and bad) from the people who made New York a true American Pride.",1379203200,2,801,4.418918918918919

Rick Burns, Ken's brother borrows many of his techniques  from the Civil War documentary but with much more video clips and pictures from the 19th and early 20th century.

I would like to have seen more about the removal of the hills and the flattening of Manhatten.  Also I didn't like how some of the interviewees denegrated some of the rest of the country in order to make New York seem superior.

It shows the good things that have happened there along with the ugly and is engaging the whole time. It does go slow in parts and repeats some of the same music but still moves. Probably my favorite documentary of all time.,1376784000,,356,4.578125

2419936,2,B000BITUF2,"I really enjoyed some of this -- the photography, the quotes, the depth -- there were some great moments.  I recommend it for mature audiences who want to get a visual sense for the history of NYC.

However, viewers must be aware that there is way too much editorializing.  There is a lot less of the history of NYC and more of a polemic than one might expect, making large parts of the video insufferable.

Nearly everything is presented from the narrow perspectives of race and class differences -- surely those existed, but to posit that those conflicts are the heart and sole of NYC is way, way off the mark.  Worse, landmark achievements by great New Yorkers are given short shrift and are immediately dismissed as irrelevant in light of the fact that there were many more who were not successful and did not thrive.

Trying to rewrite history in order to put forth a political agenda is unethical, as naive viewers will likely be unable to distinguish the producers opinions from fact.",1373328000,2,991,4.666666666666667

  why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because of the spineless and politically correct spin on how to conveniently not mention  ( in the last episode )  WHO invaded us by flying planes into the World trade towers.  Oh how I sat there , longing for at least  1 commentator to mention Who !  Who Mr. Rick Burns flew those planes into our buildings.

I remember the phrase ""Tammany Hall"" during high school American history, but whatever else the teacher may have explained didn't stick.  In this documentary, I could feel the immigrants' plight and understand their reaching out for governmental help.  The interplay between power and monetary influence was quite clear.  I found the final episode's retrospective on the World Trade Center especially moving.  It contained quite a bit of footage that I had never seen before of the unfolding events of 9/11.",1371945600,,688,4.991228070175438

2419945,5,B000BITUF2,"If you like the style of documentary filmmaker Ken Burns then you'll love this exploration of New York City.  The style is familiar to anyone who has seen the Civil War, Jazz, Prohibition, Baseball, etc., meaning that there are panning camera shots of static photos, multiple layers of sound and narration by a cadre of people familiar with the subject.  Absolutely excellent and exactly to my taste.

New York is not normally thought of as a particularly ""historical"" place, but NY is the cradle of the American story. I recommend this to all of my friends.

2419997,5,B000BITUF2,"..except the end. I have to admit I could not bring myself to see the 9/11 (last episode) of the series, which looks like it was made a couple of years after the fact. So, full disclosing, I can only rate the previous episodes.

If you enjoy history and New York City history, you'll take a lot away from this series. The very fact that the show spans so many centuries means the visuals change from paintings to still photography to movies to video - which is amazing to watch.

My only beef is with the last episode I watched, which fast tracked history from WWII to 2000. After the mid-seventies bankruptcy, the series flew thru the 80s and 90s. As someone who lived in NYC from 82-89, I was most looking forward to this recent history. Stories like the revitalization of Times Square by Disney, the upswing of neighborhoods like Soho and the East Village - these were stories worth telling, in my opinion.

There's a companion book to this series available which I am interested in checking out.",1364688000,,999,4.538888888888889

2419999,5,B000BITUF2,I love NYC and thought this was the perfect kind of documentary for anyone who wants to know about the history of it. It flows really nicely and not a lot of stuff that drags out too long. One thing that should be mentioned is really this is a documentary about Manhattan and a very small tad of Brooklyn. Not much is made of the other boroughs. Now that is ok and I totally understand it but if there was one thing I'd recommend to the creators if I could it would be to devote maybe one of the dvds to the other 4 boroughs as NYC is more than just Manhattan and a lot of history took place in Brooklyn/Bronx/Queens/Staten Island as well and a lot is there to be shown.,1364169600,,670,4.083333333333333

2420015,5,B000BITUF2,"Maybe it's the musical score, but this series has a lugubrious undertone to it. It's thorough in its depiction of New York from the time of Dutch settlement up to the '90s and doesn't back away from New York's ugly episodes, from the draft riots of the Civil War, to the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory fire and the resulting horrendous deaths of the workers. Sometimes it's a bit hard to watch, but I enjoyed it and will probably watch it again at some point. The score really is haunting and not what I expected (I was expecting music that was brash and exuberant), but it fits this documentary series very well. It's not all bright lights, glamor and Broadway shows in the big city. This series focuses on the people who make the city run, as well as on those who run it. I think history buffs, and those like me who love New York, will enjoy this documentary series.",1361836800,,866,4.452830188679245

Unfortunately, Episode 5 would never play, constantly sending a low signal message, despite all the other episodes playing seamlessly at the same time.  That said, this is a wonderful story of the history of New York, albeit one with a strong social agenda.  While I do not fault the emphasis on the simultaneous rise of New York with the rise of slums and poverty, the documentary skips many significant movements, like the conception and building of art museums and a even a cursory treatment of Central Park.  I suppose the greatest compliment to Ric Burns is that he has whet our appetites for films on the architecture of New York and the history of its parks and neighborhoods.  Unfortunately, there are no similar documentaries to fill in the gaps.  The most pointed criticism is that the film could be edited down considerably as there was much repetition, perhaps so episodes could stand on their own.

The narrative unfolds in waves as the skillfully told story emerges, moving forward, and then re-starting again, over and over, as we digest the huge story of the building of these skyscrapers at a time when they were not really wanted or needed. Great footage of the early years. The towers were certainly well photographed over time so there is no shortage of great pictures. The quixotic tale of the tightrope walker provides the highlight before the dark story of 9/11 begins to unfold. Many of the talking heads get quite emotional. Mayor Ed Koch is especially heartbreaking on the tale of a young woman lost in the collapse. Watch if you are mesmerized by NYC.",1359590400,,870,4.69281045751634

New York is a fast-paced, chaotic and funny place, but none of these qualities comes through in this pious, windy textbook of a film.  The wit his brother Ken was able to capture in Baseball and Jazz is nowhere to be found.  If locals and visitors were asked to pick New York's most prominent feature, one word you'd hear again and again is ""energy"".  Paradoxically, Burns' attempt to portray the city has barely any.

I watched this series because of the pictures and the history - which there was far too little of.  The comments are made by writers, and not great pro-freedom writers, let me tell you.  Many of them were incomprehensible. Walt Whitman and F. Scott Firzgerald were given entire episodes to blather on.  You have to turn the sound off sometimes.  Then you see happy people who are glad to be in New York but when you hear the pitiful narration, you could get depressed.

This series could have been so good if Burns had used good historians and actual New Yorkers to tell its history.  He obviously had an adgenda, to show that capitalism does not work and that we need the state, even though corrupt to take care of us.  What a bunch of malarky.

It is hard to imagine any American viewing this and not feeling a part of the story, if only because most of our ancestors came here from the rest of the world.  Beautifully written and photographed, not one moment is wasted.

2420057,1,B000BITUF2,"If you are liberal and/or a Democrat, then this is definitely a documentary for you. However, if you are independent (like myself), or politically right, then this documentary is at best an interesting example of political propaganda. Instead of presenting the historical facts in an interesting and engaging manner, Mr. Burns has created a film which (sometimes in a shamefully adolescent manner) constantly tries to manipulate the emotions. The purpose of such emotional manipulation is to force the weaker and more uninformed mind to adopt whole scale the political ideology of the left. In skillful, surreptitious fashion, Burns presents a New York which is in constant conflict between the evil capitalists and the kind, persecuted, and morally upright labor leaders and political progressives. For example, Boss Tweed, a clearly corrupt individual, is portrayed as a misguided man who was ultimately virtuous as he fought for all the left wing causes. Business leaders and ""the rich"" are portrayed as cold, maniacal, and ""anti-immigrant."" Perhaps the most shameful moment in the entire documentary is its presentation of the 1928 presidential campaign between Herbert Hoover and Al Smith (who incidentally is sappily portrayed in this film as a ""left wing messiah."") You get the impression from this film that Al Smith lost the election because of the racist, backward Protestant Christians in the Midwest, South, and rural areas who were just too illiterate to recognize the genius and goodness of a progressive from Manhattan. Fortunately, this view is contradicted in a small blurb by one of the better historians in the film, who admits that Hoover would have won against any Democrat, given the strong economic times. But still, these remarks are easily missed in the film, as the backwardness of middle, southern, and rural America is stressed in most emphatic fashion.  Even granting the clear fact that such racism existed, no conclusive evidence is offered for its effects on the election. Perhaps for example it was Mr. Smith's progressive ideas that did not sit well with the folks in the heartland! It should also be mentioned that Mr. Burns does not even mention in the film that of the eight states that Al Smith won, 6 were southern states, the very South he tries to portray as racist and backward. In summary, the average, vulnerable mind, i.e., such as the teenager, will walk away from this documentary thinking that outside of New York and the urban centers, Americans are just backward, racist country bumpkins, and even worse, that all Protestant Christians are evil. (I myself am a Catholic, yet was still outraged by the portrayal of Protestant Christians in this film, Christians who have contributed as much if perhaps not more to the good things in American culture.) I could give countless more examples of the left wing propaganda in this film and its ""liberal colored glasses"" view of history. Again, if you are on the political left, this film is a self-indulgent affirmation of your ideology. For anyone else, I would say this is a ""must not see.""",1314835200,26,3085,5.0848126232741615

Then you could have fitted in more of the marvellous Broadway shows - famous show business people, who played such a large part in the development of that art form. You should have given us more on the Jazz clubs, the Yankees, the wonderful street vendors - pretzels and hot dogs - the one and only Central Park, with it's softball diamonds, the NYPD, whose heavily-laden cops don't get the same kind of love and respect as the London Bobby.
The New York set is a MUST for anybody who loves that city -as I do - and I would advise - If you don't buy New York - you will be missing out on an amazing documentary, that may be watched over and over - with renewed enjoyment of it's high quality - (where did they find the great pictures?) when the viewer has forgotten scores of other productions.",1288051200,2,1172,4.331818181818182
2420068,5,B000BITUF2,"Excellent DVD set.  I learned much of the history of NYC from it and when I recently traveled to NYC, I was able to visit places I learned about in the series.  It made my visit much richer.",1286668800,,190,3.973684210526316
2420069,3,B000BITUF2,"The life of any great city exists on three levels - social, political and cultural.  What is surprising about this documentary is how well it succeeds at presenting the first two aspects of New York, while failing so miserably at addressing the third.  While I agree that a film should be evaluated on the basis of what it intended to do and not on what one thinks it should have done, it is difficult not to be critical of this omission, especially in a film with a running time approaching 18 hours.

What Ric Burns and his team have done here is present an exhaustive history of a great American city, with particular focus on the political figures at the center of it all.  Peter Stuyvesant, Boss Tweed, F.H. LaGuardia, Robert Moses and countless others are given extensive coverage, as are the lives of the immigrant population that were affected, for better or worse, by these political giants.  We see the various crises, upheavals and tragedies that went on to shape the city, and how the lives of its residents adapted, often with great difficulty, to the city's changes and growth.

And yet those who know New York as a center of American culture will quickly notice something missing in this film.  We see the great influx of immigrants but we learn little to nothing about how these different cultures went on to form the great melting pot.  The creation of ethnic neighborhoods like Chinatown and Little Italy are given only a passing mention.  New York institutions like the Italian market and the Jewish deli are never seen, despite New York's position as the multicultural food capital of the world.  The great Gilded Age of New York, as recounted by literary giants like Henry James and Edith Wharton, is virtually ignored.  (Burns is somewhat more successful with F. Scott Fitzgerald's ""Jazz Age"".)

Then there is the crucial arts and entertainment aspect.  The development of Broadway is not here, nor is the early motion picture industry, which existed in NYC before anyone had heard of Hollywood.  The great literary circles like American Bloomsbury and the Beats are never mentioned, nor are the many famous literary journals that followed them.  Greenwich Village is never looked at.  We do not see Yankee Stadium or the many historic events that took place there.  The great museums, theaters and concert halls are passed over.  We do not meet (with a few exceptions) the great writers, artists, musicians or actors, or the architectural geniuses who created Central Park, Grand Central Station, St. Patrick's Cathedral, the New York Public Library and the many other famous structures the city is known for.  We learn little about the development of big-city publishing, the fashion industry or, omission of all omissions, the birth of radio and television.

Granted, any of these topics alone could fill a lengthy documentary, but the fact that they are barely mentioned in a film of this length is hard to overlook.

I give the film three stars because what it does, it does well.  I just wish that after investing eighteen hours of my time, I had a better understanding of why New York holds such a high place in American culture.  As it is, I feel like I attended a very long history lesson, much of which will be forgotten shortly after the exam is over.",1276560000,46,3284,4.804270462633452
2420070,5,B000BITUF2,"This is the best history of New York until one invents a time machine. It is truly an inspired narrative.

I eagerly bought the updated version in format and content when it came out on DVD and have watched that version twice. This version is a commitment at 17.5 hours but what a commitment!

2420071,1,B000BITUF2,"Oh, what a terrible, terrible viewing and learning experience.

I endured 1140 minutes all the while waiting for the New York City I know to come alive. It never did.

Other reviews have noted the many stunning errors, and I noted how much was ignored or given short-shrift. Did the show not have the budget for competent researchers?

HOW could the incredible saga of the water system have been ignored? Without the stunning achievement of the Croton Aqueduct NYC would never be what it is today.

HOW could the building of the subway system have been ignored?

HOW could the early, pre-Hollywood movie industry have been ignored?

HOW could the development and construction of the great NY Public Library be ignored?

HOW could the creation of two mighty railroads (the Pennsylvania and Central), and the building of their monumental train stations, be ignored?

HOW could Broadway be ignored? Incredible!

HOW could the many great artists and galleries and museums be ignored?

HOW could the publishing, fashion, and jewelry industries be ignored?

HOW could the many fascinating neighborhoods that make a huge city into countless small towns be ignored? (We mostly heard only about Harlem and only in a negative way.)

The series spent an inordinate amount of time on ""conflicts"" between its citizens and this gave the impression that NYC was always teetering at the very edge of riots and chaos. But NYC is famous, like no other city, for its being able to absorb great swaths of diversity with relative harmony. Why was this extraordinary historical truth perverted?

For a visual presentation, the series showed almost nothing about the endless change that NYC is also famous for. Oh, sure, the many talking heads repeated this endlessly but the series didn't SHOW it! Yes, we saw a lot of imagery of very early Manhattan, but the next imagery shows the island fully built up! The steady, inexorable uptown creep was visually ignored, as was the development of the outer boroughs.

For example, there was an enclave of townhouses around St. John's Park in what is now known as Tribeca. Then Commodore Vanderbilt purchased the park, and built a massive warehouse on the site! The property values of the elegant homes surrounding the park instantly plummeted! There was likely never a quicker shift from genteel to slum.

Hard to believe, but East Fourth Street was another high-end enclave. The series could have shown computer-generated imagery of the street lined with elegant townhouses, and then morphed into a current view of the lone Old Merchant's House (1832) - surrounded by warehouses and empty lots.

So, too, with the impressive Colonnade Row (1833) on Lafayette Street. Most New Yorkers do not realize that the street was once a dead-end, and in the early 1800s was THE residential address. A hidden oasis. In one block, nine identical mansions were built in a row, and all fronted by imposing Corinthian columns. Nothing like it existed in the city. Ancient Rome in NY! Over time though, five of the houses were demolished for a warehouse, the street was cut through, and the residents fled uptown.

I can go on and on about the wealth of archival images that SHOW the endless change the city is famous for but which this series barely presented visually.

Above all though, the series made an inexplicable, stunning omission. An omission essential to engage a viewer: the payoff. We want the girl to get the guy, the poor person to win the lottery, and the honest politician to vanquish over evil. And there are fewer Great Pay Off stories than the resurrection of NYC in the 1980s and 1990s. I was there. I watched a near-ruined city reborn, and better than ever.

Two small examples? In Herald Square there is a pair of diminutive triangle-shaped parks. For decades these were paved with asphalt, unused and unloved. Parks in name only. Today they are miniature lush gardens much used. Why was this phenomenon (which happened with parks all over the city) ignored?

Larger examples:

The Brooklyn Bridge and its spectacular 100th anniversary. To this day I've never seen such an amazing display of fireworks.

In 1979 Central Park was a broken, dusty, vandalized, unsafe ruin. Today it is lush, beloved, and a wonder. Are people even paid to hug the trees?

The series showed the collapse of the subway system. But what about its miraculous rebirth, gleaming cars (air-conditioned!), and clean platforms?

Grand Central Terminal was black with grime, reeked of urine, and was covered with advertising inside. Today it is resplendent; quite likely better than when new. So, too, with the main library.

The series TALKED about the decline of industry but never SHOWED how these old, gritty areas were transformed into vibrant residential neighborhoods.

And HOW could the famous I LOVE NY campaign have been ignored? How?

Or the pooper-scooper law? With this one act New Yorkers finally understood they could no longer dump on their city - in more ways than one. The results were profound.

Had the city's resurrection really been SHOWN, viewers would have spontaneously jumped out of their seats and cheered and cried and gasped. It's a story that thrilling, magical, extraordinary, and breathtaking.

It's a story this series squandered.

Out of 1140 minutes there were perhaps 90 informative ones (the Eerie Canal and Robert Moses in particular).

I gave the series a star mostly for the ""extra"" episode about the World Trade Center which was everything the preceding episodes were not: informative, moving, visually rich, and engaging.",1262908800,49,5562,5.0

Certainly London and Paris each could easily fill out a set like this with their centuries of history and events.  This otherwise great set seems lacking in the early history of NYC.  The first DVD races through the first 200 years of history like an IRT Express train!  Then for the more current stuff we get much more, and in some cases too much detail.  The early Dutch and Colonial periods deserve at least a DVD each as these were crucial formative years not only for NYC, but for the Nation as well. The British occupation in the Rev War should have been discussed more as this was noteworthy.  The constant eulogies on the City are also a bit much at times.  I am a native NYer myself, and some of the constant love affair stuff with the city was enough to make me gag sometimes!  Still, this is a noteworthy work and certainly worth viewing.  There is a lot to learn about local history and characters.  Some of the talking heads are also amusing to see again.

As this is my first review on anything please forgive my mistakes.

From beginning to end this documentary will entertain you....no doubt. If you have any interest whatsoever in NYC and I guess you have as you would not be reading this review otherwise then save your pennies and buy it. The stories, narration and vast info supplied in this Doc will leave you with a warm and a kind of infatuation with this beautiful city. I've always been wanting to see video footage from around the early 20th century of the city and the series shows more than a substantial amount of that.

Episode 8 is worth the money alone. This 3 hour episode dedicates itself fully on the Twin Towers, their rise and fall. The footage involved with 9/11 is some I've never seen before and it will leave a lump in your throat.
From this episode I will never forget something Rudy Giulliani said when asked by a reporter the night of September 11 how many lives have been lost...he replied ""More Than Anyone Can Bare"".....not a truer line has been spoken.

Any serious historian of NYC cannot possibly ignore the Gilded Age or the influence of the great wealthy families on the city's history, culture, architecture, finances, etc. No other city in the country was so obviously influenced by these people over such a length of time as NYC. The very phrase 'The Gilded Age' created by Twain was based on his observations of NYC in the 1870's. The railroad expansion, which changed the course of American history more than any other industrial event, orginated in NYC And yet what Burns manages to do is ignore it all!! This series never even mentions the term 'Gilded Age'. There is zero mention of any of these famous people. It is as if a history of the automobile industry was filmed with no mention of Henry Ford. Such a thing would viewed as ridiculous and no one would attempt it. And yet that is what Burns has done here.
Burns dwells endlessly on average hack politicians. He devotes almost an entire episode to the Triangle Shirt Factory fire. Yet the name Vanderbilt or Astor or Gould is never heard. JP Morgan is mentioned twice I believe and only fleeting.  And this in a series about THE American city of business and industry ! His brother Ken ( no great lover of the rich either) would have at least mentioned them.

-The segments that I found particularly fascinating dealt with the construction of the Erie Canal (an engineering feat considered crucial to the success of American industry); the never-before-attempted construction of the largest city park in the world (Central Park), designed and located on the conjecture that the city WOULD grow so much that its boundaries would one day lie within populated areas of the city; and perhaps, most compellingly, the story of the Draft Riots (when over 100,000 of the citys Irish immigrant community rioted over the idea of being drafted for the ongoing Civil War, blaming the war on the citys oppressed black citizens, and brutally murdering and mutilating dozens of hapless blacks). Still the largest (and arguably most brutal) riots ever to occur within the US. The barbaric behavior of these most recent immigrants (the Irish) perhaps answers the question why no one wanted them in New York in the first place. Living up (or down) to their widespread reputation for brutishness, historians arguments that they behaved in this manner out of frustration with their poor living conditions, and the feeling that they had been sold a false dream of America when they left Ireland simply rings rather hollow, when one considers that: A) They were never invited to come to the US in the first place (in fact, most Americans viewed with something approaching horror the arrival of so many Irish); their decision to leave Ireland was almost totally the result of the Irish Potato Famine, then decimating a full quarter of Irelands population,and that 2) considering the conditions back in Ireland that they had escaped from (in addition to starvation from the aforementioned famine), the vast majority of newly-arrived Irish came from primitive, rural communities, where living conditions were hand-to-mouth, living in thatch and mud huts (which were truly hovels), and a diet consisting almost totally of potatoes. In addition, the Irish were the most illiterate, uneducated group of migrants the US had as yet experienced (with a well-known propensity for drunkenness and brawling). As such, they could hardly view the tenements in New York as a great step down from their prior lives.....In fact, history shows that it was the IRISH who had dislocated the BLACK population of the city (who had been there since the citys founding), taking their jobs, their homesand treating them with the utmost brutality since their arrival....Anyone spouting the old saw that, Violence never solves anything, should watch the segment (program #2 in the series) on the Riotsand see how these base criminals not only got away with mass murderbut got the Government to back down in the process (allowing many to escape the draft they so hated), while at the same time, introducing numerous social problems to make their lives easier.....Really a despicable episode in the citys history, and one would think that todays Irish descendants of these brutes should thank their lucky stars that the citys entire Irish population wasn't promptly deported from the country......

-And throughout the entire series we hear the voices of citizenswealthy and poorwho lived through the citys ups and downs. Notable voices included those of poet Walt Whitman, mayor Al Smith, and, my personal favorite (and perhaps the most eloquent and informative diarist who ever lived), George Templeton Strong, whose concise description of events in the cityfrom the 1830s through the 1870s provides a first-person account of New Yorks most explosive growth yearsand a rich and heartfelt tribute to the city he loved....",1523059200,,3874,5.226688102893891
