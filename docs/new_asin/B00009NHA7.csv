7992338,5,B00009NHA7,"I'm buying this for Christmas. It's sooooo goooooodddd!!! Okay, if you can get passed the first 4 minutes (i'm still confused at why that was in the movie) then this is a wonderful WONDERFUL MOVIE. All black men need to see this movie. It's  about a guy/writer/Malik Yoba who has two girlfriends and he's stagnant with writing and gets fired b/c he hasn't done a good article. (well it's last minute, that's the first 3 minutes of the movie). Anyway so his friends say write an article about ""Personal"" want ads (you know single woman looking for a man) and he dates like 30 woman in 30 days. It's pretty funny with the characters b/c you may KNOW someone like that. I've met several poets like that poet girl. that was the funniest scene. We all know the first girl the loud ghetto girl that hates ghetto guys (funny thing about her is that she doesn't realize she's ghetto!!! haha)

This movie is better made than some of the more known release independent film. The lighting CHANGES and is on point all the way through. No added dumb scenes, the script is FUNNNNYYYY (save for the first 3 minutes), Malik with his shirt off (hang on let me take a minute), the scenary. If you've been to NEW YORK CITY, this is a wonderful way to refresh and reminisce (4got how to spell that. my bad)

The only question I had as a wannabe writer was he spent money every night, if he just wrote that newspaper article, how much was he getting paid for it? Plus he had to pay rent. Just curious to know if he could make a livign doing newspaper articles.

Who else is in the movie? Stacy Dash, ""Dee"" the stepmom/mom on ""Moesha"". she also was  a DreamGirl.(sorry i forgot your name but you're funny on VH1 best week ever. She's also hilarious in this movie)  And then Diana Ross's daughter I'm pretty sure that's her. She's funny also.",1196899200,,1819,4.431137724550898
7992339,1,B00009NHA7,"Lame acting,lamer script and a been there,done that

7992340,4,B00009NHA7,I thought film was very well acted out. The cast was chosen well with the exception of Stacy Dash. She did a good job but should have been used more to show her skills. I wonder if a Soundtrak of various music in movie was ever put on CD? Does anyone know?  The film is well worth the cost of purchase.,1121040000,6,302,3.9508196721311477
7992341,5,B00009NHA7,"This movie truly shows how versatile Malik Yoba really is. We've seen him as a bad ass athlete in Cool Runnings, a street smart cop in New York Undercover, and a righteous business man in Ride. In this movie, we see him as in debt and struggling writer with an idea for an article that sounds creative yet manipulative. He sees quite a line-up of dates for his article. Among them a woman who wants to be impregnated by him without having to father the baby, a woman who works as a clown for birthday parties, a Star Trek buff, and a sexy latin siren who wants to settle down with him. The dating aspect of the movie is so so for the exception of the latin woman Veronica, who is played perfectly by the over-looked Delilah Cotto. She adds pizazz to the movie and I enjoyed every one of her scenes. And Malik Yoba's screen presence also carries the movie. They are my two favorite characters and they do more than enough to offset the dullness of the other women that Malik Yoba dates. Stacey Dash's character was somewhat of a wasted role but that aspect is also offset by once again my two favorite characters in this movie. Overall you're in for a fun time watching this movie. You won't be disappointed one bit!",1099094400,2,1215,4.380530973451328
7992342,3,B00009NHA7,"Malik Yoba plays Keith, a struggling journalist that comes up with a story idea. He uses the personal ads to get 30 dates in 30 days. He discovers all sorts of women until he discovers a girl (Stacey Dash) that sees right through him. What turns out to be a story idea becomes a quest to understand woman and their issues of dating.
If you have seen How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days or Never Been Kissed, this movie si sort of a hybrid of those movies. You pretty much see every type of woman out there and then some. A nice movie without the excessive sexual content.",1065312000,9,564,4.136363636363637
