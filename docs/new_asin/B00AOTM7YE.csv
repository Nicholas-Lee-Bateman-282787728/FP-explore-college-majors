8555515,5,B00AOTM7YE,"As the title character, Barfi has a serious hearing and speech impairment. As a result, his actions in this story are reminiscent of silent era physical comedy actors in the best of that tradition. In a sensitive and genuinely moving portrayal (indeed a towering performance) Ranbir Kapoor immediately draws us in and never lets go. The musical score is absolutely gorgeous and complements the images perfectly. A film full of color and beauty, and on Blu-Ray an audio-visual treat.",1376352000,3,482,5.113924050632911
8555516,5,B00AOTM7YE,"I have to admit, I really enjoyed this film. I could not believe that the lead female in the film was Priyanka Chopra. I had to read the liner notes twice. She looks totally different from her usual self. Ranbir Kapoor plays his character well. The movie is both funny and sad and everything in between. If you don't mind reading subtitles ( unless you understand Hindi) I would recommend this for anyone who is interested in something different.",1374796800,3,446,4.658227848101266

8555519,5,B00AOTM7YE,"Some may say this movie stole some famous scenes from classics.  But this movie is full of love and humor, which we can't find in Hollywood movies any more. They didn't steal but quoated those scenes because it seems too obvious if you call it plagiarism.  All the actors and actresses are very attractive and lovely.  After watching whole this movie once, you will want to watch some lovable scenes again and again.",1358985600,2,416,4.671232876712328
