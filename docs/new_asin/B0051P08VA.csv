8452997,4,B0051P08VA,"This is a narrative of American History and the Birth of the Professional Soldier as a facet of American Government combined with the Military Industrial Complex of the Economy.  The History that is presented has several Gap's and leaves out many details but is a FAIR review of the History of Warfare.  It should be used with other Historical events as a supplement to this narrative, it is not a relable single source for the facts.  Remember that this is propaganda more than a Historical Review.  It is given a 7 out of 10.",1349049600,,527,4.574468085106383
