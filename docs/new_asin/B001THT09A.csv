8341467,5,B001THT09A,"This anime isn't much different than some of the other space/harem/comedy stories out there. It's very similar to shows like Nadesico or Dragonaut. The thing that makes this anime good like the others I mentioned is the multitude of cool characters it has. There are plenty of neat characters that are fun and that keep the story interesting. The story line is pretty cool. There are 3 men stuck on a ship of women. In their world women and men live separately and do not interact. This makes for a lot of funny and awkward situations. The animation is pretty good and the voice acting isn't bad either. Vandread isn't exactly an original masterpiece, but it's pretty entertaining and lots of fun. If you're looking for an amazing and original story, then look elsewhere. If you just wanna laugh and have fun then Vandread is a good place to start.",1355184000,,848,4.66
