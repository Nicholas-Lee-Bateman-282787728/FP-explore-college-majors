3035336,5,B000YV1KTK,"I have been using Walk Away the Pounds for years.  However, this year I decided I needed a boost (after having my second baby).  What a boost this is!  Despite the fact that Allison goes extremely fast throughout her choreography, it does workout your abs and you will feel the soreness the next day.  I would recommend to anyone needing an extra round of ab work.  It's quick, efficient, and gets right to the core.",1231200000,,416,4.493333333333333
3035337,5,B000YV1KTK,"I am a huge FIRM fan and workout for 40-45 minutes 6-7 mornings a week. All of my videos are from the FIRM series. They feature safe exercises with a efficient and effective warm-up/cool-down segments. The DVDs help me to work out in my target heart rate range. I don't love all of the FIRM videos, though. Some are too fast or too slow. I am a woman who is 5' 9"" and 180 lbs. My heart rate for weight loss/weight maintenance is 120 to 135 beats per minute during the main workout time -- so I try to pick videos that work at that level. My favorite FIRM'videos are: Ultimate Fat Burning Workout, Burn & Shape and Total Body Toner. This ""Core Solutions"" is soon to be another favorite in my rotation. There is enough variation in exercises to keep me interested and the intensity is right for me.",1223337600,4,796,4.3133333333333335
3035338,5,B000YV1KTK,"This is a great abs dvd. It has three workout options: 10 min. standing abs, 10 min. core and sculpting, or 10 min. traditional abs.  I've done the first two and they are both great. I like Alison, but her cueing on some of her cardio dvds is not the best. These, however, are very well done.  If you're looking for a quick abs workout to supplement your regular workouts, this has a nice set of options. Highly recommended.",1215820800,,424,4.3544303797468356
3035339,5,B000YV1KTK,"This DVD is a great core workout supplement to any excercise program. I personally use it on days that I run or do cardio. Its broken up into 3 different 10 minute workouts that you can mix up with other DVDs you may have. The intructor is easy to follow, and gives her cues perfectly. I also like the use of light dumbells to add resistance. Thumbs up!",1212537600,10,353,4.205882352941177
3035340,4,B000YV1KTK,"This is a great workout.  The only thing that I dislike about this is that the 3 workouts are just that- 3 completely separate workouts.  There's no way to play all 3 one right after the other.  You get done with Standing Abs and the dvd STOPS.  So you grab the remote and hit play on the next one (Functional Abs), and when that one is over you have to get up and grab the remote and hit play on Classic Abs.  Now, that would be a good option if you were short on time or only wanted to do one 10min ab segment.  If you want to do all 3 workouts, keep the remote nearby.  I would have given 5 stars if the 3 workouts could be programmed into one.

3035341,4,B000YV1KTK,"As a newbie to ""The Firm"" series, I was pleasantly suprised by this little gem.  As an intermediate exerciser, I try to workout between 45 minutes to an hour 5 days a week. This workout is great when I'm short on time and is appropriate for all fitness levels as there is one person doing the beginner modifications.  The workout consists of (3) 10 minute workouts; standing abs, fuctional abs and traditional abs.  I really enjoy this dvd and it has prompted me to try other  firm workouts.",1208736000,35,491,4.545454545454546

3035366,1,B000YV1KTK,"Did this workout this morning, all 3 sections. I'm 20 weeks pregnant, and beginning to find every ab exercise difficult. However, I didn't feel a thing with this workout! There simply wasn't enough of any exercise to get a burn of any kind. I was hoping that the standing abs workout would be good for me as I progress through the pregnancy, but I think I'm better off just doing knee lifts on the box, I feel that more!",1308873600,3,420,4.329113924050633
3035367,2,B000YV1KTK,This c.d. has 3- 10 minute work-outs. The first 2 are so easy that I did not feel any soreness. I did start to feel something on the 3rd work-out. I wouldn't recommend it. A waste of money. I was hoping for a  good hard workout. This certainly was a disappointment.,1247356800,2,265,4.196078431372549
3035368,5,B000YV1KTK,"This is one of my most favorite ab workouts and I have about 300 exercise DVDs (from Cathe to Amy to CIA - I have it). I really don't like The Firm much in comparison to others, but this is an exception. Alison is very natural and non-rehearsed (very non-Firm like). It's also exactly how I like to work my abs - a variety with weights and it's fun at the same time. I admit that I use much heavier weights and other equipment, but I get creative with other workouts as well to get the most out of it.

3035369,2,B000YV1KTK,"I love Alison and the Dangerous Curves tape....but this workout was not what I thought it would be. It was just not challenging enough. I did this tape after doing another cardio/sculpting tape and still felt as though I wasted my time. I recommend that you definitely do not use this tape as workout in itself, but only as a compliment to another tape at best.....even then you might be disappointed.

3035370,2,B000YV1KTK,"I got this DVD a little cheaper from Walmart for $10 but I wanted a supplement to go with my strength training and cardio...I just wanted something that would really work my abs...I found that my 30 day shred was much more effective. i even tried this AFTER my 30 day shred workout and only felt a real push on the Classic Abs segment...I really wish they would do more reps of each exercise...the idea is great but to really get a burn you need more reps.  I felt like they tried to pack a lot of different exercises in and didn't spend enough time doing each one.
Overall I was disappointed.  I too was bugged by having to restart the player each segment...but you don't really move around too much so just keep the remote nearby and that solves that problem.
I think the individual exercises are great but I'd rather do them on my own so I can do more reps with them.",1241395200,2,870,4.266666666666667
3035371,1,B000YV1KTK,I was very disappointed in this DVD.  I feel like I wasted the precious 45 minutes I had set aside to really get a great workout.  Most of the exercises had 8 counts total.  That's barely enough to get proper form or allow a few seconds to follow the tape.  I did not find it challenging.  I am an intermediate level exerciser.  I have used other Firm tapes over the years and found this one did not measure up.  I don't even recommend it for beginners because it switched too quickly to follow.  I give it a thumbs down.,1240704000,3,521,4.191919191919192

3035373,5,B000YV1KTK,"When I first saw that this was only 30 minutes, I was skeptical and worried it wouldn't do much for me, but I was wrong!  This combines traditional ab moves, weights and pilates for sculpting strong stomach muscles.  It's easy to follow and fun and goes by fast.

8234090,4,B000YV1KTK,"I ""like-plus"" this video.  It has 3 distinct abdominal workouts that can be done 1, 2, or 3 at a time depending on how much time I have and/or how intensely I wish to work my abdominal muscles.  And I always like Alison, the instructor.  She generally cues the exercises well and has a no-nonsense delivery. (I don't care for the super excited, ""this-is-awesome, I'm-so-excited"" instructors.)  The variety is nice, too.  Each of the 3 routines is fully distinctive, incorporating completely different exercises than the others.  So while I'm not the whole way to loving this video, I do like it about 4 1/2 stars worth and would definitely recommend it.",1470873600,,653,4.837837837837838
8234091,4,B000YV1KTK,"Great video. Alison Davis is my favorite Firm instructor.  This video has 3, 10 minute ab sets.  The 2nd set, Functional Core is particularly challenging, imo.  My only complaint is that you can't play the video straight through, if you wanted to do a full 30 minute ab workout.  You have to start each set individually.

But as I've aged, my abs have become trickier to tone. I REALLY like this workout. Alison uses weights (very effective) and moves you don't ordinarily encounter in abs routines. The morning after I did my first set, I was sore in muscles I didn't know I had. This workout really seems to reach deep. Of course, Alison is always an excellent instructor, so her workouts are easy to follow from the start. The best part is I can now always tag an extra, quick abs routine onto my regular workout. For Firm fans (and others), I highly recommend this DVD. Just understand, the workouts are only 10 minutes each. They don't replace full workouts.",1464566400,3,785,4.535211267605634
