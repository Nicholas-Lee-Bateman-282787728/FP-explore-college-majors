7916194,4,B00002SSLK,"Very interesting program. What makes this so interesting, is the fact that a list of things point to Lizzie (well lets say more things  point to her, than anyone else)  However, there is in most of our minds, some doubt in her actions, and the strange actions of several other people.  If I had been on the Jury, and we used the science of 1892-3 I would have thought (after reading the 1970 page trial) She had the best chance and the closest  motive for being the murderer. However, with the evidence presented at the trial, even though I think she did it, my verdict would have to be - not guilty. However, lets look at the positive side. The Borden Murder has made lots of people money and even helped out lots of animals due to Lizzie and Emma's will....... The truth is you can rant and rave all you want, and you can disagree with this video.... But what makes it so interesting, is since 1892,  and my guess well into 2192, is all the ""missing pieces, & all the if's, and's,  & but's""  - It's the mystery,  and the debate we love so much.  Not the fact that two humans were killed.",1109980800,5,1089,4.273170731707317
7916195,3,B00002SSLK,"Being a history/unsolved crime buff--this was an entertaining and interesting program. However, attempts to make Lizzie appear innocent--laughable! PUH-LEEZ! The ""O.J."" of her day when ""women just didn't do such things""---in today's 'real' world, she'd hang! Motive, means, opportunity and a virtual MOUNTAIN of evidence: to date, only Lizzie & OJ have been acquitted with as much. Enjoyable program nonetheless. LOVE McBain's books, too!!! ALL of them I HIGHLY recommend!",1106611200,9,472,5.757142857142857
7916196,5,B00002SSLK,"The story of Lizzie Borden and what went on in her house more than 100 years ago is a fascinating one. But this documentary is the best I've seen. While other documentaries spend a lot of time going over the very gruesome deaths of Lizzie's step-mother and father, Mr. McCain sets out for answers. So he interviews authors and historians about the case and about Lizzie's life. The result is wonderful. I still don't know who killed the two people, but let's face it, no one does. It's great to get some fresh insights into other people that could have done the dastardly deeds. Highly recommended!",1008288000,26,598,4.650943396226415
7916197,5,B00002SSLK,"It was good to see more than one theory. Let's face it, we don't know what happened that day, it could have happened many ways! This documentary gives you more than one idea to play around with and allows you to  think about the facts and come to your own conclusions. After seeing all the many ways in which this could have happened, I still believe Lizzie had both hands in the mix.",981244800,13,384,4.260273972602739
