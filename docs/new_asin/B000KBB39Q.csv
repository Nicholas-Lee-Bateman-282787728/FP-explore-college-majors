8155398,4,B000KBB39Q,"James and B.B King ROCKED this show...I had a lot of fun watching it. A bit disappointed the Prince bit was not on this - would have been a complete event then but oh well.

I definitely recommend this DVD - it's a collector's item in my opinion and every fan should have this as a MUST in their collection. I am not exactly sure when this show took place but I believe it was around September 1983 if I am not mistaken. And what a year that was!!! Wow!! A little bit of history right there, as well as a fantastic show between the Godfather of Soul and the King of Blues...

Go get it!",1248825600,,586,4.043103448275862
8155399,5,B000KBB39Q,"My mom recorded this show off TV back in the early eighties. We had it on a VHS tape. But we played it so much the tape warped. I had been on a crusade for many years trying to find a copy on DVD to no avail. Later, I found it on Amazon. It is a nice compliment to entertaining.

Last Christmas when my family came over for dinner, we wanted to do something different for entertainment. So we pulled out some old videos. The James Brown & B.B. King video was one of them. I could not get my family to go home that evening. We listened to the video several times. My aunt could not understand why I had not showed her this video before. Everyone had a great time laughing and dancing to the music which was excellent. In fact, my aunt had another engagement to go to but called to let them know she was running late. She did not want to leave my house until she finished watching the video.

My uncle was excited about some of the songs he had not heard before and his wife insisted that we rewind the DVD so she could see James Brown dancing across the floor doing one of his famous moves. Everyone was trying to mimic some of his moves. We were falling on the floor having a ball.

Michael Jackson makes a brief appearance on the video and B.B. King and James Brown take to the stage together. B.B. spices up his guitar and begins playing a James Brown tune that is simply awesome.

This DVD is a must have in your library collection. It offers a lot of excitement and adds to the enrichment of any party.",1240704000,,1506,4.147260273972603
8155400,5,B000KBB39Q,"Along with the technically substandard The Lost James Brown Tapes/Bodyheat, also from CA and from roughly the same time period, this is the best available example of the post-Polydor JB, rockin' - *soulin'* - along the Club and theatre circuit, cutting for small labels but out there with the delirious throngs of original and new fans, gettin' up offa that thing and shakin' up a storm - can you dig that  chick in the black mini-skirt, grooving to a salacious take of Papa's Bag, out in the front row basking in rarified rays from Soul Heaven, James Brown, at his fighting weight, dancing and singing true to form.
This DVD is the only Brown show commercially available to make the audience part of the show, a brilliant production technique.
It's not all uptempo, though, and deep fans might notice, particularly on the ballads, a matured vocalist, offering very little in the way of trademark hollers, screams, and moans, which really permeate earlier ventures. Some of those histrionics might be missed but that's not a critical element here at all.
B. B. King has a fairly short but entertaining set, Michael Jackson is invited on stage and imitates his idol on ""There Was a Time"", and this certifies the show as an *event*. It's been said that Prince followed MJ on stage but this section was not used (hint...for the next edition).
Extras aren't much, but don't let that get you down. I repeat the review title above.",1178668800,4,1425,4.769230769230769
