8397564,4,B003INBNT8,"I would rank this number 2 in the ""Legends of Air Combat"" series, behind the ""B-52"" one.  It is largely an enjoyable program",1423958400,,124,4.391304347826087
8397565,4,B003INBNT8,Good Vid,1412726400,,8,3.5
8397566,4,B003INBNT8,"I'd recommend this DVD to military fans. The narraration leaves something to be desired, but the film footage is great. I do wish they spent more time on the F-15s time to climb records.",1359072000,,186,4.5
8397567,3,B003INBNT8,"A fairly basic documentary, For someone new to military jets this is a good video for them, but to
those jet enthusiasts looking for more than the basics,forget it. The footage is somewhat grainy and dated therefore it gets a 3 star rating.",1311465600,4,240,4.604651162790698
