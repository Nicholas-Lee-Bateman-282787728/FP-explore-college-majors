8084828,5,0876045816,"What a genius Mr Sitchin was. I am awed at how he could decipher those ancient languages and piece together the history of man, in a way no one else could. I understand how mainstream religion would feel threatened. Glad I read his series ""Earth Chronicles."" Lloyd Pye's ""Everything You Know is Wrong"" started me off (first part of that book is about the Starchild Skull, and the second half is about Mr Sitchin and his writings. Highly recommend both authors!",1368921600,6,460,4.691358024691358
