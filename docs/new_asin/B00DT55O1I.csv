5853917,5,B00DT55O1I,"What could be more relevant at this particular time  than this movie? And even more so because the filmmakers trusted viewers enough to let them arrive at their own conclusions. There is no narration by some celebrity or political spokesperson. There are only the words and experiences of those who  are very sick, uninsured, and with few options for medical care.

The Waiting Room shows the faces of those patients - and the doctors and caregivers who strive to help them. This documentary was shot in the emergency room at Highland Hospital in Oakland, California but the same harsh reality plays out in emergency rooms all across the country.

The ER at Highland Hospital has overcrowded waiting rooms and lengthy waits to get seen by medical professionals. There are strong efforts from hospital staff to keep things moving along. But when other hospitals turn patients away, they come to Highland Hospital. It may be the only option left.

The film is undeniably grim but also surprisingly inspiring. There is no sermonizing by the filmmakers. Instead, they step back and let viewers  hear the words and see the faces of often desperately ill people. They can  also glimpse the calm and steadying care of doctors who know they can only do so much. There is no false or heightened drama here.

Perhaps that is because there is is drama enough watching those forced to seek treatment in the ER. The young man who was scheduled for urgent surgery -until a medical center learned he had no insurance. Now he is waiting for assistance in Highland's emergency room. There is is a young girl with a raging fever and a tongue so swollen she can't speak. He father always had a job but now is unemployed and his family has no regular medical care.

I was moved to tears by the heartbreaking and gut wrenching experiences of the patients and the hospital staff who were trying to work miracles or at least keep chaos at bay - in a clearly floundering system. And of course I couldn't help but wonder: what if I faced a devastating illness and was uninsured ? What would I do if I didn't have the good fortune to have health insurance and a primary care physician in a decent medical group?

The faces and words of each patient revealed some of the answers to those questions. The fear that comes when necessary surgery is denied due to lack of insurance. The growing despair of those who take a number in the morning, and then wait for hours (often in pain) while hoping to be seen before the end of the day. Worrying about the costs of medical treatment. Little to no follow-up care because an ER isn't for long-term treatment but only a temporary solution.

There is no overt political message here. Instead, the film is an invitation to see the faces and hear the voices of those who may not be heard or seen otherwise. It drives home the complexity of our healthcare system and raises questions- and hopefully sparks communication- about how to confront the challenges of healthcare for those who are ill and uninsured.",1381190400,3,3019,4.6773584905660375

Maybe it's not exactly gripping, but still an informed and inside look into the workings of an extremely busy public hospital's waiting room.  Watching this it's very hard not to feel immense respect for the medical staff and doctors.  Some patient's really push the limits too with outrageous demands and abusive language.

Not particularly graphic, but some gut wrenching scenes.  Have to wonder too, what happened to some of the patients.",1451692800,,503,5.085365853658536

5853936,5,B00DT55O1I,"Warning: once you start viewing this film,you will be unable to look away. You must continue, you must know what happens.

A day in the life of an Emergency Department, this one Highland Hospital in Oakland. This is a public hospital, you see everyone who walks or comes in. However, instead of emergencies. Most people use this emergency room for their primary care. Very expensive care, but they have no insurance, no money to see a regular physician. So, they wait until it becomes an emergency to them, and they come to the Emergency Room.

I must say at the outset, that the physicians and nurses who are featured, Cynthia Johnson, CNA, certified nursing assistant and Dr Doug White, Emergency physician, are a representative of the caring personnel in this hospital. The hours of unflagging work, on their feet, with people arguing to be seen now. An emergency room filled with people who all fill the criteria of need, a man who was shot and is now feeling numbness and tingling. A young girl whose face and neck are so swollen she cannot open her mouth, with a father who is so dejected and filled with guilt because he lost his job and cannot provide adequate health care for his daughter. A young man who has been worked up for testicular Cancer in a private hospital, but because he was found with no insurance his surgery was canceled and he was told to go to Highland Hospital. He and his significant other had lost a baby in miscarriage, and now they were dealing with this presumed Cancer. Shooting emergencies roll in, and the personnel need to stop their care of others to deal with the trauma. A 15 year old boy comes in with cardiac arrest and dies. The staff are sad but must move on to the next one.

This film was made in 2012 before the approval of ACA, and we hope the tide has turned, that most people with no insurance, are now covered. This is a very frustrating film to watch because we think the U.S. has the best healthcare in the world. That could not be more untrue. We have good healthcare for those who can afford it. This is an institution of 'last resort' for these people. We don't know the outcomes of most of these people. They come, they are seen, they leave. This is the life of the poor, the unemployed, our neighbors and friends.

Highly Recommended. prisrob 04-25-15",1429920000,2,2310,4.532374100719425

What I enjoyed about this documentary, is that the film makers do not make any commentary throughout the film. That is not, of course, to say that they don't make and edit the film from their perspective. If you walk into any emergency room in an urban environment, you will find the same parallels. Unfortunately, I believe that this film documents the state of health care today.",1384214400,,480,4.593023255813954
5853955,3,B00DT55O1I,"As someone who works in a busy emergency department, this film was nothing new and felt like a typical day at work.

Overall, I was greatly disappointed by the documentary. The film captures moments throughout a day at Highland Hospital in Oakland, CA. Many of the moments they share add little value to the documentary and have you twiddling your thumbs waiting for the next scene. Some of these scenes include people eating, sitting in the waiting room, hospital employees carrying out mundane tasks, making small talk, or walking from room to room, etc.

The documentary lacks any sort of quantitative data. It would be nice to know how many patients a day the Emergency Department sees, what the average wait time is, what percent of the patients are insured, and how these values compare to other hospitals.

I felt the documentary had very few interviews with the hospital employees. It would have been nice to get some perspective from doctors, nurses, and hospital administrators (perhaps ask them, what is being done to reduce wait times? who is paying for these uninsured patients?).

In addition, there are few explanations of the medical problems the people are having and the severity of their condition. Therefore, I think it is difficult as a viewer to fully understand how urgently (or not so urgently) the people need help.",1383955200,3,1340,4.942222222222222
5853956,4,B00DT55O1I,"I tried to count the number of people that had actual emergencies. I'd put it at about 15% of them. The rest are in the absolute wrong place. One guy comes in and waits for 7 hours because he wanted Tylenol. Another one, a kid, has simple strep throat and the doctor orders a slew of unnecessary tests for something a shot of penicillin could handle, thus increasing the wait time for everyone else. Medication refills, back pain, testicle tumor, anxiety, boils. Come on, really? The distinction between a REAL emergency and something that can wait should be taught in elementary school and again in high school. The gun shot wounds are an emergency. A cold for 2 days is not.",1382659200,,676,4.595041322314049
