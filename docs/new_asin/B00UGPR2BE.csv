No one depicts, loves or understands 40'-50's Cuba, it's music, dance and people, all unique, like Garcia, producer, actor.  A beautiful, historical movie filmed in Cuba.  Forget the plane, go there in his films!",1522800000,,279,4.8936170212765955

8706007,5,B00UGPR2BE,"This is a classic, best movie on what Cuba is really like! Andy Garcia's grandfather's life matches with a neighbors life when they left Cuba. How people think Castro was good is beyond the pail.",1480636800,,195,4.6
