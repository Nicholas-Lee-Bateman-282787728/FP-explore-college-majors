Original Broadcast: January 24, 1959 To music teachers, ""classical"" music is really the music of 18th Century Europe, which was formulated by Bach and Handel in a strict, almost mathematical style. Later, Haydn and Mozart changed the formula to add grace and elegance. Still later came Beethoven, a genius who broke all the rules and ushered in the Romantic period. ""Egmont"" Overture (Beethoven) and Overture to The Marriage of Figaro (Mozart), plus excerpts from Symphony No. 102 (Haydn), Symphony No. 40 (Mozart), Brandenburg Concerto No. 4 (Bach), Water Music (Handel), and Piano Concerto No. 21 (Mozart).
What Makes Music Symphonic? Original Broadcast: December 13, 1958 Unlike pop music, symphonic music takes simple musical themes and then ""develops"" them -- that is, changes and expands them -- in a dazzling variety of costumes.

Excerpts from Symphony No. 4 (Tchaikovsky), Symphony No. 3 (Beethoven), Symphony No. 104 (Haydn), Symphony No. 41, ""Jupiter"" (Mozart), and Symphony No. 2 (Brahms).",1089676800,4,1210,5.441489361702128
