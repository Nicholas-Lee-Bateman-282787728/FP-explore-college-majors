3441722,3,B0019LZ19O,"This is a very uneven production of the Ring, it is perhaps the best dramatic version of the Ring, but many in the cast are weak, and this is above all true of Brunhilde who is so foolishly made the center of this production. I regret that I bought this and would be happy to sell it.

3441723,5,B0019LZ19O,"People are calling the Copenhagen Ring the feminist Ring and that is certainly true. The meta-structure is Brunnhilde discovering her heritage at the end of Act II of Gotterdamerung.  That is certainly true. But it is also a relational Ring. I have seldom seen the level of interaction between characters in an opera. The video helps (or hurts depending on your prejudices) by its close ups especially of other characters than the one singing. For example in Rheingold Woman and Loge are casing Alberich's realm while Mime whines about his life.
 It is also an extremely violent Ring. Many more characters die than in Wagner's libretto. Only Brunnhilde makes it out alive. The death of Siegfried is especially gruesome. But then so are all the deaths.
 And finally it is an alcoholic Ring. Alberich gets staggering drunk in the first scene of Rheingold. Woman carries around a liquor flask from which he swigs frequently. Siegfried passes up liquor in the first act. Bit by Gotterdamerung he has developed quite a taste for booze.
 The violence and the drink help to make the case for the brutality of patriarchy. Again and again the production team (and this is a team effort) delivers a shock. And then upon reflection you realize that although not in Wagner's libretto it is not against the plot or the music. Indeed some of the actions seem right on.
 This is the most exciting Ring I have seen. You can't wait to see what they will do next. And for me most of the things they do add to my understanding of the work. Setting it in the 20th century brings home what it is about. They have taken Wagner's original as archetypes and then enfleshed them in concrete 20th century characters and situations. I feel it works very well. I'm not sure someone with no knowledge of the Ring would make of it, but for this confirmed Wagnerholic was an eye opener.
 So what about the cast - the singing and acting. It is not the best sung on DVD. But it is damn good. The only flaw in the cast is Hunding who simply does not have the weight in his voice for the role. This is too bad since they have a great bass in Hunding who is truly menacing in this production. All the singer appear to be Danish or Scandinavian. The only one I know is Stig Anderson and I feel he delivers the finest Siegfried I have ever seen. He manages to incarnate a teenager wonderfully even though his face is a few decades older than Siegfried's 18 years. Then in Gotterdamerung he becomes the oaf: even before the magic potion he is cruising Gutrune. Someone has said that they find this Ring cold. I believe it is the first time I have actually shed tears a Siegfried's death. Brunnhilde almost matches him growing from girl to woman. Above all they can sing.
 Approaching the end of Gotterdamerung every one wonders how they will bring it off, if they will bring it off. They bring it off, but before the transform the Immolation scene beautifully. This is usually a stand and deliver scene.  Not here. When Brunnhilde addresses Woman she really does so. He is seated in a huge chair with this back to the audience waiting to die. Before Brunnhilde has addressed Siegfried's corpse. As Siegfried dies Brunnhilde is with him. Put these two scenes together and you have a final love duet - each singing to the silent partner. It you love the Ring you owe it to yourself to see this magical production from Copenhagen.",1223251200,8,3388,4.5700164744645795
3441724,5,B0019LZ19O,"In many ways this by far the best Ring on DVD and I have had three others and parts of a fourth.  One, the Levine, I gave away.  While updated to the 20th century, this is NOT Euro-trash and all in all as drama it works splendidly, particularly in the so called ""boring parts"". A group of singing actors soar into the drama with no holds barred and they play to a very knowing camera crew who keep the drama of the moment alive by at times focusing appropriately on how an other character respond to what is sung as well as on the singer in question. Each singer is in character at all times. And the singing, with one minor exception, is first class. The staging is spectacular. Thus this is by far the best Sigfried I have ever seen. And I mention this because, before seeing this DVD, I had thought Sigfried the weakest of the dramas.  You may have read of some of the gimmicks in this production such as the rheingold being a nude male swimmer.  The fact is, though, that within the context of this production the so called gimmicks work.  Everything is well thought out, even the makeup. It is surely one of the great opera sets on DVD.",1221350400,12,1141,4.288372093023256
3441725,4,B0019LZ19O,"This Ring is different from all other Rings on DVD and is mostly successful in what it aims to bring. It is wonderful to have this pinnacle of operatic spectacles in a staging worthy of the subject, a stage with `actors who can sing' as Wagner wished it. The singers do act as if in a movie and the DVD has been filmed as a dramatic movie, not as a static stage performance though a live stage performance it of course is. This may at times be a bit tiresome as images and image angles may seem to switch a bit too often but most of the time by far this cinematographic approach pays off well and enhances the drama without disturbing the operatic enjoyment. The result is an experience unlike the live experience in the opera house itself but I'm inclined to say the choice was well made. After all, a film on DVD is not a stage performance even if it is based on one.
Staging and acting, all of the visuals are evidently extremely important in a DVD release and the Copenhagen Ring gives you decors to relish and acting on a very high and convincing level indeed. As in the Boulez Ring, the acting closely follows the music and specifically the text though it may sometimes appear to stretch the imagination a little too far. The film quality in itself is superb and so is the sound.
Speaking of sound, the orchestra is more than up to the task. No one I think expects this orchestra and this conductor to give the best-ever performance of Wagner's Ring on record. It is however more than adequate to deliver a good reading that never disappoints and often impresses.
There are moments when the singing (never less than adequate, often quite good) struggles without really succeeding to rise above the orchestra. It is noticeable and thus it is a blemish albeit a small one and more forgivable in a live performance than in a studio recording.
A few remarks on the side : Hagen acted splendidly but his voice was less impressive. Siegfried in Gtterdmmerung was not that strong either. Brnnhilde was great.
There was one scene that I thoroughly disliked : the Norns in the introduction to Gtterdmmerung really knew how to irritate me, making by exaggerated playacting a parody out of what could have been an original idea (casting the Norns as members of the audience), it simply does not fit in the whole and to me it stands out as a black spot on this otherwise quite excellently directed Ring.
I feared for even worse when the curtain rose on Siegfried and Brnnhilde's farewell scene and uncovered a sight that awakened horrified memories of Konwitschny's Gtterdmmerung (for those who watched it in the Stuttgart Ring) : you will see Siegfried donning an apron to start doing the washing-up ( la Konwitschny) but then Brnnhilde gestures him not to be silly and to take it off again, and the story starts at last to unfold again in a Wagnerian mould. So was this only a director's joke ? If so, I find it out of place in a production such as this one.
In short, this is a very good production and a very good DVD release with some weak moments that do not fundamentally alter the overall impression of a rewarding experience. If it weren't for the Norns, I'd give it overall five stars despite of a number of imperfections here and there. The first three parts of the cycle deserve five stars, the fourth only four (without counting the Norns) or three (when counting the Norns).
Should you watch this Ring ? Yes, absolutely.",1220227200,37,3428,4.539579967689822
3441726,5,B0019LZ19O,"The Royal Danish Opera clearly wanted to create for itself some international prestige, and went all out with a Ring production to compare to any other. There is a ton of scenery, a superb cast even without a single Big Star, wonderful conducting, and an intriguing director's concept. Even the most jaded Ring veteran will find many a detail to ponder--the Rhine gold as a naked swimming youth, or the way the ring leaves physical scars on those who wear it. By comparison, the Harry Kupfer Bayreuth staging is cheap and ponderous, with a kind of ""I'm Bayreuth, I don't have to have scenery"" feeling to it. Cheap, I call it. This one is elaborate and fascinating.",1219449600,16,664,4.683760683760684
3441727,3,B0019LZ19O,"I saw this Ring live in Copenhagen, and look forward to this souvenir of the production on DVD.  An interesting, modern interpretation with a decidedly ""feminist"" leaning: the whole story is essentially Brunnhilde's flashback on her family history, with her now pregnant at the end but spared immolation.

Cast was good-to very good, with the rising Theorin a more than acceptable Brunnhilde (she rises to Isolde this year at Bayreuth), James Johnson a servicable Wotan, and the energizer bunny Stig Andersen a known quantity as Siegfried (and I remember him also doing Siegmund in my cycle).  Direction is interesting, if not necessarily true to Wagner.

Let's hope they've included footage of the new Copenhagen house itself - one of the real reasons to visit!",1212796800,16,762,5.120967741935484
3441728,5,B0019LZ19O,"I am giving this production of The Ring the full 5 stars.  There is little that I can add to the reviews that have praised this production.  Certainly there are a few quibbles, but from my point of view, it has more than succeeded as a work of art.

I get more than somewhat disappointed when I read reviews that casually dismiss directors' concept (regietheatre) as eurotrash.  Granted that some productions fail  and some succeed; but rather than dismiss the failures out of hand, one should try to see what the director is trying to say in his/her interpretation.  In other words, using this production of a work of art as a stimulus to thought and insights.

Most great works of art are sufficiently ambiguous as to lend themselves to many different interpretations.  Look at the plays of Shakespeare for example.  Nothing should be cast in stone, as it were.  Not only has the zeitgeist changed since the original, but in theatre the stage mechanics have changed, and now there are movies and DVD's.  As another example, who would want to go back to obese sopranos with horned helmets who cannot act?

That is why I believe that the Copenhagen Ring has been extremely successful.  It has provoked a very high level of debate about this production in the reviews, both for and against.  Surely that is a good thing.  We go back to thinking about Wagner and what he might have meant, whether we agree with that, whether it is possible to make a different interpretation more in keeping with our times and whether this particular production has hit home in any way.

At the other extreme is what might happen with the planned Robert Lepage production of The Ring for the Met.  He is a very talented designer and director.  But much of his work has been with Cirque de Soleil.  His concept for the Berlioz ""Le Damnation de Faust"" was spectacular, but people came away talking about Lepage and not the work per se.  I suspect that is what will happen with the Met Ring.  That is not necessarily a bad thing -- it will bring a lot of people to see the production, some of whom might never have been exposed to Wagner.  But spectacle per se is not what Wagner had in mind.

Wagner might have disliked this production, given the fact that he was quite autocratic and controlling.  On the other hand, he was flexible in his work; so perhaps he would loosen sufficiently to appreciate the Copenhagen Ring as a great gesamtkunstwerk.",1276387200,3,2427,4.603729603729604
3441729,4,B0019LZ19O,"A Dane myself one could say that I am almost contractually obligated to love this Ring, but though I can't for a moment deny that this production has been a cultural exertion of a magnitude so far unheard of in this small country - and one crowned with considerable success - I still have serious reservations about a great many things when it comes to its conceptual scope.

Wagner's ""Der Ring des Nibelungen"" is without a doubt the most spectacular and demanding, longest and most complex work ever written for the stage. In fact, when it was first performed in Bayreuth in 1876, the composer was indeed the first to remark that he doubted anybody would ever be able to stage it in a fashion that would render it justice the way it was originally conceived. Since that time a good many have tried ... and some rather more successfully than others. The first production I took in was the so called ""Centenary Ring"" staged in Bayreuth in 1976 by the French film director Patrice Ch&eacute;reau, and as such his version, with its tense drama, brutality, and naturalistic depiction of violence, will always be something of a reference to me. Unfamiliar as I then was with the traditional ways of staging this work, I found the use of costumes and set pieces from the age of industrialisation during the last half of the nineteenth century quite fitting (after all, that is when the operas were composed), and the rantings and howls of ""sacrilege"" trumpeted by the traditional Wagner fans left me utterly unmoved. As such I should feel great sympathy for Kasper Bech Holten, the producer of this Copenhagen version, who in conversation with our Queen (second disc of ""Die Walk&uuml;re"") claims intending his staging for those whose minds are ""not tied by traditional views of the operas"". I frankly wonder if an audience that liberal can be found at all these days, but mostly the remark to me certainly raises the greater question: won't these poor, unspoiled opera-goers be terminally confused when almost nothing in the sets or the action corresponds with what is sung anymore?

It was, I think, agreed early on that the lack of dwarves and (especially) giants who could sing the various parts left producers certain liberties of interpretation, and with the Boulez/Ch&eacute;reau Ring (Bayreuth 1976-1981) the much loved (but often ridiculed) tradition of using viking-inspired horns and hairdos was laid to rest once and for all. This production, however, retained the props (ring, weaponry, etc.) mentioned constantly in the text - and to great and dramatic effect. The action still took place in some mythical age and thus made the use of medieval pictures and phrases somewhat plausible, but when you specifically set the action in the twentieth century (in the Copenhagen case from the 1920s to the 1990s) you unavoidably run into a s..tstorm of trouble coming up with explanations for all those annoying anachronistic tools, such as helmets, spears and swords, that you can't exclude just because they don't fit the new general concept. Holten is not the first to wrestle with these problems, but I am sorry to say that he has had no more luck than most other present-day directors coming up with consistent solutions. A man brandishing a sword in the middle of a cluster of uniformed sociopaths armed with automatic rifles is inherently silly (and to boot wide open to the old joke about bringing a knife to a gunfight!), and I seriously doubt there is - or ever will be - much anybody can do about that. On top of this I always wince when I hear the word ""hammer"" and see a pump-gun, or the word ""armour"" and see wings with black feathers on them. Also many of Holten's personal touches and original ideas - a white dove being let loose before somebody goes into a coma, or sleeping people (being continually refered to as ""sleeping"") walking about the stage wide awake - seem to me contrived pastices that fall on barren ground in my mind. Likewise, the decision to leave the sword-pulling in ""Die Walk&uuml;re"" to Sieglinde is one of those seemingly modernist and anti-sexist gestures that by its very superfluity (not to mention going completely against the narrative of the entire opera up to that point) falls pancake flat on its face. In me such pretentiousness only provokes a kind of embarrassed titter; it represents what I tend to call ""artistic cramp"", i.e. a neurotically irrepressable urge to do something in a new way, though it is in fact totally unnecessary and, to make things worse, in all likelihood less satisfactory than the way things have been done so far. I know I'm probably fighting windmills here, but looking ahead I all but expect to see the first act of ""Siegfried"" set in a nunnery - with Mime in drag - and, unstopable evolution or not, that is leaving artistic license open to justified ridicule. When taking in this production for the first time I was sorely tempted to use the old phrase often quoted in the entertainment industry: there was much good and much new in the play ... only the good wasn't new and the new wasn't good - but, in all fairness, that is not altogether true. Some things do work, and some actually work very well; only a pity so much else goes down in flames most horribly ... given the end of ""G&ouml;tterd&auml;mmerung"", no pun intended.

Now, you could say: this does not sound like a review that ends in four stars, and normally you'd be absolutely right, but this ""Ring"" has one colossal upside to it. It is on the whole - and I write this with utter conviction - dramatically as well as vocally one of the best ""Ring""-versions in existence on DVD and CD alike. There literally (and MOST unusually for a big Wagner-production) isn't a bad performance within eye- or earshot! Some like Sten Byriel (Alberich), Christian Christiansen (Fafner), and Stig Fogh Andersen (Siegmund/Siegfried) are merely doing quite OK, but others like Ir&eacute;ne Theorin (Br&uuml;nhilde), Randi Stene (Fricka), Stephen Milling (Fasolt/Hunding), and Guido Paevatalu (Gunther) excel and have not been seen or heard better for decades. And shining incandescently over them all is the magnificent true-barytone Wotan of James Johnson, defying belief in combining the gut-wrenching dramatic intensity of Sir Donald McIntyre with the vocal splendour and faultless German diction of Sir John Tomlinson. His performance in the third act of ""Die Walk&uuml;re"" in particular is second to none, and leaves him on a par with masters like Hotter and Adam. Only the Hagen of Peter Klaveness presents a voice slightly too weak for the job; he makes up for his vocal deficiencies by his first rate acting, though. The orchestra, very professionally led by Michael Schnwandt, lacks a bit of the edge a Levine might have produced, but it in no way detracts from the overall emotional punch, which is considerable.

Wagner used to say that for his operas he prefered actors who couldn't sing to singers who couldn't act; I sometimes wonder if he ever met anybody who in his opinion mastered both. Anyway, he would have truely loved this cast!",1262649600,7,7075,4.854304635761589
3441730,1,B0019LZ19O,"It might surprise Americans to learn that after all of the years since World War II, there are still many non-German Europeans who are bitter about the Nazis.  And since the Nazis liked Wagner, what better way to exact revenge on Germany than to destroy the art of the man who arguably is the most famous and popular German artist known to non-Germans around the world - Richard Wagner.  Surely there can be no better explanation for what Kasper Bech Holten has done in a deconstruction and reinvention of a work which, unlike the reinterpretations of men like Kupfer and Chereau, among many others, has destroyed the meaning of Wagner's art.

This ""Ring"" has been called many things - like the ""Alcoholics' Ring and the ""Feminists' Ring.""  But, in truth, it is not any kind of ""Ring"" at all since the words which Wagner wrote are ignored and the music which Wagner wrote doesn't mesh with the action taking place on stage.  Some characters who are supposed to die, don't.  Others die at times contradicting the libretto.

Speaking of what happens on stage during this so-called ""Ring,""  it should be mentioned that what Uffe Borgwart, as director of photography, has done in making this ""Ring"" available to us on video is even worse that what Holten did in designing the monstrosity in the first place.  When one sits in a theater, one can focus on what one wants - hopefully what Wagner wanted us to focus on.  But, one sees the whole stage and everything on it at the same time.  Moreover, as an audience member in a theater with a huge auditorium, one is so far away from the action on stage that one cannot see individual details.  In a production like this, individual details like extreme close-ups of the aged faces of Stig Anderson and Irene Theorin (who play Siegmund/Siegfried and Bruennhilde) or the genitals of the nude man who ""acts"" the role of the Rhinegold itself are to be avoided.

Holten's concept begins stupidly enough thus:  ""Bruennhilde has just betrayed the man she loves more than anything in the world.  Now she wants to find out how it came to this.  She seeks back to the beginning, to her father's attic to find the family mementos, and she starts to recall how it all began.""  This concept is stupid because more than any other character in the ""Ring,"" Bruennhilde already knows exactly why EVERYTHING in the ""Ring"" happened!  At this point in Holten's story, audience members would be justifiably confused as to why Alberich's arm is contained in a jar in Wotan's attic.  We see Bruennhilde in the ""Ring"" videos, at every point when no one is singing, searching through Wotan's many scrap books (which contain many newspaper articles) and photo albums.

Then, Holten takes us back 50 years earlier...and ""Das Rheingold"" begins.  The Rhine is a 1920's speak-easy.  The Rhinemaidens are dressed as flappers, who annoy Alberich by pouring vodka down his underwear.  In revenge, Alberich removes the heart of a nude young man (using a broken vodka bottle) who had been swimming in a fish tank installed in the wall of the speak-easy.  (It can easily be stated that Danny Olsen, as the gold, is the best-dressed performer in this Holten ""Ring."")

The next scene is at the gods' camp at the base of the Valhalla (a massive skyscraper) construction site.  Donner and Froh remain on stage during this entire scene.  All of the gods are smartly dressed - Wotan in a suit.  Fricka tells Wotan to ""awake,"" though he is busy working at a table with papers.  (The only god sleeping during the scene is Freia, who is having a bad Fasolt dream.)  Fasolt and Fafner descend to the gods' camp in a construction elevator.  No attempt was made at having either brother appear as a giant.  Fafner, grossly obese (a horizontal giant?), wears a white suit and black top hat.  He is in a wheelchair.  His brother, Fasolt, wears bib overalls.  Donner's ""hammer"" is a shotgun.  Fafner lights the chain-smoking Loge's cigarette with a lighter.  Loge takes photos as Fasolt and Fafner leave the site with Freia.  Otherwise, Loge photographs and writes down in his notebook everything that happens.  Wotan finds the strength to visit Alberich's home with Loge because Wotan secretly kept one of Freia's apples, which he alone eats.  (Having seen more than a dozen Fasolts in productions all over Europe and in the United States, I must say how impressed I was with Stephen Milling's performance as Fasolt.)

This ""Ring"" is unique in history for many reasons and it bears mentioning that the ""ring"" here is not a ring, but a winding arm band.

To get the ring, Wotan cuts off Alberich's whole arm in Wotan's torture chamber.  Freia returns to Valhalla with Fasolt and Fafner wearing a wedding dress and veil.  Erda flirts with Wotan and she drops her handkerchief for his benefit.  Fafner kills his brother with Fafner's cane.  Donner's ""hammer"" sound is the fall of the curtain partially obscuring Valhalla.  Loge plays a tape recording of the Rhinemaidens for Wotan.  In response, Wotan kills Loge with his spear and he also destroys the tape recorder.  (Though not dying off-stage at the end of ""Goetterdaemmerung,"" as Wagner intended, Loge is called-upon by his murderer in the next opera to ring Bruennhilde's home with fire.)

""Die Walkuere"" is set in the `50s.  Sieglinde and Hunding live in an upper-class house (with no trees indoors).  Sieglinde appears in a period dress with lipstick, a pearl necklace, bracelet, and earrings.  Siegmund arrives in a three-piece suit with a tie and coat.  Hunding is likewise dressed - only his coat has a fur collar.  Siegmund breaks the wall of windows with a chair to get into the courtyard, where the tree and sword are to be found.  Sieglinde pulls the sword from the tree herself without Siegmund touching it.  (This, among other things, is why some call Holten's ""Ring"" ""vision"", the ""Feminist Ring."")  Bruennhilde, until later defrocked by her father, wears black angels' wings.  In Wotan's huge Valhalla factory floor are four white tombstone-like objects with the letters S, S, F and H on them.  Wotan smashes the Siegmund stone during his long conversation with Bruennhilde.  Sieglinde is awake and attentive during Bruennhilde's conversation with Siegmund.  (More empowerment of women.)  Sieglinde sleeps only after Bruennhilde leaves Siegmund and Sieglinde alone before the battle with Hunding.  Hunding stabs Siegmund in the back with a knife.  Hunding does not die.

The Walkuere sisters drink wine from a bottle.  They wear bloody evening gowns.  Wotan carries a suitcase in one hand as he approaches the Walkuere's rock.

According to Holten: ""Sieglinde is the first woman to break the male dominance...And she becomes a kind of role model for Bruennhilde.""

""Siegfried"" is set in 1968.  Mime's house is two stories and a basement.  The opera begins with Mime tapping at his manual typewriter, rather than at the newest sword for Siegfried.  When Siegfried demands a sword, Mime hands him a table knife.  Wotan visits, bringing pastry for his grandson, but no spear.  Throughout the first Act, Wotan, Mime, and Siegfried go up and down the home's spiral staircase - for no apparent reason other than to show-off Siegfried-the-teenager's bedroom.  Mime hallucinates that the flickering TV screen is Fafner the dragon.  Siegfried cuts the TV in half with his newly forged sword.

At Neidhoehle, a young Hagen waits with Alberich at the entrance to Fafner's cave.  Alberich tape-records Wotan's promise not to interfere.  Wotan takes pictures of Alberich and Fafner's cave with his camera.  Fafner, from his underground cave, speaks to Wotan and Alberich through above-ground loud speakers.  Mime warns Siegfried of Fafner's murderous traits by reading to Siegfried from the Neidhoehle travel guide.  Siegfried is thirsty before the fight with Fafner and he tries to take the poisoned thermos from Mime, who gives him a bottle of water instead.  Siegfried brings a flute, as well as his horn, with him to Neidhoehle in his backpack.  Hagen approaches Siegfried to hear him play the horn and Hagen, unnoticed by Siegfried, pretends to shoot Siegfried with an imaginary pistol, as he had earlier done with his father.  Mime, Alberich, Hagen, and Wotan watch on-stage as Fafner initially communicates with Siegfried through the loud speakers.  Siegfried climbs down into Fafner's cave.  Fafner sits at a control panel, which operates tentacles which attack Siegfried.  Fafner, in human form, wears the ""ring"" bracelet.  Siegfried stabs Fafner in the back with his sword.  Back above ground, Mime prepares a picnic for Siegfried.  Mime briefly has both the ring and Tarnhelm in his hands before being killed by Siegfried.  Siegfried neither brings Mime's body to Fafner's, nor Fafner's to Mime's, though he sings that he is doing so.  Siegfried has to keep repeatedly licking Fafner's blood on his shirt in order to understand the woodbird.  The woodbird is a white dove who flies about perfectly as the scene ends.

Wotan brings a bunch of roses and a bottle of champagne to Erda's apartment.  He knocks on her door in the middle of the night.  Erda is old and very ill and needs her nurse to help her walk.  Erda caresses a framed picture of Bruennhilde.  Erda quickly goes back to bed after showing Wotan his face in a hand mirror.  As he is leaving Erda's apartment, Wotan places Bruennhilde's photo on the dying Erda's breast.

Wotan sits at a roadside table drinking beer as he waits for Siegfried. He's had several by the time Siegfried finally arrives.  It's quite an unusual path on which Wotan and Siegfried meet.  The walls of the path are lined with large books.  And the path is bordered with a high chain-link fence with barbed wire on top.  Wotan wears no hat, though Siegfried mentions it, until Siegfried places it on Wotan's head.  Wotan stumbles around - drunk - and he breaks his own spear in half before Siegfried can touch it with his sword.  Siegfried goes through a hole in the fence to get to Bruennhilde's apartment - a tiny room on a snow-covered roof of a much larger building.  Siegfried removes the black wings on Bruennhilde's breast which Wotan had torn from her body and placed over her at the end of ""Walkuere.""  They are NOT made of iron, as Siegfried says as he cuts them with his sword.  Siegfried is so afraid as Bruennhilde awakes that he hides outside the roof-top room to wait for her to appear.  Bruennhilde opens her suitcase, from which she examines a wedding veil.  (There is no clue as to how the suitcase got there...or whom had packed it and when.)  Bruennhilde undresses as Siegfried takes a blanket out of his backpack and lays it on the floor, where they eventually embrace.

As ""Goetterdaemmerung"" begins, the Norns stand from their seats in various locations in the audience.  There is no rope.  Instead, they tell of the past by reading from production programs, Wagner books and libretti.  The Norns eventually all meet on-stage - in front of the curtain.  They sing of a future Wotan plunging his spear splinters into Loge's chest - the fire from which causes all of the world ash tree logs in Valhalla to ignite, destroying the sacred hall of the gods, as well as the gods themselves.  (They say this in spite of the fact that Wotan, according to Holten, had murdered Loge on-stage at the end of ""Rhinegold."")  One of the Norns shows a picture of Cosima Wagner when the Norn sings of going to her mother.  Another Norn dons a metal helmet.

Bruennhilde's one-room apartment, which had, earlier in the opera, been very drab and contained only seven wooden chairs and a table, now looks like a botanical garden with live plants all over the place.  The dove from the last opera is now in a cage in the apartment.  Bruennhilde's hair, which was white in the last opera, is now blonde.  Siegfried listens to the baby in Bruennhilde's womb.  Siegfried wears an apron as he waters the plants.

Now-adult Hagen is working out - doing push-ups and pressing weights in the Gibichung penthouse.  He wears the uniform of a general.  Beret-wearing soldiers with automatic weapons stand guard on the balcony.  Having arrived in Gibichung, Siegfried tries to call Bruennhilde on his cell phone and leaves a message.  Siegfried drinks a bottle of whiskey and can barely walk as he leaves the penthouse with Gunther to fetch Bruennhilde.  After Siegfried and Gunther leave, Hagen holds his open hand over a burning cigarette lighter for a long time.

Back at Bruennhilde's home, she keeps the ""ring"" on her kitchen table and only puts it on after Gunther talks of wedding her.  Minutes earlier, when Bruennhilde was visited by her sister, Waltraute had shown Bruennhilde photos of the depressed gods, but Bruennhilde still refused to give the ""ring"" to the Rhinemaidens.  When Gunther arrives, a shocked Bruennhilde tries to call Siegfried on her corded phone.  Bruennhilde shows Gunther her baby-swollen belly, but it does not affect him.  Gunther takes off the Tarnhelm and reverts to Siegfried's form as the scene ends.  He's surprised to see his own picture on Bruennhilde's kitchen table.

The second act of ""Goetterdaemmerung"" begins in a well-lit classroom.  A standing Alberich lectures his seated son, Hagen, from the blackboard.  Hagen kills Alberich with a knife as the scene ends.  Siegfried arrives back in Gibichung driving a new convertible.  Hagen summons the vassals with a walkie-talkie.  The Gibichung men are dressed as terrorists - with faces covered and with automatic weapons.  The ""beasts"" the vassals are told to kill to celebrate Gunther's wedding are blindfolded hostages.  Hagen shoots all of the hostages in their heads.  Hagen gives cocaine to the vassals.  Hagen's ""spear"" is a rifle with a bayonet attached.

During the hunt, Siegfried falls asleep in the ruins of the speakeasy from ""Rhinegold.""  The now-homeless, aged Rhinemaidens appear to Siegfried in a dream.  In the dream, Siegfried gives the ""ring"" to the Rhinemaidens.  But, they give it back to Siegfried.  Hagen surreptitiously gives Siegfried's sword to a soldier, who hides it.  Immediately after Hagen mortally wounds Siegfried with the bayonet, everyone leaves the stage excepting Siegfried and Bruennhilde.  Siegfried sings his dying words to her alone.  Back at the Gibichung penthouse, Gutrune tries to call Bruennhilde on her cell phone before the hunting party arrives with Siegfried's body.  Hagen shoots Gunther with a pistol and then runs away when Bruennhilde prevents him from taking the ""ring"" from Siegfried's body.  The scene changes to Wotan's attic.  Wotan sits with his back to the audience in a high-backed chair with his broken spear in his lap.  Siegfried's body is on the attic floor.  Bruennhilde sings to Wotan and he dies.  (Holten gives us no clue as to how Bruennhilde and Siegfried's body get from Gibichung to Valhalla.)  Two of Bruennhilde's Walkuere sisters arrive in Wotan's attic and discover their dead father.  They weakly try to prevent Bruennhilde from using a lit candle to set fire to the books in the attic after Bruennhilde removed Siegfried's ""ring"" from his arm and placed it on top of a stack of books.  Then, Bruennhilde leaves Valhalla to deliver her baby.  The whole attic is quickly in flames.  Hagen appears in the burning attic and searches for the ""ring.""  The final words sung in the ""Ring:"" ""Away from the ring,"" according to Holten, are sung not by Hagen to the Rhinemaidens, but by Hagen to the fire.  Hagen grabs the burning ring and his arm catches on fire and he dies.  No Rhinemaidens appear.  In silhouette, we see the gods burning.

After the fire, we see Bruennhilde standing on a bare stage in front of a huge sun.  She is holding her naked baby and smiling.  Holten justifies ignoring Wagner's intent with the following words: ""We could not bear the idea that Bruennhilde was to meet her death on her husband's pyre, as is traditionally the case.  The purpose of a woman's life should be far greater than simply to perish with her husband.  And we need to put an end to the librettists' traditional habit of redeeming masculine sexuality by sacrificing heroines...""

What a mess!  Surely Wagner is spinning in his grave.  Surely that was Holten's intent.",1254700800,28,16213,4.89485294117647

The staging (despite some of the complaints - Alberich's missing hump, for instance) was interesting to disturbing to brilliant. The acting was superb, probably the best I've seen. I was quite fond of Siegfried in Rheingold as a zygote or blastocyst - or, perhaps, merely a cosmic idea. The Walkuren were magnificent... I enjoyed everything most of you wrote (which I didn't read before I bought this Ring - I never do). This is to me a most thrilling staging. I loved it.",1246320000,2,547,4.649484536082475
3441732,4,B0019LZ19O,"I am of two minds about the Copenhagen Ring.  Musically and dramatically, it is a truly exceptional offering from a smaller opera house that is blessed with a very good cast and nuanced orchestral playing.  It is, as far as acting, one of the most heartfelt Rings on dvd, at its best when showcasing the wonderful drama and profound feeling of Wagner's work.  It also allows a number of directorial fancies that deviate from Wagner's text and could easily have ruined the production; however, I am amazed, for all that, at just how much it succeeds nonetheless.

And where it succeeds, it succeeds brilliantly.  While one might not agree with every textual addition or subtraction, one can't help being caught up in the vision it presents, or appreciating its overall intelligence and coherence; whatever else, it presents a unified and unique reinterpretation of Wagner's masterpiece, if not one totally true to form.  In contrast to interpretations that seem to offer alterations that don't particularly fit into any broader scheme, nothing in the Copenhagen Ring is random.  It all fits into the overall interpretative framework, and in doing so, catapults itself instantly into a higher class of production than those that throw in anachronistic changes in time period or situation without rhyme or reason.  The production does do much that is challenging and different, beginning with its very opening premise:  clutching a single candle for light, Brunnhilde enters a musty library stacked from floor to ceiling with books.  Steadfastly, determinedly, almost desperately, she sifts through the reading in search of the answers that will unveil the truth of her family's history and the convoluted path that has led to her betrayal by the greatest of heroes--and her betrayal of him in turn.
In many ways, this backstory doesn't particularly add new insight into The Ring.  Nevertheless, presenting The Ring as Brunnhilde's discovery of the past is an interesting, rather humanizing idea--and certainly presents a captivating tableau as the familiar e flat chord of the prelude dawns in the orchestra and we watch Brunnhilde emerge from the shadows with her torch--and manages to stay mostly in line with the spirit of The Ring.  The decision to place the operas in a determinate time period has always truck me as anathema to any good Ring production.  And yet, the setting of the Copenhagen Ring in the various decades of the twentieth century--progressing from the 1920's in Rheingold (the Rhine maidens are flappers, of course) to the 1990's in Gotterdammerung--mostly works, leaving you constantly wondering how the director is going to pull off the next act and genuinely excited to see the ensuing part of the staging.  I can't help feeling this specificity of time period limits the scope of the piece, fettering the universality of its mythological underpinnings to too concrete a context--but I'll talk more about the downside of the production in a moment.  And all things considered, as well-conceived and implemented as it all is, it mostly works very well.

The numerous other amendments to the text achieve various degrees of success.  While I am not normally in favor of altering a work that I consider so complete as it is, there are moments when changes can be used to poignant effect.  The Valkyries, for instance, are fancifully portrayed with cherub-like wings.  At the end of Walkure when Wotan annuls Brunnhilde's divinity, he tears hers off; as he moves to kiss away her godhead, a radiant white dove appears within their folds.  Brunnhilde stoops to pick it up, tenderly caresses it in her hand, and then finally sends it flying away.  The bird then reappears in Siegfried as the woodbird that guides the hero to Brunnhilde's rock, an ingenious and altogether moving touch.  Similarly, the symbolic portrayal of the Rhinegold as an innocent, beautiful youth is deft and powerful.  When the theft of the gold is depicted by Alberich pitilessly tearing out the young man's heart, the grisly scene drives home the sheer brutality of Alberich's crime against nature with imagery that could not be more potent.  The violence is shocking, as it should be.  Other touches, such as having Sieglinde withdraw Nothung from the world ash tree instead of Siegmund, are less effective and sometimes downright silly.

Minor changes to the text aside, what hurts this production the most--and this is why I feel incapable of giving it, as much as I have enjoyed it, a full five stars--is the anemic, over-humanizing touch employed towards the more heroic, mythological elements, particularly the characterization of Wotan.  That probably sounds paradoxical, as any successful Wotan ought to be intensely human and resonant with the audience.  However, there is a point where too much humanizing can detract from a hero's mythological stature, and in doing so, actually render him less sympathetic.  This has become one of the aesthetic plagues of the modern age, where the heroic characters of romanticism, representing dramatized expressions of the best and worst within us, are viewed as unrealistic, divorced from the life of the modern man.  The unfortunate result of this is that in the name of realism, heroes are bled down to some vague view of the `common man', someone presumably indicative of the folks next door; in pursuit of this, no one is allowed to be too grand--after all, we're all human and flawed, aren't we?  The downside to this is that the characters of romantic works of art appeal to us precisely because they represent not a carbon copy of the idiot next door, but rather what is important to us, our own virtues and foibles portrayed on a dramatized, monumental scale.  The great heroes of art endure not because we see them in the street every day but because of what they represent; we recognize in them what is noblest (and sometimes worst) about us, and this adds to our humanity as much as theirs.
So conceived, *this* is the essence of Wotan.  He is heroic and noble, emblematic of our own personal struggles and contradictions but dramatized on a much grander, mythological scale.  Our individual paradoxes and shortsightedness impact our lives; his wreak havoc throughout all of existence.  And we only really care about it all if we feel we can relate to him, understand his struggle and why he made the choices he has made, even if the consequences of his actions have a slightly larger sphere of influence than our own.  And if we don't care about Wotan, the whole thing is pretty much over from the start; as much as this Ring presents itself as Brunnhilde's story, it can't help revolving around Wotan and the decisions he made before the opening bars of Das Rheingold even sound.  And one of the great disappointments about the Copenhagen Ring is that in Das Rheingold, we don't give much of a damn about Wotan.  He has been brought hopelessly down to earth--not only does the specificity of chronological context (he is some sort of gangster-like industrialist, by the look of it) detract from his status as the chief of the gods, he is characterized as something of a monster.  Here is a Wotan who doesn't just kidnap Alberich--he chains him up in what can only be a torture chamber, replete with a tray of medical syringes which he fingers devilishly during the `interrogation'; when it comes time to claim the ring as his own, he is not content to simply extract it from Alberich's chained hand, but slices off Alberich's entire arm as Loge looks on in horror.  (Yes, even Loge is presented as a moral authority over Wotan in this particular Rheingold.)  He is utterly unsympathetic as a character, and this is precisely what one does *not* want to achieve at the beginning of The Ring.

Fortunately, there is enough of interest in Rheingold to hold one's attention despite the thuggish characterization of Wotan, and the rest of the operas improve from there.  Walkure is intensely heartfelt, Siegfried rather clever (the vision of Siegfried and Mime living together in a suburban house in the late 1960's is delightfully absurd, and it's to the director's credit that it manages to succeed as well as it does), and Gotterdammerung concludes with a fundamental deviation to the ending that, even if it will doubtless cause purists to groan, is about as good as directorial fancy is going to get.  It changes things on a profound level, but for the Ring veteran, it's a refreshing surprise, and certainly a happier one than, for instance, the abrupt and unwelcome appearance of random people watching the end of the world on television screens at the end of the Kupfer/Barenboim production.

Musically, however, it doesn't match up to Kupfer/Barenboim, or several other of the major dvd recordings.  I have mostly focused on the mechanics of the production in my review, as that is what is bound to most interest prospective Wagnerian buyers who are curious about a new staging; having said that, the quality of the music is of course of paramount importance, and while the Copenhagen Ring is mostly very good, the orchestra simply doesn't soar the way that of Bayreuth or the New York Met does.  Even so, the orchestra mostly presents a solid and beautiful account of the score--if some of the grandiosity is lost, surely the more lyrical sections are played with tenderness and an immensity of feeling--and the majority of the singers do ample justice to their roles.  To the most part, what a given singer lacks in vocal power, he or she makes up for with superb acting and emotion; the production is certainly one of the very best in terms of successful drama and direction.  And there are a few world-class standouts in the midst of a generally solid cast; Irene Theorin in particular is a superb Brunnhilde, and Stig Andersen does an admirable job as both Siegmund and Siegfried.  There are moments when the orchestra drowns out the singers (always a risk in Wagner, I suppose), as well as times when the power and majesty of Wagner's vision is dimmed and simply not quite able to reach the sweeping heights of which the music is capable.  There are nevertheless many memorable and truly beautiful scenes, and particularly given that the orchestra does not have the world-class Wagnerian stature afforded the likes of Bayreuth or the Met, it actually is astoundingly good, certainly worthy of much commendation for these performances.

So for all that, despite the stated reservations, I was very impressed by the Copenhagen Ring and would absolutely recommend it to those who want to experience a reinterpreted, non-traditional account of the operas.  Those who are strict textual interpretationalists and would consider it a crime not to include all the magic of a resplendent rainbow bridge leading to a fantastical Valhalla crowning the sky in all its mythical glory would do well to look elsewhere (see Otto Schenk's just about flawless romanticized production).  For those who are of a slightly more open mind, those who, as in my case, have seen and own a number of Ring Cycles and are interested in experiencing those that are less stringently traditional, this is surely as good as it gets.",1245888000,7,11165,4.954983922829582

When I saw the Met's Ring dvd set it opened my eyes to why so many people love this work. This Copenhagen Ring is completely different....almost a polar opposite of the Met's Ring. Still, I decided to give it a shot. I figured the price of the entire set was less than tickets to actually see a Ring. I actually loved this Ring. It makes you laugh a lot, and it is full of surprises. Just when I thought I wouldn't be surprised again, I was.  This is a Ring that does not take itself too seriously, and you actually realize that there is humor in the Ring. However, there are very touching moments in this production also. I highly recommend it. It is a lot of fun and still touches you concerning the whole drama.",1242518400,2,850,4.279503105590062
3441734,3,B0019LZ19O,"Wagner's glorious music, sung and played very well, are worth five stars but I have deducted two for the staging.  Set in the 20th century;  to me, not only does it not work, but it is silly.  No changes have been made to the libretto, and Albrecht is described as a hunch-backed dwarf while we can see him there with nothing visibly wrong with his back, and in height what most Europeans would call medium to tall;  Siegfried is about the same height - is Seigfried a dwarf?  There seems to be no relevance to the Rhine, and the gold is a beautiful young man.  Quite a few of the scenes are quite acceptable to a purist like me, but others which did grip me were spoilt by minor points.  One such is when Wotan is about to put Brunnhilde to sleep - she pops out of the plastic penthouse (pent-tent?) and brings back a suitcase.  The flight of the Valkyries is also good.  Siegfried is a bit too old to be convincing - at first sight he appears to be a middle-aged thug.  Forging Nothung - OK, but how many houses in the middle 20th century had a smithy in the basement?  (But I liked Mime's brewing, floating round the kitchen swigging down white wine, I think four glasses.)  The immolation scene is excitingly well done, even if there is no Rhine to rise up and flood everything (and the ""Rhine"" maidens are not there to get their gold back).  Recommended if one is not a purist, but if one wants the original mythical setting, avoid it.",1237939200,9,1440,4.3283582089552235
3441735,5,B0019LZ19O,"'Eurotrash' is an odd, rather dismissive term. It's bandied around by critics of non-traditional productions of classic operas, particularly if the director's interpretation differs from that of the reviewer.

I'm going to modify this slightly. After all, the latest Bayreuth production of Meistersinger fits the above definition, but it isn't Eurotrash - it's just trash.

For the purposes of this review, let's define 'Eurotrash' as a production where the director feels that
-  His views are more important than those of the composer
-  The audience are far too jaded to appreciate a traditional production
-  All those gods and heroes aren't particularly relevant to our modern age - let's introduce some good honest mediocrity; everyone can relate to that.
-  Opera doesn't have to be inspiring, just provocative
-  Keep it shallow; these days people don't understand 'deep'
-  When all else fails, make fun of your audience

However, and this is very important, if the director actually understands the source material, and has the integrity to make the best possible interpretation (within his world view), Eurotrash isn't necessarily a bad thing.

By this definition, the Copenhangen Ring is an excellent example of Eurotrash, and would be a worthy addition to the collection of any Wagnerite who hasn't yet acquired a specimen - far better than the Stuttgart travesty, and actually quite entertaining, in an irritating kind of way.

There are some quite bizarre aspects of this performance. The most obvious is Kasper Bech Holten's decision to portray der Ring as a comedy!

Loge is a sleazy, chain-smoking lawyer, always looking for a light (he's the God of Fire, and doesn't have a light(har har))

When Wotan is quizzing Mime, he keeps glancing at a kichen knife, trying to influence Mime's choice of questions. You know, the same way that Harry Kupfer did it, but less subtle.

The Norns are portrayed as Wagnerites, sitting in the audience. When they talk about the past, they wave a copy of Wagner's autobiography. When Norn III complains that her view of the future is obscured by the actions of humans, the Norns hold up a picture of the director, with a placard denigrating 'regietheater'. (Ego showing a bit, old chap)
And for the hard of understanding, when they return to Mother, they show a picture of Cosima.(Laugh? I nearly started!)

And throughout, the characters drink like fish. When Siegfried finally catches up with Wotan on the mountain, he's sitting there surrounded by empties. Is the constant drinking a Danish thing? I vaguely remember Hamlet saying something of the sort.

There is some unnecessary gore, which seems to be a Eurotrash standard. Was it really necessary to remove Alberich's arm? Surely a spot of vaseline would have done the trick.

Add to this the obligatory, uninspiring, provincial drabness and squalor (maybe Eurodrab would be a better term than Eurotrash). Why oh why do European directors think this is a good thing!!!!

In its defence, this isn't actually a bad production.

There is a consistent dramaturgical vision, unlike Stuttgart. There are some liberties, including the presence of Brunnhilde in Rheingold, the death of Alberich, the non-death of Hunding, and of course, the ending..... but these don't detract from the composer's intent, I think.

With the exception of Susanne Resmar's Erda, sung with a strange, almost yodelling tone, the standard of singing is perfectly adequate, if not exactly stellar.

The acting, and general interpretation of the roles, was good. Stig Andersen ably stood up to the challenge of playing both Siegmund and Siegfried. James Johnson managed to preserve the dignity of Wotan despite the rather unpleasant makeup and costume. Michael Kristensen's Legal Loge was hilarious.

The orchestra was adequate, if occasionally out of its depth. The singers were drowned out a couple of times; perhaps Michael Schonwandt could take a few lessons from Barenboim. Tempos were fast, but they matched the general shallowness of the approach.

And as a bonus, there's a discussion between the director and the Queen of Denmark (who is a keen Wagnerite). How cool is that!

If you have all the traditional productions, and would like to see how the other half lives, give this one a shot. It won't be particularly inspiring, but you might find it entertaining.

If you think the Chereau Ring is controversial, give this one a miss.

And look out for the sequel: Son of Siegfried",1232582400,11,4465,5.082191780821918
3441736,5,B0019LZ19O,"Reactions to this Ring production have been varied; see other posted reviews. As with most ""modern"" productions, there are liberties taken with the settings, costumes, and interactions among the characters that may be stimulating or irritating to the viewer.  Rheingold takes place in the early 20th century (1920s?).  The maidens cavort about dressed as ""flappers"" in a nightclub; Alberich drinks like a fish; the gold is personified as a young adult male swimming in a lobster tank.  The first scene introduces three motifs that recur throughout this production:  booze (all the major male characters drink frequently -- no doubt a comment on their weakness), blood and brutality (besides the scripted deaths additional characters are bumped off, always in a graphic, brutal manner).  This is not a ""PG"" Ring.  As a Ring lover, I found most of this production entertaining and often provocative.  One effect of living in our time with video and audio recordings readily available is that a performance of the Ring is not a particularly unusual event.  To be special  productions have to introduce novel interpretations.  So far, thankfully, the music and libretto have not often been violated; that leaves the setting, costumes, and stage action as the domains for creative directors.  The major conceit in the Copenhagen production is the the idea that Brunnhilde seeks out the history of her predicament between Acts 2 and 3 of Gott.  The earlier operas become something of a flashback; she appears periodically (often during scene changes in the earlier operas) pouring over diaries and souvenirs (from Valhalla's library?) that recount the history of the ring.  Although great effort went into achieving this effect, for me all of this effort doesn't add or subtract much from the production.  And it certainly doesn't make the production a ""feminist"" Ring cycle.  The power relations are the same as any traditional production. (How could they be otherwise without changing the libretto?)  The men are clueless (Siegfried), short-sighted (Wotan), and evil (Hagan) as they make the decisions and wield power; wisdom rests with the women (Erda, Fricka, and eventually Brunnhilde) -- but that's just as true in traditional productions because that's what Wagner wrote.  There are a few touches that suggest a ""feminist take"" such as the sword pulling scene in Act1 of Walkure.  Brunnshilde's discovery of the history of the ring hardly makes the production a feminist one.  I have focused on this point because several reviewers suggest some radical feminist interpretation; by and large I didn't see it.  In addition, Brunnhilde is not so ignorant of the ring's history as this production implies; she gets much of the story from Wotan in the Act 2 monologue (Walkure) as well as from Waltraute in Act 1 of Gott.
Normally, I would not reveal a surprise ending but other reviewers already have; Brunnhilde appears at the beginning of Gott. visibly pregnant and delivers the child during the immolation scene; this makes for an uplifting, warm conclusion but hardly fits with Wagner's intent that the race of gods are destroyed at the end of the cycle (Brunnhilde and Siegfried are not ""pure"" humans)
Each succeeding opera in the series moves the action closer to the present era.  For example, in Gott. Siegfried returns from wooing Brunnhilde for Gunther in a Mercedes. For the most part, modernizing the production works and the similarity between the brutality displaced by Hagan and his minions to that we have observed in recent years in Bosnia, Iraq, and so forth is striking and can be unsettling (that's a compliment).  For me the most chilling scenes were the theft of the ring from Alberich in Rheingold and Hagan's watch in Gott.  Speaking of Hagan, many reviewers have applauded his acting but found his voice a bit weak.  Nevertheless, the evil 3 (Hagan, Alberich, Mime) were among the best singing actors in the production. Most of the cast did a fine job; not as brilliant as some of the classic audio Rings, but certainly more than competent.  Altough old timers like myself often wax nostalgic about Nilsson, Traubel, Varnay, or Flagstad, none of the aforementioned grand ladies (or comparable grand men of the past) could act (or more accurately were required to act) like the singers in this production.  I thought all the singers did a great job of acting and a very good job (more variable here) of singing.  The cast and production was worthy of any of the ""great"" opera houses.
The quality of the film is excellent; sharp images; vivid colors.  My only complaint is that because it is shot like a movie with multiple cameras and perspectives, the camera often jumps around excessively and there are too many way-too-close closeups.  Wny film makers think viewers enjoy seeing the pores of the actors and the fillings of open mouthed singers is beyond me.
Before closing, I want to single out the production of Siegfried. Often, this opera is considered the most difficult to bring off successfully.  In this production, the set was great and, for once, the opera moved along without dragging.
I've rambled too long, so to close, I recommend this Ring along with the recently released, but quite different, Amsterdam Ring to stand along with the Barenboim, Boulez, and Levine efforts.  It certainly may not ""click"" with some viewers (hence the wide range of opinions posted here), but it is never less than entertaining and thought provoking.",1229990400,37,5468,5.048943270300334

8274791,1,B0019LZ19O,"i'm surprised no one else has commented on the sound quality (or lack thereof).  there is no excuse for the poor sound quality of this production.  modern techniques could have made the singers clear, even if the orchestra went overly loud.  just correct the problem by editing the volume on the separate tracks.  loge was especially bad when he moved a few feet towards the back.
the problem got worse at the end of die walkure. they decided to put a walled room to serve as brunnhilde's cave on the fell.  solid walls.  and to make it worse, they put a dome on top.  the reverberation this created destroyed some beautifully lyrical passages from brunnhilde in die walkure, the end of siegfried and the beginning of gotterdammerung.

the performances were overall very good. until they got to gotterdammerung.  then, all of a sudden, there were no good singers left to support the wonderful siegfried and brunnhilde.  hagen, gunther and getrune were all awful.  one would expect gunther and getrune to maybe be weak, but hagan is crucial and needs to be top flight.  one could not tell how the waltraute did, since the orchestra was so loud one could not hear the singing in the echo chamber of brunnhilde's cave.

being of a somewhat conspiracy-minded bent, i noticed that except for rheingold, the sound issues were primarily affecting brunnhilde --- the echo chamber destroying her big moments (except the immolation).  as well as the orchestra blasting out waltraute's role (another woman).  fricka (wonderfully done by randi stene) was left alone, but she was playing a shrew.  brunnhilde's immolation had people running around on the stage, instead of letting her deliver the high-point straight up.

the traditional role of brunnhilde is very feminist in nature.  she is the one who, trying to implement wotan's will, is punished for it.
she is the one who, when the siegfried fails to save the world, then does the job herself.  she was the wise-woman who erda bore to wotan to be his advisor and guide him through all this.  after she gets rid of those troublesome men in her life, she can now see clearly again and comes up with the ultimate solution to the corruption caused by the ring.  brunnhilde redeems the world (you go, girl).
yet, this production reduces our heroine to a mere baby factory.  not a great warrior making the ultimate sacrifice for love.  and don't give me this c&^p about the next generation is our treasure.  the sacrifice needs to be made.  siegfried shattered the old law and brunnhilde completed the task to prepare the world for the next phase.
conclusion :  this production is done by a woman-hater.  maybe the conductor is in on it, too.  they demeaned and berated women, instead of allowing them their proper place in the opera.

8274792,2,B0019LZ19O,"When Richard Wagner began to develop the concept of his tetralogy, Der Ring des Nibelungen, he had his reasons for creating a very specific setting, for using different levels of underground life, humans and gods. Despite a fundamental rearrangement of the total architecture he had his reasons to select the players, their backgrounds, their fate, and not least the use of an old German language, further pronounced by a powerful Stabreim and the creation of descriptive new words. He had his reasons to use c minor for Siegfrieds mourning music and Brnnhildes noble A Major appearance to announce the end of the gods in Gtterdmmerungs final scene. Wagner had his dramatic reasons for devising his fallible heroes Siegmund and Siegfried, just as he had his reasons for creating the rainbow bridge, Brnnhildes rock, the dragon and Grane. The sum of all these reasons ultimately made for the most fascinating stage work ever conceived.

If one or more of these reasons are overruled, eliminated, rearranged or bent around different arguments in their meaning, things start to get difficult. The stage, or the music, or the text, and then the whole message of the work starts to run out of track, out of synchronization. The result can be a slight or a major incongruence, it can become ridiculous or absurd, but very rarely does it improve Wagners original. If the terror of Nibelheim isn't recreated as such, if the rainbow is omitted as an alter Zopf, if Siegmund stands by like a goofy idiot watching his sister and lover pulling Nothung out of the tree, if Alberich is changed into a drunkard and Mime into a nagging bureaucrat, things tend to derail somewhere, either on stage, in the suggestive music, in the context, or everywhere.

Such is the case here, in Mr Holtens Copenhagen attempt on Wagners Ring. At this point, facing todays reception culture, a defensive foot note is usually required: of course we are aware of the experimentation element, of the workshop suitability or even necessity of Wagners work  next year we approach everything differently. After all Wagner was the full-blooded theater and stage man, the dramatician par excellence. But to misuse this characteristic to embark on usually badly disguised ego trips by our present day directors, partly with the help of an audience segment that understands contemporary opera as Don Giovanni arriving on a Harley Davidson, or Pinkerton as a Vietnam general, may lead to grotesque results. And it sure does.

Wagner had his reasons to create Siegmund as a hero, hapless as he turned out to be, entangled in his fathers scheming. But Siegmund doesnt deserve to be changed into a helpless wuss, to create a background for a feminine Ring, or an emancipated Ring, or whatever. One major reason, of course, is the interdependence between Wagners text, music and stage proceedings. It has been observed that at times Wagners music says more than his protagonists on stage, or says it differently, or earlier. If one factor is changed in the formula, the result is wrong. Its as simple as that.

Carlus Padrissa in his Valencia Ring didn't try to rewrite Wagners tetralogy. While he used modern day settings and gadgets such as his cherry pickers on stage, he did it to signify different levels of the gods as opposed to dwarfs and humans. He refrained from interfering with the substance of Wagners multi-faceted story, and therefore didn't derail the work. There was and is no reason to start the tetralogy in a dusty attic with Brnnhilde sifting through family albums, thereby imposing a different background onto the story, replacing the pure E-flat Major nature of the original concept. A particularly blunt miscalculation is the point in time when Wotan rips off his favorite daughters Valkyrie wings. While basically a great dramatic idea if implemented at the right time, it occurs at a point where it totally contradicts the superb climax in the orchestra. Instead of shaking me, I found myself shaking my head. Im now certain that Mr Holten hasn't understood a thing about the inner architecture of The Ring.

Either way, the purely musical side of The Copenhagen Ring fits into the standard mold of todays provincial reproduction of this difficult and demanding work. Mr Schnwandts conducting produces a rather erratic flow with rare highlights, and without being able to create a specifically feminine pianissimo or emancipated climax to fit the declared aim of this Rings benders. While I initially thought the trio of (Rhine)maidens to offer a new approach, both in acting and singing, the standard of voices and orchestral contribution remained largely mediocre, not helped by changing Wotans performer and the total dischord between stage direction and score. In my ears, not in my eyes, the best contribution came from Stig Andersen in the rewritten role of Siegmund, but obviously the disconnect between his directed duty on stage and Wagners instructions didn't help my appreciation. And because the same largely applies to the rest of the product, I won't go into further details here.

Risking to be politically incorrect, I submit there are two main reasons for interfering with the very substance of an operas authentic text and concise stage instructions: the director, unlike the conductor, feels free or even obliged to impose his or her own ideas on a work, or in this case, sequence of works, to prove his own prowess and creativity. The director stands to share a good part of the creators fame, and may even hope to be seen as a great innovator by that certain consumer segment.

Secondly, theres that very consumer segment, bored to death by Werktreue (best translation: true to the original), an audience that expects short lived excitement and sensationalism in favor of a knowledgeable but demanding setting. If youve seen Klingsor as a transvestite cabaret director, you're considered artistically and socially advanced when you're able to tell your friends about it. Who cares about the old-fashioned substance of the work.

Of course this sort of review could be applied to a great number of other newer productions. Although for some reason Wagners work seems to be particularly enticing for fundamental overhauls by ego directors, maybe because a Scarpia or an Elektra are  in the best sense - more one-dimensional figures, other composers works are likewise exposed to the assistant fantasy of a modern director. It is interesting to see, however, that North American audiences, while more disneyfied and exposed to vulgarization, definitely are more conventionally inclined than their European counterparts, who appear to be under higher peer pressure for a liberal reception attitude. But that is certainly no excuse to operate with such pedestrian labels as Eurotrash, a clear sign of profound ignorance.

As with a number of other contributions along this vein, this production may have a certain right to exist if correctly labeled, say as A Paraphrase on Wagners Ring, by Kasper Bech Holten. It certainly fails as another version of the Bhnenfestspiel fr Drei Tage und einen Vorabend.",1393027200,,7098,5.07369323050557
8274793,2,B0019LZ19O,"It may be unfair of me to review this complete set of The Copenhagen Ring for the significant reason that I was unable to sit through it in its entirety.  Not because the ideas in it are so absurd or infuriating; I like some of them very much in fact.  The singers are all fine, more or less, as is the conducting and orchestral playing.  But I have never, never, never seen such an abysmally filmed live performance in my life.  First of all, the camera rarely stops for longer than half a minute.  There's so much movement from character to character that it's often impossible to know who's singing.  And the camera angles are bizarre to say the least.  We get shots of the backs of people's heads (not the people actually singing at the moment, by the way); shots from under tables; shots from backstage; shots from upstage facing down; shots from everywhere but where you actually want them.  There's no rhyme or reason to any of it, nor does it illuminate the staging in any reasonable or discernible way.  After a while, I gave up in pure frustration.  If you can rent this one before buying it, I would highly recommend doing so.",1372377600,7,1137,4.475728155339806
8274794,5,B0019LZ19O,"I love Wagner and the Ring and I'm aware of its faults, at times clunky dramaturgy and repetitive content. This production has solved all this and I was glued to my seat for 2 nights taking hardly a break between acts and music dramas. Siegfried was particularly great -- the one night I tend to like the least. In this production at last it was both dramatically and emotionally convincing.
The musical performance is solid but at times I wished some of the singers were of higher caliber.
Overall, I couldn't recommend it more strongly. A fantastic theatrical experience, and at time funny, too!!!",1361059200,,599,4.769230769230769

8274796,4,B0019LZ19O,"I must say I was quite surprised at how much I enjoyed this particular production given the modern take on it. I don't consider myself an opera purist but I do approach modern and non-traditional productions with trepidation given the trend to totally trash the works and the composer's original intentions. Is this production faithful to Wagner's intentions? Yes and no. You obviously can't remain completely faithful to the libretto and original setting by updating it to modern times, but I felt that this Ring still manages to remain faithful to Wagner's story.

To give you an idea where I'm coming from and my experience, I've seen the Met's Schenk production five times. I don't think I'll ever see a more perfect Ring production. In contrast, I could start a long diatribe on Lepage's claptrap of a production, but this isn't the place. Although Kasper Bech Holten updates this Ring to the 20th century, at no point did I ever think I wasn't watching a production of the Ring.

To successfully update a Ring, you need to add a lot of little details to fully establish the time period. You can't just do it half-heartedly. I will admit that there were certain things I didn't like and others where I wasn't sure just what the director was trying to convey, but overall for me, the production worked. More importantly, it made me think after I had finished viewing it. As long as you can tolerate a non-traditional take on the Ring, this one is worth a look.",1346544000,4,1464,4.692607003891051
8274797,1,B0019LZ19O,"Like Shakespeare wrote, ""How weary, stale, flat, and unprofitable...""

To endure watching this half-baked piece of dreck from the land of Hamlet, no less!

Another Eurotrash concept for bored musical illiterates out there...

First, the music. Conductor Schonwandt leads a sloppy, erratic performance. Often much too fast for the poor singers who struggle just to get all their words out. The first occurrence of the Giants motif is taken so fast, it might as well be a country gig, certainly not ""firmly measured"" like the composer indicated. (The short sixteenth notes almost sound double-dotted at this unreasonable speed). From the singers, the best impression vocally is the lovely voice of the Wotan, Johan Reuter. The rest are not much to write home about, and the top Rheinmaiden is just dreadful. Erda seems to have a fine voice, but the conductor merely had her sing mezzo voce with no support. What was the point of that?

But, by today's standards, these vocal forces might not be the deal breaker. That odious honor belongs to the Director. Kaspar Bech Holten was 36 years old at the time of this Copenhagen Ring, and judging by these videos, it is a pity he was ever allowed out of the sandbox.

I am truly saddened when I read viewers praising how these type of productions stimulate them and bring so much more insight and sensitivity than those hackneyed stagings of yesteryear etc etc etc.... I am saddened because these people are running away from encountering the music drama on its own terms, and the only way they will attend the opera house is if there is something controversial, shocking, or modernized. They trivialize the Ring by pasting on torturous symbols, equivalencies, hidden ""meanings"" by making it more ""relevant"" for us. At least, that is their stated purpose.

But to put it briefly, what the audience will come away with is not a deeper insight into Wagner and his music, but rather an undesired glimpse into the neurotic fetishes of the Directors.

Equally depressing, there are countless disconnects between music and ""concept"".

For example... Loge is the god of Fire, mercurial, brilliant, clever, mischievous. Wagner's music is quick-silver, constantly in motion with shimmering chromatic movement. How does that square with Copenhagen's dour-faced Loge, who gets bogged down with always scribbling down notes (hmnn, must be not too bright?) and constantly chain-smoking. The armchair intellectuals will say ""ah, he smokes because he is the god of Fire. I've made a connection. How clever!"" Well, I was just waiting for the god of Fire to keel over in a coughing and retching fit. Unwarranted and idiotic as the killing of Loge by Wotan was in the last scene, I admit I secretly enjoyed it because watching him smirk and scowl through the whole show made me want to throttle him myself.

Wotan... all powerful king of the gods?? Wotan, who in Die Walk&uuml;re kills Hunding with a contemptuous wave of his hand, here indulging in sadistic high school sport of burning his cigarette into the neck of the enchained Alberich? How regal is that? And pray tell, just what ""interesting"" does it tell you about Wotan's character? Also, to show Wotan on all fours selfishly gnawing on an apple is just distasteful and comical. No wonder Wagner did not indicate anything like that in his specific stage directions. If the Director and his admiring sheep want to play at opera, go ahead and write your own. Don't mess with genius.

(Tell me, how many aficionados of Mozart were out there in the general population before trendy ""Amadeus"" pictured him as a vulgar buffoon? Do we really need to have genius brought down to the mob level before we will listen?)

What does it really tell us to see Wotan pull Alberichs' pants down, or to see the buck-naked swimmer as the Rheingold in the first scene... except maybe some wish fulfillment on the part of Kaspar Bech Holten?

The three powerful scene interludes go for nothing as we are forced to watch the same intrusive and boring videos of Br&uuml;nnhilde thumbing through all those books in Wotan's library. (She is ""Wotan's Wille"" after all, she knows all Wotan's innermost thoughts and desires. Why on earth would she need to do research in a celestial Bibliotheca?) Non-existent is the primal thrill of the Rhein prelude building by wave and wave... gone is the terror of the Descent into Nibelheim and the later Ascent to Valhalla. When the ensemble of anvils occurs, it makes a pitiful impression like tinkling Jingle Bells.

I am a professional conductor and have encountered too much of this crap, especially in Germany. I once suggested to a Stage Director let's have a moratorium on all your ""concept""-driven stagings and instead allow conductors to substitute violins with synthesizers, and other instruments with bass guitars etc, and let's reverse all the tempos. She was not amused.

And then there is the irritating high school level of directing where the characters not singing are mouthing some other conversations to each other. I suppose this was to lend ""verisimilitude"" like they sing in Gilbert and Sullivan. What a poverty of imagination and resorting to common effects. Ugh! how amateurish.

I am posting this review only of Das Rheingold because I could not subject myself to watch the following operas. I suggest the same course for all.

However, if you would like to see how an intelligent approach can unite a vibrant, creative presentation and still keep true to Wagner and his music, try the Met's LaPage Ring or the Mehta Valencia Ring. Light years better than this turkey from Copenhagen.

Leave this tortured abortion of Teutonic ""intellectualismus"" to gather dust on the shelf where it belongs. This emperor has no clothes.",1341014400,11,5742,4.952182952182953
