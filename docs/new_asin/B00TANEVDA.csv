7003776,4,B00TANEVDA,"A fine  presentation.  Would have given it 5 stars, except that Stephen Ray used God's name in vain when he inadvertently stepped in camel dung. I believe ""J...."" should have been bleeped out.  Children will be watching this DVD and they do not need to hear the bad example of a very likable adult whom they might like to copy.",1433980800,2,327,4.416666666666667

7003779,5,B00TANEVDA,"As usual, Steve Ray continues one of the family's favorite non-fiction series in a very engaging, fun way.  Abraham was filmed before ISIS tore through the area; so it really was a blessing that they were able to film this series when they did.

If you are new to the series I highly suggest them all... while this was not my absolute favorite of the bunch, it was super good, as usual. Steven Ray is top notch when it comes to guiding you through the historical ""footprints"" of Abraham... he does tours as part of his work and you can tell; he is NOT boring, but super funny and engaging. Even my preschool aged daughter enjoys watching this with us.

I love how he goes into not only history, but Aplogetics; theology; Biblical studies, etc... these dvds are great for solid Catholics who want to learn more.  I highly recommend them!  Oh, the only disappointment is that I couldn't find the bloopers...  they have them in the extras on the other dvds and we were really looking forward to seeing them on this one.",1429920000,3,1016,4.494565217391305

8701155,5,B00TANEVDA,"Highly recommend this Footprints of God series! Steve Ray, with his enthusiasm and deep knowledge of the faith, takes you back in time to learn about salvation history in a highly entertaining way. Thank you Steve!",1490745600,,214,4.972222222222222
8701156,4,B00TANEVDA,"Footprints of God is a DVD series from Ignatius Press that is led by Steve Ray that walks us through important figures in salvation history. The key figures covered so far have included Jesus; Mary: Peter; Paul; Moses; David and Solomon; and the Apostolic Fathers. The most recent in the series is on Abraham.

Steve Ray begins by reading from the opening chapter of Genesis. He then shows us that he is on a boat in Iraq in the Euphrates River. He tells us the importance of this river, shows us how it connects to the Tigris, and talks about Mesopotamia being the cradle of civilization. He then recounts the Fall of Adam and Eve and The Great Flood. This takes us to the Tower of Babel and the idolatry of man. God was looking for one just and righteous man, Abram (later Abraham). Steve Ray then takes us on a cab ride to Ur, the place Abraham lived before he was called by God. We also see the famous ziggurat of Ur, which was dedicated to the god of the moon and speculated that Abram probably worshiped this god. We are then treated to museum-housed treasures from the past, such as jewelry, art, and musical instruments, and what those instruments would have sounded like. Lastly in Ur, we see the royal tombs also referred to as ""death pits,"" because human sacrifice would not have been uncommon then.

Abraham is then called by God and traveled to Haran (modern day Turkey). Abraham was a family of shepherds, and the land of Haran was good for shepherding. After Abram's father died, God again told Abram to move and go to wherever God would lead him. This leads us to the land of Canaan. Steve Ray then gives us a crash course on what typology is, using the example of bread and wine given to Abram by Melchizidek (a prefiguration of the priesthood of Christ). Abram is still without child, so Sarai (later Sarah) gives Abram her maidservant Hagar, and she conceives a child named Ishmael. Next comes the covenant that God established with Abraham. Steve Ray continues walking us through Scripture and Abraham's life, which is marked time and time again by his superior faith.

Steve Ray does a wonderful job blending Scripture, history, and culture into one great presentation. He takes you on site to places that you would only dream of visiting and points out interesting tidbits that you might have never heard before. What I like best about this program was the presentation style. I have watched many Catholic DVD programs and they all come off very polished and well-rehearsed (not that there is anything wrong with that). Steve Ray has a very relaxed presentation style that feels like he is casually speaking to you and not a camera. I mean he milked a goat and shot the milk straight into his mouth. It was both impressive and humorous. I look forward to watching the rest of the DVDs in this series.",1478476800,,2822,4.595238095238095
8701157,5,B00TANEVDA,"We really appreciated being able to add this DVD to the others of the series available so far.  Stephen Ray has done a wonderful job in producing them.  I hope that ""Augustine"" might not be too long in coming.",1460073600,,209,4.333333333333333
8701158,5,B00TANEVDA,"I'm such a great fan of Steve Ray... and this latest DVD is another one of his works that is outstanding!  His videos are produced on location and incredibly scenic and informative.  I enjoyed every moment :).  If you ever have an opportunity to meet Steve and join him on one of his excursions, do so!!!!!",1459296000,,306,4.428571428571429
8701159,5,B00TANEVDA,"These series on the bible are amazing. So well done. Must respond to a post which incorrectly stated that the host of this program takes the name of the Lord in vain when he accidentally steps in camal poop. He does NOT. He clearly says ""geeez"". I was almost not going to purchase based on that incorrect review so I felt I should set that record straight. I would like to say that these series are biblically sound and solid.",1459209600,,426,4.3375
8701160,3,B00TANEVDA,"For the record, I love Steven Ray and am deeply indebted to his work in helping me 'cross the Tiber"".

I eagerly purchased three of the Footprints dvds in order to scoop up a better understanding of the full Bible (which is to say, the Catholic Bible).  As a Protestant, I've always loved these kinds of historical, biblical tours.  I was eager to take my first full-Bible tour.

However, while I enjoy the content of this Abraham video very much, the graphics and production I thought detracted from it. I still think a person can learn quite a lot from watching these, and I am glad that I purchased. But if future editions could have improved graphics, music, and production quality, I think that they would be even more educational and could reach an even wider audience.

That said, there are a lot of beautiful moments with sweeping, panoramic views of Iraq (like Mt. Sodom) and many informative and inspired moments.  God bless you.",1457654400,2,939,4.695121951219512
8701161,5,B00TANEVDA,My family has enjoyed the whole series of the Footprints of God over the years and this edition was no exception.  Entertaining as well as informative.,1454457600,,151,4.8076923076923075
8701162,5,B00TANEVDA,"All of Steve Ray's videos are worth watching! Filming on location allows the viewers to feel as if they were actually in the Holy Land, and Steve presents information in an easy-to-understand manner.",1440288000,,199,5.0606060606060606
8701163,3,B00TANEVDA,Not as good as his previous dvds in this series.  Mine also had audio issues....volume levels fluctuated.,1434758400,,105,5.176470588235294
