20047,5,076780046X,"For anyone who dreams of meeting that special someone at that right moment, this is the movie for you! The romance of Peter and Faith (Robert Downey, Jr. and Marisa Tomei) is what people dream about. Simply bumping into the person in Rome, and soon finding yourselves in love is so idealistic, you have have to stop and remind yourself that it is just a movie. However, it makes you wonder - is there that one person out there just for us and it's just a matter time before you find them? It's such a beautiful and this movie only makes it come true. A romance written in the stars is truly a romance worth having!",976924800,,614,4.301724137931035
20048,5,076780046X,"The story of a young woman (Marisa Tomei) who travels all the way to Italy to search for her soulmate even though she is getting married in days. All  the performers are great especially Bonnie Hunt. I hope she wins some  awards someday. Beautiful scenery of Italy is wonderfully captured in this  great looking DVD. Nothing happening in the 5.1 surround sound but again  this is not ""Die Hard"" kind of movies. Get this, you won't be  sorry.",966556800,3,441,4.602564102564102
20049,5,076780046X,"I loved the sweetness, the tenderness, and the scenery in this movie. Tough words for a Vietnam vet to utter, but it is truly wonderful.

20050,5,076780046X,"This funny movie is one you'll love if you like witty dialogue, great acting,(Marisa and Robert are a great team),and exciting costumes.  Marisa's clothes were beautiful. It's a family movie, so you can relax and  put down the remote. No fast-forwarding here! Well, you may find  yourself...rewinding. One of my favorite scenes is when Robert helps Marisa  get ready for a date with someone else and gives her the items BEFORE she  asks for them. Then he sprays some of her perfume in the air then holds the  bottle to his nose as if he were holding her.  Be still my romantic heart!  I hope these two team up again for another romantic comedy. Enjoy!!!!",919036800,6,654,4.626086956521739

She doesn't find him until just days before her wedding to another man when he calls to wish her husband-to-be good luck!  Calling off the wedding, she chases him around Europe in an attempt to find the the love of her life, taking with her her best friend.  Finally, she meets him in Rome, and the romance is instant.  But that's only the beginning...!  A wonderful tale of romance, ""Only You"" will not only show you love, it will show you Rome, Venice, and France!  END",900028800,2,570,4.330188679245283

20191,4,076780046X,"This movie is like taking a weekend trip to Italy. That's why I watch it ALL the time. It's been one of my fave movies since it came out in '94, I watched it as a teenager and now own it on DVD (I'm 36...ugh). All the reviews here do a pretty good job of plot synopsis but I will add that this movie, while not an Oscar winner, has a very timeless quality that makes it watchable over and over again for those of us who like the genre - as I mentioned, I think the most appealing thing (for me) is that it makes you feel like you really are there with Faith and her best bud Kate, hopping a plane to Italy and seeing Venice, Rome, the coast and what the heck - having some interesting interactions with Robert Downey Jr. while you're at it. Plus the fashion wasn't bad, Marisa Tomei's hair and wardrobe are pretty classic and timeless considering this WAS the 90's. The movie also has some pretty funny lines sprinkled here and there too - all in all, an enjoyable watch.",1461888000,,971,4.170212765957447

20239,3,076780046X,"Oh the days before TSA, unfriendly sky, smart phone, and speed trap.  These are what make this film very dated.  One character was using the ""brick"" cell phone in one scene.  What a hoot to see that phone!

Rom com films are escapism.  However, the dramatic tension between the two main, Tomei and Downey Jr., is weird.  It was probably because both of them were Manic Pixie Dream Girl/Boy.  Both leads sharing the same disposition and stereotype doesn't create tension nor is it as relateable.  A better rom com and not as dated from the same period is While You Were Sleeping.  I got into it much better than ""Only You"".

However, there are 2 reasons that recommend this film:

1. Location
It's an ode to Italy.  I just did a one month trip in Italy and was at all the locations the film had used, Venice, San Gimignano, Rome, and Positano.  I have a feeling the hotels in Rome and Positano are not on location but sets.  Also, train is very fast and convenient in Italy (yes, even in 1990).  Why rent a car to drive from Venice to Rome, if only for the sole purpose of going thru Tuscany and a far shot of San Gimignano?  I was thinking it's probably before the speed traps.  Now, one can't drive in Tuscany countryside without running the risk of getting a ticket in the mail months after the trip ended.

2. Wardrobe
This is about the only thing not dated in this film.  Tomei and Hunt's clothes and shoes are to die for.  They are still as classy and tasteful today as in 1990.  Tomei and Hunt were at the prime of their beauty and it shows.  Tomei's outfits were classy with a hint of sexiness and whimsy, very becoming.

If you have a weakness for Italy and fashion, I recommend this film.",1446595200,,1697,4.3514376996805115

It had a unique love story that truly sucked me into the plot and the way the actors played their roles was like they were the characters. It was natural. Not to mention it was funny.

20353,5,076780046X,Only you prefaces with a very young girls imagination of what romance and true love must be. Which suddenly and unexpectedly revisits her now grown and about to marry. The result of an unexpected phone call (not what you think) throwing her own world into a turmoil and dragging her friends along on a seat of the pants trip to Europe.. The story adds her best friend who is in the midst of doubt about her own marriage and a guy who is cute sweet and funny but needs to grow up and needs a little direction. Everyone learns a little something by the happy end of the movie I just love happy endings ! It almost reminds you of an old movie. It's a good clean romantic romp with good performances some beautiful scenery along the Mediterranean. Not just a chick flick some guys will like it too.,1403049600,,794,4.3355704697986575
20354,4,076780046X,"Okay, so the movie is 20 years old. I told you, I review old movies and television shows.  Actually, I forgot about this one after all these years, until it was on TV this past weekend.  It's a lighthearted, insanely unrealistic, sappy love story.  Every once in a while, they are good for an afternoon of mindless entertainment.

Damon Bradley.  Remember that name.  The entire movie is about the elusive Damon Bradley, and a woman named Faith.  You see, when Faith was a child, she played a game of Ouija Board (I think they're still around today).  Remember those things?  Did you ever play?  Did the spirit ever move and spell out a name for you?  Well, when a little girl asks who she is destined to marry and the board answers, this is serious stuff!  Then to have it confirmed by a fortune teller a few years later, it's got to be your destiny.  Right?

Fast forward to Faith as an adult, engaged and about to be married to a podiatrist, whose name is not Damon Bradley. Alas, though, she discovers that her about-to-be husband had a classmate named Damon Bradley, and he's on his way to Italy for a holiday.

Like any insane woman, caught up in romantic nonsense, Faith takes her best friend, Beth, and sets off to Italy in search of Damon Bradley.  She absolutely must meet him and know if they are destined to be one.  They hop on a plane and travel to Venice, Rome, and down the Italian coast in search of the man.  However, in the meantime Faith meets another man, played by Robert Downey, Jr., who falls head over heels in love with her and believes she is his destiny.

The sub-plot of the movie revolves around Beth, played by Bonnie Hunt.  I love Bonnie Hunt!  I always have, and she is so endearing in this film.  She goes with Faith to Italy in her search for Damon, thinking all along she's a bit crazy.  Her one liners are good chuckles, and they are all delivered with Bonnie's talent for snark.  However, her character is dealing with her own heartache and suspicion that her husband, Larry, is having an affair.  Along the way, she meets the very dreamy and handsome Joaquim de Almeida, who shows an interest in the beautiful blonde American.

Marisa Tomei and Robert Downey Jr. are a handsome couple and twenty years younger, looking absolutely stunning together.  Marisa's wardrobe in the movie is eye catching.  And Robert, well, dang, he is cute and his usual self early in his career.

The movie is a good lighthearted, fun romp, traipsing across Italy.  If nothing else, you can enjoy the movie filmed on location and get the flavor of the Italian lifestyle and landscape.  It's a perfect location for love and romance.

Of course, the story is unrealistic, a bit on the crazy side, but worth the watch if you miss the old-time romantic comedies that we rarely see nowadays.  Interesting to read Roger Ebert's take on the movie alluding to that fact back in 1994 that it was reminiscent of romantic comedies with Doris Day.  ""I suppose Doris Day is out of fashion, and so are movies like Only You, but just because something is not done anymore doesn't mean it's not worth doing.""

Frankly, I don't think there are enough romantic comedies these days worth watching.  With the high ratings on Amazon, it seems to be a hit with a lot of people filling a need for crazy love.",1400025600,,3302,4.527918781725888

This name was confirmed by a fortune teller soon after. When he calls out of the blue one day Faith drops everything, even her soon-to-be wedding, to go to Italy to find him.

Marisa Tomei, Robert Downey Jr., Bonnie Hunt (!), Billy Zane, and the rest of the cast carry out their performances very well.
The setting, the plot, the dialogues, the humor, and the music are all good.
In a nutshell, though not a masterpiece it will provide for an evening's entertainment.",1204934400,,576,4.601941747572815
20450,3,076780046X,"Given that I am quite easy on love stories, crazy about the Italian culture, and think highly of both Marisa T. and Robert D. as actors, this should have been an easy ride for me.  It certainly began with a premise I hold dear - - the notion that there is such a thing as ""the one"" and how we must overcome the forces that tell us to settle.  And so when Tomei's character is initially duped by Downey's character into believing he is the ""damon bradley"" she is seeking, I forgave his lie as an act of desperation by someone who has fallen hard in a split second.  However, for him to then subsequently set up a whole false scenario where he hires a friend to pretend to be the real ""damon bradley"" so he can appear generous and selfless in Tomei's eyes, was nothing short of cruel.  No one with a kind heart would do that to someone they truly love.  And I could never root for someone who had something like this in them. A romantic movie only works if you like both people and their flaws are forgivable -- as opposed to indicative of a willingness to manipulate, repeatedly lie, and consciously hurt someone to win them over to your side (this is especially true if the romantic movie is trying to sell itself as more drama and substance than just hapless comedy).

PS I gave an extra star for the Italian scenery and beautiful hotels chosen for the film.",1133740800,2,1359,4.330708661417323
20451,5,076780046X,"Norman Jewison created this warm and airy ode to love, giving it both the beauty and fragrance of a flower cart on the cobbled streets of Italy. The scenery will take your breath away and the story make you smile in this light romantic comedy.

The always sweet and engaging Marisa Tomei is Faith, on the verge of marriage when a phone call from her fiance's friend will stop her dead in her tracks, simply because his name is Damon Bradley. A game played when she was a child and a Gypsy fortune teller at a carnival in her teens told her the man she would love and marry would be named, Damon Bradley.

Bonnie Hunt shines as Faith's sister-in-law and best friend, who takes off to Venice with her in search of her destiny, written in the stars. When they discover Damon Bradley has left the hotel he called from, the search will go from Venice to Rome, and on to the lovely Italian coast, as Norman Jewison gives us a gorgeous view of romantic Italy.

Robert Downey Jr. is at his most charming as Damon Bradley, who Faith meets by chance, or perhaps fate, and falls in love with. Faith will discover, however, that destiny has a few twists and turns in store for her, in this truly delightful violin concerto to love.

This film will work its magic on you if you enjoy a light romantic comedy with a 1950's feel, and will surely become one of your favorites if you are seeing it for the first time. Those who enjoy films like ""Roman Holiday"" and ""Three Coins in the Fountain"" will welcome this romantic postcard from beautiful Italy with open arms and grateful hearts.

Marisa Tomei gives a performance both vibrant and full of magic. This refreshing and wonderful film for romantics is widely available in various VHS and DVD editions. Don't let destiny, or this film, pass you by.",1113696000,13,1784,4.493827160493828
20452,3,076780046X,"This definitely isn't motion picture at its best.  However, Marisa Tomei always turns in a lovable, humorous performance, as she does here.  She's locked in a fun female bonding trip, one that makes her companion's husband realize he's been neglecting his wife, while at the same time allowing Ms. Tomei to romp around Italy engaging in adventures while she looks for her soulmate.
I did feel a bit betrayed as the film resolved the ""soulmate"" issue, which I won't give away here.  All in all, it's worth seeing once, just for fun.",1039478400,4,531,4.75
20453,4,076780046X,"In most of the reviews I've read on this movie, people point out the highlights of Robert Downey, Jr. and Marisa Tomei, as they should. Both of the stars of this film are definitely worth watching (however cheesy they may get). What people also recognize is Bonnie Hunt in a fabulous best friend role that you will make you think of your best friend.
The other great parts of this film are some of the supporting actors. Fisher Stevens is hilarious as Kate's roofer husband who can't believe his wife is in ""It-ly"" as he pronounces the ever so romantic country. People also neglect mentioning Giovanni (Joaquim De Almeida), the man who tries to woo the married Kate (Bonnie Hudson). He does the perfect foreign playboy role. And, of course, you've got Billy Zane in the cast to mix things up.
The cast all complement each other and this is one of those movies that girls should really watch together to bond. Guys will think its ok since it does have some funny parts. Overall, this is a chick flick but its a very good chick flick.",1037750400,,1032,4.524064171122995
20474,5,076780046X,"In this beautifully filmed story, Faith (Marisa Tomei) is getting ready to marry a successful podiatrist when Damon Bradley, the man of her dreams calls up to speak to her fiance. Damon's a man that she's never met; however, as a young girl in a game of Ouija board, she asked the name of the man that she would marry. The answer was Damon Bradley. Faith probably would have ignored that, but several years later, she's again given the same name by a Gypsy fortuneteller. She feels that she can't ignore the phone call and takes off for Italy to meet Damon Bradley who she thinks may be her soul mate.
Bonnie Hunt is charming in the part of Kate, Faith's sister-in-law. She flies to Rome with her because she thinks that Faith is nuts to do something so reckless and dangerous. Kate's own marriage is lacking in romance and she's thrown off balance when a dashing Italian gigolo pursues her.
The scenery is breathtaking and beautiful in Italy and Faith meets several attractive men in her search for Damon Bradley. Robert Downey Jr.is endearing in the roll of a shoe salesman, and Marisa Tomei has never been more attractive.
Very enjoyable and fun!",1033603200,6,1149,4.637254901960785
20475,4,076780046X,"This movie lost a star because, in truth, I found Marisa Tomei's character to be a bit over the top.  She believes in fate, and that a ouji game when she was eleven proffered the name of her future husband.  And so many years later, she ends up all the way in Rome to find the man with this name -- the man of her dreams. (By this time she's engaged, but the guy is schmuck, so it's really not important).
This is a hokey premise, even for me, and I always love the hokey romantic comedies.  After the first 20 minutes, I almost gave up.  But then the lovely Robert Downey Jr. graced the screen and reminded me why I watch reruns of Ally McBeal on F/X.  He's sweet, he's charming, he's fantastically charismatic.  He spends this movie doing his best to charm Marisa Tomei into falling in love with him, resorting to some not-so-honest tricks.  Normally this would be a little too stalkerish, but somehow, Robert just makes it work.
So if you like romantic comedies and their highly predictable endings, and especially if you dig Robert, you'll like this movie.  (Oh and it also has Bonnie Hunt -- from Jerry McGuire and Return to Me -- another good reason to check it out).",1022630400,4,1173,4.398148148148148

After watching it all the way through, I suddenly realized that it was My Cousin Vinny that she won for.  Now, I'm as romantic as the next person, but this movie was so sappy that it was unrealistic and stupid.  Marisa Tomei's performance in this movie and her performance in My Cousin Vinny are like black and white.  In Only You, she takes off on a whim to chase after some guy named Damon Bradley, only 10 days before her wedding.  Romantic?  Sure!  But the way she plays it out is ridiculous.  Call me a cynic, but she makes herself way too vulnerable to the men she encounters in Italy.  I'm glad I saw My Cousin Vinny first because, after her performance in Only You, it would take a lot for me to see her in any other movie.",1009670400,2,890,4.244047619047619
20478,5,076780046X,"I saw this in the theater years ago, and thus began my adoration.  (Yikes, has it been 7 years already?!)
In the realm of romantic-comedies, ""Only You"" goes above and beyond the ""formula"".  Yes, you get the whirlwind romance, great funny dialogue, and enough surprises to make it hard to guess the ending.  BUT!  You also get so much more:
- dreamy Italian settings.  Forget Rick Stevens, I didn't know Venice & Positano could be look so magical and luxurious.
- a supporting cast that nearly steals the show.  Bonnie Hunt and her skill for honest (thus, funny) delivery brings the credibility to the movie.  Her style of speaking is so ""real-life"", you forget that the whole movie relies on a shaky premise of the faux psychic and a plastic ouija board.
- and a surprisingly underestimated chemistry between Tomei and Downey.  Case in point: Peter helping Faith dress for her date, and he's walking around her room realizing it may be their last time together.

The movie begins with Faith as a girl, playing with a Ouiji board. She asks who her soulmate is, and it gives her the name Damon Bradley. All her life, she waits to find him, but is unsuccessful. Marisa Tomei does an excellent job portraying the naive dreamer, Faith. When a phone call turns out to be a lead on discovering her soulmate, Faith and Kate fly to Venice, hoping to find him...ten days before Faith is supposed to marry the wrong man. In Venice, Faith runs into Peter Wright *literally* who chases her down to return her shoe. The moment she bumps into him, he falls in love with her! Seeing it as his only opportunity to get to know her, Peter (played by Robert Downey Jr.) pretends to be Damon.
I won't spoil the ending, but I will say this movie really made me smile. It's a great chick flick for those of us who love romance movies.",989625600,55,1079,4.294117647058823
