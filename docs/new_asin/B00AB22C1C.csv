Since I am beginner/intermediate, I did not have any complaints about the drills being too basic or slow (I usually skip to the Practice since I don't need the explanation as much; but it's nice to have it there). I've only done the choreography a little bit (I tire quickly!), so can't comment on it too much except to say it's gorgeous like everything she does; I like it when choreographies are taught in sections, with the ability to review/run through all previous sections with each new section; not sure if this takes that approach?). All in all just want to say Kami, please keep making DVDs and/or teaching online! I will buy/subscribe. Thanks :)",1407888000,2,783,4.6
8549496,5,B00AB22C1C,"Some extra cuts from workshop + performance. The only problem in video from workshop is the sound. Goes little up and down, but of course it's a minor problem. Choreography is awesome, drilled in slow speed and full speed which is incredibly usefull when you learn new choreography.
I love the DVD :)",1395446400,3,300,4.679245283018868

8549498,2,B00AB22C1C,"Like most, I was super excited to get this DVD. Kami is a beautiful dancer.. but here she was just bland.
The material was very basic; she teaches you how to pop and lock. There are other dancers that are much better at popping and explaining how to pop, if you own any Zoe Jakes DVD or have taken any Zoe workshop or have been doing fusion for a few years- you know all of the material on this disk!
Like others I also found that the drills were slow and not very useful, unless you are just starting in tribal fusion.
The 'warmup' and 'bonus' were both recorded at Kami's Tribal Fest workshop, as in somebody stood at the sidelines w/ a camera! It was nice to get this little peek into her workshop, but i think the warmup should have been recorded just for the DVD to make it more professional. Same for the performance, someone was at the foot of the stage recording the dance.. neat.. but we can all see that on youtube.",1367884800,3,925,4.231638418079096
8549499,3,B00AB22C1C,"I bought this DVD mainly because of the choreography and I was pretty disappointed to realize that it is not even a minute long! I would rather call it a combination.
The section about pops and locks is very basic, the drills are so slow that I ended up doing them at double speed because they are too slow for an intermediate level.
The so called choreography is nice and inspiring, and it is an intermediate level, that's why I gave the DVD three stars and not two.
The preview of her workshop is, as it says, a preview and it is nice, but rather short and it teaches only a small part of a choreography.
I love Kami when I see her dancing, but I expected some more advanced drills and a longer choreography.",1364947200,7,710,4.266666666666667
8549500,5,B00AB22C1C,The way Kami explain all those things is so clear that everyone can get it in a moment:) I love it:),1359849600,5,100,3.8095238095238093
