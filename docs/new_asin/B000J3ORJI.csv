8174133,1,B000J3ORJI,"The title ""Black Uhuru & Other Reggae Rebels"" is deceiving: Out of a total of 13 videos THERE ARE ONLY 2 BLACK UHURU VIDEOS! To add insult to injury, this is only a 50 minute DVD WITH VIDEOS RIPPED OFF FROM THE ORIGINAL 83 MINUTE DVD TITLED ""REAL AUTHENTIC REGGAE BASH!"" Ironically, when this 2006 DVD came out 2 years ago it was rated above the 2002 DVD ""Real Authentic Reggae Bash"" over this one on Amazon because people didn't know any better. But now 2 years later, since people know better, this 2006 DVD is rated below the 2002 DVD ""Real Authentic Reggae Bash."" So, if you want to get the original, superior 83 minute DVD with over 1/3 more time and videos than this rip-off DVD ""Black Uhuru & Other Reggae Rebels"" with only 50 minutes, then get the DVD ""Real Authentic Reggae Bash.""",1202256000,4,789,4.410958904109589
