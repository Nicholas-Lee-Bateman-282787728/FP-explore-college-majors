6097432,2,B00GOYHQ0S,"Let me just say right off the bat that the Pittsburgh crowd on this night was absolutely amazing.  The Royal Rumble has always been a pay-per-view (like Wrestlemania and Summerslam) that has been privy to vocal and proud fans that are not afraid to express themselves.  Just like most Chicago and Philadelphia crowds this crowd had an insane amount of energy and were a brazen lot.  Not only did they boo and chant during almost every match they were extremely vocal in telling the WWE universe (staff, wrestlers, and those watching on TV) their feelings without fear.  Although this reflects my personal feelings I felt proud to know that I wasn't alone in being upset at the many happenings of the night and only wish I could have been a part of the crowd there.  I should also note, while I will try to remain ambiguous about the results of the night there are portions that will involve spoilers so keep weary.

The night starts off with the best match on the card (which is a highly unfortunate thing regarding a Royal Rumble pay-per-view).  Daniel Bryan and Bray Wyatt would have a singles match that would be the culmination of the past month's tension between the two wrestlers and is the only match that delivers in both story and match quality on this card.  Bryan works so well with most wrestlers and Wyatt was given the ability to shine as well in this match and thankfully the match itself was given the time to really feel important and play out well.  Again, this will be one of the few positives in a night where the ball was heavily dropped.

Brock Lesnar versus Big Show should not be looked at as a match, which is unfortunate.  Given the buildup of the past few weeks it looked like Lesnar and Show were going to have a collision of titans and I was excited at this prospect as I've felt that Lesnar and Big Show have the kind of chemistry that typically brings out the best in one another.  Unfortunately what played out was more like a segment than a match which showcased Heyman as the mastermind of a beating by Lesnar on to Big Show.  The actual match itself barely breaks 2 minutes with a continued assault on Show after the bell.  The only thinking I have that allows this to make sense is that Lesnar and Show will continue their feud past this pay-per-view.  Otherwise this felt like a waste of buildup.

It's unfortunate because there a lot of reasons the match between Randy Orton and John Cena should have been a success but wasn't.  First off, Orton as a champion looked strong and dominating in some aspects but in truth this is the formula behind most Cena matches where he is painted as the underdog even though most people would agree that he's such a powerhouse and face in the business this just isn't the case anymore.  Orton and Cena were also given a good amount of time to wrestle this time around (almost matching the length of the Bryan/Wyatt match earlier) and the match felt like the culmination between two wrestlers who have had a long run with one another.  Unfortunately it may be that exact reason why the crowd was so cold during the match.  Orton and Cena have had better matches against one another and while this is certainly a good one the crowd just seemed absolutely bored (even during a segment that involved both wrestlers borrowing moves from the other which would normally garner something) with the two.  The final detail regards the ending of the match and while it is a story driven ending that may make more sense in the following weeks it felt a bit weak in terms of establishing both wrestlers place as top performers.

As per usual the night ends with the Royal Rumble match itself and this is strangely one of the best, and hands down worst, parts of the night.  As a whole the match will most likely go down as one of the weakest Royal Rumble matches ever.  Again, I cannot express how disappointed I am by this because the Royal Rumble has always been one of my favorite matches in the WWE's history.  There are significant points where the crowd is simply dead and they just couldn't care less about what was happening inside the ring.  Now, this is one of the reasons I'm so proud of the Pittsburgh crowd and it is marked by the last participants entry into the Rumble (If you don't want a spoiler I'd recommend you not read any farther into this paragraph).  This is not a knock against the last entry into the Rumble as he's someone I respect but there is a clear point where the last entry's music hits that you can feel the crowd's energy turn.  Throughout the night chants for a single man rung throughout the arena and at times it was downright funny (during the Orton/Cena match) but when it was revealed that Daniel Bryan was not joining the Rumble match you could sense that the crowd was downright pissed.  Now, it may be that Bryan was unable to join the match due to health reasons (a concussion two weeks earlier which I have not been able to research as much as I would have liked) but he was sorely missed during the match.  It was at this point that the crowd aired nothing but boos throughout the arena and then the energy turned even worse when CM Punk, who had gotten one of the best reactions of the night, was eliminated from the match.  Once this happened people were just pissed with the people left in the ring considering how it was likely to play out.  In my opinion, the wrong person won the Rumble and it may be one of strongest reasons this event will be remembered as less than a success.

There are a few positives regarding the match though (spoilers).  Kofi Kingston was given his traditional spot to ""wow"" the fans this year when he was nearly eliminated, with the first move being much more impressive than the second.  Two surprise entrants got amazing pops going into the ring but were eliminated almost as quickly as they entered.  Sheamus, who has been absent since last July, made his return and while it got a nice pop his overall performance seemed to add little to the Rumble's energy.  Without a doubt the best portion of the night involves Roman Reigns.  The end of The Shield has been teased at for weeks and what happened during the Rumble was played out extremely well.  Not only did it show the unit as a strong force in the Rumble but when things hit the fan you could see how this was going to be a great push for Reigns.  His general performance during the Rumble was great, as well as eliminating the most people in Rumble history (setting a new Rumble record at 12).  He was even made to look strong against many of the veterans in the ring which was a smart move.

To me, this marks a sad start to the year.  The Royal Rumble has always been one of my favorite events beyond the match itself.  It marks the official beginning of Wrestlemania season and this is usually a great time to be a wrestling fan.  Not only are we supposed to be rewarded with great matches but this is the time when people we want to see become champions finally take that position in the business.  Unfortunately this event feels more like a giant insult to the fans.  I get the idea that the WWE staff has this idea of what the fans want and sometimes they're right but they have a tendency to ignore the voice of the people when it's at its loudest.  Personally, I hope the WWE universe sees this event as a reason to change some things around because this crowd showed their feelings proudly rather than submit to the results handed to us.  Hell, did you hear the reaction Dolph Ziggler got when Jim Duggan mentioned his name?  That was one of the best moments in the night and reflects how sometimes fans deserve to be rewarded for their faith (although obviously this was not that night.  Jeez, both Ziggler and Punk both got buried in that Rumble match).",1390694400,15,7767,4.465297450424929

  Bryan vs Bray Wyatt: Triple H said he had big plans for Bray in 2014. So naturally their most over guy Bryan had to put him over and not even be in the Rumble! This was an excellent match though and the best out of a predictable night. Bray won with Sister Abrigal.
  Big Show vs Lesnar: Was hardly a match, Lesnar attacked Show before the match with a chair. Big Show got a ko punch in but Lesnar didn't get knocked out. Lesnar then won with the F5. But attacked Show with more chair shots afterwards.
  Cena vs Orton 20000000: both men got booed out of the arena and Bryan chants were heard. Yet WWE still didn't get the hint and left Bryan out of the Rumble. End came when Cena had the stf on Orton. The Wyatt's then came out, distracted Cena and Orton hit the RKO for the win. Bray then attacked Cena with sister Abrigal .
  Bryan had to put over Bray, why so Cena can make Bray look weak in a feud ?
  Royal Rumble: Was as predictable as last year. Someone, if they sneezed they'd get a shot, won the Rumble. And yes it was Batista. Gone for 4 years to win over guys who bust  their ass. Either Punk or Bryan deserved to win. Despite all the Bryan chants, WWE ignored the fans and didn't even have him in the Rumble.
  Anyway Boretista won by eliminating Roman Reigns who deserved to win a lot more as well. Batista vs Orton is rumored for WM zzzzzzzz. As is Bryan jobbing to Triple H. What lousy booking if it's true. Am getting sick of WWE and them burying over people in favor of crappy people who drawer crowds for some reason.

ROYAL RUMBLE 2014

This has always been my favorite event ever since it was created. I am a huge battle royal fan so this was always top of the list for me. Over the years it hasn't been the same as back in the day but still I have always liked it. This year we got some good matches overall but it was still a little lacking.

Spoilers

1. BRAY WYATT VS DANIEL BRYAN-I will start off by saying this was the best match on the card for sure. These two are excellent together and just battled all over the place. Bryan took it to Bray early but Bray battled back viciously. This was a great back and forth classic that would see Wyatt take the win, the fans were way into this one.

2. BROCK LESNAR VS BIG SHOW-this match was basically a beat down except for a few moments when Show gets the upper hand. Lesnar attacks him from the get go even before the bell. Then after the match he keeps going at Show with chairs. Lesnar takes this in a quick match.

3.[WWE WORLD TITLE]RANDY ORTON VS JOHN CENA-now I have to say that this match is much better than people say it is. In fact I think the crowd that night was just hating because this match did not get over at all. The action is good and these two always had a good chemistry. Cena and Orton went at it all over the place and Cena looked like he had it in the bag. That is until the Wyatt family came in and saved Orton.

4. ROYAL RUMBLE-this has always been my favorite match of the night usually and it is also the match that makes this event my favorite in the WWE. Now while this was a good Rumble over all it still wasn't as good as past years. Now personally I didn't mind that Bryan was involved in this match but the live crowd sure was. Even with Kofis now normal spot and a few surprise entrants they still very much voice their displeasure. Batista returns here and wins the match but it was Roman Reigns, Punk, Rollins, and Ambrose who were the MVPs here. I really didn't have a problem with Batista winning mainly because I knew it was going to happen.

BONUS

1.[WWE TAG TITLES]GOLDUST & CODY RHODES VS THE NEW AGE OUTLAWZ-I was surprised this match was on the kick off show given the teams and the titles on the line. I love all four of these guys but I wanted the Outlawz to win this. Thankfully after a good back and forth that had Cody shining of course the DX members made history winning the belts back after 14 years or something like that.

You also get wrestlers drawing their numbers for the event, and interviews with Orton and Batista as bonus features.",1396915200,2,2534,4.197530864197531
6097462,1,B00GOYHQ0S,"Not worth buying. 3 matches come-on. An addition it was not a good show, previous royal rumbles are worth watching repeatedly. Let me put it this way, I watched it once and never watched it again. One more thing, Lesnar and the wyatt family deserves the electric chair. Poor excuse for professionals.",1396828800,,300,4.788461538461538
6097463,2,B00GOYHQ0S,"Rhodes Brothers VS New Age Outlaws: This was a pre-show match with N.A.O winning the belts for the first time in years. Rhodes Brothers have been putting on great matches for months but this one wasn't one of them.

Daniel Bryan VS Bray Wyatt: The only real reason to watch the PPV.

Big Show VS Brock Lesnar: I might be one of the few to admit this but I enjoyed the feud between these two for the title way back when. This wasn't a match as Lesnar attacks Show with a chair but Show gets the K.O. punch but can't captialize as Lensar hits an f5 for the win. Could have been much, much better.

Randy Orton VS John Cena: I could really careless about either man. Wyatt Family interferes to set up Cena-Wyatt at WrestleMania 30 as Orton retains with an RKO

Royal Rumble: The WWE brings back something I miss, wrestlers cutting promos on why they are going win the Rumble. This Rumble was trypical like the last few years with Nash returning again. Roman Reigns dominated the match to show WWE fans what the future holds. Not a bad match but not a great match with the returning Batista winning it in the end, shocker.

Overall, Batista, Lesnar, & N.A.O return & put in big roles. WWE is better of with Wyatt Family, The Sheild, & Daniel Bryan. Hell, Raw & Smackdown basically featured these 7 men in the main event in some way for all of 2013. Another thing that bugs me about WWE is Raw, Main Event, & Smackdown all feature PPV quality matches so there is no point in ordering PPV's anymore. If you miss a match on PPV chances are WWE will feature a rematch on one of there shows. PPV's have really lost it's luster for me & it's sad people shell out money for them when you can watch it for free on cable.",1396224000,,1708,4.275541795665634

The first match was fantastic, but the rest of the show takes a major nosedive for the rest of the event. The Lesnar/Big Show match was 2 minutes of match and 10 minutes of steel chair slams. The Cena/Orton match is nothing special like most of their matches are. I'd say the crowds chants were more entertaining. And of course the Royal Rumble starts great, then just completely falls off the track to a chorus of boos for the last 10 minutes of the show. Worth just skipping.",1393718400,2,557,4.470588235294118

6097468,5,B00GOYHQ0S,"For being a true WWE fan since childhood I am shocked by all the bad reviews.  In the last 5-10 years the 2013 and 2014 royal rumble were the only ones relevant in recent memory.  Last year we had the ROCK VS CM PUNK you cant get better than that.  Now this year Daniel Bryan VS Bray Whyat.  Wow all I can say is wow one of the best matches in years I could have sworn I was watching A ECW match.  Hard hitting violent as hell, and action packed.  Next we had Brock Lezner VS Big show. Yes Lezner did attack big show before the match but it was an all out brawl.  And C- mon people its Brock Lezner for gods sake, what the hell do you expect.  Any PPV with a Lezner match gets five stars.  Then John Cena VS Randy Orton this was just simply a rematch that had to happen, it was a good old classic rematch.  Then the Royal Rumble match itself, Predictable yes its Batista but what the hell man who doesn't want to see Batista in the main event at WRESTLEMANIA XXX I mean its Batista, another huge WWE SUPERSTAR return I repeat SUPERSTAR.  And now lets get to Daniel Bryan.  First there is still the Elimination chamber PPV DUH.  and second screw the rumble match id rather see Daniel Bryan win the title at WRESTLEMANIA unexpectedly, or at Extreme rules.  Bryan winning at WRESTLEMANIA XXX would be the culmination of the entire past year in WWE.  Go out and buy the dvd the other people don't know what there talking about, IDIOTS.  Read above, self explanatory.  Let the hate mail begin again.

6097469,1,B00GOYHQ0S,"This was the most dissapointing Royal Rumble in a long time. Aside from the opening match there wasn't much of anything really that entertaining to me. I like Nash, but he's the ONLY returning superstar in the Rumble match?!?! Oh, that's right, gotta have an announcer and a mascot for a tag team get in there. Why not use Jake Roberts here instead of wasting his appearance on that Old School Raw and that weak ass crowd?

The Royal Rumble match itself was a solid bout,people were booing like crazy when Rey Mysterio Jr(not Daniel Bryan) was number 30 and when Batista(not Roman Reigans) winning the whole thing.

6097471,3,B00GOYHQ0S,"Daniel Bryan vs. Bray Wyatt - The Wyatt Family was kicked out of ringside during the early moments which Bryan took full advantage of hurting Bray's knee & coming after him with an aerial assault both in & outside of the ring along with just a ruthless assault on that bad leg with strikes & stomps & twist including using the ring ropes before Bray fought back using his own body as a weapon with his weight advantage & focusing on the head & neck area keeping Bryan grounded as both men traded momentum catching each other & countering their signature moves & submissions.  This was built as a fight & definitely came off as one to the point where I had to agree with J.B.L. later in the show, ""Someone call the sheriff, they just stole the show.""

Big Show vs. Brock Lesnar - This was pretty much one of those matches that was more of a segment than anything else as Lesnar went through 3 different sets of chairs to assault Big Show before & after the match across his back & arm in what was a brutal beating while Show was able to get his knockout punch in that took a while for Brock to recover from.  The match itself was more of a backdrop to the story they were trying to tell with Brock showing a new level of violence which did it's job based off the welts on Show's back once it was all.
As a side note, Jerry Lawler mentioned on commentary during the match that Big Show gave Brock Lesnar is first defeat during his first run at the Royal Rumble 2002 which is incorrect because it took place at Survivor Series 2002 but the rematch was at the Royal Rumble 2003 which Brock won.

WWE World Heavyweight Champion Randy Orton vs. John Cena - Both men started out trading momentum in the early moments with Orton keeping a slow calculated pace staying one step ahead of Cena countering his offense while working him over on both the in & outside of the ring before Cena was able to finally get some momentum in his direction only for Orton to start pulling moves of Cena's own playbook with Cena returning the favor himself with the biggest shock coming from who decided to appear & what were they doing there.  You saw where the fans were going with this match right from the gate as they were cheering different names from Daniel Bryan to Undertaker to Chris Jericho to just booing & chanting ""BORING!"" at both men so they weren't going to win this crowd over but I'll give them credit in that they tried some different things like stealing each other's signature moves however they have feuded on & off with each other for over 5 years now in almost every possible match stipulation so them having a regular one on one match that seemed to stay in ""first gear"" throughout most of the match made for easily one of their weakest televised matches that I can remember.

Royal Rumble Battle Royal - As usual, WWE put together a great ""by the numbers"" video package featuring facts & highlights from the previous Rumble matches plus we got a throwback to the days of the first few Rumbles with short interviews from most of the participants stating why they would win the match. Various moments include two previous World Champions from another ""honorable"" company starting out, the various suprise entrants including one man making his debut from NXT, Kofi Kingston making his yearly Rumble elimination highlight reel, Zeb Colter's signs depending on your sense of humor, the Cesaro Swings, who really believed in The Shield?, a new record broken after over a decade, the crowds response to one man being excluded from the match, the reaction that couldn't be denied at the end no matter how high they tried to drown it out with theme music and as of right now (a week & a half later after the event) what looks like to be the final performance of one of the biggest stars in recent years.  It was your typical Rumble match that had it's entertaining & shocking (good & bad) moments.

This was pretty much a ""two match"" show as Bryan & Wyatt delivered while I was entertained by the Rumble regardless if I agreed/liked with who won it or not but the rest of the show wasn't anything I felt would have replay value as the past has shown that Brock & Show are two guys who can bring the best out of each other but all we got was a segment more than a match while Orton & Cena just didn't deliver so it's an event I would catch with the WWE Network or subscription or a stream replay/rental but nothing past that.",1391558400,6,4417,4.424354243542435
