6639300,5,B00NC9TU3E,"Three sisters have decided to support each other in doing the things they want to do in their lives. Diane (Nadine Ellis), Miki (Kiki Haynes) and Sky (Kelly Jenrette) are ready to live their dreams.

It's nice that stageplays are available to watch online or on DVD these days. I enjoyed this one so much, I watched it twice. Concerning their individual goals, what these ladies did right and what they did wrong are good lessons for viewers. What I liked most was everything that had to do with relationships - marital, dating and family. Funny. Touching. Thought-provoking, indeed.

Good cast: Nadine Ellis, D.B. Woodside, Kiki Haynes, Carl Payne, Kelly Jenrette, RonReaco Lee, Brad James
Favorite Character: Sky (Kelly Jenrette)
Favorite Lines:
""I need a woman whose hair doesn't need a passport to get into the country.""
""Don't think that strength comes from material things or other people or even yourself. True strength comes from the Lord.""
Favorite Scene: When Miki (Kiki Haynes) and Jeremy (Carl Payne) met.",1428537600,2,1017,5.0476190476190474

8677352,5,B00NC9TU3E,"Awesome play.  I watched it three times in one weekend. I disagree with those who think the acting in this play was over the top.  It was refreshing that these actors did NOT over-act, and the writing was skillful.  So often we get stage plays where the writing is horrible and/or the actors are not skilled.  The actors in this play  EVERY ONE OF THEM  were highly skilled.  The story was realistic and authentic.  And the timing of events was so realistic.  The characters did not meet, fall in love and hook up and/or marry all within the same week.  And the chemistry was real between the characters.  What I enjoyed most was that the singing was in the background.  We were able to follow the whole story without the untimely interruptions.  Not that I do not like musicals but not everyone is a Tyler Perry.  This writer did an awesome job with this play and I cannot wait to see what she does next  and I hope she comes to my city so I can be part of the live audience.",1472601600,,976,4.285714285714286
