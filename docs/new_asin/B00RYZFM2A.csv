6936644,5,B00RYZFM2A,Ordering the UFC of 2014 is GREAT! It truly helps to get a glimpse of fights that took place last year. The championship matches being on Pay Per View are outrageously expensive. Truly appreciate your company putting this collaboration together.  Thanks,1429142400,,253,5.170731707317073
6936645,1,B00RYZFM2A,"I bought this because I buy all the best of UFC collections. It's just as good (or bad, really) as the previous annual releases in terms of content. However the picture quality is subpar. If I wanted low-res video streaming I'd watch these fights on fight pass. No blu-ray = 1 star.",1428883200,6,282,4.4423076923076925
6936646,5,B00RYZFM2A,"Okay, the feature is pretty good. It is what is to be expect however of a best of 20 - - feature from now on.  It is only as entertaining as the year had been.  However, since they got back to showing full fights it is not only worth the money but is worth having if you are a MMA fan/collector of these! The Dan Henderson VS Showgun 2 fight alone is reason to pick it up (it was on fox card and those aren't out on DVD).",1428796800,,421,3.772727272727273
6936647,1,B00RYZFM2A,im with the other guys. no blu ray no buy.,1427068800,5,42,3.3
6936648,1,B00RYZFM2A,"I for one will not be buying this unless it is available on blu-ray format, talk about going backwards, it's 2015!!!",1426464000,14,116,4.571428571428571
6936649,1,B00RYZFM2A,It's 2015 and Zuffa is not putting this on blu-ray!?!?! Who owns a dvd player but not a bluray player? What a joke.,1426291200,12,115,4.043478260869565
6936650,1,B00RYZFM2A,"I have ufc fight pass and love it, but would still buy a blu ray set of the 2014 best of.  They should have stuck to what they did in previous years and have the dvd version have this much and then the blu ray have at least 25 or more full in their entirety matches.  Like other reviews say it is the year 2015 everyone has an hd tv by now and let us enjoy ufc action in hd.  It is only 1 release a year we are talking about to have on blu ray not asking much.  I will only buy this now if it is on a really good sale or in a bargain bin.  Had this been on blu ray and a really good set I would have paid full price for it and not thought twice about it.  I felt the 2014 year in ufc was way better than 2013 by a landslide too.  If they decide to come out with a blu ray edition I will change my review.",1426204800,16,804,3.56
6936651,1,B00RYZFM2A,"And now, many years later, you can stand on a steep hill in Las Vegas and look West, and with the right kind of eyes you can almost see the high-water markthat place where the wave finally broke and rolled back.

As if we needed another sign of the dark days to come, the UFC decides to save a few bucks and abandon the blu-ray release of their supposed crown jewel collection of fights for the year. Probably because blu-ray production is more expensive and no one's willing to pony up the extra dough anymore for a small collection of full fights and a crappy PR-driven highlight video. UFC Best of 2013 blu-ray was stuck in the $7.99 bargain bin at Best Buy within a few months of its initial release and I noticed a couple of copies still there as recently as last week. Now with the dvd release, we get an even smaller list of full fights and horrendous picture quality.

So let's look at the facts:

-PPV prices keep going up
-PPV buys keep going down
-Cards are watered down to the point of collective fan disinterest
-great fights are becoming harder and harder to come by.

And now the death of the UFC on blu-ray. The signs are all there oh my brothers. Dana White once said the UFC would be the biggest sport in the world in ten years...which he said about eight or nine years ago. Not only will the UFC not become anywhere near the biggest sport in the world in a HUNDRED YEARS, but I predict that mma will regress back to pre-TUF levels of popularity within 5-10 years.

And that's what we get when a bald-headed, foul-mouthed former jazzercize instructor is running a major corporation.",1426032000,3,1600,4.428571428571429
6936652,1,B00RYZFM2A,"I always enjoyed purchasing these so that you can have a compilation of the best fights from that year in their entirety. For the past couple of years it has been disappointing that they have done away with that and and give only highlights of the best matches and only include a few fights in their entirety. This year, if that weren't already enough to be upset about, they have decided to not release on Blu-ray! We live in 2015 and all have high-def TV's... i refuse to buy something that was filmed in HD and watch it in SD on my TV. This is getting ridiculous.",1425945600,8,566,4.299065420560748

8696404,1,B00RYZFM2A,"Is the fact that they weren't selling as much as they wanted to REALLY the reason they're not doing the Blu Rays this year?!?!? Thats the stupidest thing Ive ever heard. Not to mention that EVERYONE has a blu ray player these days. ""Well since we didn't get the numbers we expected, we're going to make the LOYAL fans, who wait on these every year, suffer....."" SMFH The UFC, with all of the nonsense theyve been on lately, is just alienating their fanbase and fighters, little by little.

8696407,1,B00RYZFM2A,"Watching this 10 fight collection, mostly decisions, mostly lawler and hendricks, I was struck by how shot Dan Hendo looks off trt and looking 50 years old! Slow sloppy and lucky to be fighting a washed up slowgun, hendo banks a brutal brick to the nose of his physically spent shell of a foe. They didn't even bother to put a RR fight on the set! Only 3 of the fighters on the dvd cover are featured in fights.
 Ufc is putting the brakes on quality, with the weak matchmaking and later media production.
No ufc 2014 ultimate collection.
No best of 2014 br.
No individual ppv dvd releases anymore. The ppvs are so depleted by injuries, watered down with flyweights and garbage match ups they are offered at a 2 for 1 format now.
In the near future i'm looking forward to the ufc forgetting to put fights on some dvds or forgetting to even release events on dvd.
Like they did after buying pride and released the events chronologically backwards, with missing fights and discs, no special features, and completely forgetting to release the 2004 hw gp collection.

Well the near future is here and ufc has indeed forgotten how to produce dvds entirely.",1429488000,2,1150,4.577669902912621
8696408,5,B00RYZFM2A,"I know it sucks that they were not selling enough blu rays in previous years to justify the extra expense, but the product itself is still very good.  It would have been nice if they made up for not offering a blu ray by making this a 3 disc set so they could include some more full fights, even if that would make the price $3 to $5 more.  For $13, this is still a good deal for an entertaining 2 disc set.  Also, don't forget that the highlight reel does include a few more full fights that were short, such as both Ronda Rousey fights.  I'm happy with the purchase.",1429315200,7,568,4.09009009009009
