4989584,4,B006HGXH1K,"This was made by the guys at LBP (Low Budget Pictures). They have made tons of movies (mostly spoofs/homages) in the past 20 years. This one is just as fun as all the rest. Not as good as Terror At Bloodfart Lake, but still fun and entertaining.",1365033600,,245,4.23404255319149
4989585,2,B006HGXH1K,the acting was so poor i couldn't get in to the movie it was not funny nor was it a horror movie,1363392000,,96,3.409090909090909
4989586,2,B006HGXH1K,"You think i could learn after my first Bloodfart Lake.  I think the first was even better.... Yet again we get the pathetic commercialism by now 2 of the actors promoting their crap during dialogue the chick on the cover i guess is some softcore porn star trying to promote herself, so go buy her other videos today.... and of course more promotion for selling T-shirts again.  I thought that Meredith Host would make this one better, but i didn't really like her role this time around; being all whiny and annoying.  Nudity?  No i don't recall any this time like in the first so even the soft porn chick keeps her clothes on, but she'll tell you about her stardom. It has it's mo9ments but not enough to save it.",1360108800,4,713,4.419847328244275
4989587,5,B006HGXH1K,Return to Blood Fart Lake is a great bit of modern cinematic art. Chris Seaver has out done himself yet again. This film was a real class act!,1341792000,3,142,4.107142857142857
4989588,4,B006HGXH1K,"Childish, no.... infantile movie with low low lowbrow humor.  An abomination.  By no means a skilled endeavor in filmmaking.  But hey, I like that sort of thing when done well, if not skilled.  The infantile wit had me in stitches, just like the killer scarecrow has.  I hope this movie doesn't inspire me to do the deranged deeds that he did!  If you like perverted humor and low budget killing and gore, Chris Seaver's films are some of the best!  Return to BFL is excellent entertainment!",1329782400,3,491,4.6395348837209305
8498340,5,B006HGXH1K,"Te most disgusting, disturbing thing I've ever seen. Christ almighty",1524096000,,68,5.9
8498341,1,B006HGXH1K,"Every bit as bad as the title suggests. I only made it through the first two minutes. The dialog, acting, production value don't even meet the lowest standards of acceptability.",1521936000,,177,4.933333333333334
8498342,1,B006HGXH1K,I could make a better movie than this. Lol.,1521676800,,43,3.888888888888889
8498343,1,B006HGXH1K,Another garbage offering,1520985600,,24,7.333333333333333
8498344,1,B006HGXH1K,"Like chubby, tattoo covered, homely women? What about acting so bad, a group of people picked at random would likely do better? Yeah, me neither. I get that it was supposed to be campy, and fun. For me, it failed on every level. I love movies that are in the ""so bad it's good"" genre. The people that made this were obviously going for that, and failed miserably.
  Easily, the best part of the ""movie"" is the cover art. It implies an 80's style camp horror flick. What it delivers is disappointment. Notice how the movie has ""Lake"" in the title? Know what I didn't see? A lake. Also notice it appears to have an image of a woman in a bikini on the cover? Know what isn't in the movie? A woman in a bikini. She does appear, but looks to be dressed for church. Even at that, she appears quite a bit larger than what's on the cover.
 What was good about this? It ended.",1484352000,2,867,4.179640718562874
8498345,5,B006HGXH1K,"This movie has everything. I thought I had lived before today, I was wrong.",1478044800,,75,4.428571428571429
8498346,1,B006HGXH1K,"I expected this to be a bad B movie horror flick.  They were smart enough to name it something funny enough to garner interest and the cover is the best thing about it.  Some movies are so bad they are good, but this is just bad.",1460332800,,229,3.9565217391304346
8498347,1,B006HGXH1K,"The first one was so awful it was great.  Return is so awful - That it just stays awful :(. No 80s refrences, not fun, not farts.  Boooooo. Two thumbs down.",1425945600,,156,4.0
8498348,3,B006HGXH1K,"Umm, it's definitely a movie. And it is indeed a member of the B-Genre. And horrible. It's got to be some of the worst acting I've seen since Ed Wood was still making films. But, I wasn't expecting an Oscar quality film to begin with, so I'm not crying. It was fun.",1416700800,,265,4.115384615384615
8498349,4,B006HGXH1K,"I loved LBP first one, Terror at Bloodfart Lake, and this one is not bad either.  This flick is a welcome addition to my collection of B-rate horror movies.",1377302400,3,156,4.379310344827586
