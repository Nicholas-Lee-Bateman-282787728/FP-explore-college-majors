3089979,1,B0012IX34Y,"""Tripping the Rift: The Movie"" is as unpleasant an animated viewing experience as can be imagined. I like science fiction, parody, and comedy, all of which this movie purport to be. Unfortunately the film is nothing but a boring 75 minute exhibition of toilet humor with no coherent plot, and characters that were universally loathsome. It's rare that five minutes into a film I am wishing the entire cast to be annihilated in a cataclysmic event, but such was the case here. Although it is only 75 minutes long, it took me five sittings to get through this steaming pile.

The film has excellent animation. That is where my praise ends. The film features a pointless blend of color and black and white, and attempts to parody numerous earlier works and includes elements reminiscent of ""Star Trek"", ""Star Wars"", ""Alien"", ""Saturday Night Fever"", ""Frankenstein"" (obviously), and every Tim Burton movie ever made, but on balance reminded me mostly of a cross between ""Weekend at Bernie's"" and ""Killer Klowns From Outer Space."" The film consists of numerous subplots (clown pregnancy, Slovenian Princess reanimation, and even less tasteful delvings into suicide and flatus), none of which go anywhere. Just when the plot seems to be becoming coherent it veers wildly in a new direction. Perhaps that could have something to do with the origin of the film as multiple episodes of a Canadian television show sliced and diced together. Sound good? It's not.

When I bought the film I thought it could be a creative and funny satire. Instead it's a great glob of preadolescent non-humor that makes little sense, utterly fails to entertain, and provokes outright hostility to the characters. Evil extraterrestrial clowns are a great choice for science fiction parody, but save yourself the torture of watching this and get ""Killer Klowns From Outer Space"" instead if you are determined to explore the genre.",1245974400,,1899,5.044585987261146

Oh and for anyone wondering if there is any nudity (from Six)... NO

3089984,2,B0012IX34Y,"I remembered when I first watched the series on the SciFi channel, before like the folks at the SF channel always do, they killed off the series before it's time.  After watching this movie, I realized that 30 minutes was the maximum each episode should be.  This movie was just too darn long, unoriginal, boring and pedantic.  ""Unrated"" just means that the characters toss off ""F"" bombs - this could be funny, if they were at appropriate or potentially funny moments. Alas, not.  The animation - sub-par.  More like a mid-1990's video game.

The running ""gag"" was a takeoff on the Terminator series - and, again, without any originality.  They also tried lampooning Young Frankenstein. And, again, poorly. Then they tried Desperate Housewives. And, again, they failed.

I had hopes that the movie would be as original and caustic as the TV series. Not even close.  Looking back on it, maybe the SF channel made the correct choice.",1232236800,,931,4.841772151898734

Talk about slapping something together to try and cash in while something is hot, this is the absolute worst.  Go back and watch Season 1 again....",1213056000,,424,4.929577464788732

This animated feature should have been put on Sci Fi Channel, but the suggestiveness would been too strong for American TV.

To reveal the plot would spoil the fun for you who would buy and watch this satire. Lets just say our heroes need to protect a bratty foul mouth Princess..and let your imaginations run wild with their antics

This funny satire spoofs and parodies  everyone and everything science fiction and fantasy with charm of a BULL ELPHANT..But that is what makes this film something to get. and that alone is why you should get the series and this movie on DVD

3090020,3,B0012IX34Y,"In a measure of full discloser, I have never seen an episode of Tripping the Rift, or could even tell you what channel it is on, before checking out the aptly titled Tripping the Rift: The Movie. So this review is from that point of view and if you are a longtime fan of the show you may want to skip this review.

For those that haven't seen the show, it wants to believe it is South Park meets Star Trek in that the characters are fowl mouthed in a setting of space. But the planets that they visit should look familiar because they are all based on pop culture. First the crew head to a black and white setting reminiscent of the old Frankenstein, followed by trips to an Indiana Jones themed planet before going low key on Hysteria Lane surround by desperate, albeit green, housewives.

The lead cartoon Chode (voiced by Office Space's Stephen Root) is your typical purple captain who cares more about sex than, well, just about everything else combines. Which could explain the inclusion of Six (voiced by Singled Out's Jenny McCarthy) in the crew, a sex slave cyborg. Rounding out the rest of the crew is Chode's inept nephew Whip, T'nuk, who sounds like a combination of every lunch lady ever (prudes and females in general may not want to spell her name backwards), and the ambiguously gay robot Gus. Although they should have learned from Ace and Gary, ambiguously gay dudes are much funnier in pairs.

Also thrown in the mix for the movie is a killer robot clown from the future sent back in time to kill Chode. Yes this is an obvious Terminator reference, but instead of going into a biker bar to get cloths, it is a bar that launches plenty of Gus jokes. There are plenty of decent laughs throughout the movie that it almost makes me want to hunt down where the television show airs. Almost.",1210377600,,1803,4.490853658536586

3090022,1,B0012IX34Y,"In the first season the writers were content to let the audience get the jokes based on a few witty comments and the well crafted animation. By this point they seem to have run out of both patience and wit.

One flaming queen of a robot is amusing, an entire bar-full of stereotypes, not so much.

With the exception of Six all of the character designs are rather hideous to look at and the timing, jokes, plot and appearance just feel like the writers are coasting.",1210204800,,466,4.406976744186046
3090023,3,B0012IX34Y,"While I love the series TtR & would have loved to see a movie version of it, I guess I'd have to clarify that I'd like to see an ORIGINAL movie of the series. This ""movie"" is actually 3 episodes from the last season strung together with a thinly fleshed out plotline that is new to the movie. While the episodes are still great, that doesn't mean that they're great enough to string together for a movie. It's actually a bit of a ripoff. Sure, the movie original plotline isn't bad, but it was never really given the chance to shine on it's own.

In order to string the episodes together better, the voices were redubbed & given lines that coincide with the movie plotline rather than the lines that were originally in the episodes. Once in a while you can see where the voices don't match up to the animation's lips. They do a relatively good job of making sure they match up, but you can't fix everything. Also, while I like Jenny McCarthy, she's not a very good Six. Her voice is just well... empty in this role. She lacks the warmth, intelligence, & sensuality that the previous actresses had while they were playing that role. Jenny just sounds like the biggest contribution she made to the role was showing up that day & trying to make her voice sound like the previous Sixes. (My question is why didn't they try a little harder to hire back one of the previous Sixes?) Let's face it, Six is one of the main reasons people watch, even if they're a straight girl. Her character is witty, sexy, caring, & ultimately the most intelligent personalities on the show. There's a lot to like in that character & she's survived many different voice actresses who have each brought something new to the character. Jenny brought nothing new & actually detracted from the role Six plays in the series.

Would I recommend this? Um... I'm a little undecided at that. I guess I would as a rental, but not as a purchase unless you absolutely *had* to complete your set. The voice acting by McCarthy is pretty bad & she's a pale imitation of the previous Sixes, which is what really makes the movie so unbearable at times.",1209945600,,2111,4.48051948051948

In contrast the former's nice looking computer animation and varyingly clever movie and TV parodies are mostly combined with foul language and crude sexual humor that usually ceases to be laugh out loud funny by one's early teens.  The result is both unsuitable for family viewing AND unwilling to push the envelope very far.  To take one example, jokes about Gratuitous Nudity might be funnier if their WERE some,... nudity that is.  Gratuitous NON-nudity seems more than a little pointless.

3090025,2,B0012IX34Y,"""Tripping The Rift: The Movie"" isn't as funny as it's creators seem to think it is.

The plot--a Terminator-like cybord that looks like a clown is hunting Chode to kill him. Chode and the crew are clueless as to why the clownborg is looking for him but, as usual, it's Chode's own fault and he can't help but try and blame someone else for it.

""Tripping the Rift"" can be amusing. The operative word here is CAN but beyond the initial segment which spoofs ""Young Frankenstein"" (how can you spoof a spoof? Hit the same obvious targets repeatedly...)with some amusing twist and turns to the plot. The ""plot"" finds Chode and his crew stuck on a planet where they are body guards to the princess from hell. They're supposed to protect her from harm at the expense of their lives. Naturally they fail and this forces Chode and his crew to improvise something that seems to come naturally whenever they screw something up.

Most of the rest of the targets from ""The Terminator"" to ""Desperate Housewives"" aren't really rewarding material for comedy ""Rifts"". The extras are minimal featuring brief interviews with the various actors that provide the voices for the characters.

If you must see this, I'd recommend renting it first.",1209168000,,1223,4.781990521327014
3090026,1,B0012IX34Y,"Ok, I've been a big fan of Tripping the Rift since it was first showed on Sci-fi. i own all seasons and watch them about once a month or every two months or so. It's just one of the great shows that you can watch repeatedly. I saw this in the store yesterday and figured that it had to be good. Well, I was severely wrong. First off, they did even have the same people doing some of the voices so that immediately messed up the flow of things. If you've ever watched the show, Carmen Electra does the voice of Six, well, Jenny McCarthy does the voice in this one and I think the writers and producers knew that it wasn't going to fly so Six says like 5 or 6 sentences the entire movie. If you're a fan, you know she talks almost as much as Chode. Another thing they really did poor with was time filling. I think to make it a movie, they just combined 3 episodes into one, 3 poorly written episodes at that. It was such a bad movie, it couldn't hold mine or my wifes attention. I actually almost fell asleep watching this, and it was 6 o'clock in the afternoon! The next thing they did bad was language. I'd expect curse words from this show, if I don't get them I'm mad! :) Well, they went too far in this movie. I use certain words all the time so I have no problem with language, but this was done so poorly that it just wasn't funny or attention getting. I think, to push the barrier of what they could do, the writers had Chode saying a curse word as every other word in his sentences. Basically, rather than saying, ""Holy S***! That's F****** HUGE!"", he would say something like, ""G**D*** That's a F****** Huge A** Son-of-a-***** F******* Thing right F******* There!"". The use of curse words was soooooo poor that you couldn't understand what they were saying half the time.

Overall, this was an abomination and a disgrace to the Tripping the Rift series. The writers of this should be taken out to a field, made to dig a hole, then shot and buried in the hole they dug. I would never recommend this to anyone and really wish I could get my money back. This won't make it from the Tv to my DVD stand it's that bad. I'm giving it away as soon as I can. hopefully someone else will get stuck with it. DO NOT BUY!!!!!!!!!!! PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE, DO NOT BUY!!!!!

3090048,2,B0012IX34Y,"I like Sci Fi. I Like animation. I like low-brow comedy. This should have been a movie I loved, right? Eh.

First, the writing was poor. The vast majority of the jokes were predictable, hackneyed, and cliche. There was a loose plot line, which went mostly out the window for the major subplots. The subplots were basically three movie/tv parodies loosely scrapped together without much coherence.

Of course, the box makes a big to-do over the fact that this is an unrated filth-fest. What they mean by this is that there is a lot of gratuitous swearing. I mean gratuitous in the real sense of the word - swearing for no apparent reason.

I'm no prude but the swearing seemed to be shoehorned into the dialogue to provide shock value (which it didn't). How many times can you hear a character slap the f-word in front of the subject of his sentence before it becomes boring? Well, you're going to get that a lot. A good comedy writer could have a field day with flinging insults between characters, which makes it disappointing when they mostly fling standard expletives at each other.

The comedic timing is way off (mostly too slow), and the dialogue seems cobbled together. I'm guessing the voice actors each recorded their lines separately and the sound editor did what he could to put them together.

The CG animation is good and visually very interesting.

The ""star studded"" voice cast includes ""stuttering"" John Melendez and Jenny McCarthy.

The DVD extra is ""Making of Tripping the Rift"". This is nothing more than a couple of very short interviews with the voice actors.",1208908800,22,1580,4.7655677655677655

3090050,2,B0012IX34Y,"I am a funny guy. Professional grade.

I've done comedy improv. I've appeared in plays where comedy is the main focus.

So my humble opinion is not just that of the lay person.

This is not a horrible movie. It has a lot of good stuff, unfortunately, most of it is in the first of the many blantant ripoffs of various movies/tv shows this film slides through.

The least effective is the ham-fisted Desperate Housewives ripoff. But most of the film is a blur. One lame attempt at humor after another.

The only one that had a lot of of the proper nudge-nudge, wink-wink is the silly and wonderous Young Frankenstein segment that opens the film. The biggest reason this section works is that they had a LOT to work with. Desperate Housewives is a hollow shell of a show, and this hollow shell of a movie only points that out.

I enjoyed the first season of the show, and even though other seasons happened. The basic physics of the show have not changed. You have a idiot boss, Chode, who is at least as stupid as your average TV head of household. He spouts ugly, sexist, homophobic humor, even though he is the root cause of all his own problems. He can't keep himself under control.

And like many TV protagonists, his eventual salvation is mostly a product of his own dumb luck.

There is a modest overlay of a story (using aspects of Terminator 2) but this isn't a movie you're going to remember 5 minutes after it ends. I honestly can't recall many of the movies this thing rips off. I see the tag list and I don't remember hardly any of them.

But if you liked the series, and this thing is on TV, there are worse ways to kill an hour and fifteen minutes.",1208390400,,1661,4.349514563106796
3090051,1,B0012IX34Y,"I remember catching a couple of episodes of this show on the scifi channel awhile back. It wasn't too bad. It was edgey and full of hit or miss science fiction fan humor. So when I saw a movie was available I expected at least a decent 90 minute distraction from the world. Now maybe I'm wrong but when a group of writers get together to write a comedic script don't they have to actually put JOKES into the movie? I'm trying to rack my brain wondering where and when they expected the audience to laugh at this thing. Not only was it completely devoid of humor but it tried to replace jokes with gross out shots or cuss words. I love raunchy humor like South Park but not when it can't be supported with characters I care about or jokes that leave me on the floor in tears. This movie is just astoundingly dull. Its just not funny, not in any way shape or form. The writers didn't WRITE ANY JOKES. How that is even possible is beyond me but if this is the end product they really need to go back to the drawing board and reassess their career choice. Don't waste your money. No one deserves a pay day for this dreck. Futurama is a better investment I recommend BENDERS BIG SCORE instead as a much funnier and over all better product for your hard earned cash.",1208390400,3,1260,4.254166666666666

The DVD had its moments, there were some good gags but most of the jokes are basically restricted to T&A jokes, sexuall innuendos and foul language just for the sake of being more ""adult"".

3090054,1,B0012IX34Y,"The back cover of the DVD case screams, ""Foul Language!  Senseless Violence!  Gratuitous Nudity!  It's A Real #@!*&% Movie!""  While that last claim may be stretching the boundaries of the definition of ""movie"", I vastly agree that those promises have been fulfilled.

But there is a problem.

Despite all the rudeness, despite all the over-the-top excesses, despite all the foul language and salty dialog, the movie is not actually funny.

Now, before criticizing the film's drawbacks, it should be noted that this almost can't be considered a movie at all.  According to information I spent sheer minutes researching on the Internet, this is not a feature-length movie based on the television series of the same name.  Rather this is three or four random episodes of said television series edited together into a seventy-five minute whole.  The story-line jerks wildly from place to place with no thought given to structure or pacing.  Audiences won't have been this confused since Robert Denby randomly appeared halfway through RIDING WITH DEATH with only a crudely attempted ADR to explain his presence.

Out of a sense of obligation rather than for any real desire on my part, I will attempt to give a brief summary.  A band of intergalactic misfits travel around the galaxy and have adventures; think ""Futurama"" but with more sleaze and less laughter. In this film, they get hired as bodyguards for a princess, plan a birthday part for Chode (the short, purple, tentacled thing), escape from a robotic assassin of the future, and hang out in an episode of Desperate Housewives.

There are a lot of movie and television parodies, but the film doesn't do anything interesting with the source material.  The producers mostly just repeat scenes from other films without actually making them funny (or even different).  And that's emblematic of this film's main flaw.  It goes to a lot of trouble to set up a platform on which to tell jokes, and then it completely forgets to tell jokes.

I could almost forgive this film had it tried its hand at comedy but failed.  The problem is that it barely even tries.  It seems to believe that naughty language by itself will make anyone laugh.  It confuses simple duplication of well-known cinematic set pieces with parody.  And it simply gives up when attempting new material.  These days, there are a lot of choices when looking for science-fiction comedies; try one of those other options instead.",1208304000,2,2442,4.960591133004926

Chode gets himself in some procreatin' trouble and is chased by a Terminator from the future, across a black and white horror parody, settling back in a Desperate Housewives segment and pursued through an Indiana jones jungle adventure. And that's just the overview: tons of dirty, foul-mouthed gags that are lowest common denominator one-liners and that's it in a nutshell. If your concept of humor is Adult Swimmin' through animated vulgarity, well, you're probably one of my buddies. RIFT's a darn funny DVD that you can hang back with among your idiot buds and cheap pizza to watch.

3090057,2,B0012IX34Y,"It's an acquired taste.

Tripping the Rift (the television series) is a hands-off parody of many of the current ""hit"" sci-fi and fantasy shows.  Lead character Captain Chode (a topologically equivalent Gumby) has sex and fortune on the brain... at all times.  His crew, a bizarre and unmatched collection of a lizard nephew, a sex slave android, a three-breasted cross between a cow and a centaur, a gay C-3PO, and a neurotic HAL 9000, roam the galaxy having... ""sex and fortune on the brain"" -related adventures that tend to spoof the other sci-fi and fantasy shows.

As a fan of shows like Futurama and The Simpsons, and movies like Galaxy Quest and Spaceballs, I appreciate this creative finger-poking.  The television series is a fast-paced romp through a sci-fi fantasy land.

Then there is Tripping the Rift (the movie).

First, I would guess that the movie makes little sense to the Tripping the Rift neophyte.  Just who ARE these characters, and why are they the way they are?

Then, the plot and action of the movie is, well, boring.  The writers try to bring in elements of Desperate Housewives, The Terminator, Star Trek, Young Frankenstein, and other shows for... the sake of doing it.  Frankly, it doesn't work.  The plot falters because the focus seems to be on the parody gags, and not the story.

So... if you are intrigued by what you've heard about Tripping the Rift, stick with the television series.  Don't feel bad... this happened to The Simpsons' movie as well.",1208044800,,1484,4.8142292490118574

Will Chode's struggle to survive interfere with his throwing the thriftiest birthday bash ever?

I have to admit that this was my first time really sitting and watching an entire tale of the computer-animated saga ""Tripping the Rift"". One would think ""The Movie"" would be an okay way to be introduced to it. However, I had sampled bits of the TV series a few times before and judged it to be overloaded with sex jokes that simply weren't very funny, and the movie turned out to be exactly that way too. The making-of featurette on the DVD, which has some great interviews from a cast that boasts some well-respected voice talents like Maurice LaMarche and Stephen Root, gives the impression that the series itself might be a bit smarter than this rather messy movie, but I'd have to see it to believe it. There's really nothing clever about this film at all. Besides mostly unfunny sex jokes and gay jokes galore, the only other real attempt at humor is through spoofing famous films and TV shows. Unfortunately, this also isn't done too well most of the time. The Terminator parodying wasn't bad, but the rest was hit and miss, and mostly miss. For example, in the beginning, they do a ""Young Frankenstein"" spoof. Look, you can't really spoof a spoof. It's not that funny. The best you can do in that case is rip-off jokes. The filmmakers also seem to think that foul language is hilarious for adult animation viewers. Look, I love some movies that have very foul language, but never for the foul language itself. In this film it seemed totally gratuitous. Now and then, okay, but nearly every other world? I wasn't buying it. In the end, it hurt the film. And, with all this sex talk, they could have made it a lot more titillating. It really wasn't very. The ""sexy"" females really never were very attractive, not even Chode's own sex slave, Six, whose face and hair are so awful the overdone rest of her doesn't matter much. Of course, I've never gone for the porn star look, and I'm sure that's what they were going for. Overall, you might get a few chuckles out of this one, but it's by no means a ""must see"". If you're looking for animation geared more towards adults, check out the original ""Heavy Metal"", or other classics like ""American Pop"" and ""Rock and Rule"", certain shows from Cartoon Network's Adult Swim (Futurama is a better answer to this sort of humor, and Family Guy is great too), or the huge selection of Anime out there (which is a much better place to look if you want something sexy). And don't underestimate the smartness and adult-appeal of stuff you may think is just for kids at first glance, like Disney or Garfield. Anyone can enjoy animation, but there is far better animation out there than this one. It's okay for one viewing if you're really curious, and I suppose you might love it if you love the ""Tripping the Rift"" the TV show. Besides the making of featurette, the trailer is also included, and the presentation is in anamorphic widescreen.",1207958400,,3404,4.6544850498338874
3090084,1,B0012IX34Y,"If you were on death row and only had 75 minutes until your execution, Tripping the Rift (The Movie) would be the perfect movie to see:  that hour-and-a-quarter would seem to take forever and at the end of it, you'd probably welcome death.  As you might guess, I was not very impressed with this movie.

Based on a TV show that I've admittedly never seen, Tripping the Rift is obviously just a few episodes strung together loosely.  The principal character is Chode, a sex-obsessed purple alien, who goes traveling the galaxy with his little crew of aliens and a robot named Six (who is in the form of a beautiful woman).  Their adventures are crude parodies of such films and TV shows as Young Frankenstein and Desperate Housewives, with a Terminator-ish plot stringing the tales together.

Tripping the Rift is apparently designed for that narrow demographic of teenage boys who have passed puberty but have not developed the intellectual capacity to realize that this supposed animated comedy offers nothing more than recycled jokes and dozens of chesty women.  If you like comic sci-fi, try out Futurama.  If you like tasteless humor - and I often do - try South Park or Family Guy.

I should probably say that I am unfamiliar with the TV show...but I do think these kind of spin-off films, if successful, should be able to stand on their own. The Futurama movie could, the Simpsons movie could...but this one really falls flat. As many have commented, it feels like 2-3 episodes stuck together (a space princess mission, a Desperate Housewives parody, and a Terminator knockoff, which provides the thread that links everything). It's disjointed and a bit stilted.

Futurama, to me, seems an apt comparison: a crew of mismatched alien creatures trawl the galaxy in a junky ship looking for adventure and opportunity. While Futurama excels at multi-level, existential plotlines rich with both witty, sophisticated humor and more simple-minded gaffaws, Tripping the Rift feels forced and cynical. Frankly, it's not dirty enough to be titillating or exciting, but it's not savvy enough to be provocative or enlightening...it just feels like a bunch of weird characters swearing at another, yelling, humping, and narrowly avoiding catastrophe.

Bottom line is, there is much better trashy fun stuff than this...I would be curious to check out the series, as folks here imply that it is much better than this.

The movie is more of the same, only the movie has more of a plotline to give and many of the jokes seem less like one-liners and more like they were thought-out.

Will you like the movie? Well, I wouldn't go as far as calling it art but, if you enjoyed the series or like some of your jokes really really wrong then you might like this. I personally found the movie to be a lot of fun but have to say that it lived up to its negative lashings as well.

3090124,2,B0012IX34Y,"Tripping the Rift is a TV show originally created as a short 3d animated film named ""Love and Darph"" in 1998. The concept was picked up by the Sci-Fi channel in 2002 and aired in 2004 through 2005. It was canceled and was picked up again in 2007. It has had a total of three seasons so far. The third season was not aired in the United States.

As a television show, it tends to rely on low humor, site gags, sex jokes and potty humor.  Plots of the show often revolved around the libido of the purple blob, Chode, the show's central character. His crew, which includes a loudmouth quadruped alien, a sex-bot, a gay robot and a lizard, provide zany antics to complicate things.  The antagonist to Chode is his arch-nemesis, Bobo the clown, a goofy Darth Vader type character with a clown-head and a lisp.

Despite the low brow humor, as a show, at least for the first season, it was somewhat original and clever. It's off the wall humor that made fun of famous sci-fi films and TV along with goofy story lines created a somewhat entertaining show.  I always saw it as something of a guilty pleasure.

The four episodes that are sliced and diced together are ""Chode Eraser,"" ""Skankenstein,""  ""Raiders of the Lost Crock of */@?#!,"" and ""Witness Protection.""

Unfortunately, if this is what the show has become, I must say I'm rather glad it's not being inflicted on US audiences any more. I have not seen any of the episodes of the third season of the show, but I can say that based on what I've seen of the movie, it's lost all of its charm and much of its humor.

The writing has gone downhill in a major way with the plots now just random parodies on TV shows and movies with very little in the way of original humor. The jokes and gags are formulaic and clich'd.  The first season of the show was far more original, and funny, both in plot and humor.

Even more noticeable is the voicework by Jenny McCarthy, who now plays Six (replacing Gina Gershon and Carmon Electra). McCarthy is really bad in the role. Gina Gershon gave Six bite, a sexy tone and interesting character. McCarthy sounds bored and toneless. Of course, writing doesn't help any.

So far as the plot of the movie, while Tripping the Rift's brand of comedy is not something you can expect to be strong on plot, this movie hardly has one at all. The story involves a terminator-like clown chasing after Chode to kill him, but the rest of the film ends up with the characters jumping into one unrelated b-story after another. Nothing fits together and undoubtedly, this Frankenstein like mess hurts everything, since they have no relation to one another at all.

I suppose that's what you get when you cram four 30 minute episodes into a 75 minute film. It certainly was unfunny and boring. I think I laughed out loud once during the entire thing, and the laugh I made was mostly a snort.

On the DVD side, this release is fairly barebones. It includes the movie, a trailer, and a making of featurette. The featurette doesn't say much, though you get to see what some of the voice actors look like.

Bottom line:
Overall, this is one to avoid. It's an unfunny movie made up of 4 episodes of the show that don't fit together. Rent it maybe if you're a fan of the show, but be prepared to be disappointed.",1206921600,2,3483,4.444270015698587
3090125,3,B0012IX34Y,"... but if you don't like the show or find it best taken in small doses, then this movie might be a bit much for you. It certainly goes farther than the show, but do we really need to see naked computer women ogled by aliens and whatnot? I say we need the REAL Jenny McCarthy to do a TTR movie, where we get to see an actual person, um, naked. Okay, that doesn't sound very ""sane,"" but you have to be into juvenile humor (and juvenile *attempts* at humor) to enjoy Tripping the Rift: The Movie.

As the man said: ""For people who like this kind of thing, you will find this the kind of thing you like.""",1206921600,,601,4.050420168067227
3090126,4,B0012IX34Y,"'Tripping the Rift' is 'Adult', comic relief from reality with some delightful new voices who were clearly having great fun with their animated characters. The story spoofs on many familiar movies and stereotypes. It took some getting used to when the film went from color to black and white in different scenes, but my eyes adjusted. I found other interesting movies in the previews that I plan to check out, such as 'Hatchet' and the horror movie 'Wrestle Maniac'. Please note that while this movie is an 'Animation', the humor is for adults only.

3090127,3,B0012IX34Y,"I have never seen the TV series, but the ads for it intrigued me. I think I would have appreciated this movie more if I had seen the series and was more involved with the characters and their development.

In addition to the movie, there is a short ""making of"" featurette, and I enjoyed that as much as I did the movie (but then, I like the behind the scenes stuff). I would have liked even more of that. The animation is pretty good, as are the production values.

It is truly funny. Not all of the humor is to my liking, but there are some great lines and situations. The subtle and not-so-subtle satire and parody is the best part, and I wish there was more of that in the blend. It is very irreverent, extremely nasty, gross at times, and mostly very silly. Think more Cheech and Chong than Firesign Theater.

It is definitely NOT for kids, unless we are talking the ten year-old in a 25 year-old body (and I know a few who would love this). It is fast paced and not very deep, but then it is a comedy. Sort of sexy, gross, drive-by comedy.

It has been likened to South Park, but I haven't ever watched that, so I can't comment on that comparison. One of the actors in the featurette describes it as Star Wars meets the porn industry. I would add in a healthy dose of The Three Stooges (now THAT dates me).

It is not something I will watch over and over again, like Firefly, but I am definitely interested in seeing the TV series now. If you like this kind of humor, it is definitely worth a look.",1206835200,,1503,4.204861111111111

3324476,1,B0012IX34Y,"""Tripping the Rift: The Movie"" is as unpleasant an animated viewing experience as can be imagined. I like science fiction, parody, and comedy, all of which this movie purport to be. Unfortunately the film is nothing but a boring 75 minute exhibition of toilet humor with no coherent plot, and characters that were universally loathsome. It's rare that five minutes into a film I am wishing the entire cast to be annihilated in a cataclysmic event, but such was the case here. Although it is only 75 minutes long, it took me five sittings to get through this steaming pile.

The film has excellent animation. That is where my praise ends. The film features a pointless blend of color and black and white, and attempts to parody numerous earlier works and includes elements reminiscent of ""Star Trek"", ""Star Wars"", ""Alien"", ""Saturday Night Fever"", ""Frankenstein"" (obviously), and every Tim Burton movie ever made, but on balance reminded me mostly of a cross between ""Weekend at Bernie's"" and ""Killer Klowns From Outer Space."" The film consists of numerous subplots (clown pregnancy, Slovenian Princess reanimation, and even less tasteful delvings into suicide and flatus), none of which go anywhere. Just when the plot seems to be becoming coherent it veers wildly in a new direction. Perhaps that could have something to do with the origin of the film as multiple episodes of a Canadian television show sliced and diced together. Sound good? It's not.

When I bought the film I thought it could be a creative and funny satire. Instead it's a great glob of preadolescent non-humor that makes little sense, utterly fails to entertain, and provokes outright hostility to the characters. Evil extraterrestrial clowns are a great choice for science fiction parody, but save yourself the torture of watching this and get ""Killer Klowns From Outer Space"" instead if you are determined to explore the genre.",1245974400,,1899,5.044585987261146

So this review is from that point of view and if you are a longtime fan of the show you may want to skip this review.

For those that haven't seen the show, it wants to believe it is South Park meets Star Trek in that the characters are fowl mouthed in a setting of space. But the planets that they visit should look familiar because they are all based on pop culture. First the crew head to a black and white setting reminiscent of the old Frankenstein, followed by trips to an Indiana Jones themed planet before going low key on Hysteria Lane surround by desperate, albeit green, housewives.

The lead cartoon Chode (voiced by Office Space's Stephen Root) is your typical purple captain who cares more about sex than, well, just about everything else combines. Which could explain the inclusion of Six (voiced by Singled Out's Jenny McCarthy) in the crew, a sex slave cyborg. Rounding out the rest of the crew is Chode's inept nephew Whip, T'nuk, who sounds like a combination of every lunch lady ever (prudes and females in general may not want to spell her name backwards), and the ambiguously gay robot Gus. Although they should have learned from Ace and Gary, ambiguously gay dudes are much funnier in pairs.

Also thrown in the mix for the movie is a killer robot clown from the future sent back in time to kill Chode. Yes this is an obvious Terminator reference, but instead of going into a biker bar to get cloths, it is a bar that launches plenty of Gus jokes. There are plenty of decent laughs throughout the movie that it almost makes me want to hunt down where the television show airs. Almost.",1210377600,,1803,4.490853658536586

3324520,3,B0012IX34Y,"While I love the series TtR & would have loved to see a movie version of it, I guess I'd have to clarify that I'd like to see an ORIGINAL movie of the series. This ""movie"" is actually 3 episodes from the last season strung together with a thinly fleshed out plotline that is new to the movie. While the episodes are still great, that doesn't mean that they're great enough to string together for a movie. It's actually a bit of a ripoff. Sure, the movie original plotline isn't bad, but it was never really given the chance to shine on it's own.

In order to string the episodes together better, the voices were redubbed & given lines that coincide with the movie plotline rather than the lines that were originally in the episodes. Once in a while you can see where the voices don't match up to the animation's lips. They do a relatively good job of making sure they match up, but you can't fix everything. Also, while I like Jenny McCarthy, she's not a very good Six. Her voice is just well... empty in this role. She lacks the warmth, intelligence, & sensuality that the previous actresses had while they were playing that role. Jenny just sounds like the biggest contribution she made to the role was showing up that day & trying to make her voice sound like the previous Sixes. (My question is why didn't they try a little harder to hire back one of the previous Sixes?) Let's face it, Six is one of the main reasons people watch, even if they're a straight girl. Her character is witty, sexy, caring, & ultimately the most intelligent personalities on the show. There's a lot to like in that character & she's survived many different voice actresses who have each brought something new to the character. Jenny brought nothing new & actually detracted from the role Six plays in the series.

Would I recommend this? Um... I'm a little undecided at that. I guess I would as a rental, but not as a purchase unless you absolutely *had* to complete your set. The voice acting by McCarthy is pretty bad & she's a pale imitation of the previous Sixes, which is what really makes the movie so unbearable at times.",1209945600,,2111,4.48051948051948

3324522,2,B0012IX34Y,"""Tripping The Rift: The Movie"" isn't as funny as it's creators seem to think it is.

The plot--a Terminator-like cybord that looks like a clown is hunting Chode to kill him. Chode and the crew are clueless as to why the clownborg is looking for him but, as usual, it's Chode's own fault and he can't help but try and blame someone else for it.

""Tripping the Rift"" can be amusing. The operative word here is CAN but beyond the initial segment which spoofs ""Young Frankenstein"" (how can you spoof a spoof? Hit the same obvious targets repeatedly...)with some amusing twist and turns to the plot. The ""plot"" finds Chode and his crew stuck on a planet where they are body guards to the princess from hell. They're supposed to protect her from harm at the expense of their lives. Naturally they fail and this forces Chode and his crew to improvise something that seems to come naturally whenever they screw something up.

Most of the rest of the targets from ""The Terminator"" to ""Desperate Housewives"" aren't really rewarding material for comedy ""Rifts"". The extras are minimal featuring brief interviews with the various actors that provide the voices for the characters.

If you must see this, I'd recommend renting it first.",1209168000,,1223,4.781990521327014
3324523,1,B0012IX34Y,"Ok, I've been a big fan of Tripping the Rift since it was first showed on Sci-fi. i own all seasons and watch them about once a month or every two months or so. It's just one of the great shows that you can watch repeatedly. I saw this in the store yesterday and figured that it had to be good. Well, I was severely wrong. First off, they did even have the same people doing some of the voices so that immediately messed up the flow of things. If you've ever watched the show, Carmen Electra does the voice of Six, well, Jenny McCarthy does the voice in this one and I think the writers and producers knew that it wasn't going to fly so Six says like 5 or 6 sentences the entire movie. If you're a fan, you know she talks almost as much as Chode. Another thing they really did poor with was time filling. I think to make it a movie, they just combined 3 episodes into one, 3 poorly written episodes at that. It was such a bad movie, it couldn't hold mine or my wifes attention. I actually almost fell asleep watching this, and it was 6 o'clock in the afternoon! The next thing they did bad was language. I'd expect curse words from this show, if I don't get them I'm mad! :) Well, they went too far in this movie. I use certain words all the time so I have no problem with language, but this was done so poorly that it just wasn't funny or attention getting. I think, to push the barrier of what they could do, the writers had Chode saying a curse word as every other word in his sentences. Basically, rather than saying, ""Holy S***! That's F****** HUGE!"", he would say something like, ""G**D*** That's a F****** Huge A** Son-of-a-***** F******* Thing right F******* There!"". The use of curse words was soooooo poor that you couldn't understand what they were saying half the time.

Overall, this was an abomination and a disgrace to the Tripping the Rift series. The writers of this should be taken out to a field, made to dig a hole, then shot and buried in the hole they dug. I would never recommend this to anyone and really wish I could get my money back. This won't make it from the Tv to my DVD stand it's that bad.

3324545,2,B0012IX34Y,"I like Sci Fi. I Like animation. I like low-brow comedy. This should have been a movie I loved, right? Eh.

First, the writing was poor. The vast majority of the jokes were predictable, hackneyed, and cliche. There was a loose plot line, which went mostly out the window for the major subplots. The subplots were basically three movie/tv parodies loosely scrapped together without much coherence.

Of course, the box makes a big to-do over the fact that this is an unrated filth-fest. What they mean by this is that there is a lot of gratuitous swearing. I mean gratuitous in the real sense of the word - swearing for no apparent reason.

I'm no prude but the swearing seemed to be shoehorned into the dialogue to provide shock value (which it didn't). How many times can you hear a character slap the f-word in front of the subject of his sentence before it becomes boring? Well, you're going to get that a lot. A good comedy writer could have a field day with flinging insults between characters, which makes it disappointing when they mostly fling standard expletives at each other.

The comedic timing is way off (mostly too slow), and the dialogue seems cobbled together. I'm guessing the voice actors each recorded their lines separately and the sound editor did what he could to put them together.

The CG animation is good and visually very interesting.

The ""star studded"" voice cast includes ""stuttering"" John Melendez and Jenny McCarthy.

The DVD extra is ""Making of Tripping the Rift"". This is nothing more than a couple of very short interviews with the voice actors.",1208908800,22,1580,4.7655677655677655

I've done comedy improv. I've appeared in plays where comedy is the main focus.

So my humble opinion is not just that of the lay person.

This is not a horrible movie. It has a lot of good stuff, unfortunately, most of it is in the first of the many blantant ripoffs of various movies/tv shows this film slides through.

The least effective is the ham-fisted Desperate Housewives ripoff. But most of the film is a blur. One lame attempt at humor after another.

The only one that had a lot of of the proper nudge-nudge, wink-wink is the silly and wonderous Young Frankenstein segment that opens the film. The biggest reason this section works is that they had a LOT to work with. Desperate Housewives is a hollow shell of a show, and this hollow shell of a movie only points that out.

I enjoyed the first season of the show, and even though other seasons happened. The basic physics of the show have not changed. You have a idiot boss, Chode, who is at least as stupid as your average TV head of household. He spouts ugly, sexist, homophobic humor, even though he is the root cause of all his own problems. He can't keep himself under control.

And like many TV protagonists, his eventual salvation is mostly a product of his own dumb luck.

There is a modest overlay of a story (using aspects of Terminator 2) but this isn't a movie you're going to remember 5 minutes after it ends. I honestly can't recall many of the movies this thing rips off. I see the tag list and I don't remember hardly any of them.

So when I saw a movie was available I expected at least a decent 90 minute distraction from the world. Now maybe I'm wrong but when a group of writers get together to write a comedic script don't they have to actually put JOKES into the movie? I'm trying to rack my brain wondering where and when they expected the audience to laugh at this thing. Not only was it completely devoid of humor but it tried to replace jokes with gross out shots or cuss words. I love raunchy humor like South Park but not when it can't be supported with characters I care about or jokes that leave me on the floor in tears. This movie is just astoundingly dull. Its just not funny, not in any way shape or form. The writers didn't WRITE ANY JOKES. How that is even possible is beyond me but if this is the end product they really need to go back to the drawing board and reassess their career choice. Don't waste your money. No one deserves a pay day for this dreck.

But there is a problem.

Despite all the rudeness, despite all the over-the-top excesses, despite all the foul language and salty dialog, the movie is not actually funny.

Now, before criticizing the film's drawbacks, it should be noted that this almost can't be considered a movie at all.  According to information I spent sheer minutes researching on the Internet, this is not a feature-length movie based on the television series of the same name.  Rather this is three or four random episodes of said television series edited together into a seventy-five minute whole.  The story-line jerks wildly from place to place with no thought given to structure or pacing.  Audiences won't have been this confused since Robert Denby randomly appeared halfway through RIDING WITH DEATH with only a crudely attempted ADR to explain his presence.

Out of a sense of obligation rather than for any real desire on my part, I will attempt to give a brief summary.  A band of intergalactic misfits travel around the galaxy and have adventures; think ""Futurama"" but with more sleaze and less laughter. In this film, they get hired as bodyguards for a princess, plan a birthday part for Chode (the short, purple, tentacled thing), escape from a robotic assassin of the future, and hang out in an episode of Desperate Housewives.

There are a lot of movie and television parodies, but the film doesn't do anything interesting with the source material.  The producers mostly just repeat scenes from other films without actually making them funny (or even different).  And that's emblematic of this film's main flaw.  It goes to a lot of trouble to set up a platform on which to tell jokes, and then it completely forgets to tell jokes.

I could almost forgive this film had it tried its hand at comedy but failed.  The problem is that it barely even tries.  It seems to believe that naughty language by itself will make anyone laugh.  It confuses simple duplication of well-known cinematic set pieces with parody.  And it simply gives up when attempting new material.  These days, there are a lot of choices when looking for science-fiction comedies; try one of those other options instead.",1208304000,2,2442,4.960591133004926

And that's just the overview: tons of dirty, foul-mouthed gags that are lowest common denominator one-liners and that's it in a nutshell. If your concept of humor is Adult Swimmin' through animated vulgarity, well, you're probably one of my buddies.

3324554,2,B0012IX34Y,"It's an acquired taste.

Tripping the Rift (the television series) is a hands-off parody of many of the current ""hit"" sci-fi and fantasy shows.  Lead character Captain Chode (a topologically equivalent Gumby) has sex and fortune on the brain... at all times.  His crew, a bizarre and unmatched collection of a lizard nephew, a sex slave android, a three-breasted cross between a cow and a centaur, a gay C-3PO, and a neurotic HAL 9000, roam the galaxy having... ""sex and fortune on the brain"" -related adventures that tend to spoof the other sci-fi and fantasy shows.

As a fan of shows like Futurama and The Simpsons, and movies like Galaxy Quest and Spaceballs, I appreciate this creative finger-poking.  The television series is a fast-paced romp through a sci-fi fantasy land.

Then there is Tripping the Rift (the movie).

First, I would guess that the movie makes little sense to the Tripping the Rift neophyte.  Just who ARE these characters, and why are they the way they are?

Then, the plot and action of the movie is, well, boring.  The writers try to bring in elements of Desperate Housewives, The Terminator, Star Trek, Young Frankenstein, and other shows for... the sake of doing it.  Frankly, it doesn't work.  The plot falters because the focus seems to be on the parody gags, and not the story.

So... if you are intrigued by what you've heard about Tripping the Rift, stick with the television series.  Don't feel bad... this happened to The Simpsons' movie as well.",1208044800,,1484,4.8142292490118574

I have to admit that this was my first time really sitting and watching an entire tale of the computer-animated saga ""Tripping the Rift"". One would think ""The Movie"" would be an okay way to be introduced to it. However, I had sampled bits of the TV series a few times before and judged it to be overloaded with sex jokes that simply weren't very funny, and the movie turned out to be exactly that way too. The making-of featurette on the DVD, which has some great interviews from a cast that boasts some well-respected voice talents like Maurice LaMarche and Stephen Root, gives the impression that the series itself might be a bit smarter than this rather messy movie, but I'd have to see it to believe it. There's really nothing clever about this film at all. Besides mostly unfunny sex jokes and gay jokes galore, the only other real attempt at humor is through spoofing famous films and TV shows. Unfortunately, this also isn't done too well most of the time. The Terminator parodying wasn't bad, but the rest was hit and miss, and mostly miss. For example, in the beginning, they do a ""Young Frankenstein"" spoof. Look, you can't really spoof a spoof. It's not that funny. The best you can do in that case is rip-off jokes. The filmmakers also seem to think that foul language is hilarious for adult animation viewers. Look, I love some movies that have very foul language, but never for the foul language itself. In this film it seemed totally gratuitous. Now and then, okay, but nearly every other world? I wasn't buying it. In the end, it hurt the film. And, with all this sex talk, they could have made it a lot more titillating. It really wasn't very. The ""sexy"" females really never were very attractive, not even Chode's own sex slave, Six, whose face and hair are so awful the overdone rest of her doesn't matter much. Of course, I've never gone for the porn star look, and I'm sure that's what they were going for. Overall, you might get a few chuckles out of this one, but it's by no means a ""must see"". If you're looking for animation geared more towards adults, check out the original ""Heavy Metal"", or other classics like ""American Pop"" and ""Rock and Rule"", certain shows from Cartoon Network's Adult Swim (Futurama is a better answer to this sort of humor, and Family Guy is great too), or the huge selection of Anime out there (which is a much better place to look if you want something sexy). And don't underestimate the smartness and adult-appeal of stuff you may think is just for kids at first glance, like Disney or Garfield. Anyone can enjoy animation, but there is far better animation out there than this one. It's okay for one viewing if you're really curious, and I suppose you might love it if you love the ""Tripping the Rift"" the TV show. Besides the making of featurette, the trailer is also included, and the presentation is in anamorphic widescreen.",1207958400,,3404,4.6544850498338874

Based on a TV show that I've admittedly never seen, Tripping the Rift is obviously just a few episodes strung together loosely.  The principal character is Chode, a sex-obsessed purple alien, who goes traveling the galaxy with his little crew of aliens and a robot named Six (who is in the form of a beautiful woman).  Their adventures are crude parodies of such films and TV shows as Young Frankenstein and Desperate Housewives, with a Terminator-ish plot stringing the tales together.

Tripping the Rift is apparently designed for that narrow demographic of teenage boys who have passed puberty but have not developed the intellectual capacity to realize that this supposed animated comedy offers nothing more than recycled jokes and dozens of chesty women.  If you like comic sci-fi, try out Futurama.  If you like tasteless humor - and I often do - try South Park or Family Guy.

I should probably say that I am unfamiliar with the TV show...but I do think these kind of spin-off films, if successful, should be able to stand on their own. The Futurama movie could, the Simpsons movie could...but this one really falls flat. As many have commented, it feels like 2-3 episodes stuck together (a space princess mission, a Desperate Housewives parody, and a Terminator knockoff, which provides the thread that links everything). It's disjointed and a bit stilted.

Futurama, to me, seems an apt comparison: a crew of mismatched alien creatures trawl the galaxy in a junky ship looking for adventure and opportunity. While Futurama excels at multi-level, existential plotlines rich with both witty, sophisticated humor and more simple-minded gaffaws, Tripping the Rift feels forced and cynical. Frankly, it's not dirty enough to be titillating or exciting, but it's not savvy enough to be provocative or enlightening...it just feels like a bunch of weird characters swearing at another, yelling, humping, and narrowly avoiding catastrophe.

Bottom line is, there is much better trashy fun stuff than this...I would be curious to check out the series, as folks here imply that it is much better than this.

One the plus side, the voice talent is great. Maurice Lamarche is always fantastic, as is Stephen Root, and Jenny McCarthy is a lot of fun. So that's somethin'!",1207612800,,1633,5.12781954887218

The movie is more of the same, only the movie has more of a plotline to give and many of the jokes seem less like one-liners and more like they were thought-out.

Will you like the movie? Well, I wouldn't go as far as calling it art but, if you enjoyed the series or like some of your jokes really really wrong then you might like this. I personally found the movie to be a lot of fun but have to say that it lived up to its negative lashings as well.

Fleeing from a murderous clown robot intent on being the instrument of Chode's demise, the troupe first accept what they expect to be a piece of cake mission protecting one ornery princess.  That little job quickly proves harder than it sounded, and a simple bodyguard gig turns into something a lot more complicated.  Especially when the clown assassin stalking Chode catches up to them...

Our intrepid crew next find themselves smack dab in the middle of the craziest, horniest little neighborhood they ever saw, complete with a gang of sexy housewives all with a penchant for bedding our three-eyed, purple hero.

The gags are lewd and often just plain silly, but TRIPPING THE RIFT: THE MOVIE makes no pretense at anything other than what it is - pure unadulterated camp.  Go into this film looking for anything other than a piece of pure sexy fun, and you will be disappointed.  Accept it for what it is, and you just may find yourself relaxing and laughing along with the rest of us.

You'll enjoy some twisted spoofs, such as the neighborhood of women that closely resemble a Bizarro-world cast of Desperate Housewives, but the writers of TRIPPING THE RIFT: THE MOVIE never hesitate to take jabs at themselves along with everyone else.  Nothing is sacred, and non one is safe from their irreverent humor, much to viewer's delight!

If you are looking for an important movie that will change your life, then you won't want this movie.  If you are in the mood for some good-natured camp chock full of bawdy jokes, then you'll want to pop this one in your DVD player right away!",1207440000,5,1763,4.710097719869707

It isn't funny, scary, amusing, thrilling, or interesting. It's just a thing taking up space and consuming the time of people wanting a 90-minute escape.

3324587,2,B0012IX34Y,"TRIPPING the RIFT isn't TOTALLY without merit, but there's so much wrong with it, those few things are so hard to find that it makes the move a really pointless adventure.

The entire movie seems, and is, like a slapped together collection of skits making fun of movies like Terminator, Young Frankenstein, Star Trek, The Stepford Wives and others. Then they threw in some big breasted women, some crazy breasted women, a libido that carries over throughout the film, vibrators, dirty magazines and a slew of cuss words.

I don't mind the cuss words. I don't mind the sex. Yet, from the scattered plot, to the cuss words, to the sex, to the random storylines and the empty feeling the entire things gives you, the whole thing is just slapped together and holds no impact and certainly doesn't hold your attention.

I watched the entire film, but after each storyline lasted ten minutes and then they were... in a flash... locked into a different scenario with the same unexcuted jokes, I found myself checked out somewhere about the forty-five minute point... wondering how much was left, but wanting to fulfill my obligation to the amazon review system.

And for what it is, it's really rather good. The animation is well done. The voice acting is good. And there are a lot of larfs...some of the humor might not wear well as time goes on--come on, most of the world is trying to forget ""Apocolypto.""

I have seen some episode before on the SciFi Channel and like the voice actors and some of gags, but I found this DVD to be severly lacking.  As another reviewer states, it looks to be three episodes from the third season edited together, and not very well at that.  And not very interesting episodes either.  The quality of the animation seems to have declined and it overall didn't hold my interest well.

Now I truly wanted to like this, being a fan of scifi and, erm...adult oriented cartoons, but even the gratuitous sexual situations and characters seemed lackluster.  I gave it two stars because I am sure there is an audience out there somewhere for this -- it has a few funny moments.  Also for the many scifi references made and great voice acting.  Six is always fun to look at (pun on the german word for that number). And the sparse behind the scenes extras were mildly interesting.  But on a story/quality level it totally lost me.  I can't really recommend it.",1207008000,9,1022,4.596685082872928
3324621,2,B0012IX34Y,"Tripping the Rift is a TV show originally created as a short 3d animated film named ""Love and Darph"" in 1998. The concept was picked up by the Sci-Fi channel in 2002 and aired in 2004 through 2005. It was canceled and was picked up again in 2007. It has had a total of three seasons so far. The third season was not aired in the United States.

As a television show, it tends to rely on low humor, site gags, sex jokes and potty humor.  Plots of the show often revolved around the libido of the purple blob, Chode, the show's central character. His crew, which includes a loudmouth quadruped alien, a sex-bot, a gay robot and a lizard, provide zany antics to complicate things.  The antagonist to Chode is his arch-nemesis, Bobo the clown, a goofy Darth Vader type character with a clown-head and a lisp.

Despite the low brow humor, as a show, at least for the first season, it was somewhat original and clever. It's off the wall humor that made fun of famous sci-fi films and TV along with goofy story lines created a somewhat entertaining show.  I always saw it as something of a guilty pleasure.

About the movie/dvd:

Tripping the Rift: The Movie, so far as I can tell is at least four episodes of the third season of the show shoehorned together into a movie in an attempt to sell something to US audiences. The four episodes that are sliced and diced together are ""Chode Eraser,"" ""Skankenstein,""  ""Raiders of the Lost Crock of */@?#!,"" and ""Witness Protection.""

Unfortunately, if this is what the show has become, I must say I'm rather glad it's not being inflicted on US audiences any more. I have not seen any of the episodes of the third season of the show, but I can say that based on what I've seen of the movie, it's lost all of its charm and much of its humor.

The writing has gone downhill in a major way with the plots now just random parodies on TV shows and movies with very little in the way of original humor. The jokes and gags are formulaic and clich'd.  The first season of the show was far more original, and funny, both in plot and humor.

Even more noticeable is the voicework by Jenny McCarthy, who now plays Six (replacing Gina Gershon and Carmon Electra). McCarthy is really bad in the role. Gina Gershon gave Six bite, a sexy tone and interesting character. McCarthy sounds bored and toneless. Of course, writing doesn't help any.

So far as the plot of the movie, while Tripping the Rift's brand of comedy is not something you can expect to be strong on plot, this movie hardly has one at all. The story involves a terminator-like clown chasing after Chode to kill him, but the rest of the film ends up with the characters jumping into one unrelated b-story after another. Nothing fits together and undoubtedly, this Frankenstein like mess hurts everything, since they have no relation to one another at all.

I suppose that's what you get when you cram four 30 minute episodes into a 75 minute film. It certainly was unfunny and boring. I think I laughed out loud once during the entire thing, and the laugh I made was mostly a snort.

On the DVD side, this release is fairly barebones. It includes the movie, a trailer, and a making of featurette. The featurette doesn't say much, though you get to see what some of the voice actors look like.

Bottom line:
Overall, this is one to avoid. It's an unfunny movie made up of 4 episodes of the show that don't fit together. Rent it maybe if you're a fan of the show, but be prepared to be disappointed.",1206921600,2,3483,4.444270015698587
3324622,3,B0012IX34Y,"... but if you don't like the show or find it best taken in small doses, then this movie might be a bit much for you. It certainly goes farther than the show, but do we really need to see naked computer women ogled by aliens and whatnot? I say we need the REAL Jenny McCarthy to do a TTR movie, where we get to see an actual person, um, naked. Okay, that doesn't sound very ""sane,"" but you have to be into juvenile humor (and juvenile *attempts* at humor) to enjoy Tripping the Rift: The Movie.

3324623,4,B0012IX34Y,"'Tripping the Rift' is 'Adult', comic relief from reality with some delightful new voices who were clearly having great fun with their animated characters. The story spoofs on many familiar movies and stereotypes. It took some getting used to when the film went from color to black and white in different scenes, but my eyes adjusted. I found other interesting movies in the previews that I plan to check out, such as 'Hatchet' and the horror movie 'Wrestle Maniac'. Please note that while this movie is an 'Animation', the humor is for adults only.

3324624,3,B0012IX34Y,"I have never seen the TV series, but the ads for it intrigued me. I think I would have appreciated this movie more if I had seen the series and was more involved with the characters and their development.

In addition to the movie, there is a short ""making of"" featurette, and I enjoyed that as much as I did the movie (but then, I like the behind the scenes stuff). I would have liked even more of that. The animation is pretty good, as are the production values.

It is truly funny. Not all of the humor is to my liking, but there are some great lines and situations. The subtle and not-so-subtle satire and parody is the best part, and I wish there was more of that in the blend. It is very irreverent, extremely nasty, gross at times, and mostly very silly. Think more Cheech and Chong than Firesign Theater.

It is definitely NOT for kids, unless we are talking the ten year-old in a 25 year-old body (and I know a few who would love this). It is fast paced and not very deep, but then it is a comedy. Sort of sexy, gross, drive-by comedy.

It has been likened to South Park, but I haven't ever watched that, so I can't comment on that comparison. One of the actors in the featurette describes it as Star Wars meets the porn industry. I would add in a healthy dose of The Three Stooges (now THAT dates me).

It is not something I will watch over and over again, like Firefly, but I am definitely interested in seeing the TV series now. If you like this kind of humor, it is definitely worth a look.",1206835200,,1503,4.204861111111111
