6600975,5,B00MU1YEWW,Little House on the Prairie Christmas movies were fun to watch.  I loved to watch these Christmas episodes.  Great for family to watch together.,1416355200,2,144,4.958333333333333
6600976,4,B00MU1YEWW,"Little House on the Prairie: A Merry Ingalls Christmas is made up of the television specials Christmas at Plum Creek from Season One and A Christmas They Never Forgot from Season Eight. The first episode has Charles (Michael Landon) and Mary (Melissa Sue Anderson) finding jobs in order to get gifts for the family. Laura (Melissa Gilbert) struggles with how she'll come up with money for her presents until she realizes the answer to her problems is right in front of her. Nels Oleson (Richard Bull) wants to buy Laura's horse, Bunny, for Nellie (Alison Arngrim).

The second segment sees the Ingalls family come together for the holidays during a severe blizzard. They're snowed in and end up spending the night together. Memories from Christmass past are reflected upon.

Little House on the Prairie: A Merry Ingalls Christmas is delivered as a standard DVD. The two specials are restored to their original broadcast length after years of being show in edited syndicated versions. The audio and video for each episode have been remastered as well.

Little House on the Prairie: A Merry Ingalls Christmas is the perfect family-oriented gift for that special someone this season. It will warm their hearts with wholesome drama and adventure for all ages. The collection reflects the spirit of the holidays and good values of a more innocent time.",1416355200,30,1347,5.004464285714286

6600979,5,B00MU1YEWW,"My family loves Little House on the Prairie, and with the fact that my wife's family lived in Walnut Creek near the same time that Laura Ingalls Wilder did, these shows hold another special meaning for us. These two episodes that are shared on this DVD were so much fun. Both had great stories held within and really got you in the mood for Christmas. The new release of this just before Christmas was perfect for any lover of the show or for anyone who simply can enjoy a clean, fun family show that the whole family can enjoy. Too often today the family entertainment is a bit too non-family oriented, not this series. This is a truly family centered series that I have no problem sharing with my own kids and you will find this to be true too!

6600981,5,B00MU1YEWW,"Little House on the Prairie from the moment the theme music play's a smile should appear on your face,and as you see that prairie wagon come into view during the opening credits you know that your in store to watch something really good. Little House on the Prairie is a wonderful TV series that is timeless.
This new DVD is remastered to the best picture and sound quality available for this series that is celebrating it's 40th anniversary with the release of their TV seasons in grand style with all new remastered and original uncut broadcast episodes currently Seasons (1-3) have been made available again by Lions Gate in DVD and Blu-ray sets.
I'm eagerly anticipating the release of the other seasons in this series on DVD in future.
I've collected the new remastered Lions Gate release of Little House seasons (1-3) and I'm thrilled with the picture quality it is crisp and clean.
But back to this new Christmas DVD featuring two Christmas episodes from the series
""Christmas at Plum Creek""  (An episode from Season 1)
This episode is my all time favorite episode of Little House on the Prairie in the entire series
The Ingalls are just settling in to their in new home in Walnut Grove and are low on shopping funds to buy gifts for each other,but in a house filled with love that shouldn't be a problem should it?
No because the Ingalls are one resourceful pioneer family that won't let anything stand in their way or ruin their holiday.
Each member of the Ingalls family finds unique way to make/give a christmas gift for their family members.
Having this endearing episode alone is worth the price of the DVD itself.
The second Christmas episode included is
""A Christmas they never forgot"" (An episode from Season 8)
The Ingalls are snowed in at Christmas time and share stories of Christmas's past with each other.
Over all this is a great DVD,so go ahead and buy this DVD and spend your Christmas with the Ingalls.",1413331200,92,1927,4.684365781710914
6600992,5,B00MU1YEWW,"Like many that have purchased this, I grew up with Little House on the Prairie and it pure nostalgia for me to have my own children watch it, too.

I previously owned this title on VHS, later purchasing DVD format that was lost in a house fire, and now own it as a digital title for streaming. At least it's fireproof now! I have given the DVD as gifts and they have always been received well, often becoming a viewing tradition in other families after they receive it.

Each format has been nearly identical, to my memory, despite the fact they can appear to be different versions, due to artwork, full titles (or not) and changing descriptions. A Merry Ingalls Christmas features two episodes: Christmas At Plum Creek and A Christmas They Never Forgot.

The editing remains the same, relatively simple opening and closing of chapters where commercials once were, it could be smoother but it will suffice. The sound is never spectacular on any version, not just lacking in perfectionist Dolby tweaking etc but just low and a bit shallow, much similarity to what it likely sounded like to our ears during original airings. Overall, the video and audio is clean, if not impressive to our modern standards, providing what we can call ""nostalgically authentic.""

On quality, the ease of streaming bumps this up to a 5 stars ratings, as does the ability to preserve it in a cloud, rather than find a place to store it digitally or physically. And it's fireproof!",1518220800,,1458,4.728346456692913

BUT BEWARE THE 2nd episode if you have younger children who believe in Santa Claus!!!  There were NUMEROUS instances of Charles making comments about ""taking care of the stockings"", and an entire ""flashback"" episode by an adult Almonzo where his older brother tells him there is no Santa Claus.  We were watching this with my 7 and 5 year old children, and I had to pretend the DVD scratched/broke!  I also did some coughing to drown out the heresies!!! :)  As much as I love Little House, I love my kids believing in Santa Clause more :)  I'm a bit surprised Little House would have such an episode when so many kids were among their fans.",1482969600,4,737,4.375

Because one of the Christmas episodes was touching, as usual, when Laura has to part with her most prized possession, to buy a stove for ma, for Christmas. Melissa Gilbert was so darling when she was little, and used to bring tears to my eyes. The other episode was also special, when the entire cast (including Laura's husband Almanzo, and Mary's husband Adam), are snowed in at the Ingalls cabin, Christmas Eve, telling memories of Christmases past.

6601193,5,B00MU1YEWW,"One of my fondest childhood memories is watching Little House on the Prairie every week with my family, and the Christmas episodes were among my favorites. To me, the Ingalls were the epitome of the perfect family: humble, God-fearing people with kind, generous hearts and a great sense of family. When I saw this Christmas special which consists of two episodes, I could not resist revisiting the Ingalls at Christmas, and taking a walk down memory lane, especially during this holiday season.

The first episode is my favorite. It is the Ingall's first Christmas in Walnut Creek and every member of the family wants to make it a special one for the other members of the family - trouble is, there isn't much money to spare and so the resourceful Ingalls do what they do best: use their hearts and strong work ethic to find a way to make Christmas meaningful. That last scene when the Christmas presents are being handed out always gets to me, especially seeing Ma and Pa Ingalls' expressions as they witness the love of their children. Truly a magnificent, heartwarming episode.

The second is more of a vignette episode: Adam, Mary and Hester Sue surprise the Ingalls and Wilders at the Ingalls' homestead on Christmas Eve and due to a blizzard, the clan end up staying altogether under one roof. To pass the time, they each share their special Christmas memory: Caroline's first Christmas with her mother and stepfather after her father passes away back when she was a young girl, Almanzo's experience one Christmas Eve when he was six, the Ingalls' memory of a Christmas when life was particularly hard and there was little to spare in the way of presents only to have things take a positive turn with the arrival of Mr. Edwards, and Hester Sue's reminiscences of her childhood Christmas memory.

All in all, if you are a fan of heartwarming Christmas dramas, then this is a must-watch.",1448496000,5,1891,4.776758409785932

6601273,5,B00MU1YEWW,"I never watched Little House, or read the books as a child.  My expectations of this were simple- a wholesome Christmas show my Little House book- loving seven year old would enjoy.  What I got was so much more.  I search for quality Christmas programs and we have found just a few with staying power to actually become household traditions.  we just watched the first episode together with my 4 year old daughter and all loved it.  It was just like the O. Henry story Gift of the Magi in that they all learn the true meaning of Christmas when their gifts for each other are foiled.  I am not usually one for literary references but ironically we had just read O. Henry and I had just read TS Eliot's The Cultivation of Christmas Trees, in which he contrasts our jaded adult conception of Christmas with a child for whom the angel on a tree really is an angel"".  This came back to me immediately when Carrie looks at the star at the end.  The last scene literally made me cry and I did not go in feeling particularly sentimental.  I felt it actually hit at the profound meaning of Christmas in a way I had not experienced yet this year.  This stands out among Christmas shows and it is totally worth buying these stand alone Christmas episodes.  This DVD will hopefully be a new family Christmas tradition and I heartily recommend it!",1420761600,8,1334,4.448559670781893
