8362983,5,B002C2KAFY,"I`ve watched 3 DVDs on flower-arranging. This is the best because of the reasons listed below

- The instructions are clear and easy to follow. I was able to create beautiful a bouquet of fresh flowers while watching this DVD.

- The disc is well organized. It shows how to buy fresh flowers, prepare and arrange them. The information is useful.

- When the instructor speaks of a specific flower, there is a caption on the screen. I love this feature the most because I`m a beginner. Other DVDs on the same subject miss this.

- The video color is washed out. It looks like it was transferred from video tapes. However, it does not reduce the usefulness of the information.

I highly recommend it to everybody who wants to learn the basics of flower-arranging.",1330992000,,761,4.607407407407408
