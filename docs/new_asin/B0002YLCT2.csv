2145843,4,B0002YLCT2,"The Everlasting Secret Family is a fascinating Australian film that depicts a secret homosexual society that has infiltrated in a silent, subtle way the very upper strata of Australian politics and upper class life. It is a wicked, sexy tale and I won't go into any details of the plot lest I ruin the clever surprises that make this movie very entertaining.

Suffice it to say, the acting is quite good, the direction fluent, and you'll enjoy the quirky twists in the plot. In a way, it's refreshing to see a movie where a gay underground puts the screws to a listlessly banal straight society.",1099440000,11,595,4.666666666666667

2146002,4,B0002YLCT2,"The film, The Everlasting Secret Family, is the adaptation of Frank Moorehouse's novella of the same name.

The action opens on what appears to be an intramural track and field event fundraiser for a private, exclusive Australian preparatory school. The camera follows a sleek, dark greyish Roll-Royce limousine onto the school grounds. A blonde haired youth, soon to be the focus of the viewer attention has been watching this limousine approach and its passenger as he exits the car and seeks out either the Headmaster or the Chairman of the Trustees. This passenger turns out to be the Senator, a tall, slender, distinguished, proper gentleman. The Senator makes his connection with his intended contact and soon both men are pointing in the direction of the Youth. Three men sit at a table facing out to the track and field competition--the closest to the camera at this table is the art master (learned a bit later in the action of the movie). When the school connection makes eye contact with the art master, the art master nods what will be taken as assent regarding the Youth and the transaction that has just been approved for this teen boy. This very subtle, very discrete, very discerning, yet very deceptive contract has extraordinarily sinister connotations for the Youth and the larger Australian society. What is introduced in a most sophisticated manner is the workings of an elitist secret fraternal order and its place in the management, control, and operation of the privileged elitist society.

Interestingly, this opening scene does not indicate so much the preparatory school as a brothel, but more as an genteel, protective male hareem from which confines powerful men select, handsome teen males as long-term lovers as companion-consorts. These youths are objects of desire and pleasure for the powerful men, such as the Senator, who become mentors to the Youthful lovers. This is similar to the situation of Ancient Greek culture in which the sons of the elite were temporarily housed with mentors. The mentors gave their knowledge, gifts, and love freely to their youthful ward companions until they were of majority age. This is exactly the situation involving the Youth who has become the focus of this film. There is a twist, a sinsister one, this Youth is to be seen and not heard--he does not need to have an opinion or even questions about anyting. According to the Senator, the Youth is to be young, handsome, and available when needed, as necessary, and with no questions asked. This is the second instance of the element of sinster connotations being raised. One should think of the Youth as a male courtesan.

Gradually, through this film the secret brotherhood, The Everlasting Secret Family, is discussed. These discussions are never direct or even complete. What is known of the ESF is that it is venerable, has a history, initiates/inducts members, has degrees of membership similar to the degrees of the Masons or Knights of Columbus, but is made up of MADE homosexual men. This ESF has at least one presiding officer (initially, the old Judge also a mentor to the Youth) and at least a historian and an archivist. The former is overtly placed in the film, and shown officiating at an induction ceremony, in which the inductees are attired in all white outfits (rather ironic given that the ESF operates mostly through the practice of purposeful deception and discretion, with discernment arising only as a part of purposeful manipulation of others). The latter offices are inferred from the Judge's dialogues with the Youth.

The Judge is an interesting character of this film. One would expect that the Judge as the ESF presiding officer would be zealous in maintaining the discipline of the rules that govern the ESF. Yet, he is shown as having hit a ceiling within his career as a judicial appointee. It is not stated whether the Senator withheld support from promoting the Judge further in the judiciary or that this elderly man plateaued and is somewhat bitter at the paradox of defending an organization that is amoral and illegal against his judicial oath. The Judge is very clearly drawn to the Youth. He desires the boy, but he does not push himself on the Youth because the Judge is proper in his behavior and interpretation of ESF rules. Unlike the Senator who wants only a sexual object, the Judge wants a real companion who questions and wishes to share his thoughts and desires with the Judge as well as an intimate relationship so the Judge is looking for a true, complete intimate companion consort.

This film raises a number of issues that are teased at--never fully answered. One issue is what becomes of the Youthful lovers as they age out of being handsome/beautiful boys to men? How are they provided for? Have the Youths' parents been compensated for services rendered? One of these Youths is raised by name--Peter--presumably, the present Youth's immediate predecessor as the Senator's boy-lover. It is learned that the Senator arranged for Peter to live at Honolulu, Hawaii. Eric, is another one time lover of either the Senator, or more likely, the Senator's father. His current status is the Senator's driver. He seems to be a henchman thug/driver/enforcer/watchdog meant to prevent episodes of indiscretion involving the Youthful lover. These are but a few of the more intriguing ones.

The film is meant to be disturbing. It is very clearly a study of human interactions, manipulation, power, control, even domination and humiliation as means to an end. In this regard it is masterful.

I would have liked to have seen more character development especially of the following characters: the Senator; the Youth; the Judge; the Senator's son.

Ever hear how a gay agenda exists to recruit young people and convert them into homosexuals? More insidious than the Protocols of Zion! How about the secret brunch of powerful queens that controls Hollywood? A villainy more octopussy than the Illuminati!

2146022,2,B0002YLCT2,"This film is dated in every way, and creepy beyond explanation.

It depicts a supposed culture of older, aristocratic men who can afford to ""keep"" younger men as lovers in a possessive, manipulative way.  It isn't love or attraction as much as it seems to be simple lust and convenience.

The creepy weirdness increases when some of the characters decide they are ""entitled"" to interludes with some of the boys because they have been good servants for so many years.  The mother is creepy too and does her best to manipulate the situation to her advantage, as does the main character.

So, this is an artificially artsy-feeling movie full of scheming scoundrels looking for a good time at someone else's expense.  It doesn't get better at the end.

This must have been ground-breaking for it's time, and it's interesting enough to watch through, but it's value (and it's drawbacks) is in it's age and it's (probably) accurate depiction of prevailing attitudes and stereotypes of several decades ago.

2146024,4,B0002YLCT2,"""The Everlasting Secret Family"" is a tale of gay relationship management set in south-east Australia in the late 1980s. The set-up involves a senator (played by Arthur Dignam), aided by a widespread network, who has arranged to take on a high school Youth lover (played by Mark Lee).  The Youth adapts, but needs to navigate challenges as the senator's life evolves.

The direction and pacing are excellent.  There are many twists, all with a counterpoint of fears and regrets expressed in side story lines.  There are several successful sets involving parties and public meals.  The ending is delightfully wicked.

The two main eye-candy characters, the Youth and one other, both supply good skin shots.

The major cheat of the movie is that these two attractive characters seem to be played by actors in their late twenties, rather than in their early and middle teens as the written script would suggest.  (Of course, ""Hamlet"" won an Oscar with Olivier at 40.)  Reimagining the movie with age-accurate actors gives it a different feel.

The DVD has some cheating too.  Other than five chapter stops there are no extras.  Although there are two pictures on the DVD cover of a shirtless Youth chained up, they don't appear on the DVD.

This is an enjoyable fantasy.",1100304000,32,1266,4.915094339622642

But let me say that the actors are talented, attractive, and sexy and the story is exciting and provocative.  Gay or not, you will really like it, if you have a pulse.  If you're gay, even just a little bit, you may find it enthralling.  Now that it's available at last in DVD, one of the top items in my life's important agenda is now satisfied.

You can only see it the first time once, so in that way it's like losing your virginity: it's out of this world wonderful, and you'll never forget it!",1100044800,28,932,4.383720930232558

8034895,1,B0002YLCT2,"Not my kind of gay movie, as soon as I saw the lead making out with old guy, I had enough.",1516492800,,90,3.3333333333333335
8034896,3,B0002YLCT2,"A fiction movie about something that really exists and not that unusual. Most of the time the boy is underage.
They could not show this in the film of course.
There are men who have young ""nephews"". Or so they say to friends.
This film is quite old and I wish they would do a modern version.",1503273600,,291,4.12280701754386

8034898,3,B0002YLCT2,could have made more of this,1497052800,,28,3.8333333333333335
8034899,4,B0002YLCT2,"A well done, well written, and acted film about the seedy sexual exploits of political elites. I kept thinking that this film was like a behind the scenes, gay version, of Stanley Kubrick's Eyes Wide Shut. Given the myriad tales and news exposes about the sordid and sometimes shocking sexual exploits of political and financial elites this film does a really good job showing what it can be like for those who are the exploited; albeit this film has a wonderful twist in which the exploited becomes the savvy exploiter!",1494115200,,520,4.788888888888889
8034900,2,B0002YLCT2,"Teenagers played by 20 somethings. Very little nudity, no frontal nudity at all, and the sex is all implied. The movie is of high quality but the acting is as slow and  guarded as the plot. This is actually a true-ish story that's very deep but handled in a rather shallow manner here. You would be better off looking up the book it is based on.",1493337600,,345,4.2272727272727275
8034901,1,B0002YLCT2,Interesting concept bad acting.  Should be remade to current day,1483228800,,64,5.4
