8706302,4,B00UGQ5NG4,"I had this before but it became lost. It came sooner than was told,excellent.
 I have a problem with it about #20,it stops and won't even skip ahead. So,
I have to begin again and start it past the spot. All is well after that.
And so,I will rate it a #4....Nothing rates a #5",1530662400,,276,4.0181818181818185
