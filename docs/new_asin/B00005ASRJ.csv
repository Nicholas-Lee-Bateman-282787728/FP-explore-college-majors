7935686,5,B00005ASRJ,"As amazing as Frankie Gavin's studio recordings are, nothing matches seeing/hearing him in live performance.  His rapport with the audience and his fellow musicians is sheer delight to watch.  His joy and energy onstage are a fine match for his brilliant musicianship.  I particularly enjoyed his exquisite rendition of Mona Lisa,  and the location segments from Connemara were beautiful.  But it was his set with the great Stephane Grappelli that brought a lump to my throat.  The respect and friendship between these two titans comes across very clearly, and their renditions of Kerry Dances and Sweet Georgia Brown are irresistible.  I loved every second of it.",1104883200,,664,5.2075471698113205
