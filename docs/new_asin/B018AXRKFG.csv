7543930,1,B018AXRKFG,Spoiler alert..............They basically copy fight club. You follow some guy around who thinks he's going to rescue his wife. He's constantly plagued by his nemesis. Turns out hes a lunatic with split personalities. He's not rescuing his wife he's stalking someone else's. At the end he catches up to her murders her and her entire family and the credits roll. Honestly the worst part of the movie is the nonsense gun battles. At the end the villain is standing in an open area surrounded by gunmen. Two on a roof above him about four on the ground level all within about 50 feet and as he stands still slowly firing every single one of them miss their shots. I mean you're talking shots that a 6 year old who'd never fired a gun could make. Mean while I'm supposed to accept that a large group of individuals that hunt every single day for a living on the prairie all collectively can't hit a target standing still that's a few feet away lol it's all poorly done.,1523318400,,966,4.494318181818182

The film unfolds in an almost Alice In Wonderland fashion, with the snow dusted trail of revenge populated by odd, ill fated, characters.

This film meets the ""all veterans are mentally unstable"" government-driven agenda, so I guess that's how it got funded. Oh, it also implies that all Confederate soldiers were evil, so I guess it meets that one too. It certainly wasn't released because of talent or the ability to make money.

7543963,3,B018AXRKFG,"SPOILER ALERT!  This movie is part of Amazon free Prime for prime members.
IMHO:
I will discuss the incoherent plot so maybe someone can explain it to me.
The Acting was all good; I saw no lack of acting ability by Scott Eastwood.  The story had a drastic twist in it, which was excellent, highly original IMHO.  The main character is a civil war veteran named Jackson who is tormented by the death of his brother in that war, apparently thinking he Jackson is guilty of his death.  Maybe he shot him by accident?

At the start the audience thinks that Jackson's wife has been kidnapped & thus Jackson set out to free her.  But we find out eventually that this man (Eastwood) ""Jackson"" was the kidnapper, and those whom Jackson is chasing are the family of the woman who came to rescue her from him.  The story starts very well with an exciting scene of Jackson's house being burned down & her family riding off with her, tho we assume they are kidnappers. So the story has brilliancy, but its telling is incoherent to me.

2 incoherencies: The first problem is with the Coggins character whom someone calls Ezra; yet I hear Benjamin (the black man) call him Jefferson. Coggins is a psychopathic murderer.  It seems obvious when Coggins has Benjamin on his knees to murder him that Coggins is an alter ego of Jackson (Eastwood). Jackson has something like multiple personality disorder though the producer does not merely dress Jackson differently, but has another actor play that role.  When Benjamin is on his knees & Coggins has a gun at him to murder him, Benjamin addresses him first as Jefferson, then changes it to Jackson.  Soon the camera shot changes, & we now see Jackson with that gun pointed at Benjamin, & Coggins is nowhere to be seen.  This is great drama.  However, it is incoherent because earlier in the story when a Chinaman had a gun on Jackson, Coggins came up behind the Chinaman & shot him in the back, which requires more than multiple personality - it implies that Coggins is not Jackson, but a different man.  So to enjoy this story I have to mentally re-write this earlier scene so that Jackson doesn't have to be 2 different men at the same time in different places, doing different things.

The 2nd incoherence is the ending.  Eastman/Jackson, determined to get his previously kidnapped woman back, approaches a ranch where there are maybe 10 men with guns/rifles posted at various places, like roof top.  Yet Jackson with his pistol shoots them all dead, like Clint Eastwood would do. The difference is that Eastwood is sposed to be a sympathetic character & the guys shot are bad guys.  But the lack-of-believability in the shooting prowess is the same in both cases. (Terence Hill reduces this genre to the absurd.)  However, this is standard Western movie entertaining nonsense, when the killer is the sympathetic protagonist.

But after getting past all but one of the ranch men protecting the girl from Jackson (only her husband Guillermo is alive), Jackson enters the room where the girl is and locks the double doors, which should be easy to break thru, but Guillermo isn't up to it. (Director wasn't up to making it look like a strong door?)  Inside the room the girl pretends to want to smooch Jackson, but while smooching, she pulls his gun out of his holster & shoots him with his own gun in the gut (which in those days meant certain death).  However, he does not fall.  And the gun is out of bullets.  Jackson leaves the room with his 2nd revolver to find Guillermo in the adjoining room with his revolver drawn.  But Guillermo who had yelled ""If you touch her, I will kill you,"" hasn't the nerve to pull the trigger.  So Jackson & Guillermo face off both with guns drawn, until for the final scene of the show, Jackson finally shoots bang & the show abruptly ends.  We see him shoot, but do not see that he hit anyone.  Then with the credit screen(s) coming on, we hear a 2nd shot bang, but don't get to see who shot it or if anyone got hit.  So the ending is left hanging, except we should know that Jackson will eventually die with that gut shot (no antibiotics in those days).  Thus the ending is incoherent & to me annoying.  I guess that the director intends for us to think that Guillermo was killed, maybe also the girl.  But we can mentally construct that Jackson didn't kill anyone at that point.

So I would give it 5 stars if they made the alter-ego coherent and had a coherent ending & showed Jackson die.  Now maybe someone can explain it to me & show me how it is coherent?",1515283200,,4532,4.5474722564734895

The biggest problem here is the writing or lack thereof - makes this one big piece of trash.  The director has basic skills but nit much. he doe snot know what lens to use to convey POV of the character or to convey visual storytelling.

The lighting for the film was terrible, unnatural, overly lit.
The best part of the film was seeing Danny Glover masterfully take bad dialogue and breathe some life and drama into it.
Lesson - pretty faces don't make a good film.  Good writing and good direction makes a good film.  Geez
Well lesson learned . If it make anyone feel better I gave the new Magnificent  Seven film a deservedly bad review as well. Supposedly Antoine Fuqua directed it - but that film was trash as well .

Both films a waste of time. Just watch a Sergio Leone. Better yet the director would do well to study Sergio Leone films .

7543974,4,B018AXRKFG,"DIABLO was really much better than I expected. With a less distracting sound track and better editing, it might have even been one of the better Westerns to come along over the past few years. The movie has a good story-line with a pretty cool twist and Eastman holds up his end with decent acting, although it really is a little spooky how much he resembles his dad at times (with his delivery of certain lines and his genetically inherited Man-With-No-Name telltale beady-eyed squint). But you can't hold that against him. He's his daddy's son and there's something comforting in knowing certain iconic aspects have been passed down from the master to another generation.

Back to the nuts and bolts...

The editing really did leave a lot to be desired. What purpose is achieved in forcing viewers to watch the entire drawn-out process of a horse being tied to a tree or bush? We could have been saved those boring bits by a simple cut-away after the character began the motion of tying his horse. I mean, it doesn't take a doctorate in Rocket-Science to figure out what comes next. Anyone who has ever watched a Western knows the drill. I only point out the multiple horse-tying bits because they are indicative of the movie's editing in general. With a little more urgency in the editing, people wouldn't be complaining about ""slow"" parts in other reviews and giving the movie only one or two stars (which is much, much too harsh).

All things considered though, if you're a fan of Westerns, DIABLO is well worth a watch, even with its faults. I gave it 4 stars for its terrific cinematic beauty, unusual plot line and decent acting. You could do a lot worse if you're looking for an hour and a half of entertainment.

The action wasn't there... the story line sucked... they wasted most of their time on showing landscapes and nonsense... not believable at all...

7543987,4,B018AXRKFG,"I was interested to watch this even though I noted the very poor reviews. I thought the acting was pretty good across the board, and overall the story was interesting. There were a couple of scenes that felt too contrived, but nothing that deserves the 1-star reviews. Personally, as a fan of Clint Eastwood's westerns, I would love to see Scott Eastwood in more movies. I thought he did a fine job in this.

But about mid-way through the movie, when I realized what the twist was going to be, I began to understand all the poor reviews. If you are a fan of original Westerns and you want a movie that fits well in the genre of the Western movies of John Wayne and Clint Eastwood, this movie is going to disappoint you. It doesn't hit the right tropes.

But if you're open to a Western that doesn't fit well within the traditional genre and you can get past a couple of poor scenes, this is a pretty good movie. It's an interesting story, the cinematography is beautiful, and Eastwood is carrying a couple of Schofield (S&W Model 3s designed to be used by the US cavalry) revolvers.

From a historical accuracy perspective, the Schofields were not in production until 1875 and I believe the movie is set in 1872. Model 3s were in production prior to that, but some of the features of the guns carried by Eastwood in this movie (including the cartridge ejection feature) make me think these were intended to be Schofields. Also, the references to Eastwood's character having served under Sherman during the War of Yankee Aggression and being called ""Diablo"" seems far-fetched to me. Sherman's activities were in Tennessee, Mississippi, Georgia, South Carolina, and North Carolina. Maybe ... *maybe* ... his fellow Union soldiers from places like Illinois and Indiana and Ohio would have called him ""Diablo,"" but it seems a stretch.

Anyway, it's Hollywood, not history class, and I enjoyed watching it.",1506556800,,1901,4.751515151515152

Now that i think about it, the reason for the negative reviews is probably because this does not turn out to be the traditional happy ending western movie and some people do not like that.

7544022,1,B018AXRKFG,"If I had to guess, Id say that the only reason that the movie Diablo got made was the availability of Scott Eastwood as the leading man. Hes inherited his father Clints looks, and, from a distance, even suggests his mannerisms. Writer-director Lawrence Roeck tries to capitalize on young Eastwoods presence in Diablo by incorporating bits and pieces from Unforgiven, The Outlaw Josey Wales, and, especially, Pale Rider. But Scott doesnt have his fathers acting ability, at least not yet, or his commanding screen presence, and the confusing and at times downright unintentionally ridiculous Diablo is a pale imitation of those other films.

Diablo is set in 1872, and Eastwood plays a former Civil War soldier trying to settle down in Colorado as a farmer. In the opening scene, a group of Mexican bandits kidnap his wife and burn his house down. Eastwood takes off after them to rescue her and eventually locates his wife, but by that time the audience realizes that theres considerably more to the kidnapping than first meets the eye. I would say that the ending is a surprise except that the movies title and a pre-credits quote provide a big clue, and director Roeck pretty much gives things away by the halfway point.

Despite the movies rather low budget, the cast includes some familiar and quite talented names, including Danny Glover, Walton Goggins, Joaquim de Almeida, and Adam Beach. Most of them show up for an unmemorable scene or two, with the exception of Goggins, who appears a few times as a mysterious stranger dogging Eastwoods path. Goggins is one of those rare actors who could make reading a telephone book sound entertaining, and he pretty much singlehandedly rescues his five minutes of screen time.

Unfortunately, Goggins is not present for the remaining 80 minutes of the movie that plays far longer than its actual running time. Instead, Eastwood slogs his way towards an action finale that has to rank as one of the silliest showdowns in Western history. Along the way, he displays emotion, including shedding a single glycerine tear in a shot that is unintentionally amusing. Meanwhile, Eastwoods various co-stars seem distracted and anxious to get their scenes over with, while the actual shootouts in the movie are rather lethargically staged. The only remotely saving grace other than Goggins performance is the at times stunning overhead photography by Dean Cundey, clearly the most competent person in the entire crew. Cundeys career has hit the skids lately working on some less-than-stellar projects like Diablo, but there are a few shots of the spectacular Canadian scenery that are actually breathtaking.

Most people, however, don't watch a Western movie with a recognizable name in the lead role just to see a few scenery shots or a character actor ham up a few scenes. Unfortunately, those few brief moments are the only mildly entertaining ones in the movie. The rest is an attempt at mysticism, perhaps the supernatural, but the attempt fails, because writer/director Roeck and Scott Eastwood are not up to the task. Give them some credit for trying something different in making Diablo, but the results are devilishly mediocre.",1496793600,,3173,5.049618320610687

This is an underrated gem of a film. I do not understand the poor reviews of this film.

The action is fantastic and Scott provides a far better performance in the final act of the film, but Walton Goggins steals the show.

Something I feel I can talk about --  It showed a side of the Civil War seldom seen. The Post Traumatic Stress coming out of the Civil War must have been greater then any war in this Country's history. The producer tried to bring it out without any earlier lead up. Even with the roughness of his manner, the PTSD was shown very well.
It's a shame that from so many realy low scores, that an awful large amount of viewers just didn't get it. I'm 67 and grew up on Westerns and this one was great. The scenery and the portrayal of the background actors couldn't have been any better. Eastwood played and showed his mental disorder with fantastic realism.

Most of the film is shot in Calgary, Alberta in the Rockies, so there is a lot of gorgeous cinematography, a key asset to this film. Scott Eastwood looks a lot like Clint did when he starred in the famous Spaghetti western trilogy, A Fistful Of Dollars, For A Few Dollars More and The Good, The Bad And The Ugly, with a short trimmed beard and moustache, with similar mannerisms and even a grim yet soft voice.

This film also reminded me of another recent western, Traded, because of its search and violence. And also starring in this movie is Walton ( Walter) Goggins  , best known for his role in the crime series Justified. Waltons character is a bit ambiguous, it seems as if he is the alter ego of Scotts character, because of some of the plot twists that take place. And Scotts character is much more brutal than Clint ever was in all of his movies,

There are very few western movies being produced these days, so I did find that this one gave me the nostalgic feeling that I was watching a movie from the eighties. It seems like newer westerns nowadays are much more violent in the graphics than they were in the past, but overall I did enjoy it and would recommend it , but only to fans of the original Clint Eastwood.",1489104000,,1554,4.385416666666667

First, I'm 60, and a history buff. I hate to be blunt, but I think people, especially the younger viewers, have either have had no American history or little explanation of the Civil War. I have a number of Civil War books, written from many vantage points. This movie shows what advanced PTSD is and the lingering effects. Any War has this, and I'm not going to go into explanations. It shows the horror, the affect on the human psychic. Men came out of the war killing machines.
It leaves you thinking. I'm sorry that this is not a PC review. You can't sugar  coat life and history.

All rolled into one is the devil white man who kills an Asian man, a whole group of Mexicans, a Black man and several American Indians. The only one missing on the PC identity politics totem pole was a Muslim man but that would have put this propaganda over the top and even some of the more densely programmed might have caught on to how far fetched this mass murdering white man story was. Meanwhile, in reality, I live next to a graveyard in Maine that has plenty of young dead civil war soldiers who came from poor farming families, never saw a black man, never had slaves, but gave their lives fighting in a bloody war that left 600,000 dead. They were God fearing white men who left their farms in the most Northeastern state to die on a southern battlefield or even worse, suffer a weeks to month long excruciating dying - some as young or younger than 19 like young John Ramsdell who died at Hilton Head. So sick of these false narratives propagated by Hollywood when there are so many untold stories of young white men laying down  their lives to free men they had never met. There was quite an abolitionist movement in New England including Maine. These stories need to be told, not fictional stories that foment hate against white men making white men out to be devils.

7544201,1,B018AXRKFG,"Sadly, the music, scenery and cinematography were so rudely interrupted by actors and a wretchedly horrible story.  This movie is really that bad.  Being a huge Clint Eastwood and Western genre fan, this simply does not work.  The twists are warped, the acting is weak and the characters are ridiculous.  The story just falls apart and turns into a nonsensical, disconnected plot dump about 3/4 of the way.

SPOILER ALERT:  This is essentially about a nut-case cowboy who turns into a psychopathic serial kidnapper/murderer and you're rooting for him...it's just horrendous.

Not worth the time.  Truthfully, if you absolutely must waste 2+ hours of your life watching Scott Eastwood play a cowboy, watch the trailer a 60-70 times!",1486166400,,731,5.135593220338983

7544203,5,B018AXRKFG,Terribly unexpected.  I do think the make up department should get an Oscar for making Boyd Crowders teeth so yellow(Justified fans will get it).  Stellar performance by Scott Eastwood.  He looks a lot like his dad in this movie but this is not a character his dad would have ever played.  The way he just unfolds at the end is epic.  I can see how people wouldn't like this movie.  But those people are a little thing I like to call unintelligent.  This is not a classic western.  I don't want to say anything else to spoil the film.  So just watch it and expect the unexpected.,1486166400,,579,4.336448598130841

It is slow, boring, and has a ridiculous ending. The main character is void of any personality or any trait that would compel you to like him or empathize for him. If you watch this movie, you will watch the last 10 minutes and scream to yourself, ""Why? Why? Why did I watch this movie? I can never get the past hour and a half back!!""

Then Jackson, (main character) is shot by a women that throughout the movie is fleeing from Jackson. Then a  door opens the women's brothers is waiting to finish off the guy that just killed all the adult males in the family only to be told not to shoot him by the kidnapped, rapped girl because he is the father of her children.

Very disjointed plot, takes the movie some time before you realize the main character has dual personalities, of course one good and one evil.  Reminded me somewhat of ""No Country for Old Men"", everyone seems to die in the movie.  There is zero rational for how the personalities get triggered.  At one point, after getting shot, an Indian boy rescues him.  After recovering they realize he is crazy and kick him out and then out of nowhere they give him a horse and his weapons back?  Whoever wrote the script was on something.  Very little was done to flesh out the reasons for the mental issues.  The movie leaves a definite bad taste in the mouth.",1485388800,,716,4.53125

The story is intriguing and only falls into place after you've watched the movie and had time to put the pieces together.  If I could have changed one thing it would have been the score.

I began to suspect what I discovered to be right during the very beginning of the film but I still liked the film. I liked the way the truth about the Scott character came out very slowly.
It is 1872, seven years after the end of the Civil War. The film opens with us seeing several Mexicans riding off with Scott's wife, and him shooting at the men and wounding one. He collapses and is helped by neighbors who say they know little about him. He explains that Mexicans kidnapped his wife. They say they are sorry and want to help even though they never met his new wife. They give him bullets.
He has a run-in with an obviously crazy killer during his pursuit and also with Indians who help him after he is shot. But the Indians do not want him around. Although he helped an Indian boy and seems to be very nice, and the boy likes him, they say he crazy.
The film has an ending that will surprise many viewers.",1484524800,,1009,4.17948717948718

He acquits himself well and it's a bit astonishing at times how much he looks like a younger Clint. The cinematography is beautiful and the openness of the landscape is captured well which is always a big part of any western. It's a bit short on action which would be fine if the story was a bit more fleshed out. Movies with ""reveals"" need a special script to keep them interesting until that moment arrives. This one will leave you with many questions until near the end and the payoff was not quite enough to pull the rest together.

For example he is in the care of American natives for a period of time, but the people who are suppose to have kidnapped his wife do not travel much more than just a days ride ahead.

The final third of the movie begins to draw all characters and events together in surprising ways, with some really unexpected and interesting plot twists -- but you have to have the patience to get there.  The first 2/3's of the movie is just one genuinely head-scratching, disjointed, seemingly random scene after another that leaves you wondering ""What the hell happened?""  I stuck with it only because the title character is Clint Eastwood's son and because of a brief appearance by veteran movie great Danny Glover.  Scott Eastwood isn't nearly the caliber of actor as his old man, but if you look at Clint Eastwood's early career (1960s), he wasn't much of an actor at that time either.  Clint Eastwood didn't really become the celebrated Clint Eastwood until a series of breakthrough roles in the 1970s and 1980s -- mostly roles in which he played the stock Clint Eastwood.  Scott very obviously isn't there yet.  I doubt he ever will be.  Still, because of the intriguing final third of the movie storyline, I was inclined to rate it 2-3 stars -- until the totally hokey, too obviously contrived, and disbelievable ending.  In fact, the movie didn't really have an ending.  It just stopped.  Leaving the audience to once again wonder, ""What the hell happened?""  Nearly two wasted hours of my life I'll never get back.

First of all, because at some point early in the movie you have flash backs of
spaghetti westerns, since Scott Eastwood is at times a spitting image of his father.
And then there is the plot, which starts one way, it gets darker and darker, and then
it goes the way it goes.
So it is kind of a modern western that wants to attract younger people, thus it has
its ""thriller"" moments.
It is not that fun to watch because it is really slow, but I think that it has great photography
and nice attention to detail.

7544673,2,B018AXRKFG,"Grim, not very entertaining western about a man whose wife is abducted by Mexicans so he rides off to rescue her.  The fact that we never see the actual abduction--the movie opens with Scott Eastwood standing in front of his burning house, firing at people who are shooting at him--might clue an astute viewer into the possibility that things aren't quite what they seem.  Unfortunately, even with a fairly shocking third act twist Diablo is a drag to sit through and will only likely please very strong fans of the genre who are happy with any new western that comes their way.

There are people who think Scott Eastwood has the makings of a star.  Can he go where Jim Mitchum, Patrick Wayne and his sister Alison Eastwood failed to?  Maybe, but based on Diablo the verdict is mixed at best.  He seems to be only an average actor at this point.  He has the looks to be a movie star, but so do half the men in Hollywood where pretty faces are a dime a dozen.  Would he be a lead in this film without his famous last name?  Probably not.  One thing I can say for sure about Scott Eastwood is that he can't hold the screen with veteran character actor Walton Goggins, who turns up multiple times as a sinister and sadistic man who gets great pleasure from killing and who we think may be the Diablo of the title.  Goggins simply holds the screen in a way that the handsome but bland Eastwood can't--at least not yet.  But his father isn't the greatest actor in Hollywood either--for my money Burt Reynolds and Charles Bronson both had more range--but also a hell of a lot less smarts when it came to choosing projects.  If Scott Eastwood gets the right film or catches the eye of the right director it's certainly possible he could become a star.  But that hasn't happened yet and based on Diablo it's not entirely clear what he possesses beyond a famous last name that sets him apart from all the other handsome young actors looking for their big break.

Diablo is a slow and dreary western that pales quality-wise even alongside the undistinguished likes of Forsaken (the recent Keifer and Donald Sutherland father/son western) and the Kurt Russell cannibal western Bone Tomahawk.  Those two movies were both seriously flawed but are still far superior to Diablo.  Scott Eastwood clearly doesn't possess the screen presence necessary to carry a weak project like Diablo, but the movie's failure can't be laid entirely at his feet either.  The filmmaking is competent but uninspired; none of the shootouts are exciting; none of the characters or situations is well developed--everything about Diablo feels by-the-numbers uninspired like everyone involved knew this was just a job and that the movie wasn't going to turn out all that well.  Diablo lacks style or energy or excitement and just kind of limps along like a lazy star vehicle for someone who isn't yet a star.",1463961600,,2869,4.667992047713717

7544698,3,B018AXRKFG,"This is an entirely conventional Western staring Scott Eastwood, yes the offspring of the other Eastwood.  In the set up, the wife of a Civil War vet (Eastwood) gets kidnapped from their place by four Mexicans.  They shoot and set fire to his ranch buildings.  He sets out after them, alone.  What follows is a kind of Ulysses style tale.  He encounters a series of human obstacles along the way.  Some of the encounters seem quite forced and false, which takes points away.
  But Scott Eastwood is really good.  This is his first Western and it is a great place to start his career as an action star.  He does have the goods to carry this film almost by himself.  Lots of the film are of him not even speaking, and that is hard to pull off and still keep the attention of the audience.  He has very serious backing, which also helps.  Walton Goggins has a large role.  Adam Beach, Joaquim de Almeida and Danny Glover have smaller roles but we enjoy seeing them, even if briefly.  Camilla Belle plays the kidnapped wife.  You will remember her as a child actress in Jurassic Part II.
  Director, writer and producer Lawrence Roeck has only one other directorial credit, The Forger with the immortal Louren Bacall.  Some of his cinematography comes up to the quality of genuine art.  The writing, not so much-which prevents a higher rating.
  There is a twist which absolutely makes the film.  When you put in a twist, put in a jaw dropping twist.  And writer Roeck does exactly that.  Good for him.
  This R rated film runs for one hour and 30 minutes.  Some people like this more than I did, although I liked it every bit as much as I could.  This 2015 film took Best Feature Film at the San Diego Film Festival.",1461110400,,1713,4.453074433656958

When his home is attacked, set on fire, his wife 'Alexsandra' (Camilla Belle) kidnapped by Mexican
-Bandits, 'Jackson' has one course of action to take - pursue, and rescue his young wife.
On the trail he will meet those that would obstruct his quest, and being told that his wife does not
appear distressed in the company of her abductors doesn't help, it makes no sense to him.
One face that keeps turning up on the journey 'Ezra' (Walton Coggins) a killer, but, who is this person,
why, when given the opportunity does he not kill 'Jackson' ?
'Jackson' will continue his pursuit that will lead to an ultimate shoot-out, but, will he get the outcome
he seeks ?
Also among the cast 'Danny Glover' who plays a fellow war-veteran 'Benjamin' who 'Jackson' seeks help
from during the quest.
'Jackson's' worst enemy is indeed himself, the war has made killing a part of his life he has been unable
to let go.
The film in truth is a little slow, though there are several action-sequences along the way, the film does
have a twist in the tail.
Though watching 'Scott' does at times give glimpses of his father 'Clint Eastwood' ...he does not have the
screen presence 'Clint' has. ('Clint' is among the greats in terms of screen-presence)

7544713,2,B018AXRKFG,"Released in 2015, ""Diablo"" stars Clint Eastwood's son, Scott Eastwood, as a desperate man chasing a group of Mexicans who burned down his home and took his woman.

The filmmaking is great, including the cinematography and score. On top of this Scott is definitely reminiscent of his great father; it remains to be seen if he can build on the solid foundation, but this Western isn't a good start. Why? The story is dull from the get-go and only becomes mildly compelling in the second half. Not to mention there's zero character development, more like character devolvement, if you know what I mean. Worse, the movie's overbearingly downbeat, and not in a good way, as with great films like ""Midnight Express"" (1978), ""Runaway Train"" (1986) or ""Apocalypse Now"" (1979). Then there's some mysterious killer who just seems to pop out of nowhere every twelve minutes. The reason for this is explained in the third act, but you'll suspect it beforehand.

Then, there's the roll-your-eyes shoot out at the end where all the ""bad guys"" (or are they?) become hopeless sitting ducks. Can't ONE of these tough Westerners shoot a guy who's standing out in the open a mere hundred feet away? Can't they hide behind something in safety while they kill the dude? Or how about NOT running in the open as easy prey? Could they really be this stoo-pid and incompetent? For more commentary, see ""Spoiler Alert"" below.

The movie runs 82 minutes and was shot in Alberta, Canada.

GRADE: D+

***SPOILER ALERT*** (Don't read further if you haven't seen the movie)

""Diablo"" is one of those bait-and-switch movies, like 2009's ""A Perfect Getaway,"" where you're led to believe that the main character is the hero-protagonist, but the final act reveals that he (or she) is actually a monstrous criminal. It's a twist that makes you feel like a dumb axx for caring about the protagonist earlier. Pull-the-rug-out-from-under-you movies can be good, even great, but I have a distaste for this kind, where the protagonist is revealed to be a total scumbag.

The third act confirms that Jackson (Eastwood) suffers from schizophrenia/dissociative identity disorder and while killing the man played by Danny Glover his identities merge and he goes on a rampage.

So Jackson is the bad guy of the story, which explains his nickname and the title of the movie, Diablo, which is Spanish for ""devil."" He was never actually married to Alexsandra (Camilla Belle). The Mexican posse didn't kidnap her, but rather rescued her and were bringing her back home. Jackson obviously kidnapped her sometime before the start of the movie.

Jackson is certainly a human devil: He shoots up a hamlet of innocents and then murders Alexsandra and her husband when he sees that he can't have her.",1460851200,,2744,4.922077922077922

Of course, in this movie Indians play a part of the story, not the entire tale so this isn't why I hate it.

I hate it because it wasn't cool and entertaining like Kill Bill, Django Unchained, nor did it have the quality of The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly.

I watched it primarily because Clint Eastwood's son is the main character of this film, and it's a Western. Honestly, who wouldn't watch that just out of curiosity? While I found the story weak and slow at times I found Eastwood's performance quite interesting and without giving away anything about the movie there is a twist that had my husband and I both looking at each other saying ""I didn't see that coming!"". Naturally, one can't help but draw comparisons between the younger Eastwood and his father, there are times you'd swear you were watching Clint at certain angles, he has many of the same mannerisms of his father, same stare etc...but he still stands on his own and this movie definitely had that old ""Spaghetti Western"" feel to it as well. I'm glad I went ahead and watched it and will be looking for more from this actor in the future, I just wish the story hadn't been so slow.",1454889600,,966,4.463276836158192

Scott Eastwood, at first, you kind of want to slap him, but then as it becomes revealed why he is how he is in this film, you realize that he actually did a great job with the role.

7544942,4,B018AXRKFG,"Note comment***This one is real close to five stars. Two reasons: 1) the story itself is a really good one. The plot twists towards the end and as plot twists go, this one is a doozey! Caught me totally off guard. 2) I was always a big Clint Eastwood fan, so I see this young man ( Scott Eastwood ) performing this role as a troubled civil war vet, I kept thinking to myself: that guy looks so familiar! Half way through the movie, it hit me. That guy, (young Eastwood) that I'd never seen in action before, looks just like Clint Eastwood!! The facial expressions, the steely eyed gaze, the soft but menacing voice. It's Clint made over. Before looking at the credits at the end, I already knew exactly who this young man was! I loved it. The only reason I didn't go ahead and give this surprisingly good vid five stars is because it was not on the same level as some of the big blockbusters. As a matter of fact, I'd never even heard of it before running across it while looking for something to watch. But it was a very enjoyable vid. Worth the rent. I look forward to watching more of Scott's work.",1453507200,28,1101,4.2727272727272725

Jackson (Eastwood) is a Civil War vet who is trying to put his past behind him. When he comes back to find his wife missing he sets out to get her back. This is a pretty good western with a few neat and original ideas but just never really lives up to its potential. There is so much that could have been done with this movie but it seemed to hold back to the point of becoming irritating. Eastwood is good in this but the movie seemed to rely on the fact that this is a western starring Clint Eastwoods son rather then trying to succeed on its own merit. All that said, it's not terrible and one of the better westerns to come out lately, but based on the last dozen or so in the genre that's not really saying a lot. Overall, a movie that had so much potential but left too much on the table to be as interesting as it could have been. I give it a B-.",1453420800,2,955,3.9791666666666665

I rented this, but I may go back and add it to my collection. It really is hard to find an original concept these days, let alone a good western movie post 1970s. I highly recommend giving this a chance. Watch it! Also, I thought the way they ended the movie was really cool. I hope we see more western style movies from Scott Eastwood.

7544973,4,B018AXRKFG,"Jackson (Scott Eastwood) was the top killer for General Sherman in the Civil War. His wife Alexandra (Camilla Belle) was abducted by three Spanish speaking men out in the wilds of Colorado 1872. Jackson tracks them south when he meets a dark stranger (Walton Goggins) who enacts a toll to travel his road, wanting all that Jackson has, including, maybe his soul. Jackson manages to get away, going down the road of purgatory in what appears to be some existential film.

The film was interesting even if Scott Eastwood isn't. This was another limited lines, not needing to act production for Scott. 54 minutes into the film, the identity of the dark stranger is revealed. The mystery aspect of the film kept me entertained, but clearly won't be on my re-watch list.

7544994,4,B018AXRKFG,"Diablo (2015) starts Scott Eastwood and recently very popular western genre actor Walton Goggins, probably do to his southern accent (check him out in Tarantino's Hateful Eight).  Scott looks very much like his father, but he does not match his father's talent.  That is why I rated Diablo minus one star.  Other than that, the film is really good, especially the story-line and cinematography.  The shots filmed from above and the landscape during different seasons are spectacular.  The film borderlines on the genres of mystery and psychological-western.

 SPOILER ALERT -----  The young Eastwood plays a guy by the name of Jackson. The film opens up in Colorado, seven years after the Civil War, with Jackson's ""wife"" being taken by a group of Mexicans who are riding down south.  Jackson pursues them in order to recapture his wife...along the way the viewer learns who Jackson really is.  The film reminded me at the beginning of the classic John Way film, The Searchers (1956) and of a Play Station 3 game Red Dead Redemption (2010).  The film ends unexpectedly just like it begins.  Most importantly-- the main protagonist, Jackson, is really an antagonist or anti-hero, who possesses characteristics of a supernatural figure of a devil, hence the title ""Diablo"" (Spanish for devil). I also think that Jackson might have suffered from split personality disorder.  Too bad the story does not incorporate more information from his past as a soldier in the Union Army. In addition to an interesting and original story, the film features a note worthy soundtrack by a group called Spindrift.  Check it out !",1452902400,2,1611,5.030188679245283

The only thing i didn't like about this movie was when the Indians & the Mexicans spoke their native language I didn't know what they were saying, I think subtext for the foreign language spoken would've been good.
