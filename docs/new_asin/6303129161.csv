567870,4,6303129161,"For years I have been hoping for some of these B thrillers to be released on DVD. This film can be bought on its own or as part of a 5 discs set exclusive to Universal with limited distribution. While some younger viewers may not really get excited over such films, old Universal Horror fans will certainly remember Lionel Atwill starring in a string of these atmospheric thrillers.

'House of Horrors' is actually one of my favorites of these B thrillers. It features Rondo Hatton as ""The Creeper"" who had played the character in one of Basil Rathbone's Sherlock Holmes adventures 'The Pearl of Death' and a poverty row film 'The Brute Man'. This film runs just over an hour and is a quick paced thriller for those who enjoy the good old horror days.

The print here looks very good and Universal has included some extras including lots of stills, lobby cards, posters and some on screen trivia about the film. I doubt this film and the four others included on the box set Universal Cult Horror collection will see a general release.",1300924800,6,1034,4.614130434782608
567871,5,6303129161,"I don't understand why some of these old B horror and sci-fi films get passed over for DVD release.

567872,4,6303129161,"Just because a movie is bad doesn't mean people won't like it.  House of Horrors is a B-schlock classic. Contrived, marginal acting, sub-intelligent plot, low-brow entertainment, fantastic! And I find the contention that poor Rondo Hattan was ""exploited"" to be very tiresome. The guy has gone down into cinematic history! He has a solid fan base nearly 60 years after his death. Tom Cruise, Richard Gere and others adored purely on their looks can only hope to be so fondly remembered. I give House of Horrors a B for Bad. And that's damn good.",1025568000,4,544,4.787234042553192
567873,3,6303129161,"A second string suspense thriller from Universal Studios.  A crazed sculptor and a brute killer form an unholy alliance and spread dreadful death through the art community.  The best thing this little movie has going for it is Rondo Hatton as The Creeper.  Hatton suffered from a disfiguring bone disease and he played horror roles without makeup.  He goes around snapping the spines of nasty art critics who disparage the work of his sculptor friend.  Hatton's range as an actor was limited, but he managed to project some of the melancholy isolation from the world that was a trademark of Boris Karloff's portrayal of the Frankenstein monster.  His friendship with De Lange, the sculptor, recalls the monster and Ygor.  The script is guilty of second rate cliches.  Most of the attempts at witty remarks sound corny and fall flat.  Robert Lowery plays a Vargas type illustrator who specializes in cheesecake art.  Baby boomers may recall Lowery as Big Tim Champion of the old ""Circus Boy"" TV program.  Look close, and you can see Virginia Christine (later Mrs. Olson of Folgers Coffee fame) as a doomed streetwalker.  Throw it all in the blender and you have a lightweight but enjoyable thriller.  It's good stuff for collectors of Grade B horror flicks.  Other viewers should tread carefully. ;-)",998352000,5,1299,4.953703703703703
567874,1,6303129161,"The films premise is simple and inept, look how ugly the Creeper is ! Rondo Hatton who was disfigured due to being gassed in the trenches in WW1, which caused his limbs to grow abnormally is throughly exploited in this  disgusting attempt at entertainment. Apart from the fact that the Creeper  cycle of films were diabolically poor in the first place and that as far as  I can remember when it was first released the ads said ""See the  ugliest man in Hollywood, The ugliest man alive"" as at draw for the  audience is a sign of a very very poor production. The only good thing that  came out of this cinematic offal is that Hatton ended up marrying one of  the most beautiful starlets of the time I cant remember her name but I do  remember a reporter asking how she could marry such an ugly man. From a  time America should be ashamed of this repugnent trash should be shown to  people in an object lesson on how insensitive and ignorant we humans can  be.",964051200,3,957,4.350282485875706

THE FILM IS GREAT AND RONDO WAS SENSATIONAL IN IT AS I REMEMBERED HIM IN THE MOVIE WITH SHERLOCK HOLMES WHICH I BOUGHT ALSO. IT'S A SHAME THAT HE DIED BEFORE HE GOT TO SEE HIMSELF IN HORRORS. ALL THE STARS WERE VERY GOOD IN IT. I'VE ALWAYS BEEN A FAN OF VIRGINIA GREY, WHOM I REMEMBER HAD THE MOST BEAUTIFUL ANKLES IN THE WORLD WHEN SHE PLAYED IN JOHN WAYNES MOVIE ""FLAME OF THE BARBARY COAST"" WITH THE GORGEOUS ANN DVORAK.

567951,4,6303129161,"House of Horrors is one hour and five minutes and was released in theaters on March 29, 1946. The movie stars Rondo Hatton as the Creeper and Martin Kosleck as Marcel DeLange. Marcel is a sculptor who has just received a bad review from an art critic. He decides to commit suicide and just as he is about to drown himself save a guy from the river. Marcel takes the person back to his home to nurse him back to health. Marcel does not know at the time that the person he has saved is The Creeper. When he finds about the person he has saved, Marcel uses the Creeper to his advantage. The Creeper murders art critics who stand in Marcel way of fame. The movie end when the Creeper turn on Marcel and the Creeper is shot by the police. Barring the romance part, that is all there is to the movie. This was the second of three Creeper movies; the first was The Pearl of Death and the third was the Brute Man. There was to be a series of Creeper films but due to Rondo Hatton untimely death, halted that idea. The only thing I did not like about the movie was the last five minutes which I though could have had a better ending. House of Horrors gets a B+.",1344643200,4,1152,4.124444444444444
