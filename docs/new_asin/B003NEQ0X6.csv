8400932,5,B003NEQ0X6,"Bridges that gap between text and performance rather well. well made with competent acting by most actors esp. the Duchess, Bosola and Ferdinand. Its being shot in a theatre adds and brings out nuances that would have been lost in a feature film. Stage performances are difficult, this works. It starts slow but grows on you as you watch about one-third. overall a good experience.",1382313600,2,381,4.876923076923077
8400933,2,B003NEQ0X6,"Having seen the play many years ago, I can say that it lacks the electricity of great Shakespeare. The last scene, in which the Duchess is garroted by her brothers goes on -- and on; and the Duchess has more to say even, remarkably, after she is dead. But there are other parts of the play that will entertain the tolerant viewer.",1362441600,,330,4.338709677419355
8400934,4,B003NEQ0X6,i felt it was a fine job--but the `1972  version though deeply cut--is  more powerful but I would urge  everyone to see  this. It is a remarkable play a very great play,1358380800,2,168,4.15625
8400935,4,B003NEQ0X6,"Minimalist staging very effective, an the costuming at some indeterminate early 20th century period did not distract. A few times the 17th century dialogue wasat odds wit the visuals (e.g. references to swords wen tere were none) but still worth viewing.",1357257600,,254,5.219512195121951
8400936,4,B003NEQ0X6,"One of the major issues facing those who have to teach drama of the Elizabethan/Jacobean period other than Shakespeare is the paucity of dvds as  aids to teaching.  Recent productions of The Revenger's Tragedy and The Changeling have been encouraging but those productions deviate considerably from the original texts and often they seem to be entirely different plays made into film.  This is not to criticize such productions (they have their place)but they are not always helpful to the teacher. The Stage & Screen version of the Duchess of Malfi is much more faithful to the original and given that there is a ""live"" audience it is the next best things to actually seeing it on stage.  That said, I do not totally agree with the downplaying of the incest theme (Ferdinand's feelings for his sister) or the choice of actor for Antonio who comes across as very lively from the outset and not the serious clerk as found in the original text. But that is carping.  I do hope Stage & Screen extend their productions to the Restoration as well. I would love to see a play like The Country Wife produced on DVD.",1337040000,15,1108,4.661538461538462
8400937,5,B003NEQ0X6,"One of the great plays of the English theatre, The Duchess of Malfi tells the tale of the young widowed duchess who marries again for love. But her new husband, Antonio, is from a lower class and the marriage must be kept secret from the Duchess's brothers for fear of their revenge. Although written around the same period as Shakespeare the language is much more accessible and often poetic.

This production of Webster's tragedy is boosted by the great performance of Aislin McGuckin in the title role. Her Duchess is playful when courting Antonio, strong in defiance of her brothers and beautifully controlled in the emotional latter stages of the play. The rest of the cast are very good too although I did find that sometimes they spoke very quickly (the director's decision?) and some of the words were lost. The subtitles helped here.

I've always felt that the play should naturally end after Act 4, especially since the fifth and final act is a bit over the top for modern tastes. It is hard (as with some Shakespeare) for the tragedy not to turn to farce, but on the whole this production manages to maintain the atmosphere to the end, thanks mainly to a strong performance from Tim Treloar playing Bosola.

I am delighted that Stage on Screen are filming stage performances of some of the classic plays that people outside the big cities rarely get a chance to see and I hope they continue. Highly recommended.",1320537600,13,1422,4.725806451612903
8400938,5,B003NEQ0X6,"For most fans of Jacobean drama, John Webster's THE DUCHESS OF MALFI (1613) is the most powerful tragedy of that period not written by a man named Shakespeare. This opinion is so widely held that the play has become a standard selection in all of the drama anthologies of the period.
It is also a ferociously demanding piece of theater, full of complex speeches, strange reversals, and extravagant stage effects. For this reason, it is seldom performed. Your odds of seeing it in the U.S. are only slightly better than those of meeting the author.
Though neither the distributor (Stage On Screen) nor the dramatic company (Greenwich Theatre, London) were known to me, I bought this DVD blind because I knew that, however uneven the production might be, this was likely to be my only chance of ever seeing this great play  performed.
I slowly realized that I was watching a marvelously spoken, intelligently staged, and professionally recorded production performed in front of a live audience.
The Duchess is played magnificently by a statuesque redhead (Aslin McGuckin) who accomplishes the difficult task of projecting the nobility-in-suffering Webster apparently intended this character to embody. In counterpoint to this, the tool villain Bosola (Tim Treloar)delivers his character's soliloquies with fine shadings of melancholy and outrage. And the hedonistic Cardinal (Mark Hatfield) is full of energy, delighted at this own corruption. While all of the actors are well cast, these three have voices as supple and distinctive as musical instruments.
This production relies on a combination of minimal, all-black sets (outlines, really), colorful costumes which suggest the period, and sharp contrasts in lighting to create dramatic effects. The recording, both audio and video, is (to my eyes and ears) as good as one might expect in theater itself. Better actually, because you always have a good view of the action. So I have no hesitation in recommending this DVD to others theater lovers.
One final note: One of the puzzles in the plot is the jealousy of the Duchess's twin brother Ferdinand and his subsequent madness. I have been told (by the eminent Professor John J. Perry) that it was a common bit of folklore that twins had incest in the womb and that Webster was drawing on this folk belief as motivation for Ferdinand's persecution of his sister after her secret marriage.",1316304000,25,2389,5.125641025641026
