8441409,5,B004UC7P7A,I have been training BJJ for a number of years now and I have to say that this video does offer some very good techniques that I haven't learned in the gym. You do need to be in BJJ to really understand these moves. The leg locks alone are very advanced. This video is advanced for the beginner but can be learned and repeated. Very well done in my opinion. Looking forward to a volume 2.,1427760000,,388,4.118421052631579

However, if you are not currently training you may want to look for other introduction moves to the art of Jiu Jitsu first, becasue this will show you one technique, one angle and then it moves on to the next.  there is nothing wrong with that, personally, training already it is a nice DVD and offers some good moves so i can stop it and try it with my partners then move on to the next, but if you are not training already and don't understand Jiu Jitsu a little bit, then you may want to pick up something else along with this.",1360627200,,614,4.151260504201681
