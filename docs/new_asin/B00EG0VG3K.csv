8605181,5,B00EG0VG3K,Denise Hopkins does a wonderful job guiding you through breathing and movements that focus on the heart and help open up your chest.  This video is for all levels fo yoga and easy to make modifications if you have to. I also love that the whole practice including final svasana  and meditation is 45-50 minutes depending on whether you include the intro.  This makes it easier to fit into my day.  I have had tightness in my chest and my breathing was getting shorter from too many years and too much time hunched over a computer.  This video has been easy to incorporate inot my life and has helped open up my posture for better breathing.,1411948800,3,640,4.482758620689655
8605182,5,B00EG0VG3K,I was surprised at how easy it is and such a workout I get from it. Really relaxing and love the meditation. I feel it is helping me to calm down which in turn takes away my stress which has lowered my blood pressure. This video is recommend by me whole heartedly.,1403913600,5,264,4.096153846153846
8605183,5,B00EG0VG3K,"I recently purchased this video to help me deal with high blood pressure.  We also have a history of heart disease in my family and I wanted to be as proactive as possible about trying to get the pressure down and relieve some stress so I wouldn't have to go on medication.  I had previously done the Peggy Kappy video, which was fine, but it mainly deals with how to do a sun salutation depending on what your limitations are, and I was looking for a video that was more like a yoga class where the teacher walks you through several different poses.  This video fit the bill perfectly!  It was easy to follow (let's just say I'm not a tiny little yogi in perfect shape) and I found the teacher offered many options for different levels of fitness, and the pace was slow enough that I could keep up but not so slow I was bored.  I was surprised that the final meditation wasn't just about disease, it was about treating your heart respectfully and it gave many visualizations on how to care for your heart - when I got off the mat I felt lighter and taller, and also really in tune with my breathing.  Overall, this video is amazing, not just for heart disease, but for anyone who wants to slow down, de-stress and live fully (okay, pretty much everyone).  Totally recommend.",1326240000,12,1275,4.4
