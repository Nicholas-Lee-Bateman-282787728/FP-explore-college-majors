5273332,4,B0096F60KO,"After Sex Stories, where writer-director, and former porn actress, Ovidie took a look at the differences women and men have toward sex, with this new film she takes a look at three different couples facing their mid-life crisis. What made the first film so funny was seeing how women and men perceived the same (sex) stories from their different points of view. This time around the message seems to be pretty much one-sided: men facing their mid-life crisis want to have an extra-marital relationship with a girl much younger than them, and women just want to, well, keep on with life as is, as a divorce costs too much money and takes too long accomplish. Hmm, this coming from a woman who claims to be a feminist.

While for Sex Stories the sex scenes consisted of short segments, this time around Ovidie seemes to relish on them; they last longer and show an aspect of porn or hardcore that is usually relegated to a mere freak show or a sexual preversion: mainly that people over 40 years old also engage in sex, and just as actively as their younger counterparts. So, nothing wrong here, it's only that the message seems to be very simple. That said, Ovidie acquits herself by promoting something new in a business that has become nothing more than a gynecological show of sexual acrobatic acts of an unrelenting endurance. This film accomplishes what many arthouse movies mainly try to show under the pretext of a pseudo-intellectual philosophical agenda, when all they want to show is some gratuitous t & a. The good thing about Ovidie, even though she's called the intellectual among pornographers, is that, at least in my point of view, she doesn't seem to pretend that this is nothing more than a film looking into the mores, albeit of a sexual nature, of today's couples. The fact that at times it's both poignant and funny, makes it all the more believable and less pretentious than the usual highbrow arthouse fodder.

As is, we still live in a society that though claiming to be in the high-tech of the 21st Century, is still crawling backwards to the Middle Ages with its ludicrous mores concerning sexual matters. This film only got an X certificate in France, which means it could only be shown in XXX Rated porno houses, and as such didn't even get a video (or DVD) release in its own home country, as it's considered adult material the sort only pervs buy in sex shops and hide under their raincoats.

But nothing could be further from the truth.

Sure, the actors are porn veterans (Ovidie claims to have shot over 4000 minutes of film to finally edit it down to a 100 minute film due to the actors not even trying to ""learn their lines"" properly), and as such might not be on a par with your average Hollyboo stars, but they play their parts satisfactorily, and are able to do their own, ahem, ""stunts"" without requiring a body double. In fact, you'll find more sincerity in this film than in any other Hollyweird flick.

That said, I'm always game for a new Ovidie project (by the way, there's an interesting documentary on her included here, though they should check with the subtitles; Candida Royalle gets credited as a ""royal candidate"", not to mention Annie Sprinkle's name which is misspelt as Annice Prinkle), and this one doesn't disappoint, though as another reviewer has pointed out ""I preferred the first one better"".

Interesting, though not mind-altering, but not a pseudo-philosophical (read boring) film by any means. I would put my money on films like this, that at least treat their characters as real human beings and not as fantasy objects. Well worth a look, if you aren't shocked by the nature of sex.",1374105600,29,3645,4.705329153605016
5273333,4,B0096F60KO,Could have been better. First one is. But it also has some great scenes. Camera views could have been better though lol. Overall ok buy.,1372291200,7,136,4.48
8536647,4,B0096F60KO,"I like Ovidie's films generally -- very explicit with a thin plot. This film deals with infidelity, mostly men cheating on their wives. There is one scene at the end, where a woman in her 40's picks up a younger man. When she attempts to pay him, he refuses the money saying a woman as beautiful as her should not have to pay for sex. Ovidie spends too much time shooting fellatio, to the point where I need to fast forward the video. It gets boring. There is no lesbian activity (unless I missed it) -- only long scenes of guys getting off. There is a change coming, where more woman are producing porn and depicting the woman getting satisfied. As we all know, most men are finished in 5 minutes, leaving his partner frustrated.
Ovidie tends to use the same actors in her films, especially the men.  They look ordinary, not arousing, but they are probably nice guys. Finally, I was hoping to see more of Rebecca Lord.",1529712000,,919,4.437869822485207
