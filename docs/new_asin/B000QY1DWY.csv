This is only three discs and is a very condensed version of the full tv show. It didn't say that anywhere on the site, there was so much missing at times it didn't make sense. The subtitles for english are also horrible. They refer to him as ""train man"" ""cable car man"" ""trolly man"". Some subtitles didn't make sense at all, and some words weren't even close to being correct translation from Japanese to English. Look for the complete set with all the episodes, this one is a total of 3 hours.",1518912000,,603,4.252173913043478
8198167,4,B000QY1DWY,"I love watching this series, but I get scolded by my kids when I forget to have the subtitles turned on.  There are however a few interesting translations that look like they went into Chinese first and then to English instead of straight to English from Japanese.  The characters are fun and we laugh and cry throughout the whole journey.",1421712000,,339,4.633333333333334
8198168,5,B000QY1DWY,"This TV series deals with the ""true"" story of a geek who comes to the aid of a woman that he sees being mauled by a drunk abroad a subway train.  The woman thanks the geek by sending him a pair of tea cups.  Through the chat forum that the geek participates in, the members provide encouragement and advice on how to pursue the lady.  The geek has to go through several crises in trying to befriend the lady.  The TV series consisted of 11 episodes.  The subtitle work of this DVD set is spotty in some areas since it was not done professionally.  Often, you don't see the English translation at all while a character continues to speak Japanese. The main male character does come off a bit too ""over the top"" in some of the acting.  I think the chat members are one of the strongest points in this series.  Their reactions and advice that they give the geek are hilarious at times.  This is an entertaining series with good plot flow with a good emotional storyline.

This two DVD set is in NTSC with no region coding so it is playable on USA players.  The main menu does not have any subtitle setting.  You have to use the player remote button to change the subtitles (from none to Chinese, English, or Japanese).  I tried to play this DVD on a Blu-ray player, but wasn't able to access the subtitle change option using the Blu-ray remote.  I was able to access it on a standard DVD remote.

This set has the 11 TV episodes plus the first special episode (Train Man vs. Guitar Man) after the series ended (there was a second special episode, but that is not included in this set).  It also contains the movie version as well (which has a different cast).  That is why you see all four central cast members on the front photo of the DVD set (two from the movie and two from the TV show).  Personally, the TV series was better for me.  Better plot development, better supporting cast, and a more attractive heroine.  I purchased my set at a much lower price than on this site (for below $20).  The series has lots of laughs and tears.  Enjoy.",1294358400,4,2042,4.332453825857519
