Seeing these two stories on this video, reminded us that God is still moving among us. We need to re-learn about and BELIEVE what God wants to do everywhere--including America.",1379980800,,330,4.706896551724138

This is a follow-up video, which follows the same format as the last. It examines Gods movement in Northern Canada (Nunavut), the Northern Islands in Scotland and Uganda. Each country giving powerful testimony to the capacity of prayer, unity and faithfulness of God. As for the details of each, you will just have to watch it and see! This is a great video for all to watch, whether in church or at home. I would even recommend if you do not know Jesus that you still watch this video. It very accurately portraits the love and power of God that He wants to show to all of creation.
On a personal note, I found this video very encouraging. So often, it is easy to get caught up in the web of despair that the media and news inundates us with, day in and day out. This video helped me to refocus my attention on the Lord and what He is doing in the earth. It really gives glory to the Lord and His love and mercy. Numerous times I found myself weeping with joy, overwhelmed with how God had moved and touched all of these people and countries.
He is so good.
For those who enjoyed the last video, Sentinel Ministries has a new video out called ""The Quickening"" that you can purchase through their website.",1068249600,8,1344,4.3585657370517925
