The English dubbing is just great, they did a great job so you can enjoy the visual experience of this movie. It has some light comedy to make you laugh and tragedy to make you pause and action to keep you watching it nonstop.

Definitely glad to have this one in our collection. There's nothing else I can add that others haven't already, but we enjoyed it so much I just had to take the time to give it the 5 stars it so richly deserves.",1304640000,,529,4.186274509803922
4046493,4,B0030LLAFU,"The movie seems to have the mask of being a ""robin hood"" themed movie but I found it to be such a small part of the movie to not even talk about it. Let's say maybe 5 minutes worth of the movie. Essentially Goemon goes by the ""Greatest thief to live"" but he started out as a ninja serving his master that saved him as a small child and taught him how to become strong so that nothing could be taken from him. His master/mentor then was assasinated in which Goemon then took on his ""freedom"" and went into stealing for a living.

Then his past comes back to haunt him and you begin to see how all of the main characters have such a deep history together and everything you thought was wrong.

In  the end I would say this was a pretty good movie. It has some great fighting scenes but I will warn you that this is not a realistic action movie. It has unbeleiveable jumping and swordplay that go well with ninja movies.

Not sure if I will watch this movie again though. I would recommend a rent",1303689600,8,993,4.15625
4046494,5,B0030LLAFU,"Goemon a body guard to a princess turned thief after his lord Oda Nobunagas assassination chooses freedom over service but freedom as we know
comes with price. Stealing from the rich and corrupt and giving to the poor. during one of his heists he comes across a mysterious box that could
unravel a deadly conspiracy and tear Japan apart at the seams into a another civil war can Goemon put a stop to this chaos or will he be torn apart with it?

A beautifully done film with amazing special effects through green screen which most of the film is done in with plenty of emotional impact and crazy over the top action. I was truly impressed with this film on all levels and enjoyed it the beautiful done cgi scenery, the great action scenes through out the
film especially at the last 30 or so minutes of which is pure totally unrealistic but awesome action where he takes on hordes of enemies to enact revenge
for a loss of a friend and save Japan from yet another civil war and finally bring peace to a war torn land.

I highly recommend this film but if you have doubts about it then i would recommend renting it first. But if you like Japanese action films
with some history put in although changed for dramatic effect or if you simply like action films i say buy it, i did and it was truly worth it.

With my respect Thanks for reading my review
I hope it was helpful.",1303516800,20,1371,4.326848249027237
4046495,4,B0030LLAFU,"Goemon is a Japanese folk hero in the tradition of Robin Hood -- fighting tyranny and robbing the rich to give to the poor.

So he was inevitably the subject of an action movie, simply called ""Goemon."" This sleek, stylized historical-fantasy movie looks a little like the ninja lovechild of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Adventures-of-Robin-Hood/dp/B00005JKEZ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Adventures of Robin Hood</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/300/dp/B000QXDED6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">300</a>, but the mix of humor, romance and sharply-drawn action takes a shockingly dark turn in the movie's last third.

Goemon Ishikawa (Ysuke Eguchi) is a clever master thief who likes to give his stolen valuables to the impoverished. But fifteen years ago, he was a loyal ninja serving the brilliant warlord Oda Nobunaga (Hashinosuk Nakamura) -- and after Nobunaga was murdered by a traitor, the disillusioned Goemon became a wandering thief and friend to the poor.

That is, until a literal Pandora's box shows him that Toyotomi Hideyoshi was involved in his master's death -- the very man who is taking Goemon's childhood sweetheart Chacha (Ryoko Hirosue) as his concubine, and preparing to declare war using Western weapons. Along with his old friend/rival Saizo (Takao sawa), Goemon sets out to attack Hideyoshi... but they soon discover that this path only leads to tragedy.

""Goemon"" is one of those movies that has a good-but-not-great script, paired with spellbindingly lovely visuals -- explosive ninja battles on golden rooftops, waterfalls surrounded by glimmering fireflies, and sea battles full of blood and fire. It's a pretty wild ride, and the only problem is that a couple of the characters feel unnecessary (the little boy Goemon rescues).

The first two-thirds of the movie are a pretty steady stream of action, brief romantic scenes, and sepia-toned flashbacks of Goemon's childhood (and especially of the charismatic Nobunaga). But after that, the movie becomes much darker and bleaker, with innocent people being horribly killed and Goemon becoming a more hardened, dark person.

Egichi does a great job as Goemon, both as the rakish thief and the tormented ninja avenger -- sort of like a Japanese Errol Flynn with a touch of Harrison Ford. He's funny, charming and eventually heartwrenching. Hirosue is decent, although she doesn't get to do much except wear enormous dresses and look sad.

But honestly, the title character often gets eclipsed by Saizo -- this is a strong, tragic man who is torn between his old friendship, his intense love for his wife and baby, and his often nasty job. Osawa gives a beautiful performance full of raw emotion, which climaxes in an impassioned speech to the masses, apparently inspiring them to rebel.

""Goemon"" sculpts a folk legend into a fun, thrilling and ultimately tragic adventure movie, and turns out a pretty good movie while it's at it.",1291161600,70,3008,5.624724061810155

My dvd was a knock-off, the cover was well made but still noticably tampered and blurry.
The movie itself worked fine exept for 5-10 seconds missing in the end scene.
The english (have not checked the spanish one) subtitle was bad and sometimes missing comepletely and the timing was often very misplaced and quick.

When I pay full price for a new dvd release that claims to be an original I expect the real deal, for a fake it was ok but not worth what I payed for it!

4046498,4,B0030LLAFU,"For all people who are interested in Japan, it's culture and history the film is a must. The CGI-effects look pretty cool. The story is thrilling and the historical characters complete the picture of a ""what would have been if"" - world. The movie is one of the best japanese films I saw the last years. The only thing reducing the stars to 4 is the cyber-futuristic world. I think the traditional castle of Osaka and traditional samurai would have fitted better.

The fact that Oda Nobunaga and Tokugawa Ieyasu are presented as white noble knights with no faults is arguable. Also the decision to present Toyotomi Hideyoshi as the evil, guarded by futuristic knights with european amor does not seem historically correct. But that film does not claim to present ""the true story"". So I think it is an interesting film, who presents a possible alternative to the historical events.

4046500,5,B0030LLAFU,"All around Goemon is SUCH a thrill to watch. I was still thinking about it days after I saw it. I'm actually really excited to show all my friends.

The story of Goemon is actually that of folklore, and one that doesn't really give too much information about his life. There are some Japanese (I believe) plays about him, but this movie gives a whole new viewpoint on the Goemon lore. I don't wanna spoil it because half of the fun is the story itself.
This movie, on a viewing level, is INcredible! The special effects look superb (a little more superior than in Casshern), the action is well-thought out, the camera angles and directing are clever and fluid, the costumes and backgrounds really put you in the mood of the given scene and overall movie, etc.

I haven't seen such a good movie in a while. Definitely worth adding to your collection. The acting is top notch, and the visuals keep you attracted to the movie all the way to the touching end (and it won't be anything you would expect). I thought the movie ended 5 times over (i'm exagerating) before it actually ended, so I'm guessing it was about a 2 hour movie. PLEASE check it out and spread the word. Great movies like this should be more known.

I don't know what a ""prefect"" movie is or would be...but I have to say there was nothing wrong with this movie in my mind and I wouldn't have changed a THING! 10 out of 10 points for me! Enjoy.",1263427200,14,1408,4.366412213740458
4046501,5,B0030LLAFU,"Cheap CGI that grows on you quickly. Anime like actors and effects that also have their charm. It starts of pretty standards with our GOEMON being Robin Hood in Japan. Through the course of the story, you learn about his past and brings it into the tragic present. The main thing about this movie is that it began as a B movie but got progressively better as it went along. Toward the end, I would compare this with Gladiator or Samurai X. It's really good and worth a watch. It was a very pleasant surprise.",1439856000,,508,4.3578947368421055

4046515,1,B0030LLAFU,"This is a pretty bad movie.  All of the plot elements are derivative from one source or another, with an overwhelming amount of cliched dialogue and situations.  To make up for the lack of originality in the story, they jazz up the visual elements with anachronistic hairstyles, make-up and costumes.  The CGI is bad, and there's way too much of it.  Was there a single shot that didn't have CGI?  It will take awhile for me to get over the fact that I wasted money and time (a lot of time, too, 2 hours and 10 minutes) on this junk.  It's meant to look epic, but it's just silly.  Let me just say this about the plot: it's yet another movie about two guys who grew up as brothers (though they're not biological brothers) who become enemies in adulthood.  That's just one of the tired details.  I could go on and on... Did I mention the bad acting, or the terrible, terrible (terrible to the point of being distracting) soundtrack?

4046518,5,B0030LLAFU,"The film was amazing! From the same director of Casshern this film goes all out with the CGI effects and the acting is A-quality as well. Advertised as a Japanese Robin Hood, it is far more than that. Goemon is a former ninja turned thief after his master, Lord Nobunaga is killed. Fifteen years later he is drawn back into the courts political machinations after he steals Pandora's Box from where it was hidden in the vault of the deputy marshall. The historical context does get tweaked but the director explains this on the bonus disc. He wanted to portray an alternate vision that would show the viewer the grandiosity of Feudal Japan. He succeeds. The superhuman feats of both the hero and foes adds to the film in a way that outdoes some ""marvel"" movies. No way to further review this other than to recommend to both action film goers, Japanese cinemaphiles, and for those that enjoy 5-star films. After Casshern and Goemon will watch for future films from this director.",1378944000,,978,4.691860465116279

4046521,5,B0030LLAFU,"This 2009 film is among the most visually spectacular ever made. The picture compositions are thoroughly artistic, and the live and animated actions simply fantastic. The castings are also very charismatic, and the story tense and dramatic, heightened with some passionate epical music, making it altogether a captivating movie to watch from start to finish.

Then again, it is largely a fantasy movie which uses some historic background to tell an epic story, surrounding the three famous Warlords who successively conquered Japan, and a legendary figure Goemon which has little factual basis. The story made Goemon adopted as a kid by the first conqueror Oda Nobunaga to be trained as a shinobi (ninja). However, when Lord Nobunaga was dead by betrayal in 1582, Goemon fled his castle to become eventually a thief widely applauded by the common folks like Robin Hood.

The movie began 15 years after the death of Nobunaga, when Goemon uncovered accidentally a conspiracy during a theft, namely, Lord Hideyoshi who succeeded Nobunaga was actually one of the conspirators who betrayed him. A main story here is about Goemon's repeated actions to kill the Lord. His first try only killed Hideyoshi's decoy. His second attempt was to save his girlfriend from Hideyoshi primarily, but he aborted the assassination after some moral struggle.

His third act was motivated by Hideyoshi's brutal murder of his shinobi friend Saizo. It is through Saizo's mouth that the film lashed out the heartfelt feelings of the people about the Warlords. Through the last words of Lord Hideyoshi the film also examined the motives of the one who sought absolute power. Historical sources said Toyotomi Hideyoshi did launch massive attacks into Korea in 1592 and 1597, but were driven back with China's forces before his death in 1598.

A recurring message in the film concerns about the consequences of vengeance, particularly self-centered, rash actions against the authority powers. The film ended with Goemon slashing through armies to kill the ruthless lord Mitsunari, reaching a position to kill another lord Leyasu also. But Goemon refrained instead to beseech him to end the warrings so that people could live happily. Historians said Tokugawa Leyasu was the third Warlord who succeeded to unify Japan, to be followed by centuries of peace relatively.

One can see that the themes are complex and serious : war and peace, brutality, betrayal, revenge, perseverance, love, friendship, ..... However, many storylines are unrealistic, and many scenes surreal, such as  cross-cultural architectures and costumes, and supernatural actions like video games. It is obvious the film is laden with symbolic meanings, and the entertainment factors are high, with many gorgeous designs and rich colors of intense tones and contrasts. Watching it in black and white gives one an impressive classical feel, especially when setting it in high contrast and a bit brighter.

The fireflies depicted many times in the movie make me wonder if the director has watched the spectacular BBC series "" Planet Earth "" released internationally in 2007. The "" Caves "" episode has some scenes showing how the glowworms secreted silk threads to trap their preys. The ending theme song "" Rosa "" was performed by the band ' Violet UK ', which stands for ' Red (anger) & Blue (sadness) Underground Kingdom '. The producer Ichise is known for making many Horror films in Japan. Kiriya the director is finishing a third epic film said to be called "" The Last Knights "", starring Clive Owen and Morgan Freeman.",1370304000,,3562,5.13103448275862
4046522,1,B0030LLAFU,"I have always enjoyed Asian moviemakers use of action and history, even if the action is a little over the top and the history taken artistic advantage of. In the case of Goemon, however, the advantage taken was beyond the line of good taste. The events of the story are based, loosely, upon the events near the end of the medieval period of Japan, what is most commonly called Sengoku, or country at war. Almost all of the characters, major ones and minor ones, are at least named after historical people, but that is where the relation to history stops.
 How history is handled in this movie is almost comical expect for one fact that makes it insulting. This is just a movie and no reasonable intelligent person believes that history will be treated honorably by those who make entertainment, and sometimes that is just fine. However, in Goemon, the goal of the hero is to kill Toyotomi Hideyoshi, a general of Oda Nobunage who very briefly unified Japan before Tokugawa Ieyasu in 1600. The events in the movie have Hideyoshi meet his end before he orders the invasion of the Korean peninsula. This invasion, known as the Imjin War, lasted for seven years and resulted in the deaths of hundreds of thousands of people. It was an utter failure for Hideyoshi and was a brutal war for the Korean people. The fact that this movie wants to dig up the roots of history to tell their tale and then skip over these blood soaked seven years straight to the Battle of Sekigahara is insulting. Perhaps such an inslut could be forgiven if the entertainment factor was there, but that is not the case.
 While Goemon is live action, it takes on an Anime influenced fantasy appearance with a touch of steam-punk. The steam-punk element is mostly found in the firearms used and a few objects, like a very sophisticated door and a mechanical Pandora's Box. The Anime influence is even more apparent because everything is computer generated, even the actors themselves during some action scenes. This really doesn't work well, as nothing looks real. The entire world is computer generated, grass, water, trees, sometimes even the furniture the actors are sitting on looks generated. The CGI effects are not good, there is a horrible contrast between the actors and their environment. If one wanted to be nice they could say that this was done on purpose to bring closer the worlds of live action and Anime, but the argument that the production company is cheap could also have a strong case.
 The writing is terrible. At the beginning of the movie a lieutenant of Hideyoshi, Mitsunari, is having his men search for Pandora's Box, which Goemon has stolen. They are very worried over it and are killing anyone who might get wind of it. So, one would think that this box would play a large role in this tale, which it doesn't. You see it at the start and then in disappears. It is not even explained why a object of western mythology is in Japan in the first place. No one talks about it until the very end when Goemon hands to a young boy he has been taking care of and gives him some banal speech about hope, or not being vengeful, before Goemon goes and avenges the death of his former lord Nobunaga. I am not sure. No one says anything worth saying or anything that makes that much sense. The motivations of the character is equally unclear. While it might seem like vengeance or greed is a motivation, characters don't seem fully committed. Of course, this could be the fault of the actors who are all flat and deadpan. Whether it is the fault of the writers, the director, or actors there is very little emotion or believably to these Anime devolved historical figures.
 The only thing the actors have going for them is their looks. Just about everyone in this movie is model from a magazine cover. Expect for those men who are to inspire a very weak and ineffectual comic relief, they are all handsome and stoic. The women are beautiful even when wearing some of the most ridiculous costumes. While everyone's hair is in place and make-up impeccably done this doesn't help the movie. The unbelievable good looks of the actors just adds to the unbelievably of the entire movie. It does however explain their poor acting.",1360454400,,4208,4.644295302013423

This movie is a modern, stylized tale of Ninjas, Samurai, and cruel Shoguns in 16th century Japan. This movie contains many other legendary Japanese historical figures. Goemon uses CGI to make the live action more like an anime people jump higher, run faster, etc... The CGI is over the top and sometimes takes away from the story but is generally good. There are a few scenes at the end that are the coolest action scenes I have seen in any action movie. The soundtrack is top notch with sweeping and emotionally charged symphonic music. The humor in this movie seems awkward and out of place and there are about 5 scenes they could have done without. The princess like character has a really stupid name ""Lady Chacha.""

I give Goemon a 4 star rating because of the entire experience it offers. A good story. Fantastic visuals. Amazing action and pretty good acting, with interesting characters.

If you love japanese culture, be it historic or modern, i recommend this movie. Its one of the best ninja movies ive seen, filled with humor, great battles, some romance, intrigue/ betrayal and honor.

HOWEVER, make no mistake, this is NOT anything near the brilliance of an Akira Kurosawa film. So don't expect masterpiece. But its sheer scope and vision would of inspired Kurosawa, and if he were still on this earth today, he would probably do amazing work with all of today's cutting edge CGI and effects.

The visual quality is excellent, but it is otherwise near worthless as a reflection of the culture and history of Japan at this time.  The clothing is very european influenced (lace-up boots!) , and commoners display  attitudes that would get them summarily killed for insolence.  Architecture is on an  incredibly huge scale, rivaling the scope of the chinese imperial  forbidden city.  I have tried to park my brain and watch this movie a number of times and find its inaccuracies  too intrusive to finish it.  If your knowledge of japanese history and culture is marginal, this  movie will probably be quite enjoyable.

But the lasting effect for me is the visual and cinematographic aspects.
Quite literally, it is like being an audience to a beautiful video game being played on your TV.
The art direction is epic, and you will come out impressed, especially since it did not have the American-level Hollywood budget.
The story might not have satisfied me, but I certainly applaud the visual aspects of this movie.

4046537,3,B0030LLAFU,"This film is two parts STAR WARS, one part KILL BILL, several parts Shakespearean plays, a whole lota PlayStation, one part UNFORGIVEN with some ZATOICHI thrown in. Surprising it's spawned by the 'anonymous' mind of Kazuari Kirya, the man who wrote/directed GOEMON. Anonymous?

He's only referred to as 'the enterprising director' on GOEMAN's package; He wrote/directed both the international cult sensation CASSHERN (a staggering, horribly beautiful marvel of inscrutability; viewers still argue online what it's about) and GOREMON's rip-roaring clearer-cut love/revenge/action/blood-fest.

In fact the common denominator is a pacifist plea: War/imperialism is wrong, dumb, tragic, wasteful, inhumane, awful. So no surprise theme-wise for two films/one director/writer. (But that's just my interpretation; as said, many people see different messages; see for yourself.)

GOEMON&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Goemon-Blu-ray/dp/B004DMIIO6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Goemon [Blu-ray</a>]is more 'entertaining' and more clear-cut in its message. Yet it seems far less-sophisticated because its cautionary tale is more spelled out. For me only two elements deducted stars: The writing/editing didn't make it clear enough as to who was who and why they did what they did do. (RATS! I just discovered I could've gotten the BluRay version for a buck more... In DVD images are great; they must be something in BluRay)

Then the english dubbing and subtitles seemed keyed to American teens; like colloquial terms that are cool. Contractions too, Which pertain too to the geysers of blood and rolling heads and bouncing body parts as well. 'Whatever' (yes a popular phrase for kids today), the marketing folk must have been aiming for the youth (gamers?) market. A very, very far cry from CASSHERN<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Casshern/dp/B000UAEBFK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Casshern</a>, which targeted more-sophisticated young adults.

One criteria I put on films is will I see it again and maybe again?

I've seen CASSHERN three or four times and will see it again. The visuals alone merit repeat exposures. And the script is as enigmatic as ever baffled viewers. Maybe that makes GOEMON CASSHERN Lite. (With VERY different scripts, action, graphics)

I may see GOREMON maybe a few times more over the years. But the now too-familiar computer-generated troops charging, exploding enemies (just remembered: combatants used machine guns and grenades to trash one another) get less interesting viewed again and again.

One thing both films offer though is great CGI and art direction. Both are dramatic eye feasts. GOREMON  wins for 'getting it' while CASSHERN wins for intriguing, multi-level thought-provoking conversation-starting concepts, conventional versus contrary. Both films have relative merits worth viewing and re-viewing.",1315612800,,2912,6.117647058823529

For the most part the cgi is very well done. but there are a few scenes that i feel the cgi is kind of blurry looking. This is only in 1 or 2 scenes though, so it really doesn't affect much. This movie is definately worth checking out, but it isn't going to be for everyone.

4046543,3,B0030LLAFU,"Judge David Johnson, DVD Verdict -- ""For straight-up sensory overload, not much is going to eclipse the craziness of Goemon. Before I continue, fair warning: If CGI leaves you cold, steer clear. Like 300, Goemon is virtually all computer-generated, featuring actors with their prop swords (in most cases) standing in front of green screens delivering their lines. In fact, there were more than a few occasions that it felt like I was simply watching an extended cut-scene for a Japanese role-playing game on the PS3. I am on record as someone who has become ambivalent towards CGI overuse, especially with regards to action scenes, but I'll give Goemon a pass; from the outset we're in a hyper-stylized world and realism isn't a commodity. My two biggest problems stem from the substance and the style: 1) the film is not a brisk two hours, its myriad sub-plots, character arcs and exposition chunks slowing the momentum down far too much and, 2) the potentially coolest action moments were nearly impossible to see. I could handle a sagging pace--and the middle act of Goedon is glacial--if the action pay-off was ample, but mostly I was squinting just to decipher the over-the-top computer renderings. For example, there's a huge scene toward the end as Goemon scales a tower to square off with the evil lord and he has bound through ascending levels, defeating ninjas and dodging cannon fire. Nifty in theory but almost impossible to follow thanks to the overwhelming busy-ness and hyperactive edits that were stuffed in. Not that the Blu-ray wasn't trying, because the 2.35:1 transfer (1080p, MPEG-4 AVC) is a strong performer. The resolution provides an eyeful, which can be bittersweet: there is some seriously gorgeous effects to gawk at, but the enhanced clarity also pull the rug out from underneath some laughable visual effects. Two engrossing Dolby TrueHD audio tracks: Japanese 6.1 and English 6.1 (go with the original for the extra channel and the lack of dubbing) are included. The disc is rounded out by an hour's worth of behind-the-scenes content, showcasing how the film was staged and the effects were incorporated.""",1310774400,,2137,5.056657223796034

4046545,5,B0030LLAFU,"Remember the awesome Asian fliks of old? But kicking from start to finish. Or, you got a sob story packed full of the main character crying like a baby; a good emotional tale that shows the soft side of the usually indestructible hero with only a halfway decent fight or two. This film on the other hand, is one of the great ones that sit right in the middle in between the early Jackie Chan directed films previously unreleased in the states, and Storm Riders, one of the best for Dragon Ball Z style fighting. GOEMON has an amazing emotional story that builds throughout and really makes you feel something for the characters, multiple characters, not just the hero 'Goemon'. This movie doesn't just jump from fight scene to fight scene with some poorly written filler masquerading as a plot line, it does rely heavily on the brilliant story but, the fighting that it does have in itself certainly makes the movie worth buying, even if your the type that isn't into watching all that ""talking crap"" ...or reading crap if you prefer subtitles like myself.

4046547,5,B0030LLAFU,"Far from a perfect movie, but a great movie none-the-less as the whole rises above the parts.  For me, it's the underlying historical themes about fate, personal choices, the lust for power and it's never-ending affect on the world that pushes it over the line.  I truly enjoyed it.  The plot was interesting and complex.  Visually, if you accept the film on its own terms, it's stunning.  It has the usual sense of duty and fate over-whelming personal lives so common in this genre, but with some hopeful twists thrown in.

An apt commentary on today's world, at heart, it can be enjoyed on many levels.  Two thumbs up!

2011-08-11 Update -- I think about this flawed masterpiece a lot and that's another indication of the substance and value embedded within it.

4046548,4,B0030LLAFU,"For the Modern Japanese Martial Arts Film Aficionado, Visually it was like watching Cashern (makes sense since it was the same director) with a Robin Hood like twist. Its Fantasy Medieval Japan with western Knight Armor. It is very CGI heavy with action sequences that look like it could only really happen in Anime. Like  most Asian Action Films these days its filled with action humor and tragic situations. If you liked ""Dagger of Kamuei"" , ""Cashern"" and ""Shinobi"" then you should probably go watch this. Im a huge Supporter of the Genre (so naturally I am biased) and I don't really think this film is for everyone but I am a Japanese martial arts film junkie and I rank it up there with Dagger of Kamui and Shinobi. I don't want to Spoil anything so you aren't going to find Spoilers in this review.

4046550,5,B0030LLAFU,"This movie caught my eye, as I have been trying to increase my Foreign Film collection.  I have always been curious with anything that has to do with Japanese history (especially the unification period).  It literally grabbed my attention in the first minute and a half, and never let go.  The time period this movie is based on was one full of civil strife and unrest for Japan, with class and rank clearly defined and Feudal Lords constantly fighting for power to control the whole country.  And while the movie stylizes the mood and scenery greatly in regards to these things, it still held some historical accuracy.  Most of the main characters in the movie actually existed during this time period:  Oda Nobunaga, Mitsuhide Aketchi, Hideyoshi Toyotomi, Ieyasu Tokogawa, Hitori Hanzo.  I'm sure there are more, but those are the ones I caught.

Many of the reviews have brought up the utter beauty of the landscape and architectural design.  Needless to say, I am on the same side of the fence.  Scenes in the forest FEEL like a forest, scenes in a castle FEEL like a castle, and so on.  Sometimes you DO feel like it's obvious you're looking at a green screen or floor.  But it all seems integrated smoothly with the actors/actresses utilizing that space, so you don't end up paying attention to it that closely.  The sets are busy; lots of extras wandering around and adding ""life"" to the background.  The colors are vibrant and the sound is crisp and clear.  My only qualm with quality is that the English dub track sounds a bit ""goofy,"" whereas the Japanese track is emotional and feels more decisive.  Also with the Japanese track, you get 6.1 surround instead of Eng 5.1.....not a huge difference if you don't have the extra speaker.

The action is frequent and fast!  Obviously, as one can see from the preview, the scope of realism is stretched.  But what good are action sequences that abide by all natural laws of physics?! Joking....but the action is good.  Some shots are up close and a little cluttered, but others are even paced and use a lot of form.

To sum it up, this movie really took my breath away with an, albeit, LOOSE historical relevance, but historical nonetheless. The combination of action, drama, atmosphere, mood, and dialog progresses the movie fluidly and you may be surprised by how many times you catch yourself saying ""ah"" or ""wow.""

***on a side note* If you are looking for any literature regarding the subject matter of this time period in Japanese history, I HIGHLY HIGHLY HIGHLY recommend ""TAIKO.""  It is a very detailed, and very long book (but worth the read) regarding the deep  relationship between Hideyoshi Toyotomi and the majority of those listed in the first paragraph of this review.",1305072000,11,2737,4.762208067940552

The Chinese movies (this one as well) always have more circus acrobats in them doing acrobatics instead of using sound technic.
