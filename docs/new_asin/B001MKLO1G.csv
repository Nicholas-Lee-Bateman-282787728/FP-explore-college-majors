8321397,5,B001MKLO1G,"This should be taught in every High School!  I can't believe that we are all put out into the world without knowing how to manage our credit.  I had a few ""knocks"" on my credit and two of the three were from stupid little things that I didn't even remember.  Fortunately, I was able to clear these up easily - now that I know what to do.  Now I am working on the final blemish and in a few months my credit will be back above 700 - where it belongs!  I definitely recommend this CD - the info is golden and it works.",1284163200,,516,3.923076923076923
8321398,5,B001MKLO1G,This was life altering! I had a 620 credit score and had no idea where to start. I ordered this disc on a whim and ended up learning a ton. I followed the steps and it has been 4 months. I just checked my score today and it is 735. OMG! I could not be happier. I recommend this to anyone who wants to raise their score and doesn't want to spend a lot of money on a credit counselor. Yay!,1279238400,,387,3.7901234567901234
