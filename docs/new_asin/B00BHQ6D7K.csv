She instantly becomes a target for everyone who wants to take advantage of her powers. Much to her surprise and reluctance, her guardian is no other than her childhood bully. As time goes by, Izumiko and her guardian become closer and are able to make some interesting friends as well.

I've watched all twelve episodes. The artwork was so amazing in this anime. The story line was a good idea, but wasn't carried out well. Even a few characters had some interesting personalities, but the character development needed to be more detailed. Overall, the story was lacking. The first 2 or 3 episodes were the most exciting and then the story got weaker. But all the episodes were still entertaining. Actually I wish they would have continued with a second season, because they didn't wrap everything up. I would watch it again. The music to this anime is great. I wish I could find the songs on iTunes.",1384560000,2,1003,4.634831460674158
