The DVD says they did their best to clean up this set, which was a portentous sign. The 'I Love Lucy' and 'Here's Lucy' sets are much better viewing quality. It makes me wonder if it is the company issuing these or if they truly were unable to clean them up? Even 'Green Acres', which was made the same time, is immaculate quality. Still, you gotta get 'em when you can find 'em. And, while the plot themes are repetitive and you wish Gale Gordon would tone it down even SOMETIMES (I think Lucy saw him as a quasi-father figure and never gave him hard direction), there are lots of laughs to be had. Thanks for the laughter, Lucy. :-)",1130112000,6,792,4.431506849315069
