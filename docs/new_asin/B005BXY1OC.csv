8464554,5,B005BXY1OC,"This vid' is a witness to a crime. It is proof positive thatthose glorious... of 'the golden age of animation' committed actsof 'dithpicable' villainy in a desperate bid to stealthily extractevery last chuckle, chortle, guffaw, and hysterical cackle from therib cages of a vulnerable and innocent audience. These guys should belocked up! If not for our benefit then at least for their own. 'Bugs'has never looked so good, even after more than sixty rabbit seasons ofwise guy action the old grey hare with looney chums Daffy and Porkystill outgun their nearest rivals. It was great to relive thoseclassic moments of beautifully timed comic absurdity from thecollective brilliance of the masters of a unique artform. I recommendit to anyone who never stopped to analyse why a lisping cat who walkson two legs and thinks a kangaroo is a giant mouse is funny. Thisvideo is a delightful and timeless gem. Thumbs up!
