8165660,5,B000M1FZFW,Never disappointed in a Poirot production and the service from Amazon,1488240000,,69,5.363636363636363
8165661,2,B000M1FZFW,"As a fan of the originals, I simply do not care for the newer Poirot movies. It is impossible not to miss the sophistication, humor and charm that existed in the originals. To quote Miss Marple in ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Agathie-Christie-s-Miss-Marple-The-Moving-Finger-At-Bertram-s-Hotel/dp/B000M1LYIY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Agathie Christie's Miss Marple - The Moving Finger / At Bertram's Hotel</a>"" seeing the newer versions is rather like seeing a work of art being destroyed. Some are better than others...""Taken at the Floor"" is not one of them. It's disturbing, dark, and slimy, with a completely twisted, evil antagonist. Poirot himself, as in the other newer adaptions, is no longer quirky and charming; instead he's darker and not particularly interesting or likable. I think the producers thought they were making the series more interesting by adding dark, weird material...instead they did just the opposite. These are now like any other TV show you might see. Do yourself a favor and avoid this.",1486771200,,1061,5.9411764705882355
8165662,5,B000M1FZFW,"Agatha Christie never disappoints. This episode is a fine example. Complex and mysterious, yet it makes sense in the end. Christie is a master of the complex plot that still makes sense. Poirot is the basis for so many problem solving heroes today, but the original is the best.",1410048000,,278,4.6938775510204085
8165663,5,B000M1FZFW,"I'm certain that this TV film episode of the grand series starring David Suchet can be found in at least one of the many collections that have been issued to date. That is probably the most enjoyable choice if you can afford it since it would provide you with the additional pleasure of several other films to enjoy, put away, and enjoy once more some years down the road. I have nothing to say that has not been said in the increasing number of years since the beginning of the this long-lived series. David Suchet continues to give full-blooded life to the character created by Agatha Christie. Whether  working alone, as in this superior short film or with his sometime collaborators, Hastings and the Chief Inspector J., he is entirely at home in the part to which he has added much beyond what Christie wrote. This film contains a particularly nasty brood of characters along with a few very appealing young women.
I will  not provide any details since it is best for the viewer to allow the story to unfold without preconceptions. Rarely has Poirot allowed himself the anger which he manifests in this one; not too often will the puzzler provide such pleasant viewing.",1339891200,2,1174,4.694174757281553
8165664,3,B000M1FZFW,"""Taken at the Flood"", based on Agatha Christie's 1948 novel, is a feature-length film that first aired on Britain's ITV in 2006 as part of Series 10 of ""Agatha Christie's Poirot"". Poirot is invited to the wedding of Lynn Marchmont (Amanda Dogue), who has returned from charitable work in Africa to marry Dowley Cloade (Patrick Baladi). The Cloade family are hard up for money. Wealthy Gordon Cloade died when his Mayfair apartment exploded due to an apparent gas leak. Only his young wife Rosaleen (Eva Birthistle) and her brother David Hunter (Eliot Cowan) survived. Gordon had been benefactor to his family, but Rosaleen, who inherited his fortune, is not so generous. Brother David jealously guards her fortune and won't allow her to help the Cloades. When rumor gets around that Rosaleen's first husband might still be alive, thus invalidating her marriage to Gordon, the relatives want Poirot to find out if it's true.

This is one of Christie's kookier novels. The plot is not very good. Only minor changes have been made to the mystery in adapting it for film, but this was the season that writers began to inject a bizarre religiosity into the Poirot films. Into Poirot himself, actually. He is suddenly very Catholic -though as stern as any Puritan- and even gives the young, insecure Rosaleen a religious lecture. This is distasteful. Eliot Cowan, as the self-destructive, seductive, and hateful David Hunter, steals the show. David is thoroughly obnoxious, abusive, with a violent undercurrent to his personality that might be evil. We don't know. But he is curious, a strong character who keeps the audience wondering what makes him tick. Poirot is just not nice, especially as the film progresses. He's vicious at times. The solution is unsatisfying and comes out of the blue, though I believe it is faithful to the book.",1320451200,,1834,4.993464052287582
8165665,5,B000M1FZFW,"William Shakespeare happily assigns responsibility for greed to both culprits and victims in Much Ado about Nothing when he writes that the fish ""greedily devours the treacherous bait."" But not Hercule Poirot, the Belgian with ever-active grey cells, the world's greatest detective, as he repeatedly reminds us. Poirot loses his cool and fulminates excitingly at the treacherous and insidious greed he sees in this delightful film.  The story develops linearly, captures the viewer's interest early, and holds it firmly. The character actor's, as usual in many British crime films, are quirky and interesting, not the handsome and beautiful people that are portrayed in American tales. They serve us many red herrings, but also some clues that Poirot sees and discloses.

 A blackmailer is killed and the local police request Poirot's help, for he is visiting the area, knows the people involved, and is the famous resolver of crime cases. The plot focuses on whether a certain young woman should inherit a large sum of money from her second husband. The husband's family says, ""No,"" because her marriage to the so-called second husband was invalid because her first husband, who was presumed dead, was not dead at all. This woman has a brother who is controlling her. Viewers will find it interesting to discover why and how he does so.",1319500800,,1337,5.095890410958904
8165666,4,B000M1FZFW,"I've seen most of the movies and single episodes in the Poirot series, and this one stands out as one of the darker and more depraved stories. There's also more of an emphasis on some of the perils of sexuality--giving into seduction, falling under another's charismatic spell and calling it love when it might be manipulation, and on the flip-side, giving up the possibility of real passion for a safe marriage.

All of the trademark Christie tricks are here: a squabbling family with money problems; a love triangle; an inheritance; a dead spouse who may or may not actually be dead; and many red herrings.

This particular episode has some stand-out performances. David Suchet, as always, is masterful, but all the other actors--and especially the actor who plays David--are spot-on as well. Also as usual, the beautiful homes and English countryside add a layer of period authenticity.

When the resolutions come, there are one or two connections that I felt were not clearly shown. That is, one of Poirot's key realizations seems to come out of thin air. But the end is still very satisfying.",1264896000,4,1097,4.918918918918919
