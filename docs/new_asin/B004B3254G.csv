8421324,3,B004B3254G,A welcome addition to the Tchaikovsky repertoire.,1497571200,,49,6.142857142857143
8421325,1,B004B3254G,"There is at present no other dvd of this strange work by Tchaikovsky. This is a video-recording of a provincial operacompany's visit to Moscow during Soviet times. And it shows. There are creases in the scenographic backdrops which somehow diminish the effect.
The direction is old-fashioned and melodramatic though the soloists are not bad. The last two acts are best, but the sound quality and the production do not do this work justice. Why has no other opera house tried to perform The Enchantress?
It would be great if Geriev and the Mariinsky would give it a go.",1433376000,2,568,4.8061224489795915
8421326,2,B004B3254G,"Unless you are a Tschaikovsky opera fanatic this is an opera to skip.  I had no prior exposure to this work.  I found it conceptually uniteresting and hard to get into.  From a production point of view the DVD is fine.  It was recorded live in 1984.  The colors are reasonable; the clarity of images are very good.  The sound was also reasonable.  The staging seems very traditional and fairly static.  I thought that all of the performers sounded fine.  This DVD will go on a shelf with my other 400 opera DVDs, but it is unlikely I will watch it again.",1320537600,5,554,4.352941176470588
8421327,3,B004B3254G,"I bought this DVD for the sentimental reasons only. I was raised in Nizhniy Novgorod, Russia, where this performance was staged and filmed (not in Moscow, as the annotation to the DVD states). I saw this production in this theater with these singers 25 or 30 years ago. And on this DVD I see even familiar faces in the audience at the end.

As for the quality of the performance - I rate is as decent. All main singers are OK, except Prince Yuri - Vadim Balyuta (not ""Valyuta"", as on the DVD cover - ""valyuta"" is a Russian word for ""hard currency""). I'm not sure if it is worth to perform this opera with the first-rate singers in the first-rate theater, because the opera itself is so second-rate. This DVD could be recommended for those who want to have video recordings of as many Tchaikovsky's operas as possible.",1293494400,19,817,4.483221476510067
8421328,3,B004B3254G,"Despite its gorgeously melodious score, The Enchantress (or, as it's more familiarly titled in English, The Sorceress) was a failure when it was first presented & it has never achieved even the marginal popularity one would expect of an opera filled with such beautiful music.

The reason, I think, is that the predominantly sunny, lighthearted score, with its many echoes of Russian folk music, is simply incompatible with the libretto's dramatic material, leaving the audience unprepared for & uncomfortable with the opera's grim denouement, in which 3 of the 4 principals are summarily killed off.

This 1984 performance took place in a small theater, with a small audience, small orchestra & small chorus, on a shallow stage behind which painted cloth backdrops embarrassingly reveal numerous wrinkles & seams. While the soloists & chorus sing well enough & are handsomely costumed in a ""traditional"" staging, they are ill-served by the edgy, ""treble-y"" recorded sound, especially unkind to the female soloists' fortes, which tend to emerge piercingly & painfully distorted.

But though less than ideal, this DVD should at least bring Tchaikovsky's wonderful score to a wider audience. Can we yet hope for a DVD of this opera from the Maryinsky or Bolshoi?  Tchaikovsky's beautiful (if inappropriate) music merits nothing less.",1293494400,21,1331,5.354066985645933
