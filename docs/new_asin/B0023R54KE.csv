This concert is superb not only in terms of the beautiful songwriting, extraordinarily high level of musicianship of Jorge's Band and the talented calibre of his special guests (Dudu Falcao, Jota Maranhao & Sergio Moah) but also in terms of the DVD's sound quality, video quality and presentation. I have no hesitations in giving this DVD 5 stars & highly recommending it to fellow lovers of Brazilian Music.",1354665600,,676,5.035714285714286
