Its really cool, inspiring to the younger Scouts, and they ask questions about what the Scouts are doing. Cool.",1389830400,,318,4.907407407407407

5737488,5,B00CS7PH1K,"It was fun to see the scouts show their skills and the adult wannabes try to show how they could have been Eagles and many failing.  It was nice to see the scouts helping, coaching their adult opponents.",1383436800,,203,4.342105263157895
5737489,4,B00CS7PH1K,"This is a fun show to watch - especially if you are (or have been) in Scouting.  To see how the adults plan for & then execute their plans for the different Challenges is very entertaining.  You just have to laugh at the comments that come out of the adults mouths most of the time.  (Several were fairly out-of-shape to very out-of-shape & would talk like they were still in their prime and how they were going to beat the other adults & the Scouts.)

I just wish that there were a few more shows in the Season.  (There were 6 shows in this Set.  It would have been nice to have 10-12 shows in the Set.)",1380585600,,604,4.119658119658119

8585580,4,B00CS7PH1K,"This series is about men who didn't make it to Eagle rank who are pitting themselves against Boy Scouts to see if they ""are tougher than a boy scout?"" Boy Scouts is all about leadership skills, teamwork, problem solving with adventure thrown in. Really cool stuff.

This is filmed at Camp Whitsett where my boys go to summer camp with their Boy Scout troop so it was neat for them and their friends to see the competitions take place in a familiar place. If you're a Boy Scout, interested in being one, or were one as a kid, this would be particularly fun to watch.

This series is very enjoyable, but I didn't give it 5 stars because I didn't like how the adults nit-pick and found fault in each other's skills/efforts after the day is done. Boy Scouts encourage teamwork and being supportive of one another but I guess they weren't included in the production process. It is pretty much how reality shows are filmed now a days anyway. Why do viewers revel in strife and conflict! It promotes and encourages our children to look for the bad and put fault on other people than look for the positive and encourage one another.

Bottom line. Good series. May not be appropriate for young elementary aged viewers as it displays negative teamwork/relationship skills.",1433030400,6,1262,4.650224215246637

Would like to see another season as the concept would mature.",1393545600,,266,5.209302325581396
