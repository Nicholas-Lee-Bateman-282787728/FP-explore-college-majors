7704672,3,B01D7LMM1S,Kept my interest but I can't say I liked it. It's a way to pass the time. Acting was good. I didn't find the woods spooky at all. Some reviews mentioned that it had some gore. I must have a high tolerance because I never noticed any.,1518307200,,233,3.978723404255319
7704673,4,B01D7LMM1S,"this movie has a good plot and actingis is acceptable.
it is entertaining.",1518220800,,74,4.769230769230769
7704674,4,B01D7LMM1S,"really likes this, but i will never go camping with my family again",1518220800,,67,4.230769230769231
7704675,4,B01D7LMM1S,"Actually quite good...  I tried looking up the budget, but couldn't find it.  I suspect it was quite low...

In any case, I thought most of this flick was done well ( acting, camera work, audio, special effects, etc... )

There is not much in the way of straight up horror in this, although there are a couple of gore scenes which were good.

The story isn't ""entirely"" original, but it was certainly original enough to keep my interest, and the level of suspense throughout the film was high.

The movie essentially becomes more of a psychological thriller with a hint of the supernatural...  But, I don't want to give too much away...

Provided you don't mind subtitles, I'd rate this as a pretty good thriller / horror from the Netherlands and worth a watch...",1518048000,2,763,4.6
7704676,4,B01D7LMM1S,"A bit slow moving but once it got started into the horror genre, it was hard to turn off. I liked it. Clever idea and original foreign fun.",1517961600,,139,4.0
7704677,4,B01D7LMM1S,"Very well acted, good script.  Not scary, more creepy.  Not terribly original but it was so well made that I was engaged the whole time.  Leaps and bounds ahead of all the idiotic American horror films.  Can't even compare.",1517788800,2,223,4.641025641025641
7704678,4,B01D7LMM1S,"That was actually kind of gross, but I think I enjoyed watching.",1517616000,4,64,4.416666666666667
7704679,4,B01D7LMM1S,The acting was good and the plot well done. It really was a horror story...,1517184000,3,75,4.066666666666666
7704680,4,B01D7LMM1S,"Very interesting. Although, it's not a a 'make you jump' horror film, it makes you wonder. Yes, there are questions left unanswered, but I think it adds to the overall mystery of what's going on. I enjoyed it. I can't think of a film to compare it with, sorry.",1517097600,9,260,4.326530612244898
7704681,4,B01D7LMM1S,"A horror film from the Nether-lands...sounds scary in itself. Len (Gijs Scholten van Aschat) and Rob (Bart Klever) have been downsized from their banking jobs. They plan to discuss a new consulting business on vacation where they drag their unwilling families into the woods. Len decides they need to trespass to get to a good spot, one near a mosquito breeding ground, or pool. While at the pool, secrets are revealed, things rot and decay at accelerated speeds and emotions run high as the siren/witch/spirit of the pool doesn't allow anyone to leave unless...

There are a number of films where people are trapped and they always circle around to where they started having to finish a task to leave. This is another one except it has English subtitles. We get a glimpse of the event that happened to cause a curse, although no real explanation was given, it was up to the viewer to figure out. The film has a descent into madness scenes to make things interesting.

Fairy decent horror. 3 1/2 stars

Guide: F-word. No sex or nudity...perhaps that was supposed to be blurred rear nudity in one scene.",1465084800,7,1102,4.729166666666667
7704682,4,B01D7LMM1S,Excellent highly nuanced horror movie that introduces all kinds of new and unique approaches to horror.  I always trust the Netherlands for good movie fare.,1520899200,,156,5.24
7704683,1,B01D7LMM1S,Not the worst of the worst and a fairly simple story line . Nothing to watch here it was very boring . The acting was adequate the father reminded me of a Nazi and during this movie the sons referred to him as one as well. This was unsettling to me that this kind of person still exists in todays society nestled in Amsterdam some place are all the hidden innuendos of a dysfunctional family . There where very few lines and little dialogue and I'm grateful for that because the term adequate I used for acting would have been horrible had they had dialogue . Low budget with not much suspense . We already knew the story line in the beginning it was easy to script it on your own .,1520812800,,682,4.174242424242424
7704684,1,B01D7LMM1S,"I couldn't really get into the movie.  I kind of spot checked through hoping the story might pick up and move at some point.  The drowning scene, where the person was rescued, was not realistic at all.  I almost didn't make it swimming across a lake once, and I know how it isn't.  There was another outstandingly poor spot, but I don't recall what it was, at the moment.  I kind of watched a little, went downstairs for something, etc., etc., didn't watch it straight through.  Skipped a lot of segs.  Not interested in slow plots, and this was boring.",1520640000,,553,4.47

7704687,2,B01D7LMM1S,I truly wish Amazon would label these darn films as subtitled are something. I hate having to read my movies...,1520208000,,111,4.6
7704688,1,B01D7LMM1S,I very seldom don't enjoy any movie just a little bit but this one was going nowhere. Cant talk about the ending as I refused to even watch the last 20 minutes. One of the worst films I have ever watched. If you have a pulse and can move about your time would be better spent elsewhere.,1520035200,,286,4.035087719298246
7704689,3,B01D7LMM1S,"Reasonable production quality, acting and plot. It's a good horror movie to watch to pass time.",1519862400,,95,5.0
7704690,1,B01D7LMM1S,Predictable and disappointing.,1519862400,,30,9.333333333333334
7704691,4,B01D7LMM1S,"I'm with most of the reviewers. Good enough for a four but something didn't quite make it to five stars. If you don't like reading subtitles, this movie is in Dutch, but you can make out what is going on for most of the movie without know one word in Dutch.",1519516800,,257,4.0588235294117645
7704692,4,B01D7LMM1S,I usually don't like reading subtitled foreign films but this one was worth it.  I forgot all about the fact I was reading and was engrossed by the storyline.  The ending was worth the wait.  The acting was very good. I'd like to see an American remake.,1519344000,,253,4.340425531914893

7704695,5,B01D7LMM1S,"Wow, these foreign movies can really take you into a different mind space.  Great for escape into someone elses problems, for a change. I find this film interesting enough to keep me watching until the very end. The character development was great, I cared about how these people would end up. Good flick, all the way around.",1518998400,,325,4.701754385964913
7704696,2,B01D7LMM1S,"I don't mind the sub titles because I am near deaf.
Started out good; nice woodsy location, nice scenery.
However, this movie is simply plain stupid. We tried to stay with it
but the longer we tried the more embarrassed we became for our selves.
Cannot reccommed.",1518739200,,263,4.617021276595745
7704697,3,B01D7LMM1S,"Good story, but lags. Was not very scary. The sense of all being good was too long. last 20 min got something done for the story, however. Not really worth the watch",1518393600,5,165,4.1875
7704698,4,B01D7LMM1S,"**** 3-1/2 Stars ****  A dark and sometimes violent flick from The Netherlands, it's a 'lost in the woods' thriller with supernatural elements that is hard to describe, but engrossing ... it will draw you in if you give it a chance.  There are a gazillion horror flicks that tread the same water, but ""The Pool"" manages to keep its head above most of the rest, with a mix of disturbing family drama, strong acting and good (if mostly dark) cinematography.  But if you need a nice, neat ending tied with a string, skip it ... this ain't your film.  (NOTE:  The Netherlands is a country in Western Europe, about 250 miles NW across the North Sea from London.  Most Americans think there is a country called 'Holland,' but there is not, and never has been - Holland is just a province of The Netherlands, and home to the capital of The Netherlands, the city of Amsterdam.  ... so, Amsterdam is in the province of North Holland, in the country of The Netherlands.  You can now impress family and friends with this little nugget of European geography.  Ciao!",1518393600,20,1053,4.558510638297872
7704699,2,B01D7LMM1S,"Not scary, not thought provoking and not suspenseful. Two stars because of solid production values",1518393600,2,98,5.6

8755151,3,B01D7LMM1S,"Better than average assortment of characters and relationships. Good, ominous atmosphere.",1529020800,,89,7.181818181818182
8755152,3,B01D7LMM1S,"This is a movie that I kept thinking about watching, but I never made the commitment to do so until today. I was pleasantly surprised - it actually was pretty good. A perfectly normal family outing turns into a horror showdown - and the mysterious 'Lady Ghost' cleverly uses both father and son (and pits them against each other) in order to seal everyone's fate. To me it had elements of the tale of the Lorelei; it's something like that, and I was impressed because it had a storyline that showcased both supernatural and 'blood-and-guts' elements. It didn't drag, like some of the other Euro-movies I've seen here. The Netherlands is right next to France, so I was sort of expecting another 'Forest of Demons' disaster but that wasn't the case at all. It wasn't jump-out-of-your-chair scary, but it was spooky, eerie and had just enough suspense to keep me interested. High points for Holland here!",1524873600,,901,4.782051282051282
8755153,1,B01D7LMM1S,"Perhaps there is some European or Dutch folk tale or myth that applies to this movie. I am pretty familiar with European mythology and there isn't anything I can think of that really fits, especially considering the ending (which I will not reveal). This whole movie felt like a pointless exercise designed to 1) gross out the viewer and 2) bore the viewer. I'm sorry I wasted my time on it.",1523750400,,391,4.52112676056338
8755154,4,B01D7LMM1S,"I really enjoyed this film. Not your typical horror movie. The ending is not neatly tied up in a little bow and it makes you think, so if you're not into that kind of thing you might want to skip this one. I thought the story line and acting was great. It was rather refreshing not to see the same old tired story line rehashed for the zillionth time. No, it is not in English. Yes, there are English subtitles. I'm not sure why so many reviews are complaining because it's not in English when the 'Product Description' section tells you exactly what language the film is in. Apparently people don't take the time to look at these things then feel the need to complain about their own error.",1523318400,,691,4.364341085271318
8755155,1,B01D7LMM1S,It started out as a pretty good scary movie. The end makes no sense. The whole movie makes no sense because it is never explained. What a waste of time.,1522627200,,152,4.1
8755156,5,B01D7LMM1S,Loved this movie. I worried the subtitles would throw me off but that wasn't a problem. Outstanding story that totally kicked my ass. Top notch modern horror.,1522540800,,158,4.888888888888889
8755157,4,B01D7LMM1S,Was a truly fascinating film. If you're bored with all the same repackaged movies you will find this flick is worth your time.,1521331200,,126,4.521739130434782
8755158,5,B01D7LMM1S,"I can already hear ignorant whines from foreign film buffs who really aren't connoisseurs at all, just social rejects trying to hide their stupidity through ripping apart decent films.",1521244800,,184,5.379310344827586
8755159,5,B01D7LMM1S,"Finally a well-written horror movie. Suspenseful, creepy and elegantly plotted. You have trouble identifying the point where things spin out of control, a mark of a good story. Also, this movie plays with gender tensions (mostly from the male perspective), without being sexist, which is rare. The gore is well-done and selectively featured. I disagree with other reviewers that there is no satisfying explanation, if one has even a menial understanding of European history, particularly the bog bodies and widespread witchcraft persecution of the middle ages, and medieval folklore about fairies, trolls, bogies, kelpies and sirens, it's not too difficult to put it together.",1521072000,,676,5.509615384615385
