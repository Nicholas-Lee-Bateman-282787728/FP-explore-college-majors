8389251,5,B0035UONCS,"This a great dvd. The picture is great! The sound is fantastic! The Lady is fantastic! There is one thing missing! Whats that you ask? ""Bad Romance"" is missing!!! Get this dvd anyway!",1289174400,,183,4.575757575757576
8389252,1,B0035UONCS,"This disk is a poor quality recording of TV shows, specifically BBC3 and MTV. The video quality is poor and at times the aspect ratio is wrong (wide screen presented in 4x3).

The UPC code on the back is incomplete, and the company who produces this disc cannot be found on Google (there is just one hit on a google search which is a blog posting""",1284163200,4,347,4.257575757575758
8389253,2,B0035UONCS,"Video: 1.5 star
It's 4:3 letterbox, not even an anamorphic widescreen.  The video quality looks like a bad recompression from a BBC broadcast rip.  I have a feeling the original source looks much better.

Audio: 4 stars
The audio sounds much better than the video looks. It has the following surround sound tracks: DTS 5.1 and AC3 5.1.  However I suspect someone might have upmixed a 2.0 track.

Materials.: 4 stars
This is in reference to the Japanese import with the reflective cover, not the black cover with Gaga at the piano.  It is a flat packaging that looks like it can be easily folded to fit into a standard DVD case.  The disc is pressed and not a DVD-R as I had worried it might be before ordering.

Content: 5 stars
The actual concert is awesome.  I just hope you are planning on watching it on a 10"" screen.

Overall: 2 stars
This disc is clearly a bootleg.  Almost every video has the logo of a different television network.  It should be advertised as a bootleg. I expect more from Amazon.",1282953600,4,1005,4.461538461538462

8389258,4,B0035UONCS,"Recently purchased this item. The sound quality and picture are great. The concert features most of her songs from her first album. There is an added mini concert extra with MTV featuring her hit singles and interviews. The DVD also includes all of her music videos released for The Fame, as well as some videos from Katy Perry (including a live performance). If you're a Gaga fan, this is a must buy for your collection.",1271462400,8,421,4.626666666666667
