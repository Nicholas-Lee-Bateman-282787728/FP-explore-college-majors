It's a most extraordinary dark comedy, one of the very best coming from South America in recent years. The incredible story about a young man who is literally invaded in his own house by the parents of his girlfriend is a mere reflection on the political and social moment of Argentina at the time. Great actings, specially  by Ignacio Toselli as the main protagonist, and Oscar Nuez, as the girl's father. The only problem is that, after you see it, you're afraid to see another movie  not equal to this one. It will make you laugh, feel sorry and think. A great, great movie not to be missed. The DVD brings interviews to the actors, the director and deleted scenes, a comfort to all of us who felt the feature was too short.",1247875200,,806,4.4391891891891895
