3724881,1,B001NYSW20,The DVD came clearly used and did not include the trains.  Very disappointing... not at all as advertised.,1282089600,,106,4.888888888888889
3724882,5,B001NYSW20,This is a good Thomas video. I bought if for my nephew and he watches it all the time.,1267833600,,86,3.5789473684210527
3724883,5,B001NYSW20,"Like all the Thomas programs, this one delights the grandchildren endlessly! Interesting stories, characters, music and songs.",1265760000,,126,6.470588235294118
3724884,4,B001NYSW20,"I bought this on Amazon on sale for $8.49.  Definately worth it.  Just a wooden Thomas costs more than that at the store!  This came with a standard blue wooden Thomas the Tank Engine and a silver ""60th anniversary edition"" Percy.  Both are the same exact models as you'd purchase for the wooden track system at the store.  Cool!  The video is your usual Thomas video, our son seems to like it.  We only let him watch videos on long car trips so I confess I haven't seen the video myself, only heard it from the front seat.  He is only 24 months old and gets scared at some parts (such as a dam collapsing) so we have to skip over a lot of the video for now.  Overall pleased with the deal.",1253404800,5,690,4.12781954887218
3724885,2,B001NYSW20,I ordered this because it shows Thomas as the train that comes with the video but I got a different train.  It's the right video and my son likes it - but not Thomas the Train,1241568000,6,175,3.861111111111111
3724886,5,B001NYSW20,"The program is very silly for Adults, but Kids stay glued to the TV watching the narration of wooden trains!  It is very annoying for Adults!",1239062400,,141,4.423076923076923
3724887,2,B001NYSW20,"Haven't watched the DVD yet, Christmas present, but it DOES NOT have a double train as it says in the description.  It is as pictured.  Amazon needs to correct this.",1238371200,2,165,4.466666666666667

3724921,5,B001NYSW20,"I can only watch Thomas the train so many times, but my son LOVES Thomas & Percy. I love that trains are given personalities, it's a cute idea. I just can't watch them for long, but I get it, they're not for me! I like all the unique names of the trains & the different personalities & moods that they illustrate. I think it's important for little ones to learn what their feelings mean. He knows a lot of their names, but Thomas & Percy are his favorites.",1424390400,,456,4.193181818181818

3724944,4,B001NYSW20,Thomas and Friends are back again. Older stories are funny (or corny) in these episodes. He seems to enjoy this collection due to the action and less talk as seen in other Thomas series. My son is almost three and has his certain picks. He always goes back to Thomas for his relaxation time.,1369785600,,291,4.407407407407407
3724945,5,B001NYSW20,"My young son was/is a HUGE Thomas the Tank Engine fan. As he was growing up I purchased many of these VHS Tapes and later DVDs for him to watch. It was my observation that he enjoyed hearing Ringo Star's voice as the narrator above all the others, and so, many videos were watched more repeatedly than others.

They are all fun to watch, with beautiful scenic backgrounds, and beautiful model trains. The voices and scenarios are both fun and educational, and every episode comes with a lesson to be learned in it. This particular video also came with a toy train that fit his collection, and could be used on the same wooden tracks.

While my son is older now - seven and no longer two or three (the pinnacle of his Thomas days), I still get nostalgic seeing these, and will occasionally put one into the DVD player when no one else is around. Great fun for kids and parents alike.",1327968000,6,882,4.404907975460123
