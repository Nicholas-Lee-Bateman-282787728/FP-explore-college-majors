8543675,4,B009PSSRLW,"I like this short, effective workout - but my issue is that it requires a small ball, which is kind of obnoxious. I did buy a pure barre one a while ago so it's not a big deal for me, but if you get this, you will be disappointed when it arrives without the ball BY THE WAY, scammers on Amazon and elsewhere are charging $55 for a pure barre ball? You can get it for $15 on their web site at purebarre.com and even THAT's expensive. There is a promo code for purebarreondeamand if you google it, for 25% off equipment. But I digress. This is a good all-over workout and i think the production quality is good (but not as good as the newer DVDs, especially the Flex and Pure Results and Resistance ones). I would not overspend on this but if you can find it for ~$20, it's worth it.",1505606400,,781,4.111111111111111
8543676,4,B009PSSRLW,"Short 30 minutes lower body and core workout.  Not as good as Physique 57 but good.  You need an inflatable small (6""-8"")ball and a mat.",1466035200,,136,4.4
