2211088,5,B0007D4MC2,"Based on the manga by Nonaka Eiji, the first eight episodes of Cromartie High School, each roughly at 12.5 minutes each, shows the hilarity of this school of ""honest to goodness badas-es"" and delinquents, a place of pencil-eating brutes, guys with pink Mohawks that flap around on their own (Hayashida) rock-star look-alikes (Freddie) who come to school on horses, gorillas, robots who open their head panels and oil themselves with an oil can (Mechazawa), and where the leader of Class 1 is mean and tough, but has the Achilles heel of getting carsick, attend.  And unless you have a fierce nickname, like Hospitalizer of 3, or Fireball of 2, who cares if you're a good fighter?

Takashi Kamiyama is the most ordinary-looking guy around, but he has an advantage in hanging around some of these toughs, such as Hayashida, the blond Maeda, Freddie who doesn't speak a word but there are still shots of him singing into a mike, but he does have his own theme song, a snatch of rock guitar, whenever his cue is on, and others.  Analogically ""let's say there's one rabbit living happily in a pride of lions.  Don't you think that rabbit's one helluva rabbit?"" says Hayashida.  That rabbit of course is Kamiyama.  Takahiro Sakurai (Kamiyama) also voiced Sasame, the Leafe Knight of Sound in the series Pretear.

Mechazawa has some interesting things to say, particularly when his classmates think just because he's a robot, he is good at fixing appliances.  That's simply prejudice and he uses the stereotype of women being no good at machines, but actually they handle cell phones beautifully.  He concludes with:  ""I don't like a digitized world that's a result of people being too dependent on machines.  If there's no heart to heart communication among people, in the end, I think it feels empty.  The way things are going, we'll all be controlled by machines!""  This coming from a robot?  Later, Mechazawa gets sent to an appliance store and ends up being reformatted, much to his friends' chagrin.  Norio Wakamoto, who voices Mechazawa, also voiced the orange cat (Chiyo's dad) in Azumanga Daioh.

Episode 3 is my favourite.  ""A song you unexpectedly heard never leaves your head, but you don't know the title of the song.  That kind of things can happen to anyone.""  Well, it happens to Hayashida, whose Mohawk flies up when he hears a tune being hummed in the bathroom.  He enlists the help of Kamiyama and the others, yet the tune is mishummed as it goes from student to student, which is very funny, ending in a grand recital where everyone hums the correct melody, even the gorilla!

Noboru Yamaguchi, the fierce-looking boss of rival Destrade High School in Episode 4, is another interesting character.  He's dark-skinned, has a big Afro, and is in charge of the bike gang ""Earth Wind Fire and Water,"" so another 70's in-joke there.  Yet Yamaguchi is fond of comedy, albeit a high-level one.  Trouble is, he can't make jokes because he'd lose his standing, and when he gets mad at his crony Ishikawa for making a tasteless joke, his colleagues think he hates comedy!  His particularism to comedy is shown when he is disgusted at the show Pootan, of two guys in plushy suits saying unfunny lines to each other.  ""If I say `stupid' carelessly, they may say it's because I'm old-fashioned.  What an unpleasant era this is, that we can't stay `it's stupid' honestly when it's stupid.""  In other words, PC gone too far.  Yamaguchi tries to analyze Pootan, but gets more flustered as the show gets more confusing.  For his wanting higher and more tasteful standards in comedy, and his dilemma of criticizing shows, I find a kinship with him.  I'm old-fashioned and proud of it!

There are three different end theme songs, which sound like 70's rock.  They are performed by Bikyoran, a Japanese group influenced by King Crimson.  A very funny series with some interesting social commentary and downright surreal visual gags.

2211089,5,B0007D4MC2,"Cromartie High School is just insane.  Whether it borrows from American pop culture (Freddie Mercury, Queen, etc) or Japanese culture, it's probably closer to a higher-class version of South Park than anything else.  Yes, the animation is crude (the ""16 year olds"" look much older to me, almost like Yakuza), but the real strength is in the writing, and the timing is just great.

My favorite character so far is Mechazawa, a ""tin can"" style robot who admits that he isn't good with machines, but others keep asking him to program their VCRs, fix their CD players, etc., but most of them see him as just another student.

Highly recommended.",1115424000,,641,4.8
2211090,5,B0007D4MC2,"Cromartie HS is one of the funniest animes I have seen in ages. Beyond that its more than just sight gags (which are included) but the comedy is genuinly funny which allows for replay value. I have watched the first episode five times and always laugh out loud.

As for the reference below that this is adult material is completely false and I hope Amazon will remove it.

This anime is hilarious. If you want to see one of the best parodies of ""tough guy"" manga, this is it! Great characters, hilarious situations, cool soundtrack. I can't remember the last time I laughed so hard reading a manga. It's pretty weird and sometimes non-sequitor (Freddy mercury, gorilla, and mechazawa are really bizarre). Check out the clip (I prefer the subtitled version, but this dub is not bad) and be prepared to laugh! If you dig the clip you should definitely check out the manga.",1109894400,,610,4.5963302752293576

8046955,5,B0007D4MC2,"Make no mistake - Cromartie High School is nothing like The Matrix.
It is not, in fact, much like anything I have ever seen.
This Anime has it's own (hilarious, IMHO) satire-driven sense of humor that is brilliantly executed, though I will say this:
Whether you are an anime fan or not, watch at least 3-5 episodes before you judge this show - it will take that long to begin getting an understanding of the direction of their humor.",1368748800,,433,4.493670886075949

Cromartie High School has it's roots in Yanki (Delinquent) manga that was VERY prevalent in the 80's and early 90's. The best examples are Sakigake!! Otokojuku (yet another parody of the genre like Cromartie) and the Taito video game series Kunio-kun (localized in the US Renegade, River City Ransom, Super Dodgeball, Crash N' The Boyz Street Challenge, and Nintendo World Cup). It stars a bright young man named Takashi who is out to prove to himself that he can excel in even the worst of environments. He sets out to improve the school by bettering the roughnecks who inhabit it, usually ending in hijinks. Among the more recognizable members of the student body are Freddie, a mute 30 some odd year old man who is for whatever reason still in High School, Gorilla (I don't think this bares any need for explaination), and Mechazawa, the most ""normal"" student a teacher could ask for.

The series is very well written and is indescribably hilarious, especially for someone who actually went to a delinquent school himself.",1355184000,,1264,4.874418604651162

8046958,4,B0007D4MC2,"UNIQUE!  My goodness, have I waited for a unique anime to come my way for many years.  And it's finally here!

  ""Cromartie High School"" is an anime that aired on television back in 2003 in Japan under the name ""Sakikage! Cromartie High"" and is based on a Kodansha Manga Award winning manga series by Eiji Nonaka.

  Basically, a gag manga serialized in the weekly Shounen Magazine, the manga series has won many fans for it's over-the-top, bizarre humor and is planned to make its way into the U.S. on March 2nd, two weeks before the anime DVD release by ADV Films.

  I had the opportunity to watch four episodes (each episode is 12 minutes long) and I was just amazed and awed by the story line because it's bizarre, and I mean that in a good way!

  ""Cromartie High School"" is about a school which consists of the roughest, dumbest and bizarre students around.

  Among these students is Takashi Kamiyama, who seems to be a student out of place in Cromartie High School.

  A honors student through Junior High School, he was placed in Cromartie High School for some reason.

  He adapts to the lifestyle of students around the school and writes about his adventures to his mother constantly but what makes him fit in at Cromartie High School that the other students fear about him is the unknown.  Why is a normal person attending Cromartie High School?

  The first episode introduces several of the key characters of Cromartie High (which includes the roughest students such as a student who likes to eat pencils, a student that most of the school can't figure out that he's a robot and a student who looks similar to Queen's Freddie Mercury and is given the nickname Freddie) and how Takashi fits in with the crowd.

  The second episode features Cromartie High School's most unusual but the student  that Cromartie's students look up to the most, Mechazawa.

  A robot that students think is an unusual/special human being.

  Takashi and friend Shinjirou Hayashida (who sports a purple mohawk) wonder if people will ever ask him if he's a robot but it appears that no one has figured that out yet.

  These are just two examples of the zany story lines of ""Cromartie High School"" and they get even better and more bizarre in future episodes.

  The animation is well done and switches to a manga style look to cool anime style that I find enjoyable.

  The English voice dubbing for the characters of ""Cromartie High School"" was exceptionally well done.

  Cromartie High School is definitely a winner!

  With it's bizarre humor and unusual characters, I can't say enough that this is an anime that you should not miss!  Also, a manga series that you should not miss.

  So, if you want something different from what is out there, definitely give ""Cromartie High School"" a try.",1218585600,,2788,4.69375
8046959,4,B0007D4MC2,"I am a fan of any anime with funny outtakes or just a funny storyline!  I believe Cromartie High School is that one series!

Cromartie High School is a school for bruisers, delinquents and...robots?  Takashi Kamiyama is transferred into a high school and he doesn't fit in, until he is deemed the toughest kid in his class!  Now he must team up with a cast of idiots to do even the simplest of jobs!  Full of slap-stick, half-naked Mounties, gorillas, and different characters, much like FLCL, this is the most upcoming and, soon to be, most popular comedy series!

The DVD contains 8 full length episodes in both English and in Japanese with subtitles.  The only down part is that the extras are lacking!  Besides the usual previews, and text-less opening and closing, the extras have nothing much to really watch.  They have a comment/ cultural notes of the series, Japanese warnings about the show and that's it!  The reason I like comedy style anime is because of the extras but that is the only problem with this DVD.  But besides that it is a must buy!!!

Cromartie High School DVD #1 gets 4 stars out of 5.

My name is Amone.  Adios!",1185926400,,1140,4.551724137931035
8046960,5,B0007D4MC2,"Its seems like forever since an anime made me laugh like this.

8 episodes of laugh-out-loud nonsense and stupidy. Nonsense and stupidity the likes of which that DOESNT insult ones intelligence. Its a brilliant show, but the show it self doesnt know that. Which just makes it even more great.

From Freddie Mercury, to a robot that doesnt know hes a robot, to giant gorillas...and a bald headed gang leader who gets motion sickeness and another gangleader with an afro, who secretly wants to be a comedian.

This volume i think just scratches the tip of the ice berg.

 I was introduced to this series by the manga..it was funny and i couldn't help but wonder how it would be if they had an anime of the series.

And this anime reaches past my expectations. It is even more fun than the manga.

The english dub of this is just great, in the sense that the voices are just hilarious for certain people...such as the bald lead tough guy of the school, who gets motion sickness....ya....youll have to figure out why that is for yourself and watch this show!

One of the cool things about this anime, is that the main character, Kamiyama, will refer the viewer to reading the manga, if they wanna know certain details of something....such as what he did in the past that made him the ""toughest"" guy ever.

On a side note, i must say, that i admire Freddie Mercury's music IMMENSLY ( he is my absolute all time favorite singer, the reason i love singing today, in fact. ) And it was outragously hilarious and at the same time a real honor to seem him parodied in this worthy anime comedy.

From some episode titles, even down to the volumes cover design, i found comical humages to Queen and their legendary singer...Mr. Freddie Mercury.

I got this anime for just over $5! and it was in brand new condition. At the mall, this dvd is selling for $30....no, you didn't read that wrong. 30 bucks!!! and on Amazon, i got it for 5 bucks and it was in PERFECT shape!!!!

*BOOM BOOM CLAP^ *BOOM BOOM CLAP*

Cromartie will, Cromartie will

ROCK YOU!

8046961,5,B0007D4MC2,"Sarcastic, witty, but sensible humor.  It's hard to come up with one word to describe this anime.  The anime follows the manga very closely.  The manga has a few things in it which are funny that are not on the DVD version, but the video is just as funny because you really feel that the English dubbing is really these characters themselves.  Unusually, the English dub is much better than the Japanese version, and at least 95% of the people who watch that would agree with that.  So many unexpected characters, thoughts, and reactions come into play, and the combination consistently flows.  This anime even makes fun of anime itself it's so funny!  Even the intro. with a record playing before you begin an episode is cool the way it's setup.

In the first or second episode, there's a surprise of a quick flash of about 5 other characters Kamiyama can look like, and when you see it, you can't stop laughing.  There's another episode where we meet one of Kamiyama's friends, Kokaku, but the difference in animation is so great that you can't help but notice and easily understand why they are so different.  We are also introduced to people's love for the show Geroten and Pooten.

You may be surprised to see the rights that the anime creators obtained to portray those episodes.  And of course everyone loves the robot, Mechazawa, who everyone likes to assume can fix electronics.  Or the 400 pound gorilla and Freddie who never say a word, but are placed at all the right moments.  There's also Yutaka Takenouchi who is really strong, but is prone to motion sickness.  You see how the characters' strengths and weaknesses play throughout the series.

This comedy is so good I'd even recommend it to non-comedy fans it is that funny.  And I don't normally say that, plus I'm usually not big on too much comedy.  A breakthrough that you can't miss and is worth every millipenny!",1145491200,,1884,4.674772036474164
8046962,4,B0007D4MC2,"Had no clue what was going to happen before I saw this aside form the description on the box. This is not everyone's cup of tea but I enjoyed it immensely. Think of ""Space Ghost Coast to Coast"" mixed with ""Fooly Cooly"". The whole production is very cheap, not as cheap as the average Adult Swim offerning but cheap enough. The character actually complain about it enough! Lots of strange animation. Lots of japanese humor that you'll need to research the extras to understand. Each episode last 10 minutes and essentially nothing happens. I like seeing the gang trying to get around the fight cab.",1133481600,,597,4.695238095238095
