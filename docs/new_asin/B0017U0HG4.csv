8267293,5,B0017U0HG4,"My husband and I just viewed the DVD last night and, as always, we were thrilled with the performance of this very talented lady.  My favorites on this musical DVD are: HE'S BEEN FAITHFUL, IN THE PRESENCE OF JEHOVAH, & I AM NOT ASHAMED OF THE GOSPEL.  She takes time between songs to offer encouragement.  She tells some things about her own life and adds humor, as well.  I will be buying some more of these for family members because of the quality, the content, and the testimony.",1238457600,,483,4.454545454545454
