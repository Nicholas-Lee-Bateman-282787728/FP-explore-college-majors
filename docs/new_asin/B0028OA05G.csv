8356478,5,B0028OA05G,Pierce was a real bad ask in this movie.  I have watched it many times and show it to all of  my friends so they can see Mr Brosnan  before he was in his famous Bond roll.  Filmed in Ireland and the supporting cast are great characters.  I liked it because it cold be possibility that this happened it is believeable.  Well worth the purchase.,1413763200,,343,4.2
