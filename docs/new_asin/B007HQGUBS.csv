5087197,5,B007HQGUBS,"Explore Meteor Crater and Petrified Forest DVD and study guide

Awesome Science Explore Meteor Crater and Petrified Forest is episode 3 in the series. Noah Justice takes us to Arizona to explore Meteor Crater and Petrified Forest National Park.

Noah helps kids and adults like understand the Biblical view of how flood affected our planet and not evolutionary views of Meteor Crater, dinosaur extinction, and the Petrified Forest. Noah will show you scriptures to back it all up. Noah will show you that the Bible is the final authority on the history of the world.

 The video is 30 minutes long. Noah is fun, energetic and his enthusiastic is contagious. Noah makes the learning fun. The scenery makes you want to pack up your bags and head out to the parks. Your kids will absolutely love it. Mom and Dad will love it just as much!

 Come and join Noah as he tours many of the world's most famous geological sites and shows how their origins line up perfectly with the biblical account of the flood and also with a young earth creationist worldview.

 Noah will share with you how:

Millions of acres of petrified forests were created during the Flood
A large meteor is not responsible for killing off the dinosaurs
Meteor Crater was instrumental in recognizing other craters around the world.

I was given the study guide to look through and review. I would say this is more suited for older kids/teens. I also feel that you can adjust it easily enough for younger kids without too much hassle. The study guide that accompanies the DVD includes word lists, key concepts, Fill in the blank section, true and false section, and a Biblical study guide and much more. The questions are centered on the movie and the guide is well thought out and a good companion for the DVD series.

  My only complaint is the size of the book. As a homeschooler with many books I would have loved to see a larger book so it doesn't get lost in my books or I would love for it to fit inside the video DVD case. That is minor complaint compared to the quality of this production. That's just what happens when you have books all over your house. The DVD is $14.99 and the Study Guide $3.99.

 In addition there are currently others in the series including, Explore Yellowstone, Explore Yosemite and Zion National Parks, Explore Mt. St. Helen's, Explore the Grand Canyon, and Explore John Day Fossil Beds.

I look forward to see the rest in this series.

5087198,4,B007HQGUBS,"The kids and I sat down on the couch and snuggled around the laptop to watch episode three in the Awesome Science series. We had previously watched episode one, Explore the Grand Canyon, and enjoyed it a lot. We thought there was some repetition in this DVD with the first one because the Grand Canyon is close to the Meteor Crater and Petrified Forest National Park both of Arizona. Otherwise, the DVD had a lot of interesting information and made a lot of sense. I think it did a great job of explaining the difference with involving the Bible's history of the world and only accepting what science finds. Putting the two together, to me, makes the most sense.

Noah Justice is a great host and has a charismatic personality in front of the camera. He is a lot of fun to watch.

My kids are 12 and 10 and were able to absorb a lot of the information this video showed. Probably, teenagers would be able to understand all of it with ease. There is a study guide that is also available that could easily be incorporated into a homeschooling environment for review or even testing possibilities.

Definitely an engaging and informative DVD that holds lot of answers to some of science's biggest questions.

Master Books sent me the above DVD for review purposes. It will allow me to keep the DVD. I have no other connection to and have received no other compensation from Master Books.",1343174400,,1384,4.568548387096774
5087199,3,B007HQGUBS,"Episode 3(30 minutes long) of the Awesome Science DVD series will take your children on a visit to Arizona to check out the Petrified Forest and the Meteor Crater.  As in the previous videos Noah explains the conflict between an old Earth and young Earth philosophy.  He uses evidence from the Petrified Forest to support a young Earth view of creation and a world-wide flood.  The video is a collection of footage, photos and art work with Noah speaking to you about what you are viewing.

I think this video would make a good overview of the Meteor Crater and Petrified Forest before a visit or just to learn how they fit into a Biblical worldview.  My children enjoyed watching it and learned more about the flood and creation.

I received a free copy of this DVD from Master Books in order to write this review and have shared my honest opinion.",1343088000,,849,4.552631578947368
5087200,2,B007HQGUBS,"The Awesome Science DVD Series is designed to give young Christians a biblical view of science. This particular episode is intended to explore meteors, craters, and petrified forests. Unfortunately, I felt that the DVD offered a very narrow and someone biased explanation of science.

I watched this with my 1st grader, and while the series is intended for older kids, my son still enjoyed it. The graphics are great and the presentation is easy-to-understand. My problem with the DVD is that I felt it focused more on Christians vs. Scientists, rather than explaining how things work.

The first 20 minutes of the film focus solely on the idea that the world is 6,000 years old. While I understand and am familiar with young earth theology, I also think it's important to remember that not everyone - not even all Christians - believe that the earth is young. You can accept the idea that the earth may be millions of years old without believing that humans evolved from monkeys.

If you're looking for a curriculum for your home schooled child that only offers a conservative Christian perspective on science, you may really enjoy this. While I'm a Christian and I do home school my children,  I really want to show them both perspectives (young earth AND old earth) and let them decide for themselves.

When it comes to science, I don't believe that it's ""Us VS Them."" You can explain science to your child in a way that is interesting, fun, and biblical, but can also show your child that we don't have all the answers. Christians and scientists alike both have things we don't fully understand or comprehend, and that's okay. The biggest concern I have with letting my child watch this type of video is that he'll develop a negative opinion of scientists in general or in people who are Christians but who may have a different opinion on something. Instead of focusing on meteors, I felt that this video just focused on the differences between Christians and ""the rest of the world.""",1342828800,2,1988,4.767441860465116
8516832,5,B007HQGUBS,"This is the 3rd episode in the Awesome Science DVD series with Noah Justice. This episode explores Meteor Crater and the Petrified Forest. You are taken directly to these locations by Noah. Noah compares what evolutionist think compared to what Creationist think. He uses the Bible to back up the facts and disclaim what evolutionist think, this information is given in simple terms so that children can understand. He explains in detail about how the Petrified Forest was caused by the flood and uses a well known landmark to prove how this happened. He talks a little about sedimentary layers. The only part that might be of some concern for some parents is at the end of the video he uses a gun to shot a bullet into the ground to show the effects of a meteor (please note, his grandfather was there to supervise and it was noted that you shouldn't do this ever). I would say about the first 20 minutes or so focuses on the Petrified Forest, the rest of the video talks about meteors and craters. We love these videos and can't wait to enjoy more of them and add them to our homeschool library. As with the other videos in this series there are study guides that you can purchase to go along with the video. I highly recommend them, it helps to solidify what your child is learning in this series of videos and gives you so much more information.

8516833,5,B007HQGUBS,"My family and I have watched this video several times and we have enjoyed it each time.

It is amazing to me that evolution can still be believed after all the evidence that has been shown against it.  This is a video that should be shown in all science classes.  People need to learn about some of the other viewpoints and theories.  I have always known there was more to Noah's Flood and it can be proven with the Mount St. Helen's eruption.

I recommend that all homeschooling families and other people who want to learn about science from a creationist point-of-view.  Pick up a copy today!

8516834,5,B007HQGUBS,"This dvd series would make a wonderful summer program for your Sunday School class.  We are enjoying them at home -- my kids and I -- as a part of our Science curriculum.  I love the fact that this series supports and backs up a Young Earth Creationist worldview and gives evidence of Noah's Floods in many of our amazing National Parks in the United States.

I thought this third video in the series was much less sarcastic then the first, and the excessive music issue was also fixed.  Even my eleven-year-old was impressed by the subtle improvements we saw and actually enjoyed this dvd more then the others.  I was watching it tonight for a refresher to write this review and he did not want to turn it off when I had to go pick up my daughter mid-way through.

If you hold to a Young Earth point of view and creationist worldview, and want to pass that on to your children, this is a fantastic video (and series) to have on your shelf.  We will definitely be purchasing more of these DVDs.",1354924800,,994,4.369565217391305
8516835,4,B007HQGUBS,"Several  months ago, I reviewed two DVDs in the Awesome Science with Noah Justice series and we enjoyed them.  They are informative, fun, and full of relevant biblical insights showing how the Bible can line up perfectly well with science.  If you believe in a young earth as opposed to and old earth, millions of years in the making, then this series is for you!

In the third installment of the first season, Noah Justice, son of Kyle Justice (who has worked for National Geographic, ESPN, and The Outdoors Channel) leads us through the Meteor Crater and the Petrified Forest in Arizona.  Did the meteor really cause the extinction of the dinosaurs?  Did it really take millions of years for all those trees to fossilize?  What does Noah's flood have to do with it all?

Using Scripture first, scientific evidence second, this thirty minute episode breaks down into easily understandable terms how both of these events can be explained without using the  ""millions of years"" time table.  We don't have to compromise the Bible in order to view our world!  This is a great add on to your science studies and a springboard for family discussion about your own personal beliefs on the topic of the age of the earth.

The scenery in this video is just as amazing as the previous two and scripture references are frequently posted across the screen when applicable so that you can take notes and go search your Bible after viewing. There is a study guides available for purchase if you would like to expand the use of the video in your homeschool.",1351036800,,1543,4.695167286245353
8516836,5,B007HQGUBS,"Our children aren't the only ones who love the Awesome Science DVDs that Noah Justice hosts.  We already have 2 of them and were excited to receive the 3rd and most recent edition, ""Explore Meteor Crater and Petrified Forest"" for review.  It sure didn't disappoint; we all enjoyed this 30-minute episode.

I really didn't know much about the petrified forest or meteor craters before watching this program.  We plan to look for more books and photos of these areas.  The videography of this DVD is excellent (as all the Awesome Science DVDs are).  However, half an hour goes by too quickly!

More than just photos and the typical information regurgitated in evolutionary science texts, this DVD gives scientific evidences based on a Biblical history.

In addition to this great DVD, there is an individual study guide available, allowing you to test your/your child(ren)'s knowledge regarding what they just viewed.  There are true/false questions, fill-in-the-blank questions, and ""facts"".  I like that this is all laid out in writing as it is easier to go back to details on paper vs in a video.  Using the menu options on the DVD, you could easily adapt this for homeschooling; select which topic you want to watch and then continue with the study guide based on said topic.

I can't recommend these DVDs enough!  Just tonight, I noticed that there are 3 new DVDs set to be released toward the end of October; can't wait to watch them with our family!",1349395200,,1454,4.838056680161944
8516837,5,B007HQGUBS,"Explore Meteor Crater & Petrified Forest with Noah Justice DVD Review!
""Petrified Forest National Park is a testament to the destruction of the earth and God's judgement against sin in Genesis 6.  There is evidence for quick burial of trees, global flood action, and large-scale volcanic activity both under water and after the Flood.""

I was drawn to this particular DVD because I do not know much about Meteor Crater National Park and was curious to know the evidence presented in support of a Worldwide Flood.  My geologic-loving mind was thrilled with this presentation and joyfully watched it several times just to take in the sights of these two parks.

Join 14 year old, homeschooled, Noah Justice in Explore Meteor Crater and Petrified Forest which takes you through the evidence  supporting and defending a Biblical worldview of a worldwide, catastrophic flood.  Some of these evidences include:  Painted Desert as a remnant lake bed, overview of the creation of Southwestern area, Volcanic flows of basalt, Jaspar Forest, Teepees, and more.

A study guide to the DVD is also available.  It's a great tool that has general knowledge about the two parks, The Grand Staircase, deposition & erosion, fossils and Shoemaker's Theory just to name a few topics.

The Awesome Science Series is one that should be in every home library.  All ages will benefit from the explanations, illustrations and spectacular scenery within these DVDs.

I'm so glad I had the opportunity to view another quality product from Awesome Science and Master Books.  I now have a new appreciation for these two national parks!

8516838,4,B007HQGUBS,"A while back I was able to watch and review Explore Yellowstone and Explore the Grand Canyon from the Awesome Science series.  I enjoyed them, so I was excited to be able to watch the third  DVD in this series, Explore Meteor Crater and Petrified Forest!

If you have seen the first two in the series (or read reviews of them), this installment is very much the same.  Noah Justice (the narrator) speaks well, giving the watcher a great amount of information.  There is so much packed into this half hour lesson that I think anyone would have to watch it more than once to soak it all in.

I love that the Awesome Science DVDs start with the basis that the Bible is true and that we view all evidence through the lens of Scripture.  The good news is that the Bible can be trusted to provide us accurate information!  Many times Noah Justice acknowledges and even agrees with the evolutionists conclusions (like that the trees in the petrified forest had to have been violently ripped up from the ground), but he brings them back to the Bible (mostly the flood) for the starting point instead of millions of years ago.

Specifically,  this DVD talks about how the catastrophe of the Biblical flood caused all kinds of amazing things like laying layer after layer of sediment, carving deep canyons in the matter of days, and burying trees and animals as the land re-formed.  I also like how it sites similar aftermaths from Mount Saint Helen as proof that these things could, indeed, have happened in a short amount of time.

I completely recommend adding this DVD to your collection and using it as a supplement to your curriculum.  Because of the great amount of information in this DVD, I don't recommend using it alone.  I would first introduce your child to some of the topics and terms covered, and then use this to learn more and see it all put together.

Happy Discovering!

I received these DVDs from New Leaf Publishing for the purpose of this revie.  I was not required to give a positive review and all opinions are my own.",1346803200,,2033,4.556473829201102
8516839,5,B007HQGUBS,"I had the pleasure of reviewing a new science DVD series called Awesome Science...and the name calls it as it is - it *IS* awesome science! The videos are done by a homeschooling family {YAY!} and the host is a 14-year-old boy who does an exceptional job!

This is our second review of this series and we LOVED this video just as much as we did the previous (Grand Canyon). These are packed full of FACTS supporting Biblical creation and it is done in a way that is easy to understand! With pictures and scenery that is absolutely breathtaking! The videos are recommended for ages 8 - 18 but can easily be watched by younger ages (meaning there is NOTHING inappropriate!). This video actually had a quick gospel message, which we really enjoyed seeing...such a great way to share His word!

The video costs $14.99 and the study guide is $3.99. The video is 30 minutes in length. (Bloopers are provided and always super fun to watch! So take a few extra minutes and enjoy those too!) You can purchase your own copy by clicking HERE.

Overall, I would HIGHLY recommend this video to others - it is an EXCELLENT teaching tool!

Have a wonderfully blessed day!",1344384000,,1156,4.570048309178744
8516840,5,B007HQGUBS,"Are you ready for more Awesome Science??? Apple and Speedy sure were! They cheered and cheered when the package arrived containing Explore Meteor Crater and Petrified Forest with Noah Justice. Now I know everyone isn't quite as ...... enthusiastic about science as those two but as a non-science person myself, I can tell you Noah Justice makes it interesting for everyone!

Episode 3 comes with all new information and Biblical background. I really like the menu and chapter option on this disc. It's made it so easy for us to break the DVD down into bite size lessons just perfect for daily homeschooling. Again we got the extra study guide to reinforce those new lessons. Are your kids interested in dinosaurs? Volcanoes? 750 feet deep craters? It's all in this Awesome Science DVD and it's all brought to  them by a kid just like them. Noah Justice is a young teen that presents the info to the viewers in a graphic, imaginative way. My children are always so excited to view scientific information based on Biblical history. They love when Noah links current ""phenomenons"" to the Great Flood and volcanic eruption.

We can't wait for more episodes to be released. These DVDs and Study Guides are perfect for homeschool, special church groups, or kids that just need a Biblical perspective on science. The DVD is 30 minutes long and the Study Guide has 36 pages. Kyle Justice produced this work.

8516841,5,B007HQGUBS,"Description: How do meteors, craters and the petrified forest back up the Biblical Worldwide Flood? Join 14 year old Noah Justice in this 30 minute DVD as he explores meteors, craters and the petrified forest and shows how they are evidence to a biblical worldwide flood. Beautiful video footage of the Petrified Forest National Park, Tepee formations, and a meteor crater in Arizona; along with other historical picture documentations of studies done on craters make this DVD visually stimulating. A well written and given presentation by Noah Justice appeals to young and old alike.
My Opinion: I absolutely loved the whole biblical application and use of scriptures throughout the video. A short presentation of salvation was also included. I would recommend this video for Middle Schoolers and up(alot of the scientific terminology and explanations would probably be a tad boring for the younger set). Overall, a wonderful presentation of scientific facts for the proof of Noah's Flood. I look forward to watching more awesome science videos in the future.
My Kids Opinion(12 year old): I liked this video and learn many things I never knew about petrified wood and craters. My favorite thing was when I learned about the only man buried on the moon(watch the video to find out if you don't know who I am referring to). Noah was a great host and the added blooper reel was hilarious. It helped me alot with being able to defend my belief and the truth of the flood in the Bible.
Summary: A wonderful addition to any homeschool or Christian school science curriculum. Make sure to get the Study guide along with the video(full of review questions and activities).",1343865600,,1666,4.974910394265233
