8415475,4,B0043X1FFO,"The filming is well done not too much cutting, maybe a bit too much movement on some shots.
The clarity visually is strong.  The recording of the music itself is almost great.
The instruments pick up well.  The vocals are a touch boxy but not much.
Joe Strummer Tribute Concert: Cast a Long Shadow
This is a film of a various bands covering Clash and other Strummer songs one evening in 2007.
A trio with Mike Watt.  Classic ernest Watt style, tough bass and enthusiasm to spare even half gray haired-
2. 1977 [1:48]
3. Hate and War [2:05]
4. Career Opportunities [2:14]
David Jay - I assume he's the vocalist.  He's got a chello and guitar behind him.
Fairly poetic presentation.
5. Death Is a Star [3:53]
With them and an additional acoustic guitarist, Zander Schloss
6. Sleepwalk [5:08]
La Plebe - a rock band with 2 horns.  Like something you might find on Rancid's label:
7. Revolution Rock [2:29]  Nice to hear this song done like modern U.S. somewhat punkish band with a trombone and a trumpet
8. Washington Bullets [3:29] I gotta admit I'm sorta getting that edgy feeling when I go to a show with ernest true playing bands
  and in this case with the spirit of Joe pretty clearly evident, the bands honoring his musical legacy
  by banging out his songs with the spit and grit that he did.
9. Rudie Can't Fail [2:12] Ok, by now this third Clash song done with 2 horns and with energy from the rest of the band and a bit faster
  than the Clash did the songs is gettin' me kinda pumped.  Nice.
  The guy who wrote about Joe, Chris Salewicz does a few brief readings from his book about Joe.
Melodee Fernandez with classical guitar version and classic female Spanish vocal version of:
10. Spanish Bombs [2:26]  Not bad really.  Pretty great hearing a Clash song done in classic Spanish style.
There's no wasted time as the bands change from one band to another.  A guy points out that most of Joe's song writing was done
in 'the Wilderness Years' period after the Clash.  Flea with a cool classic hat does a bit of horn work and other guys are introduced as
people who made music with Strummer. Done with like an 8 to 9 member group with violin and latin percussion.
11. Filibustero [2:43]
There's a guy who looks like a young Allen Ginsburg and sounds, with your eyes closed, like the brother of Joe might sound like.
It's nice tyo see Flea in a very humble, with shirt on, bit of horn contribution to this song.
This month I purchased 2 B.A.D. cds and the Lost Poets.  Along with this it really reminds me of what Lennon and McCartny sound like
apart.  You can hear the part they each contributed separately to their great respective band and how, solo, none of the 4 is as strong
as the two pairs of songwriters were together.  Nice but, particularly for Strummer and Mick Jones, not all that strong on their own if you ask my ears.
It is sweet to really sense Strummer's presence by the performing of his songs.
12. The Unknown Immortal [3:42]
This is the same group, I guess each group does 3 songs on this DVD and the band is joined by a guy on harmonica that sounds to me very Dylan harmonica like.
13. Tennessee Rain [2:34]
The recorded sound of the vocals seem to mysteriously improve as the show goes on.  These songs make me not want to buy non Clash Strummer albums.
They're not horrid.  I finally listened to 4 samples of songs with Strummer with the Latino Rockabilly War.  Not dared bad.  Great name!
This 8 to 9 person group does the next 3 songs too.
14. Tropic of No Return [4:27]
15. Gangsterville [3:14]
16. Trash City [2:46]
Love and Rockets do a faithful version of this song.  So faithful I'm not sure I hear hardly any deviation.  Great song.
17. Should I Stay Or Should I Go [2:59]

They said this is done for Strummerville as a benefit that gets kids who can't afford it into doin' music
and there were other such concerts around the world that same day also doing their own benefit for it.
I have about 5 Clash tribute cds by various groups and most of them rule.
Great to hear people covering classic Clash songs.  Price is right. Not bad atall.  God bless ya mongrels-",1359763200,3,4103,4.4090305444887115
