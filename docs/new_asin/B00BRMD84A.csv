8573154,3,B00BRMD84A,"Tintorera is a weird mashup of Mexican style sex comedies, Andy Sidaris films, Jaws, and Jules and Jim by Francois Truffaut. It's quite the mash up. I think a lot of the movie was built around the need for naked girls and shark attacks along with whatever stock footage was available.

The basic plot is that there are 2 guys. One is a gigolo and the other is a ship captain and they both like the same girls. It leads to shark hunting and romantic drama. Totally kidding, it just leads to shark hunting and lots of nudity. If someone comes on screen, you better bet they only swim in the nude. It's funny in a sense and I'm sure nobody involved in making this movie minds anyone getting a laugh off of it as long as you realize they look good. Thankfully, no one in this movie is a scary looking person naked.

I can't say this is a good movie. In fact, if you didn't know better, you'd think it a was a joke that you tell at parties. It does hit the spot when you're in a certain mood. It's tasteless, offensive, goofy, oblivious to it's homoerotic content, violent, sleazy and illogical but in a lot of ways charmingly so. It's like your drunk friend that wants you to have a good time and doesn't have the best manners. You can't show this to everyone but the people you can will get it.",1485129600,3,1291,4.2439024390243905
