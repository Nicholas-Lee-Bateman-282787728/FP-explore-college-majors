1507412,4,B00005JMPT,"RON HOWARD'S BETTER FILM TO DATE.  GREAT ACTING BY THE ENTIRE CAST. THE SCRIPT WAS VERY INSIGHTFUL.  REGARDING OTHER COMMENTS I HAVE SEEN ON THIS FILM, THE MOVIE IS ONLY SHOWING A SMALL, VERY SMALL KIND OF AMERICAN INDIANS., IT IS NOT MEANT TO REPRESENT ALL AMERICAN NATIVE INDIANS. ONE OF THE YEARS BEST FILMS.",1077062400,3,311,4.636363636363637
1507413,1,B00005JMPT,"All the above things are painfully absent from ""The missing"" but I'll start with the most significant misses first:
do we really need yet another western that depicts the ""indians"" as mindless savages inflicting all the evil and the poor whites trying to save their dear lives and belongings from them? I thought we were done with this type of trash. For some ill alibi there are, yes, a couple of ""good"" indians as well, you know, the ones that are ""good"" because they side up with the whites to go after the bad indians. History excruciatingly butchered and an injustice on celluloid (again) to a people that suffered millions in dead and untold humiliations. Enough already.
  Furthermore, if you somehow manage to ignore this (i couldnt) then you gotta deal with a pathetic script:
white guy who's gone off years ago to live with the indians comes back to find out his wife's dead but his daughter has grown up with daughters of her own. Bad indians step in and kidnap one of the daughters with the intent to sell'm in Mexico led by a ""brujo"" (an indian magician) who -predictably- has to look like a genetic experiment gone horribly wrong. White guy's daughter who hates her father decides to form an alliance with him because he's the only one that can help her track down her daughter's kidnappers. But the gang proves to be a more than formidable opponent especially because of the special powers of the brujo. Ah, not to worry though as there is nothing a mega-sorry ending couldn't fix in a hollywood film: the good guys exterminate the bad indians who in the end get transformed into cheap and mindless opponents and are showered with endless bullets (where did the good guys get so much ammunition????).
  While all this is going on , in the backround there's some seriously horrible sonic torture pretending to be music and also pretending to be indian music. Problem is that indian music doesnt include synthesisers. Someone obviously didn't point this out to the geniuses that worked on the soundtrack.
  Now as for the acting, i have to savor one star here for T.L Jones who is very convincing and which is no news because he usually is. But as for the rest: K.Blanchett, hmm, for a performance full of the typical western female role of crying along and screaming about, sorry no credits for that. This was unmercifully cliche to consider any bravos. The rest of the cast is fulfiling contract obligations: ""say your lines and get outta there"".
  What i really don't understand is what kind of film choices is Jones making if he's making them??? Lately i saw the ""Hunted"" with him and that was a disaster and now this. I mean, this is a majorly talented actor who's been seen in some top-notch cinematic disasters lately. Baffling.
  The western genre is obviously not going to be revived any time soon. Not with miserable attampts like this, that's for sure.
  Unless (for reasons too disturbing to discuss) all of the above does not bother you, avoid this film. We're talking about two through and through wasted hours of your life.",1076889600,15,3051,4.703564727954972
1507414,5,B00005JMPT,"I am of native american origin and some of my family was massacred at Mountain Meadows Utah, in the same year 1857.  I had never really been able to invision the way the people lived until this film.  It was one, with both actors, who have my admiration completely.  I will watch anything that stars either of them. Being a single mother, myself, I can not imagine how you would worry about feeding your children, and when it shows Cate wringing her hands from chopping fire wood, it brought tears to my eyes. It also refreshing to see a movie so realistic to the times with no cussing and the landscape was outstanding.
I would recommend this DVD to anyone who wants to sit on the edge of your seat, and also see human relationships that go on, no matter how much time has passed.",1076371200,9,781,4.372413793103449
1507415,4,B00005JMPT,"This is a good western, based on a book that was a surprise in depth. This is not your pretty, pc western. Although the heroine is strong and determined, she manages to make mistakes that prove costly. Good acting, action, and winter scenes that mirror a cold difficult existence. A bit of surprising theology thrown in for the thoughtful.",1075334400,6,339,4.762711864406779
1507416,1,B00005JMPT,"Ron Howard has borrowed freely from ""The Searchers"",to create a brutal and gory western drama. Tommy Lee Jones stars as Samuel, the long-absent father of frontier healer Maggie (Cate Blanchett). Seeking a reunion, he rides back into her life on the barren plains of New Mexico in 1885. Maggie's teen-angst-ridden daughter is kidnapped by Indians to be sold in Mexico, and Maggie and Samuel set out to bring her back.

This film certainly can create a mood: The frozen desert landscape kept me uncomfortably cold, and the endless cruelty on the part of the Indians was  gut-wrenching - too much so, for me. Jones is outstanding as the man who just didn't want to be married; his expressive face and twangy voice are just right. Cate Blanchett is an odd choice for the erstwhile heroine, but she is also excellent as the tough and unflinching mother. The main baddie is so convincingly and hideously played by Eric Schweig, that I could barely watch when he was on the screen.

I must say the film is well written and directed, but it was way too violent for me to consider it ""entertaining."" If you liked The Searchers, you may like this film, but be warned it earns its R rating with graphic brutality.",1070928000,,1202,4.660377358490566

1507559,5,B00005JMPT,"Excellent picture of frontier life with an accurate and moving insight into the spiritual realities of the Apache Indians.  The Chiricahua culture, while not pictured, is described by the few members of the tribe and the character played by Tommy Lee Jones.  While not a comprehensive review of the spiritual realities of the Apaches it gives insight into a world most of us will really never visit..  While some of the brutality is hard to see, it is not gratuitous--  if anything it underplays the reality of the time.  The major and minor actors play their roles so well it does not feel at all like they are acting but, rather, one is drawn into the story.  For those that complain that it doesn't follow the book that it is based on I would say that that is not usually the purpose of a movie.  The purpose of a movie is to tell a story that one can enter into as either a participant or an observer.  This movie does both.  This movie shows a hard time to live on the frontier--  we can barely imagine it, but those who take pot shots at this movie frankly don't know what they are talking about.  Unless you hate westerns the chance is very good that you will like this movie and be moved by the characters who play the parts exceedingly well.",1492819200,3,1250,4.367965367965368

1507561,3,B00005JMPT,"The Missing is an attempt at a golden age Western. Despite adding good Indians to balance the bad Indians, it still has the same old bad Mexican stereotypes, tries to pass off a mishmash of European sorcery and Hollywood voodoo as Indian magic, and is made even more irritating by having a recycled Braveheart soundtrack. The so-called ""magic"" which is a major issue throughout the film has nothing to do with it's outcome which makes it all sort of pointless.",1492560000,,460,4.7625
1507562,4,B00005JMPT,"Dear Ron Howard:
This movie had a lot going for it, not the least of which was the starring role of beautiful New Mexico.  Camera-work was smooth, allowing the scenery to pop and bedazzle..

The script, however,  lacked emotional  pizzazz.  The plot should have revolved around a husband's betrayal of his frontier wife rather than an errant father's betrayal of his daughter (and her dead mother).

Val Kilmer should have been the romantic lead.  Yeah, Val would have had to lose a few pounds, but you could have made him do it. Val has charisma that enables us to empathize with him despite his sins.

The story could  have gone something like this:  Rancher Val leaves Cate Blanchett and their two kids and  the boredom of desert farming life to follow the  Indian ways. One day, after watching a hawk fly free, he just ups and leaves.  Cate, embittered, struggles  on and consoles herself and her children as best she can.  She has  a decent relationship with the foreman.  Scenes of Val's life with Apaches -- the good, the bad, and the ugly -- alternate with scenes of Cate's hardscrabble existence and their children's grief.

After Val's Apache wife dies in a scene which exposes an unsuspected abyss in the attitudes between the Apaches' worldview and Val's, Val decides to return home.... just in time to rescue Cate from an Indian attack.  As in the movie, she resists his help at first but gradually she is impressed by the ""different"" more responsible person he has become during his absence.  They make emends, as he  helps Cate recover their stolen daughter.  Their youngest child is not a daughter but a son, who is protective of Cate and angry at Val.  In the end Val is able to elicit forgiveness from his son.

The overarching  theme of the movie would be "" the family unit as a  protective, secure unit""  in a hostile world....whether that world is Apache or European.",1491609600,,1888,4.676829268292683

1507640,3,B00005JMPT,"I like Westerns but this one didn't do it for me, despite the fact that I'm a fan of all the stars, especially Tommy Lee Jones.  The acting, locales and cinematography were very good, but it seemed to go on forever.  Endless grit, violence, and hardships without enough quiet or tender moments to break up the pace.  So long, harrowing and unremitting I took little pleasure in its resolution.  This West is a terrible place, fraught with dangers and heartbreak (of course, but nothing was shown to temper it, as in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Jeremiah-Johnson/dp/B0030CSWQO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Jeremiah Johnson</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/A-Man-Called-Horse/dp/B00008CMR5/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">A Man Called Horse</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dances-with-Wolves/dp/B000IZXHO8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dances with Wolves</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Lonesome-Dove/dp/B017I77TQU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Lonesome Dove</a>, etc).  The length exacerbated the problem, IMO judicious editing of about 30 minutes would have greatly improved the film.  Howard could have excised the scenes in town, and those peppered throughout of loathsome white scumbag camp followers who served mostly to demonstrate that white people were bad too.

The only aspect I found mildly intriguing was the juxtaposition of Christian, Native-American and Mexican spirituality.  And ordinarily unresolved family relationships achieving closure is a theme that resonates mightily with me, but Cate Blanchett's character was so impassive and severe, so seemingly immune to Tommy Lee's charms that I took little pleasure in their interactions, or in the ending.

A ""Don't Miss!"" classic for connoisseurs of film, it slowly draws me in and holds me in its spell for the duration. After they pass through the town with it's superficial diversions, it's all about the warrior path... horses and guns, snakes and magic, intent and fate in rugged terrain. A great balance of character development and intense action, if you like your cowboys, cowgirls, and indians facing big challenges, this film delivers!",1485043200,3,724,5.1440677966101696

It lost a lot of the intended religious/spiritual conflict but was still well worth watching. More than once in my case. I'm a huge fan of Tommy Lee Jones and he delivers as always. As did Cate Blanchett. She wasn't just portaying her character. I felt like she became her. Even if you're not a fan of the western genre I think you'll enjoy this movie.

All the references to mysterious backstory are interesting first, then irritating, then exasperating as you wonder what the heck his ""motivation"" actually is. The daughters are strong presences and the movie is bold in displaying some of the Indian savagery which our current crop of politically-correct filmmakers are afraid to show. The bad guy is a REALLY bad guy, one of the most creepy bad guys in recent moviemaking. Certainly one of the creepiest Indian bad guys. The blurb is dishonest; the bad guy DOES NOT have ""shape shifting powers."" Good acting, good casting. The younger daughter is especially impressive, beautiful and totally credible with a powerful presence. And the Indians are individuals, ranging from noble to disgusting.

1509932,2,B00005JMPT,"Not only is this boring heap of junk an insult to Apache indians, but it insults the most credulous of film reviewers. It seems Ron Howard has a one dimensional view of the Apache indian because he portrayed them as theiving, murdering drunks instead of a group of people that was displaced and murdered by the white man. I lived on a New Mexico reservation with the Apache for one year and I learnt that they are very human and have goals and aspirations besides what is erroneously portrayed in the film. This is a standard fare from Hollywood which has a terrible ending and does nothing to even help the viewer understand the purpose of why this film was made. A complete career spiral for Howard, who didn't do anything good to begin with.",1386633600,,744,4.518518518518518

1509934,3,B00005JMPT,"Throughout the film, family relationships are sensitively depicted. In fact, the deft portrayal of family dynamics is the film's strongest suit. Very good acting by all, including the surprise, brief appearance of Val Kilmer as a US army officer. Stunning cinematography and authentic period detail add to the story. However the script seems to be wildly diverging at times, and well, just plain farfetched.  Bizarre, fake seeming spiritual elements are thrown in for shock value. This is the part of the movie I dislike the most.  The ham- handed depiction of Native Americans is questionable, if not downright offensive. Maybe it's just me, but there is something revolting about Tommy Lee Jones in that long hair phony Indian shaman get up. if they are going to go this defamation of a whole people route l will take The Searchers any day..",1378771200,,843,4.971631205673759
1509935,4,B00005JMPT,Saw this movie only recently. I had never heard of it but I was immediately drawn in by the excellent performances of Cate Blanchett and Tommy Lee Jones. Cate must be one of the finest character actors ever. In some ways the plot was reminiscent of the John Ford classic The Searchers as well as the John Wayne version of True Grit. It also had a dash of The Last of the Mohicans. In spite of the mishmash I thoroughly enjoyed it. The nail-biting suspense held it together as did the top notch acting. There was not a weak performance in the entire film.,1378252800,,554,4.336538461538462
1509936,5,B00005JMPT,"Very good film, my husband and I really enjoyed it.  Would recommend it to anyone who likes westerns and Tommy Lee Jones,",1377820800,,121,4.5
1509937,3,B00005JMPT,"The Missing is a film I was hesitant in seeing.  It is not a film I would normally see since I am not really a fan of westerns.  The only western films that I care about are the remake of True Grit and Cowboys and Aliens (I count it as a western).  The old west is not really a time period that I am that interested in.  However, when I saw that this would have Tommy Lee Jones in it I decided to give it a try.  I also like the story, which is not your typical story for a western and neither are the characters.  I saw the film and, to be honest, I found the film a bit weak.  I do not really know who this is for.  This film is not a typical western.  This film does not follow a cowboy or a band of cowboys, but focuses on the Indian side of things.  The main characters are a female and a fake Indian.  The film is also not that action packed, but more of a drama.  The film does not have much for romance either.  Even fans of westerns may be put off by this.  Plus most of the cast is not that interesting.

The Missing is about a woman named Maggie (Cate Blanchett) who lives with her two daughters Dot and Lily.  She also lives with a man named Brake (Aaron Eckhart) who helps support the family.  One night her father, Samuel Jones (Tommy Lee Jones) comes back into her life to offer her money.  Maggie hates her father because he left her a long time ago.  Eventually Brake, Dot, and Lily leave to go to the city and are attacked by rogue Apache Indians and kidnap Lily.  Then Maggie, her father, and the younger daughter, Dot, track the Apache down to get Lily back.

What saves this film from being bad are the two leads.  You have the female lead Maggie (Cate Blanchett) and her father Samuel Jones (Tommy Lee Jones).  Maggie is definitely a tough female lead that you do not see in a lot of westerns.  You also have Tommy Lee Jones playing the father and he is great.  Tommy Lee Jones is great in anything he plays even if the movie is bad.  He is one of my favorite actors and is the best aspect of this film.  I like the father-daughter relationship they have going on.  Most people will not like this, but I like that there is no romance in this film.  There is a little at the beginning with Aaron Eckhart' character, but not much overall.  This film is about Maggie and her father coming to terms with each other, which I personally find more interesting.

The film does have problems.  For one I do not like that Aaron Eckhart's character gets killed so early in the film.  I like Aaron Eckhart as an actor.  I know this was before he was a big name, but I did not care for it.  I thought it was a waste of a talented actor.  Also, the little girl, Dot, I found to be useless.  The film is about the relationship between Maggie and her father.  Dot seemed she was just along for the ride.  She did not contribute much.  The film could have been done without her.

Another problem is that aside from the two leads there are no interesting characters.  The little girl, Dot, was not that interesting.  The other daughter I did not care for either.  I felt like I barely got to know her.  Before she got captured the only thing we know about her is that she does not like the country life and wants to move to the city.  In most of her scenes in the beginning she is just whining.  Aaron Eckhart's character we knew little about.  How did he come to meet with Maggie?  Before we get to know him he dies.  We also come across and Indian and his son who are friends with Maggie's father, who are not interesting either.  We really know nothing about these two.

Also, the villain is rather lame.  He is just a typical bad guy with no depth at all.  He is not interesting at all.  I personally thought that this was going to be more of a mystery story set in the old west.  I thought it would be Maggie and her father trying to find out who kidnapped her daughter and track him down and not show the villain until near the end.  However, it turns out to be just a chase movie and it is not that interesting.

Overall, The Missing is not a film that I would see again soon.  I am not a fan of westerns, but I also just do not like the story or most of the character.  The two main characters are what save the film for me especially Tommy Lee Jones.  I liked the father-daughter relationship going on.",1377648000,,4315,4.120336943441637

1510053,3,B00005JMPT,"First a little about me.  I have always hated The Dukes of Hazard (referencing the inference that if one doesn't like this movie one must be a Dukes of Hazard type).  I love westerns, and wish there were more of them.  Tommy Lee Jones is one of my very favorite actors, and I thought he, Kate Blanchett, and the girl actors were fabulous.  I am a student of Native American culture and love the southwest, New Mexico in particular.  All that said, I was disappointed in the movie.  I thought it was very drawn out, very dark (it likely was meant to be, but that doesn't mean I have to like it).  I enjoyed the melding of Native American mythology but I thought the Brujo was meant to appear very evil but in my opinion came off like a sadistic serial killer I would more likley see on Criminal Minds (which I love by the way), and a buffoon at that.  I thought that was quite disrespectful to Native Americans.  I disliked the focus on blood and gore - I know this is the modern trend but I remain of the opinion that a good movie does not need to focus on that element to be successful.  I don't mean it was the core of the movie, but time was spent viewing these things that would be better spent in action or character development.  I am admittedly somewhat squeemish (as are many women) and could very well do without those parts.  All in all, a decent movie but less than I expected from a director as talented as Mr. Howard.",1357084800,,1430,4.2555555555555555

Maybe the ones that wrote a bad review should stick to action pack movies. I am a big movie fan. I like good actors and good story writers. Opie,I mean Ron Howard did a wonderful job!

I was intrigued by the title and the description but thought I'd be put off by the ""phantom"" villain because I'm not much for ghost stories. However, I was really touched by this film and surprised I hadn't heard anything about it. It turns out not to be about ghosts at all but about a father and daughter's reconciliation and the kidnapping of her daughter by an Indian witch. Most of the movie is their journey to save the daughter. There are some hard to watch scenes of violent deaths. One man was roasted to death. Others were injected with snake poison while others were hacked and smashed with clubs. Not for the faint of heart. The witchcraft part of the movie where the witch was able to put a curse on Cate Blanchett's character voodoo style was odd and even more odd is that they were able to fight against it with more Indian mysticism and Scriptures from the Bible. Without getting caught up in those oddities, I was able to really enjoy this movie. It doesn't all have to make sense to be a very fascinating movie.

I watch movies hoping they will make me feel good about myself and life in general- there is none of that here!

1510117,5,B00005JMPT,"While this film is fiction an is more of a drama set in the 1880's than a classic western as such, Ron Howard is to be commended on his use of the Chiricahua Apache language to give realism to the film. Howard (the director) employed the late Berle Kanseah and also Elbys Hugar (great-granddaughter of Cochise), both from the Mescalero Apache reservation in New Mexico, to teach the Native American actors (as well as Tommy Lee Jones)their lines in the Chiricahua language. This gave realism to the film and is the first time actors who portray Chiricahua Apaches have spoken the language (""Geronimo:an American Legend"" used Western Apache language, which is quite different). Also, the movie was filmed in New Mexico and the scenery is superb.",1318982400,6,744,4.912698412698413

They must catch up with the ragtag band of Indians and white outlaws before they cross the Mexican border, where they will sell the teenager into prostitution This is also a gritty western that makes full use of the New Mexico scenery -- raging rivers, cliffs, wide open land -- and 19th century costuming to set the tone. It's not at all hard to believe this is set sometime in the 1870s or 1880s New Mexico. Cate Blanchett did an amazing job with the accent here and is totally believable as Maggie, a western American woman who's had to survive on her own in the west and resents her father for abandoning her family as a child. Tommy Lee Jones plays the father and is equally good. Young Jenna Boyd plays Maggie's spunky younger daughter Dot, who joins them on the trail, and Evan Rachel Wood plays the spoiled older daughter, Lillie, who has to find unexpected strength when she is kidnapped. I just watched the movie again along with the new version of ""True Grit"" and thought they went well together.

I just think it all could have been done a little better.  It's nothing you haven't seen before.  Kind of like The Searchers done really bad!!!

Generally, I don't like historical 'period' pieces, but this movie, set in the mid-1800's, grabs you by the throat and doesn't let go until its over.

It begins with Blanchette, a prairie doctor, opening the door to her wilderness cabin to find a huge, starving wolf standing on her dining room table. Not a good omen.  And it takes off from there.

For over two blazing hours, I was riveted to my seat, living every minute of Jones and Blanchette's feverish, perilous journey to rescue her daughter, kidnapped by  'hostiles' bent on getting her and other young girls, across the Mexican border, to sell them into slavery and prostitution.

The head slaver was a malevolent, extremely psychic Indian witch, well-connected to the wrong side of the spirit world, killing brutally for entertainment and wearing photos of his victims on his jacket. The depiction of this character was excellent and his command of the black arts combined with psychotic killer made him a worthy adversary for Jones.

Needless to say, the core conflict comes between him and Jones, a wizened badass who gave up the white man's ways to live most of his life with the (good)  tribes, steeped in the culture of mysticism and bravery at all cost.

This movie is very well done, intense, fascinating and violent, with magical elements that give it an unusual edge. The story line has probably been done many times before, but with Ron Howard directing, beautiful music and scenery  and gifted performances from Tommy and Cate, it had a fresh, crackling edge to it that I haven't seen before in this type of genre film.",1301961600,8,1797,4.7243589743589745

This movie is as another reviewer put it is  a Very tense and entertaining movie...... And it is.
Jones Character arrives at a Ranch he says hes in need of some Medical Help from This Frontier woman doctor... who we find out is his daughter  If he is really there to make peace with his estranged daughter  its not really clear
She tells him to leave
Her Eldest Daughter is kidnapped by Apaches
Jones has a lot of experience with Indians
and hes the only one who will help her after she turns to the town sherriff
and the adventure Begins.

My One problem with the movie  Is the constant Fetching she does to her father about what a horrible father he was... Even while the Poor guy was risking his life for her and her daughters.  I don't know maybe Im Nieve but it just seemed so 1990's ish instead of 1880's ish
There were a few Uncomfortable scenes There was a grizzly dead body scene..... and snakes  If Indiana Jones and I have one thing in common its we don't like snakes.....

I had this movie at three stars but raised it to four....Cause I just wasn't sure if I was being fair  The Kate Blanchard Role bothered me that much  She plays this Strong Frontier Woman Yet when she is with her father she becomes a whiny complainer  Maybe because she was a stong frontier woman she felt she could tell her father what she thought.... so I raised it to four stars just in case
But the Snakes cost the movie one star

Directed by Ron Howard, Starring Tommy Lee Jones and Cate Blanchett, the Storyline is well Directed and Acted.  Superb dialogue, utilizing authentic Apache Indian dialogue that help gives the Movie credence. The Movie is essentially about a Medicine Man and his Band of Outlaws who capture young Girls to sell in Mexico for Prostitution/Domestic use.

When Cate Blanchett's daughter and several others get captured by these Outlaws, she eventually turns to her estranged Father, played by Tommy Lee Jones, to track them down. He has become quite familiar with Apache Indian way of life and proves crucial towards finding and freeing their captured state.  There is a strong sub-plot here with regard to their Family life.

1510207,5,B00005JMPT,"I have now seen The Missing four times since its original release. If anything, my estimation of its merits has increased. Cate Blanchett is excellent as the tough frontier rancher woman whose heart remains rent by her father, who abandoned his family to take an Apache wife and live as an Apache. Tommy Lee Jones is equally good as her father, a man who makes an effort to undo the bad he did only because he got bit by a rattlesnake and was ordered by the Indian healer to do right by his family to secure healing. As good as are those two, the main scene stealer is Eric Schweig as the Indian witch leading a gang that steals girls, white and Indian, to sell to Mexicans. He exudes malevolence in each frame, capturing the definitive western horror: the man who lives merely to do evil, the man for whom evil is his life's blood. Also captivating is the performance of Jenna Boyd as Blanchett's younger daughter, the one not captured by the marauders. She gives one of the most natural child performances in the history of Westerns. Her scene being reunited with her half sister is one I will always remember.

The only reason I can think that this film would have been panned or damned with faint praise, much less almost universally so dismissed, is that it upsets the PC apple cart, in which Christians rejecting their own heritage is seen as the height of virtue, in which Indians are seen as peaceful children of nature who only seemed extremely violent because whites entered the Garden of Eden and perverted nature. The Manichean nature of PC cannot allow much complex truth. The difference between the responses to this Ron Howard film by journalists and Hollywood insiders and the responses to Howard's many PC-friendly films is telling to those with eyes to see and ears to hear.",1289433600,,1792,4.635220125786163

It ranks with ""The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford"" as my personal favorites among Westerns of this millennium.  Whereas ""Assassination"" was a startlingly effective postmodern retake on both Jesse and narrative voiceover, ""The Missing"" may be viewed in part as ""The Searchers"" redux.  The central action of both films is the hunt for a girl abducted by Indians, but whereas John Wayne is a virulent Indian-hater, Tommy Lee Jones is a white man ""gone native,"" who uses the skills acquired among Native Americans to hunt down the abductors.  The film is both a very suspenseful action flick and an engrossing character study.  Cate Blanchett, of course, can do anything as an actress--or rather be anything, from Bob Dylan to Galadriel.  For his part, Tommy Lee can convey anything with a twitch of any of the wrinkles he seems to have been born with.

1510214,4,B00005JMPT,"My response to the opening moments of The Missing was surprise that anyone would try to make a Western these days. Definitely out of fashion. Yet, I stayed to see that Ron Howard and the creative staff did a fine job of working within the American frontier myth which has stood American media in good stead for more that 250 years. Despite a few concessions to contemporary political correctness (which, in the case of Native Americans, is called for) this is still Settlers vs. Indians. We should all keep in mind, however, that it is not the real Native Americans nor the real Settlers that have been the subject of these dime novels, live performances (Buffalo Bill and Company), stage productions or films, it is a set of archetypes included in a mythic story much the same as Jupiter, Juno, Mercury and Company were archetypes set in myths thousands of years ago. Not realities, but storied characters, carrying symbolic messages of enduring character for the peoples involved. I'm not much worried over the question as to how this interpretation stands up to the classics;  it is a good version with the strong pioneer woman and the often restless pioneer man standing shoulder to shoulder to quell the forces of Evil, Christian righteousness triumphing over heathen paganism. Cate Blanchett  does a fine job as the Christian healer and mother,  Tommy Lee Jones does a professional, but not quite as convincing,  job as her White Indian father, who deserted his family early in her life. The supporting cast is effective in their more stereotyped roles, save for the child playing the younger daughter,  who does well whatever was asked of her.
My guess is that most will find much with which to be gratified in this latest venture of Ron Howard.",1257897600,,1752,4.846153846153846

It is only at this point that she and her father make alliance to find her missing daughter and save her from being sold into a Mexico where she will be forced into prostitution.

What I liked about the movie is that it is one of the rare western movies where woman has significant influence over course of events.

1510309,5,B00005JMPT,"Leave it to Director Ron Howard to produce a spine-tingling movie that kept me on the edge of my seat...too engrossed to eat the popcorn!

Superb cinematography! Fine casting! Breathtaking scenery! Original plot!

Cate Blanchett is perfect in the role of Maggie Gilkeson, a young woman raising two daughters alone in a barren Southwest wilderness. She scrapes out a living being a respected ""healer,"" with help from her friend Brake (played by Aaron Echhart).

All seems to be going well in the Old West until her estranged father--brilliantly portrayed by Tommy Lee Jones--returns and stirs up bitter memories of his abandoning his family to join a tribe of Indians.

***THE FOLLOWING MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS, BUT OTHER REVIEWERS HAVE ALREADY SPILLED THE BEANS, SO-OOO...***

When Brake and a ranch-hand take the daughters, Lily and Dot, out on the range, a renegade band of escaped Apache scouts kidnaps Lily, shoots the ranch-hand and brutally tortures and kills Brake, then goes on to their next slaughter, kidnapping more young girls.

When Maggie searches for them, she's stunned at the horrific scene. With no sign of her daughters, she's relieved when Dot comes out of hiding, and desperate on learning that Lily was taken by the Indians.

Since law enforcement doesn't have the manpower to help her, and government troops head off in the wrong direction, Maggie turns to her estranged father for help. They learn that this band has been burning homesteads and slaughtering all but the young girls, whom they kidnap to sell in Mexico.

Dot refuses to remain behind, so they reluctantly take her along. This turn of events adds more tension as the trio heads out. What happens as they track the desperadoes is movie excitement at its best. Under the superb directorial skills of Ron Howard, this movie goes from one exciting scene to the next, while the viewer worries whether they will be in time to save Lily and the other unfortunate girls.

Blanchett and Jones are excellent in their roles, while troubled teen Lily (Evan Rachel Wood) and precocious Dot (Jenna Boyd) give convincing performances. Eric Schweig gives a chilling performance as the psychopathic Apache brujo (male witch) leading the Indians.

1510311,5,B00005JMPT,"Initially I was surprised at the time, that a film of this caliber, with a large cast and ""epic"" feel would even make it into the theater. Since modern Westerns don't tend to garner huge box office success, I was happy to see a significant amount of enthusiasm for the film. Though it stretches on in parts, the visual appeal, and the performances of the entire cast lend an authenticity that can't be ignored.

The strong lead in Cate Blanchett's character leads with a confidence that underscores her talent and capility of carrying a film. The film's scenary and ""stillness"" is beautiful and the time period is convincingly recreated.

The film blends mystical, supernatural elements, and creates a touching family drama, with the depth of character development and underlying themes present between Cate and Tommy Lee Jones. As was already remarked Evan Rachel Wood is a rising talent as the oldest daughter and compliments the film well.

The Superbit was tested on a 50"" Panasonic Plasma and a Toshiba XDE 500, with color enhancement. Despite the ""dull"" look of the film given the setting (many dry fauna and quiet scenes), the clarity in the Superbit is a significant improvement over the standard SD, which I've also seen. The DTS sound is incredible, and distills the subtle sounds of the outdoor scenes effectively.

The sound in DTS is crisp and clear; when you hear the sound of a bullet ricochet off a rock, you clearly hear the direction it comes from and then the direction it changes to after striking the rock.  People breathing and the sound of horses are all very full and have a dramatic impact on the film; as do the sounds of the shauman's rattle snakes.

Excellent cast and the children are very believable (not always the case in film}.  One can feel the struggles of the times, the heat and the dryness.  Cate Blanchet projects the fear a woman in her position at the time would feel very well.  She is a versatile actress.  The sadness in Tommy Lee Jones's character comes through so clearly and when he is given the opportunity to help, he grabs the life line.

1510401,3,B00005JMPT,"As good as this film is, it would have been much better without the annoying political correct over-sensitivity to Amerindians. This film asks you to believe that renegade Apache Indians, who in the film murder and sometimes torture parents & guardians of pretty teenage girls in order to kidnap an sell these girls as sex slaves in Mexico, would not also rape these girls along the way to the border. In the better-written and more realistic novel ""The Last Ride"", on which the film is clearly based (though it differs considerably), these Indians did indeed rape and brutally treat these girls. However, in the movie the only attempted rape was by one of the despicable white men helping the Indians.  But it's not enough to have also a bunch of despicable white guys in the movie (including most of the soldiers), it's got to have one of the kidnapping Indians save the girl from rape. Worse: right after this rape rescue the indian tells the girl that she is better than this white scum but ""you are not better than me."" Right. He's part of this vicious girl-kidnapping group of slime-bags but he's better than the victims. Guess we're supposed to think this Indian's got character.  Good grief. There was even some sort of a feeble excuse given for this despicable Apache behavior - someone killed their chief. Oh, well, no wonder they're about kidnapping white girls to sell as sex slaves.

Still, if you can stomach this kind of PC bowing toward Amerindians (who, by the way, did have quite a earned reputation for extreme torture - see for eg. the book ""The Wild Frontier""), the film is darkly entertaining and original, and it does star the super appealing film goddess Cate Blanchett.",1172966400,6,1694,4.755102040816326
1510402,4,B00005JMPT,"This is a lovingly made, well acted movie, worth watching.  However, it suffers from a) not quite deciding which genre to fall into, and b) being too long at over 130 minutes.

There are echoes of `The Searchers' in the plot.. well, I say echoes, but this is virtually what they like to call these days `a reimagining' of the same story.  However the depth of meaning, characters and symbolism from that movie are nowhere near replicated here.

What we do have is a bunch of fine performances by terrific actors, and a degree of authenticity that reminds you what a great director Howard can be.

Blanchett is the mother, whose daughter is abducted to be sold into white slavery, her lover brutally tortured and killed.  The army (with a surprise cameo from Val Kilmer) can not / will not help, so she enlists the help of her estranged father - a man who abandoned her when young, and went native with the Indians.

The chase to find them uncovers that the ringleader is actually a `brujo', an Indian witch, and part of the battle is against the brujo's witchcraft.

Therein lies part of the problem of the movie - as good and as well crafted as it is, it has parts traditional Western, part character study, part horror and part plain old thriller - and they are individually interesting, but put all together drag on a little bit too long to be a successful.

1510405,4,B00005JMPT,"The fire and brimstone of shamanistic revenge impinge on Cate Winslett and her girls in a cosmic cocktail on the Mexican frontier of the 1880s. This is an impressive revisioning of the Western genre, kicking PC's arse in the best of ways, allowing the marauding, villainous indigenes an ample voice in their rebel leader's unsparing hatred of white settlers, including those who wear 'red-face' like Tommy Lee jones. Jones's character is the film's centrepiece and it's one of his finest creations, one seemingly drawing from deep anchorage. The muddling complexity of cross-cultural values constantly unravel through him. Jones is pitted against the shamanic leader while rescuing his daughter, kidnapped and being herded as trade bait with banditos over the border. This leader is an insidious and heinious character, a 'Blood Meridian' type whose visage is as fascinatingly repulsive as his invocations. The great pity of the film is its weepy conclusion. The DVD gives us two alternatives. Either would have been better, but the longer, devoid of sacchrine soundtracking, leaves the audience to surge in gratification for the redemptive protection and self-sacrifice Jones has elicited in his daughter. Instead, a film which save for this turn brilliantly defies cliches, defects to one of the genre's most travelled routes; issues resolved in bullets and music.

It is, as has been said before, a gritty plot infused with a bit of mysticism, so you will need to bring along your imagination and an open mind.

This is a very tense and entertaining movie.  It held my attention throughout however I am an adult who can pay attention and some viewing the movie probably cannot.  It is exceptionally well acted and the cinematography is great.  In short, I give a ""well done"" to Ron Howard and others who made the film",1142467200,73,539,4.515463917525773
1510484,2,B00005JMPT,"It is not a good sign when the DVD's of a recent big budget feature are selling for $1.50.  Although ""The Missing"" is generally regarded as director Ron Howard's weakest film, there are few complaints about his casting or his acting for the camera directing. Most of the criticism is reserved for the film's total lack of unity, as the first half, an excellent example of a realistic frontier western, is totally disconnected from the second half which tries to be a supernatural thriller. You can't have it both ways, even if it were possible to adequately tie the two disparate halves together each has its own completely different target audience.

All this means that those who enjoy the first half will be looking around the room at the halfway point trying to discover where their film went, while those who might have enjoyed the new direction will have turned off the film before the segments that might interest them even make it to the screen. This seems like something the producer should have identified and corrected before a single frame of film was shot.

Tommy Lee plays a white man in 19th century New Mexico who has elected to live as an Indian, insert ""Hombre"" here. In yet another reprise of his character in ""The Fugitive"", he (big surprise) is not big on smiling or on emotional displays of any kind. Cate Blanchett plays his estranged (and widowed) daughter Maggie who lives out on a primitive ranch with her two daughters Lily (Evan Rachel Wood) and Dot (Jenna Boyd-the little girl with the creepy smile in ""Dickie Roberts""). Tommy Lee arrives at the ranch at the beginning of the film seeking to reconcile with his daughter. Unfortunately the intensity of Maggie's initial rejection tips off age eight and older viewers that they will patch things up by the end of the film.

Feminine daughter Lily is soon abducted by a mixed band of Apache scouts and white renegades. Tommy Lee, Maggie, and tomboy daughter Dot take off after them.

It is about this time that things go from gritty realistic to weird and stupid as we meet Eric Schweig, who has had the Indian role in most of the movies made since 1990. And guess what? He's an Indian; a witchdoctor or shaman or shape-shifter called Pesh-Chidin or El Brujo or that weird ugly guy with all the snakes. And more guess what: He looks spooky and his magic really works. He hangs snakes from trees and throws the poisonous dust from magic beans in the eyes of his enemies.

Dr. Brujo has masterminded a plot in which his gang will abduct eight virgins and sell them for more magic beans down in Mexico. He even bewitches poor Maggie from a distance. Busy as he is, Dr. Brujo still manages to find time to berate his housekeeper, whip his deformed stupid assistants, and critique the world's first known bondage photos.

It's nonstop boredom and yawns aplenty in the second half of this genre-bridging low-key quasi-thriller.

The filmmaking is of the highest order and the story slowly captivates you. The characters are good and realistic: Tommy Lee Jones plays a white man gone injun who returns to his adult daughter whom he inexplicably deserted years earlier. Cate Blanchett portrays the unforgiving daughter who is an unmarried doctor and mother of two girls in the New Mexican wilderness.

One of the best characters is the Apache witchdocter who kidnaps one of Blanchett's daughters. Played by Eric Schweig, this is one of the most memorable villains in cinematic history, ranking up there with the deadly fop from ""Rob Roy."" The witchdoctor (or ""brujo"") is a true fiend of the lowest depth; the incarnation of heartless evil itself.

The last hour or so of the film takes place in some fine Southwest locations; if you love the Southwest, be sure to check out this film.

For a more detailed account of the film please read John M. Walker's excellent review just below mine. His words are so accurate that it would be meaningless for me to add anything. I'd just like to finish this review by addressing a criticism from Roger Ebert:

Ebert criticizes how unbelievable it is that Jones and Blanchett are able to outdo the indians at being indians. Yet anyone who watches the film will observe that their realistic plan is to simply BUY BACK the girls from the brujo and his clan, not confront them in an unwise melee. Secondly, other indians join their cause and therefore it's not just a group of white folks trying to outdo indians at being indian. Thirdly, Jones lived with the indians for years, so if anyone could outdo the indians at being indian it would be someone like him. Fourthly, Blanchett is portrayed as a tough-as-nails woman living a very hard life in the Western wilderness; hence, she and most other non-indian people in similar circumstances were more than formidable as opponents of the kidnapping indians (Why is it assumed that only indians lived a hard life in the West? ANYONE living out in the wilderness in that era had to be tough).

Please keep in mind that the people who gave low reviews to this film are the same geeks that thought ""The Dukes of Hazzard"" was a great film. (HA, HA!)",1129766400,22,2301,4.671604938271605
1510489,5,B00005JMPT,"The reviews on this venue can certainly portray a wide spectrum of reactions to a film, and that can make for some interesting reading.  My reaction to this film is essentially the opposite of what seems to be the prevailing view of it.

The premise of the story did not particularly catch my attention, but when I sat down to watch it, I found myself captivated.  I thought the story telling was some of the most intense I had ever seen.  The subtle direction of Ron Howard, mixed with some acute realism, and then some fearful mysticism, combined to pierce my psyche.  I was a bit drained at its conclusion-that does not often happen to this viewer.

My introduction to Cate Blanchett was with Bill Murray in ""The Life Aquatic.""  The dichotomy of these roles for her could hardly be more extreme: from the height of inanity to great intensity.  It's good to see her in a role that accesses her talents.

As for Tommy Lee Jones, his character and his handling of it were to me convincing, and this authenticity I again attribute to the subtlety of its rendering.  His life story, as told in the film, is just that of a man following his star as he sees it, and this results in some tragedy for others.  What could be more true-to-life than a strong man leading a life that is heroic in some respects, but harmful to others in other respects?  Examining this life creates considerable pathos.

On one point there seems to be unanimity: the passion of young Jenna Boyd.  Wow!

It would be remiss to not acknowledge the artistry that went into creating the El Brujo character played by Eric Schweig.  This story required a character of incarnate evil, and the direction, acting, and make-up pull this off masterfully.

To be politically correct, there are a pair of good, really handsome Indians who also ride to the rescue and, because of the girls' behavior, are killed or wounded.

1510586,4,B00005JMPT,"""The Missing,"" like so many movies released towards the end of 2003 was totally swamped by the success of ""Return of the King."" Watching the movie on DVD, several months later, Ron Howard's ""The Missing,"" much like ""The Last Samurai"" or ""Hilgado,"" seems to take on a life of its own. Like both of those films, much of ""The Missing"" is only of average quality, but there are enough strong performances to recommend them. And, for affectionatos, ""The Missing"" is especially worth seeing. It's a treat for me to see a new Western that isn't made for cable.

Howard seems to have intended this film as a tribute to the John Wayne/John Ford collaborations. While Howard's no Ford, protagonist Tommy Lee Jones lends his role some of the craggy gravity Wayne possessed in later films. The plot, like many Ford Westerns, is straightforward and the true joy of the film comes from the uneasy alliance between Cate Blanchett and Tommy Lee Jones' characters as they attempt to prevent rogue Apaches from selling young women into prostitution. There's also some beautiful cinematography.

The chief problem with this movie is a bizarre subplot involving the Apache gangleader. He's a witch, and he has the power to magically affect his enemies. Such a character would work well in a more fantastic film, and could conceivably work in a western if the director made it clear that his powers worked only on his superstitious followers. Howard wants this to be a real witch in a semi-realistic film and it suffers as a result. It's like forcing elements of a Wes Craven film into a Clint Eastwood story - it just does not work. The film is also hampered by an overlong running time, and by failing to distinguish itself from its influences. ""The Missing"" could have been a half-hour shorter and would have been better for it.

If you've already seen the true classics of Western cinema, from John Ford down through Sergio Leone, and have been converted into a Western film buff - then, this is a movie you will enjoy. I'm such a person, and I enjoyed watching Howard tackle a Western. If you are not a Western fan, this movie is probably not for you.",1107129600,,2135,4.7032085561497325
1510587,4,B00005JMPT,"Definitely a wonderful western, The Missing, brings to the screen the story of a mother of two girls and her estranged father as they hunt down the kidnappers of her eldest daughter before they make it to Mexico.  There, the kidnappers led by an evil renegade Apache shaman plan to sell her along with other girls that they've collected to Mexican slavers/pimps.  The whole experience will affect them in the most profound way.

The setting is 1885 New Mexico, and it is a film about human relations, hope and second chances, but most importantly about how trust, love, and inner strength, can lead out of situations, which might seem bleak or desperate at first glance.

On the negative side, the only setback is how at exactly the right time ""allies"" appeared to help them as well as the fact that the kidnappers were way out of their league number-wise.

But all ingredients sadly come to very little under Ron Howard's undercooked direction. Visually and dramatically the film compares very poorly in toughness, menace and visual power with 'The Searchers' on which it is clearly a riff, a decaffeinated, low-cal one at that..

1510691,2,B00005JMPT,"After the success of the 'Beautiful Mind,' Ron Haward picked up a Western film.  I know he is a good filmmaker, and I like his films too, but 'The Missing' is not one of them.  The reason is twofold: it suffers from the long, long running time (135 mins), and from its overdramatized script.

The simple plot should remain simple here, but the film seems to think it has to begin from the solemn introductory part, where we see the heroine named Maggie (played by ever-reliable Cate Blanchett) pull out a tooth (and the last one) from an old lady.  Painful, isn't it?  But this is how she earns extra money for living, and the film insists on telling that, while it has already secured Cate Blanchett's superb, convincing  acting at hand.  Do we need anything more?

The time is 1885.  In the middle of the deserted land of New Mexico, Maggie lives her lonely, not-so-comfortable life, with her two daughters, and a kind-hearted cowboy (Aaron Eckhart).  One day, however, Maggie's father Samuel (Tommy Lee Jones, very grim as usual), who left her and her mother long time ago, comes back to her.  Well, Maggie doesn't like it, and treats him to show it.

AND THEN, finally, the real story starts.  One of the daughters is kidnapped by an Indian Chidin (Eric Schweig), to be sold across the border.  Now, Maggie, Samuel, and even the younger daughter team up, in order to find the lost track of the kidnappers heading for the south.

Comparison with John Ford's classic 'The Searchers' would be unfair.  I know.  It was made before the current PC mood spread all over Hollywood.  Though 'The Missing' shows a really 'bad' Indian, that is not the real problem at all.  No. no, see, because...

RON HOWARD'S MISTAKE is that he tried to contain as many elements in the plot as possible, while the plot should be more straight and simple.  You will see several set-pieces, in which the seachers or the missing daughter are involved, but none of them add anything to the already slim story, perhaps except the relation between Maggie and Samuel.  My impression was as if the film wants to delay the inevitable (or predictable) conclusion as much as it can.  Why did the kidnapped daughter (Evan Rache Wood), given lots of chances to escape, has to blow it?  Why does the Indian use the 'magic,' which actually works, and putting a spell on our heroine, to torment her??  Is this supposed to be about the 'Missing'?

'The Missing' has great photography and performance from Cate Blanchett, who with her authentic acting really makes us forget that she once played Queen Elizabeth I.  Before watching the film, she happened to be the single reason for me to go all the way to the theater.  Now, to me, she is still the single reason for me to watch it again ... if ever I should.",1096934400,4,2771,4.6
1510692,3,B00005JMPT,"I welcomed this film with open arms and an open mind.  The Western is a fading genre, and I hadn't seen a good modern example of one since Clint Eastwood's ""Unforgiven.""  The actors in The Missing are talented and respected by many.  Tommy Lee Jones fits perfectly in a Western film, and Cate Blanchett really surprised me.  She played the part of a strong, single frontier mother quite well.  The storyline is intriguing:  A brutal, psychotic Native man and his band are kidnapping young women and selling them in Mexico.  Cate Blanchett's character loses one of her daughters, and her estranged father (Tommy Lee Jones) offers to help track the girl down.

The setting is beautiful.  The action is thrilling, and frequent.  The first hour is engrossing and had me glued to my chair.  Then, the plot begins to stutter.  The two main characters abandon their initial plan of attack in favor of a string of ill-conceived ones.  And find themselves in a battle with black magic hocus-pocus.  After this plunge into the ridiculous, director/producer Ron Howard is unable to bring the film back up into believability.  He made the mistake of many first-time Western producers.

1510693,3,B00005JMPT,"Ron Howard is a great director, which is why I found this film to be somewhat disappointing, as it is not up to his usual standards. Despite a stellar cast, the film falls somewhat flat. Part of it has to do with the ambitious screenplay, as it promises much but never makes totally good on its promise. The pacing is so slow that it seems to take forever for the film to come to its somewhat unsatisfactory end.

The plot revolves around Maggie Gilkeson (Cate Blanchett), a tough frontierswoman in  late nineteenth century New Mexico. She lives on a ranch with her two daughters and two ranch hands, one of whom is in love with her. She is a healer of sorts and is estranged from her father (Tommy Lee Jones), who abandoned her and her mother when she was a child in order to go and live with the Indians. Notwithstanding the estrangement, he goes to her ranch to try to make past wrongs right, only to meet with rejection.

While there,  Maggie's teenage daughter, Lily (Evan Rachel Wood), is kidnapped by a group of renegade Indians led by El Brujo (Eric Schweig), an evil miscreant who plans to sell the girls he has abducted into white slavery in Mexico.  In abducting her, he kills the two ranch hands who stand in the way of his getting his prey.  As part of Maggie's father's atonement for his past wrongs, he agrees to help Maggie track down the abductors and lead her and her younger daughter, Dot (Jenna Boyd),  to the hapless Lily.

One of the problems with the film is that Lily is an unlikable character. The viewer does not really care what happens to her. Moreover, although the camera beguilingly kisses the chiseled planes of Cate Blanchett's face, Maggie is also an unlikable character. Tommy Lee Jones fares somewhat better as his character is likable, but the standout in this film is beautiful little Jenna Boyd in the role of Dot.

1510695,4,B00005JMPT,"This movie is a great modern western complete with strong women, evil men and a little girl that will steal your heart.

 Ron Howard directs this western set in New Mexico and molds a beautiful and well written film into a masterpiece. Cate Blanchett stars as a woman who practices the art of healing; she lives alone on a ranch with her two daughters and survives with a lot of strength and gusto. Blanchett receives a visitor one day, her long lost father, (played with excellence by Tommy Lee Jones) and the story begins to unravel and pick up steam. Then she sends her daughters off with workers to the city but soon finds they never return. She discovers the campsite and finds her youngest daughter (Jenna Boyd) amongst the ruins. The men have been killed and her oldest daughter (Evan Rachel Wood) kidnapped by Indians bent on selling her in Mexico. Most of the film is spent on the chase between good and evil throughout New Mexico and is both suspenseful and stunning.

Tommy Lee Jones is fantastic as the father who abandoned his family and Blanchett in order to run with Indians. He is wise and spiritual and ends up being a leader at the very center of this film. Meeting Jones's greatness is Jenna Boyd, she plays the youngest daughter of Blanchett and is a true spitfire, her role makes you question if true strength is born or made. Evan Rachel Wood is alright in her role as the kidnapped daughter but her character's ineptness is highly irritating although she certainly adds to the suspense of the film. One of the most effective roles is played by the grotesque Eric Schweig, who manages to portray the evil Indian witch with great conviction; he makes your skin crawl! Although the story that unfolds around these characters is fairly basic it is a fabulous experience filled with courage and depth while diving into the heart of evil as well.  If you love westerns this should be added to your list but this movie is also much more than just a western filled up by guns and horses, it is a story about family and the relationships that bind us through our greatest despair.",1093996800,3,2094,4.590909090909091
1510696,2,B00005JMPT,"**1/2 Blandly directed by Ron Howard, ""The Missing"" is a grim, depressing western that strands Cate Blanchett and Tommy Lee Jones in two thoroughly uninteresting roles.  Blanchett is a frontier doctor living on a ranch in 1885 New Mexico; Jones is her long lost daddy who left her as a child and has since adopted the Apache way of life.  As the movie opens, he returns - in full Indian regalia - to bury the hatchet and make amends for his long absence.  Blanchett wants nothing whatsoever to do with him, but when her oldest daughter is kidnapped to be sold into slavery in Mexico, Blanchett reluctantly enlists his aid in getting her back.

For all the high caliber talent both behind and in front of the camera, ""The Missing"" is a surprisingly mediocre, undistinguished film, plodding, overlong and faintly sadistic in character and tone.  The relationship between father and daughter develops along predictable lines, with the initial antagonism softening to mutual respect and admiration through the course of the action.  The many scenes involving the mistreatment of these helpless, innocent girls give the film a faintly distasteful air all the way through.  Although the screenplay hews pretty close to reality most of the time, it occasionally wanders off into the realm of the supernatural as Indian shaman indulge in competing spells and Jones calls on some sort of bird spirit to get him out of trouble.  These scenes serve merely to undercut the more realistic tone of the rest of the picture.

Jones and Blanchett give professional performances, but there really isn't much for them to work with here in terms of developing characters or making an emotional impact on the audience.  ""The Missing"" feels pretty much like a walk through for everyone involved, a movie that will be quickly digested and quickly forgotten by the vast majority of the people who care enough to see it.",1093737600,16,1895,4.930817610062893

1510724,4,B00005JMPT,"Ron Howard's THE MISSING is a blend of western, action and supernatural ingredients.  Having the marvelous Cate Blanchett as Maggie catapults the picture into its worthiness.  Blanchett is exceptional as Maggie, a single frontier mother raising two feisty daughters (played wonderfully by Evan Rachel Wood and Jenna Boyd), while maintaining an affair with the affable Brake (Aaron Eckhart, always good).  Her estranged father shows up one day and it's obvious Maggie has little affection for him. Tommy Lee Jones plays the father, with his usual swagger and rugged machismo.  His performance is good, but he is overshadowed by Ms. Blanchett.
The movie has a cruelty to it, in that Eric Schweig as El Brujo is a heartless and cruel man, perhaps even a witch??  His treatment of the girls he kidnaps is brutal and inhumane, so this adds a very dark edge to the film.
The photography is sumptious, and the music appropriately moving.  The film tends to bog down at times, and it's length at over two hours doesn't help.  Overall, though, THE MISSING shows the talent of a very determined director and a wonderful gifted actress.  That makes it worth viewing.",1089763200,5,1155,4.948186528497409
1510725,3,B00005JMPT,"""The Missing"" is an incredible piece work, an epic western, and an effectively eerie thriller. Directed by Ron Howard and starring Cate Blanchett and Tommy Lee Jones, this film is worth a peek and watchable, despite being bogged down by repetitive flaws and an unnecessary length. Then again, 2003 wasn't the best movie year...
The film involves a healer Maggie (Cate Blanchett) who lives on a farm with her lover Brake and her two children. Her father (Tommy Lee Jones) has been estranged from her since she was a child and he has since become an Indian and married many times. One evening, Maggie's father comes to their ranch in search of a healer, not realizing that she is his own daughter. She completely ignores him and quickly fixes him up. He is arrested that evening after a scuffle with Brake, who is also preparing to take the two daughters to a fair the next day. When the daughters and Brake go off to the festival, Maggie falls asleep on her porch and awakes to find a wolf in her house and a creepy feeling about the air. She is unsure of her family's whereabouts and ventures into the woods to find them. There is a butchered Brake and the younger daughter, Dot, screaming because her older sister is gone, having been kidnapped by a brutal group of Apache Indians. Maggie has her father released from jail and he assists her in finding the daughter. Dot insists on joining them and they venture off into plains, floods, and grounds of witchcraft to track the Indians.
Some may call this a horror film, and in fact, I remember one critic calling it ""Stephen King's `Little House on the Prairie.'"" It is not a scary film, though. The idea of kidnapping and Indians might be disturbing to some, but it is not at all scary. The trailers misrepresent the film. It is, in fact, a riveting drama with fine performances and a brain. The musical score is captivating and beautiful, certainly deserving of an Oscar nomination. The photography is gritty and evocative, capturing the essence of the pain that Maggie and her family must be going through. The screenplay is weak, though, in several spots. The dialogue is often smart but often unclear. It probably takes several viewings to truly understand this movie.
The performances are really what make this film good. Cate Blanchett is brilliant, as usual, and never fails for a moment. You can't take your eyes off the screen because she is just so great. Tommy Lee Jones also reemerges with a fine performance too, worthy of an Oscar nomination. These two stars are great together, and the young actresses are good as well. Aaron Eckhart is solid, but not great, seeing as he is only in the first 30 minutes of the movie. The acting makes the movie.
Overall, the film is worth a viewing, even though flaws are seen throughout. I really found it enjoyable and thrilling, but it kept ending and ending. Why do movies do this? They never want to end...do they?",1089504000,4,2919,4.647969052224371
1510726,5,B00005JMPT,"New Mexico has one of the most beautiful and haunting landscapes in the United States.  Desert, arroyo, plains, twisted wood and rock formations, and a sky that is like something out of a dream.  In The Missing, this landscape shifts constantly, evoking fantastic and surreal images that lend well to the mood of the story.
Cate Blanchett stars as Maggie, a tough and independent frontier ""healer,"" who is also a single mother of two girls.  Her independence is not enough to save her from the nightmare that erupts when a renegade Apache brujo (sorceror/male witch) kidnaps her teenage daughter Lily.  The Brujo is selling young women as sex slaves in Mexico.  This man is one bad Indian.  Like Lonesome Dove's Blue Duck, the Brujo lends this gritty Western authenticity in these days of forced diversity and political correctness.  Not to give anything of the story away, let's just say the villian's methods of killing are creative.  This makes The Missing a very violent and disturbing movie.
Tommy Lee Jones stars as Maggie's estranged father.  He is steeped in Indian ways himself, having lived with the Chirakawa tribe when he abandoned his family when Maggie was a little girl.  Consequently, Maggie has intense hatred for her father.  One of the very touching elements in the story is young Dot's eagerness to get to know her grandfather over her mother's rage.  Revenge is not served up here, rather repentance is.  Going after what you love, what has been taken from you, has consequences.  Maggie's outright revulsion for Indians also has a terrible and unforseen consequence in the movie.  Indian magic and witchcraft is real in this film, blending with the shape-shifting landscape.  For further understanding of Native American witchcraft, Tony Hillerman's novel Skinwalkers is good.
The movie's general sequence of events is predictable, but that was not enough to stop me from weeping at the end.  Also, the suspense was incredible. I should have known with a Ron Howard movie.  I plan on purchasing this DVD, and I think my husband will really enjoy it, too.",1088726400,49,2076,4.9854651162790695
1510727,3,B00005JMPT,"The Missing isn't my favorite movie but it does have a lot going for it. Northern New Mexico 1885 is the setting in which a youngish single mother and her two daughters try to make a living on her ranch (supplemented by her doctoring/dental skills) with the help of a couple of hired hands (one of which is her lover).
As shown their life is cold and dreary, the oldest daughter can think of nothing but getting away somehow, someday. Maggie's father ""Jones"", played by Tommy Lee Jones, who abandoned his family many years before comes to visit- and is given orders to leave the next morning because she doesn't want him around.
Soon after that the girls go off with the men on ranch work, Maggie learns that something is wrong when a riderless horse makes it back to the ranch. She tears off on a search and finds both men dead, her eldest daughter kidnapped by slavers bound for Mexico.
Maggie and Dot(the youngest daughter) head for town to get help but end up with only her father's aid (he'd been jailed by the sheriff- Clint Howard, who doesn't seem to get good acting jobs unless Director/ brother Ron gives them to him). Using Jones tracking skills the trio finds the trail and learn of other vicitms. Val Kilmer makes a brief cameo as an Army Lieutenant on a separate search- in the wrong direction of course (I didn't realize who he was until I saw the credits).
Eventually Jones and the ladies meet up with a couple of his Indian friends and they find all of the missing women. Jones is killed in the process of saving Maggie from the brujo (who is also killed).
I though the movie was often slow but very detailed at all sorts of levels from scenery to clothing and weapons. The extras disc has a lot of mini features, most of which don't mean very much except to show something of the process in which the film was shot. One of the most interesting was the one in which we learn about how the cast was taught to speak the correct Apache dialect- one of their advisers was the greatgranddaughter of the Chiricauhua Chief Cochise.
Cate Blanchett did very well with an American accent although her native Australian didn't seem to me to be as strong as some I've heard. Tommy Lee Jones was good, but then he could practically sleep walk his way through and get the job done, he's a natural. Jenna Boyd, Dot, did well too.",1088467200,4,2331,4.4485981308411215

1510729,3,B00005JMPT,"""The Missing"" definetely had the potential to be one of Ron Howard's best films, but somewhere along the way Howard seemed to have given up on it.  It begins as a family melodrama and brutal western thrown into one, and the beginning scenes are fairly tense and effective.  The cinematography in the films is sometimes downright stunning, stuitably bleak and gritty.  However, Howard chose at one point to abandon the risks he was taking in making such a dark and uncompromising film, as it eventually feels watered down.
WARNING: MODERATE SPOILERS AHEAD
If you recall, Ron Howard films are usually tense and entertaining, but have upbeat conclusions and are never too graphic.  Despite what the beginning of the film leads you to believe, this description applies to ""The Missing"" as well.  Exempting brutal attacks at the beginning of the film (which happen off-screen- we only see the results) and a pointless-but-gory bit involving a photographer's death, ""The Missing"" really just feels like a normal Ron Howard film with a slight dark edge.  Howard's various choices- like making sure Maggie's kidnapped daughter is never in any real danger of being raped, despite what she's kidnapped for- eventually just give the impression that he's going through the motions and not taking any real risks.
For me, ""The Missing"" really falls apart when the villain Brujo (or whatever he's called) appears.  This guy was so laughably evil and one-dimensional that he would have been at home in a Saturday morning cartoon.  We're never offered any motivations for his actions, so the film quickly becomes a simple good vs. evil tale- it feels insulting to your intelligence, since the film was obviously aimed at adults.  Why does the Brujo brutally kill people and kidnap women to sell into slavery?  Because it makes him feel good!  I'm not kidding, the guy only smiles when he's watching the suffering of others.  Not exactly a complex (and hence real) character.
This whole review probably feels kind of rambling, and that's because I had very mixed feelings about ""The Missing"".  It's a solid adventure story with some impressive acting (especially from Cate Blanchett), but I just felt it could have been so much more.  By refusing to take too many risks, Howard eventually just leaves you with an entertaining- but ultimately forgettable- action/western movie.",1087948800,13,2358,5.075129533678757

The plot: When a rancher's daughter is kidnapped she appeals to her estranged tracker grandfather for assistance. Together they track the kidnappers across the frontier and face mutual hardship. Can they save her Lilly or is she doomed for slavery in Mexico?
I really liked the film. The cinematography was beautiful and I liked the scenes with the Native American actors. I did think some scenes were unnecessarily gruesome (the murdered ranch hands), (the tooth removal scene), but that's what the fast forward button is for. Oh, and I also thought Lilly was a complete waste of space. I think this movie would've had more impact if the person kidnapped was someone I actually liked.

Man, that's a bummer, and so is THE MISSING, which sure has a good-looking package, but when you get to the actual contents you can't help but feel disappointed.
With director Ron Howard and the acting talents of Tommy Lee Jones and Cate Blanchett, this movie certainly has enough star power.  Set in the New Mexico wilderness of the 19th Century, Blanchett, a widow, must rely on her estranged father (Jones) to help her rescue her older daughter from what can only be described as Lucifer's Lunatics.  Led by a frightening Eric Schweig, I kept waiting for this band of Apache renegades to start singing ""Helter Skelter"" at any moment.  This bunch always seemed to be on the lookout for more ways to maim, torture, or kill--and indeed, they were very creative.
Okay, so we've set the stage:  the package looks good.  But when you unwrap it this movie has as much flavor as a piece of cardboard.  Jones and Blanchett are so detached and aloof--in their roles and with each other--that it's impossible for the viewer to care what happens.  And the bad guys are so bad it requires a titanic leap of witch doctor faith to believe what is happening before your eyes.

1510798,3,B00005JMPT,"Ron Howard is a great director, which is why I found this film to be somewhat disappointing, as it is not up to his usual standards. Despite a stellar cast, the film falls somewhat flat. Part of it has to do with the ambitious screenplay, as it promises much but never makes totally good on its promise. The pacing is so slow that it seems to take forever for the film to come to its somewhat unsatisfactory end.
The plot revolves around Maggie Gilkeson (Cate Blanchett), a tough frontierswoman in  late nineteenth century New Mexico. She lives on a ranch with her two daughters and two ranch hands, one of whom is in love with her. She is a healer of sorts and is estranged from her father (Tommy Lee Jones), who abandoned her and her mother when she was a child in order to go and live with the Indians. Notwithstanding the estrangement, he goes to her ranch to try to make past wrongs right, only to meet with rejection.
While there,  Maggie's teenage daughter, Lily (Evan Rachel Wood), is kidnapped by a group of renegade Indians led by El Brujo (Eric Schweig), an evil miscreant who plans to sell the girls he has abducted into white slavery in Mexico.  In abducting her, he kills the two ranch hands who stand in the way of his getting his prey.  As part of Maggie's father's atonement for his past wrongs, he agrees to help Maggie track down the abductors and lead her and her younger daughter, Dot (Jenna Boyd), to the hapless Lily.
One of the problems with the film is that Lily is an unlikable character. The viewer does not really care what happens to her. Moreover, although the camera beguilingly kisses the chiseled planes of Cate Blanchett's face, Maggie is also an unlikable character. Tommy Lee Jones fares somewhat better as his character is likable, but the standout in this film is beautiful little Jenna Boyd in the role of Dot. She is a natural and  the saving grace of this film.  This is essentially a B movie with an A cast. Still, the cast simply cannot make up for the tedium of the script.

Yet I liked ""The Missing"".  I think it is much better than the mediocre reviews given it.  It's clearly an old fashioned western, old fashioned in that the main theme is not about ""violence"" (like most modern westerns, few though they may be) but about ""family"".  It has violence, plenty of violence, but like the older Westerns which had major themes like ""honor"", ""courage"", ""devotion"", ""redemption"" and ""family"", to name a few, violence is a method, not the message.
""The Missing"" also has a lot of formal qualities that I find interesting.  Like a few other movies (""Boogie Nights"" is one example that immediately comes to mind) it attempts to tell the story visually -- not as successfully as, say, ""Citizen Kane"" nor movies from the silent era, but much more than most movies do today (remember the last time you saw a movie on an airplane without purchasing the earphones and recognize how incomprehensible and dull the film actually was without the sound to hold it up).  One way the story is told in ""The Missing"" is by the way characters fill the screen and don't fill the screen:  like a placement of the protagonist in the frame toward the end of the film reveals his vulnerability while he is revealing truths about himself to his daughter; several places the antagonist is placed in the frame in a way to show his desire to be invisible, to blend into his surroundings.  The dramatic lighting in dark interiors, the editing (a lot of montages with strings of shots with similar compositions, shapes replacing similar shapes), you can tell Ron Howard had more than a passing interest in John Ford westerns.
I might have to re-watch other Ron Howard films, paying more attention this time.",1084233600,,1945,4.650145772594752
1510852,4,B00005JMPT,"The Missing is a good movie.  It's not an epic film worthy of Oscars and high praise, but it is quite entertaining.  Ron Howard is a talented director, and he had a good cast to work with.  I haven't seen Tommy Lee Jones do anything bad, and Cate Blanchett is very good.  Howard also had a well-written script to put to film.
The movie starts fairly slowly, but not in a boring way.  I suppose since I knew what the film was about I was more apt to stay focused.  That's not saying, however, that I would have lost interest otherwise.  There's some pretty good character development, especially with Jones' and Blanchett's characters.  Their strained relationship is well displayed, but not overdone.
The movie takes off about a half hour in when one of Blanchett's daughters turns up missing.  This is where the violence starts, too.  One thing this movie does not lack is violence.
The hunt for the missing daughter is well executed and is pretty realistic, with a few hiccups and failed attempts.  The villian is convincing as a witch who collects women and casts spells.
Although it's a bit over two hours, I was kept interested throughout.  Good action and fair dialogue moves the movie along pretty well.",1084147200,2,1210,4.682464454976303
1510853,3,B00005JMPT,"Ron Howard's hardly tiptoeing into the western genre with this fairly graphic and violent story concerning abduction, white slavery and mystical powers, and the end result is actually fairly good. Cate Blanchett has to reluctantly call on the aid of her estranged father, to help track down and rescue her daughter, kidnapped in an Indian ambush early in the picture, and Howard cleverly weaves the resentful divide between the two main characters, whilst hinting at, but never promising a reconciliation, in the subplot that runs in tandem to the main story. The acting performances are excellent, particularly from Jenna Boyd playing the younger sister (somehow overlooked in the initial raid), who joins the search party, and some excellent panoramic camera work graces the movie throughout, showing the isolation, and dangers of the time, period, and place in almost tangible form. Eric Schweig is frighteningly villianous as the mysterious witch doctor indian leading the band of kidnappers, and the movie promises much in the way of tense intrigue, and powerful viewing. Running over two hours however seemed to me to be an over indulgence, and one feels that Howard stops the action a few too many times along the way to sniff the scenic roses, so to speak, which does more than break the movie up a little. Tommy Lee Jones is as usual, excellent in the role of Blanchetts father (the once white man ""gone Indian"") who pulls everything together in the story, and adds much credibility to the script. Often very graphically violent, as well as in suggestion, this movie could also be cross genred to a supernatural thriller in a more contemporary setting, which shows the depth of the direction. As it is however, a good, but not a great movie. Enjoy",1083715200,4,1756,4.976190476190476

1510855,3,B00005JMPT,"This 2003 film is quite ambitious.  Set in New Mexico in 1885, it tells the story of some bad Indians who kidnapped young women and sold them as virtual slaves in Mexico.  I have never heard of this practice before and wonder whether it is historically correct, but is certainly is a good theme for a film.

But that is just the background story.  The real story is about the relationship between a father, Tommy Lee Jones, and his adult daughter, Cate Blanchett.  The father had deserted his family many years before and went off to live with the Indians.  The daughter hates him for it.  However, when her own teenage daughter, Evan Rachel Wood, is kidnapped, the only hope she has of getting her daughter back is to depend on her father.  As they search for the missing daughter, they have to confront the reality of their relationship.

Directed by Ron Howard, this is a big budget film and the actors are some of the best working in Hollywood today. To me, however, 10-year-old Jeanna Boyd, who is cast as the younger sister of the kidnapped teenager, did the very finest acting job.  It's a big role for a little girl and calls for her to witness some horrible acts of violence, be absolutely terrified, and yet be very brave.  My heart went out to her completely and I am sure this is just the beginning of a long and successful career for her.

The weakness of the film was the plot.  It was just a little too predictable and far-fetched.  Somewhere along the line I stopped caring about the human story and got too caught up in the plot twists, which tried to make the film politically correct.  It did hold my interest, however, because it was fast paced and well directed, but it just didn't have what I consider ""heart"".",1082764800,10,1732,4.4888178913738015

One morning, her two daughters set off with ranch hands Brake and Emiliano, promising to return by nightfall.  As night approaches, Brake's horse returns to the ranch without a rider.  Maggie sets off to find them and discovers her daughter Dot still alive in the midst of a massacre.  Dot tells her that Lily's been taken by Indians.  Determined to find Lily, Maggie strikes an alliance with her estranged father, Samuel Jones.  With Dot in tow, the three set off to get Lily before she's taken across the border into Mexico.
This is a very good story, almost an ode to the old Westerns.  The acting really stands out in this film, especially Cate Blanchett as Maggie and Eric Schwieg as Chidin, the brouja who is kidnapping young women to take across the border to Mexico to sell.  His performance is quiet astonishing and full of menace.  The two daughters are also very good: Jenna Boyd as the young Dot and Evan Rachel Wood as Lily.  Val Kilmer and Aaron Eckhart make appearances, too.  Tommy Lee Jones is okay, if a little wooden.
What I didn't like about this film is the slow pacing.  The movie's over two hours in length, but feels like seven before you get through.  I fast-forwarded through a lot of scenes that were simply filler and could have been cut without damaging the story.  This is a chase; it should feel as if the story is moving along quickly.  Also, the music didn't blend in or enhance the story.  I was very aware of it and, for me, that's distracting.

I am a bit tired of the same character type played by Tommy Lee Jones, he does it well but it's becoming repetitious.  I really enjoyed the performance of the girl that played the younger sister I thought she pulled off some difficult acting for someone her age.
There is a bit of blood and gore in this flick, and a fair amount of violence, which shouldn't be too surprising, but nothing too gratuitous.

""The Missing"" is a mostly Indian and Indian western (as opposed to Cowboy and Indian)that takes place in New Mexico in the 1880s

THE PLOT
Apache renegade Army scouts are on the loose and they are murdering farmers and ranchers and kidnapping the young attractive women to be sold into white slavery in Mexico.
Healer/Rancher Maggie Gilkerson's oldest daughter, Lily, perhaps seventeen is one of the captives.
THE STORY
Samuel Jones (Tommy Lee Jones) is Maggie Gilkerson's (Cate Blanchett)estranged father. He left Maggie's family years earlier to live among the Apache. Samuel for all appearances is an Indian and after living with the Indians for half his life he thinks like one too.
Samuel rides into Maggie's ranch ostensibly looking for rapprochement but he is rejected out of hand and forced at gunpoint to leave.
The next day Maggie's daughters, Lily and Dot are escorted to town by their two ranch hands to attend a fair. By dark they have not returned. In the morning a riderless horse runs through the yard. Something is very amiss!
Maggie takes the horse in addition to her own and heads off to try and locate her missing party. What she finds is heart wrenching. One of the ranch hands lies naked with three arrows in his back and there is a bundle hanging from a tree. As the breeze swings the bundle around she sees that it is the other ranch hand, the foreman and her lover, trussed up in a painful contortion and brutally murdered.
One good thing, Dot, the younger daughter, was told to hide and not come out. Maggie finds her totally shaken up but unharmed, however, Lily is nowhere to be found.
Maggie's first thought is that, her father Samuel, has committed this monstrosity. She heads off to town and reports it to the Sheriff and suggests that it might be Samuel, who happened to be in jail, drunk and disorderly.
By use of that marvelous new invention Marconi's telegraph, they discover that a group of escaped Indian renegades is murdering ranchers and abducting young women. It is believed that they are heading north and the Army is after them.
Maggie's efforts to get the Sheriff's assistance are useless as he tells her to let the Army do the job. When the Sheriff asks Maggie what he should do with her father, she replies ""release him""
Back at her ranch, Samuel rides in and informs her that he has discovered the renegades trail, which heads south towards Mexico and not north as supposed. At this point Maggie realizes that Lily and her only hope is to enlist her father's help.
Meanwhile, the renegades, now with seven women have almost finished their human harvest. The leader is Chiden, a particularly brutal and evil individual, who is also a Brujo, (a male witch) with supernatural powers, who hates Whites and kills indiscriminately. The nefarious Chiden does not like the number seven (it's bad luck for him) so they delay going to Mexico until another girl can be acquired.
This buys our little search party a little more precious time, for once a captive Lily enters Mexico she is lost.
Cast/Acting
The cast seem to be well chosen and fit their characters quite well. There has been some discussion among other reviewers about the lack of emotion. I think emotion was portrayed perfectly. These people were settlers, farmers and ranchers. Life was hard, they did have time for emotion and once the renegades struck emotion had to be set aside for a goal of retrieving Lily. That does not mean the characters were emotionless, they weren't.
Cate Blanchett and the little girl, Jenna Boyd, were superb. Blanchett's portrayal of Maggie Gilkison is about a self made, self-sufficient, brave and determined, frontierswoman out to reclaim her daughter even at the cost of her other daughter and her life. I really enjoyed Boyd's role as Dot. She was laid back and affable, kind of a bridge between the tensions of mother and grandfather. Tommy Lee Jones' portrayed a lonely older man drawing on his experiences in two societies to help his daughter to find and buy Lily back.
It seems that Ron Howard has found his niche. He is a fine Director and ""The Missing"" is no exception. I can't believe how many reviewers said this movie was slow moving and boring. To me it was a quick 130 minutes. Yes I felt while I was watching it that it was a long movie but I was glad, because I was really enjoying it.
SUMMARY
Of course comparisons to the old (1956) John Wayne movie ""The Searchers"" are inevitable, hell I did it myself in the title. Yes, it has a similar plot but that's about it. In ""The Searchers"", Wayne's character is a civil war vet, a movie about White men chasing after Commanche Indians who have his niece. In ""The Missing"", the main characters are a gritty frontierswoman and her estranged Apache-phile father chasing renegades to recover her daughter. The only White man was one of the renegades. In 1956 no one would have thought to make a movie about a strong willed, self sufficient woman. Isn't it great?
Personally, I like ""The Missing more"". In the fifties the movies were less realistic, more sanitized and the acting and sets were less natural. Heck both movies are good and if Ron Howard, after 47 years, said he was making a remake of ""The Searchers"", comparisons would have been moot and many detractors would have been singing the praises of ""The Missing"", the remake of the great ""Searchers""
I liked this movie a lot! final rating: 4.8 stars",1079827200,,5763,4.701285855588527

If The Missing were shorter, say 1hr 45min, I would have given it 4 stars.",1079740800,2,433,3.769230769230769
1510935,1,B00005JMPT,"A dull and easily forgotten suspense movie with no suspense. The trailers and DVD box promise a mystery and a chase that basically never develop. The brilliant Australian actress Cate Blanchett is wasted here, as is Tommy Lee Jones and even bright newcomer Evan Rachel Wood.
This is one of the worst directed films I have seen in a long time, and I am counting some real clunkers. Ron Howard really falls down on the job here, which is a surprise. The cinematography sacrifices clarity to ""arty"" effects, so that the colors are leached out unrealtistically and everyone looks pale and sickly. There is a climatic fight at the end which is shot in such low light that it's nearly impossible to tell what's going on -- certainly such a thing is possible in real life, but in a drama it's just a confusing waste of the viewers time.
We're presented with a wealth of seemingly complicated relationships -- an abandoning father who has taken up Indain ways, a mother with complicated feelings towards her teenage daughter (who was the result of a rape), a spiritual battle between a Mexican ""brujo"" and a Christian healer -- but all character development just peters out without explanation or resolution. Maggie (Blanchett) is having an affair with her ranch hand (Aaron Eckart), but when he is horrifically murdered and she discovers his mutilated body, she expresses little or no emotion and the character is never mentioned again, although the implication is initially that they are in love. This kind of abandoned story arc runs all through the movie, with the end result that we care not one iota about any of the characters, so their survival or demise is of no real concern.
There is less to talk or think about in this big budget, big star production than a typical episode of ""Bonanza"" (the 60s western TV series). A surprisingly dull and half-hearted effort from all involved. This is not worth renting, let alone buying.",1079568000,12,1927,4.78978978978979

I think considering they were riding horses and it took place in the 1800's made a big difference in how fast and long they traveled.  The Indians who took the girls weren't in any hurry as they picked up more along the way the sell.

Fantastically acted, the story really gets down to the nitty gritty as far as what late 19th century life in Arizona was actually like. Everything is so authentic, and all of the actors pour incredible amounts of emotion into their roles. Tommy Lee Jones and Cate Blanchett nail their characters perfectly, and share an emotionally rocky journey from start to finish.

1511009,4,B00005JMPT,"I enjoyed ""The Missing"" more than the commercials and trailers led me to believe I would.  There are plenty of exciting scenes and just a couple that are quite gruesome (and earned it the R rating).  It is a story in the Old West with loners, Indians of various tribes, a couple of Mexicans, and even some magic.  (Personally, I think the magic was used to point up the primitive nature of the medicine Cate Blanchette's character uses as a ""Healer"" and to equate it with the ways of the Native Americans.)
Jenna Boyd is superb as the little girl, Dot.  She nearly dominates every scene she is in and you miss her when she isn't there.  Tommy Lee Jones does a good job as the ne'er do well father, Samuel Jones, who returns as an ""Indian"" so that he and Maggie Gilkeson (Blanchette) can slowly overcome a lifetime of abandonmnet and antipathy.
Evan Rachel Wood does a very good job as Lily.  It is not any fault of hers that Lily has some real complications that are left unresolved.  Something more should have been done with them than simply ending the movie.
The villain is a very evil character who is quite powerful physically, charismatically, and with magic.  I would like to have learned more about his origins and motivations.  But maybe knowing more about him would run the risk of making him sympathetic.  But it is almost impossible to imagine how such an awful creature could become an object of sympathy.
This movie is at times gut wrenching with some very emotional performances.",1078012800,,1494,4.60377358490566
1511010,5,B00005JMPT,"With an interesting twist on Wild West stories Director Ron Howard once again demonstrates his sensitivity to parental/filial relationships. THE MISSING is an excellent example of how a fairly simple story can become a message of epic proportions when writer, director, actors, and cinematographer are in synchrony.
Maggie (played with subdued intensity by the always fine Cate Blanchett) is a ""healer"" (a non-licensed `physician') who lives with her two daughters and a hired hand (Aaron Eckhart) in an Indian territory troubled by the capturing of young women and girls by the Indians and loathsome white types for the purpose of selling them in the white slavery market below the border.  Along comes an older man Sam (Tommy Lee Jones) who appears Indian but in fact is Maggie's absentee father.  Maggie's life since her father's abandonment of her mother and her when she was very young has been difficult and she has little feeling except hate for the father she never knew.  The initial encounter between the two is a fully realized replay of years of emotion that is transmitted to the audience primarily through the power of the eyes in the quality acting of Blanchette and Jones.  When Maggie's older daughter (Evan Rachel Wood) is abducted by the white slavery gang, Maggie has no recourse but to rely on her `Indian' father to aid her in regaining her daughter.  The remainder of the film is an extended chase that contrasts the spiritual aspect of the Indian beliefs with the Christian ethic of Maggie.  The level of suspense runs consistently high but Howard allows this intensified emotional plane to be the playing field for the gradual acceptance by Maggie that her father is at heart a loner but capable of love.  The beauty of the reconciliation is subtly drawn and never artificial.
The cast is uniformly excellent: for once the Indians are humanely portrayed, the children (especially Jenna Boyd as Maggie's younger daughter) are credible, and the `brujo' witchdoctor Indian is evil incarnate. The West has rarely been visualized so realistically.  This is a fine film and transfers to DVD well.  The additional disc is run of the mill snippets that diminish the power of the story - and viewing it is recommended only after the impact of this fine story has settled in.",1077926400,,2290,4.95822454308094
1511090,5,B00005JMPT,"When I first saw this film, I was blown away by it. Overrall it was a great film:Great performances, Great directing and a great story.
Though the first 30 minutes are rather slow, once the film picks up, it is a splendor. Cate Blanchett pulls off yet another great performance as a fronteir medicine woman desperate to rescue her daughter and go through all means to. Tommy Lee Jones delivers yet another flawless performance as a father who abandoned his family and converted to the Apache Indian's culture and religion and come back long after to his daughter for forgiveness. The performance I liked particularly was the role of the girl, Dot. I cant recall the girl's name who played her but she gave a powerful supporting performance.
The only thing that really displeased me about the film was the negative reviews toward it. I don't understand why there was so many who didn't like this film, but oh well. can't please everyone.
All in all, this film is worth a rent and even worth a buy, though I'd recommend seeing it before buying it. I saw this in theaters and bought it the day after it came out on dvd.
I can't really say that if your Western fan that this is for you, but I cant say that if your not that it is either, so just see it for yourself and be the one to judge.",1077926400,6,1286,4.384937238493724
1511091,3,B00005JMPT,"Ron Howard's THE MISSING presents Tommy Lee Jones and Cate Blanchett in a Western abduction story so utterly conventional that it could have been written by a computer.  Imagine (if you dare) John Ford's THE SEARCHERS spliced together with TV's ""Doctor Quinn, Medicine Woman.""  The only thing lifting it out of the abyss of such mediocrity is an astonishing performance by Eric Schweig.
Previously admired for his performance as Uncas in Michael Mann's THE LAST OF THE MOHICANS, Schweig here plays the Apache sorcerer whose kidnappings set the plot in motion.  As the brujo, Chidin, he seems like an irresistable force of nature, unpredictable as a tornado and overwhelming as a tidal wave.  Schweig's performance is in the same class as Anthony Hopkins's portrayal of Hannibal Lector: equally powerful and chilling, and maybe even more convincing.
Val Kilmer in a brief cameo and Jenna Boyd as young Dot also give good performances, and it's even more fun than usual to watch Jones's schtick, but decent--even extraordinary--performances are not enough to overcome a hackneyed script and workmanlike but uninspired direction. Three stars.",1077926400,,1139,5.276243093922652
1511092,4,B00005JMPT,"I wasn't really sure of what to expect when I first started watching ""The Missing"" but I'm glad I rented it as it's not really worth buying. While good, this is one of those films that you only need to watch once.
Tommy Lee Jones is always an interesting actor to behold onscreen and Cate Blanchett is one of my favorite actresses. I trust in her judgment of picking excellent roles and this is no exception. She does a convincing job at playing Maggie: a Christian ""healer"" who aids the ill in the wilderness of rural New Mexico. She lives a humble life until all is shattered when the man she loves and her two daughters fail to return from a cattle drive. Maggie goes looking for them and finds Brake dead and a frightened Dot (the youngest) who comes out of her hiding place, crying about someone having taken Lily.
The movie is pretty much based upon finding her. Savage Indians who are kidnapping innocent young girls to sell at the market abducted her and since the police or the army aren't willing to do much, the mother is determined to find Lily herself so she reluctantly agrees to let her estranged father, who's suddenly returned after so many years of wrongful doings, help in her quest. She is forced to put aside all the disdainful feelings directed towards the hurt he's caused her in the past for she knows she needs his assistance in order to return Lily home, and alive.
The storyline is a little weak and tends to be predictable at times but the performances were all well done and I especially enjoyed Dot, who truly stole the spotlight, insisting that she doesn't get left behind and that she goes with them to find her sister. The villain is an evil witch (or brujo) who possesses many demonic powers but I'm a little baffled as to why the previews and plot descriptions lead you to believe that he's a shape-shifter? Nowhere in this movie does he take another form. He is, however, scum of the earth and you can't hold back from wanting him to pay for all the wicked, cowardly things he's done.
""The Missing"" has its flaws and it probably could have been a much more suspenseful thriller but it has many great moments and the cinematography and music by composer James Horner are absolutely gorgeous.",1077840000,,2226,4.539800995024875
1511093,4,B00005JMPT,"The problem is not that ""The Missing"" is 135-minutes long.  I have no problem with long movies.  The problem with director Ron Howard's 2003 film is that the pacing is so slow.  This may well be the most leisurely chase film every made.  The situation, as you should know from the trailer, is that young Lily Gilkeson (Evan Rachel Wood) is abducted by someone wearing a hood.  With the local sheriff (Clint Howard) and the army (Val Kilmer) unwilling or unable to lend help, Maggie Gilkeson (Cate Blanchett) has to rely on her estranged father, Samuel Jones (Tommy Lee Jones).  Eventually we learn that he abandoned his family a long time ago to live with the Indians and basically throw his life away.  With her father and her younger daughter, Dot (Jenna Boyd), Maggie heads off to bring Lily back.
Every time there is a story in the news today about a kid being abducted we always here about how those first few hours are critical.  In ""The Missing"" the searchers even have the advantage of knowing where Lily is being taken, but this does not spur them to any great effort.  Granted, it is nice to see that Maggie does not become a hysterical wreck given what has just happened (there was more than an abduction involved in the violence), but certainly she should be a bit more frantic.  Yes, the Indians they are tracking are taking their time picking up more young girls to sell across the border, but Maggie and her party do not know this.  To my way of thinking they should be moving fast, pausing for the briefest of rests (tie Dot to her saddle if they need to), and certainly not stopping to bury anybody.  By the time Samuel declares there is no time to stop for water, we are almost two hours into the film.
On the one hand it is hard to believe that this trio is going to bring back Lily alive, but one aspect of ""The Missing"" that I liked was how rescue plans keep getting messed up, especially with Lily being both the victim and the cause of such circumstances.  How realistic you find the bravery of the three Gilkeson women to be for the time and place is open to debate as well, as are the various ways in which ""The Missing"" is an old-fashioned western with modern sensibilities.  Of course in addition to the rescue mission there is the gulf that needs to be bridged between father and daughter.  We keep waiting to find out what Samuel's Chiricahua name Chaa-duu-ba-its-iidan means, because it clearly is going to provide insight into the story of how he has come to throw away his life.
The biggest surprise to me in the film was Eric Schweig.  I knew he was in the film and was keeping an eye out for the actor who had played Uncas in ""The Last of the Mohicans.""  It was only after the film was over that I discovered Schweig was playing Chidin, the Apache brujo (male witch), who took Lily and the other girls that his group of renegade Apache cavalry scouts is taking to Mexico to sell.  Even watching the movie again and knowing that is Schweig underneath that makeup, I still just do not see it.  That must be why they call it acting, especially what he is doing with his eyes.  Chidin is a whirlwind of cruelty and violence, which is why his magic as a brujo is so strong and which also serves to underscore that an old man, a woman, and a kid should not be able to take him down.  For so much of the film Chidin is ahead of the game and it seems the only reason he loses in the end is because the script says that he does.
Cinematographer Salvatore Totino clearly favors a palette of blue and white to contrast with the browns in this film.  The result is a rather odd looking western, although beyond the idea that it has something to do with these color choices I cannot really explain the feeling.  The performances are certainly competent enough, but that is hardly surprising given the cast.  Perhaps the point here is that the Western is back as a genre, at least to the point where we have more than great films like ""Dances With Wolves"" and ""Unforgiven,"" and now are back to having average films like ""The Missing"" as well.",1077840000,18,4062,4.406961178045515
1511094,3,B00005JMPT,"The first minutes of this film were kind of tedious to me. The overacting was a bit too much (especially from the youngest daughter). However, soon I was hooked. Generally movies tend to start out strong and weaken. This started out weak and gathered strength. Despite the overacting, I also don't think the slang or accents were appropriate for the time period. Tommy Lee Jones gives a wonderful performance as a ""pretend"" Indian. I am suprised there is not a backlash against this film over stereotyping.
The photography and costumes were exceptional. Although the editing seemed a bit choppy. The voice dubbing was off as well. Despite all this it still entertained me and reminded me of the old-fashioned movies that didn't depend on special effects.

1511097,5,B00005JMPT,"THE MISSING poses a real dilemma to the average western movie fan.  Unlike shoot-em-up extravaganzas like TOMBSTONE and ONCE UPON A TIME IN THE WEST and antihero classics like THE WILD BUNCH and UNFORGIVEN, this movie is about a variety of more subtle thoughtful themes.  It's about family ties and the fact that they can be sustained and resurrected even after years of separation.  It's speaks much about the harshness of the American West, how fleeting life truly was and just how callused and tough you had to be to survive.
Some have criticized this movie as having no plot or story and that the powerful acting of a marvelous cast and the superb talents of a directing genius are all that carries it.  Rubbish!  As already stated this is not your typical western.  Look to the story that just happens to be set in the west and past it and you will find a compelling drama that will have you coming back again and again.
Tommy Lee Jones stars as Samuel Jones, an estranged father who abandoned his white family to ""follow the hawk"" as he explains to his embittered daughter Magdalena Gilkeson (Cate Blanchett).  When Maggie's oldest daughter, Lilly (Evan Rachel Wood) is stolen by a maniacal Apache ""brujo"" or witch (Eric Schweig), a man of consummate hatred and evil, Maggie discovers that, despite here hatred for her father, he is the only one upon whom she can count to retrieve her daughter.  Not local law.  Not the army.  Only the father whom she cannot trust.
THE MISSING is a wonderful movie, beautifully staged and shot.  Tommy Lee Jones and Cate Blanchett are splendid.  Eric Schweig is diabolical as one of the most heinous characters you will ever see in a movie.  Jenna Boyd stars as the spirited Dot, Maggie's youngest daughter. Terrific performances by Evan Rachel Wood, Val Kilmer and Steve Reevis.

1511098,3,B00005JMPT,"A fictional period story of young widow and single mother Maggie Gilkeson (Cate Blanchett) raising her two daughters in the desolate, rural 19th century Mexican border landscape among the Indian renegades and open wilderness. There she needs her present man (Aaron Eckhart) and must rely on her errant father (Tommy Lee Jones) to survive when her domestic life takes on a sudden fateful turn.
There has been some mixed reviews here but I do observe a few points of view regardless of the votes. The historical justice has to be counted in if you ever find yourself gut-wrenching over those brutal kidnapping or slaughtering scenes, as T. Tzanopoulos already said it loud and clear. Equally, the empathizing concern needs to be brought to light for native American origins and strong single parents like Janet Passow.
Thus, this film does exist for good. THREE and A HALF brilliant stars.

7940284,2,B00005JMPT,"So, Samuel Jones (Tommy Lee Jones) is the long lost father of Maggie (Cate Blanchett), who is a healer and mother of two daughters. Sam returns for healing (physical on the surface, but a later reveal is that it's spiritual, too). Lily lets Sam know early on that she wants nothing to do with him and, along with her ranch hand, Brake, with his gun in hand, sends her father on his merry way. Sam ends up in the local jail, which is rather convenient, because while the ranch hand, another guy, and Maggies two daughters go off, the oldest, Lilly, gets kidnapped by some renegade Native Americans. I've always hated the term 'renegade Indians' or a similar terms used, because it's used to label/slander those who wouldn't meekly go along with their own systematic oppression. Anyway, the Brake and the other man are killed and the youngest and highly annoying daughter, Dot, survives by hiding. Maggie stumbles upon the murder scene and Dot, who tells what happensed. Maggie goes to the local authorities to get help, but all they could muster is a wire. But, she finds her father in the cell and, after his release, he shows up to her ranch to help her track her daughter. He conveys that Lilly and other girls are being taken to Mexico to be sold into slavery.  Now, the movie is too long for me to give a blow-by-blow, so I will just get to the unrealistic things and things that bothered me:

Both of the daughters annoyed me to no freaking end. I guess they were supposed to be strong and tough, but they ended up being too stupid to live (TSTL), really. Let's start with Dot, who impressed me as a brat to the nth power. First, she insists on going with her mother and grandfather to find her missing sister. Because she's a stubborn child, they felt it warranted allowing her to go with them on a very dangerous mission to rescue Lilly from several vicious and dangerous men, led by a brujo (male witch). Given what they experienced, there's no way a child that age would have survived such an encounter. Ah, but Hollywood.... During the tracking of the men, at a time when she needs to be sitting still, and focusing, Dot decides to pick up some binoculars and, as a result, gives away their position. How about NO ONE reprimands her!! Then again, if they were dumb enough to allow a young child to tavel with them across dangerous land to track down many dangerous men, I guess there's no room to talk when it comes to dumb decisions.

Now, at least I can blame some of the youngest daughter's mess ups on age. The oledst daughter? Not so much. The first is when she is about to escape and makes the dumb decision to try to help a woman who's young child has died during the capture. The woman CLEARLY shows she's not in her right mind because she insists that her clearly-dead child is 'sleeping.' What does Lilly do?  She not only wastes time and energy trying to convince the woman to come along, but she hands the woman with the dead child the gun to serve as a lookout.  Does Lilly even ask the woman if she could shoot?  Nope, because that would be too sensible. And even before asking the woman if she could should, how about doing a reality check and noticing that the woman is obviously unhinged? So, while TSTL Lilly is untying a getaway horse, the woman manages to get some temporary clarity and shoots herself. Of course, the bandits wake up and recapture Lilly. Now THAT was a reality that I appreciated. The next TSTL moment is when an Native American guy, who's helping Lilly's grandfather and seeking to also rescue his son's betrothed, tries to rescue her. What does she do when she sees him waving her mother's cross as a means of showing he's a friend? Screams like a banshee. So, the Indian guy is immediately captured by the renegades and brutally hacked to death. Because Lilly was so badass (sarcasm), as all three of the women are portrayed. The Native American betrothed is recaptured and, although she doesn't speak English, gives Lilly a piece of her mind. Now, HERE is where I'd have been okay if reality was suspended and the Native American girl was able to speak English clearly and long enough for Lilly to hear what she was saying.  Anyway, there is a mix of losses and happily ever afters, but I just found it all unrealistic, I mean, how much ammo do they REALLY have and how is it, with more guns against you than you have against others, does Sam, Maggie, and Dot manage to not get shot?  And when the remaining bandits go after the girls, there's like 12 people on 12 horses and all the bandits manage to shoot is one horse. Are they reallyl that bad at shooting when they have a vantage point so high up in the mountain. And, of course, I won't even get started on the stereotypes. Ugh!

I gave it two starts because there was some action, athough highly unrealistic (that rescue scenario- bogus) and I also don't want to feel too bad for wasting time I can never get back.",1514332800,,4922,4.46607341490545
7940285,5,B00005JMPT,"This is a gripping, though somewhat melodramatic Western tale where the forces of good, sometimes manifest in flawed individuals,  meets pure evil and ultimately triumphs, but not before the evil forces have wreaked considerable damage. The mystical, evil nature of the antagonist in the movie gives it a  considerable edge, and  the band of malevolent Indians and whites fomenting all the murder and destruction are ultimately killed or dispersed, but, unfortunately,  most of the good Indians get killed off also, which might be a touchy issue in today's hypersensitive culture. Cate Blanchet and Tommy Lee Jones are superlative in the lead roles, but that is to be expected by these two consummate masters of their craft.
