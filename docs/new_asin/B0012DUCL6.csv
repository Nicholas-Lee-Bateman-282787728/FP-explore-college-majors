8245210,2,B0012DUCL6,I found this documentary rather dull.  It moved slower than the speed of the Chobe River!  I certainly was not interested in visiting the nature park after viewing the video.,1463702400,,174,4.766666666666667
8245211,1,B0012DUCL6,Boring. A good place to view this film would be sunday school.,1448323200,,62,4.25
8245212,3,B0012DUCL6,Not anywhere as good as the experience of being there,1445904000,,53,4.4

8245215,4,B0012DUCL6,"I found this film particularly enjoyable for the time and place I was at. I wanted to watch a film, yet wanted it to be suttle, undisturbing, and have some soothing music.  Those elements were there in this documentary.  I have seen many African Wildlife films, yet most attempt you to be engaged, rather than ""just be"".  This was perfect.  The moderator's voice meshed right in with the music.",1398556800,,394,4.666666666666667
8245216,1,B0012DUCL6,Weak film making. Not much beauty or action. Mainly lot of annoying talk pumping it up as great tourist destination.,1392595200,2,116,4.85
8245217,5,B0012DUCL6,It's very informative and colorful. I love nature and I'm adding this to my personal collection. I hope you enjoy!,1381968000,,114,4.75
8245218,2,B0012DUCL6,"I know Chobe.  I've been there several times and even run a blog on the park [...].  I was excited about getting this DVD to share some of the park with friends and relatives.  This DVD is a slow, plodding review of the park and options around Kasane.  This is clearly not a wildlife video.  It is also not a 'how to do Chobe right' video.  Basically it seemed like a long version of a trip through Chobe, not much better than similar home made videos of the park on YouTube.  It lacks good info on transportation, guide options, stores/crafts and (maybe most importantly )the diverse wildlife of the region.

If I had seen this video prior to my first trip to Chobe .... I probably would have gone to another wildlife reserve.  That would have been a pity as Chobe may be the best location for the money in the world to see and photograph a wide variety of game from a close vantage point.",1262736000,,890,4.313253012048193
8245219,2,B0012DUCL6,"It is a pity that this video shows a lot of lodges, but very few elephants.

Having been to the Chobe national park, I remembered very well the elephants there,
walking in great groups and swimming in the river.
So to see that again I bought this video.
It took quite some time before the first elephant came into view, time spent by showing a lot of lodges, water and trees.
At the end of the movie a group of elephants was shown wading thru the river, but they were NEVER shown swimming.

So: if you expect to see the real highlights of Chobe national park: DO NOT BUY this video",1261353600,2,581,4.225225225225225
