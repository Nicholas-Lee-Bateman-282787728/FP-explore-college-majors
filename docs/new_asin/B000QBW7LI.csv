2835116,5,B000QBW7LI,"Gurdjieff's Mission

A riveting recounting of what Gurdjieff's purpose was! The tale is told in an entertaining fashion while retaining all the factual evidence available.

I was taken to many places and introduced to those who played a part in the gripping story of how a great teacher worked to establish the teaching he brought. The footage both live and archival varies in presentation so that my interest was peaked. The on scene videos from New York to Russia interspersed with period and contemporary photographs give a real sense of the places Gurdjieff lived and worked.

The narrative and music combined to give me a feeling of what Gurdjieff went through. Factual and interpretations of what information is available, and what is missing, are artfully woven through the pictorial journey. The speculation is made clear, and supporting reasoning given so the bare facts are given greater depth and wider meaning.

I highly recommend this video.",1190332800,3,954,5.135483870967742

With scenes shot in France, England and the U.S., Gurdjieff is seen in reduced circumstances but with a new direction. His work and relationships with Ouspensky, Bennett, and Orage are scrutinized.
The video follows Gurdjieff's many trips to New York, his meetings with Orage's students, and his own teaching in Paris.  Before and during the war -- under German occupation, he has begun to teach in small groups while working on his magnum opus, All and Everything.

In his final days after the war we him when his older students return and he occupies himself with many trips around France, and we are given a look at the caves of Lascaux, .which he visited before his death in 1949.",1190246400,,933,4.886075949367089

The title, Gurdjieff's Legacy, is very appropriate because the video describes what Gurdjieff has bequethed us - All and Everything, his music, the movements and sacred dances and exercises - and raises the question of how we can transition this teaching into the post 9/11 world.",1189728000,,416,5.208955223880597

The video began with a near fatal car crash.  It was about relationships ending, disappointments, people dying and Gurdjieff himself dying but it was about so much more.

He was a man on a mission, shown here with great intensity and sincerity.

2835120,5,B000QBW7LI,"Gurdjieff's Legacy is the third and final DVD in the series The Life
and Significance of George Ivanovich Gurdjieff. The DVD begins with
the car crash that nearly killed him and ends at Gurdjieff's death.
In some ways for those in the work today this is the most relevant of
the three as it provides an understanding of how and why the work is
structured in the way it has been since Gurdjieff's death.

It is quite interesting and important that through out the DVD
Patterson uses the recurring image of Gurdjieff's All and Everything
and particularly his difficult yet wonderful Beelzebub's Tales. This,
as Patterson states, is the vehicle, the legomonism, which Gurdjieff
choose to thrust and preserve his teaching of the Fourth Way into the
future.  This DVD well documents and explores the failure of Gurdjieff
to find a suitable disciple to, as Patterson says, ""Step down the
teaching."" In exploring this we are given vivid revelations and
descriptions of the three remarkable men, Ouspenski, Orage and
Bennett, all of whom were, at various times, given this opportunity
and for different reasons were unable to take it upon themselves.
Their inability to accept this is explored in Work terms as these men
and others are unmasked in their full humanity with fairness and
understanding.  I would highly recommend this DVD for both students of
the Work and those who have as yet have only an intellectual interest
in Gurdjieff's teaching.

For those who have knowledge of and interest in Gurdjieff and his
teaching, the Fourth Way, I would highly recommend the entire trilogy
of DVD's, collectively titled The Life and Significance of George
Ivanovich Gurdjieff.  Patterson and his colleagues have managed to
capture both flavor and substance in this important  and unique addition to the body of works related to
Gurdjieff and the Fourth Way",1189209600,,1847,5.0

Gurdjieff's Legacy Part III
Establishing The Teaching in the West 1924-1929

Reviewed by Ann Lark, Half Moon Bay, CA  (5 stars)

The responsibilities and obstacles G.I. Gurdjieff faced in the last twenty-five years of his life are palpably felt in this, the third and concluding installment in the extraordinary documentary trilogy, The Life and Significance of George Ivanovitch Gurdjieff.

From his near fatal car crash in 1924 to the closing of his long-sought Institute at the Prieure, one can acutely feel writer, director and narrator William Patrick Patterson's compassion for the spiritual messenger, G. I. Gurdjieff, and in turn Gurdjieff's compassion for humanity; witness Gurdjieff's Legominism, All and Everything.

Gurdjieff's Legacy and the other two videos in the trilogy are worthy companions to the film Meetings With Remarkable Men.",1192838400,,908,5.591240875912408
2835126,5,B000QBW7LI,"Gurdjieff's Legacy:

A friend of mine, who knew of my interest in Egyptian culture, turned me on to ""Gurdjieff in Egypt"", a documentary about G.I. Gurdjieff's search for ancient wisdom. After seeing this impressive story, I became interested in Gurdjieff and discovered that this doc was part of a trilogy. So I purchased the other two.
Wow!

This review is about the third part, ""Gurdjieff's Legacy"".

After having searched for ancient knowledge and establishing his teaching near Paris (described in the first two parts), Gurdjieff had to struggle not only with the material aspects of life - war, governments, money, his health, etc.; but also with the deep rooted tendencies of his students. Failing this, he turned to writing a ""Legominism"" - a means of transmitting knowledge through time.

The creator and narrator, William Patrick Patterson tells the gripping story of Gurdjieff's life at it's end.  No sentimentality, no emotional gambits, no dramatic fluff that hampers contemporary documentary efforts.

I highly recommend this video and the other two as well. After all, it is one big story!",1192406400,3,1103,5.203389830508475
2835127,5,B000QBW7LI,"Gurdjieff's Legacy extends the history presented in Gurdjieff's Mission and expands the themes explored there. Though the ""PR"" may be that Gurdjieff moved in a straight line toward his aims, the truth is that there were a number of setbacks, not least the failure of his ""senior students"" to transmit the teaching without distortion (and without their ""chief feature"" interfering). This documentary traces Gurdjieff's intense work to establish the teaching, with supporting footage from Paris to London to New York.  It documents his near-fatal car crash, the closing of the Prieur, the writing of All and Everything, the groups established during the Nazi occupation of Paris, and his trip to the now-closed caves of Lascaux.

The underlying thread is the place of All and Everything, particularly the First Series (Beelzebub's Tales to His Grandson) in providing a touchstone to any seriously interested student.

This DVD release incorporates a significant re-editing of the original VHS version.",1192233600,5,999,5.432258064516129
2835128,5,B000QBW7LI,"Gurdjieff's Legacy

This is the third film in a trilogy on the Life and Significance of George Ivanovich Gurdjieff. We are introduced to life at the Prieure, where Mr. Gurdjieff opened his Institute for the Harmonious Development of Man. We meet Jean Toomer, Alfred Orage and other students and visitors who worked closely with Gurdjieff during this time. The film addresses and offers an answer to a question probably every Gurdjieff reader/student has asked at one time, ""How could a spiritual teacher who taught methods of escaping from the law of accident and other laws which govern life on Earth become a victim of an accident himself?"" Mr. Patterson offers a perspective that is both insightful, credible and, to seasoned Gurdjieff students, most probable. This documentary encourages us to go beyond our idealistic imagination in asking, Who is Mr. Gurdjieff? Called unknowable by many of his students, this well researched film leaves us a little more familiar with the human side of Mr. Gurdjieff. Equally important, we are encouraged to distinguish between what we call a book and Mr. Gurdjieff's Legominism ""All and Everything.""",1192147200,,1140,5.195652173913044

Ouspensky, A.R. Orage, and J.G. Bennett.  Once again, Mr. Patterson pieces together much of what was written by these students, not just in published works, but in personal notes, diaries, letters, and such, to give more complete and palpable insights on their experiences, understandings/misunderstandings, and reactions to Mr. Gurdjieff. I think that Mr. Patterson demonstrates core Work ideas well in his narrative and examples.

8195354,5,B000QBW7LI,"I found this DVD, the third in the trilogy, to be the most intensely personal and moving of the three. In it the narrator, William Patrick Patterson, provides a history and context for understanding the creation of Gurdjieff's masterpiece, All and Everything. The film begins at the site of Gurdjieff's car crash outside of Paris in 1924, after which he decided to stop teaching and began to write. Patterson explains that the books Gurdjieff wrote are what he called Legominisms, a work intended to transfer esoteric knowledge undistorted through time. Now I know why the first book, in particular, was written in dense, complicated sentences, with bizarre vocabulary and a complexity that doesn't allow you to get comfortable. Having struggled myself to read All and Everything, I find it reassuring to learn that my emotional reactions and struggles were exactly what Gurdjieff intended.",1205280000,,890,5.230769230769231

The Second World War and the Occupation of Paris were obvious obstacles, but an even greater obstacle to Gurdjieff's stepping down his teaching was committed students. Ouspensky, Orage, and Bennett all abandoned Gurdjieff and he was left with naught but to create All and Everything. William Patrick Patterson, as in the other two videos he created, tells the story impartially and clearly, backing his narration up with historic documents from students, and fleshing the story out with compelling imagery. Watching this video makes me realize that Patterson's video trilogy is a work of art in its own right, one that requires attention and makes a deep impression: One feels for Mr. Gurdjieff's efforts; the energy required to bring his teaching to the West are insurmountable by any ordinary person. However difficult my little life may be, I do not live under these conditions with a life's mission so critical to humanity to realize. For this, there is a respect and gratitude both to Mr. Gurdjieff for having brought this teaching and to Mr. Patterson who has bravely and beautifully presented it.",1201478400,,1248,5.152709359605911
8195357,5,B000QBW7LI,"The third and final volume in the series The Life and Significance of George Ivanovich Gurdjieff, Gurdjieff's Legacy begins with Gurdjieff's car crash, the event that caused him to dramatically change his course of establishing the teaching for future generations. Whereas before, he had concentrated on training ""helper-instructors"" and having students at his Harmonious Development of Man in Fountainebleau-en-Avon, he realized that such training would not give the necessary results in the time that was given. Beginning the writing of his book All and Everything, Gurdjieff hoped it would act as a means of transmitting the teaching on a much wider scale.

Still looking at the student-teacher relationship, the viewer is introduced to the many groups and ways in which Gurdjieff worked with his students, including the Rope, his women's group; travels to the caves of Lascaux; voyages to America; and the meetings given in wartime Paris.  Again, the music of Gurdjieff and Thomas de Hartman is used to stirring effect.

George Ivanovitch Gurdjieff, the enigmatic Spiritual Master of the 20th century, had a great Aim: to promote world harmony in order to save mankind from self- destruction. By discovering and reformulating a seminal, powerful, self-supporting ancient teaching that shows the way to this harmony, his mission was to save man from itself in this crucial point of human development. Narrated by William Patrick Patterson, this third and last in the video trilogy begins with an event that changed the direction of Mr.  Gurdjieff's mission, as he begins to write his Legominism, his magnum opus, All and Everything, unclassifiable by normal standards and a spiritual work of such magnitude that it could only be described as a masterpiece.  This video spends much time exploring All and Everything, the difficulties inherent in interpreting it as well as the riches that lie beneath the sometimes incomprehensible language. We meet fascinating students, and continue to explore the complex teacher/student relationship integral to the establishment of the Teaching. One feels an almost personal connection to these people, as the narration is rich and full of direct quotes and photographs. There's a solid sense of history, of time and place. World War II rages in the background. One is struck by the irony of the self-destruction going on all around, as the very teaching that is being practiced is to reverse this horrible tendency of mankind to destroy itself.
In this final video of the trilogy, we have a real sense of the importance of this great man and what he gave to mankind. William Patrick Patterson speaks directly to the viewer, as if in dialogue.

  After the completion of his writing he began an all women's group known as The Rope.  The war and the Nazi occupation of Paris ended that group but soon weekly meetings were held at great personal risk.
  With the war having ended and the death of Ouspensky many students returned to Paris.  The last two years of Gurdjieff's life laid foundation for dissemination of The Fourth Way teaching in the west.
