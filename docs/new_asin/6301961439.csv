385367,4,6301961439,"My Best Friend (""Mon Meilleur Ami"") (2007) From IFC Entertainment Films, directed by Patrice Leconte. With: Daniel Auteuil as Francois Coste, and Dany Boon as Bruno.
Auteuil reprises his role as a man with a frozen heart (as in ""Un Coeur en Hiver""), this time being unable to care for anyone outside himself--in fact he only cares for the things he collects. His business partner (Julie Gayet) tells him so, so he decides--and becomes determined--to acquire a friend In a few days. He has no idea how to go doing this, but his friendly taxi driver, Bruno, gives him a few hints--be sincere, smile, etc.,--but Francois fails dismally, failing even to connect with his own daughter. He is a ruthless auctioneer, and at one of the auctions the film shows, he purchases a Greek vase showing Achilles and Patroclus, friends on all counts. Bruno, meanwhile, has his own problems: he has been collecting a different sort of things: facts. He is a fact freak, hoping one day to get to a game show, such as Jeopardy, with Alex Trebek, who is his hero.  His problem is that he freezes during interviews, going into uncontrollable anxiety attacks. When he finds out that Francois tries to trick him, in a rage he breaks the valuable vase Francois purchased, but it turns out it was a fake. The real one has been kept back by Gayet, and is restored to Francois, who opts to give to a collector with clout, for the man has a syndicated TV show, and secures a post for Bruno to make an appearance.

It's all very French, but also showing the influence of American TV game shows on the world.  Bruno gets a ""hot seat"" in the French version of ""How to be a Millionaire,"" and at the crucial moment, when he is about to win a million euros, he calls Francois, his last lifeline. Francois hesitates, but answers the call, and Bruno wins the million.  Naturally, he remains a cab driver, for that is all he knows to do.  He too has won a friend.

A bit corny, but wittingly French, and, though popular fare, in the last analysis shows how a heart can be ""unfrozen."" You don't win friends and influence people by just smiling, or just being sincere and friendly--you do so after a serious commitment?  Is that what this movie says? No matter.  It is highly entertaining, and even a bit moving, thanks mostly to the performance of Auteuil, who has a daughter too, who eventually has a crush on Bruno, what goes around comes around. This is all seems too American to me, though the French do game shows better (I think), but I enjoyed the movie.  Cell phones, talk shows, euros, that's modern France, partly gone USA. A far cry from the portentous, if not pretentious movies of Godard and the rest of them--good bye Nouvelle Vague.",1195516800,,2708,4.56701030927835
385368,5,6301961439,"MON MEILLEUR AMI (MY BEST FRIEND) is a gift from France to movie lovers. Though it can be considered a 'comedy' in the French tradition, it is also a fine examination of the importance of friendship in a world too cluttered with 'acquaintances' passing as friends.  Just what a 'friend' means is only one important message of this lovely film: the manner through which we identify meaningful relationships is the other.

Writer/Director Patrice Laconte (Intimate Strangers, The Man on the Train, The Widow of Saint-Pierre, The Girl on the Bridge, Tango, The Hairdresser's Husband, Monsieur Hire, etc) knows how to take an idea and allow it to blossom without distortion or preaching.  He understands the intimacy of friendships and knows how to draw superlative performances from his actors - an obvious extension of the concept of friendship!

Franois Coste (Daniel Auteuil) is an antiquities dealer with his lesbian partner Catherine (Julie Gayet), and while Franois is a successful businessman, he is a self-centered isolationist who has never been able to make or retain friends, a fact that is put before him at the scantily attended funeral of an associate.  Franois and Catherine attend an auction where Franois pays a high price for an antique Greek vase, a receptacle  for the tears of an ancient man's friend.  This purchases encourages Catherine to challenge Franois to a bet: Franois must introduce to Catherine a 'best friend' within ten days or the vase belongs to her.  Franois, oblivious to the fact that he is completely without friends (including his own daughter Louise - Julie Durand), accepts the challenge and so the search for friends begins. Franois exhausts his possibilities, all the while being driven about Paris by a loquacious taxi driver 'Balanchine'/Bruno Bouley (Dany Boon) who has his own problems: he has worked all his life to prepare for a fact-answering position on a television game show, but suffers from a severe case of nerves when before a crowd.  Very gradually the two men bond and Franois realizes Bruno is the closest thing he has to a friend.  A plan is hatched which will apparently benefit both men's weaknesses, but as life often does, surprises alter the plans. How the film ends is so tender that sharing it would destroy the fluid progression of Leconte's storytelling.

Both Auteuil and Boon are superb in the leading roles and yet every minor role is in the hands of the cream of France's crop of supporting actors.  The pacing of the film, the cinematography, the musical score, and the script are perfectly melded. Yet it is the magic hand of Patrice Laconte that makes this movie understated and wholly credible, allowing the audience to relate to the sensitive weaknesses of the two men and grow into their tenuous relationship.  It is a joy to watch and remember.  Grady Harp, November 07",1194048000,7,2849,4.970526315789474
385369,3,6301961439,"Like another reviewer I saw this in an art house with two people in the audience. The acting in this film is generally superb, but Patrice Leconte's script and direction take the life out of this film. I know I am not the only one to think Leconte is terribly overrated. Auteuil, on the other hand, is the finest actor of our time. He performs wonderfully in this film. Too bad more of his films can't be seen in America because Americans won't watch films with subtitles. The French can be horridly pretentious and condescending, but at least they have the best actor in the film world who Americans have a difficult time seeing because of their philistine attitude to subtitles (and to a film in a foreign language).",1188777600,,718,4.573643410852713
385370,5,6301961439,"""My Best Friend"" could have been maudlin (in the hands of a less talented foreign director) or irritatingly over-the top (in he hands of a less talented American director. Instead it is a believable and charming look at friendship in the 21st century, and the lengths to which some will go to get it.

Francois Coste (Daniel Auteuil) is a Parisian dealer in Art Deco antiques. He is completely focused on his business, and on the accumulation of goods. Evidently, this monomania has come at the expense of family, friendships and business ethics - has gained him the notoriety of being a man who has no friends. At a restaurant gathering on his birthday, his associates tell him bluntly that when he dies, there will be exactly zero people at his funeral. Coste can't accept this and claims to have many friends. He is challenged by his business partner (whose sexual preference he does not even know) to prove this. He has 10 days to prove that he is not totally bereft of friends.

Bruno Bouley (Balanchine in the English version) is a voluble and warmhearted taxi driver - the kind who rattles off historical details as he drives his fares around town. Bouley has tried to make his talent pay off by appearing on French TV game shows, but his extreme nervousness keeps him from being chosen as a contestant.

One day, these two meet, and after a certain amount of skittishness, Costes decides that this hyper-extraverted cab driver could be his ticket to winning his bet. He engages him to teach him to be friendly.

The film could have taken many paths, but trod one of believability and pathos. Auteuil played Costes marvelously as a man who is seemingly pleasant outwardly, but whose actions, though not evil or outrageous in themselves, pile on one another over time to revealed a character who was toxic and uncaring. Boon played Bouley as the classic lost soul - talented, sensitive and warm - who could neither capitalize on his skill nor find solace among his own acquaintances.

""My Best Friend"" is engaging, real, funny and often poignant. The plot line is tight, providing plausible limits and rationales for character actions. There is smart use of a Greek vase depicting the friendship of Achilles and Patroclus -- an object that becomes the unexpected focus of Costes's attention and a key element in the film. The emotional heat of ""My Best Friend"" is always set on low. But like Costes's many business acquaintances, viewers will find themselves pulling for him, hoping that he will find it in himself to be less ""d&eacute;testable"" - another French word that needs no translation - and more ""sympathique"" or likable - a quality that Costes sought throughout this wonderful film.",1188604800,95,2698,4.818574514038877
385371,3,6301961439,"My Best Friend isn't Patrice Leconte's best and it's probably not as funny as it could be, but it's so amiable that it really doesn't matter. It's a redemption comedy, with Daniel Auteuil's antique dealer so disinterested in the people around him that he doesn't even know that his business partner is a lesbian and is amazed to find that he has no friends, merely contacts. Challenged to present his mythical best friend by the end of the month or lose a valuable vase, he sets about an increasingly desperate search that takes in strangers in the street and even a former classmate to all-too predictable results before hiring Danny Boon's personable cabdriver to show him how to make friends, oblivious to the fact that Boon doesn't seem to have any friends either.

No prizes for guessing how it all works out, but it's nicely played, with Auteuil's grimly smiling desperation offset nicely by Boon's sheer sad sack likability. The Who Wants To Be a Millionaire climax is somewhat drawn out, but it's hard to dislike a film that uses one characters obsession with quiz show trivia to name check Georges Simenon, Jean Renoir and both versions of The Man Who Knew too Much.",1187481600,,1175,4.759803921568627
385372,3,6301961439,"What would you do if you found out that all of your supposed ""friends"" really didn't like you at all? What a shocking revelation this might be! Maybe to some, but if you are the arrogant,self-centered,brusque antique dealer Francois (Daniel Auteil), you take this revelation with non acceptance,denial,disbelief and view it as a wager to prove what everyone else thinks wrong! Francois encounters the all-loveable cabbie Bruno (Dany Boon) whose easy going magnetic personality is what Francois covets. Bruno's simple advice is to be ""sociable, smiling and sincere."" That's it! Easier said than done!
 I caught this little film in an arthouse recently because of my great respect and admiration of actor Daniel Auteil's body of work. His cold,unfeeling Francois seemed somewhat familiar to me as I recalled Auteil's performance as Stephane in A HEART IN WINTER (En Coeur en Hiver).

The film,though relatively enjoyable,seemed to me very unsure as to what it was supposed to be-a comedy or a drama. The premise was an interesting one, but the film ultimately left me rather flat. Some parts seemed charming and somewhat humorous, but overall I left the theatre in a very 3 star kind of mood. It was OK-not great, not rotten. Just OK.

I admit that when I noticed in the credits that Patrice Leconte was both writer and director that may have helped me to understand why I felt rather vague about MY BEST FRIEND.Apart from RIDICULE, I have never been a fan of the Leconte films I have seen (GIRL ON A BRIDGE,FELIX et LOLA,MAN ON A TRAIN to name a few),so it simply may be that Leconte is not a favorite of mine. The fact he wrote the screenplay may have been the deciding factor in why I felt so nebulous about the film. Simply personal taste.

I will admit that I have known two such people like Francois in my life. Everyone stayed close to them (I think out of fear), but most certainly not out of love! In this alone, MY BEST FRIEND will stick in my memory.",1186444800,3,1959,4.686046511627907
385373,4,6301961439,"Francois (Daniel Auteuil) has built a life without much human connection though he has an estranged daughter, Louise (Julie Durand) who lives with him and a steady lover who understands Francois better than he understands himself: she comes and goes as Francois wishes never making demands on his time or emotions. As his partner Catherine (Julie Gayet) comments: ""You have built a life of things not friends."" Appropriately enough, Francois is an antiques dealer who one day, seemingly on an impulse beyond his control buys at auction, a classical Greek vase supposedly commissioned by Achilles after the death of a dear friend in which Achilles once filled with his own tears.
Selfless friendship: an unknown quality that Francois wants to know more about particularly when Catherine bets him to produce an actual real, in the flesh friend: something that Francois has avoided his entire life.
Director Patrice Leconte has explored the dynamics of male bonding and friendship before particularly in the excellent, finely delineated ""Man on a Train.""  But here, even though Auteuil and the object of his friendship Bruno (the excellent Dany Boon) do a good job at trying to make the plot serious and meaningful, Leconte's approach is too heavy handed and clumsy: too many scenes just do not ring true; they lack the inner fire, the kind of truth that make them come alive.  Instead the denouements of most scenes fall flat and veer towards the mawkish and soap opera-like.
With all of that said, there is an undeniable thoughtfulness and caring in Dany Boon's performance as Bruno...a taxi driver who has memorized thousands of unrelated facts, failed at marriage yet not failed at life: he is alive with the stuff necessary to allow him easy access into people's lives: he is a mensch...he loves and is in return loved by all with whom he comes in contact. This is why Francois is both attracted and repulsed by him: Francois needs Bruno to fill the gaping hole in his life: a hole that for 50+ years Francois has had neither the need nor the desire to fill.
""My Best Friend"" (""Mon Meilleur Ami"") is not a perfect film but it is a good one: well acted, beautifully produced and though a noble failure, an interesting addition to the filmography of a very fine director.",1185580800,7,2271,4.865633074935401
385374,4,6301961439,"Francois (Daniel Auteuil, ""Apres Vous"", ""Jean De Florette"" and many, many other French Films), an antiques dealer, attends an auction with his business partner, Catherine (Julie Gayet). She is aghast when Francois gets into a bidding war with a television producer for an ancient Greek vase depicting the story of two friends. Francois wins the vase, and Catherine is shocked when writing out the check for such a large amount. After the auction, they attend a dinner with a group of acquaintances. Very pleased with the vase and its story, Francois turns the conversation to his new acquisition and learns he really has no friends, the acquaintances are finally fed up with Francois' arrogance and don't mince words when telling him the truth. But he won't, can't admit they are right and claims they haven't met his best friend. Catherine bets him that he can't produce this best friend within ten days. Bruno (Dany Boon, ""The Valet""), a taxi driver, works in Francois' neighborhood and takes him a few places. As they get to know one another, Francois realizes Bruno could be his ""best friend"". When he reveals the pick to Catherine, he realizes Bruno will need to make some sort of `grand gesture' to qualify. As the antiques dealer tries to figure out what this might be, he also learns more and more about his new friend. They go to a football match, they have dinner at Bruno's parent's home, he meets Francois' daughter. But will Francois recognize his genuine friendship with Bruno before he jeopardizes it?

""My Best Friend (Mon Meilleur Ami)"", the new film directed by Patrice Laconte (""The Widow of St. Pierre"", ""The Man on the Train"", ""The Girl on the Bridge"", ""Ridicule""), is yet another example of this filmmaker's skill and desire to create films about real people in real situations. Each of his films tells an interesting, believable, intensely watch able story about two or three people in a situation. Laconte does not create spectacles; he seems to be unaware of the creation of CGI and there are never any car chases in his films. Instead, his films are about people, the decisions they make, the things they do, the people they know and love.

""Friend"" tells the story of two men who form a friendship. I have become so conditioned by certain conventions in cinema that I kept waiting for the `wacky' subplot about people mistaking them for a `Gay' couple. Its such a rare thing to find a film about two guys who are friends that when we do, there is almost always some story line about people mistaking them as guy, because of course if two guys are `friends' they can only be lovers as well. It seems to make many viewers uncomfortable to see two adult males as friends, which is why we almost always have films about three or four guys hanging out together, each of these guys representing a stereotype of the `male'. As I sat watching ""Friend"", I kept waiting for this subplot to rear its tired, overworked head. But then I had to remind myself this is a Patrice Laconte film. It won't happen. And it didn't. How refreshing. It is such a rarity in cinema today, to watch a film about two guys who are friends.

I should never have expected Laconte to use this tired clich&eacute; in his film. If anything, I should have expected just the opposite. Laconte is all about the characters. When a filmmaker devotes so much time and effort to establishing his characters and letting them drive the story, he won't (can't?) insert artificial and hokey subplots. In each of Laconte's films, he lets the relationships unwind in a natural and completely realistic way. Because this is so unusual, and something we rarely see, we consider it an exception rather than the norm. These characters are more real than just about every other character depicted on the screen.

And Francois and Bruno are no exception. Auteuil is probably the second most prolific actor in French cinema, behind only Gerard Depardieu. Because he works so much, we see him more often in the films imported from France to our country. And he is an actor with remarkable expression, charm and range. The last thing I saw him in was ""Apres Vous"", a comedy about a French waiter and some of his associates. It was fun, but uneven. Auteuil has been in a few of Laconte's previous films and I think the duo is the French equivalent of Scorsese and DeNiro. They work very well together.

Francois is an egotistical jerk who doesn't even realize the people surrounding him are keeping him company out of a sense of obligation; most are business associates and would rather not lose the income. He even treats others in this same way; he attends an associate's funeral just to get a crack at a desk the deceased owned. But when Francois insists one of them is a `best friend', they have had enough. They let him in on the truth. Francois is stunned. Auteuil reveals a lot of things in this moment; he shows Francois' shock, bewilderment, realization and more without a lot of gestures or facial movements, the overriding emotion seems to be the realization that Francois is a lonely man. And this spurs him to find a friend. Auteuil`s character is a grown man, so rather than break down and cry, he becomes determined to find someone he can label a `best friend'. This determination becomes a reality when Catherine bets him he can't produce this friend for them to see. Because Francois is so egotistical and self-involved, this seems completely natural and real for this character. The only thing that will override his shock and dismay at learning he has no friends is his determination to win the bet. He sets out to win with all of his skill, might and resolve.

As the story progresses and evolves, Auteuil's Francois remains consistent and believable.

I have not seen Boon in any previous films and he is equally good as Bruno, the taxi driver who becomes Francois personal driver and then friend, he has openness, an air that would make him susceptible to someone like Franois. Bruno is a talkative guy, well versed in facts and welcome and willing to talk to one and all. As they talk, and Bruno starts to spout random trivia, Francois learns he has studied all his life to become a contestant on a game show. The one time he earned a tryout, he became too nervous. Francois is, at first, annoyed by the talkative cabbie, but is soon won over by his openness and friendliness. When he learns of Bruno's aborted attempt to become a game show contestant, he becomes all the more intrigued.

The relationship between the two men is also key to the film's success. At first, Francois is a little put off by Bruno's friendly, open nature. For many people in large metropolitan areas, it is easier, safer to stay within your own little world and not to open up too much to strangers. Bruno is a talkative guy, trying to elicit conversation with Francois, so much so that when Francois realizes he is about to get a cab with Bruno, he keeps walking. But when he realizes Bruno could be ""the best friend"", he starts to actively pursue the relationship.

As Francois becomes more involved in Bruno's life, he slowly learns more and more about his friend. This is information that will both inform his actions and help him understand the consequences after Francois' grand gesture gimmick.

The relationship also plays out in a very realistic nature. After Francois realizes he has hurt Bruno, he learns why. And he tries to make a grand gesture of his own, to make things right. But just because this happens, it doesn't mean they are going to patch up the relationship immediately.

""My Best Friend"", which is already slated to be remade as an American film (wacky gay subplot anyone?) is a very good film exploring the relationship of two men. Two grown men who are friends. And straight as can be.",1185408000,3,7783,4.694505494505495

Francois (Daniel Auteiuil) is a self-centered antiquities dealer who has no friends.  However, he is so self-centered he doesn't realize it and thinks everyone likes him.  At a dinner party, someone suggests no one would come to his funeral as he simply has no friends, not even them.

That can't be true, he protests.  Find one friend, he is challenged by his business partner.  In 10 days.  Or he must give her an ancient Greek vase he just purchased for 200,000 euro.  The search begins for one best friend.  In desperation he asks a gregarious taxi driver (Dany Boon) to tell him how to be a friend.

I enjoyed the movie, not my all time favorite French movie, but one that I may consider recommend to friends (who are not too picky).
The story is quite basic and follow two guys of different social classes (it seems that French writers and directors have some obsession with the theme) one has no friends and the other is cheerful, joyful, friendly and open...but also lack a real friend. So you know how it goes, they meet because one needs the other for a reason (that has nothing to do with friendship), but soon they learn about each other's lives, their problems, families, etc. So they see how similar in a way they are.
Other key things happen, but I don't want to spoil the story. some situations are more realistic and believable than others, but as I said before, the acting is what saved this movie.

Francois goes on quest to find a friend, but hits dead end after dead end. All the people he considered his friend are simply acquaintances or despise him!

Eventually he encounters a lonely but sociable taxi driver, Bruno and Francois asks him to teach him to be sociable. The two develop a friendship that is unconventional.

385801,4,6301961439,"Daniel Auteuil and Danny Boon shine in this light-weight comedy by Patrice Leconte, respected French director whose works are often associated with such films with more serious themes as ""Ridicule"" and ""The Widow of Saint-Pierre."" But Leconte is no stranger to comedy as seen in his earlier films made in 70s and his ""Mon Meilleur Ami"" (""My Best Friend"") shows if he became more mature and thoughtful as director, he hasn't lost the sense of humor since then.

Daniel Auteuil is Franois, a self-centered antiques dealer who is told by his business partner Catherine (Julie Gayet) something he didn't really want to know; that is, he has no friends. No one would miss him if he was gone. Unexpectedly challenged by his most trusted partner Catherine (and other ""friends"" of his) at his own birthday party, Franois declares that he actually has a best friend and can introduce him to them in ten days.

Of course, Franois will find one eventually, but not in the way he imagined. While he gets acquainted with Bruno, a chatty and amiable taxi driver dreaming of becoming a quizmaster, and enlists the good-natured taxi driver's help, Franois realizes what most viewers know from the very beginning of the story after several unsuccessful (and hilarious) attempts to make friends.

The film's set-up part seems a bit contrived (how many of us would bet a precious Greek antique on proving our ""friendship""?) and some of the supporting characters including Franois's daughter are underdeveloped, but the fine performances from the two leads make up for them, with some nice set-pieces about the mishaps of our deluded hero, and the satisfying conclusion involving one quiz show.

Like ""The Man on the Train"" and earlier ""Tandem,"" this is basically a story about two men caught up in a strange situation. ""My Best Friend"" is much more light-hearted than the two films above, and might disappoint people who had expected something more serious, but still the film is fun and it is hard not to be impressed with the skills of the actors and director who tactfully turned this potentially depressing theme of loneliness into a life-affirming comedy drama.

Francois Coste (Daniel Auteuil) is a Parisian antiques dealer who becomes obsessed with finding a best friend after a casual acquaintance off-handedly remarks that Francois has no single person in his life who fulfills that role.  This sets Francois off on a mission to prove the acquaintance wrong, finally alighting on a gregarious taxicab driver named Bruno (Dany Boon) to instruct him on the ins and outs of how to make a lifelong buddy.

One of the drawbacks of ""My Best Friend"" is that we are required to take so much of it on faith, since Francois really doesn't seem to be all that unfriendly and unaffable a guy when you get right down to it.  We keep being told that he is cold, self-centered and heartless but, at least as portrayed by Auteuil, Francois doesn't seem to embody much in the way of those qualities - and without that crucial dimension, the movie itself fails to engage us in its premise.

""My Best Friend"" is a harmless enough little piffle, I suppose, but it's afflicted with that cutesy, self-congratulatory smugness that is the bane of so many French comedies.  Frankly, five minutes after the movie's over, we've all but forgotten we ever saw it.",1221609600,2,1182,4.713592233009709

With the exception of the long-suffering girlfriend's role, this film illustrates very universally appreciated concepts on the notion of ""friendship.""  Namely: how do you know when you actually have got one?

This movie offers a very clear and consice answer to that question.  And the response is so humorously laid out in one of the last scenes of the movie, I was literally crying from laughing so hard in the theatre.

You can easily put this film in the ""romantic comedy"" section since friendship serves as the basis for so many great loves.  This film merely singles out friendship from everything else and, then, asks us to consider not only ""who are your friends?"", but also, ""what is most important in your life?"".",1215907200,,869,4.791946308724833

At his birthday dinner with business associates, he mentions that a famous art collector had a mere 7 attendees at his funeral.  The subject turns to Francois - and the group states that Francois would be lucky to have anyone show up at his funeral - he's appalled by these remarks.  They proceed to tell him that no one really likes him outside of business dealing.  He's shocked by this harsh feedback.  His business partner proceeds to bet him that in 10 days he cannot turn up a ""best friend.""

Francois turns from his obsession with his business to deep introspection and a search for a best friend.  His parents are both dead.  He is divorced.  He does not have a relationship with his daughter.  He does not have an intimate relationship with anyone except his material ""things.""  He comes across a ""character"" driving a taxi cab who helps him with his social and friend making skills and the story moves along to a point where the cab driver becomes Francois' only friend.

Daniel Auteuil plays the role Francois magnificently.  A man of few words.  Not all that comfortable with people or in crowds - a loner most comfortable on his own - but struggles with his inability to connect with others.  You begin to get close to Francois and sympathize with his burden as the movie moves along - you can feel his discomfort and his anxiety.  Breezy, brooding film is just over 1.5 hours long.

Comedies require a well-honed script and masterful direction. Sadly, this poorly executed film has neither. Leconte, a good director in other genres, does not deliver in his comedic farces (Les Bronzes series being another example).

The comedic timing is terrible. Some jokes are telegraphed. Some are re-hashed from other movies. Others just sit there as if they were giving you time to laugh. The plot has messy subplots (the allergic daughter, the lesbian co-owner) and just does not develop or envelope the viewer. It isn't funny and it isn't believable for a second.

Compare this to any comedy by Billy Wilder (Some Like it Hot, A Foreign Afair, etc.) or by Leconte's compatriot, Francis Veber, a true GENIUS at French comedy (Le Diner de Cons, Le Placard, Les Comperes, La Chevre, La Grande Blonde, etc.) and you'll see the difference in their tight scripts, great comedic acting and timing, with each joke leading to the next one.

A rather selfish art dealer (Auteuil) has a wager with his business partner that he has a best friend.  Throughout the film, the art dealer discovers what exactly is friendship from a completely selfless taxi driver.  Now, I think part of the humor in this film is how to define friendship.  It is not as simple as you think if someone stopped you on the street.  We have all sorts of friends and the relationships are very different.  In the film, the art dealer constantly tries to understand friendship through little exercises with the taxi driver which is quite funny.

7817811,5,6301961439,"I first watched this in my ""French Cinema"" class, and loved it (and even of your French isn't great the film is understandable because they speak clearly), then I bought it to show my friends!  The movie is about a man who takes on a bet to produce a friend in 10 days.  He has no friends but he isn't a bad person, he lacks emotional
intelligence.  He observes a cab driver who befriends everyone and tries to follow his example.  Of course they become friends, but there is betrayal and redemption.  It has a happy ending, and the plot is fast paced and sophisticated against the backdrop of Paris, and it is a feast for the eyes as well as a very well made comedy!  Everyone should see this and enjoy.",1468540800,2,704,4.295454545454546
