1786595,5,B00006LPJ0,"I have watched this moive for about the past four years at Holiday time. I had it taped so I could watch it whenever I waned, but someone taped over it on me. I was extatic to find it online for under $10 (this way no one can tape over it on me). I am a huge Julie Andrews fan, so whenever I come across something with her it, I watch it. She is probably the most talented woman in the world. I reccommend this movie to couples, young and old, as well as families to watch together.",1134086400,4,482,3.9285714285714284

1786597,5,B00006LPJ0,"This is a ""keeper"".  I've watched it three or four times and enjoyed it each time.  I wish there were more movies like this to watch. The actors were superb and the scenery was just beautiful.",1125705600,12,192,4.305555555555555
1786598,5,B00006LPJ0,This is a great movie.  It's a wonderful story and Julie Andrews and James Garner have great chemistry.  It's something that the family can watch.,1123200000,9,146,4.8
1786599,5,B00006LPJ0,"One Special Night is typical of Julie Andrews and James Garner. It is a heart warming, terrific movie. I recommend it to everyone who wants to believe in people and love. Watching this movie will make you feel happy and warm inside.",1119484800,6,232,4.5476190476190474
1786600,5,B00006LPJ0,"What I love about this movie is that it is so personal (although I shouldn't assume to know):  the peanut butter by the bed, her harsh depiction of herself as a child, her description of painting and her love of trees, her beliefs in what men and woman actually are (human beings), her praying for another child and God's answer, the perception of her as ""mascaline"" stemming from her intelligence and strong will, her concern about how people perceive her, the Channel perfume.  I thank her for her vulnerability.

A scene I find most moving is her berating herself in bed, at night, alone.  Well, that and her at the hospital, listening to him say that he was at the restaurant and the looks crossing her face as her emotions fluctuate from surprise, to distrust, to disgust, and finally to that sadness which is uniquely hers.  Constantly cheering people up may have its rewards, but one must imagine the loneliness.

She and Jim obviously enjoy each other very much making the banter between them perfect.  This movie is a keeper which people, little and big, will enjoy.  It makes a great holiday tradition.",1107129600,27,1112,4.725388601036269
1786601,5,B00006LPJ0,"Julie Andrews and James Gardner are at their very best in this charming holiday tale of two lonely people finding their way to each other after the loss of their respective spouses to Alzheimer's and heart disease.  Julie plays a fiesty surgeon who values her independence.  James plays a construction foreman with a few old-fashioned notions about what women can/can't do, and the clash is inevitable!  It's hilarious, sweet, and funny all at the same time.  You'll LOVE watching this video and will surely want to add it to your personal collection.  It's a classic for Julie Andrews fans!",1060387200,129,591,4.929292929292929
1786602,5,B00006LPJ0,"Two of the beloved stars team up for a funny/romantic story (Since Victor/Victoria). Catherine (Julie Andrews) and Robert (James Garner) get stuck in a snowstorm in an cabin on Thanksgiving. I won't tell you the rest because I don't want to spoil the ending.
 Giving that this was the highest rating tv hoilday special the year it aired (1999 I think), you will see why it is a classic!
 This is a most have on dvd/vhs in you collection and you won't regret it.",1045699200,4,461,4.476190476190476
1786603,5,B00006LPJ0,"This is by far one of my favorite holiday movies!  I just caught it again (for the third time) on Lifetime, on Thanksgiving night and it was a wonderful way to wind down Thanksgiving and begin the Christmas season, as the movie takes place on Thanksgiving and ends on Christmas morning.  Julie Andrews has long been a favorite of mine and I was excited to see her reunited with James Garner.  It is obvious that they have worked together previously and their chemistry is perfect as two ""strangers in the night.""  It is charming without being overly sentimental and is just a pleasure to watch because it is so well written (you really get to know these characters within a 2-hour span)and it leaves you wanting to know more about them, more about their past and their future together.  Do yourself a favor, make a cup of tea and sit down and enjoy this most enchanting holiday movie.",1038700800,44,884,4.569620253164557
1786604,5,B00006LPJ0,A wonderful tale in classical Julie Andrews style.  Julie Andrews and James Garner make a great team in this heartwarming holiday tale about second chances in life.  They're two unlikely people who get stranded overnight in a snowstorm and discover that love CAN come again.  I taped it when it was on TV and have watched it many times since.  The tape is a must-have part of anyone's holiday collection.,1033862400,8,404,4.728571428571429

1786607,1,B00006LPJ0,"I just hated this movie.  James Garners character has a wife who has alzheimer's disease.  I found it very upsetting that his character would just forget all about his poor wife and make a date with another women he is attracted to.  It was disgusting that his children were happy about it and approved.  HEY MISTER!!! What about for better, for worse, richer, poorer, IN SICKNESS AND IN HEALTH and all that stuff?  Didnt it bother anyone else that he and his children were able to just forget all about her?  Well, it bothered me!  His wife is in nursing home dying while hes romancing Maria Von Trapp with his childrens excited blessings!  Yeh, thats REALLY ROMANTIC!  ",1517097600,,671,4.6581196581196584

1786613,5,B00006LPJ0,"Strangers in the same town, passersby, miss connecting until one fateful night puts them in the same place at the same time.  He needs a ride in a blizzard.  Against her better judgment, she offers him one and they end up in a ditch in the middle of nowhere.  They just happen to find a tractor, which they swipe, and drive to a secluded cabin where they spend the night talking until sleep overcomes them and they are finally rescued the next day.  The problem is, theres an attraction of sorts.  The problem is, hes still married.
James Garner plays Robert Woodward, a construction contractor.  Julie Andrews plays Dr. Catherine Howard, a specialist.  They aren't looking for romance.  Its debatable whether they are even suited to one another.  They bicker.  He underestimates her.  She underestimates him.  Hes an insensitive boob.  Shes a wee bit of a snob.  Theyre perfect for each other.  And heres why

When I saw this cover I knew that had to be it and I ordered it immediately.  I was not disappointed.  It is a wonderful story and it is something gentle to watch.  No bad language, no violence.

1786695,5,B00006LPJ0,"While this was a TV movie, it has more of the feel of a feature film. The two stars have great chemistry, and the story of a widow and a man losing his wife to alzheimer's is moving and poignant. The story takes a stab at the antithetical romance, but the two leads don't ""not get along"" for very long. James Garner and Julie Andrews have good screen chemistry. Their dialogue is clever and entertaining throughout, even if the plot itself is rather straightforward.

He and Julie Andrews had been in two very famous movies together: The Americanization of Emily and Victor/Victoria.

It's a lovely, quiet, dramatic, and sweet movie, with the usual storyline of two who have lost their spouses either through actual death or through dementia. This is done so well, with Garner playing the husband of a wife in dementia and Ms. Andrews still grieving the loss of her husband.

Followed his career and admired his acting roles. Love Julie also, she's such a talented lady. This movie was made for T.V.. Should have been released on the big screen.

If you've never seen the Americanization of Emily or Victor/Victoria, try not to miss this former Hallmark Hall of Fame TV special with 2 all-time fantastic actors.

With out a heartbeats moment, she said, ""James Garner!""

I was ecstatic.  James Garner and Ms. Andrews are perfect in the movie.  It is not a mushy, lovey dovey type movie, it is quite realistic and special.  Whats more, I  can watch it over and over and not get sick of it.  I love the log cabin in the movie too.

1786960,5,B00006LPJ0,"Julie Andrews and James Garner kept up their winning record as a team with this third pairing that premiered on network television Sunday November 28, 1999.  Both my wife and I had watched the original telecast and subsequent replays, and snapped it up when it came out on DVD.  This was one of the most highly rated movies for television for that year, and the star wattage and onscreen chemistry of Andrews and Garner are directly responsible.

The story in some ways is improbable, but the viewer needs to accept it as such and appreciate the caliber of the Andrews/Garner partnership, they firmly and successfully carry the film on their shoulders.  It's Thanksgiving Day, and Doctor Catherine Howard (Julie Andrews) a lonely, widowed pediatric cardiologist visits the hospice where her late husband had spent his last days before dying of prostate cancer the prior year.  At the same time building contractor Robert Woodward (James Garner) is there with his grown daughters and grandson to bring his wife Mary Beth who is in the final stages of Alzheimer's disease home for Thanksgiving. However, Mary Beth doesn't recognize any of them and becomes hysterical when Robert tries to help her dress.  As the aide sooths Mary Beth and gets her back to bed, her daughters and grandson leave with the car on Robert's directive he wants to spend more time with his wife and will take a cab back.  However, the snowstorm that is occurring outside is rapidly becoming a blizzard, and Robert has difficulty getting a cab.  Catherine takes pity on him and asks him if he would like a lift, which he gratefully accepts.  However as they ride through almost whiteout conditions in her little sports car they both seem to irritate each other.  Suddenly, the car skids on the deserted road, Robert grabs the wheel and they wind up stuck in a snow bank but luckily unhurt.  However, they are lost in the middle of nowhere, in a raging blizzard, both cell phones are dead.  Thankfully they come upon shelter in an unoccupied farmhouse, and spend the night together waiting for day to break and the storm to subside.  Thrown together unwillingly by circumstance their initial antipathy warms into a nascent affection as both unbend and reveal more of their true selves.

That's enough of the plot I hope to spark your interest in viewing the film, I don't want to give any more away. Sufficent to say it was quite refreshing when I first saw it in 1999 to see a tender, romantic love story between two mature individuals. Both characters are well written in presenting a positive portrayal of an older couple.  Ms. Andrews and Mr. Garner bring them to life with dignity, vulnerability, vitality and a sense of humor.  As all memorable screen couples do, they play off each other's strengths and weaknesses wonderfully and have powerful charisma.  They present a positive healthy image of two people from the AARP generation, and both look wonderful, particularly Ms. Andrews.

Although the teleplay revolves around the Catherine and Robert relationship, there are a couple of subplots involving Robert's daughters, primarily the older, pregnant Lori (Patricia Charbonneau) who has a lot of not so repressed anger against her extranged husband Jeff (Stewart Bick), and her younger sister Jaclyn (Stacy Grant).  Both women have unresolved issues dealing with the stranger their mother has become due to the Alzheimer's.  Lori tends at first to be a rather abrasive martyr, and my sympathies went more to Jaclyn and Jeff.  However, she does undergo a change for the better before the film's conclusion.

The filming of this was done I believe in the area of Montreal, Canada, and the snow scenes with the Christmas decorations are very picturesque.  The rustic farmhouse has a cosy, intimate quality, and Catherine's home is beautiful, set on a lake, rambling, decorated in elegant comfort, my wife and I wanted to move right in!

Although this is a definitely a romantic drama, it does have some moments of humor that will bring a smile to your face and hopefully emit a chuckle or two, as in the title line of this review uttered by an exasperated Robert.  It also does deal with some serious issues such as Alzheimer's, lonliness, infidelity and sibling rivalry, granted in a limited way.  However, don't let those frighten you, watch for yourself, you will see the magic of Ms. Andrews and Mr. Garner make it indeed ""One Special Night"".",1322438400,,4424,4.896782841823057

1786962,5,B00006LPJ0,"This is a very touching film about dealing with loss and loneliness.  James Garner is visiting the rest home where his wife is being cared for because she is in the process of dying from Alzheimer's Disease. He is a bitter and lonely man.  He misses who his wife used to be and what they shared.  His children are grown and he is, for all intents and purposes, alone.  He meets Julie Andrews, who plays a widowed pediatrician, at the rest home.  As the two are leaving the home, the weather turns sour and Andrews' character offers Garner a ride.  Needless to say she finds him utterly detestable because he is a very grumpy old man.  They get into an accident and wind up spending Thanksgiving together in a cabin they've broken into for shelter.  Over the course of their stay in the cabin, the two become fast friends.  No cheating or anything of that sort, rather the two discover just how much they have in common and how much they like one another.  The romance begins after Garner's character's wife dies.  There is nothing untoward in the characters' relationship.  It is about two lonely people finding each other and becoming friends and eventually lovers.  Garner's character does not cheat on his wife.  I love the chemistry between Garner and Andrews in each of three of the films that I've seen them in.  This is a very good movie and an excellent addition to anyone's movie collection.",1320278400,6,1400,4.611336032388664

Starts at Thanksgiving, in a very cold, snowy northern state, where two gorgeous, mature, really, really admirable people are blown on to the same path thanks to Fate and their shared experiences of heart-ache.

""One Special Night"") and Christmas Day kept my sleep-over Thanksgiving guests and me on the ends of our seats, including the teenage niece who ran to  another room for a box of tissues.

A very moving movie with James Garner and Julie Andrews. They make a great pair. James Garner found his serious side in this movie, I am used to him cracking jokes. If I thought he was a great actor before, after seeing this movie, he is great in all aspects of acting. I really believe he can do any kind of show he wants and come out on top. One of the top performers in my opinion. Julie Andrews was at her best in this one,she is a great actress but she really outdid herself in this one. This is a very heartwarming show, witch can make you cry, laugh and just plain feel good inside. I can understand how he felt with his kids being so concerned about him, with his wife in rest home suffering from Alzheimer's and the terrible sadness that goes along with seeing a loved one suffer so long. Julie Andrew as a pediatric cardiologists. A very touching movie. It has it all, sadness, a life that is full of health issues, laughs, and love. What more could a person want in a movie.
This is tops on my list of movies to own. We watch it over and over.
A classic.

1786998,2,B00006LPJ0,"There were so many positive ratings for this movie and we don't understand how that could be the case????

PLOT OF MOVIE - This movie is about a man named Robert (James Garner) who is married to a woman with Alzheimer's.  He is visiting her in a rest home when he is snowed in and a woman Katherine (Julie Andrews) a widower offers him a ride home in her vehicle.  Robert is very disagreeable and rude.

Robert was an arrogant, grumpy man, a chauvinist who complains incessantly.  Katherine is an independent, intelligent, and successful woman doctor.  Where is the common ground?  Why do they go from hating each other to love?  The script did not address this.

PLUSES - Both leading actors are believable in the roles they act.  We have enjoyed James Garner and Julie Andrews in many acting roles; unfortunately, this is not the case here.  Despite their excellent acting it was not enough to save this movie.

MINUSES - Script, plot and character development.  They could have had something special here, but, they missed the mark completely.  They could have explored the difficulties of loosing a spouse to Alzheimer's or the difficulties of life as a widower.  There are a lot of emotions that could have been explored to give this movie purpose and depth, but, were not utilized.  James Garner's character in the movie NOTEBOOK is much better.
The character of Robert was so rude and disagreeable and then him falling in love with Katherine with his wife suffering from Alzheimer's and in the rest home for only a short time (his daughters discuss that their mom has gotten ""bad"" for the past FOUR months) makes his character non endearing.

CONCLUSION - We would pass on this movie.  If you are looking for a good HOLIDAY ROMANCE MOVIE than I would recommend looking at:
A HOLIDAY FOR LOVE with Melissa Gilbert and Tim Matheson or
THE CHRISTMAS CARD with John Newton, Alice Evans and Edward Asner or
A SEASON FOR MIRACLES(Hallmark) with Carla Gugino, David Conrad, Patty Duke, Lynn Redgrave, Laura Dern and Kathy Baker or
CHRISTMAS IN CONNECTICUT with Barbara Stanwyck and Dennis Morgan.

If you are looking for a good movie about RELATIONSHIPS set at the HOLIDAY TIME than consider:
ONE TRUE THING(get the Kleenex) with Meryl Streep, Renee Zellweger, William Hurt or
ABOUT A BOY with Hugh Grant, Rachel Weisz or
THE ULTIMATE GIFT with JAMES GARNER, Brian Dennehy, Abigail Breslin, Drew Fuller, & Bill Cobbs.",1230249600,5,2417,4.808716707021792
1786999,5,B00006LPJ0,"This is a terrific movie to watch over the holidays, or just on a cold snowy night. Boy, those snowstorm scenes are so lifelike I kept looking out the window to see if the snow was headed my way!  Julie Andrews and James Garner are great as two opposites in the twilight of life. Garner's wife is afllicted with Altzheimer's and it is touching to see the impact this terrible disease has, not only on the afflicted, but the families that are faced with torment as well. It is not probed in depth, which is good for the tone of the movie. The other topics, Julie Andrews' career as a pediatric cardiologist (Julie as a Doctor?) gives a bit of a women's lib touch to Garner's old fashioned male chauvinism (Garner: ""I noticed the MD license plates - is your husband a doctor?"" Andrews: ""Noooo"" (rolling her eyes - is he dense or what?)  --also the subplot of Andrews' husband's recent death, her devotion to him, and fear of jumping back on the romance bandwagon-- (even with someone as gorgeous as Garner - 300 years old but still a stud)-- as well as the two daughters of James Garner, who seem at odds,with their own problematic lives, give additional interest-- but primarily, it is a cozy romantic movie. It's amusing that there are many ""reviewers"" picking it apart, analyzing ad nauseum. Listen kids, it's not rocket science, just a movie!  And an extremely cozy and lovely movie.

I am frankly startled to note I am the first person to write a bad review for this movie.  I like James Garner and Julie Andrews, so I thought how bad could it be?  Well, I think they did their parts, but the plot and the script writing were so incredibly bad, I guess they did the best they could do with what they had.  I didn't feel the movie explored in depth any of the following topics: Alzheimers, being the spouse or family member of someone with Alzheimers, widowhood, winter romance (ha ha), or even romance.  The topic material had a lot of potential, but they just didn't go anywhere with it.  To sum it up, that's two hours of my life I'll never get back.",1229040000,4,873,4.254545454545455

She is headstrong and wants to do everything herself.  Robert Woodward is a father and grandfather who's wife has altzhiemers. He is stubborn and believes women need to be taken care of because they can't do things themselves. The two meet Thanksgiving night at the hospice facility where his wife now lives and where her husband used to.  Because of a big storm Robert is unable to get a cab so Katherine offers him a ride home. On the way her car hits a patch of ice and goes off the road.  Stranded they manage to find an empty cabin where they find shelter for the night. Throughout the long snowy night the two get to know each other and find that they have more in common than they thought.

The storyline, not unique, but different because of their situations, was really cute & fun with a few unexpected delights.

James Garner, whom I LOVED, in THE NOTEBOOK, was fabulous as the husband of an alzheimers patient in hospice & then a widower. Their chemistry is undeniable.

Then I stumbled onto it here at Amazon when they suggested other Christmas related movies so I thank them for that help!  I loved this movie, its a Christmas Romance and if those two words don't go together I don't know which two would go any better.  The acting and timing are perfect, believable, and the movie leaves you feeling pleased.  Definitely buy it on DVD and be amazed at how low priced it is, I sure was!  My opinion is;  If you can make a fantasy believable, you have a winner.  So this movie gets my 5 star vote, though its worth 6.  Enjoy!!",1157155200,3,662,4.198412698412699
