7872195,5,6304475993,"This is the original VHS record of the classic research study by Mech and Brandenburg of a pack of arctic wolves who had had no previous contact with man.  Beautiful and inspiring.
Purchasers should note that this is a US VHS tape and will not play on normal UK VHS players.",1290988800,,274,4.372549019607843
7872196,3,6304475993,"I love NG nature documentaries, but not this one. The subject matter was fascinating, and I like to learn a lot about the subject.

However, I felt this one included too much long-distance photography, when they could have gotten more closeup footage, given that they were able to get so close. I think they spent more time sitting on a hill comparing notes with each other than exploring better camera angles.

I would have preferred less focus on the people, and more on the wolves. The photography wasn't up to NG standards.",1191628800,,527,4.717391304347826
7872197,4,6304475993,"Reknowned wildlife photographer Jim Brandenburg and wolf biologist David Mech travel to one of the remotest locations, Canada's Ellesmere Island, to observe a wolf pack living there. These wolves have not been persecuted by humans, as their more Southerly brothers and sisters have, so they do not fear people. This allows Brandenburg and Mech to gain their trust quickly, and to have incredibly intimate encounters with the pack's members.
This film was made before we knew very much about wolf social behavior, and it's fascinating to watch and the two men try to understand what unfolds before them. They spend the entire summer with the pack, and then return the following year to see what has happened to them over the long, dark, Arctic winter. As we watch them watching the wolves, and the wolves watching them, we come to see that the wolf is not a vicious, heartless, cold-blooded, unfeeling killer - it is a highly social, affectionate, intelligent and caring creature. Neither of the two men were ever threatened or menaced by any of the pack; rather, the two species gradually formed a trust and tolerance of each other, and the wolves come to accept the humans' presence without being afraid.
I do weekly volunteer work with wolves at Wolf Haven International, located in Tenino, Washington, and thus have a huge interest in this so often misunderstood species. I've read many books and have watched many films, and this one is pretty good. In my opinion, National Geographic's ""Legend: The Return of the Wolf to Yellowstone"" is a better overall piece, offering more education, information, and exceptional footage of the reintroduced packs in the park; however, it does not show close human/wolf interactions as this film does. There is also a piece by the Dutchers, called ""Wolves at Our Door"" that is, despite the methods the Dutchers used, an outstanding movie in terms of showing the public how remarkable the wolf truly is.
I cannot encourage people to see these films enough - we need to spread the word that wolves are not the Grimm's Fairy Tale's version of the Big Bad Wolf, not the evil, satanic killer that has been storied for hundreds of years. The wolf plays a vital role in our ecology, and we need to allow it to return to its historic habitats to help balance out the damage we have done by erradicating it.",1040342400,8,2338,4.832917705735661
7872198,5,6304475993,"I own this film and I never tire of watching it.  As a passionate wolf advocate, I am always grateful to see films which show the true nature of wolves made available to the general populace - not just scientists and environmentalists. Another terrific wolf film, ""Wolves at Our Door"", made by wildlife film maker Jim Dutcher, has done wonderful things for the public's awareness of the intelligence, complexity, and devotion to family that are the keystones of the nature of the wolf.  The film is carefully pieced together, however, with gorgeous backround music, etc.  It's a beautiful film about beautiful animals - but it lacks the raw realism that this film shows: this is about two men, Dave Mech (famed wolf biologist) and Jim Brandenburg (famed wildlife photographer and wolf lover), freezing their charms off on Ellesmere Island to observe a pack of wolves who have never before known human contact.  Apart from great footage, the beauty of this particular film is in the unstaged way in which it shows the life of this wolf pack - and the remarkable tolerance - and trust - that the wolves come to show to both these extraordinary men.  I recommend this film to everyone, not merely to wolf lovers.  I particularly hope that those who do NOT love the wolf will see it.  Perhaps they will learn something, besides the error of their ignorance.",976665600,8,1353,4.781115879828326
