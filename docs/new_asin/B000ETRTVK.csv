2534157,5,B000ETRTVK,"Several work outs  all really well described the presenter/person
She isn't super chipper nor was she militant she does good job with motivation super easy to follow",1362960000,4,165,5.111111111111111
2534158,4,B000ETRTVK,"I did the dumbbell and ankle/wrist weight workouts back to back. When I first started I was afraid I was wasting my time and thought maybe I should have put in a Cathe video instead, but the time flew by and it was fun and different. I maxed out on weights as much as possible and boy, did I feel it the next day. In fact, I was already sore that same evening (and I don't get sore very often anymore). The workouts are a bit slow-paced going from one to the next, but I used the breaks to get extra reps in, or a drink of water. Overall, it ended up being very effective.",1224460800,12,572,3.982608695652174
2534159,4,B000ETRTVK,"Being able to purchase 4 complete workouts on one dvd is wonderful. The workouts themselves are moderate in my opinion. Gin does take time to set up for exercises and explains sometimes too much, and I can see where this could be a bit annoying using it over and over.  Yet, the workouts are solid and Gin's queing and form are definitely some of the best out there. I would recommend this for anyone who is looking for a variety of weight baring routines.",1171670400,10,456,4.428571428571429
2534160,5,B000ETRTVK,Gin Miller is one of the best home workout instructors in the business.  Her instructions are clear and effective.  She also has a sense of humor in her presentation of the exercises.  I love the workouts because the exercises that comprise the workout are thorough.,1146787200,12,266,4.866666666666666
2534161,5,B000ETRTVK,"Gin Miller is the inventor of step aerobics.  She's got all the moves and she is a great instructor.  She's tough and motivating and she's not over the top like some fake instructors.  She's pleasant to watch and makes you want to get up off your [...].  She also lets her sense of humour come through which is nice and refreshing.
There are four workouts here and she is one of the best cuers around.  This is no exception.  Each workout targets a different section of your body.  You use weights (wrist or ankle), dumbells and weighted balls.  You don't do floorwork, but you either sit or stand so you can get your best form.  It's a long workout if you do it altogether, so I prefer to do it in parts.  You are going to feel the burn let me tell you, but you know what?  It's an excellent workout and because it's motivating, I'm doing it and seeing results.",1143849600,31,862,4.291925465838509

8114215,5,B000ETRTVK,"This tape is great for beginners and others. Every move is explained in depth, so that it can be followed without injury - Great!  since I have very little experience in this area. There are four different routines to follow which target different areas of the body and this makes it interesting to follow the DVD. I am looking forward to being a healthier person because of this video!",1388620800,3,386,4.594202898550725
8114216,5,B000ETRTVK,"Absolutely fantastic, I sent this one for a friend, already sent for mine sometime ago.  Fabulous workouts and very entertaining,not boring at all.  I do this workout two or three times a week.  Keeps my weight stable and I keep burning calories even at rest. Gin Miller explains workouts brilliantly, one of the best dvds i have bought, believe me I have bought many! zumba, batuka, latin dancing, flat abs, toning etc.!!",1363478400,5,422,4.833333333333333
