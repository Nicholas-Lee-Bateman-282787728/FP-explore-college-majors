2238160,5,B0007RO8MW,"For fans and people who are new to the Boys, this is a great buy!
Season 4 is great and just like the last three seaons it's very funny!
The movie ads at the start of the DVD are annoying, but you can press menu to skip them.  I guess thats a side effect of getting the DVD out to wider markets.
My suggestion is to get it!!",1113609600,,324,3.764705882352941

2238177,5,B0007RO8MW,"It doesn't get any better than trailer park boys. I can't wait for season 8 to get released. I bought these cause NETFLIX took it off its list, but has since been brought back. At lease now I don't have to worry about that anymore.",1384732800,,231,4.155555555555556
2238178,5,B0007RO8MW,Love them all! All the trailer park boys are a show I would recommend to someone who likes dry humor!,1378166400,,101,4.1
2238179,5,B0007RO8MW,My order arrived on time and in perfect condition. The show itself is awesome. Buy many seasons at once though. due to short episodes you chew through them quick.,1377129600,,162,4.620689655172414
2238180,5,B0007RO8MW,I think they really took off in this season. They seemed to home in on the hijinks that set up the following 3 seasons. The cast is very articulate in their ability to play off each other  as if they actually do live in the park. Very well done. I do enjoy this show. I hope they continue to work together and perhaps spin off another show with an equal amount of reality and comedy.,1374451200,,383,4.1066666666666665
2238191,5,B0007RO8MW,"They make real life seem so hilarious; if I am in a bad mood, watching ""Trailer Park Boys"" will make me smile and laugh, and feel good about life.",1372291200,,146,4.068965517241379
2238192,4,B0007RO8MW,The Boys don't disappoint in season 4.  It is a white trash version of curb your Enthusiasm.  Shot and scripted the same...,1363219200,,123,4.545454545454546
2238193,5,B0007RO8MW,I purcased this item as a gift for someone. It arrived on time. It is a hillarious show. Check out the whole series!,1358294400,,116,4.086956521739131
2238194,5,B0007RO8MW,"seen these guys in a live performance and they are VERY funny , if you want to laugh till you cry order this!",1356825600,,109,3.782608695652174
2238195,5,B0007RO8MW,This show is hilarious! They really did a good job with a low starting budget. The actors are all great and very unbelievable trailer trashy!,1354579200,,141,4.68
2238196,5,B0007RO8MW,"I ever saw a clip of Trailer Park Boys, I honestly thought it was a legitmate documentary.  I've been hooked ever since.  Many a truth were said in jest and that is definitely true for TPB.",1348012800,,189,4.222222222222222
2238197,5,B0007RO8MW,"It's Trailer Park Boys! If you don't know who these guys are then you should because they're flipping hilarious! It does take a particular type of sense of humor to appreciate them, but if you have that type of funny bone these guys will have you laughing for hours and you'll find yourself watching them repeatedly. I own every episode and every movie they've done for exactly that reason, they're awesome dumb humor for those times you just want a dumb laugh with characters you'll get attached too. 5 Stars, two thumbs up!",1342915200,,525,4.655913978494624
2238198,5,B0007RO8MW,"Nothing more needed to say, its the Trailer Park Boys!
If you like silly humor, and you don't mind a lot of fowl language, then this is your thing.
I love the Trailer Park Boys! Go Bubbles!",1277424000,,189,4.135135135135135
2238199,5,B0007RO8MW,"when i was a kid i smoked a LOT of weed. one day, i just stopped. after about twenty years, i am thinking straight again, and mostly, drug culture just annoys me.
a few years ago, a friend brought me back this, the fourth season, from her trip to novascotia, and i was hooked. these guys are hilarious, greasy, and real, and kinda make me wanna smoke some weed. of course, i'm an adult now with adult responsibilities, so i get what i need from the scent wafting over from the neighbor's house.
since receiving that gift, i have ordered and own all the seasons, plus the two films and the xmas special.
i highly recommend all things trailer park boys, especially if you just wanna live vicariously, and skankily, through the boys for a while.
it does suck, though, living in los angeles, being the only person anywhere around me who knows about this.",1268179200,,850,4.490322580645161
2238200,5,B0007RO8MW,"If an already brillantly satrical look at life couldn't get any better, we meet CONKY in episode 5. Conky, a manequin puppet Bubbles made in 6th Grade, is bought back from his watery tomb, to assist Bubbles go to the Hospital.

Needless to say, I cannot rave enough about the series, yet, series 4 really is genuine heady, comedic, genius.",1265328000,,339,4.65
2238211,5,B0007RO8MW,"While I have great nostalgia and respect for the comics of yesteryear who got laughs without expletives (I'm 61!), I find Trailer Park Boys too, too hilarious.  I ordered this set for the Conky and Green Bastard episodes which I'd seen on Direct TV's channel 101.  There's nothing funnier than Ricky, with a stained rag glued to his nose, being insulted by the Conky puppet, which has a strange power over Bubbles.  I've found some of the episodes to be downright depressing because of the characters' alcoholism and other problems, but this season contains some of my favorites.",1246752000,,579,4.887755102040816
2238212,5,B0007RO8MW,"Season 4 is a very interesting season ot Trailer park Boys. The shows moves back to center on the boys a little more than a few previous seasons. The side charecters (except Laheay) seem to fade back a little.
This season also has a few of the best episodes in the series.
The episode Conky is by far the most bizzar if not funniest episode in the shows run. If you are a fan of the show and have not seen this episode you owe it to your self to buy this set.
I also like that every episode in this season has commentary. It is also that the commentart is with the actors and not just the director. Listening to the commentary really doubles the ammount of episodes you get.

For all TPB fans this is a must have season. For new fans go back and pick up the season one and two set then grab season 4.",1223942400,3,800,4.031446540880503
2238213,5,B0007RO8MW,"Bubbles rules Season #4 of the Trailer Park Boys.

In three consecutive episodes, ""The Green Bastard,"" ""Conky"" and ""If You Love Something, Set It Free"", Bubbles steals the season.

You will never look at ventriloquist dolls the same way again!

2238214,5,B0007RO8MW,I was finally able to get the Trailer Park boys in America. I'm hooked. The characters and plots stay true to form. And they have the same cast for the whole series. You get use to the language. THIS IS MY FAVORITE SEASON. I gobbled up all of the series they had. I can't wait to see the TPB's Movie in America on the big screen. About time!!!,1198886400,,343,4.0588235294117645
2238215,5,B0007RO8MW,Be very careful if you decide to watch this.  You can easily get hooked on this show.  Every minute is hysterical.,1197158400,,114,4.380952380952381
2238216,5,B0007RO8MW,"I had heard a lot about this series from my sister. Skeptical, I gave season 1 a shot and found it funny enough to keep going. I'm glad I did. Once I had grown to understand the characters better (about mid-way through season 2), I was hooked. Each season has its best moments, but all of them are based in character and situation -- the perfect blend of comedy. This is not a show for everyone, but if you laugh at shows like The Office or Curb Your Enthusiasm, then you will not be sorry for devoting yourself to the adventures of Julian, Ricky, and one of the best characters ever created: Bubbles.

Season 4 has Ricky acting as the trailer park supervisor for a time. Of course, things fall apart. But it's always fun to see how! Bubbles as The Green Bastard, drunk Bubbles singing about kitties, Ricky electrocuting himself, and Randy's gut -- there are so many moments it's unbelievable.",1195776000,,893,4.512345679012346
2238217,4,B0007RO8MW,Does anyone else have to slog through movie previews when inserting the dvds? It seems I have to sit through four minutes of previews before the title menu.,1155686400,,156,4.607142857142857
2238218,5,B0007RO8MW,"From what I've seen of the fifth season I think this one may be the fully-realized peak of the series, although when the new stuff makes it to DVD it won't be any less essential. Simply the best thing on TV today and one of the best shows ever, period. There's nothing else to say. You see anybody writing an even remotely lukewarm review of them here? Didn't think so.",1120176000,8,369,4.285714285714286
2238219,5,B0007RO8MW,"Trailer Park Boys has to be the funniest thing on TV; although its cheesiness might shy away viewers, not to mention the language, you soon feel yourself getting to know the boys ... and then your hooked. Although it is best to tune in every Sunday at 9 to showcase for the weekly episode I find it funnier to watch them commercial free and back to back on the dvds. If you like the show or have just started watching it, go buy the dvds right away. Great shows put into a  Great dvd maximizing  viewing pleasure for all T.P.B fans  If you don't believe  me look at the sales.... Trailer park boys season 4 dvd is the number one seller in Canada",1115424000,3,645,4.219512195121951
2238220,5,B0007RO8MW,"Excellent DVD set and very, very funny.
Unfortunately, what makes this set very upsetting is that it forces you to watch two very long unrelated movie previews/ads, prior to getting to the Trailer Park Boys Menu. You CAN NOT skip past them and must watch them every time you put this DVD in your player. Advice: watch it on your personal computer where you can skip the previews. Still worth buying.",1113696000,3,399,4.633802816901408
