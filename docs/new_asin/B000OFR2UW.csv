It was defenetly worth it because I had gained about 40 pounds of muscle just in 2 month with no fat. I was working out everyday using noxadrene. I also ate a lot of fruits and vegetables everyday. I am happy with results it didn't just make
me huge but also powerfull. I felt like i was boxing for 10 years. - The Husband",1213920000,2,411,4.08641975308642
