8482477,5,B005PF9KHE,"I bought this film on spec because the storyline suggested that this
film could turn out to be an interesting treatise on familial bonds,
and because I like watching to see how genuine off-screen familial
bonds between actors might affect their on-screen performances. This
storyline was particularly difficult subject matter, and could so
easily have descended into breast-beating, lazily scripted melodrama,
a' la Hollywood. Fortunately, the quality of the writing, direction,
cinematography, and acting is all so high that at no point in the film
was that in danger of happening. The talented cast lent such warmth and
humanity to their characters that I ended up liking them all, and
feeling that I understood them and could not blame them for anything. I
feel nothing but love and admiration for this film, and Emma
Schweiger's character, Magdalena, who is at once captivating and
enchanting, and entirely believable, had a lot to do with that. She's a
heart thief!",1427500800,,970,5.1455696202531644

8482482,5,B005PF9KHE,I love the heartstrings that this movie pulls on. The acting is brilliant and the story is cute. I wish it was US region specific.,1363824000,,130,4.24
8482483,4,B005PF9KHE,"Kokowh is a very heart-warming story about a man named Henry who learns that he has a daughter, Magdalena, from a one-night stand in Stockholm with his previously-platonic previously-best friend, Charlotte, whom he hasn't seen since because they both felt so guilty for cheating on their partners. And now Charlotte's husband, Tristan, has discovered that Magdalena is not his birth daughter. Distraught, he is unsure if he still wants Magdalena in his life, so Charlotte gets a friend of hers to drop Magdalena off at Henry's front door so she can live with Henry until her mother returns from her New York business trip.

Magdalena is absolutely adorable. Such a sweet kid. She's smart, but still a very innocent 8-year-old girl who notices that something wrong is happening...but she doesn't know what. The scenes between her and Henry were definitely the best. She doesn't know yet that he's her biological dad, but they form a close bond and slowly Henry becomes a (mostly) responsible guardian.

I really liked Magdalena's non-biological father, Tristan. You can see how much pain he is in and he is tormented about the situation - he loves Magdalena very much, but isn't sure if he can accept her as his own daughter now. He and Henry form a funny, awkward, but endearing friendship and Tristan makes the right decision in the end: Magdalena IS his real daughter, blood or not. This causes humorous tension between the two dads, who vie to be the ""most loved"" dad.

Henry's on-and-off girlfriend, Katharina, was a good character. I'm not so sure if Henry deserves her, but it's obvious that no matter what has happened, they can't get over each other. Their scenes together are both sweet and angst-ridden.

Overall, I really enjoyed Kokowh. The characters, the story...all very sweet and touching and funny.",1362787200,2,1815,4.9605263157894735
8482484,3,B005PF9KHE,"I had seen trailers for this film and thought that the plot sounded entertaining and that Til Schweiger was certainly easy on the eyes. I eventually did see this movie in the theater and really enjoyed it. What I found most enjoyable about it was the adorable and touching interactions between father and daughter Til and Emma Schweiger, who also play father and daughter in the film. I can't give it four stars because there are a few scenes of (what I found to be) stale slapstick humor, although there I am definitely bringing my American tastes into play. German audiences tend to have a higher tolerance for slapstick comedy than do contemporary American audiences.

Til is certainly handsome and he is also a very talented actor and director. If you are interested in contemporary German cinema, I would say this is one to check out. Although it is hardly what I would call a challenging film, it is intriguing and entertaining, certainly two hours well spent.",1333756800,,966,4.7844311377245505
8482485,1,B005PF9KHE,"It's a german movie in german language, so this review ist in german language too:

Zunchst einmal: Til Schweiger hat auch schon mal gute Filme gemacht, damals z. B. ""Der bewegte Mann"". Was habe ich da im Kino gelacht, auch wenn der Film nach dem zweiten und dritten Mal anschauen immer mehr an Wirkung verlor.

Kokowh ist dagegen einfach nur dumm. ber die Handlung schweige ich einfach mal, denn da gibt es nicht viel mehr zu sagen, als in der Amazon-Produktbeschreibung steht.

Es war Anfang 2011, als ich beschloss, Kokowh mit meiner Tochter (im Emma Tiger Schweiger-Alter) den Film zu sehen. Doch dann ergab es sich, dass ich bereits vorher den Film mit Freunden ansah - vorab, sozusagen.

Als wir aus dem Kino kamen, fragte mich eine Bekannte: ""Und da willst Du mit Deiner Tochter 'rein?"" Nein, auf keinen Fall! Was sollte meine damals 8jhrige Tochter aus einem Film lernen, in dem fast durchgngig geraucht, gesoffen, gev... und geflucht wird? Was soll sie fr das Leben lernen? Dass das Leben aus Lgen, Fast-Food und Sigkeiten besteht? Oder wie man eine Wohnung in Brand setzt?

Der Streifen erreicht noch nicht einmal das geistige Niveau von Klopapier. Die Tochter von Til Schweiger tat mir die ganze Zeit ber unheimlich leid, weil sie in so einem Film mitspielen musste.

Til Schweiger selbst spielt das, was er am besten kann: Einen Vollpfosten. Aber damit hat er sich schon lngst verbraucht, wer will das noch sehen?

Mag sein, dass Schweiger aufgrund seines Geldes von Frauen begehrt wird. Ohne seinen finanziellen Hintergrund wre fr viele Frauen sicherlich kaum interessant. Damit wird seine Filmrolle auch unglaubwrdig. Fr einen mittellosen Frauenheld fehlen ihm Benehmen, Aussehen, Charakter und auch alles andere.

Fazit

Witz = Null
Niveau = Null
Botschaft = Asozial

Dafr noch einen Stern zu geben kommt einer berbewertung gleich.

Eine letzte Frage:

Wie viel Bestechungsgelder musste Schweiger eigentlich dafr zahlen, dass der Film schon ab 6 Jahren freigegeben wurde?",1331251200,2,1986,5.133540372670807
