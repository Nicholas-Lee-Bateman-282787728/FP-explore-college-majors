8620537,5,B002M3ZM1U,"The Battle of Britain is the fourth of seven documentaries from the Why We Fight series directed by Frank Capra.  Released between 1942 and 1945, these films were shown to American military personnel for instructional purposes; they also served as American propaganda during World War II.  This film portrays German air operations against the people of Britain as well as the Royal Air Force's fight against one of the most powerful air forces in world history.  With the use of animated maps and combat footage, we get a good perspective of what it was like for the British people as they survived the German aerial onslaught during the summer and fall of 1940.  The film points out that Britain was able to recover downed pilots that were able to fight another day; the Germans, on the other hand, lost numerous experienced pilots over the skies of Britain.  In sum, this is a succinct overview of British guts versus German bombs in World War II.",1522713600,,949,4.762195121951219

I thought it would be best to see the motivational propaganda that kept soldiers fighting, Kept citizens rashoning, and kept the Nazi's out of Britain in an age of colapse and world turmoil

We concluded that the film shows subtle and obtuse methods of shifting in even the most determined diplomacist. The will to fight, the reason why we fight, comes down to nature human nature to survive. In this method, you must use all forms of media (especially the most relevant [WWII had the radio and television, now we have the internet] ) to your immediate use.

Such zeal that generation had.

Great Film, good quality",1273017600,,703,4.699186991869919
