6965200,5,B00S9S12R0,"My husband LOVES this show! He discovered it a few months ago on cable. He was unable to watch it when he was working long hours; we are retired now.

Our son-in-law got him an Amazon stick so he could watch all 7 episodes. My husband's birthday is soon so he said he wanted the series on blue ray in case Amazon discontinued the series. LOL

Well, the doorbell just rang and the mail lady left the Amazon box at the door. I said you can't open it -- it's for your birthday! Of course he opened it anyway.

Wish I had gotten a picture of his face when he saw the set. It was worth spending the extra money for his reaction. The box is super nice. I only pray all the DVD's work OK.

I haven't gotten into the series myself but maybe one weekend we will have a Sons Of Anarchy marathon!",1503360000,,785,4.04516129032258

The only bad thing was that the final DVD had a deep scratch in it and cut off the last 5 minutes of the final episode. I've never seen it before so we had to look it up on YouTube. We didn't put the disk back in but I'm sure the extras would've had trouble too. We don't know if the scratch was already on the disk when we got it or if it was caused by the packaging. The disks had to be slid out of a cardboard 'book'. However it was the only one that caused us trouble.",1483401600,,607,3.75

But AMAZON offered it at a great price and so - what the heck - I bought it.  And Holy Toledo - perhaps my favorite show of all time.

As if the outer cardboard box wasn't enough, the inner case is a replica of the SOA clubhouse church table, with an amazing looking reaper. Then the actual discs are housed in a book. The book can be displayed as a coffee table book and the reaper case can be displayed separately.
FX and. Kurt Sutter did a great job delivering a knock out box set. The only issue is it's so gorgeous you hate to open it.
The DVD transfer is great and there are loads of extras.",1462060800,,523,4.137254901960785

The quality of the DVD is surprisingly good, which made me not regret not getting the BluRay. The packaging is awesome. The reaper wood box is nicely made and makes a great case for all the DVD's and the sleeves that the DVD's come in is great.

6965353,2,B00S9S12R0,"Greetings fellow amazonians, I have never had much time to watch SOA while it was on because my work hours conflicted with the time the show was broadcast. So when I saw this box set figured it was time to catch up! Man too bad the title didn't really represent what the show was about. First of all anarchy is chaos, life without law, so why were they listening to the president of the club or any other ranking member of the group. There is no way this shows what an anarchical society would look like. Second sons? Really?!?  I think these guys need to go back to well and come up with a more creative title which states what actually happens on the show ""Angry biker men"" might work or ""ex-pig iron men who sell drugs"" could also fly, but I think that may be lost on some of the rubes out there. So really not too impressed, but I will watch the second disk and see if it gets any better.",1461024000,,892,4.15606936416185

6965573,4,B00S9S12R0,"When it comes to recommending this series, I really have to say it depends on the person I'm speaking to. ""Sons of Anarchy"" is a gritty and brutal TV show, with shocking scenes of violence and for a television show, quite a bit of sex. With that said, it also features some of the best characters I've seen on TV this side of 'Breaking Bad"", and several episodes that are edge-of-your-seat nailbiters.

The Sons of Anarchy are a motorcycle gang that operates out of the small California town of Charming. Through the series we follow Jax Teller, the son of one of the club's founders as he's making his way through the ranks of the club. His step-father is the current president as the show opens, and his mother, Gemma, is the de-facto den mother to the whole club. As the series progresses we see that Jax is determined, like his father, to get the Sons away from the outlaw activity they've gotten pulled into over the years. Jax wants a better life for his family, but extracting the club from the criminal activity is much trickier than he knows. Power struggles from within and from without the club, rival gangs, the local cops, the federal government, and even the IRA all have some sort of claim on the Sons. Watching Jax try to maneuver through this minefield, all while dealing with the various personalities in his club makes for fascinating viewing.

I know that the show's star is supposed to be Charlie Hunnam's character Jax, but I have to say that the reason I kept turning back in was to see what Gemma (Katey Sagal) was going to do in each episode. Gemma is that rare TV character, like ""Walter White"", where despite their despicable actions, you still like them. Ron Perlman as ""Clay Morrow"" is another huge reason I recommend the show. There is just something so charismatic about Perlman and his character, you get pulled in one episode after the next. The acting across the board is first rate, as you get to know the club members, you really begin to like so many characters. And I have to say that ""Sons of Anarchy"" doesn't pull any punches with the fates of it's characters, there are certain episodes where you'll sit with your jaw on the floor, and a tear in your eye when the end credits roll.

The only thing holding me back from a full 5 star rating is there are two seasons which hurt the overall story. During the 3rd season, the club gets stuck over in Ireland for a large chunk of the show. Taking the club out of Charming just didn't feel right, and having them roaming the Irish landscape with the IRA just didn't click for me. And I have to ding the show for the final season. Without providing spoilers, they basically turned the entire core premise of the first six seasons on it's ear, and it dragged on a few episodes too long.

This is a compelling show, full of unforgettable characters, and definitely worth checking out.",1434067200,8,2866,4.527027027027027

6965585,4,B00S9S12R0,"First things first. The Complete Series Giftset comes beautifully packaged in a heavy ""coffin"" intricately carved to resemble the meeting table used by the Sons of Anarchy in the show.  Inside is a sturdy album containing the discs themselves.  Several episodes each season have commentary tracks, and there are a few bonus features that depict some of the actors, writers and producers discussing the show, as well as some deleted and extended scenes and outtakes.  At full retail, the Gifset is a little light on bonus features; wait a few months and you can probably get it at a steep discount (I did not pay full price, but the Giftset would be a great value anywhere around $100, which is less than I paid).  The entire series is available free for Prime members, but I'd heard great things about the show and wanted something permanent.  Also, I have Comcast internet, which is very fast, but VERY spotty and I didn't want to have to constantly reboot each episode with every Comcast outage.  Again, the packaging is gorgeous.  I had some frustrating technical difficulties playing the discs on my Oppo BDP-95, probably indicating that Oppo needs to issue a firmware update.  Many of the discs registered as ""unknown disc"" when I first inserted them in the Oppo.  Happily, I was able to work around this problem by inserting the problem discs into a Playstation 3 first, letting each disc boot up, then removing it and placing back into the Oppo.  This worked EVERY time.

I just finished a marathon binge-watch of the entire series.  I did not watch the show at all while it was being broadcast on FX.  Due to the extreme violence and sexual content (a lot of the plot revolves around pornography production and prostitution), SOA might have been a better fit on HBO, Starz or Showtime -- it's a little strange seeing so much sex and violence, but nobody ever drops an F-bomb, but that's just a nitpick.  I thoroughly enjoyed watching the show from beginning to end.  It depicts a world of frequent, stunning violence, but the show tries to draw a line between ""good"" and ""evil"" bands of outlaw bikers that sometimes is a little hard to swallow.  I know these guys live by a code, but the antiheroes of the Sons go to great lengths to be protect their little town of Charming, CA (near Oakland), while their rivals have no problem with indiscriminate murder, engaging in drive-by shootings at community events and planting explosives in locations where innocent people are present.  By the end of Season 7, the body count is somewhere in the hundreds; if that really happened in a small town in the U.S., the extreme violence in Charming would bring the FBI and ATF to impose a curfew and lock up each and every member of the Sons for life sometime around Season 2.  The alliances and rivalries between the various ""clubs"" is surprisingly fluid; one week, the Sons are closely allied with the Hispanic ""Mayans"" or the African-American ""One-Niners"", and the next week, those groups would be at war with one another.  I have no idea how these relationships work in the real world, but I think the hostility between the ""clubs"" would linger permanently, and they would not be inclined to team up, despite any opportunities presented by the businesses of trafficking guns, flesh and drugs.  But, in the real world, they all seem to get along (mostly) every year at the massive Sturgis Rally, so what do I know?  If you can suspend your disbelief and accept that U.S. federal law enforcement would tolerate hundreds of violent deaths without rounding everyone up and throwing away the key, then SOA is a fascinating ride through some of the most intense situations ever depicted on television.

I also had a slight problem with some inconsistent characterization.  Certain members of the Sons are heroically devoted to the club and its members one season, then they suddenly turn and betray those people and principles in the next.  The show makes a strong effort to depict plausible motivations for this changing behavior, and all the best television shows portray character ""arcs"" that show how an individual can change, grow, mature or, conversely, become bitter and betray their principles due to changing circumstances.  but some of the Sons and their allies/adversaries go from ""good"" to ""bad"" awfully quickly.  Very often, violent tragedies occur because characters make faulty assumptions, shooting first and asking questions later.

This is a GRIM show.  After the first season or so, the Sons NEVER have any fun.  There are no parties, rallies, etc. There is the occasional wedding or childbirths, but it's almost all scheming, plotting and violence.  After the first season, it's hard to imagine why anyone would choose this kind of life.  The vast majority of characters are extremely articulate and intelligent, despite the fact that almost none of them have much formal education.  Many, however are veterans of the armed forces, with a few of the Originals having served in Vietnam.  The performances are uniformly excellent, with top honors going to the ultra-talented Katey Sagal -- that woman has an incredible range!  I first saw her as selfish yenta housewife Peg Bundy in the 80s, then she provided the voice of Leela on Futurama, and in SOA she does her very best work, playing a manipulative, conniving woman who will do ANYTHING to protect herself and her family.  She even sings beautifully, with her voice featured in the background of many episodes.  ""America's Caveman"" Ron Perlman is also excellent, and he dominates every scene with a menacing presence.  The actors who play club members ""Tig"" ""Bobby Elvis"" ""Opie"" and others are so engaging and effective, it's hard to picture them playing any other kind of role.  I've heard SOA described as ""Hamlet with Motorcycles"".  I think the ""Hamlet"" comparison begins and ends with the main character, Jackson Teller, and his parents, as well as the orgy of tragedy into which the show descends as the seasons pass.

I thoroughly enjoyed every season, except perhaps Season 3, which takes place in a different location and feels disconnected from the narrative.  A show like SOA would have been revolutionary a decade ago, before this ""Golden Age of Television"" highlighted by shows like Breaking Bad and Game of Thrones.  It's still pretty groundbreaking, as I've never seen this particular world of ""outlaw biker"" life depicted on television.  It's a riveting and intense viewing experience, especially if you watch it all over the course of a few weeks, as I did.  If you're not bothered by extreme, often senseless, violence, it's a worthy investment of time and money.",1432425600,64,6648,4.9078711985688726

6965607,5,B00S9S12R0,"I heard only a little about Sons of Anarchy before I took a shot in the dark and bought the whole series in this box set. The words I heard were good but I payed no mind until one day I felt very random and bought this. I am a fan of some great T.V. shows such as The Walking Dead, Breaking Bad, and Game of Thrones and I must say, this is right up there with them. I just finished watching the whole series, after never watching an episode of this before, and I was blown away. It took me about a month and a half to watch all 95 episodes and there was never a dull moment. I am very pleased with this product and I have also gotten some people I know into the show as well. They love it just as I do. Well worth the money. If you love long addicting T.V. shows with a lot of great characters, great acting, action, drama, and suspense.

If u like action drama horror exciting this is all that rolled into one. Best damn tv series ever in my opinion. Try it for yourself and find out, u won't be disappointed.

The book folds and rests inside a replica of the table top in the club, where meetings where held. It's lined with velvet and it's HEAVY! In fact, when the shipment arrived I remember thinking is this much too heavy for a set of DVD's - and was pleasantly surprised to find out the reason for the weight! We haven't started watching the series yet (still too soon after the finale of the series.) As others had posted the quality of the regular DVD set was so great, we decided to get instead of the more expensive HD set. If you're a fan of the series, or any of the cast, you'll love this. (BEWARE: Lots of violence from season 1 to the end; so I wouldn't recommend watching it with children in the room; we always closed and locked our bedroom door to watch so the grandchildren didn't come in and see something they shouldn't.) And, I would be remiss without mentioning the name of the brilliant mind behind the camera: Kurt Sutter!",1427587200,,1036,4.429319371727749

I don't think, other that the ROME series, have I ever enjoyed a more interesting series.  Sorry to see it end, but all good things do come to end, eventually.

He has never been into motorcycles, but he insisted a show that has rave reviews after seven years can't be bad, and the price and packaging for the entire series was phenomenal, so we bought it.  We are still talking about the series three weeks after we viewed the last show.  Think Michael Corleone as a motorcycle club dude who slowly gets involved, or dragged, in to the seamier sides of the gang.  Promises made are sure to be broken.

When I don't watch the dvds I have been watching episodes on Amazon Prime as well. I made it to Season 6 episode 13 ""A Mother's Work"" on Amazon Prime last evening. I decided to wait and watch it on the dvd...but when I put disc 4 in there was no 13th episode! It is completely missing from the disc, not labeled on the front or anything. Had I not been watching on Amazon Prime where it tells you the episode names I would have never known. Not that big a deal I suppose, but disappointing for the price I paid for the complete series. I'm posting this in hopes that other people will share if their own is the same way or if I just got ""lucky"".

6965673,2,B00S9S12R0,"A couple of the discs (so far) are flakey. The episodes stick and jump. So far it's been the extended episodes, but it has been the last two I watched. If this keeps up, I'll have to return them.

It doesn't seem to be defective disks. It seems to be the way the extended episodes are formatted on the DVD. If I selected the extended version of the episode, and try to scroll past the ""previously on"", then the disk gets confused and skips the extended scenes. If I try to scroll forward or back to catch something I missed or move past something I've already seen, then it may skip an extended scene. I've ordered to normal season 4 set (that's where I was at when the DVDs arrived), to see if the issue is on those disks as well. I will them check the other extended episodes (season 3, etc) and see if it happens there as well. If so, I'm sending this back.",1426291200,4,860,4.180722891566265

6965684,4,B00S9S12R0,"A decent show that sadly doesn't become EXCELLENT until season 4.  Season's 1 and 2 were good enough, but you felt like the writers still really didn't have a full idea on what they wanted this show to be.  Then comes the dreadful season 3 where most of the cast locates to Ireland to find one of the main characters kidnapped sons.  This plotline takes up the whole season leaving you screaming at the television to ""PLEASE JUST FIND YOUR KID ALREADY SO WE CAN END THIS BORING STORYLINE!""

I didn't watch this show when it first aired, but I have to wonder if at the time season 3 wasn't well received by fans and maybe a whole new writing team and show runner was brought in to clean things up?  I don't know but the contrast between season 3 and the rest of the show is night and day.  It finally finds its footing in season 4 and grabs you by the throat and doesn't let you go until the end.  Would be one of the best TV shows ever right up there with Breaking Bad had it not been for the tame first 2 seasons, and the lame 3rd.",1425600000,4,1032,4.104477611940299

6965694,5,B00S9S12R0,"I still remember the day I first heard of this ""new show"" coming to FX. I said, ""what the hell. Let's check it out"". Best decision I made. This show had everything a ""dude"" looks for in a TV show. It's got: guns, drugs, sex, women, murders, gangs, revenge- I mean, everything I loved about Goodfellas, Casino, The Godfather, American Me, Blood In Blood Out, Colors, Donnie Brasco, The Departed, Scarface (to mention a few, lol), but everything I loved when watching those movies finally arrived on TV through Sons of Anarchy. The cast was so great that even now I have some sort of ""hate"" towards the actual actors, even though I KNOW they were just playing a role. Lol... This Collector's Set is the greatest finale any lover of the show can have. It is the cherry on top, if you will. Great picture quality on both the DVD and the Bluray. The extra features are phenomenal. The book itself which carries each season disc is a fun collector's items in itself. I really applaud FX and the SOA personnel involved in putting this together. It really exceeded my expectations, and I know that this will be an item that I will cherish for years and years to come.",1424736000,32,1159,4.497630331753554
