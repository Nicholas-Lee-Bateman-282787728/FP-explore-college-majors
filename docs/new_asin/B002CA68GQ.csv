8363779,4,B002CA68GQ,"""Roselyne and the Lions"" (1989) is directed by Jean-Jacques Beineix (Betty Blue, Moon in the Gutter, Diva). The film is about the romantic relationship of a young couple who seek to live the life of lion tamers. They eventually join a circus in Munich and take over from the trainer. The film was much more interesting than I expected as I felt I was involved in watching an authentic portrayal of the life of lion tamers with all of its thrills and dangers.

This is the director's cut which is the full 176 minutes in length. The information on Amazon is incorrect about the film being only 170 minutes. Also included is a 78 minutes feature about the making of the film.",1400284800,4,673,4.516393442622951

This is a cool '80s french movie with a very interesting story premise.
Movies like this won't be made in this day of age any more.
What with all the humane society watch and all the red tape surrounding animals used in a movie.
Highly recommend it.",1278115200,5,291,4.12280701754386
