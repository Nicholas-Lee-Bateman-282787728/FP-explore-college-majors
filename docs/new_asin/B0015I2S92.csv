8258663,3,B0015I2S92,"Have to admit that I was very let down when the 15 Anos de Exitos DVD showed up with only six videos on it...I didn't realize I was getting an abreviated rendition since it didn't indicate it as such in the product information, which is why I only gave three stars to it.  But, as for the content, it is classic Alejandro at his best...Luckily, my always favorite, the LIVE rendition of ""Que Voy Hacer Con Mi Amor,"" is on it.

All told, sweet on the eyes, sweet on the ears.  But, they should let you know this is not the complete DVD version so you can scout out the full one and purchase that one instead.  Luckily, his self-titled DVD has all the other ones you'd want that were missing on this one...especially ""Quisiera,"" which should come with a box of tissues.  If you have these two DVD's you've got them all.",1214438400,2,817,4.313725490196078
