8156678,5,B000KGFAX6,"Capoeira is very special and difficult to describe. Mestre Itabora made a beautiful Dvd.
Everything comes down to understanding the basics.",1361318400,,139,5.666666666666667
8156679,5,B000KGFAX6,"I like this video because the mestre/teacher explains the basic defenses and kicks in a step-by-step demonstration.  There are power-point-like bullet points to detail each move.  This was essential to gaining an understanding of the moves as a beginner in capoeira classes.  I was able to pick up and then quickly being to practice the correct way of moving. When in class I see some students overlooking this (i.e. keeping an arm up to protect your face), basically b/c they have not been corrected or seen the essential foundations of the moves.  In class, there are too many people and not enough time for the teacher to lead and watch every student.  So all in all, a great starter to beginners, and even intermediates may be able to correct some mistakes.",1352764800,5,761,4.778625954198473
