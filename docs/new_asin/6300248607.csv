The main draw, for me, is Kim Basinger, who is **** adorable and sexy as Nadine.",1238716800,2,335,4.317460317460317

277816,4,6300248607,My wife saw this movie on T.V. awhile back and thought it was funny and asked me if I ever ran across it on DVD to get a copy of it.  I was looking for another DVD on Amazon when I saw the title and ordered one for my wife.  She was very pleased!!  Thanks for stocking such a variety of DVD's for us to choose from!!,1179705600,,316,3.6865671641791047
277817,3,6300248607,"This is the kind of movie that starts out with strikingly real characterizations--Nadine is herself quite a piece of work, Texas country simple but shrewd with a strong will--and an interesting premise, but doesn't maintain the excellence.

Kim Basinger is gorgeous in the title role and natural.  Jeff Brides plays her estranged husband Vernon Hightower who owns a bar in Austin, Texas circa 1954 that is not doing much in the way of business.  He is one of those guys who dream of making it big financially in business as a proof of his manhood, a guy who has always just gotten by on his good looks, a guy who often lies and cuts corners and can't be trusted, but a guy with a smile to charm a rattlesnake.  These two really love each other but are currently in the process of getting divorced and Vernon has a girl friend (Renee, played with eager finesse by Glenne Headly) that he wants to marry, he thinks.

The plot begins with Nadine going to a photographer's studio and demanding to get back some ""art studio"" shots of her that were taken under the guise of being shown to Hugh Hefner at Playboy.  The photographer is murdered and Nadine mistakenly ends up with some photos of the plans for the new Interstate that will be built nearby, plans that Buford Pope (Rip Torn) and his thugs want for themselves because, if you know where the highway will be built you can buy up the property near it on the cheap and then sell it later for a big profit.  Vernon knows this too and when he finds the photos in Nadine's purse, he takes off with them.

The questions that the plot will answer are (1) Will Vernon and Nadine escape from Buford Pope and his strongmen with the photos and their lives? and (2) Will Vernon and Nadine realize they really love each other and find true love and happiness together?

There is a shoot-out in a junkyard near the end that's...different, and there's a neat car chase and...well, the movie that started out so well deteriorates into something ordinary, but not all that bad.

Robert Benton, who wrote the script for Bonnie and Clyde (1967) and both wrote and directed Kramer vs. Kramer (1979) directed.  He has a fine feel for character and can write authentic and witty dialogue.  He is not at his best here; nonetheless this is definitely worth seeing mainly because Bridges and Basinger do such a great job of filling up the screen.  Basinger in particular is wonderful.  See it for her.",1167091200,2,2429,4.554022988505747
277818,3,6300248607,"Here's a flick about two idiots that get mixed up in a plot to defraud the state of Texas and, instead of winding up in jail, end up better off than when they started.

Set in Texas in the mid-1950s, Kim Basinger is a pregnant hairdresser who happens onto plans to expand a superhighway through certain parts of town. She inadvertantly shares these certain moneymaking secrets with separated but not yet divorced husband Jeff Bridges, in one of his better roles, and ends up in a pickle with humorous bad guy Rip Torn and his idiotic assistants.

Basically, the pair escape the police, bad guys, death, dishonor and everything else in a screwball comedy that will keep you glued to the screen with its action, plot and humor. This is Basinger's best early comedy besides ""Blind Date"".

Bridges, who excelled in a similar nincompoop role as ""The Great Lebowski"", is here an idiot of the first order who nonetheless ends up being the hero and outduels the even more idiotic bad guys in something akin to the Keystone Cops vs. Laurel and Hardy.

I really enjoyed the great old cars on display in this film, especially that 1949 or 1950 Ford the pair had at one time. That was the first ""fenderless"" car in history. Another scene shows a great old 1955 Oldsmobile. There are great 1950s automobiles in almost every scene.

Meanwhile, there a funny screwball comedy going on all the time that you'll enjoy. Look for Bridges great scenes where he is intractably caught by either people or a situation with his exclamation, ""I've got the situation under control."" It's a great line! So's the movie.",1160265600,7,1591,4.7086330935251794
277819,5,6300248607,"MOVIE :

I love this movie. It's a very good 80's comedy, not the best. Jeff Bridges is Vernon, a broke bar owner close to file bankruptcy. But his would-be ex-wife Nadine (Kim Basinger), whose job is about hairdressing,  can help. It's a matter of :

1.signing divorce papers,

2. Taking back Nadine's ""art studies"" photographs,

3. Escaping from a band of awkward bandits looking for other photographs...

You see the plot !

DVD :

This release is pretty good. The picture and the color are neat.

So, if you like Kim and Jeff, you should have this one.",1159660800,,556,4.5353535353535355
277820,5,6300248607,"I guess I'm having a Kim Basinger day today, but in addition to Elvis Has Left the Building, I would like to recommend this 1987 comedy which also showcases Basinger's Georgian accent.

It's 1954 in Austin, Texas, and Nadine Hightower is in a lot of trouble.  She's gone to sleazy photographer Raymond Escobar's studio to reclaim some photos from him because they were ""lots more artistic than I bargained for.""  Unfortunately, when she's in the back room retrieving the folder, Escobar is stabbed, and she runs like hell from the scene with an envelope that has her name on it, but inside are the illegally obtained blueprints for a super highway development that ends up in the hands of her estranged husband, Vernon (Jeff Bridges), a handsome, wise-mouthed  bum who owns a virtually patron free bar called the Blue Bonnet and that's not the worst of it.  He's fooling around with a former baton queen who works for the Lone Star Brewing company (a ditzy blond played humorously well by Glenn Headley), and Nadine, a local beautician, is expecting his baby!  All this, and snake handling outlaw Buford Pope (Rip Torn) wants those blueprints back while at the same time, Nadine and Vernon want a divorce.  Ain't love grand?

This movie has a great, authentic 50s setup, topnotch acting, and there's undeniable chemistry between Bridges and Basinger.  You must be warned that there is a lot of foul language, but if you can overlook it, this movie is fun, full of suspense, and has a sweet romantic thread that weaves it all together.  This is a flick both men and women will enjoy because it has something for everyone, and the soundtrack, mostly supplied by sister country duo Sweethearts of the Rodeo, all work to make this movie charming and fun.",1143331200,14,1750,4.78405315614618
277821,5,6300248607,"It's Austin, Texas, 1954, and Jeff Bridges's biggest ambition is a gaudy neon to top-off his tacky, no-business, beer bar, while estranged wife and apprentice hairdresser Kim Basinger sends her ""art photos"" to Playboy magazine. Obviously they're made for each other. Meanwhile, her sleazo photographer turns up dead and they're on the run. It's delightful madcap as they bumble their way through a series of misadventures. Their subtly affectionate sniping reminds me of a bad grammar version of Nick and Nora Charles in the uptown Thin Man series. Surprisingly, the California born Bridges has the ""good ol' boy"" drawl down pat, while even the usually snooty Basinger manages a convincing honky-tonk queen. Good period detail without the distractive sounds of Golden Oldies. -- With a delightfully arch Rip Torn as the slyly superior villian. It's amazing how these little gems keep getting produced with little or no recognition.  All in all, great escapist fare for a slow evening at home.",1141776000,8,992,5.2
277822,3,6300248607,"""Nadine"" is an example of the quirky choices that distinguishes Jeff Bridges from his peers.  It's also an example as to why Bridges is not as big a star as he should be.  ""Nadine"" is not a bad film, far from it.  It's just so...slight.  It goes down easy like a bottle of Lone Star beer but you've forgotten it an hour after you've digested it.  This is really surprising considering not only the talent in front of the camera but also the presence of Academy award winning director Robert Benton behind it.  That said, Bridges and Kim Basinger have good screen chemistry that make the film eminently watchable.  Good art direction depicting Austin, Texas circa 1954 and cinematography from master lensman Nestor Alemendros.  The bottom line is that this is a good film to pass the time as the summer wanes.",1121904000,5,808,4.640845070422535
277823,5,6300248607,"This is a great romantic comedy set in 50's Texas starring Kim Bassinger and Jeff Bridges,it's a must see with plenty of adventure!!",1101859200,3,132,4.782608695652174
277884,4,6300248607,"Kim plays a nearly divorced hairstylist desperate to retrieve some nude photos of herself that she posed for in a weak moment. Unfortunately she chooses the worst possible moment to confront the photographer (played by Jerry Stiller) over the matter at his studio....no sooner does she go there to talk to him when she unwittingly hears him getting murdered after he hides her in the back room of his office.

In the midst of this Nadine also has to deal with the fact that she is carrying the child of her soon-to-be-ex-husband Vernon (Jeff Bridges), a down-on-on-his-luck bar owner who is in serious financial straits and also happens to have a new girl on the side.. All that takes a back seat however when they both find themselves at the mercy of Buford Pope (Rip Torn), an unscrupulous and ruthless businessman. He is well aware that Nadine was there at the time of the murder and is after a map (involving a road scheme worth loads of money) that she unwittingly took with her when she fled the scene and the map that Vernon snatched back at her place.

From then on Vernon and Nadine have to fight to save their lives as well as their marriage as Pope and his crew set out to get the map back and eliminate any and all loose ends (meaning the two of them).

I always felt that Kim Basinger was underrated as an actress and she really shines in the title role. Rip Torn makes an excellent and oily villain, he really convinces you that he will do anything, including murder, to get his way and to let nothing and nobody stand in his way.

I love the soundtrack from the movie too.

If I have one quibble with the movie, it's that I just don't see the chemistry between Kim and Jeff Bridges. I mean, I also liked Jeff in here, however my feeling is this: even though the movie gives the impression that Vernon and Nadine will live happily ever after at the end of the movie, nothing has really changed with Vernon's situation. He is still in the financial hole, and Nadine, the more sensible of the two up to that point, has now even started to share his rose colored view of the future. I'm all for happy endings, but even I can't help but feel that despite the optimistic climax they're still going to have serious problems to have to work through.

Having said that I still feel it's a highly enjoyable film.",1439596800,,2317,4.427230046948357
277885,5,6300248607,ABSOLUTELY ADORABLE.  Wonderful performances by Kim Bassinger and Jeff Bridges is a wonder.,1438387200,,91,6.0

277887,4,6300248607,"If nothing else, this showcases Kim Basinger's knack as a fine comedienne. NADINE (1987) is an affable stew that blends in bits of romantic comedy and crime thriller and period piece. The story sets itself in Austin, Texas, circa 1954. As it opens, hairdresser Nadine Hightower (Basinger) arrives at the studio of a sleazy photographer to retrieve a portfolio of ""art studies"" the creep had shot of her (there may have been a promise given her that these photos will end up with Hugh Hefner). So, no, Nadine isn't exactly the brightest bulb.

Still, she's got it more together than her soon-to-be ex-hubbie Vernon (Jeff Bridges). Vernon is that guy we all know, who dreams big but achieves miniscule deeds. His sole pride and joy is the Blue Bonnet Bar, a floundering enterprise he hopes to remedy by, like, putting up a big neon sign. Like that would fend off foreclosure. Nadine pries him from his current girlfriend - the amorous Pecan Queen (Glenne Headly) - and drags him to the art studio, with Vernon clueless that they're visiting a crime scene, and the both of them unaware that she'd gotten her mitts not on her nekkid portfolio but, rather, on top secret plans for a proposed superhighway, of which advanced peek someone can parlay into a windfall at the real estate market. Enter ruthless businessman Buford Pope (Rip Torn). He's got a box full of rattlesnakes, veiled menace in his silky disposition, and two burly goons to carry out his orders. Surely, Nadine and Vernon ain't no match for him, right? Cue the screwball shenanigans.

A couple of things make this a fun watch. A few things keep it from being an all-out blast. The period detail plonks you convincingly in the 1950s era. Songs by the Sweethearts of the Rodeo lend to the urban honky tonk atmosphere. More than anything else, the two leads achieve this irresistible alchemy. Okay, they're both so damn good to look at, it inspires this knee-jerk resentment from homelier folks like me. But I love their droll bickering and the sizzle between them. Bridges is effortlessly charming, all glibness and unfounded confidence and sh-- eating grin. Take a drink every time he says, ""I'm on top of this whole situation"" (which he mostly never is). He is so good at playing the glad-handing salesman, an act he'll have perfectly honed by the time TUCKER: THE MAN AND HIS DREAM (1988) and SEABISCUIT (2003) swung around. Basinger is one of those actresses who is so stunning to look at, you can't perceive the acting chops for the beguiling physical package. But she acts well in this movie. She wonderfully toes the line between dizzy dame and gutsy heroine. She isn't as obviously excellent here as she is in L.A. CONFIDENTIAL (1997). But it's much harder to do comedy than drama. Two of the supporting players lend tremendous color. Glenne Headly's va-va-va-boom damsel and Rip Torn's unscrupulous landgrabber with his oh-so-sly delivery. He drops the movie's two best lines: ""I swear you two are living testimony to the fact that it's better to be lucky than smart"" and ""Why is it you work your butt off all your life just to get ahead, and it takes a couple of nitwits about ten minutes to screw the whole thing up?"" Heh.

It should've been better than it was. The actors, lively as they are, can only do so much. The plot points fall so curiously anemic. Blame the thin material, the flat comic beats, that drabby McGuffin. There's this small screen sensibility, as if you were watching a television show, and it's probably the kiss of death for a major motion picture that leaves that sort of impression. There are scenes that just sit there, with their low energy and inciting a frisson of meh. In the end, Basinger and Bridges' chemistry gets the movie over the hump, and I can waste away hours looking at Basinger in her prime.",1432598400,,3805,4.727409638554217
