3536968,5,B001DQFMKI,"I have all four of Sharilyn's Jewelry workshop Dvd's---I have to say that this is my favorite one. She shows how to make the pieces pictured, but it's mostly about making all of the components that you see. It's about putting them together the way you want.  There are several techniques taught in clear details. These are clear videos with great audio as well. I highly recommend these videos!!",1218412800,5,395,4.72463768115942
8294537,5,B001DQFMKI,"I was very impressed with this book, and instructional jewelry books rarely impress me. There were a number of techniques in this book that had not occurred to me before, and I have been able to adapt them extensively to other projects in different ways. It was very easy to follow, and the finished pieces were gorgeous just to look at. I've come a long way with my metalworking since I got this book, and I still use a lot of things I learned from it. Definitely worth the money.",1360886400,,481,4.355555555555555
8294538,5,B001DQFMKI,Sharilyn Miller has done it once again by creating again another great DVD. I just wish I had access to all of the wonderful coins she so beautifully incorporates into her designs.,1352332800,,180,4.65625
8294539,5,B001DQFMKI,"I found this DVD to be very informative to the point that I made my first piece of wire jewerly with confidence.  I most certainly would recommend these videos to anyone that is interested in learning this beautiful art form.

8294540,5,B001DQFMKI,I really like this video.  Lots of technique and instruction. Sharilyn is one talented lady. The only thing I didn't like was the mentioning of her other videos more than once.  I still want the other videos but felt like it was just a little pushy.  I would recommend it to anyone wanting wireworking instruction.  You will watch it over and over and take notes.,1235001600,2,363,4.538461538461538
8294541,5,B001DQFMKI,"Sharilyn Miller is truly the Queen of Wire Jewelry making.  Everything she does is first rate!  Her previous DVD's are all outstanding.  Her newest video:  ""Ethnic Style"" may well be the best of the series.  Miller manages to provide valuable information for both novices and accomplished artisans.  Her designs are stylish, tasteful, and just plain cool.  She is also able to take a timeless piece such as her ""Back to Egypt"" bracelet and make it much better with a simple reorientation of the link design.  This is a wonderful workshop and no practicing wire or metal jewelry artist should be without it.",1223164800,4,606,4.872549019607843

8294544,5,B001DQFMKI,"Sharilyn has produced another excellent DVD with new techniques that I was anxious to learn.  She is an excellent teacher who continues to come up with new ideas and techniques that keep me interested and wanting to learn the next thing that she has to offer.
Making wire jewelry is an ongoing learning experience for me and I have come so far in the past two years that it is amazing. Her book, Bead on a Wire and all her DVDs are the very best.
Thanks, Sharilyn for all your hard work in bringing the world of wire jewelry making to me and so many others who love it.",1218499200,6,569,4.220183486238532
