8414673,1,B0043CT9BW,"This program really rates no stars, but that is not possible, so it gets one.  Buying it, is a waste of money.  Watching it, is a waste of an hour.  Much of the soundtrack is virtually unintelligible.  The ""incidental"" music runs almost continuously and at a volume that interferes with hearing the spoken words.  The words themselves are frequently hard to understand.  The selection of visuals available to the production was apparently limited: the same ones are used over and over and frequently have no relationship to the soundtrack.  The on-camera host is almost constantly in motion and often talks to the camera over his shoulder.  There is nothing new in the content that has not been readily available in print for years.",1319414400,5,732,4.894308943089431

1) It is an attempted analytical study of the origins of Sherlock Holmes, as a charatcer created by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, and who were the different persons whose traits eventually got combined in finally giving shape to Sherlock Holmes, told with the help of some inputs from researchers, and some rather meaningless shots.

2) It tries to explain (one of the many theories) how Sir Arthur had desperately sought to prevent some of the darker things of his past from emerging in public by getting rid of Holmes, since it was Sherlock Holmes and his adventures that were telling much more about the good doctor than he had wished to share with others.

The film/documentary/dramatised discussion suffers from a few terrible maladies that drag it down. These are: -

1) Some of the ""actors"" selected to portray Holmes take the artistic liberties by an uncomfortable extent.
