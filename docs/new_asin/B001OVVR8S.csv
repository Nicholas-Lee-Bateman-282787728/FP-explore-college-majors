8331607,3,B001OVVR8S,"Since Amazon does not have a listing for this, I will put it here.  This is a VCI DVD-R Three Mesquiteers Double Feature.  ""Ghost Town Gold""(1936) overall looks quite good.  ""Come On Cowboy""(1937) also looks pretty decent, with one minor dialogue splice.  The major problem with these are that they are the edited 53 minute TV versions.  This seems to be a recurring problem with VCI's DVD-R releases, leaving me to question whether they should even be putting these out.",1355788800,,471,4.8375

The story begins when the Three Mesquiteers get paid for delivering cattle. ""$4,300 is a lot of money for one man to be packing around."" Lullaby offers to deposit it in a local bank. When he gets there Lullaby plays ""three-card monte"", the classic rigged gambling game. Does gambling bring in money to build up a town? Shots from the street provides an answer. The Town Council bans the prize fight and orders Barrington to close his business. [Note how a business owner claims what is good for him is also good for the town.] Barrington plans to get even with Thornton the bank owner. Stony and Tucson find Lullaby gambling. At night burglars clean out the bank's safe. The bank is ruined. The Three Mesquiteers will try to help. A customer makes a transaction. Tucson will fight to help Thornton. People bet on their chosen winner.

The fight begins, we see many body blows (using doubles). The crowd cheers. Tucson is knocked down. People continue to bet on the fight. How did Jake get that bank money? Tucson wins the fight. They race after Jake before Buck's gang can get him. Jake hides, and makes scary noises to frighten two of the gang. The same screams frighten the others. Sabina and Lullaby find Uncle Jake. Jake has a plan to escape then the bells ring. Stony and Tucson escape with the money sacks. An angry crowd wants to get into the bank. There is shooting in the street. Can Sabina race to town with the money? The Three Mesquiteers grab Barrington and walk in the street to halt the gunfight. This returned money saves the bank. Barrington leaves town quickly.

This story was adapted from a novel by William Colt MacDonald. The robbery of a small bank leads to a local depression (the loss of money). It shows how a sleazy entertainment district harms a town overall. Having a saloon owner as the secret head of an outlaw gang was a recurring theme in the classic westerns of the 1930s. Was this just a fictional notion? Do you know who owns the local ""gentleman's club"" in your county? The success of the Three Mesquiteers led to copies like the ""Rough Riders"", ""Range Riders"", and ""Texas Rangers"". They were as good or bad as the originals. Does this formula work today? Just look at popular TV dramas over the years.",1292630400,,2267,4.606435643564357
