8072945,4,B000A2QJN0,"Leos Janacek is a composer  not to be dismissed. You either love his music and make a great effort to try to undrstand it because you have developed a liking for it or you stay away from it all together. He is a composer who suffered from musical authorities criticism, being too far advanced beyond his time. Janacek developed his own style based upon the sound of speech. His orchestral music puts the brass section forward, his expressive woodwind instruments weep an laugh and his rhythms often remind us of folkloric dance music.
The text of the Glagolitic Mass follows Russian orthodox models GLAGOLITICA, the oldest of the Byzantine writings devoted to the Cristianizination of the Slavs.
The Czech Philharmonic Orchestra is traditionally connected with Janacek's music and the late Sir Charles Mackerras, who studied conducting with Vaclav Talich became somewhat of an authority on the complex scores. The soloists are mostly Czech and the result including the majestic organ solo is overpowering.
The Taras Bulba Symphonic Poem is based on the tale of the Russian legendary Kosaak warrior and his death. A colourful piece of descriptive
orchestral music with no dull moment. The prelude to Jenufa was composed long before the opera and makes an effective conclusion to this DVD totally devoted to music of Leos Janacek. For whomever wants to take a step to become acquinted with Janacek's music this is my recommendation.

8072946,4,B000A2QJN0,"I often wonder why some recordings have to suffer misfortunes due to inept recording engineers. On this DVD, the movement ""Slava"" while well performed experiences distortion and there are times when the tympani have an unbearable hollow sound in spite of the world class effort of the tympanist himself. Enough of this I guess. This is not a top notch recording.

In 2009, someone posted on YouTube the Glagolitic Mass with Andrew Davis and the BBC Symphony live at the Royal Festival Hall. This event while full of fire and energy does seem to overlook what Mackerras accomplishes here.
Sir Charles, on this DVD, I feel is leading a Mass with all the reverence due this style of music while Davis is maybe leaning toward the fact that Janacek was an atheist and thus presents in the manner I mentioned above. (I could be wrong, but it IS a Mass).

The Prague Chorus is outstanding with affectionate performing from the Czech Philharmonic. The soloists are marvelous with exceptional diction and impressive intonation and Mackerras allows us to listen for Janacek's intricate scoring throughout. The only minus to all of this was the organ work and the first violins. I incontestably prefer organist Simon Preston's effort (Davis/YouTube) offering better line and momentum. Mr. Hora tends to drag and fracture the score to quite an annoying effect even though the organ in Dvorak Hall is an exceptional instrument. The first violins too many times lose sectional cohesion and it sticks out considerably.

This is a fine DVD to own, however, make no mistake about it. The added bonus of ""Jealousy"" and ""Taras Bulba"" make it a worthwhile purchase simply because of the wonderful performances and the recorded sound of these two works is a marked improvement over the Mass.",1270512000,3,1770,4.952861952861953
