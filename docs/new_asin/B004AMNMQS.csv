8420515,5,B004AMNMQS,"This is a movie of those times when social themes, comprising of family bonding and pure innocent love overcoming all obstacles is told in the most simplistic way. Kishore Kumar fans will relish this movie as his superb comic timing with his down-to-earth acting will move many hearts. A special mention for the charming Sadhna as she plays the role of a bhajji-wali and sings the sweet number "" Main to tum Sang"" fills ones heart with memorable with such pleasure that can be derived only from the Black & White era. Also, you will enjoy ""Zarorat hai zarorat hai"" by Kishore Kumar in the movie which has become some kind of an anthem for eligible bachelors !! Overall, I found the movie a good Sunday watch with the whole family (if you've been trying to do that for sometime! I am sure that you'll be humming those soulful numbers along-with one or more of your senior members-- and thats quite a bonding isn't it ?)",1302480000,,918,4.536144578313253
